The petitioner has filed this petition seeking the following relief(s):-\n\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017 -2-\n\n\"10.1 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be\npleased to :\n\n(a) direct the respondent/State to end the probation\nof the petitioner w.e.f. 04.05.1998.\n\n(b) That the respondent/state may kindly be\ndirected to consider the case of promotion of the\npetitioner on the post of Assistant Director Mahila\nAvam Bal Vikas w.e.f. the date of respondent No.5\nwas promoted on that post in the year 2005 and\naccordingly to fix the seniority and place of the\npetitioner in the gradation list of Assistant Directors,\nand to grant her further promotions accordingly.\n\n(c) In the alternative respondent No.1-4 may kindly\nbe directed to grant promotion to the petitioner at\npar and from the same date from which respondent\nNo.6 Abhay Dewangan has been granted\npromotion on the post of Assistant Director in 2013\nw.e.f. 08.07.2013 and to fix her seniority on the\npost of Assistant Director accordingly.\n\n10.2 Any other relief which this Hon'ble Court\ndeems fit under the facts and circumstances of the\ncase including the cost of the petition.\n\n10.3 That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be\npleased to issue appropriate writ/order to quash\nthe order dated 24.09.2014, bearing No.F-1-\n33/2007/MBAVI/50, passed by respondent No.1\"\n\n2. The facts of the present case are that the petitioner was appointed\n\nto the post of Project Officer in Mahila Avam Bal Vikas Vibhag on\n\n23.04.1996. She joined her services on 04.05.1996 on probation for a\n\nperiod of two years. On 26.09.2000, the petitioner made a representation\n\nbefore the respondent authorities for confirmation of her services. An\n\norder was passed in this regard on 12.12.2005 and the services of the\n\npetitioner were confirmed from 27.07.2002. Thereafter, the petitioner\n\nmoved a fresh representation on 06.06.2006 before the respondent\n\nauthorities to the effect that her services ought to have been regularized\n\non completion of two years probation period i.e. on 04.05.1998 but her\n\nservices were confirmed on 27.07.2002 and the annual increment was\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017\ngranted from the year 2003. It is further pleaded that in the year 2005,\n\nsome of the project officers were promoted to the post of Assistant\n\nDirector but the name of the petitioner was not taken into consideration.\n\nThereafter, Writ Petition No. 3984 of 2007 was filed claiming therein\n\nannual increment, the benefit of seniority, promotion, confirmation of\n\nprobation immediately after completion of two years and consequential\n\nbenefits. That petition was disposed of on 28.03.2008 granting liberty to\n\nthe petitioner to make a representation before the respondent authorities\n\nand the direction was issued to the concerned authority to decide the\n\nrepresentation within a stipulated time. The petitioner submitted her\n\nrepresentation on 02.04.2008 and for a personal hearing, she was called\n\non 20.05.2008 and 27.05.2008. On 26.06.2008, an order was passed by\n\nrespondent No.1 but according to the petitioner, her representation was\n\nnot considered properly. Thereafter, the petitioner filed a Contempt\n\nPetition No.175 of 2008 which was disposed of on 20.01.2010 observing\n\nthat since the representation has already been decided, no case is made\n\nout. On 01.02.2011, a letter was issued to the petitioner granting her a\n\npersonal hearing on her representation where she appeared on\n\n06.01.2012 and 18.02.2013 and an order was passed on 24.09.2014.\n\nThe seniority list of the project officers was published with effect from\n\n01.04.2012. Again the Departmental Promotion Committee was\n\nconvened in the month of July, 2013 and the name of the petitioner was\n\nnot considered thus, the petitioner has preferred this petition seeking the\n\nreliefs as mentioned above.\n\n3. Mr. Sahu, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner argued that\n\nthe petitioner was entitled to get promotion to the post of Assistant\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017 -4-\n\nDirector in the department in the year 2005 when similarly situated\n\nproject officers were promoted to the post of Assistant Director. He\n\nfurther argued that again in the year 2013, her name was not considered.\n\nHe also argued that earlier, a writ petition was filed and the reliefs were\n\nsought concerning confirmation of services after completion of a\n\nprobation period of two years, grant of seniority, promotion, grant of\n\nannual increment from the date of appointment and its arrears and the\n\nother reliefs. He further submitted that the representation made by the\n\npetitioner pursuant to the order dated 28.03.2008 was decided by the\n\nrespondent authorities on 24.09.2014 and a copy of that order was\n\nplaced along with the return filed by the State. He also submitted that the\n\nclaim of the petitioner has not been redressed. He further stated that\n\ncertain allegations were made against the petitioner and those\n\nallegations were duly inquired but nothing relevant was found. He also\n\nstated that the Departmental Promotion Committee had found the\n\npetitioner eligible for promotion and later on, the petitioner was promoted\n\nto the post of Assistant Director vide order dated 22.07.2002 whereas\n\nher name was considered in the Departmental Promotion Committee\n\nconvened in the year 2007. He referred to the minutes of the meeting of\n\nthe Departmental Promotion Committee where it is observed that no\n\nadverse remarks were made against the petitioner and the annual\n\nconfidential report was not communicated to her. He further contended\n\nthat the petitioner was entitled to get a promotion in the year 2007 itself.\n\nThus, he prayed that a direction may be issued to the respondent\n\nauthorities to consider the claim of the petitioner for promotion from the\n\nyear 2007 and further to make payment of arrears of salary.\n\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017\n4. On the other hand, Mr. Gupta, the learned Government Advocate\n\nappearing for the State as well as Mr. Panda, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor respondent No. 4 would oppose the submissions made by Mr. Sahu.\n\nThey submitted that the petitioner could not complete two years of\n\nprobation period successfully as there were adverse remarks against\n\nher. They further submitted that the probation period of the petitioner was\n\nnot found satisfactory by the Departmental Promotion Committee,\n\ntherefore, her services were confirmed from 27.07.2002. They also\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner has not challenged the order dated\n\n26.06.2008 whereby her representation was rejected. They further\n\nargued that in WPS No.3984 of 2007, the petitioner challenged the order\n\ndated 27.07.2002 whereby her services were confirmed, a direction to\n\nrespondent No.1 to issue a fresh order of revocation of the probation with\n\neffect from 04.05.1998, grant of annual increment with effect from\n\n04.05.1998 instead of 22.07.2002, arrears, reckoning of seniority, and\n\ngrant of promotion and release of withheld salary from March, 2007.\n\nThey also argued that the petition was disposed of on 28.03.2008\n\nwherein the petitioner pressed only one relief concerning the completion\n\nof her probation period on 04.05.1998 and other reliefs and grounds\n\nwere not raised by the petitioner and the direction was issued by this\n\nCourt to the respondent authorities to consider the grievance of the\n\npetitioner. They further contended that the petitioner has waived her right\n\nto seek other reliefs which were already sought in the earlier writ petition.\n\nThey also contended that the principle of waiver and acquiescence\n\nwould apply in toto in the present case. They further stated that again the\n\nrepresentation of the petitioner was rejected vide order dated 26.06.2008\n\nand that order has also not been challenged by the petitioner in the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017 -6-\n\npresent petition whereby the claim of the petitioner was thoroughly\n\nconsidered concerning grant of annual increment, seniority, promotion\n\netc. They also stated that the claim of the petitioner concerning\n\npromotion was turned down by the department wherein it is observed by\n\nthe authority that though the representation of the petitioner was rejected\n\nby the State on merits even thereafter the petitioner made repeated\n\nrepresentations including the review application and therefore, an\n\nexplanation was sought from the petitioner and again a representation\n\nwas made on 01.02.2011. In para 6 of the order dated 24.09.2014, it is\n\nheld that in the DPC held in the year 2013, the name of the petitioner\n\nwas considered but she was not found suitable by the Departmental\n\nPromotion Committee. Even in the year 2005, her name was within the\n\nzone of consideration but she was not found fit. In para 8, it is observed\n\nby the authority that there is no improvement in the functioning of the\n\npetitioner, she used to disobey the orders of superior authorities and she\n\nmade representations raising similar grievances. They further contended\n\nthat as per the averments made in the petition, the petitioner was entitled\n\nto get a promotion in the year 2005 and thereafter in the year 2013 but\n\nthe claim of the promotion was raised in the earlier petition which was\n\nnot pressed and no representation in this regard was made before the\n\nState authorities and therefore, after a lapse of nine years, the\n\npetitioner's claim with regard to seniority and promotion is stale.\n\nTherefore, the present petition is liable to be dismissed.\n\n5. I have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties and\n\nperused the documents placed on the record.\n\n6. Admittedly, the petitioner was appointed to the post of Project\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017\nOfficer under the Mahila Avam Bal Vikas Vibhag and her services were\n\nregularized on 22.07.2002. Initially, the petitioner was appointed on\n\nprobation for a period of two years and when her services were not\n\nconfirmed, she made a representation but from a perusal of the order\n\ndated 26.06.2008, certain adverse remarks appear against the petitioner,\n\ntherefore, her services were not confirmed. Undisputedly, the petitioner\n\nhas not challenged the order dated 26.06.2008 whereas that order was\n\npassed pursuant to the order passed in WPS No.3984 of 2007.\n\n7. WPS No. 3984 of 2007 was filed and the following reliefs were\n\nsought:-\n\n\"(1) That this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\nissue a writ in the nature of mandamus commanding\nthe respondents to produce the entire records relating\nto the probation, promotion as well as withholding of the\npetitioner's salary for kind perusal of this Court;\n(2) That this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\nissue a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the\nimpugned order Annexure P/1;\n\n(3) That this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\nissue a writ in the nature of mandamus commanding\nthe respondent No.1 to issue fresh order of revocation\nof probation w.e.f. 04.05.1998 i.e. the date on which the\npetitioner completed two years probation period;\n(4) That the respondents may kindly be directed to\ngrant benefit of annual increment w.e.f. 04.05.1998\ninstead of 22.07.2002 and arrears of increments and\nother consequential benefits may kindly be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\n(5) That the respondent No.1 may kindly be directed to\npromote the petitioner on the next higher post from the\ndate on which junior to her has been promoted and\nassigned the seniority on the appropriate place together\nwith all consequential benefits;\n\n(6) That this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\ncommand the respondents to forthwith release the\nwithheld salary for the period from March 2007 till date;\n(7) Any other relief which this Hon'ble Court may deem\nfit and proper may also be passed in favour of the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017 -8-\n\npetitioner.\"\n\n8. The order dated 28.03.2008 would reveal that the petitioner\n\npressed only the issue of the confirmation of her services after the\n\ncompletion of the probation period of two years but the other reliefs were\n\nnot pressed or raised before this Court, therefore, a direction was given\n\nto the State authorities to consider the claim of the petitioner with regard\n\nto probation only and the same was rejected by the authority vide order\n\ndated 26.06.2008.\n\n9. The petitioner was entitled to get a promotion in the year 2005 as\n\nper the pleading made in the present petition and thereafter in the year\n\n2013. With regard to promotion in the year 2005 as claimed by the\n\npetitioner, the petition is time-barred. Service-related claims cannot be\n\nraised after the lapse of an inordinate period as held by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the catena of judgments.\n\n10. There are certain observations in the note-sheet but no specific\n\norder was issued by any of the authorities in favour of the petitioner,\n\ntherefore, the note-sheet would not confer any right in favour of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n11. With regard to delay in claiming seniority and promotion, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of\nChennai Metropolitan Water\n\nSupply and Sewerage Board and Others Vs. T.T. Murali Babu\n\nreported in (2014) 4 SCC 108 held as under:-\n\n'17. In the case at hand, though there has been four\nyears' delay in approaching the court, yet the writ court\nchose not to address the same. It is the duty of the court\nto scrutinize whether such enormous delay is to be\nignored without any justification. That apart, in the\npresent case, such belated approach gains more\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017\nsignificance as the respondent employee being\nabsolutely careless to his duty and nurturing a\nlackadaisical attitude to the responsibility had remain\nunauthorizedly absent on the pretext of some kind of ill\nhealth. We repeat at the cost of repetition that remaining\ninnocuously oblivious to such delay does not foster the\ncause of justice. On the contrary, it brings in injustice, for\nit is likely to affect others. Such delay may have impact\non others' ripened rights and may unnecessarily drag\nothers into litigation which in acceptable realm of\nprobability, may have been treated to have attained\nfinality. A court is not expected to give indulgence to such\nindolent persons -who compete with \"Kumbhakarna\" or\nfor that matter \"Rip Van Winkle\" . In our considered\nopinion, such delay does not deserve any indulgence and\non the said ground alone the writ court should have\nthrown the petition overboard at the very threshold.\n\n12. Recently, the Apex Court in the matter of\nRushibhai\n\nJagdishbhai Pathak Vs. Bhavnagar Municipal Corporation\nreported\n\nin 2022 SCC Online SC 64 held as under:-\n\n'9. The doctrine of delay and laches, or for that matter\nstatutes of limitation, are considered to be statutes of\nrepose and statutes of peace, though some contrary\nopinions have been expressed (in Nav Rattanmal Vs.\nstate of Rajasthan, AIR 1961 SC 1704). The courts have\nexpressed the view that the law of limitation rests on the\nfoundations of greater public interest for three reasons,\nnamely, (a) that long dormant claims have more of cruelty\nthan justice in them; (b) that a defendant might have lost\nthe evidence to disapprove a stale claim; and (iii) that\npersons with good causes of action (who are able to\nenforce them) should pursue them with reasonable\ndiligence (\nState of Kerala Vs. V.R. Kalliyanikutty\n, (1999) 3\nSCC 657 relying on Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn.,\nVol. 28, para 605; Halsbury's Laws of England , Vol. 68\n(2021) para 1005. Equally, change in de facto position or\ncharacter, creation of third party rights over a period of\ntime, waiver, acquiesce, and need to ensure certitude in\ndealings, are equitable public policy considerations why\nperiod of limitation is prescribed by law. Law of limitation\ndoes not apply to writ petitions, albeit the discretion\nvested with a constitutional court is exercised with caution\nas delay and laches principle is applied with the aim to\nsecure the quiet of the community, suppress fraud and\nperjury, quicken diligence, and prevent oppression.\n(see\n\nPopat and Kotecha Property Vs. State Bank of India Staff\nAssociation\n(2005) 7 SCC 510).Therefore, some decisions\nand judgments do not look upon pleas of delay and laches\nwith favour, especially and rightly in cases where the\npersons suffer from adeptness, or incapacity to approach\nthe courts for relief. However, other decisions, while\naccepting the rules of limitation as well as delay and\nlaches, have observed that such rules are not meant to\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017 -10-\n\ndestroy the rights of the parties but serve a larger public\ninterest and are founded on public policy. There must be a\nlifespan during which a person must approach the court\nfor their remedy. Otherwise, there would be unending\nuncertainty as to the rights and obligations of the parties.\n(See\nN. Blarkrishnan Vs. M. Krishnamurthy\n, (1998)7 SCC\n\n123. Referring to the principle of delay and laches, this\nCourt, way back in Moons Mils Ltd Vs. M.R. Mehar,\nPresident, Industrial Court, Bombay AIR 1967 SC 1450,\nhad referred to the view expressed by Sir Barnes Peacock\nin The Lindsay Petroleum Company and Prosper\nArmstrong Hurd, Abram Farewell, and John Kemp, (L.R.)\n5 P.C.221 in the following words:\n\n\" Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an\narbitrary or a technical doctrine, Where it would be\npractically unjust to give a remedy, either because the\nparty has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be\nregarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by this\nconduct and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving\nthat remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it\nwould not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were\nafterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse\nof time and delay are most material. But in every case,if an\nargument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is\nfounded upon mere delay, that delay of course not\namounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity\nof that defence must be tried upon principles substantially\nequitable. Two circumstances, always important in such\ncases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of the\nacts done during the interval, which might affect either\nparty and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking\nthe one course or the other, so far as relates to the\nremedy.\"\n\n13. The law with regard to waiver and acquiescence is no more res\n\nintegra. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of\nBichitrananda\n\nBehera Vs. State of Orissa and others\nreported in 2023 Livelaw (SC)\n\n883 under relevant para 21 held as under:-\n\n\"21. Profitably, we may reproduce relevant passages from\ncertain decisions of this Court:\n\n(\nA) Union of India v Tarsem Singh\n, (2008) 8 SCC 648:\n\n\"To summarise, normally, a belated service related claim\nwill be rejected on the ground of delay and laches (where\nremedy is sought by filing a writ petition) or limitation\n(where remedy is sought by an application to the\nAdministrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions to the said\nrule is cases relating to a continuing wrong. Where a\nservice related claim is based on a continuing wrong, relief\ncan be granted even if there is a long delay in seeking\nremedy, with reference to the date on which the continuing\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017\nwrong commenced, if such continuing wrong creates a\ncontinuing source of injury. But there is an exception to the\nexception. If the grievance is in respect of any order or\nadministrative decision which related to or affected several\nothers also, and if the reopening of the issue would affect\nthe settled rights of third parties, then the claim will not be\nentertained. For example, if the issue relates to payment or\nrefixation of pay or pension, relief may be granted in spite\nof delay as it does not affect the rights of third parties. But if\nthe claim involved issues relating to seniority or promotion,\netc., affecting others, delay would render the claim stale\nand doctrine of laches/limitation will be applied. Insofar as\nthe consequential relief of recovery of arrears for a past\nperiod is concerned, the principles relating to\nrecurring/successive wrongs will apply. As a consequence,\nthe High Courts will restrict the consequential relief relating\nto arrears normally to a period of three years prior to the\ndate of filing of the writ petition.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n(B) Union of India v N Murugesan, (2022) 2 SCC 25:\n\n\"Delay, laches and acquiescence\n\n20. The principles governing delay, laches, and\nacquiescence are overlapping and interconnected on many\noccasions. However, they have their distinct characters and\ndistinct elements. One can say that delay is the genus to\nwhich laches and acquiescence are species. Similarly,\nlaches might be called a genus to a species by name\nacquiescence. However, there may be a case where\nacquiescence is involved, but not laches. These principles\nare common law principles, and perhaps one could identify\nthat these principles find place in various statutes which\nrestrict the period of limitation and create non consideration\nof condonation in certain circumstances. They are bound to\nbe applied by way of practice requiring prudence of the\ncourt than of a strict application of law. The underlying\nprinciple governing these concepts would be one of\nestoppel. The question of prejudice is also an important\nissue to be taken note of by the court.\n\nLaches\n\n21. The word \"laches\" is derived from the French language\nmeaning \"remissness and slackness\". It thus involves\nunreasonable delay or negligence in pursuing a claim\ninvolving an equitable relief while causing prejudice to the\nother party. It is neglect on the part of a party to do an act\nwhich law requires while asserting a right, and therefore,\nmust stand in the way of the party getting relief or remedy.\n\n22. Two essential factors to be seen are the length of the\ndelay and the nature of acts done during the interval. As\nstated, it would also involve acquiescence on the part of the\nparty approaching the court apart from the change in\nposition in the interregnum. Therefore, it would be\nunjustifiable for a Court of Equity to confer a remedy on a\nparty who knocks its doors when his acts would indicate a\nwaiver of such a right. By his conduct, he has put the other\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017 -12-\n\nparty in a particular position, and therefore, it would be\nunreasonable to facilitate a challenge before the court.\nThus, a man responsible for his conduct on equity is not\nexpected to be allowed to avail a remedy.\n\n23. A defence of laches can only be allowed when there is\nno statutory bar. The question as to whether there exists a\nclear case of laches on the part of a person seeking a\nremedy is one of fact and so also that of prejudice. The said\nprinciple may not have any application when the existence\nof fraud is pleaded and proved by the other side. To\ndetermine the difference between the concept of laches and\nacquiescence is that, in a case involving mere laches, the\nprinciple of estoppel would apply to all the defences that are\navailable to a party. Therefore, a defendant can succeed on\nthe various grounds raised by the plaintiff, while an issue\nconcerned alone would be amenable to acquiescence.\nAcquiescence\n\n24. We have already discussed the relationship between\nacquiescence on the one hand and delay and laches on the\nother.\n\n25. Acquiescence would mean a tacit or passive\nacceptance. It is implied and reluctant consent to an act. In\nother words, such an action would qualify a passive assent.\nThus, when acquiescence takes place, it presupposes\nknowledge against a particular act. From the knowledge\ncomes passive acceptance, therefore instead of taking any\naction against any alleged refusal to perform the original\ncontract, despite adequate knowledge of its terms, and\ninstead being allowed to continue by consciously ignoring it\nand thereafter proceeding further, acquiescence does take\nplace. As a consequence, it reintroduces a new implied\nagreement between the parties. Once such a situation\narises, it is not open to the party that acquiesced itself to\ninsist upon the compliance of the original terms. Hence,\nwhat is essential, is the conduct of the parties. We only dealt\nwith the distinction involving a mere acquiescence. When\nacquiescence is followed by delay, it may become laches.\nHere again, we are inclined to hold that the concept of\nacquiescence is to be seen on a case-to-case basis.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n(C) Chairman, State Bank of India v M J James, (2022) 2\nSCC 301:\n\n\"36. What is a reasonable time is not to be put in a\nstraitjacket formula or judicially codified in the form of days,\netc. as it depends upon the facts and circumstances of each\ncase. A right not exercised for a long time is nonexistent.\nDoctrine of delay and laches as well as acquiescence are\napplied to non-suit the litigants who approach the\ncourt/appellate authorities belatedly without any justifiable\nexplanation for bringing action after unreasonable delay. In\nthe present case, challenge to the order of dismissal from\nservice by way of appeal was after four years and five\nmonths, which is certainly highly belated and beyond\njustifiable time. Without satisfactory explanation justifying the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017\ndelay, it is difficult to hold that the appeal was preferred\nwithin a reasonable time. Pertinently, the challenge was\nprimarily on the ground that the respondent was not allowed\nto be represented by a representative of his choice. The\nrespondent knew that even if he were to succeed on this\nground, as has happened in the writ proceedings, fresh\ninquiry would not be prohibited as finality is not attached\nunless there is a legal or statutory bar, an aspect which has\nbeen also noticed in the impugned judgment. This is\nhighlighted to show the prejudice caused to the appellants by\nthe delayed challenge. We would, subsequently, examine\nthe question of acquiescence and its judicial effect in the\ncontext of the present case.\n\nXxx\n\n38.\nIn\nRam Chand v. Union of India [Ram Chand\nv. Union of\nIndia, (1994) 1 SCC 44] and State of U.P. v. Manohar [State\nof U.P. v. Manohar, (2005) 2 SCC 126] this Court observed\nthat if the statutory authority has not performed its duty within\na reasonable time, it cannot justify the same by taking the\nplea that the person who has been deprived of his rights has\nnot approached the appropriate forum for relief. If a statutory\nauthority does not pass any orders and thereby fails to\ncomply with the statutory mandate within reasonable time,\nthey normally should not be permitted to take the defence of\nlaches and delay.\n\nIf at all, in such cases, the delay furnishes\na cause of action, which in some cases as elucidated in\n\nUnion of India v. Tarsem Singh [Union of India\nv. Tarsem\nSingh, (2008) 8 SCC 648 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 765] may be\ncontinuing cause of action.The State being a virtuous litigant\nshould meet the genuine claims and not deny them for want\nof action on their part. However, this general principle would\nnot apply when, on consideration of the facts, the court\nconcludes that the respondent had abandoned his rights,\nwhich may be either express or implied from his conduct.\n\nAbandonment implies intentional act to acknowledge, as has\nbeen held in para 6 of Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd.\nv. State of U.P. [Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v.\nState of U.P., (1979) 2 SCC 409 : 1979 SCC (Tax) 144]\nApplying this principle of acquiescence to the precept of\ndelay and laches, this Court in U.P. Jal Nigam v.Jaswant\n\nSingh [U.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant Singh\n, (2006) 11 SCC 464 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 500] after referring to several judgments,\nhas accepted the following elucidation in Halsbury's Laws of\nEngland : (\nJaswant Singh\ncase [\nU.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant\nSingh\n, (2006) 11 SCC 464 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 500] , SCC\npp. 470-71, paras 1213)\n\"12. The statement of law has also been summarised in\nHalsbury's Laws of England, Para 911,p. 395 as follows:\n\n'In determining whether there has been such delay as to\namount to laches, the chief points to be considered are:\n\n(i) acquiescence on the claimant's part;and\n\n(ii) any change of position that has occurred on the\ndefendant's part.\n\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017 -14-\n\nAcquiescence in this sense does not mean standing by while\nthe violation of a right is in progress,but assent after the\nviolation has been completed and the claimant has become\naware of it. It is unjust to give the claimant a remedy where,\nby his conduct, he has done that which might fairly be\nregarded as equivalent to a waiver of it; or where by his\nconduct and neglect, though not waiving the remedy, he has\nput the other party in a position in which it would not be\nreasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be\nasserted. In such cases lapse of time and delay are most\nmaterial. Upon these considerations rests the doctrine of\nlaches.'\n\n13. In view of the statement of law as summarised above, the\nrespondents are guilty since the respondents have\nacquiesced in accepting the retirement and did not challenge\nthe same in time. If they would have been vigilant enough,\nthey could have filed writ petitions as others did in the matter.\nTherefore, whenever it appears that the claimants lost time or\nwhiled it away and did not rise to the occasion in time for filing\nthe writ petitions, then in such cases, the court should be very\nslow in granting the relief to the incumbent. Secondly, it has\nalso to be taken into consideration the question of\nacquiescence or waiver on the part of the incumbent whether\nother parties are going to be prejudiced if the relief is granted.\nIn the present case, if the respondents would have challenged\ntheir retirement being violative of the provisions of the Act,\nperhaps the Nigam could have taken appropriate steps to\nraise funds so as to meet the liability but by not asserting their\nrights the respondents have allowed time to pass and after a\nlapse of couple of years, they have filed writ petitions claiming\nthe benefit for two years. That will definitely require the Nigam\nto raise funds which is going to have serious financial\nrepercussions on the financial management of the Nigam.\nWhy should the court come to the rescue of such persons\nwhen they themselves are guilty of waiver and\nacquiescence?\"\n\n39. Before proceeding further, it is important to clarify\ndistinction between \"acquiescence\" and \"delay and laches\".\n\nDoctrine of acquiescence is an equitable doctrine which\napplies when a party having a right stands by and sees\nanother dealing in a manner inconsistent with that right, while\nthe act is in progress and after violation is completed, which\nconduct reflects his assent or accord. He cannot afterwards\ncomplain. [See\nPrabhakar v. Sericulture Deptt.\n, (2015) 15 SCC\n1 : (2016) 2 SCC (L&S) 149.\n\nAlso, see\nGobinda Ramanuj Das\nMohanta v. Ram Charan Das\n, 1925 SCC OnLine Cal 30 : AIR\n1925 Cal 1107] In literal sense, the term acquiescence means\nsilent assent, tacit consent, concurrence, or acceptance, [See\n\nVidyavathi Kapoor Trust v. CIT\n, 1991 SCC OnLine Kar 331 :\n\n(1992) 194 ITR 584] which denotes conduct that is evidence\nof an intention of a party to abandon an equitable right and\nalso to denote conduct from which another party will be\njustified in inferring such an intention. [See Krishan Dev v.\n\nRam Piari, 1964 SCC OnLine HP 5 : AIR 1964 HP 34]\nAcquiescence can be either direct with full knowledge and\nexpress approbation, or indirect where a person having the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:25017\nright to set aside the action stands by and sees another\ndealing in a manner inconsistent with that right and in spite of\nthe infringement takes no action mirroring acceptance. [See\n\"Introduction\", U.N. Mitra, Tagore Law Lectures -- Law of\nLimitation and Prescription, Vol. I, 14th Edn., 2016.] However,\nacquiescence will not apply if lapse of time is of no importance\nor consequence.\n\n40. Laches unlike limitation is flexible. However, both limitation\nand laches destroy the remedy but not the right. Laches like\nacquiescence is based upon equitable considerations, but\nlaches unlike acquiescence imports even simple passivity. On\nthe other hand, acquiescence implies active assent and is\nbased upon the rule of estoppel in pais. As a form of estoppel,\nit bars a party afterwards from complaining of the violation of\nthe right.\nEven indirect acquiescence implies almost active\nconsent, which is not to be inferred by mere silence or inaction\nwhich is involved in laches. Acquiescence in this manner is\nquite distinct from delay. Acquiescence virtually destroys the\nright of the person. [See\nVidyavathi Kapoor Trust v. CIT\n, 1991\nSCC OnLine Kar 331 : (1992) 194 ITR 584] Given the\naforesaid legal position, inactive acquiescence on the part of\nthe respondent can be inferred till the filing of the appeal, and\nnot for the period post filing of the appeal. Nevertheless, this\nacquiescence being in the nature of estoppel bars the\nrespondent from claiming violation of the right of fair\nrepresentation.\"\n\n14. Admittedly, the petitioner has not challenged the initial order\n\npassed by the respondents dated 26.06.2008 and in the earlier round of\n\nlitigation, she did not press the issue of promotion, seniority and grant of\n\narrears of salary, therefore, in this petition, she cannot be permitted to\n\nraise those reliefs which were sought in the earlier writ petition.\n\n15. Taking into consideration the above-stated facts and the law\nlaid\n\ndown by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matters of\nChennai\n\nMetropolitan Water Supply\n(supra),\nRushibhai Jagdishbhai Pathak\n\n(supra) and\nBichitrananda Behera\n(supra), no case is made out for\n\ninterference. Consequently, the present petition fails and is hereby\n\ndismissed. No cost(s). Sd/-\n\n(Rakesh Mohan Pandey)\nJudge\nRekha",
