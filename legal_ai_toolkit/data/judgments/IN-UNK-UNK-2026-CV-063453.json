MANINDRA MOHAN SHRIVASTAVA\n (Through V.C.)\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (2 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n Order\nReportable\n\n Pronounced on: 25/04/2024\n\n 1. Applicant has filed this application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the\n\n Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the\n\n Act of 1996') for appointment of an arbitrator in the matter of alleged\n\n dispute between the parties to a contract providing for adjudication of\n\n disputes through the process of arbitration.\n\n 2. As pleaded by the applicant, M/s. Verma & Company, 214, Jaipur\n\n Road, Ajmer is a registered firm under the provisions of \nIndian\n\n Partnership Act, 1932\n (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1932').\n\n After the death of one of the two partners namely; Dinesh Kumar\n\n Verma, his son Akshay Verma was admitted as partner w.e.f.\n\n 24.12.2013 and new partnership was constituted which came into\n\n existence vide partnership deed executed on 24.12.2013 between\n\n Sita Devi Verma and Akshay Verma, which is duly signed by each of\n\n them. Clause-9 of the partnership deed provided that all the disputes\n\n shall be settled by the arbitration according to the provisions of the\n\n Act of 1996.\n\n 3. On 14.03.2022, one of the partners Sita Devi Verma addressed\n\n a communication to the Branch Manager, Bank of Baroda stating\n\n therein that the accounts in the name of the firm be stopped/closed\n\n and she also informed that she had executed a Power of Attorney in\n\n the name of her son-in-law Atul Karel. The Branch Manager of the\n\n Bank informed the other partner Akshay Verma regrading letter of\n\n Sita Devi Verma for freezing of the accounts of the firm. On\n\n 21.03.2022, Akshay Verma replied that the firm had been a very old\n\n customer of the bank, therefore, no action or cognizance should be\n\n taken on the basis of the communication sent by the other partner\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (3 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nSita Devi Verma. This was followed by another communication dated\n\n26.03.2022 through the advocate repeating request not to initiate any\n\naction or take cognizance of the communication sent to the bank by\n\nSita Devi Verma. Sita Devi Verma again sent a letter on 21.04.2022\n\nto the Branch Manager of the bank with a request to restart overdraft\n\naccount of the firm in the name of M/s. Verma & Company.\n\n It is further averred that Akshay Verma had submitted an\n\naffidavit stating therein that misunderstanding between the parties\n\nhad been cleared and, therefore, consent was given to operate the\n\noverdraft account. It was also stated in the application that Sita Devi\n\nVerma vide communication dated 29.06.2022, addressed to the\n\nMarketing Division, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., stated that she was an\n\nilliterate lady of 89 years, thus, she had forwarded the nomination of\n\nher daughter Shakuntala Karel for partnership. In the meanwhile,\n\nSita Devi Verma expired on 12.07.2022.\n\n4. In the aforesaid background, Bank of Baroda sent a legal notice\n\non 04.08.2022 to the firm M/s. Verma & Company, Akshay Verma,\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma and legal\n\nrepresentatives of deceased Rajendar Verma for execution of\n\nnecessary documents in favour of the firm by reconstituting the firm\n\nor repay outstanding amount of Rs.1,75,33,186/- along with interest\n\nand other expenses, failing which appropriate legal action would be\n\ntaken.\n\n5. As dispute had already arisen between applicant-Akshay Verma\n\nand Sita Devi Verma (since deceased), the applicant requested the\n\nnon-applicants, i.e., legal representatives of deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma to settle the dispute, but despite repeated requests, non-\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (4 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\napplicants have not taken any step for settlement, therefore,\n\napplication has been filed for appointment of an arbitrator.\n\n6. By filing reply to the application, the legal representative of\n\ndeceased Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma, daughter of\n\ndeceased partner Sita Devi Verma, while denying all the allegations,\n\nopposed the application as misconceived and not maintainable. In\n\nreply, it has been stated that present is not a case of any financial\n\ndispute or any other kind of dispute between the partners of the firm\n\nas one of the partners had died. Legal representatives of Sita Devi\n\nVerma are being pressurized to become partners. As they are not\n\npartners either by operation of law or the act of parties, the dispute, if\n\nany, cannot be said to be a dispute between the partners of the firm.\n\nThe terms of the partnership deed regarding appointment of an\n\narbitrator in case of dispute have no legal existence as the\n\npartnership itself stands dissolved on account of death of one of the\n\ntwo partners. Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma is not even a\n\npartner in the firm, nor has ever been associated with the firm. She\n\ncannot be forced to enter into a contract or become a partner in the\n\nfirm against her will, therefore, there is no dispute between the\n\nparties to a contract containing an arbitration clause. The applicant\n\nhas no cause of action against Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma,\n\nwho is nowhere concerned with day-to-day operation of the\n\npartnership firm. Once one of the partners out of the two partners of\n\na partnership firm dies, the firm stands automatically dissolved under\n\nthe law and there is no partnership in existence. The partnership\n\ndeed, as existed between the applicant and deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma, did not have any clause that upon death of one of the\n\npartners, the legal representatives of the deceased shall be inducted\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (5 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nas partners in the firm. Therefore, there is no automatic induction of\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma in the partnership\n\nfirm, as existed between the applicant and Sita Devi Verma, while\n\nSita Devi Verma was alive. The arbitration clause in the partnership\n\ndeed between applicant-Akshay Verma and Sita Devi Verma can no\n\nlonger be invoked against legal representative of deceased Smt. Sita\n\nDevi Verma. Answering Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma,\n\ndaughter of Sita Devi Verma was neither a partner, nor has\n\nconstituted any new partnership with applicant-Akshay Verma, nor\n\nshe has any intention of getting inducted as partner. The applicant is\n\nforcing the answering Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma to enter\n\ninto a partnership firm and forestall recovery of bank dues by\n\nliquidating security in the form of equitable mortgage of a residential\n\nproperty. It is further stated that not only Sita Devi Verma gave her\n\nconsent while she was alive, to the bank to liquidate the security and\n\nrecover the amount due, but later on Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala\n\nVerma has also given similar consent. The consent also states that if\n\nexcess money realises, the same be given to Respondent No.1/1-\n\nShakuntala Verma. As the liability of the firm was increasing day by\n\nday due to overdraft facility, Sita Devi Verma wrote to the bank to\n\nstop overdraft facility.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the applicant would submit that\n\nnotwithstanding death of one of the partners Sita Devi Verma, dispute\n\nwhich existed as between the applicant, one of the partners in the\n\nfirm, with the deceased partner, is an arbitrable dispute in view of\n\narbitration clause contained in the partnership deed between the\n\napplicant and deceased Sita Devi Verma. Even after death of Sita Devi\n\nVerma, the dispute between the partners of the firm may be referred\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (6 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nto arbitration as the legal representative of deceased partner Smt.\n\nSita Devi Verma represents the estate of the deceased, which is a\n\nsecured asset against loan advanced by the bank to the firm. He\n\nwould further submit that vide communication dated 29.06.2022, Sita\n\nDevi Verma had forwarded nomination of her daughter Shakuntala\n\n(Respondent No.1/1) to the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. in respect of\n\ndealership of M/s Verma & Company. He would further submit that\n\ndeath of one of the partners does not necessarily follow that the firm\n\nis also dissolved. Dissolution of firm in such a contingency subject to\n\ncontract between the parties and intention to continue business in\n\npartnership with legal representatives may be gathered from the\n\ncontract of the parties. He would further submit that the rule that the\n\npartnership would be dissolved by the death of one of the partners, is\n\nsubject to a contract between the parties, which may be expressed or\n\nimplied. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, share of\n\ndeceased partner in assets including goodwill devolves upon his/her\n\nlegal representatives, therefore, the dispute is clearly arbitrable and\n\nan arbitrator may be appointed to adjudicate the dispute between the\n\napplicant and the legal representative of the deceased partner.\n\n8. Per-contra, leaned counsel appearing for the respondents would\n\nsubmit that the partnership firm in the name of M/s Verma &\n\nCompany consisted of only two partners namely; the applicant and\n\ndeceased Sita Devi Verma. Though partnership deed as between the\n\napplicant and deceased Sita Devi Verma contained an arbitration\n\nclause to the effect that the dispute shall be referred to arbitrator\n\nunder the Act of 1996, upon death of one of the two partners, the\n\nfirm stood automatically dissolved by operation of law. Neither before\n\ndeath of Sita Devi Verma, Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma was\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (7 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\ninducted as partner in the then existed firm, nor thereafter, any new\n\npartnership firm had been reconstituted between applicant-Akshay\n\nVerma and Shakuntala Verma, or any other legal representatives of\n\ndeceased Sita Devi Verma. There is no agreement between the\n\nparties, i.e., between the applicant and Shakuntala Verma, or other\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma to resolve their\n\ndispute through the process of arbitration. The agreement between\n\napplicant-Akshay Verma and Sita Devi Verma to resolve their dispute\n\nthrough the process of arbitration attained its natural demise upon\n\ndeath of Sita Devi Verma on account of automatic dissolution of the\n\npartnership firm. The said agreement cannot be enforced against the\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma. Even if it is\n\nassumed, though not admitted that there existed a dispute between\n\npresent applicant-Akshay Verma with the legal representatives of\n\ndeceased Sita Devi Verma, insofar as liquidation of secured assets\n\ntowards realisation of the bank loan and respective claims qua the\n\nsecured assets and in the absence of there being any agreement, to\n\nrefer the dispute through the process of arbitration as between the\n\npresent applicant and the legal representatives of deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma, no recourse could be availed to arbitration proceeding at the\n\ninstance of the applicant. Leaned counsel for the respondents would\n\nfurther submit that even if it is assumed that Sita Devi Verma, when\n\nshe was alive, had sent a letter to the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. on\n\n29.06.2022 expressing her intention to induct non-applicant\n\nRespondent No. 1/1 namely; Shakuntala Verma as one of the\n\npartners, the fact remains that Shakuntala Verma was never inducted\n\nas partner in the firm during life time of Sita Devi Verma. It is not the\n\ncase of the applicant that after death of Sita Devi Verma, a new\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (8 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\npartnership had been constituted between present applicant- Akshy\n\nVerma and Shakuntala Verma, the daughter of deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma. Therefore, it is contended, the dispute is non arbitrable.\n\n9. The non-applicants, opposing the application for reference of\n\ndispute by appointing an arbitrator, has denied existence of an\n\nagreement between the parties mainly on the ground that upon death\n\nof one of the partners, the partnership firm stood dissolved and there\n\nexists no agreement between the parties containing a clause that in\n\nthe event of any dispute between the parties, it shall be referred to\n\narbitration. Secondly, respondents have raised an issue regarding non\n\narbitrability of the dispute sought to be raised by the applicant.\n\nTherefore, the two aforesaid issues are required to be decided before\n\ngranting applicant's application.\n\n10. Before I deal with the factual aspects of the case, it is apposite\n\nto refer to recent judicial pronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt both on the aspects of existence of arbitration agreement and\n\nnon-arbitrability of the dispute.\n\n11. A Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nVidya Drolia & Others Versus Durga Trading Corporation,\n\n(2021) 2 Supreme Court Cases 1, while deciding a reference made\n\nto it, has examined in great details the legal position with regard to\n\nscope of judicial review at the referral stage both on the aspects of\n\nexistence of agreement and non arbitrability. Navigating through\n\nvarious provisions of the Act of 1996, amendments made from time\n\nto time and survey of earlier decisions dealing with the aforesaid\n\naspects, the Hon'ble Supreme Court examined legal position as\n\nbelow:-\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (9 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n \"26. Questions as to the existence of an arbitration\n agreement also arise when a party opposing the reference\n raises plea of novation of contract by entering into a new\n contract in substitution of the original or 'accord and\n satisfaction' by acceptance of modified obligations in\n discharge of the contract by performance or simple\n termination by express or implied consent. Similar plea of\n discharge can be raised opposing an application for\n reference on the ground that the claim is long barred and\n dead or there are no outstanding disputes as the parties\n have accepted part performance or have absolved the other\n side from performance, fully or partly, on account of\n frustration or otherwise. The contention is that once the\n original contract stands extinguished, abandoned,\n repudiated or substituted, the arbitration clause in the\n underlying/original contract perishes with it.\n\n 27. ................\n\n 31. We are clearly bound by the dictum of the\n Constitutional Bench judgment in Patel Engineering Ltd. that\n the scope and ambit of court's jurisdiction under \nSections 8\n\n or 11 of the \nArbitration Act\n is similar. An application under\n \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act need not set out in detail\n the disputes or the claims and may briefly refer to the\n subject matter or broad contours of the dispute. However,\n where judicial proceedings are initiated and pending,\n specific details of the claims and disputes are normally\n pleaded and, therefore, the court or the judicial authority\n has the advantage of these details. There is a difference\n between a non-arbitrable claim and non-arbitrable subject\n matter. Former may arise on account of scope of the\n arbitration agreement and also when the claim is not\n capable of being resolved through arbitration. Generally\n non-arbitrability of the subject matter would relate to non-\n\n \narbitrability in law. Further, the decision in Sukanya\n Holdings (P) Ltd. has to be read along with subsequent\n judgment of this Court in \nChloro Controls India Private\n Limited v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc.\n (2013) 1\n SCC 641.\n\n 32. ............\n\n 71. Complexity is not sufficient to ward off arbitration. In\n terms of the mandate of Section 89 of the Civil Procedure\n Code and the object and purpose behind the \nArbitration Act\n\n and the mandatory language of \nSections 8\n and \n11\n, the\n mutually agreed arbitration clauses must be enforced. The\n language of \nSections 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act are\n peremptory in nature. \nArbitration Act\n has been enacted to\n promote arbitration as a transparent, fair, and just\n alternative to court adjudication. Public policy is to\n encourage and strengthen arbitration to resolve and settle\n economic, commercial and civil disputes. Amendments from\n time to time have addressed the issues and corrected the\n inadequacies and flaws in the arbitration procedure. It is for\n the stakeholders, including the arbitrators, to assure that\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (10 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n the arbitration is as impartial, just, and fair as court\n adjudication. It is also the duty of the courts at the post-\n award stage to selectively yet effectively exercise the\n limited jurisdiction, within the four corners of \nSection 34(2)\n\n (b)(ii) read with Explanations 1 and 2 and check any conflict\n with the fundamental policy of the applicable law. We would\n subsequently refer to the 'second look' principle which is\n applicable in three specific situations dealing with\n arbitrability as per the mandate of \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act.\n\n 72. Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada in TELUS\n Communications Inc. v. Avraham Wellman, (2019) SCC 19\n while conceding that arbitration as a method of dispute\n resolution was met with \"overt hostility\" for a long time on\n public policy grounds as it ousts jurisdiction of courts,\n observed that the new legislation, the \nArbitration Act\n of\n 1991, marks a departure as it encourages parties to adopt\n arbitration in commercial and other matters. By putting\n party autonomy on a high pedestal, the Act mandates that\n the parties to a valid arbitration agreement must abide by\n the consensual and agreed mode of dispute resolution. The\n courts must show due respect to arbitration agreements\n particularly in commercial settings by staying the court\n proceedings, unless the legislative language is to the\n contrary. The principle of party autonomy goes hand in\n hand with the principle of limited court intervention, this\n being the fundamental principle underlying modern\n arbitration law. Party autonomy is weaker in non-negotiated\n \"take it or leave it\" contracts and, therefore, the legislature\n can through statutes shield the weakest and vulnerable\n contracting parties like consumers. This is not so in\n negotiated agreements or even in adhesion contracts having\n an arbitration clause in commercial settings. Virtues of\n commercial and civil arbitration have been recognised and\n accepted and the courts even encourage the use of\n arbitration.\n\n 73 ...............\n\n 76. In view of the above discussion, we would like to\n propound a four-fold test for determining when the subject\n matter of a dispute in an arbitration agreement is not\n arbitrable:\n\n 76.1 (1) when cause of action and subject matter of the\n dispute relates to actions in rem, that do not pertain to\n subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in\n rem.\n\n 76.2 (2) when cause of action and subject matter of the\n dispute affects third party rights; have erga omnes effect;\n\n require centralized adjudication, and mutual adjudication\n would not be appropriate and enforceable.\n\n 76.3 (3) when cause of action and subject matter of the\n dispute relates to inalienable sovereign and public interest\n functions of the State and hence mutual adjudication would\n be unenforceable.\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (11 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n 76.4 (4) when the subject-matter of the dispute is expressly\n or by necessary implication non-arbitrable as per mandatory\n statute(s).\n\n 76.5 These tests are not watertight compartments; they\n dovetail and overlap, albeit when applied holistically and\n pragmatically will help and assist in determining and\n ascertaining with great degree of certainty when as per law\n in India, a dispute or subject matter is non-arbitrable. Only\n when the answer is affirmative that the subject matter of\n the dispute would be non-arbitrable.\n\n 76.6. However, the aforesaid principles have to be applied\n with care and caution as observed in Olympus\n Superstructures (P) Ltd.: (SCC p.669, para 35)\n \"35...Reference is made there to certain disputes\n like criminal offences of a public nature, disputes\n arising out of illegal agreements and disputes\n relating to status, such as divorce, which cannot be\n referred to arbitration. It has, however, been held\n that if in respect of fats relating to a criminal matter,\n say, physical injury, if there is a right to damages\n for personal injury, then such a dispute can be\n referred to arbitration (Keir v. Leeman). \nSimilarly, it\n has been held that a husband and a wife may refer\n to arbitration the terms on which they shall\n separate, because they can make a valid agreement\n between themselves on that matter (Soilleux v.\n Herbst, \nWilson v. Wilson\n and Cahill v. Cahill).\"\n\n 77. Applying the above principles to determine non-\n arbitrability, it is apparent that insolvency or intracompany\n disputes have to be addressed by a centralized forum, be\n the court or a special forum, which would be more efficient\n and has complete jurisdiction to efficaciously and fully\n dispose of the entire matter. They are also actions in rem.\n Similarly, grant and issue of patents and registration of\n trademarks are exclusive matters falling within the\n sovereign or government functions and have erga omnes\n effect. Such grants confer monopoly rights. They are non-\n arbitrable. Criminal cases again are not arbitrable as they\n relate to sovereign functions of the State. Further,\n violations of criminal law are offenses against the State and\n not just against the victim. Matrimonial disputes relating to\n the dissolution of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights\n etc. are not arbitrable as they fall within the ambit of\n sovereign functions and do not have any commercial and\n economic value. The decisions have erga omnes effect.\n Matters relating to probate, testamentary matter etc. are\n actions in rem and are a declaration to the world at large\n and hence are non-arbitrable.\n\n 78. ............\n\n 82. Issue of non-arbitrability can be raised at three\n stages. First, before the court on an application for\n reference under \nSection 11\n or for stay of pending judicial\n proceedings and reference under \nSection 8\n of the\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (12 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n \nArbitration Act\n; secondly, before the arbitral tribunal during\n the course of the arbitration proceedings; or thirdly, before\n the court at the stage of the challenge to the award or its\n enforcement. Therefore, the question - 'Who decides non-\n arbitrability?' and, in particular, the jurisdiction of the court\n at the first look stage, that is, the referral stage.\n\n 83. .............\n\n 84. \nUnder the Arbitration Act, 1940\n, the jurisdiction to\n settle and decide non-arbitrability issues relating to\n existence, validity, scope as well as whether the subject\n matter was capable of arbitration, with possible exception\n in case of termination, novation, frustration and 'accord\n and satisfaction' when contested on facts, was determined\n and decided at the first or at the reference stage by the\n courts. The principle being that the court should be\n satisfied about the existence of a valid arbitration\n agreement and that the disputes have arisen with regard to\n the subject matter of the arbitration agreement. At this\n stage, the court would be, however, not concerned with the\n merits or sustainability of the disputes. Despite best efforts\n to contain obstructive tactics, adjudication and final\n decision of non-arbitrability issues at the reference stage\n would invariably stop, derail and thwart the proceedings in\n the courts for years.\n\n 85. ...............\n\n \n103. On the ambit of the Court's jurisdiction at the\n reference stage, it was observed in \nShin-Etsu Chemical Co.\n Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd. and Another\n (2005) 7 SCC 234\n that the correct approach to the review of the arbitration\n agreement would be restricted to prima facie finding that\n there exists an arbitration agreement that is not null and\n void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. The key\n rationale for holding that the courts' review of the\n arbitration agreement should be limited to a prima facie\n standard is the principle of competence- competence.\n Further, were the courts are to be empowered to fully\n scrutinize the arbitration agreement an arbitral proceeding\n would have to be stayed until such time that the court\n seized of the matter renders a decision on the arbitration\n agreement. If the finding of the courts would be a final and\n determinative conclusion, then it is obvious that, until such\n a pronouncement is made, the arbitral proceedings would\n have to hang in abeyance. This evidently would defeat the\n credo and ethos of the \nArbitration Act\n, which is to enable\n expeditious arbitration without avoidable intervention by\n the judicial authorities. As a result, the approach to be\n adopted at the reference stage is whether it is 'plainly\n arguable' that the arbitration agreement is in existence.\n The judgment laid emphasis on the fact that the rule of\n priority in favour of the arbitrators is counter-balanced by\n the courts' power to review the existence and validity of\n the arbitration agreement at the end of the arbitral\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (13 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n process.\n \nIt was elucidated: (\nShin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd\n,\n Supra).\n\n \"74..... Even if the court takes the view that the\n arbitral agreement is not vitiated or that it is not\n invalid, inoperative or unenforceable, based upon\n purely a prima facie view, nothing prevents the\n arbitrator from trying the issue fully and rendering a\n final decision thereupon ....\n\n 75..... Even after the court takes a prima facie view\n that the arbitration agreement is not vitiated on\n account of factors enumerated in \nSection 45\n, and the\n arbitrator upon a full trial holds that there is no\n vitiating factor in the arbitration agreement and\n makes an award, such an award can be challenged\n under \nSection 48(1)(a)\n. The award will be set aside if\n the party against whom it is invoked satisfies the\n court inter alia that the agreement was not valid\n under the law to which the parties had subjected it or\n under the law of the country where the award was\n made. The two basic requirements, namely,\n expedition at the pre-reference stage, and a fair\n opportunity to contest the award after full trial,\n would be fully satisfied by the interpreting \nSection 45\n\n as enabling the court to act on a prima facie view.\n\n * * *\n\n 105. ..... [T]he object of the Act would be defeated if\n the proceedings remain pending in the court even\n after commencing of the arbitration. It is precisely\n for this reason that I am inclined to the view that at\n the pre-reference stage contemplated by \nSection 45\n,\n the court is required to take only a prima facie view\n for making the reference, leaving the parties to a full\n trial either before the Arbitral Tribunal or before the\n court at the post-award stage.\"\n\n 104. ...........\n\n \n132. The courts at the referral stage do not perform\n ministerial functions. They exercise and perform judicial\n functions when they decide objections in terms of \nSections\n 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act. \nSection 8\n prescribes the\n courts to refer the parties to arbitration, if the action\n brought is the subject of an arbitration agreement, unless it\n finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists.\n Examining the term 'prima facie', in \nNirmala J. Jhala v.\n State of Gujarat\n, (2013) 4 SCC 301, this Court had noted:\n\n (SCC p.320, para 48)\n \"48. '27.... A prima facie case does not mean a case\n proved to the hilt but a case which can be said to be\n established if the evidence which is led in support of\n the case were [to be] believed. While determining\n whether a prima facie case had been made out or not\n the relevant consideration is whether on the evidence\n led it was possible to arrive at the conclusion in\n question and not whether that was the only\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (14 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n conclusion which could be arrived at on that\n evidence.' \"\n\n 133. Prima facie case in the context of \nSection 8\n is not to\n be confused with the merits of the case put up by the\n parties which has to be established before the arbitral\n tribunal. It is restricted to the subject matter of the suit\n being prima facie arbitrable under a valid arbitration\n agreement. Prima facie case means that the assertions on\n these aspects are bona fide. When read with the principles\n of separation and competence-competence and \nSection 34\n\n of the Arbitration Act, the referral court without getting\n bogged-down would compel the parties to abide unless\n there are good and substantial reasons to the contrary.\n\n \n134. Prima facie examination is not full review but a\n primary first review to weed out manifestly and ex facie\n non-existent and invalid arbitration agreements and non-\n arbitrable disputes. The prima facie review at the reference\n stage is to cut the deadwood and trim off the side branches\n in straight forward cases where dismissal is barefaced and\n pellucid and when on the facts and law the litigation must\n stop at the first stage. Only when the court is certain that\n no valid arbitration agreement exists or the\n disputes/subject matter are not arbitrable, the application\n under \nSection 8\n would be rejected. At this stage, the court\n should not get lost in thickets and decide debatable\n questions of facts. Referral proceedings are preliminary and\n summary and not a mini trial. This necessarily reflects on\n the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the court and in\n this context, the observations of B.N. Srikrishna, J. of\n \"plainly arguable\" case in \nShin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd.\n\n (Supra) are of importance and relevance.\n \nSimilar views are\n expressed by this Court in \nVimal Kishor Shah v. Jayesh\n Dinesh Shah\n (2016) 8 SCC 788 wherein the test applied at\n the pre-arbitration stage was whether there is a \"good\n arguable case\" for the existence of an arbitration\n agreement.\n\n 135. ..........\n\n 139. We would not like be too prescriptive, albeit observe\n that the court may for legitimate reasons, to prevent\n wastage of public and private resources, can exercise\n judicial discretion to conduct an intense yet summary prima\n facie review while remaining conscious that it is to assist\n the arbitration procedure and not usurp jurisdiction of the\n arbitral tribunal. Undertaking a detailed full review or a\n long-drawn review at the referral stage would obstruct and\n cause delay undermining the integrity and efficacy of\n arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. Conversely,\n if the court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may\n undermine effectiveness of both the arbitration and the\n court. There are certain cases where the prima facie\n examination may require a deeper consideration. The\n court's challenge is to find the right amount of and the\n context when it would examine the prima facie case or\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (15 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n exercise restraint. The legal order needs a right balance\n between avoiding arbitration obstructing tactics at referral\n stage and protecting parties from being forced to arbitrate\n when the matter is clearly non-arbitrable.\n\n 140. ............\n\n 143. We would now examine \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration\n Act. As noticed above sub-section (6-A) was inserted by\n the Act 3 of 2016 with retrospective effect from 23-10-\n 2015 and omitted by Act 33 of 2019. \nSection 11 (6)\n\n requires the court to appoint an arbitrator on an application\n made by a party. Section (6-A) to \nSection 11\n stipulates\n that the court shall, at the stage of appointment under sub-\n sections (4), (5) or (6), confine itself to the examination of\n the existence of an arbitration agreement. Sub-section (6-\n A) was omitted by Act 33 of 2019, but the omission is in\n view of the introduction of a new regime of institutionalised\n arbitration as per the report of the committee headed by\n Justice B. N. Srikrishna, dated 30-07-2017 which records\n for the reason of recommending the omission as:\n\n \"Thus, it can be seen that after the Amendment Act of\n 2019, \nSection 11\n (6-A) has been omitted because\n appointment of arbitrators is to be done\n institutionally, in which case the Supreme Court or\n the High Court under the old statutory regime are no\n longer required to appoint arbitrators and\n consequently to determine whether an arbitration\n agreement exists.\"\n\n 144. As observed earlier, SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering\n Ltd. (2005) 8 SCC 618 explains and holds that \nSections 8\n\n and \n11\n are complementary in nature as both relate to\n reference to arbitration. \nSection 8\n applies when judicial\n proceeding is pending and an application is filed for stay of\n judicial proceeding and for reference to arbitration.\n Amendments to \nSection 8\n vide Act 3 of 2016 have not been\n omitted. \nSection 11\n covers the situation where the parties\n approach a court for appointment of an arbitrator. \nMayavati\n Trading Private Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman\n, (2019) 8\n SCC 714 in our humble opinion, rightly holds that Patel\n Engineering Ltd. (Supra) has been legislatively overruled\n and hence would not apply even post omission of Sub-\n section (6-A) to \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act.\n \nMayavati\n Trading Private Ltd.\n (Supra) has elaborated upon the object\n and purposes and history of the amendment to \nSection 11\n,\n with reference to Sub-section (6-A) to elucidate that the\n Section, as originally enacted, was facsimile with \nArticle 11\n\n of the UNCITRAL Model of law of arbitration on which the\n \nArbitration Act\n was drafted and enacted. Referring to the\n legislative scheme of \nSection 11\n, different interpretations,\n and the Law Commission's Reports, it has been held that\n the omitted Sub-section (6-A) to \nSection 11\n of the\n Arbitration Act would continue to apply and guide the\n courts on its scope of jurisdiction at stage one, that is, the\n pre-arbitration stage.\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (16 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n 145. Omission of Sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was\n with the specific object and purpose and is relatable to by\n substitution of Sub-sections (12), (13) and (14) to \nSection\n 11\n of the Arbitration Act by Act 33 of 2019, which, vide\n Sub-section (3A) stipulates that the High Court and this\n court shall have the power to designate the arbitral\n institutions which have been so graded by the Council\n under Section 43-I, provided where a graded arbitral\n institution is not available, the concerned High Court shall\n maintain a panel of arbitrators for discharging the function\n and thereupon the High Court shall perform the duty of an\n arbitral institution for reference to the arbitral tribunal.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to accept that post omission\n of Sub-section (6-A) to \nSection 11\n the ratio in Patel\n Engineering Ltd. (Supra) would become applicable.\n\n 146. We now proceed to examine the question, whether\n the word 'existence' in \nSection 11\n merely refers to contract\n formation (whether there is an arbitration agreement) and\n excludes the question of enforcement (validity) and\n therefore the latter falls outside the jurisdiction of the court\n at the referral stage. On jurisprudentially and textualism it\n is possible to differentiate between existence of an\n arbitration agreement and validity of an arbitration\n agreement. Such interpretation can draw support from the\n plain meaning of the word \"existence'. However, it is\n equally possible, jurisprudentially and on contextualism, to\n hold that an agreement has no existence if it is not\n enforceable and not binding. Existence of an arbitration\n agreement presupposes a valid agreement which would be\n enforced by the court by relegating the parties to\n arbitration. Legalistic and plain meaning interpretation\n would be contrary to the contextual background including\n the definition clause and would result in unpalatable\n consequences. A reasonable and just interpretation of\n 'existence' requires understanding the context, the purpose\n and the relevant legal norms applicable for a binding and\n enforceable arbitration agreement. An agreement\n evidenced in writing has no meaning unless the parties can\n be compelled to adhere and abide by the terms. A party\n cannot sue and claim rights based on an unenforceable\n document. Thus, there are good reasons to hold that an\n arbitration agreement exists only when it is valid and legal.\n A void and unenforceable understanding is no agreement to\n do anything. Existence of an arbitration agreement means\n an arbitration agreement that meets and satisfies the\n statutory requirements of both the Arbitration Act and the\n Contract Act and when it is enforceable in law.\n\n 147. We would proceed to elaborate and give further\n reasons:\n\n 147.1. \nIn \nGarware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine\n Constructions & Engg. Ltd.\n (2019) 9 SCC 209, this Court\n had examined the question of stamp duty in an underlying\n contract with an arbitration clause and in the context had\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (17 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n drawn a distinction between the first and second part of\n \nSection 7(2)\n of the Arbitration Act, albeit the observations\n made and quoted above with reference to 'existence' and\n 'validity' of the arbitration agreement being apposite and\n extremely important, we would repeat the same by\n reproducing para 29 thereof: (SCC p.238)\n \"29. This judgment in United India Insurance Co.\n\n \nLtd. v. Hyundai Engg. & Constructions Co. Ltd.\n\n (2018) 17 SCC 607 is important in that what was\n specifically under consideration was an arbitration\n clause which would get activated only if an insurer\n admits or accepts liability. Since on facts it was\n found that the insurer repudiated the claim, though\n an arbitration clause did \"exist\", so to speak, in the\n policy, it would not exist in law, as was held in that\n judgment, when one important fact is introduced,\n namely, that the insurer has not admitted or\n accepted liability. Likewise, in the facts of the\n present case, it is clear that the arbitration clause\n that is contained in the sub-contract would not\n \"exist\" as a matter of law until the sub-contract is\n duly stamped, as has been held by us above.\n \nThe\n argument that \nSection 11\n(6-A) deals with\n \"existence\", as opposed to \nSection 8\n, \nSection 16\n and\n \nSection 45\n, which deal with \"validity\" of an\n arbitration agreement is answered by this Court's\n understanding of the expression \"existence\" in\n \nUnited India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Hyundai Engg. &\n Construction Co. Ltd., (Supra\n), as followed by us.\"\n Existence and validity are intertwined, and arbitration\n agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy\n mandatory legal requirements. Invalid agreement is no\n agreement.\n\n 147.2. The court at the reference stage exercises judicial\n powers. 'Examination', as an ordinary expression in\n common parlance, refers to an act of looking or considering\n something carefully in order to discover something (as per\n Cambridge Dictionary). It requires the person to inspect\n closely, to test the condition of, or to inquire into carefully\n (as per Merriam-Webster Dictionary). It would be rather\n odd for the court to hold and say that the arbitration\n agreement exists, though ex facie and manifestly the\n arbitration agreement is invalid in law and the dispute in\n question is non-arbitrable. The court is not powerless and\n would not act beyond jurisdiction, if it rejects an application\n for reference, when the arbitration clause is admittedly or\n without doubt is with a minor, lunatic or the only claim\n seeks a probate of a will.\n\n 147.3. Most scholars and jurists accept and agree that the\n existence and validity of an arbitration agreement are the\n same. Even Starvos Brekoulakis accepts that validity, in\n terms of substantive and formal validity, are questions of\n contract and hence for the court to examine.\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (18 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n 147.4. Most jurisdictions accept and require prima facie\n review by the court on non-arbitrability aspects at the\n referral stage.\n\n 147.5. \nSections 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act are\n complementary provisions as was held in Patel Engineering\n Ltd.(Supra). The object and purpose behind the two\n provisions is identical to compel and force parties to abide\n by their contractual understanding. This being so, the two\n provisions should be read as laying down similar standard\n and not as laying down different and separate parameters.\n \nSection 11\n does not prescribe any standard of judicial\n review by the court for determining whether an arbitration\n agreement is in existence. \nSection 8\n states that the judicial\n review at the stage of reference is prima facie and not final.\n Prima facie standard equally applies when the power of\n judicial review is exercised by the court under \nSection 11\n of\n the Arbitration Act. Therefore, we can read the mandate of\n valid arbitration agreement in \nSection 8\n into mandate of\n \nSection 11\n, that is, 'existence of an arbitration agreement'.\n 147.6. Exercise of power of prima facie judicial review of\n existence as including validity is justified as a court is the\n first forum that examines and decides the request for the\n referral. Absolute \"hands off\" approach would be\n counterproductive and harm arbitration, as an alternative\n dispute resolution mechanism. Limited, yet effective\n intervention is acceptable as it does not obstruct but\n effectuates arbitration.\n\n 147.7. Exercise of the limited prima facie review does not\n in any way interfere with the principle of competence-\n competence and separation as to obstruct arbitration\n proceedings but ensures that vexatious and frivolous\n matters get over at the initial stage.\n\n 147.8. Exercise of prima facie power of judicial review as to\n the validity of the arbitration agreement would save costs\n and check harassment of objecting parties when there is\n clearly no justification and a good reason not to accept plea\n of non-arbitrability. \nIn \nSubrata Roy Sahara v. Union of\n India\n, (2014) 8 SCC 470, this Court has observed: (SCC\n p.642, para 191)\n \"191. The Indian judicial system is grossly afflicted\n with frivolous litigation. Ways and means need to be\n evolved to deter litigants from their compulsive\n obsession towards senseless and ill-considered claims.\n One needs to keep in mind that in the process of\n litigation, there is an innocent sufferer on the other\n side of every irresponsible and senseless claim. He\n suffers long-drawn anxious periods of nervousness and\n restlessness, whilst the litigation is pending without\n any fault on his part. He pays for the litigation from\n out of his savings (or out of his borrowings) worrying\n that the other side may trick him into defeat for no\n fault of his. He spends invaluable time briefing counsel\n and preparing them for his claim. Time which he\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (19 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n should have spent at work, or with his family, is lost,\n for no fault of his. Should a litigant not be\n compensated for what he has lost for no fault? The\n suggestion to the legislature is that a litigant who has\n succeeded must be compensated by the one who has\n lost. The suggestion to the legislature is to formulate a\n mechanism that anyone who initiates and continues a\n litigation senselessly pays for the same. It is\n suggested that the legislature should consider the\n introduction of a \"Code of Compulsory Costs\".\"\n\n147.9 Even in \nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n\n (2017) 9 SCC 729, Kurian Joseph, J., in para 52, had\n referred to \nSection 7(5)\n and thereafter in para 53 referred\n to a judgment of this Court in \nM.R. Engineers and\n Contractors (P) Limited v. Som Datt Builders Limited\n,\n (2009) 7 SCC 696 to observe that the analysis in the said\n case supports the final conclusion that the Memorandum of\n Understanding in the said case did not incorporate an\n arbitration clause.\n \nThereafter, reference was specifically\n made to SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd. (Supra) and\n \nNational Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Limited\n\n (2009) 1 SCC 267 to observe that the legislative policy is\n essential to minimise court's interference at the pre-arbitral\n stage and this was the intention of sub-section (6) to\n \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act.\n \nParagraph 48 in \nDuro\n Felguera, S.A.\n (Supra) specifically states that the resolution\n has to exist in the arbitration agreement, and it is for the\n court to see if the agreement contains a clause which\n provides for arbitration of disputes which have arisen\n between the parties. Para 59 is more restrictive and\n requires the court to see whether an arbitration agreement\n exists - nothing more, nothing less. Read with the other\n findings, it would be appropriate to read the two\n paragraphs as laying down the legal ratio that the court is\n required to see if the underlying contract contains an\n arbitration clause for arbitration of the disputes which have\n arisen between the parties - nothing more, nothing less.\n\nReference to decisions in Patel Engineering Ltd. (Supra)\n and \nBoghara Polyfab Private Limited\n (Supra) was to\n highlight that at the reference stage, post the amendments\n vide Act 3 of 2016, the court would not go into and finally\n decide different aspects that were highlighted in the two\n decisions.\n\n 147.10. \nIn addition to \nGarware Wall Ropes Ltd.\n (Supra),\n this Court in \nOriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Narbheram\n Power & Steel (P) Ltd.\n (2018) 6 \nSCC 534 and Hyundai\n Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd.\n (Supra), both decisions of\n three Judges, has rejected the application for reference in\n the insurance contracts holding that the claim was beyond\n and not covered by the arbitration agreement.\n \nThe court\n felt that the legal position was beyond doubt as the scope\n of the arbitration clause was fully covered by the dictum in\n \nVulcan Insurance Co. Ltd v. Maharaj Singh\n (1976) 1 SCC\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (20 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n \n943. Similarly, in M/s. PSA Mumbai Investments PTE.\n \nLimited v. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust\n, (2018) 10 SCC 525,\n this Court at the referral stage came to the conclusion that\n the arbitration clause would not be applicable and govern\n the disputes. Accordingly, the reference to the arbitral\n tribunal was set aside leaving the respondent to pursue its\n claim before an appropriate forum.\n\n 147.11. The interpretation appropriately balances the\n allocation of the decision-making authority between the\n court at the referral stage and the arbitrators' primary\n jurisdiction to decide disputes on merits. The court as the\n judicial forum of the first instance can exercise prima facie\n test jurisdiction to screen and knockdown ex facie\n meritless, frivolous and dishonest litigation. Limited\n jurisdiction of the courts ensures expeditious, alacritous\n and efficient disposal when required at the referral stage.\n\n 148. ............\n\n 153. Accordingly, we hold that the expression 'existence of\n an arbitration agreement' in \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration\n Act, would include aspect of validity of an arbitration\n agreement, albeit the court at the referral stage would\n apply the prima facie test on the basis of principles set out\n in this judgment. In cases of debatable and disputable\n facts, and good reasonable arguable case, etc., the court\n would force the parties to abide by the arbitration\n agreement as the arbitral tribunal has primary jurisdiction\n and authority to decide the disputes including the question\n of jurisdiction and non-arbitrability.\n\n 154. Discussion under the heading \"Who decides\n Arbitrability?\" can be crystallized as under:\n\n 154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engineering Ltd.\n\n (Supra) on the scope of judicial review by the court while\n deciding an application under \nSections 8\n or 11 of the\n \nArbitration Act\n, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016\n (with retrospective effect from 23-10-2015) and even post\n the amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from 09-\n 08-2019), is no longer applicable.\n\n 154.2. Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the court\n under \nSection 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act is identical\n but extremely limited and restricted.\n\n 154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the\n legislative mandate clear from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of\n 2019, and the principle of severability and competence-\n competence, is that the arbitral tribunal is the preferred\n first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-\n arbitrability. The court has been conferred power of\n \"second look\" on aspects of non-arbitrability post the award\n in terms of sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of \nSection 34(2)(a)\n\n or sub-clause (i) of \nSection 34(2)(b)\n of the Arbitration Act.\n 154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at the\n \nSections 8\n or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie\n certain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent,\n invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (21 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n nature and facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent,\n determine the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The\n restricted and limited review is to check and protect parties\n from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\n demonstrably 'non-arbitrable' and to cut off the deadwood.\n The court by default would refer the matter when\n contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly\n arguable; when consideration in summary proceedings\n would be insufficient and inconclusive; when facts are\n contested; when the party opposing arbitration adopts\n delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration\n proceedings. This is not the stage for the court to enter into\n a mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the\n jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal but to affirm and uphold\n integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative\n dispute resolution mechanism.\"\n\n In the case of Indian Oil Corporation Limited Versus NCC\n\nLimited, (2023) 2 Supreme Court Cases 539, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, after survey of its earlier judicial pronouncements,\n\nparticularly the decision in the case of Vidya Drolia & Others\n\n(Supra), observed as below:-\n\n \"73. \nIn the recent decision of this Court in \nDLF Home\n Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd\n (2021) 16 SCC\n\n 743) in which this Court also had an occasion to consider\n \nSection 11\n(6-\nA) of the Arbitration Act\n and ultimately has\n observed, after referring to and considering the decision of\n the three-Judge Bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia (supra)\n that the jurisdiction of the Court under \nSection 11\n of the\n Arbitration Act is primarily to find out whether there existed\n a written agreement between the parties for resolution of\n the dispute and whether the aggrieved party has made out\n a prima facie arguable case, it is further observed that\n limited jurisdiction, however, does not denude the Court of\n its judicial function to look beyond the bare existence of an\n arbitration clause to cut the deadwood. In the said decision,\n this Court had taken note of the observations made in the\n case of Vidya Drolia (supra) that with a view to prevent\n wastage of public and private resources, the Court may\n conduct 'prima facie review' at the stage of reference to\n weed out any frivolous or vexatious claims.\"\n\n 12. In another decision in the case of NTPC Limited Versus\n\n SPML Infra Limited, (2023) 9 Supreme Court Cases 385,\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the legal position with\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (22 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n regard to the non-arbitrability of the dispute. It was explained\n\n by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as below:-\n\n \"Position of Law\n\n 16. In the present case, we are concerned with the pre-\n referral jurisdiction of the High Court under \nSection 11\n of\n the Act and would like to underscore the limited scope\n within which an application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the\n Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has to be considered.\n\n 17. The position of law with respect to the pre-referral\n jurisdiction, as it existed before the advent of \nSection 11\n(6-\n \nA) in the Act\n, was based on a well-articulated principle\n formulated by this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v.\n\n \nBoghara Polyfab (P) Ltd (2009) 1 SCC 267. In Boghara\n Polyfab, this Court held that the issue of non-arbitrability of\n a dispute will have to be examined by the Court in cases\n where accord and discharge of the contract is alleged.\n Following the principle in Boghara Polyfab, this Court in\n \nUnion of India v. Master Construction Co.\n (2011) 12 SCC\n 349 observed that when the validity of a discharge\n voucher, no-claim certificate or a settlement agreement is\n in dispute, the Court must prima facie examine the\n credibility of the allegations before referring the parties to\n arbitration.\n \nYet again in \nNew India Assurance Co. Ltd. v.\n Genus Power Infrastructure Ltd.\n (2015) 2 SCC 424, this\n Court observed that allegations of fraud, coercion, duress\n or undue influence must be prima facie substantiated\n through evidence by the party raising the allegations.\n\n 18. In a legislative response to these precedents, through\n the \nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act\n 2015,\n sub-section (6-A) was added to \nSection 11\n of the Act,\n which reads as follows:\n\n 11. (6-A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may\n be, the High Court, while considering any application\n under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-\n\n section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment,\n decree or order of any Court, confine to the\n examination of the existence of an arbitration\n agreement.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 19. Taking cognizance of the legislative change, this Court\n in Duro Felguera, SA Versus Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017)\n 9 SCC 729 noted that post the 2015 Amendments, the\n jurisdiction of the Court under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act is\n limited to examining whether an arbitration agreement\n exists between the parties-\"nothing more, nothing less\"\n\n \n20. However, in the year 2019, in \nUnited India Insurance\n Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd.\n (2019) 5 SCC 362,\n this Court had nevertheless accepted an objection of\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (23 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n \"accord and satisfaction\" in opposition to an application for\n reference to arbitration.\n\n \n21. It did not take much time for this Court to reverse the\n approach in \nAntique Art Exports (P) Ltd.\n (Supra).\n \nA three-\n Judge Bench in Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. Versus Pradyuat\n Deb Burman (2019) 8 SCC 714 expressly overruled the\n abovereferred decision in Antique Art Exports, observing\n that: (\nMayavati Trading\n case, SCC pp. 724-25, Para-10)\n\n \n\"10. This being the position, it is clear that the law\n prior to the 2015 Amendment that has been \nlaid down\n by\n this Court, which would have included going into\n whether accord and satisfaction has taken place, has\n now been legislatively overruled. This being the\n position, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning\n contained in the aforesaid judgment, as \nSection 11\n(6-\n A) is confined to the examination of the existence of an\n arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the\n narrow sense as has been \nlaid down in\n the judgment in\n Duro Felguera, SA.\"\n\n (emphasis in original)\n\n Having navigated through various judicial pronouncements\n\n and the common thread of prima-facie test, it was\n\n authoritatively held as below:-\n\n \"24. Following the general rule and the principle \nlaid down\n in\n Vidya Drolia (Supra) this Court has consistently been\n holding that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first\n authority to determine and decide all questions of non-\n arbitrability. In Pravin Electricals (P). \nLtd. v. Galaxy Infra\n and Engg. (P\n).\n \nLtd. (2021) 5 SCC 671, Sanjiv Prakash v.\n Seema Kukreja\n (\n2021) 9 SCC 732 and Indian Oil\n Corporation Ltd. v. NCC Ltd\n (2023) 2 SCC 539., the parties\n were referred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in\n each of these cases on the objection of non-arbitrability\n was found to be inconclusive.\n Following the exception to\n the general principle that the Court may not refer parties to\n arbitration when it is clear that the case is manifestly and\n ex facie non-arbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India)\n (P) Ltd. (2021) 5 SCC 738 (hereinafter \"Nortel Networks\")\n and Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B.\n Ramachandraiah & Sons (2021) 5 SCC 705, arbitration was\n refused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably\n time-barred.\n\n Eye of the needle\n\n 25. The above-referred precedents crystallise the position\n of law that the pre-referral jurisdiction of the courts under\n \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act is very narrow and inheres two\n inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and\n the validity of an arbitration agreement, which also\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (24 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n includes an inquiry as to the parties to the agreement and\n the applicant's privity to the said agreement. These are\n matters which require a thorough examination by the\n referral court. The secondary inquiry that may arise at the\n reference stage itself is with respect to the non-arbitrability\n of the dispute.\n\n 26. As a general rule and a principle, the arbitral Tribunal is\n the preferred first authority to determine and decide all\n questions of non-arbitrability. As an exception to the rule,\n and rarely as a demurrer, the Referral Court may reject\n claims which are manifestly and ex-facie non-arbitrable.\n Explaining this position, flowing from the principles laid\n down in Vidya Drolia & Others (supra), this Court in a\n subsequent decision in Nortel Networks (Supra) held:\n\n (Nortel Networks case, SCC p.764, para 45)\n \"45. ..45.1. ... While exercising jurisdiction under\n \nSection 11\n as the judicial forum, the court may exercise\n the prima facie test to screen and knockdown ex facie\n meritless, frivolous, and dishonest litigation. Limited\n jurisdiction of the courts would ensure expeditious and\n efficient disposal at the referral stage. At the referral\n stage, the Court can interfere \"only\" when it is\n \"manifest\" that the claims are ex facie time-barred and\n dead, or there is no subsisting dispute.\"\n\n 27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-\n arbitrability of a claim is only prima facie. Referral courts\n must not undertake a full review of the contested facts;\n they must only be confined to a primary first review and let\n facts speak for themselves. This also requires the Courts to\n examine whether the assertion on arbitrability is bona fide\n or not. The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead to a\n clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt\n that the claim is non-arbitrable. On the other hand, even if\n there is the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute\n to arbitration.\"\n\n 13. In yet another recent judicial pronouncement in the case of\n\n Magic Eye Developers Private Limited Versus M/s. Green\n\n Edge Infrastructure Private Limited & Others, (2023) 8\n\n Supreme Court Cases 50, following pertinent observations\n\n were made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court:-\n\n \"8. While considering the aforesaid issue, \nSection 11\n(6-\nA)\n of the Arbitration Act\n which has been added through the\n \nArbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act, 2015\n is\n required to be read, which reads as follows:\n\n \"11. (6-A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may\n be, the High Court, while considering any application\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (25 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-\n section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment,\n decree or order of any court, confine to the\n examination of the existence of an arbitration\n agreement\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 9. Thus, post \nArbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act,\n 2015\n, the jurisdiction of the court under \nSection 11(6)\n of\n the Act is limited to examining whether an arbitration\n agreement exists between the parties- \"nothing more,\n nothing less\". Thus, as per \nSection 11\n(6-\nA) of the Act\n, it is\n the duty cast upon the Referral Court to consider the\n dispute/issue with respect to the existence of an arbitration\n agreement.\n\n 10. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the\n settled position of law, pre-referral jurisdiction of the court\n under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act is very narrow\n and inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the\n existence and the validity of an arbitration agreement,\n which also includes an inquiry as to the parties to the\n agreement and the applicant's privity to the said\n agreement. The said matter requires a thorough\n examination by the Referral Court. (para 25 of the decision\n in NTPC). The Secondary inquiry that may arise at the\n reference stage itself is with respect to the non-arbitrability\n of the dispute. Both are different and distinct.\"\n\n 14. Keeping in forefront the above settled legal position with\n\n regard to existence of an arbitration agreement, non-\n\n arbitrability and the scope of judicial review at the referral\n\n stage while dealing with the application under \nSection 11 (6)\n of\n\n the Act of 1996 seeking appointment of an arbitrator, I shall\n\n now deal with the issues raised in the present application.\n\n 15. The pleadings of the parties reveal an admitted position to\n\n the effect that M/s Verma & Company was a registered firm\n\n under the Act of 1932 and after the death of one of the two\n\n partners namely; Dinesh Kumar Verma, his son Akshay Verma\n\n (applicant herein) was admitted as partner w.e.f. 24.12.2013\n\n and new partnership was constituted which came into existence\n\n vide partnership deed executed on 24.12.2013 between Sita\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (26 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n Devi Verma and Akshay Verma, which is duly signed by each of\n\n them. It is not in dispute that Clause-9 of the partnership deed\n\n provided that all the disputes shall be settled by the arbitration\n\n according to the provisions of the Act of 1996. Clause-9 of the\n\n Partnership deed reads as under:-\n\n \"9. All disputes shall be settled by arbitration according\n to the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act.\"\n\n 16. However, a dispute arose when Sita Devi Verma addressed\n\n a communication to the Bank on 14.03.2022 requesting closer\n\n of the accounts in the name of the firm. When Bank informed\n\n the other partner Akshay Verma regrading request of Sita Devi\n\n Verma for freezing of the accounts of the firm, the other\n\n partner requested the bank not to proceed with the request. It\n\n is also the case of the applicant that later on Sita Devi Verma\n\n sent a letter on 21.04.2022 to the Branch Manager of the bank\n\n with a request to restart overdraft account of the firm followed\n\n by a letter of applicant-Akshay Verma that misunderstanding\n\n between the parties has been cleared. In the meanwhile, Sita\n\n Devi Verma expired on 12.07.2022. The bank, however, sent a\n\n legal notice on 04.08.2022 to the firm M/s. Verma & Company,\n\n Akshay Verma, legal representatives of deceased Sita Devi\n\n Verma and legal representatives of deceased Rajendar Verma\n\n for execution of necessary documents in favour of the bank by\n\n reconstituting the firm or repay outstanding amount of\n\n Rs.1,75,33,186/- along with interest and other expenses, failing\n\n which appropriate legal action would be taken.\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (27 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n 17. A legal issue, therefore, which arises for consideration is\n\n as to whether the firm stood dissolved, there being only two\n\n partners and one partner having died.\n\n The legal position in this regard was examined by the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mohd. Laiquiddin &\n\n Anr. Versus Kamla Devi Mishra (Dead) By L.Rs & Ors.\n\n (2010) 2 Supreme Court Cases 407. One of the issues\n\n which arose for consideration was whether the partnership firm\n\n stood dissolved by virtue of \nSection 42(c)\n of the Act of 1932 on\n\n account of the death of one of the partners, on facts, that being\n\n a case where partnership consisted of only two partners and\n\n one of them died.\n\n 18. In the light of the provisions contained in \nSection 42\n of\n\n the Act of 1932 and despite there being a clause in the\n\n partnership deed to keep the same alive despite death of any\n\n partner, legal position was examined as below:-\n\n \"22. The sole issue raised by the Respondents in this\n appeal, who are the appellants in Appeal No. 4411-12 of\n 2002, is whether the finding of the Courts below that the\n Partnership firm stood dissolved on account of death of\n one of the partners was correct in the light of the express\n provisions of the \nPartnership Act\n, namely, \nSection 42 (c)\n\n of the same.\n\n 23. Before we proceed to examine the correctness of this\n concurrent findings arrived at by the Courts below, it is\n necessary to examine the relevant provisions of the\n \nPartnership Act, 1923\n and the relevant clauses of the\n partnership deed entered between the original plaintiff and\n the original defendant. \"Partnership\" is defined under\n \nSection 4\n of the Act which reads as under:\n\n \"4. Definition of 'partnership', 'partner', 'firm' and\n 'firm name.- \"Partnership is the relation between\n persons who have agreed to share the profits of a\n business carried on by all or any of them acting for\n all.\"\n\n 24. \nSection 42\n of the Act reads as under:\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (28 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n \"42. Dissolution on the happening of certain\n contingencies:- Subject to contract between the\n partners a firm is dissolved-\n\n (a) if constituted for a fixed term, by the\n expiry of the term;\n\n (b) if constituted to carry out one or more\n adventures or undertakings, by the\n completion thereof;\n (c) by the death of a partner; and\n (d) by the adjudication of a partner as an\n insolvent.\"\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 25. Dissolution of a partnership firm on account of death\n of one of the partners is subject to the contract entered\n into by the parties. In this context, it is pertinent to refer\n to the terms of the deed of partnership. Clause 22 of the\n Partnership deed reads as follows:\n\n \"The partnership shall be in force for a period of\n 42 years certain from this date and the death of any\n partner shall not have the effect of dissolving the\n firm.\"\n\n This clause clearly states that death of any partner shall\n not have the effect of dissolving the firm. However, in the\n facts and circumstances of the case, we are not in a\n position to give absolute effect to this clause of the deed of\n partnership.\n\n 26. The learned counsel for the Respondents contended\n that since the parties agreed that in spite of the death of\n any of the partners, the firm shall continue for 42 years\n irrespective of the death of the original plaintiff (since\n deceased). They further, argued that it clearly\n contemplates that the legal representative of the partner,\n who dies, would be under a duty to enter into a fresh deed\n of partnership. The legal representatives were precluded\n from claiming benefits if they deny entering into a fresh\n partnership agreement.\n\n 27. \nIn order to arrive at the conclusion that the\n partnership firm stood dissolved on account of death of\n one of the partners, the High Court had rightly placed\n reliance on \nSmt. S. Parvathammal v. CIT\n (1987) 163 ITR\n 161 (Mad.), wherein this Court held that in a firm\n consisting of two partners on account of death of one of\n the partners, the firm automatically dissolved and\n observed as follows: (ITR pp.161-62)\n \".... a partnership normally dissolves on the death of\n the partner unless there was an agreement in the\n original partnership deed. Even assuming that there\n was such an agreement in a partnership consisting of\n two partners, on the death of one of them the\n partnership automatically comes to an end and there\n is no partnership which survives and into which a third\n party can be introduced. Hence on the death of S, the\n original partnership was dissolved. The subsequent\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (29 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n taking in of the assessee as a partner was only as a\n result of entering into of a new partnership between R\n and the assessee. Partnership was not a matter of\n heritable status but purely one of contract.\"\n In the light of aforementioned case, it is clear that when\n there are only two partners constituting the partnership\n firm, on the death of one of them, the firm is deemed to\n be dissolved despite the existence of a clause which says\n otherwise. A partnership is a contract between the\n partners. There cannot be any contract unilaterally without\n the acceptance by the other partner.\n\n 28. The Appellants, the legal representatives of original\n plaintiff (since deceased) was not at all interested in\n continuing the firm or constitute a fresh firm and they\n cannot be asked to continue the partnership, as there is no\n legal obligation upon them to do so as partnership is not a\n matter of heritable status but purely one of contract,\n which is also clear from the definition of partnership under\n \nSection 4\n. Therefore, the trial court was justified in holding\n that the firm dissolved by virtue of death of one of the\n partners and the first appellate court as well as the High\n Court have taken the correct view in upholding the same.\"\n\n 19. In view of the aforesaid decision, the legal position is\n\n crystal clear that irrespective of any clause in the partnership\n\n deed between the two partners, to keep alive the partnership\n\n even after death of one of the partners, upon death of one of the\n\n partners, the partnership stands dissolved by operation of law.\n\n 20. However, the crucial question for determination would be\n\n whether despite dissolution of the firm, the arbitration clause\n\n contained in the partnership deed would still survive and binding\n\n on the legal representatives of the deceased partner, for the\n\n purposes of the Act of 1996. The legal position in this regard is\n\n fully explained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ravi\n\n Prakash Goel Versus Chandra Prakash Goel & Another,\n\n (2008) 13 Supreme Court Cases 667. The issues which arose\n\n for consideration and answered, were as below:-\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (30 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n \"16. On the above pleadings, the following questions of law\n emerge for our consideration:\n\n (a) Where right to sue for rendition of accounts survives\n on the legal legal representative of a deceased partner,\n are the legal representatives not entitled to invoke\n arbitration clause contained in the Partnership Deed?\n\n (b) Whether the arbitration can be commenced by the\n heirs after the death of partner especially where the\n dispute had arisen already during the life time of the\n partner?\n\n (c) Whether in view of \nsection 46\n read with \nsection 48\n of\n the Indian Partnership Act as well as \nsection 40\n of the\n Arbitration Act, 1999, the petitioner is entitled to claim\n appointment of arbitrator under the arbitration clause of\n the Partnership Deed and the Hon'ble Chief Justice of the\n Allahabad High Court has erred in overlooking these\n provisions?\"\n\n The legal position with reference to provisions contained\n\n both in the Act of 1932 and the Act of 1996 was examined by the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court which reads as below:-\n\n \"17. Before we proceed further, it is useful to reproduce\n \nSection 40\n of the Arbitration Act and \nSections 46\n, \n47\n and \n48\n\n of the Indian Partnership Act:\n\n \"40. Arbitration agreement not to be discharged by death\n of party thereto.- (1) An arbitration agreement shall not\n be discharged by the death of any party thereto either as\n respects the deceased or as respects any other party, but\n shall in such event be enforceable by or against the legal\n representative of the deceased.\n\n (2) The mandate of an arbitrator shall not be terminated\n by the death of any party by whom he was appointed.\n (3) Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of\n any law by virtue of which any right of action is\n extinguished by the death of a person.\"\n\n * * * *\n \"46. Right of partners to have business wound up after\n dissolution.- On the dissolution of a firm every partner or\n his representative is entitled, as against all the other\n partners or their representatives, to have the property of\n the firm applied in payment of the debts and liabilities of\n the firm, and to have the surplus distributed among the\n partners or their representatives according to their rights.\n\n 47. Continuing authority of partners for purposes of\n winding up.- After the dissolution of a firm the authority\n of each partner to bind the firm, and the other mutual\n rights and obligations of the partners, continue\n notwithstanding the dissolution, so far as may be\n necessary to wind up the affairs of the firm and to\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (31 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n complete transactions begun but unfinished at the time of\n the dissolution, but not otherwise:\n\n Provided that the firm is in no case bound by the\n acts of a partner who has been adjudicated insolvent; but\n this proviso does not affect the liability of any person\n who has after the adjudication represented himself or\n knowingly permitted himself to be represented as a\n partner of the insolvent.\n\n 48. Mode of settlement of accounts between partners.- In\n settling the accounts of a firm after dissolution, the\n following rules shall, subject to agreement by the\n partners, be observed :-\n\n (a) losses, including deficiencies of capital, shall be\n paid first out of profits, next out of capital, and\n lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in\n the proportions in which they were entitled to share\n profits;\n\n (b) the assets of the firm, including any sums\n contributed by the partners to make up deficiencies\n of capital, shall be applied in the following manner\n and order-\n\n (i) in paying the debts of the firm to third parties;\n\n (ii) in paying to each partner rateably what is due\n to him from the firm for advances as\n distinguished from capital;\n\n (iii) in paying to each partner rateably what is due\n to him on account of capital; and\n\n (iv) the residue, if any, shall be divided among\n the partners in the proportions in which they were\n entitled to share profits.\"\n\n 18. It is clear from \nSection 40\n of the Arbitration Act that an\n arbitration agreement is not discharged by the death of any\n party thereto and on such death it is enforceable by or\n against the legal representatives of the deceased, nor is the\n authority of the arbitrator revoked by the death of the party\n appointing him, subject to the operation of any law by virtue\n of which the death of a person extinguishes the right of\n action of that person.\n\n 19. \nSection 2(1)(g)\n defines \"legal representative\" which\n reads thus:\n\n \"2. (1)(g) \"Legal Representative\" means a person who\n in law represents the estate of a deceased person, and\n includes any person who intermeddles with the estate\n of the deceased person, and, where a party acts in a\n representative character, the person on whom the\n estate develops on the death of the party so acting;\"\n\n 20. The definition of 'legal representative' became necessary\n because such representatives are bound by and also entitled\n to enforce an arbitration agreement. \nSection 40\n clearly says\n that an arbitration agreement is not discharged by the death\n of a party. The agreement remains enforceable by or against\n the legal representatives of the deceased. In our opinion, a\n person who has the right to represent the estate of deceased\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (32 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n person occupies the status of a legal person (sic\n representative). \nSection 35\n of the 1996 Act which imparts the\n touch of finality to an arbitral award says that the award shall\n have binding effect on the \"parties and persons claiming\n under them\". Persons claiming under the rights of a deceased\n person are the personal representative of the deceased party\n and they have the right to enforce the award and are also\n bound by it. The arbitration agreement is enforceable by or\n against the legal representative of a deceased party provided\n the right to sue in respect of the cause of action survives.\n\n 21. We have already extracted \nSections 46\n, \n47\n & \n48\n of the\n Partnership Act. \nSection 46\n provides two things, namely, first\n is to realize the assets of the business and then to apply the\n same for discharge of liabilities and finally to distribute the\n surplus, if any, among the partners. All that \nSection 46\n\n empowers is that every partner shall claim that this is to be\n done for ultimate distribution of the surplus to the partners\n according to their shares. A suit to enforce the latter right\n relating to the distribution of surplus is generally called a suit\n for an account which means account taken up accordingly.\n This right to a partner to file a suit for account is not affected\n by the fact that the retiring partner has already inspected the\n accounts of the firm. \nSection 46\n is, however, merely\n declaratory of the rights of the partners or their legal\n representatives in the surplus and does not set out the mode\n of calculating the surplus. The share of a partner upon the\n winding up of a dissolved firm, is only in the residue which is\n left after the liabilities mentioned in the various clauses of\n \nSection 48\n have been paid out. Payment of capital and\n advances to partners is not out of the residue. The amount\n paid as capital investment to a partner will have to be\n deducted in order to find the value of the residue, because the\n value of a partner's share is only his proportion of the residue.\n\n 22. \"Right of Representative of a Partner.- The right of a\n representative of a partner is really a claim against the\n surplus assets on realisation-whether the surplus consists\n entirely of the proceeds of realisation or whether they\n include some specific items of property, which existed on\n the death of the partner. The proper remedy of a partner\n in the circumstances is to have accounts taken to\n ascertain his share and if the right to sue for accounts is\n barred by limitation, the partner cannot sue any partner\n in possession of the assets for a share therein, and the\n limitation will be governed by \nArt.5\n of the Limitation Act.\"\n\n 23. On the dissolution of the firm, the arbitration clause\n does not come to an end and so if a dispute had arisen\n during the lifetime of the deceased partner, his legal\n representatives would be entitled to take proceedings under\n \nSection 20\n of the Arbitration Act, 1940.\n\n 24. When a partner dies and the partnership comes to an\n end it is not only right but also the duty of the surviving\n partner to realize the assets for the purpose of winding up of\n the partnership affairs including the payment of the\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (33 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n partnership debts. However, it is true that in a general sense\n the executors or administrators of the deceased partner may\n be said to have a lien upon the partnership assets in respect\n of his interest in the partnership and taking the partnership\n account.\n\n 25. \nSection 47\n: It is clear that the commencement of the\n dissolution does not at once terminate the authority of the\n partners. Such authority continues at least for 2 purposes,\n namely, (1) so far as necessary to wind up the affairs of the\n firm; and (2) to complete the transaction begun but had not\n yet been completed.\n\n 26. \nSection 48\n: It lays down two fundamental propositions\n which are in line of the provisions of \nSection 46\n of the\n Partnership Act, namely, (1) as to the payment of the losses;\n and (2) as to the application of the assets. It is to be noted\n that the provisions of \nSection 48\n are the culmination of the\n provisions of \nSection 46\n of the Partnership Act. Therefore,\n both the sections have to be harmoniously read together and\n interpreted.\n\n 27. We are of the opinion that in view of the provisions of\n \nSection 46\n read with \nSection 48\n of the Indian Partnership Act\n as well as \nSection 40\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n 1996, the application for appointment of an arbitrator under\n the arbitration clause of the partnership deed was liable to be\n allowed and the learned Chief Justice has erred in overlooking\n the said provisions. While right to sue for rendition of\n accounts of partnership firm survives on the legal\n representative of a deceased partner, he is also entitled to\n invoke the arbitration clause contained in the partnership\n deed.\"\n\n \n21. Though decisions of various High Courts on this aspect have\n\n also been cited before this Court, it is not necessary to burden\n\n the view of this Court with other authorities in view of\n\n authoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\n case of \nRavi Prakash Goel\n (Supra). Therefore, the submissions\n\n of learned counsel for the respondents that after the death of Sita\n\n Devi Verma, there does not exist any arbitration agreement so as\n\n to entitle the applicant to seek appointment of an arbitrator in the\n\n matter of dispute fails and is hereby rejected, particularly when\n\n no other ground to assail existence and/or validity of the\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (34 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n agreement has been put forth by the respondent except death of\n\n Sita Devi Verma.\n\n 22. The next issue arising for consideration would be whether the\n\n dispute is non-arbitrable. Contents of the application seeking\n\n appointment of arbitrator and the notice for appointment of\n\n arbitrator reveal that even while Sita Devi Verma was alive, a\n\n dispute in relation to operation of the accounts of the firm M/s.\n\n Verma & Company had arisen on account of letter sent by Sita\n\n Devi Verma to the bank to freeze the accounts of the firm though\n\n according to the applicant later on, she had withdrawn such a\n\n request and consented for operation of the accounts. It is also\n\n revealed that the bank has also given legal notice to the firm and\n\n the legal representatives of the deceased Sita Devi Verma. The\n\n applicant seeks adjudication on mutual rights and duties of the\n\n partnership firm and determination thereof as the bank has sent a\n\n legal notice for realisation of the loan advanced to the bank. The\n\n applicant's claim is that all the partners are entitled to equal\n\n share in the loss and profit in the absence of there being any\n\n agreement in that regard and partners are jointly and severely\n\n liable for all acts of the firm done. According to the applicant, all\n\n the disputes with regard to the rights and liabilities are required\n\n to be determined through appropriate proceedings and, therefore,\n\n legal notice was given seeking appointment of an arbitrator. The\n\n legal representatives of the deceased are in possession of the\n\n estate of the deceased Sita Devi Verma.\n\n 23. Applying test of non-arbitrability as laid down succinctly by\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in plethora of decisions referred to\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (35 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n herein above, and applying \"Eye of the needle\" test, it cannot be\n\n held that the present case is classifiable as \"non-arbitrable\n\n dispute\".\n\n 24. In a recent judicial pronouncement in the case of VGP\n\n Marine Kingdom Private Limited and Another Versus Kay\n\n Ellen Arnold, (2023) 1 Supreme Court Cases 597, the legal\n\n position, as discussed in detailed herein above was reiterated as\n\n below:-\n\n \"11. ...............As per the decision of this Court in the case of\n Vidya Drolia & Others (supra) unless on the facet it is found\n that the dispute is not arbitrable and if it requires\n further/deeper consideration, the dispute with respect to the\n arbitrability should be left to the arbitrator. The decision of\n this Court in the case of Vidya Drolia & Others (supra) is a\n three judges' bench subsequent decision in which the entire\n law on the scope and ambit of the Court at the stage of\n application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act, 1996 has been\n dealt with and considered by the Court.\"\n\n In another recent judicial pronouncement in the case of\n\n Meenakshi Solar Power Pvt. Ltd. Versus Abhyudaya Green\n\n Economic Zones Pvt. Ltd, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1616, the\n\n legal position, relying upon dictum in Vidya Drolia & Others\n\n (Supra), was reaffirmed as below:-\n\n \"17. Further, this Court observed that the court at the\n referral stage can interfere only when it is manifest that the\n claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no\n subsisting dispute. In the context of issue of limitation\n period, it should be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for\n decision on merits. Similar would be the position in case of\n disputed \"no-claim certificate\" or defence on the plea of\n novation and \"accord and satisfaction\"\n\n 25. The legal position that when contention relating to non-\n\n arbitrability are plainly arguable or when facts are contested,\n\n Court would prefer to refer the matter for arbitration while\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (36 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n considering an application for appointment of an arbitrator under\n\n \nSection 11\n of he Act of 1996 has been authoritatively settled in\n\n not only Vidya Drolia & Others (Supra), but also many other\n\n decisions including Mohammed Masroor Shaikh Versus\n\n Bharat Bhushan Gupta & Others, (2022) 4 Supreme Court\n\n Cases 156 wherein, following pertinent observations were\n\n made:-\n\n \"19. Thus, this Court held that while dealing with petition\n under \nSection 11\n, the Court by default would refer the\n matter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are\n plainly arguable. In such case, the issue of non-arbitrability\n is left open to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. On perusal\n of the impugned order, we find that the issues of non-\n arbitrability and the claim being time barred have not been\n concluded by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High\n Court. In fact, in clause (vii) of the operative part of the\n impugned Order, the learned Single Judge has observed that\n the contentions of the parties have been kept open. The\n petitions filed by the appellant under \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act, challenging the Order dated 25-5-2021 are\n pending before the High Court in which the appellant can\n raise all permissible contentions.\"\n\n Similar are the observations made in plethora of decisions\n\n which were quoted with approval in the case of Sanjiv Prakash\n\n Versus Seema Kukreja and Others, (2021) 9 Supreme\n\n Court Cases 732, which reads as below:-\n\n \"20. The Court in Vidya Drolia & Others (supra) then\n concluded, on the facts of that case, that it would be unsafe\n to conclude one way or the other that an arbitration\n agreement exists between the parties on a prima facie\n review of facts of that case, and that a deeper consideration\n must be left to an arbitrator, who is to examine the\n documentary and oral evidence and then arrive at a\n conclusion.\n\n \n21. Likewise, in \nBharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. Nortel\n Networks India Pvt. Ltd.\n, (2021) 5 SCC 738, another Division\n Bench of this Court referred to Vidya Drolia & Others (supra)\n and concluded:(BSNL) (Supra), SCC pp. 765-66, paras 46-\n\n \n47)\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JP:41479] (37 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n \"46.The upshot of the judgment in \nVidya Drolia &\n Others v. Durga Trading Corporation\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 is\n affirmation of the position of law expounded in \nDuro\n Felguera, S.A.\n (Supra) and \nMayavati Trading (P) Ltd.\n\n (Supra), which continue to hold the field.\n \nIt must be\n understood clearly that \nVidya Drolia & Others\n (Supra)\n has not resurrected the pre-amendment position on the\n scope of power as held in SBP & Co. v. Patel\n Engineering SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (Supra).\n\n 47. It is only in the very limited category of cases,\n where there is not even a vestige of doubt that the\n claim is ex facie time- barred, or that the dispute is\n non-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make the\n reference. However, if there is even the slightest doubt,\n the rule is to refer the disputes to arbitration, otherwise\n it would encroach upon what is essentially a matter to\n be determined by the tribunal.\"\n\n 22. On the contrary, a \nSection 11\n court would refer the\n matter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are\n plainly arguable, or when facts are contested. The court\n cannot, at this stage, enter into a mini trial or elaborate\n review of the facts and law which would usurp the\n jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.\"\n\n 26. Resultantly, the application seeking appointment of an\n\n arbitrator is required to be allowed and the same is, accordingly,\n\n allowed. Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.K. Agarwal (Retd.), C-82, Ram\n\n Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Jaipur is appointed as the Sole Arbitrator to\n\n adjudicate upon the dispute between the parties and pass an\n\n award. The Sole Arbitrator shall be entitled to fee, as provided\n\n under Fourth Schedule appended to the Act of 1996.\n\n 27. The Registry is directed to intimate Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.K.\n\n Agarwal (Retd.) regarding his appointment as Sole Arbitrator. The\n\n parties are also directed to intimate the Sole Arbitrator towards\n\n commencement of arbitral proceedings in accordance with law.\n\n (MANINDRA MOHAN SHRIVASTAVA),CJ\n\n SANJAY KUMAWAT-15\n\n (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",

By putting\n party autonomy on a high pedestal, the Act mandates that\n the parties to a valid arbitration agreement must abide by\n the consensual and agreed mode of dispute resolution. The\n courts must show due respect to arbitration agreements\n particularly in commercial settings by staying the court\n proceedings, unless the legislative language is to the\n contrary. The principle of party autonomy goes hand in\n hand with the principle of limited court intervention, this\n being the fundamental principle underlying modern\n arbitration law. Party autonomy is weaker in non-negotiated\n \"take it or leave it\" contracts and, therefore, the legislature\n can through statutes shield the weakest and vulnerable\n contracting parties like consumers. This is not so in\n negotiated agreements or even in adhesion contracts having\n an arbitration clause in commercial settings. Virtues of\n commercial and civil arbitration have been recognised and\n accepted and the courts even encourage the use of\n arbitration."

Likewise, in the facts of the\n present case, it is clear that the arbitration clause\n that is contained in the sub-contract would not\n \"exist\" as a matter of law until the sub-contract is\n duly stamped, as has been held by us above.\n \nThe\n argument that \nSection 11\n(6-A) deals with\n \"existence\", as opposed to \nSection 8\n, \nSection 16\n and\n \nSection 45\n, which deal with \"validity\" of an\n arbitration agreement is answered by this Court's\n understanding of the expression \"existence\" in\n \nUnited India Insurance Co.
