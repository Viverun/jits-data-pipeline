OF 2025\n(Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 8075 of 2025)\n\nYOGENDRA PAL SINGH …APPELLANT(S)\n\nVERSUS\n\nRAGHVENDRA SINGH ALIAS PRINCE\nAND ANOTHER … RESPONDENT(S)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nR. MAHADEVAN, J.\n\nLeave granted.\n\n2. The challenge in the present appeal is to the judgment and order dated\n\n09.01.20251 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad 2 in Criminal\n\nMisc. Bail Application No. 7768 of 2024, whereby the High Court granted bail\n\nto Respondent No. l / accused, in connection with Case Crime No. 415 of 2023\n\nregistered at Police Station Kotwali, District Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh, for\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nBORRA LM VALLI\n\nDate: 2025.11.28\n\n17:48:56 IST\n\nReason:\nHereinafter referred to as “the impugned order”\nHereinafter referred to as “the High Court”\noffences punishable under\nSections 498A\n,\n304B\n, and\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode, 18603 read with Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 19614.\n\n3. This appeal has been preferred by the appellant, who is the father of the\n\ndeceased Aastha @ Saarika, seeking cancellation of bail granted to Respondent\n\nNo. 1/ Accused – Husband, Raghvendra Singh @ Prince. The appellant’s\n\ndaughter died on 05.06.2023, i.e., within four months of her marriage, in highly\n\nsuspicious circumstances by allegedly consuming poison.\n\n4. The facts, as projected by the appellant, are as follows:\n\n4.1. The appellant's daughter Aastha @ Saarika was married to Respondent\n\nNo.1 – Raghvendra Singh @ Prince, on 22.02.2023 according to Hindu rites\n\nand rituals. At the time of marriage, the appellant spent approximately Rs. 22\n\nlakhs in cash, gave articles worth Rs. 10 lakhs and jewellery worth Rs. 15 lakhs\n\nto the first respondent’s family.\n\n4.2. Soon after marriage, the deceased was subjected to cruelty and\n\nharassment by Respondent No. 1 and his family members on the pretext that the\n\ndowry given was insufficient. The accused persons persistently demanded a\n\nFortuner car as additional dowry and subjected the deceased to mental and\n\nphysical torture.\n\n4.3. When the deceased came to her parental home during the chhathi ritual,\n\nshe informed the appellant about the cruelty and demand for a Fortuner car. Ten\nFor short, “\nIPC\n”\nFor short, “\nD.P. Act\n”\ndays before her death, on 02.06.2023, she was again sent back to her\n\nmatrimonial home only after assurance by Respondent No. 1 that such\n\nharassment would not be repeated.\n\n4.4. On 04.06.2023, during a family function at Kaushambi, there was a\n\nquarrel between Respondent No. 1 and the deceased. Later that night, around\n\n01.30 am, the deceased telephoned her elder sister Diksha in a distressed state,\n\ncrying and seeking urgent help. At that time, she disclosed that Respondent No.\n\n1 along with his relatives had forcibly administered some foul-smelling\n\nsubstance to her, due to which she was feeling uneasy.\n\n4.5. The deceased was immediately taken to Sadar Hospital, Fatehpur, where\n\nshe was found with froth emanating from her mouth. Despite medical\n\nintervention, her condition deteriorated and she expired while being shifted to\n\nKanpur.\n\n4.6. A post-mortem examination was conducted on 05.06.2023, but the cause\n\nof death was not initially ascertained. Thereafter, the viscera was sent to a\n\nforensic science laboratory for examination, and the FSL report confirmed the\n\npresence of aluminium phosphide poison.\n\n4.7. Despite serious allegations, the police did not arrest the accused\n\nimmediately. After investigation, charge sheet no.557 of 2023 dated 30.10.2023\n\nwas filed, implicating only Respondent No. 1/ husband, and excluding other\n\nnamed in-laws.\n4.8. Respondent No. 1 approached the Sessions Court seeking bail, which was\n\ndismissed by order dated 20.10.2023. However, the High Court, by the\n\nimpugned order, allowed his bail application.\n\n4.9. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant is before this Court with the present\n\nappeal.\n\n5. Learned senior counsel for the appellant assailed the impugned order\n\ngranting bail to Respondent No. 1 on multiple grounds. It was submitted that the\n\nHigh Court failed to consider the gravity of the offence, the nature of evidence\n\navailable against the accused, as well as the statutory presumption under\nSection\n\n113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which squarely applies in cases of\n\ndowry death occurring within seven years of marriage.\n\n5.1. It was contended that the present case involves the most serious\n\nallegations where the deceased was continuously harassed for dowry by\n\nRespondent No. 1 / husband, and in the course of such harassment, was\n\npoisoned to death on 05.06.2023, i.e., within four months of her marriage.\n\nAccording to the learned senior counsel, the post-mortem report records an\n\nante-mortem injury – an abrasion on the left forearm – and the Forensic Science\n\nLaboratory report categorically confirmed the presence of aluminium phosphide\n\npoison, thereby corroborating the prosecution’s case of homicidal poisoning.\n5.2. Learned senior counsel placing reliance on the chargesheet, which\n\nrecords that the accused’s uncle, Tej Bahadur Singh alias Ram Bahadur, is\n\npolitically active, having contested the 2017 Assembly Elections, and owns\n\nseveral plots, agricultural lands, brick kilns, and multiple vehicles, submitted\n\nthat the family of the accused is highly influential and wields considerable clout\n\nin the area. It is to be noted that though the uncle was initially arraigned as an\n\naccused along with his wife, Vijay Shri, their names were later dropped from the\n\nchargesheet, which according to the learned senior counsel, suggests that there\n\ncould be serious doubts regarding the fairness of the investigation.\n\n5.3. It was further submitted that the investigation in this case has been carried\n\nout in an impartial manner since the inception. Respondent No. 1/ husband was\n\narrested only after three months of the FIR, while the other named accused were\n\nnever arrested. The chargesheet filed on 30.10.2023 did not fairly reflect the\n\ninvolvement of all accused. In fact, the Assistant Prosecution Officer, Fatehpur,\n\nvide letter dated 16.11.2023, pointed out several deficiencies in the investigation\n\nand requested the Joint Director, Prosecution, Fatehpur to seek a fresh legal\n\nopinion after collecting the material evidence which had been ignored by the\n\ninvestigating officer. This eventually led to the transfer of the investigation to\n\nthe CB-CID itself indicative of the gravity of the offence and the shortcomings\n\nin the earlier investigation.\n5.4. Learned senior counsel argued that in such circumstances, any leniency\n\nshown towards the accused would severely prejudice the trial, as there exists a\n\nstrong likelihood of tampering with the evidence and influencing the\n\nprosecution witnesses and the High Court, while granting bail, failed to\n\nappreciate this real and imminent threat.\n\n5.5. It was also contended that the High Court committed an error in relying\n\nupon the judgments in\nSatender Kumar Antil v. CBI5\nand\nManish Sisodia v.\n\nDirectorate of Enforcement6\n, since both these cases are clearly distinguishable\n\nbased on the facts, nature of offence, period of incarceration, and the materials\n\navailable against the accused. The settled principles governing bail in cases of\n\ndowry death under\nSection 304B\nIPC and the presumption under\nSection 113B\n\nof the Evidence Act were altogether ignored by the High Court.\n\n5.6. On the basis of these submissions, learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellant prayed for cancellation of bail granted to Respondent No. 1, so as to\n\nensure a fair and effective trial.\n\n6. Per contra, the learned counsel for Respondent No. 1 / accused, at the\n\noutset, submitted that the present appeal is not maintainable, as there is no\n\nperversity, arbitrariness, or illegality in the well-reasoned order of the High\n\nCourt granting bail. Once the discretionary relief of bail has been exercised\n2022 INSC 690\n2024 INSC 595\njudiciously on appreciation of material, it ought not to be interfered with by this\n\nCourt in the absence of gross illegality or miscarriage of justice.\n\n6.1. It was contended that the incident dated 05.06.2023 was first reported by\n\nthe complainant vide G.D. Entry No. 019, which merely mentions the death of\n\nthe deceased under suspicious circumstances, without any reference to dowry\n\ndemand or cruelty. The FIR was lodged belatedly on 15.06.2023, after ten days\n\nand after the last rites, raising doubts about its genuineness.\n\n6.1.1. During the investigation, statements of the deceased’s family members\n\nintroduced allegations of dowry demand her a Fortuner car and cruelty by\n\nRespondent No. 1 and his relatives. However, these allegations were absent in\n\nthe initial report. Similarly, the allegation that the deceased made a distress call\n\nto her sister in the intervening night of 04/05.06.2023 complaining of being\n\nadministered some “smelly substance” remains uncorroborated, as no call\n\nrecords substantiate the same.\n\n6.1.2. The chargesheet dated 30.10.2023 was filed against Respondent No. 1\n\nunder\nSections 498A\n,\n304B\n, and\nIPC read with\nSections 3\nand\nof the D.P.\n\nAct. Notably, co-accused Tej Bahadur Singh and Vijay Shri, initially named in\n\nthe FIR, were exonerated as their presence at the relevant point of time was\n\nestablished elsewhere, and they had no motive. Further investigation culminated\n\nin a final report dated 30.04.2025, which reaffirmed their innocence. The\n\nexoneration of these relatives significantly weakens the prosecution’s version,\nmaking it improbable that the alleged offence was committed by Respondent\n\nNo.1 alone.\n\n6.2. It was argued that the prosecution has relied solely on statements of\n\ninterested witnesses – the father, mother, and sisters of the deceased, which\n\naccording to the learned counsel, are not corroborated by independent or\n\ndocumentary evidence, and thus cannot be treated as conclusive proof of dowry\n\nharassment.\n\n6.3. Learned counsel further submitted that the deceased was allegedly\n\nunwilling to marry Respondent No. 1 as she was in love with one Abhay Singh\n\n(brother-in-law of her elder sister).\n\n6.4. It was submitted that the post-mortem report dated 05.06.2023 records a\n\nsingle abrasion of 1 cm x 1 cm on the left forearm, and the FSL report indicates\n\naluminium phosphide ingestion as the cause of death. However, neither\n\ndocument establishes that the poison was administered by Respondent No. 1.\n\nThe issue of whether poison was self-ingested or administered, and the\n\nsignificance of the forearm injury, are matters of trial.\n\n6.5. Lastly, it was highlighted that Respondent No. 1 has already undergone\n\nmore than 15 months of incarceration (from 22.09.2023 to 09.10.2025) and is\n\nwilling to cooperate with the trial.\n\n6.6. On these grounds, it was urged that the order granting bail to Respondent\n\nNo. 1 calls for no interference by this Court.\n7. Learned counsel for the State supported the case of the complainant,\n\nsubmitting as follows:\n\n(i) Based on the complaint given by the appellant alleging that his daughter\n\nwas killed by her in-laws on account of unmet dowry demands, FIR\n\nNo.415/2023 dated 15.06.2023 was registered at P.S. Kotwali, District Fatehpur\n\nunder\nSections 498A\n,\n304B\n,\n120B\nand\nIPC and\nSections 3\nand\nof the D.P.\n\nAct against Respondent No. 1 and his family members.\n\n(ii) The delay of ten days in lodging the FIR was explained by the appellant’s\n\nmental condition, as he was in deep shock and grief after the sudden death of his\n\ndaughter.\n\n(iii) The post-mortem conducted on 05.06.2023 revealed an abrasion on the\n\nforearm, and the FSL report confirmed aluminium phosphide poisoning as the\n\ncause of death.\n\n(iv) Statements of key witnesses – Abhay Singh (brother-in-law), the\n\nappellant (father), Premlata Singh (mother), and sisters (Sameeksha Singh and\n\nDiksha Singh) – recorded under\nSection 161\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\n19737 corroborated the allegations of dowry demand and cruelty mentioned in\n\nthe FIR.\n\n(v) Upon the appellant’s representation, the investigation was transferred to\n\nCB-CID, which reaffirmed the findings of the local police.\nFor short, “\nCr.P.C\n”\n(vi) Chargesheet No. 557 of 2023 dated 30.10.2023 was filed only against\n\nRespondent No. 1, on which cognizance was duly taken by the Sessions Court.\n\n(vii) The High Court failed to appreciate the seriousness of the offence – the\n\nunnatural death of a young woman within four months of marriage, amid\n\nspecific allegations of dowry demands and poisoning. The High Court’s order\n\noverlooked the gravity of the allegations and the societal menace of dowry\n\ndeaths.\n\n7.1. It was therefore submitted that the bail granted to Respondent No. 1\n\nought to be cancelled in the interests of justice.\n\n8. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe parties and perused the materials available on record.\n\n9. Apparently, criminal proceedings were initiated against Respondent No. 1\n\n/ Husband pursuant to a complaint lodged by the appellant / father in connection\n\nwith the unnatural death of his daughter on 05.06.2023. FIR No. 415 of 2023\n\ndated 15.06.2023 was registered against Respondent No. 1 and the in-laws of\n\nthe deceased for offences punishable under\nSections 498A\n,\n304B\n,\n120B\nand\nIPC and\nSections 3\nand\nof the D.P. Act. Upon completion of investigation, the\n\nchargesheet was filed only against Respondent No. 1 for offences under\nSection\n\n498A\n,\n304B\nand\nIPC and\nSections 3\nand\nof the D.P. Act. Respondent No.\n\n1 was arrested on 22.09.2023. His Bail Application (No. 2225 of 2023) was\n\nrejected by the Sessions Court on 20.10.2023, following which he filed\nCriminal Misc. Bail Application No. 7768 of 2024 before the High Court, which\n\nallowed the same, by the order impugned herein.\n\n10. The appellant, being the father of the deceased, is undoubtedly an\n\naggrieved person and thus possesses the requisite locus standi to maintain the\n\npresent appeal seeking cancellation of the bail granted to Respondent No. 1. The\n\nunnatural death of his daughter within four months of marriage, allegedly on\n\naccount of dowry harassment, directly affects his rights as a complainant.\n\n10.1.\nIn\nR. Rathinam v. State by DSP8\n, this Court has categorically held that\n\nthe power under\nSection 439(2)\nCr.P.C. to cancel bail may be invoked not only\n\nat the instance of the State but also by any aggrieved party.\n\n10.2.\n\nSimilarly, in\nBrij Nandan Jaiswal v. Munna @ Munna Jaiswal\nand\n\nanother9, this Court observed:\n\n“7. It is now a settled law that complainant can always question the order\ngranting bail if the said bail is not validly passed. It is not as if once a bail is\ngranted by any court, the only way is to get it cancelled on account of its misuse.\nThe bail order can be tested on merits also. In our opinion, therefore, the\ncomplainant could question the merits of the order granting bail.”\n\n10.3. Applying the above legal position to the present case, the appellant, being\n\nthe complainant and father of the deceased, has a direct and substantial interest\n\nin seeking cancellation of bail. Accordingly, the present case is clearly\n\nmaintainable before this Court.\n(2000) 2 SCC 391\nCriminal Appeal No. 2087 of 2008 decided on 19.12.2008\n11. The law relating to cancellation of bail is well settled. Recently, in State\n\nof Karnataka v. Sri Darshan, etc.10, this Court comprehensively reviewed the\n\nprinciples governing annulment and cancellation of bail. The Court\n\ndistinguished between annulment of bail due to legal infirmity in the order, and\n\ncancellation of bail arising from post-bail misconduct or supervening\n\ncircumstances. It is well established that bail granted without due application of\n\nmind to relevant factors – such as the gravity of the offence, prima facie\n\nevidence, or the antecedents of the accused – may be annulled. Courts must\n\nconsider the totality of circumstances, balancing the presumption of innocence\n\nagainst the seriousness of the crime, societal interest, and risk of the misuse of\n\nliberty. For ready reference, the relevant paragraphs are extracted below:\n\n“15. The statutory framework governing cancellation of bail is well-settled.\n\nSection 439(2)\nof the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 empowers the High Court\nor the Court of Sessions to direct the re-arrest of an accused who has been\nreleased on bail, if such direction is deemed “necessary”. Similarly, Section 437\n(5) enables a Magistrate to cancel bail granted under Section 437(1) or (2).\n\nThese provisions underscore the legislative intent that the power to grant bail is\nnot absolute but is always subject to judicial reconsideration in light of\nemerging facts or legal infirmities in the original order.\n\n16. It is equally well established that the considerations for grant of bail and for\nits cancellation are not identical. While the grant of bail involves a preventive\nevaluation of the likelihood of misuse of liberty, the cancellation of bail entails a\nreview of the prior decision – either on account of supervening circumstances or\nbecause the original order was legally flawed. As laid down in\nState (Delhi\nAdministration) v. Sanjay Gandhi11, “Rejection\nof bail when bail is applied for,\nis one thing; cancellation of bail already granted is quite another”. This\nprinciple reflects a recognition of the sanctity of liberty once granted, and the\nrequirement of compelling justification for its withdrawal.\n2025 INSC 979\n(1978) 2 SCC 411\n17. However, it is equally well recognized that bail granted without due\napplication of mind to relevant factors – such as the gravity of the offence, the\nstrength of the evidence, or the conduct and antecedents of the accused – may be\ncancelled. Even in the absence of subsequent misconduct, a bail order that is\nperverse, unjustified, or legally untenable is vulnerable to interference.\nIn\nDolat\nRam v State of Haryana12\n, this Court held that “where a bail order is passed in\ndisregard of material facts or in an arbitrary manner, it can be set aside”.\n\n18. Let us now examine the jurisprudence on when bail may be annulled or\ncancelled. Two distinct categories have emerged in this regard:\n\n(A) Annulment of Bail due to legal infirmity in the order; and\n(B) Cancellation of Bail, i.e., revocation of bail due to post-grant misconduct or\nsupervening circumstances.\n\n(A) Annulment of bail orders\n18.1. This refers to the appellate or revisional power to set aside a bail order\nthat is perverse, unjustified, or passed in violation of settled legal principles. It\nis concerned with defects existing at the time the bail was granted, without\nreference to subsequent conduct.\n\n18.2.\nIn\nPrahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT of Delhi\n13, this court laid down guiding\nprinciples:\n\n“(a) While granting bail the court has to keep in mind not only the nature of the\naccusations, but the severity of the punishment, if the accusation entails\nconviction and the nature of evidence in support of the accusations.\n\n(b) Reasonable apprehensions of the witnesses being tampered with or the\napprehension of there being a threat for the complainant should also weigh with\nthe court in the matter of grant of bail.\n\n(c) While it is not expected to have the entire evidence establishing the guilt of\nthe accused beyond reasonable doubt but there ought always to be a prima facie\nsatisfaction of the court in support of the charge.\n\n(d) Frivolity in prosecution should always be considered and it is only the\nelement of genuineness that shall have to be considered in the matter of grant of\nbail, and in the event of there being some doubt as to the genuineness of the\nprosecution, in the normal course of events, the accused is entitled to an order\nof bail.”\n\n18.3.\nIn\nPuran v. Rambilas\nand another14, it was held that a bail order can be\nset aside even in the absence of post-bail misconduct if it is found to be\nunjustified, illegal, or perverse.\n(1995) 1 SCC 349\n(2001) 4 SCC 280\n(2001) 6 SCC 338\n18.4. Similarly, in\nDr. Narendra K. Amin v. State of Gujarat and another\n15, a\nthree-Judge Bench held that consideration of irrelevant materials renders the\nbail order vulnerable and liable to be set aside.\n\n18.5.\nIn\nPrasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee16\n, this Court held that\nwhere the High Court grants bail mechanically and without application of mind\nto material factors such as the gravity of the offence or antecedents of the\naccused, such an order must be set aside.\n\n18.6.\nIn\nPrakash Kadam and others v. Ramprasad Viswanath Gupta\nand\nanother17, this Court distinguished between cancellation of bail by the same\ncourt and annulment by an appellate / revisional court. It observed:\n\n“18. In considering whether to cancel the bail the court has also to\nconsider the gravity and nature of the offence, prima facie case against\nthe accused, the position and standing of the accused, etc. If there are\nvery serious allegations against the accused his bail may be cancelled\neven if he has not misused the bail granted to him. Moreover, the above\nprinciple applies when the same court which granted bail is approached\nfor cancelling the bail. It will not apply when the order granting bail is\nappealed against before an appellate/Revisional Court.\n\n19. ….. There are several other factors also which may be seen while\ndeciding to cancel the bail.”\n\n18.7.\nIn\nNeeru Yadav v. State of UP18\n, this court annulled a bail order where the\nHigh Court had ignored the criminal antecedents of the accused and relied\nmechanically on parity. It held that consideration of irrelevant factors and\nomission of relevant considerations renders the order perverse. As the court\nnoted:\n\n“15. …. It is clear as a cloudless sky that the High Court has totally\nignored the criminal antecedents of the accused. What has weighed with\nthe High Court is the doctrine of parity. A history-sheeter involved in the\nnature of crimes which we have reproduced hereinabove, are not minor\noffences so that he is not to be retained in custody, but the crimes are of\nheinous nature and such crimes, by no stretch of imagination, can be\nregarded as jejune. Such cases do create a thunder and lightning having\nthe effect potentiality of torrential rain in an analytical mind. The law\nexpects the judiciary to be alert while admitting these kind of accused\npersons to be at large and, therefore, the emphasis is on exercise of\ndiscretion judiciously and not in a whimsical manner.”\n2008 (6) SCALE 415\n(2010) 14 SCC 496\n(2011) 6 SCC 189\n(2014) 16 SCC 508\nIt further clarified:\n\n“18. Before parting with the case, we may repeat with profit that it is not\nan appeal for cancellation of bail as the cancellation is not sought\nbecause of supervening circumstances. The annulment of the order\npassed by the High Court is sought as many relevant factors have not\nbeen taken into consideration which includes the criminal antecedents of\nthe accused and that makes the order a deviant one. Therefore, the\ninevitable result is the lancination of the impugned order.”\n\n18.8.\nIn\nAnil Kumar Yadav v. State (NCT of Delhi\n) 19, this Court reiterated that\nwhile no exhaustive list can be laid down, courts must always consider the\ntotality of circumstances, including the seriousness of the offence, prima facie\nevidence, and potential for interference with the trial.\n\n18.9.\nIn\nState of Kerala v. Mahesh20\n, it was observed that even under\nArticle\n, where interference with bail orders is rare, this Court will exercise its\npowers if the bail order is found to be lacking application of mind or based on\nirrelevant considerations.\n\n….\n\n18.15. Thus, it is clear that while cancellation of bail is a serious matter\ninvolving deprivation of personal liberty, the law does permit annulment of a\nbail order that is unjustified, legally untenable, or passed without due regard to\nmaterial considerations. The distinction between annulment of bail orders due\nto perversity and cancellation for post-bail misconduct must be clearly\nunderstood and applied, ensuring a careful, calibrated, and constitutionally\nsound approach to the administration of criminal justice.\n\n19. At this juncture, it is apposite to refer to the decision of this Bench in\nPinki\nv. State of Uttar Pradesh\nand another21, wherein, the bail granted to the\naccused therein was cancelled, after a detailed consideration of the facts and\nthe gravity of the offence, namely, child trafficking as well as the legal\nprinciples. The Court underscored that while personal liberty is a cherished\nconstitutional value, it is not absolute. Liberty must yield where it poses a threat\nto the collective interest of society. No individual can claim a liberty that\nendangers the life or liberty of others, as the rational collective cannot tolerate\nanti-social or anti-collective conduct. Emphasizing that bail jurisprudence is\ninherently fact-specific, the Court reiterated that each bail application must be\ndecided on its own merits, in light of the well settled on its own merits, in light\nof the well-settled parameters governing grant or denial of bail….”\n(2018) 12 SCC 129\nAIR 2021 SC 2071\n2025 INSC 482\n12. In the present case, Respondent No. 1 /accused was subjected to criminal\n\nprosecution for offences punishable under\nSections 498A\n,\n304B\nand\nIPC\n\nread with\nSections 3\nand\nof the D.P. Act, in connection with the unnatural\n\ndeath of his wife, who is the daughter of the appellant. The appellant alleges\n\nthat his daughter was subjected to persistent torture and harassment for failure\n\nto provide a Fortuner car as additional dowry.\n\n13. The post-mortem report reveals an abrasion on the left forearm of the\n\ndeceased, approximately 8 cm above the wrist joint. The subsequent Forensic\n\nLaboratory Report on the chemical analysis of the viscera may indicate\n\ningestion of a poisonous or unnatural substance. Therefore, the cause of death\n\ncannot be conclusively ascertained at this stage and is to be determined by the\n\ntrial Court during the course of the trial.\n\n14. The statements of witnesses recorded under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. prima\n\nfacie indicate that the deceased was subjected to persistent dowry demands and\n\ncruelty at the hands of the accused. Abhay Singh, the brother-in-law of the\n\nappellant’s elder daughter, stated that the deceased repeatedly complained of\n\nharassment and abuse by her husband and in-laws on account of dowry\n\ndemands, including the demand for a vehicle. The appellant further deposed that\n\nshortly before her death, the deceased disclosed to him that her husband and in-\n\nlaws had forcibly made her consume a “smelly substance”, after which she\ncollapsed and succumbed while being taken to Kanpur. This disclosure\n\nconstitutes a dying declaration of high evidentiary value, corroborated by other\n\nwitnesses.\n\n14.1. The mother of the deceased, Premlata Singh, corroborated the appellant’s\n\nstatement, adding that she was in regular telephonic contact with her daughter,\n\nwho narrated continuous torture for dowry. The younger sister, Sameeksha\n\nSingh, gave a concurrent statement, testifying that Respondent No. 1 used to\n\nthreaten the deceased not to disclose the abuse, and frequently used abusive\n\nlanguage. The elder sister, Diksha Singh, narrated the facts of the fateful night.\n\nShe testified that the deceased had called her repeatedly around 1.30 am, crying\n\nand begging to be rescued. She further deposed that when her father asked the\n\ndeceased at the hospital about what had happened, the deceased again said that\n\nher husband, uncle, and aunt had forcibly administered a “smelly substance” to\n\nher.\n\n15. Despite such grave allegations, the police remained inactive for an\n\ninordinate period. Respondent No. 1 was arrested only on 22.09.2023, after a\n\ndelay of 104 days from lodging the FIR, and the appellant addressed a\n\nrepresentation to the Home Secretary seeking transfer to CB-CID. Such a delay\n\nreflects serious lapses in the investigation and undue benefit to the accused.\n16. Without considering these aspects, the High Court erroneously granted\n\nbail to Respondent No. 1/ accused by observing that at the stage of bail only\n\nprima facie satisfaction is required, and that an elaborate evaluation of the\n\nmerits of the case should be avoided. It invoked\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution,\n\nholding that bail is the rule and jail is the exception, and noted that there was no\n\nmaterial to suggest that the accused was likely to abscond or tamper with\n\nwitnesses.\n\n17. The statutory framework embodied in\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC and\n\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act further highlights the need for careful and\n\ncautious consideration in such cases.\nSection 304B\nIPC classifies the death of a\n\nmarried woman occurring within seven years of marriage, preceded by dowry-\n\nrelated cruelty or harassment, as a “dowry death”, punishable with\n\nimprisonment that may extend to life.\nSection 498A\nIPC criminalises cruelty by\n\nthe husband or his relatives, including harassment for unlawful demands of\n\ndowry. In addition,\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act mandates a presumption\n\nof dowry death once such foundational facts are established. Collectively, these\n\nprovisions reflect the legislature’s firm resolve to combat the social evil of\n\ndowry and to safeguard married women from cruelty and harassment within\n\ntheir matrimonial homes.\n\n17.1. In the present case, the marriage took place on 22.02.2023, and the death\n\noccurred on 05.06.2023 i.e. within four months of marriage. The dying\ndeclarations to the father and elder sister, coupled with consistent testimony of\n\nrelatives and post-mortem noting of an abrasion suggestive of restraint, satisfy\n\nthe foundational requirements of\nSection 304B\nIPC. Consequently, the\n\npresumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act arises inexorably against\n\nRespondent No. 1.\n\n17.2. The High Court, however, failed to take this statutory presumption into\n\naccount, and instead relied solely on general bail principles. This approach\n\ncontradicts the law\nlaid down in\nState of U.P. through CBI v. Amarmani\n\nTripathi22, which requires courts to evaluate the gravity of the offence, the\n\nnature of accusations and the prima facie evidence while considering bail.\n\n18.\nIn\nKans Raj v. State of Punjab\n23, this Court elaborated upon the\n\npresumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act. It held that once the\n\nprosecution establishes that the death of a woman occurred otherwise than\n\nunder normal circumstances within seven years of marriage, and that she was\n\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment “soon before her death” in connection with a\n\ndemand for dowry, a statutory presumption arises that the husband or his\n\nrelatives caused the dowry death. The burden then shifts to the accused to rebut\n\nthis presumption by showing the absence of dowry-related cruelty or lack of a\n\ncausal link between such cruelty and the death. The Court emphasised that once\n\nthe ingredients of\nSection 304B\nIPC are established, the presumption under\n(2005) 8 SCC 21\n(2000) 5 SCC 207\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act becomes mandatory, and the proximity\n\nbetween harassment and death is a decisive factor in its application. The\n\nfollowing paragraph is pertinent in this context:\n\n“9. The law as it exists now provides that where the death of a woman is caused\nby any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal\ncircumstances within 7 years of marriage and it is shown that soon before her\ndeath she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative\nfor or in connection with any demand of dowry such death shall be punishable\nunder Section 304B. In order to seek a conviction against a person for the\noffence of dowry death, the prosecution is obliged to prove that:\n\n(a) the death of a woman was caused by burns or bodily injury or had occurred\notherwise than under normal circumstances;\n\n(b) such death should have occurred within 7 years of her marriage;\n\n(c) the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or by\nany relative of her husband;\n\n(d) such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with the demand\nof dowry; and\n\n(e) to such cruelty or harassment the deceased should have been subjected to\nsoon before her death.\n\n10. As and when the aforesaid circumstances are established, a presumption of\ndowry death shall be drawn against the accused under\nSection 113B\nof the\nEvidence Act. It has to be kept in mind that presumption under Section 113B is a\npresumption of law. …”\n\n15. ….. “Soon before” is a relative term which is required to be considered\nunder specific circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula can be\n\nlaid down by\nfixing any time-limit. This expression is pregnant with the idea of\nproximity test. The term “soon before” is not synonymous with the term\n“immediately before” and is opposite of the expression “soon after” as used\nand understood in Section 114, Illustration (a) of the\nEvidence Act\n. These words\nwould imply that the interval should not be too long between the time of making\nthe statement and the death. It contemplates the reasonable time which, as\nearlier noticed, has to be understood and determined under the peculiar\ncircumstances of each case. In relation to dowry deaths, the circumstances\nshowing the existence of cruelty or harassment to the deceased are not restricted\nto a particular instance but normally refer to a course of conduct. Such conduct\nmay be spread over a period of time. If the cruelty or harassment or demand for\ndowry is shown to have persisted, it shall be deemed to be “soon before death”\nif any other intervening circumstance showing the non-existence of such\ntreatment is not brought on record, before such alleged treatment and the date of\ndeath. It does not, however, mean that such time can be stretched to any period.\nProximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand\nand the consequential death is required to be proved by the prosecution. The\ndemand of dowry, cruelty or harassment based upon such demand and the date\nof death should not be too remote in time which, under the circumstances, be\ntreated as having become stale enough.”\n\n19. The above principle was reaffirmed in\nRajinder Singh v. State of\n\nPunjab24\n, to the effect that once the prosecution establishes the ingredients of\n\nSection 304-B\nIPC, the presumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act\n\nmust be drawn. The words “soon before her death” have to be understood in a\n\npractical manner, and the proximity of the cruelty to the death must be\n\nestablished to invoke the presumption. The following paragraphs are apposite:\n\n“24… Days or months are not what is to be seen. What must be borne in mind is\nthat the word \"soon\" does not mean \"immediate\". A fair and pragmatic\nconstruction keeping in mind the great social evil that has led to the enactment\nof Section 304B would make it clear that the expression is a relative expression.\nTime-lags may differ from case to case. All that is necessary is that the demand\nfor dowry should not be stale but should be the continuing cause for the death of\nthe married woman under Section 304-B.\n\n25…\nWe hasten to add that this is not a correct reflection of the law. \"Soon before\" is\nnot synonymous with \"immediately before\".”\n\n20. This Court in\nBaijnath v. State of M.P.25\n, clarified the scope and\n\noperation of the presumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act in\n\nconjunction with\nSection 304B\nIPC. The relevant paragraphs are usefully\n\nextracted below:\n(2015) 6 SCC 477\n(2017) 1 SCC 101\n“24. …As the prosecution is on the charge of the offences envisaged in Sections\n304B and 498A of the Code, the provisions for reference are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“304B. Dowry death.-(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any\nburns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal\ncircumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that\nsoon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her\nhusband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any\ndemand for dowry, such death shall be called “dowry death”, and such\nhusband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.\nExplanation.-. For the purpose of this sub-section, “dowry” shall have\nthe same meaning as in\nsection 2\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28\nof 1961).\n\n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment\nfor a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend\nto imprisonment for life.\n\n…\n\n498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\ncruelty.—Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a\nwoman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also\nbe liable to fine.\n\nExplanation.—For the purposes of this section, “cruelty” means—\n\n(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the\nwoman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb\nor health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or\n\n(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to\ncoercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand\nfor any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or\nany person related to her to meet such demand.”\n\n25. Whereas in the offence of dowry death defined by Section 304B of the Code,\nthe ingredients thereof are:\n\n(i) death of the woman concerned is by any burns or bodily injury or by\nany cause other than in normal circumstances, and\n\n(ii) is within seven years of her marriage, and\n\n(iii) that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or any relative of the husband for, or in\nconnection with, any demand for dowry.\n\nThe offence under Section 498A of the Code is attracted qua the husband or his\nrelative if she is subjected to cruelty. The Explanation to this Section exposits\n“cruelty” as:\n(i) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the\nwoman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb\nor health (whether mental or physical) or\n\n(ii) harassment of the woman, where such harassment is with a view to\ncoercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand\nfor any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or\nany person related to her to meet such demand.\n\n26. Patently thus, cruelty or harassment of the lady by her husband or his\nrelative for or in connection with any demand for any property or valuable\nsecurity as a demand for dowry or in connection therewith is the common\nconstituent of both the offences.\n\n27. The expression “dowry” is ordained to have the same meaning as in\nSection\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The expression “cruelty”, as explained,\ncontains in its expanse, apart from the conduct of the tormentor, the\nconsequences precipitated thereby qua the lady subjected thereto. Be that as it\nmay, cruelty or harassment by the husband or any relative of his for or in\nconnection with any demand of dowry, to reiterate, is the gravamen of the two\noffences.\n\n28.\nSection 113B\nof the Act enjoins a statutory presumption as to dowry death in\nthe following terms:\n\n“113B. Presumption as to dowry death.-. When the question is whether\na person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that\nsoon before her death such woman has been subjected by such person to\ncruelty or harassment for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry,\nthe Court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death.\n\nExplanation.-. For the purpose of this section, “dowry death” shall have\nthe same meaning as in\nsection 304B\nof the Indian Penal Code (45 of\n1860)”\n\n29. Noticeably this presumption as well is founded on the proof of cruelty or\nharassment of the woman dead for or in connection with any demand for dowry\nby the person charged with the offence. The presumption as to dowry death thus\nwould get activated only upon the proof of the fact that the deceased lady had\nbeen subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand\nfor dowry by the accused and that too in the reasonable contiguity of death.\nSuch a proof is thus the legislatively mandated prerequisite to invoke the\notherwise statutorily ordained presumption of commission of the offence of\ndowry death by the person charged therewith.\n30. A conjoint reading of these three provisions, thus predicate the burden of the\nprosecution to unassailably substantiate the ingredients of the two offences by\ndirect and convincing evidence so as to avail the presumption engrafted in\n\nSection 113B\nof the Act against the accused. Proof of cruelty or harassment by\nthe husband or her relative or the person charged is thus the sine qua non to\ninspirit the statutory presumption, to draw the person charged within the coils\nthereof. If the prosecution fails to demonstrate by cogent coherent and\npersuasive evidence to prove such fact, the person accused of either of the above\nreferred offences cannot be held guilty by taking refuge only of the presumption\nto cover up the shortfall in proof.\n\n31. The legislative primature of relieving the prosecution of the rigour of the\nproof of the often practically inaccessible recesses of life within the guarded\nconfines of a matrimonial home and of replenishing the consequential void, by\naccording a presumption against the person charged, cannot be overeased to\ngloss-over and condone its failure to prove credibly, the basic facts enumerated\nin the Sections involved, lest justice is the casualty.\n\n32. This Court while often dwelling on the scope and purport of Section 304B of\nthe Code and\nSection 113B\nof the Act have propounded that the presumption is\ncontingent on the fact that the prosecution first spell out the ingredients of the\noffence of Section 304B as in\nShindo Alias Sawinder Kaur and another v. State\nof Punjab26\nand echoed in\nRajeev Kumar v. State of Haryana\n27. In the latter\npronouncement, this Court propounded that one of the essential ingredients of\ndowry death under Section 304B of the Code is that the accused must have\nsubjected the woman to cruelty in connection with demand for dowry soon\nbefore her death and that this ingredient has to be proved by the prosecution\nbeyond reasonable doubt and only then the Court will presume that the accused\nhas committed the offence of dowry death under\nSection 113B\nof the Act.\n\nIt\nreferred to with approval, the earlier decision of this Court in\nK. Prema S. Rao\nv. Yadla Srinivasa Rao28\nto the effect that to attract the provision of Section 304B\nof the Code, one of the main ingredients of the offence which is required to be\nestablished is that “soon before her death” she was subjected to cruelty and\nharassment “in connection with the demand for dowry”.\n(2011) 11 SCC 517\n(2013) 16 SCC 640\n(2003) 1 SCC 217\n21.\nIn\nShabeen Ahmad v. State of U.P.29\n, this Court cautioned that the grant\n\nof bail in dowry death cases, despite strong incriminating material, undermines\n\npublic confidence in the justice delivery system. The Court observed that in\n\ncases of dowry death, courts must remain alive to the broader societal\n\nramifications, as such offences strike at the very root of social justice and\n\ngender equality. Permitting alleged prime perpetrators of such heinous crimes to\n\nremain at liberty on bail, when evidence indicates active infliction of physical as\n\nwell as mental cruelty, may not only jeopardize the fairness of the trial but also\n\nerode public faith in the administration of criminal justice.\n\n22. Thus, the present case squarely falls within the category of annulment of\n\nbail. The High Court’s omission to consider the gravity of the offence, the\n\ncorroborated dying declarations and the post-mortem evidence renders the\n\nimpugned order perverse and unsustainable. As held in\nPuran v. Rambilas\n, bail\n\norders passed in disregard of material evidence or settled principles are liable to\n\nbe set aside.\n\nThis Court in\nChaman Lal v. State of U.P. and another\n30, clearly\n\nobserved:\n\n“11. Though a conclusive finding in regard to the points urged by the parties is\nnot expected of the court considering the bail application, yet giving reasons is\ndifferent from discussing merits or demerits. As noted above, at the stage of\ngranting bail a detailed examination of evidence and elaborate documentation\nof the merits of the case is not to be undertaken. But that does not mean that\nwhile granting bail some reasons for prima facie concluding why bail was being\ngranted is not required to be indicated.”\n(2025) 4 SCC 172\n(2004) 7 SCC 525\n23. Dowry death is not merely an offence against an individual but a crime\n\nagainst society at large. As emphasized in Social Action Forum for\nManav\n\nAdhikar v. Union of India31\n, the alarming rise in such cases necessitates strict\n\njudicial scrutiny. Permitting the accused to remain at large in the face of such\n\nmaterial would erode the deterrent object of\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC.\n\n24. In view of the foregoing, the impugned order of the High Court is liable\n\nto be set aside, and the bail granted to Respondent No. 1 deserves to be\n\nannulled.\n\n25. This Court cannot lose sight of the fact that marriage, in its true essence,\n\nis a sacred and noble institution founded on mutual trust, companionship, and\n\nrespect. However, in recent times, this pious bond has regrettably been reduced\n\nto a mere commercial transaction. The evil of dowry, though often sought to be\n\ncamouflaged as gifts or voluntary offerings, has in reality become a means to\n\ndisplay social status and to satiate material greed.\n\n25.1. The social evil of dowry not only corrodes the sanctity of marriage but\n\nalso perpetuates systemic oppression and subjugation of women. When such\n\ndemands transgress the bounds of reason and culminate in cruelty – or worse, in\n\nthe untimely death of a young bride – the offence transcends the private sphere\n\nof the family and assumes the character of a grave social crime. It ceases to\n(2018) 10 SCC 443\nremain a mere personal tragedy and becomes an affront to the collective\n\nconscience of society.\n\n25.2. The phenomenon of dowry deaths represents one of the most abhorrent\n\nmanifestations of this social malaise, where the life of a young woman is\n\nextinguished within her matrimonial home – not for any fault of her own, but\n\nsolely to satisfy the insatiable greed of others. Such heinous offences strike at\n\nthe very root of human dignity and violate the constitutional guarantees of\n\nequality and life with dignity under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia. They corrode the moral fibre of the community, normalize violence\n\nagainst women, and erode the foundations of a civilized society.\n\n25.3. In this backdrop, this Court is constrained to observe that judicial\n\npassivity or misplaced leniency in the face of such atrocities would only\n\nembolden perpetrators and undermine public confidence in the administration of\n\njustice. A firm and deterrent judicial response is, therefore, imperative – not\n\nonly to uphold the majesty of law and do justice in the present case, but also to\n\nsend an unequivocal message that neither law nor society will countenance\n\nbarbarities born out of the evil of dowry.\n\n26. With the above observations, this Criminal Appeal is allowed and the\n\nimpugned order of the High Court is set aside. The bail granted to Respondent\n\nNo. 1 is hereby cancelled, and he is directed to surrender to custody forthwith,\n\nfailing which, the concerned authorities shall take him into custody\nimmediately. It is, however, clarified that this judgment is confined to the issue\n\nof cancellation of bail, and the trial shall proceed independently, on its own\n\nmerits, and strictly in accordance with law.\n\n27. Connected Miscellaneous Application(s), if any, stand disposed of.\n\n…………………………J.\n[B.V. NAGARATHNA]\n\n…………………………J.\n[R. MAHADEVAN]\n\nNEW DELHI;\n\nNOVEMBER 28, 2025",
