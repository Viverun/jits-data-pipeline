Brief facts of the case are that the appellant-plaintiff entered\n\ninto an agreement for sale on 06.09.1983 which was registered in\n\nBook No.1 at Serial No. 1497 before the Sub-Registrar, Amreli. The\n\nagreement to sale was made by one Babubhai Karshanbhai Senjaliya\n\nin favour of the President Manohardas Karsandas Singada in respect\n\nof the proposed Kalyannagar Co-operative Housing Society.\n\n Page 2 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n3.1 The appellant- Kalyannagar Cooperative Housing Society was\n\nregistered under \nsection 9\n of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies\n\nAct,1961, by the Registration Officer, Amreli vide Registration No.\n\nGJ-9234.\n\n3.2 As per the terms recorded in the agreement for sale the\n\ndefendant-respondent herein agreed to sale the land admeasuring 9\n\nAcres i.e. 36422 sq.mtrs of Survey No. 120/2 Paiki which is\n\nestimated to 15 Vighas 06 vasa for consideration of Rs. 20,000/- per\n\nvigha.

Accordingly, the\n\napplication was made before the Deputy Collector who by order\n\ndated 10.06.1984, granted permission to the plaintiff-society to\n\npurchase the land and a permission was also granted to the original\n\nowners to sell their land i.e. total area of 11 Acres 17 Gunthas\n\ncomprising of 9Acre of Revenue Survey No. 122/2 and 2 Acres 17\n\nGunthas of Survey No. 120/4 with certain terms and conditions.\n\n3.5 Thereafter, it appears that the sale deed dated 16.07.1984 was\n\nexecuted by Babubhai Karsanbhai Senjaliya in favour of\n\nManohardas Karsandas Singada, President of the plaintiff-society\n\nwith consideration of Rs. 1,31,000/- by registered sale deed for land\n\nadmeasuring 3 Acre and 33 Gunthas of Survey No. 120/2 i.e.\n\n6 vighas and 11 vasa, 15479 sq.mtrs situated on Varsada road of\n\nAmreli and possession of the said land was handed over to the\n\nPresident of the plaintiff-society.\n\n Page 4 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n3.6 It appears that thereafter, on 29.06.1984, the Special Land\n\nAcquisition Officer, Amreli, wrote a letter to the Executive\n\nEngineer, Gujarat Housing Board, intimating him to remain present\n\nfor acquisition of the land including the land of Survey Nos. 120/2\n\nand 120/4 comprising land admeasuring 9 Acres was agreed to be\n\nsold to plaintiff-society.\n\n3.7 Revenue Entries No. 504 was mutated in village Form No. 6\n\nwith regard to registered sale deed executed on 16.07.1984 for land\n\nadmeasuring 3 Acres 33 Gunthas in favour of the plaintiff-society of\n\nSurvey No. 120/2.\n\n3.8 It is pertinent to note that another suit being No. 37/1999 was\n\nfiled before the same Court for enforcement of Agreement of Sale\n\nfor 2 Acres and 17 Gunthas of Survey No. 120/4 which was running\n\nin the name of son of the defendant-original owner by the plaintiff\n\nsociety. The defendant preferred application under Order VII Rule\n\n11 of the Code which was also rejected by the Court below against\n\nwhich the appeal is pending before the District Court as the suit\n\nvalue was less than the prescribed limit.\n\n Page 5 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n3.9 It appears that thereafter, the plaintiff as well as the defendant\n\nchallenged acquisition of the land including the land in question\n\nbefore this Court wherein a compromise was arrived at between the\n\nplaintiff and the original owner-defendant that the Gujarat Housing\n\nBoard and the plaintiff-society paid and deposited Rs. 67,000/-\n\ntowards establishment and miscellaneous expenses of Rs. 6,000/-\n\ntowards legal expenses in Current Account No. 3981 of Executive\n\nEngineer of Gujarat Housing Board, Bhavnagar as a condition\n\nprecedent to withdraw the acquisition proceedings.\n\n3.10 By letter dated 19.06.1996 written by the Housing\n\nCommissioner, Gujarat Housing Board to Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer, it was informed that the Board in its meeting dated\n\n11.10.1990 vide Resolution No. 2214 has resolved to exempt the\n\nland of Survey No. 120 Paiki from the acquisition with any other\n\nGovernment land available at Amreli.\n\n3.11 The Land Acquisition Officer, by letter dated 30.06.1994\n\naddressed to defendant informed that the land of Survey No. 120\n\n Page 6 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\nPaiki is exempted from acquisition as per order dated 21.03.1994 of\n\nthe Revenue Department.\n\n3.12 It appears that thereafter the Collector, Amreli, by order dated\n\n10.10.1994 ordered to convert the land situated Survey Nos. 120/2\n\nand 120/4 into non-agriculture land for residential purpose and\n\npermission was granted to construct the residential house on the\n\napplication dated 24.11.1993 filed by the President of the plaintiff-\n\nsociety for land admeasuring 5 Acres 4 Gunthas.\n\n3.13 It appears that thereafter, the suit was filed in the year 1999 for\n\nspecific performance of the Agreement to Sale executed on\n\n06.09.1983 along with the documents which are referred to here-in-\n\nabove by the plaintiff.\n\n3.14 It also emerges from the record that the plaintiff thereafter\n\namended the plaint twice, once in the year 2000 and thereafter in the\n\nyear 2007 which was allowed by the Court below by passing a\n\nreasoned order at the relevant time. The issues were framed by the\n\nCourt below on 15.01.2010.\n\n Page 7 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n3.15 It appears that application Exh 205 preferred by the\n\nrespondent-defendant under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) of the\n\nCode was rejected by the Court below initially on the ground that\n\nreadable copy of the amended plaint was not provided by the\n\ndefendant. However, thereafter, an application was made under\n\nOrder 47 read with \nsection 151\n of the Code being application Exh.\n\n243 which was considered without disturbing the order passed below\n\nExh. 2057 and application Exhibits 205 and 243 were again heard\n\nand disposed of by the impugned order by allowing the same by\n\nrejecting the suit under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) of the Code.\n\n4. Learned advocate Mr. S.P.Majmudar appearing for the\n\nappellant- original plaintiff submitted that the learned Judge has\n\ncommitted a grave error in allowing the application Exhibits 205 and\n\n243 together by depriving the appellant from challenging the order\n\nof recall before the appropriate forum as originally the application\n\nunder Order VII Rule 11 of the Code was already dismissed by the\n\nCourt below and without recalling that order, the Court could not\n\nhave again passed the order allowing such applications nor a\n\n Page 8 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\ncommon order could have been passed and therefore, the impugned\n\norder suffers from vice of procedural lapses on the part of the Courts\n\nbelow.\n\n4.1 It was further submitted that even on merits of the case for\n\nrejecting the suit, provisions of Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the\n\nCode would not apply in the facts of the case as the suit cannot be\n\nsaid to be barred by law more particularly, when on bare perusal of\n\nthe plaint as well as the documents in connection therewith raises a\n\nmixed question of fact and law with regard to enforceability of the\n\nAgreement for Sale which was alleged to have been executed by a\n\nproposed society coupled with other documents produced on record\n\nwhich ratified such agreement for sale by subsequent conduct of the\n\ndefendant permitting the appellant-society to make an application for\n\npermission under \nsection 63\n before the Deputy Collector for\n\nconversion of the land into non-agriculture the land in question\n\nwhich was already granted after arriving at compromise with the\n\nGujarat Housing Board to get the land exempted from the\n\nacquisition etc.\n\n Page 9 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n4.2 It was therefore submitted that the Court below could not have\n\nrejected the suit at threshold after more than 20 years by not giving\n\nliberty to the plaintiff to lead the evidence to prove its case, more\n\nparticularly, when the issues are already framed by the Court.\n\n4.3 It was also pointed out that the made by the Court below is\n\narbitrary and contrary to the documents produced on record by the\n\nplaintiff in support of the averments made in the plaint. It was\n\nsubmitted that even if the amendments made in the plaint are not\n\ntaken into consideration, the original plaint itself would be sufficient\n\nas averments made in the original draft of the plaint along with the\n\ndocuments produced therewith would go to show that the plaintiff\n\nhas a very good arguable case before the amendment also which can\n\nbe proved by leading oral and documentary evidence.\n\n4.4 In support of his submissions he has relied upon the following\n\njudgements:\n\n \n \nSalim D.

On the other hand, learned Senior Advocate Mr. Mihir Thakore\n\nwith the learned advocate Mr. Kanabar submitted that the\n\napplication under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code can be preferred at\n\nany stage of the trial and therefore the contention raised on behalf of\n\nthe appellant herein that it was filed after more than 20 years is of no\n\nconsequence. It was further submitted that the plaint is covered\n\n Page 11 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\nunder the provision of Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the Code and\n\ntherefore, the same can be rejected by the Court at any stage.\n\n5.1 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore invited attention of the\n\nCourt to the amendments made in the plaint in the year 2000 as well\n\nas in year 2007 by the plaintiff to point out that the such\n\namendments were made so as to wriggle out of the settled legal\n\nposition that no agreement for sale could have been made by the\n\nproposed society and such Agreement for Sale is void ab initio and\n\ntherefore, the same cannot be enforced by way of specific\n\nperformance. It was further submitted that amendments in paras 1A,\n\n1B and 1C when read together, the stand taken by the plaintiff is\n\ncontradictory to each other. In para 1A it was averred that the\n\nplaintiff relied upon the contract between the parties which was\n\ncarried out in the year 2000 and thereafter wisdom has prevailed\n\nupon the plaintiff by further amendment of the plaint by inserting\n\npara 1B which is again taking a stand that there was a deemed\n\nregistration of the society when the application for registration was\n\nmade by the society in the month of June 1983, prior to the date of\n\n Page 12 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\nAgreement for Sale on 06.09.1983 whereas further contradictory\n\nstand is taken in para 1C raising contention of oral agreement\n\nbetween the parties. It was therefore submitted that the plaintiffs\n\nhave from time-to-time changed their standby amending the plaint\n\nand therefore, the entire plaint is distorted and no decree of specific\n\nperformance can be passed on the basis of the bare perusal of the\n\naverments made in the plaint.\n\n5.2 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore also referred to\n\naverments made in para 4 of the plaint to point out that vague\n\naverments are made by the plaintiff with regard to refusal on part of\n\nthe defendants to execute the sale deed in the year 1999 so as to\n\novercome the question of limitation. It was submitted that it is\n\nnothing but a piece of clever drafting by the plaintiff and as per the\n\nsettled legal position, the plaintiff cannot take advantage of such\n\nclever drafting so as to avoid the action by the Court under Order\n\nVII Rule 11 of the Code.\n\n Page 13 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n5.3 It was also submitted by learned advocate Mr. Thakore that the\n\ndocuments produced along with plaint clearly shows that the\n\nplaintiff has played a mischief with the Court by producing only\n\nfirst page of the registered Sale Deed dated 16.07.2019 at Mark 4/5\n\nwhereas the entire sale deed was produced by the defendant later on\n\nat Exh 22. It was submitted that as such sale deed produced by the\n\ndefendant cannot be looked by the Court for deciding the\n\napplication under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code, the same is not\n\nreferred to however, suffice is to say that the plaintiff, for the\n\nreasons best known to it, did not produce entire sale deed on record\n\nas it may be possible that there was only sale of 03 Acres and 33\n\nGunthas and not 9 Acres of Survey No. 120/2 for which the\n\nregistered Agreement to Sale was executed with the proposed\n\nsociety which cannot be enforced as per the settled legal position.\n\n5.4 It was further pointed out by learned Senior Advocate Mr.\n\nThakore that the Court below has therefore rightly came to the\n\nconclusion that the suit is barred by law under Order VII Rule 11(d)\n\nof the Code as no decree of specific performance can be granted in\n\n Page 14 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\nfavour of the plaintiff on the basis of the Agreement to Sale in\n\nfavour of the proposed society by relying upon the various decisions\n\nof this Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n5.5 In support of his submissions, Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore\n\nreferred to and relied upon the following decisions:\n\n \n \nCanara Bank vs. P. Selathal and ors\n reported in (2020) 13\n\n SCC 143:\n\n \"8. Therefore, the short question which is posed for\n consideration of this Court is, whether the suits filed by the\n plaintiffs were liable to be rejected in exercise of powers\n under Order 7 Rule 11(d) \nof the CPC\n or not?\n\n 9. While considering the aforesaid issue/question, few\n decisions of this Court on exercise of powers under Order 7\n Rule 11(d) \nof the CPC\n are required to be referred to and\n considered.\n\n 9.1 In the case of T. Arivandandam (supra), while\n considering the very same provision i.e. \nOrder 7 Rule 11 of\n the CPC\n and the decree of the trial Court in considering\n such application, this Court in para 5 has observed and held\n as under:\n\n Page 15 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n \"5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning\n the petitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the\n court repeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the\n statement of the facts found in the judgment of the High\n Court, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending\n before the First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant\n misuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints.\n The learned Munsif must remember that if on a\n meaningful - not formal - reading of the plaint it is\n manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not\n disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his\n power under \nOrder 7, Rule 11 CPC\n taking care to see\n that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if\n clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of\n action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining\n the party searchingly under \nOrder 10, CPC\n.

While scrutinizing the plaint averments, it is the\n bounden duty of the trial Court to ascertain the materials\n for cause of action. The cause of action is a bundle of\n facts which taken with the law applicable to them gives\n the plaintiff the right to relief against the defendant.\n Every fact which is necessary for the plaintiff to prove to\n enable him to get a decree should be set out in clear\n terms. It is worthwhile to find out the meaning of the\n words \"cause of action\".

Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A.P. Agencies,\n Salem\n (supra), this Court explained the meaning of \"cause\n of action\" as follows:\n\n \"12.A cause of action means every fact, which if\n traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove\n in order to support his right to a judgment of the court.\n In other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with\n the law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to\n relief against the defendant. It must include some act\n done by the defendant since in the absence of such an\n act no cause of action can possibly accrue. It is not\n limited to the actual infringement of the right sued on\n but includes all the material facts on which it is founded.\n It does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such\n facts, but every fact necessary for the plaintiff to prove\n to enable him to obtain a decree. Everything which is\n not proved would give the defendant a right to\n immediate judgment must be part of the cause of action.\n But it has no relation whatever to the defence which\n may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon\n the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff.\"\n\n 9.4 In the case of Sopan Sukhdeo Sable (supra) in paras 11\n and 12, this Court has observed as under:\n\n \"11. \nIn \nI.T.C. Ltd. v. Debts Recovery Appellate\n Tribunal\n [(1998) 2 SCC 70] it was held that the basic\n question to be decided while dealing with an application\n filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is whether a real\n cause of action has been set out in the plaint or\n something purely illusory has been stated with a view to\n get out of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code.\n\n Page 17 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n 12. The trial Court must remember that if on a\n meaningful and not formal reading of the plaint it is\n manifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of not\n disclosing a clear right to sue, it should exercise the\n power under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code taking care to\n see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. If\n clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of\n action, it has to be nipped in the bud at the first hearing\n by examining the party searchingly under Order 10 of\n the Code. (See T. Arivandandam (supra).\"\n\n 9.5 In the case of Madanuri Sri Rama Chandra Murthy\n (supra), this Court has observed and held as under:\n\n \"7. The plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 if\n conditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled.\n It is needless to observe that the power under \nOrder 7\n Rule 11 CPC\n can be exercised by the Court at any stage\n of the suit. The relevant facts which need to be looked\n into for deciding the application are the averments of the\n plaint only. If on an entire and meaningful reading of the\n plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious\n and meritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to\n sue, the court should exercise power under \nOrder 7 Rule\n 11 CPC\n. Since the power conferred on the court to\n terminate civil action at the threshold is drastic, the\n conditions enumerated under \nOrder 7 Rule 11 CPC\n to\n the exercise of power of rejection of plaint have to be\n strictly adhered to.

In order to make good his\n contention that such a contract is valid and\n enforceable at law, Mr. Vyas has invited our\n attention to some provisions of the \nGujarat\n Cooperative Societies Act, 1961\n. \nS. 2(13)\n defines\n \"member\" as a person joining in an application for\n the registration of a co-operative society which is\n subsequently registered, or a person duly admitted to\n membership of a society after registration and\n includes a nominal, associate or sympathiser\n member. \nS. 2(19)\n defines \"society\" which means a\n co-operative society registered or deemed to be\n registered, under this Act. A reference to a society\n \"deemed to be registered \" appears to be in the\n context of sub-see. (2) of\n S. 169\n. Sub-section (2) of\n \nS. 169\n provides as follows:-\n\n \"All societies registered or deemed to be registered\n under the said Act the registration of which was in\n force immediately before the commencement of\n this Act, shall on such commencement be deemed\n to be registered under this Act; and all proceedings\n pending immediately before such commencement\n before any Registrar, Arbitrator, liquidator or\n tribunal or other officer, authority or person under\n the provisions of the said Act shall stand\n transferred where necessary, to the Registrar,\n arbitrator, liquidator or tribunal or other\n corresponding officer, authority or person under\n this Act, and if no such officer, authority or person\n exists or if there be a doubt as to the corresponding\n officer, authority or person to such officer,\n authority or person as the State Govt. may\n designate and shall be continued and disposed of\n\n Page 27 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n by such officer, authority or person in accordance\n with the provisions of this Act.\"\n\n These three provisions to which Mr. Vyas has invited\n our attention do not warrant the conclusion that the\n society before it is registered and comes into existence\n can act through its promoter. \nSec. 37\n throws light on\n this aspect. It reads as follows:-\n\n \"A society on its registration shall be a body\n corporate by the name under which it is registered,\n\n -w1th perpetual succession and a common seal, and\n with power to acquire, hold and dispose of\n property, to enter into contracts, to institute and\n defend suits and other legal proceedings and to do\n all such things as are necessary for the purpose for\n which it is constituted.\"\n\n It is clear, therefore, that a co-operative society becomes\n a legal person after it is registered and it is after its\n registration that it acquires the capacity to enter into\n contracts. No provision in the Act has been pointed out\n to us under which the promoters of a society can act on\n behalf of the society before it has been registered and\n has come into existence.\n\n \nJayantilal Hansraj Shah and ors vs. Hemakuwarben\n\n Dolatraj Dave and ors\n reported in 1996(1) G.L.H. 893:\n\n \"10.

However, the learned Judge has failed to consider the\n\nfact that the documents produced along with the plaint together with\n\nthe averments made in the plaint prima facie shows that both the\n\nparties in effect has proceeded with the terms of the Agreement for\n\nSale that is to say applying for permission before the Deputy\n\nCollector to purchase the land and thereafter even NA permission\n\nwas granted on the application made by the plaintiff-society.\n\nTherefore, as per the settled legal position as analyzed here-in-below\n\n Page 31 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\nthe question which arises for consideration is as to whether the suit\n\ncan be said to be barred by law as per clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order\n\nVII of the Code would be a mixed question of fact or law or pure\n\nquestion of law arising from the averments made in the plaint\n\ntogether with the documents produced therewith.\n\n10. The Trial Court has recorded the conclusion in paras 17 to 20 as\n\nunder:\n\n \"17. Though, it is strongly argued by the Ld.

And facts and circumstances of\n present suit are such, which clear that issue of limitation is\n a pure question of law. When the suit and plaint itself\n clears that it is barred by the law and specifically the \nLaw\n of Limitation and the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act,\n 1961\n, it cannot be allowed to remain the present suit for\n further years in the Court.\n\n 18. No new fact is brought on record by the present\n application. At the stage of deciding the application of 0.7\n R.11, Court has to see the plaint and documentary\n evidences produced along with it only.

Cause of action mentioned in the present suit is\n illusory, false, vexatious and artificial. Hence, present suit\n deserves to be rejected under 0.7 R.11 (a) and (d).\n\n 19. Arguments led by the Ld. Advocate of the\n defendant are tenable and arguments led the Ld. Advocate\n of plaintiff are not tenable for the above mentioned\n reasons. Though, this Court had dismissed the Exh.205\n earlier for want of legible copy of the plaint on record but\n if defendant was not producing that and failed to produce\n that before this Court then plaintiff could produce that but\n it was no followed so. Hence, it was not only the fault of\n defendant who move present applications but also fault on\n the part of the plaintiff. Because, Exh.205 was not decided\n on merits, then this Court finds no infirmity in allowing the\n application moved at Exh.243 under Order-47, Rule-1 r/w\n \nSection 151\n of the Code. The scheme of the said provision\n does not violate in any manner, if the said application is\n allowed. And accordingly Exh.205 too, as discussed above.\n\n 20. In view of the above discussion, this Court is\n strongly of the opinion that present suit deserves to be\n rejected under the provisions of 0.7 R.11 (a) & (d) of the\n Code and hence, applications under Order 7, Rule 11(a) &\n\n (d) and under Order-47, Rule-1 r/w. \nSection 151\n of the\n Code deserves to be allowed. Hence, following order is\n passed under Exhs.205, 243 and Exh. 1:-\n\n ::ORDER::\n\n (1) Application at Exh.243 moved under Order-47, Rule-1\n r/w \nSection 151\n of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 is\n hereby allowed.\n\n Page 33 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n (2) Application at Exh.205 moved under Order 7, Rule\n 11(a) & (d) of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 is also\n allowed.\n\n (3) Present suit bearing Special Civil Suit No. 36/1999 is\n hereby rejected under Order 7. Rule 11 (a) & (d) of the\n Civil Procedure Code, 1908. (4) Copy of this order shall be\n kept along with the plaint of the suit.\"\n\n11. On perusal of the above conclusion the only observation made\n\nby the Trial Court is that when the suit and plaint itself declares that\n\nit is barred by law and specifically by law of limitation and provision\n\nof the \nGujarat Co-operative Societies Act\n, it cannot be allowed to\n\ncontinue. However, while arriving at such conclusion the Trial Court\n\nhas failed to consider the facts emerging from the plaint and the\n\ndocuments annexed therewith to the effect that the subsequent\n\nevents from 1983 till the date of filing of the suit reflected from the\n\naverments and documents annexed with the plaint clearly shows\n\nthat Agreement for Sale which is sought to be enforced under the\n\nprovisions of the \nSpecific Relief Act\n and the issue as to whether the\n\nsuit is barred by limitation requires leading of evidence as it involves\n\nthe mixed question of facts as well as law inasmuch as merely on\n\nbare perusal of the averments made in the plaint and the documents\n\n Page 34 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\nannexed therewith, the Court could not have come to the conclusion\n\nthat the suit is barred by law under Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of\n\nthe Code.\n\n12. Learned advocate for the appellant has relied upon the decision\n\nof the Apex Court in case of \nSalim D. Agboatwala and ors vs.\n\nShamalji Oddhavji Thakkar\n reported in 2021 SCC online SC 735\n\nwherein the Apex Court, after considering the provisions of \nsections\n\n25\n and \n25A\n of the Maharashtra and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 as\n\nwell the question of limitation has held as under:\n\n \"25. But the above contention of Shri Joshi overlooks an\n important facet of the case set up by the plaintiffs.\n According to the plaintiffs, the Estate was in the\n administration of the Court Receiver and that in collusion\n between the Court Receiver and the Revenue authorities,\n the sale as well as mutation took place without any notice\n to any of the interested parties. Collusion and fraud are the\n main planks on which the plaintiffs have built up their\n case. The question whether the order of the ALT and the\n sale certificate issued thereafter are the product of fraud\n and collusion, cannot be determined by the appellate or\n revisional authority under the Act. In any case it is\n contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that by\n virtue of \nSection 88B(1)(d)\n of the Act, none of the\n provisions of the Act, except a few, are applicable, \"to\n lands taken under management temporarily by the Civil,\n Revenue or Criminal Courts by themselves, or through\n\n Page 35 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n receivers appointed by them, till the decision of the title of\n the rightful owners\". The 7 AIR 1972 Bombay 122\n veracity of such argument has not been tested before the\n Trial Court or the High Court. We do not know whether the\n exemption under Section 88B was raised at all by the\n appellants/plaintiffs. But it is a legal issue which goes to\n the root of the matter. Therefore, the Civil Court's\n jurisdiction cannot be said to have been ousted completely.\n The Civil Court was obliged to see at least whether the\n appointment of a Receiver for the administration of the\n Estate of a deceased person would actually fall within the\n mandate of Clause(d) of Subsection(1) of Section 88B.\n\n 26. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Trial\n Court as well as the High Court were clearly in error in\n rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11(d). Hence, the\n appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the Trial\n Court as well as the High Court are set aside and the suit is\n restored to file. There will be no order as to costs.\"\n\n13. The Division Bench of this Court in First Appeal No. 884 of\n\n2020 in case of \nPushpaben Yogendraprasad Mahant vs.\n\nRavirajsingh Kiritsingh Jhala\n decided on 19.07.2021 held as\n\nunder:\n\n \"14.1 The Court has to read the entire plaint as a whole to\n find out whether it discloses a cause of action and if it\n does, then the plaint cannot be rejected by the Court\n exercising the powers under Order VII Rule 11 of the\n Code. Essentially, whether the plaint discloses a cause of\n action, is a question of fact which has to be gathered on the\n basis of the averments made in the plaint in its entirety\n taking those averments to be correct. A cause of action is a\n\n Page 36 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n bundle of facts which are required to be proved for\n obtaining relief and for the said purpose, the material facts\n are required to be stated but not the evidence except in\n certain cases where the pleadings relied on are in regard to\n misrepresentation, fraud, wilful default, undue influence or\n of the same nature. So long as the plaint discloses some\n cause of action which requires determination by the court,\n mere fact that in the opinion of the Judge the plaintiff may\n not succeed cannot be a ground for rejection of the plaint.\n\n 14.2 In the present case, the averments made in the plaint,\n as has been noticed by us, do disclose the cause of action\n and, therefore, the High Court has rightly said that the\n powers under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code cannot be\n exercised for rejection of the suit filed by the plaintiff-\n appellants.\n\n14.3 The Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nHardesh Ores (P) Ltd.,\n vs. Hade and Company\n (2007) 5 SCC 614 in Para 25\n observed as under:-\n\n \"25. The language of \nOrder VII Rule 11 CPC\n is quite clear\n and unambiguous. The plaint can be rejected on the ground\n of limitation only where the suit appears from the\n statement in the plaint to be barred by any law. Mr.\n Nariman did not dispute that \"law\" within the meaning of\n Clause (d) of Order VII Rule 11 must include the law of\n limitation as well. It is well settled that whether a plaint\n discloses a cause of action is essentially a question of fact,\n but whether it does or does not must be found out from\n reading the plaint itself. For the said purpose the averments\n made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be\n correct. The test is whether the averments made in the\n plaint if taken to be correct in their entirety a decree would\n be passed. \nThe averments made in the plaint as a whole\n have to be seen to find out whether Clause (d) of Rule 11\n\n Page 37 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n of Order VII is applicable. It is not permissible to cull out\n a sentence or a passage and to read it out of the context in\n isolation. Although it is the substance and not merely the\n form that has to be looked into, the pleading has to be\n construed as it stands without addition or subtraction of\n words or change of its apparent grammatical sense. As\n observed earlier, the language of Clause (d) is quite clear\n but if any authority is required, one may usefully refer to\n the judgments of this Court in \nLiverpool and London S.P.\n and I Association Ltd. v. M.V. Sea Success I and Anr.\n\n (\n2004)9SCC512 and Popat and Kotecha Property v. State\n Bank of India Staff Association\n (2005)7SCC510. \"\n\n 14.4 It appears that the Court below has not been able to\n understand the fine distinction between the plea that there\n was no cause of action for the suit and the plea that the\n plaint does not disclose a cause of of action. In the case on\n hand, on a fair reading of the application Ex.18 filed by the\n defendants under Order VII Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure\n Code it is clear that the case of the defendants is that the\n plaintiffs have no cause of action to file the suit. It is not\n specifically pleaded by the defendants that the plaint does\n not disclose any cause of action. The trial Judge has also\n not recorded any specified finding to this effect. It could\n be said that while adjudicating the application for rejection\n of plaint the trial Judge has actually adjudicated the entire\n suit, in other words the right, title and interest of the\n plaintiffs in the suit property. It is very unfortunate to note\n that the trial Court proceeds on the footing that the\n plaintiffs have not been able to establish their right, title or\n interest in the suit properties on the basis of or on the\n strength of the revenue records i.e. the entries in the\n revenue records. The trial Judge seems to be oblivious of\n the fact that the entries in the revenue records even\n otherwise do not confer any right, title or interest. How\n does the trial Judge expect the plaintiff to make good his\n case or establish his title on the basis of the revenue\n\n Page 38 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n records while deciding the application for rejection of the\n plaint at the instance of the defendants.\n\n 14.5 From the averments made in the plaint, it is clear that\n the plaintiffs have pleaded a cause of action for filing the\n suit seeking the reliefs stated in it i.e. not to say that the\n plaintiffs have cause of action to file the suit for the reliefs\n sought, that question is to be determined on the basis of\n materials (other than the plaint) which may be produced by\n the parties at appropriate stage in the suit. For the limited\n purpose of determining the question whether the plaint is\n to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 or not the\n averments in the plaint are only to be looked into.\n\n 14.6 The Court below observed that in absence of further\n revenue record prima facie title to the property cannot be\n accepted to be established. According to the Court below,\n the plaint does not disclose that Mahant Narandas was\n ancestor of Yogendraprasadji and the sale deed cannot be\n challenged on the ground that plaintiffs were successors by\n inheritance to the property. It is important to note that the\n issue for adjudication of rights in connection to the said\n plaint will be with regards to the original transfer of rights\n by Yogendraprasadji, Ramdasguru Bhagwandas, Mahant\n Narandas to the plaintiffs. The said issue for adjudication\n of rights flowing from the Will dated 1937 cannot be shut\n merely on the ground that there are no further revenue\n records reflecting the rights of the plaintiffs.\n\n 14.7 The suit is yet to go for trial and plaintiffs will have to\n prove by producing evidence to establish that they are\n successors of the subject property. The original entry no.\n 253 will be relevant for the plaintiffs to establish their right\n to the property by succession. It is drastic to reject the suit\n\n Page 39 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n at this stage, while considering the averments in the plaint\n which raises various issues as to flowing from the Will and\n inclusion of subject property in the Will.\"\n\n14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nShaukathussain\n\nMohammad Patel vs. Khatunben Mohmmedbhai Polara\n reported\n\nin (2019) 10 SCC 226 has held that the averment in the plaint have\n\nto be taken into account in their entirety and considering such\n\nevidence if the case is required to be considered on merits, rejection\n\nof plaint is not justified as it is well settled that for the purposes of\n\nthe provision of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code, the entirety of the\n\naverments in the plaint is to be taken into account and going by the\n\nversion of the appellant as detailed in the plaint, there was element\n\nof deception and fraud which was practiced upon him as a result of\n\nwhich the document concerned got entered into. In the facts of the\n\nsaid case and considering such averments made in the plaint and the\n\nfact that the plaintiff-appellant was always in possession of the\n\nproperty in question the issue raised in the matter was required to be\n\nconsidered on merits.\n\n Page 40 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n15. \nIn case of \nSejal Glass Ltd vs. Navilan Merchants Pvt.

However, where it appears that plaint cannot be proceeded\n\nwith in some part but it can be proceeded in another part, Order VII\n\nRule 11 of the Code has no application and then suit as a whole must\n\nproceed to trial.\n\n \"20. \nIn the case of \nAhmed Hossein vs. Mt. Chembelli\n and others\n reported in AIR 1951 Cal 262, a decision\n relied upon by Mr. Thakore, the suit was on a\n dishonoured cheque. The plaint did not state that any\n notice of dishonour had been given or that any\n circumstances existed which rendered it unnecessary to\n give such notice. The plaintiff subsequently sought to\n introduce these statements in the plaint by an\n amendment. The application was opposed by the\n defendants on the ground that by reason of the absence\n of these allegations, the plaint as it stood then, disclosed\n no cause of action and hence it must be rejected under O.\n 7, R. 11 (a) of the Code and the Court had no power to\n allow the amendment. The plaintiff's answer was two\n fold : First the plaint disclosed a cause of action in spite\n of the omission to state anything with regard to the\n notice of dishonour and secondly, that O. 7, R. 11, does\n not take away the Court's power to order amendment of\n\n Page 41 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n the plaint. With regard to the first point, the plaintiff's\n contention was that the facts relating to the notice of\n dishonour were not part of the cause of action on a\n dishonoured cheque but were mere conditions precedent\n necessary for the case on the cheque, the performance or\n occurrence of which is to be implied in the plaint under\n O. 6, R. 6 of the Code. Sarkar J (as His Lordship then\n was) did not accept this contention. His Lordship made\n the following observations in this connection:\n\n \"A cause of action is that bundle of facts which would,\n if left to itself, create in law a right or obligation, while a\n condition precedent is something which prevents the\n right or obligation which would have otherwise sprung\n out from those facts from springing out. A condition\n precedent has thus been described in the notes to O. 19,\n R. 14 in the White Book:\n\n \"Cases constantly occur in which, although everything\n has happened which would at common law prima facie\n entitle a man to a certain sum of money, or vest in him a\n certain right of action there is yet something more which\n must be done or something more which must happen in\n the particular case before he is entitled to sue either by\n reason of the provisions of some statute, or because the\n parties have expressly so agreed; this something more is\n called a condition precedent. It is not of the essence of\n such a cause of action, but it has been made essential. It\n is an additional formality superimposed on the common\n law.\"\n\n \nI would in the above quotation add to the words\n \"common law\" the words \"or statute.\" Now the liability\n of the drawer of a cheque arises under\n S. 30\n, Negotiable\n Instruments Act, and except as \nlaid down in\n that section\n the drawer of a dishonoured cheque has no liability. This\n\n Page 42 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n is because the whole law as to cheques is contained in\n that Act and the only section dealing with the liability of\n the drawer of a cheque is\n S. 30\n. The section provides\n that the drawer of a cheque shall be liable to compensate\n the holder in case of dishonour \"provided due notice of\n dishonour has been given to, or received by, the drawer\n as hereinafter provided.\" \nSections 91\n to \n98\n of the Act lay\n down the provisions relating to the manner of the giving\n of the notice of dishonour and the cases where the\n giving of the notice is excused. The only way therefore\n in which liability on a cheque may arise is when (1) the\n cheque is dishonoured and (2) notice of such dishonour\n has been given or circumstances exist which render it\n unnecessary to give such notice. It is not a case where if\n no provisions as to notice of dishonour had been laid\n down, a right would have arisen in the holder on the\n dishonour of the cheque and where the only effect of\n those provisions is to prevent such right from springing\n up. The notice of dishonour as the law as to cheques\n stands is a part of the cause of action on a dishonoured\n cheque.\n In Fruhauf v. Grosvenor and Co., (1892) 67 I. T.\n 350: (61 L. J. Q. B. 717), Lord Coleridge C. J.,\n expressed himself in these words:\n\n \"The obligation upon the drawer of a cheque to pay does\n not arise until notice of dishonour thereof has been\n given to him, and therefore the statement of the case\n against the defendant here is not full and complete\n without either an allegation of notice of dishonour of the\n cheque having been given to the defendant the drawer of\n it, or of facts excusing the plaintiff from giving such\n notice.\"\n\n It was decided in this case that in the absence of the\n allegations as to the notice of dishonour, the plaint on a\n dishonoured cheque would not disclose a cause of\n action.\"\n\n Page 43 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n 21. We respectfully agree with the above view. In the\n case before us, if we apply the above principles, the\n permission of the Charity Commissioner is not of the\n essence of a cause of action, but it has been made\n essential. It is an additional formality superimposed\n which prevents the right or obligation which would have\n otherwise sprung out from those facts from springing\n out. Thus, by taking aid of the above decision it cannot\n be legitimately contended that grant of permission is the\n cause of action like dishonour of a cheque in an action\n for dishonour of cheque; on the other hand, it is a\n condition precedent for enforcement of the right which\n is the subject-matter of the suit and thus, Order 6 Rule 6\n clearly applies.\"\n\n16. From the above conspectus of law, it emerges that while\n\nconsidering the Order VII Rule 11 of the Code only the averment\n\nmade in the plaint is required to be considered along with the\n\ndocuments produced with the plaint and it has to be borne out from\n\nthe facts of the case that the entire suit is barred by law including the\n\nlimitation and no cause of action could be disclosed from the\n\naverments made in the plaint.\n\n17. In the facts of the case however it is difficult to come to the\n\nconclusion that there is no cause of action averred in the plaint, more\n\nparticularly, in view of the events which have taken place from 1983\n\n Page 44 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\ntill 1999 before filing the suit i.e. from the date of Agreement for\n\nSale till date of filing of the suit as it is reflected from the averments\n\nas well as the documents annexed with the plaint which requires\n\nscrutiny on merits after giving opportunity to the both the sides to\n\nlead the evidence. \nIn such circumstances, reliance placed by learned\n\nSenior Advocate Mr. Thakore on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in case of \nDahiben vs. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali\n (\nsupra)\n\nand Canara Bank vs. P. Selathal\n (supra) and the decision of this\n\nCourt in case of \nShri Ramji Mandir Narsinhji vs. Narsinh Nagar Co-\n\noperative \nHousing Society Ltd.\n (supra) would not be applicable.\n \nIn\n\ncase of \nDahiben vs Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali\n (supra), the Apex\n\nCourt has held that it was a case of a classic clever drafting of the\n\nplaint attempted to make out an illusionary cause of action and bring\n\nthe suit within the period of limitation whereas in the facts of the\n\ncase, even if the subsequent amendments are not taken into\n\nconsideration, it cannot be said that it is case of clever drafting\n\ninasmuch as the averments made in the plaint requires to be\n\nconsidered after providing an opportunity to both the sides to lead\n\nthe evidence.\n Similarly, in case of Canara Bank vs. P. Selathal\n\n Page 45 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\n(supra) considering the facts of the case and the averments made in\n\nthe plaint as the specific remedy was provided under the provisions\n\nof the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 and there was\n\ninordinate delay of 15 years in challenging the action of the bank, in\n\nsuch circumstances, it was held by the Apex Court that the suit was\n\nbarred by law under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. Whereas in the\n\npresent case, merely because it is alleged by the defendant that the\n\nsuit is barred by law as the Agreement for Sale is prior to the date of\n\nregistration of the plaintiff-society, the suit could not have been\n\nrejected as such contention is required to be tested by leading\n\nevidence.\n\n18. In view of the foregoing reasons, the impugned order passed by\n\nthe Principal Senior Civil Judge, Amreli dated 05.08.2021 below\n\nExhibit 205 is hereby quashed and set aside without adjudicating as\n\nto whether the Court below could have re-decided Exh 205\n\nsimultaneously, while considering the review application filed under\n\nOrder 47 read with \nsection 151\n of the Code and allowing the\n\napplication Exh 243 and dismissing the suit by allowing the\n\n Page 46 of 47\n\n Downloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\n undefined\n\napplication Exh 205 which was already dismissed earlier.
