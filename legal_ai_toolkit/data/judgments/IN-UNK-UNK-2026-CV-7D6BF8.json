POINT NO.1:- According to the prosecution Preethy\nAcharya is the wife of the accused No.1 by name Chandrashekar\nand there was disputed between them, hence she lodged\ncomplaint against her husband Chandrashekar alleging that\naccused no.1 Chandrashekar is harassing her physically and\nmentally and he is also not giving share in his property and hence\nA1 was sent to jail for sometime and after release on the bail\nunder the vengeance of sending him to jail he has developed\nenmity against Preethy Acharya and in this regard the accused\nno.1 hatched plan to kill Preethy Acharya and her relative Veda\nand conspired with A2 Prabhakar and on 17/18.04.2013 at about\n1.00 AM in the night A1 at his house under the influence of alcohol\nassaulted his wife Preethy Acharya with rod on her head for about\n6 to 7 times and when her cousin Veda intervened he assaulted\nwith same rod to her for about 6 to 7 times and killed them on the\nspot itself.\n\n 9. The prosecution in order to prove the death of both\nPreethy Acharya and Veda has examined PW.26 the Doctor who\nhas conducted the PM examination on the dead bodies of Preethy\nAcharya and Veda and also given report as per Ex.P.47 and 50.\n\n 6\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nThe said PW. 26 Dr. Naveen Kumar conducted PM examination on\ndead bodies of Preethy Acharya and Veda on the request from the\npolice.

In order to substantiate injuries are cause on the dead\nbody of both ladies, the prosecution examined PW.27, the\nTahsildar who has conducted mahazar on the dead body of\nPreethy Acharya. He has depose that he has received requisition\nas per Ex.P.55 to conduct mahazar on the deceased and further\nhe recorded statements of Amith, Vikram. The said mahazar was\nsigned by PW. 22 and 23.\n\n 10. The defense mainly A1 cross examined all the\nwitnesses. During the cross-examination of PW. 26 Dr. Naveen\nKumar, it is tried to elicit that there is a procedural lapse on the\npart of PW. 26 while conducting PM examination. It is also tried to\nelicit that the mahazar was conducted 10 days earlier to the\n\n 10\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nalleged murder pointing at the date mentioned in PM report i.e.\n\n8.4.2013. However PW. 26 denied the said suggestions. Further it\nis also suggested that the PM report was fabricated as per the\nconvenience of the IO in order to implicate the accused. The said\nsuggestion was denied by the witness.\n\n 11. Subsequently the advocate for A1 and A2 cross\nexamined PW. 26. However there is no much cross-examination\nin respect of the injuries but cross-examination in the line of\nweapon use in the said crime. Further defense also cross\nexamined PW. 27 and it is tried to elicit the lapse on the part of\nPW. 27 with respect to conducting of mahazar Ex.P.27. There is no\nmuch cross-examination in respect of the injuries cause on the\ndead body of both deceased. Rest of the cross-examination is in\nrespect of the denial of the statements.\n\n 12. Even the defense also cross examined PW. 21 to 23.\nOn appreciation of the entire material on record PW. 26 Dr.\nNaveen Kumar after conducting the entire PM examination on\ndead bodies, he has opined and gave report to the effect that the\ninjuries found on dead body of Preethy Acharya and Veda were\nante mortem and he depose that there are lacerated wounds on\nthe head, ear, forehead of deceased and in respect of internal\ninjuries he depose that contuse over right temporo-parietal\nregions measuring 14x4cms. Right temporalis muscle contuse.\n\n Skull: Linear fracture present in the middle cranial fossa\npassing through and through dividing the base of the skull into 2\nhalves, measuring 16 cms. Meninges: Torn at fractured sites, Brain\n& Spinal Cord: Brain- covered by subdural and subarachnoid\nhaemorrhage present all over the cerebral hemisphere. The said\n\n 11\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nevidence of PW. 26 is corroborated with the evidence of PW. 27\nand the inquest mahazar Ex.P.41 an 42.\n\n 13. On appreciation of evidence coupled with the P.M report\nand other documents such as Ex.P.41 and 42 and mahazar\nEx.P.55 it can be said the wounds are caused due to assault by\nthe weapon. It is clear from the cross-examination of this witness\nby the defense that, the defense does not dispute the death as\nhomicidal. The answers elicited from the witnesses mainly PW. 26\nand 27 do give clear picture that homicidal death has not been\ndisputed. All that which is tried to elicit from PW. 26 is with regard\nto weapon use. The defense cross examined PW. 26 regarding the\nweapon use in the commission of the crime. PW. 26 during his\nexamination in chief depose that he has received requisition letter\nfrom P.I. to furnish opinion regarding weapon for commission of\noffence. The said requisition is marked as Ex.P.52. He further\ndepose that he has received weapon an iron rod packed and\nsealed. The said iron rod measures 37.5 cm in length 9 cm in\ncircumference, 2 cm in diameter weighing 1800 grams and reddish\nbrown colour stains present over the surface of the weapon at\nplaces. He opined that the external injuries from 1 to 7 and\nexternal and internal head injury could be cause by the type of\nweapon examined, leading to fatal head injury causing death of\nPreethy Acharya. He opined regarding PM report No. 178/2013 dt.\n18.04.2013\n\n 14. He further depose that regarding PM report No.\n179/2013 dt. 18.04.2013 he opined that the external injuries from\n1 to 7 and external and internal head injury could be cause by the\n\n 12\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\ntype of weapon examined, leading to fatal head injury and causing\ndeath of Veda.\n\n 15. accused No.1 cross examined the witness and in the\ncross-examination he tried to elicit that the weapon which was\nexamined by PW. 26 is not a weapon use for commission of\noffence. The line of cross-examination is that the measurement in\ncentimeters and diameters is contrary to each other. The said\nsuggestion was denied by PW. 26. It is further suggested that\ncircumference of an object is always triple times of its diameter\nand as per the universal principal the circumference is always 3.1\ntime of diameter, which is pi value. He denied that instead of\nmentioning 6cm of circumference he has mentioned 9cm. He also\ndenied the suggestion that he has not received the iron rod and\nhe has not examined. That he has given false report and he has\nnot examined the rod M.O.15. He has not measured the\ndimensions of the rod vide length, circumference, diameter and\nweight and he has not mentioned the kind of the surface of the\nrod in his report, so also the nature of edges of the rod. He has\ndenied all suggestions.\n\n 16. He further denied the suggestions that the injuries\nsustained by both the deceased are not cause by the MO 15\nandthe injuries mentioned in the PM report are caused only when\nassault is made with a long, thin rod or object with sufficient force\nand the external injury No.1 as mentioned in Ex.P.47 and external\ninjury No.4 as mentioned in Ex.P.50 are only cause by using sharp\nedged object and he also denied the suggestion that whenever\nassault is made through a blunt object parallel Linier contusions\n\n 13\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nare cause and the skin is smashed and cross ruptured when hit\nby blunt object with heavy force. He further denied the suggestion\nthat he has not examined the genitical organs of both the\ndeceased. He has admitted that before conducting PM\nexamination he has prepared the notes on findings on the dead\nbody but he has not produce the same before the court. He further\ndenied the suggestion that PM examination is not done in\naccordance with protocol and opinion given as per the request of\nthe police in order to support their case and he has given false\nevidence.\n\n 17. On perusal of the cross-examination of this witness by\nA1 as well as his counsel they do not dispute regarding death of\nboth deceased, but they dispute regarding use of weapon in the\ncommission of crime. Further PW. 26 in his report specifically\nstated that the injuries mentioned in PM report found on the dead\nbody of both deceased could be caused by MO. 15 iron rod. The\nsaid report is supported with evidence of PW. 26. It is also\nnecessary to mention that on perusal of Ex.P.3 to P.10 the photos,\nthe bodies were found in the pool of blood and it reveals that there\nis a grave assault on both deceased and bodies were lying on the\nfloor from long time. On seeing the photos it is clear that\ndeceased were brutally assaulted on the head with weapon. The\nsaid aspect can be ascertained from the photos Ex.P.3 to 10 the\nblood stains on the walls. The defense also not put up any theory\nregarding injuries caused on the bodies of deceased. Even in the\ncross-examination of the witnesses, there is nothing elicited to\ndiscard Ex.P.47, 50 and the opinion of PW. 26. The evidence of\nPW. 26 coupled with the Ex.P.47 and 50 corroborate the ocular\n\n 14\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nevidence of PW. 1 that there is assault on both deceased. As\nstated above defense has not disputed the death of both\ndeceased. It is clear that injuries caused due to assault with MO.\n15 , as a result there is death of Preethy Acharya and Veda. With\nthis it can be concluded that death of Preethy Acharya and Veda is\nnothing but homicidal. Accordingly point No.1 is answered in\naffirmative.\n\n 18. POINT NO.2; There are no eye witnesses to the\nincident. The entire case rests on circumstantial evidence. The\nmain circumstances that can be pointed out are;\n\n 1. The existence of strain relationship between accused no.1\n and deceased Preethy Acharya.\n\n 2. accused present on the day of incident.\n\n 3. Commission of offence.\n\n 4. Motive.\n\n 5. Recovery of incriminating articles on discloser made by\n accused.\n\nI] ARGUMENTS OF PROSECUTION ;\n\n 19. Learned P.P has summed up case that the prosecution\nhas been able to establish all circumstances beyond reasonable\ndoubt to hold accused conspired together and they were\nsuccessful in achieving their goal. Some of the witnesses\nexamined by the prosecution have not completely supported the\ncase of the prosecution, but their part of hostality does not in any\nway affect evidence given by other material witnesses. It is\n\n 15\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nargued that if the entire material evidence is considered it shows\nthat they are not the interested witnesses in the sense that these\nwitnesses have not made any attempt to falsely implicate the\naccused in the case and hence their evidence cannot be\ndiscarded. Placing this principle before this court prosecution\naddressed argument.\n\n 20. It is argued that the accusedd had three wives, two\nmarriages of A1 end up in divorce and the deceased Preethy\nAcharya is the third wife of A1. From the conduct of A1 it is clear\nthat A1 was not of good character. accusedd No.1 married to\ndeceased Preethy Acharya on mutual agreeing between the family.\nAfter the marriage A1 started to harass deceased. It is very much\nclear from the evidence placed by the prosecution mainly Ex.P.12\nand 13 wherein the said deceased Preethy Acharya lodged\ncomplaint of domestic violence and harassment even the criminal\nintimidation. The said fact is also proved by the prosecution\nthrough evidence that accusedd No.1 use to harass physically\nand mentally. PW. 1 and 3 to 6 have depose regarding dispute\nbetween deceased Preethy Acharya and accusedd No.1. It is\nfurther argued that said deceased Veda is the relative of Preethy\nAcharya. Before the fatal day the said Preethy Acharya alongwith\nfamily visited Mangalore and she is about to come to Bombay\nalongwith her parents. But her two children went to Bombay\nalongwith grant parents whereas Preethy Acharya and Veda\ncame to Bangalore to complete some of the works to collect T.C.\nThe said incident day and the days before the death of deceased\nPreethy Acharya was specifically established by the prosecution.\n\n 21. It is not in dispute that, on the said day deceased\n\n 16\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nPreethy Acharya and Veda came to Bangalore and they were\npresent in the house of A1. PW. 1 has specifically narrated that\naccused No.1 was harassing Preethy Acharya and she in the night\nat about 10.30 informed the same through phone call to PW. 1\nand PW. 1 cautioned Preethy Acharya to keep herself safe in the\nroom. PW. 1 also narrated the incident happened on the morning\nwherein when she came down to Bangalore and visited the house\nof accused No.1 and she found that Preethy Acharya and Veda\nwere dead and they were murdered. The said accused No.1 was\nnot present on the said day. Subsequently she lodged the\ncomplaint before concerned police and the police have\ninvestigated the matter. She has specifically depose regarding\nharassment of accused No.1. It is further argued by the\nprosecution that PW. 2 in his evidence stated regarding recovery\nof rod at the instance of accused No.1. Hence the recovery of\nincriminating article rod is proved by the prosecution.\n\n 22. It is further argued that PW. 2 has supported the case of\nthe prosecution, though he is cross examined by accused No.1,\nbut nothing material is elicited from his cross-examination. Further\nit is argued that the witnesses PW. 3 has supported the case of\nthe prosecution and he is the witness who has last seen the\naccused and he has depose that there was a quarrel between\ndeceased Preethy Acharya and accused No.1. This witness has\nspecifically depose regarding incident wherein he heard the\nscreaming of woman and child in the mid night of the incident day.\nThe testimony of this witness cannot be discarded as there is no\nenmity between accused No.1 and the witness. He has depose\nnaturally the incident occurred during that day. Further PW. 4 also\n\n 17\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nsupported the case regarding harassment by accused No.1 to\nPreethy Acharya. To both witnesses there is no suggestion\nregarding incident. It is further argued that the stand of accused\nNo.1 during cross-examination is not correct and proper that\nhusband of Preethy Acharya use to quarrel with Preethy Acharya\nand the stand regarding someone use to visit the house of\naccused No.1 when accused No.1 was not in the home. This\ndefense is not correct and proper. Further it is argued that victim\nremains with accused till last. This itself shows that deceased\nPreethy Acharya and accused No.1 present till death of deceased\nPreethy Acharya. It is further argued that PW. 5 supported the\ncase of the prosecution regarding hearing of screaming of victim.\nHe has also depose regarding incident. However the hostality of\nthis witness will not take away the case of the prosecution.\n\n 23. It is also argued that PW.7 also supported the case\nregarding recovery and also drawing of the mahazar. These\nwitnesses PW. 2 and 7 are the independent witnesses who have\nsupported the case of the prosecution. It is further argued that\nduring the cross-examination of PW. 8 there is no denial regarding\nthe incident. Since there is no denial it is held to be admitted.\nFurther PW. 10 also depose regarding hearing of the screaming on\nthe said day and there is no cross-examination of the witness in\nthat regard. Further PW. 17 depose regarding the drinking habit of\naccused No.1. He has also identified the articles recovered\nduring investigation.\n\n 24. Further it is argued that the medical evidence in this\ncase is clearly supported the case of the prosecution wherein it is\nproved that the death of deceased Preethy Acharya and Veda is\n\n 18\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nhomicidal and other evidence specifically prove that accused No.1\nwas present who has committed the offence. It is further argued\nthat the motive is very much clear in this case. This aspect is\nproved by the prosecution wherein the deceased Preethy\nAcharya lodged complaint against accused No.1. Further after\nlodging of the complaint enmity raised between Preethy Acharya\nand accused No.1 and after coming back from the custody in\nthose cases the accused No.1 developed enmity and he was\nintending to take revenge and in that regard he has planned to\nmurder Preethy Acharya and executed the same.\n\n 25. It is further argued that it is burden on the husband to\nprove the incident. It is argued that there are different versions\nraised by the accused. It is specifically proved that the conduct of\naccused No.1 is suspicious as he was absconding from the spot\nafter the incident. It is also argued that the accused has first hit\nPreethy Acharya and then Veda since Veda starts to scream, to\nshut her the accused No.1 also killed Veda. It is also argued that\nduring the cross-examination accused No.1 tried to attack on the\nchastity of Preethy Acharya and the said fact is not true and\ncorrect and accused No.1 is not able to prove the same. From all\nthese aspects the prosecution is able to prove that accused No.1\nhas murdered deceased. Further it is also argued that accused\nNo.1 has conspired with accused No.2 regarding murder of\ndeceased Preethy Acharya. There are call details which took\nplace between accused No.1 and 2. They specifically prove that\nthey have conspired and there was a planning, preparation and\nexecution of the same by accused No.1 and 2. Hence he can also\nbe convicted for the offence. Since the prosecution has proved the\n\n 19\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nguilt of the accused it is argued that stringent punishment is to be\nimposed.\n\nII] ARGUMENTS OF DEFENSE;\n\n 26. The counsel for the defense argued in detail in support\nof his case. The pith and substance of the argument of the defense\nis that firstly the counsel for the defense narrated the prosecution\ncase. The counsel for the defense through his argument try to\ndiscredit the evidence of PW. 1. It is argued that the entire\nevidence of PW. 1 is an after thought as there are many\ncontradictions and omissions in the evidence of PW.1. it is argued\nthat the facts narrated by the PW.1 in her evidence is not in\nconsonance with the case of the prosecution. It is argued that it is\nnot in dispute that the accused No.1 married to Preethy Acharya.\nThe harassment by accused No.1 to Preethy Acharya is an after\nthought narrated by PW.1. It is argued regarding incident day and\nthe development regarding days before the incident. It is argued\nthat prosecution has failed to prove that there is a telephone\nconversion between deceased Preethy Acharya and her mother-\nPW. 1. It is further argued that police called complainant that has\nnot been proved by the prosecution. The counsel pointing at the\nevidence of PW.1 has pointed out that PW. 1 does not know who\ncalled her at the first instance in the morning on 18.4.2013. It is\nfurther argued that complaint lodged by PW. 1 is an after thought.\nAs per the complainant the rod-MO.15 was lying beside the dead\nbody and in the complaint it is specifically stated the said fact and\nsame is marked as Ex.D.1. However as per the investigation and\nthe report of I.O the said rod was recovered from the drainage at\nthe instance of the accused No.1. It is argued that it is the case of\n\n 20\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nthe prosecution that in the night the said Preethy Acharya called\nPW. 1 and it is stated that accused No.1 threatening Preethy\nAcharya, but the prosecution has not produced any call sheet and\nno evidence to that effect is produced before the court. It is also\nargued that evidence of PW. 1 is not specific as because PW. 1 on\none stretch depose that she has boarded the bus from Bombay to\nBangalore in the night whereas in the other stretch she depose\nthat she has boarded the bus in the afternoon, there is no material\nor evidence regarding her travel from Bombay to Bangalore. No\nbus ticket was produced before the court to show that she started\nher journey and came to Bangalore. The very fact is elicited from\nevidence of PW.1 that no ticket is produced and the said ticket\nhad information regarding starting of journey timing of the bus and\nother details. The said fact is not proved by the prosecution. This\nis one of the relevant circumstance to be proved by the\nprosecution. But the prosecution failed in that regard.\n\n 27. It is also argued that as per the prosecution case there is\nchild of one year of deceased Veda. As per the evidence of PW. 1 ,\nPW. 1 says I.O. took the child to the Police Station whereas PW.\n29 the IO depose that child was taken by PW. 1 and she brought\nthe child to the police station. There is complete contradiction in\nrespect of this aspect. Further it is argued that the child was there\nat the time of assault on deceased as per the prosecution case.\nBut there is no blood stains on the child or on the child`s clothes. It\nis also not revealed from the evidence that the child was subjected\nto medical examination. There is complete contradiction in respect\nof this aspect that PW. 1 was present at the spot. As per the\nargument of the defense PW. 1 was staying with Preethy Acharya\n\n 21\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nin the said house, she has not traveled from Bombay to\nBangalore. As per the defense she is the culprit. It is also argued\nthat with regard to harassment PW. 1 was subjected to cross-\nexamination and she was suggested that in both the cases\naccused was acquitted, PW. 1 pleaded ignorance in that regard.\nBy this the defense try to discredit the entire evidence of PW. 1\nthat she is the interested witness and she has depose falsely\nagainst the accused No.1.\n\n 28. The counsel for the defense also try to explain that there\nis a contradiction and improvement with regard to evidence of PW.\n3,4,5,6,8,9,10, these witnesses are the neighbors of accused\nNo.1. it is argued that PW. 3 is not an eye witness to the incident.\nPointing at the evidence of PW. 3 it is argued that he has not seen\nthe incident, further it is also argued that the evidence of PW. 1 is\nfull of contradiction. As per PW. 3 said deceased Preethy Acharya\nand Veda came from Mangalore to Bangalore on 17.4.2013 in the\nmorning and they were standing in front of the door and when he\nasked said Preethy Acharya, she told that accused No.1 is not\nopening the door. When he returned in the evening said Preethy\nAcharya and Veda were inside the house and when he asked said\nPreethy Acharya, she told that they came from back door. Pointing\nat this fact counsel for defense argued that in the entire evidence\nthere is no mentioning of back door to the house of accused No.1,\nEven the sketch produced regarding place of incident at Ex.P.30,\nthere is no mention regarding back door and even in the evidence\nof PW. 12-Engineer he has depose there is no back door to the\nsaid house. It is further argued that there is complete contradiction\nregarding last seen. As per PW. 3 he saw accused No.1 going out\n\n 22\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nof the house in the night at 1.30, but whereas the other witnesses\nhave not depose in that regard. The evidence of PW. 3 is an\nimprovement of the stand of PW. 1.\n\n 29. It is further argued that in respect of harassment of\naccused No.1 to Preethy Acharya, PW. 3 is the hear say witness.\nHe has not directly heard anything regarding harassment of\naccused No.1 and said Preethy Acharya has not specifically\nstated the said aspects to PW3. Hence the evidence of PW. 3 is\nnot believable. Further it is argued that the other witnesses i.e.\nPW. 4,5,6,8,9 and 10 all the witnesses have turned hostile to the\ncase of the prosecution. They have not supported the case of the\nprosecution. The prosecution has failed to prove the facts through\nthese witnesses.\n\n 30. In respect to the drawing of the mahazar the counsel for\nthe defense argued that Ex.P. 2 and 11 are conducted by the I.O.\non the same place and MO.13 and 14 are seized before A1. It is\nfurther argued that the I.O has stated in his evidence that he\nvisited the incidental spot and he has searched the entire house.\nWhen the I.O. searched entire house and premises they have not\nrecovered MO. 13 and 14 and this create doubt in respect of\ndrawing of mahazar. It is further argued that as per the evidence\nof I.O. PW. 29 he has visited the spot in the morning and\nconducted spot mahazar of the entire building. It is further argued\nthat PW. 2 and 7 were called in the morning while drawing\nmahazar. But on the same day they were called again in the\nevening at 5.00 p.m. When the I.O. has investigated the entire\nhouse he could have recovered MO. 13 and 14 in the morning\nitself. The said MO. 13 and 14 said to have been recovered in the\n\n 23\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nevening at the instance of A1. It is further argued that if the\nmahazer was drawn in the morning there was no question of\ncalling of PW. 2 and 7 in the evening. It is further argued that\nMO. 13 and 14 are planted. As per the spot mahazar and evidence\nof PW. 2 spot mahazar was conducted in the ground floor and\nsame is also depose by PW. 2, but again PW. 2 depose that there\nis a cellar, but there is no cellar in the entire building. Hence the\nevidence of PW. 2 is doubtful. It is further argued that as per PW.\n7 when he visited the spot while drawing mahazar the dead body\nwas taken away, if that is considered Ex.P.11 is doubtful. There is\ncompletely contradiction in the evidence of PW. 2 and 7. It is\nfurther argued that as per PW. 1 MO. 15 iron rod was at the spot,\nthe said portion of evidence is marked as Ex.D.1. It is further\nargued that two recoveries made in the evening at about 5.00 p.m\nand the said two recoveries were conducted in one mahazar at\ndifferent places. The mahazar are to be conducted separately, but\nas per prosecution it is a running mahazar. The said mahazar\nconducted is not admissible in law.\n\n 31. It is further argued that with regard to the evidence of\nPW. 17 it is not clear regarding the preparation by accused No.1.\nthe evidence of PW. 17 is not believable as because he being the\ncashier does not know what is the amount and he does not\ndisclose regarding receipt of purchase of three beer cans. By this it\ncan be inferred that the prosecution failed to prove the\npreparation by the accused.\n\n 32. It is further argued that with respect to the medical\nevidence as per evidence of PW. 26 the Doctor received\ninformation on 17/8.4.2013 between 10.30 am and 11.30 am. The\n\n 24\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nsaid piece of evidence is contrary to the prosecution case. Further\nit is argued that as per the PM report there is struggle injuries on\nthe dead body of Veda,but to substantiate same no examination is\nconducted on accused to prove the fact that there was struggle\nbetween A1 and deceased Veda. Even the nails of deceased were\nnot examined. No particulars were collected regarding Ex.P. 53.\nFurther it is argued that as per the prosecution case the deceased\ndrunk beer which was brought byA1. As per PM report the\ncontents of beer not found in the body and also no other poison\nwere detected. But it is the case of the prosecution that the beer\ntins were empty. Further accused also secured subsequently on\nthe next day. Even there is no evidence to show that accused were\ndetected with alcohol content in his body. If this fact is considered,\nthe prosecution case in this regard is not believable. Further it is\nalso argued that as per the FSL report the blood is that of human\nand it belongs to `A` group. However it is not forthcoming from the\nFSL report that deceased blood was identified and same is tallied\nwith the blood found on MO. 15. Even the said FSL report is not\nhelpful for the prosecution to establish the fact that MO. 15 was\nuse to assault deceased. Further it is argued that PW. 26 has not\nexamined the surface of the alleged iron rod to establish the\nconnection between the injuries and the weapon use. The said PM\nreport is not according to medical manual. Hence the\nprosecution also fails in order to establish the medical evidence.\nFurther it is also argued that the inquest is also not properly\nconducted. Inquest has to be held in the house itself not in the\nhospital, but in this case the inquest was conducted at KIMS\nhospital. Further it is also argued that in Ex.P. 41 and 42 the\n\n 25\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\ninquest reports there is over writing. As per this it can be said that\nthe inquest is also not properly conducted.\n\n 33. It is also argued that as per the case of the prosecution\nA1 and A2 conspired to eliminate Preethy Acharya. It is the case of\nthe prosecution that A1 called A2 and A2 instigated A1 to take\naway life of deceased. A2 supported A1 in the commission of\ncrime. It is argued that call details of A1 an dA2 have not been\ncollected, if that is collected then there is possibility to prove\nwhether A1 and A2 have conspired to commit crime. Investigating\nOfficer has not properly conducted investigation. The call details\nare not marked in the present case. Hence the prosecution fails to\nprove the connection between A1 and A2 in the commission of the\npresent crime. It is further argued that the conduct of the deceased\nPreety Acharya is to be looked into. The marriage of deceased\nwith A1 is the 2nd marriage.\n\n 34. The prosecution case in respect of motive is weekly\nestablished, eventhough she lodged two complaints against A1.\nThose cases were ended with acquittal for lack of evidence. It is\nalso argued that the said documents in respect of 2 cases are\nnot collected during investigation and they have been produced\nsubsequently as per Ex.P.12 to P. 17. It is further argued that after\nlapse of 9 months of filing of these two cases the incident took\nplace. Hence this cannot be connected to the present case. PW. 1\nand PW. 29 colluded with each other filed the present false case\nagainst accused. It is also argued that PW. 1 assaulted deceased\nPreethy Acharya and the persons who assaulted know from which\nweapon the deceased was assaulted. Hence PW. 1 specifically\nspeaks that deceased are assaulted with iron rod and she has\n\n 26\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nspecifically depose in her evidence and complaint that said rod\nwas lying beside dead bodies. The limb of argument of the\ndefense is that PW. 1 committed the offence. Hence she\nspecifically knows the details of the crime and she has colluded\nwith I.O. has created the witness and evidence.\n\n 35. It is also argued that there is lot of discrepancy in the\ncase of the prosecution and the evidence are full of contradictions\nand omissions and the many witnesses were turned hostile. Hence\nthe prosecution is not able to prove the links between\ncircumtances. There is no link between each circumstance and if\nthe link is broken the entire case of the prosecution fails. There is a\nlack of evidence in the prosecution case. The prosecution is\nunable to prove the circumstance and the chain of circumstance is\nnot completed. Hence the accused deserves acquittal.\n\n 36. In the line of legal position counsel for the defense\nargues that there is a delay in filing the FIR, it is the evidence of\nPW. 29 that he has visited the spot at 7.30 am, he had not\nregistered FIR till PW. 1 lodges complaint, since there is a delay\nthe same is hit by \nsection 154\n of Cr.P.C. It is also argued that the\nwitness shown in the charge sheet are the interested witnesses.\nHence the evidence of these witnesses cannot be relied upon. It is\nfurther argued that prosecution must prove all the circumstances\nin the present case. Even including the blood stains are not proved\nwith the weapon use in the crime. It is further argued that if 2\nviews are possible in a case, the benefit may be given to accused.\nThe counsel for the accused relied upon;\n\n 1. (1975) 4 SCC 106, 2. AIR 1993 SCC 2644, 3. ILR 2013\n\n 27\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nKAR 992, 4. (1991) 3 SCC 609, 5. 2014 (AIR) SCW 2354, 6. 2019\n(1) KLR 35(SC), 7. ILR 2019 Kar 4119.\n\nIn conclusion the defense argues that the prosecution not proved\nthe presence of accused at the incidental spot on the date of\nincident and assaulted the deceased. Hence the prosecution failed\nto prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the benefit of\ndoubt should be extended to accused and they may be acquitted\nfor the alleged offence.\n\nIII] GLIMPS OF WITNESSES;\n\n 37. Before appreciating the evidence it is better to have a\nglimpse on the evidence given by all the witnesses.\n\n PW. 1 is the mother of deceased Preethy Acharya, she\ndepose that CW.4 is her husband, CW.5 is her Aunt, deceased\nVeda is the daughter of her brother-in-law, the accused no.1 is the\nhusband of Preethy Acharya and he has killed Preethy Acharya\nand Veda and they are residing at Thana of Maharastra and\naccused and deceased were residing at Bangalore and A1\nChandrashekar is the 2nd husband of Preethy Acharya and her 1st\nmarriage was performed in the year 2010 with one Vishwanath\nand 2 daughters were born to them by name Purvi and Palvi and\nthere was dispute in the house of her husband hence Preethy\nAcharya took divorce from Vishwanath.

She\nfurther identified the signature of deceased on complaints and the\ncomplaints dated 14.08.2012 and 12.09.2012, FIR, Charge Sheet,\nInvitation Card, Marriage Certificate are marked as Ex.P12 to 19.\nshe further depose that A1 was harassing her for 2 years and then\nkilled her and A2 is also involved in the crime.\n\n 39.

Now coming to the strain relationship between accused\nno.1 and Preethy Acharya. As per prosecution this is the main\ncause to commit crime by accused no.1. It is the case of the\nprosecution that, accused no.1 alongwith accused no.2 hatched\nplan, conspired to murder victim Preethy Acharya, as she lodged\ncomplaint against him and sent him to jail and also she is not\ngiving divorce and she may ask for share in his property.

That accused no.1 brought drinks to both Preethy\nAcharya and Vedha and made them to drink and when they were\ninebriation, accused no.1 assaulted 6-7 times on the head of his\nwife Preethy Acharya with Iron Rod and caused bleeding injuries.\n\n 55\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nWhen Veda came to rescue, accused no.1 also assaulted 6-7\ntimes on the head of Vedha, with same iron rod and murdered both.\n\n 78. This being the case of the prosecution, in order to prove\nthe guilt of accused no.1 and 2 examined witnesses. As per\nprosecution, accused no.1 developed enmity against Preethy\nAcharya as she lodged complaint against him in Girinagar P.S. and\npolice arrested him and sent to custody. To take revenge he\nhatched plan to eliminate Preethy Acharya. In commission of\nmurder of Preethy Acharya, Veda also got killed. The reason for\nrevenge and enmity is because of the strain relationship between\naccused no.1 and deceased Preethy Acharya. After marriage\naccused no.1 started to harass Preethy Acharya and it is alleged\nthat accused no.1 was not doing any work, he has no earning and\nhe addicted to bad habits. He use to drink and harass Preethy\nAcharya physically and mentally. Further he forced her to go to\nwork and give all money to him. In order to maintain family Preethy\nAcharya forced to take up job and she was working as Teacher in\nLittle Flower school. The harassment by accused no.1 is on daily\nbasis. He use to harass Preethy Acharya daily for one or the other\nreasons.\n\n 79. In order to prove the strain relationship between accused\nno.1 and Preethy Acharya, PW.1 the mother of Preethy Acharya\ndepose that, after marriage accused no.1, Preethy Acharya and\nher children born to her 1st husband, started matrimonial life in\nBangalore. She depose that, as per say of her daughter Preethy\nAcharya for 2-3 months every thing is fine. Then there was rift and\ndisturbance between accused no.1 and Preethy Acharya regarding\njob by Preethy Acharya and accused no.1 forced her to go outside\n\n 56\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nand work. He use to drink all the time alongwith his friends. He\nforced Preethy Acharya to look after his friends and she should\nenjoy with them. To which Preethy Acharya refused.

She\ndepose that since the accused no.1 harass her daily, she advised\nher to protect herself and lodge complaint and take protection from\npolice. She depose that, for same matter Preethy Acharya lodged\ncomplaint against accused no.1 in Girinagar P.S. She lodged\ncomplaint because, one women by name Valli use to come to their\nhouse in her absence and accused no.1 had illicit relationship with\nher and he use to give all articles from house to her. When Preethy\nAcharya asked same, he assaulted her and Preethy Acharya for\nthat reason lodged complaint before police. Police arrested\naccused no.1 on the basis of complaint. He got released from jail\nand when he returned from jail, he started to harass Preethy\nAcharya in different manner. accused no.1 started harass saying\nas, she sent him to jail and for that, he will kill her and threatened\nher with dire consequences.

Further it is suggested that, the\ncases filed by Preethy Acharya against accused No.1 regarding\ndomestic violence and criminal intimidation ends up in acquittal. To\nthe said suggestion PW.1 pleads ignorance. Apart from these\nsuggestions, there is no specific cross-examination by accused\nNo.1 regarding allegation of harassment to Preethy Achary. This\nfact is very relevant because, the said fact is the genesis of the\npresent crime.

During cross-\nexamination he depose that he has not seen quarrel between A1\nand Preethy Acharya directly. He depose that once Preethy\nAcharya and A1 came to marriage at Mangalore. At that time he\ncame to know that the relationship between A1 and Preethy\nAcharya is not cordial. In his house when they were in front of\nhim he came to know that there is disturbance between A1 and\nPreethy Acharya.\n\n 91. These witnesses specifically depose regarding strain\nrelationship between deceased Preethy Acharya and A1. Some of\nthe witnesses heard the quarrel between them. Further before\nsome of the witnesses said deceased Preethy Acharya shared her\npain regarding harassment by A1. All the witnesses spoke\nregarding the disturbance in the family between A1 and Preethy\nAcharya. Deceased Preethy Acharya told them that A1 forcing her\nto do job and maintain family. That some witnesses specifically\nspoke that they heard screaming while quarrel between A1 and\n\n 64\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nPreethy Acharya in the night. These witnesses are the direct\nwitnesses to this fact because they witness through their sense\nthat there is disturbance in the family and A1 use to harass her, as\nsaid by deceased the relationship between them is not cordial.\n\n 92. On appreciation of evidence of these witnesses it can be\ninferred that due to harassment and strain relationship with A1\nPreethy Acharya lodged 2 complaints against A1. This fact is\ncorroborated by the documentary evidence as the prosecution\nproduced Ex.P.12 complaint in Cr. No. 206/2012 for the offence\nu/sec. 498, 506 of \nIPC\n. Ex.P. 13 complaint in Cr. No. 227/2012 for\nthe offence u/sec. 504, 506 of \nIPC\n. Ex.P.12(A) and Ex.P.13(A) are\nthe original copy of complaint. Ex.P.14 is the FIR in Cr. No.\n206/2012 u/sec. 498A, 506 of \nIPC\n, Ex.P.15 is the FIR in Cr. No.\n227/2012 for the offence u/sec. 504, 506 of \nIPC\n. Ex.P.16 is the\ncharge sheet in CC No. 21187/2012 (Cr. No. 206/12 u/sec. 498A\n506 of \nIPC\n). Ex.P.17 is the Charge sheet in CC No. 22335/2012\n(Cr. No. 227/2012 u/sec. 504, 506 of \nIPC\n). These documentary\nevidence reveals that deceased lodged complaints against A1\nfor domestic harassment. In Ex.P.12, 12 (A), Ex.P.13, 13(A)\ndeceased Preethy Acharya narrated both physical and mental\nharassment by A1. However it is the defense of the A1 that in both\nthe cases A1 got acquittal. But the fact through ocular evidence\nand documentary evidence, it is clear that there is disturbance in\nthe relationship between A1 and Preethy Acharya. The accused\nNo.1 though in his defense try to elicit that there was no\ndisturbance in the family, but the ocular evidence of the witnesses\nand documents speaks otherwise. PW. 1 mother of deceased\nstated that her daughter told her regading harassment and strain\n\n 65\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nrelationship between husband and wife. Further PW. 3, 4,5,\ndepose that said PreethyAcharya use to share her problem and\ntold them that A1 use to harass her and because of that she\nlodged complaint against A1. Further after lodging first complaint\nA1 was sent to jail and after returning from jail, he started more\nharassment in revenge that she sent him jail and he use to\nthreaten with dire consequences. After that again she lodged 2 nd\ncomplaint. This fact of lodging complaint and sending him to jail\ndeveloped enmity between A1 and Preethy Acharya. Further PW.\n21 depose who is relative of deceased Preethy Acharya that he\nhas witnessed that there was no cordial relationship between A1\nand Preethy Acharya. On appreciation of evidence of these\nwitnesses in respect of strain relationship between A1 and Preethy\nAcharya and harassment by A1 to Preethy Acharya they spoke\nconsistently. The testimony of these witnesses is corroborative to\neach other. However the affairs are private between husband and\nwife the witnesses may not directly present at the time of quarrel\nbetween husband and wife, but there is sufficient material that\nthey have witnessed the quarrel may be by hearing but the fact\nregarding relationship is clear from these witnesses. There may\nbe minor discrepancy, the main fact regarding relationship and\nharassment is consistent. There is no reason to disbelieve the\ntestimony of these witnesses. By this it can be held that the\nprosecution is able to prove the circumstance regarding strain\nrelationship between A1 and Preety Acharya and harassment by\nA1 to her.\n\nVII] Fateful day;\n\n 93. It is the case of the prosecution that on 10.4.2013 PW. 1\n\n 66\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\ntook Preethy and her two children and Veda to Mangalore on the\neve of Ugadi.

On 16.4.2013 she came down to Bangalore.\nPW. 1 insisted as it is not safe to go alone to Bangalore, Veda and\nher child accompanied deceased Preethy Acharya to Bangalore.\nOn 16.4.2013 Preethy Acharya and Veda and her child reached\nBangalore in the morning , A1 who was present in the home did\nnot opened door. After some time A1 went outside from the house.\nAt that time Preethy Acharya entered house. A1 returned home\nand quarreled with them. On 17/18.4.2013 in the mid night at\nabout 1.00-2.00 there is sound of screaming of woman and child\nfrom Preethy Achaya`s house. Next day on 18.4.2013 morning\nmother of PW. 1 reached Bengaluru from Bombay and found\nPreethy Acharya and Veda are murdered and they were lying in\nthe pool of blood. It is the case of the prosecution that on\n17/18.4.2013 A1 made Preethy Acharya and Veda to drink beer\nand when they were in intoxication at midnight between 1.00-2.00\nA1 assaulted Preethy Acharya and Veda with iron rod and\nmurdered them.\n\ni] accused present on the day of incident and assaulted\ndeceased Preethy Acharya and Veda.\n\n 94. The prosecution has to prove circumstance that A1\npresent on fateful day in the house when crime committed. To\nprove this fact the prosecution examined PW. 3,4,5,8, 9, 10 who\nare neighbor of A1 and Preethy Acharya. These witness are the\nresidents of same building where deceased Preethy Acharya and\n\n 67\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nA1 resided. These witnesses have depose regarding strain\nrelationship between A1 and Preethy Achaya and harassment by\nA1 to her. To explain fact regarding day before the incident,\nincident day and days after incident PW. 3,4,5,8,9,10 gave their\nevidence.\n\n 95. Before adverting into the appreciation of oral evidence it\nis necessary to observe the structure of building and crime spot.\nAs per record and evidence it is clear that the building where\noffence is committed is consist of ground, first and 2nd floor. The\nsaid A1 and Preethy Acharya resides in ground floor and\nremaining witnesses I.e PW. 3,4,5,6 resides in 1st and 2nd floor.\nPW. 3 resides in 2nd floor. PW. 4 and 5 are husband and wife\nresides in 2nd floor in front of PW. 3`s house. PW. 6 resides in first\nfloor. PW 8 and 9 resides in front of A1 house. PW. 10 resides in\nadjacent building. It is clear from the evidence that stair case to\nfirst floor and 2nd floor starts in front of A1`s house at ground\nfloor. Residents of 1st and 2nd floor use said stair case to reach their\nhouses. This fact is necessary to establish fact regarding crime\nspot. The said crime spot is bed room in the A1`s house in ground\nfloor.\n\n 96. Now it has to be examined whether A1 present on the\nday of incident. PW.1,3and 4 depose in this regard. PW. 1 depose\nthat on 17.4.2013 she started travel to Bangalore. In the night at\n10.30 p.m she was talking to her daughter Preethy and she told\nher that A1 threatening her with life threat and to Veda too he was\ngiving life threat. However she is cross examined on this point\nputting defense that A1 was not there on the day of incident. The\nsaid suggestion denied by PW.1 stating that on the day of incident\n\n 68\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nwhen daughter called her and at that time he was in the house.\nFurther in this regard P.W 3 depose that Preethy Acharya came to\nBangalore from Mangalore alongwith Veda ad her child on\n17.4.2013 in the morning and A1 did not opened door to them.\nThen they went to Babita`s house. In the morning when the said\nPW. 3 going to work Preethy and Veda and her child standing\noutside house. At that time he asked them and they replied that\nthey came from Mangalore and A1 is not opening door, at that\ntime A1 was inside the house. On the same day in the evening\nwhen he returned at 8.30 Preethey Acharya, Veda and her child\nsitting inside house and when he going to his floor he inquired\nPreethy and she said they came from back door. He further\ndepose that in the same evening again quarrel started and he\nheard same when he was in the house. PW. 3 during cross-\nexamination depose that he has not seen Preethy Acharya, Veda\nand her child coming from Mangalore, but he saw them standing in\nfront of house. He further depose that he has not seen A1 was not\nopening door. He depose that the said fact told by Preethy\nAcharya and he was suggested by A1 during cross-examination\nthat he has not asked Preethy when he was going office. He\ndepose that after returning in the evening he asked Preethy, as\nthey were outside in the morning and in evening they were inside\nthe house.\n\n 96(a) PW. 5 depose that he saw A1 one or two days prior to\nthe date of incident, Preethy alongwith another woman and A1,\nwere there in the house. During cross-examination by prosecution\nhe admitted that on 16.4.2013 in the morning Preethy and Veda\nand child returned to home, at that time A1 did not opened door\n\n 69\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nand after some time A1 went outside and at that time Preethy and\nVeda entered house. After returning to home A1 started quarrel\nwith them and in this regard he gave statement to police. To the\nsaid suggestion PW. 5 depose that he know regarding entering of\nhouse by Preethy and Veda and child and quarrel by A1. During\ncross-examination by A1 he depose that he saw Preethy, Veda\nand child coming from Mangalore to house. He also saw them at\n8.30 - 9.00 in the night. He further depose that he saw them when\nthey were in the house. He came to know that A1 did not open the\ndoor to them when they came to house. he came to know that A1\nafter returning home had quarrel with them. But he has not seen\nthe same. He came to know said fact from CW. 5,6,7 and 8.\n\n 97. PW. 8 depose that Preethy Acharya and Veda and child\ncame from Mangalore to Bangalore. On the said day when she\nwas sweeping said Preethy Acharya and Veda and child standing\noutside their house. She asked Preethy why she came back from\nMangalore, Preethy told she had some work in Bangalore and she\nhad to collect some luggage. PW. 8 depose that since A1 did not\nopen door they were standing outside. Then PW. 8 asked them for\nhelp, at that time Preethy Acharya replied police are coming and\nthey will help. She depose that Preethy and Veda went to her\nhouse to get fresh and then they had breakfast. Then they went to\nPolice Station. On next day Veda told her that, they broke open the\nlock and went inside. After 2 days heard that Preethy and Veda are\nmurdered.\n\n 98. On appreciation of the testimony of PW. 1,3,5 and 8 it\ncan be inferred that A1 was there in the house when Preethy and\nVeda and child returned from Mangalore. PW. 1 depose that on\n\n 70\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nthe day of incident her daughter speaking to her and she told that,\nA1 threatening her. However the defense put up that no call detail\nrecords were collected during investigation regarding call between\nPW. 1 and Preethy Acharya. But during cross-examination also\nshe specifically stated that her daughter called her and at that time\nA1 was inside house. PW. 3 depose that on day before incident A1\nwas inside the house and A1 did not open door when Preethy and\nVeda and child came from Mangalor. He depose that he heard\nquarrel in the evening. PW. 5 also depose in the same line that\nday before incident A1 was inside the house alongwith Preethy\nand Veda and child. This piece of evidence clearly establish that\nA1 was there in the house on the day before incident and on the\nday of incident. Though A1 in his defense disputed, the entering of\nPreethy and Veda from back door contending that, there is no\nback door to their house and the same is tried to be elicited from\nthe evidence of PW. 12 who prepared sketch of spot at the request\nof IO. But here it is relevant to observe that, said fact of entering\ninto house through back door by Preethy and Veda does not have\nsignificance in the case, as because it is not in dispute that they\nentered into house and they were in the house on the day of\nincident. Further their bodies were found inside the house. Hence\nthe said fact of entering into the house though back door has no\nbaring on the case.\n\nii] Plea of Alibi\n\n 99. The fact regarding presence of A1 in the house on the\nday before the incident and on the day of incident assumes\nsignificance and importance in this case, as because A1 has\nraised plea of alibi. During the course of cross-examination of\n\n 71\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nPW.1 and PW.29 he puts up the defence that, he was not in the\nhouse. A2 was suffering from ill health for treatment he was in the\nhouse of A2 and further he did not have information regarding\ncoming of both deceased to his house. However same defence put\nup by A1 in written submission submitted by him, in his defence\nafter recording of statement u/sec 313 of \nCr.PC\n. He submitted that\non 16, 17 and 18 of April 2013 he was not present at place of\noccurrence, he was at the residence of A2 Prabhakar since A2\nwas not feeling well. On 18.04.2013 police came to A2's house\nand arrested both. This is the version of defense of A1 that he was\nnot present on 16, 17, 18th of April 2013 which lead rising plea of\nalibi.\n\n \n100. At this stage it is worth to rely on the ratio laid down by\nthe Hon`ble Apex Court in \nDhudh Nath Pandeay vs. State of\nU.P. The\n Hon`ble Court observes in respect of plea of alibi.\n\n \" The plea of alibi postulates the physical impossibility\n of the presence of the accused at the scene of offence by\n reason of his presence at other place. The plea can\n therefore succeed only if it is shown that the accused was so\n far away at the relevant time that he could not be present at\n the place where the crime was committed........\"\n\n 101. In another case of Dhananjaya Chatarjee vs. State of\nWest Bengal it is also observed that;\n\n \"Though it is not necessary for an accused to render\n an explanation to prove his innocence and even if he\n renders a false explanation, it cannot be use to support the\n prosecution case against him and that the entire case must\n be proved by the prosecution itself but it is well settled that\n a plea of alibi, if raised by an accused is required to be\n proved by him by cogent and satisfactory evidence so as to\n\n 72\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n completely exclude the possibility of the presence of the\n accused at the place of occurrence at the relevant time. The\n belated and vague plea of alibi of which we find no whisper\n during the cross-examination of any of the prosecution\n witnesses and which has not been sought to be established\n by leading any evidence is only an afterthought and a plea\n of despair. The abscondence of the appellant is thus a\n material circumstance which has been satisfactorily and\n conclusively established by the prosecution against the\n appellant.\"\n\nAs per the observation of the Hon`ble Apex Court it is the duty of\nthe accused to prove the plea of alibi to the satisfaction of the\ncourt and substantiate the plea and to make it reasonably\nprobable. It is only a rule of evidence recognized u/sec. 11 of\n\nEvidence Act\n that, facts which are inconsistent with the facts in\nissue are relevant. The burden of proving commission of offence\nby accused, so as to fasten the liability of guilt on him, remains on\nthe prosecution. The plea of alibi taken by the accused needs to\nbe considered only when the burden, which lies on the prosecution\nis discharged satisfactorily. But once the prosecution succeeds in\ndischarging its burden, then it is incumbent upon the accused\ntaking the plea of alibi to prove it with certainty so as to exclude\nthe possibility of his presence at the relevant place and time.\n\n 102. \nIn \nJibon C.H. Bharli vs. State of Assam\n 1987 (3)\nCrime 883 observed that;\n\n \"A plea of alibi when taken by the accused must be\n conclusively proved by him and in case of failure of proving\n the plea or adducing unreasonable evidence on the plea the\n prosecution case and its substantive evidence implicating\n accused get further strengthened.\"\n\n 73\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nIf the said principles are applied when accused puts of plea of alibi\nit is burden on the accused to prove the same and he has to show\nthat he was not present at crime scene. He was far way from\nmaterial place and that even he cannot reach said spot at\nreasonable time.\n\n 103. However the burden of proving guilt of the accused was\nnot shifted on the accused, it remains on the prosecution itself. But\nif the plea of alibi was raised by the accused he has to establish\ncertain facts, may be circumstantial one, which is inconsistent with\nthe case of the prosecution that he was present at the crime spot\nat the relevant time. It is sufficient to place certain facts with\nplausible explanation which creates certain amount of doubt\nregarding the presence of the accused at relevant time and place.\nHence in this case he has not given reasonable explanation which\nmade to believe by this court that, he was not present on the day\nbefore incident and on the day of incident and he was in the\nresidence of A2. The said residence is far away from material\nplace which cannot be reached at reasonable time. However\ntestimony of PW.1, 3, 5 and 8 speaks otherwise. They have\ncategorically stated that on day before incident, A1 was in the\nhouse and they heard quarrel between A1 and Preethy Acharya\nand they have specifically speaks that, Prethi, Veda and child\ncame from Mangalore on 16.04.2013 and they were standing\noutside the house as A1 did not open the door. Further on the said\nevening PW.3, 5 heard the quarrel between A1 and Preethy\nAcharya. PW.1 categorically stated, her daughter said her that A1\nis in the house and is threatening them. Further PW. 3 stated that\nhe saw A1 going out at night on the day of incident. The evidence\n\n 74\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nof PW.8 corroborate the evidence of PW.3 and 5. As stated earlier\nalso there is no reason to disbelieve the testimony of the\nwitnesses.\n\n 104. Further it is necessary to observe that as per\nprosecution A1 is arrested from Kengeri Satellite bus stand, PW.\n14 Sub Inspector K.Subramani who arrested accused No.1 and\nproduced before P.I., depose that, on 18.4.2013 P.I. assign them to\nsearch and arrest A1 of this case. On information when they\nreached Kengeri Satellite bus stand a person sitting suspiciously,\nwhen asked information accused No.1 said his details and they\narrested him and produced before P.I. He is cross examined by\nthe defense. But not elicited any material that they have not\narrested him from said bus stand. On perusal of the evidence not\neven a suggestion put up regarding his arrest from house of A2. In\nthe written submission submitted by A1 he stated he was arrested\nfrom accused No.2. But defense not even cross examined PW. 14\nor PW. 29 in that regard that he was not arrested from the said bus\nstand but from the house of accused No.2. As stated above not a\nsingle suggestion put up both to PW. 14 and PW. 29. On\nappreciation of evidence of PW.1, 3, 5, 8 it is clear that the A1 was\npresent on the day before incident and on the day of incident.\nFurther it is relevant to observe that though the plea of alibi was\nraised but said alibi is not established by A1.\n\n 105. Even A2 was present before the court during the\nrecording of statement u/sec. 313 of \nCr.P.C\n. But he has not\nwhispered about the presence of A1 in his house. It is necessary\nto observe that if the testimony of prosecution witnesses indicates\ntowards the presence of accused No.1 in his house in crime spot\n\n 75\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nat the relevant point of time as stated by PW. 1, 3,10, It is\nincumbent upon the accused No.1 to explain to give probable\nexplanation that he was in the house of A2. He in his defense\nvaguely stated that he was in the house of A2 before the incident\nand on the date of incident. But apart from the statement there is\nno circumstantial facts or material placed to establish that he was\nin the house of A2. As observed by the Hon`ble Apex Court the\nplea of alibi must be proved with certainty. But here in this case,\nthe accused No.1 apart from his statements placed nothing on\nrecord to substantiate his defense in this regard. Hence the plea of\nalibi cannot be accepted.\n\niii] Commission of Offence;\n\n 106. As per the case of the prosecution A1 conspiring with\nA2 planned to kill Preethi Acharya. He made to drink both Preethi\nand Veda beer which he brought from PW. 17`s shop. When the\nsaid Preethi and Veda are drunk and in intoxication, A1 with an\niron rod which he kept in house assaulted Prethi on her head for\nabout 6-7 times and caused bleeding injuries. At that time when\nVeda came to rescue Preethi, A1 also assaulted 6-7 times on the\nhead of Veda and cause bleeding injuries and murdered Preethi\nand Veda. The case based on circumstantial evidence, as the\noffence committed in closed room of the house. The prosecution in\norder to prove the commission of offence or murder by assaulting\non the head of deceased has examined PW. 3,4,5,6,8,9 and 10,\namongst them 3 witnesses are very vital. Mainly PW.1, 3 and 10.\nhowever the other witnesses have partly turned hostile. But PW.\n3,5,8,9,10 supported in respect of A1 being present in the spot on\nthe day before incident and on the day of incident.\n\n 76\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n 107. It is relevant to appreciate the evidence of PW. 1. She\nhas stated that on the day of incident there was tense situation in\nthe house of Preethy Acharya. She stated that her daughter i.e.\ndeceased Preethy Acharya called her in the night at 10.30 and\nsaid Preethy Acharya expressed fear and life threat. She informed\nher that A1 given life threat to Veda also.A1 threatened them with\ndire consequences. At that time PW. 1 console her to go inside the\nroom and lock the door and when she arrive in the morning open\nthe door. The defense disputed regarding the conversation\nbetween Preethy Acharya and PW. 1. Defense try to elicit that\nthere is no call records collected during investigation. Further it\nhas also disputed that said PW. 1 has not travelled from Bombay.\nShe was very much present in the house. The I.O has not\ncollected the details regarding travel and collected call details. But\nthe witness PW. 3, 4,5 depose that PW. 1 came from Bombay and\nshe was present in the next morning of incident day. Facts stated\nby PW. 1 regarding fear of threat to life by Preethy is supported by\nthe earlier acts of A1. Preethy Acharya has expressed that A1\nharassed her physically and mentally and the said harassment and\ntorture is aggravated when she lodged complaints against A1 and\nwhen he returned from jail the dispute and quarrel between A1 and\nPreethy Acharya much aggravated. This fact is very much\nsupported by the evidence of witnesses. Hence the fear of Preethy\nAcharya had on the day of incident as stated by PW. 1 cannot be\ndiscarded.\n\n 108. The very crucial evidence is of the evidence of PW. 3.\nHe in his evidence depose that he saw Preethy Acharya, Veda\nand child inside the house in the evening when he returned home\n\n 77\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nfrom his work. On the said day in the night there is quarrel\nbetween Preethy Acharya and A1. It is very much necessary to\nobserve that the said fact of quarrel between A1 and Preethy\nAcharya as stated by PW. 3 is corroborated with the evidence of\nPW. 1. PW. 1 depose that her daughter called her in the night at\n10.30 and stated that A1 quarreled with her since morning and\nexpressed fear of life threat. The fact stated by PW. 3 that there\nwas quarrel between Preethy Acharya and A1 and fact stated by\nPW.1 that her daughter expressed fear conjoins to each other\nleading to infer that there was quarrel between Preethy Acharya\nand A1. Further A1 gave life threat to Preethy Acharya and Veda.\n\n 109. PW. 3 further depose that in the said same night at\nmidnight a woman and child screaming from house at ground\nfloor. Immediately he and his wife came out from house and got\ndown from stairs to messaline floor and he saw A1 going out of\nhis house. They heard screaming of a woman and child in their\nhouse for about 5 minutes, but when they came down screaming\ngot stopped. At that time residents of first floor also came out and\nthey say since they heard screaming sound they came out to see.\nBut they all thought that, the said quarrel is daily routine. They\nreturned to their house and slept. He depose that he heard\nscream at about 1.30 in the night. On next day at 8.30 in the\nmorning when he came down mother of Preethy Acharya crying\ninside the house. When they went to ask PW. 1 she shouting that\nPreethy Acharya and Veda are murdered. They went inside house\nand saw dead body of Preethy Acharya and Veda. They were in\npool of blood and 2 pillows and 2-3 beer tins scattered there.\nWhen inquired with mother of Preethy Acharya, she told that\n\n 78\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nPreethy Acharya expressed fear to stay there and Preethy\nAcharya told her that, A1 had quarrel in the morning and she had\nthreat to stay with A1. At that time PW. 1 told her that, she will\ncome in the morning and till morning do not open the door, but A1\nmurdered her daughter and Veda.\n\n 110. During cross-examination by PP treating him partly\nhostile he depose and admitted the suggestion that the building\nwhere they staying had electric light facility and with the help of\nthat he saw A1 going out of his house. He also admit that after\nsome time screaming of woman got stopped and only child cry\nwas heard. To which he further depose that screaming got stopped\nonce A1 gone out of the house. He also admits that the residents\nof the house came out hearing the scream. But they talking that\nChandrashekhar harassing wife and it is not possible to stay\npeacefully here, hence they went home and slept.\n\n 111. To discredit the evidence of PW. 3, A1 and his counsel\ncross examined him, during cross-examination defense try to elicit\nthat it is not possible to see any person going out of the house of\nA1. It is suggested that since the house of PW. 3 is in 2 nd floor and\nhouse of A1 is in ground floor, it is not possible to see who come\nand go to A1`s house. The said suggestion is admitted by PW. 3.\nHe denied the suggestion that he has not seen A1 on the day of\nincident at 1.30 a.m. He further depose that at that time he did not\nsee properly but saw wearing of pant and half shirt. At that time\nthere is no weapon in the hands of A1. He admitted that he has not\nseen A1 assaulting on head of Preethy Acharya and Veda with\niron rod. He further depose that he cannot identify whether the\nscream is of life threat or normal scream. He stated that he heard\n\n 79\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nscream around 2-3 minutes. He stated that said screaming sound\ncame from ground floor to 2nd floor. He stated that he did not gone\nto see what happened after hearing scream as because he did not\nthought such incident happened and when saw A1 he thought that\nit was their family matter and went back to his house.\n\n 112. During cross-examination by advocate for A1,\nsuggestion was put up that in the building there is light facility and\nwith that help he saw A1 going outside his house. The said\nsuggestion is admitted by PW. 3 and to that effect he gave\nstatement to police. The said evidence is corroborated with\nevidence of PW. 10 Nethra. She depose that in the month of April\n2013 at about 1.00 in the night twice she heard a woman`s\nscream but she did not know from which house the said sound\ncame. And next day morning when she returned from walk she\nsaw police jeep and motor vehicles standing in front of A1`s house.\nThen she heard that there is murder in that house. She further\nstates that she gave statement to the police that in the night at\n1.00 she heard scream of a woman. After that she came to know\nthat there are 2 murders in the house of A1. She heard that A 1\nassaulted both deceased with iron rod and committed murder.\nHowever the A1 during cross-examination has not disputed the\nsaid fact regarding hearing of scream of woman in the night by\nPW. 10.\n\n 113. The entire testimony of PW. 3 and 10 if appreciated\nthey speak about the crucial fact that, on the day of incident they\nheard scream of woman and child, PW. 3 states that he has seen\nA1 going out side the house at 1.30 in the night and when he gone\nout the sound of screaming got stopped. It is relevant to appreciate\n\n 80\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nthe fact that there is no dispute that the said Preethy Acharya and\nVeda were murdered. There is no another theory or contrary to the\nsaid fact. It is amply clear from medical evidence and other\nmaterial evidence that the said Preethy Acharya and Veda are\nbrutally assaulted on their head and causing bleeding injury\nmurdered them. The question remains who killed them. The\ntestimony of PW. 1,3,5,8 clearly states that on the day of incident\nA1 was present in the house and they heard the quarrel between\nPreethy Acharya and A1. As discussed earlier PW.1 and 3 states\nthat on the day of incident A1 had quarrel with Preethy Acharya\nand same is clear from evidence of PW. 3 that he heard the\nquarrel. It is clear from evidence that the said Preethy Acharya and\nVeda were assaulted with hard object and as stated by\nprosecution by iron rod. The medical evidence i.e. PW. 26 depose\nthat with MO.15 type of weapon the deceased Preethy Acharya\nand Veda were assaulted on their head and cause bleeding\ninjuries and death is due to shock and hammerhage. It can be\ninferred that when the deceased were assaulted by an object\nMO.1 they might scream out of fear and blow on their head. Only\nwhen assailant assault one woman, the other woman seeing the\nsame got scared and out of fear shouted or scream. The same\nwas heard by Pw. 3 and 10. This fact of hearing by PW. 3 cannot\nbe discarded as because PW. 10`s evidence corroborate the\nsame. However if the evidence of PW. 10 does not corroborate\nsame then the scenario would be different. But she depose in the\nline of PW. 3.\n\n 114. However it is also necessary to observe that PW.\n4,5,6,8 who are the neighbors have not heard the said scream\n\n 81\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nand they did not come out. They have turned hostile to the case of\nprosecution in this regard. However they have supported case of\nprosecution in all other facts. But the question would arise why\nwould two witnesses lie i.e. PW. 3 and 10. There is no reason for\nthem to lie as their evidence is natural without taint. However A1\nduring cross-examination of PW 5 try to establish that PW. 3 had\nsome difference in respect of payment of maintenance of building,\nbut the said fact is not sufficient to hold that PW. 3 tell lie in such a\nserious circumstance of this case. Even though, why would PW. 10\nlie. It can be inferred that the said evidence of PW. 3 and 10 are\nnatural and their testimony cannot be discarded. It is clear from\ntheir testimony that on the day of incident a woman scream out.\n\n 115. Here very pertinent question came to mind that whether\nthere is any 4th person intervened in the given facts in the night on\nthe day of incident or another question whether any attempt to\nrobbery and during that Preethy Acharya and Veda got assaulted\nand done to death. If these questions put in given circumstance\nthe answer would be negative. As because on appreciation of\nentire evidence there is no material regarding intervention of any\n4th person on the relevant time on the day of incident. Further\nthere is no articles robbed from the house and there is no material\nto that effect in the evidence that the articles are missing from the\nhouse. Then the theory of robbery has to be ruled out. Now the\nquestion, is there any other person present on the day of incident\nat relevant time in the night?.\n\n 116. The defense mainly A1 puts up theory that said Preethy\nAcharya had dispute with many people from Bangalore,\nMangalore and Bombay and they use to visit the house of A1 in his\n\n 82\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nabsence. Further another theory put up by A1 that son of Ramdas\nuse to call Preethy and he intends to marry her and force Preethy\nto leave A1 and come to Bombay. The defense put up these to\ncreate doubt in the given circumstance and show that he is not\nresponsible for the said offence. These theories have no\nsubstance, they are put during cross-examination very vaguely\nwithout substantial concrete defense. The said defense are\nrandom. On one hand it states that, she had dispute with many\npeople and in another stretch, son of Ramdas forcing her and in\nanother stretch, it is stated that her first husband had dispute with\nher. On appreciation of evidence there is no whisper of\nintervention of 4th person even remotely available.\n\n 117. Another very strong theory of defense is that, which is\nput up during cross-examination of PW.1 and in the written\nsubmission submitted by A1 after recording statement u/sec. 313\nof \nCr.PC\n . That, PW. 1 mother of Preethy Acharya was present in\nthe house on day of incident. She has assaulted Preethy Acharya\nand Veda and she has murdered them. The reason for the same\nexplained by A1 in his written submission. He states that CW. 4\nPurushotham was forcing the deceased Preethy Acharya to allow\nVeda to reside in the house of A1. This fact is seriously objected by\nPW. 1. For the reason that the deceased Veda would further\nreveal matter of PW.1`s personal matter to A1. But Preethy\nAcharya kept Veda with her in the residence of A1, against the\nwish of PW.1. This made PW. 1 angry and she use to quarrel with\ndeceased threatening that she would kill both Preethy Acharya and\nVeda. PW. 1 warned A1 to not allow Veda to stay in his residence.\nWhen he told same to Preethy, she did not listen to his words.\n\n 83\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nThis made PW. 1 to develop enmity with him also and she warned\nhim with dire consequences. This is the explanation given by A1 as\ndefense that PW. 1 is the culprit and she assaulted her daughter\nand Veda. The theory of defense is very vague and without\nsubstance. A1 during cross-examination of witnesses mainly PW.\n1 has not even putup single suggestion or question to that effect.\nThe question is, why would PW. 1 kill both. As because as per\nevidence Veda came to Bangalore only few days before they\ntravel to Mangalore. Moreover as per her evidence, PW. 1 herself\nhas sent Veda with Preethi as safety to Preethi from Mangalore to\nBangalore on 16.4.2013. There is no reason to develop so much\nenmity towards Preethy Acharya and Veda so as to kill by brutally\nassaulting them. Important fact that in the year 2013 she was aged\n62 years. It is not believable that a woman aged 62 years\nassaulted deceased with hard object so brutally and kill them. The\ntheory of defense in this regard in any angle is not acceptable and\nbelievable.\n\n 118. Coming back to the theory of presence of 4 th person\non the relevant time at night on the day of incident. Though A1 put\nup theory that Preethy Acharya had dispute with her first husband\nand disputes with other persons and son of Ramdas had same\nintention. But no material on record to see even remotely to\nconsider the theory. However the line of defense put up is\ninconsistent and seems to be vague, to create doubt and\nsuspicion in the case of prosecution. On the other hand, PW. 3\nstates that he saw A1 going out of house in the night at 1.30 am\non the day of incident. Though during cross-examination, it is try\nto discard his evidence but he stood with his version. Moreover\n\n 84\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nthere is no reason to disbelieve his version. Though A1 raised plea\nof alibi stating that at relevant time he was not present at incident\nspot. He was in the house of A2, but as discussed earlier the\nburden is on the A1 to establish the plea of alibi and he has failed\nto establish same. The another circumstances to be observed that\nA1 was not found on next day of incident on 18.4.2013. all the\nwitnesses corroborate said fact that they have not seen A1 in the\nhouse. This one important fact is very relevant as to why A1 is\nnot present in crime spot or is he absconding.\n\n 119. If all the circumstance put together the cumulative\neffect which leads to infer that on the day of incident in the night\ntime, A1 was present with Preethy Acharya and Veda and no other\nperson was present in the house. There was quarrel between A1\nand Preethy Acharya and A1 assaulted Preethy Acharya and Veda\non the head with iron rod and cause bleeding injuries and due to\nshock and hammerhage they died. Though defense try to put up\ntheories and try to elicit facts which disputes the version of\nprosecution, but the version of PW. 1,3,4,5,8,9,10 are consistent\nwith regard to harassment by A1 to Preethy. There is consistent\nversion of PW. 1,3 and 10 that there was quarrel in the house of\nA1 and PW3 and 10 heard screaming of Women and child. Further\nPW.3 seen A1 going out of his house after hearing screaming of\nwoman and child. On the cumulative effect of testimony PW1, 3\nand 10 the inference can be drawn that they have heard the\nquarrel between A1 and Preethy, and they heard the screaming of\nwomen and child. This circumstance leads to infer that there was\nno 4th person present on the relevant time except A1. If the\nevidence of PW1, 3 and 10 assesed though they have not seen\n\n 85\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nthe incident but there evidence to the extent of presence of A1 and\nquarrel with Preethy at the spot and on the day of incident is very\nmuch believable.\n\n 120. As per \nsec.6\n of evidence Act when the facts are\nrelevant when they are farming part of same transaction. Here\nthough facts narrated by PW1, 3 and 10 are not connected to facts\nin issue but form a part of same transaction. Here the facts\nnarrated by these witnesses in the evidence are relevant facts and\nthe court has to consider those facts which connects to the facts in\nissue. That another aspect is to be appreciated that the defense\ntried to put up the theory of deposing false evidence before court\nby witnesses. They put up suggestion to the effect, but the same is\ncompletely unacceptable as why would PW3 and 10 and other\nwitness depose falsely regarding harassment. As they no where\nconnected to deceased except they are neighbors and they have\nno gain from that. The evidence of the witness is natural and\nwithout any extraneous factors.\n\n 121. The defense in the present case raised some points as\nto disprove the case of the prosecution. Now it has to be\nappreciated that whether the said fact will take away the case of\nthe prosecution. During the Cross Examination of PW29 the IO, it\nis pointed out that, the IO has received information regarding\noffence on 18.04.2013 at 06.00a.m. in the morning and visited spot\nat 07.30 and meanwhile informed PW.1 regarding incident. It is\npointed out that since the police Pre-Judice against A1 hence\ncalled PW1 to inform incident. Another important point raised by\ndefense is that in-spite of receiving information in the morning at\n06.00 a.m. FIR is not registered till lodging of complaint by\n\n 86\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\ncomplainant-PW1 at 9.30 a.m.\n\n 122. The other point raised by defense is that there is no\nfinger print experts were called to identify the finger prints. The\npoint regarding delay in filing FIR even receiving of information at\n6.00 a.m in the morning cannot be said to be fatal to the case of\nthe prosecution. The FIR is registered at 9.30 a.m after lodging\ncomplaint by PW. 1. This cannot be held as inordinate delay\nregarding FIR. It cannot be said in the gap, there is some external\nfactor intervened to implicate accused.\n\n 123. Further PW. 29 the IO admitted that finger print expert\nis not called at crime spot. However he denied that finger print\nexperts called at spot and if the said records produced it reveals\nthat A1 is not involved in offence. The said fact regarding calling\nfinger print expert is may be lapse on part of investigating agency,\nif the prosecution is able to substantiate the commission of\noffence, is sufficient to arrive at the conclusion. During cross-\nexamination it is tried to assert by the defense that whether the\nroom was scattered or whether any mark of dragging of body\nfound. The IO PW. 29 depose that the room in the house were\nnot scattered and the room where the bodies were laying was\nscattered. Further it is also tried to elicit that there was bed and\nalmera in the room. Further the dimension of room is 10X8 feet\nwherein bed covered to extent of 4X6 and almera covered by 2X6.\nSame is admitted by PW. 29. The dimension of room is 80 square\nfeet and 40 square feet was covered by bed and almera. Same is\nalso admitted by PW. 29. It is tried to elicit and same was denied\nby the I.O, that in such small place it is not possible to a man to\nkill 2 adult woman. Further it is suggested that when one woman\n\n 87\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nwas assaulted by assailant another woman can assault to said\nassailant. Further it is suggested that there was child present and\nno blood found on the clothes of child. It is not possible in such\nroom to assault woman without there being blood smear on the\nclothes of child. The said suggestion also denied by the I.O. PW.\n\n29. He admitted that there is no blood stains on the bed. He\ndepose that pillows were blood stained and also found 3 empty\nbeer cans.\n\n 124. It is further elicited by defense that, during cross-\nexamination of PW.29 that after arrest of A1 he was not subjected\nto medical test. It is suggested that at that time there is no sign that\nhe drunk alcohol. To which PW.29 depose that he was not\nsubjected to medical examination regarding drinking alcohol. It is\nfurther cross examined that, though the viscera of deceased\ncollected and subjected to analysis, but report given that alcohol\nnot found in the body of deceased. To which PW.29 depose that,\nthe said report shows that in the test conducted the articles not\nresponded.\n\n 125. Another fact is tried to be elicited that, the said\ndeceased women aged 38 and 36 years and they were well built.\nTo which PW.9 depose it depends on the physical and medical\ncondition of those women. PW.9 admit that at the time of incident\nA1 aged 56 years. It is suggested a person aged 56 years cannot\nassault and kill women aged 38 and 36 years, the same is denied\nby PW.29. It is also suggested that, if a person assaulting, to save\nlife they might have counter attack assailant. The said suggestion\nis denied by PW.29. He admits that no injury mark found on body\nof A1. It is suggested that since he is not participated in the said\n\n 88\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\noffence no marks found. The said suggestion also denied by\nPW.29.\n\n 126. The point which are raised during cross-examination\nare need to be analyzed. The present case is based on\ncircumstantial evidence. The offence committed within four walls of\nthe house. There is no eye witness to the said offence. The\ncommission of offence has to be inferred from the material\nevidence placed before the court and also on proved facts and\ncircumstances. It is found from evidence that the entire home is\nnot scattered only a room, where bodies found was scattered. By\nthis it is clear that the incident took place in a room where bodies\nfound. During the incident or commission of offence the room got\nscattered. Further it is clear that the deceased were assaulted in\nthe said room only, as there is no mark of dragging bodies. At this\njuncture it is relevant to analyze Ex.P3 to 10 the photographs of\nbodies. Ex.P3 and 9 are the photos of dead body of Preethy.\nEx.P6, 7 are the photos of dead body of Veda and Ex.P5, 8 and 10\nare the photos of dead bodies together. On careful perusal of\nthese exhibits, it is found that, the said deceased were assaulted\nin the said room only. The said deceased were might have sitting\non the floor where they were assaulted. As because there are no\nblood stains found on the bed but found on the wall where\ndeceased Veda lying. There is no blood found except the place\nwhere the dead bodies lying. If the deceased were on the bed or\nother part of room where they assaulted there will be blood on\nthose parts. From this it can be inferred that the deceased were\nsitting on the floor where they were assaulted and on assault they\nlayed there only.\n\n 89\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n 127. Now coming to the defense of accused, it is point of\ndefense that, the room measure 80 sq. ft. and there are coat and\nalmera . They cover 40 sq. ft. and in such conditions and in\nremaining small place, it is not possible for a person to assault two\nwoman. As stated above the said women were assaulted in the\nroom when they were sitting. On perusal of Exhibits 3 to 10 there\nis no sign of struggle when they were assaulted. The said bodies\nwere found in pool of blood. They were assaulted on head. The\nsaid assault was made when they were in stagnant position may\nbe sitting. This can happen when the injured is not in a condition to\nmake major movement. It can be inferred that the said deceased\nwere made to drink and when they were inebriation they were\nassaulted on head. Otherwise if they were in awaken conditions\nthere was struggle and when they got injured on initial blow, they\nmight make movement and try to escape and the blood will be\nsplashed in other parts of room. But there is no sign of trying to\nescape by deceased. On perusal of flow of blood and blood\nstains it is found that they were assaulted with object many times\nwith great force. The assailant was well aware about the condition\nof women and the said assault does not seems to be result of\nsudden provocation or act of sudden reaction. The assailant with\nall care and caution, planned and looking to the condition,\nassaulted the deceased without giving room to escape.\n\n 128. It is necessary to observe that there are two woman\npresent at the spot. There might be situation that, when assailant\nassaulting one woman, then other might try to rescue woman who\nwas under assault. But their condition may such that they cannot\nfully resist assailant. The said Veda resisted and same can be\n\n 90\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nascertained by Ex.P53 the opinion of PM report No.179/2013 of\nVeda, wherein it is mentioned that external injury no.6 and 7 could\nhave been caused during struggle (defense wounds) i.e.,\ncontusion measuring 8x9 cm present over middle part of back of\nboth side of forearm. Contusion measuring 4x4 cm present over\nthe back of both hand. This revels that there is struggle between\nassailant and deceased Vedha during assault and there were\ndefense wounds on forearm and back of hand, but still she was\nassaulted on her head and done to death.\n\n 129. It is pertinent to observed that the deceased were\ninsuch condition that they are not in a position resist while they\nwere assaulted. This leads to infer that they were inebriation\ncondition. It is not in dispute that 3 empty beer cans found in the\nroom near the dead body, same can be ascertained from Ex.P2\nspot mahazer and also the evidence of witnesses. However the\nFSL report, Ex.P60 speaks that, the colour test and gas\nchromatographic methods have not responded for the presence of\nethyl alcohol in article no.1,2,3,5,6 and 7. No other poison was\ndetected in the articles. The articles are viscera of deceased\nPreethy stomach and its contents, portion of lever and kidney and\nblood and viscera of deceased Veda, portion of lever and kidney\nand blood. The reports states that, the articles does not respond to\nthe test for presence of alcohol, but the condition of dead body\nreveals that the deceased were assaulted when they were in\nstagnant position without any movement. On perusal of Ex.P.3 to\n10, if dead bodies seen it can be inferred that under two\nconditions such assaulte can be made, when the victim was\nsleeping or when because of intoxication or other reasons the\n\n 91\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nvictim was not in a position to make major movement. The Ex.P3\nto 10 and condition of dead bodies do not reveal that there exists\nany sign of struggle or sign of escape that even blood not found on\nbed. It is not in dispute that deceased were assaulted by assailant.\nThe victims were assaulted on head with great force and no\nchance given to them to escape or even chance to resist which\ncan be ascertained from opinion PM report where there is no\nstruggle or defense wound on the body of deceased Preethy. It is\nvery much clear that they were brutally assaulted on there head.\nThat PM report of Preethy and Veda Ex.P47 and 50 reveals that all\nthe injuries were ante mortem. That the injuries cause before\ndeath. Clearly speaks that they are assaulted on their head and\ndue to head injuries they succumbed to death.\n\n 130. The defense of accused is that A1 aged 56 years and\nthe deceased women aged 38 and 36 years, it is not possible to\nassault two woman aged 38 and 36 years and kill them by 56\nyears aged person. The point is to be observed that, it depends\nupon the condition of women who were assaulted. As discussed\nearlier the deceased were assaulted in such condition when they\nwere not in a position to make major movement or they may be\nunder the influence of alcohol or for other reason, at that time, it is\npossible to assault woman who were under such condition. As\ndiscussed earlier at the cost of repetition there is no dispute that\ndeceased found dead and they were assaulted on their head. If\nthe condition are such that they are not in a position to resist, the\nperson aged 56 years can assault woman aged 38 and 36 years\nand kill them.\n\n 131. The other defense of the accused that, a child was\n\n 92\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\npresent in the house at the time of incident and in a room under\nsuch condition and in small portion of room, it is not possible to\nassault two woman without there being blood stains on the cloths\nof child. It is very pertinent to observe that, from evidence it do not\nreveal where the child was in the said home. Even none of\nwitness speak where the child was. That child may be in the room\nwhere deceased found dead as because on the day of incident the\nwitnesses heard scream of child and woman. There is every\npossibility in a condition where dead bodies found, there is no\nblood stains on the cloths of child. It is not clear from evidence in\nwhich part of room child was there. As discussed above except the\nportion of room where dead bodies found there is no blood stains\nin other part of room, that even on bed or cot which was beside the\ndead bodies lying. Hence there is every possibility that blood\nstains may not fall on the clothes of child when deceased\nassaulted.\n\n 132. On appreciation of entire evidence in this regard the\ntestimony of 1,3,5and 8 reveals that A1 was present in his house a\nday before incident and on the day of incident. PW.3 and 5 speaks\nthat there was quarrel between A1 and Preethy in the said night of\nincident. The testimony of PW.1 corroborates the testimony of\nPW.3 and 5. wherein she depose that, Preethy called her\nexpressed fear and life threat. Further PW.3 and 10 depose that,\non the day of incident at night at 1.30 AM they heard scream of\nwoman and child. PW.3 further states that, he saw A1 going out of\nhis house. The evidence of prosecution reveals that, the said\ndeceased found dead in the room and their dead body found in\npool of blood. The medical evidence mainly the evidence of PW.26\n\n 93\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nreveals that, the deceased were assaulted with type of weapon\nMO.1 Iron Rod. The said Injuries are possible if the said MO.1 use\nto assault. The deceased were assaulted on head and death is\ndue to shock and hammerhage as a result of severe head injuries.\n\n 133. As discussed earlier there is no material or evidence of\npresence of fourth person, other-than Preethy and Veda and her\nchild and A1 in the house on the relevant time on the day of\nincident. The condition of dead bodies points that, the deceased\nwere assaulted on head in a condition, when they were not in a\nposition to make major movement as there is no sign of struggle or\nescape, it is inferred as because the blood is only on the floor and\nthere is no blood stains on other parts of room except the portion\nwhere dead bodies were lying and not even on the bed which is\nbeside the dead bodies. It leads to infer that assailant observing\ncondition of two woman assaulted on head with force without\ngiving chance to escape. All these facts leads to infer that apart\nfrom Preethy, Veda and child A1 was present in the spot and he\nmade such condition that Preethy and Veda should not escape or\nmake major movement and assaulted them with hard object MO.1\nIron rod on the head of deceased brutally and cause bleeding\ninjuries and due to head injuries the said deceased succumbed to\ndeath. He killed Veda also because she might disclose the fact\nregarding murder of Preethy or during assault on Preethy she tried\nto rescue her and out of anger A1 also killed Veda by assaulting\non her head and murdered both Preethy and Veda.\n\n 132(a) The act of A1 in given condition as discussed earlier\nis per-meditated and planned, that both deceased were brought to\nsuch condition that there shall not be resistance and escape. The\n\n 94\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nassault was brutal and which cause death of both. A1 have\nknowledge and intention and he Know that assault is so\nimmensely dangerous that in all probability death will cause and\nhis act causes bodily injury as his likely to cause death and from\nthe condition of accused it is clear that A1 incurs no remorse. The\nact of A1 squarely comes under \nSection 300(4)\n of IPC.\n\nVIII] Motive\n\n 134. In a case rests on circumstantial evidence the\nexistence of motive assumes significance though the absence of\nmotive does not necessarily discredit the prosecution case. In this\ncase there is ample evidence on the record to show that A1 had\nmotive to commit the alleged offence. It is the argument of defense\nthat, motive in this case is very weak. The prosecution did not\nestablished motive in this case. A1 had no motive to commit crime.\nIt is argued that, the prosecution relied on two cases filed by\ndeceased Preethy. A1 got upset with lodging of complaint and\ncommitted crime. But in the said two cases A1 was acquitted for\nlack of evidence. It is argued that after lapse of nine months from\ntwo cases the incident took place. There is no connection between\ntwo cases and alleged incident. It is also argued, that if A1\nharassed Preethy why she was residing with A1. It is also tried to\nput out during cross-examination and even in written submission\nsubmitted by A1 that, A1 is a good charactered person, he used to\nwork, look-after family, he has no drinking habit and he has good\nreputation as he was honored with many awards. He also placed\nrecords along with written submission to show that he is a good\n\n 95\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nperson and had no melafide intentin. By that it is tried to prove that\nthere is no motive to kill deceased Preethy and Veda.\n\n 135. The prosecution case in this regard is that A1 had two\nunsuccessful marriage and with deceased Preethy he had 3 rd\nmarriage. He was in the habit of drinking. After marriage A1 started\nharass deceased Preethy both physically and mentally. He forced\nher to go out and work, lookafter family and manage house. There\nis dispute between A1 and Preethy and there is no cordial\nrelationship. The deceased Preethy after bearing harassment\nlodged complaints before Girinagar P.S. and A1 was arrested and\nsent to Jail and after returning from jail, the harassment\naggravated. Again Preethy lodged complaint before police and\nagain A1 was sent to jail After returning from jail harassment of A1\nintensified, he use to threaten Preethy stating that she sent him jail\nand he was humiliated and he will kill here and threatened her with\ndire consequences and he had intention to kill for all she had done\nand as a result he murdered Preethy and Veda.\n\n 136. The prosecution witness mainly PW.1, 3, 4, 5,8 and 9\ntestify that there is quarrel between A1 and Preethy. There was rift\nand dispute between A1 and Preethy. The relationship was not\ncordial. The testimony of these witnesses discussed in the earlier\npart i.e. strain relationship between A1 and Preethy. They speak\nthat, the said Preethy use to share fact regarding harassment by\nA1. The said witness heard quarrel between A1 and Preethy on\ndaily basis. The said Preethy was very much disturbed by the\nsame. She shared her agony with each one of the witnesses\nstated above. The prosecution witnesses mainly PW.3, 4, 5, 8 and\n9 specifically supported the fact that there was dissension between\n\n 96\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nA1 and Preethy. A1 use to harass her. The said Preethy after\nbearing harassment lodged two complaints in CC No.21188/2012\nand CC No.22335/2012 (Ex.12 to 17). The said lodging of 1st\ncomplaint before Girinagar police for the harassment to which said\nPW.3 is witness. A1 was arrested on the basis of complaints and\nsent to jail and after returning from jail the harassment got\naggravated by A1. Further again she lodged complaint before\npolice and again he was arrested and sent to jail and he was\nreleased on bail. After returning from jail, A1 humiliated by that\nand annoyed started to harass Preethy and threatened her with\ndire consequences.\n\n 137. On perusal of Ex.P12 and 13 two complaints filed by\nPreethy against A1 reveals that she was subjected to harassment\nby A1. The said fact is corroborated by the testimony of PW.1\nmother of Preethy and PW.3, 4, 5, 8 and even by PW.16 the\nprincipal of Little Flower School where Preethy was working as\nteacher. The said Preethy about to leave A1 and go back to\nBombay and same is also testified by the witnesses PW.3, 8, 9\nand 16. They speaks that Preethy told them that she is going back\nto Bombay as it is impossible to live with A1. The testimony of\nPW.1,3 and 5 reveals that, after coming back from jail the quarrel\nbetween A1 and Preethy get aggravated and harassment got\nintensified. This leads to infer that A1 annoyed by same, which\nleads to develop enmity. PW.1 depose that on the day of incident\nPreethy contacted her and said Peethy was under fear and life\nthreat as A1 quarreling with her since morning. The facts leads to\ninfer that there is dispute between A1 and Preethy when Preethy\nlodged complaints and A1 was arrested and sent to jail he got\n\n 97\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nhumiliated and developed enmity on Preethy. This again infuses to\ninfer as because, as per A1 he was well reputed musician and he\nwas honored with awards and he visited many events and places\nlike SAARC and Maldives. He was well respected in the society.\nBut the act of Preethy lodging complaint and sending him jail might\nannoyed him and that leads to develop enmity and in order to take\nrevenge he hatched plan to eliminate Preethy. The fact that he had\nsome intention or design to do something to Preethy, the said fact\nbe inferred when he brought 3 beer cans from PW.17's bar. The\nsaid PW.17 testified that the said A1 came to his bar on the day of\nincident i.e., 17.04.2013 at 10.30 P.M in the night, he took parcel of\n3 tins of beer. PW.17 also identifies MO.5 to 7 the said 3 beer\ncans. The said 3 tins found near the dead bodies of Preethy and\nVeda. This leads to infer that A1 has developed enmity against\nPreethy and as discussed earlier the condition in which dead\nbodies found indicates that the murder was planned and\nexecuted. The said planning may not be done without motive of\neliminating Preethy. Therefore it is held that prosecution has\nsuccessfully established the existence of motive on the part of the\naccused to commit crime.\n\nIX] Recovery of Incriminating Article;\n\n 138. It is the case of the prosecution that, the said crime\ncommitted by using MO.1 Iron Rod, the deceased were assaulted\non the head with Iron rod and cause bleeding injury due to said\nhead injury the deceased were succumb to death. In an criminal\ncase the recovery of incriminating article is one of the important\nfact to be established by the prosecution. To establish the said fact\nthe prosecution examined PW.2, 7 and 29. PW.2 and 7 are the\n\n 98\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\npunch witness to the spot mahazer and recovery mahazer. PW.29\nis the investigating officer. Ex.P2 is the spot mahazer conducted\non 18.04.2013 and Ex.P-11 the recovery mahazer which is\nmentioned as running panchanama dated 18.04.2013. To prove\nthe said recovery the prosecution relied upon evidence of PW.2\nand PW.7. PW. 2 depose that, he and CW.3 heard that there is a\nmurder in the house behind Nanda Gokul Kalyan Mantapa and\nthey want to see. At that time Girinagar Police ask him to be panch\nwitness. He agreed to the same. In his presence spot mahazer is\nconducted and the police have collected the blood samples and\narticles mainly two pillows and three kingfishers beer tins. The\npolice drawn the mahazer and he signed to the said mahazer.\nFurther he identified the Ex.P2 spot mahazer and his signature.\nHe also identified signature on MO.1 to7. Further he identified the\ndeceased Preethi and Veda in Ex.P3 to 10 photographs. He\nfurther depose that, in the evening at 5.15 again police were called\nhim to be a witness for the recovery at the instance of accused\nno.1. He depose that, accused no.1 led the police to his house and\nhe took to his room opposite to the room where dead bodies\nfound. There he produced one track pant, black and red color half\nshirt which were put in hanger. The said clothes were blood\nstained. Police seized the same and drawn mahazar Ex.P. 11.\nThe said mahazar written in the evening 5.54 p.m From there at 50\nmeters he took them to place where he hidden said rod which was\nuse to commit offence. The said place is a drainage between two\nvacant sites. There was no water flowing. There he produced one\niron rod which had blood stains. The said article was seized. He\nidentified the mahazar and signature on mahazar and MO.1.\n\n 99\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n 139. Further PW. 7 examined by prosecution to establish\nthe fact of recovery. The said witness also depose in the line of\nPW. 2. the testimony of PW. 7 is similar to PW. 2. He has also\nidentified mahazar at Ex.P.2 and 11. The testimony of both\nwitnesses is corroborative to each other. Both the witnesses are\ncross examined by A1 and his counsel. If the line of cross-\nexamination of PW. 1 and 11 is carefully analyzed there is\nconsistency in the evidence of PW. 2 and 11. The cross-\nexamination is in the line of suggestion almost in the line of\nadmitting the facts and circumstances of recovery. There is an\nattempt to elicit disruption of places both home of A1 and place\nfrom where MO. 15 rod is recovered. Only denial statements in\ncross-examination to elicit contradiction and omission in the\nevidence of PW. 2 and 7. But PW. 2 and 7 withstood their version\nof evidence. The testimony of PW 2 and 7 is consistent.\n\n 140. However it is argued by defense that as per the\nevidence of Pw. 29 I.O. He has visited house of A1 in the morning\nand drawn mahazar in the morning and depose that he searched\nhouse of A1, collected articles. If that is the case why the PW. 2\nand 7 are called again in the evening at 5.00 p.m to draw mahazar.\nThe said pant and shirt MO. 13 and 14 may be recovered in the\nmorning during spot mahazar when I.O. visited crime spot. It is\nargued that the said fact creates doubt regarding drawing of\nmahazar and recovery of articles.\n\n 141. During cross-examination of PW. 29 it is elicited that\nI.O. inspected entire house and recovered articles. He depose that\nin other room he has not seized any articles. That MO. 15 is not\nrecovered during spot mahazar. Here it is one interesting\n\n 100\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nsuggestion put that I.O. has not suspected PW. 1 complainant.\nPW. 29 depose that there is no reason to suspect PW. 1. To which\ndefense put up suggestion that, the assailant knowing fully well\nabout weapon and to escape from offence lodged complaint\nstating that with the same weapon offence was committed. The\ntheory of defense try to put up is that PW. 1 assaulted deceased\nand to escape from alleged offence and to project herself as\ninnocent, points at the weapon MO. 15 that with the said MO. 15\ndeceased were assaulted. At this juncture the defense points at\nevidence of PW. 1. where as per complainant MO. 15 iron rod was\nlaying beside dead body. The said part of complaint is marked as\nEx.D.1. It is pointed out that as per other witnesses to mahazar,\nMO. 15 was recovered somewhere else. By this it is tried to\ndispense the recovery.\n\n 142. During cross-examination of PW. 29 it is suggested that\nthere is no problem to draw separate mahazar as there is running\nmahazar. To which PW. 29 depose that there is no necessity to\ndraw separate mahazar. It is also suggested that in the mahazar\nwright and dimension of iron rod not mentioned which is denied by\nPW. 29.\n\n 143. If the testimony of PW. 2 and 7 and 29 appreciated,\nPW. 2 and 7 consistently stated that they were present during\nmahazar both at the time of drawing mahazar Ex.P. 2 and 11 the\nspot mahazar and running mahazar. During drawing of Ex.P.11\naccused led the police and police recovered MO. 13 and 14 blood\nstained pant and shirt and MO. 15 iron rod. Here the relevant point\nto be observed that the recovery of MO. 13 and 14 the track pant\nand shirt is not convincing. If carefully observed and analyzed why\n\n 101\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nan assailant keep blood stained clothes putting them in hanger. He\nalways try to conceal the articles and not put them in a room in a\nhanger. However the said articles are recovered by I.O. but in\nrespect of recovery of MO. 15 the testimony of witnesses mainly\nPW. 2 and 7 is consistent. The defense also not able to discredit\nthe testimony of these witnesses. Even during cross-examination\nof PW. 29 It is only suggested that there must be separate\nmahazar. But there is no dispute regarding recovery. It is only\nstated during spot mahazar MO. 15 is not seized, apart from this\nsuggestion there is no cross-examination in the line to disprove or\ndiscredit the recovery of M.O. 15 . The testimony of PW. 2 and 7 is\nnot countered with PW. 29. However the lapses on the part of\ndefense cannot be considered. But the testimony of PW 2 and 7 is\nvery consistent regarding recovery of MO. 15. They withstood\ntheir version. There is no single deviation in their version. Further\nthere is no reason to disbelieve the version of PW. 2 and 7.\nhowever the theory of defense regarding PW. 1 is the person who\nassaulted deceased with MO. 15 and points at MO. 15 is not\nacceptable. The said theory is vague. The version of defense as\nper Ex.D. 1 that as per complaint M.O 15 found near dead bodies\nmay be a exaggeration by PW. 1. That none of the witnesses who\ndescribed crime spot and laying of dead bodies have stated\nregarding iron rod found near dead bodies. Even PW. 2 and 7\nhave not stated that. On over all appreciation of evidence in\nrespect to recovery of incriminating articles the testimony of PW. 2\nand 7 is consistent and there is no material to discredit the same.\nHence it can be held that the prosecution has proved recovery of\nincriminating articles mainly MO. 15.\n\n 102\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nX] PRINCIPLES IN CASES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL\nEVIDENCE\n\n 144. As it could be seen from the facts and evidence that\nentire case rests on circumstances. The Hon`ble Supreme Court\nof India in Sharad Birdichand Sarda vs State of Maharastra\nobserved that;\n\n \n152. Before discussing the cases relied upon by the\n High Court we would like to cite a few decisions on the\n nature, character and essential proof required in a\n criminal case which rests on circumstancial evidence\n alone. The most fundamental and basic decisions of\n this Court is \nHanumant vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n.\n\nThis case has been uniformly followed and applied by\n this Court in a large number of later decisions upto date\n for instance, the cases of Tufail (Alias) Simmi vs. State\n of Uttar Pradesh and \nRamgopal vs. State of\n Maharashtra\n.\n \nIt may be useful to extract what Mahajan,\n J. has \nlaid down in\n \nHanumanth\n case;\n\n \"It is well to remember that in cases where the\n evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the\n circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to\n be drawn should in the first instance be fully\n established, and all the facts so established should be\n consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the\n accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a\n conclusive nature and tendency and they should be\n such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one\n proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a\n chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any\n reasonable grounds for a conclusion consistent with the\n innocence of the accused and it must be such as to\n show that within all human probability the act must have\n been done by the accused.\"\n\n 153. A close analysis of this decision would show that\n the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case\n\n 103\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n against an accused can be said to be fully established:\n\n (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of\n guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.\n\n It may be noted here that this Court indicate that the\n circumstances concerned \"must or should\" and not\n \"may be\" established. There is not only a grammatical\n but a legal distinction between \"may be proved\" and\n \"must be or should be proved\" as was held by this Court\n in Shivaji Shahabro Bobade vs. State of Maharashtra\n where the observations were made: (SCC para 19,\n p.807: SCC (Cri) p.1047)\n \"Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused\n must be and not merely, may be guilty before a court\n can convict and the material distance between 'may\n be' and 'must be' is long and divides vague conjectures\n from sure conclusion\".\n\n (2) the fact so established should be consistent only\n with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to\n say, they should not be explainable on any other\n hypothesis except that the accused is guilty,\n (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive\n nature and tendency,\n (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis\n except the one to be proved, and\n (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not\n to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion\n consistent with the innocence of the accused and must\n show that in all human probability the act must have\n been done by the accused.\n\n 154. these five golden principles, if we may say so,\n constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based\n on circumstantial evidence.\n\nIf the principles envisaged in the above authority if applied to the\npresent case it has to be seen whether the prosecution passes\nthrough the tests of five golden principles explained by Hon`ble\nApex Court as a 'panchsheel'. On appreciation of the evidence in\nthis case in totality, it can be inferred that the prosecution is able\nto establish the circumstances. It is not in dispute that the\n\n 104\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\ndeceased Preethy Acharya is the wife of A1. It is also not in\ndispute that they both living together in the house of A1 which is\nthe crime spot. The prosecution examined PW. 3,4,5,6,8,9 and 10\nthe neighbors of A1 and Preethy Acharya who resided in the same\nbuilding where the deceased Preethy and A1 resided. They have\nbeen examined to establish the strain relationship between A1 and\nPreethy Acharya and also to establish the very crucial point that A1\nuse to harass Preethi Acharya and they have witnessed the said\nfacts which they depose in their evidence. The prosecution is able\nto establish the fact that there is a strain relationship between A1\nand deceased Preerthy and A1 use to harass Preethy Acharya.\n\n 145. The prosecution examined PW. 1,3,5,8 to establish the\nfact that on the day of incident and prior to the day of incident the\naccused No.1 was present in the house and there is quarrel\nbetween A1 and deceased Preethy. The fact is the offence\ncommitted within the closed walls of house of accused No.1.\nThere is no eye witnesses. The commission of offence has to be\ninferred from the material available on record. On appreciation of\nevidence mainly Ex.P.3 to 10 the photographs of dead bodies and\nrelevant records the said assault on both deceased were brutal\nand on keen observation of the records it can be inferred that they\nwere assaulted under such circumstances where the deceased\nwere not able to make major movement like struggle or escape as\ncounter attack. They were assaulted in such a manner, they\nsuccumbed to death on the spot only. This fact is very relevant\nbecause the A1 raised plea of alibi stating that he was not present\non 16,17 and 18th of April 2013. However as discussed supra the\n\n 105\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nplea of alibi raised by A1 is not sufficiently established and same is\nnot acceptable. In this regard the prosecution is able to prove the\nfact through the above said witnesses that, A1 was present on the\ndate of incident. The prosecution has examined PW. 1,3 and 10 to\nestablish the fact that on the day of incident there is a quarrel\nbetween A1 and deceased Preethy and PW. 3 and 10 have\ndepose regarding screaming sound of woman and child heard by\nthese witnesses and PW. 3 depose that after hearing the sound\nhe saw A1 going out of house and on the next day the said\ndeceased Preethy and Veda found dead in the house of A1.\nFurther the prosecution is able to prove that there was a motive\nto commit offence by the A1 by producing oral as well as\ndocumentary evidence. Prosecution examined PW. 1,3,4,5,8, 9\nthat there is a strain relationship and due to that there was a\nquarrel between A1 and Preethy and A1 use to harass both\nphysically and mentally. This fact is corroborated by the\ndocumentary evidence, the prosecution produced documents\nrelating to two complaints lodged by Preethy against A1 for the\ndomestic violence and criminal intimidation. This fact regarding\nmotive is a mental condition , it can be inferred from the facts and\ncircumstances placed before court. It is the fact that the accused\nNo.1 is a musician, he claims to be the reputed person in the\nsociety and when he was arrested and sent to jail he get\nhumiliated and because of that he annoyed that leads to develop\nenmity against deceased Preethy Acharya and that leads to\ncommission of present crime.\n\n 146. Now with regard to recovery though recovery of MO. 13\nand 14 is not so convincing but with regard to recovery of MO. 15\n\n 106\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\niron rod the evidence of PW. 2 and 7 is consistent and there is no\nmaterial to discredit the said evidence.\n\n 147. By appreciating all these evidence it can be said that\nthe circumstances are fully established and the circumstances\nconsistent with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and if\nthe circumferences which are established are carefully observed\nthey are conclusive in nature. As discussed earlier also accused\nNo.1 is the only person who was present on the date of incident\napart from deceased Preethy, Veda and a child of Veda and there\nis no intervention of 4th person on the day of incident. The said\ncircumstances will exclude every possible hypothesis except which\nis proved and the chain of evidence which are produced before the\ncourt is consistent which leave no reasonable ground for the\nconclusion with the innocence of the accused and in all human\nprobability the act is done by the accused No.1 himself. By this it\ncan be safely inferred that the chain of circumstances were fully\nestablished which is consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt\nof the accused. The prosecution has passed the test of\npanchsheel as observed by Hon`ble Apex Court in the above case.\n\n 148. As observed by the Hon`ble Apex Court in Bagathram\nvs. State of Punjan AIR 1954 SC 621 it was laid down that; where\nthe case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances,\nthe cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to\nnegative the innocence of the accused and bring the offences\nhome beyond any reasonable doubt. In the present case also if\nevidence of various facts taken together, they form a chain of\ncircumstances from which the existence of principal fact can be\nlegally presumed. The chain of circumstances which are\n\n 107\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nestablished by prosecution there is an inference that the accused\nis the author of the death of both deceased.\n\n \n149. On appreciation of the evidence there are minor\ndiscrepancies in the evidence of the proseuction placed before this\ncourt. As observed by the Hon`ble Apex Court in AIR 2009 SC\n2959 (\nMallappa Siddappa Alakanur and others vs State of\nKarnataka\n)\n The High Court, firstly, found fault with the Trial Court's\n approach in rejecting the testimony of the witness on\n immaterial and unsubstantial contradictions not relating to\n vital and relevant aspects.\n \nThe High Court also reiterated\n the law \nlaid down by\n this Court in Ramesh S/o \nLaxman\n Gawli vs. State of MP & Ors\n Etc. reported in 2000 (1) SCC\n 243 to the effect that the contradictions, inconsistencies,\n exaggerations or embellishments, minor discrepancies or\n variance in the evidence do not make the prosecution\n doubtful. On the other hand they lend credibility to the\n prosecution version. Even as regards the principles of\n dealing with the judgment of acquittal, the High Court relied\n on the judgment reported as Allarakha K mansuri vs. State\n of Gujarat [2002 (3) SCC 57] wherein this Court has\n reiterated the duty to avoid miscarriage of justice arising\n from acquittal of guilty. Therefore, it cannot be said that the\n High Court was not alive to the fact that it was dealing with\n the judgment of acquittal. The high court has correctly\n proceeded to consider the evidence.\n\nIn this case also there are minor discrepancies. But the said minor\ndiscrepancies in the testimony of witnesses will not take away the\nentire case of the prosecution. If the evidence is appreciated in its\ntotality the prosecution is able to prove the guilt of the accused\nNo.1 through circumstantial evidence.\n\n 108\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nVII] DEFENSE OF accusedD AND FACTS WITHIN HIS\nKNOWLEDGE\n\n 150. If the defense of the accused is looked into there is no\nconsistency in the defense of the accused. The said defenses\nwere discussed supra. There is no specific or concrete defense\nput forth by accused No.1. The attempt is only to point out the\nlacunas in the prosecution, except the cross examination of IO.\nThe cross-examination of all the witnesses is without any line of\ndefense. On one hand he try to put up case that the first husband\nof Preethy had dispute with her and another he puts up suggestion\nthat son of Ramdas use to call deceased Preethy and insist her to\nmarry him and further another defense put forth by A1 that the\ndeceased Preethy had dispute with many persons. All these\ndefenses were to deviate the prosecution case towards the other\npersons. Apart from this another strong defense put up by the\naccused No.1 is that the PW. 1 mother of deceased Preethy is the\nculprit. She herself has assaulted deceased with rod and\ncommitted their murder. That being the case of the defense in\nrespect of commission of offence by other persons, but none of the\ndefenses is probable enough to suspect the version of the\nprosecution.\n\n \n151. As observed earlier the plea of alibi by A1 is not\nacceptable. Now A1 has to explain regarding facts which are within\nhis knowledge. Though he has submitted in his written submission\ndenying case of prosecution and explaining certain facts, but the\nfacts and circumstances put up by the prosecution is consistent\nand points at the guilt of the accused No.1. The explanation which\nare submitted by A1 are not sufficient as the plea of alibi which he\n\n 109\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nputs up has failed. That being so now he has to come up with\nexplanation what has happened on the day of incident. It is not in\ndispute said deceased Preethy and Veda are murdered and it is\nnot disputed that there is disturbance between A1 and Preethy\nand she has lodged complaints. The offence being committed in a\nclosed walls and he being husband of deceased Preethy it Is\nincumbent upon him to offer reasonable and plausible explanation.\nAs observed by the Hon`ble Apex Court in \nState Of Rajasthan vs\nKashi Ram\n 2007 (1) SCC (Cri) 688.\n\n It is not necessary to multiply with authorities. The\n principle is well settled. The provisions of \nSection 106\n\n of the Evidence Act itself are unambiguous and\n categoric in laying down that when any fact is\n especially within the knowledge of a person, the\n burden of proving that fact is upon him. Thus, if a\n person is last seen with the deceased, he must offer\n an explanation as to how and when he parted\n company. He must furnish an explanation which\n appears to the Court to be probable and satisfactory.\n If he does so he must be held to have discharged his\n burden. If he fails to offer an explanation on the basis\n of facts within his special knowledge, he fails to\n discharge the burden casts upon him by \nSection 106\n\n of the Evidence Act. In a case resting on\n circumstantial evidence if the accused fails to offer a\n reasonable explanation in discharge of the burden\n placed on him, that itself provides an additional link in\n the chain of circumstances proved against him.\n \nSection 106\n does not shift the burden of proof in a\n criminal trial, which is always upon the prosecution. It\n lays down the rule that when the accused does not\n throw any light upon facts which are specially within\n his knowledge and which could not support any\n theory or hypothesis compatible with his\n innocence,the Court can consider his failure to\n adduce any explanation, as an additional link which\n\n 110\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n completes the chain. The principle has been\n succinctly stated in Re. Naina Mohd. AIR 1960\n Madras, 218.\n\nFurther in (2014) 4 SCC 42 in case of \nJoshinder Yadav vs. State\nof Bihar\n it is observed as under;\n\n 16. In our opinion, the prosecution having established\n that the accused treated the deceased with cruelty\n and that they subjected her to harassment for dowry,\n the accused ought to have disclosed the facts which\n were in their person and special knowledge to\n disprove the prosecution case that they murdered\n Bindulal Devi. \nSec. 106\n of the Evidence Act covers\n such a situation. The burden which had shifted to the\n accused was not discharged by them. \nIn this\n connection, we may usefully refer to the judgment of\n this Court in \nShambhu Nath Mehra v. State of Ajmer\n.\n Wherein this Court explained how \nSection 101\n and\n \nSection 106\n of the Evidence Act operate. Relevant\n portion of \nthe said judgment\n reads thus;\n\n \"10. \nSection 106\n is an exception to \nSection 101\n.\n \nSection 101\n lays down the general rule about the\n burden of proof.\n\n 101. Burden of proof - Whoever desires any court to\n give judgment as to any legal right or liability\n dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts,\n must prove that those facts exist.'\n Illustration (a) says) -\n\n 111\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n'A desires a court to give judgment that B shall be\npunished for a crime which A says B has\ncommitted.\n\nA must prove that B has committed the crime'\n\n11. This lays down the general rule that in a criminal\ncase the burden of proof is on the prosecution and\n\nSection 106\n is certainly not intended to relieve it of\nthat duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet\ncertain exceptional cases in which it would be\nimpossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult,\nfor the prosecution to establish facts which are\n'especially' within the knowledge of the accused and\nwhich he could prove without difficulty or\ninconvenience.\"\n\n 17. \nIn \nBalram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar\n\nthe prosecution had established the cruel conduct of\nthe accused i.e. her husband and members of his\nfamily and the sufferings undergone by the deceased\nat their hands. The unbearable conduct of the\naccused ultimately resulted in her death by drowning\nin the well in the courtyard of the accused `s house.\nThis Court observed that what happened on the\nfateful night and what led to the deceased`s falling in\nthe well was wholly within the personal and special\nknowledge of the accused. But they kept mum on this\naspect. This court observed that it is true that the\nburden is on the prosecution to prove the case\nbeyond reasonable doubt. But once the prosecution is\n\n 112\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n found to have shown that the accused were guilty of\n persistent conduct of cruelty qua the deceased\n spread over years as was well established from the\n unshaken testimony of father of the deceased, the\n facts which were in the personal knowledge of the\n accused who were present in the house on that\n fateful night could have been revealed by them to\n disprove the prosecution case. This Court observed\n that the accused had not discharged the burden\n which had shifted to them under \nSection 106\n of the\n Evidence Act. While coming to this conclusion, this\n Court relied on Shambhu Nath Mehra.\n\nAs per \nsection 106\n of Evidence Act the accused has to say what\nare the circumstances which are in his knowledge and what might\nhad happened when he and deceased were together. The burden\nshifts on the accused if the prosecution is successful in\nestablishing the guilt of the accused. It is on him to explain facts\nor place circumstances even probable or mere creating doubt in\nthe mind of the court regarding his participation in crime is\nsufficient. If he fails to do so the court has to presume the\nincident and draw inference on the available material on record.\nHere in this case the evidence recorded proves that there are\nincriminating material against him and points at the guilt of the\naccused. All the links of the chain of circumstances has been\nestablished beyond reasonable doubt and the cumulative of these\ncircumstances drive to draw inference as to the guilt of the\naccused No.1 and the facts and circumstances are found to be\n\n 113\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nincompatible with the innocence of the accused. Hence looked\nfrom any angle it has to be now stated that, the prosecution case\npoints to the guilt of the accused No.1 only. Hence he is found\nguilty for the offence of committing murder of deceased Preethy\nacharya and Veda which is punishable under \nSec. 302\n of IPC.\nAccordingly, point No.2 is answered in affirmative.\n\n 152. POINT NO.3: REGARDING COMMON INTENTION\nAND CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY ; It is the case of the prosecution\nthat A1 alongwith A2 have conspired to kill Preethy, in that regard\ncharges were framed u/sec. 109, 120B r/w 34 of \nIPC\n. It is the\nallegation of the prosecution against A2 that A1 and A2 discussed\nwith regard to commission of offence. A1 called A2 in the night at\n9.50 p.m on 17.4.2013 and told that he intends to kill Preethy\nAcharya and Veda and he questioned him that how he will kill\nthem. He told that Preethy Acharya like to drink beer very much\nand he will made them to drink and when they were inebriation he\nwill kill her, hence A2 provoked him and advised him to kill. It is\nthe further case of the prosecution that after sometime again A1\ntelephoned to him and has stated that he assaulted his wife with\niron rod and when Veda intervened he also assaulted Veda and\ncommitted murder. And further he stated that he is going to escape\nand he should not give his phone numbers to others. Hence by\nthat the A2 conspired with A1 and also abated to eliminate\ndeceased Preethy Acharya.\n\n 153. In order to prove the said fact prosecution examined\nPW. 29. According to the prosecution soon after the commission of\nthe offence A1 contacted A2 to his mobile. The prosecution\nprovides no evidence regarding the mobile phone of A2. No doubt\n\n 114\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nA1 may be called A2 and there may be conversation between\nthem. The said fact is only a circumstantial available on record on\nthe basis of which A2 Prabhakar has been arrayed as A2\nalongwith A1 on the ground of conspiracy. In the absence of any\nevidence that they have recovered the mobile phone of A2 and\nalso the said mobile phone belongs to A2, it cannot lead to any\ninference that A2 was involved with A1 in the conspiracy to commit\nthe murder of deceased Preethy and Veda. According to the\nprosecution they have collected the call details. But there is no\nmaterial on record that there is a prior meeting of mind between\nA1 and A2 to design the crime of murder of deceased Preethy.\nFurther on perusal of the entire material on record the prosecution\nhas not placed any cogent and satisfactory evidence that A2 called\nA1 and instigated him to kill Preethy. The allegations against A2\nare that he has abated A1. During the evidence of PW. 29 the\nprosecution is unable to place on record that they have prior\nmeeting or there was conversation between them regarding these\naspect mainly to plan and to execute the murder of Preethy.\nHowever it is clear from the evidence that as stated above the\nprosecution unable to place the call details between A1 and A2.\nOn appreciation of material placed on record apart from statement\nof A2 and suggestions made during the cross examination\nabsolutely there is no material placed regarding conspiracy to\ncommit offence.\n\n 154. As per the provision u/sec. 120 (A) there must be a prior\nmeeting of minds to plan and execute the said offence. The\ncriminal conspiracy is done in privacy and in secrecy. The direct\nevidence in proof of criminal conspiracy is not available. Offence of\n\n 115\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nconspiracy can be proved by either direct or circumstantial\nevidence. It is always not possible to give affirmative evidence to\nprove formation of criminal conspiracy. The persons who involved\nin the formation of conspiracy and the object, all these are matter\nof inference, but to draw inference the prosecution has to place\ncertain cogent and considerable material that there is prior\nmeeting of minds to design the said crime as stated above. So far\nas the allegation of conspiracy against A2 the prosecution failed to\nprovide any cogent evidence that there is a conversation between\nA1 and A2. There is no recovery of mobile phones from which\nthey have had conversation and the A2 is involved in the alleged\nconspiracy to commit the murder. It is also not the case of the\nprosecution that A2 use to visit the house of A1 or even he has\nvisited the house of A1 on the date of incident or prior to the date\nof incident. Certainly not necessarily A2 be present in the house of\nA1 prior to the day of incident. But there must be substantial\nmaterial to show that he has participated remotely in the\ncommission of offence. There may be a possibility that A1 after\ncommission of offence would have called A2 to inform, but that\ndoes not amount to criminal conspiracy. As because the criminal\nconspiracy requires the prior meeting mind to design the offence.\nBut here in this case there is no material to show that they have\nmet and planned and executed the said offence. Apart from the\ncall details which are not produced before the court there is no\nmaterial or evidence to infer that A2 involved in the commission of\noffence.\n\n 155. \nIn respect of common intention the Hon'ble Apex court\nin \nGirija Shankar vs State Of U.P\n 2004 (1) Crimes 337 (SC)\nobserved that ;\n\n 116\n\n \nSC No. 1108/2013\n\nSection 34\n has been enacted on the principle of\njoint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The\nSection is only a rule of evidence and does not\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature\nof the Section is the element of participation in\naction. The liability of one person for an offence\ncommitted by another in the course of criminal act\nperpetrated by several persons arises under\n\nSection 34\n if such criminal act is done in\nfurtherance of a common intention of the persons\nwho join in committing the crime. Direct proof of\ncommon intention is seldom available and,\ntherefore, such intention can only be inferred from\nthe circumstances appearing from the proved facts\nof the case and the proved circumstances. In order\nto bring home the charge of common intention, the\nprosecution has to establish by evidence, whether\ndirect or circumstantial, that there was plan or\nmeeting of mind of all the accused persons to\ncommit the offence for which they are charged with\nthe aid of \nSection 34\n, be it pre-arranged or on the\nspur of moment; but it must necessarily be before\nthe commission of the crime. The true concept of\nSection is that if two or more persons intentionally\ndo an act jointly, the position in law is just the same\nas if each of them has done it individually by\nhimself. As observed in \nAshok Kumar v. State of\nPunjab\n (AIR 1977 SC 109), the existence of a\ncommon intention amongst the participants in a\ncrime is the essential element for application of this\nSection. It is not necessary that the acts of the\nseveral persons charged with commission of an\noffence jointly must be the same or identically\nsimilar. The acts may be different in character, but\n\n 117\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n must have been actuated by one and the same\n common intention in order to attract the provision.\n The Section does not say \"the common intention of\n all\", nor does it say \"and intention common to all\".\n Under the provisions of \nSection 34\n the essence of\n the liability is to be found in the existence of a\n common intention animating the accused leading\n to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\n intention. As a result of the application of principles\n enunciated in \nSection 34\n, when an accused is\n convicted under Section 302 read with \nSection 34\n,\n in law it means that the accused is liable for the act\n which cause death of the deceased in the same\n manner as if it was done by him alone. The\n provision is intended to meet a case in which it\n may be difficult to distinguish between acts of\n individual members of a party who act in\n furtherance of the common intention of all or to\n prove exactly what part was taken by each of\n them.\n \nAs was observed in \nCh. Pulla Reddy and\n Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n (AIR 1993 SC\n 1899), \nSection 34\n is applicable even if no injury\n has been cause by the particular accused himself.\n For applying \nSection 34\n it is not necessary to show\n some overt act on the part of the accused.\n\nThe prosecution invoke \nSection 34\n of IPC to establish the common\nintention between A1 and A2. But as per the observation of the\nHon`ble Apex court in above stated case the distinct feature of the\nsection is the element of participation in an action by the accused.\nThe intention plays prominent role. As per the observation of the\nHon`ble Apex Court the said intention can only be inferred from the\ncircumstances appearing from the proved facts of the case and\n\n 118\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nalso the proved circumstances. The prosecution has to establish\nby evidence regarding common intention whether direct or\ncircumstantial that there was a plan or meeting of mind of the\naccused persons to commit the offence. But here in this case on\nhand on appreciation of the evidence placed by the prosecution\nthere is no material to show that there is a prior meeting of mind or\nplanning to execute the crime by A1 and A2. The prosecution has\nnot placed material to show that the A2 has participated in this\npresent crime directly or indirectly. The A1 may be contacted A2\nbut that cannot be inferred as a common intention. Apart from the\nstatement of A1 and A2 there is absolutely no incriminating\nmaterial against A2 regarding common intention. Hence the\nprosecution fails to establish that there is a meeting of mind and\nthere exists a common intention to murder deceased Preethi and\nVeda.\n\n 156. \nIn respect of criminal conspiracy in \nDevender Pal\nSingh vs. State (NCT) of Delhi\n (2002) 2 SCJ 628 the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court by its majority, on criminal conspiracy under\n\nSection 120(A)\n and \n120(B)\n of IPC, said thus;-\n\n \"The essence of a criminal conspiracy is the\n unlawful combination and ordinarily the offence is\n complete when the combination is framed. From\n this, it necessarily follows that unless the statue to\n requires, no overt act need be done in furtherance\n of the conspiracy, and that the object of the\n combination need not be accomplished, in order to\n constitute an indictable offence.\n\n No doubt in the case of conspiracy, there cannot\n be any direct evidence. The ingredients of offence\n\n 119\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nare that there should be an agreement between\nperson who are alleged to conspire and the said\nagreement should be for doing an illegal act or for\ndoing by illegal means an act which itself may not\nbe illegal. Therefore, the essence of criminal\nconspiracy is an agreement to do an illegal act and\nsuch an agreement can be proved either by direct\nevidence or by circumstantial evidence or by both,\nand it is a matter of common experience that direct\nevidence to prove conspiracy is rarely available.\nTherefore, the circumstances proved before,\nduring and after the occurrence have to be\nconsidered to decide about the complicity of the\naccused.\n\n The essential ingredient of the offence of criminal\nconspiracy is the agreement to commit an offence.\nIn a case where the agreement is for\naccomplishment of an act which by itself\nconstitutes an offence, then in that event no overt\nact is necessary to be proved by the prosecution\nbecause in such a situation criminal conspiracy is\nestablished by proving such an agreement. Where\nthe conspiracy alleged is with regard to\ncommission of a serious crime of the nature as\ncontemplated in section 120B read with the proviso\nto sub-section (2) of Section 120B, then in that\nevent mere proof of an agreement between the\naccused for commission of such a crime alone is\nenough to bring about a conviction under Section\n120B and the proof of any overt act by the accused\nor by any one of them would not be necessary. The\nprovisions, in such a situation, do not require that\neach and every person who is a party to the\nconspiracy must do some overt act towards the\nfulfillment of the object of conspiracy, the essential\n\n 120\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n ingredient being an agreement between the\n conspirators to commit the crime and if these\n requirements and ingredients are established, the\n act would fall within the trapping of the provisions\n contained in Section 120B.\"\n\n 157. The prosecution also invoked \nsection 120(B)\n of IPC i.e.\ncriminal conspiracy by A1 and A2 to commit offence. Already the\nevidence in the present case are discussed. On appreciation of the\nevidence the essential ingredients of criminal conspiracy is not\nforthcoming. The ingredients of the offence of criminal conspiracy\nis the agreement to commit an offence. The Hon`ble Apex Court in\nthe above said authority observes that there must be fulfillment of\nessential ingredients that an agreement between the conspirator to\ncommit the crime. If the requirements are established then the act\nfalls within \nsection 120(B)\n . But in the present case on appreciation\nof the evidence there is no material or evidence on record that\nthere exists an agreement between the A1 and A2 as a\nconspirators to the crime. As discussed above the prosecution has\nnot placed record regarding common intention between A1 and A2\nand there is no meeting of mind. Here also there is no facts or\ncircumstances placed which indicates that, there is an agreement\nbetween A1 and A2 to commit crime. As stated above except the\ncall by A1 to A2 there is no substantial material that there is an\nagreement between A1 and A2 to eliminate deceased Preethi. As\nstated above the accused No.1 may called A2 and would have\nstated the commission of crime. But the said fact cannot be\ncovered under \nsec. 120(B)\n criminal conspiracy. By this it can be\ninferred that the prosecution has failed to fulfill the essential\n\n 121\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\ningredients of criminal conspiracy in the present case. Hence this\ncourt holds that the prosecution has failed to prove that A1 and A2\ninvolved in the conspiracy to commit the murder of deceased\nPreethy and Veda and the murder of deceased is an act of criminal\nconspiracy between A-1 and A-2 Accordingly point No.3 is held in\nnegative.\n\n 158. POINT NO.4- Discussions on point No.1 and 2\ndiscloses that the offence u/sec. 302 of \nIPC\n is proved. The act of\nA1 is in a given condition as discussed earlier is per-meditated and\nplanned, that both deceased were brought to such condition that\nthey should not be resist and escape. The assault was brutal and\nwhich cause death of both deceased. A1 having knowledge and\nintention and he know that assault is so immensely dangerous that\nin all probability death will cause and his act causes bodily injury\nas is likely to cause death. It is clear that the act of A1 is manifest\nitself into culpable homicide amounting to murder under \nSection\n300(4)\n of IPC. Therefore the accused No.1 held guilty of the\noffence punishable u/sec. 302 of \nIPC\n.\n\n 159. The prosecution failed to prove the participation of A2\nin the commission of crime through common intention and criminal\nconspiracy. In view of the same accusedd No.2 is not held guilty\nfor the offence u/sec. 302 of \nIPC\n.\n\n 160. The prosecution has failed to establish that there exists\ncommon intention and the accused No.1 and 2 conspired the\ncrime to commit murder of deceased Preethy Acharya and Veda.\nSince the prosecution has failed to establish regarding common\nintention and criminal conspiracy between A1 and A2 through\nevidence. Hence accusedd No.1 and 2 are not found guilty for the\n\n 122\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\noffence u/sec. 109, 120(B) r/w 34 of \nIPC\n. In the result, this court\nproceeds to pass the following:-\n\n ORDER\n\n In exercise of power vested with this Court\n U/\nSec.235(2)\n of Criminal Procedure Code, the\n accused No.1 B.M.Chandrasekhar @ Chandru s/o\n late Manjunath is convicted for the offence punishable\n u/sec. 302 of \nIPC\n.\n\n In exercise of power vested with this Court\n U/\nSec.235 (1)\n of Criminal Procedure Code, the\n accused No.1 B.M.Chandrasekhar @ Chandru s/o\n late Manjunath is acquitted for the offence punishable\n u/sec. 109, 120(B) r/w 34 of \nIPC\n.\n\n In exercise of power vested with this Court\n U/\nSec.235 (1)\n of Criminal Procedure Code, the\n accused No.2 Prabhakar C.K. is acquitted for the\n offence punishable u/sec. 302,109,120(B) r/w 34 of\n \nIPC\n.\n\n Accused No.2 is set at liberty if he is not\n required in any other case.\n\n Having regard to the nature of the offence, it is\n not a fit case to extend the benefit of P.O. Act to\n Accused No.1.\n\n The Mo's are ordered to be preserved till the\n appeal period is over and if the appeal is preferred\n then the disposal of Mos shall follow the orders of the\n Appellate Court.\n\n 123\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n If the appeal is not preferred and after appeal\n period is over all the Mos shall be destroyed as\n worthless.\n\n The Bail bonds and surety bonds furnished\n u/sec. 437A of Cr.P.C. by accused No.2 Prabhakar\n C.K. will be in force for a period of 6 months from the\n date of this order in view of sec. 437A of Cr.PC.\n\n Posted to hear regarding imposition of sentence\n against accused No.1 B.M.Chandrashekar @\n Chandru.\n\n(Dictated to the Judgment writer on computer, corrected, signed\nand then pronounced by me in the open court on this the 23rd day\nof February, 2021.)\n\n (Gururaj Somakkalavar)\n LXIX Addl.C.C. & Sessions Judge,\n Bengaluru.\n\nDt: 24.2.2021\n\n ORDER REGARDING SENTENCE\n\n The accused No.1 and his counsel are heard on the\nquestion of sentence. The accused No.1 submitted his submission\nthat he is aged 62 years and he is an ex serviceman. He further\nsubmits that he was not present on the crime spot on the date of\nincident. Further he also submits that the deceased Preethy\nAcharya filed two false complaints against him on false allegations.\nHe further submits that during the Government service he got\nmarried and he looked after the deceased. From that period there\nare false allegations against him by the deceased Preethy\nAcharya. Further he pleads that he is a musician and also a\n\n 124\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nmusic teacher. Further he submits that, he is also conducting\nmusic classes and teaching music in the central prison during his\nstay in judicial custody as UTP. He further submits that he has\nbeen in the judicial custody since from 8 years. He submits that he\nis innocent and has not committed any offence alleged against\nhim. He submits that a lenient view may please be taken while\nimposing sentence on him.\n\n \nThe counsel for the accused also addressed argument on\nthe sentence. Counsel for the accused No.1 submits that the\npresent case is not one of the rarest of the rare case and\nconsidering the facts and circumstances a lenient view may be\ntaken. Having regard to the facts and circumstances the accused\nis not liable for capital punishment. The counsel for the accused\nNo.1 relied upon 3 authorities. He has relied upon; I. 2006(92)\nDRJ 720 (DB) in case of \nState of Delhi vs. Brij Kishore\n, ii. (2019) 4\nSCC 522 in case of \nDigamber Vaishnav and another vs. State of\nChhattisgarh\n and iii.\n \n(2002) 3 SCC 76 in case of \nLehna vs. State of\nHaryana\n. He has pointing at the citations and the authorities of the\nHon`ble Apex Court and High Court of Delhi. It is pointed out that\nmerely there are large number of wounds on the persons of\ndeceased it could not fall in the rarest of the rare case.\n \nHe further\nrelied upon the observation of the Hon`ble Supreme Court in\n\nLehna\n case. He submits that quoting from the observation of\nHon`ble Apex Court life imprisonment is the rule and death is an\nexception. Death sentence must be imposed only when life\nimprisonment appears to be an altogether in adequate punishment\nhaving regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and\nprovided, and only provided the option to impose sentence of\n\n 125\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nimprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercising having\nregard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the\nrelevant circumstances. Relying on the observation of the Hon`ble\nHigher Courts the counsel for the accused No.1 submits that a\nlenient view may be taken while imposing sentence against\naccused No.1.\n\n Per contra learned P.P. submits that there are two women\nwere murdered by brutally assaulting on them. The said crime\ncomes under rarest of the rare case. It is further submitted by the\nprosecution that the two deceased having three children. The\ndeceased Preethy Acharya had two children and deceased Veda\nhad one child. Their lives are spoiled due to the act of accused\nNo.1. It is submitted that there are virtually three deaths on the\ndeath of two women. It is further argued that life imprisonment is\nthe lesser punishment to the crime committed by accused No.1.\nThat accused No.1 deserves to be imposed with capital\npunishment for the offence u/sec. 302 of \nIPC\n.\n\n Heard both sides on the sentence. The accused is in judicial\ncustody. He is in jail for about 7 yers and 317 days from the date of\nhis arrest. Though accused No.1 claims to be innocent. Having\ndiscussed the evidence on record thoroughly this court is of the\nview that accused No.1 is guilty of the offence u/sec. 302 of \nIPC\n.\nNow having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case this\nis not the rarest of the rare case so that death sentence can be\nimposed on the accused No.1.\n\n However considering the facts and circumstances of the\ncase the offence involves murder of two woman having minor\nchildren, they were murdered by gruesomely assaulting on their\n\n 126\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nhead and left them to die. The offence is very heinous in nature.\nBy the act of accused No.1 two lives have been taken out this is\nthe case of double murder. Considering the facts and\ncircumstances of the case the accused No.1 shall undergo life\nimprisonment. Life means his remaining life. However the crime\ndoes not comes under the purview of rarest of the rare case. The\nHon`ble Apex Court as relied by the counsel for accused No.1 has\nobserved that life imprisonment is a rule and death sentence is an\nexception. As stated above it is not a rarest of the rare case\nwarranting capital punishment. According to the sentencing\nscheme found in \nsection 302\n of IPC if death sentence cannot be\nawarded the accused should be sentenced with imprisonment for\nlife and fine. Keeping in mind the interest of the State as well of the\naccused No.1 this court is of the opinion that the ends of the\njustice will be served if the accused No.1 is imposed rigorous\nimprisonment for life and fine of Rs. 25,000/- for the offence u/sec.\n302 of \nIPC\n and in default of payment of fine, he has to further\nundergo simple imprisonment for one year.\n\n The case filled with affliction and agony. As because here,\nin this case a aged mother lost her daughter. Two children of\ndeceased Preethy Acharya lost their mother. Another child of\ndeceased Veda lost her mother. The children are minors who\nhave lost their mother, her love and affection, the care and\nconcern. The mother of Pretthy Acharya has lost her daughter, her\ncare. All these a sorrowful states cannot be filled by any means.\nDefinitely not by the monetary support. No amount will be\nsufficient for compensating their pain and agony, the loss they\nhave gone through. However a compensation has to be awarded\n\n 127\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\nto them to give a little support in their upcoming life. \nSection 357(3)\n\nof Cr.P.C. provides for awarding compensation. Hence this court is\nof the opinion that the apart from the fine imposed on the accused\nNo.1, under the facts and circumstances of the case an amount of\nRs. 1,00,000/- is to be awarded as compensation under \nSec. 357\n(3)\n of Cr.P.C. The compensation amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- shall\nbe paid towards the compensation to the mother of Preethy\nAcharya i.e. Geetha Acharya and two children of Preethy Acharya\nPurvi and Pallavi and among the said compensation an amount\nalso to be paid to the child of Veda.\n\n Further I am of the opinion that the compensation awarded\nunder \nSec. 357\n of Cr.P.C. to the victims may not be adequate,\nhence recommendation needs to be made to DLSA, Bengaluru for\nconsideration of award of compensation to the victim herein under\nthe Victim Compensation Scheme as provided under \nSec. 7\n of the\nVictim Compensation Scheme, 2011. Accordingly office is directed\nto send a copy of this judgment to the Hon`ble President of DLSA,\nBengaluru for consideration of award to the victims herein, under\nthe Victim Compensation Scheme, 2011 alongwith a covering\nletter in this regard. Therefore I proceed to pass the following;\n\n ORDER\n\n Acting under \nSection 235(2)\n of Cr.P.C. the accused\n No.1 B.M.Chandrasekhar @ Chandru is sentenced to\n undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and pay fine of Rs.\n 25,000/-. In default of payment of fine he shall under go\n further simple imprisonment for one year, for the offence\n u/sec. 302 of \nIPC\n.\n\n Acting u/ Section 357(3) Cr.P.C it is ordered that the\n\n 128\n\n SC No. 1108/2013\n\n accused No.1 shall pay compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- to\n the victims i.e. the mother of deceased Preethy Acharya\n and two children of Preethy Acharya and child of deceased\n Veda, towards compensation, if this amount remained\n unpaid it shall be recovered from the accused No.1 or from\n his property according to Section 431 of Cr.P.C.\n\n Office is directed to furnish free copy of the judgment\n to the accused forthwith.\n\n Send conviction warrant accordingly.\n\n Office is directed to send a copy of this judgment to\n the Hon`ble President of DLSA, Bengaluru for consideration\n of award to the victims herein, under the Victim\n Compensation Scheme, 2011 alongwith a covering letter\n in this regard.\n\n(Dictated to the Judgment writer on computer, corrected, signed\nand then pronounced by me in the open court on this the 24 th\nday of February, 2021.)\n\n (Gururaj Somakallavar)\n LXIX Addl.C.C. & Sessions Judge,\n Bengaluru.\n\n ANNEXURE\n\n LIST OF WITNESSES EXAMINED FOR PROSECUTION:\n\n PW 1 Geetha Purushotham Acharya\n PW 2 Manjunath B.V.\n PW 3 Dherendra\n PW 4 Shri Latha\n PW 5 H.S.

Further\nit is argued that as per the PM report there is struggle injuries on\nthe dead body of Veda,but to substantiate same no examination is\nconducted on accused to prove the fact that there was struggle\nbetween A1 and deceased Veda. Even the nails of deceased were\nnot examined. No particulars were collected regarding Ex.P. 53.\nFurther it is argued that as per the prosecution case the deceased\ndrunk beer which was brought byA1. As per PM report the\ncontents of beer not found in the body and also no other poison\nwere detected. But it is the case of the prosecution that the beer\ntins were empty. Further accused also secured subsequently on\nthe next day. Even there is no evidence to show that accused were\ndetected with alcohol content in his body. If this fact is considered,\nthe prosecution case in this regard is not believable. Further it is\nalso argued that as per the FSL report the blood is that of human\nand it belongs to `A` group. However it is not forthcoming from the\nFSL report that deceased blood was identified and same is tallied\nwith the blood found on MO. 15. Even the said FSL report is not\nhelpful for the prosecution to establish the fact that MO. 15 was\nuse to assault deceased. Further it is argued that PW. 26 has not\nexamined the surface of the alleged iron rod to establish the\nconnection between the injuries and the weapon use. The said PM\nreport is not according to medical manual. Hence the\nprosecution also fails in order to establish the medical evidence.\nFurther it is also argued that the inquest is also not properly\nconducted. Inquest has to be held in the house itself not in the\nhospital, but in this case the inquest was conducted at KIMS\nhospital. Further it is also argued that in Ex.P. 41 and 42 the"

But here it is relevant to observe that, said fact of entering\ninto house through back door by Preethy and Veda does not have\nsignificance in the case, as because it is not in dispute that they\nentered into house and they were in the house on the day of\nincident. Further their bodies were found inside the house. Hence\nthe said fact of entering into the house though back door has no\nbaring on the case."

Another very strong theory of defense is that, which is\nput up during cross-examination of PW.1 and in the written\nsubmission submitted by A1 after recording statement u/sec. 313\nof \nCr.PC\n . That, PW. 1 mother of Preethy Acharya was present in\nthe house on day of incident. She has assaulted Preethy Acharya\nand Veda and she has murdered them. The reason for the same\nexplained by A1 in his written submission. He states that CW. 4\nPurushotham was forcing the deceased Preethy Acharya to allow\nVeda to reside in the house of A1. This fact is seriously objected by\nPW. 1. For the reason that the deceased Veda would further\nreveal matter of PW.1`s personal matter to A1. But Preethy\nAcharya kept Veda with her in the residence of A1, against the\nwish of PW.1. This made PW. 1 angry and she use to quarrel with\ndeceased threatening that she would kill both Preethy Acharya and\nVeda. PW. 1 warned A1 to not allow Veda to stay in his residence.\nWhen he told same to Preethy, she did not listen to his words."
