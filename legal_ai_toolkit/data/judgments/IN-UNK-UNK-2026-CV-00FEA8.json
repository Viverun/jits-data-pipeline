Bhattacharyya\n\nFor the Respondent bank : Mr. Sakti Nath Mukherjee\n Mr. L. K. Gupta\n Mr. Saptangshu Basu\n\nFor the Respondent Nos.5 to 16 : Mr. Swapan Kumar Dutta\n Mr. Dipankar Das Gupta\n Mr. Anirban Pramanick\n\nHeard On: 24.04.2008 & 05.05.2008.\n\nJudgment On: 16.05.2008.\n PRANAB KUMAR CHATTOPADHYAY, J.\n\n The scale-I officers (JMG) of the respondent bank filed a\n\nwrit petition before this Court challenging the promotion process\n\nin respect of promotion to Scale-II. The aforesaid promotion is\n\ngoverned by the Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion of\n\nOfficers and other Employees) Rules, 1998 framed under the\n\nRegional Rural Banks Act, 1976\n.\n\n The real grievances of the writ petitioners is that the\n\nselection for promotion has been virtually made on the basis of\n\nmerit-cum-seniority in violation of the specific rule prescribed\n\nfor the promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. The\n\naforesaid contentions made on behalf of the writ petitioners did\n\nnot find favour with the learned Single Judge of the trial court\n\nand the writ petition was dismissed by the said learned Single\n\nJudge by the judgment and order under appeal.\n\n The instant appeal has been preferred at the instance of the\n\nsaid writ petitioners assailing the judgment and order under\n\nappeal whereby and whereunder the writ petition filed by the\n\nappellants herein was dismissed on merits.\n\n For the purpose of adjudication of the issues raised in this\n\nappeal, relevant provisions of the Regional Rural Banks\n\n(Appointment and Promotion of Officers and other Employees) Rules,\n\n1998 are required to be taken into consideration. The basis of\n\npromotion to the post of Scale-II officer and the mode of\n\nselection have been provided in Clause 2 of Third Schedule of the\n\naforesaid Promotion Rules of 1998. Clause 2(d) of the aforesaid\n\nThird Schedule to the Promotion Rules, 1998 speaks of promotion to\n\nthe post of Scale-II officer on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nThe mode of selection, however, has been prescribed in Clause 2(f)\n\nof the said Third Schedule. The composition of committee for\n\nconsidering the Commission has been mentioned in Clause 2(g). The\n\nselection process for promotion has been mentioned in Clause 2(j)\n\nof Third Schedule.\n\n For proper appreciation, aforesaid Clauses of Third Schedule\n\nare set out hereunder:\n\n \" 2 (d) Whether promotion to be: Promotion shall be made on\n made on seniority basis or the basis of\nseniority-cum-seniority-cum-basis. merit.\n\n (f) Mode of Selection: The selection of the candidate\nshall be made by the committee on the basis\nof written test, interview and assessment of Performance\nAppraisal Reports for the preceding five years as an\nofficer in scale-I/Field Supervisor.\n\n (g) Composition of Committee: The committee (for\nconsider-ing promotion) shall consistof the following persons,\n\nnamely -\n\n i) The Chairman of the concerned Regional Rural\n Bank-Chairman\n\n ii) A director nominated by the Sponsor Bank-Member\n\n iii) A director nominated by the National Bank-Member\n\n Note : If none of the members of the Committee\n belongs to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, the\n Board may nominate a person belonging to Schedules\n Caste/Schedules Tribes as an additional member and\n such person shall participate in the process of\n selection by the concerned Committee.\n\n (j) Selection Process for Promotion : The selection\n shall be on the basis of Performance in the\n written test, interview and\n Performance Appraisal Reports\n for preceding five years as\n per the division of marks given\n below :\n A) Written Test : 60 marks\n B) Interview : 20 marks\n\n C) Performance Appraisal Reports : 20 marks\n\n Total Marks : 100 marks\n\n A) Written test: The candidates shall be require to\n ( 60 marks) appear for written test comprising\n of two parts viz. Part (A)covering\n Banking Law and Practice of\n Banking and Part(B)covering Credit\n Policy, Credit Management including\n Priority Sector, Economics and\n Management.\n\n 60 marks allotted to written test\n shall be further divided as under:\n\n Part 'A'\n 30 marks\n Part 'B'\n 30 marks\n A list of only those candidates,\n who secure a minimum of 40% marks\n in each part shall be prepared and\n such candidates shall be called for\n interview.\n\n B) Interview (20 marks): There shall be no minimum\nqualify-ing marks for the interview.\n\n C) Performance appraisal: Performance Appraisal\nReports for Reports (20 marks)the preceding five years shall be\nconsidered for the purpose of\nawarding marks for promotion.\"\n\n Thirteen vacancies for Scale-II officers were notified by the\n\nbank and in terms of Clause 2(i) of the Third Schedule, 52\n\ncandidates were identified to fall in the zone of consideration.\n\nOut of the aforesaid 52 candidates, 26 including the appellants\n\nherein qualified in the written test. Thereafter, all the\n\naforesaid 26 candidates including the appellants herein who\n\nqualified in the written test were asked to appear at the\n\ninterview. In the said interview following factors were taken into\n\nconsideration in respect of each one of the candidates:\n\n i) Marks secured in the written test\n\n ii) Marks secured in the performance appraisal\n\n iii) Marks secured in the interview\n\n The management of the bank published the result of the\n\naforesaid 26 candidates who have qualified in the written test\n\nafter taking into account the marks of the written test of the\n\nrespective candidates once again along with the marks obtained in\n\nviva-voce test and performance appraisal. Unfortunately, although\n\nthe appellant No. 1 is senior to all the private respondents,\n except the private respondent No. 4 and the appellant Nos. 2 and 3\n\nare senior to private respondent Nos. 8 to 16, they have been\n\ndeclared as failed. According to the appellants, there is no scope\n\nto declare any candidate passed or failed since no Benchmark was\n\nprescribed in the Promotion Rules of 1998 for interview and\n\nperformance appraisal. The learned Counsel of the appellants\n\nfurther submits that the management of the bank by superseding the\n\nappellants herein have given promotion to the private respondents\n\nwithout following the principle of seniority-cum-merit. It has\n\nbeen specifically urged on behalf of the appellants herein that\n\nthe comparative assessment of merits of the candidates is not at\n\nall permissible while selection for promotion is made following\n\nthe policy of seniority-cum-merit.\n\n Mr. Saktinath Mukherjee, learned Senior Counsel representing\n\nthe respondent bank submits that the authorities of the bank are\n\nunder the obligation and duty bound to follow the rules in its\n\ntotality and any particular rule has to be construed in the\n\ncontext of the entire rule. The learned Senior Counsel of the\n\nrespondent bank, however, admits that there may be an apparent\n\ninconsistency between Clause 2(d) on the one hand and Clauses 2(f)\n\nand (j) on the other hand. Undisputedly, Clause 2(d) provides\n\nseniority-cum-merit formula and Clauses 2(f) and (j) provide for\n\nassessment of merits of the candidates. The learned Senior Counsel\n of the respondent bank further submits that the rule of\n\nconstruction in case of an apparent inconsistency is that a head-\n\non collision of the different Rules should be avoided and an\n\nendeavour should be made for harmonious construction of the\n\nstatutory rules in order to resolve the inconsistency in respect\n\nof the statutory rules.\n\n It has also been argued on behalf of the respondent bank that\n\nthere is no challenge to the procedure prescribed in the Rules. We\n\nare, however, not very much impressed by the aforesaid argument as\n\nthe appellants/writ petitioners have specifically challenged the\n\nselection procedure on the ground that the same is contrary to\n\nClause 2(d) of the Third Schedule which provides for selection on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\n The principal question to be decided in this appeal is,\n\nwhether the respondent bank while following the prescribed\n\nprocedure for selecting candidates for promotion to the post of\n\nScale-II officer really followed the principle of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit as specifically provided in the promotion rules.\n\n The learned Senior Counsel representing the appellants\n\nsubmits that the Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion\n\nof Officers and other Employees) Rules, 1998 made it clear that\n the promotion to the posts of Scale-II officers should be made on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit but the selection process for\n\nsuch promotion as provided by the said Rules of 1998 is not in\n\nconsonance with the aforesaid policy. The aforesaid inconsistency\n\nhas also been admitted by the learned Senior Counsel representing\n\nthe respondent bank.\n\n Therefore, it is to be decided whether the bank should follow\n\nthe selection process for promotion as provided in the Rules of\n\n1998 even though such selection is in violation and/or\n\ninconsistent with the promotion policy based on seniority-cum-\n\nmerit.\n\n The learned Single Judge following the earlier judgment\n\ndelivered by another Hon'ble Single Judge of this Court in W.P.\n\nNo. 8066 (W) of 1999 (Pradip Kumar Sarkar vs. Murshidabad Gramin\n\nBank and Ors.) held as hereunder:\n\n \"16. Before going to the next point, it is relevant to\n take note that the 1998 Rules, in effect, postulates\n that promotion to be given thereunder is actually based\n on merit-cum-seniority and not seniority-cum-merit. This\n view has found support in a judgment delivered by\n another Hon'ble Judge of this Court in W.P. 8066(W) of\n 1999 (Pradip Kumar Sarkar and Ors. Vs. Murshidabad\n Gramin Bank and Ors. by judgment delivered on 2.4.01).\n In the said judgment, it has been held that although\n under Rule 2(d) it has been stipulated that promotion is\n to be given on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, but in\n effect, it is merit-cum-seniority. The learned Single\nJudge has also held that Clause 2(d) has to be read as\nmerit-cum-seniority within the definition of the said\nphraseology. The relevant paragraphs of the said\njudgment are to be found at Pages 6 and 9 to 11 thereof\nand, they are accordingly reproduced hereunder as\nfollows:\n\n Page-6 (top)\n ' With regard to the second ground Mr. Sanyal\n has submitted that the relevant Standing Order\n being Standing Order No. 642 E dated July 29,\n 1998, if read as a whole, clearly postulates\n that the promotion shall be made on merit cum\n seniority basis and not as seniority cum merit\n as wrongly stipulated in 2(b) thereof.\n According to Mr. Sanyal, Clause 2 of the third\n schedule of the said Standing Order, if read\n as a whole, would logically suggest such\n meaning.\n\n Mr. Sanyal in support of his contention\n has cited two Supreme Court decisions reported\n in 98 Vol. III Supreme Court Cases, Page 694\n and AIR 1986, Supreme Court, Page 1043.'\n\n Page 9-11\n ' Rule 2 of the third schedule of the Standing\n Order is relevant for consideration in the\n instant case. Sub-Clause (b) denotes the\n promotion would be made on seniority cum\n merit. The eligibility clauses being clause\n\n (e), (b) and (i) give the criterion to bring\n the candidates within the zone of\n consideration.\n\n Clause (f) prescribes the mode of\n selection i.e. by holding written test,\n interview and performance assessment. Clause\n\n (g) deals with the composition of the\n selection committee.\n\n Clause (j) stipulates that the selection\n shall be on the basis of performance in the\n written tests, interview and performance\n appraisal require for proceeding five years.\n Sub-Clause A stipulates that a candidate to\n become eligible to be called on in interview\n must obtain 40% marks in both the groups\n whereas sub-clause B denotes that there is no\n minimum qualifying marks in the interview.\n Whereas sub-clause C the last five years\n records are to be considered for awarding\n marks. There are total 100 marks in the\n selection process out of which written tests\n denotes 60 marks, interview and performance\n records 20 marks each.\n\n It is significant that there is no\n minimum marks prescribed for being considered\n for ultimate selection. If I have to accept\n the contention of Mr. Mukherjee that the\n promotion in the instant case is in accordance\n with seniority cum merit then I have to find\n out from the standing order the minimum marks\n to make the senior most eligible for the\n promotional post. In absence of such marking\n it is very difficult to ask the authority to\n act on the basis of the Standing Order by\n giving promotion to the senior cadre on the\n basis of minimum eligible qualification when\n there is no minimum eligible qualification\n fixed for the said post. The rule of\n interpretation does not permit me to add or\n delete any word. I have to give harmonious\n construction of the said Standing Order as far\n as practicable. Hence, reading clause 2 of the\n third schedule of the said Standing Order and\n taking a sum total of the relevant sub-clauses\n and the meaning thereof it appears to me that\n although the said promotion has been\n stipulated to be made on the basis of\n seniority cum merit it is in effect merit cum\n seniority. I, therefore, find substance in Mr.\n Sanyal's argument. I hold that clause 2(d) has\n to be read as merit cum seniority in\n accordance with the definition of the said\n phrase as held by the Apex Court in various\n judgments including the judgment reported in\n AIR 1998 Supreme Court, page 2565. Hence I do\n not find any irregularity in the selection\n process.\"\n\n [SIC but underlining by this Court]\n\n The learned Single Judge following the said judgment in the\n\ncase of Pradip Kumar Sarkar & Ors. (Supra) came to an erroneous\n finding that the 1998 Rules although provides that promotion is to\n\nbe given on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, in effect, it is on\n\nthe basis of merit-cum-seniority. The aforesaid finding of the\n\nlearned Single Judge is virtually contrary to the prescribed rules\n\nwhich are applicable in the matter of granting promotion. The\n\nlearned Single Judge, in our opinion, was clearly misled by the\n\nprovisions mentioned in the Rules with regard to the mode of\n\nselection. The prescribed procedures for mode of selection can\n\nunder no circumstances change the basis of promotion which has\n\nbeen clearly mentioned in the said Rules i.e. seniority-cum-merit.\n\nIn the present case, undisputedly, the respondent bank selected\n\nthe candidates and granted promotion actually on the basis of\n\nmerit-cum-seniority and not seniority-cum-merit which has been\n\nerroneously approved by the learned Single Judge in the judgment\n\nunder appeal.\n\n We respectfully disagree with the aforesaid findings of the\n\nlearned Single Judge. Clause 2(d) of the Third Schedule of the\n\n1998 Rules specifically provides that promotion should be made on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit and there is no ambiguity in this\n\nregard. When the 1998 Rules clearly provide that promotion should\n\nbe made on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, the learned Single\n\nJudge had no scope to take a contrary view since it is well-\n\nsettled that the Court cannot rewrite the Rules.\n\n The learned Single Judge also erroneously held as hereunder:\n\n \"12. Merely because at Rule 2(d), the authors of the\n Rule have stated that promotion shall be on the basis of\n seniority-cum-merit, the same, by itself, cannot mean\n that under the 1998 Rules, seniority has to be given\n weightage in supersession of merit.\"\n\n In our opinion, the learned Single Judge did not lay down the\n\ncorrect law. In the event, promotion is to be given on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit then seniority has to be given weightage in\n\nsupersession of merit.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nB. V. Sivaiah and\n\nOthers vs. K. Addanki Babu and Others\n reported in (1998) 6 SCC 720\n\nspecifically held:\n\n \"18. We thus arrive at the conclusion\n that the criterion of 'seniority-cum-\n\n merit' in the matter of promotion\n postulates that given the minimum\n\n necessary merit requisite for efficiency\n of administration, the senior, even\n though less meritorious, shall have\n priority and a comparative assessment of\n merit is not required to be made. For\n assessing the minimum necessary merit,\n the competent authority can lay down the\n minimum standard that is required and\n also prescribe the mode of assessment of\n merit of the employee who is eligible for\n consideration for promotion. Such\n assessment can be made by assigning marks\n on the basis of appraisal of performance\n on the basis of service record and\n interview and prescribing the minimum\n marks which would entitle a person to be\n promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-\n merit.\"\n\n \nReferring to the earlier decision of the Supreme Court,\n\nArijit Pasayat, J. in the case of \nBhagwandas Tiwari & Ors. vs.\n\nDewas Shajapur Kshetriya Gramin Bank & Ors.\n reported in AIR 2007\n\nSC 994 explained the principles of seniority-cum-merit and merit-\n\ncum-seniority as hereunder:\n\n \"10. The principle of 'merit-cum-\n seniority' lays greater emphasis on merit\n and ability and seniority plays a less\n significant role. Seniority is to be\n given weight only when merit and ability\n are approximately equal. In the context\n of Rule 5(2) of the Indian Administrative\n Service/Indian Police Service\n (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations,\n 1955 which prescribed that \"selection for\n inclusion in such list shall be based on\n (AIR 1974 SC merit and suitability in all respects\n\n 87) with due regard to seniority\" Mathew, J.\n\n \nin \nUnion of India v. Mohan Lal Capoor and\n Ors.\n, 1973 (2) SCC 836, has said:-\n\n ' For inclusion in the list, merit\n and suitability in all respects\n should be the governing\n consideration and that seniority\n should play a secondary role. It is\n only when merit and suitability are\n roughly equal that seniority will be\n a determining factor, or if it is\n not fairly possible to make an\n assessment inter se of the merit and\n suitability of two eligible\n candidates and come to a firm\n conclusion, seniority would tilt the\n scale.'\n\n(AIR 1974 SC 87) Similarly, Beg, J. (as the learned Chief\n Para 22 Justice then was) has said (SCC p. 851,\n Para 22) :\n\n '22. Thus, we think that the correct\n view, in conformity with the plain\n meaning of words used in the relevant\n rules, is that the 'entrance' or\n 'inclusion' test, for a place on the\n select list, is competitive and\n comparative applied to all eligible\n candidates and not minimal like pass\n marks at an examination. The Selection\n Committee has an unrestricted choice of\n the best available talent, from amongst\n eligible candidates, determined by\n reference a reasonable criteria applied\n in assessing the facts revealed by\n service records of all eligible\n candidates so that merit and not here\n seniority is the governing factor.'\n\n 11. On the other hand, as between the\n principles of seniority and merit, the\n criterion of 'seniority-cum-merit' lays\n greater emphasis on seniority. In State\n(AIR 1968 SC of Mysore and Anr. V. Syed Mahmood and\n1113)\n Ors., 1968 (3) SCR 363, while considering\n Rule 4(3)(b) of the Mysore State Civil\n Services General Recruitment Rules, 1957\n which required promotion to be made by\n selection on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\n merit, this Court has observed that the\n rule required promotion to be made by\n selection on the basis of 'seniority\n subject to the fitness of candidate to\n discharge the duties of post from among\n persons eligible for promotion.' It was\n pointed out that where promotion is based\n on seniority-cum-merit, the officer\n cannot claim promotion as a matter of\n right by virtue of his seniority alone\n and if he is found unfit to discharge the\n duties of the higher post, he may be\n passed over and an officer junior to him\n may be promoted.\n\n 12. \nIn \nState of Kerala and Anr. V. N. M.\n\n (AIR 1976 SC 490) Thomas and Ors., 1976 (2) SCC 310, A.N.\n Para 38 Ray, C.J. has thus explained the\n criterion of 'seniority-cum-merit' (SCC\n p. 335, Para 38):-\n\n 'With regard to promotion the normal\n principles are either merit-cum-\n\n seniority or seniority-cum-merit.\n Seniority-cum-merit means that given\n the minimum necessary merit\n requisite for efficiency of\n administration, the senior though\n the less meritorious shall have\n priority.\"\n\n As observed earlier, the bank in the present case, granted\n\npromotion in violation of the promotion policy based on seniority-\n\ncum-merit. Going through the records we find that the authorities\n\nof the respondent bank while selecting the candidates for\n\npromotion considered the marks secured by the individual\n\ncandidates in the interview and performance appraisal reports\n\napart from the written test and thus, in effect, followed the\n\nprocedure for granting promotion on the basis of merit-cum-\n\nseniority as specifically recorded by the learned Single Judge in\n\nthe judgment under appeal. The marks secured in the interview as\n\nwell as the performance appraisal report and in the written test\n\ncannot have any effect in the matter of granting promotion on the\n\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit. However, in order to ensure minimum\n\nstandard of merit, provision for securing minimum 40% marks in\n each part in the written test cannot be declared unreasonable\n\nalthough ultimate selection cannot be based on the basis of marks\n\nsecured by the candidates seeking promotion to the higher post.\n\n \nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nHargovind Yadav vs.\n\nRewa Sidhi Gramin Bank and Ors.\n reported in (2006) 6 SCC 145\n\nconsidered the aforesaid issue as hereunder:\n\n \n\"22. Interviews can be held and assessment of\n performance can be made by the Bank in\n connection with promotions. But that can be\n only to assess the minimum necessary merit.\n But where the procedure adopted does not\n provide the minimum standard for promotion,\n but only the minimum standard for interview\n and does the selection with reference to\n comparative marks, it is contrary to the\n rule of 'seniority-cum-merit'. This aspect\n of the matter has been completely lost sight\n of by the learned Single Judge and the\n Division Bench of the High Court in this\n round of litigation. As noticed above, they\n have proceeded on the basis that the\n appellant having failed to secure the\n minimum marks prescribed for interview, was\n rightly denied promotion, by ignoring the\n principle \nlaid down by\n this Court in Sivaiah\n in regard to seniority-cum-merit. At all\n events, as the promotion policy adopted by\n the Bank was held to be illegal in the\n earlier round of litigation (WP No. 4485 of\n 1993 dated 13-10-1988), the Bank could not\n have adopted the same policy to again reject\n the appellant for promotion.\n \nWe may also\n note that the law \nlaid down in\n Sivaiah was\n reiterated in \nSher Singh v. Surinder Kumar\n\n wherein this Court had occasion to consider\n a similar question relating to the promotion\n for the post of clerk to Field Supervisor in\n the case of another Gramin Bank. This Court\n held that as the criterion for making\n promotion from the post of clerk to that of\n Field Supervisor was seniority-cum-merit but\n the Bank did not follow the criterion of\n seniority-cum-merit but made promotions on\n the basis of merit-cum-seniority, the\n promotion was vitiated and therefore\n invalid.\"\n\n \nThe learned Single Judge approved the stand of the respondent\n\nbank in the matter of granting promotion even after recording that\n\nthe selection for such promotion was made on the basis of merit-\n\ncum-seniority and not seniority-cum-merit as clearly mentioned in\n\nthe Rules and thus, virtually the learned Single Judge made an\n\nattempt to re-legislate the statute and/or rewrite the Rules as\n\nargued by Mr. K. Bandyopadhyay, learned Senior Counsel\n\nrepresenting the appellants. Mr. Bandyopadhyay also referred to\n\nand relied on a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of \nJinia\n\nKeotin and Others vs. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi and others\n reported in\n\n(2003) 1 SCC 730 (Paragraph 5).\n\n There is no doubt that the Court has no power either to re-\n\nlegislate the statute and/or rewrite the Rules. Therefore, the\n\nlearned Single Judge even after coming to the specific finding\n\nthat the rule for granting promotion on the basis of seniority-\n\ncum-merit has not been followed approved the action of the\n respondent bank with regard to selection of the candidates for\n\ngranting promotion to the higher post.\n\n The learned Senior Counsel of the appellants raised another\n\nissue relating to the conducting of the written test by a private\n\nagency without constituting a Committee in compliance with the\n\nRules. In our opinion, the Rules should be followed at every stage\n\nand there is no scope to avoid the mandate of the Rules.\n\n \nIt has also been submitted on behalf of the respondent bank\n\nthat the 1998 Rules contained several provisions materially\n\ndifferent than those in the 1988 Rules. According to the learned\n\nSenior Counsel of the respondent bank, all the decided and\n\nreported cases on promotion in Regional Rural Banks/Gramin Banks\n\nincluding \nB. V. Sivaiah & Ors.\n (Supra) and \nHargovind Yadav\n (Supra)\n\nhave considered the Recruitment Rules of 1988 and not the\n\nRecruitment Rules of 1998. Since the Recruitment Rules of 1988 as\n\nwell as the Recruitment Rules of 1998 specifically provide that\n\nthe selection for promotion should be made strictly on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit, the principles of law \nlaid down in\n the\n\naforesaid decisions cited on behalf of the appellants are very\n\nmuch applicable in the facts of the present case.\n\n The learned Senior Counsel representing the\n\nrespondent bank submits that there is an apparent inconsistency\n\nbetween Clause 2(d) of the Third Schedule on one hand and Clauses\n\n2(f) & (j) on the other hand. Thus, the said learned Senior\n\nCounsel of the respondent bank virtually admits that the mode of\n\nselection for promotion mentioned in the Rules is inconsistent\n\nwith the principle for granting promotion in terms of the\n\naforesaid Rules on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. The learned\n\nSenior Counsel of the respondent bank further submits that the\n\nCourt should make an endeavour for harmonious construction of the\n\naforesaid Rules in order to resolve the apparent inconsistency.\n\nIt is true that if the harmonious construction is possible and\n\npermissible then the same should be accepted otherwise the\n\nprinciple prescribed in the Rules for promotion based on\n\nseniority-cum-merit cannot be given a go-bye even for the purpose\n\nof following the selection process as provided in the said Rules\n\nof 1998. The selection process prescribed in the rules should be\n\nfollowed in order to achieve the policy of promotion based on\n\nseniority-cum-merit as specifically mentioned in the said Rules of\n\n1998. The policy for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\n\ncannot be diluted at any stage and if necessary suitable amendment\n\nof the selection process should be made. Undisputedly, the\n\nselection process for promotion should be prescribed in such a\n manner so that the policy for promotion based on seniority-cum-\n\nmerit can be followed and implemented.\n\n The provisions mentioned in the Recruitment Rules of\n\n1998 with regard to the mode of selection and the selection\n\nprocess for promotion cannot have any overriding effect on the\n\nprinciple prescribed for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit as specifically mentioned in Clause 2(d) of the Third\n\nSchedule of the Recruitment rules, since the procedure cannot\n\nprevail upon principle or supersede the principle under any\n\ncircumstances. The principle prescribed in the Rules for promotion\n\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit should be strictly followed\n\nand implemented at every stage and in doing so, if any\n\ninconsistency is detected with any other rule prescribing the\n\nprocedure relating to mode of selection and selection process for\n\npromotion then such inconsistency should be avoided in such a\n\nmanner so that the principle prescribed for promotion on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit is not at all defeated.\n\n With regard to mode of selection and selection process for\n\npromotion, minimum standard prescribed for written test upon\n\nimposing condition on the candidates for securing a minimum of 40%\n\nmarks in each part of the written test should be followed and in\n\ndoing so there would be no inconsistency with the principle\n prescribed for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in\n\nClause 2(d) of the Third Schedule. Regarding interview and\n\nperformance appraisal reports, no minimum qualifying marks have\n\nbeen prescribed. Therefore, the concerned authority should\n\nconsider the performance of the candidate concerned at the\n\ninterview and performance appraisal reports for the preceding five\n\nyears in order to assess the suitability of the candidates to the\n\npromotional posts. This Court cannot rewrite the Rules but in\n\norder to give a harmonious construction of the Rules, the marks\n\nawarded in the interview and the performance appraisal reports\n\nshould be considered only for assessing the suitability of the\n\ncandidates and not to adjudge comparative merits of the candidates\n\nupon giving a go-bye to the principle of promotion on the basis of\n\nseniority-cum-merit.\n\n The learned Counsel representing the private\n\nrespondents also adopted the arguments advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent bank.\n\n In the instant case, the appellants have\n\nsuccessfully passed the written test conducted under the Rules\n\nupon securing more than 40% marks. Therefore, for the purpose of\n\ngranting promotion to the post of Scale-II officers, seniority\n\nshould be the governing factor. None of the appellants has been\n found unfit to discharge the duties of the higher post on the\n\nbasis of the interview or performance appraisal reports.\n\n Therefore, the claims of the appellants for\n\npromotion to the posts of Scale-II officers should be reconsidered\n\nby the competent authority of the respondent bank strictly on the\n\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit under the said 1998 Rules.\n\n For the reasons discussed hereinbefore and\n\nspecifically for non-complying with the provisions mentioned in\n\nClause 2(d) of the Third Schedule of 1998 Rules, in the matter of\n\ngranting promotion to the post of Scale-II officer strictly on the\n\nbasis of 'seniority-cum-merit', the impugned order of promotion\n\nissued earlier by the Chairman, Nadia Gramin Bank on 25th August,\n\n2005 cannot be sustained in the eye of law and the same is,\n\ntherefore, quashed.\n\n The authorities of the respondent bank are directed\n\nto undertake selection process de novo for promotion to the post\n\nof Scale-II officers from Scale-I officers following the principle\n\nof seniority-cum-merit as clearly mentioned in the 1998 Rules and\n\nexplained hereinbefore.\n\n Since a considerable time has already been elapsed,\n\nthe authorities of the respondent bank are directed to complete\n\nthe selection process de novo in the manner directed hereinabove\n\nat an early date but positively within a period of eight weeks\n\nfrom date.\n\n With the aforesaid observations and directions, we\n\nallow the appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by\n\nthe learned Single Judge.\n\n In the facts and circumstances of the present case, there\n\nwill be no order as to costs.\n\n Let urgent Xerox certified copy of this judgment, if applied\nfor, be given to the learned Advocates of the parties on\ncompletion of usual undertaking.\n\n [PRANAB KUMAR CHATTOPADHYAY, J.]\n\nTAPAN MUKHERJEE, J.\n\n I agree\n\n [TAPAN MUKHERJEE, J.]\n LATER :\n\n After pronouncement of the judgment, the learned\n\nCounsel of the respondent-bank as well as the private respondents\n\nprays for stay of the operation of \nthe said judgment\n and order. We\n\nfind no reason to grant such stay.\n\n Accordingly, the prayer for stay is refused.\n\n [PRANAB KUMAR CHATTOPADHYAY, J.]\n\n [TAPAN MUKHERJEE, J.]",
