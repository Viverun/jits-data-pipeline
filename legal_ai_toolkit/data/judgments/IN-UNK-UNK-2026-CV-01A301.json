The suit schedule property as per schedule is as\nunder:\n\n All that piece and parcel of property bearing No.14/3, I\ncross, Muneshwara Block, P.G Halli Bengaluru coming under\nthe jurisdiction of Malleshwaram Zone, measuring east to\nwest:12.6feet north to south: 40 feet totally measuring 500\nsq, ft., bounded on the\n East: Private property\n West: Subramani & his children property\n North: Road\n South: property No.55.\n\n 3. The case of the plaintiff as stated in the plaint\naverments briefly stated a follows:-\n\n Plaintiffs are the legal heirs of late K. Chandra, wherein\n1st plaintiff is the legally wedded wife of K. Chandra, plaintiffs\nNo.2 and 3 are the sons of late K.Chandra, born out of\nwedlock between 1st plaintiff and late K. Chandra. It is\n\n 4 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nalleged that, late K. Chandra illegally get married to one Smt.\nVennila and through her, he has three children who are\ndefendants and they are represented by their mother Smt.\nVennila K. Chandra died on 24/10/2002.\n\n It is further alleged that, during life time of K. Chandra,\nthere was partition effected between K. Chandra, his mother\nand his brothers on 8/2/2002 wherein property bearing\nNo.14/3, I cross, Muneshwara Block was partitioned amongst\nthem and as per the said partition, K. Chandra and the\nillegitimate children ie., defendants were allotted 'B' schedule\nproperty in the said partition deed and their share is property\nbearing No. 14/3, I cross, Muneshwara Block, P.G.Halli,\nBengaluru measuring about 12.6 feet X 40 feet morefully\ndescribed in the schedule and this property hereinafter\nreferred as suit schedule property. Plaintiffs alleged that,\nthey have not been made as parties to the said partition deed.\n\n It is alleged that, suit schedule property was the self-\nacquired property of grand-father of plaintiffs No.2 and 3\nherein. As such they are also entitled for equal share in the\nsuit property along with their father. For obvious reasons,\nthese plaintiffs were not made as parties to the said partition\nof the year 2002. Plaintiff No.2 and 3 father died on\n24/10/2007 and the plaintiffs are legal heirs of K. Chandra\nare entitled for the half share in the suit schedule property.\nAfter the death of K. Chandra, these plaintiffs approached the\n\n 5 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\ndefendants' mother and sought for division of suit schedule\nproperty. But, defendants mother refused to effect partition\nand to allot any share. But, their request was turned down\nby her instead abused the plaintiffs and even threatened\nthem of dire consequences if they claim any share in the suit\nschedule property. Plaintiffs alleged that the marriage of K.\nChandra with Smt.Vennila is illegal and the said marriage\nhas taken place during the subsistence of marriage between\nplaintiff and deceased K. Chandra.\n\n The plaintiff alleged that they being legal heirs of late\nK.Chandra are entitled for equal share in the suit schedule\nproperty. Though the defendants are illegitimate children,\nsince their rights are protected under \nsection 16\n of Hindu\nMarriage Act 1955, plaintiffs do not want to define the\ndeclaration of their half share in the suit schedule property\nthough defendants are appraised about the above aspect.\nBut, defendants mother not heeded their request and she\ndenied the legitimate claim of plaintiffs and had thrown the\nchallenge that no cost they would part the property to the\nplaintiffs.\n\n The plaintiffs and defendants are entitled for 1/6th\nshare each in the suit schedule property. As such being the\ncase, the plaintiffs together are entitled for half share so also\nthe defendants together are entitled for half share in the suit\n\n 6 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nschedule property as per \nsection 6\n & \n8\n of Hindu Succession\nAct.\n\n The plaintiffs have alleged cause of action to file this\nsuit arose when the defendants have partitioned the property\nin the absence of defendants and suit schedule property after\nthe death of K. Chandra on 24/10/2007 and when\ndefendants denied of their due share in the suit schedule\nproperty. Hence, plaintiff claiming to be legal heirs of late K.\nChandra have filed this suit for partition and separate\npossession.\n\n 4. Defendants' Minor guardian mother Smt. Vennila\nappeared and filed her written statement contending that suit\nis not maintainable either in law and facts. The first plaintiff\nis not legally wedded wife of late K. Chandra who died on\n24/10/2007 and the first plaintiff has not produced any\nevidence to show that her marriage was held with deceased\nLate K.Chandra. Plaintiffs are not the coparceners and the\nsuit for partition is not maintainable. Plaintiffs have to\nestablish that they belong to joint family and suit schedule\nproperty is joint family property. She contended that if really\nthe plaintiffs were joint family members, they could not be\nfrom the partition . Plaintiffs have not questioned the\nlegality of the registered partition deed dated 8.8.2002 and\nall the joint family properties were not included in this suit.\n\n 7 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nThus the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties.\nSuit for partial partition is not maintainable. If the plaintiffs\nwere dispossessed from the joint family, the only remedy\navailable for the plaintiffs to sue for possession and suit for\npartition is not maintainable. Suit is barred by registered\npartition deed dated 8.8.2002. The suit is filed by plaintiffs is\nan abuse of the process of law with an intention of harassing\ndefendants. It is contended further that execution of\nregistered partition deed dated 8.8.2002, the father of\ndefendant No.1 to 3 died on 24.10.2007 and their mother\nSmt. Vennila appointed as a minor guardian.. Further\ndefendants filed application before BBMP requesting for\ntransfer of khatha in their name and BBMP considering the\nrequest of the defendants, katha is changed in their name\nand they are paying tax to the suit schedule property.\nHence, defendants are in lawful possession and enjoyment\nover the suit schedule property. The plaintiffs are totally\nstrangers had no manner of right, title and interest over\nthe suit schedule property. Defendants have denied the\nstatus of the plaintiffs that they are LRs of deceased\nK.Chandrashekar and 1st plaintiff is legally wedded wife of\nlate K.Chandrashekar. The mother of defendants Smt.\nVennila had got married to late K.Chandrashekar on\n19.6.1994 at Sri Valle Malai Vellore Anbargal Chouldri at\nVellore as per Hindu Rites and Customs. Out of wed-lock,\n\n 8 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\ndefendants have born . Defendants are Class-I heirs of\ndeceased K.Chandrashekar. The defendants have pleaded in\nre-para No.3 regarding registered partition deed dated\n8.8.2002 held between Smt. Savithramma and sons of\ndeceased M. Subramani and late Chandra and defendants.\nThe defendants have specifically denied the allegations\naverred in para No.4 to 8 that the suit is vexatious and court\nfee paid is not sufficient and there is no cause of action.\nHence defendants on this defense contested this suit filed by\nthe plaintiffs and pray for dismissal of the suit.\n\n 4. Based upon these pleadings, the following issues\nare framed for trial of the suit :-\n\n 1. Whether the plaintiffs prove that plaintiff\n No.1 is the wife of late K.Chandra and\n plaintiff No.2 and 3 are the sons of late\n K.Chandra through the plaintiff?\n\n 2. Whether the plaintiffs prove that they are\n entitled for ½ share in the suit schedule\n property?\n\n 3. Whether the defendants prove that plaintiffs\n are not the coparceners, therefore, suit for\n partition is not maintainable?\n\n 4. Whether the defendants prove that suit of\n the plaintiffs is barred by limitation?\n\n 9 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\n 5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for the\n relief of partition and separate possession of\n their share from suit schedule property?\n\n 6. To what order or decree?\n\n 5. In order to prove the above issues, the parties to the\nsuit have lead their oral and documentary evidence wherein\n1st plaintiff is examined as P.W.1 and got marked Ex.P.1 to\nP.7 and closed her side and on behalf of defendants, their\nmother is examined as D.W.1 and Ex.D.1 to Ex.D.22 are\nmarked and closed her side and thereafter, this case is\nposted for arguments.\n\n 6. Counsel for plaintiff filed written arguments and\nheard the arguments of advocate for defendants and posted\nthe suit for judgment.\n\n \nCounsel for defendants relied upon citation reported in\nAIR 1993 Supreme Court 957 in the case of \nVinay Krishna\nVs. Keshav Chandra and another\n. I have perused the \nratio\n\nlaid down in\n this decision. Apex Court has discussed \nSec. 42\n\nof Specific Relief Act. Suit for declaration of share in property\n\n- Plaintiff was not in exclusive possession of property because\ntwo other persons and also tenants were in occupation-Failure\nof plaintiff to claim relief of possession-Discretion of court in\ngranting decree for declaration and possession is barred.\n\n 10 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\n And another decision reported in 2008(4) KCCR 2333\n(DB) ( M.Prithviraj and others Vs. Smt. Leelamma.N and others)\n\n- Hindu Law-Long spell of living together -Man and woman\npresumption of marriage- It is a rebuttable presumption.\n\n 7. During pendency of suit, 1st defendant has attained\nmajority and defendants have filed I.A.No.12 on 22.4.2015 and\nafter hearing I.A.No. 12 came to be allowed on 21.2.2015 and\n1st defendant is permitted to prosecute this suit in her own\ncapacity and guardianship of her mother is discharged.\n\n 8. On appreciation of the pleadings and oral evidence\nand documentary evidence placed on record by both parties\nand considering the arguments addressed by the respective\ncounsel and on perusal of decisions cited herein by the counsel\nfor defendants, I answer the above issues are as follows:-\n\n Issue No.1: In affirmative\n Issue No.2: In affirmative\n Issue No.3: In negative\n Issue No.4: In negative\n Issue No.5: In affirmative\n Issue No.6: Suit of the plaintiff deserves to\n be decreed against defendants in\n respect of suit schedule property\n\n 11 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\n without any order as to costs for\n the following:\n\n REASONS\n\n 9. Issue No.1to 3 :- Since these issues are main issues\nto be considered by this court in view of pleadings filed by\nboth parties and hence, issue No.1 to 3 are taken up for\ndiscussion together in order to avoid the repetition of facts\nand evidence.\n\n 10. Plaintiffs 1 to 3 have filed this suit for partition and\nseparate possession against defendants wherein defendant\nNo.1 to 3 are minors as on the date of filing the suit and as\nsuch plaintiffs have filed this suit against defendant No.1 to 3\nrepresented by their mother and natural guardian Smt.\nVenilla wherein defendant No.1 to3 are represented by their\nmother as minor guardian in this suit and it is the case of the\nplaintiff that first plaintiff is legally wedded wife of deceased\nK.Chandra, who died on 24/10/2007 and plaintiffs 2 and 3\nare the legitimate sons born out of wedlock between first\nplaintiff and deceased K. Chandra and plaintiffs have claimed\ntheir alleged partition rights in respect of suit schedule\nproperty alleging that there was partition deed held between\ndefendants and other sharers on 8/2/2002 and as such\nplaintiffs claiming to be legitimate legal heirs of deceased\n\n 12 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nK.Chandra. After demise of K. Chandra, plaintiffs\napproached the defendant's mother and sought for partition\nin the suit schedule property by effecting division. But,\ndefendants' minor guardian ie., mother refused to effect\npartition in the suit schedule property and hence, plaintiffs\nhave filed this suit for partition and separate possession in\nrespect of suit schedule property, which is house property\nbearing No. 14/3 I cross, Muneshwara Block, P.G.halli,\nBengaluru within the jurisdiction of Bruhat Bengaluru\nMahanagara Palike , Malleshwaram Zone measuring east to\nwest:12.6\", north to south:40\" totally measuring 500 sq, ft.,\nbounded on East: private property, West by: Subramani & his\nchildren property, North by Road and South by property\nNo.55. Defendants' minor guardian contested the suit by\nfiling written statement denied the claim of plaintiffs and also\ndenied the status of first plaintiff as she is the legally wedded\nwife of deceased K.Chandra and also denied the status of\nplaintiff No.2 and 3 born to late K. Chandra and first plaintiff\nout of wedlock and on the contrary, defendant's guardian\nmother contended that plaintiffs are strangers who are\nexcluded from consideration in the registered partition held\non 8/2/2002 between her mother-in-law Smt. Savithramma\nand deceased K.Chandra and sons of deceased brother M.\nSubramani in partition of joint family properties and\ndefendant's minor guardian also contended that she is legally\n\n 13 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nwedded wife of K.Chandra as she married to deceased as per\nHindu customs and usage on 19/6/1994 wherein deceased\nK. Chandra is related to her as maternal uncle, brother of her\nmother and defendant No.1 to 3 are legitimate children born\nto her out of wedlock between herself and late K.Chandra and\nafter demise of her husband, she filed application for\nmutation of names of defendant s and accordingly, Bruhat\nBengaluru Mahanagara Palike changed the katha in the\nname of defendant No.1 to 3 and minor guardian of\ndefendants contended that this suit for partition is not\nmaintainable and plaintiffs should have sought for\ndeclaration for first plaintiff's status and she has to prove the\nmarital relation with late K. Chandra and plaintiffs are out of\npossession and as such the partition suit is not maintainable\nand also suit relief is barred by limitation. Hence, with this\ndefence, minor guardian of defendants Smt. Venilla has filed\nwritten statement and contested the suit.\n\n 11.

Chandra was also called\nas K.Chandrashekar and she admits that in Ex.D.3, K.\nChandra had signed as K.Chandra and she do not know the\ncontents of Ex.D.1 and caste of K. Chandra, he belongs to\nGowda Community. But, D.W.1 voluntarily stated that, she\nbelongs to SC caste and D.W.1 also stated that, she has\ndeclared the caste of defendant No.1 to 3 before school\nauthorities as they belongs to SC caste and D.W.1 in her own\nlanguage stated that caste of defendants as \"nakimaru\" caste\nand she denied her knowledge regarding the contents of\nEx.P.3 and she do not know whether school authorities had\nmade note of the caste of minor plaintiffs as Hindu Gounder\non the information given by late K. Chandra. D.W.1 denied\nher knowledge regarding late K. Chandra married with first\nplaintiff and she had already two sons/children out of\nwedlock with K.Chandra and she do not know that deceased\nK. Chandra already having children of about 9 years and she\ndo not know whether plaintiff had issued election identity\ncard in the year 2002 and in that card, husband of plaintiff is\nshown as K. Chandra and she do not know about the alleged\nnotice issued by police department to late K.Chandra.\n\n 16. D.W.1 further cross-examined on 9/10/2015\nwherein she admits after confrontation of Ex.D.3 wherein she\nidentified the signature of late K. Chandra and she confronted\n\n 25 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nwith Ex.P.7 and asked to identify the signature of K. Chandra\nwherein at the first instance, she denied the signature of K.\nChandra on Ex.P.7, but, again at same stretch she admits the\nsignature of Ex.P.7 stating that, this signature of K. Chandra\nis having resemblance to that of signature of K. Chandra and\nshe do not know whether her husband had already married\nfirst plaintiff and he has got two sons through first plaintiff\nand sons of her husband through his wife, who are plaintiff\nNo.2 and 3 in this suit and D.W.1 denied that caste of her\nhusband is different from her caste. Hence, there are no\npossibility of K. Chandra marrying her and she denied that\nthere is no marital tie between herself and late K. Chandra\nand she denied that Ex.D.2 produced by her his created\ndocument for the purpose of this suit and D.W.1 further\ndenied that in order to avoid the legitimate share of plaintiffs,\nshe deposed false evidence before this court.\n\n 17. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted his arguments\ncontending that there is no specific denial by defendants that\nguardian in respect of marriage plea in between deceased K.\nChandra and first plaintiff and D.W.1 denied her knowledge\nregarding marital tie with first plaintiff and late K. Chandra\nand counsel for plaintiff relied upon school records and\noriginal birth certificates and T.C produced in respect of\nplaintiff No.2 and 3 contending that birth certificates issued\n\n 26 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nby competent authority under Birth and Death Act are\nhaving legal presumption regarding entries contained in this\nbirth certificate as per \nsection 35\n of Indian Evidence Act and\ned1 to ed4 are admissible documents and also Ex.P.7 which\nis statement given by deceased K. Chandra before the\nconcerned police station on 15/4/2005 and in this statement,\ndeceased himself has admitted the status of first plaintiff and\nthat of Smt. Venilla and hence, Ex.P.7 is material document\nto hold that first plaintiff is the first wife of deceased and\nplaintiff No.2 and 3 are legitimate sons of late K.Chandra and\nfirst plaintiff herein. Hence, counsel for plaintiff relied upon\nEx.P.1 to 7 praying for legitimate share of the plaintiffs 1 to 3\nas the alleged partition deed Ex.P.5 is not binding upon the\nplaintiffs and plaintiffs need not file a suit for declaration of\ntheir status and possession relief, wherein suit for partition\nis maintainable as plaintiffs are claiming their legitimate\nshare as they are legal heirs of deceased K. Chandra who died\non 24/10/2007.\n\n 18. Learned Counsel for defendants in his arguments\ncontended that suit is not maintainable for partition and\nseparate possession wherein plaintiffs shall have to file suit\nfor declaration of their status as per provisions of \nSection 34\n\nand \n42\n of Specific Relief Act and plaintiffs are not in exclusive\npossession and they have also not specifically stated in\n\n 27 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nrespect of their dispossession from the suit schedule\nproperty, hence, he relied upon Apex court decision reported\nin AIR 1993 SCpage 957 in a case of Vinay Krishna Vrs\nKeshav Chandra and another contending that suit for\npartition is not maintainable and plaintiff No.1 in her\npleadings has not stated the specific date of her marriage with\nlate K.Chandra and hence, plaintiffs have failed to prove their\nstatus as first wife of deceased K. Chandra by first plaintiff\nand as such plaintiff No.2 and 3 are not legitimate sons born\nto deceased K. Chandra and hence, plaintiffs are not entitled\nfor partition and separate possession.\n\n 19. On appreciation of oral and documentary evidence\nplaced on record, wherein plaintiff has filed this suit along\nwith her two sons claiming partition in the suit schedule\nproperty claiming that she is the wife of deceased K. Chandra\nand plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are her legitimate children born out\nof wedlock between first plaintiff and late K. Chandra. On\nperusal of plaintiff's documents, marked through P.W.1,\nwherein Ex.P.1 and 2 are the original birth certificate issued\nby competent authority, wherein in these two documents\nname of deceased K. Chandra and Neela ie., first plaintiff is\nmentioned wherein a male child was born on 31/7/1987 and\non 14/10/1989 and in Ex.P.3, T.C issued by the school\nauthorities in respect of second plaintiff, wherein father\n\n 28 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nname is appearing as K. Chandra and as caste/religion\nshown as Hindu Gounder and 2nd plaintiff obtained his T.C\nafter passing 5th standard and Ex.P.4 is Election Identity card\nheld by first plaintiff issued by Election Commission of India\nwherein husband's name in this Ex.P.4 is shown as K.\nChandra and address of plaintiff No.1 shown as No. 526, 11th\nA cross road, RMV extention, Jayamahal extension,\nBengaluru. Ex.P.5 is registered partition deed dated:\n\n8/2/2002. After perusal of Ex.P.6, it is endorsement issued\nby Commissioner of Police as per the complaint filed by\nplaintiff No.1 and Ex.P.6 is issued on 24/12/2005 and Ex.P.7\nis the statement of deceased K. Chandra, S/o Kuppaswamy\nmade before Vyalikaval Police station on 15/4/2005 wherein\ndeceased K. Chandra admits that he was residing in House\nNo.78, I cross, Vyalikaval, Bengaluru along with his second\nwife and children and first wife had filed complaint against\nhim and he has understood the ingredients of complaint, but,\ndeceased K. Chandra denied the allegation of harassment on\nher and it is stated in this statement that his wife, first\nplaintiff was residing separately since many years and she\nwas having two children and though he called for leading\nmarital life to first plaintiff, but, she refused and residing\nseparately and deceased had made reference of partition\neffected between himself and his brother and now he is\nstaying along with his second wife and defendants and\n\n 29 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\ninterest he statement it is stated that he did not change the\nkatha of the suit schedule property either in the name of first\nwife or second wife and he had no necessity to change the\nkatha in the name of his first wife or second wife and he had\nintention of effecting equal division when time comes and\nfurther it is recited that he is ready to receive first plaintiff if\nshe is ready to lead marital life with him and he will make\narrangements for residence and for which his brother's sons\nnamely Ravi and Ramesh have not objected and as such with\nthis submission, deceased K. Chandra has given statement\non 15/4/2005 before the concerned police station and\nassured that hence-forth, he will look after his wife and see\nthat she could not face any inconvenience.\n\n 20. Counsel for plaintiff during cross-examination of\nD.W.1, confronted the admitted signature of K. Chandra on\nEx.D.3 ie., partition deed dated: 8/2/2002 wherein D.W.1\nadmitted the signature of K. Chandra on Ex.D.3 and further\nEx.P.7 was confronted to D.W.1 for identification of signature\nof late K. Chandra wherein initially she denied to identify the\nsignature on Ex.P.7 but, at the same breath, D.W.1 state that\nsignature on Ex.P.7 of late K. Chandra is resembling as\ncompared to Ex.D.3 signature and though plaintiffs have not\nproduced any specific documents in respect of marriage\nproof, but, P.W.1 stated that all the documents of her\n\n 30 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nmarriage with late K. Chandra are in the custody of deceased\nand P.W.1 stated that their marriage was performed in\nSubramani temple in the vicinity of Malleshwaram and\nconsidering the recitals of Ex.P.7 and though plaintiffs have\nnot obtained any expert opinion under \nsection 45\n of Evidence\nAct by sending Ex.P.7 and Ex.D.3. But, this court has to\nresort \nSection 73\n of Indian Evidence Act by comparison of\ndisputed and admitted signatures of deceased K. Chandra by\ncomparison of Ex.P.7 and Ex.D.3 wherein it appears that\nfrom the text of Ex.P.7, it can be inferred that relation\nbetween K. Chandra and first plaintiff are strained and first\nplaintiff was residing in separately deserting the company of\nK. Chandra and it appears that there were no cordial\nrelationship between deceased K. Chandra and first plaintiff\nafter plaintiff No.2 and 3 were born to them and it appears\nthat K. Chandra had married Smt. Venilla, who is his sister's\ndaughter, daughter of Vasantha on 19/6/1994 and\nconsidering Ex.P.2 and 3 wherein plaintiff No.2 and 3 were\nborn in the year 1987 and 1989 and as such considering the\nevidence of P.W.1, wherein she ahs approached this court of\nlaw stating that she was married to deceased K. Chandra and\nplaintiff No.2 and 3 are born to her out of wedlock. Though\nplaintiff has not produced any documentary evidence in proof\nof marriage and admittedly, P.W.1 is illiterate lady and in her\nevidence stated that she was working as maid servant when\n\n 31 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nshe came over to Bengaluru in the house of Chandrashekar, a\nLawyer by profession in Sadashivanagar and deceased K.\nChandra was also working in Garage and P.W.1 stated that\nshe was working as mad servant in the house situated at\nGeethanjali Theatre and in that place itself, deceased K.\nChandra was working and they loved each other and\ndeceased married her and hence, Ex.P.7 which is vital\ndocument and material piece of evidence to establish the\nrelationship of first plaintiff and that of deceased K. Chandra\nand plaintiff had discharged her burden by producing Ex.P.7\nwherein it is statement made by deceased K. Chandra during\nhis life time and whereas onus of disproving Ex.P.7 shifts on\nD.W.1, wherein D.W.1 accept her oral evidence, but, she has\nnot lead any evidence of her family member in order to rebut\nthe document Ex.P.7. On the contrary, D.W.1 failed to\nexamine her mother Smt. Vasantha who is material witness\nand best witness to speak the marital relationship of first\nplaintiff with deceased brother K. Chandra. However,\ndocuments produced by D.W.1 shows that late K. Chandra\nmarried to D.W.1 on 19/6/1994 as per Ex.D.2 and it is a fact\nthat as per Ex.D.3 there was partition in respect of suit\nschedule property between Smt. Savithramma, wife of\nKuppuswamy and her sons wherein elder son namely M.\nSubramani died on 2/4/2001 leaving behind his three sons\nwho are parties in this partition deed and late K.Chandra\n\n 32 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nand defendant No.1 to 3 are parties to this partition. Wherein\nplaintiffs are not parties to Ex.D.3 partition deed dated:\n\n8/2/2002. Hence, plaintiffs have filed this suit for partition\nand separate possession wherein as per decision reported in\n2008(4) KCCR 2333 Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court of\nKarnataka in a case of M.Prithviraj and others Vs. Smt.\nLeelamma.N and others, wherein Head note 'A' of this\ndecision ratio laid down wherein long spell of living together\nmen and woman presumption of marriage, it is rebuttable\npresumption and burden casted on defendant to rebut the\npresumption and this ratio held that relationship can be\ninferred looking marital status and also children born are\nlegitimate children and in this case also first plaintiff stated\nthat late K. Chandra married to her and she was residing\nalong with K. Chandra and lead matrimonial life and as per\nEx.P.2 and Ex.P.3 plaintiff No.2 and 3 were born and Ex.P.7\nis material piece of evidence wherein deceased himself had\nadmitted the status of plaintiffs during his life time and\nhence considering the recitals of Ex.P.7 and considering the\ndate of birth of defendant No.1 to 3 wherein defendant No.1 to\n3 were born in the year 1996, 1999 and 2004. Considering\nthe birth extracts of defendant No.1 to 3 wherein deceased\nwho married D.W.1 subsequently in the year 1994 and\nthereafter defendant No.1 to 3 were born in between deceased\nK. Chandra and D.W.1. Hence, relying upon Ex.P.7 and\n\n 33 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\ncoupled with other documents wherein the case of the\nplaintiff pleaded herein appears to be probable and first\nplaintiff proved to be the first wife of late K. Chandra and\nplaintiff No.2 and 3 are legitimate children of late K. Chandra\nand as per Ex.P.7, D.W.1 appears to be second wife and\ndefendant No.1 to 3 are children born to K. Chandra through\nD.W.1 and as such \nSection 16\n of Hindu Marriage Act apples\nto defendant No.1 to 3 wherein it appears that late K.\nChandra had married D.W.1 during subsistence of marriage\nwith first plaintiff. However, plaintiffs have admitted that\ndefendant No.1 to 3 are having half share in the suit schedule\nproperty and hence, contention of defendants that suit for\npartition is not maintainable is not acceptable contention and\ncitation relied by them is not squarely applicable to the facts\nof this case and on the contrary, plaintiffs have challenged\nEx.D.3, partition deed by filing this partition suit and it is\nsettled proposition of law that one partition relief is claimed\nin joint family property wherein plaintiffs need not be claimed\ndeclaration in respect of registered documents for which\nthey are not the parties as executants and one holds that\nplaintiffs are entitled to partition, then in that circumstances,\nit is to be presumed that any registered documents came into\neffect in the absence of plaintiffs wherein such document is\nnot binding upon plaintiffs' share and in this case also,\nplaintiffs are not parties to Ex.D.3 and hence, Ex.D.3 does\n\n 34 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\nnot take away the rights of plaintiffs in the suit schedule\nproperty. Hence, plaintiffs are entitle for legitimate share in\nthe suit schedule property claimed by them and as such I\nhold that plaintiffs have proved that they are entitled for\nhalf share and accordingly, Issue No.1 and 2 are answered in\naffirmative and Issue No.3 is answered in negative.\n\n 21. Defendants have contended in their written\nstatement that suit filed by the plaintiff is barred by\nlimitation. But, this contention taken by defendants is not\nsubstantiated by any cogent evidence and as such this\nremained as defence in the written statement. This suit\nbrought by plaintiff for the relief of partition and possession\non the cause of action as averred in the plaint and it is\nspecific case of the plaintiffs that they came to know about\nEx.D.3 and K.Chandra died on 24/10/2007 wherein this suit\nbrought by plaintiffs within two years of date of death of K.\nChandra and plaintiffs have proved that they are first wife\nand children of K. Chandra and he was also called by\nK.Chandrashekara and hence, this suit brought by the\nplaintiffs as per Article110 of Limitation Act is well within\nprescribed time in respect of partition relief and hence,\ndefendants have failed to prove their contention raised in\nrespect of plea of limitation. Accordingly, issue No.4 is\nanswered in negative.\n\n 35 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\n 21. ISSUE NO.5:-This issue is framed in respect of\nrelief of partition prayed by the plaintiffs. Wherein plaintiffs\nhave sought for awarding half share and considering the facts\nand circumstances of this case, plaintiff No.2 and 3 are\nlegitimate children of K. Chandra and whereas defendant\nNo.1 to 3 are though illegitimate children, but, \nsection 16\n© of\n\nHindu Marriage Act\n applies to defendant No.1 to 3 and in\nview of recent legal proposition, wherein illegitimate children\nare also entitled to get equal share in their father's property\nand as such plaintiffs and defendants are entitled for 1/6th\nshare in the suit schedule property and hence, plaintiffs have\nproved that, they are entitled to get legitimate share in the\nsuit schedule property, which is the property belongs to\ndeceased K. Chandra obtained in registered partition deed\ndated: 8/2/2002 and hence, plaintiffs are entitled for share\nas claimed in this suit and as such this suit filed by the\nplaintiffs deserves to be decreed with costs against\ndefendants. Accordingly, Issue No.5 is answered in\naffirmative.\n\n 22. Issue No.6: In view of my findings arrived and\ndiscussed and reasons given on Issue No.1 to 5, the suit filed\nby the plaintiff deserves to be decreed against defendants 1 to\n\n3. Hence, I proceed to pass the following:-\n\n 36 OS. No.7080 of 2009\n\n ORDER\n Suit filed by the plaintiffs for the relief of partition and\nseparate possession is hereby decreed with costs.\n\n Plaintiffs together are entitled for half share in the\nsuit schedule property and the share of plaintiffs can be\ndivided by appointing Court Commissioner as per amended\nsection 54 of C.P.C.\n\n Draw preliminary decree accordingly.\n\n {Dictated to the Judgment writer , transcribed by her,\ncorrected and then pronounced by me in open court this 29th\nday of February 2016.}\n\n (S.V.KULKARNI)\n XI ADDL.CITY CIVIL JUDGE\n BANGALORE CITY.\n\n ANNEXUERE\n\nList of witnesses examined for plaintiff:-\n\nP.W.1 Smt.
