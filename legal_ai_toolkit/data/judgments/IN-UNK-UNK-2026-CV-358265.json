If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is\n woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power,\n then woman is immeasurably man's superior. Has she not\n greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not\n greater powers of endurance, has she not greater courage?\n Without her, man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our\n being, the future is with woman. Who can make a more effective\n appeal to the heart than woman?\"----Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n1.

The accused has preferred not to cross examine PWs 4, 5, 10,\n13, 15, 16, 17, 27, 28 and 29 and therefore their evidence as well as the\ndocuments proved by them can be presumed to have been admitted as\ncorrect by the accused since their evidence remains uncontroverted and\nunrebutted.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE ACCUSED UNDER SECTION 313 OF\nTHE CR.P.C.\n\n9. In his statement under \nsection 313\n of the Cr.P.C., accused\nVenktanjaneya Pratap Singh has controverted and rebutted the entire\nevidence against him submitting that he was working as a Supervisor in\nCiti Collections Company where the prosecutrix also used to work as a\ntele caller. Apart from them, there were many other boys and girls\nemployed for various works some of whom were Mr.Manish, Mr.Vicky,\nMr.Amit, Mr.Raj Kumar, Ms.Mona, Ms.Dimple, Ms.Pooja etc. All of\nthem used to be on friendly terms and during holidays and leisure time\nthey used to go for lunch, movies etc. He did not know anything\nregarding why the prosecutrix tried to end her life. He came to know later\non that she used to like him and on objections from her parents, she took\nthe extreme step of trying to end her life. This was a very unfortunate\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 5 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 6 ::-\n\nincident in which he had no part to play. He also came to know later on\nthat since the prosecutrix was an earning member of her family and was\nhelping her household financially her parents did not want to marry her\noff due to which she remained frustrated. Although they were good\nfriends and colleagues, they never went out alone and were always\nsurrounded by other friends and colleagues. He had joined the\ninvestigation many times but once on calling of the I.O, he had gone to\nthe police station where to his shock, he was arrested after considerable\ntime of the incident. He is absolutely innocent. He has not committed any\noffence nor has done any wrong. He is suffering for no fault of his. None\nof the public/ independent witnesses have deposed anything against him.\nHe has preferred not to examine any witness in his defence.\n\nARGUMENTS\n\n10. I have heard arguments at length. I have also given my\nconscious thought and prolonged consideration to the material on record,\nrelevant provisions of law and the precedents on the point. I have also\ncarefully perused the written arguments filed on behalf of the accused.\n\n11. The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested\nfor convicting accused Mr.Venktanjaneya Pratap Singh for having\ncommitted the offence under \nsections 376\n and \n306\n of the IPC as the\nprosecution has been able to bring home the charge against the accused\nby examining its witnesses whose testimonies are corroborative and\nreliable. The three dying declarations of the prosecutrix are in continuity\nand the role of the accused is clearly elaborated. The investigation\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 6 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 7 ::-\n\nconducted in the case also proves that the accused is guilty of the charged\noffences.\n\n12. The counsel for the accused, on the other hand, has requested\nfor his acquittal submitting that there is nothing incriminating against the\naccused on the record. There are several glaring inconsistencies and\ncontradictions revealed in the evidence of the parents of the deceased\nprosecutrix. The first two dying declarations of the prosecutrix are correct\nbut the so called third dying declaration is manipulated and fabricated in\norder to falsely implicate the accused. The colleagues of the prosecutrix\nand the accused have not supported the prosecution case and had turned\nhostile. The story of the prosecution is so full of improbabilities,\ncontradictions and untrustworthy that it is hard to believe.\n\nDISCUSSION, ANALYSIS, OBSERVATIONS AND FINDINGS\n\n13. The question is how to test the veracity of the prosecution\nstory especially when it has some variations in the evidence. Mere\nvariance of the prosecution story with the evidence, in all cases, should\nnot lead to the conclusion inevitably to reject the prosecution story.\nEfforts should be made to find the truth, this is the very object for which\nthe courts are created. To search it out, the Courts have been removing\nchaff from the grain. It has to disperse the suspicious cloud and dust out\nthe smear as all these things clog the very truth. So long chaff, cloud and\ndust remains, the criminals are clothed with this protective layer to\nreceive the benefit of doubt. So it is a solemn duty of the Courts, not to\nmerely conclude and leave the case the moment suspicions are created. It\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 7 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 8 ::-\n\nis the onerous duty of the Court within permissible limit to find out the\ntruth. It means, on the other hand no innocent man should be punished\nbut on the other hand to see no person committing an offence should get\nscot-free. If in spite of such effort suspicion is not dissolved, it remains\nwrit at large, benefit of doubt has to be created to the accused. For this,\none has to comprehend the totality of facts and the circumstances as\nspelled out through the evidence, depending on the facts of each case by\ntesting the credibility of the witnesses, of course after excluding that part\nof the evidence which are vague and uncertain. There is no mathematical\nformula through which the truthfulness of the prosecution or a defence\ncase could be concretized. It would depend upon the evidence of each\ncase including the manner of deposition and his demeans, clarity,\ncorroboration of witnesses and overall, the conscience of a Judge evoked\nby the evidence on record. So the Courts have to proceed further and\nmake genuine efforts within judicial sphere to search out the truth and not\nstop at the threshold of creation of doubt to confer benefit of doubt.\n\n14. Under this sphere, I now proceed to test the submissions of\nboth the sides.\n\nCASE OF THE PROSECUTION, ALLEGATIONS AND\nDOCUMENTS PROVED IN EVIDENCE\n\n15. The prosecution story unveils with Mr. Rajesh Chopra (PW1)\nbringing his daughter (name mentioned in file but withheld to protect her\nidentity) while she was still alive after attempting suicide by first drinking\nacid and then pouring petrol on herself and setting herself on fire her, to\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 8 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 9 ::-\n\nDDU hospital, Hari Nagar and got her admitted.

PW1, Mr.Rajesh Chopra, father of prosecutix, has deposed\nthat his daughter/prosecutrix used to work at City Collection India Private\nLimited, Janakpuri.

He took her to DDU Hospital, Hari Nagar and got her\nadmitted there. At DDU Hospital, ASI Ashok of local police arrived and\nhad recorded the statement of his daughter (Ex.PW1/A) in his presence\nand in the presence of his wife, Ms.Babita Chopra. From DDU hospital,\nhis daughter was referred to RML hospital. On 25.02.2011, at about 10 or\n10.30 pm, he left the hospital and his wife was there at the hospital along\nwith prosecutrix. One boy namely Mr.Amit, colleague of his daughter,\nwas also there. He called the police by dialing number 100. Police arrived\nthere and again recorded the statement of her daughter. In this regard, his\nwife had told him. On 01.03.2011, he and his wife were present at RML\nHospital along with his daughter. On that day, his daughter told him that\nshe was in love with one persona namely Partap who also used to work in\nthe same company and Partap regularly maintained physical relations\nwith her on the pretext of marriage but on 23.02.2011 in the afternoon,\nwhen she came to know that Partap is getting married with some other\ngirl, she asked Partap as to whether he is going to marry with some other\ngirl, to which initially Partap refused and later on admitted that yes, he is\ngoing to marry. His daughter asked Partap as to why he had spoiled her\nlife, to which Partap said \"Zindagi Kharab Ho Gai Hai, To Atm Hatya\nKar Le, Zahar Khaa Le, Aur Agar Muh Khola, To Tujhe Jaan Se Maar\nDoonga\". On the dictation of his daughter, the abovesaid facts were\nreduced by him in writing in his own hand and his daughter put her thumb\nimpression on the same at two places and he also signed the same.

On 03.03.2011 at about\n5.45 or 6.00pm, his daughter expired. On 04.03.2011, he identified the\ndead body of his daughter at Mortuary and after postmortem, he received\nher dead body. His statement regarding identification of dead body\n(Ex.PW1/C) and the dead body handing over memo (Ex.PW1/D) were\nprepared. He had not seen accused Partap as such he can not identify him.\n\nHe had written Ex.PW1/B as per the version given by his\ndaughter/prosecutrix. His daughter had told him that the said Partap Singh\nis residing at Press Colony, Rajouri Garden. She also told him that\naccused Partap Singh had committed \"Galat Kaam\" upon her\n(prosecutrix) after taking her to his house at Press colony, Rajouri Garden\nin the absence of his parents. At the time of recording of Ex.PW1/B by\nhim, as per her version, prosecutrix i.e. his daughter was fit for statement\n(Hosho Hawas Mein Thee).\n\n28. PW3, Ms. Babita, mother of prosecutix, has deposed that the\nprosecutrix since deceased was my daughter. At the time of incident, she\nwas doing job in City Collection India Private Limited, Janakpuri. On the\nnight intervening 23/24.02.2011, her daughter had set herself on fire on\nthe roof of her house. She was taken to DDU Hospital by her husband and\nthereafter she was referred to RML Hospital, Delhi. Her daughter was\nhaving burn injury on her hands and other parts of the body and therefore\nshe was not able to write, however, she was in fit state of mind and was\nspeaking properly. The statement of her daughter was written by her\nhusband Mr. Rajesh Chopra as per dictation and version given by her\ninjured daughter and thereafter the said statement was signed by her\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 18 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 19 ::-\n\nhusband and her daughter had put her thumb right impression on the\nsame. Her daughter did not give any statement in DDU Hospital in her\npresence. The statement of her daughter was recorded by the police only\nin RML Hospital and the said statement was signed by her and her\ndaughter had put her right thumb impression on her statement\n(Ex.PW3/A). Her injured daughter had told her in the hospital that one\nboy namely Partap who is working in the same company where she was\nworking, is going to marry with other girl and she also told her that this\nfact was told to her by her other colleagues working in the same\ncompany. Her daughter also told her that as Partap had ruined her life\n(Meri Zindagi Barbad Kar Di) and when she asked Partap, what will\nhappen with her in future \"Mera Kaya Hoga\". On this fact, Partap had\ntold her that \"Main Tuje Jaan Se Maar Doonga Aur Atamhatya Kyon\nNahi Kar Leti\". She also told her that accused Partap had made physical\nrelation with her on the pretext that he will marry with her. Accused\nVenketanjaneya Partap Singh was not known to her prior to the incident.\nIO recorded her statement in this regard.\n\n29. As per the prosecution, there are three dying declarations of\nthe prosecutrix i.e. Ex.PW1/A on 24.02.2011, Ex.PW3/A on 25.02.2011\nand Ex.PW1/B on 01.03.2011. She expired on 03.03.2011.\n\n30. PW1 has deposed that the statement of the prosecutrix,\nEx.PW1/A, was recorded by the IO in DDU Hospital in the presence of\nPWs 1 and 3. PW3/A was recorded in RML Hospital by the IO in the\npresence of PW3 and he (PW1) had already left the hospital.

His wife (PW3) was also there. However, in his\ncross examination, he has deposed that \"The first statement given by my\ndaughter was in my presence. No magistrate was present at that time of\nrecording of the statement. I was informed that the IO had recorded the\nstatement of my daughter on 25.02.2011 but I was not present. My wife\nhad informed me about the same. ..........I do not know anything about\nthe first two statements of my daughter. .....At the time when she had\nmade her statement on 01.03.2011 the police official was not present\nbut he had instructed to me to take down the statement in writing. I did\nnot call any doctor as there was no doctor present at that time. My\ndaughter was in ICU when I had recorded her statement. I had\nrecorded the statement at about 2.30 to 3.00pm. There was nobody\npresent (doctor, nurse or ward boy) in the ICU. Except my wife, nobody\nelse was present.....\"\n\n31. When PW1 has deposed that he did not know anything about\nthe first two statements of his daughter, the same would indicate that he\nwas not present when Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A were recorded.\nAdmittedly, he was not present when Ex.PW3/A was recorded.\n\n32. PW3 has deposed that \"No police officer visited DDU\nHospital.\" If this was the situation, then Ex.PW1/A could not have been\nrecorded.\n\n33. As regards Ex.PW1/B (third and the most important dying\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 20 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 21 ::-\n\ndeclaration), when PW1 has deposed that the police official was not\npresent but he had instructed to him to take down the statement in writing,\nthe same indicates that the IO was aware that the prosecutrix wanted to\nmake a fresh statement on 01.03.2011 but the IO did not bother to go\ninside the hospital and meet the prosecutrix and record her statement after\ntaking fitness certificate from the doctor, as he had done at the time of\nrecording of Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A.\n\n34. Now coming to the evidence of the mother of the prosecutrix\n(PW3), she has deposed that the statement of her daughter was written by\nher husband Mr. Rajesh Chopra as per dictation and version given by her\ninjured daughter and thereafter the said statement was signed by her\nhusband and her daughter had put her thumb right impression on the\nsame. Her daughter did not give any statement in DDU Hospital in her\npresence. The statement of her daughter was recorded by the police only\nin RML Hospital and the said statement was signed by her and her\ndaughter had put her right thumb impression on her statement\n(Ex.PW3/A).\n\n35. PW3, in her cross examination has deposed that \"My\nstatement was recorded by police officer namely Mr. Ashok Kumar on\n24.02.2011 at RML Hospital. My statement was not recorded at DDU\nHospital. I had signed my statement. My daughter had affixed her\nthumb impression on the statement (Ex.PW3/A) but I do not remember\nif the thumb impression was of right hand or left hand.

PW1 has deposed that he had left the RML hospital when the\nIO had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW3/A) in the\npresence of PW3. However, PW3 has contradicted the evidence of PW1\nwhen she had deposed that her husband, PW1, was also present with her\nat the time of the statement of her daughter (Ex.PW3/A). This fact\nindicates the possibility of manipulation of the document (Ex.PW3/A)\nduring the investigation.\n\n37. Further, PW1 has deposed that he had written Ex.PW1/B on\nthe dictation of the prosecutrix but PW3 has deposed that her daughter\nremained in ICU Ward throughout and her husband did not go inside and\nshe used to sit inside. When PW1 did not go inside the ICU where the\nprosecutrix was admitted, then there was no occasion for him to meet the\nprosecutrix and write Ex.PW1/B on the dictation of the prosecutrix.

PW1 has deposed that \"I used to visit the ICU during the\nvisiting hours. I also had access to my daughter as were in attendance.\"\n\nPW3, on the other hand, has deposed that \"My daughter remained in\nICU Ward throughout and my husband did not go inside and I used to\nsit inside.\"\n\n39. PW3 has deposed that \"I did not ask anything from my\ndaughter at that time as her condition was not good and we were also\nshocked due to the incident.\" This conduct does not appear to be natural\nas the first thing after hospitalization of the prosecutrix would have been\nto ask her the reason for the suicide.\n\n40. PW1 has deposed that when he recorded Ex.PW1/B at about\n2:30 to 3:00 pm in the ICU of RML Hospital, there was nobody present\n(doctor, nurse or ward boy) in the ICU. Except his wife, nobody else was\npresent. However, PW3 has deposed that PW1 did not even go inside the\nICU. Also, it is unbelievable that in an ICU where a burn patient i.e. the\nprosecutrix was admitted, there was no doctor, nurse or ward boy or any\nother staff on duty. Also, it is not believable that in the ICU of RML\nHospital, no other patient was admitted there nor any other attendant of\nany patient was there. These facts indicate that the evidence of PW1\nregarding recording the statement of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW1/B-third\ndying declaration) is false, fabricated and manipulated.

Now regarding the statement under \nsection 161\n of the Cr.P.C.\nof PWs 1 and 3, it may be observed that the prosecutrix expired on\n03.03.2011. PW1 has deposed that \"The police recorded my statement in\nthis case in the hospital. I am not certain about the date on which my\nstatement was recorded. My statement was recorded prior to demise of\nmy daughter. .....My statement was not recorded after the demise of my\ndaughter. ..........\" PW3 has deposed that \"I do not remember whether\nI told the police in the statement under \nsection 161\n Cr.P.C that my\ndaughter was in fit state of mind and was speaking properly. My\nstatement was again recorded by the same police officer. I do not\nremember that date of such statement, however, I can not say whether it\nwas after some days, week or month. That statement was also recorded\nby the police officer at RML Hospital.\"\n\n42. As per the record, the statement of PW1 was recorded on\n05.05.2011 and the statement of PW3 was recorded on 03.05.2011. Both\nPWs 1 and 3 have deposed that their statements were recorded in RML\nHospital but the record shows otherwise. This fact also indicates the\npossibility of the evidence of PWs 1 and 3 being fabricated and\nmotivated.\n\n43. It is clear that the evidence of PW1 and 3 is full of glaring\nconfrontations, overwhelming contradictions, improbabilities and\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 24 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 25 ::-\n\nimprovements which are too material to be ignored and same strike a fatal\nblow to the prosecution story.\n\nTHREE DYING DECLARATIONS OF THE DECEASED\n\n44. As per the prosecution, there are three dying declarations of\nthe prosecutrix i.e. Ex.PW1/A on 24.02.2011, Ex.PW3/A on 25.02.2011\nand Ex.PW1/B on 01.03.2011.\n\n45. It is argued that when she made Ex.PW1/A on 24.02.2011,\nshe was hopeful that she would be saved and shall remain alive so she did\nnot even mention the name of the accused and only said that \"Mujhe\nkuch pareshani thi.....mujhe kissi se kuch pareshani nahi hai, main\napni zindagi se pareshan ho gai hun aur jeena nahi chahti\". Even when\nshe made Ex.PW3/A on 25.02.2011, she was hopeful that she would be\nsaved and shall remain alive so she only said that \"Mere ve Pratap ke\nbeech sharirik samanband bhi rahe hain.......Pratap ki shadi 11.3.2011\nko honi hai main is baat se bahut nirash hui aur marne ka faisla kar\nliya\". However, when she realized that she shall not live, she said very\nclearly in her third dying declaration, Ex.PW1/B, on 01.03.2011, that\naccused had physical relations with her on a false promise of marriage\nand he abetted her suicide.\n\n46. The counsel for the accused has vehemently argued that the\nfirst two dying declarations, which have been recorded by the IO, PW26,\nare correct and the third one, Ex.PW1/B on 01.03.2011, which is written\nby the father of the prosecutrix, is false and fabricated.

As regards Ex.PW1/A, it transpires that IO, PW26, had gone\nto DDU Hospital where he recorded the statement of the prosecutrix on\nwhich she put her thumb impression and her parents put their signatures.\nHe had also moved an application (Ex.PW26/A) and the doctor had\ncertified the patient fit for statement.\n\n48. As regards Ex.PW3/A, it transpires that IO, PW26, had gone\nto RML Hospital where he recorded the statement of the prosecutrix on\nwhich she put her thumb impression and her mother put her signatures.\nHe had also moved an application (Ex.PW26/C) and the doctor had\ncertified the patient fit for statement.\n\n49. As regards Ex.PW1/B, it transpires that IO, PW26, was given\nan application by the father of the prosecutrix, in allegations were leveled\nagainst the accused. It had the thumb impressions of the prosecutrix and\nthe signatures of her father.\n\n50. On careful perusal of the record, it is revealed that the IO,\nPW26, neither cared to go inside the RML Hospital to the ICU where the\nprosecutrix remained admitted from 25.02.2011 to 03.03.2011.\nEx.PW1/B was given to the IO, PW26, by PW1, father of the prosecutrix\non 01.03.2011 when he had gone to the RML Hospital on receipt of\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 26 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 27 ::-\n\ntelephone call from her father (as per PW26). The prosecutrix expired on\n03.03.2011 at about 5:45 or 6:00 pm (as per PW1). It transpires from the\nrecord that the IO did not even care to verify about the genuineness of\nEx.PW1/B and whether or not the prosecutrix had actually dictated the\nsame to PW1. He did not make any enquiry from any doctor or hospital\nstaff about Ex.PW1/B. He did not even bother to meet the prosecutrix\nwhile she was alive from 01.03.2011 till 03.03.2011 evening to enquire\nwhether or not she had actually made Ex.PW1/B. As he had done earlier\nwhile recording Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/B, the IO did not care to go to\nthe doctor between 01.03.2011 till 03.03.2011 to take the fitness of the\nprosecutrix and then record her next dying declaration.\n\n51. The least which was expected from the IO in such a serious\ncase was that on receipt of Ex.PW1/B, the IO should have gone to the\ndoctor, obtained the fitness certificate of the prosecutrix, met the\nprosecutrix and then recorded her next dying declaration and made\nverification of the veracity of Ex.PW1/B from the prosecutrix.\n\n52. As per the prosecution story the prosecutrix allegedly made\nthree statements/ dying declarations out of which the first two were\nrecorded in the presence of police officials by the IO where as the last\none, Ex.PW1/B, which is in the hand writing of the father of the\ndeceased, PW1, on the basis of which the present case was registered, has\nbeen recorded in the absence of the police, hospital staff or any\nMagistrate. If the prosecutrix had to implicate the accused, she could have\nrevealed his name at the first or second dying declarations in the presence\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 27 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 28 ::-\n\nof the police. The third statement of the prosecutrix has apparently been\ngenerated at the instance of the parents of the deceased.\n\n53. Here it may also be mentioned that PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 had\ngone to the hospital but could not meet the prosecutrix as she was\nunconscious. If the prosecutrix was unconscious in the ICU, then\nEx.PW1/B could not been dictated by her to PW1, who as per PW3, did\nnot even enter the ICU.\n\n54. Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A at the most show that the\nprosecutrix who had physical relations with the accused was upset and\ncommitted suicide as the accused was getting married. She has not stated\nthat the physical relations were not with her consent or that the accused\nhad promised to marry her and her consent for physical relations was\ntaken on a false pretext of marriage or misrepresentation of facts. The\npossibility of one sided love cannot be ruled out. If she had to put the\nblame on the accused for her suicide, she would have done it in her first\ntwo dying declarations, Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A. No criminal role is\nassigned to the accused in the first two dying declarations of the\nprosecutrix, Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A, and as such, he cannot be held\nliable for having committed any offence under \nsections 376\n and \n306\n of\nthe IPC on the basis of the same.\n\n55. It has already been discussed above that the evidence of PWs\n1 and 3 indicates that Ex.PW1/B is a fabricated and manipulated\ndocument and therefore no reliance can be placed on the same and no role\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 28 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 29 ::-\n\ncan be attributed to the accused in the suicide by the prosecutrix or the\nreason for the suicide. The prosecutions has failed to prove that the\naccused had raped and the prosecutrix and had abetted her suicide.\n\nFITNESS CERTIFICATE BEFORE DYING DECLARATION AND\nRECORDING BY SDM / MAGISTRATE\n\n56. The counsel for the accused has argued that Ex.PW1/B, the\nthird dying declaration of the prosecutrix, has been recorded without\ntaking the fitness certificate from the doctor and is recorded by the father\nof the prosecutrix and therefore, it cannot be relied upon.\n\n57. The Additional Public Prosecutor has argued that there is no\nprescribed manner of recording a dying declaration and any person can\nrecord it. It is only to be seen whether or not it is consistent, voluntary\nand in conscious and oriented condition.\n\n58. It is true that a dying declaration is not a deposition in Court\nand it is neither made on oath nor in the presence of the accused. It is,\ntherefore, not tested by cross examination on behalf of the accused. But a\ndying declaration is admitted in evidence by way of an exception to the\ngeneral rule against the admissibility of hearsay evidence, on the principle\nof necessity. The weak points of a dying declaration just mentioned\nmerely serve to put the Court on its guard while testing its reliability, by\nimposing on it an obligation to closely scrutinize all the relevant\ncircumstances.\n\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 29 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 30 ::-\n\n59. It has been observed by the hon'ble High Court of Delhi in a\nrecent case reported as \nJagbir Singh v. State\n, 2014 (1) JCC 172, that\n\"The law does not provide that a dying declaration should be made in\nany prescribed manner or in form of questions and answers; it may be\nin narrative form also, it is also not necessary that the dying declaration\nhas to be recorded by a Magistrate and non-recording of dying\ndeclaration by a Magistrate would not per se be a ground to disbelieve\nthe version of prosecution.\"\n\n60. Relying on the above mentioned judgment, it can be said that\nmerely because the father, PW1, has recorded the dying declaration,\nEx.PW1/B, it cannot be said that it is not believable.\n\n61. Further, regarding the non- obtaining of the fitness certificate\nfrom the doctor, the same also can be ignored provided a reasonable\nexplanation is given for the same and it is proved that the third dying\ndeclaration, Ex.PW1/B, was given voluntarily by the prosecutrix when\nshe was conscious and well oriented.\n\n62. On perusal of the record, it transpires that as per PW3, the\nmother of the prosecutrix, PW1, father of the prosecutrix, never went\ninside the ICU while their daughter was admitted in hospital. PWs 4, 7, 9,\n12 and 24 have deposed that she was unconscious. PW2 has also deposed\nthat she was not talking. PW1 has deposed that there was no doctor or\nhospital staff when he recorded Ex.PW1/B on the dictation of his\ndaughter and this deposition is not believable as the ICU is of RML\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 30 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 31 ::-\n\nHospital and it cannot be true that no hospital staff, doctor or nurse were\nthere.\n\n63. Neither PW 1 nor PW26 have deposed that the prosecutrix\nwas conscious, well oriented and had made Ex.PW1/B voluntarily. In fact\nPW1 has deposed that \"It is only when her condition deteriorated that\nshe made her statement.\" The satisfaction of the PW1 that the\nprosecutrix was fit to make her statement is not proved by the\nprosecution.\n\n64. Further, PW1 has deposed that \"At the time when she had\nmade her statement on 01.03.2011 the police official was not present\nbut he had instructed me to take down the statement in writing.\"\n\nHowever, who this police official was and whether or not it was PW26\nhas not been proved. Also PW26 has not made any such deposition of\ninstructing PW1 to record the statement of the prosecutrix i.e. Ex.PW1/B\non 01.03.2011.\n\n65. All the above facts show that although Ex.PW1/B has not\nbeen recorded by a Magistrate but the same does not vitiate the same.\nHowever, still it cannot be relied upon as the fitness of the prosecutrix to\ngive her statement has not been proved. Also, as already discussed above,\nas PW1 had not gone into the ICU, he could not have recorded\nEx.PW1/B.\n\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 31 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 32 ::-\n\nEVIDENCE OF COLLEAGUES OF THE PROSECUTRIX AND\nACCUSED\n\n66. The prosecution has examined the colleagues of the\nprosecutrix and the accused to prove its case. The prosecution has\nexamined Ms. Mona, friend of prosecturix, as PW4; Mr. Amit Kumar,\ncolleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW7; Mr. Raj Kumar\nSingh, colleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW9; Mr.Vicky,\ncolleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW12; Mr. Aji C.V,\ncolleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW13; and Mr. Manish\nKumar, colleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW24.\n\n67. As per the prosecution story, PW1, father of the prosecutrix,\nhad given four applications written by PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 (Ex.PW7/A,\nEx.PW9/A, Ex.PW12/A and Ex.PW24/A) on 04.03.2011, one day after\nthe death of the prosecutrix, to the IO, PW26. It was alleged on all the\nfour applications that the prosecutrix had an affair with the accused and\nthey were to marry but accused cheated her as he was to marry another\ngirl due to which the prosecutrix committed suicide.\n\n68. During evidence, PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 turned hostile and did\nnot support the prosecution case. They were cross examined at length by\nthe Additional Public Prosecutor but nothing material came forth. They\nhave infact deposed that they had given the applications at the instance of\nthe father of the prosecutrix as he was crying and pleading after her death\ndue to which they got emotional and wrote the applications They have\ndenied about the affair. They have even stated that they did not visit the\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 32 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 33 ::-\n\nprosecutrix in the ICU, as they were not permitted or she was\nunconscious, nor they talked to her. Here it may be mentioned that if the\nprosecutrix was unconscious in the ICU, then Ex.PW1/B could not been\ndictated by her to PW1, who as per PW3, did not even enter the ICU.\n\n69. PW4, Ms.Mona, friend of the prosecutrix has also turned\nhostile and has denied that the prosecutrix told her that she was going to\nmarry the accused. She had met the prosecutrix in the hospital but the\nprosecutrix was not in a position to speak to her and did not tell her\nanything. Nothing material came forth in her cross examination on behalf\nof the State.\n\n70. PW13 has only proved the certificate, Ex.PW13/A that the\nprosecutrix and the accused were the employees of the company during\nthe relevant period.\n\n71. It becomes clear from the evidence of PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 as\nwell as of PW4 that the version of the prosecution is untrustworthy and\nunbelievable.\n\nCONTRADICTIONS IN EVIDENCE\n\n72. Several contradictions in the testimonies of the parents of the\nprosecutrix, PWs 1 and 3, have already been discussed above and are not\nbeing repeated.\n\n73. There are some contradictions in the evidence of PW25 and\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 33 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 34 ::-\n\nPW26 regarding the signatures of the parents of the prosecutrix on\nEx.PW1/A, the vehicle of the prosecutrix, presence of the doctor and of\nPW25 at the time of recording Ex.PW1/A, signatures of PW25 on\nEx.PW1/A, keeping of seal by the IO after use, etc. which are too\nmaterial to be ignored as they strike the very root of the prosecution case\nand also give a shattering blow to the prosecution story.\n\n74. There are also some contradictions between the evidence of\nPW1 and PW2 regarding the knowledge about the affair of the\nprosecutrix with the accused as PW1 has denied the same while PW2 has\ndeposed that he had come to know about the same from his children that\nshe had an affair with a boy, whose name he did not know. PW1 has\ndeposed that neither he nor his wife, PW3, had discussed about marriage\nwith the prosecutrix nor she had informed him her choice. As per PW1,\nthe prosecutrix was talking while PW2 has deposed that she did not utter\na word in his presence although he was with her for 15/20 minutes.\n\n75. PW2 has also deposed that the site plan was not prepared in\nhis presence by the IO or any other police official which is contradiction\nto the evidence of PW26.\n\n76. All the above mentioned overwhelming contradictions and\ninconsistencies give a shattering blow to the case. These blemishes are\ntoo major to be ignored and strike at the root of the prosecution case.\n\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 34 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 35 ::-\n\nCASE PROPERTY IN TORN CONDITION\n\n77. The case property i.e. two bottles, Ex.P1 collectively,\numbrella, Ex.P2 and match box with match sticks, Ex.P3 were produced\nin the Court in torn condition and some of the seals were also torn and\nbroken. These articles are also easily available in the market, as per PW2\nin whose presence the same were seized.\n\n78. The above facts throw a shadow of doubt on the prosecution\nversion and the possibility of false implication of the accused cannot be\ncompletely ruled out.\n\nMENS REA / MOTIVE\n\n79. Regarding the motive of crime, it may be observed that in a\ncase based on circumstantial evidence, the existence of motive assumed\nsignificance though the absence of motive does not necessarily discredit\nthe prosecution case, if the case stands otherwise established by other\nconclusive circumstances and the chain of circumstantial evidence is so\ncomplete and is consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the\naccused and inconsistent with the hypothesis of his innocence.\n\n80. The motive has to be gathered from the surrounding\ncircumstances and such evidence should from one of the links to the\nchain of circumstantial evidence. The proof of motive would only\nstrengthen the prosecution case and fortify the Court in its ultimate\nconclusion but in the absence of any connecting evidence or link which\nwould be sufficient in itself from the face of it, the accused cannot be\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 35 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 36 ::-\n\nconvicted. Motives of men are often subjective, submerged and\nunnameable to easy proof that courts have to go without clear evidence\nthereon if other clinching evidence exists. A motive is indicated to\nheighten the probability that the offence was committed by the person\nwho was impelled by the motive but if the crime is alleged to have been\ncommitted for a particular motive, it is relevant to inquire whether the\npattern of the crime fits in which the alleged motive.\n\n81. In the present case there is sufficient evidence on record to\nshow that the accused did not have a motive to commit the offence. A\nwitness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs\nfrom sources which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless\nthe witness has cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to\nimplicate him falsely. Ordinarily a close relation would be the last to\nscreen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true,\nwhen feelings run high and there is personal cause for enmity, that there\nis a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a\ngrudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a\ncriticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is\noften a sure guarantee of truth. However, there can be no sweeping\ngeneralization. Each case must be judged on its own facts. These\nobservations are only made to combat what is so often put forward in\ncases as a general rule of prudence. There is no such general rule. Each\ncase must be limited to and be governed by its own facts.\n\n82. In the present case, a story has been projected that the accused\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 36 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 37 ::-\n\nhas raped the prosecutrix and abetted her suicide and this version appears\nto be untrue as there is no reason why he would do so. There is nothing\non the record to show that the accused has committed the offence, as\nalleged by the prosecution.\n\n83. There does not appear to be any criminal intention and\nmens rea on the part of the accused.\n\nDEFENCE OF THE ACCUSED\n\n84. In his statement under \nsection 313\n of the Cr.P.C., the accused has\nstated that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this case by\nthe prosecutrix. He has admitted that he and the prosecutrix were working\nin the same office. He did not know anything regarding why the\nprosecutrix tried to end her life. He came to know later on that she used to\nlike him and on objections from her parents, she took the extreme step of\ntrying to end her life. This was a very unfortunate incident in which he\nhad no part to play. Although they were good friends and colleagues, they\nnever went out alone and were always surrounded by other friends and\ncolleagues.\n\n85. The defence of the accused appears to be plausible considering\nthe unreliable evidence of the prosecution which suffers from\noverwhelming contradictions and glaring inconsistencies.\n\n86. However, the prosecution has to stand of its own legs and is\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 37 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 38 ::-\n\nrequired to prove all its allegations against the accused and all the\ningredients of the offence alleged to have been committed by the accused.\n\n87. It has already been discussed above that the evidence of\nprosecution is not reliable and is unworthy of credence. Therefore, the\ndefence of the accused appears to be plausible.\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\n88. The investigation conducted in the present case has been\ndeposed by PWs 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 26. PW26 is the\nIO of the case. The MLCs of the prosecutrix and the accused have been\nproved by PWs 15, 17 and 29. The post mortem report of the prosecutrix,\nEx.PW16/A, has been proved by PW16. The FSL reports have been\nproved by PW27 28. The FIR has been proved by PW14. The CDRs\nhave been proved by PW8.\n\n89. The investigation conducted including the documents prepared\nin the present case has been substantially proved by the police witnesses\nincluding the IO. They have deposed on the lines of the prosecution case.\n\n90. It is the actual crime which is important than the investigation.\nWhere the actual crime is being elaborated and proved in the evidence of\nthe prosecutrix, then the investigation becomes less important.\n\n91. There are two stages in the criminal prosecution. The first\nobviously is the commission of the crime and the second is the\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 38 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 39 ::-\n\ninvestigation conducted regarding the same. In case the investigation is\nfaulty or it has not been proved in evidence at trial, does it absolve the\nliability of the culprit who has committed the offence? The answer is\nlogically in the negative as any lapse on the part of the investigation does\nnot negate the offence.\n\n92. However, it can be seen from the record that the\ninvestigation has not been conducted properly, fairly and impartially. In\nfact this is a case of complete dereliction of duties and deviation from all\nrules of prudence and law by the IO. This was a case where the\ninvestigation should have been conducted with great responsibility as a\nhuman life has been lost and the accused, in the event of conviction,\nwould have received a severe sentence. The (mis) conduct of the IO is\ndeplorable.\n\n93. The reason for the suicide of the prosecutrix has not been\ninvestigated properly by the IO. The IO did not make the doctor remain\nwith the prosecutrix and join the investigation while he recorded\nEx.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A. He did not seek the permission of the doctor\nto lower the bandage on the thumb of the prosecutrix before taking her\nthumb impression on the first two statements. He did not even ask the\ndoctor to remove or lower her bandage. He did not even ask any doctor or\nnurse to counter sign on them.\n\n94. The IO has deposed in his cross examination that \"the\nprosecutrix had mentioned about her physical relations with the\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 39 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 40 ::-\n\naccused in her second statement but I felt that she was not telling the\ncomplete truth.\" However, still the IO has preferred not to conduct any\ninvestigation despite forming the opinion that the prosecurix was not\ntelling the complete truth.\n\n95. The IO had retained the seal after seizing the articles from\nthe spot of incident (as is deposed by PW25) and no explanation is\ncoming forth from the prosecution regarding the same.\n\n96. It is shocking to note that the IO failed to go inside the ICU\nof RML Hospital on 01.03.2011 despite going there on receipt of a\ntelephonic call from the father of the prosecutrix where he was handed\nover Ex.PW1/B. He failed to go to the prosecutrix between 01.03.2011\ntill 03.03.2011 evening, till she was alive. He failed to verify the\ngenuineness of Ex.PW1/B from the prosecutrix and whether or not she\nhad actually dictated the contents of the same to her father. He even failed\nto examine any doctor to ascertain her medical condition and fitness for\ngiving Ex.PW1/B. He even did not care to read Ex.PW1/B at the\nhospital. Even receiving Ex.PW7/A, Ex.PW9/A, Ex.PW12/A and\nEx.PW24/A (applications from the colleagues of the prosecutrix and the\naccused) on 04.03.2011 from PW1, the father of the prosecutrix, the IO\ndid not record their statements or make investigation from them till\n28.05.2011, 06.06.2011 and 23.06.2011. The IO did not care too issue any\nnotice to PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 to join the investigation when he had not\nmet them in the office. No explanation is furnished for the same.\n\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 40 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 41 ::-\n\n97. He also did not deem it appropriate to call the Magistrate or\nSDM for recording the statement/ dying declaration of the prosecutrix, as\nper the convention and practice while she was alive between 24.02.2011\nand 03.03.2011. The IO has deposed that \"I did not find it necessary to\ncall SDM for the purpose of recording the statement.\" He also failed to\ncall any senior officer for the said purpose. Neither the IO nor the\nprosecution has been able to give any explanation for the same.\n\n98. The explanation given by the IO, in his cross examination is\nthat \"I did not meet prosecutrix on 01.03.2011 as I had to go to the PS\nsince I was on duty....... I was busy doing investigation in other cases\nand also as I could not meet them since they (PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24) were\nbusy in their official work\". He has not furnished any explanation as to\nwhy after receiving Ex.PW1/B on 01.03.2011, he did not meet the\nprosecutrix till she was alive i.e. till 03.03.2011.\n\n99. Although it is alleged that on the night of 24.02.2011 before\nthe suicide, a message was sent from the mobile phone used by the\nprosecutrix to the mobile phone of the accused but no voice recording\nwas obtained by the IO during investigation. Even the transcript of the\nmessage was neither produced nor proved. The records produced by PW8\nshow that the message was received on the next day, after the suicide was\nattempted by the prosecutrix and as such the accused could not have done\nanything to stop her from making such an attempt. Even otherwise, the\nprosecution has failed to prove that the particular numbers (as mentioned\nabove) were used by the prosecutrix and the accused.\n\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 41 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 42 ::-\n\n100. The IO did not even care to record the statements of parents of\nthe prosecutrix before and after her death immediately. He admittedly\nrecorded the statement of PW3, mother of the prosecutrix, on 03.05.2011\ni.e. after two months of the demise of the prosecutrix and the statement of\nPW1, father of the prosecutrix, on 05.05.2011 i.e. after more than two\nmonths of her demise. The explanation given by the IO is that \"...I was\nbusy in investigation of other cases\".\n\n101. The IO did not take any opinion regarding the handwriting on\nEx.PW1/B (although the same is not disputed by the accused). No\nexplanation is furnished for the same.\n\n102. The IO did not issue any notice to the accused or his office\nprior to 23.06.2011 for his appearance before him despite this being a\ncase of very heinous offences of rape and abetment to suicide.\n\n103. The IO also did not verify the records of the mobile phones of\nthe prosecutrix and the accused. The records of mobile phone numbers\n9811533558 and 9953622645 which are in the names of Gurpreet Singh\nand Deepak were produced by PW8. It is clear that the IO has not made\nany verification regarding these two mobile phone numbers. Although in\ninformation given by Mr.Satish Jain (Ex.PW26/M and Ex.PW26/N), the\nmobile numbers of the prosecutrix and the accused are mentioned but the\nIO has not made Mr.Satish Jain a witness in the case nor the prosecution\nhas examined him. The IO has failed to make any investigation regarding\nthe mobile phone number of the accused, despite the stand of the\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 42 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 43 ::-\n\nprosecution being that the prosecutrix had sent a message to him that she\nwas going to commit suicide.\n\n104. The prosecution has also failed to make Ms.Dimple a witness\nor produce and examine her despite her being a material witness who\ncould have deposed about the present case.\n\n105. The prosecution has also failed to make Mr.Sunil Bhatia,\nManager in the company where the prosecutrix and the accused worked, a\nwitness or produce and examine him despite her being a material witness\nwho could have deposed about the present case.\n\n106. It appears that a very casual approach rather a negligent\napproach has been taken by the IO for investigation in this case which\nwas required to be investigated with great responsibility and sincerity.\n\n107. It is clear that from the investigation or in fact lack of\ninvestigation, the version of the prosecution appears to be unreliable and\nuntrustworthy.\n\nFINAL CONCLUSION\n\n108.

State of\nMaharastra, AIR 1984 SC 1622, the Apex Court has laid down the tests\nwhich are prerequisites before conviction should be recorded, which are\nas under:\n\n 1.

The circumstances concerned\n 'must or should' and not 'may be' established;\n\n 2. The facts so established should be consistent onlywith the\n hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should\n not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused\n is guilty;\n\n 3. The circumstances should be of conclusive nature and\n tendency;\n\n 4. They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to\n be proved; and\n\n 5. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave\n any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the\n innocence of the accused and must show that in all human\n probability the act must have been done by the accused.\n\n109. Applying the above principles of law to the facts of present\ncase, it stands established that the accused had not raped the prosecutrix\nnor abetted her suicide. There is no incriminating evidence against the\naccused. The gaps in the prosecution evidence, the several discrepancies\nin the evidence and other circumstances make it highly improbable that\nsuch an incident ever took place.\n\n110. This was a case which rested mainly on the third dying\ndeclaration of the prosecutrix, Ex.PW1/B, the genuineness, authenticity\nand veracity of the same has not been proved by the prosecution,\nprimarily due to the negligence and failure of the IO to investigate\nproperly.\n\n111. When the dying declaration of the prosecutrix has not been\nproved by the prosecution, the reason for her suicide i.e. rape by accused\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 44 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 45 ::-\n\nalso remains unproved. The prosecution has miserably failed to prove that\nsometime during period of four years prior to 23.02.2011, the accused had\nraped the deceased prosecutrix at his house 1/36, Press Colony, Rajouri\nGarden, Delhi and he had instigated and abetted her to commit suicide\nwhich she attempted by firstly drinking acid and then pouring petrol on\nher and setting herself on fire in her house and subsequently expired on\n03.03.2011. The role of the accused in the suicide of the prosecutrix has\nnot been proved by the prosecution.\n\n112. Consequently, no inference can be drawn that the accused is\nguilty of the charged offences as the testimony of the prosecution\nwitnesses is unreliable and unworthy of credence.\n\n113. Onus is always on the prosecution to prove and accused is\nentitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt. Case of the prosecution is to\nbe proved beyond reasonable doubt and cannot take support from\nweakness of case of defence. In case the evidence is read in totality and\nstory projected by the prosecution is found to be improbable, prosecution\ncase becomes liable to be rejected.\n\n114. If the prosecution evidence is read and considered in totality of\ncircumstances along with other material on record, in which offence is\nalleged to have been committed, the deposition does not inspire\nconfidence and is unreliable and unworthy of credence and in the absence\nof special circumstances, no conviction can be based on such evidence.\n\nProsecution has not disclosed true genesis of crime.\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 45 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 46 ::-\n\n115. It is a case of heinous crime of rape and abetment of suicide,\nwhich carries grave implication for the accused, if convicted. Therefore,\nfor convicting any person for the said offence, the degree of proof has to\nbe that of a high standard and not mere possibility of committing the said\noffence. In a criminal case, the prosecution has to prove its case beyond\nreasonable doubt against the accused. The prosecution story does not\ninspire confidence and is not worthy of credence. The gaps in the\nprosecution evidence, the several discrepancies in the evidence and other\ncircumstances make it highly improbable that such an incident ever took\nplace.\n\n116. All the above facts indicate that there is no veracity in the\nprosecution case in respect of the offence of rape and abetment of\nsuicide of the prosecutrix and the accused merits to be acquitted for\nthe offence under \nsections 306\n and \n376\n of the IPC.\n\n117. Therefore, in view of above discussion, the conscience of this\nCourt is completely satisfied that the prosecution has failed to bring home\nthe charge against the accused Mr.Venktanjaneya Pratap Singh.\n\n118. Accordingly, Mr.Venktanjaneya Pratap Singh, the\naccused, is hereby acquitted of the charges for the offence punishable\nunder \nsections 376\n and \n306\n of the IPC.\n\nSessions Case Number : 69 of 2013.\n\nUnique Case ID Number : 02401R044082011.\n\nFIR No. 57/11, Police Station Hari Nagar,\nUnder \nsections 376\n/\n306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nState versus Venktanjaneya Partap Singh. -:: Page 46 of 47 ::-\n\n -:: 47 ::-\n\nCOMPLAINCE OF SECTION 437-AOF THE CR.P.C.\n\n119.
