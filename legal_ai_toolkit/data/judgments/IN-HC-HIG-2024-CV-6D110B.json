Further, a writ of\n\nmandamus has been sought to direct the respondents to decide afresh\n\nthe claim of the petitioner and to count the ad hoc service rendered by\n\nhim as Sub Divisional Engineer for the grant of time scale, seniority\n\nand other consequential benefits.\n\n2. The brief facts, as have been pleaded in the petition, are\n\nthat the petitioner joined the respondent-depart\nrespondent department as Junior Engineer\n\nin the year 1970 and thereafter vide order dated 27.11.1998\n27.11.1998, he was\n\npromoted as Sub Divisional Engineer on stop\nstop-gap arrangement for a\n\nperiod of six months, subject to the approval of the Haryana Public\n\nService Commission. The said ad hoc promotion was treated as regular\n\nw.e.f. 01.01.2005 and thereafter the petitio\npetitioner retired from service on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation on 30.11.2006 as SDE (Civil).\n\nAfter eight years of his retirement, petitioner submitted representations\n\ndated 13.11.2014,\n13.11.201 18.01.2015 followed by legal notice dated\n\n23.02.2015 and representation\nrepresentation dated 07.11.2016, claiming counting of\n\nhis ad hoc service from 01.12.1998 to 31.12.2004 for all benefits such\n\nas next scale after five years of service and other retirement benefits\n\nand seniority. The said claim was considered and rejected by the\n\nrespondents\nndents, vide order dated 22.05.2015\n.05.2015 (Annexure P\nP-4), which has\n\nbeen impugned in the present petition.\n\n3.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the ad\n\nhoc service rendered by the petitioner is liable to be counted for the\n\npurpose of grant of time scale and seniority in view of the law laid\n\ndown by this Court in CWP No.8604 of 2007 - Dr. Surinder Kumar\n\nMishra and others v. State of Haryana and others - decided on\n\n09.09.2010,, which has been upheld in\nLPA No.886 of 2011 - State of\n\nHaryana and others v. Surinder\nSurinder Kumar Mishra and others\n- decided\n\non 13.10.2011.\n\n13.10.2011\n\n5. Per contra, learned State counsel has argued that present\n\npetition is liable\nliable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches. He\n\nfurther submitted that even on merits also, the ad hoc service rendered\n\nby the petitioner cannot be counted for the purpose of grant of time\n\nscale and seniority.\n\n6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\n\nthe record.\n\n7. The issues which arise in the present petition are as to\n\nwhether the instant petition filed by the petitioner\npetitioner, after a considerable\n\ndelay, is liable to be dismissed on account of delay and laches and\n\nwhether the ad hoc service rendered by the petitioner from 01.12.1998\n\nto 31.12.2004 can be counted for the grant of time scale and seniority\nseniority.\n\n8. The facts are not in dispute that the petitioner joined the\n\nservice as Junior Engineer in the year 19700 and was promoted as Sub\n\nDivisional Engineer on stop-gap\nstop gap arrangement\narrangement, vide order dated\n\n27.11.1998,, and the said ad hoc arrangement\narrangement, was made regular w.e.f.\n\n01.01.2005\n5 and the petitioner retired from service on attaining the age\n\n3 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nof superannuation on 30.11.2006 and submitted representation for the\n\nfirst time on 13.11.2014 i.e. after eight years of his retirement.\n\n9. Admittedly, there is gross, inordinate and unexplained\n\ndelay of twelve years in filing the present writ petition for redressal of\n\nhis grievance.\n\ngrievance\n\n10. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in \"\nYunus (Baboobhai) A\n\nHamid Padvekar vs State of Maharashtra Through\nits Secretary and\n\nothers\",, 2009(2) SCT 24,\n24, while referring to the issue of delay and\n\nlatches, had held as follows:-\n\nfollows:\n\n\"8.\n\n8. Delay or laches is one of the factors which is to\nbe borne in mind by the High Courts when they exercise\ntheir discretionary powers under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India, 1950 (in short the 'Constitution'). In\nan appropriate case the High Court may refuse to invoke\nits extraordinary powers if there is such negligence or\nomission on the part of the applicant to assert his right as\ntaken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other\ncircumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party.\nEven where\nre fundamental right is involved the matter is still\nwithin the discretion of the Court as pointed out in\nDurga\nPrasad v. Chief Controller of Imports and Exports\n(AIR\n1970 SC 769).. Of course, the discretion has to be\nexercised judicially and reasonably.\n\n9.. What was stated in this regard by Sir Barnes\nPeacock in Lindsay Petroleum Company v. Prosper\nArmstrong Hurde etc.\n(1874) 5 PC 221 at page 239 was\napproved by this Court in\nMoon Mills Ltd. v. Industrial\nCourts\n(AIR 1967 SC 1450) and Maharashtra State\nTransport\nsport Corporation v. Balwant Regular Motor Service\n(AIR 1969 SC 329),, Sir Barnes had stated:\n\n4 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n\"Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of\nEquity is not an arbitrary or technical doctrine.\nWhere it would be practically unjust to give a\nremedy either because the party has, by his conduct\ndone that which might fairly be regarded as\nequivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct\nand neglect he has though perhaps not waiving that\nremedy, yet put the other party in a situation in\nwhich it would not be reaso\nreasonable to place him if the\nremedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of\nthese cases, lapse of time and delay are most\nmaterial. But in every case, if an argument against\nrelief, which otherwise would be just, if founded\nupon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting\nto a bar by any statute of limitation, the validity of\nthat defence must be tried upon principles\nsubstantially equitable. Two circumstances always\nimportant in such cases are, the length of the delay\nand the nature of the acts done dduring the interval\nwhich might affect either party and cause a balance\nof justice or injustice in taking the one course or the\nother, so far as relates to the remedy.\"\n\n10. It would be appropriate to note certain decisions\nof this Court in which this aspec\naspect has been dealt with in\nrelation with\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution. It is apparent\nthat what has been stated as regards that Article would\napply, a fortiori, to\nArticle 226.\nIt was observed in R.N\nBose v. Union of India (AIR 1970 SC 470) that no relief\ncan be given to the petitioner who without any reasonable\nexplanation approaches this Court under\nArticle 32\nafter\ninordinate delay. It was stated that though\nArticle 32\nis\nitself a guaranteed right, it does not follow from this that it\nwas the intention off the Constitution makers that this\nCourt should disregard all principles and grant relief in\npetitions filed after inordinate delay.\n\n11. It was stated in\nState of M.P. v. Nandlal\n(AIR\n1987 SC 251) that the High Court in exercise of its\ndiscretion does nott ordinarily assist the tardy and the\n\n5 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nindolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic. If there is\ninordinate delay on the part of the petitioner and such\ndelay is not satisfactorily explained, the High Court may\ndecline to intervene and grant relief in exer\nexercise of its writ\njurisdiction. It was stated that this rule is premised on a\nnumber of factors. The High Court does not ordinarily\npermit a belated resort to the extraordinary remedy\nbecause it is likely to cause confusion and public\ninconvenience and bringg in its trail new injustices, and if\nwrit jurisdiction is exercised after unreasonable delay, it\nmay have the effect of inflicting not only hardship and\ninconvenience but also injustice on third parties. It was\npointed out that when writ jurisdiction is iinvoked,\nunexplained delay coupled with the creation of third party\nrights in the meantime is an important factor which also\nweighs with the High Court in deciding whether or not to\nexercise such jurisdiction.\n\n12. In view of the aforesaid position we are nnot\ninclined to interfere in this appeal which is dismissed\naccordingly.\"\n\n11. Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nState of\n\nUttaranchal and another v. Sri Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari and\n\nothers\n, 2013(6) SLR 629,\n629, while considering the issue regarding delay\n\nand\nnd laches and referring to earlier judgments on the issue, opined that\n\nrepeated representations made will not keep the issues alive. A stale or\n\na dead issue/dispute cannot be revived even if such a representation has\n\nbeen decided either by the authority or by getting a direction from the\n\ncourt as the issue regarding delay and laches is to be decided with\n\nreference to original cause of action and not with reference to any such\n\norder passed. Delay and laches on the part of a government servant may\n\n6 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\ndeprive him of the benefit which had been given to others.\nArticle 14\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India, in a situation of that nature, will not be\n\nattracted as it is well known that law leans in favour of those who are\n\nalert and vigilant. Even equality has to be claimed at the right juncture\n\nand not on expiry of reasonable time. Even if there is no period\n\nprescribed for filing the writ petition under\nArticle 226\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, yet it should be filed within a reasonable time. An\n\norder promoting a junior should\nshould normally be challenged within a period\n\nof six months or at the most in a year of such promotion. Though it is\n\nnot a strict rule, the courts can always interfere even subsequent thereto,\n\nbut relief to a person, who allows things to happen and then approa\napproach\n\nthe court and puts forward a stale claim and try to unsettle settled\n\nmatters, can certainly be refused on account of delay and laches.\n\nAnyone who sleeps over his rights is bound to suffer. An employee who\n\nsleeps like Rip Van Winkle and got up from slumb\nslumber at his own leisure,\n\ndeserves to be denied the relief on account of delay and laches.\n\nRelevant paragraphs from the aforesaid judgment are extracted below:\n\n\"13. We have no trace of doubt that the respondents could\nhave challenged the ad hoc promotion conf\nconferred on the\njunior employee at the relevant time. They chose not to do\nso for six years and the junior employee held the\npromotional post for six years till regular promotion took\nplace. The submission of the learned counsel for the\nrespondents is that they\ney had given representations at the\nrelevant time but the same fell in deaf ears. It is interesting\nto note that when the regular selection took place, they\naccepted the position solely because the seniority was\nmaintained and, thereafter, they knocked at the doors of\n\n7 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nthe tribunal only in 2003. It is clear as noon day that the\ncause of action had arisen for assailing the order when the\njunior employee was promoted on ad hoc basis on\n15.11.1983.\nIn\nC. Jacob v. Director of Geology and\nMining and another\n, (2008) 10 SCC 115\n115, a two-Judge\nBench was dealing with the concept of representations and\nthe directions issued by the court or tribunal to consider\nthe representations and the challenge to the said rejection\nthereafter. In that context, the court has expre\nexpressed thus:-\n\n\"Every representation to the Government for\nrelief, may not be replied on merits. Representations\nrelating to matters which have become stale or\nbarred by limitation, can be rejected on that ground\nalone, without examining the merits of the cl\nclaim. In\nregard to representations unrelated to the\nDepartment, the reply may be only to inform that the\nmatter did not concern the Department or to inform\nthe appropriate Department. Representations with\nincomplete particulars may be replied by seeking\nrelevant\nevant particulars. The replies to such\nrepresentations, cannot furnish a fresh cause of\naction or revive a stale or dead claim.\"\n\n14. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n\n15. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n\n16.

Ghan\nGhanshyam\nDass\n(2) and others, (2011) 4 SCC 374\n374, a three-Judge\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the\nprinciple stated in\nJagdish Lal v. State of Haryana\n, (1997)\n6 SCC 538 and proceeded to observe that as the\nrespondents therein preferred to sleep oover their rights and\napproached the tribunal in 1997, they would not get the\nbenefit of the order dated 7.7.1992.\n\n18.\nIn\nState of T.

Delay or laches is a\nrelevant factor for a court of law to determine the\nquestion as to whether the claim made by an\napplicant deserves consideration. Delay and/or\nlaches on the part of a government servant may\ndeprive him of the benefit which had been given to\nothers.\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India would\nnot, in a situation of that nature, be attracted as it is\nwell known that law leans in favour of those who\nare alert and vigilant.\"\n\n19. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n\n20.\nIn\nNew Delhi Municipal Council v. Pan Singh and\nothers\n, (2007) 9 SCC 278,, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\nopined that though there is no period of llimitation\nprovided for filing a writ petition under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India, yet ordinarily a writ petition should\nbe filed within a reasonable time. In the said case the\nrespondents had filed the writ petition after seventeen\nyears and thee court, as stated earlier, took note of the\ndelay and laches as relevant factors and set aside the\norder passed by the High Court which had exercised the\ndiscretionary jurisdiction.\n\n12.\nIn a recent judgment by the Division Bench of this Court\n\nin \"\nRam Kumar\nKumar vs State of Haryana and others\n\", 2022 (3) SCT 346,\n\nwhile rejecting the claim of the petitioner for counting of his ad hoc\n\nservice, for the purpose of seniority/pension and regularization in\n\nservice on completion of 02 years as per policy, held that the petition\n\nfiled by him suffered from gross, inordinate and unexplained delay in\n\n9 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\napproaching the High Court. In\nthe said judgment\n, it has been held as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"10. What we wish to emphasize, in particular, is that\nservices of the appellant were regularized w\nw.e.f.\n\n01.04.1997. And, he was assigned a specific seniority\nposition in the cadre. Whereafter, he continued to serve the\ndepartment for nearly twenty five years, before attaining\nthe age of superannuation in January, 2022. Needless to\nassert that during alll these years, he availed all admissible\nbenefits, promotions, and retired as Inspector. Thus, it\nrather appears that institution of the petition by the\nappellant was speculative and an attempt to resurrect a\nstale and dead claim. The Supreme Court, in\nNew Delhi\nMunicipal Council v. Pan Singh & Ors.\n, 2007(9) SCC\n278, observed:\n\n\"15. There is another aspect of the matter\nwhich cannot be lost sight of. Respondents herein\nfiled a Writ Petition after 17 years. They did not\nagitate their grievances for a long ti\ntime. They, as\nnoticed herein, did not claim parity with the 17\nworkmen at the earliest possible opportunity. They\ndid not implead themselves as parties even in the\nreference made by the State before the Industrial\nTribunal. It is not their case that after 11982, those\nemployees who were employed or who were\nrecruited after the cut-off\noff date have been granted\nthe said scale of pay.\nAfter such a long time,\ntherefore, the Writ Petitions could not have been\nentertained even if they are similarly situated. It is\ntrite\nite that the discretionary jurisdiction may not be\nexercised in favour of those who approach the Court\nafter a long time. Delay and laches are relevant\nfactors for exercise of equitable jurisdiction.

State of\nHaryana & Ors., (1997) 6 SCC 538\n538, it was held by the\nSupreme Court:\n\n\"That apart, as this Court has repeatedly\nheld, the delay disentitles the party to the\ndiscretionary relief under\nArticle 226\nor 32 of the\nConstitution. It is not necessar\nnecessary to reiterate all\ncatena of precedents in this behalf.

Therefore\nTherefore, desperate attempts of\nthe appellants to re-do\ndo the seniority had by them in\nvarious cadres/grades though in the same services\naccording to 1974 Rules or 1980 Rule, are not\namenable to judicial review at this belated stage....\"\n\n12. In the wake of the position as sketched out above,\nwe are dissuaded to interfere with the impugned order and\njudgment rendered by the learned single Judge. The\nappeal being bereft of merit is, accordingly, dismissed.\"\n\n13. The Co-ordinate\nordinate Bench of this Court in \"\nPrem Nath and\n\nothers vs State of Punjab and others\n\", 2018(2) SCT 687, while\n\nrejecting the claim of additional increments of acquisition of higher\n\nqualifications has held as under:-\n\nunder:\n\n\"3. It is the case set up on behalf of the petitioners\nthat they had all been appointe\nappointed before 19.02.1979 and\n\n11 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nhad even improved/acquired higher qualifications before\n19.02.1979 and as such there would be no difference\nbetween the employees working with the Punjab\nGovernment, holding corresponding post and the\nemployees like the petitioners who have worked for\nPunjab Privately Managed Recognised Aided Schools. It is\nalso the assertion made by counsel representing the\npetitioners that their claim would be covered in terms of\ndecision dated 02.07.2013 rendered by this Court in a\nbunch of writ petitions\netitions including CWP No.8083 of 1989\ntitled as\nRadha Krishan Narang and others vs. State of\nPunjab and others\n.\n\n4. Having heard counsel for the petitioners at length,\nthis Court is of the considered view that the claim of the\npetitioners would not requiree any consideration on merits\nand the writ petition deserves to be dismissed on the sole\nground of delay and laches.\n\n5. Placed on record and appended at Annexure P\nP-1\nare the particulars of the petitioners. The tabulation at\nAnnexure P-11 would show that all the petitioners stand\nretired on various dates between the years 1995 to 2012.\nOut of 32 petitioners in all, 22 petitioners superannuated\nmore than 10 years back.\n\n6. There is no justification coming forth as regards\nthe inordinate delay in having appr\napproached the Writ Court.\n\nThere is also no explanation put forth by the petitioners as\nto why the claim raised in the instant petition was not\nagitated by the petitioners while they were in service. The\nentire thrust of the submissions advanced by counsel is\nthat similarly situated employees had approached this\nCourt and have been granted relief.\n\n7. The issue regarding delay in invoking the\nextraordinary writ jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India was considered by the Hon'ble\n\n12 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nSupreme Court in\nChairman, U.P. Jal Nigam and another\nv. Jaswant Singh and another\n(2006)11 SCC 464\n\n464. In such\ncase, certain employees raised the issue that they were not\nliable to be retired at the age of 58 years but should be\npermitted to continue in service till th\nthey attain the age of\n60 years. Such employees were still in service when the\nwrit petitions were filed. The writ petitions were ultimately\nallowed. Placing reliance upon such judgment, some of the\nemployees, who had already superannuated, filed writ\npetitions\nons seeking the same benefit. Even such petitions\nwere allowed by the High Court in terms of following the\nearlier judgment. The judgment of the High Court was\nchallenged before the Apex Court and wherein while\nreferring to earlier judgments in\nRup Diamonds v. Union\nof India\n, (1989)2 SCC 356; \"\nJagdish Lal v. State of\nHaryana\n, (\n1997)6 SCC 538 and Government of West\nBengal v. Tarun K. Roy\n, (2004)1 SCC 347\n347, it was opined\nthat persons who approached the Court at a belated stage\nplacing reliance upon the order ppassed in some other case\nearlier, can be denied the discretionary relief on the\nground of delay and laches. The relevant observations\nmade by the Supreme Court are contained in Paras 5, 6\nand 16 of the judgment and are extracted here under:\n\nunder:-\n\n\"5. So far as the principal issue is\nconcerned, that has been settled by this court.\nTherefore, there is no quarrel over the legal\nproposition. But the only question is grant of\nrelief to such other persons who were not\nvigilant and did not wake up to challenge\ntheir retirement\netirement and accepted the same but\nfiled writ petitions after the judgment of this\ncourt in\nHarwindra Kumar v. Chief\nEngineer, Karmik\n, (2005) 13 SCC 300 300.\nWhether they are entitled to same relief or not?\nTherefore, a serious question that arises for\nconsideration\neration is whether the employees who\ndid not wake up to challenge their retirement\n\n13 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nand accepted the same, collected their post post-\nretirement benefits, can such persons be given\nthe relief in the light of the subsequent\ndecision delivered by this court?\n\n6. Thee question of delay and laches has\nbeen examined by this court in a series of\ndecisions and laches and delay has been\nconsidered to be an important factor in\nexercise of the discretionary relief under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution. When a\nperson who is not ot vigilant of his rights and\nacquiesces with the situation, can his writ\npetition be heard after a couple of years on\nthe ground that same relief should be granted\nto him as was granted to person similarly\nsituated who was vigilant about his rights and\nchallenged\nallenged his retirement which was said to\nbe made on attaining the age of 58 years. A\nchart has been supplied to us in which it has\nbeen pointed out that about 9 writ petitions\nwere filed by the employees of the Nigam\nbefore their retirement wherein their\nretirement was somewhere between 30.6.2005\nand 31.7.2005. Two writ petitions were filed\nwherein no relief of interim order was passed.\nThey were granted interim order. Thereafter a\nspate of writ petitions followed in which\nemployees who retired in the year years 2001,\n2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, woke up to file\nwrit petitions in 2005 and 2006 much after\ntheir retirement. Whether such persons should\nbe granted the same relief or not?\n\nxx xx xx\n\n16. Therefore, in case at this belated stage if\nsimilar relief is to be given to the persons who\nhave not approached the court that will\nunnecessarily overburden the Nigam and the\nNigam will completely collapse with the\nliability of payment to these persons in terms\nof two years' salary and increased benefit of\npension and other her consequential benefits.\nTherefore, we are not inclined to grant any\nrelief to the persons who have approached the\ncourt after their retirement. Only those\n\n14 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\npersons who have filed the writ petitions\nwhen they were in service or who have\nobtained interim order for their retirement,\nthose persons should be allowed to stand to\nbenefit and not others.\"\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n8. The issue of delay was also dealt with by this\nCourt in\nTarsem Pal vs. Punjab State Power Corporation\nLimited and others\n, 2013 (3) SLR 314.\n\nIn the case of\n\nTarsem Pal\n(supra), the petitioner was serving as a Clerk\nwith the respondent-Corporation\nCorporation and had retired on\n31.03.2005. Claim in the writ petition was to grant to him\nthe benefit of proficiency set up in the pay scale on\ncompletion of 23 years of service from the due date as per\npolicy of the Corporation. During the service career, he\nhad not agitated the claim for increments. For the first\ntime, such claim had been made on 28.02.2005 i.e. just\none month prior to superannuation. While nnon-suiting the\npetitioner on account of delay and laches it was held as\nfollows:-\n\n\"11. In the aforesaid judgments, it has\nbeen clearly laid down that discretionary\nrelief in a writ jurisdiction is available to a\nparty who is alive of his rights and enforc\nenforces\nthe same in court within reasonable time. The\njudgment in another case does not give a\ncause of action to file a writ petition at a\nbelated stage seeking the same relief. Such\npetitions can be dismissed on account of\ndelay and laches. As has already bee\nbeen noticed\nabove in the present case as well, the\npetitioner joined service in the year 1965 and\nretired in the year 2005, but raised the issue\nregarding benefit of proficiency step up in the\npay scale on completion of 23 years of service\nfrom the due date more than five years after\nhis retirement referring to a judgment of this\ncourt and filed the petition claiming the same\nrelief.\n\n15 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n12. The petitioner retired from service\non 31.3.2005 and the claim pertaining to the\nbenefit of proficiency step up, which may be\nadmissible to the petitioner during his service\ncareer, was sought to be raised more than five\nyears after his retirement, the claim made at\nsuch a late stage deserves to be dismissed on\naccount of delay and laches only. The\npetitioner could raise a gr\ngrievance about the\npay scales admissible to him or the last pay\ndrawn by him within a reasonable time after\nhis retirement. He cannot be permitted to\nraise the same at any time on the plea that the\nsame is recurring cause of action.\n\n13. Considering the enu\nenunciation of law,\nas\nreferred to above\n, in my opinion, the\npetitioner herein is not entitled to the relief\nprayed for and the petition deserves to be\ndismissed merely on account of delay and\nlaches.\"\n\n9. At this stage, counsel appearing for the\npetitioners would make an attempt to overcome the\nobstacle of delay by placing reliance upon a Full Bench\nJudgment of this Court in\nSaroj Kumar vs. State of\nPunjab\n, 1998(3) SCT 664.. Counsel would argue that as\nper dictum\nlaid down in\n\nSaroj Kumar\n's case(supra),\nmatters of pay fixation involve a recurring cause of action\nand as such, writ petitions for such claim cannot be\ndismissed on the ground of delay and laches and the Court\nat the most, may restrict the arrears upto 38 months from\nthe date of filing of the petition and disallow the arrears\nfor the period for which even a suit had become time\nbarred.\n\n10. The reliance placed by counsel upon the\njudgment in\nSaroj Kumar\n's case, is wholly misplaced.\n\nThe\nobservations and aspect of delay in\nSaroj Kumar\n's case,\nwere in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in\n\nM.R. Gupta vs. Union of India and others\n, 1995(4) RSJ\n\n16 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n502.. In\nM.R. Gupta\n's case(supra), it had been\ncategorically held that so long as an employee \"is in\nservice\" a fresh cause of action arises every month whe\nwhen\nhe is getting his monthly salary on the basis of a wrong\ncalculation made contrary to rules. It was further held that\nthe claim to be awarded the correct salary on the basis of\na proper pay fixation \"is a right which subsists during the\nentire tenure of service\".\n\n11. In the present case, however the petitioners\nchoose not to agitate their claim while in service. It is\nmuch subsequent to their superannuation that they have\nwoken up and seek to gain impetus from certain\ndecisions that may have been rendere\nrendered in the case of\nsimilarly situated employees.\n\n12. Considering the dictum of law as\nlaid down in\n\nChariman, U.P. Jal Nigam\n's case (supra), the petitioners\nherein are not entitled to any releif as prayed for and the\npetition deserves to be dismissed on the sole ground of\ndelay and laches.\n\n13. Ordered accordingly.\"\n\n14. The Division Bench of this Court in\nin\"\nH.S. Gill vs Union of\n\nIndia and others\n\", 2016(2) SCT 477,, has held that an employee cannot\n\nclaim the revised pay scale after retirement once he has been receiving\n\nthe pay scale granted by the employer for the last 09 years. The\n\nrelevant portion from\nthe said judgment\n, reads as under:\n\nunder:-\n\n\"14. The petitioner is also not entitled to any relief\non account of principle of delay and laches. He has been\nreceiving the pay in the pay scale of Rs.6500\nRs.6500-10500 right\nfrom his transfer to CSIO, Chandigarh i.e. 2.7.2002. For\nthe first time, he moved the representation on 29.8.2011,\nso, he kept mum for about 9 years. Thus, the claim of the\npetitioner is highly belated and st\nstale.\"\n\n17 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n15. The second issue as to whether ad hoc service is countable\n\nfor the grant of time scale and seniority is not res integra as this Court\n\nin CWP No.28652\nNo. of 2019 - R.D. Sharma and others v.

The only issue in the present petition is as to\nwhether the ad hoc service rendered by the petitioners can\nbe counted for grant of ACP benefit.\n\n9. Before proceeding further, it would be\nrelevant to give reference to the ACP Scheme which has\nbeen promulgated by the State Government in exercise of\npowers conferred by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution of India by making the Rules known as \"the\nHaryana Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 1998\" (for\nshort 'the Rules'). Rule 5 of the Rules deals with the\neligibility for grant of ACP scales and provides that every\nGovernment servant, after a regular satisfactory service\nfor a minimum period of 10 and 20 years, is eligible for\ngrant of first and second ACP scale. Rule 5 of the Rules\nreads as under: -\n\n\"5.

The expression\ngiven in the said Rule is the minimum requirement of\n\"regular satisfactory service\" for the pur\npurpose of grant of\nACP scale.\n\n10. The issue in hand is not res integra as it has\nalready been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\ncase of\nHaryana Veterinary and A.H.T.S. Association\n\n(supra) wherein a Full Bench judgment of this Court in\nRakesh Kumar Singla's case (majority view) has been\n\n20 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\noverruled by holding that only the regular service can be\ncounted for the purpose of grant of selection grade.\n\nThe\nsaid judgment has been followed by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in\nJagjiwan Ram\n's case (supra), wh\nwherein after\nconsidering various judgments\njudgments, it has been held as under:-\n\n\"10. The ratio of the above mentioned judgments is\nthat work charged employees constitute a distinct\nclass and they cannot be equated with any other\ncategory or class of employees much less regular\nemployees and further that the work charged\nemployees are not entitled to the service benefits\nwhich are admissible to regular employees under\nthe relevant rules or policy framed by the employer.\n\n11. What to say of work charged employees even\nthose appointed on ad hoc basis cannot claim parity\nwith regular employees in the matter of pay fixation,\ngrant of higher scales of pay, promotion etc.\nIn\n\nState of Haryana v. Haryana Veterinary & AHTS\nAssociation and another\n(supra), a three\nthree-Judge\nBench considered\nonsidered the question whether service of an\nemployee appointed on adhoc basis can be equated\nwith that of regular employee for the purpose of\ngrant of selection grade in terms of the policy\ncontained in circulars dated 2nd June, 1989 and\n16th May, 1990 issued\nsued by the Government of\nHaryana and answered the same in negative. The\nfacts of that case were that one Rakesh Kumar\nSingla who joined service as Assistant Engineer on\nadhoc basis on 4.1.1980 was appointed on regular\nbasis with effect from 29.8.1982 afte\nafter selection by\nthe Public Service Commission.

On a reference made by the\nDivision Bench, the matter was placed before a\nbench of three-Judges.\n\nJudges. By majority judgment, the\nlarger bench held that the service rendered by an\nemployee on the basis of adhoc appointment must\nbe clubbed with his regular service for the purpose\nof grant of selection grade in terms of the policy\nframed by the State Government. This Court\nreversed the judgment of the High Court and held :\n\n\"Coming to the circular dated 22-6-1989,\nissued by the Financial Commissio\nCommissioner and\nSecretary to the Government of Haryana,\nFinance Department, it appears that the\naforesaid circular had been issued for\nremoval of anomalies in the pay scale of\nDoctors, Deputy Superintendents and\nEngineers, and so far as Engineers are\nconcerned, which\nich are in Class I and Class II,\nit was unequivocally indicated that the\nrevised pay scale of Rs. 3000 to Rs. 4500 can\nbe given after completion of 5 years of\nregular service and Rs. 4100 to Rs. 5300 after\ncompletion of 12 years of regular service. The\nsaidd Financial Commissioner had issued yyet\nanother circular dated 16\n16-5-1990, in view of\ncertain demands made by officers of different\ndepartments. The aforesaid circular was\nissued after reconsideration by the\nGovernment modifying to some extent the\nearlier circular\nircular of 22-6-1989, and even in this\ncircular it was categorically indicated that so\nfar as Engineers are concerned, they would\nget Rs. 3000 to 4500 after 5 years of regular\n\n22 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nand satisfactory service and selection grade\nin the scale of pay of Rs. 4100 to R\nRs. 5300,\nwhich is limited to the extent of 20% of the\ncadre post should be given after 12 years of\nregular and satisfactory service.\nThe aforesaid two circulars are unambiguous and\nunequivocally indicate that a Government servant\nwould be entitled to the higher scale indicated\ntherein only on completion of 5 years or 12 years of\nregular service and further the number of persons to\nbe entitled to get the selection grade is limited to\n20% of the cadre post. This being the position, we\nfail to understand how services rendered by Rakesh\nKumar from 1980 to 1982, which was purely on ad\nhoc basis, and was not in accordance with the\nstatutory rules can be taken into account for\ncomputation of the period of 12 years indicated in\nthe circular. The majority judgment oof the High\nCourt committed serious error by equating\nexpression \"regular service\" with \"continuous\nservice\". In our considered opinion under the terms\nand conditions\nons of the circulars dated 22-6-1989 and\n16-5-1990,\n1990, the respondent Rakesh Kumar would be\nentitled\ned for being considered to have the selection\ngrade on completion of 12 years from 29\n29-1-1982 on\nwhich date he was duly appointed against a\ntemporary post of Assistant Engineer on being\nselected by the Public Service Commission and not\nfrom any earlier pointt of time. The conclusion of the\nmajority judgment in favour of Rakesh Kumar,\ntherefore, cannot be sustained.\"\nThe Court then referred to the provisions contained\nin the Haryana Service of Engineers, Class\nClass-II,\n\n23 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nPublic Works Department (Irrigation Branch)\nRules, 1970 and held :-\n\n\"A combined reading of the aforesaid\nprovisions of the Recruitment Rules puts the\ncontroversy beyond any doubt and the only\nconclusion which could be drawn from the\naforesaid Rules is that the services rendered\neither on an ad hoc bbasis or as a stopgap\narrangement, as in the case in hand from\n1980 to 1982 cannot be held to be regular\nservice for getting the benefits of the revised\nscale of pay or of the selection grade under\nthe Government memorandum dated 22- 6-\n1989 and 16-5--1990, and therefore, the\nmajority judgment of the High Court must be\nheld to be contrary to the aforesaid\nprovisions of the Recruitment Rules,\nconsequently cannot be sustained. The initial\nletter of appointment dated 66-12-1979\npursuance to which respondent Rakesh\nKumar joined as an Assistant Engineer on an\nad hoc basis in 1980 was also placed before\nus. The said appointment letter unequivocally\nindicates that the offer of appointment as\nAssistant Engineer was on ad hoc basis and\nclauses 1 to 4 of the said letter fu\nfurther\nprovides that the appointment will be on an\nad hoc basis for a period of 6 months from\nthe date of joining and the salary was a fixed\nsalary of Rs. 400 p.m. in the scale of Rs. 400\nto Rs. 1100 and the services were liable to be\nterminated without any notice and at any time\nwithout assigning any reason and that the\nappointment will not enable the appointee\n\n24 of 29\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\nCWP-17178\n17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nany seniority or any other benefit under the\nService Rules for the time being in force and\nwill not count towards increment in the time\nscale. In view\new of the aforesaid stipulations in\nthe offer of appointment itself we really fail to\nunderstand as to how the aforesaid period of\nservice rendered on ad hoc basis can be held\nto be service on regular basis. The conclusion\nof the High Court is contrary to the very\nterms and conditions stipulated in the offer of\nappointment and, therefore, the same cannot\nbe sustained. The regular letter of\nappointment dated 29\n29-1-1982 in favour of\nRakesh Kumar was also produced before us\nand that letter indicates that the re\nrespondent\nRakesh Kumar along with others had applied\nto the Secretary, Haryana Public Service\nCommission for being appointed as an\nAssistant Engineer and the Service\nCommission after selecting the number of\npersons prepared a list and appointment\nletters were\nre issued by the Government from\nthe said list on the basis of the merit position\nof different candidates.

A reading of the scheme framed by the Board\nmakes it clear that the benefit of time bound\npromotional scales was to be given to the employees\nonly on their completing 9/16 years regular service.\nLikewise, the benefit of promotional increments\ncould be given only on completion of 23 years\nregular service. The use of the term 'regular service'\nin various paragraphs of the scheme shows that\nservice rendered by an employee after regular\nappointment could\nould only be counted for computation\nof 9/16/23 years service and the service of a\ntemporary, adhoc or work charged employee cannot\nbe counted for extending the benefit of time bound\npromotional scales or promotional increments.

For the reasons\nmentioned above, we hold that the respondents were\nnot entitled to the benefit of time bound promotio\npromotional\nscales/promotional increments on a date prior to\ncompletion of 9/16/23 years regular service and the\nHigh Court committed serious error by directing the\nappellants to give them benefit of the scheme by\ncounting their work charged service.\"\n\n11.
