Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by the applicant in the instant OA are\n that husband of applicant late Shri Kameshwar Singh was initially appointed as\n Causal Labour in Patna GPO in year 1994. Thereafter, he was granted\n temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997 vide order dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A/3)\n with all benefits of regular Group 'D' employee.\n\nPatna\nBench\n\n 4. It is the case of the applicant that as per provision of grant of Temporary\n Status Scheme, 1993, a person, who had completed three years service as\n Temporary Status Casual Labour, would be treated at par with Group 'D'\n employee, therefore, husband of the applicant was informed vide memo dated\n 07.02.1998 (Annexure A-3) that he had been granted temporary status at par\n with Group 'D' employee w.e.f. 27.04.1997.\n\n 5. The Directorate issued guidelines vide letter dated 11.12.2018 for\n promotion of TS Casual Labourers to the post of MTS on the basis of seniority-\n cum-fitness (Annexure A/2). As the husband of the applicant has been working\n as TS for a long period on Group 'D' sanctioned post and various vacancies of\n MTS were available in the department but the respondent authority promoted\n only one person as MTS from TS vide order dated 15.11.2022 (Annexure A/6)\n ignoring the claim of husband of the applicant. Aggrieved, husband of the\n applicant submitted representation dated 15.12.2022 to the respondents with a\n request to regularize his services after completion of three years qualifying\n service of T.S. as per rules/law.\n\n 6.

However, the\n\n 3 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n respondents did not regularize the services of husband of the applicant as per\n DoP&T 1993 Scheme and rejected his grievance vide Impugned Order dated\n 28.09.2023 (Annexure A/1) in an illegal manner.\n\n 7. It is also stated in the OA that respondent-authority has granted\n temporary status to the applicant's husband vide Memo dated 07.02.1998 w.e.f.\n 27.04.1997 and also had been granted status at par with Group 'D' employee\n w.e.f. 27.04.1997. Hence, husband of the applicant was entitled for\n regularization as Group 'D' employee after completion of three years of service\n but the same has been rejected by the respondents illegally vide Impugned\n Order dated 28.09.2023.\n\n 8. Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have filed\n written statement and stated that Shri Kameshwar Singh, (now deceased) was\nPatna\nBench selected as Seasonal Casual Labour on 01.07.1986 sponsored through\n employment exchange and thereafter he was engaged for 'Sprinkling Water' on\n Khus during summer season.\n\n 9. It is also the averments in the WS that subsequently, vide order dated\n 25.04.1996, husband of applicant was treated as Casual Labour for all purposes\n henceforth. His service may be utilized as Casual Labour as and when required\n as per rules. He was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997. He was\n treated at par with temporary status Group 'D' employee from 27.04.2000 vide\n order dated 17.05.2000, after completion of three years of service in temporary\n status. It is further stated in the Written Statement that as husband of the\n applicant was appointed as seasonal casual labour at Patna |GP on 01.07.1986\n and after he was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997 vide Patna GPO\n letter dated 07.02.1998 per Department of Posts (Multi Tasking Staff)\n Recruitment Rules, 2018 in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, PART-II-\n Section 10 |iii)(b) \"By appointment of Casual Labourers of the recruiting\n Division or Unit, engaged on or before 1st September, 1993.\" Therefore,\n keeping in view the above mentioned Recruitment Rules, it is clear that\n husband of the applicant is not eligible for promotion in MTS cadre.\n Admittedly, husband of the applicant was never regularized to the post of MTS,\n hence, applicant is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for in this OA.\n\n 4 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n SUBMISSIONS\n\n 10.

Dhanrajo Devi -the applicant\n is entitled to benefit of pension or family pension or not?\"\n\n ANALYSIS\n\n 13. Before dealing with the rival contentions advanced at the Bar. It is\n apposite to quote relevant portion of language of the statutory scheme, policy of\n Union of India Ministry of Communications & I.T., Department of Posts, The\n Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1965, the Central Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules 2021, judgment binding precedents in similar cases,\n in cases of pari-materia provisions passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble\n High Courts, our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and Benches of the Central\n Administrative Tribunal as under:-.\n\nPatna RULE OF LAW\nBench\n\n (A)(i) The casual labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization\n Scheme issued by Department of Posts, Govt. of India dated 12.04.1991 drawn in\n compliance of Hon'ble Supreme Court directions and approved by his Excellency\n President of India relevant portion is reproduced as under for appreciation of the\n Core issue involved in the present OA:-\n\n Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularisation)\n Scheme : In compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court a scheme was drawn up by this Department in consultation with the\n Ministries of Law, Finance and Personnel and the President has been\n pleased to approve the said scheme. The scheme is as follows :-\n\n 1. Temporary status would be conferred on all casual labourers in\n employment as on 29.11.1969 and who continue to be currently\n employed and have rendered continuous service of at least one\n year during the year during the year they must have been engaged\n for a period of 240 days (206 days in the case of offices observing\n five days week).\n\n 2. Such casual workers engaged for full working hours viz 8 hours\n including ½ hour's lunch time will be paid at daily rate on the\n basis of the minimum of the pay scale for a regular Group 'D'\n official including DA, HRA with CCA.\n\n 3. Benefit of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'\n employee would be taken into account for calculating per month\n rate wages after completion of one year of service from the date\n of conferment of Temporary Status. Such increment will be taken\n into account after every one year of service subject to\n performance of duty for at least 240 days (206 days in\n establishments observing five days week) in the year.\n\n 4. Leave entitlement will be one day for every 10 days' of work\n Casual leave or any other kind of leave except maternity leave,\n will not be admissible. No encashment of leave is permissible on\n termination of services for any reason or on the casual labourers\n quitting service.\n\n 5. Maternity leave to lady full time casual lanbourers will be\n allowed as admissible to regular Group 'D' employees.\n\n 6. 50% of the service rendered under Temporary Status would be\n counted for the purpose of retirement benefits after regularization\n as a regular Group 'D' official.\n\n 7. Conferment of Temporary Status does not automatically imply\n that the casual labourers would be appointed as a regular Group\n 'D' employees within any fixed time frame. Appointment in\n\n 8 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n Group 'D' vacancies will continue to be done as per the extant\n Recruitment Rules, which stipulate preference to eligible ED\n employee.\n\n 8. After rendering three years' continuous service after\n conferment of temporary status the casual labourers would be\n treated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees for the\n purposes of contribution to General Provident Fund. They\n would also further be eligible for the grant of Festival\n Advance, Flood Advance on the same conditions as are\n applicable to temporary Group 'D' employee provided they\n furnish two sureties from permanent Government servants of\n this Department.\n\n 9. Their entitlement to Productivity Linked Bonus will continue to\n be at the rate applicable to casual labourers.\n\n 10. Temporary status does not debar dispensing with the service of\n the casual labourers after following the due procedure.\n\n 11. If a labourer with temporary status commits a misconduct and the\n same is proved in an enquiry after giving him reasonable\n opportunity his services will be dispensed with.\n\n 12. Casual labourers may be regularized in units other than recruiting\n units also subject to availability of vacancies.\n\n 13. For purpose of appointment as a regular Group 'd' official the\nPatna\n casual labourers will be allowed age relaxation to the extent of\nBench service rendered by them as casual labourers.\n\n 14. The casual labourers can be deployed any where within the\n recruitment unit /territorial circle on the basis of availability of\n work.\n\n 15. The engagement of the casual labourers will continue to be on\n daily rates of pay on need basis.\n\n 16. The conferment of temporary status has no relation to availability\n of sanctioned regular Group 'D' posts.\n\n 17. No recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts except\n compassionate appointment will be done till casual labourers\n with the requisite qualification are available to fill up the posts in\n question.\n\n Further action may be taken in regard to the casual labourers by each unit\n as per the above said scheme.

No. 1624/1986 working as substitute\n employees and casual labourers in the Department of Posts, Govt. of\n India claimed relief to treat at par with regular employees and be paid\n same emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court\n in Para 11 directed as under:-\n\n \" 11 The Temporary Status would be available to the casual\n labourers in the Postal Department on completion of one year\n continuous service with at least 240 days of work (2036 days\n in the case of officers observing five days week) and on\n conferment of temporary status, House Rent Allowance and\n City Compensatory Allowance shall be admissible. There\n would be no justification to withhold Maternity Leave as that\n is an obligation of the employer under the law and the state as\n an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State\n Policy envisaged in Part-IV of the Constitution should\n provide the same. After rendering three years of continuous\n service with temporary status, the casual labouers shall be\n treated at par with temporary Grade 'D' employees of the\n Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such\n benefits as are admissible to Group \"D\" employees on regular\n basis.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n (ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of Yashwant\n Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in (1996) 7 SCC 113,\n dealing with question for determination \"whether appellant is entitled to\n any pensionary benefits since total service of more than eighteen years\n was in quasi-permanent/temporary.\" The Hon'ble Supreme Court has\n held:-\n\n \"3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for\n the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the\n appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of\n quasi-permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was\n necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.\n\n 12 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was\n in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary\n benefits.\n\n There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the Government for\n 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied\n the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a\n permanent employee of the government. The appellant having\n served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to\n treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.\n\n Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we\n hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent\n after he served the Government for such a long period. The services\n of the appellant shall be treated to be in permanent capacity and he\n shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits. We allow the appeal, set\n aside the judgment of the Tribunal and direct the respondents to\n treat the appellant as having been retired from service on 7.3.1980\n after serving the Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of\n permanent service) and as such his case for grant of pension be\n finalized within six months from the receipt of this order.

Their Lordships further\nBench observed that if temporary employee died in harness his Legal heirs are\n entitled to family pension in light of Rule 10(2) of Temporary Service\n Rules i.e Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules 1965 read\n with CCS Pension Rules 1972 and temporary rules is a social legislation\n beneficial legislation to a beneficiary is required to be extended with\n reference to various judicial pronouncements on the principle of\n beneficial legislation and affirmed order dated 20.3.2013 in OA No. 164\n of 2008 (CAT, Patna) rejecting CWJC No. 7760/2015 of Department of\n Posts.

The Hon'ble High\n Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such\n lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes.

The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of order relied on\n larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nPrem\n Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others\n reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516\n reads as under :-\n\n \"35.

The learned Tribunal dealt issue \"whether the person\n who has not been regularized by the respondents the provision of Rule 54 (2)\n of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972 is attracted or not ? The learned Tribunal\n has considered the matter and examined in detail Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension\n Rules, 1972 and observed that provisions are pari materia to Rule 75- Family\n Pension Scheme for Railway servants, 1954. \nSo also held that case is covered\n by judgement in case of \nAlka Sharma vs Union of India & ors\n 2017 (2)\n SCT (P&H) (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana.\n \nSo also\n case of \nSr. Superintendent of Post Offices and ors vs Painu Ram\n in CWP.\n\nNo.22990/2014 decided on 23.7.2018 by Hon'ble High Court of Himachal\n Pradesh and reliance has also been placed upon judgement passed by Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd) and others vs\n Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd & anr\n etc, 1990 supp. SC 113.\n \nSo also\n observed that case is fully covered by judgement of Hon'ble High Court of\n Himachal Pradesh in matter of \nUnion of India vs Meena Devi\n in CWP No.\n 34 of 2014 decided on 23.7.2018.\n\n 16. In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue \"Whether deceased\n employee, the husband of the applicant who was appointed as casual lobour\n and thereafter conferred the status of temporary employee w.e.f. 27.04.1997and\n retired on 28.02.2024 after more than 36 years of active service and his legal\n heir-Smt. Dhanrajo Devi -the applicant is entitled to benefit of pension or\n family pension or not?\"\n\n 17. Admittedly, husband of the applicant was initially engaged as\n Contingency Paid Casual Labourer in year 1986 and treated as Casual Labour\n from 25.04.1996 for all purpose and granted temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997.\n The department of posts vide instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that all daily\n wagers working in post offices are to be treated as casual labourers. The\n\n 16 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n department of posts has made Scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of\n Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme effective from 01.10.1989.\n The scheme provided provisions for conferment of temporary status to casual\n labourers. So also the scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D'\n regular employee available on conferment of status of temporary employee.\n\n \n18. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus\n Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n 1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that\n substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same\n emoluments as regular employees.

The state as an ideal\n employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly\n with regular employees in the department\".\n\n \n19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in \nJagrit Mazdoor\n Union\n (supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-\n\n \"After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the\n casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of\n the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are\n admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n 20. \nIn compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n \nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n (supra). The Department of Posts, Government of\n India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary\n Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been\n drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and\n Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously\n pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers\n working continuously for long period.\n\n 21. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and\n beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits\n to long continuous working of casual labourers.\n\n 22. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on casual\n labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The husband of the applicant is\n\n 17 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n appointee of 01.07.1986 through District Employment Exchange and it is also\n an admitted that that he has been requesting to regularize and ought to have\n been regularized before 28.02.2024- date of retirement in accordance with law\n as regular employee for no fault of deceased employee - husband of the\n applicant having served for 36 years cannot be made to suffer violating \nArticle\n 14\n, 21\n, 31A\n and \n300\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 23. Husband of the applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n 27.04.1997 pursuant to order dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A-3) and the\n statutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years w.e.f. 27.04.2000 certain\n advantages to temporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum\n of the pay scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.\n Para 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to a\nPatna\nBench\n Group 'D' employee after completion of one year of service from date of\n conferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of\n increment to a government servant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent\n is clear as noon day in formulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and\n writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as\n social legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The\n Central Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles\n of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating\n temporary status casual labour after long period at par with temporary Group\n 'D' employee of the Department granting benefits and treating at par with and\n entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on\n regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity\n Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary\n status for retirement benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on\n absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation\n with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically\n provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three\n years continuous service as temporary status.\n\n 24. The husband of the applicant-deceased employee - was conferred\n temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997 vide Memo dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A-\n\n 3) and accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial\n construction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The husband of the\n applicant after three years since 27.04.1997 meaning thereby since 27.04.2000\n\n 18 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n has attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly\n contributed to G.P.F. The husband of the applicant was in capacity of\n temporary employee from 27.04.1997 till 28.02.2024, date of retirement for\n more than 36 years in service. The applicant's husband having continuously\n worked as temporary status casual labourer since 27.04.1997 and on 27.04.2000\n is holder of post of temporary employee/quasi permanent status and deserves to\n be dealt fairly by the model employer state accordance with guarantee\n enshrined in the \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of the Constitution of India. This Tribunal is\n of the view whereof that it is unfair to continue the applicant's husband such a\n long 36 years in temporary post and without considering for regularizing till\n retirement on 28.02.2024.\n\n \n25. The applicant's husband acquired status of temporary employee Group\nPatna\nBench\n 'D' of Department of Posts on 27.04.1997 and continued till 28.02.2024 - date\n of retirement after putting in 36 years of service and it is well settled in law\n that entitled for such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on\n regular basis. So also held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nJagrit Mazdoor\n Union\n (supra).\n\n 26. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no\n recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers\n available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged\n statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the\n Constitution of India and husband of the applicant was not regularized as for no\n fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his\n duty and not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take\n advantages and plea not even considered for regularization available to them\n that since no regularization no pension etc.\n\n 27. The applicant submitted representation dated 15.12.2022 to allow to\n participate in absorption to regularize services on regular cadre post but no\n response. The respondents have argued that husband of applicant could not be\n provided opportunity for regularization as Group 'D' through selection in view\n of limited vacancies kept for selection of casual labourers. The respondents not\n regularized services of applicant. The applicant was never at fault for such lack\n of regularization due to lack of vacancies. Applicant filed OA No.119 of 2023\n and vide order dated 23.02.2023 (Annexure A-7) disposed of to decide ending\n\n 19 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n representation and present another OA to regularize. This Tribunal vide order\n dated 23.02.2023 directed the respondents, thereafter vide Impugned order\n dated 28.09.2023 (Annexure A-1) - respondents held applicant's husband shall\n not be considered for regularization in MTS Cadre. But in 36 years of active\n service respondents did not regularize for no fault of husband of the applicant\n and applicant cannot be denied pension/family pension etc.\n\n 28. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in\n the O.A that respondents have not regularized services of deceased employee\n on regular post as per law on time, in spite of written requests and retired on\n 28.02.2024 without being regularized. This Tribunal is of the view since\n respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme dated\n 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization since 25.04.1996 as\nPatna\nBench\n Casual Labaour. Hence respondents cannot take advantage of own mistakes\n and latches to deny retirement benefits as not regularized deceased employee\n before retirement. The matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme and\n policy applicable to husband of the applicant and he ought to have at least\n considered for regularization before date of superannuation i.e. 28.02.2024. The\n husband of the applicant worked since 1986 till 28.02.2024 almost more than\n thirty six (36) years since 28.04.1988 in the department in Contingency Paid\n capacity and worked as Causal Labour since 25.04.1996 as per respondents.\n\n 29. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein\n above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated\n 30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I. (5). Benefits of\n casual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status\n reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the deceased\n employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and cannot be taken away by\n respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication & I.T.\n Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of\n implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also envisaged\n in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are\n substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to\n deceased employee accrued rights and has led to widow-applicant in present\n OA and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by\n respondents that unless regularized no pensionry benefits. The said contention\n deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief claimed.\n\n 20 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n 30. The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992\n quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal\n department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly\n acquired temporary status in present case w.e.f. 27.04.1997 becomes entitled to\n benefits admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of\n service for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary\n employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and\n retirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n 31. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are\n regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The\n Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death\n gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as\nPatna\nBench\n are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS\n Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension\n and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2\n CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee, husband of the applicant,\n retired without substantive appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per\n Rules 1965 and Pension Rules 2021.\n\n 32. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as\n extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes\n temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021\n are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant's husband. So also\n the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6)\n cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil services\n and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st December,\n 2003, who retired or were retired before having been appointed in a\n substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the\n government servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services\n (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as\n admissible to any other public servant and respondents have violated\n fundamental right enshrined in \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of Constitution of India.\n\n 33. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years\n service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992\n provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement\n\n 21 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed\n by regularization.\n\n 34. The husband of the applicant stood retired on 28.02.2024 as temporary\n employee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge the\n duties. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 and\n Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension, family pension and\n retirement benefits to temporary employee. The status of employee was at par\n with regular employee on long 36 years continuation on temporary post in\n welfare state. The Scheme of statutory Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules\n 2021 would prevail over any policy decision.\n\n 35. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it\n\nPatna\n clear that applicant's husband - deceased employee, who stood retired before\nBench\n having been appointed in a substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for\n such type of category of temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e\n Pension, retirement gratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable\n to husband of the applicant same scale as admissible to permanent servant\n under CCS Pension Rules to the extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as\n under:-\n\n (i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation\n after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent\n service of not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of\n continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n 36. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes\n clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021\n (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of\n whereof of the firm view that Government of India, Department of Posts\n instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992\n and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read\n conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial\n legislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered\n service not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes\n entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the\n part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension\n\n 22 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n Rules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers\n the said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state\n as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy\n envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution.\n\n \n37. Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses\n and for no fault applicant cannot be made to suffer and deceased employee -\n husband of the applicant entitled to receive pension as if retired from regular\n establishment and so also held by Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of\n judgment in case of \nPrem Singh versus State of U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC\n 516 reproduced herein above.\n\n \n38. The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in\n\nPatna\n case of \nUnion of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.\n 154 of 2019 decided\nBench\n on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in\n O.A. No. 372/2017 (\nBhikhani Devi Vs Union of India\n) as Tribunal relied on\n ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against\n same.\n \nTheir Lordships in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) observed that\n judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none\n of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that\n there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'\n unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an\n employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be\n admissible.\n\n \n39. The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the\n Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal\n issue dealt in detail rules applicable in case of \nUnion of India and ors\n versus Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar CWJC No.\n 7760 of 2015 decided on\n 08.12.2022, reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 affirming order dated 20.3.2013\n in similar OA No. 164/2008 (Patna) and granted benefits of family pension\n arrears as per Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 and CCS Pension Rules 1972\n widow of employee died as temporary employee without being regularized.\n\nThis Tribunal has considered the submissions of the counsel for the parties\n and in judgement in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) previous cases not\n referred to the larger bench perused the ratio \nlaid down by\n their Lordships\n\n 23 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n in case of \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) decided on 08.12.2022.\n Their Lordships considering scheme for Casual Labourers (Grant of\n Temporary Status and Regularization) and held that husband of the\n applicant being temporary employee governed by CCS TS Rules 1965 and\n as per Rule 10 of CCSTS Rule 1965 read with CCS Pension Rule Their\n Lordships in Para 10 of judgement directed reads as under :-\n\n \"10. Respondent is a legal heir and she is awaiting for certain monetary\n benefits for more than decade, therefore to calculate monetary benefits\n in the light of sub-rule 2 of 10 of Rules 1965 and the same shall be\n extended to the respondents within a period of three months from the\n date of receipt of this order, alongwith interest at the rate of 8% p.a.\n from 01.3.2008 in the light of the fact that respondents husband died on\n 15.11.1997 and in the light of Apex Court's decision in the case of Vijay\n L. Mehrotra v. State of U.P. (2001)9 SCC 687.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n \n40. Their Lordships in case of Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar , reported\nPatna\nBench\n in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 considered impact effect of scheme dated 30.11.1992\n of Postal Department and also considered Rule 10 of CCS TS Rules 1965\n and applicability of CCS Pension Rules. After considering the proposition of\n law precedent/ratio decidendi has been laid down. This Tribunal is bound\n by the precedent in \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) principle of law\n laid down interpreting service rules applicable in the case. The present case\n is also covered by the above binding-ratio decedendi, precedent.\n \nThe\n preposition of law as laid down considering relevant service rules in \nMeena\n Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) by Hon'ble High Court Patna constitutes\n binding precedent on this Tribunal and present case is also deserves same\n treatment.\n\n 41. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and legal\n issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding judicial\n pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court\n of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and\n Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present case is no different. This\n Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the case of applicant is a covered\n matter on facts and legal issue involved in the present case and no more res-\n integra. The applicant is also entitled for the same treatment and consequential\n benefits envisaged in the Fundamental Right under \nArticle 14\n \n& 21\n of\n Constitution of India guaranteed to the applicant too.\n\n 24 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n 42. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5 of the\n Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit to casual\n labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status of Casual\n Labourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme is crystal\n clear that temporary employee is entitled to pension and retirement benefits, if\n he has completed three years of service in temporary status followed by\n regularization. The husband of the applicant granted temporary status w.e.f.\n 27.04.1997 and not been regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for\n no fault stood retired on 28.02.2024.\n\n 43. The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants\n are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules\n 1965. As per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued for grant of\nPatna\nBench\n pension, retirement gratuity and in the event of death after retirement,\n members of his family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension read\n with the provisions of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021\n (Erstwhile Rules 1972). The explanation (6) provides appended to Rule 2\n Applicability Clause of the CCS Pension Rules 2021 to the extend these\n rules shall also apply to the case of government servant appointed in\n temporary capacity who retired or were retired before been appointed in a\n substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the\n government servant to the extent provide in the Central Civil Services\n (Temporary Service ) Rules 1965.\n\n 44. The Rule 50-family Pension of CCS Pension Rules 2021 (Erstwhile\n Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia provision in Rule\n 75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants 1964. It is also submitted\n that Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a\n regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari\n Kakkar (supra) has held that it would be travesty of justice if retiree\n denied pensionary benefits simply on ground that he was not a permanent\n employee not regularized after served for 18 ½ years.\n\n 45. \nIn case of Rameshwari Devi versus Union of India, OA No.36 of 2021\n (CAT Patna Bench) vide order dated 17.01.2022 in case of employee with\n temporary status, placed reliance on judgment of \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n versus Union of India\n, (1996) 7 SCC 113, order of Principal Bench in OA\n\n 25 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n No.1287 of 2000. This Tribunal held that applicant's husband served\n continuously as Temporary Status Casual Labour for almost 22 years and not\n been regularized for reasons best known to the employer.\n In O.A. No.143 of\n 2018, (CAT Bench Patna) Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus Union of India &\n Ors. (supra) upheld by Hon'ble High Court of Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024\n vide orders dated 20.06.2024 related to temporary status employee not\n regularized, allowed OA directing respondents to settle pension and all\n pensionary benefits treating his superannuation. This Tribunal in case\n Rameshwari Devi (Supra) vide order dated 17.01.2022 directed respondents to\n process for issuance of Pension Payment Order. Order dated 17.01.2022 in OA\n No.36/2021, Rameshwari Devi case was challenged in CWJC No.7859 of\n 2022 and Hon'ble High Court, Patna, their Lordships on all arrears amount\n directed to pay interest at rate of 8% in light of Hon'ble Supreme Court\nPatna\nBench decision in case of Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of UP, (2001) 9 SCC 687.\n\n 46. Case of Rita Devi versus Union of India, OA No.2630 of 2021 (CAT\n Bench Patna) vide order dated 05.07.2023 in case of deceased employee\n worked continuously more than seventeen years died in harness while working\n as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in Postal\n Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family pension etc. \nThis\n Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008 (\nMeena Devi vs.\n Union of India\n) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC No.7760 of 2015\n (\nUnion of India versus Meena Devi\n) vide judgment dated 08.12.2022,\n Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension, family pension.\n\n Reference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita Devi (Supra) was\n whether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' -\n without regularization was entitled for pension, family pension and benefits this\n Tribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as\n regular Group 'D' (MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at\n par with Group 'D' employee and issue pension, family pension and benefits\n with arrears.\n\n 47. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others\n\n O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin with issue -\n whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as Temporary Status\n at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled for pension and other\n retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post\n\n 26 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n and applicant did not accept and continued as Temporary Status and retired as\n temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'. Applicant started\n employment as Night Guard on daily basis in Postal Department, conferred\n status of Temporary Status, selected as MTS, did not join denied pension,\n family pension.\n This Tribunal in case Shiv Shankar Sah (Supra) considered\n orders passed in similar facts in OA No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015\n upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on\n part of Postal Department not to regularize the services of husband, private\n respondent in 23 years of service after having granted temporary status at par\n with Group 'D' employee and conduct of postal department cannot be\n appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978\n of 2017 upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing\n respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under old\nPatna\nBench pension scheme.\n\n 48. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above cited judgments observed that as per\n rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on\n regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service\n after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On\n working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'\n employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not\n regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of\n respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise\n meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible\n for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order\n passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not\n regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension. In case of Shiv Chandra Sah\n (Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant\n entitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary\n Status period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on\n 03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service\n and to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\n Respondents challenged order dated 21.02.2022 in identical case on hand titled\n Shiv Charndra Shah (supra) in CWJC No.1415 of 2023 Union of India vs.\n Shiv Chandra Shah, upheld by Hon'ble High Court, Patna vide order dated\n 22.08.2024.\n\n 27 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n 49. In case of Ratneshwar Singh versus Union of India, O.A.\n No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue\n applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with temporary\n status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee confirmed at\n part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and claim for pension\n denied that his service not regularized and applicant denied to join on\n regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not\n issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right\n accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule\n 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. \nSo also placed reliance in case OA\n No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of\n 2017 in \nRatneshwar Singh\n (Supra) this Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018,\n allowed OA and directed for fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other\nPatna\nBench retiral dues in light of judgment passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and\n CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA\n No.372/2017.\n\n 50. Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India\n & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld this\n Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships\n considered argument of respondents department that contention of department\n cannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be\n construed that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying\n for more than 27 years.\n\n 51. The present case is similar to cases cited herein above and covered by\n above precedents.\n\n 52. In case of Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus Union of India, OA No.143\n of 2018, decided on 28.10.2021 by Division Bench of this Tribunal, Seisin with\n issue to regularize services of Night Guard continuous since 13.01.1984 and\n Temporary Status conferred but not regularized and denied pension etc. This\n Tribunal vide order dated 28.10.2021 allowed OA to grant pension and all\n pensionary benefits treating his superannuation on 31.10.2019 date of\n retirement and directed for issuance of PPO within four months. \nHon'ble High\n Court, Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024 vide order dated 28.10.2024 affirmed\n order dated 20.10.2021 in \nAwadhesh Prasad Singh\n (supra).\n\n 28 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n 53. Respondents Department of Posts filed CWJC No.128 of 2024, Union of\n India & Ors. Versus Awadhesh Prasad Singh challenging order dated\n 28.10.2021 in OA No.143 of 2018 and Hon'ble High Court vide order dated\n 08.04.2024, heard at length and observed that prima-facie no case is made out,\n directed respondents to comply directions of the CAT as a last chance and\n affirmed order dated 28.10.2021 in the OA.\n\n \n54. This Tribunal in identical facts and legal issue in case titled \nNaina Devi\n versus Union of India and others\n, OA No.1109 of 2015 vide order dated\n 24.11.2023 allowed OA. Relevant paragraphs 39 to 48 for ready reference are\n reproduced as under:-\n\n 39. \nIn \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court\n held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½\nPatna years. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary\nBench\n benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent\n employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances\n appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the\n government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be\n permanent capacity and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.\n\n 40. \nIn \nKritnarain Singh\n (Supra), \nSmt Ram Kali Devi\n (supra),\n \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra), Division Bench of Hon'ble\n High Court Patna examined core issue involved in present OA and their\n Lordships upheld the orders passed by this Tribunal in same facts and\n law and observed that failure on part of postal department respondents\n not to regularize services of employees serving for long period can not be\n appreciated and directed respondents to extend benefits of pension, family\n pension etc. So also upheld orders of this Tribunal in identical cases.\n\n 41. In Shri Painu Ram (supra) Division Bench of Hon'ble High\n Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla dealing with identical issue on\n similar facts upheld order dated 31.1.2014 passed by coordinate Bench\n Chandigarh of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 426/HP/2013 (Chandigarh)\n granting relief to applicant held entitled for same benefits admissible to\n regular Group 'D' employees once applicant conferred temporary status\n and having three years service on temporary status without being\n regularised.\n\n 42. \nIn case of \nMrs. Alka Sharma\n (supra) Division Bench of\n Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana Their Lordships dealing\n with pari materia provision of Railway Services (Pension) Rule, Rule 75\n of family pension scheme for Railway Servants, 1964. The Hon'ble High\n Court considered that employee was not at fault for such lack of\n regularization and not regularized to deceased employee inspite 14 years\n temporary service and directed to grant family pension and other retiral\n benefits inspite of not regularized.\n\n 43. \nIn case of \nAwadhesh Prasad Singh\n (supra), Division Bench of\n this Tribunal decided similar issue in light of same scheme of\n Department of Posts seeking pension and other pensioner benefits\n including regularization in terms of Rule 10, CCS (TS) Rules 1965 read\n with CCS Pension Rules and Government of India decisions, department\n of Posts. On examination of Government of India Department of Posts\n Policy dated 30.11.1992, Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)\n Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 1972 held that Temporary\n employee of Central Government becomes entitled to pension, retirement\n gratuity, family pension benefits in cases of retirement from\n superannuation or invalidation after continuous temporary/quashi\n\n 29 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n permanent service not less than 10 years, event of voluntary retirement\n after 20 years service and event of death in harness. The OA was allowed\n . Pension and all other benefits were granted treating his superannuation\n on 31.10.2019. The Hon'ble High Court Patna has upheld the order and\n dismissed writ application. The present OA is no different fully covered\n issue no more integra and binding on the Tribunal.\n\n 44. In case of Santosh Kumari (supra) learned Coordinate Bench\n at Chandigarh of this Tribunal decided in October 2023 dealing with\n issue \"whether person who has not been regularized by respondents, the\n provision of Rule 54 (2) of the CCS Pension Rule 1972 for grant of\n family pension is attracted or not ?\" \nThe learnd Tribunal On examination\n of core legal issue has held that case is fully covered by judgement in\n similar cases of \nAlka Sharma vs Union of India\n, 2017 (2) SCT (P&H)\n (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana also squarely\n covered in case of postal department \nSr. Superintendent of Posts\n Offices vs Painu Ram\n in CWP No. 2299/2014 and Meena Devi in\n CWP No. 34 of 2014 passed by Hon'ble High Court Himachal\n Pradesh.\n\n Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and\n legal issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding\n judicial pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n and High Court of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble\nPatna\n High Court Patna and Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present\nBench case is no different. This Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the\n case of applicant is a covered matter on facts and legal issue involved in\n the present case and no more res-integra. The applicant is also entitled for\n the same treatment and consequential benefits envisaged in the\n Fundamental Right under \nArticle 14\n \n& 21\n of Constitution of India\n guaranteed to the applicant too..\n\n 45. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5\n of the Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to\n benefit to casual labourers on completion of three years service in\n temporary status of Casual Labourers (Grant of temporary status and\n regularization) Scheme is crystal clear that temporary employee is entitled\n to pension and retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of\n service in temporary status followed by regularization, The husband of\n applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and not been\n regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for no fault stood\n retired on 30.6.2018 and died on 28.5.2022.\n\n The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants\n are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules\n 1965.

The explanation (6) provides appended to Rule\n 2 Applicability Clause of the CCS Pension Rules 2021 to the extend these\n rules shall also apply to the case of government servant appointed in\n temporary capacity who retired or were retired before been appointed in a\n substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the\n government servant to the extent provide in the Central Civil Services\n (Temporary Service ) Rules 1965.\n\n \nThe Rule 50-family Pension of CCS Pension Rules 2021\n (Erstwhile Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia\n provision in Rule 75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants\n 1964. It is also submitted that Rule for family pension no where provides\n that the individual is to be a regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in case of \nYashwant Hari Kakkar\n (supra) has held that it would\n be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on\n ground that he was not a permanent employee not regularized after served\n for 18 ½ years.\n\n The legal issue in hand also qualified by judicial binding\n precedents pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court, Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana, Hon'ble High Court of\n\n 30 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna, their\n Lordships upheld judgements of this Tribunal in identical facts and legal\n issue binding precedents and present case is no different and core issue\n is no more res-integra.\n\n 46. For the above reasons, the issue accordingly decided in the\n favour of the applicant.\n\n 47. In consequences, the deceased employee is held entitled for the\n pension to be computed as per findings supra . The respondents are also\n directed to settle the family pension and other retiral benefits of the\n deceased employee and pay the arrears of pension and family pension\n from 28.5.2022 onwards with interest @ 8 percent per annum from the\n date of entitlement within three months failing which the interest shall be\n paid @ 9 percent per annum from the date of entitlement till final\n payment\n\n 48. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n 55. The legal issue involved in the present case is also qualified by binding\n precedents cited herein above upheld by our own Hon'ble High Court Patna,\n their Lordships upheld orders passed by this Tribunal in identical facts, legal\nPatna\nBench\n issue and binding precedents. This Tribunal is of considered opinion that\n present case is no different and core issue is involved is no more res-integra.\n\n 56. Respondents much emphasized that husband of the applicant while\n working as Temporary Status expressed willingness to be promoted as regular\n employee, but not appointed on regular Group 'D' employee. As evident from\n pleadings applicant worked since year 1986 as Contingency Paid but in more\n than 36 years of service could not be regularized and husband of the applicant\n never refused to be regularized on post she was working.\n\n \n57. Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar case of \nUnion of India versus\n Ratneshwar Singh, CWJC No.13117\n of 2019 vide judgment dated 03.07.2019\n (Annexure - A/5 with OA) in paragraph 3, their Lordships held - \"These\n letters nowhere indicate that the respondent-petitioner had declined to accept\n regularization. In the said circumstances, the combined offer made by\n petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as regularized was not accepted\n by the respondent-petitioner for his personal letters, but that cannot be\n construed to mean that he had declined regularization on the post he was\n occupying. The continuous occupancy of post remained for 27 years undisputed\n in said background judgment in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 as extracted in\n paragraph 11 of impugned judgment comes to the aid of respondent-\n petitioner.\" In view of law \nlaid down in\n similar facts and contention raised by\n respondents, Ho'ble High Court, Patna their Lordships repelled similar\n contention as raised in case on hand. Arguments of learned counsel for\n\n 31 OA No. /050/00839/2023\n\n respondents has no force no document produced of promotion order and no\n application of refusal and repelled. In view whereof, OA deserves to be\n allowed, with all consequential benefits.\n\n CONCLUSION\n\n 58. For the above reasons, the Impugned Order dated 28.09.2023 is set\n aside. The deceased employee is held entitled for the pension to be computed as\n per findings supra. Respondents are further directed to settle the pension/family\n pension and all other retiral benefits and pay the arrears within period of three\n months from date of production/receipt of order passed today, with interest\n @8% per annum from date of entitlement failing which the interest shall be\n paid @9% per annum from date of entitlement till final payment.\nPatna\nBench\n\n 59. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\n\n 60. Any pending Misc. Application (s), if any, shall also stands disposed of.\n\n 61. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\n\n 62. Registry is directed to send copy of order passed today to Chief Post\n Master General, Bihar Circle, Patna-800001 to report compliance of order\n passed today and submit report within four months for compliance of order\n passed today and in case of non-compliance, Registry is further directed to post\n this matter before Bench on 10th March, 2025 for reporting compliance.\n\n (Ajay Pratap Singh)\n Judicial Member.\n\n Central Administrative Tribunal,\n Patna Bench, Patna.\n\n na/-",
