Tiwari - Govt. Advocate for the respondents / State.\n\nORDER\n\n(Reserved on 21/08/2025)\n(Pronounced on 27/09/2025)\n\nAll these petitions have been filed by employees who were initially\nappointed as Daily wager employees and subsequently regularized upon\nfinding their initial appointment to be irregular, and not illegal. They in\nthese petitions are seeking same relief of reckoning of services spent by the\npetitioners as Daily Rated Employees prior to they being regularized in\nregular establishment or in regular work charged establishment as per\npolicy of the State Government dated 09.1.1990 or 16.05.2007, which was\nframed by the State Government for regularization of daily rated employees\nwho had completed a requisite years of service as Daily Rated Employees\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nand who had requisite qualification for the post and their appointments\nwere not illegal and were only irregular.\n\n2. Some of these petitioners have been regularized as per policy dated\n09.1.1990, which was a more lenient policy having more lenient terms and\nconditions for regularization, because it was framed before the judgment of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nSecretary, State of Karnataka vs.\nUmadevi\n(2006) 4 SCC 1.\n\nHowever, after judgment of the case of\nUmadevi\n\n(supra), in pursuance to directions of the Hon'ble Constitution Bench as\ncontained in paragraph 53 thereof, the State Government came out with a\nstricter policy dated 16.05.2007, which has been modified and amended\nfrom time to time. This policy contains more strict parameters for assessing\nwhether the employee has requisite qualification for the post and whether\nhis appointment is illegal or mere irregular. The petitioners in these set of\npetitions have either been regularized in terms of policy dated 09.1.1990 or\nhave been regularized in terms of subsequent policy dated 16.05.2007.\n\n3. Counsel for the petitioners have vehemently argued that the Daily\nWage Services of the petitioners have to be reckoned as Contingency Paid\nServices, because the Daily Rated Employees are paid from contingencies\nand when they are named as Daily Rated Employees but get paid monthly,\nthen they are Temporary Contingency Paid Employees, who acquire\ndeemed status of permanency as per Clause 2(c) readwith 6(3) of M.P.\nWork Charged and Contingency Paid Employees Pension Rules, 1979\n(herein after for short referred to as \"Pension Rules, 1979\"). It is argued\nthat the petitioners upon being engaged as Daily Rated Employees are in\nfact, holders of status of temporary contingency paid employees, because\nthere is no other mode for payment of Daily Rated Employees as per M.P.\nWorks Department Manual, M.P. Treasury Code and M.P. Finance Code\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nunder which payments are made in the Works Departments of the State\nGovernment. It is argued that as per Clause 2 (c) of Pension Rules 1979,\npermanent employee means a Contingency Paid Employee or Work\nCharged Employee, who completes 15 or more years of service on or after\n01.01.1974 and in case of those employees who had attained the age of\nsuperannuation on or after 01.04.1981, permanent employee would mean\nan employee who completes 10 years of service on or after 01.01.1974.\n\n4. It is vehemently argued that a special provision has been carved out\nfor the purpose of pension whereby upon completion of 6 years service\nagainst any regular pensionable post from 01.01.1974, the services shall be\ncounted towards pension, if they are in excess of 6 years and rendered as\nTemporary Worked Charged Employee.\n\n5. Therefore, learned counsel for the petitioners have vehemently\nargued that the Division Bench of this Court in\nRahisha Begum v. State of\nM.P.\n, (2010) 4 MP LJ 332 (MP), has interpreted the amended Clause 6(3)\nof the Pension Rules 1979 as inserted w.e.f. 30.01.1996 and therefore, in\nterms of the said provision of the Pension Rules, the petitioners are entitled\nto count their services for the purpose of pension upon they being\nregularized either in work charged or regular establishment and\nundisputedly, now their services are otherwise pensionable if they stand\nregularized prior to 01.1.2005, or their length of service for purpose of\npension is counted from a date prior to 01.1.2005. It is argued that if Daily\nRated Services are counted, then the initial date of appointment of some\npetitioners would be advanced to a date prior to 01.01.2005 which is the\ncut-off date of old pension scheme and even those petitioners who on\ngetting regularization before 01.1.2005 are still entitled to pension, but they\nalso will stand to gain because their pensionable service would increase\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nand therefore, they would get more pension upon getting benefit of\nqualifying service for the period they had spent as Daily Rated Employees.\n\n6. The counsel for the petitioners have argued by placing reliance on\njudgment of the Division Bench in case of\nPannalal vs. Public Works\nDepartment (W.A. No.827\nof 2019) decided at Indore Bench. So also the\njudgments of various co-ordinates benches whereby identical reliefs have\nbeen granted some of which been confirmed up to the Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\nAs an example, the judgment in case of Netram Sharma (WP No. 6135 of\n2016, as affirmed in WA No. 101 of 2017, Gwalior) has been relied by\nlearned counsel for the petitioners, so also in case of\nLaxmikant Mishra\nVs. State of M.P., W.P. No.\n5133 of 2016 (Gwalior), that has been affirmed\nupto Hon'ble Supreme Court by order Annexure P-13.\n\nIt is argued that\njudgment in case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) has been followed and the\naforesaid order has been confirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide\nAnnexure P-13.\n\n7. The counsel for the petitioners have also vehemently argued that the\npetitioners were paid on monthly basis and since they were monthly paid\nemployees, they would be treated to be Contingency Paid Employees. It is\nargued that a mere Daily Rated Employee would be one who is getting paid\non muster roll on daily basis, i.e. for the actual number of days he\nworks. He works as per minimum daily wages notified by the Labour\nCommissioner or Competent Authority of the State Government from time\nto time. Once he gets paid as per minimum monthly wages declared by\nCollector/Labour Commissioner, he gets the status of temporary\nContingency paid employee.\n\n8. Further, it is argued that the petitioners were not being paid on daily\nbasis but were being paid on monthly basis and therefore, upon they started\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nto get paid on monthly basis, then as per Clause 2(a) of Pension Rules 1979\nthat defines a Contingency Paid Employee, he gets the status of\nContingency Paid Employee. It is argued that the said definition defines a\nContingency Paid Employee as one who is employed for full time in office\nor establishment and who is paid on monthly basis and is being charged to\noffice contingencies and who is not employed only for certain period in a\nyear, i.e. he is not a seasonal employee. Learned counsel for the petitioners\nhave vehemently argued that since the petitioners had ceased to be paid on\na daily basis and therefore, they had earned the entitlement to be declared\nas Contingency Paid Employees and they have to be treated as Contingency\nPaid Employees. It is also argued that from the date after entering service,\nthey earned the status of Temporary Contingency Paid Employee from the\ndate they were started to be paid on monthly basis. It is argued that the\npetitioners would therefore be entitled to count their pre-regularization\nservices in terms of Rule 6(3) if they are in excess of 6 years or otherwise\nin terms of Rule 2(c) if they are in excess of 15 years, from very first year.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioners further argued that the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court recently in the case of Madan Lal Sharma vs. State of M.P.\n[SLP (Civil) No.18981 of 2021] decided on 19.12.2024 has even held that\nthose employees, who are declared classified as permanent employees by\nthe Labour/Industrial Tribunals, they are also entitled to be covered for\npension and their services are also pensionable.\nIt is further argued that\nrecently, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nDharam Singh vs State of\nUP and others\n(Civil Appeal No.8558 of 2018) decided on 19.08.2025 has\nheld that the State Government cannot weaponise the judgment of\nUmadevi\n\n(supra) against Daily Related Employees and directed in that particular\ncase that all those employees, who have been retired shall be granted\nregularization w.e.f. 24.04.2002 until the date of the superannuation, for\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\npay fixation arrears and recalculation of pension, gratuity and other\nterminal benefits. Therefore, it is argued that the petitioners cannot be\nshort-changed by the State Government, more so when they have given\ntheir entire life to the State Government by firstly being engaged as Daily\nRated Employee, then being paid on monthly basis and then later on, upon\nbeing regularized.\n\n10. It is argued that the petitioners are not rank Daily Rated Employees,\nwho were illegally appointed, but they are those persons whose\nappointment was legal and their appointment was only irregular in nature\non account of which the concerned authority of the State has\nsubsequently regularized their appointments, which is not in dispute and\npresently all these petitioners are enjoying regular status in the State\nGovernment on one or the other post in Class-III & Class-IV cadres.\n\n11. It is further argued that though the Full Bench of this Court in the\ncase of\nMamta Shukla v. State of M.P.\n, (2011) 3 MP LJ 210 (FB) has held\nthat the work charged and contingency paid employees are not entitled to\ncount their pre-regularization services for the purpose of pension unless\ntheir appointment is in consonance with the recruitment rules for work\ncharged and contingency paid employees.\n\nHowever, it is argued that even\nin\nthe said judgment\n, the Full Bench has not set aside the case of\nRahisha\nBegum\n(supra) and by protecting the dictum of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra),\nthe Full Bench has only held that the dictum in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n\n(supra) is not per incuriam.\n\nTherefore, the judgment of\nMamta Shukla\n\n(supra) may seem to be against the petitioners, but it is actually not against\nthe petitioners.\n\nIt is argued that even if to any extent the judgment of\n\nMamta Shukla\n(supra )is deemed to be adverse to the case of the\npetitioners, then, in that situation, the said part has to be treated to be per\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nincuriam, because the earlier Full Bench judgment of this Court in Vishnu\nMutiya v. State of M.P., (2006) 1 MP LJ 23 (FB) has skipped the attention\nof the subsequent Full Bench and the subsequent Full Bench having failed\nto notice the earlier Full Bench, therefore, the subsequent Full Bench to the\nextent it is contrary to judgment in the case of Vishnu Mutiya (supra) has\nto be treated as per incuriam.\n\nIt is argued that the subsequent Full Bench\ncould not have passed any order contrary to dictum of the earlier\nFull Bench, which had considered the same two sets of Rules and after\nconsidering both, had held that in case two different rules contained\ndifferent provisions, then the one which is more beneficial to the\nemployees has to be accepted in the welfare state, but in\nMamta Shukla\n\n(supra) a contrary view has been taken that even though the pension\nrules are more beneficial in defining the Contingency Paid Employee, but\nsince the less beneficial definition as contained in the substantive\nrecruitment rules is there, the said definition which is less beneficial to the\npetitioners has been given priority over the more beneficial definition given\nin the pension rules.\n\n12. On these grounds, it is prayed to follow the judgment of the case of\nVishnu Mutiya (supra). It is argued that some of these cases are such\nwhere the employees did not complete six years in Daily Rated or\nContingency Paid Establishment and they are seeking reckoning of their\nservices rendered as Daily Rated or Temporary Contingency Paid\nEmployees, which is of less than six years duration.\n\n13. Therefore, in all these cases it is prayed that the services rendered by\nthe petitioners as alleged Daily Rated Employee be treated to be Temporary\nContingency Paid Employee as they were paid on monthly basis, and upon\nregularization, their entire length of service in excess of six years, or\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\neven if it is less than six years, be calculated for the purpose of pension\nfrom the date of initial engagement as Daily Rated Employee at least for\nthe purpose of pension; and if the pension rules give a more lenient\ninterpretation, then though the benefits for seniority, promotion etc. may\nnot enure good under the substantive recruitment rules, but for the purpose\nof pension once a more lenient definition is there it will enure good only\nfor the purpose of pension if not for anything else. On these grounds it is\nprayed to allow the petition.\n\n14. Per contra, learned counsel for the State has vehemently opposed the\npetitions. It is argued that the contention of the petitioners is utterly\nmisconceived in view of judgment of the Full Bench of this court in\nAshok\nTiwari vs. M.P. Textbook Corporation\nreported in 2010 (2) MP LJ 662,\nwherein the Full Bench has held that a Daily Rated Employee is not\ngoverned by any service rules and his service conditions are not\ndefined. He does not hold any post. It is argued that though it was so held\nin relation to the question whether Daily Rated Employee can be\ntransferred, but still it has been held by the Full Bench that Daily Rated\nEmployee does not hold any post, he does not work against any post and he\nis not subjected to any defined service conditions and no service rules are\napplicable to the Daily Rated Employee. Therefore, now the petitioners\ncannot claim that their Daily Rated Services be held to be covered under\nthe Pension Rules of 1979 and they be given the status of Temporary\nContingency Paid Employees for the period they were working as Daily\nRated Employees. The petitioners cannot claim that their daily rated\nservices be covered under the pension rules of 1979 and they be given the\nstatus of temporarily contingency paid employees for the period they were\nworking as daily rated employees.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\n15. It was argued that the petitioners cannot claim that their daily rated\nservices be covered under the pension rules of 1979 and they be given the\nstatus of temporarily contingency paid employees for the period they were\nworking as daily rated employees. The petitioners cannot claim that their\ndaily rated services be covered under the Pension Rules of 1979 and they\nbe given the status of temporary contingency paid employees for the\nperiod they were working as Daily Rated Employees.\n\n16. Learned counsel for the State further argued that the judgment of the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nDharam Singh\n(supra) and in the case\nof Madanlal Sharma (supra) would not apply to these cases, because the\npetitioners are neither classified as permanent employees as was the case of\nMadanlal Sharma (supra) nor it is a case whereby they were illegally left\nout for being considered for regularization as was the case in\nDharam\nSingh\n(supra). Therefore, it is argued that the petitioners are not entitled to\nbe given the benefits that they are seeking in these petitions.\n\n17. It is further argued that subsequently there has been further\namendment in Pension Rules, 1979 on 27.02.2023 as corrected on\n28.12.2023 and now as per the amended provisions of Rule 6(3) of Pension\nRules, 1979, there has been a drastic amendment in Rule 6 (3) and\ntherefore, in view of subsequent amendment in Pension Rules, 1979 which\nhas been made with retrospective effect from 30.01.1996, the judgment of\nthe Division Bench in W.A. No.827 of 2019 rendered on 10.03.2025 as\nwell as the judgment in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) are now\ndistinguishable and per incuriam as these judgments do not take into\naccount the amended Rule 6(3), which was not in existence at the time of\nrendering of the judgment in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) and the\namendment escaped the consideration of the Division Bench in the case of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nPanna Lal (supra) in W.A. No.827 of 2019. Therefore, the petitioners\ncannot seek benefit of both these judgments, that no longer remain relevant\nafter the amendment of 2023.\n\n18. It is further argued that the petitioners have already been given some\nbenefits by regularizing them either in regular establishment or work\ncharged establishment and giving them regular salary with increment,\nthough they were irregularly appointed by back door and now they cannot\nseek reckoning of pre-regularization services, which was nothing, but back\ndoor appointment as Daily Rated Employee, and cannot be reckoned for\nthe purpose of pension. On these grounds, it is prayed to dismiss the\npetitions.\n\n19. Heard.\n\n20. Learned counsel for the petitioners initially further argued that in\nview of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nDharam\nSingh\n(supra) and in the case of Madanlal Sharma (supra), now all the\nissues stand closed, because now pension has been recognized a right, and\nthe dispute whether the petitioners are contingency paid employees or not,\nno longer remains germane and relevant.\n\n21. However, upon considering the issue, it is observed that the\npetitioners are not classified as permanent employees as was the case of\nMadanlal Sharma (supra), nor it is a case whereby they were illegally left\nout for being considered for regularization as was the case in\nDharam\nSingh\n(supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held them entitled to\nbe regularized from 2002. Therefore, simply on basis of these judgments,\nthe petitioners cannot be held entitled to calculate daily rated services for\npension.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\n22. Then, counsel for the petitioners had argued that even if the benefit\nof Pension Rules, 1979 would not enure to the petitioners, then their\nservices have to be deemed to be pensionable because a daily rated\nemployee is deemed to be a temporary employee and as per the provisions\nof M.P. Civil Services Pension Rules 1976, the services rendered as\ntemporary employees have to be counted.\n\n23. The aforesaid assertion is found to be utterly misplaced because the\nconcept of temporary services flows from the M.P. Government Servants\n(Temporary and Quasi-Permanent Service) Rules, 1960 (for short 'Rules\nof 1960') which defines a temporary Government Servant in its own manner\nas per Rule 2(d) as under:\n\n\"2(d). \"Temporary service\" means officiating or substantive\nservice in a temporary post, and officiating service in a\npermanent post, under State Government and also includes the\nperiod of leave with allowance taken while on temporary service\nand complete years of approved war-service, which have been\ncounted for fixation of pay and seniority.\"\n\n24. The petitioners being daily rated employees do not fall within the\ndefinition of temporary employee as per the aforesaid Rules of 1960 and\nhence this ground holds no foundation. Therefore, this Court proceeds to\nexamine the case of petitioners on the anvil of law relating to Contingency\npaid employees.\n\n25. The issue that arises for determination in these matters is whether all\nthese petitioners who have now undisputedly been regularized in services\nof the State Government but whether their pre-regularization services\nshould be counted for the purpose of pension only. It is undisputed that if\nthe pre-regularization services are counted for the purpose of pension then\nthe services of most of the petitioners would convert into pensionable\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nservices and in some other cases, the number of years of pensionable\nservices would increase which would increase the quantum of pension.\n\n26. To appreciate the contention of the petitioners, the law relating to\nwork-charged and contingency paid employee is required to be seen first.\nThe State Government has framed the Pension Rules of 1979 for the work-\ncharged and contingency paid employees which contains definition of\ncontingency paid employee in Rule 2(a) and permanent employee in Rule\n2(c) as under:-\n\n\"2(a) \"Contingency paid employee\" means a person\nemployed for full time in an office or establishment and who\nis paid on monthly basis and whose pay is charged to office\ncontingencies excluding the employees who are employed\nfor certain period only in a year.\n\n2(c) \"Permanent employee\" means a contingency paid\nemployee or a work-charged employee who has completed\nfifteen years or service or more on or after the 1st January,\n1974:\n\n[Provided that in respect of a contingency paid employee\nwho has attained the age of superannuation on or after 1-4-\n1981, permanent employee means an employee who has\ncompleted ten years of service on or after the January 1,\n1974.]\"\n\n27. The said rules also had an amendment on 01.01.1996 inserting a\nspecial provision that on absorption of temporary employee without\ninterruption against any regular pensionable post, the service rendered from\n01.01.1974 onwards if it is more than six years, shall be counted for\npension as if it was rendered in regular post. The relevant Rule 6(3) as was\noriginally inserted on 01.01.1996 initially was as under:-\n\n\"(3) On absorption of temporary employee without\ninterruption against any regular pensionable post, the\nservice rendered with effect from Ist January, 1974 onwards,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nif such service is of less than six years shall be counted for\npension as if such service was rendered in a regular post.\"\n\n28. The substantive rules governing the services of work-charged and\ncontingency paid employee in the three engineering departments of the\nState Government are identical. This Court shall consider the M.P.\nIrrigation Department (Work-charged and Contingency Paid\nEmployees) Recruitment and Conditions of Service Rules, 1977, (for\nshort, referred as \"Recruitment Rules\"). All the three engineering\nDepartments are stated to be having identical rules governing the\nsubstantive service conditions of contingency and work-charged employees\nas per which contingency paid employee is defined as under:-\n\n2. Definitions.-\n\n(b) Contingency paid employee means a person employed for\nfull time in an office or establishment and who is paid on\nmonthly basis and whose pay is charged to office contingencies.\nExcluding the employees who are employed for certain periods\nonly in the year.\n\n29. The aforesaid definition of contingency paid employee means a\nperson employed for full-time in office or establishment and who is paid on\nmonthly basis and whose pay is debitable to office contingency and is not a\nseasonal employee. The Full Bench in the case of\nMamta Shukla\n(supra)\nhad relied on Rule 7 of the substantive Recruitment Rules of 1977 which\nlay down in Rule 7 (2-A), that there shall be a selection committee in every\nDistrict and as per Rule 7 (2-B) the appointment shall be made as per the\nrecommendations of the said Selection Committee.\n\n30. The aforesaid provisions are as under:-\n\n\"7.

The Full Bench in the case of\nMamta Shukla\n(supra) has held in\npara-24 as under:-\n\n\"24. On the basis of above discussion, we hold in regard to the\nsubstantial questions of law Nos. 2 and 3 that an employee is\neligible to count his past service, as qualifying service in\naccordance with Rule 6 of the Pension Rules, 1979, if he was\nappointed in accordance with the provisions of Recruitment\nRules of 1977. We further hold that an employee, who was not\nappointed in accordance with the provisions of Recruitment\nRules framed by the concerned department, i.e., the Recruitment\nRules of 1977, would not be eligible to count his past service as\nqualifying service for the purpose of grant of pension in\naccordance with the Pension Rules of 1979 and we answer the\nsubstantial questions of law Nos. 2 and 3 accordingly.\"\n\n32. Though in the subsequent para-25 the Full Bench did not touch the\nratio\nlaid down by\nthe earlier Division Bench in the case of\nRahisha\nBegum\n(supra) that for coverage under the Pension Rules, 1979 there has\nto be an appointment in terms of the Recruitment Rules of 1977 by\nfollowing the procedure contained therein.\n\nThe case of\nRahisha Begum\n\n(supra) has been confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP (Civil)\nCC No. 4671/2012 on 23.03.2012.\n\n33. An earlier Full Bench of this Court in Vishnu Mutiya (supra) has\nheld in relation to fixation of superannuation age that since a Gangman is a\ncontingency paid employee therefore, he is entitled to benefit of Rule-2(c)\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nof the Pension Rules, 1979 which declares that a contingency paid\nemployee or work-charged employee becomes permanent employee when\nhe completes 15 years of service. The Full Bench had said that once there\nare two sets of rules then those set of rules which benefits the employee\nhas to be accepted in a welfare state. The Full Bench held as under:-\n\n\"13. While deciding the Gulabsingh's case (supra) the 1977\nRules and Pension Rules of 1979 were not brought to the notice\nof the Court. Under Rule 6 of 1976 Rules the employees who\nwere in service for at least fifteen years on 1-1-1974 were\neligible for the status of permanent work charged or contingency\npaid employees. This has been made more liberal by the 1979\nRules. Rule 2(c) of the 1979 Rules lays down that a\ncontingency paid employee or a work-charged employee\nbecomes permanent employee whenever he completes fifteen\nyears of his service though it may be after 1-1-1974.\n\n14. It is well known principle of law that when two different\nRules contain different provisions the one which is more\nbeneficial to the employees has to be accepted in the welfare\nState. Considering this fact we find that the law laid down by this\nCourt in the case of Bharosi (supra) and Bhajanlal (supra) lay\ndown the correct law while the law laid down by the Gulabsingh\ncase (supra) is not correct as the view taken in the said case was\ntaken without considering the 1977 Rules and 1979 Rules. In\nsuch circumstances we hold that the services of gangmen are\ngoverned by the Rules applicable to work charged and\ncontingency paid employees even though the gangman is not\nincluded in the schedule of 1976 Rules and the age of\nsuperannuation is 62 years as other Class IV employees of the\nState Government because they are in comparable category.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n34. To appreciate the contention of the petitioners that they have been\nappointed as contingency paid employees and they are to be reckoned as\ntemporary contingency paid employees because they are paid from office\ncontingencies and are paid on monthly basis, the relevant provisions are\nrequired to be seen in MP Works Department Manual, MP Treasury Code\nand MP Financial Code.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\n35. As per MP Works Department Manual, Clause 1.133 there are three\nsets of rules to govern the work-charged and contingency paid employees\nin M.P. Public Works Department, Irrigation Department and Public Health\nEngineering Department.\n\n36. As per clause 286 and 287 of MP Treasury Code, the following has\nbeen provided:-\n\n\"286. (1) Save as hereinafter provided in this rule, on pay of any\nkind and no additions to pay may be drawn on bills for\ncontingent expenditure.\n\n(2) Subject to any general or special orders issued by\nGovernment, the pa of class IV servants by whatever designation\nthey may be called who have been or may be, declared by\ncompetent authority to be ineligible for pensions and who\ndischarge the duties of the classes mentioned below, may be\ntreated a contingent expenditure:-\n\n(a) Hot weather establishment.\n\n(b) Mazdoors engaged on manual labour and paid daily or\nmonthly wages.\n\n(c) Temporary field establishments on surveys and\nsettlements.\n\n(d) Sweepers (whether whole-time servants or nor).\n\n(e) Other classes of class IV servants, e.g., dhobies tailors,\nsyces, grass-cutters, cooks, malis. watermen, cartmen,\ndairymen, mochis, barbers, ploughmen, carpenters, etc.\n\n287. Contingent charges incurred on account of the wages of\nmazdoors engaged on manual labour and paid at daily or\nmonthly rates shall be supported by a certificate signed by the\ndisbursing officer of the effect that mazdoors were actually\nentertained and paid.\"\n\n37. As per the aforesaid provisions provided by clause 286(1) (b) that\nMazdoors engaged on manual labour and paid daily or monthly wages are\npaid from \"contingent expenditure\" of the office. Rule 287 further clarifies\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nthat \"contingent\" charges incurred on accounts of wages of Mazdoor shall\nbe supported by certificate signed by the officer concerned.\n\n38. The aforesaid provisions as contained in clause 286 and 287 of MP\nTreasury Code, duly establish that the payment to daily rated employees or\nany labourer engaged has to be made from contingent funds of the\nDepartment.\n\n39. As per clause-43 of Appendix-6 of MP Financial Code, the Collector\nis required to fix the wages of Class-IV Government servants paid from\ncontingency funds. Clause 43 is as under:-\n\n\"43. Class IV Government servants paid from contingencies-\nFixation of the pay of:- The Collectors are authorized to fix\nannually according to the market rate the pay of the class IV\nGovernment servants paid from contin-gencies such as\nwatermen, chowkidars, sweepers and others. The Heads of\nDepartments should send to the Collector of their district a list\nshowing the nomenclature of servants paid from contingencies\nworking in their offices whose pay is required to be fixed\naccording to market rates. The Collector will at the\ncommencement of each year ascertain the current market rates\nfor the services in each class or class IV Government servants\nprevailing at the more important centres in the district and\nannounce such rates annually in January. The Heads of\nDepartments and Deputy Inspector-General of Police may, at\ntheir discretion, introduce the rates from the beginning of the\nnext financial year. These rates should be regarded as maxima\nand should not be exceeded without the previous sanction of the\nState Government.\n\nException 1. This Rule does not apply to the mazdoors of\nGovernment farm and gardens, ploughmen cattlemen, dairymen,\nmilkers, mechanics, tractor dri vers, carpenters and black-\nsmiths, who are paid according to the rates fixed by the Director\nof Agriculture. The Director of Agriculture is empowered to fix\nthe wages of the Bee-Keeper employed in the Entomological\nSection of the Agri-culture Department at a rate not exceeding\neight annas per diem.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nException 2.

From the aforesaid clause 43 it is crystal clear that the Collector fixes\nwages which are popularly known as \"Collector rates\" for the employees\nwho are paid from contingency fund. Therefore, the Daily rated employees,\nare only paid from contingent funds, and upon being paid on monthly rates,\nthey would acquire the status of \"contingency paid employees\", under\npension Rules of 1979. Though the definition in Recruitment Rules of 1977\nis also same, but in absence of selection being made as per Rule-7 thereof,\nthe said status shall not enure good for the Rules of 1977.\n\n41. The Full Bench of this Court in the case\nMamta Shukla\n(supra) did\nnot touch the ratio in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) inasmuch as in\nRahisha Begum it has been held by the Division Bench that an employee\nwho completes 6 years as temporary contingency paid employee he would\nbe entitled to reckon the period for the purpose of pension as per Rule 6(3)\nof Pension Rules, 1979.\n\nThough in\nMamta Shukla\n(supra) it has been held\nthat the appointment has to be in accordance with the provisions mentioned\nin the recruitment rules for the work-charged and contingency paid\nemployees, however despite that in\nMamta Shukla\n(supra) the ratio of\n\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) has not been touched.\n\nIt is important to note here\nthat the judgment in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(Supra) has been\nconfirmed by the Hon'ble Apex court by dismissing the SLP of the State.\n\n42. Furthermore, the case of\nMamta Shukla\n(supra) does not take note\nof the earlier Full Bench judgment in the case of Vishnu Mutiya (supra)\nwhereby the Full Bench held that despite there being variance in the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nrecruitment rules and in the pension rules governing contingency paid\nemployees of the State Government but where two sets of rules are there\nthen the one which favours the employee has to be followed in the welfare\nState and this judgment was not put for consideration before the subsequent\nFull Bench whereby, the Full Bench held that the recruitment rules will\ntake priority over the pension rules.\n\n43. It is in view of this position that various subsequent Benches of this\nCourt have taken the view that the ratio of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) should\nbe followed despite the Full Bench judgment in the case of\nMamta Shukla\n\n(supra).\n\nIt was also on account of the fact that\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) has\nbeen confirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\nTherefore, to the extent of\nholding that unless an employee is appointed as per the provisions of the\nRecruitment Rules of 1977, he would not count his services for the purpose\nof Pension Rules of 1979, the judgment in case of\nMamta Shukla\n(supra)\nis per incuriam, as it does not take into account the earlier contrary view in\nVishnu Mutiya (supra), that was also by a Full Bench and earlier in time.\n\n44.\nIn\nSundeep Kumar Bafna v. State of Maharashtra\n, (2014) 16 SCC\n623, it was held as under :-\n\n\"19. It cannot be over emphasised that the discipline\ndemanded by a precedent or the disqualification or\ndiminution of a decision on the application of the per\nincuriam rule is of great importance, since without it,\ncertainty of law, consistency of rulings and comity of courts\nwould become a costly casualty. A decision or judgment can\nbe per incuriam any provision in a statute, rule or\nregulation, which was not brought to the notice of the court.\nA decision or judgment can also be per incuriam if it is not\npossible to reconcile its ratio with that of a previously\npronounced judgment of a co-equal or larger Bench; or if\nthe decision of a High Court is not in consonance with the\nviews of this Court. It must immediately be clarified that\nthe per incuriam rule is strictly and correctly applicable to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nthe ratio decidendi and not to obiter dicta. It is often\nencountered in High Courts that two or more mutually\nirreconcilable decisions of the Supreme Court are cited at the\nBar. We think that the inviolable recourse is to apply the\nearliest view as the succeeding ones would fall in the\ncategory of per incuriam\".\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n45.\nIn\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi\n, (2017) 16 SCC 680,\nthe Constitutional Bench considered and affirmed the judgement of\n\nSundeep Kumar Bafna\n(supra), and while recognizing that the general\nprinciple is to follow the ratio of co-equal bench, held as under :-\n\n\"28. In this context, we may also refer to Sundeep Kumar\nBafna v. State of Maharashtra [Sundeep Kumar Bafna v. State\nof Maharashtra, (2014) 16 SCC 623 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri)\n558] which correctly lays down the principle that discipline\ndemanded by a precedent or the disqualification or\ndiminution of a decision on the application of the per\nincuriam rule is of great importance, since without it,\ncertainty of law, consistency of rulings and comity of courts\nwould become a costly casualty. A decision or judgment can\nbe per incuriam any provision in a statute, rule or\nregulation, which was not brought to the notice of the court.\nA decision or judgment can also be per incuriam if it is not\npossible to reconcile its ratio with that of a previously\npronounced judgment of a co-equal or larger Bench. There\ncan be no scintilla of doubt that an earlier decision of co-\nequal Bench binds the Bench of same strength. Though the\njudgment in Rajesh case [Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9\nSCC 54 : (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 179 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 817 :\n\n(2014) 1 SCC (L&S) 149] was delivered on a later date, it\nhad not apprised itself of the law stated in\nReshma\nKumari [Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan\n, (2013) 9 SCC\n65 : (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 826] but\nhad been guided by\nSantosh Devi [Santosh Devi v. National\nInsurance Co. Ltd.\n, (2012) 6 SCC 421 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ)\n726 : (2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 160 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 167]. We\nhave no hesitation that it is not a binding precedent on the\nco-equal Bench.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\n46.\nIn\nShah Faesal v. Union of India\n, (2020) 4 SCC 1, another\nConstitution Bench held as under :-\n\n\"29.\nIn this context of the precedential value of a judgment\nrendered per incuriam, the opinion of Venkatachaliah, J., in the\nseven-Judge Bench decision of\nA.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak [A.R.\nAntulay\nv. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 372]\nassumes great relevance : (SCC p. 716, para 183)\n\"183. But the point is that the circumstance that a decision is\nreached per incuriam, merely serves to denude the decision of its\nprecedent value. Such a decision would not be binding as a\njudicial precedent. A coordinate Bench can disagree with it and\ndecline to follow it. A larger Bench can overrule such\ndecision. When a previous decision is so overruled it does not\nhappen -- nor has the overruling Bench any jurisdiction so to do\n\n-- that the finality of the operative order, inter partes, in the\nprevious decision is overturned. In this context the word\n\"decision\" means only the reason for the previous order and not\nthe operative order in the previous decision, binding inter partes.\n... Can such a decision be characterised as one reached per\nincuriam? Indeed, Ranganath Misra, J. says this on the point :\n\n(para 105)\n'Overruling when made by a larger Bench of an earlier decision\nof a smaller one is intended to take away the precedent value of\nthe decision without effecting the binding effect of the decision in\nthe particular case. Antulay, therefore, is not entitled to take\nadvantage of the matter being before a larger Bench.'\"\n\n31. Therefore, the pertinent question before us is regarding the\napplication of the rule of per incuriam. This Court while\ndeciding\nPranay Sethi\ncase [\nNational Insurance Co.\nLtd. v. Pranay Sethi\n, (2017) 16 SCC 680 : (2018) 3 SCC (Civ)\n248 : (2018) 2 SCC (Cri) 205] , referred to an earlier decision\nrendered by a two-Judge Bench in Sundeep Kumar Bafna v. State\nof Maharashtra [Sundeep Kumar Bafna v. State of Maharashtra,\n(2014) 16 SCC 623 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 558] , wherein this\nCourt emphasised upon the relevance and the applicability of the\naforesaid rule : (\nSundeep Kumar Bafna\ncase [\nSundeep Kumar\nBafna v. State of Maharashtra\n, (2014) 16 SCC 623 : (2015) 3\nSCC (Cri) 558] , SCC p. 642, para 19)\n\"19. It cannot be overemphasised that the discipline demanded\nby a precedent or the disqualification or diminution of a decision\non the application of the per incuriam rule is of great\nimportance, since without it, certainty of law, consistency of\nrulings and comity of courts would become a costly casualty. A\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\ndecision or judgment can be per incuriam any provision in a\nstatute, rule or regulation, which was not brought to the notice\nof the court. A decision or judgment can also be per incuriam if\nit is not possible to reconcile its ratio with that of a previously\npronounced judgment of a co-equal or larger Bench; or if the\ndecision of a High Court is not in consonance with the views of\nthis Court. It must immediately be clarified that the per incuriam\nrule is strictly and correctly applicable to the ratio decidendi\nand not to obiter dicta.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n47. The counsel for the State has tried to distinguish the judgment of the\nDivision Bench passed recently at Indore in\nPannalal\n(supra) in W.A.\n827/2009 on the ground that there has been an amendment in the Pension\nRules, 1979 later to the judgment in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra)\nwhich has not been noted by the subsequent Benches.\n\nThe Division Bench\nin\nPannalal\n(supra) has held as under :-\n\n\"08. Rule 2(b) of the Rules of 1976 defines the 'contingency paid\nemployee' which simply says that a person employed for full time in an\noffice or establishment and who is paid on monthly basis and whose\npay is charged to office contingencies. Like definition 2(H) defines\n'work-charged employee' means a person employed upon the actual\nexecution, as distinct from general supervision of a specified work or\nupon subordinate supervision of the departmental labour, store,\nrunning and repairs of electrical equipment and machinery etc. In this\nrule, mode of appointment has not been provided.\n\n09. In the case of Vishnu Mutiya (supra), the Full Bench held that\nthese Gangmen are the employee under the Madhya Pradesh Work\nCharged & Contingency Paid Employees (Recruitment and\nConditions of Service) Rules, 1976. Before the judgment passed in the\ncase of Vishnu Mutiya (supra), even much before this issue came up\nfor consideration before this Court in the case of Rahisha Begum W/o\nLate Ashraf Khan v/s The State of Madhya Pradesh & Others reported\nin 2010 (4) M.P.L.J. 332 and the Division Bench held that the\ncontingency paid employee means a person employed for full time in\nan office or establishment and who is paid on monthly basis is entitled\nfor pension under the Pension Rules, 1979. In the said case, the\nhusband of Rahisha Begum was working as Driver.\nThe validity of the\nsaid judgment was examined in the case of\nMamta Shukla\n(supra).\n\nEven in the case of\nMamta Shukla\n(supra), the Full Bench held that if\nan employee comes within the definition of Work Charged &\nContingency Paid employee as defined in the Pension Rules, 1979,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nthen he is eligible to count past services for the purpose of qualifying\nservice in accordance with the Pension Rules, 1979 and the judgment\npassed in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) is not per inquriam.\n\nEven the case of\nMamta Shukla\n(supra) also is in favour of these writ\npetitioners which has wrongly been applied by the Writ Court to\ndismiss their claim of pension.\nIn the case of Vishnu Mutiya (supra)\nwhich has not been overruled till date, the Full Bench had already\nheld that the Gangman comes within the definition of Work Charges &\nContingency Paid employees under the Madhya Pradesh Work\nCharged & Contingency Employees (Recruitment and Conditions of\nService) Rules, 1976.\nHence, in view of the verdict given in the case of\n\nMamta Shukla\n(supra), the Gangmen are also entitled for pension\nunder the Pension Rules, 1979.\n\nIf both the judgments of\nMamta Shukla\n& Vishnu Mutiya\n(supra) are read jointly, the writ petitioners are\nliable to be pensioned under the Pension Rules, 1979.\n\n10. Apart from above, the Single Bench in W.P. No.8950 of 2012 held\nthat the petitioner being a Mason is entitled for pension in view of the\njudgment passed in the case of\nRamchandra Singh\n(supra). The State\nof M.P. & Ramchandra is another decision of the Division Bench of\nthis Court in W.A. No.179 of 2010, in which Ramchandra being\nGangman appointed on Muster Roll in the year 1957, regularized\nw.e.f. 01.01.1996 and retired in the year 2000 has been held entitled\nfor pension under the Pension Rules, 1979.\n\n11. The judgment passed by the Single Bench in the case of Madanlal\nSharma (supra) was challenged by the State by way of W.A. No.1444\nof 2018. Although the writ appeal was allowed in favour of the State\nGovernment vide order dated 20.09.2019, but Madanlal challenged\nthe same before the Apex Court by way of SLP (C) No.18981 of 2021.\nThe Apex Court granted the leave and registered the same as Civil\nAppeal No.14753 of 2024. Recently, the Apex Court vide order dated\n19.10.2024 has set aside the order passed by the Division Bench and\nupheld the order of Writ Court. The legal heir of Madanlal has been\ndirected to be given the pensionary benefits along with interest @ 6%.\nParagraphs - 14, 15, 16 & 17 of the same are reproduced below:-\n\n''14. Be that as it may, we have noticed that once the Labour\nCourt directed that Madanlal should be classified as a\npermanent employee, the respondents in their appeal petition\nbefore the Industrial Court at Indore had taken a point that\nMadanlal cannot be regularized in the absence of a sanctioned\npost. It is, therefore, clear that the respondents were well and\ntruly aware of the implications of the order of the Labour Court\nwhich required them to regularize his service on a post. If no\npost was available then, Madanlal was required to be placed on\na supernumerary post till such time a sanctioned post became\navailable where he could be accommodated. The\nneglect/failure/omission of the respondents in not conferring\npermanent status to Madanlal cannot afford any justification or\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\ngood reason for them to take advantage of their own wrong in\ndepriving Madanlal of his pensionary benefits.\n\n15. It is in these circumstances that we feel constrained to hold\nthat the learned Single Judge was perfectly right in allowing the\nwrit petition and holding that Madanlal was entitled to\npensionary benefits from 31st January (sic, March), 2012.\n\n16. We, therefore, set aside the impugned judgment and order of\nthe Hon'ble Division Bench of the High Court and restore the\njudgment and order of the learned Single Judge.\n\n17. Now that Madanlal has passed away, the retiral benefits to\nwhich he was entitled, treating him to be a permanent employee,\nas well as benefit on account of family pension shall be released\nin favour of his heirs/legal representatives together with 6%\ninterest from the date of his retirement within three months from\ndate, upon compliance with all formalities and proper\nidentification of his heirs/legal representatives.''\n\n12. Definitions 2(a) & (b) defines the 'contingency paid employee and\nwork-charged employee' and as per Definition 2(c), permanent\nemployee means a contingency paid employee or a work-charged\nemployee who has completed 15 years of service or more is entitled\nfor pension under the Pension Rules, 1979. Now the period of said 10\nyears is reduced to 06 years by way of state amendment in the said\nRules. Rule 6 defines commencement of qualifying service, according\nto which for calculating qualifying service of a permanent employee\nwho retires, the service rendered w.e.f. 01.01.1959 onwards shall be\ncounted. As per sub-rule (2) of Rule 6, on absorption of a permanent\nemployee without interruption against any regular pensionable post,\nthe service rendered w.e.f. 01.01.1959 onwards shall be counted for\npension as if such service was render in a regular post. Therefore,\nthese writ petitioners having rendered more than 30 years of service in\nWork Charges & Contingency Paid Establishment are entitled for the\npensionary benefits. In these Bunch of writ appeals, one of the\nappellants / writ petitioners in W.A. No.1591 of 2018 had been\ndeclared as permanent employee by the Labour Court.\n\n13. In view of the foregoing discussion, the common order dated\n06.08.2018 passed by the Writ Court is hereby set aside. The\nappellants / writ petitioners are entitled for the benefit of pension and\nsame be extended to them from the date of retirement within three\nmonths from today with all consequential benefits.\"\n\n48. So far as the 2023 amendment is concerned, it was not placed for\nconsideration before the Division Bench in the above case. The amendment\nhas been made vide notification dated 27.02.2023 published in M.P.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nGazette extraordinary dated 27.02.2023 amending the questioned Rule 6(3)\nof Pension Rules, 1979 and there has been a correction in the said\namendment on 28.12.2023. After correction, the amended provision reads\nas under:-\n\n\"(3) A service made after 1 January, 1974 on the provisions of\nany regular pensionable post for any temporary employee,\nwithout any interference, provided that such service is not less\nthan six years shall be counted for pension suppose that such a\nservice has been done on a regular basis.\".\n\n49. The said amendment has been made effective from 30.01.1996\nwhich is the date when the earlier provision of Rule 6(3) on which the\njudgment of the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) was based had been\ninserted.\n\nTherefore, the provision inserted on 30.1.1996 which was the\nbasis for judgment in the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) has now been\nchanged with retrospective effect from 30.01.1996 and undisputedly the\nvires of the said amendment have not been put to challenge by any of the\npetitioners.\n\n50. After the said amendment, the services rendered after 01.01.1974\nshall count towards pension only if the services have been rendered on the\nprovision of any regular pensionable post. Earlier, the provision was\n\"absorption\" on any regular pensionable post but now the provision is that\nthe temporary \"service\" should also be on a regular pensionable post.\n\n51. The aforesaid amendment was argued to be self-contradictory\nbecause if there would be temporary service it would not be against a\nregular pensionable post and if there would be service against a regular\npensionable post then it would not be a temporary service. However, the\nposition remains that this kind of amendment that was argued to be cryptic,\nhas not been challenged before this Court till date, nor in these petitions the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nsaid amendment has been put to challenge. Till the amendment is put to\nchallenge, the ratio of the judgment of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) stands\ndiluted because this amendment has been made effective from 1-1-1996\nand the amendment which was the basis of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra) has\nnow gone away from the very first initial date on which it was incorporated\nin the Pension Rules 1979.\n\n52. Despite amendment in Rule 6(3) of Pension Rules, 1979 it is seen\nthat there has been no change or amendment in Rule 2(c) of the Pension\nRules, 1979 which defines a Permanent Employee as a contingency paid\nemployee or work-charged employee who has completed 15 years of\nservice or more after 1.1.1974, and in case of pensioner, who completes 10\nyears of service.\n\n53. Therefore, on account of amendment dated 27.02.2023, though the\nspecial relaxation given to temporary contingency paid employees\ncompleting at least 6 years of service and to reckon the said service for\npension if they are appointed or absorbed against any regular post has been\ndiluted, but the provision of Rule 2(c) has still not been diluted.\n\n54. As per Rule 2(c) an employee completing 15 years of service or more\nafter 1.1.1974 would acquire the status of permanent employee.\n\n55. As per Rule 6 of the Recruitment Rules, 1977, the contingency paid\nemployees are categorized in permanent and temporary categories.\n\n56. The counsel for the State has also relied on the judgments of\nCoordinate Benches of this Court and WP. 15726 of 2025 and WP\nNo.11024 of 2016 and WP No.1268/2021 that identical petitions have been\ndismissed. On the other hand, learned counsel for the petitioner has relied\non judgment of Coordinate Bench in WP 23297 /2022 and WP No.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\n13107/2015 so also of the Division Bench in WA. 827/2019 to contend that\nthe identical petitions have been allowed.\n\n57. However, in the opinion of this Court, unless the subsequent\namendment dated 27.02.2023 is set aside by any court, the petitioners\ncannot seek that parity with the case of\nRahisha Begum\n(supra).\n\n58.\nIn none of these cases, the 2023 amendment of Rule 6(3) has been\nchallenged and now after considering the amendment made in Rule 6(3),\nthis Court has reached to the conclusion that the ratio of\nRahisha Begum\n\n(supra) has been diluted. However, the force of Rule 2 (a) and 2 (c) has still\nnot been diluted so far and that if read with Rule 6 (2) of the Pension Rules\n1979 and the earlier Full Bench in Vishnu Mutiya, it would give rise to\nconclusion that services have to be reckoned for pension if rendered as\ntemporary contingency paid employee for more than 15 years. Rule 6 (2) of\nPension Rules is as under:-\n\n6. Commencement of qualifying service.\n\n(1) xx xx xx\n\n(2) On absorption of a permanent employee without interruption\nagainst any regular pensionable post, the service rendered with\neffect from 1st January, 1959 onwards shall be counted for pension\nas if such service was rendered in a regular post.\n\n59. Upon considering the relevant provisions of MP Financial Code and\nMP Treasury Code, this Court has already reached to conclusion that Class-\nIV and Daily Rated employees in the Engineering Departments are only\npaid under contingent expenditure and the contingency paid employees\nhave been paid on a monthly basis, they then acquire the status of\ntemporary contingency paid employees. Such employees would not acquire\nthe status of temporary contingency paid employees only till the date he\ncontinues to paid on muster roll as daily basis. But as soon as he is started\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\nto be paid at monthly rates, then as per the definition as contained in\nPension Rules 1979, he would acquire the status of contingency paid\nemployee.\n\n60. Therefore, in view of Paragraph-13 of the judgment in case of\nVishnu Mutiya (supra), and looking to the position that the petitioners are\ntemporary contingency paid employees as they are were being paid on a\nmonthly basis prior to regularization, therefore, the services, if rendered as\nmonthly paid Daily rated employee, have to be treated as permanent\ncontingency paid employee, if at least 15 years of service had been\ncompleted prior to regularization. Therefore, the petitions are partly\nallowed in the following terms:-\n\n(i) The services rendered by the petitioners in excess of 15\nyears as monthly paid employees though declared as daily\nrated employees by the State shall be reckoned as services\nfor the purpose of calculation of length of service for\npension. In other words, the services from date next\nimmediately after completion of 15 years as monthly paid\ndaily rated employee shall be counted towards pensionable\nservice after regularization.\n\n(ii) It is held that the services rendered as monthly paid\nemployee, though named or described as daily rated\nemployee by the State, shall be reckoned to be services\nrendered as temporary contingency paid employees that\nwould convert into \"permanent contingency paid employee\"\n\nin terms of proviso to Rule 2 (c) immediately upon\ncompletion of 15 years of monthly paid service, only for\npurpose of pensionable service.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM\n(iii) This period in excess of 15 years shall enure good only\nfor purpose of calculation of length of service for pension\nunder Pension Rules of 1979. In those cases where there\nwas no compliance of Rule 7 of the Recruitment Rules, the\nservices shall not be reckoned to be permanent contingency\npaid services for other purposes like salary, etc.\n\n(iv) The petitioners are set at liberty to challenge the vires of\nthe amendment dated 27.02.2023 and in the case that the\namendment is declared ultra-vires by this Court in any\nsubsequent petition, then the petitioners would be at liberty\nto seek calculation of services rendered as temporary\ncontingency paid employees in excess of 6 years for the\npurpose of pension.\n\n(v) The order be complied within 60 days.\n\n(VIVEK JAIN)\nrj/nks JUDGE\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: RAJESH KUMAR\n\nJYOTISHI\n\nSigning time: 9/27/2025\n\n6:35:17 PM",
