It is not\n\nin dispute that all the writ petitioners are fully qualified for\n\nappointment either to the post of Pharmacists or to the post of\n\nStaff Nurses respectively.\n\n3.The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nwrit petitioners made a submission that there was an\n\nadministrative exigencies in the matter of providing medical\n\nfacility in respect of the hospitals administered by Madurai\n\nCorporation. There was a ban during the relevant point of time to\n\nfill up the post of Pharmacists and Staff Nurses. Thus, the\n\nauthorities competent of Madurai Corporation had taken a decision\n\nto engage temporary employees on contract basis, more\n\nspecifically, to the posts of Pharmacists and Staff Nurses. Thus,\n\ninitiation of process of appointment to these writ petitioners cannot\n\nbe considered as illegal and the circumstances arose also made the\n\nauthorities to invite applications for appointment to the posts of\n\nPharmacists and Staff Nurses.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n4.The learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners\n\nin all these Writ Petitions are of the opinion that the appointment\n\nof the writ petitioners can never be held as illegal appointment and\n\nin fact, the process of appointment was undertaken by issuing\n\nrecruitment notification through the Newspaper. The procedures\n\nwere followed, selection was conducted, the writ petitioners\n\nparticipated in the selection of process, written examination was\n\nconducted, successful candidates were allowed to participate in\n\nthe process of interview and thus, the writ petitioners were\n\nappointed through the established principles of selection and there\n\nis no illegality. The process of interview were conducted by the\n\ncompetent authorities and the orders of appointment were issued\n\nin proceeding dated 01.02.2006.\n\n5.It is contended that though initial appointment of the\n\nwrit petitioners were made on contract basis for one year, the writ\n\npetitioners were allowed to continue in service and now, they are\n\nin service for a considerable length of time. Some of the writ\n\npetitioners were already over aged, some of them already left the\n\njob. Under these circumstances, the benefit of regularization is to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbe extended in favour of the writ petitioners, who are all\n\ncontinuing in service for a long period.\n\n6.The learned Senior Counsel for the writ petitioners\n\nrelied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\n\nthe case of\nState of Orissa and another Vs. Mamata Mohanty\n\nreported in (2011) 4 MLJ 692 (SC), wherein it has been observed\n\nas follows:-\n\n“19.Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition\nthat no person can be appointed even on a temporary\nor ad hoc basis without inviting applications from all\neligible candidates. If any appointment is made by\nmerely inviting names from the Employment Exchange\nor putting a note on the Notice Board etc., that will not\nmeet the requirement of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. Such a course violates the mandates of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India as it\ndeprives the candidates who are eligible for the post,\nfrom being considered. A person employed in violation\nof these provisions is not entitled to any relief including\nsalary. For a valid and legal appointment, mandatory\ncompliance of the said Constitutional requirement is to\nbe fulfilled. The equality clause enshrined in Article 16\nrequires that every such appointment be made by an\nopen advertisement as to enable all eligible persons to\ncompete on merit.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n7.In the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this\n\nCourt, dated 29.04.2014 passed in W.A(MD)Nos.351, 911 and 908\n\nof 2012, the Hon'ble Division Bench has also granted a benefit of\n\nregularization by disagreeing with the applicability of the\n\nprinciples\nlaid down in\nthe case of\nSecretary, State of Karnataka\n\nand others Vs. Umadevi and others\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC\n\n(1).\n\n8.The learned Senior Counsel is of an opinion that in the\n\npresent case also the principles\nlaid down in\n\nUmadevi\ncase need\n\nnot be relied upon.\n\nThe facts and circumstances are different and\n\ntherefore, the\nUmadevi\ncase cannot be applied in the present case\n\non hand and by relying the Division Bench's judgment, the benefit\n\nof regularization and permanent absorption is to be granted to all\n\nthese writ petitioners.\n\n9.The learned counsel appearing for some of the writ\n\npetitioners also supported the view expressed by the learned\n\nSenior Counsel and they have further added that the initial\n\nappointments were made with reference to the Madurai City\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nMunicipal Corporation Act\nand further, initial appointment of these\n\nwrit petitioners were not illegal, recruitment was made by\n\nfollowing the procedures and the writ petitioners were allowed to\n\ncontinue in service for a considerable length of time. Thus, they\n\nare entitled for regularization and permanent absorption.\n\n10.It is further contended that the benefit of\n\nregularization and permanent absorption were granted in respect\n\nof other similarly placed employees, who were initially appointed\n\non contract basis for a specific tenure. When the benefit of\n\nregularization was granted in respect of other similarly placed\n\nemployees, the same benefit is to be extended to the writ\n\npetitioners also.\n\n11.The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing\n\non behalf of the official respondents disputed the contentions\n\nraised by the writ petitioners by stating that by virtue of G.O.Ms.\n\n212, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, dated\n\n29.11.2001, there was a ban of employment by the Government\n\nduring the relevant point of time. However, paper advertisement\n\nto the selection of post for Pharmacists and Staff Nurses, with a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nspecific condition of specific time period was issued on 15.06.2005,\n\nin order to meet out the emergency circumstances in Madurai\n\nCorporation Hospitals. Accordingly, the process of selection was\n\nconducted, specifically to appoint and fill up the post of\n\nPharmacists and Staff Nurses on contract basis for a period of one\n\nyear. Thus, the very process of selection was undertaken on\n\ntemporary basis for the purpose of meeting out the emergency\n\ncircumstances and therefore, the writ petitioners cannot now claim\n\nregularization or permanent absorption contrary to the conditions\n\nof appointment made, which was accepted by all the writ\n\npetitioners.\n\n12.The writ petitioners on expiry of one year period\n\nsubmitted representations seeking regularization on 29.05.2006.\n\nThe Corporation also recommended the case of these writ\n\npetitioners to the Government on 24.07.2006. However, the\n\nGovernment rejected the proposal on 30.10.2006 itself. The claim\n\nof the writ petitioners for regularization and permanent absorption\n\nwas rejected by the Government without any lapse of time, by\n\norder dated 30.10.2006. The order states that “request of the\n\nmedical personnels appointed on contract basis in Madurai and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nTiruchirapalli Corporations for regularisation of their services and\n\nappointment in regular time scale of pay in permanent vacancies is\n\nrejected by the Government”. In another letter dated 03.04.2007,\n\nthe Government made an observation as follows:-\n\n“the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation has\nrequested to accord permission to extend the contract\nperiod of the Medical personnel appointed on contract\nbasis for a further period of one year. In your letter\nthird cited, it has been stated that there is no\njustification in the proposal and the proposal may be\nrejected and the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation\nmay be directed to fill up the posts as per rules as\nalready instructed.”\n\n13.Thus, even during the year 2007, the claim of the writ\n\npetitioners for regularization was rejected. The Government has\n\ndirected the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation to fill up the\n\nposts by following the recruitment rules in force. Such instructions\n\nwere already granted to Madurai Corporation also.\n\n14.The repeated proposals sent by Madurai Corporation\n\nfor grant of regularization were consistently rejected by the\n\nGovernment and the final rejection order was issued in proceeding\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndated 05.06.2014, which is now under challenge in some of the\n\nWrit Petitions.\n\n15.Based on the rejection order of the Government, the\n\nMadurai Corporation also passed resolution Nos.682 and 683 of\n\n2014, dated 31.07.2014, rejecting the appointment Committee\n\nResolution dated 17.10.2013. Thus, the benefit of regularization\n\nand permanent absorption cannot be granted to the writ\n\npetitioners and they have to secure appointment only by\n\nparticipating in the open competitive process, whenever the\n\nrecruitment notification is issued for regular appointment in\n\naccordance with the recruitment rules in force.\n\n16.The learned Additional Government Pleader made a\n\nsubmission that at no point of time, the Government extended any\n\nscope for grant of regularization to these contract employees and\n\nright from the date of expiry of the period of one year contract, the\n\nGovernment rejected the claim for regularization. A constant view\n\nwas taken by the Government by stating that the recruitment rules\n\nought to be followed. However, it was stated that the appointment\n\non contract basis for a period of one year had not been done in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\naccordance with the recruitment rules in force. The rule of\n\nreservation was not followed and therefore, such appointments\n\ncannot be considered as made under the constitutional schemes.\n\n17.Considering the arguments of the respective learned\n\ncounsel appearing both for the writ petitioners and the\n\nrespondents, this Court is of the considered opinion that the relief\n\nin such nature of cases ought to be granted, considering the social\n\nimplications as well as the constitutional principles. It is not as if\n\nthe constitutional Courts can issue directions to regularize the\n\nservice to these contract employees appointed for one year. In the\n\nevent of granting such reliefs in number of litigations, undoubtedly\n\nit will infringe the rights of the lakhs and lakhs of citizens, whose\n\nconstitutional rights are also to be equally protected. The\n\nprinciples of “social justice” enunciated in the Constitution require,\n\nwhile granting constitutional remedies the Courts to follow the\n\nprinciples consistently, so as to avoid all illegality or irregularity in\n\npublic appointments.\n\n18.The illegality or irregularity, corrupt activities in\n\npublic appointments are minimized, then, we are marching\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntowards the achievement of the constitutional goals. If we can able\n\nto reduce the illegality or irregularity in public appointments,\n\nundoubtedly, we are proceeding towards efficient administration.\n\nEfficient administration is essential for the development of our\n\ngreat Nation. Thus, transparency as well as consistency in public\n\nappointments in accordance with the recruitment rules are\n\nparamount importance. Only through following these basic\n\naspects, the State Government achieves the constitution goals and\n\nfulfils directive principles.\n\n19.If many number of illegal or irregular appointments\n\nare allowed, that efficiency level in public administration would be\n\ndescending. Once efficiency is lost, then developmental activities\n\nwill also slow down. Under these circumstances, constitutional\n\nCourt plays major role in preventing the authorities from making\n\nsuch illegal appointments. It is duty mandatory on the part of the\n\nconstitutional Courts to ensure that the public authorities make\n\nappointment only under constitutional schemes and by following\n\nthe recruitment rules in force and by providing equal opportunity\n\nto all eligible candidates, who are all aspiring to secure public\n\nemployment through open competitive process. Thus, in the cases\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof such nature, the Courts cannot carry away with the sympathy of\n\ncertain facts like continuance of service for few years or otherwise.\n\nSuch facts made a ground for showing of misplaced sympathy and\n\nleniency. Such nature of cases will infringe the constitutional\n\nrights of larger sector and thereby, would cause damage to the\n\nefficiency level in public administration. However, the elements in\n\nthis regard are important and appointments are to be made strictly\n\nin accordance with the rules in force.\n\n20.This apart, the appointments of the writ petitioners\n\nwere made as per the notification issued on 15.06.2005. On a\n\nperusal of the notification, it is stated in clear terms that “the\n\ntenure shall be for one year initially and if both parties agree, it is\n\nextendable for another two years. It is further stated that initial\n\nappointment is for one year on contract basis. The order of\n\nappointment dated 01.02.2006 also enumerates as follows:-\n\n“1)The Contract period shall be for one year\nfrom the date of joining (if both parties agree, it is\nextendable for another two years)\n\n2)You cannot claim any seniority or regular\ntime scale\n\n3)You have to work in the hospital from 8.00\nAM to 5.00 PM with one hour lunch break, between\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n1.00 PM to 2.00 PM.”\n\n21.The appointment order enumerates that contract\n\nperiod shall be for one year from the date of joining and they\n\ncannot claim any seniority or regular time scale of pay. Therefore,\n\nthe writ petitioners were very much aware of the conditions\n\nimposed in the appointment order. They joined the post by\n\naccepting the conditions of service. Once the petitioners had\n\naccepted the conditions of service and joined in the post, thereafter,\n\nthey cannot turn around and say that they are entitled for\n\nregularisation and permanent absorption.\n\n22.The growing trends across the Country in various\n\nStates are that the people try to get appointment from various\n\nsources, which all are not in accordance with the recruitment rules\n\nin force. Once they enter into public services through some other\n\nsources on temporary contract basis, daily wage basis etc.,\n\nthereafter, they are making attempt to continue in service for a\n\nconsiderable length of time. After working for some years, they are\n\nattempting to get regularisation and permanent absorption.\n\nHowever, they do not remember that their initial appointments\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwere not in accordance with the recruitment rules in force. Such\n\npractice of securing public appointments on contract basis ought to\n\nbe deprecated and the Constitutional Courts cannot encourage\n\nsuch back door entries to the public service. All eligible candidates\n\nmust keep in mind that they should enter into the public services\n\nunder the Constitutional schemes and by participating in the open\n\ncompetitive process in accordance with the recruitment rules in\n\nforce.\n\n23.Another question raises in the mind of the Court is that\n\nif a public servant enters into the Government service through such\n\nmethods, which is not in accordance with the rules in force, then,\n\nhow such a public servant will be honest and maintain honesty and\n\nintegrity. Therefore, all these aspects are very much important in\n\nthe social prospective. Persons who enter into the public service\n\nthrough back door entry and this Court is of the undoubted opinion\n\nthat public cannot accept the level of honesty or integrity from such\n\npublic servant. If this being the factum, then, the efficiency level is\n\nalso damaged. Under these circumstances, the appointments are\n\nmade in accordance with the recruitment rules in force not only to\n\nmaintain the efficiency level in public administration, but for the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npurpose of providing better services to the people of this great\n\nnation. All these aspects are interlinked. We cannot accept this\n\nmethod of appointment with less efficiency level as well as corrupt\n\nactivities. All these aspects once interlinked, we have to be\n\ncautious in allowing such regularisation or permanent absorption in\n\nviolation of the recruitment rules in force.\n\n24.As far as the present Writ Petitions are concerned, the\n\nGovernment consistently, disallowed the claim of the writ\n\npetitioners even in the final rejection order dated 05.06.2014. The\n\nGovernment in the impugned order stated as follows:-\n\n“4.The requests of the time individual and\nthe proposal of the Commissioner of Municipal\nAdministration have already been received and\nexamined by the Government. With reference to the\nrecommendation of the Commissioner, Madurai\nCorporation dated 24.07.2006 the Government\nexamined the issue and rejected the same vide\nGovernment letter No.31783/MC.IV/2006-1 dated\n30.10.2006. Again the request of the Commissioner\nof Madurai Corporation for extending their contract\nperiod for one more year was also rejected vide\nGovernment letter No.35807/MC IV/2006 dated\n3.4.2007 and the petitions filed by them in 2007,\nwere also dismissed the High Court on 3.4.2009.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nFurther the request of the individuals submitted\nthrough the Mayor of Madurai addressed to the\nHon'ble Minister has been rejected in Letter (D)\nNo.276, Municipal Administration and Water\nSupply Department, dated 24.06.2009.\n\n5.In this connection, it is informed that the\nabove recruitment were done during the ban period\nwithout observing the orders issued in G.O.(Ms)No.\n212, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\nDepartment dated 29.11.2001. They were appointed\non contract periods for a period of one year only\nwhich was indicated in their appointment order itself\nit is also pointed out that the above recruitments\nwere made without consulting the Employment\nExchange and without following the Rule of\nReservation while directly, recruitment them.”\n\n25.The contentions of the writ petitioners that the\n\nappointment of the writ petitioners were continued even through\n\norder dated 18.10.2013, deserve no further consideration, in view\n\nof the fact that all these writ petitioners were allowed to continue\n\nin service based on the interim order granted by this Court and by\n\nfiling these writ petitions. The earlier Writ Petition was dismissed\n\nwith liberty and the rejection subsequently, passed was challenged\n\nby the writ petitioner by way of another writ petition. In all these\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwrit petitions, interim order were granted and based on the interim\n\norder, the writ petitioners were allowed to continue in service.\n\n26.Even paragraph No.53 of the judgment of the\n\nConstitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the\n\ncase of Umadevi clarifies that mere continuance of such litigious\n\nemployments cannot be a ground for grant of regularisation and\n\npermanent absorption in violation of the recruitment rules in force.\n\nThus, mere continuance of the writ petitioners beyond the period of\n\ncontract cannot be a ground for the purpose of grant of\n\nregularisation, in view of the fact that they are continuing the\n\nservice based on the litigation pending before the High Court and\n\nbased on the interim order granted.\n\n27.This Court also elaborately discussed the legal\n\nprinciples settled by the Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India in the case of Umadevi in W.P.Nos.28633 to\n\n28646 of 2014, dated 12.12.2017, beyond the\nUmadevi\ncase\n\nbinding nature of principles are also to be considered by this Court,\n\nin view of the fact that the writ petitioners raised a ground that the\n\nprinciples\nlaid down by\nthe Constitution Bench is not applicable to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe present cases on hand.\n\n28.As far as the present Writ Petitions are concerned, it is\n\nan admitted fact that the writ petitioners were appointed on\n\ncontract basis for one year and no extension was granted. They\n\ncontinued in service, by virtue of the interim order granted by this\n\nCourt. This apart, the rule of reservation was not followed during\n\nthe selection for appointment to the post of Pharmacists and Staff\n\nNurses. When the rule of reservation is not followed, such\n\nappointments are declared unconstitutional and in violation of the\n\nrecruitment rules in force. Undoubtedly, even in respect of these\n\nirregular appointments, this Court is of the considered opinion that\n\nregularisation cannot be granted in violation of the legal principles\n\nsettled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In this case, an amount of\n\nillegality is also interfered, in view of the fact that the rule of\n\nreservation was not followed at the time of appointing the writ\n\npetitioners. Once the rule of reservation is not followed,\n\nundoubtedly, all such appointments are to be declared\n\nunconstitutional, in view of the fact that the rule of reservation is\n\nfundamental right of the citizen.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n29.The relevant paragraphs of the judgment passed in\n\nW.P.Nos.28633 to 28646 of 2014, dated 12.12.2017 are extracted\n\nhereunder:-\n\n“36. Before considering the subject of\nregularization and permanent absorption, this Court\nhas to consider the interpretation of the judgments on\n“binding nature” or “binding precedent” . In view of\nthe fact that the learned counsel for the petitioner has\ncited number of judgments, which were passed\nsubsequent to the Constitution Bench judgment,\nstating that Paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\nhas been interpreted in different ways and under\ndifferent circumstances and the present case is also to\nbe considered and a direction to be issued for\nregularization. In view of the fact that large number\nof judgments are cited before this Court in the matter\nof regularization and permanent absorption, now, this\nCourt has to first decide what all are the judgments\nwhich all are having a “binding precedent” and on this\nreason, this Court has to consider very interpretation\nof the concept regarding “binding precedent”.\nIn\nrespect of judgments in relation to the interpretation\nof “binding precedent”, this Court is inclined to\nconsider the very recent judgment of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the case of\nNational\nInsurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n,\nreported in JT 2017 (10) SC 450. It is pertinent to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nnote that it is a judgment by the Constitution Bench of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India headed by His\nLordship, Hon'ble Chief Justice of India, Dipak\nMisra.CJI,. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of India\ndelivered this judgment and it is relevant to quote\nparagraphs (15 to 26):\n\n“15. The aforesaid analysis in Santosh Devi (supra)\nmay prima facie show that the two-Judge Bench has\ndistinguished the observation made in Sarla Verma’s\ncase but on a studied scrutiny, it becomes clear that it\nhas really expressed a different view than what has\nbeen laid down in Sarla Verma (supra). If we permit\nourselves to say so, the different view has been\nexpressed in a distinctive tone, for the two-Judge\nBench had stated that it was extremely difficult to\nfathom any rationale for the observations made in para\n24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma’s case in respect of\nself-employed or a person on fixed salary without\nprovision for annual increment, etc. This is a clear\ndisagreement with the earlier view, and we have no\nhesitation in saying that it is absolutely impermissible\nkeeping in view the concept of binding precedents.\n\n16. Presently, we may refer to certain\ndecisions which deal with the concept of binding\nprecedent.\n\n17.\nIn\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\nalias\nKalika Singh and others [JT (2003) (4) SC 489], it\nhas been held:-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“10. … an earlier decision may seem to be\nincorrect to a Bench of a coordinate jurisdiction\nconsidering the question later, on the ground that a\npossible aspect of the matter was not considered or not\nraised before the court or more aspects should have\nbeen gone into by the court deciding the matter earlier\nbut it would not be a reason to say that the decision\nwas rendered per incuriam and liable to be ignored.\nThe earlier judgment may seem to be not correct yet it\nwill have the binding effect on the later Bench of\ncoordinate jurisdiction. …”\n\n17.1.The Court has further ruled:-“10. …\nEasy course of saying that earlier decision was\nrendered per incuriam is not permissible and the\nmatter will have to be resolved only in two ways —\neither to follow the earlier decision or refer the matter\nto a larger Bench to examine the issue, in case it is felt\nthat earlier decision is not correct on merits.”\n\n18.\nIn\nG.L. Batra v. State of Haryana and\nothers\n(2014) 13 SCC 759), the Court has accepted\nthe said principle on the basis of judgments of this\nCourt rendered in\nUnion of India v. Godfrey Philips\nIndia Ltd.\n(\n1985) 4 SCC 369), Sundarjas Kanyalal\nBhatija v. Collector, Thane, Maharashtra\n(\n1989) 3\nSCC 396)and Tribhovandas Purshottamdas\nThakkar v. Ratilal Motilal Patel\n(AIR 1968 SC 372).\n\nIt may be noted here that the Constitution Bench in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nMadras Bar Association v. Union of India and\nanother\n[JT 2015(5)SC 33]has clearly stated that the\nprior Constitution Bench judgment in\nUnion of India\nv. Madras Bar Association [JT\n2010 (5) SC 553]is a\nbinding precedent. Be it clarified, the issues that were\nput to rest in the earlier Constitution Bench judgment\nwere treated as precedents by latter Constitution\nBench.\n\n19. In this regard, we may refer to a passage\nfrom Jaisri Sahu v. Rajdewan Dubey (AIR 1962 SC\n\n83):-\n\n“11. Law will be bereft of all its utility if it\nshould be thrown into a state of uncertainty by reason\nof conflicting decisions, and it is therefore desirable\nthat in case of difference of opinion, the question\nshould be authoritatively settled. It sometimes happens\nthat an earlier decision given by a Bench is not\nbrought to the notice of a Bench hearing the same\nquestion, and a contrary decision is given without\nreference to the earlier decision. The question has also\nbeen discussed as to the correct procedure to be\nfollowed when two such conflicting decisions are\nplaced before a later Bench. The practice in the Patna\nHigh Court appears to be that in those cases, the\nearlier decision is followed and not the later. In\nEngland the practice is, as noticed in the judgment in\nSeshamma v. Venkata Narasimharao that the decision\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof a court of appeal is considered as a general rule to\nbe binding on it. There are exceptions to it, and one of\nthem is thus stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd\nEdn., Vol. 22, para 1687, pp. 799-800:\n\n“The court is not bound to follow a decision of\nits own if given per incuriam. A decision is given per\nincuriam when the court has acted in ignorance of a\nprevious decision of its own or of a Court of a co-\nordinate jurisdiction which covered the case before it,\nor when it has acted in ignorance of a decision of the\nHouse of Lords. In the former case it must decide\nwhich decision to follow, and in the latter it is bound by\nthe decision of the House of Lords.”In Virayya v.\nVenkata Subbayya it has been held by the Andhra\nHigh Court that under the circumstances aforesaid the\nBench is free to adopt that view which is in accordance\nwith justice and legal principles after taking into\nconsideration the views expressed in the two\nconflicting Benches, vide also the decision of the\nNagpur High Court in Bilimoria v. Central Bank of\nIndia. The better course would be for the Bench\nhearing the case to refer the matter to a Full Bench in\nview of the conflicting authorities without taking upon\nitself to decide whether it should follow the one Bench\ndecision or the other. We have no doubt that when such\nsituations arise, the Bench hearing cases would refer\nthe matter for the decision of a Full Court.”\n\n20. Though the aforesaid was articulated in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe context of the High Court, yet this Court has been\nfollowing the same as is revealed from the aforestated\npronouncements including that of the Constitution\nBench and, therefore, we entirely agree with the said\nview because it is the precise warrant of respecting a\nprecedent which is the fundamental norm of judicial\ndiscipline.\n\n21.\nIn the context, we may fruitfully note\nwhat has been stated in\nPradip Chandra Parija and\nothers v. Pramod Chandra Patnaik and others\n[JT\n(2002) 5 SCC 23]. In the said case, the Constitution\nBench was dealing with a situation where the two-\nJudge Bench disagreeing with the three-Judge Bench\ndecision directed the matter to be placed before a\nlarger Bench of five Judges of this Court. In that\nscenario, the Constitution Bench stated:-“6. … In our\nview, judicial discipline and propriety demands that a\nBench of two learned Judges should follow a decision\nof a Bench of three learned Judges. But if a Bench of\ntwo learned Judges concludes that an earlier judgment\nof three learned Judges is so very incorrect that in no\ncircumstances can it be followed, the proper course for\nit to adopt is to refer the matter before it to a Bench of\nthree learned Judges setting out, as has been done\nhere, the reasons why it could not agree with the\nearlier judgment. …\n\n22. In Chandra Prakash and others v.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nState of U.P. and another [JT (2002) (3) SC 493],\nanother Constitution Bench dealing with the concept of\nprecedents stated thus:-\n\n“22. … The doctrine of binding precedent is of\nutmost importance in the administration of our judicial\nsystem. It promotes certainty and consistency in\njudicial decisions. Judicial consistency promotes\nconfidence in the system, therefore, there is this need\nfor consistency in the enunciation of legal principles in\nthe decisions of this Court. It is in the above context,\nthis Court in the case of Raghubir Singh (1989) 2 SCC\n\n754)held that a pronouncement of law by a Division\nBench of this Court is binding on a Division Bench of\nthe same or smaller number of Judges. …\n\n23. Be it noted, Chandra Prakash concurred\nwith the view expressed in Raghubir Singh and\nPradip Chandra Parija.\n\n24. In Sandhya Educational Society and\nanother v. Union of India and others (2014) 7 SCC\n\n701), it has been observed that judicial decorum and\ndiscipline is paramount and, therefore, a coordinate\nBench has to respect the judgments and orders passed\nby another coordinate Bench.\nIn\nRattiram and others\nv. State of Madhya Pradesh\n(2012) 4 SCC 516), the\nCourt dwelt upon the issue what would be the\nconsequent effect of the latter decision which had been\nrendered without noticing the earlier decisions.\n\nThe\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt noted the observations in Raghubir Singh\n(supra) and reproduced a passage from\nIndian Oil\nCorporation Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation\n(1995)\n4 SCC 96)which is to the following effect:-“8.\n\n… The\nDivision Bench of the High Court in\nMunicipal Corpn.,\nIndore v. Ratnaprabha Dhanda\nwas clearly in error in\ntaking the view that the decision of this Court in\nRatnaprabha was not binding on it. In doing so, the\nDivision Bench of the High Court did something which\neven a later coequal Bench of this Court did not and\ncould not do. …\n\n25. It also stated what has been expressed in\nRaghubir Singh (supra) by R.S. Pathak, C.J. It is as\nfollows:-“28. We are of opinion that a pronouncement\nof law by a Division Bench of this Court is binding on a\nDivision Bench of the same or a smaller number of\nJudges, and in order that such decision be binding, it is\nnot necessary that it should be a decision rendered by\nthe Full Court or a Constitution Bench of the Court. …”\n\n26. In Rajesh (supra) the three-Judge Bench\nhad delivered the judgment on 12.04.2013. The\npurpose of stating the date is that it has been delivered\nafter the pronouncement made in Reshma Kumari’s\ncase. On a perusal of the decision in Rajesh (supra),\nwe find that an attempt has been made to explain what\nthe two- Judge Bench had stated in Santosh Devi\n(supra). The relevant passages read as follows:-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case\nactually intended to follow the principle in the case of\nsalaried persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and\nto make it applicable also to the self-employed and\npersons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the increase\nin the case of those groups is not 30% always; it will\nalso have a reference to the age. In other words, in the\ncase of self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in\ncase, the deceased victim was below 40 years, there\nmust be an addition of 50% to the actual income of the\ndeceased while computing future prospects. Needless\nto say that the actual income should be income after\npaying the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case\nthe deceased was in the age group of 40 to 50 years.9.\nIn Sarla Verma case, it has been stated that in the\ncase of those above 50 years, there shall be no\naddition. Having regard to the fact that in the case of\nthose self-employed or on fixed wages, where there is\nnormally no age of superannuation, we are of the view\nthat it will only be just and equitable to provide an\naddition of 15% in the case where the victim is\nbetween the age group of 50 to 60 years so as to make\nthe compensation just, equitable, fair and reasonable.\nThere shall normally be no addition thereafter.”\n\n37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India, while dealing with the cases\nof accident claims, has elaborately discussed about the\n“binding precedent”. The case in relation to the Motor\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nAccident Claims, the case of “Sarla Verma” was being\nfollowed by all the Courts across the Country for the\npurpose of awarding compensation. When the\nquestion arosed that the “binding nature” of the said\ncase of “Sarla Verma” delivered by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India, the Constitution Bench\nheaded by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India held that\nthe principles laid down in the case of “Virayya v.\n\nVenkata Subbayya” , it has been held by the Andhra\nPradesh High Court that under the circumstances\naforesaid the Bench is free to adopt that view which is\nin accordance with justice and legal principles after\ntaking into consideration the views expressed in the\ntwo conflicting Benches, it is further held that in the\ncase of\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\nalias Kalika\nSingh and others, reported in [JT (2003) 4 SC\n489], held that the earlier judgment may seem to be\nnot correct yet it will have the binding effect on the\nlater Bench of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nTheir Lordships\nrendered the case of\nChandra Prakash and others v.\nState of U.P. and another\n, reported in [JT 2002\n(3) SC 493], held that the doctrine of binding\nprecedent is of utmost importance in the\nadministration of our judicial system. It promotes\ncertainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial\nconsistency promotes confidence in the system,\ntherefore, there is this need for consistency in the\nenunciation of legal principles in the decisions of this\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt.\n\n38. By enumerating the legal principle in this\nregard, the Apex Court of India held that the judgment\nby the Larger Bench of the Courts are to be treated as\n“binding precedent”, while deciding the legal\nprinciples involved in the particular case.\n\n39. Another Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Padma\nSundara Rao and Others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\nand others, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 533, and the\nrelevant paragraph (9) of the Judgment is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“9. Courts should not place reliance on\ndecisions without discussing as to how the factual\nsituation fits in with the fact situation of the decision\non which reliance is placed. There is always peril in\ntreating the words of a speech or judgment as though\nthey are words in a legislative enactment, and it is to\nbe remembered that judicial utterances are made in\nthe setting of the facts of a particular case, said Lord\nMorris in Herrington v. British Railways Board [(1972)\n2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC 877 (HL) [Sub nom British\nRailways Board v. Herrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749\n(HL)]] . Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or\ndifferent fact may make a world of difference between\nconclusions in two cases.”\n\n40. In view of the legal principle settled in\nthe matter of “binding precedent”, now, this Court is\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbound by the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the “Umadevi Case”. Admittedly, there is no\nother subsequent Constitution Bench judgment in\nrespect of the subject of regularization and permanent\nabsorption. The last judgment rendered by the\nConstitution Bench in the subject matter is “Umadevi\nCase”. Thus, the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” are of\n“binding precedent” or to be followed as “binding\nprecedent”. Thus, the facts and circumstances of the\npresent writ petition has to be considered only in the\nlight of the principles laid down by the Constitution\nBench. All other judgments subsequently passed by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India may have certain\ndistinctions far and against. However, these\njudgments are to be interpreted only based on the\nfacts and circumstances prevailing in that particular\ncase and therefore, this Court cannot consider those\njudgments delivered on a particular facts in relation to\nthat particular case. However, the legal principles are\nto be considered in relation to the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case on hand.\n\n41. Let us look into the basic principles\nenunciated by the Constitution Bench in the matter of\nregularization and permanent absorption. Paragraph\n(5) of the “Umadevi Case” is extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhich could not be said to be consistent with the\nconstitutional scheme of public employment. Such\ndirections are issued presumably on the basis of\nequitable considerations or individualisation of justice.\nThe question arises, equity to whom? Equity for the\nhandful of people who have approached the court with\na claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this\ncountry seeking employment and seeking a fair\nopportunity for competing for employment? When one\nside of the coin is considered, the other side of the coin\nhas also to be considered and the way open to any\ncourt of law or justice, is to adhere to the law as laid\ndown by the Constitution and not to make directions,\nwhich at times, even if do not run counter to the\nconstitutional scheme, certainly tend to water down\nthe constitutional requirements. It is this conflict that\nis reflected in these cases referred to the Constitution\nBench”\n\n42. This Court wants to look into the very\nfindings made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nin the above said paragraph (5), the Apex Court has\nconceded that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had\nalso on occasions, issued directions, which could not\nbe said to be consistent with the Constitutional\nschemes of public employment. Such directions are\nissued presumably on the basis of equitable\nconsiderations or individualisation of justice. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India raised a question that\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nequity to whom? Equity for the handful of people who\nhave approached the Court with the claim, or equity\nfor the teeming millions of this Country seeking\nemployment and seeking a fair opportunity for\ncompeting for employment? When one side of the coin\nis considered, the other side of the coin has also to be\nconsidered and the way open to any Court of law or\njustice, is to adhere to the law as laid down by the\nConstitution and not to make directions, which at\ntimes, even if do not run counter to the constitutional\nscheme, certainly tend to water down the\nconstitutional requirements. It is this Conflict that\nreflected in these cases referred to the Constitution\nBench.\n\n43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong\nconcern recorded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia. The concern raised by the Constitution Bench is\nthat by granting relief to a handful of people, the large\nsector of meritorious youth of this great nation cannot\nbe deprived of their constitutional rights. Under this\npretext, the Constitution Bench commenced its\nconsideration in “Umadevi Case”. Thus, the very\nenumeration in the above paragraph is crystal clear\nthat the Constitution Bench has laid down the principle\nin the matter of regularization and permanent\nabsorption and the idea of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India has to stop the practice of appointing\nemployees, through back door on extraneous\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nconsideration by showing favoritism and nepotism.\n\n44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the “Umadevi\nCase” is extracted hereunder:\n\n“10. When these matters came up before a\nBench of two Judges, the learned Judges referred the\ncases to a Bench of three Judges. The order of\nreference is reported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(1) [(2004) 7 SCC 132 : 2004 SCC (L&S)\n935 : (2003) 9 Scale 187] . This Court noticed that in\nthe matter of regularisation of ad hoc employees, there\nwere conflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of\nthis Court and by two-Judge Benches and hence the\nquestion required to be considered by a larger Bench.\n\nWhen the matters came up before a three-Judge\nBench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter required\nconsideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the\nconflict and in the light of the arguments raised by the\nAdditional Solicitor General. The order of reference is\nreported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(2)\n[(2006) 4 SCC 44 : (2003) 10 Scale 388] . It appears to\nbe proper to quote that order of reference at this\nstage. It reads: (SCC p. 45, paras 1-5)\n“1.\n\nApart from the conflicting opinions between the\nthree-Judge Bench decisions in\nAshwani Kumar v. State\nof Bihar\n[(1997) 2 SCC 1 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 465 : 1996\nSupp (10) SCR 120] , State of Haryana v. Piara Singh\n[(1992) 4 SCC 118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21\nATC 403 : (1992) 3 SCR 826] and Dharwad Distt.\n\nPWD\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v.

Nagarajan v.\n\nState of Karnataka [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n(L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] on the other, which have\nbeen brought out in one of the judgments under appeal\nof the Karnataka High Court in\nState of Karnataka v.\nH. Ganesh Rao\n[(2001) 4 Kant LJ 466 (DB)] , decided\non 1-6-2001 the learned Additional Solicitor General\nurged that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant\nto\nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\nand\nof the Constitution\nand, therefore, these cases are required to be heard by\na Bench of five learned Judges (Constitution Bench).\n\n2. On the other hand, Mr M.C. Bhandare, learned\nSenior Counsel, appearing for the employees urged\nthat such a scheme for regularisation is consistent with\nthe provisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n3. Mr V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing\nin CCs Nos. 109-498 of 2003, has filed the GO dated\n19-7-2002 and submitted that the orders have already\nbeen implemented.\n\n4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbetween the three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court,\nwe are of the view that these cases are required to be\nheard by a Bench of five learned Judges.\n\n5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the\nChief Justice for appropriate orders.”\nWe are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue\nhere. We have to lay down the law. We have to\napproach the question as a constitutional court\nshould.”\n\n45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates\nthat there were conflicting decisions by three-Judge\nBenches of this Court and by two-Judge Benches of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India and therefore, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has considered that\nthe question required to be considered by a larger\nBench. It is further observed that when the matters\ncame up before a three-Judge Bench, the Bench in turn\nfelt that the matter required consideration by a\nConstitution Bench in view of the conflict and in the\nlight of the arguments raised by the Additional\nSolicitor General. In the reference made by the\nHon'ble three-Judge Bench itself decided that the\nscheme for regularisation is repugnant to\nArticles\n16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\nand\nof the Constitution and,\ntherefore, these cases are required to be heard by a\nBench of five learned Judges(Constitution Bench).\n\n46. In paragraph (11) of the “Umadevi\nCase”, it is stated that in addition to the equality\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nclause represented by\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution,\n\nArticle 16\nhas specifically provided for equality of\nopportunity in matters of public employment.\nButtressing these fundamental rights,\nArticle 309\n\nprovides that subject to the provisions of the\nConstitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate the\nrecruitment and conditions of service of persons\nappointed to public services and posts in connection\nwith the affairs of the Union or of a State.\n\n47. In view of the interpretation placed on\n\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution by this Court, obviously,\nthese principles also govern the instrumentalities that\ncome within the purview of\nArticle 12\nof the\nConstitution. With a view to make the procedure for\nselection fair, the Constitution by\nArticle 315\nhas also\ncreated a Public Service Commission for the Union and\nthe Public Service Commissions for the States.\nArticle\ndeals with the functions of the Public Service\nCommissions and mandates consultation with the\nCommission on all matters relating to methods of\nrecruitment to civil services and for civil posts and\nother related matters. As a part of the affirmative\naction recognised by\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution,\n\nArticle 335\nprovides for special consideration in the\nmatter of claims of the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes for employment.\n\n48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the“Umadevi\nCase” reads as follows:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“12. In spite of this scheme, there may be occasions\nwhen the sovereign State or its instrumentalities will\nhave to employ persons, in posts which are temporary,\non daily wages, as additional hands or taking them in\nwithout following the required procedure, to discharge\nthe duties in respect of the posts that are sanctioned\nand that are required to be filled in terms of the\nrelevant procedure established by the Constitution or\nfor work in temporary posts or projects that are not\nneeded permanently. This right of the Union or of the\nState Government cannot but be recognised and there\nis nothing in the Constitution which prohibits such\nengaging of persons temporarily or on daily wages, to\nmeet the needs of the situation. But the fact that such\nengagements are resorted to, cannot be used to defeat\nthe very scheme of public employment. Nor can a court\nsay that the Union or the State Governments do not\nhave the right to engage persons in various capacities\nfor a duration or until the work in a particular project\nis completed. Once this right of the Government is\nrecognised and the mandate of the constitutional\nrequirement for public employment is respected, there\ncannot be much difficulty in coming to the conclusion\nthat it is ordinarily not proper for the Courts whether\nacting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution or under\n\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, to direct absorption in\npermanent employment of those who have been\nengaged without following a due process of selection\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nas envisaged by the constitutional scheme.”\n\n49. The spirit of Paragraph (12) of the\n“Umadevi Case” judgment is that the temporary\nengagements like daily wage appointments,\nconsolidated pay appointments and temporary\nappointments and engagements are resorted to, cannot\nbe used to defeat the very scheme of public\nemployment. Nor can a Court say that the Union or\nthe State Governments do not have the right to engage\npersons in various capacities for a duration or until the\nwork in a particular project is completed. Once this\nright of the Government is recognised and the mandate\nof the constitutional requirement for public\nemployment is respected, there cannot be much\ndifficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is\nordinarily not proper for the Courts, whether acting\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution or under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, to direct absorption in\npermanent employment of those who have been\nengaged without following a due process of selection\nas envisaged by the constitutional scheme. Thus, it is\nmade clear by the Constitutional Bench that regular\nrecruitment rules in force, followed scrupulously by\nthe competent authorities and engagements on\ntemporary basis cannot be resorted or the same cannot\nlead to permanent absorption or regularization.\nFurther, it is stated that the Government is entitled to\nappoint the persons on daily wages/consolidated\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npay/temporary basis, if a Government is of the opinion\nthat a project has to be implemented or a special\nworks to be carried out, then they are at liberty to do\nso, by engaging the temporary employees. Such being\nthe concept accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia, no doubt, a mere appointment on\ntemporary/daily wage basis cannot constitute a right\nfor the employees to claim regularization or permanent\nabsorption.\n\n50. Further, Paragraph (13) of the “Umadevi\nCase” judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13. What is sought to be pitted against this approach,\nis the so-called equity arising out of giving of\ntemporary employment or engagement on daily wages\nand the continuance of such persons in the engaged\nwork for a certain length of time. Such considerations\ncan have only a limited role to play, when every\nqualified citizen has a right to apply for appointment,\nthe adoption of the concept of rule of law and the\nscheme of the Constitution for appointment to posts. It\ncannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of the\ncourts to ignore, encourage or approve appointments\nmade or engagements given outside the constitutional\nscheme. In effect, orders based on such sentiments or\napproach would result in perpetuating illegalities and\nin the jettisoning of the scheme of public employment\nadopted by us while adopting the Constitution. The\napproving of such acts also results in depriving many\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof their opportunity to compete for public employment.\nWe have, therefore, to consider the question\nobjectively and based on the constitutional and\nstatutory provisions.\nIn this context, we have also to\nbear in mind the exposition of law by a Constitution\nBench in\nState of Punjab v. Jagdip Singh\n[(1964) 4 SCR\n964 : AIR 1964 SC 521] .\nIt was held therein: (SCR pp.\n\n971-72)\n“In our opinion where a government servant has no\nright to a post or to a particular status, though an\nauthority under the Government acting beyond its\ncompetence had purported to give that person a status\nwhich it was not entitled to give he will not in law be\ndeemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\ngiven the particular status.”\n\n51. This Court cannot omit the powerful\nstatement made by the Constitution Bench in respect\nof providing equal opportunity and in respect of\nimplementing the equality clause enshrined under\n\nArticle 14\n\n& 16\nof the Constitution. In the above said\nparagraph (13), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas emphasized that it cannot also be forgotten that it\nis not the role of the Courts to ignore, encourage or\napprove appointments made or engagements given\noutside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders\nbased on such sentiments or approach would result in\nperpetuating illegalities and in the jettisoning of the\nscheme of public employment adopted by us, while\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nadopting the Constitution. We, the people of India,\nwhile adopting the Constitution.\n\n52. The approving of such acts also results in\ndepriving many of their opportunity to compete for\npublic employment. The Constitution Bench of\n“Umadevi Case”, considered the proposition of law\n\nlaid down by\nthe previous Constitution Bench in the\ncase of\nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, reported\nin [AIR (1964) SC 521].\n\nThe earlier Constitution\nBench in the case of\nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip\nSingh\n, held that where a Government Servant has no\nright to a post or to a particular status, though an\nauthority under the Government acting beyond its\ncompetence had purported to give that person a status\nwhich it was not entitled to give he will not in law be\ndeemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\ngiven the particular status.\n\n53. In paragraph (14) of the “Umadevi\nCase” judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas elaborately discussed about various orders of the\nCourts either interim orders or final orders which were\nbrought to the notice of the Constitution Bench. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India came to the conclusion\nthat those orders more or less was the issue of\ndirections for continuation or absorption without\nreferring to the legal position obtaining. It was\nbrought to the notice of this Court that chaos has been\ncreated by such orders without reference to the legal\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nprinciples and it is time that this Court settled the law\nonce and for all so that in case the Court finds that\nsuch orders should not be made, the Courts, especially,\nthe High Courts would be precluded from issuing such\ndirections or passing such orders.\n\n54. The very arguments advanced by the\nlearned counsel for the State of Karnataka is that a\nchaos was created on account of various contradicting\norders passed by the High Courts in the matter of\nregularization or permanent absorption in order to\nsettle the legal principles. The learned counsel urged\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to take note of the\nfact that there is a chaos prevailing in respect of the\nregularization and permanent absorption of the\ntemporary/daily wages employees and brought to the\nnotice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the\nHigh Courts would be precluded from issuing any such\ndirections or passing such orders in contrary to the\nlegal principles in the matters of regularization or\npermanent absorption or appointment. The\nobservation made in this regard is that bypassing of\nthe Constitutional scheme cannot be perpetuated by\nthe passing of orders without dealing with and\ndeciding the validity of such orders on the touchstone\nof Constitutionality.\n\n55. Let us come to paragraph (20) of the\n“Umadevi Case” judgment which is extracted\nhereunder:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“20. The decision in Dharwad Distt.\nPWD\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of\nKarnataka\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 :\n\n(1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] dealt with a\nscheme framed by the State of Karnataka, though at\nthe instance of the Court. The scheme was essentially\nrelating to the application of the concept of equal pay\nfor equal work but it also provided for making\npermanent, or what it called regularisation, without\nkeeping the distinction in mind, of employees who had\nbeen appointed ad hoc, casually, temporarily or on\ndaily-wage basis. In other words, employees who had\nbeen appointed without following the procedure\nestablished by law for such appointments. This Court,\nat the threshold, stated that it should individualise\njustice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is not\npossible to accept the statement, unqualified as it\nappears to be. This Court is not only the constitutional\ncourt, it is also the highest court in the country, the\nfinal court of appeal. By virtue of\nArticle 141\nof the\nConstitution, what this Court lays down is the law of\nthe land. Its decisions are binding on all the courts. Its\nmain role is to interpret the constitutional and other\nstatutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\nphilosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto\nourselves a system of governance by rule of law. The\nrole of the Supreme Court is to render justice\naccording to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt is expected to decide questions of law for the\ncountry and not to decide individual cases without\nreference to such principles of law. Consistency is a\nvirtue. Passing orders not consistent with its own\ndecisions on law, is bound to send out confusing signals\nand usher in judicial chaos. Its role, therefore, is really\nto interpret the law and decide cases coming before it,\naccording to law. Orders which are inconsistent with\nthe legal conclusions arrived at by the court in the\nselfsame judgment not only create confusion but also\ntend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the\nstatement, that equity tends to vary with the\nChancellor's foot.”\n\n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad\nDistt.\nPWD Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn.\nVs. State of Karnataka\n, reported in (1990) 2 SCC\n396, was considered in the above paragraph. It is\nobserved that the role of the Court to interpret the law\nand decide cases coming before it, according to law.\nOrders which are inconsistent with the legal\nconclusions arrived at by the Court in the self same\njudgment not only create confusion but also tend to\nusher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that\nequity tends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.\n\n57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India has accepted the decision, the question\nof law for the country and not to decide individual\ncases without reference to such principles of law.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConsistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent\nwith its own decisions on law, is bound to send out\nconfusing signals and result in judicial chaos. The\nobservation made in this regard are certainly to be\nfollowed by all the Courts across the Country.\n\n58.\nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the\nApex Court referred the spirit of\nKesavananda\nBharati Vs. State of Kerala\n, reported in (1973) 4\nSCC 225, the Court held that\nArticle 14\n\n& 16\nwhich\nwas described as a facet of\nArticle 14\nis part of the\nbasic structure of the Constitution.\n\nIn the case of\n\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in\n(2000) 1 SCC 168\n,\nthe said decision\nwas reiterated\nhow neither the Parliament nor the legislature could\ntransgress the basic feature of the Constitution,\nnamely, the principle of equality enshrined in\nArticle\nof which\nArticle 16(1)\nis a facet.\n\n59.\nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in\nthe above said case of\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of\nIndia\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168, it is held that\nequality and equal opportunity is a basis feature of our\nConstitution, has explained the exultant position of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution in the scheme of\nthings.\n\n60. The judgment of the another Constitution\nBench in the case of\nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of\nBihar\n, reported in (1987) 1 SCC 378 and the\nrelevant paragraph (3) is extracted hereunder:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our\nConstitution and it is the essence of the rule of law that\nthe exercise of the power by the State whether it be\nthe legislature or the executive or any other authority\nshould be within the constitutional limitations and if\nany practice is adopted by the executive which is in\nflagrant and systematic violation of its constitutional\nlimitations, Petitioner 1 as a member of the public\nwould have sufficient interest to challenge such\npractice by filing a writ petition and it would be the\nconstitutional duty of this Court to entertain the writ\npetition and adjudicate upon the validity of such\npractice”\n\n61. Let us now look into the way in which the\nConstitution Bench has arrived the conclusion in the\nmatter of regularization and permanent absorption in\n“Umadevi Case” and the relevant paragraphs (43) to\n(50), which all are extracted hereunder:\n\n“43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the\nrule of equality in public employment is a basic feature\nof our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core\nof our Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled\nfrom passing an order upholding a violation of\nArticle\nor in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply\nwith the requirements of\nArticle 14\nread with\nArticle\nof the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the\nscheme for public employment, this Court while laying\ndown the law, has necessarily to hold that unless the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nappointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after\na proper competition among qualified persons, the\nsame would not confer any right on the appointee. If it\nis a contractual appointment, the appointment comes\nto an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual\nbasis, the same would come to an end when it is\ndiscontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could\nnot claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his\nterm of appointment. It has also to be clarified that\nmerely because a temporary employee or a casual\nwage worker is continued for a time beyond the term\nof his appointment, he would not be entitled to be\nabsorbed in regular service or made permanent,\nmerely on the strength of such continuance, if the\noriginal appointment was not made by following a due\nprocess of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\nIt is not open to the court to prevent regular\nrecruitment at the instance of temporary employees\nwhose period of employment has come to an end or of\nad hoc employees who by the very nature of their\nappointment, do not acquire any right. The High\nCourts acting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution,\nshould not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,\nregularisation, or permanent continuance unless the\nrecruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of\nthe constitutional scheme. Merely because an\nemployee had continued under cover of an order of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncourt, which we have described as “litigious\nemployment” in the earlier part of the judgment, he\nwould not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or\nmade permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases,\nthe High Court may not be justified in issuing interim\ndirections, since, after all, if ultimately the employee\napproaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be\npossible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that\nultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas\nan interim direction to continue his employment would\nhold up the regular procedure for selection or impose\non the State the burden of paying an employee who is\nreally not required. The courts must be careful in\nensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the\neconomic arrangement of its affairs by the State or its\ninstrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to\nfacilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and\nstatutory mandates.\n\n44. The concept of “equal pay for equal\nwork” is different from the concept of conferring\npermanency on those who have been appointed on ad\nhoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no process of\nselection as envisaged by the rules. This Court has in\nvarious decisions applied the principle of equal pay for\nequal work and has laid down the parameters for the\napplication of that principle. The decisions are rested\non the concept of equality enshrined in our\nConstitution in the light of the directive principles in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthat behalf. But the acceptance of that principle cannot\nlead to a position where the court could direct that\nappointments made without following the due\nprocedure established by law, be deemed permanent or\nissue directions to treat them as permanent. Doing so,\nwould be negation of the principle of equality of\nopportunity. The power to make an order as is\nnecessary for doing complete justice in any cause or\nmatter pending before this Court, would not normally\nbe used for giving the go-by to the procedure\nestablished by law in the matter of public employment.\nTake the situation arising in the cases before us from\nthe State of Karnataka. Therein, after Dharwad\ndecision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 :\n\n(1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] the\nGovernment had issued repeated directions and\nmandatory orders that no temporary or ad hoc\nemployment or engagement be given. Some of the\nauthorities and departments had ignored those\ndirections or defied those directions and had continued\nto give employment, specifically interdicted by the\norders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing\nofficers have even been punished for their defiance. It\nwould not be just or proper to pass an order in exercise\nof jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nor 32 of the\nConstitution or in exercise of power under\nArticle 142\n\nof the Constitution permitting those persons engaged,\nto be absorbed or to be made permanent, based on\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntheir appointments or engagements. Complete justice\nwould be justice according to law and though it would\nbe open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court\nwould not grant a relief which would amount to\nperpetuating an illegality.\n\n45. While directing that appointments,\ntemporary or casual, be regularised or made\npermanent, the courts are swayed by the fact that the\nperson concerned has worked for some time and in\nsome cases for a considerable length of time. It is not\nas if the person who accepts an engagement either\ntemporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the\nnature of his employment. He accepts the employment\nwith open eyes. It may be true that he is not in a\nposition to bargain—not at arm's length—since he\nmight have been searching for some employment so as\nto eke out his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets.\nBut on that ground alone, it would not be appropriate\nto jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment\nand to take the view that a person who has temporarily\nor casually got employed should be directed to be\ncontinued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\nanother mode of public appointment which is not\npermissible. If the court were to void a contractual\nemployment of this nature on the ground that the\nparties were not having equal bargaining power, that\ntoo would not enable the court to grant any relief to\nthat employee. A total embargo on such casual or\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntemporary employment is not possible, given the\nexigencies of administration and if imposed, would\nonly mean that some people who at least get\nemployment temporarily, contractually or casually,\nwould not be getting even that employment when\nsecuring of such employment brings at least some\nsuccour to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our\nvast country are in search of employment and one is\nnot compelled to accept a casual or temporary\nemployment if one is not inclined to go in for such an\nemployment. It is in that context that one has to\nproceed on the basis that the employment was\naccepted fully knowing the nature of it and the\nconsequences flowing from it. In other words, even\nwhile accepting the employment, the person concerned\nknows the nature of his employment. It is not an\nappointment to a post in the real sense of the term.\nThe claim acquired by him in the post in which he is\ntemporarily employed or the interest in that post\ncannot be considered to be of such a magnitude as to\nenable the giving up of the procedure established, for\nmaking regular appointments to available posts in the\nservices of the State. The argument that since one has\nbeen working for some time in the post, it will not be\njust to discontinue him, even though he was aware of\nthe nature of the employment when he first took it up,\nis not one that would enable the jettisoning of the\nprocedure established by law for public employment\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nand would have to fail when tested on the touchstone\nof constitutionality and equality of opportunity\nenshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the\nrespondents argued that on the basis of the doctrine of\nlegitimate expectation, the employees, especially of the\nCommercial Taxes Department, should be directed to\nbe regularised since the decisions in Dharwad [(1990)\n2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC\n902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] , Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC\n118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21 ATC 403 :\n\n(1992) 3 SCR 826] , Jacob [Jacob M. Puthuparambil v.\n\nKerala Water Authority, (1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC\n(L&S) 25 : (\n1991) 15 ATC 697] and Gujarat\nAgricultural University [Gujarat Agricultural University\nv. Rathod Labhu Bechar\n, (2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC\n(L&S) 613] and the like, have given rise to an\nexpectation in them that their services would also be\nregularised. The doctrine can be invoked if the\ndecisions of the administrative authority affect the\nperson by depriving him of some benefit or advantage\nwhich either (i) he had in the past been permitted by\nthe decision-maker to enjoy and which he can\nlegitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do\nuntil there have been communicated to him some\nrational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has\nbeen given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has\nreceived assurance from the decision-maker that they\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwill not be withdrawn without giving him first an\nopportunity of advancing reasons for contending that\nthey should not be withdrawn.\n\n[See Lord Diplock in\nCouncil for Civil Services Union v. Minister of Civil\nService [1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 : (\n1984) 3\nWLR 1174 (HL)] , National Buildings Construction\nCorpn. v. S. Raghunathan\n[(1998) 7 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC\n(L&S) 1770] and Chanchal Goyal (Dr.) v. State of\nRajasthan [(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .]\nThere is no case that any assurance was given by the\nGovernment or the department concerned while\nmaking the appointment on daily wages that the status\nconferred on him will not be withdrawn until some\nrational reason comes into existence for withdrawing\nit. The very engagement was against the constitutional\nscheme. Though, the Commissioner of the Commercial\nTaxes Department sought to get the appointments\nmade permanent, there is no case that at the time of\nappointment any promise was held out. No such\npromise could also have been held out in view of the\ncirculars and directives issued by the Government\nafter Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC\n(L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] .\nThough, there is a case that the State had made\nregularisations in the past of similarly situated\nemployees, the fact remains that such regularisations\nwere done only pursuant to judicial directions, either\nof the Administrative Tribunal or of the High Court and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nin some cases by this Court. Moreover, the invocation\nof the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable\nthe employees to claim that they must be made\npermanent or they must be regularised in the service\nthough they had not been selected in terms of the rules\nfor appointment. The fact that in certain cases the\ncourt had directed regularisation of the employees\ninvolved in those cases cannot be made use of to found\na claim based on legitimate expectation. The argument\nif accepted would also run counter to the constitutional\nmandate. The argument in that behalf has therefore to\nbe rejected.\n\n47. When a person enters a temporary\nemployment or gets engagement as a contractual or\ncasual worker and the engagement is not based on a\nproper selection as recognised by the relevant rules or\nprocedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\nappointment being temporary, casual or contractual in\nnature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of\nlegitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post\nwhen an appointment to the post could be made only\nby following a proper procedure for selection and in\ncases concerned, in consultation with the Public\nService Commission. Therefore, the theory of\nlegitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced\nby temporary, contractual or casual employees. It\ncannot also be held that the State has held out any\npromise while engaging these persons either to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncontinue them where they are or to make them\npermanent. The State cannot constitutionally make\nsuch a promise. It is also obvious that the theory\ncannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of being\nmade permanent in the post.\n\n48. It was then contended that the rights of\nthe employees thus appointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are violated. It is stated that the\nState has treated the employees unfairly by employing\nthem on less than minimum wages and extracting work\nfrom them for a pretty long period in comparison with\nthose directly recruited who are getting more wages or\nsalaries for doing similar work. The employees before\nus were engaged on daily wages in the department\nconcerned on a wage that was made known to them.\nThere is no case that the wage agreed upon was not\nbeing paid. Those who are working on daily wages\nformed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that\nthey are discriminated as against those who have been\nregularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.\nNo right can be founded on an employment on daily\nwages to claim that such employee should be treated\non a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and\nmade permanent in employment, even assuming that\nthe principle could be invoked for claiming equal\nwages for equal work. There is no fundamental right in\nthose who have been employed on daily wages or\ntemporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nhave a right to be absorbed in service. As has been\nheld by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of\na post, since, a regular appointment could be made\nonly by making appointments consistent with the\nrequirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\nThe right to be treated equally with the other\nemployees employed on daily wages, cannot be\nextended to a claim for equal treatment with those who\nwere regularly employed. That would be treating\nunequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to claim\na right to be absorbed in service even though they\nhave never been selected in terms of the relevant\nrecruitment rules. The arguments based on\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution are therefore overruled.\n\n49. It is contended that the State action in\nnot regularising the employees was not fair within the\nframework of the rule of law. The rule of law compels\nthe State to make appointments as envisaged by the\nConstitution and in the manner we have indicated\nearlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the employees\nhad worked for some length of time but this has also\nbeen brought about by the pendency of proceedings in\ntribunals and courts initiated at the instance of the\nemployees. Moreover, accepting an argument of this\nnature would mean that the State would be permitted\nto perpetuate an illegality in the matter of public\nemployment and that would be a negation of the\nconstitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nIndia. It is therefore not possible to accept the\nargument that there must be a direction to make\npermanent all the persons employed on daily wages.\nWhen the court is approached for relief by way of a\nwrit, the court has necessarily to ask itself whether the\nperson before it had any legal right to be enforced.\nConsidered in the light of the very clear constitutional\nscheme, it cannot be said that the employees have\nbeen able to establish a legal right to be made\npermanent even though they have never been\nappointed in terms of the relevant rules or in\nadherence of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n50. It is argued that in a country like India\nwhere there is so much poverty and unemployment\nand there is no equality of bargaining power, the action\nof the State in not making the employees permanent,\nwould be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. But\nthe very argument indicates that there are so many\nwaiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\ncompeting for employment and it is in that context that\nthe Constitution as one of its basic features, has\nincluded\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nso as to ensure that\npublic employment is given only in a fair and equitable\nmanner by giving all those who are qualified, an\nopportunity to seek employment. In the guise of\nupholding rights under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, a\nset of persons cannot be preferred over a vast majority\nof people waiting for an opportunity to compete for\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nState employment. The acceptance of the argument on\nbehalf of the respondents would really negate the\nrights of the others conferred by\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution, assuming that we are in a position to hold\nthat the right to employment is also a right coming\nwithin the purview of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.\nThe argument that\nArticle 23\nof the Constitution is\nbreached because the employment on daily wages\namounts to forced labour, cannot be accepted. After\nall, the employees accepted the employment at their\nown volition and with eyes open as to the nature of\ntheir employment. The Governments also revised the\nminimum wages payable from time to time in the light\nof all relevant circumstances. It also appears to us that\nimporting of these theories to defeat the basic\nrequirement of public employment would defeat the\nconstitutional scheme and the constitutional goal of\nequality.”\n\n62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that\nadherence to the rule of equality in public employment\nis a basic feature of our Constitution when it is\nclarified that adherence to the rule of equality in public\nemployment is a basic feature of the Constitution,\ncertainly, no person can deviate the principles in this\nregard and therefore, appointment in accordance with\nthe recruitment rules in force by the competent\nauthorities is the constitutional mandate and any\ndeviation to be construed as violation of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nconstitutional principles. It is observed that if it is a\ncontractual appointment, the appointment comes to an\nend at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual\nbasis, the same would come to an end when it is\ndiscontinued. Similarly temporary employee could not\nclaim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term\nof appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely\nbecause a temporary employee or a casual wage\nworker is continued for a time beyond the term of his\nappointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed\nin regular service or made appointment, merely on the\nstrength of such continuance, if the original\nappointment was not made by following a due process\nof selection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\n63. It is not open to the court to prevent\nregular recruitment at the instance of temporary\nemployees whose period of employment has come to\nan end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature\nof their appointment do not acquire any right. The\nHigh Courts acting under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for\nabsorption, regularization, or permanent continuance\nunless the recruitment itself was made regularly and in\nterms of constitutional scheme.\n\n64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable\nto the facts and circumstances of the present writ\npetition on hand. In the present writ petition, the writ\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npetitioners were appointed on daily wage basis as\nNominal Muster Rolls employees. The mere\ncontinuance or the length of service rendered alone\ncannot be a ground for granting the relief of\nregularization. Thus, the very legal principles settled\nby the Constitution Bench has to be fit in with the facts\nand circumstances of the present writ petition.\nFurther, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deals with\nthe “litigious employment”. Of course, the situation\ndoes not arise in the present case. The interim order\nof Status Quo granted by this Court has not been\nproperly implemented by reinstating the petitioners in\nservice and the Contempt petition filed by the writ\npetitioners were also posted along with the writ\npetition for final disposal. Thus, the concept of\n“litigious employment” would not arise in respect of\nthe present writ petition. Therefore, the petitioners\nhave not continued in service by virtue of the interim\norder of Status Quo granted by this Court. However,\ntheir services were ousted, after filing of the writ\npetition.\n\n65. Paragraph (44) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment deals with the concept of “equal pay for\nequal work”. Thus, it may not be required to elaborate\nthe paragraph as far as the present case on hand is\nconcerned.\n\n66. Paragraph (45) of the above said\njudgment states that the Apex Court of India held that,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhile directing that appointments, temporary or\ncasual, be regularized or made permanent, the Courts\nare swayed by the fact that the person concerned has\nworked for some time and in some cases for a\nconsiderable length of time. It is not as if the person\nwho accepts an engagement either temporary or\ncasual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his\nemployment. He accepts the employment with open\neyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to\nbargain- not at arm's length – Since he might have\nbeen searching for some employment so as to eke out\nhis livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on\nthat ground alone, it would not be appropriate to\njettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and\nto take the view that a person who has temporarily or\ncasually got employed should be directed to be\ncontinued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\nanother mode of public appointment which is not\npermissible. A total embargo of such casual or\ntemporary employment is not possible, given the\nexigencies of administration and if imposed, would\nonly mean that some people who at least get\nemployment temporarily, contractually or casually,\nwould not be getting even that employment when\nsecuring of such employment brings at least some\nsuccour to them.\n\n67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast\ncountry are in search of employment and one is not\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncompelled to accept a casual or temporary employment\nif one is not inclined to go in for such an employment.\nIt is in this context that one has to proceed on the basis\nthat the employment was accepted fully knowing the\nnature of it and the consequences flowing from it. In\nother words, even while accepting the employment, the\nperson concerned knows the nature of his employment.\nIt is not an appointment to a post in the real sense of\nthe term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\nwhich he is temporarily employed or the interest in\nthat post cannot be considered to be of such a\nmagnitude, so as to enable the giving up of the\nprocedure established, for making regular\nappointments to available posts in the services of the\nState.\n\n68. In Paragraph (46) of the “Umadevi\nCase” judgment, their Lordships held that the\ninvocation of the doctrine of legitimate expectation\ncannot enable the employees to claim that they must\nbe made permanent or they must be regularised in the\nservice though they had not been selected in terms of\nthe rules for appointment. The fact that in certain\ncases the court had directed regularization of the\nemployees involved in those cases cannot be made use\nof, to found a claim based on legitimate expectation.\nThe argument if accepted would also run counter to\nthe constitutional mandate. The argument in that\nbehalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n69. Paragraph (47) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment enumerates that when a person enters a\ntemporary employment or gets engagement as a\ncontractual or casual worker and the engagement is\nnot based on a proper selection as recognised by the\nrelevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the\nconsequences of the appointment being temporary,\ncasual or contractual in nature. Such a person cannot\ninvoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being\nconfirmed in the post when an appointment to the post\ncould be made only by following a proper procedure\nfor selection and in cases concerned, in consultation\nwith the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the\ntheory of legitimate expectation cannot be successfully\nadvanced by temporary, contractual or casual\nemployees.\n\n70. In paragraph (48) of the “Umadevi\nCase” Judgment, the Constitution Bench considered\nthe right of the employees thus appointed, under\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are violated.\nEven in “Umadevi Case”, those employees before the\nSupreme Court of India were engaged on daily wages\nin the department concerned on a daily wage that was\nmade known to them. There is no case that the wage\nagreed upon was not being paid. Those who are\nworking on daily wages formed a class by themselves,\nthey cannot claim that they are discriminated as\nagainst those who have been regularly recruited on the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbasis of the relevant rules. No right can be founded on\nan employment on daily wages to claim that such\nemployee should be treated on par with a regularly\nrecruited candidate, and made permanent in\nemployment, even assuming that the principle could be\ninvoked for claiming equal wages for equal work.\nThere is no fundamental right for those who have been\nemployed on daily wages or temporarily or on\ncontractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be\nabsorbed in service. As has been held by this Court,\nthey cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a\nregular appointment could be made only by making\nappointments consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n71. In paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule\nof law compels the State to make appointments as\nenvisaged by the Constitution and in the manner we\nhave indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nin the judgment of “Umadevi Case”. When the Court\nis approached by way of a writ, the Court has\nnecessarily to ask itself whether the person before it\nhad any legal right to be enforced. Even, the\nConstitution Bench dealt with the\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution of India, in a Country like India, where\nthere is so much poverty and unemployment and there\nis no equality of bargaining power, the action of the\nState in not making the employees permanent, would\nbe violative of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. But the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nvery argument indicates that there are so many\nwaiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\ncompeting for employment and it is in that context, the\nConstitution as one of its basic features, has included\nArticles 14,16 and 309 so as to ensure that public\nemployment is given only in a fair and equitable\nmanner by giving all those who are qualified, an\nopportunity to seek employment. In the guise of\nupholding rights under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, a\nset of persons cannot be preferred over a vast majority\nof people waiting for an opportunity to compete for\nState employment.\n\n72. Now, let us look into the important\nparagraph urged by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, i.e., paragraph (53) of the Judgment of\n“Umadevi Case”.\n\nParagraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There\nmay be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal\nappointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappa\n[(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\nNanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799]\nand B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n(L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] and referred to in para 15\nabove, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\nvacant posts might have been made and the employees\nhave continued to work for ten years or more but\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwithout the intervention of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\nof such employees may have to be considered on\nmerits in the light of the principles settled by this\nCourt in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of\nthis judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\nState Governments and their instrumentalities should\ntake steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the\nservices of such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts\nbut not under cover of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals and should further ensure that regular\nrecruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases\nwhere temporary employees or daily wagers are being\nnow employed. The process must be set in motion\nwithin six months from this date. We also clarify that\nregularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice,\nneed not be reopened based on this judgment, but\nthere should be no further bypassing of the\nconstitutional requirement and regularising or making\npermanent, those not duly appointed as per the\nconstitutional scheme.”\n\n73. The above said paragraph (53) of the\n“Umadevi Case” is a one time relief, of Course,\ngranted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to\nmitigate the hardship, if any, caused to the temporary\nemployees. Now, the question arises how long the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbenefit granted under paragraph (53) can be extended\nto the employees and what is the interpretation of the\nsubsequent judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in respect of paragraph (53) of the judgment of\nthe Constitution Bench.\n\n74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India, while stopping the\nentire irregular appointments and back door\nappointments had taken note of the fact that certain\nreliefs are required in respect of the employees who\nare already regularized or in respect of those persons,\na proposal is already kept pending. Certainly, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India have never intended to\ngrant the relief of regularization or permanent\nabsorption in public employment contrary to the legal\nprinciples settled in earlier paragraphs. Thus,\nparagraph (53) of the judgment has to be understood\nharmoniously and together with the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in earlier\nparagraphs.\n\n75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted\nopinion that paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment cannot be treated as an isolation and it\nshould be considered along with the other legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench. Keeping\nin mind, the legal principles settled by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in earlier paragraphs, this\nCourt is of the opinion that one time relief granted by\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to be extended\nin its real sense and the High Courts cannot travel\nbeyond the scope of the intention expressed by the\nConstitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner\ncited the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the case of\nU.P.State Electricity Board Vs.\nPooran Chandra Pandey and Others\n, reported in\n(2007) 11 SCC 92, and the paragraph (11) of the\njudgment is relevant and is extracted hereunder:\n\n“11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon\nthe decision of this Court in\nSecy., State of Karnataka\nv. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nand has urged that no direction for regularisation can\nbe given by the Court. In our opinion, the decision in\nUmadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] is clearly distinguishable. The said decision\ncannot be applied to a case where regularisation has\nbeen sought for in pursuance of\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution.”\n\n77. In the above said case, the Hon'ble Two\nJudges Bench distinguished that case with the\n“Umadevi Case”. The very language used in\nParagraph (11) states that “in our opinion, the decision\nin “Umadevi Case” is clearly distinguishable. The\nsaid decision cannot be applied to a case where\nregularization has been sought for in pursuance of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. However, this Court is\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof the opinion that their Lordships have distinguished\nthe “Umadevi Case” in respect of the facts and\ncircumstances that the case. When their Lordships\nhave distinguished that case, this Court is of the\nopinion that the legal principles settled in “Umadevi\nCase” has not been deviated by the Hon'ble Two\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,\nas it is a “binding precedent” as stated by this Court in\nearlier paragraphs.\n\n78. “Umadevi Case” being a “binding\nprecedent” and when the case was distinguished from\n“Umadevi Case” on factual circumstances, the same\ncannot be applied in the present case before this\nCourt.\n\n79. The judgment in the case of State of\nUttaranchal and another Vs. Prantiya Sinchai\nAvam Bandh Yogana Shramik Mahaparishad,\nreported in (2007) 12 SCC 483 and the relevant\nparagraph (5) is cited by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner which is extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. A writ petition was filed before the\nUttaranchal High Court which was dismissed by the\nimpugned order. The High Court was of the view that\nall the 14 workmen, in question, were working on daily\nwages for more than six years and had completed 240\ndays in each calendar year and they ought to be\nregularised. Accordingly, the writ petition was\ndismissed.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n80. On a perusal of the above said judgment,\nthis Court is of the opinion that the case relates to an\naward passed by the Labour Court and an Award\npassed by the Labour Court under the provisions of the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, cannot have any relevance in\nrespect of the Government employments made by\nvirtue of the rules framed by the State in this regard.\nHowever, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in that\ncase, remanded the matter back for reconsideration by\nthe High Court in the light of the legal principles\nsettled in the “Umadevi Case”. Thus, in all respects,\nthe case cannot have any application in respect of the\nfacts and circumstances of the present writ petition.\n\n81. It has further cited the case of\nState of\nKarnataka and Others Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others\n,\nreported in (2010) 9 SCC 247 and the relevant\nparagraph (7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is\nan exception to the general principles against\n“regularisation” enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\nyears or more in duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court\nor tribunal. In other words, the State Government or\nits instrumentality should have employed the employee\nand continued him in service voluntarily and\ncontinuously for more than ten years.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\nwas working against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n82. In\nthe above case\n, an exception has been\ncarved out in relation to the one time relief granted in\nparagraph (15) of the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n83. In the case of State of Rajastan and\nOthers Vs. Daya Lal and Others, reported in\n(2011) 2 SCC 429 and the relevant paragraph (12),\nenumerates the settled principles in respect of\nregularization and parity in pay, relevant in the context\nof the case and those principles carved out in\nparagraph (12) of the above judgment are akin to that\nof the legal principles settled by the Constitution\nBench in “Umadevi Case”.\n\n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner\nsolicited the attention of this Court relying the case\ndecided by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\nNihal\nSingh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nreported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and the paragraph\n(31) and (33) of the judgments are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\nprocess of selection adopted in identifying the\nappellants herein cannot be said to be unreasonable or\narbitrary in the sense that it was devised to eliminate\nother eligible candidates. It may be worthwhile to note\nthat in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] ,\nthis Court was dealing with appointments made\nwithout following any rational procedure in the lower\nrungs of various services of the Union and the States.\n\n33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the\nneed to employ a certain number of people for\ndischarging a particular responsibility of the State\nunder the Constitution is always with the executive\ngovernment of the day subject to the overall control of\nthe legislature. That does not mean that an\nexamination by a constitutional court regarding the\naccuracy of the assessment of the need is barred.”\n\n85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this\nCourt is of an undoubted opinion that there is a slight\ndeviation in respect of the legal principles carved out\nby the Hon'ble Constitution Bench in “Umadevi\nCase”. This Court wishes to remind the language used\nby the Constitution Bench in paragraph (5) of\n“Umadevi Case”. To reiterate the language used by\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India emphatically in\nparagraph (5) that this Court has also occasions to\nissue directions which could not be said to be consisted\nby the public employment. Such directions are issued\npresumably on the basis of equitable consideration or\nindividualization of justice. The question arises, equity\nto whom? Equity for the handful of people who have\napproached the Court with a claim, or equity for the\nteeming millions of this Country seeking employment\nand seeking a fair opportunity for competing for\nemployment?\n\n86. In paragraph (54) of the said “Umadevi\nCase” judgment, again the Constitution Bench\nreiterated that “It is also clarified that those decisions\nwhich run counter to the principle settled in this\ndecision, or in which directions running counter to\nwhat we have held herein, will stand denuded of their\nstatus as precedents.”\n\n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding\nthat the judgment cited by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner in the case of\nNihal Singh and Others Vs.\nState of Punjab and Others\n, reported in (2013) 14\nSCC 65, is to be considered as denuded of their status\nas precedents. Thus, this Court is not inclined to\nconsider and follow the same.\n\n88.\nIn the case of\nAmarendra Kumar\nMohapatra and others Vs. State of Orissa and\nothers\n, reported in (2014) 4 SCC 583, the Hon'ble\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nTwo Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of India held\nthat and the paragraphs (42) & (43) of the above said\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] , as noticed earlier, permitted\nregularisation of regular appointments and not illegal\nappointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is whether the\nappointments in the instant case could be described as\nillegal and if they were not, whether the State could be\ndirected to regularise the services of the degree-holder\nJunior Engineers who have worked as ad hoc Assistant\nEngineers for such a long period, not only on the\nanalogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation\nbut also on the principle underlying para 53 of the\ndecision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\n43.As to what would constitute an irregular\nappointment is no longer res integra. The decision of\nthis Court in\nState of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010)\n9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , has examined\nthat question and explained the principle regarding\nregularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3) case\n[\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . The decision\nin that case\n\nsummed up the following three essentials for\nregularisation: (1) the employees have worked for ten\nyears or more, (2) that they have so worked in a duly\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the\ninterim order of any court or tribunal, and (3) they\nshould have possessed the minimum qualification\nstipulated for the appointment. Subject to these three\nrequirements being satisfied, even if the appointment\nprocess did not involve open competitive selection, the\nappointment would be treated irregular and not illegal\nand thereby qualify for regularisation.\n\nPara 7 in this\nregard is apposite and may be extracted at this stage:\n(\nM.L. Kesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC\n(L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250)\n“7.\n\nIt is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n‘regularisation’ enunciated in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\nyears or more in a duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court\nor tribunal. In other words, the State Government or\nits instrumentality should have employed the employee\nand continued him in service voluntarily and\ncontinuously for more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\nwas working against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n89. It is important to cite the case of\nSECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, SCHOOL\nEDUCATION DEPARTMENT,CHENNAI v.\n\nR.GOVINDASWAMY AND ORS.[ (2014) 4 SCC\n769]. In paragraph No.(8), the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nhas observed as follows:\n\n“8.this Court in\nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal &\nOrs.\n, AIR 2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of\nregularisation of irregular or part-time appointments in\nall possible eventualities and laid down well-settled\nprinciples relating to regularisation and parity in pay\nrelevant in the context of the issues involved therein.\nThe same are as under:\n\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle\nof the Constitution will not issue directions for\nregularisation, absorption or permanent continuance,\nunless the employees claiming regularisation had been\nappointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in\naccordance with relevant rules in an open competitive\nprocess, against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality\nclause contained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be\nscrupulously followed and Courts should not issue a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndirection for regularisation of services of an employee\nwhich would be violative of the constitutional scheme.\n\nWhile something that is irregular for want of\ncompliance with one of the elements in the process of\nselection which does not go to the root of the process,\ncan be regularised, back door entries, appointments\ncontrary to the constitutional scheme and/or\nappointment of ineligible candidates cannot be\nregularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad\nhoc or daily-wage employee, under cover of some\ninterim orders of the court, would not confer upon him\nany right to be absorbed into service, as such service\nwould be “litigious employment”. Even temporary, ad\nhoc or daily-wage service for a long number of years,\nlet alone service for one or two years, will not entitle\nsuch employee to claim regularisation, if he is not\nworking against a sanctioned post. Sympathy and\nsentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be grounds for passing any\norder of regularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for\nregularisation with a cut-off date (that is a scheme\nproviding that persons who had put in a specified\nnumber of years of service and continuing in\nemployment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible to\nothers who were appointed subsequent to the cut-off\ndate, to claim or contend that the scheme should be\napplied to them by extending the cut-off date or seek a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndirection for framing of fresh schemes providing for\nsuccessive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek\nregularisation as they are not working against any\nsanctioned posts. There cannot be a direction for\nabsorption, regularisation or permanent continuance of\npart-time temporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run\ninstitutions cannot claim parity in salary with regular\nemployees of the Government on the principle of equal\npay for equal work. Nor can employees in private\nemployment, even if serving full time, seek parity in\nsalary with government employees. The right to claim\na particular salary against the State must arise under a\ncontract or under a statute.” (Emphasis added) “\n\n90. Reiterating the principles\nlaid down in\nthe\n\nCase of Secretary to Government, School\nEducation Department, Chennai Vs.\nR.Govindaswamy and others\n, reported in (2014) 4\nSCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nemphatically ruled that the High Courts, in exercising\npower under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India\nwill not issue directions for regularization, absorption\nor permanent continuance. Unless the employees\nclaiming regularization had been appointed in\npursuance of a regular recruitment in accordance with\nrelevant rules in an open competitive process against\nsanctioned vacant posts, the equality clause contained\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nin\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously followed\nand Courts should not issue a direction for\nregularization of services of an employee which would\nbe violative of the Constitutional scheme.\n\n91.\nIn the case of\nNand Kumar Vs. State of\nBihar and Others\n, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 300,\nparagraph (25) & (26) are extracted hereunder:\n\n“25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid\ndecisions of this Court. The principle as has been\nlaid\ndown in\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has also\nbeen applied in relation to the persons who were\nworking on daily wages. According to us, the daily\nwagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the\nterm “appointment”. They do not hold a post. The\nscheme of alternative appointment framed for regular\nemployees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore,\nconfer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of\nabolished organisation to such alternative employment.\n\n(See\nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n[(2006) 4\nSCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] ) Their relevance in\nthe context of appointment arose by reason of the\nconcept of regularisation as a source of appointment.\n\nAfter Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , their position\ncontinued to be that of daily wagers. Appointment on\ndaily-wage basis is not an appointment to a post\naccording to the rules. Usually, the projects in which\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe daily wagers were engaged, having come to an\nend, their appointment is necessarily terminated for\nwant of work. Therefore, the status and rights of daily\nwagers of a government concern are not equivalent to\nthat of a government servant and his claim to\npermanency has to be adjudged differently.\n\n26.In these circumstances, in our considered\nopinion, the regularisation/absorption is not a matter\nof course. It would depend upon the facts of the case\nfollowing the rules and regulations and cannot be\ndehors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.”\n\n92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion\nthat the above two paragraphs are running contrary to\nthe legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Thus, the rules\n\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution Bench\nto be applied in respect of\nthe above case\ncited.\n\n93.\nIn the case of\nMalathi Das and Others,\nVs. Suresh and Others\n, reported in (2014) 13 SCC\n249 and the relevant paragraph (13) is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is\nwholly unnecessary for us to consider as to whether\nthe cases of persons who were awaiting regularisation\non the date of the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] is required to be dealt with in accordance\nwith the conditions stipulated in para 53 of Umadevi\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(\n3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC\n1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] inasmuch as the claims of the\nrespondent employees can well be decided on\nprinciples of parity.\n\nSimilarly placed employees having\nbeen regularised by the State and in case of some of\nthem such regularisation being after the decision in\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006)\n4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we are of the view that\nthe stand taken by the appellants in refusing\nregularisation to the respondents cannot be\ncountenanced.\n\nHowever, as the said stand of the\nappellants stems from their perception and\nunderstanding of the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] we do not hold them liable for contempt\nbut make it clear that the appellants and all the other\ncompetent authorities of the State will now be obliged\nand duty-bound to regularise the services of the\nrespondents (74 in number) which will now be done\nforthwith and in any case within a period of two\nmonths from the date of receipt of this order.”\n\n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once\nagain taken a deviation in respect of the legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India. Therefore, such\ndeviation to be held as denuded of their status as\nprecedent, as\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of the\nConstitution Bench.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n95.\nIn the case of\nAmarkant Rai Vs. State\nof Bihar and Others\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC\n265, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in paragraph\n(11) and (14) are held as follows:\n\n“11.Elaborating upon the principles\nlaid\ndown in\nUmadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] and explaining the difference between\nirregular and illegal appointments in\nState of\nKarnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2\nSCC (L&S) 826] , this Court held as under: (\nM.L.\nKesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n826] , SCC p. 250, para 7)\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n‘regularisation’ enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the following\nconditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\nyears or more in duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court\nor tribunal. In other words, the State Government or\nits instrumentality should have employed the employee\nand continued him in service voluntarily and\ncontinuously for more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\nwas working against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n14.Considering the facts and circumstances\nof the case that the appellant has served the University\nfor more than 29 years on the post of night guard and\nthat he has served the College on daily wages, in the\ninterest of justice, the authorities are directed to\nregularise the services of the appellant retrospectively\nw.e.f. 3-1-2002 (the date on which he rejoined the post\nas per the direction of the Registrar).\"\n\n96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited\njudgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held\nthat the appellant has served in the University for\nmore than 29 years in the post of night guard and that\nhe has served the College on daily wages, in the\ninterest of justice, the authorities are directed to\nregularise the services of the appellant retrospectively\nw.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\n97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India has deviated the principles\nlaid\ndown in\n“Umadevi Case”. Thus, this Court has to\nderive an opinion that the decision would be denuded\nof its status as precedents. For all these reasons, this\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt has to independently apply the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi\nCase”.\n\n98.\nIn the case of\nPrem Ram Vs. Managing\nDirector, Uttarakhand Pey Jal & Nirman Nigam,\nDehradun and Others\n, reported in (2015) 11 SCC\n255, undoubtedly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas decided the case based on the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. However, on a plain\nreading of the judgment, this Court is of the opinion\nthat the legal principles settled by the Constitution\nBench has not been considered by the Hon'ble Two\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\nThus, this Court is not inclined to follow the judgment\nfor the purpose of deciding the case on hand.\n\n99.\nIn the case of\nSurendra Kumar and\nOthers Vs. Greater Noida Industrial Development\nAuthority and Others\n, reported in (2015) 14 SCC\n382, while, the Supreme Court of India in paragraph\n(13) held as follows:\n\n“13.Considering the facts of the present case\non the touchstone\nlaid down in\nUmadevi (3) case [\nState\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] , it will be seen that the Division\nBench was not right in setting aside the appointment of\nthe appellants. More so, it was nobody's case\nchallenging the appointment of the appellants.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nAdmittedly, the appellants were engaged as\ncontractual employees from 1994 and have completed\nmore than ten years of continuous service with\nRespondent 1. They continued in service not by the\norders of the Court/Tribunal, but by the decision of the\nrespondents. The appellants were regularised as per\nthe policy decision dated 16-4-2003 taken by\nRespondent 1 and approved by the State Government\nvide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the appointment of\nthe appellants were made pursuant to the policy of\nregularisation, the High Court was not right in\nquashing the appointment of the appellants as the\nsame were never in question before the High Court.\nThe plea that was raised by the appellants was only to\nseek regularisation with retrospective effect from\n20-11-2002 and the consequential seniority.”\n\n100. In this case also, the Hon'ble Two\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas taken note of the one time benefit granted by the\nConstitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the Judgment\nin “Umadevi Case”. However, the legal principles\nsettled in paragraphs 5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to 50 and\n54 of the judgment has not been considered by their\nLordships. Since the legal principles enunciated in the\nabove paragraphs of the Constitution Bench has not\nbeen considered and the case was decided based on\nthe particular facts and circumstances of the case, this\nCourt is not bound to consider it as a “binding\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nprecedent” as enumerated in the first portion of this\nJudgment. This Court has earlier considered the\nnature of the “binding precedents” and the\ninterpretation of binding precedents as enumerated by\nthe Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India in the recent case of\nNational Insurance Co.\nLtd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n, reported in [JT\n2017 10 SC 450] cited supra.\n\n101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is\nable to find out that those cases by the Hon'ble Two\nJudges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India were\ndecided based on certain facts and circumstances of\nthe case. However, all those circumstances and the\nlegal principles were well settled by the Constitution\nBench in “Umadevi Case”. Various paragraphs of the\nConstitution Bench judgment as discussed above made\nit very clear that all the circumstances arisen out of\nthe temporary/casual/daily wages employees were\ndealt with elaborately and a findings are provided.\nThis being the factum of the case, this Court is not\ninclined to follow the above judgment of the Hon'ble\nTwo Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia as a “binding precedent” and this Court is bound\nby the legal principles settled by the Constitution\nBench in “Umadevi Case” which remains as the law\nof the land under\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution of\nIndia.\n\n102. This Court is willing to cite another\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\njudgment of the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\nPunjab\nWater Supply & Sewerage Board Vs. Ranjodh\nSingh and Others\n, reported in (2007) 2 SCC Page\n\n491. In the above judgment paragraph (17) & (18) are\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“17.A combined reading of the aforementioned\nparagraphs would clearly indicate that what the\nConstitution Bench had in mind in directing\nregularisation was in relation to such appointments,\nwhich were irregular in nature and not illegal ones.\n\n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is\nexplicit. It has been so pointed out in\nNational\nFertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n[(2006) 5 SCC 493 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms: (SCC\npp. 500-01, paras 23-25)\n“23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing\non behalf of the respondents that the appointments\nwere irregular and not illegal, cannot be accepted for\nmore than one reason. They were appointed only on\nthe basis of their applications. The Recruitment Rules\nwere not followed. Even the Selection Committee had\nnot been properly constituted. In view of the ban on\nemployment, no recruitment was permissible in law.\nThe reservation policy adopted by the appellant had\nnot been maintained. Even cases of minorities had not\nbeen given due consideration.\n\n24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nregularisation of the services only of those employees\nwhose appointments were irregular as explained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa [AIR 1967 SC\n1071 : (1967) 1 SCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T.\nThimmiah [(1972) 1 SCC 409] and B.N.

Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4\nSCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] this Court clearly held\nthat the words “regular” or “regularisation” do not\nconnote permanence and cannot be construed so as to\nconvey an idea of the nature of tenure of\nappointments. They are terms calculated to condone\nany procedural irregularities and are meant to cure\nonly such defects as are attributable to methodology\nfollowed in making the appointments.’\n\n25. Judged by the standards\nlaid down by\nthis Court in\nthe aforementioned decisions, the appointments of the\nrespondents are illegal.\n\nThey do not, thus, have any\nlegal right to continue in service.”\n(See also\nState of M.P. v.

The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has dealt with the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ninterpretation of paragraphs 16, 17, 19 and 22 of\n“Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (16), (17), (19)\nand (22) are extracted hereunder:\n\n“16.\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR\n937] this Court clearly held that the words “regular” or\n“regularisation” do not connote permanence and\ncannot be construed so as to convey an idea of the\nnature of tenure of appointments. They are terms\ncalculated to condone any procedural irregularities\nand are meant to cure only such defects as are\nattributable to methodology followed in making the\nappointments. This Court emphasised that when rules\nframed under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution are in\nforce, no regularisation is permissible in exercise of\nthe executive powers of the Government under\nArticle\nof the Constitution in contravention of the rules.\n\nThese decisions and the principles recognised therein\nhave not been dissented to by this Court and on\nprinciple, we see no reason not to accept the\nproposition as enunciated in the above decisions. We\nhave, therefore, to keep this distinction in mind and\nproceed on the basis that only something that is\nirregular for want of compliance with one of the\nelements in the process of selection which does not go\nto the root of the process, can be regularised and that\nit alone can be regularised and granting permanence\nof employment is a totally different concept and cannot\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbe equated with regularisation.\n\n17. We have already indicated the constitutional\nscheme of public employment in this country, and the\nexecutive, or for that matter the court, in appropriate\ncases, would have only the right to regularise an\nappointment made after following the due procedure,\neven though a non-fundamental element of that\nprocess or procedure has not been followed. This right\nof the executive and that of the court would not extend\nto the executive or the court being in a position to\ndirect that an appointment made in clear violation of\nthe constitutional scheme, and the statutory rules\nmade in that behalf, can be treated as permanent or\ncan be directed to be treated as permanent.\n\n19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also\ncontrolled by economic considerations and financial\nimplications of any public employment. The viability of\nthe department or the instrumentality of the project is\nalso of equal concern for the State. The State works\nout the scheme taking into consideration the financial\nimplications and the economic aspects. Can the court\nimpose on the State a financial burden of this nature\nby insisting on regularisation or permanence in\nemployment, when those employed temporarily are not\nneeded permanently or regularly? As an example, we\ncan envisage a direction to give permanent\nemployment to all those who are being temporarily or\ncasually employed in a public sector undertaking. The\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nburden may become so heavy by such a direction that\nthe undertaking itself may collapse under its own\nweight. It is not as if this had not happened. So, the\ncourt ought not to impose a financial burden on the\nState by such directions, as such directions may turn\ncounterproductive.\n\n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question\nwhether the jettisoning of the constitutional scheme of\nappointment can be approved, was not considered or\ndecided. The distinction emphasised in\nR.N.\nNanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(1972) 1 SCC 409 :\n\n(1972) 2 SCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The\nCourt appears to have been dealing with a scheme for\n“equal pay for equal work” and in the process, without\nan actual discussion of the question, had approved a\nscheme put forward by the State, prepared obviously\nat the direction of the Court, to order permanent\nabsorption of such daily-rated workers. With respect to\nthe learned judges, the decision cannot be said to lay\ndown any law, that all those engaged on daily wages,\ncasually, temporarily, or when no sanctioned post or\nvacancy existed and without following the rules of\nselection, should be absorbed or made permanent\nthough not at a stretch, but gradually. If that were the\nratio, with respect, we have to disagree with it.”\n\n104.\nIn the case of\nPost Master General,\nKolkata and Others Vs. Tutu Das(Dutta\n), reported\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nin (2007) 5 SCC 317, paragraphs (5) & (18) are\nrelevant and the same are extracted hereunder:\n\n“5.Whereas pursuant to the said direction,\nalthough the case of Niva Ghosh was allegedly\nconsidered, her case was not, whereupon a contempt\npetition was filed. In the said contempt proceedings, a\nstand was taken by the appellant that she had not\ncompleted a period of 240 days in a year before the\nsaid cut-off date. The said contempt petition was\ndismissed with liberty to the respondent to file a fresh\noriginal application. Pursuant to the said observations,\nthe respondent filed an application before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta\nwhich was marked as OA No. 484 of 2002.\n\n18.There are two distinctive features in the\npresent case, which are:\n\n(i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it cannot\nbe invoked where any illegality has been committed or\nwhere no legal right is established.\n\n(ii) According to the appellant the respondent having\ncompleted 240 days, does not fulfil the requisite\ncriteria. A disputed question of fact has been raised.\n\nThe High Court did not come to a positive finding that\nshe had worked for more than 240 days in a year.”\n\n105.\nIn the case of\nC.Balachandran and\nOthers Vs. State of Kerala and Others\n, reported in\n(2009) 1 SCC (L& S) 610, wherein the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India interpreted the scope of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nparagraph 153 of “Umadevi Case” and the\nparagraphs (17) & (18) of\nthe said judgment\nand the\nsame is extracted hereunder:\n\n“17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon\nthe observations made in Para 53 in Umadevi [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] which reads as under:\n\n(SCC p. 42, para 53)\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be\ncases where irregular appointments (not illegal\nappointments) as explained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V.\nNarayanappa\n[AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] ,\nR.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(\n1972) 1 SCC 409]\nand B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4\nSCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] and referred to in para\n15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\nvacant posts might have been made and the employees\nhave continued to work for ten years or more but\nwithout the intervention of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\nof such employees may have to be considered on\nmerits in the light of the principles settled by this\nCourt in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of\nthis judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\nState Governments and their instrumentalities should\ntake steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the\nservices of such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts\nbut not under cover of orders of the courts or of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntribunals and should further ensure that regular\nrecruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases\nwhere temporary employees or daily wagers are being\nnow employed. The process must be set in motion\nwithin six months from this date. We also clarify that\nregularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice,\nneed not be reopened based on this judgment, but\nthere should be no further bypassing of the\nconstitutional requirement and regularising or making\npermanent, those not duly appointed as per the\nconstitutional scheme.”(emphasis in original)\nA case of regularisation which thus attained finality\nand was not sub judice would not come within the\npurview of exception to the rule contained in Para 53\nof\nthe said judgment\n. The appellants' case, thus, does\nnot come within the purview thereof. Only those cases\nwhere regularisations had already been made were not\nto be reopened. It is not in dispute that services of the\nappellants were terminated as far back as in 1987 and\nthey did not question the legality or validity of the said\norder.\nIt is only after the decision of this Court in Jacob\ncase [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991)\n15 ATC 697] that representations were filed. Such\nrepresentations were rejected both by the Kerala\nWater Authority as also the State of Kerala.\n\n18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus,\nneither in law nor in equity were entitled to be\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nreinstated in service. The decision of this Court in\nJacob case [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 :\n\n(1991) 15 ATC 697] being not applicable to the case of\nthe appellants, we are bound by the ratio laid down in\nUmadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . So\nfar as Para 53 of the judgment of the Constitution\nBench in the said case is concerned, the same has been\nconsidered by this Court in a large number of\ndecisions.\nIn\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board\nv. Ranjodh Singh\n[(2007) 2 SCC 491 : (2007) 1 SCC\n(L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498, para 15)\n“15.\n\nThe question came up for consideration before a\nConstitution Bench of this Court in\nState of Karnataka\nv. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nwherein it was held that no person who was\ntemporarily or casually been employed could be\ndirected to be continued permanently.\n\nIt was opined\nthat by doing so it would be creating another mode of\npublic employment which is not permissible.”\n[See\nEmployees' Union v.

Lalit Kumar Verma\n[(2007) 1 SCC 575 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post Master General v.\n\nTutu Das (Dutta) [(2007) 5 SCC 317 : (2007) 2 SCC\n(L&S) 179] .]”\n\n106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of\nthe judgment, is well enumerated by the Hon'ble Two\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncited above, this Court is not inclined to consider the\nother judgments referred by the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner. However, on a perusal of all these\njudgments cited supra, this Court is of the opinion that\nultimately the legal principle settled in by the\nConstitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case” is binding\nover the subject and the same is to be followed\nscrupulously by all the Courts across the country and\nthe same becomes the law of the land in the matter of\nregularization, permanent absorption and\nappointment.\n\n107. Now, considering the facts and\ncircumstances of the case on hand, it remains that the\nwrit petitioners were appointed as daily rated\nemployees for a particular period and, this Court has\nto draw an inference that all the Government orders\npassed subsequent to the Constitution Bench\nJudgment, if runs contrary to the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench, would become\ninvalid and the same cannot be implemented or\nfollowed. In other words, it is to be noted that the\nGovernment has no authority to issue any orders\ngranting regularization, permanent absorption or\nappointment in violation of the Constitutional schemes\nand in violation of the recruitment rules in force. The\npower of the Government in this regard is certainly\nabrogated by the principles settled by the Constitution\nBench in the “Umadevi Case”. Such being the factum\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof the case, the State Government is to be precluded as\nwell as its authority are to be regularized in respect of\nappointing employees in contravention with the\nrecruitment rules in force and effecting appointments\nthrough back doors.\n\n108. This Court has to place on record that\nthe State is bound to over see the appointments made\nin this regard illegally or irregularly by the competent\nauthorities and the same is to be construed as the\nfraud on the Constitution and such authorities are\nliable for prosecution under the Discipline and Appeal\nRules and other relevant rules. The State shall be\nvigilant in this regard and the authorities indulging in\nsuch activities of exercising powers by issuing illegal\nor irregular appointments are to be booked under the\nDiscipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be\nshown by the State in this regard, since these all are\nthe Constitutional principles required for the State to\nbe followed and the State being a modal employer, has\nto implement the Constitutional perspectives and the\nprinciples scrupulously and without any deviation.\n\n109. The learned counsel for the petitioner\ncontended that in paragraph (15) of the judgment in\n“Umadevi Case”, the Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India held that a distinction\nbetween regularisation and conferment of permanent\nstatus in service jurisprudence has to be drawn. This\nCourt is of the opinion that the conferment of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npermanent status Act, is a general law applicable to\nthe employees, in the absence of any special law\ngoverning the particular subject. However, if any such\nlaw prevails and covering the field of appointment of\nregularisation and permanent absorption, then the\ngeneral law would not apply. In nutshell, the special\nlaw and rules will prevail over the general law and the\nspecial rules in force are to be applied in the relevant\ncase.\n\n110. In view of the discussions made above,\nthis Court is of the opinion that the writ petitioners are\nnot entitled for any relief of permanent absorption as\nsuch sought for in this writ petition.”\n\n30.Even recently, in the case of\nSecretary to\n\nGovernment, School Education Department, Chennai Vs.\n\nR.Govindaswamy and others\nreported in (2014) 4 SCC 769, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the High Courts, in\n\nexercising power under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution will not\n\nissue directions for regularisation, absorption or permanent\n\ncontinuance, unless the employees claiming regularisation had\n\nbeen appointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in\n\naccordance with relevant rules in an open competitive process,\n\nagainst sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause contained in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously followed and Courts\n\nshould not issue a direction for regularisation of services of an\n\nemployee which would be violative of the constitutional scheme.\n\nWhile something that is irregular for want of compliance with one\n\nof the elements in the process of selection which does not go to the\n\nroot of the process, can be regularised, back door entries,\n\nappointments contrary to the constitutional scheme and / or\n\nappointment of ineligible candidates cannot be regularised.\n\n31.Thus, the Apex Court in an equal terms directed the\n\nHigh Courts not to issue directions for regularisation, absorption\n\nor permanent continuance, unless the employees claiming\n\nregularisation had been appointed in pursuance of a regular\n\nrecruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open\n\ncompetitive process. In the present case, admittedly,\n\nadvertisement was issued in local newspaper. However, the terms\n\nof appointments were notified in the notification itself. The writ\n\npetitioners were appointed on contract basis for one year, rule of\n\nreservation was not followed. Admittedly, such contract\n\nappointments are made to meet out the emergency circumstances\n\narose on account of the ban for public appointments and the same\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncan never be considered as a valid appointments made in\n\naccordance with the recruitment rules in force.\n\n32.Even recently, in the case of State of Tamil Nadu\n\nand others Vs. A.Singamuthu reported in (2017) 4 SCC 113,\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India made an observation as\n\nfollows:-\n\n“16.In State of Rajasthan vs. Daya Lal [State\nof Rajasthan\nv. Daya Lal, (2011) 2 SCC 429 : (2011) 1\nSCC (L&S) 340] , this Court has considered the scope\nof regularisation of irregular or part-time\nappointments in all possible eventualities and this\nCourt clearly laid down that part-time employees are\nnot entitled to seek regularisation as they do not work\nagainst any sanctioned posts. It was also held that\npart-time employees in government-run institutions\ncan in no case claim parity in salary with regular\nemployees of the Government on the principle of\nequal pay for equal work. Relevant excerpt from\nthe\nsaid judgment\nis as under: (SCC pp. 435-36, para 12)\n\n12. We may at the outset refer to the following well-\n\nsettled principles relating to regularisation and parity\nin pay, relevant in the context of these appeals:\n\n(i) The High Courts, in exercising power\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution will not issue\ndirections for regularisation, absorption or\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npermanent continuance, unless the employees\nclaiming regularisation had been appointed in\npursuance of a regular recruitment in accordance\nwith relevant rules in an open competitive process,\nagainst sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause\ncontained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be\nscrupulously followed and courts should not issue a\ndirection for regularisation of services of an employee\nwhich would be violative of constitutional scheme.\n\nWhile something that is irregular for want of\ncompliance with one of the elements in the process of\nselection which does not go to the root of the process,\ncan be regularised, back door entries, appointments\ncontrary to the constitutional scheme and/or\nappointment of ineligible candidates cannot be\nregularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a\ntemporary or ad hoc or daily-wage employee, under\ncover of some interim orders of the court, would not\nconfer upon him any right to be absorbed into\nservice, as such service would be litigious\nemployment. Even temporary, ad hoc or daily- wage\nservice for a long number of years, let alone service\nfor one or two years, will not entitle such employee to\nclaim regularisation, if he is not working against a\nsanctioned post. Sympathy and sentiment cannot be\ngrounds for passing any order of regularisation in the\nabsence of a legal right.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for\nregularisation with a cut-off date (that is a scheme\nproviding that persons who had put in a specified\nnumber of years of service and continuing in\nemployment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible\nto others who appointed subsequent to the cut-off\ndate, to claim or contend that the scheme should be\napplied to them by extending the cut-off date or seek\na direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for\nsuccessive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to\nseek regularisation as they are not working against\nany sanctioned posts. There cannot be a direction for\nabsorption, regularisation or permanent continuance\nof part-time temporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in\ngovernment- run institutions cannot claim parity in\nsalary with regular employees of the Government on\nthe principle of equal pay for equal work. Nor can\nemployees in private employment, even if serving full-\ntime, seek parity in salary with government\nemployees. The right to claim a particular salary\nagainst the State must arise under a contract or\nunder a statute.[See\nState of Karnataka v. Uma Devi\n\n(\n3) [State of Karnataka v.

The learned Single Judge of the High\nCourt, while allowing the writ filed by the respondent\nextended the benefit of the said GOMs No. 22 dated\n28-2-2006 and directed the appellants to grant\nregularisation of respondent's service from the date\nof completion of ten years of service with salary and\nother benefits. The learned Judge failed to take note\nof the fact that as per GOMs No. 22 dated 28-2-2006,\nthe services of employees working in various\ngovernment departments on full-time daily-wage\nbasis, who have completed more than ten years of\ncontinuous service as on 1-1-2006 will be regularised\nand not part-time masalchis like the respondent\nherein. In GOMs No. 84 dated 18-6-2012, the\nGovernment made it clear that GOMs No. 22 dated\n28-2- 2006 is applicable only to full-time daily wagers\nand not to part-time daily wagers. The respondent\nwas temporarily appointed part-time worker as per\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nTamil Nadu Finance Code, Vol. 2, Appendix 5 and his\nappointment was completely temporary. The\nrespondent being appointed as part-time masalchi,\ncannot compare himself to full-time daily wagers and\nseek benefit of GOMs No. 22 dated 28-2- 2006. The\nSingle Judge also failed to consider that the\nGovernment did not grant regularisation of services\nof any part-time employee on completion of ten years\nof his service as envisaged under GOMs No. 22 dated\n28-2- 2006.\n\n18. The learned Single Judge erred in\nextending the benefit of GOMs No. 22 dated\n28-2-2006 to the respondent that too retrospectively\nfrom the date of completion of ten years of service of\nthe respondent. The respondent was appointed on\n1-4-1989 and completed ten years of service on\n31-3-1999. As rightly contended by the learned\nSenior Counsel for the appellants, if the respondent is\nto be given monetary benefits from the date of\ncompletion of ten years of service, that is, from\n1-4-1999 till the date of his regularisation, that is,\n18-6-2012, the financial commitment to the State\nwould be around Rs 10,85,113 (approximately)\ntowards back wages apart from pension which will\nhave a huge impact on the State exchequer. That\napart, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\nsubmitted that in respect of Registration Department,\nabout 172 persons were regularised under various\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nG.Os. and if the impugned order is sustained, the\nGovernment will have to pay the back wages to all\nthose persons from the date of completion of ten\nyears in service and this will have a huge impact on\nthe State exchequer. Since the impugned order\ndirecting regularisation of the respondent from the\ndate of completion of their ten years would adversely\naffect the State exchequer in a huge manner, the\nimpugned order cannot be sustained on this score\nalso.\n\n19. It is pertinent to note that even the\nregularisation of services of part-time employees vide\nG.O. (Rt.) No. 505 Finance (AA-2) Department dated\n14-10- 2009 and G.O. (2D) No. 32 Finance (T.A. 2)\nDepartment dated 26-3-2010 was effected by\nextending the benefit of G.O. dated 28-2-2006 only\nfrom the date of government orders and not from the\ndate of completion of their ten years of service. The\nDivision Bench also failed to take note that GOMs No.\n22 P & AR Dept. dated 28-2-2006 is applicable only to\nfull-time daily-wage employees and who had\ncompleted ten years of continuous service as on 1-1-\n2006 and not to part-time employees. As per G.O.\n(Rt.) No. 84 dated 18-6-2012, the respondent is\nentitled to the monetary benefits only from the date\nof issuance of government order regularising his\nservice, that is, 18-6- 2012. The impugned order\n[Commercial Taxes and Registration Deptt., State of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nT.N. v. A. Singamuthu, Writ Appeal No. 1209 of 2012,\ndecided on\n4-7-2012 (Mad)] of the Division Bench affirming the\norder [A. Singamuthu v. Commercial Taxes and\nRegistration Deptt., State of T.N., WP No. 26702 of\n2010, order dated 26-11- 2010 (Mad)] of the Single\nJudge granting benefits to the respondent from the\ndate of completion of ten years of service is erroneous\nand the same is liable to be set aside.”\n\n33.In view of the legal principles settled and in view of\n\nthe fact that initial appointment of the writ petitioners were on\n\ncontract basis for one year period and the Government also\n\nconsistently, rejected the claim of the writ petitioners for\n\nregularisation and permanent absorption, this Court is of the\n\nopinion that the writ petitioners have not established any\n\nacceptable legal ground to grant such relief as such sought for in\n\nthe present Writ Petitions. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to\n\npass the following order:-\n\n“1.The relief sought for in the present Writ\n\nPetitions stands rejected.\n\n2.The writ petitioners shall be permitted\n\nto continue in service, if their services are required\n\nto meet out the emergency circumstances and till\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe regular appointments are made in accordance\n\nwith recruitment rules in force for the post of\n\nPharmacists and Staff Nurses. If the writ\n\npetitioners are qualified, they are also permitted to\n\nparticipate in the process of selection for\n\nrecruitment to the post of Pharmacists and Staff\n\nNurses.\n\n3.In view of the fact that the writ\n\npetitioners are working as Pharmacists and Staff\n\nNurses, medical facilities to be provided to the\n\ncitizens cannot be affected. Providing of medical\n\nfacilities is of paramount importance and the right\n\nto medical facility is now an integral part of\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India. Thus, the State and\n\nauthorities are bound to provide medical facility to\n\nall the citizens. In the event of ousting the service\n\nof these Pharmacists and Staff Nurses immediately,\n\nthe same will disturb the treatments to be provided\n\nto the patients, who are attending the Corporation\n\nhospitals. Thus, the actions in this regard must be\n\nslowly taken by the Corporation without affecting\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe medical treatments to be provided to the\n\ncitizens at large.”\n\n34.With these observations, these Writ Petitions stand\n\ndismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous\n\npetitions are closed.\n\n17.06.2019\n(½)\nIndex : Yes/No\nInternet : Yes/No\n\nMyr\n\nTo\n1.The Secretary to Government,\nState of Tamil Nadu,\nMunicipal Administration and\nWater Supply Department,\nSecretariat, Chennai-600 009.\n\n2.The Commissioner of Municipality Administration,\nEzhilagam, Annex VI Floor,\nChepauk, Chennai-600 005.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nS.M.SUBRAMANIAM,J.\n\nMyr\n\nW.P.(MD)Nos.10895 to 10897, 14099 to 14101,\n11457, 10866, 11084, 10752 to 10758, 11427, 11287 to\n11293, 11003, 10981 to 10985, 16089 to 16096 of 2014\n\n17.06.2019\n(½)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in",
