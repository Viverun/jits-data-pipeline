Praveen entered\n her room and asked her to go out of the room with him. As she refused,\n Praveen suffocated her and took her to the bathroom in the courtyard. Praveen\n closed the door of the bathroom and committed rape on her. Hearing her\n shouts, her parents came there. Praveen fled away after threatening to kill her, if\n she reports. She narrated the incident to her parents, but could not report the\n incident due to fear of Praveen. On such allegations, Police Station Civil Lines,\n\n District Morena registered FIR at Crime No. 02/2024 for offence punishable\n under \nSections 376\n, \n458\n, \n342\n, \n506\n of IPC and \nSection 3\n/\n4\n of the POCSO Act.\n Victim was forwarded for medico legal examination. Applicant was arrested on\n 03.01.2024. He is in custody ever since. Statement of prosecutrix was recorded\n under \nSection 164\n of CrPC. On completion of investigation, final report was\n submitted on 14.01.2024.\n\n Learned Counsel for the applicant, in addition to the grounds mentioned\n in the application, submits that applicant has been falsely implicated in the\n matter under pressure of the family members of the victim. Learned counsel\n referring to the contents of FIR submits that the incident seems to be highly\n improbable. Learned counsel further referring to the Medical Report submits\n that the injuries found on person of the victim were reported to be caused within\n 24 hours, which prima facie shows false implication. Delay in lodging FIR\n substantiates false implication with premeditation and preparation. Learned\n counsel further submits that applicant is aged around 18 years and he has just\n attained majority. He is pursuing his BSC Degree course.
