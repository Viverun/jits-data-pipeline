A\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\n situation arises and the legislature, expressing its concern and\n\nDEEPAK GUGLANI\n\nDate: 2018.09.14\n\n11:34:12 IST\n\nReason:\n\n responsibility, adds a new penal provision with the intention to achieve\n\n\f 2\n\nthe requisite result. When a sensitive legal provision is brought into the\n\nstatute book, the victims of the crime feel adequately safe, and if the said\n\nprovision pertains to matrimonial sphere, both the parties, namely, wife\n\nand husband or any one from the side of the husband is booked for the\n\noffence and both the sides play the victim card. The accused persons,\n\nwhile asserting as victims, exposit grave concern and the situation of\n\nharassment is built with enormous anxiety and accentuated vigour. It is\n\npropounded in a court of law that the penal provision is abused to an\n\nunimaginable extent, for in a cruel, ruthless and totally revengeful\n\nmanner, the young, old and relatives residing at distant places having no\n\ninvolvement with the incident, if any, are roped in. Thus, the abuse of the\n\npenal provision has vertically risen. When the implementation of law is\n\nabused by the law enforcing agency, the legislature introduces a\n\nprotective provision as regards arrest. Needless to say, the courts have\n\nample power to grant pre-arrest bail or popularly called anticipatory bail\n\nand even to quash the criminal proceeding totally to stabilize the lawful\n\nbalance because no court of law remotely conceives of a war between\n\nthe two sexes. The courts remain constantly alive to the situation that\n\nthough no war takes place, yet neither anger nor vendetta of the\n\naggrieved section should take an advantage of the legal provision and\n\nharass the other side with influence or espousing the principle of\n\nsympathy. The role of the law enforcing agency or the prosecuting\n\n\f 3\n\nagency is sometimes coloured with superlative empathy being totally\n\noblivious of the sensation to make maladroit efforts to compete with the\n\ngame of super sensitivity. Such a situation brings in a social disaster that\n\nhas the potentiality to vertically divide the society. The sense of sensitivity\n\nand the study of social phenomenon are required to be understood with\n\nobjectivity. In such a situation, it is obligatory on the part of the\n\nlegislature to bring in protective adjective law and the duty of the\n\nconstitutional courts to perceive and scrutinize the protective measure so\n\nthat the social menace is curbed. We are, in the instant matters,\n\nfocussing on \nSection 498-A\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short,\n\n„the \nIPC\n‟).\n\n2. \nSection 498-A\n was brought into the statute book in the year 1983.\n\nThe objects and reasons for introducing \nSection 498-A\n IPC can be\n\ngathered from the Statement of Objects and Reasons of Criminal Law\n\n(Second Amendment) Act of 1983 and read as under :-\n\n \"The increasing number of Dowry Deaths is a matter of\n serious concern. The extent of evil has been commented\n upon by the Joint Committee of the Houses constituted\n to examine the working of \nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n.\n Cases of cruelty by the husband and the relatives of the\n husband which culminate in suicide by, or murder of the\n hapless woman concerned, constitute only a small\n fraction of the cases involving such cruelty. It is,\n therefore proposed to amend the Indian Penal Code,\n Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act\n suitably to deal effectively not only with cases of Dowry\n Death but also cruelty to married woman by their in laws.\n\n\f 4\n\n2. The following are the changes that are proposed to be\nmade:-\n\n(i) The \nIndian Penal Code\n is proposed to be amended to\nmake cruelty to a woman by her husband or any relative\nof her husband punishable with an imprisonment for a\nterm which may extend to three years and also with fine.\n\nWillful conduct of such a nature by the husband or any\nother relative of the husband as is likely to drive the\nwoman to commit suicide or cause grave physical or\nmental injury to her, and harassment of woman by her\nhusband or by any relative of her husband with a view to\ncoercing her or any of her relatives to meet any unlawful\ndemand for property would be punishable as cruelty, the\noffence will cognizable if information relating to the\ncommission of the offence is given to the officer in\ncharge of a Police Station by the victim of the offence or\na relative of the victim of the offence or, in the absence\nof any such relative, by any public servant authorized in\nthis behalf by the State Government. It is also being\nprovided that no court shall take cognizance of the\noffence except upon a Police Report or complaint made\nby the victim of the offence or by her father, mother,\nbrother, sister or by her father's or mother's brother or\nsister or with the leave of the court by any other person\nrelated to her by blood, marriage or adoption (vide\nClauses 2, 5 and 6 of the Bill.)\n\n(ii) Provision is being made for inquest by Executive\nMagistrates and for postmortem in all cases where a\nwoman has, within seven years of her marriage,\ncommitted suicide or died in circumstances raising a\nreasonable suspicion that some other person has\ncommitted an offence. Post-mortem is also being\nprovided for in all cases where a married woman has\ndied within seven years of her marriage and a relative of\nsuch woman has made a request in this behalf (vide\nClauses 3 and 4 of the Bill)\n\n(iii)The Indian evidence Act, 1872 is being amended to\nprovide that where a woman has committed suicide\n\n\f 5\n\n within a period of seven years from date of her marriage\n and it is shown that her husband or any relative of her\n husband and subjected her to cruelty, the court may\n presume that such suicide had been abetted by her\n husband or by such relative of her husband (vide Clause\n 7 of the Bill)\n\n 3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.\"\n\n3. Regarding the constitutionality of \nSection 498-A\n IPC, in \nSushil\n\nKumar Sharma v. Union of India and others\n 1, it was held by the\n\nSupreme Court:-\n\n \"Provision of S. 498A of Penal Code is not\n unconstitutional and ultra vires. Mere possibility of abuse\n of a provision of law does not per se invalidate a\n legislation. Hence plea that S. 498A has no legal or\n constitutional foundation is not tenable. The object of the\n provisions is prevention of the dowry menace. But many\n instances have come to light where the complaints are\n not bona fide and have been filed with oblique motive. In\n such cases acquittal of the accused does not in all cases\n wipe out the ignominy suffered during and prior to trial.\n Sometimes adverse media coverage adds to the misery.\n The question, therefore, is what remedial measures can\n be taken to prevent abuse of the well-intentioned\n provision. Merely because the provision is constitutional\n and intra vires, does not give a licence to unscrupulous\n persons to wreck personal vendetta or unleash\n harassment. It may, therefore, become necessary for the\n legislature to find out ways how the makers of frivolous\n complaints or allegations can be appropriately dealt with.\n Till then the Courts have to take care of the situation\n within the existing frame-work.\"\n\n4. \nIn \nB.S. Joshi and others v. State of Haryana and another\n 2,\n\nthe Court observed:-\n\n1\n\n (2005) 6 SCC 281 : AIR 2005 SC 3100\n\n2\n\n(2003) 4 SCC 675 : AIR 2003 SC 1386\n\n\f 6\n\n \"There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter\n XX-A containing Section 498A in the \nIndian Penal Code\n\n was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband or\n by relatives of her husband. Section 498A was added with\n a view to punishing a husband and his relatives who\n harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to\n satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical\n view would be counter productive and would act against\n interests of women and against the object for which this\n provision was added. There is eveiy likelihood that non-\n\n exercise of inherent power to quash the proceedings to\n meet the ends of justice would prevent women from\n settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA of\n \nIndian Penal Code\n.\"\n\n5. \nIn \nBrij Lal v. Prem Chand\n and another3, this Court ruled thus:-\n\n “It would not be out of place for us to refer here to the\n addition of Sections 113-A and 113-B to the \nIndian\n Evidence Act\n and Sections 498-A and 304-B to the \nIndian\n Penal Code\n by subsequent amendments. \nSection 113-A\n\n Evidence Act and 498-A \nIndian Penal Code\n have been\n introduced in the respective enactments by the Criminal\n Law (Second amendment) Act, 1983 (Act 46 of 1983) and\n \nSection 113-B\n of the Evidence Act and 304-B \nIndian\n Penal Code\n have been introduced by Act No. 43 of 1986.\n The degradation of society due to the pernicious system\n of dowry and the unconscionable demands made by\n greedy and unscrupulous husbands and their parents and\n relatives resulting in an alarming number of suicidal and\n dowry deaths by women has shocked the Legislative\n conscience to such an extent that the Legislature has\n deemed it necessary to provide additional provisions of\n law, procedural as well as substantive, to combat the evil\n and has consequently introduced Sections 113-A and\n 113-B in the \nIndian Evidence Act\n and Sections 498-A\n and 304-B in the \nIndian Penal Code\n. By reason of Section\n 113-A, the Courts can presume that the commission of\n suicide by a woman has been abetted by her husband or\n relation if two factors are present viz. (1) that the woman\n\n3\n\n(1989) 2 SCR 612\n\n\f 7\n\n had committed suicide within a period of seven years\n from her marriage, and (2) that the husband or relation\n had subjected her to cruelty. We are referring to these\n provisions only to show that the Legislature has realised\n the need to provide for additional provisions in the Indian\n Penal Code and the Indian Evidence Act to check the\n growing menace of dowry deaths...”\n\n6. Presently, to the factual score. The instant Petitions have been\n\npreferred under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution of India seeking directions\n\nto the respondents to create an enabling environment for married\n\nwomen subjected to cruelty to make informed choices and to create a\n\nuniform system of monitoring and systematically reviewing incidents of\n\nviolence against women under \nSection 498-A\n IPC including their\n\nprevention, investigation, prosecution and rehabilitation of the victims\n\nand their children at the Central, State and District levels. That apart,\n\nprayer has been made to issue a writ of mandamus to the respondents\n\nfor a uniform policy of registration of FIR, arrest and bail in cases of\n\nSection 498-A\n IPC in consonance with the law of the land, i.e., to\n\nimmediately register FIR on complaint of cruelty and harassment by\n\nmarried women as per the \nIPC\n.\n\n7. It has been averred by the petitioners that hundreds of women are\n\nbeing subjected to horrific acts of violence often in the guise of domestic\n\nabuse or to extract more money from the girl's natal family due to\n\nabsence of any uniform system of monitoring and systematic review of\n\n\f 8\n\nincidents of violence against married women which has led to dilution of\n\nthe legislative intent behind \nSection 498-A\n IPC. And, in the wake of ever\n\nincreasing crimes leading to unnatural deaths of women in marital\n\nhomes, any dilution of \nSection 498-A\n IPC is not warranted.\n\n8. It has been contended that \nSection 498-A\n IPC, since its\n\nintroduction, has increasingly been vilified and associated with the\n\nperception that it is misused by women who frequently use it as a\n\nweapon against their in-laws. As per the petitioners, though there is\n\ngeneral complaint that \nSection 498-A\n IPC is subject to gross misuse, yet\n\nthere is no concrete data to indicate how frequently the provision has\n\nbeen misused. Further, the Court, by whittling down the stringency of\n\nSection 498-A\n IPC, is proceeding on an erroneous premise that there is\n\nmisuse of the said provision, whereas in fact misuse by itself cannot be\n\na ground to repeal a penal provision or take away its teeth.\n\n9. It is set forth in the petition that \nSection 498-A\n IPC has been\n\nspecifically enacted to protect the vulnerable sections of the society who\n\nhave been victims of cruelty and harassment. The social purpose behind\n\nSection 498-A\n IPC is being lost as the rigour of the said provision has\n\nbeen diluted and the offence has practically been made bailable by\n\nreason of various qualifications and restrictions prescribed by various\n\n\f 9\n\ndecisions of this Court including \nRajesh Sharma and others v. State\n\nof U.P. and another\n 4, a recent pronouncement.\n\n10. It has also been submitted by the petitioners that the police is\n\nhesitant to arrest the accused on complaint of married women and the\n\nsame inaction is justified by quoting various judgments, despite the fact\n\nthat \nSection 498-A\n IPC discloses a non-bailable offence and sufficient\n\nchecks and balances have been provided in the law itself under \nSection\n\n41\n CrPC. To prevent arbitrary and necessary arrest, the statute very\n\nclearly states that the police shall record reasons for effecting arrest as\n\nwell as for not arresting.\n\n11. The petitioners have also asseverated that there is lack of\n\nmonitoring mechanism to track cases registered under \nSection 498-A\n\nIPC including systematic study of the reason of low convictions and due\n\nto this absence, penal laws have not been able to secure a safe married\n\nenvironment to women. This, as per the petitioners, has also resulted in\n\nrise in cases under \nSection 498-A\n IPC because the deterrent effect of\n\nthe said provision is getting diluted. It is also the case of the petitioners\n\nthat investigation by the police of offence under \nSection 498-A\n IPC is\n\noften unprofessional and callous and the investigating officers\n\n4\n\n AIR 2017 SC 3869 : 2017 (8) SCALE 313\n\n\f 10\n\nperceptibly get influenced by both the parties which results in\n\nperpetrators escaping conviction.\n\n12. It is further contended that in many cases under \nSection 498-A\n,\n\nIPC the Court has not considered mental cruelty caused to the woman\n\nbut has concentrated only on any sign of physical cruelty due to which\n\nthe courts do not look into a case if the evidence does not show that the\n\nwoman was physically harassed. This has led the courts to brand the\n\nwoman on many occasions as hyper-sensitive or of low tolerance level.\n\n13. It has been further averred that the alleged abuse of the penal\n\nprovision is mostly by well-educated women who know that the offence\n\nis both cognizable and non-bailable and impromptu works on the\n\ncomplaint of the woman by placing the man behind the bars, but this\n\ncannot be a ground for denying the poor and illiterate women the\n\nprotection that is offered by \nSection 498-A\n IPC against cruelty, rather\n\nthere is a need to create awareness specifically in the rural areas about\n\nthe laws for protection of women and consequent available remedies in\n\ncase of breach.\n\n14. It is also set forth in the petition that despite the \nDowry Prohibition\n\nAct, 1961\n being passed, the irony still survives perhaps with more\n\noxygen, for the social evil of dowry is on the increase and is openly\n\n\f 11\n\npractised with pride. It is put forth that women today are still tortured\n\nand often the court, despite being the ultimate saviour, does not come\n\nto the rescue of these women as a consequence of which an\n\natmosphere of ambivalence prevails and such societal ambivalence\n\ncreates a situation of war between two classes though in actuality the\n\noffence is relatable to individuals. A sorry state of affairs is\n\npronouncedly asserted.\n\n15. On the aforesaid bedrock, a prayer in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 73 of\n\n2015 has been made to have a uniform policy of registration of FIR,\n\narrest and bail in cases of \nSection 498-A\n IPC. It is worthy to note here\n\nthat during the pendency of this Writ Petition, the judgment had been\n\npronounced in \nRajesh Sharma\n (supra).\n \nThe Court in \nRajesh Sharma\n\n(supra) issued the following guidelines:-\n\n “19.i) (a) In every district one or more Family Welfare\n Committees be constituted by the District Legal\n Services Authorities preferably comprising of three\n members. The constitution and working of such\n committees may be reviewed from time to time and\n at least once in a year by the District and Sessions\n Judge of the district who is also the Chairman of the\n District Legal Services Authority.\n\n (b) The Committees may be constituted out of para\n legal volunteers/social workers/retired persons/\n wives of working officers/other citizens who may be\n found suitable and willing.\n\n (c) The Committee members will not be called as\n witnesses.\n\n\f 12\n\n(d) Every complaint under Section 498A received by\nthe police or the Magistrate be referred to and\nlooked into by such committee. Such committee\nmay have interaction with the parties personally or\nby means of telephone or any other mode of\ncommunication including electronic communication.\n\n(e) Report of such committee be given to the\nAuthority by whom the complaint is referred to it\nlatest within one month from the date of receipt of\ncomplaint.\n\n(f) The committee may give its brief report about the\nfactual aspects and its opinion in the matter.\n\n(g) Till report of the committee is received, no arrest\nshould normally be effected.\n\n(h) The report may be then considered by the\nInvestigating Officer or the Magistrate on its own\nmerit.\n\n(i) Members of the committee may be given such\nbasic minimum training as may be considered\nnecessary by the Legal Services Authority from time\nto time.\n\n(j) The Members of the committee may be given\nsuch honorarium as may be considered viable.\n\n(k) It will be open to the District and Sessions Judge\nto utilize the cost fund wherever considered\nnecessary and proper.\n\nii) Complaints under Section 498A and other\nconnected offences may be investigated only by a\ndesignated Investigating Officer of the area. Such\ndesignations may be made within one month from\ntoday. Such designated officer may be required to\nundergo training for such duration (not less than\none week) as may be considered appropriate. The\ntraining may be completed within four months from\ntoday;\n\niii) In cases where a settlement is reached, it will\nbe open to the District and Sessions Judge or any\nother senior Judicial Officer nominated by him in the\ndistrict to dispose of the proceedings including\nclosing of the criminal case if dispute primarily\nrelates to matrimonial discord;\n\n\f 13\n\n iv) If a bail application is filed with at least one\n clear day‟s notice to the Public\n\n Prosecutor/complainant, the same may be decided\n as far as possible on the same day. Recovery of\n disputed dowry items may not by itself be a ground\n for denial of bail if maintenance or other rights of\n wife/minor children can otherwise be protected.\n\n Needless to say that in dealing with bail matters,\n individual roles, prima facie truth of the allegations,\n requirement of further arrest/ custody and interest of\n justice must be carefully weighed;\n\n v) In respect of persons ordinarily residing out of\n India impounding of passports or issuance of Red\n Corner Notice should not be a routine;\n\n vi) It will be open to the District Judge or a\n designated senior judicial officer nominated by the\n District Judge to club all connected cases between\n the parties arising out of matrimonial disputes so\n that a holistic view is taken by the Court to whom all\n such cases are entrusted; and\n\n vii) Personal appearance of all family members\n and particularly outstation members may not be\n required and the trial court ought to grant exemption\n from personal appearance or permit appearance by\n video conferencing without adversely affecting\n progress of the trial.\n\n viii) These directions will not apply to the offences\n involving tangible physical injuries or death.”\n\n16. In the meanwhile, Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 156 of 2017 had\n\nbeen filed. A prayer had been made in the said Writ Petition to\n\nimplement the suggestion that out of three members, at least two\n\nmembers should be appointed in the Family Welfare Committee. When\n\nthis Writ Petition was listed on 13.10.2017, the following order came to\n\nbe passed:-\n\n\f 14\n\n “Mr. Alok Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner though\n has a different set of prayers in the writ petition, it\n fundamentally requires this Court to implement directions\n rendered in Criminal Appeal No.1265 of 2017 [Rajesh\n Sharma vs. State of U.P. and Another]. Additionally,\n learned counsel would submit that certain lady members,\n certain organizations and welfare committees are to be\n involved.\n\n \nAt this stage, we are obligated to state that we are\n not in agreement with the decision rendered in \nRajesh\n Sharma\n (supra) because we are disposed to think that it\n really curtails the rights of the women who are harassed\n under \nSection 498A\n of the Indian Penal Code. That apart,\n prima facie, we perceive that the guidelines may be in the\n legislative sphere.\n\n Issue notice to the respondent Nos.1 to 3. No notice\n need be issued to the respondent No.4. Even if the\n petitioner does not take steps, the Registry shall see to it\n that the respondents are served. Ms. Indu Malhotra and\n Mr. V. Shekhar, learned senior counsel are appointed as\n Amicus Curiae to assist the Court in the matter.\n\n List the matter on 29th November, 2017.”\n\n17. Mr. V. Shekhar, learned senior counsel, was appointed as Amicus\n\nCuriae to assist the Court in the matter.\n\n18. It was submitted by the learned Amicus Curiae that the decision in\n\nRajesh Sharma\n (supra) requires reconsideration, for \nthe said judgment\n\nconfers powers on the Family Welfare Committee to be constituted by\n\nthe District Legal Services Authority which is an extra-judicial committee\n\nof para legal volunteers/social workers/retired persons/wives of working\n\nofficers/other citizens to look into the criminal complaints under \nSections\n\n\f 15\n\n498-A\n IPC in the first instance and further, there has been a direction\n\nthat till such time a report of the committee is received, no arrest should\n\nbe made. It is urged that the constitution of FWC to look into the criminal\n\ncomplaints under \nSection 498-A\n IPC is contrary to the procedure\n\nprescribed under the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n.\n\n19. It is further propounded that the directions in certain paragraphs of\n\nthe judgment in \nRajesh Sharma\n (supra) entrusting the power to dispose\n\nof the proceedings under \nSection 498-A\n IPC by the District and\n\nSessions Judge or any other senior judicial officer nominated by him in\n\nthe district in cases where there is settlement, are impermissible, for an\n\noffence under Section 498-A is not compoundable and hence, such a\n\npower could not have been conferred on any District and Sessions\n\nJudge or any senior judicial officer nominated by him. Elaborating the\n\nsaid submission, it is canvassed that the High Court is empowered\n\nunder \nSection 482\n CrPC to quash the proceeding if there is a settlement\n\nbetween the parties. Learned Amicus Curiae further submitted that the\n\nrecovery of disputed dowry items may not itself be a ground for denial of\n\nbail which is the discretion of the court to decide the application of grant\n\nof bail in the facts and circumstances of the case and thus, this\n\ntantamounts to a direction which is not warranted in law. Criticism has\n\n\f 16\n\nbeen advanced with regard to the direction in paragraph 19(v) which\n\nstates that for persons who are ordinarily residing out of India,\n\nimpounding of passports or issuance of Red Corner Notice should not\n\nbe done in a routine manner. It is urged that if an accused does not join\n\nthe investigation relating to matrimonial/family offence, the competent\n\ncourt can issue appropriate directions to the concerned authorities to\n\nissue Red Corner Notice which will depend on the facts of the case.\n\n20. Learned Amicus Curiae has further put forth that dispensation of\n\npersonal appearance of outstation family members is unwarranted, for in\n\na criminal proceeding, the competent court which deals with application\n\nof exemption should be allowed to exercise the judicial discretion and\n\nthere should not have been a general direction by this Court. Certain\n\nsuggestions have been given by the learned Amicus Curiae which we\n\nshall refer to at the relevant stage.\n\n21. To appreciate the controversy, it is necessary to understand the\n\nscope of \nSection 498-A\n of IPC. It reads thus:-\n\n “498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman\n subjecting her to cruelty.—Whoever, being the husband\n or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such\n woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for\n a term which may extend to three years and shall also be\n liable to fine. Explanation.—For the purpose of this\n section, “cruelty” means—\n\n (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely\n to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave\n\n\f 17\n\n injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or\n physical) of the woman; or\n\n (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is\n with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to\n meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable\n security or is on account of failure by her or any person\n related to her to meet such demand.”\n\n22. The said offence is a cognizable and non-bailable offence. This\n\nCourt in \nArnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar\n and another5 has observed\n\nthat the said offence which is a cognizable and non-bailable offence has\n\nlent it a dubious place of pride amongst the provisions that are used as\n\nweapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives. The simplest way to\n\nharass is to get the husband and his relatives arrested under this\n\nprovision. The Court has taken note of the statistics under “Crime in\n\nIndia 2012 Statistics” published by the National Crime Records Bureau,\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs which shows arrest of 1,97,762 persons all over\n\nIndia during the year 2012 for the offence under Section 498-A.\n\nShowing concern, the Court held that arrest brings humiliation, curtails\n\nfreedom and casts scars forever and the police had not learnt its lesson\n\nwhich is implicit and embodied in the \nCriminal Procedure Code\n.\n\nCommenting on the police, the Court said:-\n\n “It has not come out of its colonial image despite six\n decades of Independence, it is largely considered as a\n tool of harassment, oppression and surely not considered\n a friend of public. The need for caution in exercising the\n\n5\n\n (2014) 8 SCC 273\n\n\f 18\n\n drastic power of arrest has been emphasised time and\n again by the courts but has not yielded desired result.\n\n Power to arrest greatly contributes to its arrogance so\n also the failure of the Magistracy to check it. Not only this,\n the power of arrest is one of the lucrative sources of\n police corruption. The attitude to arrest first and then\n proceed with the rest is despicable. It has become a\n handy tool to the police officers who lack sensitivity or act\n with oblique motive.”\n\n23. The Court, thereafter, has drawn a distinction between the power\n\nto arrest and justification for the exercise of it and analysed \nSection 41\n\nCrPC. \nSection 41\n stipulates when police may arrest without warrant.\n\nThe said provision reads as follows:-\n\n “41. When police may arrest without warrant.—(1) Any\n police officer may without an order from a Magistrate and\n without a warrant, arrest any person—\n\n (a) who commits, in the presence of a police officer, a\n cognizable offence;\n\n (b) against whom a reasonable complaint has been\n made, or credible information has been received, or a\n reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a\n cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a\n term which may be less than seven years or which may\n extend to seven years whether with or without fine, if the\n following conditions are satisfied, namely:--\n\n (i) the police officer has reason to believe on the\n basis of such complaint, information, or suspicion\n that such person has committed the said offence;\n\n (ii) the police officer is satisfied that such arrest is\n necessary--\n\n (a) to prevent such person from committing any\n further offence; or\n\n (b) for proper investigation of the offence; or\n\n\f 19\n\n (c) to prevent such person from causing the\n evidence of the offence to disappear or tampering\n with such evidence in any manner; or\n\n (d) to prevent such person from making any\n inducement, threat or promise to any person\n acquainted with the facts of the case so as to\n dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court\n or to the police officer; or\n\n (e) as unless such person is arrested, his presence\n in the Court whenever required cannot be ensured,\nand the police officer shall record while making such\narrest, his reasons in writing.\n\nProvided that a police officer shall, in all cases where the\narrest of a person is not required under the provisions of\nthis sub-section, record the reasons in writing for not\nmaking the arrest.\n\n(ba) against whom credible information has been\nreceived that he has committed a cognizable offence\npunishable with imprisonment for a term which may\nextend to more than seven years whether with or without\nfine or with death sentence and the police officer has\nreason to believe on the basis of that information that\nsuch person has committed the said offence.\n\n(c) who has been proclaimed as an offender either under\nthis Code or by order of the State Government; or\n\n(d) in whose possession anything is found which may\nreasonably be suspected to be stolen property and who\nmay reasonably be suspected of having committed an\noffence with reference to such thing; or\n\n(e) who obstructs a police officer while in the execution\nof his duty, or who has escaped, or attempts to escape,\nfrom lawful custody; or\n\n(f) who is reasonable suspected of being a deserter from\nany of the Armed Forces of the Union; or\n\n(g) who has been concerned in, or against whom a\nreasonable complaint has been made, or credible\ninformation has been received, or a reasonable\n\n\f 20\n\n suspicion exists, of his having been concerned in, any\n act committed at any place out of India which, if\n committed in India, would have been punishable as an\n offence, and for which he is, under any law relating to\n extradition, or otherwise, liable to be apprehended or\n detained in custody in India; or\n\n (h) who, being a released convict, commits a breach of\n any rule made under sub-section (5) of section 356; or\n\n (i) for whose arrest any requisition, whether written or\n oral, has been received from another police officer,\n provided that the requisition specifies the person to be\n arrested and the offence or other cause for which the\n arrest is to be made and it appears therefrom that the\n person might lawfully be arrested without a warrant by\n the officer who issued the requisition.\n\n (2) Subject to the provisions of \nsection 42\n, no person\n concerned in a non-cognizable offence or against whom\n a complaint has been made or credible information has\n been received or reasonable suspicion exists of his\n having so concerned, shall be arrested except under a\n warrant or order of a Magistrate.”\n\n24. Scrutinising the said provision, the Court held as under:-\n\n “7.1. From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision, it is\n evident that a person accused of an offence punishable with\n imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years\n or which may extend to seven years with or without fine,\n cannot be arrested by the police officer only on his\n satisfaction that such person had committed the offence\n punishable as aforesaid. A police officer before arrest, in\n such cases has to be further satisfied that such arrest is\n necessary to prevent such person from committing any\n further offence; or for proper investigation of the case; or to\n prevent the accused from causing the evidence of the\n offence to disappear; or tampering with such evidence in any\n manner; or to prevent such person from making any\n inducement, threat or promise to a witness so as to dissuade\n him from disclosing such facts to the court or the police\n officer; or unless such accused person is arrested, his\n\n\f 21\n\n presence in the court whenever required cannot be ensured.\n These are the conclusions, which one may reach based on\n facts.\n\n x x x x x\n\n 7.3. In pith and core, the police officer before arrest must put\n a question to himself, why arrest? Is it really required? What\n purpose it will serve? What object it will achieve? It is only\n after these questions are addressed and one or the other\n conditions as enumerated above is satisfied, the power of\n arrest needs to be exercised. In fine, before arrest first the\n police officers should have reason to believe on the basis of\n information and material that the accused has committed the\n offence. Apart from this, the police officer has to be satisfied\n further that the arrest is necessary for one or the more\n purposes envisaged by sub-clauses (a) to (e) of clause (1) of\n \nSection 41\n CrPC.”\n\n25. The learned Judges, thereafter, referred to \nSection 41-A\n CrPC\n\nwhich has been inserted by Section 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2008 (5 of 2009). The said provision is to the\n\nfollowing effect:-\n\n “41-A. Notice of appearance before police officer.—(1)\n The police officer shall, in all cases where the arrest of a\n person is not required under the provisions of sub-section (1)\n of \nSection 41\n, issue a notice directing the person against\n whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible\n information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion\n exists that he has committed a cognizable offence, to appear\n before him or at such other place as may be specified in the\n notice.\n\n (2) Where such a notice is issued to any person, it shall\n be the duty of that person to comply with the terms of the\n notice.\n\n (3) Where such person complies and continues to comply\n with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the\n\n\f 22\n\n offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be\n recorded, the police officer is of the opinion that he ought to\n be arrested.\n\n (4) Where such person, at any time, fails to comply with\n the terms of the notice or is unwilling to identify himself, the\n police officer may, subject to such orders as may have been\n passed by a competent court in this behalf, arrest him for the\n offence mentioned in the notice.”\n\nExplaining the said provision, it has been ruled:-\n\n “9. …The aforesaid provision makes it clear that in all cases\n where the arrest of a person is not required under \nSection\n 41(1)\n CrPC, the police officer is required to issue notice\n directing the accused to appear before him at a specified\n place and time. Law obliges such an accused to appear\n before the police officer and it further mandates that if such\n an accused complies with the terms of notice he shall not be\n arrested, unless for reasons to be recorded, the police officer\n is of the opinion that the arrest is necessary. At this stage\n also, the condition precedent for arrest as envisaged under\n \nSection 41\n CrPC has to be complied and shall be subject to\n the same scrutiny by the Magistrate as aforesaid.”\n\nThe Court further went on to say that:-\n\n “10. We are of the opinion that if the provisions of \nSection 41\n\n CrPC which authorises the police officer to arrest an\n accused without an order from a Magistrate and without a\n warrant are scrupulously enforced, the wrong committed by\n the police officers intentionally or unwittingly would be\n reversed and the number of cases which come to the Court\n for grant of anticipatory bail will substantially reduce. We\n would like to emphasise that the practice of mechanically\n reproducing in the case diary all or most of the reasons\n contained in \nSection 41\n CrPC for effecting arrest be\n discouraged and discontinued.”\n\nThe directions issued in the said case are worthy to note:-\n\n “11. Our endeavour in this judgment is to ensure that police\n officers do not arrest the accused unnecessarily and\n Magistrate do not authorise detention casually and\n\n\f 23\n\n mechanically. In order to ensure what we have observed\n above, we give the following directions:\n 11.1. All the State Governments to instruct its police officers\n not to automatically arrest when a case under \nSection 498-A\n\n IPC is registered but to satisfy themselves about the\n necessity for arrest under the parameters laid down above\n flowing from \nSection 41\n CrPC;\n\n 11.2. All police officers be provided with a check list\n containing specified sub-clauses under \nSection 41(1)(b)(ii)\n;\n 11.3. The police officer shall forward the check list duly filled\n and furnish the reasons and materials which necessitated\n the arrest, while forwarding/producing the accused before\n the Magistrate for further detention;\n\n 11.4. The Magistrate while authorising detention of the\n accused shall peruse the report furnished by the police\n officer in terms aforesaid and only after recording its\n satisfaction, the Magistrate will authorise detention;\n 11.5. The decision not to arrest an accused, be forwarded to\n the Magistrate within two weeks from the date of the\n institution of the case with a copy to the Magistrate which\n may be extended by the Superintendent of Police of the\n district for the reasons to be recorded in writing;\n 11.6. Notice of appearance in terms of \nSection 41-A\n CrPC\n be served on the accused within two weeks from the date of\n institution of the case, which may be extended by the\n Superintendent of Police of the district for the reasons to be\n recorded in writing;\n\n 11.7. Failure to comply with the directions aforesaid shall\n apart from rendering the police officers concerned liable for\n departmental action, they shall also be liable to be punished\n for contempt of court to be instituted before the High Court\n having territorial jurisdiction.\n\n 11.8. Authorising detention without recording reasons as\n aforesaid by the Judicial Magistrate concerned shall be liable\n for departmental action by the appropriate High Court.”\n\n26. The aforesaid decision, as is perceptible, is in accord with the\n\nlegislative provision. The directions issued by the Court are in the nature\n\nof statutory reminder of a constitutional court to the authorities for proper\n\n\f 24\n\nimplementation and not to behave like emperors considering the notion\n\nthat they can do what they please. \nIn this context, we may refer with\n\nprofit to a passage from \nJoginder Kumar v. State of U.P\n and others6:-\n\n “20. … No arrest can be made in a routine manner on a\n mere allegation of commission of an offence made against a\n person. It would be prudent for a police officer in the interest\n of protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen and\n perhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made\n without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some\n investigation as to the genuineness and bona fides of a\n complaint and a reasonable belief both as to the person‟s\n complicity and even so as to the need to effect arrest.\n Denying a person of his liberty is a serious matter. The\n recommendations of the Police Commission merely reflect\n the constitutional concomitants of the fundamental right to\n personal liberty and freedom. A person is not liable to arrest\n merely on the suspicion of complicity in an offence. There\n must be some reasonable justification in the opinion of the\n officer effecting the arrest that such arrest is necessary and\n justified. Except in heinous offences, an arrest must be\n avoided if a police officer issues notice to person to attend\n the Station House and not to leave the Station without\n permission would do.”\n\n27. Again, the Court in \nJoginder Kumar\n (supra), while voicing its\n\nconcern regarding complaints of human rights pre and after arrest,\n\nobserved thus:-\n\n “9. A realistic approach should be made in this direction. The\n law of arrest is one of balancing individual rights, liberties and\n privileges, on the one hand, and individual duties, obligations\n and responsibilities on the other; of weighing and balancing\n the rights, liberties and privileges of the single individual and\n those of individuals collectively; of simply deciding what is\n wanted and where to put the weight and the emphasis; of\n\n6\n\n (1994) 4 SCC 260\n\n\f 25\n\n deciding which comes first—the criminal or society, the law\n violator or the law abider….”\n\n28. \nIn \nD.K. Basu v. State of W.B.7\n, after referring to the authorities in\n\nJoginder Kumar\n (supra), \nNilabati Behera v. State of Orissa\n and\n\nothers8 and \nState of M.P. v. Shyamsunder Trivedi\n and others9, the\n\nCourt laid down certain guidelines and we think it appropriate to\n\nreproduce the same:-\n\n “(1) The police personnel carrying out the arrest and\n handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear\n accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with\n their designations. The particulars of all such police\n personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be\n recorded in a register.\n\n (2) That the police officer carrying out the arrest of the\n arrestee shall prepare a memo of arrest at the time of arrest\n and such memo shall be attested by at least one witness,\n who may either be a member of the family of the arrestee or\n a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is\n made. It shall also be countersigned by the arrestee and\n shall contain the time and date of arrest.\n (3) A person who has been arrested or detained and is\n being held in custody in a police station or interrogation\n centre or other lock-up, shall be entitled to have one friend or\n relative or other person known to him or having interest in\n his welfare being informed, as soon as practicable, that he\n has been arrested and is being detained at the particular\n place, unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is\n himself such a friend or a relative of the arrestee.\n (4) The time, place of arrest and venue of custody of an\n arrestee must be notified by the police where the next friend\n or relative of the arrestee lives outside the district or town\n through the Legal Aid Organisation in the District and the\n\n7\n\n (1997) 1 SCC 416\n\n8\n\n (1993) 2 SCC 746\n\n9\n\n (1995) 4 SCC 262\n\n\f 26\n\n police station of the area concerned telegraphically within a\n period of 8 to 12 hours after the arrest.\n\n (5) The person arrested must be made aware of this right\n to have someone informed of his arrest or detention as soon\n as he is put under arrest or is detained.\n\n (6) An entry must be made in the diary at the place of\n detention regarding the arrest of the person which shall also\n disclose the name of the next friend of the person who has\n been informed of the arrest and the names and particulars of\n the police officials in whose custody the arrestee is.\n (7) The arrestee should, where he so requests, be also\n examined at the time of his arrest and major and minor\n injuries, if any, present on his/her body, must be recorded at\n that time. The “Inspection Memo” must be signed both by the\n arrestee and the police officer effecting the arrest and its\n copy provided to the arrestee.\n\n (8) The arrestee should be subjected to medical\n examination by a trained doctor every 48 hours during his\n detention in custody by a doctor on the panel of approved\n doctors appointed by Director, Health Services of the State\n or Union Territory concerned. Director, Health Services\n should prepare such a panel for all tehsils and districts as\n well.\n\n \n(9) Copies of all the documents including the memo of\n arrest\n, \nreferred to above\n, should be sent to the Illaqa\n Magistrate for his record.\n\n (10) The arrestee may be permitted to meet his lawyer\n during interrogation, though not throughout the interrogation.\n (11) A police control room should be provided at all\n district and State headquarters, where information regarding\n the arrest and the place of custody of the arrestee shall be\n communicated by the officer causing the arrest, within 12\n hours of effecting the arrest and at the police control room it\n should be displayed on a conspicuous notice board.”\n\n29. \nIn \nLalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh\n and others10,\n\nthe Constitution Bench, referring to various provisions of \nCrPC\n, adverted\n\n10\n\n (2014) 2 SCC 1\n\n\f 27\n\nto the issue of conducting a preliminary enquiry. Eventually, the Court\n\nopined that the scope of preliminary enquiry is not to verify the veracity\n\nor otherwise of the information received but only to ascertain whether\n\nthe information reveals any cognizable offence and, thereafter,\n\nproceeded to state thus:-\n\n “120.6. As to what type and in which cases preliminary\n inquiry is to be conducted will depend on the facts and\n circumstances of each case. The category of cases in which\n preliminary inquiry may be made are as under:\n\n (a) Matrimonial disputes/family disputes\n\n (b) Commercial offences\n\n (c) Medical negligence cases\n\n (d) Corruption cases\n\n (e) Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in\n initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over 3 months‟\n delay in reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining\n the reasons for delay.\n\n The aforesaid are only illustrations and not exhaustive of\n all conditions which may warrant preliminary inquiry.”\n\n30. From the aforesaid, it is quite vivid that the Constitution Bench had\n\nsuggested that preliminary enquiry may be held in matrimonial/family\n\ndisputes.\n\n31. \nIn \nRajesh Sharma\n (supra), as is noticeable, the Court had\n\nreferred to authorities in \nArnesh Kumar\n (supra) and \nLalita Kumari\n\n(supra) and observed that:-\n\n “16. Function of this Court is not to legislate but only to\n interpret the law. No doubt in doing so laying down of norms\n\n\f 28\n\n is sometimes unavoidable. 11 Just and fair procedure being\n part of fundamental right to life,12 interpretation is required to\n be placed on a penal provision so that its working is not\n unjust, unfair or unreasonable. The court has incidental\n power to quash even a non-compoundable case of private\n nature, if continuing the proceedings is found to be\n oppressive. 13 While stifling a legitimate prosecution is\n against public policy, if the proceedings in an offence of\n private nature are found to be oppressive, power of quashing\n is exercised.\n\n 17. We have considered the background of the issue and\n also taken into account the 243rd Report of the Law\n Commission dated 30th August, 2012, 140th Report of the\n Rajya Sabha Committee on Petitions (September, 2011) and\n earlier decisions of this Court. We are conscious of the\n object for which the provision was brought into the statute. At\n the same time, violation of human rights of innocent cannot\n be brushed aside. Certain safeguards against uncalled for\n arrest or insensitive investigation have been addressed by\n this Court. Still, the problem continues to a great extent.\n\n 18. To remedy the situation, we are of the view that\n involvement of civil society in the aid of administration of\n justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating\n officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitized. It is\n also necessary to facilitate closure of proceedings where a\n genuine settlement has been reached instead of parties\n being required to move High Court only for that purpose.”\n\n32. After so stating, the directions have been issued which we have\n\nreproduced in paragraph 15 hereinabove.\n\n33. On a perusal of the aforesaid paragraphs, we find that the Court\n\nhas taken recourse to fair procedure and workability of a provision so\n\n11\n\nSahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited v. Securities and Exchange Board of India\n : (2012) 10 SCC 603,\nPara 52; SCBA v. Union of India : (1998) 4 SCC 409, Para 47; \nUnion of India v. Raghubir Singh\n (d) by Lrs.\n \n: (1989)\n2 SCC 754, Para 7; \nDayaram v. Sudhir Batham\n : (\n2012) 1 SCC 333\n\n12\n\n State of Punjab v. Dalbir Singh\n : (2012) 3 SCC 346, Paras 46, 52 & 85\n\n13\n\n Gian Singh v. State of Punjab : (2012) 10 SCC 303, Para 61\n\n\f 29\n\nthat there will be no unfairness and unreasonableness in implementation\n\nand for the said purpose, it has taken recourse to the path of\n\ninterpretation.\n \nThe core issue is whether the Court in \nRajesh Sharma\n\n(supra) could, by the method of interpretation, have issued such\n\ndirections. On a perusal of the directions, we find that the Court has\n\ndirected constitution of the Family Welfare Committees by the District\n\nLegal Services Authorities and prescribed the duties of the Committees.\n\nThe prescription of duties of the Committees and further action therefor,\n\nas we find, are beyond the Code and the same does not really flow from\n\nany provision of the Code. There can be no denial that there has to be\n\njust, fair and reasonable working of a provision. The legislature in its\n\nwisdom has made the offence under \nSection 498-A\n IPC cognizable and\n\nnon-bailable. The fault lies with the investigating agency which\n\nsometimes jumps into action without application of mind.\n \nThe directions\n\nissued in \nArnesh Kumar\n (supra) are in consonance with the provisions\n\ncontained in \nSection 41\n CrPC and \nSection 41-A\n CrPC.\n \nSimilarly, the\n\nguidelines stated in \nJoginder Kumar\n (supra) and \nD.K. Basu\n (supra)\n\nare within the framework of the Code and the power of superintendence\n\nof the authorities in the hierarchical system of the investigating agency.\n\nThe purpose has been to see that the investigating agency does not\n\nabuse the power and arrest people at its whim and fancy.\n\n\f 30\n\n34. \nIn \nRajesh Sharma\n (supra), there is introduction of a third agency\n\nwhich has nothing to do with the Code and that apart, the Committees\n\nhave been empowered to suggest a report failing which no arrest can be\n\nmade. The directions to settle a case after it is registered is not a correct\n\nexpression of law. A criminal proceeding which is not compundable can\n\nbe quashed by the High Court under \nSection 482\n CrPC. When\n\nsettlement takes place, then both the parties can file a petition under\n\nSection 482\n CrPC and the High Court, considering the bonafide of the\n\npetition, may quash the same. The power rests with the High Court.\n In\n\nthis regard, we may reproduce a passage from a three-Judge Bench in\n\nGian Singh (supra). In the said case, it has been held that:-\n\n “61. … Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory\n limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the\n guideline engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to secure the ends\n of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.\n In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\n complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and\n the victim have settled their dispute would depend on the\n facts and circumstances of each case and no category can\n be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the\n High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of\n the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity\n or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly\n quashed even though the victim or victim‟s family and the\n offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not\n private in nature and have a serious impact on society.\n Similarly, any compromise between the victim and the\n offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like\n the \nPrevention of Corruption Act\n or the offences committed\n by public servants while working in that capacity, etc.; cannot\n provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings\n involving such offences. But the criminal cases having\n\n\f 31\n\n overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on a\n different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the\n offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,\n partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising\n out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes\n where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature\n and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this\n category of cases, the High Court may quash the criminal\n proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\n between the offender and the victim, the possibility of\n conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of the\n criminal case would put the accused to great oppression and\n prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by\n not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete\n settlement and compromise with the victim.”\n\n35. \nThough Rajesh Sharma\n (supra) takes note of Gian Singh (supra),\n\nyet it seems to have it applied in a different manner. The seminal issue\n\nis whether these directions could have been issued by the process of\n\ninterpretation.\n \nThis Court, in furtherance of a fundamental right, has\n\nissued directions in the absence of law in certain cases, namely,\n\nLakshmi Kant Pandey v. Union of India14\n, \nVishaka and others v.\n\nState of Rajasthan\n and others15 and \nCommon Cause (A Registered\n\nSociety) v. Union of India\n and another16 and some others. In the\n\nobtaining factual matrix, there are statutory provisions and judgments in\n\nthe field and, therefore, the directions pertaining to constitution of a\n\nCommittee and conferment of power on the said Committee is\n\n14\n\n (1984) 2 SCC 244\n\n15\n\n (1997) 6 SCC 241\n\n16\n\n (2018) 5 SCC 1\n\n\f 32\n\nerroneous. However, the directions pertaining to Red Corner Notice,\n\nclubbing of cases and postulating that recovery of disputed dowry items\n\nmay not by itself be a ground for denial of bail would stand on a different\n\nfooting. They are protective in nature and do not sound a discordant\n\nnote with the Code. When an application for bail is entertained, proper\n\nconditions have to be imposed but recovery of disputed dowry items may\n\nnot by itself be a ground while rejecting an application for grant of bail\n\nunder \nSection 498-A\n IPC. That cannot be considered at that stage.\n\nTherefore, we do not find anything erroneous in direction Nos.\n 19(iv) and\n\n(v). So far as direction No. 19(vi) and 19(vii) are concerned, an\n\napplication has to be filed either under \nSection 205\n CrPC or \nSection 317\n\nCrPC depending upon the stage at which the exemption is sought.\n\n36. We have earlier stated that some of the directions issued in\n\nRajesh Sharma\n (supra) have the potential to enter into the legislative\n\nfield.\n \nA three-Judge Bench in \nSuresh Seth v. Commissioner, Indore\n\nMunicipal Corporation\n and others17 ruled thus:-\n\n “5. … In our opinion, this is a matter of policy for the elected\n representatives of people to decide and no direction in this\n regard can be issued by the Court. That apart this Court\n cannot issue any direction to the legislature to make any\n particular kind of enactment. Under our constitutional\n scheme Parliament and Legislative Assemblies exercise\n sovereign power to enact laws and no outside power or\n authority can issue a direction to enact a particular piece of\n legislation. In Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Assn. v.\n\n17\n\n (2005) 13 SCC 287\n\n\f 33\n\n Union of India18 (SCC para 51) it has been held that no court\n can direct a legislature to enact a particular law. Similarly,\n when an executive authority exercises a legislative power by\n way of a subordinate legislation pursuant to the delegated\n authority of a legislature, such executive authority cannot be\n asked to enact a law which it has been empowered to do\n under the delegated legislative authority. …”\n\n37.

From the aforesaid pronouncement of law, it is clear as\n noon day that it is not within the domain of the courts to\n embark upon an enquiry as to whether a particular public\n policy is wise and acceptable or whether a better policy\n could be evolved. The court can only interfere if the policy\n framed is absolutely capricious or not informed by reasons\n or totally arbitrary and founded ipse dixit offending the basic\n requirement of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. In certain\n matters, as often said, there can be opinions and opinions\n but the court is not expected to sit as an appellate authority\n on an opinion.”\n\n18\n\n (1989) 4 SCC 187\n\n19\n\n (2015) 2 SCC 796\n\n20\n\n (2004) 9 SCC 362\n\n21\n\n (1970) 1 SCC 248\n\n22\n\n (1994) 2 SCC 691\n\n23\n\n (1997) 7 SCC 592\n\n24\n\n (2011) 7 SCC 639\n\n25\n\n (1998) 4 SCC 117\n\n\f 34\n\n38. In the aforesaid analysis, while declaring the directions pertaining\n\nto Family Welfare Committee and its constitution by the District Legal\n\nServices Authority and the power conferred on the Committee is\n\nimpermissible. Therefore, we think it appropriate to direct that the\n\ninvestigating officers be careful and be guided by the principles stated in\n\nJoginder Kumar\n (supra), \nD.K. Basu\n (supra), \nLalita Kumari\n (supra)\n\nand \nArnesh Kumar\n (supra). It will also be appropriate to direct the\n\nDirector General of Police of each State to ensure that investigating\n\nofficers who are in charge of investigation of cases of offences under\n\nSection 498-A\n IPC should be imparted rigorous training with regard to\n\nthe principles stated by this Court relating to arrest.\n\n39. In view of the aforesaid premises, the direction contained in\n\nparagraph 19(i) as a whole is not in accord with the statutory framework\n\nand the direction issued in paragraph 19(ii) shall be read in conjunction\n\nwith the direction given hereinabove.\n\n40. Direction No. 19(iii) is modified to the extent that if a settlement is\n\narrived at, the parties can approach the High Court under \nSection 482\n of\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure and the High Court, keeping in view the\n\nlaw \nlaid down in\n Gian Singh (supra), shall dispose of the same.\n\n41. As far as direction Nos. 19(iv), 19(v) and 19(vi) and 19(vii) are\n\nconcerned, they shall be governed by what we have stated in paragraph\n\n35.\n\n\f 35\n\n42.
