Present application is preferred by applicants under \nSection\n11\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (in short, \"Act\n1996\") for appointment of Arbitrator. The relief prayed for are as\nunder:-\n\n (1) Appointment of Shri Vinod Kumar Bhardwaj\n (Senior Advocate) as the arbitrator be set\n aside/annulled and the proceedings undertaken so far\n be declared to be void and non-est.\n (2) Appoint an impartial, independent, and neutral\n arbitrator to preside over the arbitral proceedings and\n resolve the disputes between the parties herein;\n (3) Any other relief, which this Hon'ble Court may\n deem fit and appropriate in the facts and\n circumstances of the case, may also be ordered;\n (4) Costs.\n\n2. Brief facts of the case are that the applicants entered into an\nagreement with non-applicant on 12.09.2019 for the purpose of\nconstruction of complex. Clause 15 of the contract reads as\nunder:-\n\n 15- ;g fd mHk; i{k ds e/; ;g Hkh r; gqvk gS fd bl\n vuqca/k i= dk mHk; i{k dMkbZ ls ikyu djsxs vkSj fdlh Hkh\n fookn dh n'kk esa e/;LFkrk gsrq Jh fouksn dqekj Hkkj}kt ofj\"B\n vfHkHkk\"kd dks fu;qDr fd;k tk;sxk rFkk muds }kjk fn;k x;k\n fu.kZ; mHk; i{k dks ekuuk gksxkA\n\n3. As per the applicants, after the execution of the agreement\nbetween the parties for the purpose of construction and\ndevelopment of the property belongs to non-applicant, the\napplicants completed the construction of building/structure and\n\n 3\n\nthereafter due to some dispute between the parties in February,\n2024 the applicants received communication/notice dated\n16.02.2024 issued by non-applicant and addressed to Shri Vinod\nKumar Bhardwaj, Senior Advocate (sole Arbitrator) wherein it\nwas stated that since dispute has arisen in context of agreement\ndated 12.09.2019, the matter is referred for the purpose of\nadjudication by sole Arbitrator nominated by the parties in the\nagreement itself. The applicants after receipt of the information\nregarding referring of the dispute to the sole named Arbitrator\nmade a request to the non-applicant to discuss, negotiate and settle\nthe alleged disputes amicably without the intervention of an\nArbitrator or courts of law but the same was not accepted by the\nnon-applicant and consequently applicants issued\nnotice/communication dated 08.04.2024 once again requested to\nthe non-applicant to resolve the dispute without intervention of\nthird party and also objected regarding the appointment of Shri\nVinod Kumar Bhardwaj, Senior Advocate as sole Arbitrator and\nrequested the non-applicant to propose the name of an impartial\nand neutral arbitrator. The request of the applicants was not\naccepted by non-applicant and sole arbitrator has started the\nproceedings and appointed Shri Arun Vajpayee, Advocate as\nAdvocate Commissioner for the purpose of inspection of the site\nin question and directed the parties to be present on the site on\n21.04.2024.\n\n4. The applicants have approached this Court with a request to\nset aside/annulled the proceedings undertaken by the sole\narbitrator and appoint an impartial, independent and neutral\narbitrator. The sole ground of challenge to the appointment of sole\n\n 4\n\narbitrator who was named in the contract is on the basis that non-\napplicant was having the professional relation with the sole\narbitrator and, therefore, the sole arbitrator is ineligible to act as\nArbitrator in view of the provisions of \nSection 12(5)\n read with 7 th\n\nSchedule of the Act, 1996\n.\n\n5. Non-applicant opposed the prayer of the applicants by\nsubmitting the detailed reply wherein the execution of agreement\nis admitted. Issuance of communication dated 16.02.2024 is also\nadmitted. Receipt of notice dated 8.4.2024 issued by the applicants\nand replied by non-applicant on 12.04.2024 are also admitted.\nHowever, it is submitted that sole arbitrator is not ineligible on\naccount of professional ties and relationship between him and the\nnon-applicant and the name of the sole arbitrator was accepted by\nthe parties at the time of execution of agreement, therefore, the\nsame amounts to waiving of the objection. It is further stated in\nthe reply that the procedure for challenging the appointment of the\narbitrator and termination of the mandate is prescribed in \nSection\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n of the Act,1996 and the issue cannot be agitate before\nthis Court in the proceedings initiated under \nSection 11\n of the Act\nof 1996. It is further stated in the reply that if the applicants are\naggrieved by the appointment of the arbitrator and there are any\njustifiable ground to doubt the independence and impartiality of\nthe arbitrator, applicants may raise this ground before the\narbitrator himself and the arbitrator is empowered to decide the\nsame under the provisions of \nSection 13\n of the Act, 1996 and\nthereafter the decision of the arbitrator may be challenged before\nthe Court under \nSection 34\n of the Act. It is further stated in the\nreply that even in case the arbitrator has become ineligible due to\n\n 5\n\nthe relationship with the parties or counsel of the subject matter of\nthe dispute falls under any of the categories specified in the 7 th\nSchedule, the remedy lies to the applicants are to approach to the\ncompetent court for termination of the mandate on the ground that\nthe arbitrator has become de jure and unable to perform his\nfunctions and the same relief cannot be prayed before this Court\nunder \nSection 11\n of the Act. Non applicant prayed for dismissal of\nthe application.\n\n6. After considering the pleadings of the parties, it appears that\nthe following issue is involved in the present application:-\n\n Whether the High Court in exercise of its power\n under \nSection 11\n of the Act, 1996 can set aside/annulled\n and the proceedings undertaken by the sole named\n arbitrator and appoint new arbitrator ?\n\n7. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the\nrelationship between the non-applicant and the named arbitrator is\nadmitted and there is no iota of doubt that the named arbitrator is\nineligible to preside over the arbitration proceedings in view of the\nembargo stipulated under \nSection 12(5)\n of the Act read with 7 th\nSchedule and in such circumstances when the named Arbitrator is\nde jure ineligible to continue as the arbitrator, the proceedings\nundertaken by the arbitrator are void ab initio and the same be set\naside/annulled and independent, impartial and neutral arbitrator be\nappointed. He further submits that the applicants are raising the\nissue mainly on the ground of ineligibility of the arbitrator under\n\nSection 12 (5)\n of the Act and, therefore, there is no need to\napproach to the Court for termination of the mandate as the same\n\n 6\n\nis automatically terminated. He relied on the law laid down by the\nApex Court in the case of \nBharat Broadband Network Lt. vs.\nUnited Telecoms Ltd.\n (2019) 5 SCC 755 and para 17 and 18\nreads as under:-\n\n 17.The scheme of Sections 12, 13 and 14, therefore, is that\n where an arbitrator makes a disclosure in writing which is likely\n to give justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality,\n the appointment of such arbitrator may be challenged under\n Sections 12(1) to 12(4) read with Section 13. However, where\n such person becomes \"ineligible\" to be appointed as an\n arbitrator, there is no question of challenge to such arbitrator,\n before such arbitrator. In such a case i.e. a case which falls\n under Section 12(5), \nSection 14(1)(a)\n of the Act gets attracted\n inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of law (i.e. de\n jure), unable to perform his functions under Section 12(5), being\n ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. This being so, his\n mandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be\n substituted by another arbitrator under Section 14(1) itself. It is\n only if a controversy occurs concerning whether he has\n become de jure unable to perform his functions as such, that a\n party has to apply to the Court to decide on the termination of\n the mandate, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Thus, in all\n Section 12(5) cases, there is no challenge procedure to be\n availed of. If an arbitrator continues as such, being de\n jure unable to perform his functions, as he falls within any of the\n categories mentioned in Section 12(5), read with the Seventh\n Schedule, a party may apply to the Court, which will then decide\n on whether his mandate has terminated. Questions which may\n typically arise under Section 14 may be as to whether such\n person falls within any of the categories mentioned in the\n Seventh Schedule, or whether there is a waiver as provided in\n the proviso to \nSection 12(5)\n of the Act. As a matter of law, it is\n important to note that the proviso to Section 12(5) must be\n contrasted with \nSection 4\n of the Act. \nSection 4\n deals with cases\n of deemed waiver by conduct; whereas the proviso to Section\n 12(5) deals with waiver by express agreement in writing\n between the parties only if made subsequent to disputes having\n arisen between them.\n\n 18. On the facts of the present case, it is clear that the\n Managing Director of the appellant could not have acted as an\n arbitrator himself, being rendered ineligible to act as arbitrator\n under Item 5 of the Seventh Schedule, which reads as under:\n\n 7\n\n \"Arbitrator's relationship with the parties or counsel\n ***\n\n 5. The arbitrator is a manager, director or part of the\n management, or has a similar controlling influence, in an\n affiliate of one of the parties if the affiliate is directly involved\n in the matters in dispute in the arbitration.\"\n\n \nWhether such ineligible person could himself appoint another\n arbitrator was only made clear by this Court's judgment\n in \nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8\n SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] on 3-7-2017, this Court\n holding that an appointment made by an ineligible person is\n itself void ab initio. Thus, it was only on 3-7-2017, that it\n became clear beyond doubt that the appointment of Shri Khan\n would be void ab initio. Since such appointment goes to\n \"eligibility\" i.e. to the root of the matter, it is obvious that Shri\n Khan's appointment would be void. There is no doubt in this\n case that disputes arose only after the introduction of Section\n 12(5) into the statute book, and Shri Khan was appointed long\n after 23-10-2015.\n \nThe judgment in \nTRF Ltd. [TRF\n Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017)\n 4 SCC (Civ) 72] nowhere states that it will apply only\n prospectively i.e. the appointments that have been made of\n persons such as Shri Khan would be valid if made before the\n date of the judgment. Section 26 of the Amendment Act, 2015\n makes it clear that the Amendment Act, 2015 shall apply in\n relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after 23-10-\n 2015. Indeed, the judgment itself set aside the order\n appointing the arbitrator, which was an order dated 27-1-\n 2016, by which the Managing Director of the respondent\n nominated a former Judge of this Court as sole arbitrator in\n terms of Clause 33(d) of the purchase order dated 10-5-2014.\n It will be noticed that the facts in the present case are\n somewhat similar.\n \nThe APO itself is of the year 2014, whereas\n the appointment by the Managing Director is after the\n Amendment Act, 2015, just as in \nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo\n Engg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ)\n 72] Considering that the appointment in \nTRF Ltd. [TRF\n Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017)\n 4 SCC (Civ) 72] of a retired Judge of this Court was set aside\n as being non est in law, the appointment of Shri Khan in the\n present case must follow suit.\"\n\n8. The counsel further submits that as per \nSection 14(2)\n of the\nAct, the parties can apply to the Court, only in the event if there is\n\n 8\n\nany controversy remaining with respect to the termination of\nmandate is concerned which is in the instant case is squarely\ncovered by the admission of the non-applicant and by virtue of\noperation of law, there is no occasion to initiate such proceedings\nbefore the Court.\n\n9. The counsel for the applicants further relied on the\npronouncement of the Apex Court in the matter of \nTRF Limited\nvs. Energy Engineering Project Limited\n 2017 (8) SCC 377\nwhich reads as under:-\n\n \n32. Mr Sundaram, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant has\n also drawn inspiration from the judgment passed by the\n Designated Judge of this Court in \nWalter Bau AG [Walter Bau\n AG v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai\n, (2015) 3 SCC\n 800 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 450] , where the learned Judge, after\n referring to \nAntrix Corpn. Ltd. [Antrix Corpn. Ltd. v. Devas\n Multimedia (P) Ltd.\n, (2014) 11 SCC 560 : (2014) 4 SCC (Civ)\n 147] , distinguished the same and also distinguished the\n authority in \nPricol Ltd. v. Johnson Controls Enterprise\n Ltd. [Pricol Ltd.\n v. Johnson Controls Enterprise Ltd., (2015) 4\n SCC 177 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 530] and came to hold that :\n\n \n(\nWalter Bau AG\n case [\nWalter Bau AG v. Municipal Corpn. of\n Greater Mumbai\n, (2015) 3 SCC 800 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 450] ,\n SCC p. 806, para 10)\n\n \"10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid\n and such appointment satisfies the Court exercising jurisdiction\n under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act, acceptance of such\n appointment as a fait accompli to debar the jurisdiction under\n Section 11(6) cannot be countenanced in law. ...\"\n\n 33. We may immediately state that the opinion expressed in the\n aforesaid case is in consonance with the binding authorities we\n have referred to hereinbefore.\n\n10. \nIn case of \nAravali Power Company Private Ltd. vs. Era\nInfra Engineering Ltd.\n (2017) 15 SCC 32, Apex Court has\ncrystalized the guidelines in appointment of arbitrator after\n\n 9\n\namended Act under \nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n has come into\nforce. Relevant para 22B is quoted as under:\n\n \"22B. If the arbitration clause finds foul with the amended\n provisions, the appointment of the Arbitrator even if apparently\n in conformity with the arbitration clause in the agreement,\n would be illegal and thus the Court would be within its powers\n to appoint such arbitrator(s) as may be permissible.\"\n\n11. The Apex Court in the case of \nPerkins Eastman Architects\nDPC vs. HSCC (India) Ltd.\n AIR 2020 SC 59 has held as under:\n\n \n21. The further question that arises is whether the power can be\n exercised by this Court under \nSection 11\n of the Act when the\n appointment of an arbitrator has already been made by the\n respondent and whether the appellant should be left to raise\n challenge at an appropriate stage in terms of remedies available\n in law. Similar controversy was gone into by a Designated\n Judge of this Court in \nWalter Bau AG [Walter Bau\n AG v. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai\n, (2015) 3 SCC\n 800 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 450] and the discussion on the point\n was as under : (SCC pp. 805-06, paras 9-10)\n \"9. While it is correct that in Antrix [Antrix Corpn.\n\n \nLtd. v. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd.\n, (2014) 11 SCC 560 :\n\n \n(\n2014) 4 SCC (Civ) 147] and Pricol Ltd. [Pricol\n Ltd. v. Johnson Controls Enterprise Ltd.\n, (2015) 4 SCC\n 177 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 530] , it was opined by this Court\n that after appointment of an arbitrator is made, the remedy\n of the aggrieved party is not under Section 11(6) but such\n remedy lies elsewhere and under different provisions of the\n \nArbitration Act\n (Sections 12 and 13), the context in which\n the aforesaid view was expressed cannot be lost sight of.\n\n \nIn \nAntrix [Antrix Corpn. Ltd. v. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd.\n,\n (2014) 11 SCC 560 : (2014) 4 SCC (Civ) 147] , appointment\n of the arbitrator, as per the ICC Rules, was as per the\n alternative procedure agreed upon, whereas in \nPricol\n Ltd. [Pricol Ltd. v. Johnson Controls Enterprise Ltd.\n, (2015)\n 4 SCC 177 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 530] , the party which had\n filed the application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration\n Act had already submitted to the jurisdiction of the\n arbitrator. In the present case, the situation is otherwise.\n\n \n10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie\n valid and such appointment satisfies the Court exercising\n jurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act,\n acceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar\n\n 10\n\n the jurisdiction under Section 11(6) cannot be countenanced\n in law. In the present case, the agreed upon procedure\n between the parties contemplated the appointment of the\n arbitrator by the second party within 30 days of receipt of a\n notice from the first party. While the decision in \nDatar\n Switchgears Ltd. [Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance\n Ltd.\n, (2000) 8 SCC 151] may have introduced some\n flexibility in the time-frame agreed upon by the parties by\n extending it till a point of time anterior to the filing of the\n application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act, it\n cannot be lost sight of that in the present case the\n appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is clearly contrary\n to the provisions of the Rules governing the appointment of\n arbitrators by ICADR, which the parties had agreed to abide\n by in the matter of such appointment. The option given to\n the respondent Corporation to go beyond the panel\n submitted by ICADR and to appoint any person of its choice\n was clearly not in the contemplation of the parties. If that\n be so, obviously, the appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane\n is non est in law. Such an appointment, therefore, will not\n inhibit the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under\n \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act. It cannot, therefore, be\n held that the present proceeding is not maintainable in law.\n\nThe appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane made beyond 30\n days of the receipt of notice by the petitioner, though may\n appear to be in conformity with the law \nlaid down in\n \nDatar\n Switchgears Ltd. [Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance\n Ltd.\n, (2000) 8 SCC 151] , is clearly contrary to the agreed\n procedure which required the appointment made by the\n respondent Corporation to be from the panel submitted\n by ICADR. The said appointment, therefore, is clearly invalid\n in law.\"\n\n22. It may be noted here that the aforesaid view of the Designated\nJudge in \nWalter Bau AG [Walter Bau AG v. Municipal Corpn. of\nGreater Mumbai\n, (2015) 3 SCC 800 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 450]\nwas pressed into service on behalf of the appellant in \nTRF\nLtd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 :\n\n(2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] and the opinion expressed by the\nDesignated Judge was found to be in consonance with the binding\nauthorities of this Court. It was observed : (\nTRF\n case [\nTRF\nLtd. v. Energo Engg.

We may immediately state that the opinion expressed in\n the aforesaid case is in consonance with the binding\n authorities we have referred to hereinbefore.\"\n\n 23. \nIn \nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8\n SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] , the Managing Director of the\n respondent had nominated a former Judge of this Court as sole\n arbitrator in terms of the aforesaid Clause 33(d), after which the\n appellant had preferred an application under \nSection 11(5)\n read\n with \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act. The plea was rejected by the High\n Court and the appeal therefrom on the issue whether the\n Managing Director could nominate an arbitrator was decided in\n favour of the appellant as stated hereinabove. As regards the issue\n about fresh appointment, this Court remanded the matter to the\n High Court for fresh consideration as is discernible from para 55\n of the judgment. In the light of these authorities there is no\n hindrance in entertaining the instant application preferred by the\n applicants.\n\n12. The Apex Court in the case of \nJaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak\nSahkari Sangh Ltd. v. Ajay Sales & Suppliers\n, (2021) 17 SCC\n248 has held as under:-\n\n \n8.3 So far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners that\n the agreement was prior to the insertion of sub-section (5) of\n \nSection 12\n read with the \nSeventh Schedule to the Act\n and\n therefore the disqualification under sub-section (5) of \nSection 12\n\n read with the \nSeventh Schedule to the Act\n shall not be applicable\n\n 12\n\nand that once an arbitrator Chairman started the arbitration\nproceedings thereafter the High Court is not justified in\nappointing an arbitrator are concerned the aforesaid has no\nsubstance and cannot be accepted in view of the decision of this\nCourt in \nTRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd. [TRF\nLtd.\n v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd., (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4\nSCC (Civ) 72] ; \nBharat Broadband Network Ltd. v. United\nTelecoms Ltd. [Bharat Broadband Network Ltd.\n v. United\nTelecoms Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 755 : (2019) 3 SCC (Civ)\n1] ; \nVoestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn\n.\n\nLtd. [Voestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn.\nLtd.\n, (2017) 4 SCC 665 : (2017) 2 SCC (Civ) 607] In the\naforesaid decisions this Court had an occasion to consider in\ndetail the object and purpose of insertion of sub-section (5) of\n\nSection 12\n read with the \nSeventh Schedule to the Act\n.\n\n10. It is further observed and held by this Court in \nVoestalpine\nSchienen GmbH [Voestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro\nRail Corpn. Ltd.\n, (2017) 4 SCC 665 : (2017) 2 SCC (Civ) 607]\nthat independence and impartiality of the arbitrator are the\nhallmarks of any arbitration proceedings. Rule against bias is\none of the fundamental principles of natural justice which apply\nto all judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is further\nobserved that it is for this reason that notwithstanding the fact\nthat relationship between the parties, to the arbitration and the\narbitrators themselves are contractual in nature and the source\nof an arbitrator's appointment is deduced from the agreement\nentered into between the parties, notwithstanding the same non-\nindependence and non-impartiality of such arbitrator would\nrender him ineligible to conduct the arbitration. It is further\nobserved that the genesis behind this rationale is that even when\nan arbitrator is appointed in terms of contract and by the\nparties to the contract, he is independent of the parties.\n\n18. Now so far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners\nthat the respondents participated in the arbitration proceedings\nbefore the sole arbitrator -- the Chairman and therefore he\nought not to have approached the High Court for appointment\nof the arbitrator under \nSection 11\n is concerned, the same has\nalso no substance. As held by this Court in \nBharat Broadband\nNetwork Ltd. [Bharat Broadband Network Ltd. v. United\nTelecoms Ltd.\n, (2019) 5 SCC 755 : (2019) 3 SCC (Civ) 1] there\nmust be an \"express agreement\" in writing to satisfy the\nrequirements of \nSection 12(5)\n proviso. In paras 15 & 20 it is\nobserved and held as under : (SCC pp. 768 & 770-71)\n \"15. \nSection 12(5)\n, on the other hand, is a new provision\n which relates to the de jure inability of an arbitrator to act as\n\n 13\n\nsuch. Under this provision, any prior agreement to the\ncontrary is wiped out by the non obstante clause in \nSection\n12(5)\n the moment any person whose relationship with the\nparties or the counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute\nfalls under the Seventh Schedule. The sub-section then\ndeclares that such person shall be \"ineligible\" to be\nappointed as arbitrator. The only way in which this\nineligibility can be removed is by the proviso, which again is\na special provision which states that parties\nmay, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them,\nwaive the applicability of \nSection 12(5)\n by an express\nagreement in writing. What is clear, therefore, is that where,\nunder any agreement between the parties, a person falls\nwithin any of the categories set out in the Seventh Schedule,\nhe is, as a matter of law, ineligible to be appointed as an\narbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can be\nremoved, again, in law, is that parties may after disputes\nhave arisen between them, waive the applicability of this\nsub-section by an \"express agreement in writing\".\nObviously, the \"express agreement in writing\" has reference\nto a person who is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule, but\nwho is stated by parties (after the disputes have arisen\nbetween them) to be a person in whom they have faith\nnotwithstanding the fact that such person is interdicted by the\nSeventh Schedule.\n\n ***\n\n 20. This then brings us to the applicability of the proviso\nto \nSection 12(5)\n on the facts of this case. Unlike \nSection 4\n of\nthe Act which deals with deemed waiver of the right to object\nby conduct, the proviso to \nSection 12(5)\n will only apply if\nsubsequent to disputes having arisen between the parties, the\nparties waive the applicability of sub-section (5) of \nSection\n12\n by an express agreement in writing. For this reason, the\nargument based on the analogy of \nSection 7\n of the Act must\nalso be rejected. \nSection 7\n deals with arbitration agreements\nthat must be in writing, and then explains that such\nagreements may be contained in documents which provide a\nrecord of such agreements. On the other hand, \nSection 12(5)\n\nrefers to an \"express agreement in writing\". The expression\n\"express agreement in writing\" refers to an agreement made\nin words as opposed to an agreement which is to be inferred\nby conduct. Here, \nSection 9\n of the Contract Act, 1872\nbecomes important. It states:\n\n \n'9.Promises, express and implied.--Insofar as a\n proposal or acceptance of any promise is made in words,\n\n 14\n\nthe promise is said to be express. Insofar as such proposal\nor acceptance is made otherwise than in words, the promise\nis said to be implied.'\nIt is thus necessary that there be an \"express\" agreement in\nwriting. This agreement must be an agreement by which\nboth parties, with full knowledge of the fact that Shri Khan\nis ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, still go ahead\nand say that they have full faith and confidence in him to\ncontinue as such. The facts of the present case disclose no\nsuch express agreement. The appointment letter which is\nrelied upon by the High Court [\nBharat Broadband Network\nLtd. v. United Telecoms Ltd.\n, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 11905]\nas indicating an express agreement on the facts of the case\nis dated 17-1-2017. On this date, the Managing Director of\nthe appellant was certainly not aware that Shri Khan could\nnot be appointed by him as \nSection 12(5)\n read with the\nSeventh Schedule only went to the invalidity of the\nappointment of the Managing Director himself as an\narbitrator.\n \nShri Khan's invalid appointment only became\nclear after the declaration of the law by the Supreme Court\nin \nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n,\n(2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] which, as we\nhave seen hereinabove, was only on 3-7-2017.\n \nAfter this\ndate, far from there being an express agreement between\nthe parties as to the validity of Shri Khan's appointment,\nthe appellant filed an application on 7-10-2017 before the\nsole arbitrator, bringing the arbitrator's attention to the\njudgment in \nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects\nLtd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] and\nasking him to declare that he has become de jure incapable\nof acting as an arbitrator. Equally, the fact that a statement\nof claim may have been filed before the arbitrator, would\nnot mean that there is an express agreement in words which\nwould make it clear that both parties wish Shri Khan to\ncontinue as arbitrator despite being ineligible to act as\nsuch.\n \nThis being the case, the impugned judgment [\nBharat\nBroadband Network Ltd. v. United Telecoms Ltd.\n, 2017\nSCC OnLine Del 11905] is not correct when it applies\n\nSection 4\n, \nSection 7\n, \nSection 12(4)\n, \nSection 13(2)\n and\n\nSection 16(2)\n of the Act to the facts of the present case, and\ngoes on to state that the appellant cannot be allowed to\nraise the issue of eligibility of an arbitrator, having itself\nappointed the arbitrator. The judgment under appeal is also\nincorrect in stating that there is an express waiver in\nwriting from the fact that an appointment letter has been\n\n 15\n\n issued by the appellant, and a statement of claim has been\n filed by the respondent before the arbitrator. The moment\n the appellant came to know that Shri Khan's appointment\n itself would be invalid, it filed an application before the\n sole arbitrator for termination of his mandate.\"\n\n 19. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above once the\n sole arbitrator Chairman is \"ineligible\" to act as an arbitrator to\n resolve the dispute between the parties in view of sub-section (5)\n of \nSection 12\n read with the \nSeventh Schedule to the Act\n he loses\n mandate to continue as a sole arbitrator. Therefore, it cannot be\n said that the High Court has committed any error in appointing\n the arbitrator other than the sole arbitrator -- the Chairman as\n per Clause 13 of the agreement in exercise of powers, under\n \nSection 11\n read with \nSection 14\n of the Act.\n\n13. The coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of M/s Om\nSai RK Construction Pvt. Ltd. vs. M/s Forsight Infractech Pvt.\nLtd has held as under:-\n\n \n\"27. Since the appointment of arbitrator at the instance of\n contractor is contrary to law and therefore, ineligible\n appointment deserves to be set aside and it can be removed at\n stage of passing of award (See : \nHaryana Space Application\n Centre and Others Vs. Pan India Consultants Pvt. Ltd.\n, 2021 (3)\n SCC 103) and contention of the respondent is that applicant\n submitted the jurisdiction of the arbitrator is misplaced because\n applicant did not submit to jurisdiction of arbitrator and in fact\n informed the arbitrator about unilateral and invalid appointment\n process and proceedings were void ab initio.\n\n 28. In cumulatively case of the applicant succeeds and\n appointment of arbitrator at the instances of\n respondent/contractor hereby set aside and resultantly\n appointment and all proceedings 21 A.C.No.32/2021 undertaken\n by arbitrator is hereby set aside.\"\n\n14. Counsel for the applicants on the strength of the above\njudicial pronouncements prayed for allowing the present petition.\n\n15. Per contra, counsel for the non-applicant submits that in the\nagreement dated 12.09.2019 the period was fixed for the purpose\nof completion of the construction work as the same was not\n\n 16\n\ncompleted within the period, the dispute was referred to the named\narbitrator who is senior Advocate as per Clause 15 of the\nAgreement and the named arbitrator after receipt of the request of\nthe non-applicant initiated the arbitration proceedings and\nappointed the Advocate Commissioner. However, the applicants\ninstead of filing the objection before the named arbitrator\napproached this Court under \nSection 11\n of the Act, 1996 with a\nprayer to set aside/annulled the arbitration proceedings and for\nappointment of new arbitrator. The counsel further submits that\nthe applicants have raised the objections not only under \nSection\n12(5)\n of the Act in the present petition but under \nSection 12(1)\n of\nthe Act also and for that purpose it is essential to raise the same\nbefore the arbitrator and in case the objections are turned down by\nthe arbitrator then the remedy is available to the applicants under\n\nSection 34\n of the Act to challenge the order of the arbitrator.\nHowever, the applicants have approached this Court straightway\nwithout approaching the court.\n\n16. Counsel for the non-applicant further submits that so far as\nthe grounds of ineligibility of the sole arbitrator is concerned, the\nremedy lies under \nSection 14\n of the Act and the applicants ought\nto have approached to the court for termination of the mandate. In\nthe present application filed under \nSection 11\n of the Act of 1996\nthe mandate can't be terminated. He further submits that in the\nagreement with the consent of the parties it was decided that in\ncase of any dispute the matter shall be referred to the named\narbitrator and, therefore, it will be deemed to be waiver of the\nobjection by the applicants. He further submits that even in the\njudgment relied upon by the applicants delivered in the matter of\n\n 17\n\nBharat Broadband Network\n (supra) the Apex Court has held\nthat for violation of Section 12(5) read with 7th \nSchedule of the Act\n\na party is required to file application under \nSection 14 (2)\n of the\nAct before the Court.\n \nHe further submits that judgment delivered\nin the matter of \nJaipur Zila Dugdh Utpadak Sahkari Sangh\n\n(supra) the Apex Court has held that the agreement was executed\nbetween the parties prior to the insertion of sub Section (5) of\nSection 12 and 7th Schedule to the Act and under those\ncircumstances the matter was decided. Therefore\n, \nthe said\njudgment\n is also not applicable.\n\n17. Learned counsel for the non-applicant relied on the\njudgment delivered by the Apex Court in the matter of HRD\nCorp. (\nMarcus Oil & Chemical Division vs. Gail\n, reported in\n2018 12 SCC 471 wherein it is held as under:-\n\n 12. After the 2016 Amendment Act, a dichotomy is made by the\n Act between persons who become \"ineligible\" to be appointed as\n arbitrators, and persons about whom justifiable doubts exist as to\n their independence or impartiality. Since ineligibility goes to the\n root of the appointment, Section 12(5) read with the Seventh\n Schedule makes it clear that if the arbitrator falls in any one of\n the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he becomes\n \"ineligible\" to act as arbitrator. Once he becomes ineligible, it is\n clear that, under Section 14(1)(a), he then becomes de jure\n unable to perform his functions inasmuch as, in law, he is\n regarded as \"ineligible\". In order to determine whether an\n arbitrator is de jure unable to perform his functions, it is not\n necessary to go to the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 13. Since\n such a person would lack inherent jurisdiction to proceed any\n further, an application may be filed under Section 14(2) to the\n Court to decide on the termination of his/her mandate on this\n ground. As opposed to this, in a challenge where grounds stated\n in the Fifth Schedule are disclosed, which give rise to justifiable\n doubts as to the arbitrator's independence or impartiality, such\n doubts as to independence or impartiality have to be determined\n as a matter of fact in the facts of the particular challenge by the\n Arbitral Tribunal under Section 13. If a challenge is not\n\n 18\n\n successful, and the Arbitral Tribunal decides that there are no\n justifiable doubts as to the independence or impartiality of the\n arbitrator/arbitrators, the Tribunal must then continue the\n arbitral proceedings under Section 13(4) and make an award. It\n is only after such award is made, that the party challenging the\n arbitrator's appointment on grounds contained in the Fifth\n Schedule may make an application for setting aside the arbitral\n award in accordance with Section 34 on the aforesaid grounds. It\n is clear, therefore, that any challenge contained in the Fifth\n Schedule against the appointment of Justice Doabia and Justice\n Lahoti cannot be gone into at this stage, but will be gone into\n only after the Arbitral Tribunal has given an award. Therefore,\n we express no opinion on items contained in the Fifth Schedule\n under which the appellant may challenge the appointment of\n either arbitrator. They will be free to do so only after an award is\n rendered by the Tribunal.\n\n18. In Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. Administrative Building Vs.\nM/s. Transtonnelstroy Afcons (JV) & Anr. reported in 2023\nSCC OnLine SC 1370 the Apex Court has held as under:\n\n 24. Returning to the present case, \nSection 12 (1)\n of the Act\n applies at the stage of appointment - which mandates disclosure\n requirements applicable to arbitrators; (a) sets out the kinds of\n influence which may lead to 'justifiable doubts' about\n 'independence and impartibility'; Section 12 (1)(b) sets out the\n disclosure requirement with respect to the arbitrator's ability to\n \"devote sufficient time\". Explanation (1) refers to the grounds\n of possible conflicts, which need disclosure : they are\n enumerated under separate heads under \nSection 34\n of the Act,\n and grouped in seven broad categories in the \nFifth Schedule to\n the Act\n. The second explanation to Section 12(1) requires\n disclosure in the form set out in the Sixth Schedule.\n\n 25. Section 12(2) requires disclosure of any event or\n circumstance which is mandatorily to be shared with the parties\n\n - if such circumstances arise after the appointment. Section\n 12(3) lays out the grounds of challenge to an arbitrator if\n \"justifiable doubts\" exist in relation to his \"independence or\n impartiality\". Section 12(4) restricts challenge by parties - after\n appointment \"only for reasons which he becomes aware after\n appointment is made\".\n\n 26. Section 12(5) was inserted w.e.f. 23.10.2016; it begins\n with a non-obstante clause overriding any \"prior agreement to\n the contrary\" and stipulates that any person with any kind of\n\n 19\n\nrelationship set out in the Seventh Schedule (which outlines 19\nspecific heads and types of relationships - professional, familiar\nor associational) would be ineligible for appointment as\narbitrator. The proviso to Section 12(5) enables the parties to\nwaive the ineligibility conditions under Section 12(5) (read with\nSeventh Schedule) by express agreement in writing.\n\n27. Section 13 (1) deals with the challenge procedure and\nenables parties to agree on a procedure to challenge the\narbitrator. By Section 13(2), if there is no agreement, the party\nwho intends to challenge the arbitrator has to within 15 days\nafter becoming aware of the tribunal's constitution or within\nfifteen days after becoming aware of any circumstances referred\nto in Section 12(3) apply in writing to the reasons for challenge\nto a tribunal. Section 12(3), as noticed earlier, states that the\ngrounds of challenge to existence of circumstances, giving rise\nto justifiable doubts about tribunal's independence or\nimpartiality. Section 13(3) states that if the arbitrator does not\nwithdraw or the other party does not in the absence of the other\nparty agreeing according to the challenge; the tribunal has to\ndecide upon it. By Section 13(4) if the challenge is unsuccessful\nthe tribunal would continue with the proceedings and finalize its\naward. Section 13(5) states that any party can challenge the\narbitrator's decision, after the award is made under Section 34.\n\nSection 13(6) keeps open the issue of fee to be payable to the\narbitrator in the event, the award is set aside on the ground\nunder Section 13(5).\n\n28. Section 14 deals with the contingency of failure or\nimpossibility of the arbitrator or tribunal to act and stipulates\nthat the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he shall be\nsubstituted by another \"if he becomes de jure or de facto unable\nto perform its functions or for other reasons fails to act without\nundue delay or withdraws from his office or parties agrees to\nthe termination of his mandate\". By Section 14(2) if a\ncontroversy remains, concerning the grounds referred to in\nSection 14 (1), the Court may be approached by the parties to\ndecide upon the issue of termination on mandate.\n\n29. Having regard to the above statutory position it would\nbe necessary to consider the judgments cited. The first in this\nseries would be \nVoestalpine Schienen GMBH v. Delhi Metro\nRail Corporation Ltd.,19\n where taking note of the amendment\nmade to the Act in 2015, the Court underlined that it was with\nthe objective to induce neutrality of arbitrators especially their\nindependence and impartiality that the amendment act of 2015\n\n 20\n\n was introduced. The amended provision was enacted to identify\n the circumstances that gave rise to justifiable doubts about the\n independence or impartiality of the arbitrator and in the event,\n any of those circumstances exist, the remedy provided is under\n Section 12. The court particularly underlined Section 12(5)\n which nullified prior agreements to the contrary. In the facts of\n that case, it was held that if an advisor had any past or present\n business relationship with a party, he was ineligible to act as\n arbitrator.\n\n 32. It is, therefore, evident that the rules for disqualification\n or ineligibility are fairly clear. The ineligibility which attaches\n to the appointment is the first category : it is contained in\n Section 12(1) read with the explanation and the \nFifth Schedule\n to the Act\n. As recounted earlier this schedule has 34 items. In\n the event any of these circumstances exist, the appointment of\n the arbitrator is barred. The second category is where the\n arbitrator to start with is eligible but after appointment incurs\n any, or becomes subject, to any of the conditions, as enumerated\n in the Fifth Schedule. In that event, it is open to the party to\n claim that there could be justifiable doubts about his\n independence or impartiality. The remedy even then, would be\n that the party has to seek recourse and apply to the arbitrator in\n the first stance by virtue of Section 13(2). The wording of\n Section 13(2) clarifies that a party who intends to challenge the\n arbitrator, after becoming aware of certain circumstances which\n lead to justifiable doubts, that party has to within 15 days [of\n becoming aware] approach the tribunal and seek a ruling. In\n the event the party is not successful under Section 13(4), the\n tribunal is duty bound to continue with the proceedings. When\n the award is made, it can be subjected to challenge under\n Section 34, by operation of Section 13(5). Clearly, then the\n substantive grounds and the procedure applicable in relation to\n situations where justifiable reasons exist or arise, for\n questioning the eligibility of a tribunal to decide the reference\n are enumerated in Sections 12 and 13.\n\n19. The Apex Court in the case of \nSwadesh Kumar Agarwal v.\nDinesh Kumar Agarwal\n, (2022) 10 SCC 235 has held as under:-\n\n 6. Shri Divyakant Lahoti, learned counsel appearing on behalf\n of the appellant has strenuously submitted that in the facts and\n circumstances of the case the High Court has materially erred in\n terminating the mandate of the arbitrator under Section 14(1)(a)\n of the 1996 Act on an application filed under Section 11(6) of\n the 1996 Act.\n\n 21\n\n6.1. It is further submitted that in a case, where an arbitrator\nwas already appointed by the parties themselves, subsequently,\nno application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act was\nmaintainable either to terminate the mandate of the sole\narbitrator and/or to substitute the arbitrator.\n6.2. It is contended by Shri Lahoti, learned counsel that the\nmandate of the arbitrator can be terminated and/or may come\nto an end only as per the provisions of the \nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\n. Reliance is placed upon Sections 13, 14,\n15, 25(a), 30 and 32 of the 1996 Act. It is submitted that other\nthan the aforesaid provisions under the 1996 Act, there is no\nprovision to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator.\n6.3. It is submitted that in case of the eventualities mentioned in\nSection 14(1)(a) of the 1996 Act, the remedy available to the\naggrieved party would be to approach the \"court\" as defined\nunder \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the 1996 Act.\n\n6.4. Shri Lahoti, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant further submitted that in the present case as such\nRespondents 1 and 3 herein parties to the arbitration\nproceedings, in fact, did submit the applications under Section\n14(2) of the 1996 Act, which were pending before the court\nconcerned at the time when the present applications under\nSection 11(6) of the 1996 Act was filed.\n\n6.5. It is further urged that in fact, there is a difference and\ndistinction between Section 11(5) and Section 11(6) of the 1996\nAct.\n\n6.6. That in the absence of any written contract containing the\narbitration agreement, Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act shall not\nbe applicable and therefore, an application under that provision\nshall not be maintainable.\n\n6.7. That even otherwise, there was no undue delay in the\narbitration proceedings on the part of the sole arbitrator which\ncould have led to termination of his mandate that too, in\nexercise of powers under Section 11(5) and Section 11(6) of the\n1996 Act.\n\n6.8. It is further submitted by Shri Lahoti, learned counsel\nappearing on behalf of the appellant that as there was no undue\ndelay on the part of the sole arbitrator therefore, Section 14(1)\n\n(a) would not be attracted. Therefore, application under Section\n14 of the 1996 Act was liable to be dismissed and the learned\ntrial court ought to have allowed the application filed by the\nappellant, to reject the application under Section 14 of the 1996\nAct in exercise of powers under Order 7 Rule 11\nCPC\n. It is\nsubmitted that the High Court committed a grave error in\ndismissing the writ petitions and confirming the order passed\n\n 22\n\n by the learned trial court in dismissing the application under\n Order 7 Rule 11\nCPC\n.\n\n \n6.9. Shri Lahoti, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n appellant heavily relied upon the decision of this Court\n in \nAntrix Corpn. Ltd. v. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd. [Antrix\n Corpn. Ltd.\n v. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd., (2014) 11 SCC 560 :\n\n (2014) 4 SCC (Civ) 147] (paras 31 and 33) and the subsequent\n decision of this Court in S.P. Singla Constructions (P)\n Ltd. v. State of H.P. [S.P. Singla Constructions (P) Ltd. v. State\n of H.P., (2019) 2 SCC 488 : (2019) 1 SCC (Civ) 748] in support\n of his submissions that once the parties have invoked the\n arbitration proceedings and the arbitrator has been appointed,\n subsequent application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act\n shall not be maintainable.\n\n20. Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Shivhare\nRoad Lines vs. M/s. Container Corporation Of India Ltd.\nReported in 2017 3 MPLJ 600 has held as under:-\n\n 5.1 A plain reading of section 12(3)(a) reflects that lack of\n independence and impartiality are the grounds on which\n appointment of an Arbitrator can be challenged. Since the\n parties to the Agreement have not agreed upon any procedure\n for challenging the Arbitrator appointed under the Agreement,\n sections 13(2),(3),(4) and (5) of the Act, 1996 would apply for\n challenging the mandate of the Arbitrator who has suffered loss\n of confidence on the ground of lack of independence and\n impartiality, for which a written objection is required to be sent\n by the aggrieved party to the arbitral tribunal. On receipt of the\n said objection, Arbitrator under section 13(3) either withdraws\n from his office voluntarily or on the basis of the consensus\n between the rival parties, failing which the arbitral tribunal is\n mandated by law to decide on the challenge.\n\n 5.2 In the instant case, the written objection P/13 has been\n considered and rejected by the Arbitrator vide P/16 on 8-12-\n\n 2015. In such a situation, the provisions of section 13(4) come\n into operation providing that in case of failure of the objection\n raised to the impartiality and independence of the Arbitrator, the\n Arbitrator is mandated by law to continue arbitral proceedings\n and proceed to render the arbitral award.\n\n 5.3 Thereafter the remedy available to the aggrieved party who\n raises an objection unsuccessfully is provided under section\n 13(5) which enables the aggrieved party to challenge the Award\n made under section 13(4) by praying for it's setting aside under\n\n 23\n\n section 34 of the 1996 Act.\n\n 5.4 It is admitted at the bar that the arbitral proceedings have\n not yet terminated as the same are pending and an award by the\n Arbitrator as contemplated by section 13(4) has not been passed\n till date.\n\n21. Counsel for the non-applicant submits that as no application\nwas moved under Section 14(2) before the Court, arbitration\nproceedings cannot be set aside or annulled by this Court and\ntherefore, the application is liable to be dismissed.\n\n22. Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for the\nparties and after perusal of the documents available on record it is\nnot in dispute that the parties have entered into agreement on\n12.09.2019 for the purpose of raising construction and\ndevelopment of the subjected land. It is also not is dispute that\nnon-applicant referred the matter by invoking the arbitration\nClause to the named sole arbitrator and after receipt of the\ninformation the applicants issued a notice wherein they sought\nconsent of the non-applicant for appointment of any impartial\nunbiased eligible arbitrator and as the same was not accepted, the\npresent application is filed.\n\n23. The following provisions of the Act, 1996 are relevant for\nthe purpose of deciding the present application which reads as\nunder:\n\n \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the Arbitration And Conciliation Act, 1996\n\n (e)[ \"Court\" means-\n\n (i)in the case of an arbitration other than international\n commercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of original\n jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in\n exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having\n jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter\n of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a\n\n 24\n\n suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a grade inferior to\n such principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes;\n\n (ii)in the case of international commercial arbitration, the\n High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil\n jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions\n forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had\n been the subject-matter of a suit, and in other cases, a High\n Court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of\n courts subordinate to that High Court;]\n\nSection 4\n. Waiver of right to object.-A party who knows that-\n\n (a)any provision of this Part from which the parties may\n derogate, or\n\n (b)any requirement under the arbitration agreement,has not\n been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration\n without stating his objection to such non-compliance without\n undue delay or, if a time limit is provided for stating that\n objection, within that period of time, shall be deemed to have\n waived his right to so object.\n\nSection 12. Grounds for challenge.- [(1) When a person is\napproached in connection with his possible appointment as an\narbitrator, he shall disclose in writing any circumstances,-\n\n (a)such as the existence either direct or indirect, of any\n past or present relationship with or interest in any of the\n parties or in relation to the subject-matter in dispute,\n whether financial, business, professional or other kind,\n which is likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his\n independence or impartiality; and\n\n (b)which are likely to affect his ability to devote sufficient\n time to the arbitration and in particular his ability to\n complete the entire arbitration within a period of twelve\n months.\n\n Explanation 1. - The grounds stated in the Fifth\n Schedule shall guide in determining whether\n circumstances exist which give rise to justifiable\n doubts as to the independence or impartiality of an\n arbitrator.\n\n Explanation 2. - The disclosure shall be made by\n such person in the form specified in the Sixth\n Schedule.]\n (2)An arbitrator, from the time of his appointment and\n throughout the arbitral proceedings, shall, without delay,\n\n 25\n\n disclose to the parties in writing any circumstances\n referred to in sub-section (1) unless they have already\n been informed of them by him.\n\n (3)An arbitrator may be challenged only if.\n\n (a)circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable\n doubts as to his independence or impartiality, or\n\n (b)he does not possess the qualifications agreed to by\n the parties.\n\n (4)A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by him,\n or in whose appointment he has participated, only for\n reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment\n has been made.\n\n (5)[ Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary,\n any person whose relationship, with the parties or\n counsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under\n any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule\n shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator:\n\n Provided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having\n arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-\n section by an express agreement in writing.]\nSection 13. Challenge procedure. (1)Subject to sub-section\n(4), the parties are free to agree on a procedure for\nchallenging an arbitrator.\n\n(2)Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (1), a\nparty who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall, within\nfifteen days after becoming aware of the constitution of the\narbitral tribunal or after becoming aware of any\ncircumstances referred to in sub-section (3) of section 12,\nsend a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to\nthe arbitral tribunal.\n\n(3)Unless the arbitrator challenged under sub-section (2)\nwithdraws from his office or the other party agrees to the\nchallenge, the arbitral tribunal shall decide on the\nchallenge.\n\n(4)If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the\nparties or under the procedure under sub-section (2) is not\nsuccessful, the arbitral tribunal shall continue the arbitral\nproceedings and make an arbitral award.\n\n(5)Where an arbitral award is made under sub-section (4),\nthe party challenging the arbitrator may make an\napplication for setting aside such an arbitral award in\n\n 26\n\n accordance with section 34.\n\n (6)Where an arbitral award is set aside on an application\n made under sub-section (5), the Court may decide as to\n whether the arbitrator who is challenged is entitled to any\n fees.\n\n Section 14. Failure or impossibility to act.- [(1) The\n mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate and he shall be\n substituted by another arbitrator, if']\n\n (a)he becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his\n functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue\n delay; and\n\n24. Applicants have challenged the appointment of named\narbitrator on the ground that the arbitrator is having relationship\nwith the non-applicant and non-applicant had worked in the office\nof the arbitrator as Junior Lawyer, therefore, the arbitrator is\nineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator in view of the 7 th\nSchedule and his appointment is void ab initio. Present application\nis moved under Section 11 for appointment of arbitrator. Sole\narbitrator has already initiated the proceedings and he has not\nwithdrawn himself from the office of arbitrator, therefore, the\nissue of ineligibility is required to be decided by the court and the\napplicants may apply to the court which will then decide on\nwhether his mandate is terminated or not. The Apex Court in the\nmatter of \nBharat Broadband\n (supra) after considering the report\nof law commission explained the scheme of Section 12, 13 and 14\nand held that wherein arbitrator makes a disclosure in writing\nwhich is likely to give justifiable doubts as to his independence or\nimpartiality, the appointment of such arbitrator may be challenged\nunder Sections 12(1) to 12(4) read with Section 13. However,\nwhere such person becomes \"ineligible\" to be appointed as an\narbitrator, there is no question of challenge to such arbitrator,\n\n 27\n\nbefore such arbitrator. In such a case, i.e., a case which falls under\nSection 12(5), \nSection 14(1)(a)\n of the Act gets attracted inasmuch\nas the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of law (i.e., de jure) and\nunable to perform his functions under Section 12(5), being\nineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. This being so, his\nmandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be substituted\nby another arbitrator under Section 14(1) itself. It is only if a\ncontroversy occurs concerning whether he has become de jure\nunable to perform his functions as such, that a party has to apply\nto the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate, unless\notherwise agreed by the parties. Thus, in all Section 12(5) cases,\nthere is no challenge procedure to be availed of. If an arbitrator\ncontinues as such, being de jure unable to perform his functions,\nas he falls within any of the categories mentioned in Section 12(5),\nread with the Seventh Schedule, a party may apply to the Court,\nwhich will then decide on whether his mandate has terminated.\nQuestions which may typically arise under Section 14 may be as\nto whether such person falls within any of the categories\nmentioned in the Seventh Schedule, or whether there is a waiver\nas provided in the proviso to \nSection 12(5)\n of the Act. As a matter\nof law, it is important to note that the proviso to Section 12(5)\nmust be contrasted with \nSection 4\n of the Act. \nSection 4\n deals with\ncases of deemed waiver by conduct; whereas the provisons to\nSection 12(5) deals with waiver by express agreement in writing\nbetween the parties only if made subsequent to disputes having\narisen between them.\n\n25. In view of the above pronouncement of the Apex Court,\nthere is no scope for setting aside or terminating the mandate of\n\n 28\n\narbitrator in an application filed under \nSection 11\n of the Act, 1996\nas in the present matter the arbitrator is continuing the proceedings\nand he has not withdrawn himself from the office of the arbitrator.\nNon-applicant has claimed that the arbitrator was named in the\nagreement even after knowing the fact that the non-applicant was\nhaving some professional relation with the sole arbitrator in the\npast, the same shall be treated as waiver. Under these\ncircumstances, it is essential for the applicant to approach to the\ncourt which is a court defined under \nSection 2 (e)\n of the Act i.e.\nthe principal Civil Court having original jurisdiction in the district\nas in Madhya Pradesh High Court is not having ordinary original\ncivil jurisdiction and the court will decide the controversy occurs\nconcerning whether the arbitrator has become de jure and unable\nto perform his functions or not and the court will decide the issue\nof termination of the mandate. This is not a case wherein the\narbitrator was appointed by an authority who itself is ineligible,\ntherefore, in the present matter the appointment of arbitrator\ncannot be treated as void ab initio. In the present matter, the\nparties have named the arbitrator by executing the agreement and,\ntherefore, without termination of the mandate of the arbitration by\nthe competent court new arbitrator cannot be appointed and this\nCourt does not have jurisdiction to terminate the mandate of the\narbitrator under \nSection 14\n of the Act.\n\n26. The judgment delivered by the Apex Court in the matter of\n\nBharat Broadband\n (supra) has relied by the Apex Court in the\nmatter of \nTRF Ltd.\n (supra), \nAravali Power\n (supra), \nPerkins\nEastman\n (supra), \nJaipur Zila\n (supra) and by the coordinate\nBench in the matter of Om Sai (Supra) and in none of the\n\n 29\n\n judgments it is held that if the arbitrator has not withdrawn\n himself from the office of the arbitrator and there is a dispute in\n respect to the eligibility of the arbitrator, the same can be decided\n in a petition filed under \nSection 11\n of the Act. In all the cases, the\n Apex Court has considered the fact that the arbitrator was\n appointed by the ineligible authority and, therefore, such arbitrator\n would render himself ineligible to conduct the arbitration. In none\n of the case relied by the applicants, the mandate of the named sole\n arbitrator was terminated in the proceedings arising out of\n application filed under \nSection 11\n of the Act of 1996.\n\n 27. In a case when there is a dispute/controversy on the\n mandate of the arbitrator being terminated on the ground\n mentioned in Section 14 (1) (a) such a dispute has to be raised\n before the Court \"defined under \nSection 2 (1) (e)\n of the Act, 1996\"\n\n and such a dispute cannot be decided on an application filed under\n Section 11 (6) of 1996.\n\n 28. In view of the above pronouncements of the Apex Court, the\n issue involved in the present matter is answered accordingly and\n consequently the application is disposed of with a liberty to the\n applicants to approach to the competent court for seeking\n termination of the mandate of the sole arbitrator and thereafter\n avail the remedy for appointment of arbitrator afresh.\n\n 29. With the aforesaid, the present petition is disposed of.\n\n (VINAY SARAF)\n JUDGE\nvan\n VANDANA VERMA\n 2024.05.22\n 19:42:41 +05'30'",

However, where\n such person becomes \"ineligible\" to be appointed as an\n arbitrator, there is no question of challenge to such arbitrator,\n before such arbitrator. In such a case i.e. a case which falls\n under Section 12(5), \nSection 14(1)(a)\n of the Act gets attracted\n inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of law (i.e. de\n jure), unable to perform his functions under Section 12(5), being\n ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. This being so, his\n mandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be\n substituted by another arbitrator under Section 14(1) itself. It is\n only if a controversy occurs concerning whether he has\n become de jure unable to perform his functions as such, that a\n party has to apply to the Court to decide on the termination of\n the mandate, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Thus, in all\n Section 12(5) cases, there is no challenge procedure to be\n availed of. If an arbitrator continues as such, being de\n jure unable to perform his functions, as he falls within any of the\n categories mentioned in Section 12(5), read with the Seventh\n Schedule, a party may apply to the Court, which will then decide\n on whether his mandate has terminated.

As a matter of law, it is\n important to note that the proviso to Section 12(5) must be\n contrasted with \nSection 4\n of the Act. \nSection 4\n deals with cases\n of deemed waiver by conduct; whereas the proviso to Section\n 12(5) deals with waiver by express agreement in writing\n between the parties only if made subsequent to disputes having\n arisen between them."

After the 2016 Amendment Act, a dichotomy is made by the\n Act between persons who become \"ineligible\" to be appointed as\n arbitrators, and persons about whom justifiable doubts exist as to\n their independence or impartiality. Since ineligibility goes to the\n root of the appointment, Section 12(5) read with the Seventh\n Schedule makes it clear that if the arbitrator falls in any one of\n the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he becomes\n \"ineligible\" to act as arbitrator. Once he becomes ineligible, it is\n clear that, under Section 14(1)(a), he then becomes de jure\n unable to perform his functions inasmuch as, in law, he is\n regarded as \"ineligible\". In order to determine whether an\n arbitrator is de jure unable to perform his functions, it is not\n necessary to go to the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 13. Since\n such a person would lack inherent jurisdiction to proceed any\n further, an application may be filed under Section 14(2) to the\n Court to decide on the termination of his/her mandate on this\n ground. As opposed to this, in a challenge where grounds stated\n in the Fifth Schedule are disclosed, which give rise to justifiable\n doubts as to the arbitrator's independence or impartiality, such\n doubts as to independence or impartiality have to be determined\n as a matter of fact in the facts of the particular challenge by the\n Arbitral Tribunal under Section 13.

The remedy even then, would be\n that the party has to seek recourse and apply to the arbitrator in\n the first stance by virtue of Section 13(2). The wording of\n Section 13(2) clarifies that a party who intends to challenge the\n arbitrator, after becoming aware of certain circumstances which\n lead to justifiable doubts, that party has to within 15 days [of\n becoming aware] approach the tribunal and seek a ruling. In\n the event the party is not successful under Section 13(4), the\n tribunal is duty bound to continue with the proceedings.
