Respondents\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nA. K. PATNAIK, J.\n\nThis is an appeal by way of special leave under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution against the judgment and order dated 13.09.2007 of the Gujarat\nHigh Court in Criminal Appeal No.294 of 1994.\n\nFACTS\n\n2. The facts very briefly are that the appellant was married to Laxmiben\nin 1980. The appellant, who was a teacher, used to travel in a bus along\nwith Amriben, who was also a teacher, for their work in their respective\nschools located at a distance of 2 kms. from each other. The appellant and\nAmriben fell in love and got married in 1990. A daughter was born to\nAmriben in 1991. The appellant, Laxmiben and Amriben were living together\nin different portions of one house of the appellant in village Dhuleta\nPalla. On 26.03.1992, a letter written by Amriben was received in Shamlaji\nPolice Station. In this letter, Amriben alleged inter alia that the\nappellant was more interested in money and not in love and he had\nthreatened and kidnapped her, although he had a wife and three children and\nthe appellant had cheated her and persuaded her to have civil marriage on\n21.08.1990. She further alleged in the letter that after marriage the\nappellant’s family was living on her salary and the appellant had started\ntorturing her to a limit which was no longer tolerable by her and she was\nalso not given meals and the appellant was threatening to kill her and for\nall this the appellant and his first wife Laxmiben and his other family\nmembers were involved. On 26.03.1992 in the afternoon, the appellant came\nto the school of Amriben and enquired from the Principal of the school and\nthe teacher of Amriben as to whether Amriben had made a complaint to the\nPolice Station. That evening, the appellant who usually took Amriben back\nfrom her school instead requested the Principal of her school, Ms.\nTimothibhai, to take seat on the scooter with him and as a result Amriben\nhad to walk along with Lilavatiben, who was holding her little daughter, to\nthe bus stand. During the night of 26.03.1992, the appellant slept with\nLaxmiben while Amriben slept with her new born daughter in another room of\nthe house. On 27.03.1992, early in the morning, the appellant and Laxmiben\nheard the little daughter of Amriben crying and they found that Amriben had\njumped into the well and had died.\n\n3. A post mortem on the dead body of Amriben (for short ‘the\ndeceased’) was conducted on 28.03.1992 at 2.30 p.m. and the cause\nof the death was found to be drowning. Initially, on the report of\nthe appellant, the Shamlaji Police Station registered an accidental\ndeath case under\nSection 174\nof the Criminal Procedure Code, (for\nshort ‘the\nCr.P.C\n.’). Subsequently, however, on 03.04.1992 an FIR\nwas registered by Shamlaji Police Station under\nSections 498A\nand\nof the Indian Penal Code (for short ‘the\nIPC\n’) in view of the\nallegations made by the deceased in her letter dated 26.03.1992 to\nthe police station. Investigation was carried out and a charge-\nsheet was filed against the appellant and Laxmiben under\nSections\n498A\nand\n, IPC.\n\n4. At the trial, amongst other witnesses examined on behalf of the\nprosecution, Ms. Timothibhai, Principal of the school, was examined\nas PW-1, the doctor who carried out the post mortem was examined as\nPW-2, the mother of the deceased was examined as PW-3, Lilavatiben,\nco-teacher of deceased was examined as PW-4 and the Investigating\nOfficer was examined as PW-10. The appellant also examined various\nwitnesses in his defence. The trial court by its judgment dated\n10.02.1994 in Sessions Case No.59/92 acquitted Laxmiben, but\nconvicted the appellant under\nSections 498A\nand\n, IPC, and\nsentenced him to simple imprisonment for one year and two years for\nthe two offences respectively and also imposed a fine of Rs.100/-\nfor each of the offences. Aggrieved, the appellant filed criminal\nappeal before the High Court, and by the impugned judgment, the\nHigh Court acquitted the appellant from the charge under\nSection\n, IPC, but maintained the conviction and sentence on the\nappellant under\nSection 498A\n, IPC. Aggrieved, the appellant has\nfiled this appeal.\n\nContentions of the learned Counsel for the parties:\n\n5. Learned counsel for the appellant, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, submitted\nthat in the impugned judgment, the High Court found the appellant\nto be guilty of the offence under\nSection 498A\n, IPC, because of\nsome conduct or acts of the appellant of which the deceased has\ncomplained of in her letter to the Police Station on 26.03.1992.\n\nShe submitted that the High Court held that the acts or conduct of\nthe appellant amounted to cruelty for which the appellant was\nliable for the offence under\nSection 498A\n, IPC, but did not amount\nto abetment of suicide within the meaning of\nSection 306\n, IPC. She\nsubmitted that the statements of the deceased in the letter of the\ndeceased to the Police Station (Ext.10) were not proof of the acts\nor conduct of the appellant in the letter and in any case these\nacts or conduct of the appellant did not amount to cruelty within\nthe meaning of clauses (a) or (b) of the Explanation under\nSection\n498A\n, IPC.\n\n6. Ms. Bhati submitted that the evidence of PW-3, the mother of the\ndeceased, would show that when the deceased was carrying the child,\nPW-3 had been to see the deceased and she did not find that the\ndeceased had any food problem. She also referred to the evidence\nof PW-4 to show that the appellant’s conduct was not such as to\namount to cruelty or harassment within the meaning of clauses (a)\nor (b) of the Explanation of\nSection 498A\n, IPC. She submitted that\nthe post mortem report (Ext.15), on the other hand, would show that\nthe deceased was well-nourished and was well-built and did not\nsuggest that she was starved of any food.\n\n7. Ms. Bhati cited the decision of this Court in\nState of West Bengal\nv. Orilal Jaiswal & Anr.\n[(1994) 1 SCC 73] in which it has been\nheld that the charges made against an accused under\nSection 498A\n,\nIPC, must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt and that the\nrequirement of proof is not satisfied by surmises and conjectures.\n\nShe also cited the decision of this Court in\nManju Ram Kalita v.\nState of Assam\n[(2009) 13 SCC 330] wherein it has been held that\nfor holding an accused guilty under\nSection 498A\n, IPC, it has to be\nestablished that the woman has been subjected to cruelty\ncontinuously/persistently or at least in close proximity of time to\nthe lodging of the complaint and petty quarrels cannot be termed as\n“cruelty” to attract the provisions of\nSection 498A\n, IPC, though\nmental torture to the extent that it becomes unbearable may be\ntermed as cruelty. She vehemently submitted that in this case the\nprosecution has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the\nappellant was in any way guilty of any act or conduct which is of\nthe nature described in clauses (a) and (b) of\nSection 498A\n, IPC,\nso as to amount to cruelty within the meaning of this Section and,\ntherefore, the appellant is entitled to be acquitted by this Court\nof the charge under\nSection 498A\n, IPC.\n\n8. Ms. Pinky Behera, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-\nState, on the other hand, relied on Ext.10, which is the letter\nwritten by Amriben to Shamlaji Police Station on 26.03.1992 to the\nPolice Station and submitted that there was sufficient evidence in\nExt.10 to show that the appellant had treated the deceased with\ncruelty within the meaning of\nSection 498A\n, IPC. She also relied\non the findings of the High Court in paragraph 15 of the impugned\njudgment in which the High Court has found the appellant guilty of\nthe offence punishable under\nSection 498A\n, IPC. She vehemently\nargued that even though the High Court has found that the appellant\nwas not guilty of abetment of suicide within the meaning of\nSection\n, IPC, the appellant can still be held liable for the offence\nunder\nSection 498A\n, IPC, if he had committed acts of cruelty\ntowards the deceased.\nIn support of this contention, she relied on\nthe decision of this Court in\nWest Bengal v. Orilal Jaiswal & Anr.\n\n(supra).\n\nFindings of the Court:\n\n9.\nSection 498A\n, IPC, under which the appellant’s conviction has been\nmaintained by the High Court is extracted hereinbelow:\n\n“498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\ncruelty.-- Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband\nof a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also\nbe liable to fine.\n\nExplanation.- For the purposes of this section, \"cruelty\" means-\n\n(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive\nthe woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to\nlife, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or\n\n(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to\ncoercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand\nfor any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by\nher or any person related to her to meet such demand.”\n\n10. It will be clear from the language of\nSection 498A\n, IPC, that if a\nhusband subjects his wife to cruelty, he shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall\nalso be liable to fine. The Explanation under\nSection 498A\ndefines\n“cruelty” for the purpose of\nSection 498A\nto mean any of the acts\nmentioned in clause (a) or clause (b). In this case, clause (b) is\nnot attracted as there was no harassment by the husband with a view\nto coercing her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or\nvaluable security or on account of failure by her to meet such\ndemand.\n\n11. The first limb of clause (a) of the Explanation of\nSection 498A\n,\nIPC, states that “cruelty” means any wilful conduct which is of\nsuch a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide.\nIn the present case, although the trial court found the appellant\nguilty of conduct which had driven the deceased to commit suicide\nand hence liable for the offence of abetment of suicide under\n\nSection 306\n, IPC, the High Court has given a clear finding in\nparagraph 13 of the impugned judgment that the conviction of the\nappellant under\nSection 306\n, IPC, cannot be sustained in the eye of\nlaw and the appellant deserves to be acquitted of the charge of\nabetment of suicide under\nSection 306\n, IPC. This part of the\nfinding has not been challenged by the State in appeal before this\nCourt and has, therefore, become final. Thus, the appellant cannot\nbe held guilty of any wilful conduct which was of such a nature as\nis likely to drive the deceased to commit suicide.\n\n12. The second limb of clause (a) of the Explanation of\nSection 498A\n,\nIPC, states that cruelty means any wilful conduct which is of such\na nature as to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health\n(whether mental or physical) of the woman. In the present case,\nthe High Court has recorded findings against the appellant to hold\nhim guilty of the offence under\nSection 498A\n, IPC, presumably for\n“cruelty” which falls within the second limb of clause (a) of the\nExplanation under\nSection 498A\n, IPC. The relevant findings of the\nHigh Court in paragraph 15 of the impugned judgment are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“As discussed earlier, permitting to enter his first wife in the\nhouse of deceased Amariben with new born child, is an act of the\nappellant – accused, which can be said to be a cruel act. The\ndocument Exhibit 10 indicates that she was financially exploited\nand the demand of money were made by the appellant – accused\nfrequently. She has stated that on account of this, she was\nfalling in starving. It is not in evidence that this Court can\nnotice on one fact based on biological reasons assigned that the\npregnant lady or lady, who has given birth to child, need more\nfood, as such women are feeling more hungry then other normal\nwomen. She was facing very much financial problem and there\nshould be possibility to go into depression and the present\nappellant – accused was the responsible person for creating this\nsituation. The deceased was dropped woman, but self-respect is\nprivilege of each individuals. The accused depended on the\nincome of deceased Amariben after performing second marriage with\nher and was under legal as well as moral obligation to see that\nshe may be treated well and may not be felt to insult or ignore.\nIt is settled position that the cruelty includes mental cruelty,\nphysical marks falls over the body are not required to be proved\nby the prosecution. The date of the application received by the\npolice is 26.3.1992 and the evidence of PW-1 also show that on\n26.3.1992 the appellant-accused had come to the school to inquire\nwhether the deceased Amariben had made an application to the\nPrincipal of school or not. He must have been frightened that the\ndeceased may complain genuinely to the school authority and\nGovernment and he may lose the job or at least, may invite some\ndepartmental action, so anxiety of the appellant-accused is\nfound, which is exposed in the deposition of PW-1. When the\ndeceased Amariben felt in creating apprehension in the mind that\nshe may be killed by her husband is sufficient to conclude that\nthe wife must have been treated with cruelty either mentally or\nphysically or both types of cruelty and that too frequently made\notherwise the defence ought to have prove that she was a patient\nof depression. No such suggestive evidence made to the school\nteacher or other witness including mother. Meaning thereby,\nthere is sufficient evidence to show that the deceased was\ntreated with cruelty and that had led her to frustration and\nthereafter, depression, this is not an act of commission of a\nlady with child. She had decided to jump into the well leaving\nthe child and accused behind, therefore, the act of the suicide\nappears to be intentional act to get rid of the frequent insult,\nignorance and exploitation. The learned Trial Judge has rightly\nlinked the accused with the offence punishable under\nSection\n498A\n. There is no error in evaluating the evidence so far as\ncruelty is concerned.\n\n13. Obviously, the finding of the High Court that permitting the first\nwife to enter the house of deceased Amriben with new born child\namounts to a cruel act is erroneous as such act cannot amount to\ncruelty within the meaning of second limb of clause (a) of the\nExplanation under\nSection 498-A\n, IPC. However, the High Court,\nrelying on the letter written by the deceased to the Police Station\non 26.03.1992 (Ext.10), has also come to a finding that the\nappellant had starved the deceased of food when she was pregnant by\nspending the salary earned by the deceased on his own family and\nhad also subjected the deceased to other acts of mental cruelty.\n\n14. The question that we have, therefore, to decide is whether the\nCourt could have arrived at this finding that the appellant has\nstarved the deceased and committed various acts of mental cruelty\ntowards the deceased only on the basis of the contents of the\nletter dated 26.03.1992 written by the deceased to the Police\nStation. The letter written by the deceased on 26.03.1992 could be\nrelevant only under\nSection 32(1)\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872,\nwhich provides that a statement, written or verbal, of relevant\nfacts made by a person who is dead, is relevant when the statement\nis made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of\nthe circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death,\nin cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into\nquestion. The High Court in the present case has already held that\nthe appellant was not guilty of abetting the suicide of the\ndeceased and was, therefore, not guilty of the offence under\n\nSection 306\n, IPC. As the cause of the death of the deceased is no\nmore in question in the present case, the statements made by the\ndeceased in the letter dated 26.03.1992 to the Police Station\ncannot be taken to be proof of cruel acts committed by the\nappellant for the purpose of holding him guilty under\nSection 498A\n,\nIPC.\n\n15. For taking this view, we are supported by the decision of this\nCourt in Inderpal v. State of M.P. [(2001) 10 SCC 736]. In this\ncase, Inderpal was charged and tried for the offence under\nSection\n, IPC, and convicted by the trial court for the said offence of\nabetment of suicide. In appeal filed by Inderpal, the High Court\nfound that the offence under\nSection 306\n, IPC, was not made out as\nit could not be held that death of the deceased was due to\ncommission of suicide, but the High Court held the appellant guilty\nof the offence under\nSection 498A\n, IPC. This finding of the High\nCourt was based on the evidence of the father, mother, sister and\nanother relative of the deceased who deposed on the basis of inter\nalia the two letters (Exhibits P-7 and P-8) written by the deceased\nDamyanti that Inderpal, her husband, had subjected her to beating.\nThis Court found that apart from the statement attributed to the\ndeceased, none of the witnesses had spoken of anything which they\nhad seen directly and the question that this Court had to decide\nwas whether the statement attributed to the deceased could be used\nas evidence including the contents of Exts.P-7 and P-8 and this\nCourt held that the contents of Exts. P-7 and P-8 written by the\ndeceased could not be treated as proof of the acts of cruelty by\nInderpal for the purpose of offence under\nSection 498A\n, IPC. The\nreasons given by this Court in paragraph 7 of the judgment as\nreported in the SCC are as follows:\n\n“7. Unless the statement of a dead person would fall within the\npurview of\nSection 32(1)\nof the Indian Evidence Act there is no other\nprovision under which the same can be admitted in evidence. In order\nto make the statement of a dead person admissible in law (written or\nverbal) the statement must be as to the cause of her death or as to\nany of the circumstance of the transactions which resulted in her\ndeath, in cases in which the cause of death comes into question. By\nno stretch of imagination can the statements of Damyanti contained in\nExhibit P-7 or Exhibit P-8 and those quoted by the witnesses be\nconnected with any circumstance of the transaction which resulted in\nher death. Even that apart, when we are dealing with an offence under\n\nSection 498-A\nIPC disjuncted from the offence under\nSection 306\nIPC\nthe question of her death is not an issue for consideration and on\nthat premise also\nSection 32(1)\nof the Evidence Act will stand at bay\nso far as these materials are concerned.\n\n16. In the present case also, except Ext.10, the letter written by the\ndeceased to the Police Station on 26.03.1992, no other witness has\nspoken about the appellant having starved the deceased of food and\nhaving committed acts of mental cruelty to the deceased. On the\nother hand, the mother of the deceased (PW-3) has stated in her\ncross-examination:\n\n“I have not recorded in my statement before police that Amri was\ngiving her salary to her husband. It is not true that when I\nwent to see Amri, at that time, my daughter was crying she had\nfood problem, I say it is false.”\n\n17. This being the evidence of the mother of the deceased, the High\nCourt could not have come to the conclusion that the deceased was\nsubjected to financial exploitation and starving and mental cruelty\nby the appellant. Unlike the case of\nState of West Bengal v.\nOrilal Jaiswal & Anr.\n(supra) cited by Ms. Behera in which there\nwas evidence of the husband coming home drunk and abusing and\nassaulting the deceased wife, in this case there is no evidence of\nany physical harm having been caused by the appellant to the\ndeceased nor any acts of mental cruelty committed by him. Hence,\nthe appellant cannot be held guilty of any cruelty within the\nmeaning of clause (a) of the Explanation under\nSection 498A\n, IPC.\n\n18. In the result, we set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court\nand acquit the appellant of the charge under\nSection 498A\n, IPC.\nSince the appellant is on bail, his bail bonds be discharged.\n\n..……………..……………………….J.\n(A.

ON 26.03.1992, A LETTER WRITTEN BY AMRIBEN WAS RECEIVED IN SHAMLAJI POLICE STATION. IN THIS LETTER, AMRIBEN ALLEGED INTER ALIA THAT THE APPELLANT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN MONEY AND NOT IN LOVE AND HE HAD THREATENED AND KIDNAPPED HER, ALTHOUGH HE HAD A WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN AND THE APPELLANT HAD CHEATED HER AND PERSUADED HER TO HAVE CIVIL MARRIAGE ON 21.08.1990.
