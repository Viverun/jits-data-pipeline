The defence plea of the appellants is one of denial of\n\noccurrence and of false implication. No witness was examined on\n\nbehalf of the defence nor any document was exhibited.\n\nFindings of the Trial Court:\n\n6. The learned trial Court taking into account the\n\nevidence of P.Ws.1, 2, 7, 15, 21 & 25 coupled with the inquest\n\nreport (Ext.1) and post mortem examination report (Ext.19)\n\nfinding came to hold that the prosecution has established that\n\nthe death of the deceased was a homicidal one. It was further\n\nheld that there are no eye witnesses to the occurrence and the\n\ncase is based on circumstantial evidence. The learned trial Court\n\njotted down the following six circumstances emerging from the\n\nrecords, which are as follows:-\n\n(i) The deceased was last seen with the\nappellants;\n\n(ii) The appellants were seen taking liquor in\nthe verandah of the house of one Manu Mian and\ngossiping among themselves on 21.08.2014 at\nabout 12.00 p.m. to 12.30 p.m.;\n\n(iii) The appellants were found trembling,\nworried and nervous near the house of Sk.\nKhairuddin;\n\nPage 23 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n(iv) Leaving the village Manu Mahala the\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli, accused Sk. Abid Alli and\nSk. Abdul Karim Alli in a Hero Honda Activa\nscooty at about 6.00 p.m. on 21.08.2014;\n\n(v) Detection of finger print of right index\nfinger of appellant Sk. Asif Alli by State Finger\nPrint Bureau from the Aska 40 bottle recovered\nfrom the spot;\n\n(vi) Conduct of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli and\nSk. Abid Alli in absconding from the village.\n\nSo far as the circumstance no.(i) is concerned, the\n\nlearned trial Court taking into account the evidence of P.W.17,\n\nheld that there is nothing to disbelieve in his evidence that\n\nappellant Sk. Akil Alli gagged the mouth of the deceased and\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted her and they took her. It was further\n\nheld that after the appellants took the deceased as per the\n\nevidence of P.W.17, nobody had seen the deceased till she was\n\nrecovered from the Taza of the abandoned house of Sk.\n\nKhairuddin in a senseless and seriously injured condition and she\n\nsuccumbed to her injuries prior to 8 p.m. and in absence of any\n\nexplanation from the appellants, it can safely be concluded that\n\nthey were the authors of the crime.\n\nSo far as the circumstance no.(ii) is concerned, the\n\nlearned trial Court came to hold that the evidence of P.W.6 and\n\nPage 24 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nP.W.23 that they had seen the accused persons taking liquor in\n\nthe varandah of the house of Manu Mian at about 12 p.m. or\n\n12.30 p.m. might be a circumstance against the accused\n\npersons, but it cannot be safely concluded that all the accused\n\npersons were the authors of the crime and it is not sufficient to\n\nconnect accused Sk. Abid Alli that he was also involved in the\n\ncrime as possibility cannot be ruled out that he might have left\n\nthe company of appellants Sk. Asif Alli and Sk. Akil Alli after\n\ntaking liquor in the varandah of the house of Manu Mian.\n\nSo far as the circumstance no.(iii) is concerned, the\n\nlearned trial Court held that the evidence of P.W.5 that he had\n\nseen the appellants standing near the house of Sk. Khairuddin is\n\na circumstance to connect the appellants with the crime. Since\n\nthey were planning to lift the victim on the way of her return,\n\nthey might be worried and nervous.\n\nSo far as the circumstance no.(iv) is concerned, the\n\nlearned trial Court held that mere evidence of P.W.1 that the\n\naccused Sk. Abid Alli was seen going towards village Kolta in a\n\nHero Honda Activa scooty along with appellant Sk. Asif Alli and\n\nSk. Karim Alli is not sufficient to hold that accused Sk. Abid Alli is\n\nalso responsible for the crime along with the appellants and it\n\nPage 25 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ncannot be safely concluded that the accused Sk. Abid Alli is also\n\ninvolved in the crime.\n\nSo far as the circumstance no.(v) is concerned, the\n\nlearned trial Court held that detection of right index finger print\n\nof appellant Sk. Asif Alli on Aska 40 liquor bottle recovered from\n\nthe spot clearly proved his presence at the spot i.e. in the house\n\nof Sk. Khairuddin and his involvement in the alleged crime\n\nagainst the victim.\n\nSo far as the circumstance no.(vi) is concerned, the\n\nlearned trial Court held that absconding of appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\nfrom 21.08.2014 to 05.09.2014 is a strong circumstance against\n\nhim which completes the chain against him to hold that he is one\n\nof the authors of crime along with appellant Sk. Akil Alli.\n\nHowever, it was held that the absconding of Sk. Abid Alli from\n\n21.08.2014 to 05.09.2014 cannot be regarded as a strong\n\ncircumstance against him in the absence of any other substantial\n\ncircumstance to complete the chain of circumstances to hold that\n\nhe was one of the authors of the crime.\n\nThe learned trial Court held that the prosecution has\n\nsuccessfully established the circumstances against the appellants\n\nand the chain of evidence is so complete as not to leave any\n\nreasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with their\n\nPage 26 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ninnocence and the facts so established against them are\n\nconsistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the appellants and\n\nin all human probability, they had committed the ghastly act and\n\nresponsible for the crime against the deceased. However, it was\n\nheld that the prosecution has failed to prove the chain of\n\ncircumstances against the accused Sk. Abid Alli to hold him as\n\none of the authors of the crime. Taking into account the evidence\n\nof the doctor (P.W.25) and the post mortem report (Ext.19)\n\nfindings so also the chemical examination report (Ext.25) and\n\nthe ocular evidence of the witnesses (P.Ws.1, 2, 3, 4, 7 & 15)\n\nand also the evidence of the doctor (P.W.21) who examined the\n\ndeceased first in a senseless condition, the learned trial Court\n\nheld that all the circumstances taken together made it clear that\n\nthe appellants had committed rape on the deceased who was\n\nunder twelve years of age and that the deceased was subjected\n\nto gang rape. Accordingly, while acquitting the accused Sk. Abid\n\nAlli of all the charges, found the appellants guilty under\nsections\n/\n376-A\n/\n376-D\nof the I.P.C. and\nsection 6\nof POCSO Act.\n\nThe learned trial Court after holding the appellants\n\nguilty under various offences, on the very day also heard on the\n\nquestion of sentence and came to hold that the appellants\n\nravished the deceased who was a minor girl aged about six years\n\nPage 27 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nand the offences are serious and heinous in nature and against\n\nthe norms of a healthy society and it revealed a dirty and\n\nperverted mind of human beings who had no control over their\n\ncarnal desires. The number of injuries found on the deceased\n\nshowed that she was mercilessly ravished and killed to satisfy\n\ntheir carnal desire. Taking into account the criminal antecedents\n\nof the appellant Sk. Asif Alli, it was held that after being released\n\non bail on 20.08.2014 in a case under\nsection 307\nof I.P.C., he\n\ncommitted the offences in the present case on 21.08.2014 and\n\nthus there is no chance of his reformation. It was further held\n\nthat the appellants had taken away the deceased, who was a\n\nminor girl aged about six years, with deliberate intention in order\n\nto commit rape and murder and therefore, it comes within the\n\ncategory of rarest of rare case warranting capital punishment to\n\nmeet the ends of justice.\n\nSubmission of parties:\n\n7. Sk. Zafarulla, learned counsel for the appellants\n\nargued that out of six circumstances jotted down by the learned\n\ntrial Court, circumstances nos. (iv), (v) and (vi) are not\n\napplicable for the appellant Sk. Akil Alli and circumstances nos.\n\n(ii) & (iii) are not so clinching against the said appellant and\n\ntherefore, basing only on circumstance no. (i) i.e. the last seen\n\nPage 28 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nevidence as adduced by P.W.17, it would be too risky to convict\n\nthe appellant Sk. Akil Alli under any of the offences charged.\n\nAccording to him, the sole witness P.W.17 who deposed about\n\nthe last seen being a child witness, cannot be relied upon as he\n\nhas exaggerated his version by naming two accused persons for\n\nthe first time in Court which shows that he had been tutored to\n\nspeak such names. Though P.W.17 stated that he had disclosed\n\nabout the appellants taking away the deceased before his mother\n\nbut the prosecution did not choose to examine the mother of\n\nP.W.17. Similarly P.W.17 stated that he had disclosed also\n\nbefore his tuition Miss (P.W.26) but she has also not supported\n\nthe prosecution case, for which she has been declared hostile. He\n\nplaced reliance in the case of Bhagwan Singh & others -Vrs.-\n\nState of M.P. reported in (2003) 3 Supreme Court Cases\n\n21 wherein it is held that evidence of child is required to be\n\nevaluated carefully because he is an easy prey to tutoring.\n\nThe learned counsel further argued that the second\n\ncircumstance that the appellants were seen taking liquor on the\n\nverandah of the house of one Manu Mian and gossiping among\n\nthemselves on the date of occurrence at about 12 p.m. to 12.30\n\np.m. along with accused Sk. Abid Alli (acquitted) and Sk. Abdul\n\nKarim Alli (absconder) which was two hours before the time of\n\nPage 29 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\noccurrence as deposed to by P.W.6 and P.W.23 cannot be itself a\n\nclinching evidence, particularly when as per the evidence of\n\nP.W.6, the accused persons used to take liquor in the verandah\n\nof Manu Mian regularly.\n\nThe learned counsel further argued that so far as the\n\nthird circumstance regarding the appellants were found\n\ntrembling, worried and nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin\n\nis concerned, the finding of the learned trial Court that both the\n\nappellants were planning to lift the deceased on the way of her\n\nreturn for which they might be looking worried and nervous is\n\ntotally a hypothetical finding, which cannot be construed as a\n\nconclusive circumstance.\n\nIt is argued that so far as the fourth circumstance is\n\nconcerned, the evidence of P.W.1 that he along with 40-50\n\npersons were in the field of Akhandalmani when he found the\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli, accused Sk. Abid Alli (acquitted) and Sk.\n\nAbdul Karim Alli (absconding) to be going towards village Kolta in\n\na red colour Activa is not supported by any other witnesses. The\n\nevidence of P.W.1 indicates that after seeing the accused\n\npersons going towards village Kolta, he came to know about the\n\nmissing of the deceased and also came to the house of Sk.\n\nKhairuddin where the body of the deceased was detected lying in\n\nPage 30 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\na naked condition with injuries and since he was the relative\n\nbrother of the father of the deceased so also the husband of the\n\ninformant, it was expected of him to disclose about what he had\n\nseen before them at least after P.W.17 stated about the\n\nappellants lifted away the deceased while she was returning\n\npurchasing chocolates and therefore, it is very difficult to accept\n\nthe evidence of P.W.1 and utilise this circumstance against the\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli.\n\nThe learned counsel argued that so far as the fifth\n\ncircumstance i.e. the detection of finger print of right index\n\nfinger of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli from Aska 40 bottle recovered\n\nfrom the spot is concerned, the two seizure witnesses i.e., P.W.6\n\n& P.W.24 have not specifically stated regarding the seizure of\n\nAska 40 bottle. Similarly, though the evidence of the I.O.\n\n(P.W.27) is that there was collection of chance finger prints from\n\nAska 40 bottles by the Scientific Officer which were developed\n\nwith white powder and marked as Exts.A, B & B-1, but the\n\nconcerned Scientific Officer was not examined during trial. It is\n\nargued that the finger print expert who prepared the report has\n\nnot been examined but the report has been simply marked as\n\nExt.26 by the I.O. (P.W.27). Even the Aska 40 bottles in which\n\nthree chance finger prints were detected and it was developed,\n\nPage 31 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nwere not produced in Court during trial to be marked as M.O. It\n\nis further argued that as per the finger print examination report\n\nmarked as Ext.26, the chance prints marked as 'A & B-1' said to\n\nhave been detected on different Aska 40 bottles were found to\n\nbe partial, faint, smudged and devoid of required number of\n\nclear ridge details for comparison and opinion and for such\n\nreason, no definite opinion could be furnished in respect of\n\nchance prints marked as 'A & B-1', however only chance print\n\nmarked as 'B' said to have been detected on Aska 40 liquor\n\nbottle tallied with specimen print marked 'X' said to be the right\n\nindex finger print of appellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif Iqbal.\n\nLearned counsel argued that the finding as per Ext.26 was not\n\nput to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli in his accused statement to\n\nafford him an opportunity to explain the same and therefore, it\n\nmust be completely excluded from consideration and cannot be\n\nutilised against him as one of the circumstances.\n\nThe learned counsel further argued that the sixth\n\ncircumstance i.e. the absconding of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\nfrom the village cannot be said to be such a strong circumstance\n\nwhich without the aid of other clinching circumstantial evidence\n\ncan form a chain so complete to arrive at the conclusion that he\n\nis guilty of the offences charged and therefore, it is a fit case\n\nPage 32 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nwhere benefit of doubt should be extended in favour of the\n\nappellants. He further argued relying on the decision of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shankar Kisanrao Khade\n\n-Vrs.- State of Maharashtra reported in (2013) 55 Orissa\n\nCriminal Reports (SC) 623 that in the event the appellants are\n\nfound guilty, in view of their age, family background and the\n\nreports received from different authorities as per the orders of\n\nthis Court, the death sentence should be commuted to life\n\nimprisonment.\n\n8. Mr. Bibhu Prasad Tripathy, learned Additional\n\nGovernment Advocate, on the other hand supported the\n\nimpugned judgment and argued that the evidence of last seen as\n\ndeposed to by P.W.17 is very natural and convincing and even\n\nthough he is a child witness, but the learned trial Court after\n\nputting some questions found that he was able to answer the\n\nquestions rationally and therefore, declared him to be a\n\ncompetent witness. The evidence of P.W.17 having not been\n\nshaken in the cross-examination and being corroborated by the\n\nevidence of P.Ws.2, 3, 7 & 15 before whom he made disclosure\n\nabout the occurrence, the learned trial Court has rightly placed\n\nreliance on such evidence. Reliance was placed on the decisions\n\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Panchhi & others\n\nPage 33 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n-Vrs.- State of U.P. reported in (1998) 7 Supreme Court\n\nCases 177 and State of Madhya Pradesh -Vrs.- Ramesh &\n\nanother reported in (2011) 4 Supreme Court Cases 786.\n\nAccording to Mr. Tripathy, the last seen evidence adduced by\n\nP.W.17 in the factual scenario is very relevant as the place of\n\nlifting of the deceased by the appellants was very close to the\n\nplace from where her body was recovered in a naked condition\n\nhaving injuries and the appellants have failed to explain what\n\nthey did with the deceased after taking her while she was\n\ncoming with P.W.17 and when they parted with the company of\n\nthe deceased. He placed reliance in the case of Ram Gopal\n\n-Vrs.- State of Madhya Pradesh reported in (2023) 5\n\nSupreme Court Cases 534. Reliance was also placed in the\n\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nSomasundaram @ Somu -Vrs.- State reported in (2020) 7\n\nSupreme Court Cases 722.\n\nThe learned counsel for the State further argued that\n\nthe evidence of the witnesses relating to taking of liquor by the\n\nappellants and the other accused persons on the verandah of\n\nManu Mian prior to the occurrence and the trembling, worried\n\nand nervous condition of the appellants near the spot house are\n\nvery clinching and such evidence has not been shattered in the\n\nPage 34 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ncross-examination. He submitted that the detection of finger\n\nprint of Sk. Asif Alli from Aska 40 bottle which was seized from\n\nthe spot has been rightly utilised by the learned trial Court\n\nagainst the said appellant and non-examination of finger print\n\nexpert and non-production of Aska 40 bottles for marking as\n\nM.Os. cannot be a ground to discard such evidence. Reliance was\n\nplaced on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\n\nShri Phool Kumar -Vrs.- Delhi Administration reported in\n\n(1975) 1 Supreme Court Cases 797. It is argued that even if\n\nno direct questions have been put to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\nwith regard to matching of one chance finger print from Aska 40\n\nbottle recovered at spot marked as 'B' with his specimen finger\n\nprint marked as 'X', the same cannot be a ground not to utilise it\n\nas an incriminating circumstance. Reliance was placed on the\n\ndecisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Paramjit\n\nSingh -Vrs.- State of Uttarakhand reported in A.I.R. 2011\n\nS.C. 200 and Nar Singh -Vrs.- State of Haryana reported in\n\n(2015) 1 Supreme Court Cases 496.\n\nIt is argued that the learned trial Court has rightly\n\nheld the chain of circumstances to be complete pointing towards\n\nthe guilt of the appellants and therefore, the criminal appeals\n\npreferred by the appellants being devoid of merits should be\n\nPage 35 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ndismissed. He further argued that in view of the age of the\n\ndeceased, the manner in which she was lifted while coming with\n\nher cousin brother (P.W.17) after purchasing chocolates in the\n\nbroad day light and subsequently found in a naked condition and\n\nwhat had been done with her in a devilish manner as would be\n\nevident from the post mortem report finding, the learned trial\n\nCourt was quite justified in imposing death sentence on the\n\nappellants. He placed reliance in the cases of Ravi -Vrs.- State\n\nof Maharashtra reported in (2019) 9 Supreme Court Cases\n\n622, Manoharan -Vrs.- State reported in (2019) 7\n\nSupreme Court Cases 716, Laxman Naik -Vrs.- State of\n\nOrissa reported in (1994) 3 Supreme Court Cases 381 and\n\nDhananjoy Chatterjee -Vrs.- State reported in (1994) 2\n\nSupreme Court Cases 220.\n\nPrinciple for appreciating the case based on circumstantial\nevidence:\n\n9. There is no dispute that there is no direct evidence\n\nas to who committed the rape and murder of the deceased and\n\nhow. The prosecution case hinges on circumstantial evidence. It\n\nis well established rule of criminal justice that fouler the crime,\n\nthe higher should be the degree of proof. A moral opinion\n\nhowsoever strong or genuine cannot be a substitute for legal\n\nPage 36 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nproof. When a case is based on circumstantial evidence, a very\n\ncareful, cautious and meticulous scrutinisation of the evidence is\n\nnecessary.\n\nIn the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarada -Vrs.-\n\nState of Maharashtra reported in A.I.R. 1984 S.C. 1622, it\n\nis held that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt\n\nis to be drawn against an accused should be fully established.\n\nThe facts so established should be consistent with the hypothesis\n\nof the guilt of the accused and they should not be explainable on\n\nany other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty. The\n\ncircumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency.\n\nThey should exclude a brief possible hypothesis except the one\n\nto be proved. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as\n\nnot to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent\n\nwith the innocence of the accused and must show in all human\n\nprobabilities that the act must have been done by the accused.\n\nThese five golden principles for appreciation of a case based on\n\ncircumstantial evidence have been named as 'Panchsheel'. In the\n\ncase of Gambhir -Vrs.- State of Maharashtra reported in\n\nA.I.R. 1982 S.C. 1157, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n\nthe circumstantial evidence should not only be consistent with\n\nthe guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his\n\nPage 37 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ninnocence. In the case of Jaharlal Das -Vrs.- State of Orissa\n\nreported in (1991) 4 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 278, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court held that it is to be borne in mind as a\n\ncaution that in cases depending largely upon circumstantial\n\nevidence, there is always a danger that the conjecture or\n\nsuspicion may take the place of legal proof and such suspicion\n\nhowsoever strong cannot be allowed to take the place of proof.\n\nThe Court has to be watchful and ensure that conjectures and\n\nsuspicions do not take the place of legal proof. The Court must\n\nsatisfy itself that the various circumstances in the chain of\n\nevidence should be established clearly and that the completed\n\nchain must be such as to rule out a reasonable likelihood of the\n\ninnocence of the child.\n\nIn the light of legal position about the circumstantial\n\nevidence, it is to be examined whether the circumstantial\n\nevidence in the instant case satisfies the requirements of law.\n\nThe first three circumstances relied upon by the trial\n\nCourt is common to both the appellants to be discussed first,\n\nwhich are as follows:-\n\n(i) 'Last seen' theory i.e. the appellants and\nthe deceased were last seen together;\n\nPage 38 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n(ii) Conduct of the appellants i.e. the\nappellants were seen taking liquor in the\nverandah of the house of one Manu Mian and\ngossiping among themselves on 21.08.2014 at\nabout 12.00 p.m. to 12.30 p.m.;\n\n(iii) The appellants were found trembling,\nworried and nervous near the house of Sk.\nKhairuddin;\n\nFirst Circumstance : 'Last seen' theory i.e. the appellants\n\nand the deceased were last seen together:\n\n10. On this circumstance, the relevant witness is P.W.17,\n\nthe cousin brother of the deceased. He was aged about seven\n\nyears when he deposed in Court on 04.02.2016. He stated that\n\nthe informant (P.W.7) was his aunt and the deceased was his\n\nsister and on the date of occurrence, when he along with the\n\ndeceased was returning after purchasing some chocolates, on\n\nthe way appellant Sk. Asif Alli asked the deceased as to whose\n\ndaughter she was, to which the deceased replied that she was\n\nthe daughter of Taz and then Sk. Akil Alli gagged the mouth of\n\nthe deceased and the appellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted the deceased\n\nand took her away. He further stated that the accused Abid (Sk.\n\nAbid Alli) and Karim (Sk. Abdul Karim Alli) were along with the\n\nappellants. He stated to have disclosed the fact to his mother,\n\nPage 39 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ntuition Miss (P.W.26) so also to the informant (P.W.7) and to the\n\npolice.\n\nAdmittedly, the mother of P.W.17 has not been\n\nexamined and the tuition Miss (P.W.26) has not supported the\n\nprosecution case.\n\nThough P.W.17 implicated accused persons Abid and\n\nKarim, but it has been confronted to him and proved through the\n\nI.O. (P.W.27) that he has not stated in his statement recorded\n\nunder\nsection 161\nof Cr.P.C. that the accused persons Abid and\n\nKarim were present when the appellants lifted away the\n\ndeceased. He further stated to have been to the shop to\n\npurchase chocolates with the deceased at about 2.00 p.m. and\n\nthat they were returning home at about 3.00 p.m. He stated not\n\nto have met any known person when they had been to purchase\n\nchocolates and were returning home. Thus the implication of\n\naccused Abid (Sk. Abid Alli) and Karim (Sk. Abdul Karim Alli) was\n\nmade by P.W.17 for the first time in Court, which was more than\n\na year and five months after the occurrence.\n\nP.W.7 has stated that when they enquired from\n\nP.W.17, he disclosed that while he along with the deceased was\n\nreturning from the shop after purchasing chocolates, appellant\n\nSk. Akil Alli called the deceased and gagged her mouth and\n\nPage 40 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted her and took her. Thus P.W.17 has\n\nnot implicated accused Abid and Karim to be in the company of\n\nthe appellants before P.W.7 and that is how in the first\n\ninformation report (Ext.3) lodged by P.W.7, the names of\n\naccused Abid and Karim did not find place. In the F.I.R., P.W.7\n\nhas mentioned that when she asked P.W.17, he disclosed that\n\nwhile returning home, the appellants lifted away the deceased\n\ngagging her mouth.\n\nP.W.2 has also stated that P.W.17 disclosed before\n\nthem that the appellant Sk. Akil Alli gagged the mouth of the\n\ndeceased and appellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted her away and thus,\n\nP.W.17 has not implicated accused persons Abid and Karim\n\nbefore P.W.2.\n\nThus, it is apparent that P.W.17 has neither disclosed\n\nbefore P.W.2 and P.W.7 about any role played by the accused\n\npersons Abid and Karim nor he has stated before the I.O. in his\n\nprevious statement about their presence at the spot when the\n\ndeceased was lifted and taken away by the appellants and for\n\nthe first time, such a statement has been made by him during\n\ntrial.\n\nPage 41 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nWhether P.W.17 was a competent witness to testify?\n\n10.1. P.W.17 is a child witness and aged about seven\n\nyears. Thus, in view of\nsection 118\nof the Evidence Act, it is to\n\nbe seen whether he was a competent witness to testify.\n\nIn the case of P. Ramesh -Vrs.- State reported in\n\n(2019) 20 Supreme Court Cases 593, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt held that the trial Judge was required to determine as to\n\nwhether the child witness was in a fit and competent state of\n\nmind to depose and was able to understand the purpose for\n\nbeing present on the occasion. Prior to the recording of evidence\n\nof a child witness, the trial Court must undertake the exercise of\n\nposing relevant questions to determine the capacity of the child\n\nwitness to provide rational answers. This exercise would allow\n\nthe Court to determine whether the child has the intellectual and\n\ncognitive skills to recollect and narrate the incidents of the crime.\n\nSection 118\nof the Evidence Act, 1872 deals with the\n\ncompetence of a person to testify before the Court.\nSection 4\nof\n\nthe Oaths Act, 1969 requires all witnesses to take oath or\n\naffirmation, with an exception for child witnesses under the age\n\nof twelve years. Therefore, if the Court is satisfied that the child\n\nwitness below the age of twelve years is a competent witness,\n\nsuch a witness can be examined without oath or affirmation. It is\n\nPage 42 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nfurther held that in order to determine the competency of a child\n\nwitness, the Judge has to form her or his opinion. The Judge is at\n\nthe liberty to test the capacity of a child witness and no precise\n\nrule can be laid down regarding the degree of intelligence and\n\nknowledge which will render the child a competent witness. The\n\ncompetency of a child witness can be ascertained by questioning\n\nher/him to find out the capability to understand the occurrence\n\nwitnessed and to speak the truth before the Court. In criminal\n\nproceedings, a person of any age is competent to give evidence\n\nif she/he is able to (i) understand questions put as a witness;\n\nand (ii) give such answers to the questions that can be\n\nunderstood. A child of tender age can be allowed to testify if\n\nshe/he has the intellectual capacity to understand questions and\n\ngive rational answers thereto. A child becomes incompetent only\n\nin case the Court considers that the child was unable to\n\nunderstand the questions and answer them in a coherent and\n\ncomprehensible manner. If the child understands the questions\n\nput to her/him and gives rational answers to those questions, it\n\ncan be taken that she/he is a competent witness to be examined.\n\nBefore recording the evidence of P.W.17, the learned\n\ntrial Judge put some formal questions to him like his name,\n\nfather's name, name of the school, what was the place where he\n\nPage 43 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nhad come and the purpose in coming to the Court. Since P.W.17\n\nanswered all the questions correctly, the learned trial Judge\n\nnoted down that the witness is able to answer the questions\n\nrationally and therefore, he is a competent witness. However,\n\noath was not administered to him as he was seven years of age.\n\nNo challenge has been made by the learned counsel\n\nfor the appellants regarding the competency of P.W.17 to\n\ndepose.\n\nThe admissibility of evidence or acceptability of\n\nevidence of a child witness is not solely dependent on his\n\ncompetency. It is well settled that a child witness is prone to\n\ntutoring and there is every possibility that under influence, such\n\nwitness might have been posed to give out a version by persons\n\nwho may have influence on him. Thus, the testimony of a child\n\nwitness should be evaluated more carefully and only be accepted\n\nafter greatest caution and circumspection.\n\nIn the cross-examination, suggestion has been given\n\nto P.W.17 that he was deposing falsehood being tutored by\n\nP.W.7 and P.W.15 to which he denied. In the case of Ramesh\n\n(supra), it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that deposition\n\nof a child witness may require corroboration but in case his\n\ndeposition inspires the confidence of the Court and there is no\n\nPage 44 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nembellishment or improvement therein, the Court may rely upon\n\nhis evidence. The evidence of a child witness must be evaluated\n\nmore carefully with greater circumspection because he is\n\nsusceptible to tutoring. Only in case there is evidence on record\n\nto show that the child has been tutored, the Court can reject his\n\nstatement partly or fully. However, an inference as to whether\n\nchild has been tutored or not, can be drawn from the contents of\n\nhis deposition. In the case of Panchhi (supra), the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court held that it is not the law that if a witness is a\n\nchild, his evidence shall be rejected, even if it is found reliable.\n\nThe law is that evidence of a child witness must be evaluated\n\nmore carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is\n\nsusceptible to be swayed by what others telling and thus a child\n\nwitness is an easy to prey to tutoring. Courts have laid down\n\nthat evidence of a child witness must find adequate\n\ncorroboration before it is relied on. It is more of a rule of\n\npractical wisdom than law.\n\nThe main plank of argument by the learned counsel\n\nfor the appellants is that there is every possibility of tutoring to\n\nhim and that is the reason why he implicated two accused\n\npersons for the first time in Court i.e. accused Abid and Karim\n\neven though he has not implicated them before police so also\n\nPage 45 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nwhile making disclosure about the occurrence before P.W.2 and\n\nthe informant (P.W.7). The question that now crops up for\n\nconsideration as to whether the evidence of P.W.17 is to be\n\ntotally rejected as he has implicated two accused persons i.e.\n\nAbid and Karim for the first time during trial. The maxim falsus in\n\nuno falsus in omnibus i.e. false in one thing false in all is not a\n\nsound rule to apply in the condition in our country. It means that\n\nif any witness makes a statement which may be incorrect to\n\nsome extent, it does not inevitably follow that the other portion\n\nof his statement, which is correct, has also to be disbelieved. It\n\nis very difficult to find a witness whose evidence does not contain\n\na grain of untruth or at any rate exaggeration, embroideries or\n\nembellishments. The Courts should make efforts to disengage\n\nthe truth from falsehood, and to shift the grain from the chaff\n\nand where the truth and falsehood are so intermingled so as to\n\nmake it impossible to separate them, the evidence has to be\n\nrejected in entirety. It is a misconception that a witness has to\n\nbe believed in toto or disbelieved in toto. The Court must\n\nappraise the evidence to see as to what extent it is worthy of\n\nacceptance and merely because in one respect, the Court\n\nconsiders it insufficient to rely the testimony of a witness, it does\n\nnot necessarily follow as a matter of fact that it must be\n\nPage 46 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ndiscarded in all respect as well. Therefore, implication of two\n\naccused persons namely, Abid and Karim for the first time in\n\nCourt during trial by P.W.17 itself cannot be a ground to\n\ndisbelieve his evidence rather his evidence is required to be\n\ncarefully assessed and to see if there is any corroboration to his\n\nevidence or not. The possibility of coming to his knowledge\n\nregarding the involvement of accused persons namely, Abid and\n\nKarim afterwards from other sources cannot be ruled out and\n\ntherefore, he might have been tempted to speak against them in\n\nthe witness-box. Bereft of implication of two accused Abid and\n\nKarim, nothing has been brought out in the cross-examination to\n\ndiscard his evidence, rather his evidence is very natural, clear,\n\ncogent and trustworthy. P.W.7 has stated that the deceased had\n\ngone to the shop to purchase chocolate along with P.W.17.\n\nP.W.19 has stated that on the date of occurrence at about 2 p.m.\n\nto 2.30 p.m. the deceased and P.W.17 had come to his\n\nstationery shop for chocolate and took chocolate and went away.\n\nThe evidence of these two witnesses i.e. P.W.7 and P.W.19 lend\n\ncorroboration to the evidence of P.W.17 that the latter was with\n\nthe deceased at the time of occurrence. Thus the presence of\n\nP.W.17 with the deceased, his conduct in disclosing before others\n\nPage 47 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nwhat happened with the deceased is relevant and admissible as\n\nres gestae under\nsection 6\nof Evidence Act.\n\nIn the case of Anjan Kumar Sarma and others\n\n-Vrs.- State of Assam reported in (2017) 14 Supreme\n\nCourt Cases 359, it is held that the circumstance of last seen\n\ntogether cannot by itself form the basis of holding the accused\n\nguilty of the offence. In a case where other links have been\n\nsatisfactorily made out and the circumstance pointed to the guilt\n\nof the accused, the circumstance of last seen together and\n\nabsence of explanation would provide an additional link which\n\ncompletes the chain and in the absence of proof of other\n\ncircumstances, the only circumstance of last seen together and\n\nabsence of satisfactory explanation cannot be made the basis of\n\nconviction.\n\nIn the case of Ram Gopal (supra), it is held that\n\nonce the theory of 'last seen together' was established by the\n\nprosecution, the accused was expected to offer some explanation\n\nas to when and under what circumstances he had parted the\n\ncompany of the deceased. It is true that the burden to prove the\n\nguilt of the accused is always on the prosecution, however, in\n\nview of\nsection 106\nof the Evidence Act, when any fact is within\n\nthe knowledge of any person, the burden on of proving that fact\n\nPage 48 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nis upon whom. Of course,\nsection 106\nof the Evidence Act is\n\ncertainly not intended to relieve the prosecution of its duty to\n\nprove the guilt of the accused, nonetheless, it is also equally\n\nsettled legal position that if the accused does not throw any light\n\nupon the facts which are proved to be within the special\n\nknowledge, in view of\nsection 106\nof the Evidence Act, such\n\nfailure on the part of the accused may be used against the\n\naccused as it may provide an additional link in the chain of\n\ncircumstances required to be proved against him. In the case\n\nbased on circumstantial evidence, furnishing or non-furnishing of\n\nthe explanation by the accused would be a crucial fact, when the\n\ntheory of last seen together as propounded by the prosecution\n\nwas proved against him. Though the last seen theory as\n\npropounded by the prosecution in a case based on circumstantial\n\nevidence may be a weak kind of evidence by itself to base\n\nconviction solely on such theory, when the said theory is proved\n\ncoupled with other circumstances such as the time when the\n\ndeceased was last seen with the accused and the recovery of the\n\ncorpse being in very close proximity of time, the accused does\n\nowe an explanation under\nsection 106\nof the Evidence Act with\n\nregard with the circumstances under which death might have\n\ntaken place. If the accused offers no explanation or furnishes a\n\nPage 49 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nwrong explanation, absconds, motive is established and some\n\nother corroborative evidence in the form of recovery of weapon\n\netc. forming a chain of circumstance is established, the\n\nconviction could be based on such evidence.\n\nIn the case of Somasundaram @ Somu (supra),\n\nwhere specific charges under\nsections 347\n/\n/\nof the I.P.C.\n\nwere framed, it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the\n\nabduction followed by murder in appropriate cases can enable a\n\nCourt to presume that the abductor is the murderer. The\n\nprinciple is that after abduction, the abductor would be in a\n\nposition to explain what happened to his victim and if he failed to\n\ndo so, it is only natural and logical that an irresistible inference\n\nmay be drawn that he has done away with the hapless victim.\n\nSection 106\nof the Evidence Act would come to the assistance of\n\nthe prosecution.\n\nIn the case in hand, however, there is neither any\n\ncharge of abduction nor any charge of illegal confinement. In the\n\naccused statement, the learned trial Court has put specific\n\nquestions to the appellants on the evidence of P.W.17 but except\n\nstating that the same was false, nothing further has been stated\n\nby the appellants.\n\nPage 50 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nTherefore, I am of the humble view that the learned\n\ntrial Court has rightly placed reliance on the evidence of P.W.17\n\nand held that the last seen theory has been established by the\n\nprosecution. The evidence of P.W.17 that the appellants and the\n\ndeceased were last seen together when both of them lifted away\n\nthe deceased while she was returning with him after purchasing\n\nchocolates from the village shop can be used as one of the\n\nincriminating circumstance against the appellants as has been\n\nrightly done by the learned trial Court, but in my humble view,\n\nsuch circumstance of last seen in itself cannot be held sufficient\n\nto record the finding of guilt of the appellants.\n\nThus the first circumstance i.e. last seen theory even\n\nthough proved by the prosecution has to be taken into account\n\nalong with the other circumstances to see whether the chain of\n\nevidence has been established clearly and that it forms a\n\ncompleted chain.\n\nSecond Circumstance: Conduct of the appellants in taking\n\nliquor in the verandah of the house of one Manu Mian:\n\n11. The second circumstance relied upon by the\n\nprosecution is that on 21.08.2014 at about 12.00 p.m. to 12.30\n\np.m., the appellants were seen taking liquor in the verandah of\n\nPage 51 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nthe house of one Manu Mian and gossiping among them which is\n\nbeing deposed to by P.W.6 and P.W.23.\n\nP.W.6 has stated that on the occurrence day, while\n\nhe was coming to his village Krushnanandapur, he saw the\n\nappellants and the accused persons namely, Sk. Abid and Sk.\n\nKarim were taking liquor at about 12.30 noon on the varandah of\n\nthe house of Manu Mian and they were talking with each other.\n\nIn the cross-examination, he has stated that the accused\n\npersons used to take liquor in the varandah of Manu Mian\n\nregularly. P.W.23 has also stated to have seen the appellants\n\nand the accused persons namely, Sk. Abid Alli and Sk. Karim Alli\n\ntaking liquor in the varandah of Manu Mian and gossiping among\n\nthem on the date of occurrence at about 12 noon.\n\nThe time when the appellants and the two other\n\naccused persons were seen taking liquor was much before the\n\ntime when P.W.17 with the deceased came to purchase\n\nchocolates and after purchasing were returning home. P.W.17\n\nhas stated that he had been to the shop with the deceased to\n\npurchase chocolate at about 2 p.m. and was returning at about 3\n\np.m. Similarly P.W.19 has stated that on the date of occurrence\n\nat about 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m., the deceased and P.W.17 had\n\ncome to his stationery shop for purchasing chocolate. As\n\nPage 52 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ndeposed to by P.W.6, the appellants and the accused persons\n\nnamely, Sk. Abid and Sk. Karim used to take liquor in the\n\nvarandah of Manu Mian regularly. Learned trial Court has held\n\nthat from this circumstance, it cannot be safely concluded that\n\nall the accused persons were the authors of the crime. It was\n\nfurther held that the possibility of accused Sk. Abid Alli leaving\n\nthe company of the appellants after taking liquor from the\n\nvarandah of the house of Manu Mian cannot be ruled out.\n\nThus, the second circumstance i.e. the appellants\n\nwere seen taking liquor in the verandah of the house of one\n\nManu Mian and gossiping among themselves and the other two\n\naccused persons were also with them, as proved by the\n\nprosecution is not by itself sufficient to connect the appellants\n\nwith the crime. It is to be considered along with the other proved\n\ncircumstances to see whether the chain of evidence is so\n\ncomplete as to unerringly point towards the guilt of the\n\nappellants.\n\nThird Circumstance : Appellants were found trembling,\n\nworried and nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin:\n\n12. The third circumstance i.e the appellants were found\n\ntrembling, worried and nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin\n\nis concerned, P.W.5 is the sole witness on this circumstance.\n\nPage 53 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nP.W.5 has stated that on the date of occurrence at\n\nabout 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. while he was returning from Masjid\n\nafter Namaz, he found the appellants near the house of Sk.\n\nKhairuddin and they were found trembling, looking worried and\n\nnervous and then he went to his house.\n\nThe learned trial Court held that since the appellants\n\nwere planning to lift the victim on the way of her return, they\n\nmight be worried and nervous. It is nothing but a hypothetical\n\nconclusion. There is nothing on record that the deceased and\n\nP.W.17 had passed by that way by that time to purchase\n\nchocolates from the stationery shop of P.W.19 and that the\n\nappellants had seen them. According to P.W.17, he had been to\n\nthe shop with the deceased to purchase chocolate at about 2\n\np.m. and was returning at about 3 p.m.\n\nThe conclusion arrived at should be sensible and\n\nreasonable. It must be based on reasons rather than\n\nimaginations and emotions. P.W.5 stated that he was a close\n\nrelative of the deceased and the deceased belonged to her\n\nfamily. It is true that related witness is not necessarily a false\n\nwitness, but when P.W.5 was just passing by that way near the\n\nhouse of Sk. Khairuddin after Namaj in Masjid and there is no\n\nevidence how much time he observed both the appellants and\n\nPage 54 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nfound them trembling, looking worried and nervous, even if the\n\nevidence of P.W.5 is accepted, it cannot be said with certainty\n\nthat it was before the lifting of the deceased as held by the\n\nlearned trial Court. Trembling, looking worried and nervousness\n\ncan be for a variety of reasons and it cannot be said with\n\ncertainty that it was only for the reasons assigned by the trial\n\nCourt. The body of the deceased was located on the Taza of the\n\nhouse of Sk. Khairuddin at about 5.30 p.m. as stated by the\n\ninformant (P.W.7) and the appellants were found near the house\n\nof Sk. Khairuddin at about 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. as stated by\n\nP.W.5.\n\nThus, the third circumstance as proved by the\n\nprosecution, i.e the appellants were found trembling, worried\n\nand nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin, in my humble\n\nview is not so clinching by itself to arrive at the conclusion as\n\nreached by the trial Court or sufficient to connect the appellants\n\nwith the crime and it is to be considered along with the other\n\nproved circumstances.\n\nSummed up : Circumstances against the appellant Sk. Akil\n\nAlli:-\n\n13. The three circumstances which are appearing against\n\nappellant Sk. Akil Alli as discussed above, I am of the humble\n\nPage 55 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nview that though through the evidence of P.W.17, the\n\nprosecution has successfully proved that on the date of\n\noccurrence in the afternoon, both the appellants lifted away the\n\ndeceased while she was returning after purchasing chocolates\n\nand thus the appellants and the deceased were last seen\n\ntogether, but such circumstance of last seen coupled with the\n\ncircumstance that the appellant Sk. Akil Alli was seen taking\n\nliquor in the verandah of the house of Manu Mian with appellant\n\nSk. Asif Alli and the other two accused i.e. Sk. Abid Alli and Sk.\n\nAbdul Karim Alli so also the circumstance that he along with the\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli was found trembling, worried and nervous\n\nnear the house of Sk. Khairuddin in the afternoon on the date of\n\noccurrence do not form a complete chain to record the finding\n\nthat it is consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the\n\nappellant Sk. Akil Alli and totally inconsistent with his innocence\n\nand prove the charges against him beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\nThe circumstances proved raised an amount of suspicion, but\n\nsuspicion, howsoever strong, cannot be a substitute for proof of\n\nthe guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThere is no evidence against appellant Sk. Akil Alli\n\nthat he tried to flee or abscond from his village. He was\n\napprehended by local people and handed over to the I.O.\n\nPage 56 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n(P.W.27) on the night of occurrence. The appellant was\n\nexamined by the doctor (P.W.28) at C.H.C., Manijanga on police\n\nrequisition and he was found capable of committing sexual\n\nintercourse and his pubic hair and sample semen were collected\n\nby the doctor and kept in sealed vials and handed over to the\n\nescorting constable, which in turn were seized by the I.O.\n\n(P.W.27), who also seized the wearing apparels of the appellant\n\ni.e. blue colour check lungi and one half vest on being produced\n\nby him as per seizure list Ext.6. The forwarding report for\n\nchemical examination, which was marked as Ext.24, would\n\nindicate that the check lungi of the appellant Sk. Akil Alli was\n\nmarked as Ext.'P', his half vest was marked as Ext.'P-1', pubic\n\nhair of the appellant was marked as Ext.'Q' and sample semen of\n\nthe appellant collected in a sealed bottle was marked as Ext.'Q-\n\n1'. The nature of examination sought for so far as these four\n\nexhibits, which relate to the appellant Sk. Akil Alli were (i)\n\nwhether Exts.'P' & 'P-1' contained any blood stain and if so,\n\nwhether it tallied with Exts.'B', 'E' & 'L' i.e. the wearing apparels\n\nof the deceased; (ii) whether Exts.'P' and 'P-1' contained any\n\nvaginal swab and if so, whether it tallied with Ext.'M-1' (vaginal\n\nswab); (iii) whether any blood stain/seminal stain detected in\n\nExt.'A' i.e. the kantha seized from the spot and did it tally with\n\nPage 57 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nExt.'Q-1', (iv) whether the stains detected in Exts.'B' & 'L' i.e.\n\nthe wearing apparels of the deceased tallied with Ext.'Q-1' and\n\n(v) whether Ext.'Q' tallied with any hair detected from Ext.'A'.\n\nThe chemical examination report (Ext.25) indicates that in\n\nExts.'P' & 'P-1', no blood, no semen and no vaginal secretion\n\nstain were noticed and similarly in Ext.'Q', no blood and no\n\nsemen were noticed. So far as Ext.'Q-1' is concerned, it was\n\nfound to be deteriorated due to preservation in liquid state.\n\nAdmittedly, no finger print of the appellant Sk. Akil Alli was\n\nfound to be tallying with the chance finger prints detected on\n\nAska 40 liquor bottles found at the spot.\n\nTherefore, from the three proved circumstances, it is\n\ndifficult to sustain the conviction of the appellant Sk. Akil Alli\n\nunder\nsections 302\n/\n376-A\n/\n376-D\nof the I.P.C. and\nsection 6\nof\n\nthe POCSO Act and accordingly, the same is hereby set aside\n\nand the appellant is acquitted of all the charges.\n\n14. Before proceeding further to discuss about the\n\nremaining three circumstances, which are against Sk. Asif Alli @\n\nMd. Asif Iqbal, it would be apt to discuss whether prosecution\n\nhas proved that the deceased was subjected to rape and she met\n\nwith a homicidal death.\n\nPage 58 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nWhether the deceased was subjected to rape and she met\n\nwith a homicidal death:\n\n14.1. The deceased was first detected on the Taza of the\n\nhouse of Sk. Khairuddin by P.W.3 who found her in a naked\n\ncondition. P.W.2 stated to have noticed nail marks on the belly\n\nand backside and knee of the victim and he also found blood\n\npatches on the thigh. P.W.15 has stated that the victim was\n\nrecovered in a senseless and naked condition and she had\n\nsustained bleeding injuries on her person including her genital.\n\nP.W.7 has stated that she found the victim naked and senseless\n\nwhen she was rescued from Taza of the house of Sk. Khairuddin.\n\nShe also found injuries on the chest, shoulder, below the ear,\n\nback and knee of the deceased and she had sustained bleeding\n\ninjuries on her private part and there was dried blood in her\n\nprivate part and that they covered the body of the deceased with\n\nbed sheet and shifted her to Tendakunda Hospital. P.W.21 Dr.\n\nAmrit Kumar Behera who was the Medical Officer in New\n\nTendakuda C.H.C. examined the deceased and he stated that\n\nwhen some persons brought the deceased to him on 21.08.2014\n\nat about 6.30 p.m., he found the deceased was in a senseless\n\ncondition having some nail marks on her neck and some marks\n\non the back. He also found redness with blood stain in her\n\nPage 59 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nprivate part (in pubic area) for which he referred her to\n\nS.C.B.M.C.H., Cuttack for further treatment. He proved the OPD\n\nticket vide Ext.18, which was seized by the I.O. as per seizure\n\nlist Ext.17. While the deceased was being shifted to the hospital\n\nat Cuttack, on the way near Kandarpur, she died for which P.W.7\n\nand others who were carrying her returned back to the village.\n\nThe inquest report marked as Ext.1 also indicates that the\n\ndeceased had sustained injuries on different parts of her body\n\nincluding bleeding injuries on her vagina.\n\nP.W.25 Dr. Saumya Ranjan Naik, Assistant Professor,\n\nF.M.T., S.C.B.M.C.H., Cuttack conducted post mortem\n\nexamination over the dead body of the deceased on 22.08.2014\n\nand noticed the following injuries :-\n\nExternal injuries:\n\n(i) Genital area found swollen and edematous\nand fluid blood found coming out from the\nvaginal opening. Labia Majora and labia minora\nfound contused, posterior commissure found\ncontused and lacerated. Vaginal opening found\nstretched and the margins were seen contused\nand lacerated. There was wide gaping of vaginal\ncutlet and vaginal canal. Hymen found\ncompletely lacerated, mostly on the posterior\naspect;\n\nPage 60 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n(ii) Abrasion looking red (3 cm x 1 cm)\npresent on right breast;\n\n(iii) Abrasion looking red (4 cm x 0.5 cm)\npresent on right side front of abdomen vertically\n1 cm lateral to umbilicus;\n\n(iv) Scratch abrasion (2 cm x 0.1 cm) present\non right side zygomatic area;\n\n(v) Abrasion (0.7 cm x 0.2 cm) present on\nmiddle of left pinna;\n\n(vi) Abrasion (1 cm x 1 cm) on front of left\nknee;\n\n(vii) Abrasion (2 cm x 2 cm) on lateral aspect\nof left knee;\n\n(viii) Multiple scratch abrasions of length\nvarying from 1 cm to 5 cm present on left side\nback of chest 6 cm below scapula;\n(ix) Multiple small abraded contusions over an\narea of abdomen at the level of LI (6 cm x 4 cm)\npresent on mid line;\n\n(x) Multiple small abrasions (3 cm x 1 cm)\npresent on sacral area;\n\n(xi) Multiple small abrasions present on left\nscapula shoulder;\n\nPage 61 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n(xii) Multiple small abrasions present on right\nscapula;\n\n(xiii) Multiple small abrasions present on front\nand right side of neck.\n\nOn dissection:\n\nLeft side lateral wall of vaginal canal found\ntorn and lacerated and the margins were found\ncontused. About 200 fluid blood found within\npelvic cavity. Structures of the neck were found\nintact without any extravasations of blood.\nStomach contained 300 grams partially digested\nfood particles without emitting any characteristic\nodour, mucosa is healthy. All other organs were\nintact and pale.\n\nThe doctor (P.W.25) has stated in his evidence that\n\nexternal injuries nos.(ii) to (xiii) found on the dead body were\n\nante mortem in nature and might have been caused by hard and\n\nblunt trauma or contact with hard and rough surface. He has\n\nfurther opined that external injury no.(i) along with\n\ncorresponding internal injuries were ante mortem in nature and\n\nconsistent with forceful thrusting and could have been caused\n\ndue to penetration of male organ. As per his opinion, death of\n\nthe deceased was due to shock and hemorrhage as a result of\n\ninjuries to genital track which were fatal in ordinary course of\n\nPage 62 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nnature. According to him, age of injuries were of fresh duration\n\nat the time of death, time since death was within 12 to 24 hours\n\nprior to autopsy and the death was within 12 to 24 hours prior to\n\nautopsy and the death was homicidal in nature. During cross-\n\nexamination, P.W.25 has clearly denied the suggestion put to\n\nhim by the learned defence counsel by saying that the injuries\n\non the vagina were not possible by fall on hard surface or by\n\ninserting a wooden substance in the vagina.\n\nIn view of the oral as well as medical evidence, I am\n\nof the humble view that the deceased was subjected to rape and\n\non account of rape, external injuries were caused on different\n\nparts of her body including injuries to genital track which were\n\nfatal in ordinary course of nature and it also caused shock and\n\nhemorrhage which resulted in her death and her death was\n\nhomicidal in nature. The learned counsel for the appellants has\n\nnot challenged this aspect though it is his contention that there\n\nis insufficient evidence on record to hold the appellants liable for\n\nsuch offences.\n\nRemaining three circumstances:\n\n15. The remaining three circumstances which are against\n\nthe appellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif Iqbal are to be discussed\n\nnow.\n\nPage 63 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nFourth Circumstance : Appellant Sk. Asif Alli was found\n\nleaving village Manu Mahala on the date of occurrence:\n\n16. The fourth circumstance i.e. the appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\nwas found leaving village Manu Mahala in a Hero Honda Activa\n\nscooty on the date of occurrence i.e. on 21.08.2014 at about 6\n\np.m. with the accused Sk. Abid Alli and Sk. Abdul Karim Alli, has\n\nbeen deposed to by P.W.1 Sk. Wamik Alli who is the sole witness\n\non this circumstance. He has stated that on the date of\n\noccurrence in the afternoon, while he along with others were in\n\nthe field of Akhandalmani, they found the appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\nalong with accused Sk. Abid Alli (acquitted) and Sk. Karim Alli\n\n(absconding) were going towards village Kolta in a red colour\n\nActiva. In the cross-examination, P.W.1 has stated that he went\n\nto Akhandalmani field at about 4 p.m. and returned to his house\n\nat about 5.20 p.m. He further stated that by the time of his\n\narrival at Akhandalmani field, around forty to fifty persons were\n\nthere. He further stated that he was examined by the police in\n\nfront of the house of the deceased on the night of occurrence.\n\nIt is the contention of the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants that even though there are many others present at\n\nAkhandalmani field, only P.W.1 was examined to prove this\n\ncircumstance. Learned counsel for the State submitted that in\n\nPage 64 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nthe matter of appreciation of evidence of witnesses, it is not the\n\nnumber of witnesses but quality of evidence that is important.\n\nAdverting to the contentions raised, law is well\n\nsettled that\nsection 134\nof the Evidence Act does not provide for\n\nany particular number of witnesses and it would be permissible\n\nfor the Court to record a finding regarding any particular aspect\n\nof the prosecution case on the evidence of a solitary witness if\n\nhis evidence is found to be credible, reliable, in tune with the\n\ncase of the prosecution and inspires implicit confidence. It is not\n\nthe quantity but quality of evidence adduced by the witness that\n\nmatters for determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.\n\nThe testimony of a sole witness must be confidence-inspiring and\n\nbeyond suspicion, thus, leaving no doubt in the mind of the\n\nCourt.\n\nThe evidence of P.W.1 who is related to the father of\n\nthe deceased as brother cannot be doubted on the ground of\n\nrelationship as related witnesses are not necessarily false\n\nwitnesses. Unless their evidence suffers from serious infirmity or\n\nraises considerable doubt in the mind of the Court, it would not\n\nbe proper to discard their evidence straight away. Evidence of\n\nP.W.1 has not been shattered or discredited by the defence in\n\nspite of searching cross-examination. He disclosed before police\n\nPage 65 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nwhat he had seen when he was examined on the night of\n\noccurrence The leaving of village Manu Mahala by the appellant\n\nSk. Asif Alli along with the other two might not have been\n\nnoticed by others present in Akhandalmani field as they just\n\npassed through that way. P.W.4 was present in Akhandalmani\n\nfield and he was playing football when he came to know about\n\nthe missing of the deceased but he has not stated about this\n\ncircumstance. Non-examination of other witnesses to prove the\n\nsame circumstance is immaterial.\n\nAfter carefully assessing the evidence of P.W.1, I find\n\nhim to be a reliable witness and through his evidence, the\n\nprosecution has successfully proved the fourth circumstance.\n\nFifth Circumstance : Detection of finger print of appellant\n\nSk. Asif Alli by State Finger Print Bureau from the Aska 40\n\nbottle found at the spot:\n\n17. The fifth circumstance relied upon by the prosecution\n\nis that the right index finger print of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\nwas detected by the State Finger Print Bureau from the Aska 40\n\nbottle recovered from the spot.\n\nP.W.27, the I.O. has stated that the scientific team\n\nof S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh and staff of D.F.S.L., Jagatsinghpur\n\narrived at the spot on 22.08.2014 at 1.30 pm. and inspected the\n\nPage 66 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nspot and as per seizure list Ext.2, three nos. of Aska 40 bottles\n\nalong with other articles were seized in presence of witnesses at\n\n3.30 p.m. The seizure list Ext.2 though does not specifically\n\nindicate seizure of Aska 40 bottles, but it indicates about seizure\n\nof three nos. of glass bottles marked as Exts. 'J', 'J/1' and 'J/2'.\n\nThe I.O. (P.W.27) has further stated that during inspection of\n\nspot by the Scientific Officer Chunuram Murmu, State F.S.L.,\n\nRasulgarh, Bhubaneswar, three chance finger prints were\n\ndetected from the bottles (Aska 40 bottles) by the Finger Print\n\nSub-Inspector, Jagatsinghpur and the chance finger prints were\n\ndeveloped with white powder and marked as Exts.'A', 'B' & 'B-1'.\n\nExt.2 also indicates in column no.2 regarding production of\n\ndifferent articles by Scientific Officer Chunuram Murmu, State\n\nS.F.S.L., Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar before the I.O. and the I.O.\n\nhas also stated that on 22.08.2014 at about 3.30 p.m. he seized\n\nthe articles after those were handed over to him by the S.F.S.L.\n\nOfficer.\n\nP.Ws.6 & 24 are the witnesses to the seizure list\n\nExt.2. P.W.6 while proving his signature in seizure list Ext.2, has\n\nstated about seizure of different articles as per the said seizure\n\nlist. P.W.24 has also stated about the seizure of articles by the\n\nI.O. as per seizure list Ext.2 and he has also proved his signature\n\nPage 67 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nthereon. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that\n\nneither P.W.6 nor P.W.24 has specifically stated about the\n\nseizure of three nos. of Aska 40 bottles under seizure list Ext.2.\n\nSuch a contention cannot be attached with any importance since\n\ntheir evidence as seizure witnesses has not been shattered or\n\ndiscredited by the defence rather it is getting corroboration from\n\nthe evidence of the I.O.\n\nIt is argued by the learned counsel for the appellants\n\nthat during trial, the prosecution has not examined the Scientific\n\nOfficer Chunuram Murmu or any other officer who assisted him\n\nduring the spot inspection and detected and developed three\n\nchance finger prints from the Aska 40 bottles. The liquor bottles\n\nwere not produced in Court during trial and the photo images of\n\nchance prints marked as A, B and B-1 in a CD along with their\n\nphoto enlargements on the basis of which Finger Print\n\nExamination Report (Ext.26) was prepared were also not\n\nproduced during trial and therefore, no importance is to be\n\nattached to the findings recorded by the Director, State Finger\n\nPrint Bureau, Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar in Ext.26. Learned\n\ncounsel for the State on the other hand argued that since spot\n\ninspection by the scientific officials is not in dispute which is\n\nPage 68 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\notherwise proved by oral as well as documentary evidence, non-\n\nexamination of such officials is immaterial.\n\nThe evidence of the I.O. (P.W.27) indicates that on\n\n05.09.2014, after he apprehended the appellant Sk. Asif Alli at\n\nBhubaneswar along with accused Sk. Abid Ali (acquitted), they\n\nwere sent to Medical Officer, C.H.C., Manijanga for necessary\n\nmedical examination and opinion. The escort party produced the\n\nmedical examination reports, biological exhibits collected from\n\nthe appellants in sealed vials which were seized and then the\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli and accused Sk. Abid Ali were arrested on\n\n06.09.2014 and forwarded to Court on that very day, which\n\nwould be evident from the order sheet dated 06.09.2014. The\n\nevidence of the I.O. and the case records further indicate that\n\nthe specimen finger prints of Sk. Asif Alli and other accused\n\npersons were collected and the I.O. made requisition to S.P.,\n\nJagatsingpur through FPSI, DFSL, Jagatsinghpur to send the\n\nchance finger prints collected from Aska 40 bottles which were\n\ntransferred to a CD along with specimen ten digit finger print\n\nslips of the suspects including the appellant Sk. Asif Alli to the\n\nDirector, State Finger Print Bureau, Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar for\n\nnecessary examination and opinion and accordingly, the same\n\nwere dispatched through FPSI, Jagatsinghpur and the report\n\nPage 69 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n(Ext.26) goes against the appellant Sk. Asif Alli. Non-\n\nexamination of Scientific Officer who detected and developed\n\nchance finger prints and non-production of Aska 40 bottles in\n\nCourt during trial cannot be a ground to discard the evidenciary\n\nvalue of Ext.26. No suggestion has been given by the defence to\n\nthe I.O. that there was no seizure of Aska 40 bottles from the\n\nspot. Photo images of chance prints along with their photo\n\nenlargements including CD and specimen finger prints are very\n\nmuch available on record and those are part and parcel of\n\nExt.26, which indicates that the chance print marked as Ext.'B'\n\nsaid to have been detected on Aska 40 liquor bottle tallied with\n\nspecimen print marked Ext.'X' said to be the right index finger\n\nprint of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli.\n\nIn the case of Phool Kumar (supra) on which\n\nreliance was placed by the learned counsel for the State, it is\n\nheld that the clinching evidence against the appellant was his\n\nthumb impression on the kunda of the cash box. It was\n\nconclusively proved to be his on the opinion of the expert. The\n\nreport of the expert was used as evidence by the prosecution\n\nwithout examining him in Court. Neither the Court thought it fit\n\nnor the prosecution or the accused filed any application to\n\nsummon and examine the expert as to the subject matter of his\n\nPage 70 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nreport. The Court was bound to summon the expert if the\n\naccused would have filed any such application for his\n\nexamination. That not having been done, the grievance of the\n\nappellant apropos the report of the expert being used without his\n\nexamination in Court had no substance.\n\nThe examination of expert is crucial especially if\n\nreliance is placed on the finger print report to suspect the guilt of\n\nthe accused. The I.O. has stated that the Scientific Officer, DFSL\n\nfinger print and team collected the finger prints of three accused\n\npersons from the Sub-Jail, Jagatsinghpur after obtaining the\n\norder of the Court. Specific questions have been put to the\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli in the accused statement relating to\n\ndetection of Aska 40 liquor bottles during spot visit, visit of\n\nscientific team of SFSL, Rasulgarh and staff of DFSL,\n\nJagatsinghpur to the spot and seizure of three numbers of Aska\n\n40 bottles as per seizure list, but the appellant simply answered\n\nthat he could not say. Ext.26 has been marked on admission. No\n\napplication was filed from the side of accused persons to\n\nsummon the Scientific Officer or expert for his examination.\n\nTherefore, non-examination of the Scientific Officer or the expert\n\nwho prepared the report cannot be a ground not to give\n\nimportance to Ext.26. It is correct that inadvertently no direct\n\nPage 71 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nquestion has been put to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli on the finding\n\nof Ext.26 in the accused statement, but it has been held by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Paramjeet Singh (supra)\n\nthat the provisions of\nsection 313\nof Cr.P.C. make it obligatory\n\nfor the Court to question the accused on the evidence and\n\ncircumstances against him so as to offer him an opportunity to\n\nexplain the same, but, it would not be enough for the accused to\n\nshow that he has not been questioned or examined on a\n\nparticular circumstance, instead he must show that such non-\n\nexamination has actually and materially prejudiced him and has\n\nresulted in the failure of justice. In other words, in the event of\n\nan inadvertent omission on the part of the Court to question the\n\naccused on any incriminating circumstance cannot ipso facto\n\nvitiate the trial unless it is shown that some material prejudice\n\nwas caused to the accused by the omission of the Court.\n\nIn the case of Nar Singh (supra), contention was\n\nraised from the side of the appellant that since Ballistic Expert\n\nopinion was not put to the appellant in his statement recorded\n\nunder\nsection 313\nof Cr.P.C., it must be completely excluded\n\nfrom consideration. The Hon'ble Court held that when the trial\n\nCourt is required to act in accordance with the mandatory\n\nprovisions of\nsection 313\nof Cr.P.C., failure on the part of the\n\nPage 72 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ntrial Court to comply with the mandate of the law, cannot\n\nautomatically enure to the benefit of the accused. Any omission\n\non the part of the Court to question the accused on any\n\nincriminating circumstance would not ipso facto vitiate the trial,\n\nunless some material prejudice is shown to have been caused to\n\nthe accused. It was further held that in so far as non-compliance\n\nof mandatory provisions of\nsection 313\nof Cr.P.C., it is an error\n\nessentially committed by the learned Sessions Judge. Since\n\njustice suffers in the hands of the Court, the same has to be\n\ncorrected or rectified in the appeal. The question whether a trial\n\nis vitiated or not depends upon the degree of the error and the\n\naccused must show that non-compliance of\nsection 313\nof\n\nCr.P.C. has materially prejudiced him or is likely to cause\n\nprejudice to him. Merely because of defective questioning under\n\nsection 313\nof Cr.P.C., it cannot be inferred that any prejudice\n\nhad been caused to the accused, even assuming that some\n\nincriminating circumstances in the prosecution case had been left\n\nout. When prejudice to the accused is alleged, it has to be shown\n\nthat accused has suffered some disability or detriment in relation\n\nto the safeguard given to him under\nsection 313\nof Cr.P.C. Such\n\nprejudice should also demonstrate that it has occasioned failure\n\nof justice to the accused. The burden is upon the accused to\n\nPage 73 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nprove that prejudice has been caused to him or in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, such prejudice may be implicit and\n\nthe Court may draw an inference of such prejudice. Facts of each\n\ncase have to be examined to determine whether actually any\n\nprejudice has been caused to the appellant due to omission of\n\nsome incriminating circumstances being put to the accused.\n\nWhenever a plea of non-compliance of\nsection 313\nof Cr.P.C. is\n\nraised, it is within the powers of the appellate Court to examine\n\nand further examine the convict or the counsel appearing for the\n\naccused and the said answers shall be taken into consideration\n\nfor deciding the matter. If the accused is unable to offer the\n\nappellate Court any reasonable explanation of such\n\ncircumstance, the Court may assume that the accused has no\n\nacceptable explanation to offer. In the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case, if the appellate Court comes to the conclusion that no\n\nprejudice was caused or no failure of justice was occasioned, the\n\nappellate Court will hear and decide the matter upon merits.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that live link was provided to\n\nthe jail where the appellants were lodged and they were\n\nprovided opportunity to see the entire hearing proceeding. One\n\nlearned State Counsel from the District Court also remained\n\npresent with them throughout the proceeding as per our\n\nPage 74 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ndirection to explain them the argument advanced and\n\ninteractions between the Bench and the learned counsel for the\n\nrespective parties. During course of hearing, when we expressed\n\nour willingness to provide an opportunity to the appellant Sk.\n\nAsif Alli to explain the finding of Ext.26 against him by way of\n\nrecording additional accused statement under\nsection 313\nof\n\nCr.P.C., if he so desires, the learned counsel for the appellants\n\nafter taking instruction was reluctant to avail such opportunity.\n\nIn the case in hand, the defence has not disputed the\n\nvisit of scientific team to the spot, the seizure of Aska 40 liquor\n\nbottles from the spot on being produced by the Scientific Officer,\n\nthe detection and development of chance finger prints from such\n\nbottles, the collection of specimen ten digit finger prints of the\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli from jail and its dispatch to State Finger\n\nPrint Bureau, Bhubaneswar for examination. In fact, the same\n\nhas been proved through oral as well as documentary evidence.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellant has failed to show as to\n\nwhat material prejudice was caused to the appellant by the\n\nomission of the Court to put direct question on Ext.26.\n\nIn view of the foregoing discussions, when chance\n\nfinger prints were detected and developed from the three Aska\n\n40 liquor bottles found at the spot and one chance print marked\n\nPage 75 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\n'B' tallied with specimen right index finger print of the appellant\n\nSk. Asif Alli and there is no suspicious feature in it, the\n\nprosecution can be said to have proved the fifth circumstance\n\nagainst the appellant Sk. Asif Alli beyond all reasonable doubt. It\n\ncannot be lost sight of the fact the Aska 40 liquor bottles were\n\nfound at the spot which was inside the bunker of the house of\n\nSk. Khairuddin where the wearing apparels of the deceased\n\nwhich were identified by the informant (P.W.7) so also the dead\n\nbody of the deceased was found in a naked condition on the Taza\n\nof the underground room which is a very clinching evidence\n\nagainst the appellant Sk. Asif Alli.\n\nSixth Circumstance : Conduct of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\nin absconding from the village after occurrence:\n\n18. The occurrence in question took place on 21.08.2014\n\nin the afternoon and as already discussed under the heading of\n\nfourth circumstance that the appellant Sk. Asif Alli was found\n\nleaving the village Manu Mohalla in a Hero Honda Activa Scooty\n\nwith two co-accused persons on the same day at about 6.00\n\np.m. The Investigating Officer (P.W.27) has stated that on\n\n22.08.2014, only appellant Sk. Akil Alli was apprehended by the\n\nlocal people and was arrested by him in the occurrence night,\n\nbut when he searched for the other accused persons inside the\n\nPage 76 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nvillage, they were found absent. The I.O. has further stated that\n\nas per the direction of the S.P., Jagatsinghpur, a special team\n\nwas formed to apprehend the accused persons and raid was\n\nconducted at different places. On 05.09.2014 at about 3.00\n\np.m., the appellant Sk. Asif Alli so also the co-accused Sk. Abid\n\nAlli (acquitted) were apprehended at Bhubaneswar by the I.O.\n\nand they were brought to Tirtol police station. Specific question\n\nhas been put to the appellant regarding his apprehension at\n\nBhubaneswar in the accused statement but he simply answered\n\nhe did not know.\n\nThe evidence has come on record through the I.O.\n\nthat the appellant Sk. Asif Alli was an accused in a case of\n\nmurder in connection with Tirtol P.S. Case No.197 of 2011.\n\nAnother case under\nsection 307\nof the I.P.C. was instituted\n\nagainst him in connection with Tirtol P.S. Case No.89 of 2014 in\n\nwhich he was forwarded to Court and released on bail on\n\n20.08.2014 i.e. the previous day of the occurrence.\n\nThe conduct of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli in\n\nabsconding away from his village on the date of occurrence till\n\nhe was apprehended by the I.O. was a circumstance duly proved\n\nby the prosecution against him. No explanation has been\n\nrendered by the appellant in regard to his absence from his\n\nPage 77 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nvillage and he was not available to the police in spite of their\n\nbest efforts to trace him. Thus, the sixth circumstance relating to\n\nthe conduct of the appellant in absconding from his village has\n\nbeen duly proved by the prosecution and this absconding of the\n\nappellant along with other incriminating circumstances as proved\n\nby the prosecution goes a great way to point his culpability.\n\nSummed up : Circumstances against appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\n@ Md. Asif Iqbal:\n\n19. All the sixth circumstances which are appearing\n\nagainst the appellant Sk. Asif Alli as discussed above, are of a\n\nconclusive nature and have been fully established by the\n\nprosecution. The facts established are consistent with the\n\nhypothesis of guilt of the appellant and it is not explainable\n\nunder any of the hypothesis except that the appellant is guilty.\n\nThe chain of evidence is so complete that it does not leave any\n\nreasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with innocence\n\nof the appellant rather when the circumstances are collectively\n\nconsidered, the same lead only to the irresistible conclusion that\n\nthe appellant is the perpetrator of the crime in question.\n\nPage 78 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nCharges proved against appellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif\n\nIqbal:\n\n20. In my humble view, the prosecution has established\n\nthe charge under\nsection 302\nof the I.P.C. against the appellant\n\nSk. Asif Alli particularly in view of the oral evidence adduced by\n\nthe witnesses relating to the manner in which the body of the\n\ndeceased was found in the Taza of the house of Sk. Khairuddin,\n\nthe inquest report so also the post mortem report findings.\n\nThe prosecution has also proved through the\n\nevidence of the doctor (P.W.25) who conducted post mortem\n\nexamination and the oral evidence of the witnesses regarding the\n\nmanner in which the body of the deceased was found in a naked\n\ncondition with multiple injuries on different parts of the body\n\nincluding genital area that the appellant has not only committed\n\nan offence of rape on the deceased but in course of such\n\ncommission, he inflicted the injuries which resulted in the death\n\nof the deceased and therefore, the learned trial Court has rightly\n\nfound the appellant guilty under\nsection 376-A\nof the I.P.C.\n\nSo far as the charge under\nsection 376-D\nof the\n\nI.P.C. which relates to commission of gang rape is concerned,\n\nsince one of the accused, who faced trial, namely, Sk. Abid Alli\n\nhas been acquitted by the learned trial Court and appellant Sk.\n\nPage 79 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nAkil Alli has been acquitted by virtue of this judgment, it would\n\nnot be proper to convict the appellant under\nsection 376-D\nof the\n\nI.P.C.\n\nComing to the charge under\nsection 6\nof the POCSO\n\nAct which deals with punishment for aggravated penetrative\n\nsexual assault defined under\nsection 5\nof the said Act, the\n\ningredients of the offence can be satisfied if someone, inter alia,\n\ncommits penetrative sexual assault on a child below twelve\n\nyears. 'Penetrative sexual assault' has been defined under\n\nsection 3\nof the said Act and in view of the evidence of the\n\ndoctor (P.W.25), I am of the view that the necessary ingredients\n\nare satisfied. So far as the age of the deceased is concerned, the\n\nevidence of P.W.14, the Principal of Kalinga Public School,\n\nKrishnanandapur where the deceased was prosecuting her\n\nstudies as a student of L.K.G. indicates that her date of birth was\n\n16.03.2008 as per the school admission register which was\n\nseized by the police during investigation and left in the zima of\n\nP.W.14. The original birth certificate of the deceased was seized\n\nby the I.O. as per seizure list Ext.10 on 09.09.2014 on being\n\nproduced by the uncle of the deceased and it also reflects the\n\ndate of birth of the deceased to be 16.03.2008. Since the\n\noccurrence in question took place on 21.08.2014, the\n\nPage 80 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nprosecution has proved that the deceased was a child below\n\ntwelve years. The learned counsel for the appellant has not\n\nchallenged the evidence relating to the age of the deceased.\n\nTherefore, the prosecution has successfully established the\n\ncharge under\nsection 6\nof the POCSO Act against the appellant\n\nSk. Asif Alli.\n\n21. In view of the foregoing discussion, I am of the view\n\nthat the prosecution has failed to establish the charge under\n\nsection 376-D\nof the I.P.C. against the appellant Sk. Asif Alli and\n\naccordingly, he is acquitted of such charge, however he is found\n\nguilty under\nsections 302\n/\n376-A\nof the I.P.C. and\nsection 6\nof the\n\nPOCSO Act.\n\nSentence:\n\n22. The learned trial Court has awarded life\n\nimprisonment for the offence under\nsection 376-A\nof the I.P.C.,\n\nwhich shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural\n\nlife. This section gives a discretion to the Court to impose\n\npunishment with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall\n\nnot be less than twenty years, but which may extend to\n\nimprisonment for life, which shall mean for imprisonment for the\n\nremainder of that person's natural life, and with fine or with\n\ndeath. In view of the age of the deceased at the time of\n\nPage 81 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\noccurrence and the manner in which rape has been committed\n\nwhich ultimately caused the death of the deceased, I am of the\n\nview that the sentence awarded by the learned trial Court for\n\nsuch offence is perfectly justified and no interference is called for\n\nwith the same.\n\nThe learned trial Court has rightly not imposed any\n\nsentence for the conviction of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli for the\n\ncharge under\nsection 6\nof the POCSO Act in view of\nsection 42\nof\n\nthe said Act.\n\n23. So far as the the offence under\nsection 302\nof the\n\nI.P.C. is concerned, the learned trial Court has awarded death\n\nsentence to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli and ordered that he be\n\nhanged by neck till he is dead.\n\nThe only question that now remains to be decided is\n\nwhether this case falls in the category of rarest of rare case,\n\njustifying capital punishment. The learned Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in several judgments has awarded capital punishment,\n\nwhere rape and murder have been committed on a minor girl,\n\nafter striking a balance between the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances. Several other factors like the young age of the\n\naccused, the possibility of reformation, lack of intention to\n\nPage 82 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nmurder consequent to rape etc. have also gone into judicial\n\nmind.\n\nIt seems that on the date of pronouncement of order\n\nof conviction i.e. on 29.11.2022, hearing on the question of\n\nsentence was made and death sentence was awarded. The\n\nlearned trial Court after noting down the principles rendered by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in different cases relating to\n\nawarding of death sentence, has been pleased to hold that the\n\ndeceased was a minor victim aged about six years and the\n\noffences are serious and heinous in nature and against the\n\nnorms of a healthy society. The act reveals a dirty and perverted\n\nmind of human being who has no control over his carnal desires.\n\nThe number of injuries found on the deceased show that she was\n\nmercilessly ravished and killed to satisfy the carnal desires. The\n\nlearned trial Court also took into account the criminal\n\nbackground of the appellant as he was involved previously not\n\nonly in a case under\nsection 302\nof the I.P.C. but also in another\n\ncase under\nsection 307\nof the I.P.C. and was released on bail on\n\n20.08.2014 and committed the offence in the present case on\n\nthe very next day. The learned trial Court held that there was no\n\nchance of reformation of the appellant in the near future.

The\n\nlearned trial Court further held that imposition of capital\n\npunishment on the appellant would be an example for other\n\nwrongdoers of similar nature in the society, which is necessitated\n\nin order to protect and safeguard the female children's interest in\n\nthe country and accordingly, imposed death sentence on the\n\nappellant.\n\nDuring course of argument, on 30.04.2024 learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants argued that passing of death sentence\n\non the date of conviction by the learned trial Court was not\n\njustified. The learned counsel for the State brought to the notice\n\nof the Court the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered\n\nin the case of Sundar @ Sundarrajan -Vrs.- State by\n\nInspector of Police reported in 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 217.\n\nAfter going through the ratio laid down in the said decision, we\n\ndeemed it proper to call for a report to the Superintendent of\n\nCircle Jail, Choudwar, Cuttack regarding (i) conduct of the\n\nappellants in jail; (ii) information on appellants' involvement in\n\nany other case; (iii) details of the appellants acquiring education\n\nPage 84 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nin jail and (iv) details of appellants' medical records. On\n\n02.05.2024, after considering the submission of the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants so also the learned counsel for the\n\nState, this Court took suo motu cognizance of the fact regarding\n\nthe procedure followed by the trial Court at the time of hearing\n\non sentence. Taking into account various decisions of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court on the point, we were of the view that there was\n\nno proper and meaningful hearing on the question of sentence\n\nwhich was necessary in order to do complete justice. We also\n\nheld that no opportunity was afforded to the appellants to submit\n\nany material in support of mitigating circumstances during\n\ncourse of hearing on the question of sentence. After observing\n\nthat hearing on the question of sentence has to be real and\n\neffective and not a mere formality and that if a meaningful\n\nhearing was not taken up by a Court while considering the\n\nsentence imposed and inflicted upon the convict, it would cause\n\nserious prejudice to him, we afforded an opportunity to the\n\nappellants inviting from them such data to be furnished in the\n\nshape of affidavits and also directed the Jail Authority to do the\n\nneedful in that regard. We directed the Senior Superintendent,\n\nCircle Jail, Cuttack at Choudwar to collect all the information on\n\nthe past life of the convicts, psychological conditions and their\n\nPage 85 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nconduct post- conviction obtaining reports accordingly by taking\n\nservice and necessary assistance from the Probation Officer and\n\nsuch other officers including a Psychologist or Jail Doctor or any\n\nMedical Officer attending the prison.\n\nIn pursuance of such order, the mother of the\n\nappellant filed an affidavit dated 09.05.2024 indicating therein\n\nthat at the time of occurrence, his son was working in an auto\n\ngarage as a colour mistri and the entire family depended on the\n\nincome of the appellant, who was a young boy aged about\n\ntwenty five years at the time of occurrence and though he has\n\ngot previous criminal antecedents but he has no previous\n\nconviction. It is further stated in the affidavit that during\n\nincarceration, her son had reformed and he should be\n\nrehabilitated to the extent that he could live in the society.\n\nAs per the order dated 02.05.2024, the learned\n\nAdditional Government Advocate also produced the social reports\n\nof both the appellants submitted by the Regional Probation\n\nOfficer, Cuttack, Psychological condition reports of both the\n\nappellants submitted by Psychiatrist, Circle Jail, Cuttack at\n\nChoudwar and present conduct and behaviour inside the Circle\n\nJail, Cuttack at Choudwar from Senior Superintendent, Circle\n\nJail, Cuttack at Choudwar. The Regional Probation Officer in his\n\nPage 86 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nreport dated 08.05.2024 has stated that he met the mother of\n\nthe appellant Sk. Asif Alli, who was aged about sixty three years\n\nand ascertained from her that the appellant was the eldest son of\n\nthe family and was working as a labourer in a private shop\n\n(radium work), Mumbai for his livelihood to maintain the family.\n\nThe family of the appellant has got no landed property and the\n\nmother of the appellant was suffering from eye sight problem\n\nand psychological imbalance after the death of her husband. The\n\ntwo sisters of the appellant are unmarried and stated that their\n\nmarriage proposal could not be settled due to non-acceptance of\n\ntheir family in the society. It is observed that the family have no\n\nmeans to face the situation in the village and the family is\n\nstruggling for the livelihood as there is no earning member in the\n\nfamily and they are remaining in fear psychosis and the mother\n\nof the appellant is behaving irrationally with unsettled mind. So\n\nfar as education background of the appellant is concerned, he\n\npassed matriculation in third division in the year 2010 and the\n\nschool leaving certificate reflects good in character/conduct\n\nduring his school days and he had no adverse report as per the\n\nschool report. The appellant was a good cricket and football\n\nplayer and after matriculation, he discontinued his higher studies\n\ndue to financial problems as reported by his family members. So\n\nPage 87 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nfar as social life and past life of the appellant is concerned, it\n\nappears that prior to the offence in question, the appellant was\n\ninvolved in seven cases, out of which in three cases, he has been\n\nacquitted. The villagers and village committee members\n\nexpressed their displeasure against the appellant for his criminal\n\nact and they were very disgusted, aggravated and grudged\n\ntowards the appellant and therefore, the life of the appellant is in\n\ndanger in his village. The villagers are not providing any support\n\nto the family of the appellant for which the family members are\n\nsuffering a lot. The Senior Superintendent, Circle Jail, Cuttack at\n\nChoudwar has submitted a report wherein it is mentioned that\n\nthe conduct and behaviour of the appellant inside prison at\n\npresent is normal, his behaviour and attitude towards other co-\n\nprisoners as well as the staff is cordial. He is maintaining every\n\ndiscipline of jail administration and there is no adverse report\n\nagainst him during his entire period of confinement in prison. No\n\nprison offence was committed by the appellant inside the jail\n\nduring the period of his imprisonment. The Psychiatrist, Circle\n\nJail, Cuttack at Choudwar has given a report relating to the\n\npsychological condition of the appellant wherein it is mentioned\n\nthat the appellant is doing his daily routine activities properly,\n\noffering prayer to God many times in a day and coping with the\n\nPage 88 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nco-inmates well and regarding the sentence, the appellant is\n\nready to accept his punishment as he has surrendered before the\n\nGod. On mental status examination, mild degree of anxiety was\n\nnoticed and no other mental abnormality was detected and on\n\nsurrendering before the God, the appellant was able to keep the\n\nmental state in balance. The Senior Superintendent, Circle Jail,\n\nCuttack at Choudwar has also reported that the conduct of the\n\nappellant inside the jail is normal and he has not acquired any\n\nfurther education in jail after his admission to jail.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellants placed reliance\n\nin the case of Shankar Kisanrao Khade (supra), wherein\n\nHon'ble Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan (as His Lordship then was)\n\nheld as follows:\n\n\"28......In my considered view that the tests that\nwe have to apply, while awarding death\nsentence, are \"crime test\", \"criminal test\" and\nthe R-R Test and not \"balancing test\". To award\ndeath sentence, the \"crime test\" has to be fully\nsatisfied, that is 100% and \"criminal test\" 0%,\nthat is no mitigating circumstance favouring the\naccused. If there is any circumstance favouring\nthe accused, like lack of intention to commit the\ncrime, possibility of reformation, young age of\nthe accused, not a menace to the society no\nprevious track record etc., the \"criminal test\"\n\nPage 89 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nmay favour the accused to avoid the capital\npunishment. Even, if both the tests are satisfied\nthat is the aggravating circumstances to the\nfullest extent and no mitigating circumstances\nfavouring the accused, still we have to apply\nfinally the Rarest of Rare Case test (R-R lest). R-\nR Test depends upon the perception of the\nsociety that is \"society centric\" and not \"Judge\ncentric\" that is, whether the society will approve\nthe awarding of death sentence to certain types\nof crimes or not. While applying that test, the\nCourt has to look into variety of factors like\nsociety's abhorrence, extreme indignation and\nantipathy to certain types of crimes like sexual\nassault and murder of minor girls intellectually\nchallenged, suffering from physical disability, old\nand infirm women with those disabilities etc.\nExamples are only illustrative and not\nexhaustive. Courts award death sentence since\nsituation demands so, due to constitutional\ncompulsion, reflected by the will of the people\nand not the will of the Judges.\nxx xx xx xx xx\n\n38. Therefore, the mere pendency of few\ncriminal cases as such is not an aggravating\ncircumstance to be taken note of while awarding\ndeath sentence unless the accused is found\nguilty and convicted in those cases. High Court\nwas, therefore, in error in holding that those are\n\nPage 90 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nrelevant factors to be considered in awarding\nappropriate sentence.\"\n\nIn the said case, even though the victim was a minor\n\ngirl aged about 11 years, intellectually challenged and the\n\naccused repeatedly raped the girl for few days, ultimately\n\nstrangulated her to death and the Hon'ble Justice K.S.\n\nRadhakrishnan held that both 'crime test' and 'criminal test' are\n\nindependently satisfied against the accused, but considering the\n\nentire facts and circumstances of the case, the death sentence\n\nawarded to the accused was converted to rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor life. Hon'ble Justice Madan B. Lokur (as His Lordship then\n\nwas) also agreed with such view.\n\nNow the decisions cited by the learned counsel for\n\nthe State on death penalty are to be discussed. In the case of\n\nRavi (supra), Hon'ble Justice Surya Kant speaking for himself\n\nand for Justice R.F. Nariman (as His Lordship then was) held as\n\nfollows:-\n\n\"62. In the light of above discussion, we are of\nthe considered opinion that sentencing in this\ncase has to be judged keeping in view the\nparameters originating from Bachan Singh and\nMachhi Singh cases and which have since been\nstrengthened, explained, distinguished or\nfollowed in a catena of subsequent decisions,\n\nPage 91 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nsome of which have been cited above. Having\nsaid that, it may be seen that the victim was\nbarely a two-year old baby whom the appellant\nkidnapped and apparently kept on assaulting\nover 4-5 hours till she breathed her last. The\nappellant who had no control over his carnal\ndesires surpassed all natural, social and legal\nlimits just to satiate his sexual hunger. He\nruthlessly finished a life which was yet to bloom.\nThe appellant instead of showing fatherly love,\naffection and protection to the child against the\nevils of the society, rather made her the victim\nof lust. It is a case where trust has been\nbetrayed and social values are impaired. The\nunnatural sex with a two-year old toddler\nexhibits a dirty and perverted mind, showcasing\na horrifying tale of brutality. The appellant\nmeticulously executed his nefarious design by\nlocking one door of his house from the outside\nand bolting the other one from the inside so as\nto deceive people into believing that nobody was\ninside. The appellant was thus in his full senses\nwhile he indulged in this senseless act. The\nappellant has not shown any remorse or\nrepentance for the gory crime, rather he opted\nto remain silent in his 313\nCr.P.C\n. statement. His\ndeliberate, well-designed silence with a standard\ndefence of 'false' accusation reveals his lack of\nkindness or compassion and leads to believe\n\nPage 92 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nthat he can never be reformed. That being so,\nthis Court cannot write of the capital punishment\nso long as it is inscribed in the statute book.\"\n\nHon'ble Justice R. Subhash Reddy (as His Lordship\n\nthen was) dissented on the question of sentence and held as\n\nfollows:-\n\n\"76. In this case, learned counsel for the\nappellant has contended that the trial Court as\nwell as the High Court, fell in error in confining\nnature and brutality of crime alone, to award the\nsentence of death. It is submitted that nature of\ncrime alone is not sufficient to impose the\nsentence of death, unless State proves by\nleading cogent evidence that the convict is\nbeyond reform and rehabilitation. It is submitted\nthat the socio-economic conditions of the convict\nand the circumstances under which crime is\ncommitted are equally relevant for the purpose\nof considering whether a death penalty is to be\nimposed or not. It is submitted that as the case\non hand, rests on circumstantial evidence, same\nis also the ground not to impose capital\npunishment, of death.\nxx xx xx xx xx\n\n98. I am clear in my mind that in this case on\nhand, the mitigating circumstances of the\nappellant, dominate over the aggravating\n\nPage 93 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ncircumstances, to modify the death sentence to\nthat of life imprisonment. Even as per the case\nof prosecution, the appellant was under\ninfluence of liquor at the time of committing the\noffence, and there is no evidence on record from\nthe side of prosecution, to show that there is no\npossibility of reformation and rehabilitation of\nthe Appellant. Further, age of the appellant was\n25 years at the relevant time and conviction is\nsolely based on circumstantial evidence. Taking\nall such aspects into consideration, the death\npenalty imposed on the appellant is to be\nmodified to that of life imprisonment, for the\noffence under\nsection 302\nIndian Penal Code.\"\nIn the case of Manoharan (supra), Hon'ble Justice\n\nR.F. Nariman (as His Lordship then was) speaking for himself\n\nand for Justice Surya Kant held as follows:-\n\n\"34. In the circumstances, we have no doubt\nthat the trial Court and High Court have\ncorrectly applied and balanced aggravating\ncircumstances with mitigating circumstances to\nfind that the crime committed was cold-blooded\nand involves the rape of a minor girl and murder\nof two children in the most heinous fashion\npossible. No remorse has been shown by the\nappellant at all and given the nature of the crime\nas stated in paragraph 84 of the High Court's\njudgment it is unlikely that the appellant, if set\n\nPage 94 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nfree, would not be capable of committing such a\ncrime yet again. The fact that the appellant\nmade a confessional statement would not, on\nthe facts of this case, mean that he showed\nremorse for committing such a heinous crime.\nHe did not stand by this confessional statement,\nbut falsely retracted only those parts of the\nstatement which implicated him of both the rape\nof the young girl and the murder of both her and\nher little brother. Consequently, we confirm the\ndeath sentence and dismiss the appeals.\"\n\nHon'ble Justice Sanjiv Khanna dissented on the\n\nquestion of sentence and held as follows:-\n\n\"44. The expression 'rarest of rare' literally\nmeans rarest even in the rare, i.e. a rarest case\nof an extreme nature. The expression and the\nchoice of words, means that punishment by\ndeath is an extremely narrow and confined rare\nexception. The normal, if not an unexceptional\nrule, is punishment for life, which rule can be\ntrimmed and upended only when the award of\nsentence for life is unquestionably foreclosed.\nThus, capital punishment is awarded and\ninvoked only if the facts and material produced\nby the prosecution disdainfully and fully\nestablish that the option of imprisonment for life\nwill not suffice and is wholly disproportionate\n\nPage 95 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nand therefore the case belongs to the 'rarest of\nrare' category.\nxx xx xx xx xx\n55. When we come to the facts of the present\ncase, one has to but agree that the offence or\nthe crime was brutal, ruthless and cruel as two\ninnocent children aged 7 to 10 lost their lives,\nand there is substantial medical and other\nevidence to show that the young girl was\nmercilessly sexually abused and raped by the\nAppellant and Mohanakrishnan (since deceased).\nThereafter the children were administered\npoison and thrown into a canal to die. The pain\nand trauma suffered by the small children who\nwere not at fault and the agony of the parents\nand grandmother are immense, incalculable and\nwould remain forever. The punishment must be\nsevere. Yet to award death penalty we must\nexamine and answer the second question, i.e.\nbalance out the aggravating circumstances by\ngiving weightage to the mitigating circumstances\nand decide whether punishment of life\nimprisonment is foreclosed. Then and then alone\nthe case would fall under the 'rarest of rare'\ncategory. While doing so, we should account for\nthe majority dictum in V. Sriharan (supra) that\nwhere life imprisonment is considered to be\ndisproportionate or inadequate, then the Court\nmay direct sentence for life imprisonment,\n\nPage 96 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nwithout any right to remission i.e. imprisonment\nfor the entire course of life with no recourse to\nremission, subject to the power that may be\nexercised under\nArticles 72\nand\nof the\nConstitution.\nxx xx xx xx xx\n73. The appellant's partial retraction has been\nrightly disbelieved for good reasons, including\nthe statement of the appellant under\nSection\nCr.P.C. in the Court accepting and admitting\nthat his confession was recorded by the\nMagistrate. The retraction by itself, I would\nobserve, should not be treated as absence of\nremorse or repentance, albeit an afterthought or\non advice propelled by fear that the appellant in\nview of his admission may face the gallows, and\nthat the earlier confession made seeking\nforgiveness would be the cause of his death. A\nthought of doubt and attempt to retract had\nsurfaced on account of belief that the sense of\nremorse, repentance and forgiveness would not\nbe appreciated and given due regard, cannot be\nruled out. Benefit in this regard must go to the\nAppellant.\n\n74. The other mitigating factors in favour of the\nappellant are his young age, he was 23 years of\nage at the time of occurrence and he belongs to\na poor family. He has aged parents and is a\nfirst-time offender as recorded in the\n\nPage 97 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\njudgment/order of the trial court. Further, the\nappellant Manoharan was not initially involved in\nthe abduction and kidnapping of the children. He\nwas not the mastermind. Mohanakrishnan (since\ndeceased) had thought, conceived and had\nsingle-handedly executed the plan to abduct the\nchildren. The appellant did join him thereafter\nand was with Mohanakrishnan (since deceased).\nSubsequently the devil in Mohanakrishnan (since\ndeceased) took over and he sexually assaulted\nand raped the small girl, while the appellant\nkept quiet. Later the appellant too sexually\nassaulted and committed rape. Thereupon,\npoison was administered to the children before\nthrowing them into the canal. The offence\ncommitted was heinous and deplorable.\n\n75.......In view of the aforesaid discussion and on\nbalancing aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances, in my opinion, the present case\ndoes not fall under the category of 'rarest of\nrare' case i.e. there is no alternative but to\nimpose death sentence. It would fall within the\nspecial category of cases, where the appellant\nshould be directed to suffer sentence for life i.e.\ntill his natural death, without\nremission/commutation under\nsections 432\nand\nCode of Criminal Procedure. To this extent, I\nwould allow the appeal.\"\n\nPage 98 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nIn the case of Laxman Naik (supra), the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court held that the extreme penalty can be inflicted\n\nonly in gravest cases of the extreme culpability and in making\n\nchoice of the sentence, in addition to the circumstances of the\n\noffender also. Having regard to these principles with regard to\n\nthe imposition of the extreme penalty, it may be noticed that\n\nthere are absolutely no mitigating circumstances in the case. The\n\nappellant seems to have acted in a beastly manner as after\n\nsatisfying his lust, he thought that the victim might expose him\n\nfor the commission of the offence of forcible rape on her to the\n\nfamily members and other, the appellant with a view to screen\n\nthe evidence of his crime also put an end to the life of innocent\n\ngirl who had seen only seven summers. The evidence on record\n\nis indicative of the fact as to how diabolically the appellant had\n\nconceived of his plan and brutally executed it and such a\n\ncalculated, cold blooded and brutal murder of a girl of a very\n\ntender age after committing rape on her would undoubtedly fall\n\nin the category of rarest of the rare case attracting no\n\npunishment other than the capital punishment.\n\nIn the case of Dhananjoy Chatterjee (supra), the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court held that the object of sentencing should\n\nbe to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the victim\n\nPage 99 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nof crime as also the society has the satisfaction that justice has\n\nbeen done to it. In imposing sentences, in the absence of specific\n\nlegislation, Judges must consider variety of factors and after\n\nconsidering all those factors and taking an overall view of the\n\nsituation, impose sentence which they consider to be an\n\nappropriate one. Aggravating factors cannot be ignored and\n\nsimilarly mitigating circumstances have also to be taken into\n\nconsideration. It is further held that the measure of punishment\n\nin a given case must depend upon the atrocity of the crime; the\n\nconduct of the criminal and the defenceless and unprotected\n\nstate of the victim. Imposition of appropriate punishment is the\n\nmanner in which the courts respond to the society's cry for\n\njustice against the criminals. Justice demands that courts should\n\nimpose punishment fitting to the crime so that the courts reflect\n\npublic abhorrence of the crime. The courts must not only keep in\n\nview the rights of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of\n\ncrime and the society at large while considering imposition of\n\nappropriate punishment.\n\nIn the case of Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan\n\nBariyar -Vrs.- State of Maharashtra reported in (2009) 6\n\nSupreme Court Cases 498, it is held that life imprisonment\n\nPage 100 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\ncan be said to be completely futile, only when the sentencing\n\naim of reformation can be said to be unachievable.\n\nKeeping in view the ratio laid down in the decisions\n\ndiscussed above, it is borne out of record that the offence was\n\ncommitted against a girl child aged about six years in a most\n\nhorrendous, devilish and barbaric manner, but the case is based\n\non circumstantial evidence and there is no material on record\n\nthat the crime was committed in a pre-planned manner. It\n\nseems that both the appellants noticed the deceased in the\n\ncompany of his cousin brother (P.W.17) while they were\n\nreturning after purchasing chocolates and then the deceased was\n\nlifted away and she was subjected to rape during course of which\n\nshe sustained injuries on different parts of her body and her\n\ndeath was due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of injuries\n\nto genital track which were fatal in ordinary course of nature. No\n\nharm has been caused to P.W.17 while lifting away the deceased\n\neven though the appellants must have been aware that P.W.17 is\n\nlikely to disclose about their misdeeds before the family\n\nmembers and others. The post mortem report (Ext.19) does not\n\nindicate any specific method was applied by the culprit for\n\ncommitting the death of the deceased. Though the appellant has\n\ngot criminal antecedents but he has not been found guilty in\n\nPage 101 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nthose cases rather he has been acquitted in three cases as would\n\nbe evident from the social report submitted by Regional\n\nProbation Officer, Cuttack. Therefore, the mere pendency of\n\ncriminal cases cannot be considered as relevant factors for\n\nawarding death sentence in view of the ratio laid down by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shankar Kisanrao Khade\n\n(supra). The date of birth of the appellant as per the report\n\nsubmitted by Regional Probation Officer, Cuttack is 13.03.1989\n\nand therefore, he was aged about 26 years as on the date of\n\noccurrence. He is a family man and having old mother aged\n\nabout 63 years and two unmarried sisters and he was the sole\n\nbread earner of his family and working as a colour mistri in\n\nMumbai and the financial condition of the family is not good. His\n\ncharacter and conduct was good in school and he has passed\n\nmatriculation in the year 2010. He could not continue his higher\n\nstudies due to financial problems in the family. He was a good\n\ncricket and football player during his teen age. Even though he is\n\nin judicial custody for about ten years, but the reports submitted\n\nby Jail Superintendent and the Psychiatrist indicate that his\n\nconduct and behaviour inside prison is normal, his behaviour\n\ntowards co-prisoners as well as staff is cordial and he is\n\nmaintaining every discipline of the jail administration. Neither\n\nPage 102 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nthere is any adverse report against him during the entire period\n\nof confinement nor he has committed any prison offence. He is\n\noffering prayer to God many times in a day and he is ready to\n\naccept the punishment as he has surrendered before God.\n\nThe punishment should not be disproportionately\n\ngreat is a corollary of just deserts and it is dictated by the same\n\nprinciple that does not allow punishment of the innocent, for any\n\npunishment in excess of what is deserved for the criminal\n\nconduct is punishment without guilt. There is no cogent evidence\n\nthat the appellant is beyond reform and rehabilitation.\n\nConsidering the entire facts and circumstances, the aggravating\n\ncircumstances and mitigating circumstances, it cannot be said\n\nthat capital punishment is the only option for the appellant and\n\nthat the option of imprisonment for life will not suffice and is\n\nwholly disproportionate.\n\nIn view of the foregoing discussions, I am inclined to\n\ncommute the death sentence awarded to the appellant for the\n\noffence under\nsection 302\nof the I.P.C. to life imprisonment,\n\nwhich shall mean the remainder of his natural death, without\n\nremission/commutation under\nsections 432\nand\nCode of\n\nCriminal Procedure.\n\nPage 103 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nVictim Compensation:\n\n24. The learned trial Court has awarded compensation of\n\nRs.1,50,000/- (rupees one lakh fifty thousand) to be paid to the\n\nparents of the deceased. The State Government of Odisha in\n\nexercise of powers conferred by the provisions of\nsection 357-A\n\nof Cr.P.C. has formulated the Odisha Victim Compensation\n\nScheme, 2017. Schedule-II of the scheme deals with\n\ncompensation scheme for woman victims or survivors of sexual\n\nassault or other crimes. In case of death (loss of life), the\n\nminimum limit of compensation is Rs. 5 Lakh and the upper limit\n\nof compensation is Rs.10 Lakh. In the factual scenario and\n\nparticularly taking into account the age of the deceased, the\n\nmaximum compensation amount i.e. Rs. 10,000,00/- (rupees ten\n\nlakh) as provided under Schedule-II is awarded which is to be\n\npaid to the father and mother of the deceased. If any\n\ncompensation amount has already been disbursed to the parents\n\nof the deceased as per the order of the learned trial Court, the\n\nsame shall be adjusted and District Legal Services Authority,\n\nJagatsinghpur shall take immediate steps to pay the balance\n\namount of compensation within four weeks from today.\n\nPage 104 of 106\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nSigned by: SIPUN BEHERA\nDesignation: Senior Stenographer\nReason: Authentication\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA, CUTTACK\nDate: 20-Jun-2024 11:05:59\n\nConclusion:\n\n25. In view of the discussions, CRLA No.121 of 2023 filed\n\nby the appellant Sk. Akil Alli is allowed. The conviction of the\n\nappellant Sk. Akil Alli under\nsections 302\n/\n376-A\n/\n376-D\nof the\n\nI.P.C. and\nsection 6\nof the POCSO Act is hereby set aside and the\n\nappellant is acquitted of all the charges. He shall be set at liberty\n\nforthwith if his detention is not required in any other case.\n\nCRLA No.120 of 2023 filed by appellant Sk. Asif Alli\n\n@ Md. Asif Iqbal is allowed in part. The conviction of the\n\nappellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif Iqbal under\nsection 376-D\nof\n\nthe I.P.C. is hereby set aside, however his conviction under\n\nsections 302\n/\n376-A\nof the I.P.C. and\nsection 6\nof the POCSO Act\n\nis upheld. The sentence of life imprisonment awarded by the\n\nlearned trial Court to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif Iqbal\n\nfor the offence under\nsection 376-A\nof the I.P.C., which shall\n\nmean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life, stands\n\nconfirmed. No separate sentence is awarded to the appellant Sk.\n\nAsif Alli @ Md. Asif Iqbal for his conviction under\nsection 6\nof the\n\nPOCSO Act. The death sentence awarded to the appellant Sk.\n\nAsif Alli @ Md.
