The case of the Prosecution is that the marriage between the\n\nappellant/accused and the deceased, Santha took place on 03.06.2001 at\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nUdayar Thimuana Hall, Paramakudi and that at the time of marriage, 40\n\nsovereigns of gold jewels and household articles were given by the parents\n\nof the deceased and that thereafter, when they were living at K.K.Pudur,\n\nCoimbatore, the appellant/accused, suspecting fidelity of the deceased, had\n\nquestioned her as to whether she was having a boyfriend and abused her\n\nwith harsh words and thereby, committed cruelty on her. On 20.02.2006,\n\nduring night hours, the appellant/accused had abused the deceased in a\n\nfilthy language and saying her “to go to her parental home immediately or\n\nelse he will send her out from his house\". On 21.02.2006 around 8.00 a.m.,\n\nthe appellant/accused had abused her, saying her to go and die, due to\n\nwhich, the deceased committed suicide by self immolation by pouring\n\nkerosene. Hence, the Appellant/Accused was charge sheeted for the\n\noffences under\nSections 498A\nand\nof IPC.\n\n3. The final report was filed before the learned Judicial Magistrate No.3,\n\nCoimbatore in PRC No.13 of 2006. After furnishing copies under\nSection 207\n\nCr.PC to the Appellant/Accused, since the case was exclusively triable by a\n\nCourt of Sessions, the case was committed to the Principal District and\n\nSessions Judge, Coimbatore, who in turn, had made over the case to the\n\nMahila Court, Coimbatore for trial.\n\n4. The Trial Court, after perusing the documents and hearing both sides, had\n\nframed necessary charges against the appellant/accused for the offence\n\nunder\nSections 498A\nand\nof IPC. The accused had denied the charges\n\nand sought for trial. In order to bring home the charges against the accused,\n\non the side of the prosecution PWs.1 to 16 were examined and Exs.P1 to\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nP23 and M.Os.1 to 7 were marked.\n\n5. On completion of the evidence on the side of the prosecution, the accused\n\nwas questioned under\nSection 313\nCr.PC as to the incriminating\n\ncircumstances found in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and the\n\naccused has come with the version of total denial and stated that he has\n\nbeen falsely implicated in this case. On the side of the defence, D.W.1 was\n\nexamined and Ex.D.1 was marked.\n\n6. The Trial Court, after hearing the arguments advanced on either side and\n\nalso looking into the materials available on record, while acquitting the\n\nAppellant/Accused for the offence under\nSection 498A\nof IPC, found the\n\naccused/appellant guilty for the offence under\nSection 306\nof IPC and\n\nconvicted and sentenced him to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for five\n\nyears and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo six months\n\nRigorous Imprisonment, which is challenged in this Criminal Appeal.\n\n7. This court heard the learned counsel on either side.\n\n8. The learned counsel for the appellant/accused would submit that the Trial\n\nCourt, having acquitted the appellant/accused for the offence under\nSection\n\n498A\nof IPC on the same set of facts and evidence, erred in convicting the\n\nappellant/accused for the offence under\nSection 306\nof IPC. He would submit\n\nthat the Trial Court had failed to take into consideration that PW.1, father,\n\nPW.2, mother and PW.3, brother of the victim/deceased have not supported\n\nthe case of the prosecution and they have been treated as hostile and that\n\nTrial Court erred in believing Ex.P20, dying declaration, despite the fact that\n\nthe scribe of the complaint one Kaleeswari, the Sub Inspector of Police who\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nhad recorded the statement of the deceased and one Doctor Sekar, who had\n\nattested the same, have not been examined.\n\n9. The learned counsel for the Appellant/Accused would further submit that the\n\nother independent witness, PW.4, has also not supported the case of the\n\nprosecution and that though Ex.P5, medical certificate was stated to have\n\nbeen recorded in the presence of the Judicial Magistrate and though the duty\n\nDoctor was stated to have attested in Ex.P.5, she has not certified that the\n\nvictim was physically and mentally fit at the time of giving the dying\n\ndeclaration and that when no such certification has been made and the\n\ndoctor having not been examined, the Trial Court erred in placing reliance\n\non Ex.P5 to base conviction. He would further submit that even assuming\n\nthat the contents of the dying declaration are taken to be true, the\n\nProsecution did not make out a case for abetment of suicide and that before\n\ninvoking and raising presumption under\nSection 113A\nof the Evidence\n\nAct,1872, the prerequisites must be established by the Prosecution\n\n10.The learned counsel for the Appellant would further submit that admittedly,\n\nthere are two dying declarations in this case, viz. (1) the dying declaration\n\nrecorded by PW.13, Judicial Magistrate, which was marked as Ex.P10 and\n\n(2) another dying declaration recorded by one Kaleeswari, Sub Inspector of\n\nPolice, which was marked as Ex.P20, which formed basis for registration of\n\nthe complaint and that the glaring contradiction and inconsistencies between\n\nthe contents of Ex.P10 and Ex.P20 belies the case of the Prosecution,\n\ncreating a doubt in the case of the Prosecution and that due to the\n\ncontradictions, recording of the dying declaration by PW.13, Judicial\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nMagistrate becomes suspicious and further, the said Kaleeswari, Sub\n\nInspector of Police, who was stated to have been recorded the subsequent\n\nstatement, has also not been examined and thereby creating a doubt in the\n\ncase of the Prosecution. He would further submit that one\n\nDr.Balasubramanian, who was examined on the side of the defence as\n\nDW.1, who is the colleague of Dr.Sangeetha, had stated that the said\n\nDr.Sangeetha had signed Ex.P5, however, no seal has been affixed to\n\ncorroborate the same and that DW.1 had also stated that the counter\n\nsignature / initial found in the corrections made in the column, viz., ''whether\n\nthe patient was mentally fit to give such a statement?'' pertains to that of\n\nDr.Sangeetha, thereby creating a doubt with regard to the fitness of the\n\ndeceased at the time of recording of the dying declaration and that DW.1 had\n\nfurther deposed that the victim was administered with pethidine and thereby\n\nsuggesting that the victim could not have been in a fit state to give such a\n\ndying declaration.\n\n11.The learned counsel for the Appellant/ accused would further submit that\n\nthough a presumption could be drawn under\nSection 113A\nof the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, against that Appellant/Accused, the initial burden of proving\n\nsuch an offence has been committed by the appellant/accused under\nSection\n\n498A\nIPC is on the prosecution and only on such evidence, the Court may\n\npresume that the Appellant/ accused had abetted and further, the\n\npresumption under\nSection 113A\nof the Indian Evidence Act is not as strict as\n\nmandated in\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act. He would further\n\nsubmit that on facts, the Prosecution has not discharged the initial burden\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthat the husband had instigated, abetted or intentionally aided so as to drive\n\nthe wife to commit suicide or that the acts of the appellant were of such a\n\ndecree which was likely to drive the wife to commit suicide.\n\n12.The learned counsel for the Appellant/Accused would submit that conviction\n\nfor offence under\nSection 306\nof IPC is not sustainable on the allegation of\n\nharassment without there being any positive action of instigation or\n\nintentional aid proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of accused,\n\nwhich led or compelled the person to commit suicide. He would rely on the\n\ndecisions of the Honourable Supreme Court in 2019 SCC Online SC 44\n\n(\nRajesh V. State of Haryana\n) and (2019) 3 SCC 315 (\nM.Arjunan Vs. State\n),\n\nin support of his contentions.\n\n13.Per Contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that\n\nthough the parents of the deceased have not supported the case of the\n\nprosecution and have turned hostile, Ex.P10, dying declaration given by the\n\ndeceased and recorded by PW.13, the Judicial Magistrate, in the presence of\n\nthe duty Doctor, who had certified with regard to the fitness, is clinching and\n\nthe Trial Court placing reliance on the dying declaration of the victim had\n\nrightly convicted the Appellant/ accused. He would further submit that the\n\nincident had occurred at 8.00 a.m., on 21.02.2006, and the dying declaration\n\nwas recorded at 9.50 a.m., on the same day within one hour and that the\n\nvictim had specifically stated that her husband suspected her fidelity and that\n\nafter consuming liquor, he used to beat her and that on the previous day, he\n\nhad consumed liquor and had beaten her and even in the morning, prior to\n\nthe occurrence the appellant/accused had created a problem with the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nvictim/deceased and thereby, she being fed up with her life had gone into the\n\nbathroom and committed suicide by self immolating herself. He would further\n\nsubmit that Ex.P5 is the Certificate of Fitness issued by Dr.Sangeetha,\n\ncertifying that the victim was conscious and was in a fit state of mind when\n\nthe dying declaration was recorded by PW.13, Judicial Magistrate.\n\nSubsequently, a statement had been recorded by the Sub Inspector of\n\nPolice, Kaleeswari, in the presence of Dr.Sangeetha. Even eschewing all\n\nother statements, Ex.P10, the dying declaration recorded by PW.13, Judicial\n\nMagistrate, is clinching and there is no reason to disbelieve it. There is no\n\ncontradiction between the statements recorded from the deceased and there\n\nis no reason or circumstance giving rise to any suspicion about its\n\ntruthfulness. He would further submit that the Trial Court, raising\n\npresumption against the appellant/accused under\nSection 113A\nof the\n\nEvidence Act and accepting the dying declaration as the statement made\n\nunder\nSection 32\nof the Evidence Act, has rightly convicted the\n\nappellant/accused and that though the parents of the deceased have turned\n\nhostile before the Court, the Trial Court, placing reliance on the dying\n\ndeclaration of the victim and other corroborative evidence through\n\nindependent witness, had rightly convicted the appellant/accused.\n\n14.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that the statements\n\nhave been recorded during RDO Enquiry wherein the father, mother and\n\nbrother of the victim/deceased have stated in detail with regard to the\n\nharassment, meted out to the victim deceased and that immediately after the\n\noccurrence, a statement has been recorded by Kalaimani, the Sub Inspector\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof Police in the presence of Dr.Sangeetha, who has certified about the\n\nconsciousness of the patient while the statement was recorded, wherein the\n\nvictim had vividly stated about the harassment inflicted on her by the\n\nappellant/accused.\n\n15.At this juncture, the learned counsel for the appellant/ accused would\n\nsubmit that the statements recorded, during the enquiry by the Revenue\n\nDivisional Officer can only be construed as statements recorded during the\n\nenquiry/investigation and that the close relatives have not supported the case\n\nof the prosecution in the witness box during the trial and thereby the\n\nstatements made before the RDO cannot be taken into consideration and\n\nthey have to be brushed aside. He would further submit that the Trial Court\n\nought to have taken into consideration the attended circumstances in the\n\ncase and that the presumptions against the appellant/accused under\nSection\n\n113A\nof the Evidence Act having not been proved, ought to have acquitted\n\nthe Appellant. He would also submit that as per the Accident Register,\n\nEx.P6, the deceased was stated to have sustained 100% burn injuries, which\n\nwere II to III degree burns and it would not have been possible to give a\n\ndying declaration. Further, the conduct of the Appellant/Accused\n\nimmediately after the occurrence would infer that it was not the intention of\n\nthe appellant/accused to drive the victim to commit suicide and that it could\n\nbe inferred from the facts that immediately after the occurrence he had\n\nattempted to save his wife, due to which he had sustained grievous injuries\n\nand was admitted as an inpatient and the treatment taken by him in the\n\nhospital has been spoken to by PW.15, Investigating Officer and these facts\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nimprobabilise the theory of the appellant having abetted suicide. In support of\n\nthe above contentions, the learned counsel for the appellant/accused would\n\nrely on the judgement reported in (2001) 9 SCC 618 Ramesh Kumar V.\n\nState of Chhattisgarh.\n\n16.I have given my careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions\n\nput forward by either side and thoroughly scanned through the entire\n\nevidence available on record and also perused the impugned judgement of\n\nconviction.\n\n17.The Trial Court, in and by the impugned judgement, while acquitting the\n\nAppellant/Accused for the offence under\nSection 498A\nof IPC, had found the\n\nAppellant/Accused guilty and sentenced him for the offence under\nSection\nof IPC, as stated above, holding that the Prosecution, by cogent\n\nevidence, had proved that the Appellants/ accused had committed acts of\n\nincitement to the commission of suicide by the deceased.\n\n18.Now, the Points for consideration is as to whether the Trial Court is justified\n\nin convicting Appellant/Accused for the offence under Section\nSection 306\nof\n\nIPC despite the fact that the relatives of the victim/deceased turning hostile\n\nand having not supported the case of the Prosecution and there being\n\nmultiple statements recorded from the deceased.\n\n19.In this context, while analysing the entire evidence, PW.1, Nithyanandham, a\n\nretired Government Servant, PW.2, Indirani and PW.3, Sivasankaran, PW.4,\n\nMayadevi, are respectively the father, mother and brother and a neighbour,\n\nof the deceased and they have not supported the case of the Prosecution\n\nand they have been treated as hostile.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n20.PW.5, Gopinath is a witness to the preparation of the observation mahazar\n\nand he had attested the observation mahazar. PW.6, Kanagaraj, is also a\n\nwitness to the observation mahazar and also to the recovery mahazar under\n\nwhich MO.1, plastic bottle, MO.2, match stick, MO.3, piece of burn cloth,\n\nMO.4, iron hook of the door, Mos.5 and 6, photographs, MO.7, negatives,\n\nwere seized.

He had deposed that as per\n\nEx.D1, the victim/deceased had been administered with pain killers namely\n\npethidine, at 10.30 a.m. and it had been noted in the case sheet.\n\n30.An overall scrutiny of the evidence on record and the judgement of the Trial\n\nCourt shows that the Trial Court had convicted the Appellant/Accused,\n\nrelying on the statement of PW.9, Dr.Sekar, and placing reliance on Ex.P10,\n\ndying declaration recorded by PW.13, Judicial Magistrate. The learned\n\ncounsel for the Appellant/Accused has raised a point, stating that the dying\n\ndeclaration recorded by PW.13, Judicial Magistrate is doubtful and that the\n\nvictim, who had suffered 100% burn injuries, which was in the nature of II and\n\nIII Degree burns, could not have given a dying declaration. Further, as per\n\nthe evidence of DW.1 and Ex.D1, the deceased had been administered with\n\npethidine and thereby she could not have given the dying declaration and\n\nthereby, the Trial Court erred in convicting the Appellant/ accused, based on\n\nEx.P10 dying declaration and the evidence of PW.13, Judicial Magistrate.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nHe has further argued that another statement was recorded by one\n\nKaleeswari, Sub Inspector of Police (who was not examined) and there are\n\ninconsistencies in the statement recorded in the presence of Judicial\n\nMagistrate in Ex.P10 and the statement recorded by Kaleeswari, based on\n\nwhich the First Information Report was registered. He has further argued that\n\neven taking into consideration the contents of the dying declaration, the\n\ningredients of the offence under\nSection 306\nof IPC are not made out since\n\nthere was no positive action of instigation or intentional aid proximate to the\n\ntime of occurrence on the part of the Appellants/ accused. On this aspect, it\n\nis apposite to refer to the conditions precedent for convicting an accused\n\nbased on dying declaration, laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court in\n\nits decision reported in 2010 8 SCC 514 (\nLakhan Vs. State of MP\n), wherein\n\nin paragraph 9 to 21, it was held as under:-\n\n“9. The doctrine of dying declaration is enshrined in the legal\nmaxim nemo moriturus praesumitur mentire, which means “a man will\nnot meet his Maker with a lie in his mouth”. The doctrine of dying\ndeclaration is enshrined in\nSection 32\nof the Evidence Act, 1872\n(hereinafter called as “the\nEvidence Act\n”) as an exception to the\ngeneral rule contained in\nSection 60\nof the Evidence Act, which\nprovides that oral evidence in all cases must be direct i.e. it must be\nthe evidence of a witness, who says he saw it. The dying declaration\nis, in fact, the statement of a person, who cannot be called as witness\nand, therefore, cannot be cross-examined. Such statements\nthemselves are relevant facts in certain cases.\n\n10. This Court has considered time and again the relevance/probative\nvalue of dying declarations recorded under different situations and\nalso in cases where more than one dying declaration has been\nrecorded. The law is that if the court is satisfied that the dying\ndeclaration is true and made voluntarily by the deceased, conviction\ncan be based solely on it, without any further corroboration. It is\nneither a rule of law nor of prudence that a dying declaration cannot\nbe relied upon without corroboration. When a dying declaration is\nsuspicious, it should not be relied upon without having corroborative\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nevidence. The court has to scrutinise the dying declaration carefully\nand must ensure that the declaration is not the result of tutoring,\nprompting or imagination. The deceased must be in a fit state of mind\nto make the declaration and must identify the assailants.\nMerely\nbecause a dying declaration does not contain the details of the\noccurrence, it cannot be rejected and in case there is merely a brief\nstatement, it is more reliable for the reason that the shortness of the\nstatement is itself a guarantee of its veracity. If the dying declaration\nsuffers from some infirmity, it cannot alone form the basis of\nconviction. Where the prosecution version differs from the version\ngiven in the dying declaration, the said declaration cannot be acted\nupon. (\nVide Khushal Rao v. State of Bombay\n[AIR 1958 SC 22 : 1958\nCri LJ 106] , Rasheed Beg v. State of M.P. [(1974) 4 SCC 264 : 1974\nSCC (Cri) 426 :\nAIR 1974 SC 332] , K. Ramachandra Reddy v.

State of U.P.\n[(2010) 5 SCC 451 : (2010) 2 SCC\n(Cri) 1285] this Court held that a dying declaration can be relied upon\nif the deceased remained alive for a long period of time after the\nincident and died after recording of the dying declaration. That may be\nevidence to show that his condition was not overtly critical or\nprecarious when the dying declaration was recorded.\n\n12. A dying declaration recorded by a competent Magistrate would\nstand on a much higher footing than the declaration recorded by\nofficer of lower rank, for the reason that the competent Magistrate has\nno axe to grind against the person named in the dying declaration of\nthe victim, however, circumstances showing anything to the contrary\nshould not be there in the facts of the case. (Vide Ravi\nChander v. State of Punjab [(1998) 9 SCC 303 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 1004]\n, Harjit Kaur v. State of Punjab [(1999) 6 SCC 545 : 1999 SCC (Cri)\n1130] , Koli Chunilal Savji v. State of Gujarat [(1999) 9 SCC 562 :\n\n2000 SCC (Cri) 432] and Vikas v. State of Maharashtra [(2008) 2 SCC\n516 : (2008) 1 SCC (Cri) 486] .)\n\n13.\nIn\nBalak Ram v. State of U.P.\n[(1975) 3 SCC 219 : 1974 SCC (Cri)\n837 : AIR 1974 SC 2165] the question arose as to whether a dying\ndeclaration recorded by a higher officer can be discarded in case of\nmultiple dying declarations. The Court held as under: (SCC p. 235,\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npara 54)\n\n“54. … The circumstances surrounding the dying declaration, though\nuninspiring, are not strong enough to justify the view that officers as\nhigh in the hierarchy as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, the Civil\nSurgeon and the District Magistrate hatched a conspiracy to bring a\nfalse document into existence. The civil services (sic servants) have\nno platform to controvert allegations, howsoever grave and\nunfounded. It is, therefore, necessary that charges calculated to\nimpair their career and character ought not to be accepted except on\nthe clearest proof. We are not prepared to hold that the dying\ndeclaration is a fabrication.”\n\n14.\nIn\nSayarabano v. State of Maharashtra\n[(2007) 12 SCC 562 :\n\n(2008) 3 SCC (Cri) 303] , two dying declarations had been recorded.\n\nAs per the first declaration, the deceased had met with an accident.\nShe was hit by the kerosene lamp which fell on her body and caught\nfire. While recording the second declaration, the Judicial Magistrate\nasked her why she was changing her statement. The deceased\nreplied that her mother-in-law had told her not to give any statement\nagainst the family members of her in-laws and that was the reason,\nwhy she had not involved any person in the earlier statement. But, in\nfact, it was her mother-in-law who threw the kerosene lamp on her\nand thus, she was burnt. She also stated that her mother-in-law was\nharassing her. In such a situation, this Court held that the second\ndying declaration was true and inspired confidence. Ill treatment of the\ndeceased was clearly established and completely proved on the basis\nof the evidence of other witnesses.\n\n15. In case, there are inconsistent dying declarations, the Court must\nrely upon any other evidence, if available, as it is not safe to act only\non inconsistent dying declarations and convict the accused.\n(\nVide Lella Srinivasa Rao v. State of A.P.\n[(2004) 9 SCC 713 : 2004\nSCC (Cri) 1479] )\n\n16.\nIn\nSher Singh v. State of Punjab\n[(2008) 4 SCC 265 : (2008) 2\nSCC (Cri) 783 : AIR 2008 SC 1426] , a case of bride burning, three\ndying declarations had been recorded. In the first dying declaration,\nthe deceased had denied the role of the accused persons. In the\nsecond dying declaration the deceased attributed a role to the\naccused but the said declaration did not contain the certificate of the\ndoctor that the deceased was in a fit state of mind to make a\ndeclaration, however, the Magistrate, who recorded the declaration,\ncertified that the deceased was in a conscious state of mind and was\nin a position to make the statement to him. The third dying declaration\nwas recorded by a police officer after the doctor certified that she was\nin a fit state of mind to give the statement. This Court held that the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nconviction could be based on the third dying declaration as it was\nconsistent with the second dying declaration and the oral dying\ndeclaration made to her uncle, though with some inconsistencies.\nFirst declaration was made immediately after she was admitted in the\nhospital and was under threat and duress by her mother-in-law that\nshe would be admitted in hospital only if she would give a statement\nin favour of the accused persons.\n\n17.\nIn\nParas Yadav v. State of Bihar\n[(1999) 2 SCC 126 : 1999 SCC\n(Cri) 104] this Court held that a statement of the deceased recorded\nby a police officer in a routine manner as a complaint and not as a\ndying declaration can also be treated as dying declaration after the\ndeath of the injured and relied upon if the evidence of the prosecution\nwitnesses clearly establishes that the deceased was conscious and\nwas in a fit state of health to make the statement.\n\n18.\nIn\nAmol Singh v. State of M.P.\n[(2008) 5 SCC 468 : (2008) 2 SCC\n(Cri) 637] this Court, placing reliance upon the earlier judgment\nin\nKundula Bala Subrahmanyam v. State of A.P.\n[(1993) 2 SCC 684 :\n\n1993 SCC (Cri) 655] , held that it is not the plurality of dying\ndeclarations but the reality thereto that adds weight to the prosecution\ncase. If a dying declaration is found to be voluntary, reliable and made\nin a fit mental condition, it can be relied upon without any\ncorroboration. If there is more than one dying declaration, they should\nbe consistent. In case of inconsistencies between two or more dying\ndeclarations made by the deceased, the Court has to examine the\nnature of inconsistencies, namely, whether they are material or not\nand in such a situation, the Court has to examine the multiple dying\ndeclarations in the light of the various surrounding facts and\ncircumstances.\n\n19.\nIn\nHeeralal v. State of M.P.\n[(2009) 12 SCC 671 : (2010) 1 SCC\n(Cri) 686] this Court considered the case having two dying\ndeclarations, the first recorded by a Magistrate, wherein it was clearly\nstated that the deceased had tried to set herself ablaze by pouring\nkerosene on herself. However, the subsequent declaration was\nrecorded by another Magistrate and a contrary statement was made.\nThis Court set aside the conviction after appreciating the evidence\nand reaching the conclusion that the courts below came to abrupt\nconclusions on the purported possibility that the relatives of the\naccused might have compelled the deceased to give a false dying\ndeclaration. No material had been brought on record to justify such a\nconclusion.\n\n20.\nIn\nState of A.P. v. P. Khaja Hussain\n[(2009) 15 SCC 120 : (2010) 2\nSCC (Cri) 380] this Court set aside the conviction as there was a\nvariation between the two dying declarations about the manner in\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhich the deceased was set on fire and for the reason that there was\nno other evidence to connect the accused with the crime.\n\n21. In view of the above, the law on the issue of dying declaration can\nbe summarised to the effect that in case the court comes to the\nconclusion that the dying declaration is true and reliable, has been\nrecorded by a person at a time when the deceased was fit physically\nand mentally to make the declaration and it has not been made under\nany tutoring/duress/prompting; it can be the sole basis for recording\nconviction. In such an eventuality no corroboration is required. In case\nthere are multiple dying declarations and there are inconsistencies\nbetween them, generally, the dying declaration recorded by the higher\nofficer like a Magistrate can be relied upon, provided that there is no\ncircumstance giving rise to any suspicion about its truthfulness. In\ncase there are circumstances wherein the declaration had been\nmade, not voluntarily and even otherwise, it is not supported by the\nother evidence, the court has to scrutinise the facts of an individual\ncase very carefully and take a decision as to which of the declarations\nis worth reliance.”\n\n31.While analysing the case on hand in the light of the aforesaid settled legal\n\npreposition, in this case, as per the evidence of PW.9, Dr.Sekar, he had\n\ndeposed about the admission of the victim/ deceased in the Hosptal on\n\n21.2.2006 at 8.55 a.m. and that the intimation under Ex.P4 had been sent to\n\nthe Judicial Magistrate, who had recorded the dying declaration from the\n\nvictim/ deceased between 9.55 a.m. and 10.03 a.m. and that the Duty Doctor\n\nSangeetha had certified to the fitness of the victim/ deceased in giving the\n\nstatement and that after recording of dying declaration, the victim/ deceased\n\nhad died on 4.3.2006 at 12.40 p.m. The case history was marked as Ex.P6\n\nand he had deposed that the reason for not examining Dr.S.Sangeetha was\n\nthat she was not presently working in the Hospital and that he had identified\n\nthe signatures of Dr.S.Sangeetha. Admittedly, on admission of the victim, the\n\nintimation was sent to the Judicial Magistrate, PW.13, who had recorded the\n\nstatement. Yet another ground raised by the learned counsel for the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nAppellant was that the victim/ deceased was administered with pethidine and\n\nshe could not have given the dying declaration and he had relied on Ex.D1,\n\nthe case sheet. A perusal of the records shows that pethidine had been\n\nadministered to the victim/ deceased at 10.30 a.m., whereas the dying\n\ndeclaration had been recorded much prior to it at 10.03 a.m. itself. There is\n\nno reason to doubt about the recording of the dying declaration, Ex.P10.\n\n32.Another point raised by the learned counsel for the Appellant/ accused is\n\nthat yet another statement was recorded by one Kaleeswari, which had been\n\nmarked as Ex.P20, based on which the First Information Report was\n\nregistered. The learned counsel for the Appellant/Accused has argued that\n\nthere were inconsistencies in the dying declaration. As stated above, when\n\nthere are more than one dying declaration, the Law is that if the dying\n\ndeclaration is true and made voluntarily by the deceased, conviction can be\n\nbased solely on it without any further corroboration and it is neither a rule of\n\nlaw nor or prudence that a dying declaration cannot be relied upon without\n\ncorroboration.\n\n33.The Court has to scrutinise the dying declaration carefully and must ensure\n\nthat the dying declaration is not result of tutoring, prompting or imagination.\n\nThis Court has carefully gone through the dying declarations. The dying\n\ndeclaration under Ex.P10 has been recorded by a Judicial Magistrate, which\n\nwould stand on much higher footing than the dying declaration recorded by\n\nan officer of lower rank. Subsequently, a statement had been recorded by the\n\nSub Inspector of Police, Kaleeswari, which had been marked as Ex.P20.\n\nEven eschewing Ex.P20, the dying declaration recorded by the Judicial\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nMagistrate, inspires confidence\n\n34.However, strangely, in this case, all the relatives of the victim/deceased,\n\nPW.1 to PW.3, father, mother and brother of the deceased, respectively and\n\nPW.7 and PW.8, cousin and maternal grand father of the deceased, have\n\nnot supported the case of the prosecution and they have been treated as\n\nhostile by the prosecution.\n\n35.In this case, there are two dying declarations, viz. Ex.P20 recorded by one\n\nS.Kalaimani, Sub Inspector of Police, B1 Police Station in the presence of\n\nDr.S.Sangeetha and Ex.P10 was recorded by PW.13, Judicial Magistrate. In\n\nEx.P5, Dr. Sangeetha had certified with regard to the fitness of the victim at\n\ntime of recording dying declaration. It was contended by the counsel for the\n\nappellant that reliance cannot be placed on the statement recorded by\n\nKalaimani, sub Inspector of Police without the said Kalaimani being\n\nexamined.\n\n36.The fact remains that Ex.P10 was recorded by P.W.13, Judicial Magistrate in\n\nthe presence of Dr.Sangeetha, who had certified in Ex.P5 as under:-\n\n@vd; fzth; vd; kPJ re;njfg;gl;L mof;fo vd;id\njpl;Lthh;/ mjdhy; vdf;Fk; vd; fztUf;Fk; mof;fo\ngpur;rpid Vw;gLk; vd; fzth; kJ mUe;jptpl;L ve;J\n\nvd;id mog;ghh;/ new;W (20/02/2006) ,ut[ vd; fzth; jz;zp\nmoj;J tpl;L te;J vd;id moj;jhh;/ mJ gw;wp vd;\n\nfzthpd; mz;zdplk; brhd;ndd;/ ,d;W fhiy kPz;Lk; vd;\n\nfzth; vd;dplk; gpur;rpid bra;jhh;/ mjdhy; ehd; kpft[k;\n\nbtWj;J ngha; vd;tPl;L ghj;Uk : f\n; ;Fs; brd;W ehnd vd;kPJ\nkz;bzz;bza; Cw;wp jP itj;Jf; bfhz;nld;/ FLk;g\n\ngpur;rpiz kw;Wk; vd; fzth; vd; kPJ re;njfg;gl;ljhYk;\nehd; ,g;go bra;J bfhz;nld;/@\n\n37.In Ex.P10, it was recorded to the effect that the deceased was in a fit state of\n\nmind at the time recording dying declaration and that after understanding the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncontents of the same, she affixed her left big toe impression on the same and\n\nthat duty Doctor was also there at that time. Even in Ex.P20, the deceased\n\nhad stated that the Appellant, suspecting her fidelity, was abusing her in a\n\nfilthy language frequently and that he shouted against the deceased, saying\n\nthat she should go to her parents house and had beaten her.\n\n38.In Ex.P18, RDO Report, though it has been stated that the death of the\n\ndeceased was not due to dowry harassment, however, it was opined that the\n\nAppellant/ accused suspecting her fidelity, had abused her in a filthy\n\nlanguage and harassed her and hence, unable to bear with such\n\nharassment, the deceased committed suicide.\n\n39.As regards the dying declaration, the Honourable Supreme Court, in 2017\n\n[1] SCC 529 [Ramesh and Others V. State of Haryana], has held in\n\nparagraph No.31 thus:-\n\n''31.Law on the admissibility of the dying declarations is well settled.\n\nIn\nJai Karan v. State of N.C.T., Delhi MANU/SC/0613/1999\n: (1999) 8\nSCC 161, this Court explained that a dying declaration is admissible\nin evidence on the principle of necessity and can form the basis of\nconviction if it is found to be reliable. In order that a dying declaration\nmay form the sole basis for conviction without the need for\nindependent corroboration it must be shown that the person making it\nhad the opportunity of identifying the person implicated and is\nthoroughly reliable and free from blemish. If, in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, it is found that the maker of the statement\nwas in a fit state of mind and had voluntarily made the statement on\nthe basis of personal knowledge without being influenced by others\nand the court on strict scrutiny finds it to be reliable, there is no Rule\nof law or even of prudence that such a reliable piece of evidence\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated. A dying declaration is\nan independent piece of evidence like any other piece of evidence,\nneither extra strong or weak, and can be acted upon without\ncorroboration if it is found to be otherwise true and reliable. There is\nno hard and fast Rule of universal application as to whether\npercentage of burns suffered is determinative factor to affect\ncredibility of dying declaration and improbability of its recording. Much\ndepends upon the nature of the burn, part of the body affected by the\nburn, impact of the burn on the faculties to think and convey the idea\nor facts coming to mind and other relevant factors. Percentage of\nburns alone would not determine the probability or otherwise of\nmaking dying declaration.\n\nPhysical state or injuries on the declarant\ndo not by themselves become determinative of mental fitness of the\ndeclarant to make the statement (See\nRambai v. State of\nChhatisgarh MANU/SC/0856/2002\n: (2002) 8 SCC 83).”\n\n40.In 2019 SCC Online SC 44 (\nRajesh V. State of Haryana\n) and (2019) 3\n\nSCC 315 (\nM.Arjunan Vs. State\n), the Honourable Supreme Court has held\n\nthat the essential ingredients of the offence under\nSection 306\nof IPC are (i)\n\nthe abetment and (ii) the intention of the accused to aid or instigate or abet\n\nthe deceased to commit suicide. The act of the accused however insulting\n\nthe deceased by using abusive language will not, by itself, constitute the\n\nabetment of suicide. There should be evidence capable of suggesting that\n\nthe accused intended by such act to instigate the deceased to commit\n\nsuicide. Unless the ingredients of instigation/abetment to commit suicide are\n\nsatisfied, an accused cannot be convicted under\nSection 306\nof IPC.\n\n41.In 2018 9 SCC 621 (\nSiddaling Vs. State\nthrough Kalagi Police Station), the\n\nHonourable Supreme Court has held that abetment involves a mental\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in process of instigating a person in any manner aiding that person in doing of a\nthing and that Courts should carefully assess the facts of each case before\n\ndeciding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had induced her to\n\ncommit suicide.\n\n42.In this case, on a close reading of the dying declarations and other evidence\n\non record, it is seen that the victim had been continuously subjected to\n\nharassment by the appellant/accused, suspecting her fidelity. There had\n\nbeen a continuous mental process whereby the victim/ deceased had been\n\ninstigated to commit suicide. Even just prior to the occurrence, the\n\nappellant/accused had subjected her to cruelty and thereby in the opinion of\n\nthis Court, the Prosecution has proved the ingredients of\nSection 306\nof IPC.\n\nThough the close relatives, viz., father, mother and brother of the\n\nvictim/deceased have turned hostile and have not supported the case of the\n\nprosecution, the Prosecution had proved its case through the dying\n\ndeclaration,Ex.P.10, recorded by P.W.13-Judicial Magistrate and that the\n\ndeceased was in a fit state of mind at the time of recording dying declaration.\n\nThis Court finds no reason to disbelieve the dying declaration, Ex.P10.\n\n43.Keeping in mind the above ratio\nlaid down by\nthe Honourable Supreme\n\nCourt, this Court is of the considered view that the dying declaration as well\n\nas the statements given by the victim/deceased to the learned Magistrate as\n\nwell as to the Doctors do not suffer any infirmity. Further, while analysing the\n\ncontents of the dying declaration, this Court is of the opinion that it was the\n\nappellant/accused who, by his acts, abetted and had driven the victim to take\n\nan extreme step of putting an end to her life, by committing suicide and that\n\nthe Trial Court, had rightly convicted him for the offence under Section 306 of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nIPC\n.\n\n44.Now coming to the question of sentence, it is the contention of the learned\n\ncounsel for the Appellant/Accused that admittedly, immediately after the\n\noccurrence, the appellant/accused had made an attempt to save his\n\nwife/victim and admitted her in the hospital and thereby, he had also\n\nsustained injuries and he was also hospitalised, thereby, suggesting that the\n\nintention of the appellant/accused was not to abet the victim to commit\n\nsuicide. Further, the parents and the brother of the victim have also not\n\nsupported the case of the prosecution and presently his child is with him and\n\nhe is taking case of his child and the above mitigating circumstances may be\n\ntaken into consideration for reduction of sentence.\n\n45.The evidence of PW.7, Dr.Sekar and perusal of the Accident Register,\n\nEx.P.6 discloses that the victim was brought to the hospital with burn injuries\n\nby her husband, the appellant/accused herein. The Appellant had sustained\n\nsevere injuries while attempting to save the deceased. Considering the\n\nattended and mitigating circumstances that immediately after the occurrence,\n\nthe appellant/accused had attempted to save the life of his wife and that he\n\nhad also sustained burn injuries and further that the appellant/accused has\n\ngot a child to take care of and that he has not committed any further criminal\n\nacts pursuant to his release on bail, this Court is of the considered view that\n\nreducing the sentence of imprisonment imposed on him to a period of one\n\nyear rigorous imprisonment, would meet the ends of justice.\n\nA.D.JAGADISH CHANDIRA, J.\n\nSrcm\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n46.In the result, this Criminal Appeal is partly allowed. The impugned judgement\n\nof conviction and sentence for the offence under\nSection 306\nof IPC is\n\nconfirmed. However, considering the above said mitigating circumstances,\n\nwhile confirming the imposition of fine amount, with default sentence, the\n\nsentence of Rigorous Imprisonment is modified to the period of one year\n\nRigorous Imprisonment. Since it is reported that the appellant/accused is on\n\nbail, the Respondent Police police is directed to secure the presence of the\n\nappellant/accused to undergo the period of sentence now imposed.\n\n18.07.2019\nIndex:Yes/No\nWeb:Yes/No\nSpeaking Order /Non Speaking Order\nssi/Srcm\n\nTo:\n\n1.
