As such,\n\nthere is sufficient evidence against the\n\naccused for commission of an alleged\n\noffences, therefore, he had withdrawn the\n\nsaid complaint with permission to file a\n\nfresh complaint.\n\n4. Learned Senior counsel submits that,\n\nafter withdrawal of the said complaint, the\n\ncomplainant was duty bound to first approach\n\nunder\nsection 154\nof Cr.P.C. to an officer\n\nIncharge of Police Station, and to produce\n\nthe additional material, which he has\n\nreceived under\nRight to Information Act\n.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nHowever, without availing of the remedy under\n\nsection 154\nof Cr.P.C., an immediately within\n\na period of two months from withdrawing an\n\nearlier complaint and without producing any\n\nadditional material/allegations, present\n\nrespondent no.2 has filed Criminal Misc.\n\nApplication No.22/2017, before the District\n\nand Sessions Court, Dhule, by merely adding\n\nsections 3\nand\nof the Maharashtra\n\nProtection of Interest of Depositors (In\n\nFinancial Establishment) Act, 1999 (for short\n\nM.P.I.D.

It is observed by the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Priyanka Srivastava\n\n(supra) that, an affidavit duly sworn by the\n\ncomplainant makes him more responsible, it is\n\nbecause, once the affidavit is found false,\n\nhe would be liable for prosecution in\n\naccordance with law. The Magistrate is duty\n\nbond to verify veracity of the same and\n\nthe nature of the allegations of the case.\n\nIn the present case, the trial Court has\n\nfailed to follow the law laid down by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\n1 2015(6) S.C.C. 287\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nPriyanka Srivastava (supra).\n\n5.

He\n\nsubmits that, even though petitioner nos.1,\n\n2, 9, 10 and 11 are the Directors of\n\nDadasaheb Waman Vishnu Shinkar Nagari\n\nSahakari Pathpedi Ltd., Dhule (hereinafter\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nreferred to as \"the Pathpedi\"), and\n\ntherefore, the provisions of sections 3 and 4\n\nof M.P.I.D.

Act, would attract, or to whom the\n\ndeposits are not returned.\n\n6. Learned senior counsel further\n\nsubmits that, the complainant and his wife\n\navailed the loan facility from the said\n\nPathpedi and since they failed to repay the\n\nsaid loan amount, the Pathpedi obtained the\n\nRecovery Certificate under\nSection 101\nof the\n\nMaharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960\n\n(M.C.S.

As\n\nsuch the Pathpedi filed two different\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nproceedings bearing S.T.C.

The\n\nfamily members of petitioners approached\n\nHigh Court by filing Writ Petition\n\nNo.7256/2010 (Shri Nandlal Taniram Sonje and\n\nothers V/s The State of Maharashtra and\n\nothers) and the High Court by considering the\n\npast record of respondent no.2 quashed the\n\nappointment of present respondent no.2 as a\n\nfit person. He submits that, the Advocate\n\nGeneral of Maharashtra State has prosecuted\n\nthe present respondent no.2 under the\n\nprovisions of the\nMaharashtra Vexatious\n\nLitigation (Prevention) Act, 1971\n. Learned\n\nSenior counsel submits that, in order to take\n\nrevenge, respondent no.2 has filed the\n\npresent proceeding against the family members\n\nof Shinkar family. The present proceeding is\n\nnot initiated against all the Directors of\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nPathpedi, however, the same is initiated by\n\nadopting the method of pick and choose\n\npolicy, that too members of Shinkar family\n\nonly. One of the allegation in\n\ncomplaint/proceeding is that, petitioner nos.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 have taken\n\nconcession/rebate on the rate of interest of\n\nloan. However, the proceeding shows that,\n\npresent respondent no.2 has not filed\n\naffidavit duly sworn by him indicating\n\nthat, how many persons have taken\n\nconcession/rebate on the rate of interest of\n\nloan, and which provisions of law have been\n\nflouted while sanctioning concession/rebate\n\non the rate of interest. Learned counsel\n\nsubmits that, it is a matter of record that,\n\npresent respondent no.2 and his wife has also\n\navailed the facility of concession/rebate on\n\nthe rate of interest of loan. Though present\n\nrespondent no.2 has filed interventions in\n\nWrit Petition no.3330/2014 (Shri Devidas\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nWaman Shinkar and others V/s The State of\n\nMaharashtra and others) and Writ Petition\n\nNo.7883/2015 (Shri Devidas Waman Shinkar and\n\nothers V/s The State of Maharashtra and\n\nothers), present respondent no.2 deliberately\n\nwith an ulterior motive for wreaking\n\nvengeance, withheld the said orders from the\n\nDistrict and Sessions Court. Therefore,\n\nlearned senior counsel submits that, the\n\ncomplaint/proceeding instituted by respondent\n\nno.2, is manifestly attended with malafide\n\nand/or the proceeding is maliciously\n\ninstituted with an ulterior motive for\n\nwreaking vengeance. In support of aforesaid\n\ncontentions, the reliance is also placed on\n\nthe exposition of law by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of State of Haryana V/s\n\nBhajan Lal2.\n\n8. Learned senior counsel submits that,\n\n2 1992 AIR (SC) 604\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nthe allegations in the first information\n\nreport or the complaint, even if taken at its\n\nface value and read in its entirety, the same\n\ndoes not constitute any offence or make out a\n\ncase against the petitioners. He submits\n\nthat, the allegations made in the first\n\ninformation report or the complaint are so\n\nabsurd and inherently improbable on the basis\n\nof which no prudent person can ever reach to\n\na conclusion for proceeding against the\n\naccused. The allegations clearly depicts that\n\nthe present proceeding manifestly attended\n\nwith malafide and/or the same is instituted\n\nwith an ulterior motive to take revenge\n\nagainst Shinkar family only. Learned Senior\n\ncounsel submits that, the complainant has\n\nneither made all the Directors as a party\n\naccused nor made any allegations against the\n\nsaid Directors. Therefore, this is nothing\n\nbut a pick and choose policy adopted by\n\nrespondent no.2 just to settle his personal\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ngrudge.\n\n9.

Already C.R. No. 97/2013,\n\nmaking allegations in respect of purchase of\n\nMangalkaryalaya is already registered against\n\npetitioner no.7, and therefore, on the same\n\nset of allegations the second F.I.R. i.e.\n\nCrime No. 14/2017, is not maintainable.\n\n18. It is further submitted that, so far\n\nas petitioner no.8 - Sau.Pramila Shashikant\n\nShinkar is concerned, she is already made\n\naccused in C.R.

So far availing of any\n\nconcession/rebate on the rate of interest on\n\nthe borrowed amount of petitioner no.8 is\n\nconcerned, it is submitted that, the loan\n\ntransaction is of 2006.

So far as allegations against\n\npetitioner no.9 - Shri Ajay S/o Prabhulal\n\nKasodekar in respect of recovery certificate\n\nissued against the father of petitioner is\n\nconcerned, the same is the subject matter of\n\nWrit Petition No. 3330 of 2014 (Shri Devidas\n\nWaman Shinkar and others V/s The State of\n\nMaharashtra and others) and along with\n\npetitioner no.1, he is also one of the\n\npetitioner in the said Writ Petition. It is\n\nsubmitted that, the recovery certificate was\n\nnot issued in respect of the petitioner. The\n\nsaid certificate was issued against the\n\nfather of petitioner no.9. It is submitted\n\nthat, so far as concession/rebate on the rate\n\nof interest is concerned, it is submitted\n\nthat, the loan transaction is of 2004 to 2006\n\nand the said account is made Nil in the year\n\n2006, and the explanation offered by\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\npetitioner no.1 in respect of allegation of\n\navailing of concession/rebate on the rate of\n\ninterest is also applicable in the case of\n\npetitioner no.9.\n\n20. So far as allegations against\n\npetitioner no.10 Shri Kapporchand Baviskar is\n\nconcerned, it is submitted that, he has\n\nbecame the Director in the year 2015 and the\n\nallegations made in the first information\n\nreport that, he is the close relative of\n\nShinkar family and the present Managing\n\nCommittee members, are not maintainable\n\nagainst him. The allegations which relates to\n\nthe period, prior to year 2006 cannot be made\n\napplicable in the case of petitioner no.10.\n\n21. So far as allegation against\n\npetitioner no.12 - Shri Sanjay Amrutkar in\n\nrespect of the concession/rebate on rate of\n\ninterest is concerned, it is submitted that,\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nsince he has not taken loan, the question of\n\navailing of concession/rebate of rate of\n\ninterest does not arise. Therefore, learned\n\nsenior counsel relying upon the pleading in\n\nthe Petition, grounds taken therein and\n\nannexures thereto, submits that the Petition\n\nmay be allowed.\n\n22. Learned counsel appearing for\n\nrespondent no.2 submits that, since already\n\nthe first information report is registered\n\npursuant to the directions issued by the\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Dhule, it is not\n\ndesirable to quash the first information\n\nreport. It is submitted that, it is observed\n\nby the Sessions Court that, without carrying\n\nout proper investigation, it is not desirable\n\nto issue process against accused by the Court\n\nat initial stage. Thus the Additional\n\nSessions Judge has not taken the cognizance\n\nand referred the matter to the police. It is\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nsubmitted that, in view of the above,\n\nposition, the order passed by the Sessions\n\nCourt on 28th February, 2017 cannot be\n\nchallenged by way of filing Writ Petition or\n\napplication under\nsection 482\nof the Cr.P.C.\n\nThe only remedy available is to file the\n\ncriminal revision application before the\n\nappropriate Court. In support of the\n\naforesaid contentions, the reliance is placed\n\non the judgment of the Division Bench of the\n\nBombay High Court Bench at Aurangabad in Writ\n\nPetition No.159/2014 (Avinash S/o Trimbakrao\n\nDhondage V/s The State of Maharashtra and\n\nanother decided on 21st October, 2015) and\n\nconnected matters thereto. It is submitted\n\nthat, the said judgment has been confirmed by\n\nthe Supreme Court.\n\n23. The Supreme Court in the case of\n\nHDFC Securities Limited and others V/s State\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nof Maharashtra and another5 has laid down the\n\nlaw that the order passed under\nsection\n\n156(3)\ndirecting registration of the first\n\ninformation report and submission of report\n\nafter investigation, if challenged by way of\n\nfiling Writ Petition or under\nsection 482\nof\n\nCr.P.C., the same is premature challenge. It\n\nis submitted that, therefore, the Supreme\n\nCourt in the said case held that the stage of\n\ntaking the cognizance arises only after the\n\ninvestigation report is filed before the\n\nMagistrate concerned. Therefore, the\n\nchallenge to an order under\nsection 156(3)\nof\n\nCr.P.C. is premature, as the stage of\n\ncognizance comes after the report is filed by\n\nthe police after completing the\n\ninvestigation. It is submitted that, after\n\nmaking compliance of the provisions of\n\nsections 154(1)\nand\n154(3)\nby the\n\ncomplainant, there are averments made in the\n\n5 (2017) 1 SCC 640\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ncomplaint. Learned counsel invites our\n\nattention to para 15 of the complaint filed\n\nbefore the Sessions Court and submits that\n\nthe complaint was filed in Deopur Police\n\nStation by respondent no.2. Thereafter, as\n\nthe cognizance was not taken, on 18th April,\n\n2016, the complaint was filed before the\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Dhule. The said\n\ncomplaint is filed after full-fledged\n\ncompliance of provisions of\nsections 154(1)\n\nand\n154(3)\nof the Cr.P.C. On the basis of the\n\ncomplaint filed by respondent no.2 i.e.,\n\noriginal complainant, the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Dhule had issued letter to the Police\n\nInspector of Deopur Police Station, Dhule to\n\nregister the crime if the offence is made\n\nout. It is submitted that, in the case of\n\nPriyanka Shrivastav (supra), the Supreme\n\nCourt was pleased to direct that, the\n\napplication under\nsection 156(3)\nof Cr.P.C.\n\nshould be supported by the affidavit. The\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nsaid directions have been issued only with a\n\nview that, if the averments in the\n\napplication are found false, the appropriate\n\nlegal action can be taken against the\n\ncomplainant/applicant. Non-filing of the\n\naffidavit in support of the application is an\n\nirregularity covered under\nsection 460\nof\n\nCr.P.C., which does not vitiate the\n\nproceedings. Even otherwise, the complainant\n\ncannot be directed to file the affidavit in\n\nsupport of his complaint application.\n\n24. It is submitted that, while deciding\n\nthe Writ Petition No. 3713 of 2015 in case of\n\nEnercon GMBH a Company V/s The State of\n\nMaharashtra, the judgment is relied upon by\n\nthe petitioners in Criminal Writ Petition\n\nNo.379/2017 and the point decided relates to\n\ncompliance of the provisions of\nsections\n\n154(1)\nand\n154(3)\nof Cr.P.C. and point of\n\nrequirement of affidavit along with the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\napplication under\nsection 156(3)\nof Cr.P.C.\n\nhad not been adjudicated in the said case. It\n\nis submitted that, it is true that,\n\nrespondent no.2 had filed Criminal Misc.\n\nApplication No.817/2016 before the Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate, however, the same was\n\nwithdrawn and to that effect respondent no.2\n\nhas disclosed the said fact in the complaint.\n\nIt is submitted that, there are avernments in\n\nthe complaint, which would attract the\n\noffences under the provisions of M.P.I.D.\n\nAct. The complainant/applicant has enclosed\n\nthe important evidence from which the\n\noffences under sections 406, 409, 417, 418,\n\n467, 468, 471,\n120(B)\nread with 34 of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\nand offence under the\n\nM.P.I.D. Act are prima facie evident. It is\n\nsubmitted that, it is true that, the\n\ncomplainant and his wife were convicted for\n\nthe offence punishable under\nsection 138\nof\n\nthe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nsentence till rising of the Court was\n\nordered. Infact the complainant and his wife\n\nhave deposited the amount in that case, but\n\nstill the financial institute continued the\n\nproceeding. The said fact cannot be a reason\n\nto say that, the complaint is malafide. It is\n\nsubmitted that, the allegations in respect of\n\ncancellation of appointment of the\n\ncomplainant in connection with \"Ladshakhiya\n\nWani Samaj Sanstha\" have no concern with the\n\npresent complaint. It is further submitted\n\nthat, the other factors stated by the\n\npetitioners against the complainant are the\n\nstatements disclosing the entire story or\n\nhappening, so also the circumstances. The\n\nsaid factors are being brought before this\n\nCourt only to cause prejudice against the\n\ncomplainant and the said facts have no\n\nconcern with the prayers in the Petition and\n\nthe impugned order.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n25. It is submitted that, the various\n\nsubmissions made by the petitioners about\n\ntheir non-involvement in the offence or\n\ninvolvement of others into the crime in\n\nquestion are their probable defence, however,\n\nthe same cannot be taken into consideration\n\nat this preliminary stage, where the order\n\npassed under\nsection 156(3)\nis under\n\nchallenge in Criminal Writ Petition. It is\n\nsubmitted that, the complaint application was\n\nfiled by the complainant on 10th April, 2016\n\nin Deopur Police Station, Dhule and on 18th\n\nApril, 2016, he had filed the application\n\nbefore Superintendent of Police, Dhule. So\n\nalso there is report of Deopur Police Station\n\ndated 2nd June, 2016, wherein it is stated in\n\ncolumn no.16 that \"izHkkjh vf/kdkjh ;kaph f'kQkjl\n\nLor% pkSd'kh dsyh vkgs-\" and from this it is\n\nevident that, the concerned Police Officer\n\nhad made the inquiry and recommended for\n\nregistration of the crime. In other words, it\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nis the satisfaction of the Police Officer,\n\nthat, the cognizable offence has been prima\n\nfacie made out. In these circumstances, it\n\nwas the bounden duty of the police to\n\nregister the crime and to investigate the\n\nsame. In support of abovesaid contentions,\n\nthe learned counsel placed reliance on the\n\nexposition of law by the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of Ramesh Karmari V/s State (N.C.T. of\n\nDelhi) and ors6. It is submitted that, on the\n\nbasis of the order dated 28th February, 2017,\n\nthe crime no. 14 of 2017 has been registered\n\nin Deopur Police Station, Dhule. The\n\ninvestigation has been commenced and\n\nthereafter some of the accused have been\n\narrested by the Police. The statements of\n\nsome of the witnesses must have been\n\nrecorded. What is done by the police would be\n\nnullified if the first information report is\n\nquashed at this stage, when the investigation\n\n6 AIR 2006 S.C. 1322\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nhas been substantially proceeded. If the\n\npolice found that, the first information\n\nreport is false, the police would take\n\nappropriate action against the complainant.\n\nIf the first information report is quashed\n\nthe serious crime would remain uninvestigated\n\neven after the registration of crime.\n\nTherefore, learned counsel appearing for\n\nrespondent no.2 submits that, the Petition\n\nmay be rejected.\n\n26. Learned A.P.P. appearing for the\n\nrespondent/State submits that, pursuant to\n\nthe directions issued by Additional Sessions\n\nJudge, Dhule vide order dated 28th February,\n\n2017, the F.I.R. bearing C.R. No. 14 of 2017\n\nis registered and pursuant to registration of\n\nsaid F.I.R., the investigation has been\n\ncarried out. He further submits that,\n\nMr.Bhupesh Devidas Patil, the Auditor has\n\nalso registered the F.I.R. bearing C.R.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nNo.92/2016 for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 420, 465, 466, 467, 471, 408 read\n\nwith 34 of the I.P. Code and under Sections 3\n\nand 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act. The said F.I.R.\n\nis registered on the basis of the enquiry\n\nmade by the Auditor and also the audit report\n\nand in pursuance to the directions issued by\n\nthe Divisional Joint Registrar. He further\n\nsubmits that, crime no.97/2013 is registered\n\nalleging illegalities committed by the\n\nPathpedi while purchasing the Mangal\n\nKaryalaya.\n\n27. We have heard the learned senior\n\ncounsel appearing for the petitioners,\n\nlearned A.P.P. appearing for the\n\nrespondent/State and the learned Advocate\n\nappearing for respondent no.2 at length. With\n\ntheir able assistance, we have carefully\n\nperused the pleadings in the Petition,\n\ngrounds taken therein, reply filed by\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nrespondent no.2 and affidavit in rejoinder\n\nand also the written notes of arguments\n\nsubmitted by the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the petitioners, learned counsel\n\nappearing for respondent no.2, and also\n\ninvestigation papers made available for\n\nperusal by the learned A.P.P. appearing for\n\nrespondent/State.\n\n28. An important point raised by the\n\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners that, respondent no.2 in the\n\npresent case did not file the affidavit duly\n\nsworn by him in support of Criminal Misc.\n\napplication filed by him before the Sessions\n\nCourt at Dhule in terms of dictum of Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India in the case of\n\nPriyanka Srivasta (supra) goes to the root\n\nof the matter. Admittedly, the Criminal M.A.\n\nNo. 22/2017 filed by respondent no.2 was not\n\nsupported by the affidavit sworn by him.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka\n\nSrivasta (supra) held thus :-\n\n\"27. Regard being had to the aforesaid\nenunciation of law, it needs to be\nreiterated that the learned Magistrate\nhas to remain vigilant with regard to\nthe allegations made and the nature of\nallegations and not to issue directions\nwithout proper application of mind. He\nhas also to bear in mind that sending\nthe matter would be conducive to justice\nand then he may pass the requisite\norder. The present is a case where the\naccused persons are serving in high\npositions in the Bank. We are absolutely\nconscious that the position does not\nmatter, for nobody is above the law.\nBut, the learned Magistrate should take\nnote of the allegations in entirety, the\ndate of incident and whether any\ncognizable case is remotely made out. It\nis also to be noted that when a borrower\nof the financial institution covered\nunder the SARFAESI Act, invokes the\njurisdiction under Section 156(3)\nCr.P.C. and also there is a separate\nprocedure under the Recovery of Debts\nDue to Banks and Financial Institutions\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nAct, 1993, an attitude of more care,\ncaution and circumspection has to be\nadhered to.\n\n28. Issuing a direction stating \"as per\nthe application\" to lodge an FIR creates\na very unhealthy situation in society\nand also reflects the erroneous approach\nof the learned Magistrate. It also\nencourages unscrupulous and unprincipled\nlitigants, like Respondent 3, namely,\nPrakash Kumar Bajaj, to take adventurous\nsteps with courts to bring the financial\ninstitutions on their knees. As the\nfactual exposition would reveal,\nRespondent 3 had prosecuted the earlier\nauthorities and after the matter is\ndealt with by the High Court in a writ\npetition recording a settlement, he does\nnot withdraw the criminal case and waits\nfor some kind of situation where he can\ntake vengeance as if he is the emperor\nof all he surveys. It is interesting to\nnote that during the tenure of\nAppellant 1, who is presently occupying\nthe position of Vice-President, neither\nwas the loan taken, nor was the default\nmade, nor was any action under the\n\nSARFAESI Act\ntaken. However, the action\nunder the\nSARFAESI Act\nwas taken on the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nsecond time at the instance of the\npresent Appellant 1. We are only stating\nabout the devilish design of Respondent\n3 to harass the appellants with the sole\nintent to avoid the payment of loan.\nWhen a citizen avails a loan from a\nfinancial institution, it is his\nobligation to pay back and not play\ntruant or for that matter play possum.\nAs we have noticed, he has been able to\ndo such adventurous acts as he has the\nembedded conviction that he will not be\ntaken to task because an application\nunder\nSection 156(3)\nCr.P.C. is a simple\napplication to the court for issue of a\ndirection to the investigating agency.\nWe have been apprised that a carbon copy\nof a document is filed to show the\ncompliance with\nSection 154(3)\n,\nindicating it has been sent to the\nSuperintendent of Police concerned.\n\n29. At this stage it is seemly to state\nthat power under\nSection 156(3)\nwarrants\napplication of judicial mind. A court of\nlaw is involved. It is not the police\ntaking steps at the stage of\nSection 154\n\nof the Code. A litigant at his own whim\ncannot invoke the authority of the\nMagistrate. A principled and really\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ngrieved citizen with clean hands must\nhave free access to invoke the said\npower. It protects the citizens but when\npervert litigations takes this route to\nharass their fellow citizens, efforts\nare to be made to scuttle and curb the\nsame.\n\n30. In our considered opinion, a stage\nhas come in this country where\nSection\n156(3)\nCr.P.C. applications are to be\nsupported by an affidavit duly sworn by\nthe applicant who seeks the invocation\nof the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.\nThat apart, in an appropriate case, the\nlearned Magistrate would be well advised\nto verify the truth and also can verify\nthe veracity of the allegations. This\naffidavit can make the applicant more\nresponsible. We are compelled to say so\nas such kind of applications are being\nfiled in a routine manner without taking\nany responsibility whatsoever only to\nharass certain persons. That apart, it\nbecomes more disturbing and alarming\nwhen one tries to pick up people who are\npassing orders under a statutory\nprovision which can be challenged under\nthe framework of the said Act or under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nIndia. But it cannot be done to take\nundue advantage in a criminal court as\nif somebody is determined to settle the\nscores.\n\n31. We have already indicated that there\nhas to be prior applications under\n\nSections 154(1)\nand\n154(3)\nwhile filing\na petition under\nSection 156(3)\n. Both\nthe aspects should be clearly spelt out\nin the application and necessary\ndocuments to that effect shall be filed.\nThe warrant for giving a direction that\nan application under\nSection 156(3)\nbe\nsupported by an affidavit is so that the\nperson making the application should be\nconscious and also endeavour to see that\nno false affidavit is made. It is\nbecause once an affidavit is found to be\nfalse, he will be liable for prosecution\nin accordance with law. This will deter\nhim to casually invoke the authority of\nthe Magistrate under\nSection 156(3)\n.\nThat apart, we have already stated that\nthe veracity of the same can also be\nverified by the learned Magistrate,\nregard being had to the nature of\nallegations of the case. We are\ncompelled to say so as a number of cases\npertaining to fiscal sphere, matrimonial\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ndispute/family disputes, commercial\noffences, medical negligence cases,\ncorruption cases and the cases where\nthere is abnormal delay/laches in\ninitiating criminal prosecution, as are\nillustrated in Lalita Kumari7 are being\nfiled. That apart, the learned\nMagistrate would also be aware of the\ndelay in lodging of the FIR.\"\n\n(Underlines added)\n\nTherefore, it follows from the\n\nauthoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Priyanka\n\nSrivasta (supra) that, the application under\n\nsection 156 (3)\nof Cr.P.C. should be\n\nsupported by affidavit duly sworn by the\n\napplicant, who seeks invocation of\n\njurisdiction of the Magistrate.

It is observed in\n\nthe said judgment that, the Court is\n\ncompelled to say so as such kind of\n\napplications are being filed in a routine\n\nmanner without taking any responsibility\n\nwhatsoever only to harass certain persons.\n\nThat apart, it becomes more disturbing and\n\nalarming when one tries to pick up people who\n\nare passing orders under a statutory\n\nprovision which can be challenged under the\n\nframework of the said Act or under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India. But it\n\ncannot be done to take undue advantage in a\n\ncriminal court as if somebody is determined\n\nto settle the scores.\n\n29. As already observed, in the present\n\ncase, respondent no.2 did not support the\n\napplication by affidavit duly sworn by\n\nhim. The law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Priyanka Srivasta\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n(supra) is binding on all subordinate Courts\n\nexercising jurisdiction within their local\n\nlimits and situate within the territory of\n\nIndia, as has been provided under\nArticle 142\n\nof the Constitution of India. The judgment in\n\nthe case of Priyanka Srivasta (supra) was\n\ncirculated to all the Magistrates, Sessions\n\nJudges and High Courts. Therefore, the\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge, who passed the\n\nimpugned order, was bound by the dictum of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nPriyanka Srivasta (supra). It is unfortunate\n\nthat, the learned Judge did not follow the\n\ndictum of Hon'ble Supreme Court and proceeded\n\nto pass the impugned order on the basis of\n\nthe application which was not supported by\n\nthe affidavit sworn by respondent no.2.\n\n30. The Bombay High Court at Principal\n\nSeat at Mumbai, in the case of Syed Anwar\n\nAhmed (supra) had occasion to consider the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nfact situation of filing the application\n\nunder\nsection 156(3)\nof Cr.P.C. not supported\n\nby the affidavit sworn by the complainant.\n\nThe Division Bench has in extenso made\n\nreference to the judgment of the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Priyanka Srivasta in\n\npara 19 and also to other judgments of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in para nos. 17, 18, 20,\n\n21, and in paras 22 to 25 held thus :-\n\n\"17. As far as power under Sub-section (3)\nof\nSection 156\nof the Cr.P.C. is\nconcerned, there are various decisions of\nthe Apex Court and this Court. In the case\nof Anil Kumar and Others. v. M.K. Aiyappa\nand Another MANU/SC/1002/2013 : (2013) 10\nSCC, the Apex Court considered the scope\nof powers under Sub-section (3) of Section\n\n156. What is material is paragraph 11 of\nthe said decision which reads thus:-\n\n\"11. The scope of\nSection 156(3)\nCr.P.C.\ncame up for consideration before this\nCourt in several cases. This Court in\nMaksud Saiyed Case examined the\nrequirement of the application of mind\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nby the Magistrate before exercising\njurisdiction under\nSection 156(3)\nand\nheld that where jurisdiction is\nexercised on a complaint filed in terms\nof\nSection 156(3)\nor\nSection 200\n\nCr.P.C., the Magistrate is required to\napply his mind, in such a case, the\nSpecial Judge/Magistrate cannot refer\nthe matter under\nSection 156(3)\nagainst\na public servant without a valid\nsanction order. The application of mind\nby the Magistrate should be reflected in\nthe order. The mere statement that he\nhas gone through the complaint,\ndocuments and heard the complainant, as\nsuch, as reflected in the order, will\nnot be sufficient. After going through\nthe complaint, documents and hearing the\ncomplainant, what weighed with the\nMagistrate to order investigation under\n\nSection 156(3)\nCr.P.C., should be\nreflected in the order, though a\ndetailed expression of his views is\nneither required nor warranted. We have\nalready extracted the order passed by\nthe learned Special Judge which, in our\nview, has stated no reasons for ordering\ninvestigation.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n18. Thus, the Apex Court held that when\nthe learned Magistrate orders\ninvestigation under Sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 156\nwhat weighed with the learned\nMagistrate to order investigation should\nbe reflected from his order, though a\ndetailed expression of his views is not\nwarranted. While passing an order under\nSub-section (3) of\nSection 156\nof Cr.P.C,\nsurely some reasons are required to be\nrecorded after going through the Complaint\nas well as the documents produced with the\ncomplaint and after hearing the\ncomplainant. The reasons should be\nsufficient to indicate that the learned\nMagistrate had applied his mind.\n\n20. The relevant decisions of the Apex\nCourt including the decision in the case\nof Lalita Kumari, were considered by\nanother Division Bench to which one of us\n(Anuja Prabhudessai, J.) is a member.\nIn\nparagraph No. 15 of the decision dated\n30th March, 2015 in Writ Petition No. 4775\nof 2014 (\nMr. Pandharinath Narayan Patil &\nOrs. v. The State of Maharashtra and Anr.\n)\nthe Division Bench held thus:-\n\n\"15. It is thus well settled that the\npowers under\nsection 156(3)\nof the Code\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ncannot be exercised mechanically but are\nrequired to be exercised judiciously.\nThe magistrate is not required to embark\nupon an in-depth roving enquiry as to\nthe reliability or genuineness of the\nallegations, nonetheless, he has to\narrive at a conclusion that the\napplication discloses necessary\ningredients of the offence for which\ninvestigation is intended to be ordered.\nFurthermore, the reasons for arriving at\nsuch conclusion should be clearly\nreflected in the order.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n21. After considering the decision of the\nApex Court in the case of\nLalita Kumari v.\nState of U.P.\n, the Apex Court in the case\nof Priyanka, reminded the learned\nMagistrates that the Court of Law is\ninvolved when power under Sub-section (3)\nof\nSection 156\nis invoked and it is not\nthe case of the Police taking steps as per\n\nSection 154\nof the said Code. The Apex\nCourt has reminded the learned Magistrates\nthat there is a difference between the\nCourt of Law exercising the power under\nSub-section (3) of\nSection 156\nand the\nPolice acting under\nSection 154\n.\nTherefore, only on the ground that the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nallegations made in the Complaint\nconstitute a cognizable offence, an order\nunder Sub-section (3) of\nSection 156\n\ncannot be mechanically passed. The Apex\nCourt observed that the power under\n\nSection 156(3)\nwarrants application of\njudicial mind. The mandate of law\nlaid\ndown in\nthe case of Lalita Kumari is only\nagainst the Police in the context of\nmandatory provisions of Sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 154\nof Cr.P.C. From paragraph 29\nof the decision in the case of Priyanka,\nit is apparent that even in a case where\nthe Complaint is seeking an action under\n\nSection 156(1)\ndiscloses commission of a\ncognizable offence, it is not necessary\nthat in every such case the learned\nMagistrate should pass an order under Sub-\nsection (3) of\nSection 156\n. It is\nultimately the discretion of the learned\nMagistrate which is to be exercised after\nconsidering several factors. What we\nemphasis even at the risk of repetition is\nthat only because the Complaint filed\nseeking an action under Sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 156\ndiscloses commission of a\ncognizable offence, the learned Magistrate\nshould not mechanically the exercise power\nwithout application of judicial mind.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n22. The Apex court has laid emphasis on\nthe complainant supporting his case under\nSub-section (3) of\nSection 156\nof the Code\nby filing an affidavit. As observed in\nparagraph No. 31 of the decision, mere\nfiling of affidavit is not sufficient. In\na given case, the learned Magistrate will\nbe well advised to verify the truth and\nveracity of the allegation. Advantages of\nfiling of such affidavit are also\nmentioned in\nthe said decision\nof the Apex\nCourt.\n\n23. Filing of an affidavit is also not\nempty formality. The manner in which\naffidavit is to be filed is prescribed in\nChapter VII of the Criminal Manual\npublished by this Court in paragraph Nos.\n1 to 5, 7 and 8:-\n\n\"1. (1) The heading of every affidavit\nto be used in a Court of Justice shall\nbe \"in the Court of....at..... \".\n\nnaming such Court.\n\n(2) If there be a case pending in\nCourt, the affidavit in support of, or\nopposition to, an application\nrespecting it, must also begin with the\nheading \"In the matter of the case\nof..... \" in the case.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n(3) If there be no case pending in\nCourt heading shall be: In the matter\nof the application of.\n\n2.

Unless it is otherwise provided, an\naffidavit may be made by any person\nhaving knowledge of the facts deposed\nto.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n5. (1) Every affidavit should clearly\nspecify what portion of the statement\nis made on the declarant's knowledge\nand what portion of the statement is\nmade on his information or belief.\n\n2) When a particular portion is not\nwithin the declarant's own knowledge\nbut it is stated from information\nobtained from others, the declarant\nmust use the expression \"I am informed\"\n\nand if it is made on belief should add\n\"I verily believe it to be true.\" He\nmust also state the source or ground of\nthe information or belief, and give the\nname and address of, and sufficiently\ndescribed for the purpose of\nidentification, the person or persons\nfrom whom he had received such\ninformation.\n\n(3) When the statement rests on facts\ndisclosed in documents or copies of\ndocuments procured from any Court or\nother person, the declarant shall state\nthe source from which they were\nprocured and his information, or\nbelief, as to the truth of the facts\ndisclosed in such documents.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n7. All erasures, errors,\ninterlineations, etc, in the affidavit\nshall be legibly initialed and dated by\nthe declarant.\n\n8. (1) The Officer authorised in this\nbehalf, shall, before administering the\noath ask the declarant if he has read\nthe affidavit and understood the\ncontents thereof, and if the latter\nstates that he has not read it, or\nappears not to understand fully, the\ncontents thereof, or appears to be\nblind, illiterate or ignorant of the\nlanguage in which it is written, the\nOfficer administering the oath shall\nread and explain or cause some other\ncompetent person to read and explain in\nhis presence the affidavit to the\ndeclarant in the language which both\nthe declarant and the Officer\nadministering the oath understood.\n\n(2) When an affidavit is read,\ntranslated or explained as herein\nprovided the Officer administering the\noath shall certify in writing at the\nfoot of the affidavit that it has been\nso read, translated or explained in his\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\npresence and that the declarant\nunderstood the same at the time of\nmaking the affidavit and made his\nsignature or finger impression in the\npresence of the Officer.\"\n\n24. Thus, the requirement of law is that\nevery affidavit should clearly specify\nwhat portion of the statement is made on\ndeclarant's personal knowledge and what\nportion of the statement is made on his\ninformation or belief. When a particular\nstatement is made on the basis of\ninformation and belief, the affidavit must\nstate that the declarant believes the said\nstatement to be true. Particulars of the\nsource or ground of information or belief\nas provided in clause (2) of paragraph No.\n5 of the Chapter VII of the Criminal\nManual are required to be disclosed. The\nmanner in which an affidavit should be\nexecuted is also\nlaid down in\nparagraph\nNo. 8 of Chapter VII. An affidavit filed\nwithout substantially complying with the\nrequirements of Chapter VII cannot be said\nto be an affidavit filed in compliance\nwith the directions issued by the Apex\nCourt in the case of Priyanka Srivastava.\nAs stated in\nthe said decision\n, the object\nof filing an affidavit is to ensure that\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nthe complainant must face consequences, if\nhis statements made therein are found to\nbe false. To achieve the object of filing\nan affidavit, it must substantially comply\nwith the requirements specified in Chapter\nVII of the Criminal Manual.\n\n25.

In the said case there was an\norder passed under Sub-Section (3) of\n\nSection 156\nof Cr.PC on the basis of which\nFIR was registered. Writ Petitions were\nfiled by the appellants before the Apex\nCourt for quashing FIR. The Writ Petitions\nwere dismissed by the High Court by\nholding the same as premature. The order\npassed by the learned Magistrate under\nSub-section (3) of Section 156 of Cr.P.C.\n\nis quoted in paragraph 12 which records\nreasons in brief. The order shows that the\nlearned Magistrate had applied his mind to\nthe contents of the complaint and came to\nthe conclusion that the complaint\ndisclosed commission of cognizable\noffence. The order was not made only on\nthis ground. The learned Magistrate\nrecorded a satisfaction that considering\nthe nature of the offence, it needs to be\nsent to the police for investigation under\nSub-Section (3) of\nSection 156\n. The order\nrecords that he has even perused the\ndocuments filed along with the complaint.\nTherefore, this was not a case where a\nsingle line order was passed ordering\ninvestigation. This was a case where the\norder under Sub-Section (3) of\nSection 156\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ndisclosed that the learned Magistrate had\napplied his mind to the complaint. It is\nin the facts of the case before the Apex\nCourt that the observations were made in\nparagraph 27 that the Petitions filed\nbefore the High Court were filed at\npremature stage. We are of the view, if\nthe order made under Sub-Section (3) of\n\nSection 156\nis illegal, the FIR registered\non the basis of the order can be quashed\nto avoid abuse of process of law.\"\n\n33. It is contended by the petitioners\n\nthat, respondent no.2 is habitual litigant,\n\nvarious proceedings are pending against\n\nrespondent no.2. He is rival of Shinkar\n\nfamily. In the year 2001, he and his wife\n\navailed the loan facility from the Pathpedi\n\nborrowed the loan. Said amount, which was\n\nborrowed as loan, was not paid, which\n\nresulted into filing the proceedings under\n\nsection 101\nof the Maharashtra Co-operative\n\nSocieties Act, 1960 (for short\nM.C.S.

Where the allegations made in the FIR\nor complaint are so absurd and\ninherently improbable on the basis of\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nwhich no prudent person can ever reach\na just conclusion that there is\nsufficient ground for proceeding\nagainst the accused.\n\n6. Where there is an express legal bar\nengrafted in any of the provisions of\nthe Code or the concerned Act (under\nwhich a criminal proceeding is\ninstituted) to the institution and\ncontinuance of the proceedings and/or\nwhere there is a specific provision in\nthe Code or the concerned Act,\nproviding efficacious redress for the\ngrievance of the aggrieved party.\n\n7.

In the light of the aforesaid\n\ndiscussion, the contention of the petitioners\n\nthat, the criminal proceedings are manifestly\n\nattended with malafide and maliciously with\n\nulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the\n\naccused deserves acceptance keeping in view\n\nthe category no.7 i.e. where a criminal\n\nproceeding is manifestly attended with mala\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nfide and/or where the proceeding is\n\nmaliciously instituted with an ulterior\n\nmotive for wreaking vengeance on the accused\n\nand with a view to spite him due to private\n\nand personal grudge.\n\n36. Respondent no.2 in his application\n\nmade allegation in respect of purchase of\n\nMangal Karyalaya. However, in that respect\n\nalready crime No. 97 of 2013 came to be\n\nregistered. Therefore, in view of the\n\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nT.T. Antony (supra), on the same set of\n\nallegation, crime no. 14/2017 is not\n\nmaintainable.\n\n37. Pursuant to the directions issued by\n\nthe Divisional Joint Registrar, Co-operative\n\nSocieties to the District Social Auditor\n\nClass-I, the Auditor has lodged the complaint\n\nwith Deopur Police Station, Dhule and on the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nbasis of the said complaint, on 29th\n\nSeptember, 2016 the crime No.92/2016 for the\n\noffences punishable under Sections 420, 465,\n\n466, 467, 471 and 342 of the IP Code as well\n\nas sections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act has\n\nbeen registered. The said complaint submitted\n\nby the Auditor is in respect of very same\n\nPathpedi. In the said crime, one of\n\npetitioners is already made accused. Since\n\nthe allegations in the said first information\n\nreport relates to the affairs of Dadasaheb\n\nWaman Vishnu Shinkar Nagari Sahakari Pathpedi\n\nand also about the illegalities and\n\nirregularities committed while conducting the\n\naffairs of the society and at the time of\n\ndisbursement of loan etc., and therefore, it\n\nwas not necessary to register the separate\n\noffence. In the crime No.92/2016 registered\n\nwith Deopur Police Station, Dhule for the\n\noffences punishable under Sections 420, 465,\n\n466, 467, 471 and 342 of the IP Code as well\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nas sections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act, the\n\nInvestigating Officer is at liberty to\n\ninvestigate about the allegations made even\n\nagainst the present petitioners so as to find\n\nout their role. An investigation is an\n\nexclusive domain of the Investigating Officer\n\nand the Investigating officer would be at\n\nliberty to investigate even about the\n\ninvolvement of present petitioners, and there\n\ncannot be any impediment for such\n\ninvestigation. Even the statement of present\n\nrespondent no.2 can also be recorded in the\n\nsaid crime by the Investigating officer. It\n\nappears that, since the Special Auditor did\n\nnot take any steps to file the complaint with\n\nPolice Station inspite of the directions by\n\nthe Superior Officer about the alleged\n\nillegalities and irregularities committed by\n\nthe Directors, employees and borrowers etc.,\n\nincluding the petitioners to register the\n\nfirst information report on the basis of such\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ncomplaint, respondent no.2 presented the\n\ncomplaint before the Magistrate and the\n\ncomplaint was subsequently withdrawn and\n\nthereafter the Criminal Misc. Application No.\n\n22/2017, was presented before the Court of\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge at Dhule. Since as\n\nalready observed the crime No. 92/2016 is\n\nalready registered on the basis of the\n\ncomplaint filed by the Special Auditor on\n\n20th August, 2016, the allegations as against\n\nthe petitioners made in the present F.I.R.\n\ni.e. Crime No.14/2017 can also be gone into\n\nin the said first information report. There\n\nis no need of further investigation of said\n\nF.I.R., which is registered pursuant to\n\ndirections issued by the Additional Sessions\n\nJudge, Dhule.\n\n38. There is also another reason to\n\ncause interference in the impugned order\n\ndirecting registration of the first\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ninformation report. In the impugned order,\n\nthe cryptic reasons are assigned by the\n\nconcerned Court without assigning any single\n\nreason how the provisions of sections 3 and 4\n\nof the M.P.I.D. Act are attracted. While\n\npassing the impugned order, learned Judge did\n\nnot even consider the fact that, Mohammad\n\nAbdul Arif was working as Divisional Joint\n\nRegistrar, Co-operative Societies as public\n\nservant and therefore, to prosecute him,\n\nvalid sanction is necessary. However, after\n\nregistration of F.I.R. pursuant to the\n\ndirections issued by the Additional Sessions\n\nJudge, Dhule, very same learned Judge while\n\nentertaining an application and granting\n\nanticipatory bail to Mohammad Abdul Arif, who\n\nwas working as Divisional Joint Registrar\n\nmade observation that, there was no valid\n\nsanction to prosecute him. Therefore, there\n\nwas no proper application of mind by the\n\nlearned Judge and as a result, by cryptic\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nreasons, the impugned order is passed and on\n\nthe basis of the said order, the first\n\ninformation report no.14/2017 with Deopur\n\nPolice Station for the offence punishable\n\nunder sections 406, 409, 417, 418, 420, 467,\n\n468, 471, 120-B and\nof I.P. Code and under\n\nsections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act is\n\nregistered.\n\n39. Though the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor respondent no.2 has placed reliance on\n\nthe judgment in the case of HDFC Securities\n\nLimited, in the facts of that case, the issue\n\nof filing the affidavit in support of\n\napplication by the applicant/complainant\n\ntherein was not involved.\nIn the present\n\ncase, as already observed, in the light of\n\nmandate of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nPriyanka Srivasta (supra) and the judgment of\n\nthe Bombay High Court at Principal Seat in\n\nthe case of\nSyed Anwar Ahmed\n(supra), it was\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nincumbent upon the learned Judge, who passed\n\nthe impugned order, to seek compliance from\n\nrespondent no.2 to file the affidavit in\n\nsupport of Criminal Misc. Application. In the\n\nfacts of the present case, as already\n\nobserved the order passed by Additional\n\nSessions Judge is cryptic and without\n\nassigning any valid reasons for invoking\n\nprovisions of sections 3 and 4 of the\n\nM.P.I.D. Act. Therefore, the\nratio\nlaid down\n\nin\nthe case of HDFC Securities Limited cannot\n\nbe made applicable in the facts of the\n\npresent case, when there is no affidavit\n\nsworn by respondent no.2 in support of\n\naverments in the Misc. Application and order\n\nsuffers from non-application of mind.\n\nHowever, we make it clear that, the\n\nallegations made against the petitioners\n\ncannot go unattended and the Investigating\n\nOfficer making investigation in Crime\n\nNo.92/2016 will be at liberty to cause the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ninvestigation even in respect of the present\n\npetitioners also, since the said first\n\ninformation report is lodged on the basis of\n\nthe complaint filed by the Special Auditor\n\nwith Deopur Police Station, Dhule. We further\n\nmake it clear that, there is no impediment to\n\nthe Investigating Officer to cause the\n\ninvestigation keeping in view the allegations\n\nin the first information report registered on\n\nthe basis of complaint lodged by the Special\n\nAuditor even against the petitioners, even\n\nthough there are certain directions by the\n\nMinister and in turn the Special Auditor\n\nmentioned in that respect that, no offence\n\nshould be registered against Devidas Waman\n\nShinkar. As already observed, the\n\ninvestigation is an exclusive domain of the\n\nInvestigating Officer and the Investigating\n\nOfficer is at liberty to add any\n\nperson/persons as an accused in ongoing\n\ninvestigation keeping in view the allegations\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nin the first information report, and can also\n\ncause the further investigation. In\n\nsubstance, the allegations made in the First\n\nInformation Report no. 14/2017 can be taken\n\ncare of in ongoing investigation in crime\n\nno.92/2016 for the offence punishable under\n\nSections 420, 465, 466, 467, 471, 406 read\n\nwith\nsection 34\nof I.P. Code and under\n\nSections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act, and the\n\nInvestigating Officer can record the\n\nstatement of respondent no.2.\n\n40. The contention of the learned\n\ncounsel appearing for respondent no.2 that,\n\nthe revision as against the impugned order\n\npassed by the Additional Sessions Judge is\n\nmaintainable, and therefore, the present\n\nPetition under\nArticle 226\nof the\n\nConstitution of India read with\nsection 482\n\nof the Cr.P.C. may not be entertained, cannot\n\nbe accepted. It needs to be emphasized that\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nthe scope of exercise of jurisdiction of\n\nsection 482\nof Cr.P.C. is explained in\n\ngreater details by the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of State of Haryana V/s Bhajan Lal and\n\nvarious pronouncement of the Supreme Court in\n\nrecent past. The Supreme Court in the case of\n\nPrabhu Chawla Vs. State of Rajasthan and Anr.\n\nin Criminal Appeal No. 842 of 2016 with\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 844 of 2016, decided on\n\n5th September, 2016, in para 3 held thus :\n\n3. While considering all these\nmatters at the SLP stage, on\n05.07.2013, a Division Bench\nfound the impugned order of the\nHigh Court to be against the law\nstated in\nDhariwal Tobacco\nProducts Ltd. v. State of\nMaharashtra10\n.\nIn that case the\nDivision Bench concurred with the\nproposition of law that\navailability of alternative\nremedy of criminal revision under\nSection 397 Cr.P.C. by itself\n\n10 [2009] 2 SCC 370\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\ncannot be a good ground to\ndismiss an application under\nSection 482 of Cr.P.C. But it\nnoticed that a later Division\nBench judgment of this Court in\nthe case of Mohit alias Sonu v.\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh11\napparently held to the contrary\nthat when an order under assail\nis not interlocutory in nature\nand is amenable to the revisional\njurisdiction of the High Court\nthen there should be a bar in\ninvoking the inherent\njurisdiction of the High Court.\n\nIn view of such conflict, these\ncases were directed to be placed\nbefore the Hon'ble Chief Justice\nfor reference to a larger Bench\nand that is how the matters are\nbefore this Bench for resolving\nthe conflict.\n\n41. The Supreme Court after detailed\n\ndiscussion in paras 4 and 5; in para 6 of\nthe\n\nsaid judgment\nheld thus:\n\n11 [2013] 7 SCC 789\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\n6. In our considered view any\nattempt to explain the law\nfurther as regards the issue\nrelating to inherent power of\nHigh Court under\nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. is unwarranted. We would\nsimply reiterate that Section\n482 begins with a non-obstante\nclause to state: \"Nothing in\nthis Code shall be deemed to\nlimit or affect the inherent\npowers of the High Court to make\nsuch orders as may be necessary\nto give effect to any order\nunder this Code, or to prevent\nabuse of the process of any\nCourt or otherwise to secure the\nends of justice.\" A fortiori,\nthere can be no total ban on the\nexercise of such wholesome\njurisdiction where, in the words\nof Krishna Iyer, J. \"abuse of\nthe process of the Court or\nother extraordinary situation\nexcites the court's\njurisdiction. The limitation is\nself-restraint, nothing more.\"\n\nWe venture to add a further\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nreason in support. Since\nSection\nCr.P.C. is attracted against\nall orders other than\ninterlocutory, a contrary view\nwould limit the availability of\ninherent powers under\nSection\nCr.P.C. only to petty\ninterlocutory orders! A\nsituation wholly unwarranted and\nundesirable.\n\n42. It clearly emerges that, the Supreme\n\nCourt approved the law\nlaid down in\nthe case\n\nof Dhariwal Tobacco Products Ltd. and ors.\n\nVs. State of Maharashtra and another12 and\n\nultimately held that, the availability of\n\nalternative remedy of criminal revision under\n\nSection 397\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nby itself cannot be a good ground to dismiss\n\nan application under\nSection 482\nof the Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure.\nThe judgment in the\n\ncase of\nDhariwal Tobacco Products Ltd.\n\n[supra] is holding the field, since the date\n\n12 [2009] 2 SCC 370\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\nof its pronouncement of\nthe said judgment\nin\n\nthe year 2009.\n\n43. It is further not necessary to\n\nelaborate the reasons. Suffice it to say\n\nthat, in the light of discussion in the\n\nforegoing paragraphs, we are of the\n\nconsidered view that, the impugned order\n\npassed by the Additional Sessions Judge,\n\nDhule, deserves to be quashed and\n\nconsequently the F.I.R. bearing C.R. No. 14\n\nof 2017 registered on the basis of the same\n\nalso deserves to be quashed.\n\n44. Accordingly, the impugned order\n\ndated 28th February, 2017 passed by the\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Dhule in Criminal\n\nMisc. Application No. 22/2017 is quashed and\n\nset aside. Consequently, the first\n\ninformation report i.e. Crime No. 14/2017\n\nregistered with Deopur Police Station for the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n379.17WP.odt+\noffence punishable under sections 406, 409,\n\n417, 418, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B and\nof\n\nthe I.P. Code and under sections 3 and 4 of\n\nthe M.P.I.D. Act on the basis of the said\n\norder is also quashed. Rule made absolute on\n\nabove terms.\n\nAn observations made hereinbefore on\n\nthe merits of the allegations in the first\n\ninformation report No. 14/2017 are prima\n\nfacie in nature and cannot be construed as an\n\nimpediment to the Investigating Officer, who\n\nis investigating into the F.I.R. no.92/2016\n\nregistered with Deopur Police Station, Dhule\n\nto proceed with the investigation in\n\naccordance with law.
