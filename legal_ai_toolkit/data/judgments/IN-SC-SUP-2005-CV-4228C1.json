What is the nature of the function of the Chief Justice or\nhis designate under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n1996 is the question that is posed before us. The three judges bench\ndecision in Konkan Rly.\nCorpn. Ltd. Vs. Mehul Construction Co.\n\n[(2000) 7 SCC 201] as approved by the Constitution Bench in Konkan\nRailway Corpn. Ltd. & anr. Vs. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.\n[(2002) 2 SCC 388] has taken the view that it is purely an\nadministrative function, that it is neither judicial nor quasi-judicial and\nthe Chief Justice or his nominee performing the function under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act, cannot decide any contentious issue between the\nparties. The correctness of the said view is questioned in these appeals.\n\n2. Arbitration in India was earlier governed by the Indian\nArbitration Act, 1859 with limited application and the Second Schedule\nto\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908. Then came the\nArbitration Act,\n.\nSection 8\nof that Act conferred power on the Court to appoint an\narbitrator on an application made in that behalf.\nSection 20\nconferred a\nwider jurisdiction on the Court for directing the filing of the arbitration\nagreement and the appointment of an arbitrator.\nSection 21\nconferred a\npower on the Court in a pending suit, on the agreement of parties, to\nrefer the differences between them for arbitration in terms of the Act.\n\nThe Act\nprovided for the filing of the award in court, for the making of\na motion by either of the parties to make the award a rule of court, a\nright to have the award set aside on the grounds specified in the Act\nand for an appeal against the decision on such a motion.\nThis Act\nwas\nreplaced by the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nwhich, by virtue\nof\nSection 85\n, repealed the earlier enactment.\n\n3.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(hereinafter\nreferred to as 'the Act') was intended to comprehensively cover\ninternational and commercial arbitrations and conciliations as also\ndomestic arbitrations and conciliations. It envisages the making of an\narbitral procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the\nneeds of the concerned arbitration and for other matters set out in the\nobjects and reasons for the Bill.\nThe Act\nwas intended to be one to\nconsolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitrations,\ninternational commercial arbitrations and enforcement of foreign\narbitral awards, as also to define the law relating to conciliation and for\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The preamble\nindicates that since the United Nations Commission on International\nTrade Law (UNCITRAL) has adopted a Model Law for International\nCommercial Arbitration and the General Assembly of the United\nNations has recommended that all countries give due consideration to\nthe Model Law and whereas the Model Law and the Rules make\nsignificant contribution to the establishment of a unified legal\nframework for a fair and efficient settlement of disputes arising in\ninternational commercial relations and since it was expedient to make a\nlaw respecting arbitration and conciliation taking into account the\nModel Law and the Rules, the enactment was being brought forward.\n\nThe Act\nreplaces the procedure\nlaid down in\n\nSections 8\nand\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1940.\nPart I of the Act\ndeals with arbitration. It\ncontains\nSections 2\nto\n. Part II deals with enforcement of certain\nforeign awards, and Part III deals with conciliation and Part IV contains\nsupplementary provisions. In this case, we are not concerned with Part\nIII, and Parts II and IV have only incidental relevance. We are\nconcerned with the provisions in Part I dealing with arbitration.\n\n4.\nSection 7\nof the Act read with\nSection 2 (b)\ndefines an\narbitration agreement.\nSection 2(h)\ndefines 'party' to mean a party to\nan arbitration agreement.\nSection 4\ndeals with waiver of objections on\nthe part of the party who has proceeded with an arbitration, without\nstating his objections referred to in the section, without undue delay.\n\nSection 5\nindicates the extent of judicial intervention. It says that\nnotwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being\nin force, in matters governed by Part I, no judicial authority shall\nintervene except where so provided in Part I. The expression 'judicial\nauthority' is not defined. So, it has to be understood as taking in the\ncourts or any other judicial fora.\nSection 7\ndefines an arbitration\nagreement and insists that it must be in writing and also explains when\nan arbitration agreement could be said to be in writing.\nSection 8\n\nconfers power on a judicial authority before whom an action is brought\nin a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement, to refer the\ndispute to arbitration, if a party applies for the same.\nSection 9\ndeals\nwith the power of the Court to pass interim orders and the power to\ngive interim protection in appropriate cases. It gives a right to a party,\nbefore or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of\nthe arbitral arbitral award but before its enforcement in terms of\nSection\nof the Act, to apply to a court for any one of the orders specified\ntherein. Chapter III of Part I deals with composition of arbitral\ntribunals.\nSection 10\ngives freedom to the parties to determine the\nnumber of arbitrators but imposes a restriction that it shall not be an\neven number. Then comes\nSection 11\nwith which we are really\nconcerned in these appeals.\n\n5. The marginal heading of\nSection 11\nis 'Appointment of\narbitrators'. Sub-Section (1) indicates that a person of any nationality\nmay be an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Under\nsub-Section (2), subject to sub-Section (6),the parties are free to agree\non a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. Under sub-\nSection (3), failing any agreement in terms of sub-Section (2), in an\narbitration with three arbitrators, each party could appoint one\narbitrator, and the two arbitrators so appointed, could appoint the third\narbitrator, who would act as the presiding arbitrator. Under sub-\nSection (4), the Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by\nhim could make the appointment, in a case where sub-Section (3) has\napplication and where either the party or parties had failed to nominate\ntheir arbitrator or arbitrators or the two nominated arbitrators had failed\nto agree on the presiding arbitrator. In the case of a sole arbitrator, sub-\nSection (5) provides for the Chief Justice or any person or institution\ndesignated by him, appointing an arbitrator on a request being made by\none of the parties, on fulfilment of the conditions laid down therein.\nThen comes sub-Section (6), which may be quoted hereunder with\nadvantage:\n\n\"(6) Where, under an appointment procedure\nagreed upon by the parties,-\n\n(a) a party fails to act as required under\nthat procedure; or\n\n(b) the parties, or the two appointed\narbitrators, fail to reach an agreement\nexpected of them under that\nprocedure; or\n\n(c) a person, including an institution, fails\nto perform any function entrusted to\nhim or it under that procedure,\n\na party may request the Chief Justice or any person\nor institution designated by him to take the\nnecessary measure, unless the agreement on the\nappointment procedure provides other means for\nsecuring the appointment.\"\n\nSub-Section (7) gives a finality to the decision rendered by the Chief\nJustice or the person or institution designated by him when moved\nunder sub-Section (4), or sub-Section (5), or sub-Section (6) of Section\n\n11. Sub-Section (8) enjoins the Chief Justice or the person or\ninstitution designated by him to keep in mind the qualifications\nrequired for an arbitrator by the agreement of the parties, and other\nconsiderations as are likely to secure the appointment of an\nindependent and impartial arbitrator. Sub-Section (9) deals with the\npower of the Chief Justice of India or a person or institution designated\nby him to appoint the sole or the third arbitrator in an international\ncommercial arbitration. Sub-Section (10) deals with Chief Justice's\npower to make a scheme for dealing with matters entrusted to him by\nsub-Section (4) or sub-Section (5) or sub-Section (6) of\nSection 11\n.\nSub-Section (11) deals with the respective jurisdiction of Chief Justices\nof different High Courts who are approached with requests regarding\nthe same dispute and specifies as to who should entertain such a\nrequest. Sub-\nSection 12\nclause (a) clarifies that in relation to\ninternational arbitration, the reference in the relevant sub-sections to\nthe 'Chief Justice' would mean the 'Chief Justice of India'. Clause (b)\nindicates that otherwise the expression 'Chief Justice' shall be\nconstrued as a reference to the Chief Justice of the High Court within\nwhose local limits the principal Court is situated. 'Court' is defined\nunder\nSection 2(e)\nas the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in\na district.\n\n6.\nSection 12\nsets out the grounds of challenge to the person\nappointed as arbitrator and the duty of an arbitrator appointed, to\ndisclose any disqualification he may have. Sub-Section (3) of\nSection\ngives a right to the parties to challenge an arbitrator.\nSection 13\nlays\ndown the procedure for such a challenge.\nSection 14\ntakes care of the\nfailure of or impossibility for an arbitrator to act and\nSection 15\ndeals\nwith the termination of the mandate of the arbitrator and the\nsubstitution of another arbitrator. Chapter IV deals with the jurisdiction\nof arbitral tribunals.\nSection 16\ndeals with the competence of an\narbitral tribunal, to rule on its jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal may\nrule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objection with\nrespect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. A\nperson aggrieved by the rejection of his objection by the tribunal on its\njurisdiction or the other matters referred to in that Section, has to wait\nuntil the award is made to challenge that decision in an appeal against\nthe arbitral award itself in accordance with\nSection 34\nof the Act. But\nan acceptance of the objection to jurisdiction or authority, could be\nchallenged then and there, under\nSection 37\nof the Act.\nSection 17\n\nconfers powers on the arbitral tribunal to make interim orders. Chapter\nV comprising of\nSections 18\nto\ndeals with the conduct of arbitral\nproceedings. Chapter VI containing\nSections 28\nto\ndeals with\nmaking of the arbitral award and termination of the proceedings.\nChapter VII deals with recourse against an arbitral award.\nSection 34\n\ncontemplates the filing of an application for setting aside an arbitral\naward by making an application to the Court as defined in\nSection 2(e)\n\nof the Act. Chapter VIII deals with finality and enforcement of arbitral\nawards.\nSection 35\nmakes the award final and\nSection 36\nprovides for\nits enforcement under\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 in the same\nmanner as if it were a decree of court. Chapter IX deals with appeals\nand\nSection 37\nenumerates the orders that are open to appeal. We have\nalready referred to the right of appeal available under\nSection 37(2)\nof\nthe Act, on the Tribunal accepting a plea that it does not have\njurisdiction or when the arbitral tribunal accepts a plea that it is\nexceeding the scope of its authority. No second appeal is\ncontemplated, but right to approach the Supreme Court is saved.\nChapter X deals with miscellaneous matters.\nSection 43\nmakes the\n\nLimitation Act, 1963\napplicable to proceedings under the Act as it\napplies to proceedings in Court.\n\n7. We will first consider the question, as we see it. On a\nplain understanding of the relevant provisions of the Act, it is seen that\nin a case where there is an arbitration agreement, a dispute has arisen\nand one of the parties had invoked the agreed procedure for\nappointment of an arbitrator and the other party has not cooperated, the\nparty seeking an arbitration, could approach the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court if it is an internal arbitration or of the Supreme Court if it is\nan international arbitration to have an arbitrator or arbitral tribunal\nappointed. The Chief Justice, when so requested, could appoint an\narbitrator or arbitral tribunal depending on the nature of the agreement\nbetween the parties and after satisfying himself that the conditions for\nappointment of an arbitrator under sub-Section (6) of\nSection 11\ndo\nexist. The Chief Justice could designate another person or institution\nto take the necessary measures. The Chief Justice has also to have the\nqualification of the arbitrators in mind before choosing the arbitrator.\nAn arbitral tribunal so constituted, in terms of\nSection 16\nof the Act,\nhas the right to decide whether it has jurisdiction to proceed with the\narbitration, whether there was any agreement between the parties and\nthe other matters referred to therein.\n\n8. Normally, any tribunal or authority conferred with a power\nto act under a statute, has the jurisdiction to satisfy itself that the\nconditions for the exercise of that power existed and that the case calls\nfor the exercise of that power. Such an adjudication relating to its own\njurisdiction which could be called a decision on jurisdictional facts, is\nnot generally final, unless it is made so by the Act constituting the\ntribunal. Here, sub-Section (7) of\nSection 11\nhas given a finality to the\ndecisions taken by the Chief Justice or any person or institution\ndesignated by him in respect of matters falling under sub-Sections (4),\n(5) and (6) of\nSection 11\n. Once a statute creates an authority, confers\non it power to adjudicate and makes its decision final on matters to be\ndecided by it, normally, that decision cannot be said to be a purely\nadministrative decision. It is really a decision on its own jurisdiction\nfor the exercise of the power conferred by the statute or to perform the\nduties imposed by the statute. Unless, the authority satisfies itself that\nthe conditions for exercise of its power exist, it could not accede to a\nrequest made to it for the exercise of the conferred power. While\nexercising the power or performing the duty under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nAct, the Chief Justice has to consider whether the conditions\nlaid down\nby\nthe section for the exercise of that power or the performance of that\nduty, exist. Therefore, unaided by authorities and going by general\nprincipals, it appears to us that while functioning under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Act, a Chief Justice or the person or institution designated by\nhim, is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction, whether there is an\narbitration agreement, whether the applicant before him, is a party,\nwhether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled and\nif an arbitrator is to be appointed, who is the fit person, in terms of the\nprovision.\nSection 11(7)\nmakes his decision on the matters entrusted\nto him, final.\n\n9. The very scheme, if it involves an adjudicatory process,\nrestricts the power of the Chief Justice to designate, by excluding the\ndesignation of a non-judicial institution or a non-judicial authority to\nperform the functions. For, under our dispensation, no judicial or\nquasi-judicial decision can be rendered by an institution if it is not a\njudicial authority, court or a quasi-judicial tribunal. This aspect is dealt\nwith later while dealing with the right to designate under\nSection 11(6)\n\nand the scope of that designation.\n\n10. The appointment of an arbitrator against the opposition of\none of the parties on the ground that the Chief Justice had no\njurisdiction or on the ground that there was no arbitration agreement, or\non the ground that there was no dispute subsisting which was capable\nof being arbitrated upon or that the conditions for exercise of power\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act do not exist or that the qualification\ncontemplated for the arbitrator by the parties cannot be ignored and has\nto be borne in mind, are all adjudications which affect the rights of\nparties. It cannot be said that when the Chief Justice decides that he\nhas jurisdiction to proceed with the matter, that there is an arbitration\nagreement and that one of the parties to it has failed to act according to\nthe procedure agreed upon, he is not adjudicating on the rights of the\nparty who is raising these objections. The duty to decide the\npreliminary facts enabling the exercise of jurisdiction or power, gets all\nthe more emphasized, when sub-Section (7) designates the order under\nsub-sections (4), (5) or (6) a 'decision' and makes the decision of the\nChief Justice final on the matters referred to in that sub-Section. Thus,\ngoing by the general principles of law and the scheme of\nSection 11\n, it\nis difficult to call the order of the Chief Justice merely an\nadministrative order and to say that the opposite side need not even be\nheard before the Chief Justice exercises his power of appointing an\narbitrator. Even otherwise, when a statute confers a power or imposes\na duty on the highest judicial authority in the State or in the country,\nthat authority, unless shown otherwise, has to act judicially and has\nnecessarily to consider whether his power has been rightly invoked or\nthe conditions for the performance of his duty are shown to exist.\n\n11.\nSection 16\nof the Act only makes explicit what is even\notherwise implicit, namely, that the arbitral tribunal constituted under\nthe Act has the jurisdiction to rule on its own jurisdiction, including\nruling on objections with respect to the existence or validity of the\narbitration agreement. Sub-section (1) also directs that an arbitration\nclause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement\nindependent of the other terms of the contract. It also clarifies that a\ndecision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall\nnot entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. Sub-section\n(2) of\nSection 16\nenjoins that a party wanting to raise a plea that the\narbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction, has to raise that objection\nnot later than the submission of the statement of defence, and that the\nparty shall not be precluded from raising the plea of jurisdiction merely\nbecause he has appointed or participated in the appointment of an\narbitrator. Sub-section (3) lays down that a plea that the arbitral\ntribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority, shall be raised as soon\nas the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised\nduring the arbitral proceedings. When the Tribunal decides these two\nquestions, namely, the question of jurisdiction and the question of\nexceeding the scope of authority or either of them, the same is open to\nimmediate challenge in an appeal, when the objection is upheld and\nonly in an appeal against the final award, when the objection is\noverruled. Sub-section (5) enjoins that if the arbitral tribunal overrules\nthe objections under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), it should\ncontinue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award.\nSub-section (6) provides that a party aggrieved by such an arbitral\naward overruling the plea on lack of jurisdiction and the exceeding of\nthe scope of authority, may make an application on these grounds for\nsetting aside the award in accordance with\nSection 34\nof the Act. The\nquestion, in the context of Sub-Section (7) of\nSection 11\nis, what is the\nscope of the right conferred on the arbitral tribunal to rule upon its own\njurisdiction and the existence of the arbitration clause, envisaged by\n\nSection 16(1)\n, once the Chief Justice or the person designated by him\nhad appointed an arbitrator after satisfying himself that the conditions\nfor the exercise of power to appoint an arbitrator are present in the case.\nPrima facie, it would be difficult to say that in spite of the finality\nconferred by sub-Section (7) of\nSection 11\nof the Act, to such a\ndecision of the Chief Justice, the arbitral tribunal can still go behind\nthat decision and rule on its own jurisdiction or on the existence of an\narbitration clause. It also appears to us to be incongruous to say that\nafter the Chief Justice had appointed an arbitral tribunal, the arbitral\ntribunal can turn round and say that the Chief Justice had no\njurisdiction or authority to appoint the tribunal, the very creature\nbrought into existence by the exercise of power by its creator, the Chief\nJustice. The argument of learned Senior Counsel, Mr. K.K. Venugopal\nthat\nSection 16\nhas full play only when an arbitral tribunal is\nconstituted without intervention under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, is one\nway of reconciling that provision with\nSection 11\nof the Act, especially\nin the context of sub-section (7) thereof. We are inclined to the view\nthat the decision of the Chief Justice on the issue of jurisdiction and the\nexistence of a valid arbitration agreement would be binding on the\nparties when the matter goes to the arbitral tribunal and at subsequent\nstages of the proceeding except in an appeal in the Supreme Court in\nthe case of the decision being by the Chief Justice of the High Court or\nby a Judge of the High Court designated by him.\n\n12. It is common ground that the Act has adopted the\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration.\nBut at the same time, it has made some departures from the model law.\n\nSection 11\nis in the place of\nArticle 11\nof the Model Law. The Model\nLaw provides for the making of a request under\nArticle 11\nto \"the court\nor other authority specified in\nArticle 6\nto take the necessary measure\".\nThe words in\nSection 11\nof the Act, are \"the Chief Justice or the person\nor institution designated by him\". The fact that instead of the court,\nthe powers are conferred on the Chief Justice, has to be appreciated in\nthe context of the statute. 'Court' is defined in the Act to be the\nprincipal civil court of original jurisdiction of the district and includes\nthe High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\nThe principal civil court of original jurisdiction is normally the District\nCourt. The High Courts in India exercising ordinary original civil\njurisdiction are not too many. So in most of the States the concerned\ncourt would be the District Court. Obviously, the Parliament did not\nwant to confer the power on the District Court, to entertain a request for\nappointing an arbitrator or for constituting an arbitral tribunal under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act. It has to be noted that under\nSection 9\nof the\nAct, the District Court or the High Court exercising original\njurisdiction, has the power to make interim orders prior to, during or\neven post arbitration. It has also the power to entertain a challenge to\nthe award that may ultimately be made. The framers of the statute\nmust certainly be taken to have been conscious of the definition of\n'court' in the Act. It is easily possible to contemplate that they did not\nwant the power under\nSection 11\nto be conferred on the District Court\nor the High Court exercising original jurisdiction. The intention\napparently was to confer the power on the highest judicial authority in\nthe State and in the country, on Chief Justices of High Courts and on\nthe Chief Justice of India. Such a provision is necessarily intended to\nadd the greatest credibility to the arbitral process. The argument that\nthe power thus conferred on the Chief Justice could not even be\ndelegated to any other Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme\nCourt, stands negatived only because of the power given to designate\nanother. The intention of the legislature appears to be clear that it\nwanted to ensure that the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act was\nexercised by the highest judicial authority in the concerned State or in\nthe country. This is to ensure the utmost authority to the process of\nconstituting the arbitral tribunal.\n\n13. Normally, when a power is conferred on the highest\njudicial authority who normally performs judicial functions and is the\nhead of the judiciary of the State or of the country, it is difficult to\nassume that the power is conferred on the Chief Justice as persona\ndesignata. Under\nSection 11(6)\n, the Chief Justice is given a power to\ndesignate another to perform the functions under that provision. That\npower has generally been designated to a Judge of the High Court or of\nthe Supreme Court respectively. Persona designata, according to\nBlack's Law Dictionary, means \"A person considered as an individual\nrather than as a member of a class\". When the power is conferred on\nthe Chief Justices of the High Courts, the power is conferred on a class\nand not considering that person as an individual.\nIn the\nCentral\nTalkies Ltd., Kanpur vs. Dwarka Prasad\n(1961 (3) SCR 495) while\nconsidering the status in which the power was to be exercised by the\nDistrict Magistrate under the United Provinces (Temporary) Control\nof Rent and Eviction Act, 1947, this Court held:\n\n\"a persona designata is \"a person who is pointed out or\ndescribed as an individual, as opposed to a person\nascertained as a member of a class, or as filling a particular\ncharacter.\" (See Osborn's Concise Law Dictionary, 4th\nEdition., p.253). In the words of Schwabe, C.J., in\nParthasardhi Naidu vs. Koteswara Rao,[I.L.R. 47 Mad 369\nF.B.] personae designatae are, \"persons selected to act in\ntheir private capacity and not in their capacity as Judges.\"\n\nThe same consideration applies also to a well-known\nofficer like the District Magistrate named by virtue of his\noffice, and whose powers the Additional District\nMagistrate can also exercise and who can create other\nofficers equal to himself for the purpose of the Eviction\nAct.\"\n\nIn\nMukri Gopalan vs. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker\n\n[(1995) 5 SCC 5] this Court after quoting the above passage from the\n\nCentral Talkies Ltd., Kanpur vs. Dwarka Prasad\n, applied the test to\ncome to the conclusion that when\nSection 18\nof the Kerala Buildings\n(Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965 constituted the District Judge as an\nappellate authority under that Act, it was a case where the authority was\nbeing conferred on District Judges who constituted a class and,\ntherefore, the appellate authority could not be considered to be persona\ndesignata. What can be gathered from P. Ramanatha Aiyar's\nAdvanced Law Lexicon, 3rd Edition, 2005, is that \"persona designata\"\n\nis a person selected to act in his private capacity and not in his capacity\nas a judge. He is a person pointed out or described as an individual as\nopposed to a person ascertained as a member of a class or as filling a\nparticular character. It is also seen that one of the tests to be applied is\nto see whether the person concerned could exercise the power only so\nlong as he holds office or could exercise the power even subsequently.\nObviously, on ceasing to be a Chief Justice, the person referred to in\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act could not exercise the power. Thus, it is clear\nthat the power is conferred on the Chief Justice under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act not as persona designata.\n\n14. Normally a persona designata cannot delegate his power to\nanother. Here, the Chef Justice of the High Court or the Chief Justice\nof India is given the power to designate another to exercise the power\nconferred on him under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. If the power is a\njudicial power, it is obvious that the power could be conferred only on\na judicial authority and in this case, logically on another Judge of the\nHigh Court or on a Judge of the Supreme Court. It is logical to\nconsider the conferment of the power on the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt and on the Chief Justice of India as presiding Judges of the High\nCourt and the Supreme Court and the exercise of the power so\nconferred, is exercise of judicial power/authority as presiding Judges of\nthe respective courts. Replacing of the word 'court' in the Model Law\nwith the expression \"Chief Justice\" in the Act, appears to be more for\nexcluding the exercise of power by the District Court and by the court\nas an entity leading to obvious consequences in the matter of the\nprocedure to be followed and the rights of appeal governing the matter.\nThe departure from\nArticle 11\nof the Model Law and the use of the\nexpression \"Chief Justice\" cannot be taken to exclude the theory of its\nbeing an adjudication under\nSection 11\nof the Act by a judicial\nauthority.\n\n15. We may at this stage notice the complementary nature of\n\nSections 8\nand\n. Where there is an arbitration agreement between the\nparties and one of the parties, ignoring it, files an action before a\njudicial authority and the other party raises the objection that there is an\narbitration clause, the judicial authority has to consider that objection\nand if the objection is found sustainable to refer the parties to\narbitration. The expression used in this Section is 'shall' and this Court\nin\nP. Anand Gajapathi Raju Vs. P.V. G. Raju\n[(2000) 4 SCC 539\nand in\nHindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Vs. Pink City\nMidway Petroleum\n[(2003) 6 SCC 503] has held that the judicial\nauthority is bound to refer the matter to arbitration once the existence\nof a valid arbitration clause is established. Thus, the judicial authority\nis entitled to, has to and bound to decide the jurisdictional issue raised\nbefore it, before making or declining to make a reference.\nSection 11\n\nonly covers another situation. Where one of the parties has refused to\nact in terms of the arbitration agreement, the other party moves the\nChief Justice under\nSection 11\nof the Act to have an arbitrator\nappointed and the first party objects, it would be incongruous to hold\nthat the Chief Justice cannot decide the question of his own jurisdiction\nto appoint an arbitrator when in a parallel situation, the judicial\nauthority can do so. Obviously, the highest judicial authority has to\ndecide that question and his competence to decide cannot be\nquestioned. If it is held that the Chief Justice has no right or duty to\ndecide the question or cannot decide the question, it will lead to an\nanomalous situation in that a judicial authority under\nSection 8\ncan\ndecide, but not a Chief Justice under\nSection 11\n, though the nature of\nthe objection is the same and the consequence of accepting the\nobjection in one case and rejecting it in the other, is also the same,\nnamely, sending the parties to arbitration. The interpretation of\nSection\nthat we have adopted would not give room for such an anomaly.\n\n16.\nSection 11(6)\ndoes enable the Chief Justice to designate\nany person or institution to take the necessary measures on an\napplication made under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. This power to\ndesignate recognized in the Chief Justice, has led to an argument that a\njudicial decision making is negatived, in taking the necessary measures\non an application, under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. It is pointed out that\nthe Chief Justice may designate even an institution like the Chamber of\nCommerce or the Institute of Engineers and they are not judicial\nauthorities. Here, we find substance in the argument of Mr.\nF.S.Nariman, learned senior counsel that in the context of\nSection 5\nof\nthe Act excluding judicial intervention except as provided in the Act,\nthe designation contemplated is not for the purpose of deciding the\npreliminary facts justifying the exercise of power to appoint an\narbitrator, but only for the purpose of nominating to the Chief Justice a\nsuitable person to be appointed as arbitrator, especially, in the context\nof\nSection 11(8)\nof the Act. One of the objects of conferring power on\nthe highest judicial authority in the State or in the country for\nconstituting the arbitral tribunal, is to ensure credibility in the entire\narbitration process and looked at from that point of view, it is difficult\nto accept the contention that the Chief Justice could designate a non-\njudicial body like the Chamber of Commerce to decide on the existence\nof an arbitration agreement and so on, which are decisions, normally,\njudicial or quasi judicial in nature.\nWhere a Chief Justice designates\nnot a Judge, but another person or an institution to nominate an arbitral\ntribunal, that can be done only after questions as to jurisdiction,\nexistence of the agreement and the like, are decided first by him or his\nnominee Judge and what is to be left to be done is only to nominate the\nmembers for constituting the arbitral tribunal. Looking at the scheme\nof the Act as a whole and the object with which it was enacted,\nreplacing the\nArbitration Act\nof 1940, it seems to be proper to view the\nconferment of power on the Chief Justice as the conferment of a\njudicial power to decide on the existence of the conditions justifying\nthe constitution of an arbitral tribunal. The departure from the\nUNCITRAL model regarding the conferment of the power cannot be\nsaid to be conclusive or significant in the circumstances. Observations\nof this Court in paragraphs 389 and 391 in Supreme Court Advocates\non\nRecord Association Vs. Union of India\n[(1993) 4 SCC 441 at 668]\nsupport the argument that the expression chief justice is used in the\nsense of collectivity of judges of the Supreme Court and the High\nCourts respectively.\n\n17. It is true that the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is\nnot conferred on the Supreme Court or on the High Court, but it is\nconferred on the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt. One possible reason for specifying the authority as the Chief\nJustice, could be that if it were merely the conferment of the power on\nthe High Court, or the Supreme Court, the matter would be governed\nby the normal procedure of that Court, including the right of appeal and\nthe Parliament obviously wanted to avoid that situation, since one of\nthe objects was to restrict the interference by Courts in the arbitral\nprocess. Therefore, the power was conferred on the highest judicial\nauthority in the country and in the State in their capacities as Chief\nJustices. They have been conferred the power or the right to pass an\norder contemplated by\nSection 11\nof the Act. We have already seen\nthat it is not possible to envisage that the power is conferred on the\nChief Justice as persona designata. Therefore, the fact that the power is\nconferred on the Chief Justice, and not on the court presided over by\nhim is not sufficient to hold that the power thus conferred is merely an\nadministrative power and is not a judicial power.\n\n18. It is also not possible to accept the argument that there is\nan exclusive conferment of jurisdiction on the arbitral tribunal, to\ndecide on the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.\n\nSection 8\nof the Act contemplates a judicial authority before which an\naction is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration\nagreement, on the terms specified therein, to refer the dispute to\narbitration. A judicial authority as such is not defined in the Act. It\nwould certainly include the court as defined in\nSection 2(e)\nof the Act\nand would also, in our opinion, include other courts and may even\ninclude a special tribunal like the Consumer Forum (See\nFair Air\nEngineers (P) Ltd. and another vs. N.K. Modi\n(1996 (6) SCC 385).\nWhen the defendant to an action before a judicial authority raises the\nplea that there is an arbitration agreement and the subject matter of the\nclaim is covered by the agreement and the plaintiff or the person who\nhas approached the judicial authority for relief, disputes the same, the\njudicial authority, in the absence of any restriction in the Act, has\nnecessarily to decide whether, in fact, there is in existence a valid\narbitration agreement and whether the dispute that is sought to be raised\nbefore it, is covered by the arbitration clause. It is difficult to\ncontemplate that the judicial authority has also to act mechanically or\nhas merely to see the original arbitration agreement produced before it,\nand mechanically refer the parties to an arbitration. Similarly,\nSection\nenables a Court, obviously, as defined in the Act, when approached\nby a party before the commencement of an arbitral proceeding, to grant\ninterim relief as contemplated by the Section. When a party seeks an\ninterim relief asserting that there was a dispute liable to be arbitrated\nupon in terms of the Act, and the opposite party disputes the existence\nof an arbitration agreement as defined in the Act or raises a plea that\nthe dispute involved was not covered by the arbitration clause, or that\nthe Court which was approached had no jurisdiction to pass any order\nin terms of\nSection 9\nof the Act, that Court has necessarily to decide\nwhether it has jurisdiction, whether there is an arbitration agreement\nwhich is valid in law and whether the dispute sought to be raised is\ncovered by that agreement. There is no indication in the Act that the\npowers of the Court are curtailed on these aspects. On the other hand,\n\nSection 9\ninsists that once approached in that behalf, \"the Court shall\nhave the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of and\nin relation to any proceeding before it\". Surely, when a matter is\nentrusted to a Civil Court in the ordinary hierarchy of Courts without\nanything more, the procedure of that Court would govern the\nadjudication [See R.M.A.R.A. Adaikappa Chettiar and anr. vs. R.\nChandrasekhara Thevar (AIR 1948 P.C. 12)]\n\n19.\nSection 16\nis said to be the recognition of the principle of\nKompetenz \u0016 Kompetenz. The fact that the arbitral tribunal has the\ncompetence to rule on its own jurisdiction and to define the contours of\nits jurisdiction, only means that when such issues arise before it, the\nTribunal can and possibly, ought to decide them. This can happen\nwhen the parties have gone to the arbitral tribunal without recourse to\n\nSection 8\nor 11 of the Act. But where the jurisdictional issues are\ndecided under these Sections, before a reference is made,\nSection 16\n\ncannot be held to empower the arbitral tribunal to ignore the decision\ngiven by the judicial authority or the Chief Justice before the reference\nto it was made. The competence to decide does not enable the arbitral\ntribunal to get over the finality conferred on an order passed prior to its\nentering upon the reference by the very statute that creates it. That is\nthe position arising out of\nSection 11(7)\nof the Act read with\nSection 16\n\nthereof. The finality given to the order of the Chief Justice on the\nmatters within his competence under\nSection 11\nof the Act, are\nincapable of being reopened before the arbitral tribunal. In Konkan\nRailway (Supra) what is considered is only the fact that under\nSection\n, the arbitral tribunal has the right to rule on its own jurisdiction and\nany objection, with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration\nagreement. What is the impact of\nSection 11(7)\nof the Act on the\narbitral tribunal constituted by an order under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act,\nwas not considered. Obviously, this was because of the view taken in\nthat decision that the Chief Justice is not expected to decide anything\nwhile entertaining a request under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act and is only\nperforming an administrative function in appointing an arbitral tribunal.\nOnce it is held that there is an adjudicatory function entrusted to the\nChief Justice by the Act, obviously, the right of the arbitral tribunal to\ngo behind the order passed by the Chief Justice would take another hue\nand would be controlled by\nSection 11(7)\nof the Act.\n\n20. We will now consider the prior decisions of this Court. In\nSundaram Finance Ltd. vs. NEPC India Ltd. (1999(2) SCC\n\n479) this Court held that the provisions of the Act must be\ninterpreted and construed independently of the interpretation\nplaced on the\nArbitration Act, 1940\nand it will be more relevant to\nrefer to the UNCITRAL model law while called upon to interpret the\nprovisions of the Act. This Court further held that under the 1996 Act,\nappointment of arbitrator(s) is made as per the provision of\nSection 11\n\nwhich does not require the Court to pass a judicial order appointing an\narbitrator or arbitrators. It is seen that the question was not discussed\nas such, since the court in that case was not concerned with the\ninterpretation of\nSection 11\nof the Act.\nThe view as above was quoted\nwith approval in\nAdor Samia Private Limited Vs. Peekay Holdings\nLimited & Others\n(1999 (8) SCC 572) and nothing further was said\nabout the question. In other words, the question as to the nature of the\norder to be passed by the Chief Justice when moved under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act, was not discussed or decided upon.\n\n21.\nIn\nWellington Associates Ltd. vs. Kirit Mehta\n(2000 (4)\nSCC 272) it was contended before the designated Judge that what was\nrelied on by the applicant was not an arbitration clause. The applicant\ncontended that the Chief Justice of India or the designate Judge cannot\ndecide that question and only the arbitrator can decide the question in\nview of\nSection 16\nof the Act. The designated Judge held that\nSection\ndid not exclude the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of India or the\ndesignated Judge to decide the question of the existence of an\narbitration clause. After considering the relevant aspects, the learned\nJudge held:\n\n\"I am of the view that in cases where --- to start with \u0016\nthere is a dispute raised at the stage of the application\nunder\nSection 11\nthat there is no arbitration clause at all,\nthen it will be absurd to refer the very issue to an arbitrator\nwithout deciding whether there is an arbitration clause at\nall between the parties to start with. In my view, in the\npresent situation, the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of\nIndia or his designate to decide the question as to the\n\"existence\" of the arbitration clause cannot be doubted and\ncannot be said to be excluded by\nSection 16\n.\"\n\n22. Then came\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. vs.\nMehul Construction Co.\n(2000(7) SCC 201) in which the first\nquestion framed was, what was the nature of the order passed by the\nChief Justice or his nominee in exercise of his power under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996? After noticing the\nStatement of Objects and Reasons for the Act and after comparing the\nlanguage of\nSection 11\nof the Act and the corresponding article of the\nmodel law, it was stated that the Act has designated the Chief Justice of\nthe High Court in cases of domestic arbitration and the Chief Justice of\nIndia in cases of international commercial arbitration, to be the\nauthority to perform the function of appointment of an arbitrator,\nwhereas under the model law, the said power was vested with the\ncourt. When the matter is placed before the Chief Justice or his\nnominee under\nSection 11\nof the Act it was imperative for the Chief\nJustice or his nominee to bear in mind the legislative intent that the\narbitral process should be set in motion without any delay whatsoever\nand all contentious issues left to be raised before the arbitral tribunal\nitself. It was further held that at that stage, it would not be appropriate\nfor the Chief Justice or his nominee, to entertain any contention or\ndecide the same between the parties. It was also held that in view of\nthe conferment of power on the arbitral tribunal under\nSection 16\nof the\nAct, the intention of the legislature and its anxiety to see that the\narbitral process is set in motion at the earliest, it will be appropriate for\nthe Chief Justice to appoint an arbitrator without wasting any time or\nwithout entertaining any contentious issue by a party objecting to the\nappointment of an arbitrator. The Court stated:\n\n\"Bearing in mind the purpose of legislation, the language\nused in\nSection 11(6)\nconferring power on the Chief\nJustice or his nominee to appoint an arbitrator, the\ncurtailment of the power of the court in the matter of\ninterference, the expanding jurisdiction of the arbitrator\nin course of the arbitral proceeding, and above all the\nmain objective, namely, the confidence of the\ninternational market for speedy disposal of their disputes,\nthe character and status of an order appointing an\narbitrator by the Chief Justice or his nominee under\n\nSection 11(6)\nhas to be decided upon. If it is held that an\norder under\nSection 11(6)\nis a judicial or quasi-judicial\norder then the said order would be amenable to judicial\nintervention and any reluctant party may frustrate the\nentire purpose of the Act by adopting dilatory tactics in\napproaching a court of law even against an order of\nappointment of an arbitrator. Such an interpretation has\nto be avoided in order to achieve the basic objective for\nwhich the country has enacted the Act of 1996 adopting\nthe UNCITRAL Model.\"\n\n23. The Court proceeded to say that if it were to be held that\nthe order passed was purely administrative in nature, that would\nfacilitate the achieving of the object of the Act, namely, quickly setting\nin motion the process of arbitration. Great emphasis was placed on the\nconferment of power on the Chief Justice in preference to a court as\nwas obtaining in the model law. It was concluded \" The nature of the\nfunction performed by the Chief Justice being essentially to aid the\nconstitution of the arbitral tribunal immediately and the legislature\nhaving consciously chosen to confer the power on the Chief Justice and\nnot a court, it is apparent that the order passed by the Chief Justice or\nhis nominee is an administrative order as has been held by this Court in\n\nAdor Samia\ncase (supra) and the observations of this Court in\n\nSundaram Finance Ltd.\ncase (supra) also are quite appropriate\nand neither of those decisions require any reconsideration.\"\n\n24. It was thus held that an order passed under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Act, by the Chief Justice of the High Court or his nominee, was\nan administrative order, its purpose being the speedy disposal of\ncommercial disputes and that such an order could not be subjected to\njudicial review under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India. Even an\norder refusing to appoint an arbitrator would not be amenable to the\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution.\nA petition under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution was also not\nmaintainable. But, an order refusing to appoint an arbitrator made by\nthe Chief Justice could be challenged before the High Court under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution. What seems to have persuaded this\nCourt was the fact that the statement of objects and reasons of the Act\nclearly enunciated that the main object of the legislature was to\nminimize the supervisory role of courts in arbitral process. Since\n\nSection 16\nempowers the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction\nincluding ruling on objections with respect to the existence or validity\nof an arbitration agreement, a party would have the opportunity to raise\nhis grievance against that decision either immediately or while\nchallenging the award after it was pronounced. Since it was not proper\nto encourage a party to an arbitration, to frustrate the entire purpose of\nthe Act by adopting dilatory tactics by approaching the court even\nagainst the order of appointment of an arbitrator, it was necessary to\ntake the view that the order was administrative in nature. This was all\nthe more so, since the nature of the function performed by the Chief\nJustice was essentially to aid the constitution of the arbitral tribunal\nimmediately and the legislature having consciously chosen to confer\nthe power on the Chief Justice and not on the court, it was apparent that\nthe order was an administrative order. With respect, it has to be\npointed out that this Court did not discus or consider the nature of the\npower that the Chief Justice is called upon to exercise. Merely because\nthe main purpose was the constitution of an arbitral tribunal, it could\nnot be taken that the exercise of power is an administrative power.\nWhile constituting an arbitral tribunal, on the scheme of the Act, the\nChief Justice has to consider whether he as the Chief Justice has\njurisdiction in relation to the contract, whether there was an arbitration\nagreement in terms of\nSection 7\nof the Act and whether the person\nbefore him with the request, is a party to the arbitration agreement. On\ncoming to a conclusion on these aspects, he has to enquire whether the\nconditions for exercise of his power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\nexist in the case and only on being satisfied in that behalf, he could\nappoint an arbitrator or an arbitral tribunal on the basis of the request.\nIt is difficult to say that when one of the parties raises an objection that\nthere is no arbitration agreement, raises an objection that the person\nwho has come forward with a request is not a party to the arbitration\nagreement, the Chief Justice can come to a conclusion on those\nobjections without following an adjudicatory process. Can he\nconstitute an arbitrary tribunal, without considering these questions? If\nhe can do so, why should such a function be entrusted to a high judicial\nauthority like the Chief Justice. Similarly, when the party raises an\nobjection that the conditions for exercise of the power under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act are not fulfilled and the Chief Justice comes to the\nconclusion that they have been fulfilled, it is difficult to say that he was\nnot adjudicating on a dispute between the parties and was merely\npassing an administrative order. It is also not correct to say that by the\nmere constitution of an arbitral tribunal the rights of parties are not\naffected. Dragging a party to an arbitration when there existed no\narbitration agreement or when there existed no arbitrable dispute, can\ncertainly affect the right of that party and even on monetary terms,\nimpose on him a serious liability for meeting the expenses of the\narbitration, even if it be preliminary expenses and his objection is\nupheld by the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, it is not possible to accept\nthe position that no adjudication is involved in the constitution of an\narbitral tribunal.\n\n25. It is also somewhat incongruous to permit the order of the\nChief Justice under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act being subjected to scrutiny\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution at the hands of another Judge of\nthe High Court. In the absence of any conferment of an appellate\npower, it may not be possible to say that a certiorari would lie against\nthe decision of the High Court in the very same High Court. Even in\nthe case of an international arbitration, the decision of the Chief Justice\nof India would be amenable to challenge under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution before a High Court. While construing the scope of the\npower under\nSection 11(6)\n, it will not be out of place for the court to\nbear this aspect in mind, since after all, courts follow or attempt to\nfollow certain judicial norms and that precludes such challenges (see\nNaresh Shridhar Mirajkar and others.\nVs. State of Maharashtra\nand another (1966 (3) SCR 744) and Rupa Ashok Hurra vs. Ashok\nHurra and another\n(2002 (4) SCC 388).\n\n26. In Nimet Resourcs Inc. & Anr. Vs.Essar Steels Ltd.\n(2000 (7) SCC 497) the question of existence or otherwise of an\narbitration agreement between the parties was itself held to be referable\nto the arbitrator since the order proceeded on the basis that the power\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nwas merely administrative.\n\n27. The correctness of the decision in\nKonkan Railway\nCorpn. Ltd. vs. Mehul Construction Co.\n(supra) was doubted in\n\nKonkan Railway Cooperation Ltd. vs. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.\n\nand the order of reference, is reported in 2000 (8) SCC 159. The\nreconsideration was recommended on the ground that the Act did not\ntake away the power of the Court to decide preliminary issues\nnotwithstanding the arbitrator's competence to decide such issues\nincluding whether particular matters were \"excepted matters\", or\nwhether an arbitration agreement existed or whether there was a dispute\nin terms of the agreement. It was noticed that in other countries where\nUNCITRAL model was being followed, the court could decide such\nissues judicially and need not mechanically appoint an arbitrator.\nThere were situations where preliminary issues would have to be\ndecided by the court rather than by the arbitrator. If the order of the\nChief Justice or his nominees were to be treated as an administrative\none, it could be challenged before the single Judge of the High Court,\nthen before a Division Bench and then the Supreme Court under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, a result that would cause further delay in\narbitral proceedings, something sought to be prevented by the Act. An\norder under\nSection 11\nof the Act did not relate to the administrative\nfunctions of the Chief Justice or of the Chief Justice of India.\n\n28. The reference came up before a Constitution Bench.\nIn\n\nKonkan Railway Construction Ltd. vs. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.\n\n(2002 (2) SCC 388), the Constitution Bench reiterated the view taken\nin\nMehul Construction Co.\n's case (supra), if we may say so with\nrespect, without really answering the questions posed by the order of\nreference. It was stated that there is nothing in\nSection 11\nof the Act\nthat requires the party other than the party making the request, to be\ngiven notice of the proceedings before the Chief Justice. The Court\nwent on to say that\nSection 11\ndid not contemplate a response from the\nother party. The approach was to say that none of the requirements\nreferred to in\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act contemplated or amounted to an\nadjudication by the Chief Justice while appointing an arbitrator. The\nscheme framed under the\nArbitration Act\nby the Chief Justice of India\nwas held to be not mandatory. It was stated that the UNCITRAL\nmodel law was only taken into account and hence the model law, or\njudgments and literature thereon, was not a guide to the interpretation\nof the Act and especially of\nSection 11\n.\n\n29. With respect, what was the effect of the Chief Justice\nhaving to decide his own jurisdiction in a given case was not\nconsidered by the Bench. Surely, the question whether the Chief\nJustice could entertain the application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\ncould not be left to the decision of the arbitral tribunal constituted by\nhim on entertaining such an application. We also feel that adequate\nattention was not paid to the requirement of the Chief Justice having to\ndecide that there is an arbitration agreement in terms of\nSection 7\nof the\nAct before he could exercise his power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\nand its implication. The aspect, whether there was an arbitration\nagreement, was not merely a jurisdictional fact for commencing the\narbitration itself, but it was also a jurisdictional fact for appointing an\narbitrator on a motion under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, was not kept in\nview. A Chief Justice could appoint an arbitrator in exercise of his\npower only if there existed an arbitration agreement and without\nholding that there was an agreement, it would not be open to him to\nappoint an arbitrator saying that he was appointing an arbitrator since\nhe has been moved in that behalf and the applicant before him asserts\nthat there is an arbitration agreement. Acceptance of such an\nargument, with great respect, would reduce the high judicial authority\nentrusted with the power to appoint an arbitrator, an automaton and\nsub-servient to the arbitral tribunal which he himself brings into\nexistence. Our system of law does not contemplate such a situation.\n\n30. With great respect, it is seen that the court did not really\nconsider the nature of the rights of the parties involved when the Chief\nJustice exercised the power of constituting the arbitral tribunal. The\ncourt also did not consider whether it was not necessary for the Chief\nJustice to satisfy himself of the existence of the facts which alone\nwould entitle him or enable him to accede to the request for\nappointment of an arbitrator and what was the nature of that process by\nwhich he came to the conclusion that an arbitral tribunal was liable to\nbe constituted. When, for example, a dispute which no more survives\nas a dispute, was referred to an arbitral tribunal or when an arbitral\ntribunal was constituted even in the absence of an arbitration agreement\nas understood by the Act, how could the rights of the objecting party\nbe said to be not affected, was not considered in that perspective. In\nother words, the Constitution Bench proceeded on the basis that while\nexercising power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act there was nothing for\nthe Chief Justice to decide. With respect, the very question that fell for\ndecision was whether there had to be an adjudication on the preliminary\nmatters involved and when the result had to depend on that\nadjudication, what was the nature of that adjudication. It is in that\ncontext that a reconsideration of\nthe said decision\nis sought for in this\ncase. The ground of ensuring minimum judicial intervention by itself\nis not a ground to hold that the power exercised by the Chief Justice is\nonly an administrative function. As pointed out in the order of\nreference to that Bench, the conclusion that it is only an administrative\nact is the opening of the gates for an approach to the High Court under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, for an appeal under the Letters Patent\nor the concerned\nHigh Court Act\nto a Division Bench and a further\nappeal to this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n31. Moreover, in a case where the objection to jurisdiction or\nthe existence of an arbitration agreement is overruled by the arbitral\ntribunal, the party has to participate in the arbitration proceedings\nextending over a period of time by incurring substantial expenditure\nand then to come to court with an application under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act seeking the setting aside of the award on the ground\nthat there was no arbitration agreement or that there was nothing to be\narbitrated upon when the tribunal was constituted. Though this may\navoid intervention by court until the award is pronounced, it does mean\nconsiderable expenditure and time spent by the party before the arbitral\ntribunal. On the other hand, if even at the initial stage, the Chief Justice\njudicially pronounces that he has jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator,\nthat there is an arbitration agreement between the parties, that there was\na live and subsisting dispute for being referred to arbitration and\nconstitutes the tribunal as envisaged, on being satisfied of the existence\nof the conditions for the exercise of his power, ensuring that the\narbitrator is a qualified arbitrator, that will put an end to a host of\ndisputes between the parties, leaving the party aggrieved with a remedy\nof approaching this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. That\nwould give this Court, an opportunity of scrutinizing the decision of the\nChief Justice on merits and deciding whether it calls for interference in\nexercise of its plenary power. Once this Court declines to interfere\nwith the adjudication of the Chief Justice to the extent it is made, it\nbecomes final. This reasoning is also supported by sub-section (7) of\n\nSection 11\n, making final, the decision of the Chief Justice on the\nmatters decided by him while constituting the arbitral tribunal. This\nwill leave the arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute on merits\nunhampered by preliminary and technical objections. In the long run,\nespecially in the context of the judicial system in our country, this\nwould be more conducive to minimising judicial intervention in matters\ncoming under the Act. This will also avert the situation where even\nthe order of the Chief Justice of India could be challenged before a\nsingle judge of the High Court invoking the\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India or before an arbitral tribunal, consisting not\nnecessarily of legally trained persons and their coming to a conclusion\nthat their constitution by the Chief Justice was not warranted in the\nabsence of an arbitration agreement or in the absence of a dispute in\nterms of the agreement.\n\n32.\nSection 8\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940 enabled the court\nwhen approached in that behalf to supply an omission.\nSection 20\nof\nthat Act enabled the court to compel the parties to produce the\narbitration agreement and then to appoint an arbitrator for adjudicating\non the disputes. It may be possible to say that\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\ncombines both the powers. May be, it is more in consonance with\n\nSection 8\nof the Old Act. But to call the power merely as an\nadministrative one, does not appear to be warranted in the context of\nthe relevant provisions of the Act. First of all, the power is conferred\nnot on an administrative authority, but on a judicial authority, the\nhighest judicial authority in the State or in the country. No doubt, such\nauthorities also perform administrative functions. An appointment of\nan arbitral tribunal in terms of\nSection 11\nof the Act, is based on a\npower derived from a statute and the statute itself prescribes the\nconditions that should exist for the exercise of that power. In the\nprocess of exercise of that power, obviously the parties would have the\nright of being heard and when the existence of the conditions for the\nexercise of the power are found on accepting or overruling the\ncontentions of one of the parties it necessarily amounts to an order,\njudicial in nature, having finality subject to any available judicial\nchallenge as envisaged by the Act or any other statute or the\nConstitution. Looked at from that point of view also, it seems to be\nappropriate to hold that the Chief Justice exercises a judicial power\nwhile appointing an arbitrator.\n\n33. In Attorney Geenral of the Gambia vs. Pierre Sarr\nN'jie (1961 Appeal Cases 617) the question arose whether the power\nto judge an alleged professional misconduct could be delegated to a\nDeputy Judge by the Chief Justice who had the power to suspend any\nbarrister or solicitor from practicing within the jurisdiction of the court.\nUnder\nSection 7\nof the Supreme Court Ordinance of the Gambia, the\nDeputy Judge could exercise \"all the judicial powers of the Judge of the\nSupreme Court\". The question was, whether the taking of disciplinary\naction for professional misconduct; was a judicial power or an\nadministrative power. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council\nheld that a judge exercises judicial powers not only when he is deciding\nsuits between the parties but also when he exercises disciplinary\npowers which are properly appurtenant to the office of a judge. By\nway of illustration, Lord Dening stated \"Suppose, for instance, that a\njudge finding that a legal practitioner had been guilty of professional\nmisconduct in the course of a case, orders him to pay the costs, as he\nhas undoubtedly power to do (see Myers v. Elman, per Lord Wright).\nThat would be an exercise of the judicial powers of the judge just as\nmuch as if he committed him for contempt of court. Yet there is no\ndifference in quality between the power to order him to pay costs and\nthe power to suspend him or strike him off.\"\n\n34. The above example gives an indication that it is the nature\nof the power that is relevant and not the mode of exercise. In\nShankarlal Aggarwal and ors. vs. Shankar Lal Poddar and ors.\n(1964 (1) SCR 717) this Court was dealing with the question whether\nthe order of the Company Judge confirming a sale was merely an\nadministrative order passed in the course of the administration of the\nassets of the company under liquidation and, therefore, not a judicial\norder subject to appeal. This Court held that the order of the Company\nJudge confirming the sale was not an administrative but a judicial\norder. Their Lordships stated thus:\n\n\"It is not correct to say that every order of the Court,\nmerely for the reason that it is passed in the course of the\nrealization of the assets of the Company, must always be\ntreated merely as an administrative one. The question\nultimately depends upon the nature of the order that is\npassed. An order according sanction to a sale\nundoubtedly involves a discretion and cannot be termed\nmerely an administrative order, for before confirming\nthe sale the court has to be satisfied, particularly where\nthe confirmation is opposed, that the sale has been held in\naccordance with the conditions subject to which alone the\nliquidator has been permitted to effect it, and that even\notherwise the sale has been fair and has not resulted in\nany loss to the parties who would ultimately have to\nshare the realization.\n\nIt is not possible to formulate a definition which\nwould satisfactorily distinguish between an\nadministrative and a judicial order. That the power is\nentrusted to or wielded by a person who functions as a\ncourt is not decisive of the question whether the act or\ndecision is administrative or judicial. An administrative\norder would be one which is directed to the regulation or\nsupervision of matters as distinguished from an order\nwhich decides the rights of parties or confers or refuses\nto confer rights to property which are the subject of\nadjudication before the court. One of the tests would be\nwhether a matter which involves the exercise of\ndiscretion is left for the decision of the authority,\nparticularly if that authority were a court, and if the\ndiscretion has to be exercised on objective, as\ndistinguished from a purely subjective consideration, it\nwould be a judicial decision. It has sometimes been said\nthat the essence of a judicial proceeding or of a judicial\norder is that there would be two parties and a lis between\nthem which is the subject of adjudication, as a result of\nthat order or a decision on an issue between a proposal\nand an opposition. No doubt it would not be possible to\ndescribe an order passed deciding a lis between the\nauthority that is not a judicial order but it does not follow\nthat the absence of a lis necessarily negatives the order\nbeing judicial. Even viewed from this narrow\nstandpoint, it is possible to hold that there was a lis\nbefore the Company Judge which he decided by passing\nthe order. On the one hand were the claims of the\nhighest bidder who put forward the contention that he\nhad satisfied the requirements laid down for the\nacceptance of his bid and was consequently entitled to\nhave the sale in his favour confirmed, particularly so as\nhe was supported in this behalf by the Official\nLiquidators. On the other hand, there was the first\nrespondent and the large body of unsecured creditors\nwhose interests, even if they were not represented by the\nfirst respondent, the court was bound to protect. If the\nsale of which confirmation was sought was characterized\nby any deviation subject to which the sale was directed to\nbe held or even otherwise was for a gross undervalue in\nthe sense that very much more could reasonably be\nexpected to be obtained if the sale were properly held, in\nview of the figure of Rs.3,37,000/- which had been bid\nby Nandlal Agarwalla it would be duty of the court to\nrefuse the confirmation in the interests of the general\nbody of creditors, and this was the submission made by\nthe first respondent. There were thus two points of view\npresented to the court by two contending parties or\ninterests and the court was called upon to decide between\nthem, and the decision vitally affected the rights of the\nparties to property. Under the circumstances, the order\nof the Company Judge was a judicial order and not\nadministrative one, and was therefore not inherently\nincapable of being brought up in appeal.\"\n\n35. Going by the above test it is seen that at least in the matter\nof deciding his own jurisdiction and in the matter of deciding on the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement, the Chief Justice when\nconfronted with two points of view presented by the rival parties, is\ncalled upon to decide between them and the decision vitally affects the\nrights of the parties in that, either the claim for appointing an arbitral\ntribunal leading to an award is denied to a party or the claim to have an\narbitration proceeding set in motion for entertaining a claim is\nfacilitated by the Chief Justice. In this context, it is not possible to say\nthat the Chief Justice is merely exercising an administrative function\nwhen called upon to appoint an arbitrator and that he need not even\nissue notice to opposite side before appointing an arbitrator.\n\n36. It is fundamental to our procedural jurisprudence, that the\nright of no person shall be affected without he being heard. This\nnecessarily imposes an obligation on the Chief Justice to issue notice to\nthe opposite party when he is moved under\nSection 11\nof the Act. The\nnotice to the opposite party cannot be considered to be merely an\nintimation to that party of the filing of the arbitration application and\nthe passing of an administrative order appointing an arbitrator or an\narbitral tribunal. It is really the giving of an opportunity of being heard.\nThere have been cases where claims for appointment of an arbitrator\nbased on an arbitration agreement are made ten or twenty years after\nthe period of the contract has come to an end. There have been cases\nwhere the appointment of an arbitrator has been sought, after the parties\nhad settled the accounts and the concerned party had certified that he\nhad no further claims against the other contracting party. In other\nwords, there have been occasions when dead claims are sought to be\nresurrected. There have been cases where assertions are made of the\nexistence of arbitration agreements when, in fact, such existence is\nstrongly disputed by the other side who appears on issuance of notice.\nControversies are also raised as to whether the claim that is sought to\nbe put forward comes within the purview of the concerned arbitration\nclause at all.\nThe Chief Justice has necessarily to apply his mind to\nthese aspects before coming to a conclusion one way or the other and\nbefore proceeding to appoint an arbitrator or declining to appoint an\narbitrator. Obviously, this is an adjudicatory process. An opportunity\nof hearing to both parties is a must. Even in administrative functions if\nrights are affected, rules of natural justice step in. The principles\nsettled by Ridge Vs. Baldwin [(1963) 2 ALL ER 66] are well known\nTherefore, to the extent,\nKonkan Railway\n(supra) states that no notice\nneed be issued to the opposite party to give him an opportunity of being\nheard before appointing an arbitrator, with respect, the same has to be\nheld to be not sustainable.\n\n37. It is true that finality under\nSection 11 (7)\nof the Act is\nattached only to a decision of the Chief Justice on a matter entrusted by\nsub-Section (4) or sub-Section (5) or sub-Section (6) of that Section.\nSub-Section (4) deals with the existence of an appointment procedure\nand the failure of a party to appoint the arbitrator within 30 days from\nthe receipt of a request to do so from the other party or when the two\nappointed arbitrators fail to agree on the presiding arbitrator within 30\ndays of their appointment. Sub-Section (5) deals with the parties\nfailing to agree in nominating a sole arbitrator within 30 days of the\nrequest in that behalf made by one of the parties to the arbitration\nagreement and sub-Section (6) deals with the Chief Justice appointing\nan arbitrator or an arbitral tribunal when the party or the two arbitrators\nor a person including an institution entrusted with the function, fails to\nperform the same. The finality, at first blush, could be said to be only\non the decision on these matters. But the basic requirement for\nexercising his power under\nSection 11(6)\n, is the existence of an\narbitration agreement in terms of\nSection 7\nof the Act and the applicant\nbefore the Chief Justice being shown to be a party to such an\nagreement. It would also include the question of the existence of\njurisdiction in him to entertain the request and an enquiry whether at\nleast a part of the cause of action has arisen within the concerned State.\nTherefore, a decision on jurisdiction and on the existence of the\narbitration agreement and of the person making the request being a\nparty to that agreement and the subsistence of an arbitrable dispute\nrequire to be decided and the decision on these aspects is a prelude to\nthe Chief Justice considering whether the requirements of sub-Section\n(4), sub-Section (5) or sub-Section (6) of\nSection 11\nare satisfied when\napproached with the request for appointment of an arbitrator. It is\ndifficult to understand the finality to referred to in\nSection 11(7)\nas\nexcluding the decision on his competence and the locus standi of the\nparty who seeks to invoke his jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator.\nViewed from that angle, the decision on all these aspects rendered by\nthe Chief Justice would attain finality and it is obvious that the decision\non these aspects could be taken only after notice to the parties and after\nhearing them.\n\n38. It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice,\napproached with an application under\nSection 11\nof the Act, is to\ndecide at that stage. Obviously, he has to decide his own jurisdiction\nin the sense, whether the party making the motion has approached the\nright High Court. He has to decide whether there is an arbitration\nagreement, as defined in the Act and whether the person who has made\nthe request before him, is a party to such an agreement. It is necessary\nto indicate that he can also decide the question whether the claim was a\ndead one; or a long barred claim that was sought to be resurrected and\nwhether the parties have concluded the transaction by recording\nsatisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the\nfinal payment without objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to\ndecide whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the\npurview of the arbitration clause. It will be appropriate to leave that\nquestion to be decided by the arbitral tribunal on taking evidence, along\nwith the merits of the claims involved in the arbitration. The Chief\nJustice has to decide whether the applicant has satisfied the conditions\nfor appointing an arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. For the\npurpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the Chief Justice can\neither proceed on the basis of affidavits and the documents produced or\ntake such evidence or get such evidence recorded, as may be necessary.\nWe think that adoption of this procedure in the context of the Act\nwould best serve the purpose sought to be achieved by the Act of\nexpediting the process of arbitration, without too many approaches to\nthe court at various stages of the proceedings before the Arbitral\ntribunal.\n\n39. An aspect that requires to be considered at this stage is the\nquestion whether the Chief Justice of the High Court or the Chief\nJustice of India can designate a non-judicial body or authority to\nexercise the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. We have already\nheld that, obviously, the legislature did not want to confer the power on\nthe Court as defined in the Act, namely, the District Court, and wanted\nto confer the power on the Chief Justices of the High Courts and on the\nChief Justice of India. Taking note of\nSection 5\nof the Act and the\nfinality attached by\nSection 11 (7)\nof the Act to his order and the\nconclusion we have arrived at that the adjudication is judicial in nature,\nit is obvious that no person other than a Judge and no non-judicial body\ncan be designated for entertaining an application for appointing an\narbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act or for appointing an arbitrator.\nIn our dispensation, judicial powers are to be exercised by the judicial\nauthorities and not by non-judicial authorities. This scheme cannot be\ntaken to have been given the go-by by the provisions in the Act in the\nlight of what we have discussed earlier. Therefore, what the Chief\nJustice can do under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is to seek the help of a\nnon-judicial body to point out a suitable person as an arbitrator in the\ncontext of\nSection 11(8)\nof the Act and on getting the necessary\ninformation, if it is acceptable, to name that person as the arbitrator or\nthe set of persons as the arbitral tribunal.\n\n40. Then the question is whether the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt can designate a district judge to perform the functions under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. We have seen the definition of '\nCourt' in\nthe Act\n. We have reasoned that the intention of the legislature was not\nto entrust the duty of appointing an arbitrator to the District Court.\nSince the intention of the statute was to entrust the power to the highest\njudicial authorities in the State and in the country, we have no\nhesitation in holding that the Chief Justice cannot designate a district\njudge to perform the functions under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. This\nrestriction on the power of the Chief Justice on designating a district\njudge or a non-judicial authority flows from the scheme of the Act.\n\n41. In our dispensation of justice, especially in respect of\nmatters entrusted to the ordinary hierarchy of courts or judicial\nauthorities, the duty would normally be performed by a judicial\nauthority according to the normal procedure of that court or of that\nauthority. When the Chief Justice of the High Court is entrusted with\nthe power, he would be entitled to designate another judge of the High\nCourt for exercising that power. Similarly, the Chief Justice of India\nwould be in a position to designate another judge of the Supreme Court\nto exercise the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. When so\nentrusted with the right to exercise such a power, the judge of the High\nCourt and the judge of the Supreme Court would be exercising the\npower vested in the Chief Justice of the High Court or in the Chief\nJustice of India. Therefore, we clarify that the Chief Justice of a High\nCourt can delegate the function under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act to a\njudge of that court and he would actually exercise the power of the\nChief Justice conferred under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. The position\nwould be the same when the Chief Justice of India delegates the power\nto another judge of the Supreme Court and he exercises that power as\ndesignated by the Chief Justice of India.\n\n42. In this context, it has also to be noticed that there is an\nocean of difference between an institution which has no judicial\nfunctions and an authority or person who is already exercising judicial\npower in his capacity as a judicial authority. Therefore, only a judge of\nthe Supreme Court or a judge of the High Court could respectively be\nequated with the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt while exercising power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act as\ndesignated by the Chief Justice. A non-judicial body or institution\ncannot be equated with a Judge of the High Court or a Judge of the\nSupreme Court and it has to be held that the designation contemplated\nby\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is not a designation to an institution that is\nincompetent to perform judicial functions. Under our dispensation a\nnon-judicial authority cannot exercise judicial powers.\n\n43. Once we arrive at the conclusion that the proceeding\nbefore the Chief Justice while entertaining an application under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act is adjudicatory, then obviously, the outcome of that\nadjudication is a judicial order. Once it is a judicial order, the same, as\nfar as the High Court is concerned would be final and the only avenue\nopen to a party feeling aggrieved by the order of the Chief Justice\nwould be to approach to the Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution of India. If it were an order by the Chief Justice of India,\nthe party will not have any further remedy in respect of the matters\ncovered by the order of the Chief Justice of India or the Judge of the\nSupreme Court designated by him and he will have to participate in the\narbitration before the Tribunal only on the merits of the claim.\nObviously, the dispensation in our country, does not contemplate any\nfurther appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court and there\nappears to be nothing objectionable in taking the view that the order of\nthe Chief Justice of India would be final on the matters which are\nwithin his purview, while called upon to exercise his jurisdiction under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act. It is also necessary to notice in this context that\nthis conclusion of ours would really be in aid of quick disposal of\narbitration claims and would avoid considerable delay in the process,\nan object that is sought to be achieved by the Act.\n\n44. It is seen that some High Courts have proceeded on the\nbasis that any order passed by an arbitral tribunal during arbitration,\nwould be capable of being challenged under\nArticle 226\nor 227 of the\nConstitution of India. We see no warrant for such an approach.\n\nSection 37\nmakes certain orders of the arbitral tribunal appealable.\nUnder\nSection 34\n, the aggrieved party has an avenue for ventilating his\ngrievances against the award including any in-between orders that\nmight have been passed by the arbitral tribunal acting under\nSection 16\n\nof the Act. The party aggrieved by any order of the arbitral tribunal,\nunless has a right of appeal under\nSection 37\nof the Act, has to wait\nuntil the award is passed by the Tribunal. This appears to be the\nscheme of the Act. The arbitral tribunal is after all, the creature of a\ncontract between the parties, the arbitration agreement, even though if\nthe occasion arises, the Chief Justice may constitute it based on the\ncontract between the parties. But that would not alter the status of the\narbitral tribunal. It will still be a forum chosen by the parties by\nagreement. We, therefore, disapprove of the stand adopted by some of\nthe High Courts that any order passed by the arbitral tribunal is capable\nof being corrected by the High Court under\nArticle 226\nor 227 of the\nConstitution of India. Such an intervention by the High Courts is not\npermissible.\n\n45. The object of minimizing judicial intervention while the\nmatter is in the process of being arbitrated upon, will certainly be\ndefeated if the High Court could be approached under\nArticle 227\nof\nthe Constitution of India or under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of\nIndia against every order made by the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to indicate that once the arbitration has commenced in the\narbitral tribunal, parties have to wait until the award is pronounced\nunless, of course, a right of appeal is available to them under\nSection 37\n\nof the Act even at an earlier stage.\n\n46. We, therefore, sum up our conclusions as follows:\n\ni) The power exercised by the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt or the Chief Justice of India under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act is not an administrative power. It is a judicial\npower.\n\nii) The power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, in its entirety,\ncould be delegated, by the Chief Justice of the High Court\nonly to another judge of that court and by the Chief Justice\nof India to another judge of the Supreme Court.\n\n(iii) In case of designation of a judge of the High Court or of\nthe Supreme Court, the power that is exercised by the\ndesignated, judge would be that of the Chief Justice as\nconferred by the statute.\n\n(iv) The Chief Justice or the designated judge will have the\nright to decide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the\nearlier part of this judgment. These will be, his own\njurisdiction, to entertain the request, the existence of a\nvalid arbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise of a\nlive claim, the existence of the condition for the exercise\nof his power and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or\narbitrators. The Chief Justice or the judge designated\nwould be entitled to seek the opinion of an institution in\nthe matter of nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of\n\nSection 11(8)\nof the Act if the need arises but the order\nappointing the arbitrator could only be that of the Chief\nJustice or the judge designate.\n\n(v) Designation of a district judge as the authority under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act by the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt is not warranted on the scheme of the Act.\n\n(vi) Once the matter reaches the arbitral tribunal or the sole\narbitrator, the High Court would not interfere with orders\npassed by the arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal during the\ncourse of the arbitration proceedings and the parties could\napproach the court only in terms of\nSection 37\nof the Act\nor in terms of\nSection 34\nof the Act.\n\n(vii) Since an order passed by the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt or by the designated judge of that court is a judicial\norder, an appeal will lie against that order only under\n\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India to the Supreme\nCourt.\n\n(viii) There can be no appeal against an order of the Chief\nJustice of India or a judge of the Supreme Court\ndesignated by him while entertaining an application under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n(ix) In a case where an arbitral tribunal has been constituted by\nthe parties without having recourse to\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nAct, the arbitral tribunal will have the jurisdiction to\ndecide all matters as contemplated by\nSection 16\nof the\nAct.\n\n(x) Since all were guided by the decision of this Court in\nKonkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. & anr. Vs. Rani\nConstruction Pvt. Ltd. [(2000) 8 SCC 159] and orders\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act have been made based on\nthe position adopted in that decision, we clarify that\nappointments of arbitrators or arbitral tribunals thus far\nmade, are to be treated as valid, all objections being left to\nbe decided under\nSection 16\nof the Act. As and from this\ndate, the position as adopted in this judgment will govern\neven pending applications under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n(xi) Where District Judges had been designated by the Chief\nJustice of the High Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act,\nthe appointment orders thus far made by them will be\ntreated as valid; but applications if any pending before\nthem as on this date will stand transferred, to be dealt with\nby the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court or a\nJudge of that court designated by the Chief Justice.\n\n(xii) The decision in Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. & anr. Vs.\nRani Construction Pvt. Ltd. [(2000) 8 SCC 159] is\noverruled.\n\n44. The individual appeals will be posted before the\nappropriate bench for being disposed of in the light of the principles\nsettled by this decision.",
