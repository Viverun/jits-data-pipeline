Opp. Party on 30 August, 2024\n\nAuthor:\nSavitri Ratho\n\nBench:\nSavitri Ratho\n\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF ORISSA AT CUTTACK\nBLAPL No.6665 of 2024\n\nDebendra @ Deba Khilla ..... Petitioner\nMr.Abhas Mohanty, Advocate\nVs.\nState of Odisha ..... Opp. Party\nMr.S.S.Mohapatra, ASC\nCORAM:\nJUSTICE SAVITRI RATHO\n\nORDER\n\n30.08.2024\nOrder No. (Through hybrid mode)\n\n02.\n\n1. This application under\nSection 439\nof Cr.P.C. has been filed by\n\nthe petitioner in connection with Malkangiri P.S. Case No.488 of 2023\n\ncorresponding to Special G.R. Case No.187 of 2023, pending in the\n\nCourt of the learned Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge, Malkangiri for\n\ncommission of offences punishable under\nSections 20 (b) (ii) (C)\n/\n(1) (a)\n/\n27 (a)\nand\nof the N.D.P.S. Act.\n\n2. This case had been listed before me as BLAPL No.10835 of\n\n2023 filed by the co-accused, Ananta Hantal had been dismissed by me\n\non 06.10.2023.\n\n3. The prayer for bail of the petitioner has been rejected vide order\n\ndated 29.05.2024 by the learned Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge,\n\nMalkangiri.\n\n4. While rejecting the prayer for bail, the learned trial Court has\n\nobserved that involvement of the petitioner in Kalimela P.S. Case\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\nNo.121 dated 21.05.2023 prima facie shows that he is a habitual\n\noffender and that two more persons are yet to be arrested and to be\n\nbrought on record.\n\n5. The prosecution allegation in brief is that on 07.09.2023 at about\n\n9.10 a.m. while the S.I. of Police, Malkangiri P.S. alongwith his staff\n\nwere performing day patrolling duty in Padmagiri and Pandripani area,\n\nthey received reliable information that four to five persons had\n\nassembled below one Mahua tree near Telimetla Chowk about 02\n\nK.Ms distance from Padmagiri Chowk and were in possession of\n\ncontraband ganja which they were about to transport to Chhatisgarh.\n\nThe police party reached the spot and apprehended four persons,\n\nnamely, Kamal Lochan Kope, Shyam Sundar Pangi, Ananta Hantal and\n\nRama Kope while three persons escaped from the spot. 150 Kgs of\n\nganja were seized from the possession of four accused persons and on\n\nbeing asked they stated that the present petitioner-Debendra @ Deba\n\nKhilla is the supplier of said ganja and three persons who fled from the\n\nspot were Abhi Sagaria, Mitu Hantal and Durjya Sanabasi. They\n\nfurther stated that they were about to transport the ganja to\n\nChhatisgarh. On search, 05 sacks containing 30 Kgs. each of ganja was\n\nrecovered from their possession. As they could not produce any\n\nauthority for possession of ganja, the ganja was seized and they were\n\narrested.\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n6. Mr.Abhas Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner submits\n\nthat the petitioner is in custody since 30.03.2024 and other than the\n\nconfession of the co-accused, there is no other material to implicate the\n\npetitioner with the said crime. He further submits that the petitioner has\n\none criminal antecedent under\nSection 20 (b) (ii) (C)\nof the NDPS Act\n\nvide Kalimela P.S. Case No.121 of 2023 and he has filed BLAPL\n\nNo.4005 of 2024 in this Court which is pending. His further\n\nsubmission is that since the petitioner is a local man, there is no chance\n\nof his absconding if he is released on bail. He finally submits that in\n\nview of the fact that there has been no recovery of ganja from his\n\npossession, it cannot be said that he is the guilty of the said offence or\n\nthat he is not likely to commit such offence for which\nSection 37\nof the\n\nNDPS Act will not be a bar for releasing him on bail.\n\n7. Mr.S.S.Mohapatra, learned Addl. Standing Counsel opposes the\n\nprayer for bail stating that although in the case diary the I.O. has\n\nmentioned that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent but it is\n\napparent from the rejection order that the petitioner is involved in\n\nKalimela P.S. Case No.121 of 2023 under the\nNDPS Act\n. He further\n\nsubmits that in view of the quantity of ganja seized and as he has one\n\ncriminal antecedent of similar nature,\nSection 37\nof the NDPS Act will\n\nbe attracted in this case for which the petitioner should not be released\n\non bail.\n\nPage 3 of 4\n\n8. Strangely the I.O. has not mentioned the criminal antecedent of\n\nthe petitioner in the case diary but the counsel for the petitioner has\n\nfairly mentioned the antecedent of the petitioner in paragraph-13 of the\n\nbail application - that the petitioner is involved in Kalimela P.S. Case\n\nNo.121 of 2023 where the basis of his implication is the statement of\n\nthe co-accused.\n\n9.\nIn view of the nature of allegations against the petitioner, nature\n\nof his criminal antecedent, the provision of\nSection 37\nof the NDPS\n\nAct and the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nUnion of\n\nIndia v. Ajay Kumar Singh\n: 2023 SCC Online SC 346, I am not\n\ninclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage.\n\n10. The prayer for bail is accordingly rejected.\n\n11. It is open for the petitioner to move for bail afresh in case there\n\nis undue delay in completion of the trial.\n\n12. Copy of this order be sent to the Superintendent of Police,\n\nMalkangiri that he can take action as deemed fit against the person\n\nconcerned for giving incorrect particulars about the criminal\n\nantecedents of the petitioner.\n\n(Savitri Ratho)\nBichi Judge\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nSigned by: BICHITRANANDA SAHOO\n\nDesignation: Secretary\n\nReason: Authentication\n\nLocation: Orissa High Court\n\nDate: 03-Sep-2024 19:40:39\n\nPage 4 of 4",
