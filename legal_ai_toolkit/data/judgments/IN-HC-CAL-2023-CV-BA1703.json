No. 64 of 2021\n\nWith\n\nI.A. No. CAN 3 of 2023\n\nMrs. Nidhi Kedia Nee Chokhani\n\nVersus\n\nSri Abhyudaya Kedia\n\nFor the appellants : Mr. Mr. Dhiraj Trivedi,\nMr. Dwaipayan Basu Mallick,\n\nMs. Sweta Chakraborty.\n\nFor the respondents : Mr. Saptangsu Basu,\n\nMr. Pradip Sancheti,\n\nMr. Subhankar Nag,\n\nMr. Biswajit Chowdhury.\n\nHeard On : 02.08.2023\n\nJudgement Delivered On : 06.09.2023\n\nSupratim Bhattacharya, J.:-\n1. The instant appeal has been preferred by the appellant /defendant/ wife,\n\nbeing aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the Judgment and Order passed\n\nby the Ld. 11th Additional District Court at Alipore, 24 Parganas South in\n\nthe Matrimonial Suit No. 27 of 2010 ( R. No. 1614 of 2016).\n\n2. By the aforementioned Judgment, the Ld. Trial Court has been pleased\n\nto pass a decree of divorce on contest against the\n\nappellant/defendant/wife.\n\n3. The appellant herein was the opposite party and the respondent herein\n\nwas the petitioner respectively before the Learned Trial Court.\n\n4. Through the application under\nSection 13 (1a)\nof the Hindu Marriage Act,\n\n1955, the respondent /plaintiff/husband had sought for divorce on the\n\nground of cruelty.\n\n5. The appellant/defendant/wife entered appearance and contested the suit\n\ndenying the contentions of the respondent/plaintiff/husband.\n\n6. The Ld. Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant/defendant/wife\n\nduring his elaborate submissions has argued on the following points:\n\ni) The impugned judgment has been passed on an erroneous legal\n\nconception. The Ld. Counsel has submitted that the marriage was\n\nsolemnized on 27.01.2008 under Hindu rites and customs and was\n\nregistered on 10.06.2008.\n\nii) He has further submitted that the husband filed the petition for\n\ndivorce during the month of July, 2009.\niii) The Ld. Counsel has also submitted that the appellant/wife has all\n\nalong expressed her intention to live with the respondent/husband\n\nas his wife, on the contrary it is the respondent/husband who has\n\nalways refused to live with the wife.\n\niv) He has further submitted that the appellant/wife still intends to\n\ncontinue the marital ties as she never got the chance to lead a\n\nproper married life with her husband.\n\nv) The Ld. Counsel has also submitted that the appellant/wife had\n\nfiled a complaint before the Karaya P.S. on 08.09.2009 against the\n\nrespondent and his family members which has been registered as\n\nKaraya P.S. case No. 29 of 2009 under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code and ultimately charge-sheet has been\n\nfiled under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\nvi) Ld. Counsel has submitted that the Ld. Trial Court has\n\nerroneously decreed the matrimonial suit on the basis that the fact\n\nof lodging the case under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code\n\nwhich ultimately did not lead to filing of charge-sheet against some\n\nof the family members of the respondent/husband and the\n\ndropping of charge under\nSection 307\nof the Indian Penal Code,\n\ntantamounts to filing of a frivolous case against the respondent\n\nwhich has by itself inflicted mental cruelty upon the husband.\n\nvii) He has further submitted that the said case under Section 498A is\n\nstill pending and as such the Ld. Trial Court could not have\nassumed that cruelty on the part of the respondent/husband stood\n\ndisproved.\n\nviii) He has further submitted that the appellant/wife has never treated\n\nthe respondent/husband with cruelty.\n\nix) The Ld. Counsel has stressed upon the point that allegations of\n\nirretrievable breakdown of marriage levelled by one party cannot\n\nform the basis of grant of decree of divorce.\n\nx) The Ld. Counsel for the appellant/wife has submitted that filing of\n\ncomplaint and eventual acquittal of the husband could not amount\n\nto mental cruelty.\n\nxi) He has further stressed upon the point that marriage cannot be\n\ndissolved on the ground of continuous separation where it involves\n\nnormal wear and tear of marital life. The Ld. Counsel stressing\n\nupon the aforesaid facts and circumstances has prayed for\n\nallowing the instant appeal by setting aside the impugned\n\njudgment.\n\nxii) The Ld. Counsel has relied upon the following judicial authorities:\n\ni) (2014) 1 SCC 225,\n\nii) 2010 SCC 636,\n\niii) (2012) 4 CHN (Cal) 773,\n\niv) (2012) 1 WBLR (Cal) 527,\n\nv) AIR 2020 SC 1198.\n\nvi) (2002) 2 SCC 73.\n7. The Ld. Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondent/petitioner/husband has submitted the following:\n\ni) The Ld. Trial Court has passed the decree of divorce after\n\nconsidering the fact that the wife has inflicted cruelty not only\n\nupon the husband but also upon the relatives of her husband.\n\nii) He has further submitted that the appellant/ wife had been\n\ninflicting cruelty upon her husband and her in-laws since the\n\ninception of the marriage.\n\niii) Ld. Counsel has further submitted that the husband had to\n\ncontinuously bear the torture and could not disclose the said fact\n\nto anybody else.\n\niv) The Ld. Counsel has stressed upon the point that the\n\nappellant/wife has filed the complaint before the Karaya P.S. on 8th\n\nSeptember, 2009. On the basis of the said complaint Karaya P.S.\n\nCase No. 29 of 2009 under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code was initiated against the husband and his\n\nrelatives.\n\nv) Ld. Counsel has also submitted that all the persons including the\n\naged parents of the husband had to obtain bail in the said case. He\n\nhas stressed upon the point that some of the relatives have been\n\ndischarged from the said case as no evidence could be collected by\n\nthe police authority against them, which leads to infliction of\n\ncruelty upon the relatives of the husband, including the husband.\nvi) The Ld. Counsel has further stressed upon the issue that charge\n\nsheet has been filed in the aforesaid case only under\nSections\n\n498A\n/\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code and there being no\n\ningredient under\nSection 307\nof the Indian Penal Code, the said\n\nsection has not been incorporated in the charge-sheet.\n\nvii) The Ld. Counsel has stressed upon the point that the complaint\n\nlodged by the appellant/ wife against the respondent /husband\n\nand his relatives have been lodged after the institution of the\n\nmatrimonial suit by the husband.\n\nviii) Ld. Counsel has stressed upon the point that lodging of the\n\ncomplaint before the Karaya P.S. is nothing but a counterblast\n\nwhich has been made out of vengeance.\n\nix) The Ld. Counsel has further submitted that lodging of the\n\ncomplaint against the husband and his relatives after the\n\ninstitution of the matrimonial suit proves the fact that the facts\n\nwhich have been made the basis of the complaint are not correct,\n\ninstead they are all an afterthought and only to save the face of the\n\nwife these allegations have been incorporated falsely out of revenge\n\nin the said complaint lodged before the Karaya P.S. The Ld.\n\nCounsel has relied upon the following judicial authorities:\n\ni) 2023 SCC Online SC 497,\n\nii) 2021 SCC Online CAL 173,\n\niii) (2013) 5 SCC 226, (2007) 4 SCC 511.\n8. The crux of the instant lis is as to whether the appellant/wife has\n\ninflicted cruelty upon the respondent/husband or not and, if so\n\ncommitted, is it to the extent sufficient in law for a grant of divorce.\n\n9. From the facts of the instant lis it is apparent that the marriage between\n\nthe parties was registered under the\nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\non the\n\n10th day of June 2008 and the parties resided together till 12th of\n\nJanuary 2009. Thus, till date since the date of marriage both the parties\n\nresided together as husband and wife for a maximum period of 7\n\nmonths. Apart from that the appellant and the respondent have been at\n\nloggerheads for more than 14 years.\n\n10. It also reveals that during the meagre span of 7 months when it is\n\nexpected that a duly married couple are expected to share their bonds,\n\ninstead the husband and wife had fought among themselves in each and\n\nevery matter, which included the relatives of both the sides. It cannot be\n\nsaid from any corner that the period of staying together was amicable for\n\nthe parties. Even during honeymoon when the couple had gone to a\n\nforeign country, even then there was discontent between them.\n\n11. There have been allegations and counter allegations from both\n\nends, even the relatives have been dragged into the said quarrel\n\nbetween the parties. From the evidence on record it reveals that even a\n\nFIR was lodged by the appellant/wife on 8th of September 2009 before\n\nthe Karaya P.S. bearing several allegations against the husband and his\n\nfamily members. On the basis of the aforesaid FIR Karaya PS Case No.\n29 of 2009 was started under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code which is now sub judice. In the said case even the aged\n\npersons had to obtain bail and ultimately few have been discharged\n\nbeing not named in the charge-sheet.\nSection 307\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode has also not been incorporated in the charge-sheet.\n\n12. From the evidence on record it reveals that the respondent\n\n/husband has deposed that the appellant/wife suspected him of having\n\nan extra marital affair. He has also deposed that the appellant/wife is a\n\nmean minded lady. The wife has even stated that when she had gone for\n\nshopping she had seen her husband with a woman and the said woman\n\nis said to be one Rashika Gupta. There is severe misunderstanding\n\nbetween the couple involving this woman namely, Rashika Gupta. Even\n\nthe question of physical relationship between the husband and the said\n\nRahsika Gupta has surfaced which does not bring together the warring\n\nparties, instead it forms a gulf of difference between the two.\n\n13. None of the parties has restrained himself or herself from bringing\n\nallegations against the other. The appellant/wife has stated that a sum\n\nof Rs. 60 lakhs was demanded by her father-in-law just two days prior\n\nto their marriage. She has also stated that she had been subjected to\n\nmental and physical torture by her in-laws. The appellant/wife has\n\nnamed a female person, being Rashika Gupta and has stated that her\n\nhusband has physical relationship with her and according to her the\n\nhusband has confessed to the same.\n14. The relatives of both the parties have intervened and have tried to\n\nbroker peace but their efforts have not yielded any fruitful result. From\n\nthe evidence of both the parties it is apparent that the allegations have\n\nbeen multifarious. From the aspect of consumption of food and liquor to\n\nthe aspect of extra marital affair and torture both physical and mental,\n\npressurising for dowry prior to marriage and pressurising for money\n\nafter marriage have all come into the forefront.\n\n15. In the view of this Court both the parties have not even for few\n\ndays resided together peacefully. To the contrary the parties have\n\nallegations against the other from the period starting prior to the\n\nmarriage and which is still now continuing. The FIR lodged by the\n\nappellant/wife in the nature of a counterblast as because the same has\n\nbeen filed after the initiation of the matrimonial suit for divorce.\n\n16. This Court has considered in detail the evidence placed before it.\n\nThe acts of cruelty alleged by the husband against the wife have not\n\nbeen condoned by the former. This Court is ad idem with the Ld. Trial\n\nCourt that mere claims for restoration of marital rights by the wife\n\nwithout regard to withdrawal of her vexatious criminal complaint\n\ncontaining allegations which could not find their place in the charge-\n\nsheet, have not mitigated the element of cruelty suffered by the\n\nhusband.\n\n17. This Court cannot also lose sight of the fact that elderly members\n\nof the husband's family stood discharged from the criminal proceeding\nhaving regard to the frivolity of the charges brought against them. It\n\nneeds no repetition that the criminal complaint was a counterblast to\n\nthe matrimonial suit filed by the husband. It needs no iteration either\n\nthat the parties are continuing with their corrosive and divergent\n\ncourses without any whisper of reconciliation.\n\n18. In view of the facts as made out above, this Court is firmly of the\n\nview that the ratio laid down in the case between Shilpa Sailesh Versus\n\nVarun Sreenivasan published in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 544 squarely\n\napplies to the present lis. The following paragraphs of the Report\n\n(supra) demonstrate such applicability:\n\n\"33. ... Thus, there is a distinction between intention to commit\ncruelty and the actual act of cruelty, as absence of intention may\nnot, in a given case, make any difference if the act complained of is\notherwise regarded as cruel. Deliberate and wilful intention,\ntherefore, may not matter. Paragraph 16 of the judgment in V.\nBhagat (supra) reads as under:\n\n16. Mental cruelty in\nSection 13(1)\n(i-a) can broadly be\ndefined as that conduct which inflicts upon the other party\nsuch mental pain and suffering as would make it not\npossible for that party to live with the other. In other\nwords, mental cruelty must be of such a nature that the\nparties cannot reasonably be expected to live together. The\nsituation must be such that the wronged party cannot\nreasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and\ncontinue to live with the other party. It is not necessary to\nprove that the mental cruelty is such as to cause injury to\nthe health of the petitioner. While arriving at such\nconclusion, regard must be had to the social status,\neducational level of the parties, the society they move in,\nthe possibility or otherwise of the parties ever living\ntogether in case they are already living apart and all other\nrelevant facts and circumstances which it is neither\npossible nor desirable to set out exhaustively. What is\ncruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another\ncase. It is a matter to be determined in each case having\nregard to the facts and circumstances of that case. If it is a\ncase of accusations and allegations, regard must also be\nhad to the context in which they were made.\n\n35.\nIn\nAshok Hurra v. Rupa Bipin Zaveri\n, decided in 1997, this\nCourt was confronted with a situation where the marriage had\nfallen apart and the couple had separated in 1983. They did not\nhave any specific issue, but difference of opinion had cropped up\nbetween the parties. Further, even after residing separately for\nthirteen years, the parties were not agreeable to a divorce by\nmutual consent. This was in spite of the fact that the husband had\nremarried and had a child. This Court was of the view that\nconsidering the cumulative effect of various factors and the\nmarriage being dead, no useful purpose, both emotionally and\npractically, would be served in postponing the inevitability and\nprolonging the agony of the parties or their marriage and,\ntherefore, the curtain should be rung down.\n\n36.\nIn\nNaveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli\n, a three judges' bench of this\nCourt referred to the opinion of Lord Denning, L.J.\nin Kaslefsky v. Kaslefsky that if the door of cruelty were opened\ntoo wide, the courts would be granting divorce for incompatibility of\ntemperament, but this temptation must be resisted, lest the\ninstitution of marriage is imperiled ...\n\n...Moreover, mental cruelty is difficult to establish by direct\nevidence and is to be deciphered by attending to the facts and\ncircumstances in which the two partners in matrimony had been\nliving. On the question of irretrievable breakdown of marriage,\nwhich is not a ground for divorce under the\nHindu Marriage Act\n,\nreference was made to the fault theory, which is hinged on an\naccusatorial principle of divorce. Excessive reliance on fault as a\nground for divorce, the judges' opined, encourages matrimonial\noffences, increases bitterness and widens the ongoing rift between\nthe parties. Once serious endeavours for reconciliation have been\nmade, but it is found that the separation is inevitable and the\ndamage is irreparable, divorce should not be withheld. An\nunworkable marriage, which has ceased to be effective, is futile\nand bound to be a source of greater misery for the parties.\n\n41. ...That the marriage has irretrievably broken down is to be\nfactually determined and firmly established. For this, several\nfactors are to be considered such as the period of time the parties\nhad cohabited after marriage; when the parties had last cohabited;\nthe nature of allegations made by the parties against each other\nand their family members; the orders passed in the legal\nproceedings from time to time, cumulative impact on the personal\nrelationship; whether, and how many attempts were made to\nsettle the disputes by intervention of the court or through\nmediation, and when the last attempt was made, etc. The period of\nseparation should be sufficiently long, and anything above six\nyears or more will be a relevant factor. But these facts have to be\nevaluated keeping in view the economic and social status of the\nparties, including their educational qualifications, whether the\nparties have any children, their age, educational qualification, and\nwhether the other spouse and children are dependent, in which\nevent how and in what manner the party seeking divorce intends\nto take care and provide for the spouse or the children.\"\n\n19. Further reliance may be usefully placed on the Judgment passed by the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case between\nSavitri Pandey Vs. Prem Chandra\nPandey\n, published in (2002) 2 SCC 73 wherein Paragraphs 6 and 16 read as\nfollows:\n\"6. Treating the petitioner with cruelty is a ground for divorce\nunder\nSection 13(1)\n(i-a) of the Act. Cruelty has not been defined\nunder the Act but in relation to matrimonial matters it is\ncontemplated as a conduct of such type which endangers the living\nof the petitioner with the respondent. Cruelty consists of acts\nwhich are dangerous to life, limb or health. Cruelty for the purpose\nof the Act means where one spouse has so treated the other and\nmanifested such feelings towards her or him as to have inflicted\nbodily injury, or to have caused reasonable apprehension of bodily\ninjury, suffering or to have injured health. Cruelty may be physical\nor mental. Mental cruelty is the conduct of other spouse which\ncauses mental suffering or fear to the matrimonial life of the other.\n\"Cruelty\", therefore, postulates a treatment of the petitioner with\nsuch cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his or her\nmind that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live\nwith the other party. Cruelty, however, has to be distinguished\nfrom the ordinary wear and tear of family life. It cannot be decided\non the basis of the sensitivity of the petitioner and has to be\nadjudged on the basis of the course of conduct which would, in\ngeneral, be dangerous for a spouse to live with the other. In the\ninstant case both the trial court as well as the High Court have\nfound on facts that the wife had failed to prove the allegations of\ncruelty attributed to the respondent. Concurrent findings of fact\narrived at by the courts cannot be disturbed by this Court in\nexercise of powers under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India.\nOtherwise also the averments made in the petition and the\nevidence led in support thereof clearly show that the allegations,\neven if held to have been proved, would only show the sensitivity\nof the appellant with respect to the conduct of the respondent\nwhich cannot be termed more than ordinary wear and tear of the\nfamily life.\n\n16. This Court in\nJorden Diengdeh v. S.S. Chopra\n[(1985) 3 SCC 62\n: AIR 1985 SC 935] suggested for a complete reform of law of\nmarriage and to make a uniform law applicable to all people\nirrespective of religion or caste. The Court observed: (SCC pp. 71-\n72, para 7)\n\nIt appears to be necessary to introduce irretrievable breakdown of\nmarriage and mutual consent as grounds of divorce in all cases. ...\nThere is no point or purpose to be served by the continuance of a\nmarriage which has so completely and signally broken down. We\nsuggest that the time has come for the intervention of legislature in\nthese matters to provide for a uniform code of marriage and divorce\nand to provide by law for a way out of the unhappy situations in\nwhich couples like the present have found themselves in.\"\n\n20. In the backdrop of the above discussion, the appeal fails. This Court finds\n\nno reason to interfere with the Judgment and Order passed by the Ld. Trial\n\nCourt. F.A. No. 64 of 2021 with I.A. No. CAN 3 of 2023 stand accordingly\n\ndismissed.\n\n21. Parties shall be entitled to act on the basis of the server copy of the\n\njudgment and order placed on the official website of the Court.\n\n22. Urgent Xerox certified photo copies of this judgment, if applied for, be given\n\nto the parties upon compliance of the requisite formalities.\n\nI agree,\n\n(Supratim Bhattacharya, J.)
