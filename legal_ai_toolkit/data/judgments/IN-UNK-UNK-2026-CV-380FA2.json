Leave granted.\n\n2. The issues arising in the present appeal are whether the\n\nservice of notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 19961 on a person and joinder of\n\nsuch person in the application under Section 11 for appointment\n\nof arbitrator are prerequisites for an arbitral tribunal to exercise\n\njurisdiction over him, and further, when can an arbitral tribunal\n\nimplead a person to the arbitration proceedings. In the present\n\ncase, the arbitral tribunal, while determining its own jurisdiction\n\nunder Section 16, took the view that service of a Section 21 notice\n\nand being made party to the Section 11 application are mandatory\n\nrequirements for a person/entity to be made party to the arbitral\n\nproceedings. By the impugned order, the High Court has affirmed\n\nand upheld this reasoning in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction\n\nunder Section 37, from which the present appeal arises. Upon\n\nconsideration of the purpose and scope of a Section 21 notice and\n\nSection 11 application, as well as the source of the arbitral\n\ntribunal’s jurisdiction being the arbitration agreement and the\n\nprinciple of kompetenz-kompetenz under Section 16 of the ACA, we\n\nhave allowed the present appeal by answering the issues as\n\n1\n\n Hereinafter “the ACA”.\n\n 2\n\n\ffollows: First, while a notice invoking arbitration under Section 21\n\nis mandatory and fulfils various purposes by fixing the date of\n\ncommencement of arbitral proceedings, non-service of such notice\n\non a person does not preclude his impleadment in the arbitral\n\nproceedings. Second, the purpose of an application under Section\n\n11 is simply the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, which is\n\npursuant to a limited and prima facie examination by the referral\n\ncourt. The order appointing the arbitrator does not limit the\n\narbitral tribunal’s terms of reference or scope of jurisdiction. Third,\n\nthe arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction over a person/entity is derived\n\nfrom their consent to the arbitration agreement. Hence, the proper\n\ninquiry in an application under Section 16 is whether such person\n\nis a party to the arbitration agreement. Fourth, in the facts of the\n\npresent case, an arbitration agreement exists between the\n\nappellant and respondent nos. 2 and 3, and hence they can be\n\nimpleaded as parties to the arbitral proceedings.\n\n3. Facts: The facts that are relevant for our purpose are as\n\nfollows. The appellant and respondent no. 1 entered into an\n\nagreement dated 01.06.2012 to form a Limited Liability\n\nPartnership 2 by the name of Vishal Capricorn Energy Services LLP,\n\n2\n\n Hereinafter “LLP”.\n\n 3\n\n\fwhich is respondent no. 2 herein, to carry out various oil and gas\n\nsector projects. It is relevant to note at this stage that only the\n\nappellant and respondent no. 1 are signatories to the LLP\n\nAgreement. Clause 8 of the LLP Agreement provides that Mr.\n\nKishore Krishnamoorthy, who is respondent no. 3 herein, shall be\n\ndesignated as the Chief Executive Officer of the LLP and will be\n\nresponsible for administration of business and looking after the\n\nexecution of contracts. It is relevant that respondent no. 3 is also\n\na director of respondent no. 1 company. Further, Clause 40 of the\n\nLLP Agreement provides for dispute resolution through arbitration\n\nin the following terms:\n\n “40. Disputes or differences, if any, that may arise between partners\n inter se and/ or between the partner(s) and LLP hereto or their\n affiliates, assigns, successors, attorneys, administrators and all\n those claiming through it touching these presents or the construction\n thereof or any clause or thing herein contained or otherwise or in any\n way relating to or concerning these presents or the rights, duties or\n liabilities of any of the partners hereto in connection therewith the\n matters in such dispute or difference shall be referred to the\n arbitration in accordance with and subject to the provisions of\n \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n or to any statutory modification\n or reenactment thereof for the time being in force. The venue of the\n Arbitration shall be decided by the Arbitrator so appointed by mutual\n consent of both partners.”\n\n3.1 By letter of award dated 31.12.2012, Oil India Ltd. awarded\n\na contract for augmentation of storage capacity at ITF, Tenughat,\n\nAssam to a consortium, of which respondent no. 1 was a member.\n\nBy agreement dated 08.01.2013, the consortium sub-contracted\n\n 4\n\n\fthe ITF Project to respondent no. 1. Pursuantly, the appellant and\n\nrespondent no. 1 entered into a Supplementary Agreement and a\n\nMemorandum of Understanding3, both dated 29.01.2013, for\n\nexecution of the ITF Project through respondent no. 2. The\n\nappellant infused funds of Rs. 1.1 crores for the execution of this\n\nProject.\n\n3.2 Disputes arose in 2018 when the appellant sought\n\ndocuments and information to audit respondent no. 2’s accounts\n\nin relation to the ITF Project. The appellant then issued demand\n\nnotices dated 11.10.2019 and 20.12.2019 to respondent no. 1 for\n\npayment of Rs. 7.31 crores towards reconciliation of accounts of\n\nthe LLP. Subsequently, on 17.11.2020, the appellant issued a\n\nnotice invoking arbitration under Clause 40 of the LLP Agreement.\n\nIt is relevant that this notice was issued only to respondent no. 1\n\nthrough its Director, respondent no. 3. The appellant then filed a\n\nSection 11\n application for appointment of arbitrator, impleading\n\nonly respondent no. 1 as a party. The High Court, by order dated\n\n24.11.2021, appointed a sole arbitrator “to adjudicate the disputes\n\nthat are stated to have arisen between the parties out of the LLP\n\n3\n\n Hereinafter “MoU”.\n\n 5\n\n\fAgreement dated 01st June, 2012 read with Supplementary LLP\n\nAgreement and MoU both dated 29th January, 2013.”\n\n3.3 After the arbitrator entered reference, the appellant filed its\n\nstatement of claim, wherein it also impleaded respondent nos. 2\n\nand 3 as parties to the arbitration. However, at the time of filing,\n\nthe prayer clause was restricted to respondent no. 1. Respondent\n\nnos. 1-3 then filed an application under \nSection 16\n of the ACA,\n\nraising various objections to the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction.\n\nThe most relevant objection for our purpose is that the arbitration\n\nis not maintainable against respondent nos. 2 and 3 as they were\n\nnot parties to the notice invoking arbitration under \nSection 21\n or\n\nthe application for appointment of arbitrator under \nSection 11\n.\n\nFurther, it was contended that the arbitration agreement\n\ncontained in Clause 40 of the LLP Agreement does not bind\n\nrespondent no. 2, which is itself a creature of the LLP Agreement,\n\nand respondent no. 3 as he was not a party to the LLP Agreement\n\nin his individual capacity.\n\n3.4 In the meanwhile, the appellant preferred an application\n\nunder \nSection 23(3)\n of the ACA to amend the statement of claim in\n\norder to bring on record a detailed memo of parties and to amend\n\nthe prayer clause to include respondent nos. 2 and 3 as well. The\n\n 6\n\n\fappellant’s application for amendment was allowed by the arbitral\n\ntribunal’s order dated 01.08.2023 on the ground that these are\n\nministerial amendments that do not change the averments in the\n\noriginal statement of claim.\n\n4. Arbitral Tribunal’s Decision on the \nSection 16\n Application: By\n\norder dated 15.02.2024, the arbitral tribunal allowed the\n\napplication under \nSection 16\n and held that the arbitral\n\nproceedings against respondent nos. 2 and 3 are not maintainable.\n\nThe reasoning of the arbitral tribunal is that in the absence of the\n\nnotice invoking arbitration being served on respondent nos. 2 and\n\n3, as well as considering that the High Court did not refer them to\n\narbitration while allowing the \nSection 11\n application, the arbitral\n\ntribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over them. The arbitral\n\ntribunal also rejected the appellant’s argument regarding its own\n\ncompetence to implead non-signatories as necessary parties by\n\nholding that there is no finding that respondent nos. 2 and 3 are\n\nessential for effective adjudication of disputes.\n\n5. Impugned Order: The appellant’s appeal under \nSection\n\n37(2)(a)\n of the ACA against the arbitral tribunal’s order was\n\ndismissed by the High Court’s order dated 08.07.2024, which is\n\nimpugned herein. The High Court proceeded on a similar basis and\n\n 7\n\n\fheld that since the \nSection 21\n notice and the \nSection 11\n\napplication do not raise any disputes against respondent nos. 2\n\nand 3, and they are not included as parties therein, the appellant\n\ncannot be permitted to subsequently raise disputes against them\n\nin the statement of claim.\n\n6. Submissions: We have heard Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned\n\nsenior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Varun Kanwal, learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents.\n\n6.1 Mr. Agrawal has submitted that: First, as per the principle of\n\nkompetenz-kompetenz enshrined in \nSection 16\n of the ACA, the\n\narbitral tribunal has the power to implead parties (signatories or\n\nnon-signatories) even after reference to arbitration if the disputes\n\ninvolving them arise from the same agreement.4 In the present\n\nfacts, respondent nos. 2 and 3 ought to be impleaded for complete\n\nadjudication of disputes, considering their intentional and\n\nconsensual involvement in the performance of the LLP Agreement,\n\nSupplementary Agreement, and MoU as well as execution of the\n\nITF Project. Second, they are bound by the arbitration agreement\n\nin Clause 40 of the LLP Agreement as it specifically refers to\n\ndisputes between the partners and the LLP (respondent no. 2), and\n\n4\n\n Relied on \nCox and Kings Ltd. v. SAP India (P) Ltd.\n, (2024) 4 SCC 1.\n\n 8\n\n\fthe partners and the administrator (respondent no. 3). Further,\n\neven \nSection 23(4)\n of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008\n\nread with Schedule I provides for arbitration between the LLP and\n\nits partners. Third, given the intertwined roles of the respondents,\n\nthe absence of a separate notice under \nSection 21\n being issued to\n\nthem does not bar the appellant from impleading them in the\n\narbitral claim as they had constructive notice through respondent\n\nno. 1 upon whom such notice was served.\n\n6.2 Mr. Kanwal, on the other hand, has submitted that the issue\n\nfor consideration is not the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction to\n\nimplead a non-signatory. Rather, it is whether a person/entity that\n\nhas not been served with a notice under \nSection 21\n, and has not\n\nbeen referred to arbitration by the court under \nSection 11\n of the\n\nACA, can be made a party to the arbitral proceedings. His\n\nsubmissions are as follows: First, this Court’s decision in \nCox and\n\nKings\n (supra) is not applicable to the facts of the case, and has\n\nrightly been distinguished as neither the arbitral tribunal nor the\n\nHigh Court have found that respondent nos. 2 and 3 are necessary\n\nparties for effective adjudication of disputes. Second, that\n\nrespondent nos. 2 and 3 are not bound by the arbitration\n\nagreement as they are not parties to the same. Third, that the\n\n 9\n\n\fproceedings against respondent nos. 2 and 3 are contrary to\n\nprinciples of natural justice as they were not served with any notice\n\nor impleaded in the \nSection 11\n application.\n\n7. Issues: Given the factual background and submissions of the\n\nparties, there are two questions of law that can be framed for our\n\nconsideration:\n\n I. Whether service of a \nSection 21\n notice and joinder in a\n\n \nSection 11\n application are prerequisites to implead a\n\n person/entity as a party to the arbitral proceedings?\n\n II. What is the source of jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal\n\n over a person/entity who is sought to be impleaded as a\n\n party to the arbitral proceedings? As a corollary, what is\n\n the relevant inquiry that the arbitral tribunal must\n\n undertake when determining its own jurisdiction under\n\n \nSection 16\n of the ACA?\n\n7.1 After analysing and answering these legal issues, we will\n\nexamine the facts and the material on record in the present case\n\nto determine whether respondent nos. 2 and 3 can be made parties\n\nto the arbitral proceedings.\n\n8. Notice Invoking Arbitration under \nSection 21\n of the ACA:\n\nSection 21\n falls under Part I, Chapter V of the ACA, which deals\n\n 10\n\n\fwith “Conduct of arbitral proceedings”. The provision is extracted\n\nhereinbelow for reference:\n\n “21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings.—Unless otherwise\n agreed by the parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a\n particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that\n dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.”\n\n9. A plain reading of the provision shows that in the absence of\n\nan agreement between the parties, arbitral proceedings are\n\ndeemed to have commenced when the respondent receives a\n\nrequest to refer disputes to arbitration. It is clear that \nSection 21\n\ndoes not expressly mandate the claimant to send a notice invoking\n\narbitration to the respondents. However, the provision necessarily\n\nmandates such notice as its receipt by the respondent is required\n\nto commence arbitral proceedings, unless the parties have\n\nmutually agreed on another date/event for determining when the\n\narbitral proceedings have commenced.\n\n10. This Court has expounded the purpose and object underlying\n\nthe notice referenced in \nSection 21\n in several judgments, which\n\ncan be stated as follows:\n\n10.1 First, the notice is necessary to determine whether claims are\n\nwithin the period of limitation or are time-barred. \nSection 43(1)\n of\n\nthe ACA stipulates that the \nLimitation Act, 1963\n shall apply to\n\narbitrations as it applies to court proceedings. Further, \nSection\n\n 11\n\n43(2)\n provides that for the purpose of the \nLimitation Act\n, an\n\narbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date\n\nreferred to in \nSection 21\n. Hence, the date of receipt of the \nSection\n\n21\n notice is used to determine whether a dispute has been raised\n\nwithin the limitation period as specified in the \nSchedule to the\n\nLimitation Act\n, as held by this Court in \nMilkfood Ltd. v. GMC Ice\n\nCream (P) Ltd.5\n and \nState of Goa v. Praveen Enterprises\n 6.\n\n10.2 Second, the date of receipt of notice is also relevant to\n\ndetermine the applicable law to the arbitral proceedings.\n \nThis can\n\nbe understood in two senses: (i) When the arbitral proceedings are\n\ngoverned by a law that is different from the proper law of the\n\ncontract, the governing law applies only after the arbitral\n\nproceedings have commenced, as held in \nMilkfood Ltd\n (supra) 7.\n\nAnd, (ii) Section 85(2)(a) of the ACA provides that the \nArbitration\n\nAct, 1940\n and \nForeign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act,\n\n1961\n will apply to arbitral proceedings that commenced prior to\n\nthe ACA coming into force, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\nHence, the date of invoking arbitration is necessary to determine\n\nwhich arbitration law applies to the proceedings as per the\n\n5\n\n (2004) 7 SCC 288, paras 26, 29\n\n6\n\n (2012) 12 SCC 581, paras 16, 18.\n\n7\n\nMilkfood Ltd\n (supra), para 31.\n\n 12\n\n\fdecisions in \nMilkfood Ltd\n (supra) 8 and \nGeo-Miller & Co (P) Ltd. v.\n\nChairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.9 Similarly\n, the\n\napplicability of amendments to the ACA to arbitral proceedings is\n\ndetermined by reference to the date on which such proceedings\n\ncommenced as per \nSection 21\n.10\n\n10.3 Third, an application before the High Court or this Court\n\nunder \nSection 11(6)\n of the ACA for appointment of arbitrator can\n\nbe filed only after the respondent has failed to act as per the\n\nappointment procedure in the arbitration agreement. Hence,\n\ninvocation of arbitration as provided in \nSection 21\n, and the\n\nsubsequent failure of the respondent to appoint its arbitrator or\n\nagree to the appointment of a sole arbitrator as provided in\n\nSections 11(4)\n and \n11(5)\n, are necessary for invoking the court’s\n\njurisdiction under \nSection 11\n. This is as per the decision of this\n\nCourt in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. 11 Further, the\n\nlimitation period within which the \nSection 11\n application must be\n\nfiled is also calculated with reference to the date on which the\n\nappointment procedure under the arbitration agreement fails. 12\n\n8\n\n ibid, paras 46, 49, 70.\n\n9\n\n (2020) 14 SCC 643, para 10.\n\n10\n\n For example, the applicability of the \nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n to arbitral\nproceedings depends on whether the notice invoking arbitration was issued before or after the amendment came\ninto force. See BCCI v. Kochi Cricket (P) Ltd., (2018) 6 SCC 287, paras 38-39.\n\n11\n\n (2021) 5 SCC 738, para 15.\n\n12\n\n ibid, para 16.\n\n 13\n\n\f11. It is clear that by fixing the date of commencement of arbitral\n\nproceedings by anchoring the same to a notice invoking\n\narbitration, \nSection 21\n of the ACA fulfils various objects that are\n\ntime-related. The receipt of such notice is determinative of the\n\nlimitation period for substantive disputes as well as the \nSection 11\n\napplication, and also the law applicable to the arbitration\n\nproceedings.\n\n12. In this case, a \nSection 21\n notice was undisputedly issued by\n\nthe appellant under Clause 40 of the LLP Agreement on\n\n17.11.2020; but the problem arises because this notice was issued\n\nonly to respondent no. 1. However, there is nothing in the wording\n\nof the provision or the scheme of the ACA to indicate that merely\n\nbecause such notice was not served on respondent nos. 2 and 3,\n\nthey cannot be impleaded as parties to the arbitral proceedings.\n\nThe relevant considerations for joining them as parties to the\n\narbitration will be discussed at a later stage.\n\n13. At this point, it is important to note this Court’s decision in\n\nState of Goa v. Praveen Enterprises\n (supra) wherein it was held that\n\nthe claims and disputes raised in the notice under \nSection 21\n do\n\nnot restrict and limit the claims that can be raised before the\n\narbitral tribunal. The consequence of not raising a claim in the\n\n 14\n\n\fnotice is only that the limitation period for such claim that is raised\n\nbefore the arbitral tribunal for the first time will be calculated\n\ndifferently vis-a-vis claims raised in the notice. However, non-\n\ninclusion of certain disputes in the \nSection 21\n notice does not\n\npreclude a claimant from raising them during the arbitration, as\n\nlong as they are covered under the arbitration agreement. Further,\n\nmerely because a respondent did not issue a notice raising\n\ncounter-claims, he is not precluded from raising the same before\n\nthe arbitral tribunal, as long as such counter-claims fall within the\n\nscope of the arbitration agreement. 13\n\n14. A similar rationale may be adopted in this case as well,\n\nespecially considering the clear purpose served by a \nSection 21\n\nnotice. Extending this logic, non-service of the notice under\n\nSection 21\n and the absence of disputes being raised against\n\nrespondent nos. 2 and 3 in the appellant’s notice dated 17.11.2020\n\ndo not automatically bar their impleadment as parties to the\n\narbitration proceedings.\n\n15. Appointment of Arbitrator by the Court under \nSection 11\n: The\n\nother reason provided by the arbitral tribunal and the High Court\n\nin this case is that respondent nos. 2 and 3 were not made parties\n\n13\n\nPraveen Enterprises\n (supra), paras 19-20, 26.\n\n 15\n\n\fin the appellant’s \nSection 11\n application. Consequently, the High\n\nCourt order appointing the arbitrator only refers the appellant and\n\nrespondent no. 1 to arbitration, and the arbitration is maintainable\n\nonly qua both of them. We find that this line of reasoning must\n\nalso be rejected in light of the purpose of a \nSection 11\n application\n\nand the scope of inquiry by the courts while deciding such\n\napplication. The relevant portion of \nSection 11\n reads as follows:\n\n “11. Appointment of arbitrators.—\n (6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the\n parties,—\n\n (a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or\n\n (b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an\n agreement expected of them under that procedure; or\n\n (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function\n entrusted to him or it under that procedure,\n a party may request [the Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the\n High Court or any person or institution designated by such Court] to\n take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on the\n appointment procedure provides other means for securing the\n appointment.\n\n (6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while\n considering any application under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or\n sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\n of any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an\n arbitration agreement.”\n\n16. As has been stated above, a \nSection 11\n application can be\n\npreferred by a party when the procedure for appointment\n\nstipulated in the arbitration agreement fails. It is relevant that\n\nSection 11\n falls under Part I, Chapter III of the ACA that deals with\n\n“Composition of arbitral tribunal”. The statutory scheme, along\n\nwith the clear wording of \nSection 11(6)\n, evidences that the purpose\n\n 16\n\n\fof this application is for the court to take “necessary measure”, in\n\nthe absence of any other means in the arbitration agreement, “for\n\nsecuring the appointment” of the arbitral tribunal. By constituting\n\nthe arbitral tribunal when there is a deadlock or failure of the\n\nparties or the appointed arbitrators to act as per the arbitration\n\nagreement, the court only gives effect to the mutual intention of\n\nthe parties to refer their disputes to arbitration. 14\n\n17. It is also relevant to note that while deciding such an\n\napplication under \nSection 11(6)\n, the High Court or this Court, as\n\nthe case may be, undertakes a limited examination as per \nSection\n\n11(6A)\n. The court’s jurisdiction is confined to a prima facie\n\nexamination, without conducting a mini-trial or laborious and\n\ncontested inquiry, into the existence of the arbitration agreement,\n\ni.e., whether there exists a contract to refer disputes that have\n\narisen between the parties to arbitration. 15 Further, any\n\nexamination into the validity of the arbitration agreement must be\n\nrestricted to the requirement of “formal validity”, i.e., whether the\n\nrequirements of a written agreement under \nSection 7\n of the ACA\n\nare satisfied. 16 Beyond this, the court must leave it to the arbitral\n\n14\n\n Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements under \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n & \nStamp Act, 1899\n, In\nre, (2024) 6 SCC 1, para 150; SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1754,\npara 122.\n\n15\n\n In re, Interplay (supra), paras 164-167.\n\n16\n\n ibid, para 165; SBI General Insurance (supra), para 110.\n\n 17\n\n\ftribunal to “rule” on and adjudicate the existence and validity of\n\nthe arbitration agreement on the basis of evidence adduced by the\n\nparties, in accordance with the principle under \nSection 16\n of the\n\nACA.17\n\n18. More specifically, in respect of determining parties to the\n\narbitral proceedings, the Constitution Bench in \nCox and Kings\n\n(supra) delineated the role of the court in a \nSection 11\n application\n\nin the context of non-signatories as parties to the arbitration\n\nagreement as follows:\n\n “169. In case of joinder of non-signatory parties to an arbitration\n agreement, the following two scenarios will prominently emerge : first,\n where a signatory party to an arbitration agreement seeks joinder of\n a non-signatory party to the arbitration agreement; and second,\n where a non-signatory party itself seeks invocation of an arbitration\n agreement. In both the scenarios, the referral court will be required to\n prima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration agreement and\n whether the non-signatory is a veritable party to the arbitration\n agreement. In view of the complexity of such a determination, the\n referral court should leave it for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide\n whether the non-signatory party is indeed a party to the arbitration\n agreement on the basis of the factual evidence and application of\n legal doctrine. The Tribunal can delve into the factual, circumstantial,\n and legal aspects of the matter to decide whether its jurisdiction\n extends to the non-signatory party. In the process, the Tribunal\n should comply with the requirements of principles of natural justice\n such as giving opportunity to the non-signatory to raise objections\n with regard to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. This\n interpretation also gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-\n competence by leaving the issue of determination of true parties to an\n arbitration agreement to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under\n \nSection 16\n.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n17\n\n In re, Interplay (supra), para 167, 169; SBI General Insurance (supra), para 111.\n\n 18\n\n\fTherefore, the determination of whether certain persons are\n\nparties to the arbitration agreement, and consequently, whether\n\nthey can be made party to the arbitration proceedings, is left to the\n\narbitral tribunal. While the \nSection 11\n court can return a prima\n\nfacie finding on this issue, the same does not bind the arbitral\n\ntribunal, which must decide the issue based on evidence and the\n\napplicable legal principles.18 The determination of this issue goes\n\nto the very root of the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction, and hence, is\n\ncovered under \nSection 16\n of the ACA.19\n\n19. It is also relevant to take note of this Court’s decision in\n\nPraveen Enterprises\n (supra), wherein it held that when a court\n\nappoints the arbitral tribunal under \nSection 11\n, the arbitral\n\ntribunal’s terms of reference are not restricted to specific disputes\n\nreferred by the court, unless the arbitration agreement itself\n\nrequires the court to formulate and refer disputes to arbitration.20\n\n20. Considering the purpose of a \nSection 11\n application for\n\nconstitution of an arbitral tribunal and the limited scope of\n\nexamination into the existence of the arbitration agreement and\n\nprima facie finding on who are parties to it, it follows that the court\n\n18\n\n Also see Ajay Madhusudan Patel v. Jyotrindra S. Patel, (2025) 2 SCC 147, para 75.\n\n19\n\n ibid, paras 73, 76.7.\n\n20\n\nPraveen Enterprises\n (supra), paras 28-29.\n \nAlso see \nBharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Go Airlines (India)\nLtd.\n, (2019) 10 SCC 250.\n\n 19\n\n\funder \nSection 11\n does not conclusively determine or rule on who\n\ncan be made party to the arbitral proceedings. Therefore, merely\n\nbecause respondent nos. 2 and 3 were not parties before the High\n\nCourt under \nSection 11\n, and disputes against them were not\n\nreferred to the arbitrator by order dated 24.11.2021, it does not\n\nmean that they cannot be impleaded at a later stage on this ground\n\nalone.\n\n21. Source of the Arbitral Tribunal’s Jurisdiction and Relevant\n\nInquiry under \nSection 16\n: At this stage, it is clear that not being\n\nserved with a \nSection 21\n notice and not being made a party in the\n\nSection 11\n application are not sufficient grounds to hold that a\n\nperson cannot be made party to arbitral proceedings. We will now\n\ndeal with the next question, i.e., when can a person be made party\n\nto the arbitration proceedings?\n\n22. This issue deals with the source of the arbitral tribunal’s\n\njurisdiction, which is derived from the consent of the parties to\n\nrefer disputes to arbitration. 21 Such consent must be gathered\n\nfrom the arbitration agreement,22 that must in accordance with\n\nSection 7\n of the ACA, which provides:\n\n21\n\n \nGovind Rubber Ltd. v. Louis Dreyfus Commodities Asia (P) Ltd.\n, (2015) 13 SCC 477, para 22; \nCox and Kings\n\n(supra), para 69 (Chandrachud, J).\n\n22\n\n ONGC Ltd. v. Afcons Gunanusa JV, (2024) 4 SCC 481, para 263.\n\n 20\n\n\f “7. Arbitration agreement.—(1) In this Part, “arbitration\n agreement” means an agreement by the parties to submit to\n arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may\n arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether\n contractual or not.\n\n (2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration\n clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.\n (3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.\n (4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in—\n\n (a) a document signed by the parties;\n\n (b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of\n telecommunication [including communication through electronic\n means] which provide a record of the agreement; or\n\n (c) an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the\n existence of the agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by\n the other.\n\n (5) The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration\n clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing\n and the reference is such as to make that arbitration clause part of\n the contract.”\n\n23. Once a person consents to refer disputes to arbitration, and\n\nenters into an arbitration agreement under \nSection 7\n, he is bound\n\nby the same. The implication of being a party to the arbitration\n\nagreement is that such person has contractually undertaken to\n\nresolve any disputes referenced in the arbitration agreement\n\nthrough the agreed upon method of dispute resolution, i.e.,\n\narbitration. It is under this contractual obligation that a person\n\ncan be impleaded as a party to the arbitral proceedings, even if he\n\nwas not served with a \nSection 21\n notice and not referred to\n\narbitration by the court under \nSection 11\n.\n\n24. As briefly stated above, the determination of who is a party to\n\nthe arbitration agreement falls within the domain of the arbitral\n\n 21\n\n\ftribunal as per \nSection 16\n of the ACA. \nSection 16\n embodies the\n\ndoctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz, i.e., that the arbitral tribunal\n\ncan determine its own jurisdiction. The provision is inclusive and\n\ncovers all jurisdictional questions, including the existence and\n\nvalidity of the arbitration agreement, who is a party to the\n\narbitration agreement, and the scope of disputes referrable to\n\narbitration under the agreement. 23 Considering that the arbitral\n\ntribunal’s power to make an award that binds the parties is derived\n\nfrom the arbitration agreement, these jurisdictional issues must\n\nnecessarily be decided through an interpretation of the arbitration\n\nagreement itself. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction\n\nmust be determined against the touchstone of the arbitration\n\nagreement.\n\n25. This view finds support in the jurisprudence and practice of\n\ninternational commercial arbitration. It is notable that while most\n\nnational legislations do not expressly provide for joinder of parties\n\nby the arbitral tribunal, this must be done with the consent of all\n\nthe parties.24 Gary Born has taken the view that the arbitral\n\ntribunal can direct the joinder of parties when the arbitration\n\n23\n\nUttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam Ltd. v. Northern Coal Field Ltd.\n, (2020) 2 SCC 455, para 7.11; \nCox\nand Kings\n (supra), para 163 (Chandrachud, J); Ajay Madhusudhan Patel (supra), para 75.\n\n24\n\n Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration (5th edn, Oxford University Press 2009). See also David St\nJohn Sutton, Judith Gill and Matthew Gearing, Russell on Arbitration (23rd edn, Sweet and Maxwell 2009).\n\n 22\n\n\fagreement expressly provides for the same. However, he states that\n\nin reality, most arbitration agreements, whether ad hoc or\n\nproviding for institutional arbitration, neither expressly preclude\n\nnor expressly permit the arbitral tribunal to join parties. In such\n\ncases, the power must be implied,25 particularly when there is a\n\nmulti-party arbitration clause in the same underlying contract that\n\ndoes not expressly address the joinder of parties in the arbitral\n\nproceedings. He states that: “In these circumstances, there is a\n\nsubstantial argument that the parties have impliedly accepted the\n\npossibility of consolidating arbitrations under their multi-party\n\narbitration agreement and/or the joinder or intervention of other\n\ncontracting parties into such arbitrations… the parties’ joint\n\nacceptance of a single dispute resolution mechanism, to deal with\n\ndisputes under a single contractual relationship, reflects their\n\nagreement on the possibility of a unified proceeding to resolve their\n\ndisputes, rather than necessarily requiring fragmented proceedings\n\nin all cases.” Further, in jurisdictions where there is no provision\n\nin the national arbitration statute authorising the courts to\n\nconsolidate arbitrations or to join parties, it is left to the arbitral\n\ntribunal to determine this issue at the first instance. 26\n\n25\n\n Gary Born, International Commercial Arbitration, vol 2 (3rd edn, Kluwer Law International 2021) 2777.\n\n26\n\n ibid, 2788-2789.\n\n 23\n\n\f26. Therefore, as per the legal principles under the ACA as well\n\nas in international commercial arbitration, it is a foundational\n\ntenet that the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction is derived from the\n\nconsent of the parties to refer their disputes to arbitration, which\n\nmust be recorded in an arbitration agreement. The proper judicial\n\ninquiry to decide a jurisdictional issue under \nSection 16\n as to\n\nwhether a person/entity can be made a party to the arbitral\n\nproceedings will therefore entail an examination of the arbitration\n\nagreement and whether such person is a party to it. If the answer\n\nis in the affirmative, such person can be made party to the arbitral\n\nproceedings and the arbitral tribunal can exercise jurisdiction over\n\nhim as he has consented to the same.\n\n27. Returning to the Facts of the Case: Now that we have set out\n\nthe legal principles on when can a person be made party to an\n\narbitration proceeding and how must the arbitral tribunal proceed\n\nunder \nSection 16\n, we will deal with the approach adopted in the\n\npresent case. While allowing the \nSection 16\n application by order\n\ndated 15.02.2024, the arbitral tribunal proceeded only on the\n\nbasis that respondent nos. 2 and 3 were not served with the\n\nSection 21\n notice and were not parties in the \nSection 11\n\napplication. The arbitral tribunal did not go into whether these\n\n 24\n\n\frespondents are parties to the arbitration agreement, and whether\n\nits jurisdiction extends to them. We are extracting the relevant\n\nportion of the arbitral tribunal’s order:\n\n \n“8. Ld. Counsel for the Claimant has also relied upon various\n judgments and in particular the judgment in \"\nCox and Kings Ltd. Vs.\n SAP India Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.\", Arbitration Petition (Civil) No.\n 38/2020,\n dated 06.12.2023 to argue that on the principle of competence-\n competence this Tribunal can continue the Arbitral proceedings\n against Respondents No.2 and 3 as they are necessary parties to\n these proceedings and their presence is required for effective\n adjudication of the disputes being raised by the Claimant. In my view\n this submission is also without any merit in as much as the principle\n of competence-competence can be applied only when the Court or the\n Tribunal finds that the presence of even non-signatories of the Arbitral\n Agreement is required. A non-signatory of the Arbitral Agreement can\n be added in the Arbitral Proceedings if he has played a positive, direct\n and substantial role in the negotiations and performance of the\n Contract which contains an Arbitral Clause and as such the Court or\n the Tribunal may add him also in the proceedings for effectual\n adjudication of the disputes between the parties. This principle is like\n the provision of \nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\n. However, in this case this\n Tribunal has not at all found or held that the presence of Respondents\n No.2 and 3 is essential in these proceedings for effective adjudication\n of the disputes being raised by the Claimant. At this stage the\n Tribunal is concerned only with the question of joining Respondents\n No.2 and 3 without serving upon them a notice under \nSection 21\n of\n the A&C Act, 1996 which admittedly was never served upon them\n and as such the Arbitral proceedings initiated by the Claimant\n against them are unsustainable.\n\n 9. The objection raised by Respondents No.2 and 3 / Applicants in\n the present proceedings against them is also on the ground that they\n were never made a party to \nSection 11\n A&C Act, 1996 proceedings\n and the High Court while making a reference and appointing the\n undersigned as an Arbitrator had only Respondent No. 1 before it. It\n is argued that there is no reference qua Respondents No.2 and 3 by\n the High Court of Delhi and as such the present proceedings against\n them are void and illegal. As already discussed above the principle\n of competence-competence is not applicable to the Respondents No. 2\n and 3 at this stage. The absence of any reference qua them by the\n High Court under \nSection 11\n of the A&C Act, 1996 renders these\n proceedings against them void-ab-initio and as such they cannot be\n proceeded against by this Tribunal.”\n\n 25\n\n\f28. The arbitral tribunal’s approach clearly shows that it did not\n\nexercise its jurisdiction in accordance with the principle of\n\nkompetenz-kompetenz, and rather held that such issue does not at\n\nall arise at the present stage. Even the High Court, while exercising\n\nappellate jurisdiction under \nSection 37\n, proceeded on a similar\n\nbasis. In view of the legal principles set out above, we are of the\n\nview that this is an incorrect approach. Rather, the arbitral\n\ntribunal should have inquired into whether respondent nos. 2 and\n\n3 are parties to the arbitration agreement to determine whether\n\nthey could have been impleaded in the statement of claim. We will\n\nbe elaborating on this issue at a later stage.\n\n29. High Court Decisions on these Issues: Now that we have laid\n\ndown the purpose of a \nSection 21\n notice, the scope of inquiry in a\n\nSection 11\n application, and the judicial approach to determining\n\njurisdictional issues under \nSection 16\n, including whether a person\n\ncan be made party to the arbitration proceedings, we find it\n\nnecessary to clarify various decisions by High Courts that deal with\n\nthese legal issues.\n\n30. The Delhi High Court in \nAlupro Building Systems Pvt Ltd. v.\n\nOzone Overseas Pvt Ltd.27\n allowed an application under \nSection 34\n\n27\n\n 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7228.\n\n 26\n\n\fof the ACA against an award passed by an arbitrator who was\n\nunilaterally appointed by the respondent therein, without issuing\n\na notice to the petitioner therein under \nSection 21\n of the ACA. The\n\nHigh Court proceeded to delineate the various functions served by\n\na \nSection 21\n notice as follows:28 (i) To inform the other party as to\n\nthe claims, which will enable them to accept or dispute the claims;\n\n(ii) To enable the other party to point out if certain claims are time-\n\nbarred, barred by law, or untenable, or if there are counter-claims;\n\n(iii) For arriving at a consensus for appointment of arbitrators\n\nunder the arbitration agreement; (iv) For parties to inform each\n\nother about their proposed arbitrator, to enable the other party to\n\nraise any objections/issues regarding qualification; (v) To trigger\n\nthe court’s jurisdiction under \nSection 11\n in case the appointment\n\nprocedure fails; and (vi) To fix the date of commencement of\n\narbitration for the purpose of \nSection 43(1)\n.\n\n30.1 The decision in \nAlupro Building Systems\n (supra) has been\n\nrelied on by the High Court in its impugned order to hold that the\n\nnotice under \nSection 21\n is a mandatory requirement before a\n\nperson can be made party to arbitral proceedings.\n\n28\n\n ibid, paras 25-30.\n\n 27\n\n\f30.2 While we agree with the decision insofar as holding that the\n\nnotice under \nSection 21\n is mandatory, unless the contract provides\n\notherwise, we do not agree with the conclusion that non-service of\n\nsuch notice on a party nullifies the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction\n\nover him. The purpose of the \nSection 21\n notice is clear – by fixing\n\nthe date of commencement of arbitration, it enables the calculation\n\nof limitation and it is a necessary precondition for filing an\n\napplication under \nSection 11\n of the ACA. The other purposes\n\nserved by such notice – of informing the respondent about the\n\nclaims, giving the respondent an opportunity to admit and contest\n\nclaims and raise counter-claims, and to object to proposed\n\narbitrators – are only incidental and secondary. We have already\n\nheld that the contents of the notice do not restrict the claims, and\n\nany objections regarding limitation and maintainability can be\n\nraised before the arbitral tribunal, and the ACA provides\n\nmechanisms for challenging the appointment of arbitrators on\n\nvarious grounds. Hence, while a \nSection 21\n notice may perform\n\nthese functions, it is not the primary or only mechanism envisaged\n\nby the ACA.\n\n30.3 In this light, and considering that in the facts of the present\n\ncase a \nSection 21\n notice was in fact issued to respondent no. 1, we\n\n 28\n\n\ffind it difficult to accept that the decision in \nAlupro Building\n\nSystems\n (supra) can be relied on to entirely reject the arbitral\n\ntribunal’s jurisdiction over respondent nos. 2 and 3.\n\n31. The next decision is in \nDe Lage Landen Financial Services\n\nIndia (P) Ltd. v. Parhit Diagnostic (P) Limited29\n, which has been\n\nrelied on by the appellant. This decision arose out of a \nSection 11\n\napplication that was allowed by the Delhi High Court by holding\n\nthat the respondent therein had due notice of the arbitration\n\nproceedings.\n \nUpon considering the facts of the case and the\n\nappointment mechanism in the arbitration agreement therein, the\n\nCourt held that the rationale of serving a \nSection 21\n notice as \nlaid\n\ndown in\n \nAlupro\n (supra) stood fulfilled, and hence, the \nSection 11\n\napplication was maintainable.\n \nIn the present impugned order, the\n\nHigh Court differentiated this decision by holding that the\n\nrespondent in \nDe Lage Landen Financial Services\n (supra) was made\n\na party to the \nSection 11\n proceedings, which is absent in this case.\n\nAt this stage, it will suffice to say that \nDe Lage Landen Financial\n\nServices\n (supra) does not seem to have deviated from the legal\n\nposition on a \nSection 21\n notice \nlaid down in\n \nAlupro\n (supra), and its\n\ndecision must be understood in the context of its facts.\n\n29\n\n 2021 SCC OnLine Del 4160.\n\n 29\n\n \n32. Another relevant decision is that of \nArupri Logistics (P) Ltd. v.\n\nVilas Gupta\n 30, wherein the Delhi High Court was dealing with the\n\narbitral tribunal’s power to implead non-signatories to the\n\narbitration agreement as parties. It held that unlike a court that\n\nhas the power to implead parties under \nOrder I, Rule 10 of the\n\nCode of Civil Procedure\n, 1908, no such provision exists under the\n\nACA. Further, proceeding on the basis that a non-signatory is not\n\na party to the arbitration agreement, the High Court held that the\n\narbitral tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over a non-signatory\n\nand impleading such person would be contrary to consent being\n\nthe foundation of arbitration.\n \nIt is necessary to note that this\n\ndecision was prior to the Constitution Bench judgment in \nCox and\n\nKings\n (supra), wherein it was held that non-signatories can be\n\nimpleaded in the arbitration if their conduct shows that they are\n\nveritable parties to the arbitration agreement.\n \nWe also find that the\n\nreasoning in \nArupri Logistics\n (supra) is in line with what we have\n\nheld hereinabove, i.e., the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to\n\nimplead a person depends on whether such person is a party to\n\nthe arbitration agreement.\n\n30\n\n 2023 SCC OnLine Del 4297.\n\n 30\n\n\f33. Finally, we must refer to the Bombay High Court’s decision\n\nin Cardinal Energy & Infra Structure (P) Ltd. v. Subramanya\n\nConstruction & Development Co. Ltd. 31, which has a similar factual\n\nmatrix as this case. The petitioners therein were not served with\n\nthe \nSection 21\n notice or made party in the \nSection 11\n proceedings.\n\nRather, they were impleaded by the arbitral tribunal after it had\n\nframed issues, upon an application by respondent nos. 1 and 2\n\ntherein. In a \nSection 34\n application against the arbitral award, the\n\nHigh Court considered the issue of whether the petitioners therein,\n\nwho were non-signatories to the arbitration agreement, could have\n\nbeen impleaded without them being referred to arbitration in the\n\norder under \nSection 11\n. \nBy referring to \nCox and Kings\n (supra), the\n\nrelevant portion of which we have extracted hereinabove, the High\n\nCourt held that the arbitral tribunal has the power to decide\n\nwhether a non-signatory is bound by the arbitration agreement.\n\nThe referral court only gives a prima facie finding on this issue,\n\nand leaves it to the arbitrator to decide the same. By relying on\n\nthis rationale, the High Court held that the non-joinder of a party\n\nin a \nSection 11\n application does not preclude its impleadment in\n\nthe arbitration proceedings by the arbitral tribunal.\n\n31\n\n 2024 SCC OnLine Bom 964.\n\n 31\n\n\f33.1 In the impugned order in this case, the High Court\n\ndifferentiated Cardinal Energy & Infra Structure (supra) on the\n\nground that the arbitral tribunal’s order in this case does not hold\n\nrespondent nos. 2 and 3 to be proper parties to the arbitration\n\nproceedings. However, as we have stated above as well, the arbitral\n\ntribunal did not decide the issue of whether these respondents are\n\nparties to the arbitration agreement and proper parties to the\n\nproceedings before it. Hence, the decision in Cardinal Energy &\n\nInfra Structure (supra) was not properly considered by the High\n\nCourt in this case.\n\n34. Whether Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are Parties to the Arbitration\n\nAgreement: In light of the legal position set out hereinabove, we\n\nwill now consider whether respondent nos. 2 and 3 are parties to\n\nthe arbitration agreement, in order to determine whether the\n\narbitral tribunal can exercise jurisdiction over them. While we\n\ndetermine this issue, it is necessary to set out the contours of our\n\njurisdiction. Since this appeal arises from the dismissal of an\n\nappeal under \nSection 37(2)(a)\n of the ACA against the arbitral\n\ntribunal’s order deciding its jurisdiction under \nSection 16\n, we are\n\nnot confined by the grounds set out in \nSection 34\n of the ACA. While\n\ndeciding an appeal against the arbitral tribunal’s order under\n\n 32\n\nSection 16\n, the appellate courts “must have due deference to the\n\ngrounds which have weighed with the Tribunal in holding that it\n\nlacks jurisdiction having regard to the object and spirit underlying\n\nthe statute which entrusts the Arbitral Tribunal with the power to\n\nrule on its own jurisdiction.”32\n\n35. As we have held above, the arbitral tribunal in this case did\n\nnot delve into the issue of whether respondent nos. 2 and 3 are\n\nparties to the arbitration agreement and consequently, whether\n\nthey can be impleaded in the arbitral proceedings. It is also\n\nundisputed that these respondents are not signatories to the LLP\n\nAgreement that contains the arbitration agreement in Clause 40.\n\nIn this light, we are required to examine whether respondent nos.\n\n2 and 3 are parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\n36. \nIn \nCox and Kings\n (supra), this Court held that non-signatories\n\nare parties to the arbitration agreement if the conduct of the\n\nsignatories and non-signatories indicates mutual intention that\n\nthe latter be bound by the arbitration agreement. 33 The test to\n\ndetermine whether such a non-signatory is a party is as follows:\n\n “132. We are of the opinion that there is a need to seek a balance\n between the consensual nature of arbitration and the modern\n commercial reality where a non-signatory becomes implicated in a\n commercial transaction in a number of different ways. Such a balance\n\n32\n\n ONGC Ltd. v. Discovery Enterprises (P) Ltd., (2022) 8 SCC 42, para 55.\n\n33\n\n \nCox and Kings\n (supra), paras 116, 120, 123, 126 (Chandrachud, J)\n\n 33\n\n\f can be adequately achieved if the factors laid down under Discovery\n Enterprises are applied holistically. For instance, the involvement of\n the non-signatory in the performance of the underlying contract in a\n manner that suggests that it intended to be bound by the contract\n containing the arbitration agreement is an important aspect. Other\n factors such as the composite nature of transaction and commonality\n of subject-matter would suggest that the claims against the non-\n signatory were strongly interlinked with the subject-matter of the\n tribunal's jurisdiction.\n Looking at the factors holistically, it could be\n inferred that the non-signatories, by virtue of their relationship with\n the signatory parties and active involvement in the performance of\n commercial obligations which are intricately linked to the subject-\n matter, are not actually strangers to the dispute between the\n signatory parties.” 34\n\n36.1 The factors \nlaid down in\n ONGC v. Discovery Enterprises\n\n(supra) must be holistically considered to determine whether non-\n\nsignatories are parties to the arbitration agreement, which are as\n\nfollows:\n\n “40. In deciding whether a company within a group of companies\n which is not a signatory to arbitration agreement would nonetheless\n be bound by it, the law considers the following factors:\n\n (i) The mutual intent of the parties;\n\n (ii) The relationship of a non-signatory to a party which is a signatory\n to the agreement;\n\n (iii) The commonality of the subject-matter;\n\n (iv) The composite nature of the transactions; and\n\n (v) The performance of the contract.”\n\n36.2 Finally, in light of the requirement under \nSection 7\n of the ACA\n\nthat the arbitration agreement must be in writing, the mutual\n\nintention of non-signatories to be bound by the arbitration\n\nagreement must be evidenced in writing. The non-signatory’s\n\nconduct in the formation, performance, and termination of the\n\n34\n\n Followed in Ajay Madhusudhan Patel (supra).\n\n 34\n\n \ncontract, and surrounding circumstances like direct relationship\n\nwith signatory parties, commonality of subject-matter, and\n\ncomposite nature of transaction must be ascertained from the\n\nrecord of the agreement, as held in \nCox and Kings\n (supra):\n\n “229. Since the fundamental issue before the Court or tribunal under\n \nSection 7(4)(b)\n and the Group of Companies doctrine is the same, the\n doctrine can be subsumed within \nSection 7(4)(b)\n. Consequently, the\n record of agreement that evidences conduct of the non-signatory in\n the formation, performance, and termination of the contract and\n surrounding circumstances such as its direct relationship with the\n signatory parties, commonality of subject-matter, and composite\n nature of transaction, must be comprehensively used to ascertain the\n existence of the arbitration agreement with the non-signatory. In this\n inquiry, the fact of a non-signatory being a part of the same group of\n companies will strengthen its conclusion. In this light, there is no\n difficulty in applying the Group of Companies doctrine as it would be\n statutorily anchored in \nSection 7\n of the Act.\n\n 230.1. An agreement to refer disputes to arbitration must be in a\n written form, as against an oral agreement, but need not be signed\n by the parties. Under \nSection 7(4)(b)\n, a court or Arbitral Tribunal will\n determine whether a non-signatory is a party to an arbitration\n agreement by interpreting the express language employed by the\n parties in the record of agreement, coupled with surrounding\n circumstances of the formation, performance, and discharge of the\n contract. While interpreting and constructing the contract, courts or\n tribunals may adopt well-established principles, which aid and assist\n proper adjudication and determination. The Group of Companies\n doctrine is one such principle.”\n\n37. In this case, Clause 40 of the LLP Agreement (extracted\n\nhereinabove) is expansive in its wording. It covers disputes arising\n\nbetween the partners inter se each other, and between the partners\n\non the one hand and the LLP and its administrator on the other\n\nhand, when such disputes pertain to the LLP Agreement or its\n\nconstruction, or relate to the rights, duties, and liabilities of the\n\n 35\n\n\fpartners. This arbitration agreement covers the present disputes\n\narising out of reconciliation of accounts in relation to the ITF\n\nProject, as this directly affects the rights and liabilities of the\n\nappellant and respondent no. 1, who are the partners. Further, the\n\narbitration agreement itself includes within its scope disputes that\n\nmay arise between the partners and the LLP (respondent no. 2),\n\nand the partners and the administrators of the LLP, i.e.,\n\nrespondent no. 3 as he is the CEO of the LLP and responsible for\n\nits administration under Clause 8 of the LLP Agreement. The\n\nquestion that must be answered is whether respondent no. 2 and\n\n3 have consented to being bound by such arbitration agreement.\n\n38. We must answer this question in the affirmative based on the\n\nfollowing considerations. With respect to respondent no. 2, it was\n\ncreated under the LLP Agreement and the scope of its activities\n\nand the management of its business are set out in the LLP\n\nAgreement. It is pursuant to the objectives, purpose, and terms of\n\nthe LLP Agreement that respondent no. 2 undertook the ITF\n\nProject, for which a Supplementary LLP Agreement and an MoU\n\nwere also signed by the partners. Hence, it can be said that\n\nrespondent no. 2 is carrying out its business and entering into\n\ncontracts and dealings with third parties, such as undertaking the\n\n 36\n\n\fITF Project, based on the terms of the LLP Agreement. Hence, by\n\nway of its conduct, respondent no. 2 has undertaken to be bound\n\nby the LLP Agreement and it is therefore bound by the arbitration\n\nclause contained therein. Similarly, respondent no. 3, who is the\n\nCEO of the LLP and is responsible for its administration and\n\nlooking after its business derives his position and duties from\n\nClause 8 of the LLP Agreement. His obligations as the CEO of the\n\nLLP are therefore derived under the LLP Agreement, and he is\n\nacting under this contract. Therefore, it can be said that\n\nrespondent no. 3 is also bound by the arbitration clause contained\n\nin the LLP Agreement, not in his individual capacity but as the\n\nCEO of the LLP.\n\n39. Therefore, in view of the fact that respondent nos. 2 and 3\n\nhave, through their conduct, consented to perform contractual\n\nobligations under the LLP Agreement, it is clear that they have also\n\nagreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement contained in\n\nClause 40 therein. Since they are parties to the underlying\n\ncontract and the arbitration agreement, the arbitral tribunal has\n\nthe power to implead them as parties to the arbitration proceedings\n\nwhile exercising its jurisdiction under \nSection 16\n of the ACA and\n\nas per the kompetenz-kompetenz principle.\n\n 37\n\n\f40. Summary of Conclusions: Our legal analysis of the issues that\n\nwe set out above, as well as our findings in the facts of the given\n\nappeal, can be stated as follows:\n\n I. A notice invoking arbitration under \nSection 21\n of the ACA is\n\n mandatory as it fixes the date of commencement of\n\n arbitration, which is essential for determining limitation\n\n periods and the applicable law, and it is a prerequisite to\n\n filing an application under \nSection 11\n. However, merely\n\n because such a notice was not issued to certain persons who\n\n are parties to the arbitration agreement does not denude the\n\n arbitral tribunal of its jurisdiction to implead them as\n\n parties during the arbitral proceedings.\n\n II. The purpose of an application under \nSection 11\n is for the\n\n court to appoint an arbitrator, so as to enable dispute\n\n resolution through arbitration when the appointment\n\n procedure in the agreement fails. The court only undertakes\n\n a limited and prima facie examination into the existence of\n\n the arbitration agreement and its parties at this stage.\n\n Hence, merely because a court does not refer a certain party\n\n to arbitration in its order does not denude the jurisdiction of\n\n the arbitral tribunal from impleading them during the\n\n 38\n\n\f arbitral proceedings as the referral court’s view does not\n\n finally determine this issue.\n\n III. The relevant consideration to determine whether a person\n\n can be made a party before the arbitral tribunal is if such a\n\n person is a party to the arbitration agreement. The arbitral\n\n tribunal must determine this jurisdictional issue in an\n\n application under \nSection 16\n by examining whether a non-\n\n signatory is a party to the arbitration agreement as per\n\n \nSection 7\n of the ACA.\n\n IV. In the facts of the present appeal, respondent nos. 2 and 3\n\n are parties to the arbitration agreement in Clause 40 of the\n\n LLP Agreement despite being non-signatories. Their conduct\n\n is in accordance with and in pursuance of the terms of the\n\n LLP Agreement, and hence, they can be made parties to the\n\n arbitral proceedings.\n\n41. In light of the above reasoning, we allow the present appeal\n\nand set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court\n\nof Delhi dated 08.07.2024 in Arb. A. (Comm.) 24/2024. We direct\n\nthat respondent nos. 2 and 3 be impleaded as parties before the\n\narbitral tribunal, and the proceedings must be continued from the\n\nstage of arbitral tribunal’s order dated 15.02.2024. Considering\n\n 39\n\n\fthat the claim was filed in 2022, we would request the arbitral\n\ntribunal to complete the hearings and pass its award as\n\nexpeditiously as possible.\n\n42. No order as to costs.\n\n43. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.\n\n ………………………………....J.\n [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA]\n\n ………………………………....J.\n [MANOJ MISRA]\n\nNEW DELHI;\n\nAPRIL 17, 2025\n\n 40",

In both the scenarios, the referral court will be required to\n prima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration agreement and\n whether the non-signatory is a veritable party to the arbitration\n agreement. In view of the complexity of such a determination, the\n referral court should leave it for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide\n whether the non-signatory party is indeed a party to the arbitration\n agreement on the basis of the factual evidence and application of\n legal doctrine. The Tribunal can delve into the factual, circumstantial,\n and legal aspects of the matter to decide whether its jurisdiction\n extends to the non-signatory party. In the process, the Tribunal\n should comply with the requirements of principles of natural justice\n such as giving opportunity to the non-signatory to raise objections\n with regard to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.

In my view\n this submission is also without any merit in as much as the principle\n of competence-competence can be applied only when the Court or the\n Tribunal finds that the presence of even non-signatories of the Arbitral\n Agreement is required. A non-signatory of the Arbitral Agreement can\n be added in the Arbitral Proceedings if he has played a positive, direct\n and substantial role in the negotiations and performance of the\n Contract which contains an Arbitral Clause and as such the Court or\n the Tribunal may add him also in the proceedings for effectual\n adjudication of the disputes between the parties. This principle is like\n the provision of \nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\n. However, in this case this\n Tribunal has not at all found or held that the presence of Respondents\n No.2 and 3 is essential in these proceedings for effective adjudication\n of the disputes being raised by the Claimant. At this stage the\n Tribunal is concerned only with the question of joining Respondents\n No.2 and 3 without serving upon them a notice under \nSection 21\n of\n the A&C Act, 1996 which admittedly was never served upon them\n and as such the Arbitral proceedings initiated by the Claimant\n against them are unsustainable."

The objection raised by Respondents No.2 and 3 / Applicants in\n the present proceedings against them is also on the ground that they\n were never made a party to \nSection 11\n A&C Act, 1996 proceedings\n and the High Court while making a reference and appointing the\n undersigned as an Arbitrator had only Respondent No. 1 before it. It\n is argued that there is no reference qua Respondents No.2 and 3 by\n the High Court of Delhi and as such the present proceedings against\n them are void and illegal. As already discussed above the principle\n of competence-competence is not applicable to the Respondents No. 2\n and 3 at this stage. The absence of any reference qua them by the\n High Court under \nSection 11\n of the A&C Act, 1996 renders these\n proceedings against them void-ab-initio and as such they cannot be\n proceeded against by this Tribunal.”"
