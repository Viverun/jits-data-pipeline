I am faced, here, with a peculiar and, quite frankly, somewhat\nunenviable, situation in which, though learned counsel for both the\nparties submit that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the present\npetition, I am unable to convince myself to agree.\n\n2. In view of the limited controversy involved, it is not necessary\nto dwell deep into the disputes between the petitioner and the\nrespondent. A brief recital would suffice.\n\n3. The respondent has its registered office in Gurgaon, Haryana.\nOn 27th December, 2018, a lease deed was executed, whereby the\nrespondent leased the premises, admeasuring 10,000 square feet, for\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB.

Interest free refundable security deposit of ₹\n52,80,000/- was paid, by the petitioner, to the respondent, and the\n₹ 7,30,000/\nmonthly lease rental, as per the lease deed, was -.\n\nAdditionally, the petitioner was required to pay maintenance charges\nof ₹ 1,50,000/-, apart from electricity and water charges.\n\n4. It is asserted, in the petition, that the petitioner was meeting all\nthese liabilities, without default.\n\n5. Owing to the intervention of the COVID-2019 pandemic, the\npetitioner claims that it had to suspend its operations, completely, with\neffect from 23rd March, 2020. This, according to the petitioner,\nconstituted force majeure, for which there was a separate dispensation\nin the lease deed.\n\n6. The petitioner, on 23rd March, 2020, wrote to the respondent,\ninforming the respondent that it was not in a position to continue\noperating from the premises and requesting the respondent, therefore,\nto switch off the power supply.\n\n7. Vide notice dated 23rd May, 2020, addressed to the respondent,\nthe petitioner purported to terminate the lease deed, invoking Clause\n13.2 thereof (which dealt with force majeure). Correspondingly, the\npetitioner requested the respondent to refund the interest free\nrefundable security deposit of ₹ 52,80,000/- paid by it\n\n8. The respondent replied, on 27th May, 2020, denying any\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 2 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nliability towards the petitioner.\n\n9. A dispute having thus arisen between the petitioner and the\nrespondent, the petitioner issued a separate notice, dated 8th June,\n2020, invoking arbitration, for the resolution of the dispute, in\naccordance with Clauses 25.2 to 25.4 of the lease deed, which reads\nthus:\n\n\"25.2 That if any disputes controversies or difference arise\nbetween the Parties, regarding the construction or\ninterpretation of any of the terms and conditions herein\ncontained or touching these presents or determination of any\nliability or breach thereof (Dispute), the Parties shall try and\nresolve the same amicably, failing which the Disputes shall be\nreferred to Arbitration.\n\n25.3 That if the Parties fail to resolve such dispute then,\neither Party may serve a notice to the other Party of its\nintention to commence arbitration. All such disputes shall\nthen be finally settled through arbitration in accordance with\nthe provisions of this Clause.\n\n25.4 Parties have agreed that all the Disputes arising out of\nthis Deed shall be referred to a Sole Arbitrator who shall be\nmutually appointed by the parties, failing which either Party\nmay approach a court of competent jurisdiction at Haryana\nfor appointment of the Sole Arbitrator in terms of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(Act) as amended from\ntime to time. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted\nin terms of the Act. The award of the Sole Arbitrator shall be\nreasoned and in written, which shall be final and binding upon\nthe Parties. It has been further agreed between the Parties that\nArbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English\nLanguage and the seat of Arbitration will be at New Delhi,\nIndia.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe communication also suggested the name of an advocate, as the\nsole arbitrator to adjudicate on the aforesaid disputes.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 3 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n10. Vide response dated 27th June, 2020, the respondent again\ndenied any liability towards the petitioner and also rejected the\nsuggestion, of the petitioner, to appoint the advocate, whose name was\nsuggested by the petitioner, to act as the sole arbitrator. The\nrespondent, instead, recommended the name of Hon'ble Mr. Justice\nBadar Durrez Ahmed, former Chief Justice of the High Court of\nJammu & Kashmir and an eminent retired Judge of this Court, as the\nsole arbitrator to arbitrate on the aforesaid disputes.\n\n11. There being no consensus, ad idem, regarding the identity of the\narbitrator to arbitrate on the disputes between the parties, the petitioner\nhas approached this Court, by means of the present petition, preferred\nunder\nSection 11(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the 1996 Act\").\n\n12. A reading of Clause 25.4 of the lease deed reveals that the\njurisdiction, for appointment of the sole arbitrator in terms of the 1996\nAct, has been specifically conferred, by agreement between the\nparties, on \"a court of competent jurisdiction at Haryana ... in terms of\nthe\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\".\n\n13. I have queried, of learned counsel, as to how, in view thereof,\nthis Court could exercise jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator under\n\nSection 11\n.\n\n14. The submission, of both the learned counsel, has been that, as\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 4 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nthe seat of arbitration has been fixed as New Delhi, this Court has\nexclusive jurisdiction to appoint the sole arbitrator. It is emphatically\nsubmitted, at the Bar, that there is a long line of authorities, of the\nSupreme Court, underscoring the position that a clause fixing the seat\nof arbitration is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause and that, once\nsuch a clause exists, the court having jurisdiction over the seat thus\nfixed, would, ex facie, also have jurisdiction in all matters relating to\nthe arbitral proceedings, including\nSections 9\n,\nand\nof the 1996\nAct.\n\n15. Mr. Yash Srivastava, learned counsel for the petitioner, has\nplaced especial reliance, in this context, on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in\nBhandari Udyog Limited v. Industrial Facilitation\nCouncil\n1 and of this Court in\nDevyani International Ltd v.\nSiddhivinayak Builders\nand\nDevelopers 2, N.J. Construction v.\nAyursundra Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.\n3 and\nAarka Sports Management\nPvt. Ltd. v. Kalsi Buildcon Pvt. Ltd\n4.\n\n16. Mr. Praveen Kumar Sharma, learned counsel for the respondent,\nsupporting the stand of the petitioner, has cited a judgment of a\ncoordinate Single Bench of this Court in\nRamandeep Singh Taneja v.\nCrown Realtech Pvt. Ltd\n5.\n\n17. Before proceeding to examine the controversy, two factors, in\n(2015) 14 SCC 515\n(2017 )SCC OnLine Del 11156\n(2018) SCC OnLine Del 7009\n(2020) III AD(Delhi) 486\n(2017) SCC OnLine Del 11966\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 5 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nmy opinion, are required to be noticed at the outset.\n\n18. Firstly, while it is true that the Supreme Court has, in various\ndecisions commencing from the judgment of the Constitution Bench\nin BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services 6, held that a\nclause fixing the seat of arbitration is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction\nclause and that, therefore, courts having jurisdiction over the seat so\nfixed, would possess jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings in their\nentirety, none of the said decisions pertain to a situation in which the\ncontract contained a separate exclusive jurisdiction clause, conferring\njurisdiction on a court in another territorial location.\n\n19. Secondly, there is no decision, either of the Supreme Court, or\nof this Court, to which my attention has been invited, or on which I\nhave been able to lay my hands, in which the arbitration agreement\nspecifically confers the jurisdiction to appoint the arbitrator, i.e.\n\nSection 11\njurisdiction, on courts in a particular territorial location.\nThis, factor, in my view, makes a world of difference to the present\ncase, and its outcome.\n\n20. Learned counsel for the parties are correct in their submission\nthat there is a long line of decisions of the Supreme Court, which have\nexamined the aspect of territorial jurisdiction, qua the proceedings\nunder\nSection 9\n,\nand\nof the 1996 Act. These decisions have\ndealt with the scope of the \"seat of arbitration clause\" as well as of the\n\"exclusive jurisdiction clause\", and the effect of\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the\n1996 Act, juxtaposed therewith.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 6 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n21. In fact, the three factors, the interplay of which would fall for\nconsideration in all such cases, are (i) the seat of arbitration clause, if\nany, (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction clause, if any and (iii)\nSection\n2(1)(e)\nof the 1996 Act.\n\n22. One may, profitably, commence a glance at these authorities,\nfrom the decision in BALCO6.\n\n23. BALCO6, a decision of the Constitution Bench, did not involve\nany exclusive jurisdiction clause. It involved an international\ncommercial arbitration and the Supreme Court was principally\nconcerned, in the said case, with\nSection 2(2)\nof the 1996 Act, and its\neffect on the controversy before it. The Supreme Court observed that\n\nSection 2(2)\noperated to make Part I of the 1996 Act applicable only\nto arbitrations which took place in India. It was further held, in the\nsaid decision, that, the \"seat of arbitration\" as contractually\ndetermined, was the centre of gravity of the arbitral proceedings.\n\nSection 2(1)(e)\n, the Constitution Bench held, was not relevant to the\nissue of whether Part I of the 1996 Act applied to arbitrations which\ntook place outside India.\n\n24. In any case, as already noted, this decision involved an\ninternational commercial arbitration, and the contract forming the\nsubject matter of consideration therein did not contain any exclusive\njurisdiction clause.\n\nSignature Not Verified 6\n\n(2012) 9 SCC 552\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 7 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n25. The next decision of consequence, rendered by three Hon'ble\nJudges of the Supreme Court, is\nSwastik Gases Pvt. Ltd. v. Indian Oil\nCorporation Ltd.7\n.\n\n26. Here, the contract between the parties did not fix the seat of\narbitration at any particular location. It did, however, contain an\nexclusive jurisdiction clause, subjecting the contract to the jurisdiction\nof courts at Kolkata. In view of the existence of such an exclusive\njurisdiction clause, the Supreme Court held that, though the cause of\naction arose entirely within Rajasthan, as courts at Kolkata had been\nconferred exclusive jurisdiction, by the contract between the parties,\nthe jurisdiction to deal with all the matters pertaining to the arbitration\nagreement would vest with the courts at Kolkata and the jurisdiction\nof courts in Rajasthan would be completely excluded.\n\n27. Though Mr. Srivastava has chosen to dispute the applicability\nof this decision, on the ground that there was\n,\nin that case\n, no\ncontractual covenant fixing the seat of arbitration, I deem it\nappropriate, nevertheless, to reproduce para 22 of the report, thus:\n\n\"22. In Rajasthan State Electricity Board8, two clauses\nunder consideration were clause 30 of the general conditions\nof the contract and clause 7 of the bank guarantee. Clause 30\nof the general conditions of the contract stipulated, \"the\ncontract shall for all purposes be construed according to the\nlaws of India and subject to jurisdiction only at Jaipur in\nRajasthan courts only......\" and clause 7 of the bank\nguarantee read, \"all disputes arising in the said bank guarantee\nbetween the Bank and the Board or between the supplier or\nthe Board pertaining to this guarantee shall be subject to the\ncourts only at Jaipur in Rajasthan\". In light of the above\n(2013) 9 SCC 32\n(2009) 3 SCC 107\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 8 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nclauses, the question under consideration before this Court\nwas whether Calcutta High Court where an application\nunder\nSection 20\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940 was made had\nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition or not.\n\nFollowing Hakam Singh9, A.B.C. Laminart10 and Hanil Era\nTextiles11 , this Court in paragraphs 27 and 28 (pgs. 114-115)\nof the Report held as under:\n\n\"27. The aforesaid legal proposition settled by this\nCourt in respect of territorial jurisdiction and\napplicability of Section 20 of the Code to\nthe Arbitration Act is clear, unambiguous and explicit.\nThe said position is binding on both the parties who\nwere contesting the present proceeding. Both the\nparties with their open eyes entered into the aforesaid\npurchase order and agreements thereon which\ncategorically provide that all disputes arising between\nthe parties out of the agreements would be adjudicated\nupon and decided through the process of arbitration\nand that no court other than the court at Jaipur shall\nhave jurisdiction to entertain or try the same. In both\nthe agreements in Clause 30 of the general conditions\nof the contract it was specifically mentioned that the\ncontract shall for all purposes be construed according\nto the laws of India and subject to jurisdiction only at\nJaipur in Rajasthan courts only and in addition in one\nof the purchase order the expression used was that the\ncourt at Jaipur only would have jurisdiction to entertain\nor try the same.\n\n28. In the light of the aforesaid facts of the present\ncase, the ratio of all the aforesaid decisions which are\nreferred to hereinbefore would squarely govern and\napply to the present case also. There is indeed an\nouster clause used in the aforesaid stipulations stating\nthat the courts at Jaipur alone would have jurisdiction\nto try and decide the said proceedings which could be\ninitiated for adjudication and deciding the disputes\narising between the parties with or in relation to the\naforesaid agreements through the process of\narbitration. In other words, even though otherwise the\n(1971) 1 SCC 286\n(1989) 2 SCC 163\n(2004) 4 SCC 671\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 9 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\ncourts at Calcutta would have territorial jurisdiction to\ntry and decide such disputes, but in view of the ouster\nclause it is only the courts at Jaipur which would have\njurisdiction to entertain such proceeding.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n28. Yet another decision, which dealt with a contract involving an\nexclusive jurisdiction clause with no other clause fixing seat of\narbitration elsewhere, was\nB. E. Simoes Von Staraburg Niedenthal v.\nChhattisgarh Investment Ltd12\n. The agreement between the parties, in\nthe said case, for raising mines located in Goa, expressly stipulated\nthat \"the courts at Goa shall have exclusive jurisdiction\". A\nSection 9\n\npetition was filed, by the respondent (before the Supreme Court) in the\ncourt of the District Judge, Raipur. Relying on the afore-extracted\npassages from Swastik Gases7, the Supreme Court held that Clause 13\nof the agreement (which contained the afore-extracted exclusive\njurisdiction dispensation) operated to oust the jurisdiction of the\nDistrict Judge, Raipur, and conferred exclusive jurisdiction, to\nentertain all petitions relating to the arbitration, as on courts at Goa.\n\n29.\nIndus Mobile Distribution Pvt. Ltd. v. Datawind Innovations\nPvt. Ltd13\ndealt with a situation in which there was a clause fixing the\nseat of arbitration as well as a clause conferring exclusive jurisdiction,\nbut the courts conferred jurisdiction, under either clause, were the\ncourts in Bombay. The agreement stipulated that the arbitration would\nbe conducted at Bombay, which, according to the Supreme Court,\nfixed Bombay as the \"seat of arbitration\" and conferred exclusive\njurisdiction, qua disputes under the agreement, on courts in Bombay.\n(2015)12 SCC 225\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 10 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nThe jurisdiction of courts at Bombay to entertain the petition was,\nnevertheless, sought to be questioned by placing reliance on\nSection\n2(1)(e)\nof the 1996 Act, as the cause of action had arisen outside the\njurisdiction of courts at Bombay. The Supreme Court held that, once\nthe agreement fixed the seat of arbitration at Bombay, the place where\nthe cause of action arose, and\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the 1996 Act, lost their\nrelevance altogether.\n\n30. In this case, however, it merits reiteration that there was no\nconflict between the seat of arbitration clause and the clause fixing the\nexclusive jurisdiction, as both conferred jurisdiction on courts at\nBombay.\n\n31. The next decision, in the precedential queue, is\nBrahmani River\nPellets Ltd. v. Kamachi Industries Ltd14\n. In this case, the cause of\naction, pertaining to the disputes between the parties, arose partly at\nBhubaneswar and partly at Chennai. The agreement between the\nparties, however, provided for Bhubaneswar as the venue of\narbitration. The Supreme Court held that though the agreement used\nthe word \"venue\", a proper reading of the agreement indicated that\nBhubaneswar was the seat of arbitration. In view thereof, it was held\nthat the jurisdiction of Chennai courts, to entertain the petition, stood\nousted and that courts at Bhubaneswar alone had jurisdiction to deal\nwith the matter. Here, again, there was no exclusive jurisdiction\nclause, in the agreement between the parties.\n(2017) 7 SCC 678\n2019 SCC OnLine SC 929\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 11 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n32. We proceed, next, to\nBGS SGS Soma JV v. NHPC Ltd\n15.\n\n33. This case dealt with a project, located in the State of Assam and\nArunachal Pradesh. The agreement provided for reference of any\ndispute, to arbitration to be held at New Delhi/Faridabad. The arbitral\nproceedings took place at New Delhi, and the award was also\ndelivered at New Delhi.\n\n34. The award was sought to be challenged under\nSection 34\nof the\n1996 Act, before the learned District and Sessions Judge, Faridabad,\nfrom whom it was later transferred to the Special Commercial Court,\nGurugram. The Gurugram court returned the application to the\npetitioner for presentation before the appropriate court having\njurisdiction in New Delhi.\n\n35. NHPC, i.e. the respondent before the Supreme Court,\nchallenged the decision by way of an appeal under\nSection 34\nof the\n1996 Act, before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The High\nCourt held that Delhi was only a convenient venue, for holding of the\narbitral proceedings and could not be regarded as the \"seat\" of the\narbitration. Part of the cause of action having, therefore, arisen in\nFaridabad, the High Court invoked\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the 1996 Act, to\nhold that the District Judge at Faridabad possessed jurisdiction to\ndecide the petition of NHPC.\n\n36. BGS SGS Soma appealed to the Supreme Court. Relying on its\nearlier decisions, the Supreme Court held that, as the arbitral\n\nSignature Not Verified 15\n\n(2020) 4 SCC 234\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 12 of 29\n\n19:26:23\nproceedings, per contract, were conducted at New Delhi and\nFaridabad, both New Delhi and Faridabad constituted \"seats\" of\narbitration. Nevertheless, it was held, towards the conclusion of the\njudgment that, as the proceedings had been held at New Delhi and the\naward had also been thus signed at New Delhi, the parties had\nconsciously chosen New Delhi as the \"seat\" of arbitration under\n\nSection 20(1)\nof the 1996 Act. In view thereof, it was held that courts\nat New Delhi alone would have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the\nchallenge to the award and, consequently, the\nSection 34\npetition was\ndirected to be presented before the competent courts at New Delhi.\n\n37. A detailed analysis of all the above decisions is to be found in\nthe recent judgment of this Court in\nBig Charter Pvt. Ltd. v. Ezen\nAviation Pty\n. Ltd16.\n\n38. A reading of the aforesaid decisions, no doubt, reveals that pre-\neminence has been accorded by the Supreme Court to the\ncontractually determined \"seat of arbitration\", while deciding the issue\nof the court which would be possessed of territorial jurisdiction to deal\nwith petitions relating to the arbitral proceedings, whether preferred\nunder\nSection 9\n,\nor 34. As already noticed hereinabove, however,\nnone of these decisions involved a case in which the contract\ncontained an exclusive jurisdiction clause and a separate seat of\narbitration clause, and the two clauses conferred jurisdiction on courts\nlocated at different territorial locations.\nMANU/DE/1916/2020\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 13 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n39. In the present case, the situation is more involved , as the\nexclusive jurisdiction clause specifically confers\nSection 11\n\njurisdiction on courts of competent jurisdiction at Haryana, as per the\n1996 Act - which, therefore, would mean the High Court of Punjab\nand Haryana.\n\n40. Mr. Yash Srivastava, learned Counsel for the petitioner, besides\nemphasising the fact that pre-eminence has been accorded by the\nSupreme Court, to the seat of arbitration, as fixed by the contract\nbetween the parties, and on Courts having territorial jurisdiction over\nsuch seat, also places particular reliance on\nSection 42\nof the 1996\nAct, which reads as under :\n\n\"42. Jurisdiction. - Notwithstanding anything contained\nelsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in\nforce, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any\napplication under this Part has been made in a Court, that\nCourt alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral\nproceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that\nagreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that\nCourt and in no other Court.\"\n\nMr. Srivastava devises, from this provision, an involved argument.\nHe contends that, in view of\nSection 42\n, all proceedings, relating to\nthe arbitration agreement, would have to be preferred before one\nCourt. If\nSection 11\njurisdiction, in the present case, is to be conferred\non the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, he submits a peculiar and\nanomalous situation would result, as\nSection 42\nwould then come into\nplay, and require all subsequent proceedings, relating to the\narbitration, to be preferred before the competent Courts at Haryana.\nThis, then, he submits would directly be in conflict with the fixation of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 14 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nthe seat of arbitration, by the present contract, at New Delhi. As such,\nhe submits there is an apparent conflict between the exclusive\njurisdiction clause and the seat of arbitration clause, in the present\ncase. This conflict according to Mr. Srivastava, has to be reconciled\nby harmonising the two clauses keeping in view\nSection 42\nof the\n1996 Act. The only way of doing this, he submits, would be to confer\n\nSection 11\njurisdiction on this Court. Conferment of such jurisdiction,\nhe points out, would result in\nSection 34\njurisdiction also vesting with\nthis Court (by operation of\nSection 42\n), which would be entirely in\naccord with the fixing of the seat of arbitration at New Delhi.\n\n41. I may, immediately, deal with this argument, before proceeding\nfurther. The argument, though undoubtedly attractive at first blush,\nfails, on a deeper analysis, to pass muster. The submission of Mr.\nSrivastava proceeds on the premise that, were an arbitral award to be\npassed, and were such award to be challenged, that challenge would\nalso have to be preferred before the Courts at Haryana, in view of\n\nSection 42\nof the 1996 Act - if\nSection 11\njurisdiction is to be\nconferred, by this Court, on the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.\nAccording to Mr. Srivastava, this would conflict with the seat of\narbitration clause in the agreement.\n\n42. In the first place, it would be premature for me to enter into\nsuch a controversy, seized, as I am, with the issue of fixation of\ndetermining the situs of the Court which could exercise\nSection 11\n\njurisdiction and appoint the arbitrator. Stricto sensu, therefore, I am\nnot required to consider which Court would have jurisdiction to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 15 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nentertain a\nSection 34\nchallenge, assuming an arbitral award is passed,\nwith which one, or the other, party is aggrieved.\n\n43. Be that as it may, the submission, of Mr. Srivastava, that, if\n\nSection 34\njurisdiction is to be conferred on Courts at Haryana (which,\naccording to him would be the inevitable consequence of granting\n\nSection 11\njurisdiction to courts at Haryana, in view of the mandate of\n\nSection 42\n), an anomalous situation would arise, in view of the\nfixation of the seat of arbitration at New Delhi, may not be entirely\ncorrect. As already noted hereinabove, the decisions of the Supreme\nCourt, conferring jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings, on courts\nhaving territorial jurisdiction over the contractually fixed seat of\narbitration, do not deal with situations in which there was a separate\nexclusive jurisdiction clause, conferring jurisdiction on courts located\nelsewhere. Even if\nSection 34\njurisdiction were, therefore, to be\nconferred on courts at Haryana, that may not necessarily conflict with\nthe legal position as enunciated in the decisions cited hereinabove.\nHypothetically, it may be possible to argue that, as\nSection 11\n\njurisdiction has been conferred on the High Court of Punjab and\nHaryana, the mandate of\nSection 42\nwould necessarily require any\nchallenge to the award, under\nSection 34\n, to be also preferred before\nCourts at Haryana.\n\n44. The submission, of Mr. Srivastava, that this would conflict with\nthe seat of arbitration dispensation in the lease deed, may not be\ncorrect, in view of the separate exclusive jurisdiction clause,\nconferring jurisdiction on Courts located elsewhere than at the seat of\narbitration.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB.

At the cost of reiteration, it may be mentioned that none of the\ndecisions cited hereinabove, deal with the situation in which the seat\nof arbitration is fixed at place A, and courts at place B are conferred\nexclusive jurisdiction to deal with disputes under the contract. The\nview that the \"seat of arbitration clause\" has to be treated as akin to an\nexclusive jurisdiction clause, has been expressed, by the Supreme\nCourt, in cases in which there is no separate exclusive jurisdiction\nclause, conferring exclusive jurisdiction on courts located elsewhere.\nWhere such a separate exclusive jurisdiction clause, conferring\nexclusive jurisdiction on courts other than the court having jurisdiction\nover the contractual seat of arbitration, exists, it may not be proper, in\nmy view, to grant pride of place, to the seat of arbitration clause, over\nthe exclusive jurisdiction clause. None of the decisions of the\nSupreme Court, cited hereinabove and to which my attention was\ninvited, so directs. This position would stand underscored in a\nsituation, such as the present - which appears to be sui generis - in\nwhich the exclusive jurisdiction clause is not generally worded, qua all\ndisputes under the agreement, but is specific with respect to\nappointment of the arbitrator, i.e. specific with respect to\nSection 11\n\njurisdiction. Adhering to the said contractual dispensation would not,\ntherefore, in my view, militate against the opinion expressed by the\nSupreme Court in the aforesaid decisions, as was sought to be\nsuggested by Mr. Srivastava.\n\n46. Having so observed, I hasten to clarify that I am not proposing\nto venture any final opinion on the appropriate forum, before which\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 17 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nany challenge, to the arbitral award that would come to be passed,\nunder\nSection 34\nof the 1996 Act, would have to be laid. This aspect,\nstrictly speaking, does not arise for consideration before me and would\nhave to be examined by the courts which is seized with the\nSection 34\n\nchallenge, if and when such a challenge is laid.\n\n47. There is, however, one decision of the Supreme Court, in which\nthe seat of arbitration was fixed at one location, and exclusive\njurisdiction was conferred on courts at another, which did not have\nterritorial jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration. This decision,\nproperly read, in my view, does throw some light on the approach to\nbe adopted in a case such as the present. The decision in question is\n\nMankastu Impex Pvt. Ltd. v. Airvisual Ltd17\n.\n\n48. In Mankastu Impex Pvt. Ltd.17, the place of arbitration, was\ncontractually fixed at Hong Kong. In that case, Clause 17 of the\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the parties which\nprovided for arbitration for resolution of the disputes between them,\nread thus :\n\n\"17. Governing law and dispute resolution\n\n17.1 This MoU is governed by the laws of India, without\nregard to its conflicts of laws provisions, and courts at New\nDelhi shall have the jurisdiction.\n\n17.2 Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising\nout of or relating to this MoU, including the existence,\nvalidity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination\nthereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations\narising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally\nresolved by arbitration administered in Hong Kong.\n2020 SCC OnLine SC 301\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 18 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nThe place of arbitration shall be Hong Kong.\n\nThe number of arbitrators shall be one. The arbitration\nproceedings shall be conducted in English language.\n\n17.3 It is agreed that a party may seek provisional, injunctive\nor equitable remedies, including but not limited to preliminary\ninjunctive relief, from a court having jurisdiction, before,\nduring or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding.\"\n\n49. The issue before the Supreme Court was with respect to the\ncourts having jurisdiction to entertain a\nSection 11\npetition, as in the\npresent case. The Supreme Court held that the fixing of Hong Kong\nas the \"place of arbitration\" resulted ipso facto in Hong Kong\nbecoming the \"seat of arbitration\". On the attention of the Supreme\nCourt being invited to Clause 17.1, which conferred jurisdiction on\ncourts at New Delhi, in respect of the MOU, the Supreme Court\nobserved, in paras 25 and 27 of the report, thus :\n\n\"25. Clause 17.1 of MoU stipulates that MoU is governed\nby the laws of India and the courts at New Delhi shall have\njurisdiction. The interpretation to Clause 17.1 shows that the\nsubstantive law governing the substantive contract are the\nlaws of India. The words in Clause 17.1, \"without regard to\nits conflicts of laws provisions and courts at New Delhi shall\nhave the jurisdiction\" has to be read along with Clause 17.3 of\nthe agreement. As per Clause 17.3, the parties have agreed\nthat the party may seek provisional, injunctive or equitable\nremedies from a court having jurisdiction before, during or\nafter the pendency of any arbitral proceedings. In\nBALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012)\n9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810, this Court held that :\n\n(SCC p. 636, para 157)\n\n\"157. ... on a logical and schematic construction of the\n\nArbitration Act, 1996\n, the Indian courts do not have the\npower to grant interim measures when the seat of\narbitration is outside India.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 19 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nIf the arbitration agreement is found to have seat of arbitration\noutside India, then the Indian courts cannot exercise\nsupervisory jurisdiction over the award or pass interim orders.\nIt would have, therefore, been necessary for the parties to\nincorporate Clause 17.3 that parties have agreed that a party\nmay seek interim relief for which the Delhi courts would have\njurisdiction.\n\n*****\n\n27. The words in Clause 17.1, \"without regard to its\nconflicts of laws provisions and courts at New Delhi shall\nhave the jurisdiction\" do not take away or dilute the intention\nof the parties in Clause 17.2 that the arbitration be\nadministered in Hong Kong. The words in Clause 17.1 do not\nsuggest that the seat of arbitration is in New Delhi. Since Part\nI is not applicable to \"international commercial arbitrations\",\nin order to enable the parties to avail the interim relief,\nClause 17.3 appears to have been added. The words, \"without\nregard to its conflicts of laws provisions and courts at New\nDelhi shall have the jurisdiction\" in Clause 17.1 is to be read\nin conjunction with Clause 17.3. Since the arbitration is seated\nat Hong Kong, the petition filed by the petitioner under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is not maintainable and the petition is\nliable to be dismissed.\"\n\n50. As such, the Supreme Court held that once the seat of\narbitration has been fixed as Hong Kong, if exclusive jurisdiction, for\nobtaining interim relief, was required to be vested in courts at New\nDelhi, the agreement had necessarily to specifically so state. It was\nfor this reason, opined the Supreme Court, that Clause 7.3 had been\nparticularly inserted in the agreement which, apart from the exclusive\njurisdiction clause i.e. Clause 7.1, specifically provided for recourse to\ncourts at New Delhi, for obtaining interim relief. That clause,\naccording to the Supreme Court, however, could be of no assistance in\ndetermining the controversy before it, as the Supreme Court was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 20 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nconcerned not with an application under\nSection 9\n, but with an\napplication for appointment of an arbitrator under\nSection 11\n.\nExclusive jurisdiction to seek recourse to courts at New Delhi having\nbeen contractually restricted to applications for obtaining interim\nrelief, the Supreme Court held that the locus of the court possessing\n\nSection 11\njurisdiction would have to be determined on the basis of the\ncontractually fixed seat of arbitration i.e. Hong Kong.\n\n51. Extrapolating this reasoning to the facts of the present case, the\nagreement between the parties has contractually conferred jurisdiction,\nfor appointment of the arbitrator, on competent courts in the State of\nHaryana. In other words,\nSection 11\njurisdiction has, contractually\nbeen specifically conferred on the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.\nOnce such a specific conferral takes place, by the exclusive\njurisdiction clause framed by the parties themselves, in my view the\nprinciples enunciated in Mankastu Impex Pvt. Ltd.12 would operate to\nvest such exclusive jurisdiction, to that extent, only on such courts and\non no other. In other words, once exclusive jurisdiction, qua\nappointment of arbitrator under\nSection 11\nhas been vested in courts at\nHaryana, by agreement between the parties, that clause has to be\naccorded due respect, and this court would not, therefore, be entitled\nto exercise\nSection 11\njurisdiction in the matter.\n\n52. In view thereof, I specifically queried, learned Counsel for the\nparties, as to whether acceptance of the stand pleaded by them would\nnot result in this Court effectively nullifying the exclusive jurisdiction\nclause contained in the lease deed, and arriving at a decision contrary\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 21 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nto such clause. Learned Counsel candidly accepted that this may be\nthe result, if their arguments were accepted, but submitted that there\nwas no option but to so hold, in view of the fixation of the seat of\narbitration at New Delhi, read with\nSection 42\nof the 1996 Act.\n\n53. As already observed hereinabove, I am not inclined to agree\nwith this submission. Once the agreement between the parties\nspecifically confers\nSection 11\njurisdiction, for appointment of an\narbitrator, on courts at Haryana, this Court, in my view, would be\ndoing violence to the contractual covenant, if it were to exercise such\njurisdiction. There is no judgment of the Supreme Court, to which my\nattention has been invited, which permits a Court to exercise\njurisdiction contrary to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the\nagreement between the parties. Rather, the decisions in Swastik Gases\nPvt. Ltd.7 and Brahmani River Pellets Ltd.14 - both of which have\nbeen approvingly cited in BGS SGS Soma JV15 - emphasised the\nneed to adhere to the exclusive jurisdiction clause. At the cost of\nrepetition yet again, all decisions, which decide the question of\nterritorial jurisdiction on the basis of the seat of arbitration as\ndelineated in the agreement, deal with contracts in which there is no\nseparate exclusive jurisdiction clause, fixing jurisdiction elsewhere.\nWhere such a clause exists, and, especially, where such a clause fixes\n\nSection 11\njurisdiction with courts located elsewhere, I am not\ninclined to hold that this Court can, contrary to the explicit words and\nintent of said clause, exercise\nSection 11\njurisdiction and appoint an\narbitrator.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 22 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n54. In this context, the judgment which was cited by Mr. Sharma,\ni.e. Ramandeep Singh Taneja5, is useful. The arbitration agreement\nbetween the parties, in that case, read thus:\n\n\"In the event of any dispute/differences between the Company\nand/or the intending Allottee(s)/ buyer in ARB.P.No.444/2017\nPage 1 respect of any of the terms and or interpretation\nthereof or otherwise the same shall be referred to for\nadjudication to the sole arbitrator to be appointed by the\nCompany. The said arbitrator shall decide the issue(s) as per\nthe\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nor any\namendments thereto. The venue of the arbitration for the\nconvenience shall be the office of the Company. The decision\nof the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties to\nthe arbitration. The jurisdiction of all disputes will be Delhi\nonly. The venue for arbitration proceedings will be at\nFaridabad, Haryana.\"\n\nMr. Sharma invited my attention to para 9 of the judgment, which\nreads as under:\n\n\"9. In the present case we are faced with the situation\nwhere one part of the agreement provides for exclusive\njurisdiction to Courts of Delhi, while the other, due to the\nvenue of arbitral proceedings, vests exclusive jurisdiction in\nCourts in Faridabad, State of Haryana. As was held by the\nSupreme Court in the judgment of Bharat Aluminium\nCompany (Supra), a distinction is to be drawn between\n\"Subject-Matter of the Arbitration\" and \"Subject-Matter of the\nSuit\". For the purposes of identifying the Court, which shall\nhave supervisory control over the arbitral proceedings, it\nwould be the Court where the 'Subject-Matter of Arbitration'\nis situated that would have precedence over the Court where\nthe \"Subject-Matter of the Suit\" is situated. In this case,\ntherefore, the exclusive jurisdiction conferred due to venue of\narbitration would take precedence over the exclusive\njurisdiction vested over the Subject-Matter of the suit in the\nCourts at Delhi. There are various provisions in the Act where\nthe Court has to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the\narbitration proceedings. These include not only\nSection 11\nof\nthe Act but also\nSections 14\n,\n,\n29A\n,\nand\nof the Act. It\nis, therefore, evident that the Court having jurisdiction over\nthe arbitration proceedings would have precedence over the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 23 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nCourt which has jurisdiction over the Subject-Matter of the\nsuit or where the cause of action has arisen. The purported\nconflict between the two parts of Clause 24 quoted above can\nbe resolved by holding that where the disputes are to be\nadjudicated without reference to the arbitration, Courts at\nDelhi would have exclusive jurisdiction, however, where they\nhave to be resolved through arbitration, venue being at\nFaridabad, Haryana, the Courts at Faridabad, State of\nHaryana, would have exclusive jurisdiction.\"\n\n(Italics and underscoring supplied)\n\n55. Where, therefore, the seat of arbitration is at place X, and\nexclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit is conferred\non courts at place Y, a petition under\nSection 11\nwould unquestionably\nlie before the courts at place X. The present case, however, is\ndifferent, as the exclusive jurisdiction conferred by the arbitration\nagreement is not in respect of the subject matter of the suit but\nspecifically for appointment of an arbitrator. It would be doing\nviolence to the said clause, therefore, if this Court were to treat the\nexclusive jurisdiction clause as limited to the subject matter of the suit,\nand exercise\nSection 11\njurisdiction contrary to the mandate thereof.\n\n56. It is trite that a court cannot re-write a contract between the\nparties. Where the contract between the parties, as in the present case,\nconfers exclusive jurisdiction, for appointment of an arbitrator, on\ncourts at Haryana, any petition, under\nSection 11\n, would have to be\npreferred before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, and not\nbefore this Court. There is no decision, to which my attention has\nbeen invited, which persuades me to take a different view.\n\n57. Mr. Srivastava points out that the judgements of this Court\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 24 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nnamely Devyani International Ltd.2 and N.J. Construction3 (rendered\nby a learned Single Judge in each case), however, did deal with\nsituations in which exclusive jurisdiction was vested with Courts\nsituated elsewhere than the contractually fixed seat of arbitration.\nHowever, the wording of the exclusive jurisdiction clause, in these\ncases, was conspicuously different from that in the present case. In\nDevyani International Ltd2 it was ordained, in the contract that\n\"Courts at Mumbai shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to entertain\nthe dispute or suit arising out of or in relation to this agreement.\"\nSimilarly, in N.J. Construction3, it was stipulated, in the arbitration\nagreement, that \"a question or dispute arising out of or in anyway\nconnected with this agreement and contract shall be deemed to have\narisen in Guwahati and only the Guwahati courts shall have the\njurisdiction to determine the same\". As such, neither of these cases\ndealt with a situation in which the contract specifically conferred\njurisdiction, for appointment of the arbitrator, on courts at a particular\nlocation, as in the present case. Further, N.J. Construction3, in fact,\ncreated a legal fiction, by deeming disputes to have arisen at Guwahati\nand, as a result thereof, conferring jurisdiction on Courts at Guwahati,\nto deal therewith. These decisions, cannot, therefore, be of assistance\nin the present case.\n\n58. Aarka Sports Management Pvt. Ltd4 - on which, too, Mr.\nSrivastava relied - did not deal with any conflict between the\nexclusive jurisdiction clause and the seat of arbitration clause, for the\nsimple reason that there was no seat of arbitration clause. The\ncontract, however, stipulated that the jurisdiction of the agreement\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 25 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\nwould be exclusively \"in the Courts of New Delhi, India\". In this\nbackground, this Court held that, as Delhi was not the seat of\narbitration, and no cause of action arose at Delhi, this Court would not\nhave jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Though Mr. Srivastava\nplaces reliance on the general principle, enunciated in para 24 of the\nreport in the said case, to the effect that \"once the seat is determined,\nthe Court of that place shall have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with all\nmatters relating to the arbitration agreement between the parties\", that\nprinciple, in my view, would necessarily be required to be applied\nwith caution in a case such as the present, where exclusive\njurisdiction, qua a particular relief - specifically, appointment of the\narbitrator - available under the 1996 Act, is contractually conferred\non courts located elsewhere than at the seat of arbitration.\n\n59. This is the position which, according to me, emanates from\nMankastu Impex Pvt. Ltd.12 and which, necessarily, must follow in\nthe present case as well. Once the contract between the parties has\nfixed Courts at Haryana, as having jurisdiction to appoint the\narbitrator, any such application under\nSection 11\nof the 1996 Act, has\nnecessarily to be preferred before the High Court of Punjab and\nHaryana and not before this Court. In view of such a particular and\nspecific contractual dispensation, which reflects the intent of the\nparties and which the court cannot rewrite18, I am of the opinion that\nthe stipulation, in the Lease Deed, that the place of arbitration is New\nDelhi, cannot confer\nSection 11\njurisdiction on this Court.\nFir st Flight Cour ier\nLtd v.

Mr. Srivastava seeks to distinguish the decision in Mankastu\nImpex Pvt. Ltd.12 on the ground that it dealt with international\ncommercial arbitration, and proceeded on the basis that the curial law\ngoverning the arbitration, would be the law applicable in India. I have\nrelied on the decision in Mankastu Impex Pvt. Ltd.12 only for the\nproposition that, if jurisdiction, qua any particular provision or relief\navailable under the 1996 Act, is to be exercised by Courts located\nelsewhere than at the seat of arbitration, such jurisdiction has to be\nspecifically contractually conferred. The Supreme Court noticed\n,\nin\nthat case\n, that para 7.3 of the contract between the parties conferred\nspecific jurisdiction, for obtaining interim relief, on courts at New\nDelhi. Notably, the Supreme Court did not find this stipulation to be\nillegal, or conflicting with\nSection 42\nof the 1996 Act. Neither did\nthe Supreme Court find this contractual dispensation 2 conflict with\nthe seat of arbitration clause, fixing the seat of arbitration at Hong\nKong. Rather, the Supreme Court held that, as jurisdiction of Courts at\nNew Delhi was specifically conferred only with respect to obtaining of\ninterim relief, it would not extend to a petition under\nSection 11\nfor\nappointment of an arbitrator. In the present case, however, the\nexclusive jurisdiction clause is specifically with respect to\nappointment of an arbitrator and relates therefore, directly to\nSection\nof the 1996 Act.\nAs such, the fact that Mankastu Impex Pvt. Ltd.12\nmay have been dealing with an international commercial arbitration,\nor that the curial law, in that case was the law applicable in India,\ncannot affect the applicability of the said decision to the controversy\nin issue before me.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 27 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n61. In view thereof, I am constrained to express my disagreement\nwith the submission, advanced by both learned Counsel at the Bar,\nthat this Court would be possessed of territorial jurisdiction to\nentertain the present petition.\n\n62. I am conscious of the fact that Clause 25.4 of the lease deed, in\nthe present case, stipulates that \"either Party may approach a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction at Haryana for appointment of the Sole\nArbitrator\". The use of the word \"may\", in my view, cannot, however,\nconfer the discretion, on the petitioner, to choose the court, before\nwhich to file the\nSection 11\npetition. Conferment of such discretion\nwould, clearly, reduce the contractual stipulation to a redundancy, and\nrender it otiose. One may also refer, usefully, in this context, to the\nexpressio unius est exclusio alterius principle as, once \"courts and\nHaryana\" were conferred, contractually, with the jurisdiction to decide\nthe petitions for appointment of the arbitrator, the jurisdiction of\ncourts, elsewhere, stood excluded by implication. For an instance of\nthe application of this principle, one need look no further than the\njudgement of the Constitution bench in BALCO6, and the manner in\nwhich\nthe said decision\ninterpreted\nSection 2(2)\nof the 1996 Act. It\nwas sought to be contended, before the Supreme Court\n,\nin that case\n,\nthat, as\nSection 2(2)\nmerely stated that Part I of the 1996 Act would\napply to arbitration is held in India, without using the word \"only\",\nbefore the word \"held\", it did not exclude the applicability of Part I to\nforeign arbitrations. This argument was negatived, by the Supreme\nCourt, applying the expressio unius est exclusio alterius principle, and\nholding, consequently, that the absence of the word \"only\", in Section\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\n\nSINGH NEGI\n\nSigning Date:19.11.2020 ARB. P. 328/2020 Page 28 of 29\n\n19:26:23\n\n2(2) would make no difference. It was held that, once it was\nstipulated that Part I applied to arbitrations held in India, by\nimplication, the applicability of the said Part stood excluded, in the\ncase of foreign arbitrations. By analogy, once Clause 25.4 permitted\nthe parties, to the lease deed, to approach courts of competent\njurisdiction, in Haryana, to appoint the arbitrator, the discretion, to\napproach courts outside Haryana, for the said purpose, stood excluded\nby implication. The present petition, having been filed before this\nCourt, for the said purpose is, therefore, in my view, incompetent.\n\n63. For want of territorial jurisdiction, and without entering into the\nmerits of the relief sought in the petition, this petition is, therefore,\ndismissed. Needless to say, this order would not prevent the petitioner\nfrom moving the appropriate court, for appointment of an arbitrator, as\nthis Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the petition.\n\n64. At this stage, Mr. Sharma, for the respondent, submits that he\nhas instructions to refute the claims of the petitioner, and to contend\nthat termination of the lease, by the petitioner, was illegal. As I am\nnot entering into the merits of the petition, this submission is merely\nrecorded and no finding is returned thereon.\n\n65. There shall be no orders as to costs.\n\nC.
