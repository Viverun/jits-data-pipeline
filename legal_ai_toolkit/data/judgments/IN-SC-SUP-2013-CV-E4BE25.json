Appellants\n\nVersus\n\nAshok Kumar Srivastava & Anr. ...Respondents\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nDipak Misra, J.\n\nLeave granted.\n\n2. The 1st respondent was appointed as a Lecturer on 23.3.1996 in “Ras\nShastra” in Rajkiya Ayurvedic College and Chikitsalaya, Lucknow. The State\nGovernment vide notification dated 21.12.1990 notified the Service Rules,\nnamely, Uttar Pradesh Ayurvedic Aur Unani Mahavidyalaya Aadhyapako Ki Seva\nNiyamawali, 1990 (for short, “the rules”) for the teachers of Uttar Pradesh\nAyurvedic Colleges. Under the rules, the promotional post from amongst\nthe Lecturers is Readers. As the vacancies in respect of Readers were not\nfilled up, the respondent No. 1 preferred W.P. No. 1136 (S/B) of 2004\nbefore the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad at Lucknow Bench, Lucknow,\nwherein the High Court took note of the statement by the learned counsel\nfor the State and directed that it should be in the fitness of things that\nthe Public Service Commission shall make earnest efforts to expedite the\nwhole process relating to promotion within a period of six months.\nEventually, on 15.6.2005 the U.P. Public Service Commission, (for short\n‘the Commission’), the respondent No. 2 herein, recommended the names of\nsix persons for promotion to the post of Readers. As far as the respondent\nNo. 1 is concerned, he was placed at serial No. 6 and it was mentioned\ntherein that the vacancy in respect of which the 1st respondent had been\nrecommended for promotion had arisen after the superannuation of one Dr.\nHari Shanker Pandey on 31.7.2001. The state Government considering the\nrecommendation of the commission issued an office memorandum on 16.8.2005\npromoting the 1st respondent and given him the posting in State Auyrvedic\nCollege, Lucknow. As the 1st respondent was given seniority w.e.f.\n16.8.2005 which is the date of passing of the order of promotion he felt\naggrieved and the said grievance compelled him to prefer O.A. No. 134 of\n2006 before the U.P. State Public Service Tribunal (for short “the\ntribunal”). The tribunal by order dated 2.2.2007 directed that the\napplicant therein should submit a representation to the Government within a\nperiod of one month against the order dated 16.08.2005 which shall be\ndisposed of within two months by passing a reasoned order. In pursuance of\nthe aforesaid order the State of U.P. vide letter dated 4.6.2007 sought a\nclarification from the Commission about its recommendation and after\nreceipt of the said communication from the Commission and on due\ndeliberation vide order dated 2.1.2008 the representation of the 1st\nrespondent was rejected and it was clearly stated that seniority had been\naccorded to him from the date of passing of the order of promotion i.e.\n16.8.2005.\n\n3. Grieved by the order rejecting the representation the respondent No.\n1 preferred W. P. No. 1268 (S/B) of 2008 before the High Court contending,\ninter alia, that he was entitled to be given retrospective seniority with\neffect from the date when the vacancy had arisen. The stand and stance put\nforth by him was opposed by the State and its functionaries by filing a\ncounter affidavit that as per Rule 21 of 1990 rules the respondent’s\nseniority had been correctly fixed from the date of promotion but not from\nthe date when the vacancy arose. The 1st respondent brought to the notice\nof the High Court that ten persons had been conferred seniority with\nretrospective effect and he had been discriminated. The High Court\nplacing reliance on a three-Judge Bench decision in\nKeshav Chandra Joshi\nand Others v. Union of India and Others\n[1] and after reproducing paragraph\n24 of the said Judgment expressed the opinion that the principle laid down\ntherein was binding and on that rationale distinguished the decision in\n\nNirmal Chandra Sinha v. Union of India\n[2]. The High Court further\nproceeded to state that the service rules itself empower the Government to\ndecide the seniority from the date of vacancy and when ten promotees had\nbeen accorded seniority relating back to the date of arising of vacancy,\ndenial of the similar benefit to the petitioner by adopting a different\ncriteria amounted to hostile discrimination inviting the frown of\nArticle\nof the Constitution. Being of this view, the Division Bench of the High\nCourt quashed the impugned order dated 2.1.2008 and directed the\nrespondents therein to consider the case of the petitioner and pass a fresh\norder in accordance with the verdict given by it. The penetrability of the\naforesaid order is called in question by the State of U.P and its\nfunctionaries in this appeal by way of special leave.\n\n4. It is submitted by Mr. P. N. Misra, learned senior counsel appearing\nfor the appellant that the High Court has flawed by placing reliance on the\ndecision rendered in\nKeshav Chandra Joshi\n(supra), as the same was\ndelivered in a different context and that apart the ratio that has been\nculled out by the High court from the said pronouncement is not the correct\none. The learned senior counsel has criticized the reasoning that when the\nservice rule itself empowers the Government to decide the seniority from\nthe year of vacancy, the Government is not justified in deciding the\nseniority of the 1st respondent from the date of promotion to the post of\nReader. It is his further submission that the High Court has committed a\ngrave factual error by opining that under Rule 21 of the 1990 rules when\nseniority was accorded to 10 persons form the date of vacancy, non-granting\nof the similar benefit to the respondent did tantamount to hostile\ndiscrimination, though it had clearly been brought on record that seniority\nof all the promoted candidates was fixed from the date of promotion and not\nfrom the respective dates when the vacancies had arisen.\n\n5. Mr. Aseem Chandra, learned counsel appearing for the contesting\nrespondent No. 1, per contra, urged that the High Court has properly\napplied the principle stated in\nKeshav Chandra Joshi\n(supra) and same being\na three-Judge Bench decision has been aptly followed and, hence, the\nanalysis made by the High court cannot be found fault with. Learned\ncounsel would submit as the department had not filled up the promotional\nposts, the respondent was constrained to approach the High Court and on the\nbasis of the direction issued by the High court when the posts had been\nfilled up, it was incumbent on the authorities to reckon the seniority from\nthe date when the vacancy had occurred. It is propounded by him that the\nlanguage of Rule 21 of the 1990 rules confers discretionary power on the\nState Government and in the case at hand the authorities in an inequitable\nmanner have failed to exercise the said power and, therefore, the High\nCourt is absolutely justified in issuing directions for fixation of\nseniority with retrospective effect and, therefore, the order passed by it\nis absolutely impregnable.\n\n6. At the very outset, we think it appropriate to deal with the facet\nof hostile discrimination. The High Court, as is manifest, has opined that\nten promotees have been accorded seniority relating back to the date when\nthe vacancies arose. Reference has been made to Rule 20. It is worthy to\nnote that an additional affidavit has been filed on behalf of the\nappellants clarifying the position that ten incumbents to whom the benefit\nof retrospective seniority was extended, they were selected under Rule 15\nof Uttar Pradesh State Medical College Teacher Service (Second Amendment)\nRules, 2005. The said amended rules were brought into force on 12.5.2005\nto amend the Uttar Pradesh State Medical Colleges Teachers Service Rules,\n1990. Rule 15 of original rules dealt with procedure for recruitment by\npromotion. The amended Rule 15 of 2005 provides the procedure for\nrecruitment by personal promotion. Rule 20 of the original rules dealt\nwith seniority and it has been amended and in the present incarnation the\nsaid Rule reads as follows: -\n\n“20. Seniority – The seniority of persons substantively appointed in\nany category of posts in the service shall be determined in accordance\nwith the Uttar Pradesh Government Servants Seniority Rules, 1991, as\namended from time to time.\n\nProvided that a person appointed to a post except the post of\nAssociate Professor or Professor on the recommendation of the\nCommission for which the requisition had been sent to the Commission\nbefore the commencement of the Uttar Pradesh State Medical colleges\nTeacher Service (Second Amendment) Rules, 2005 shall be entitled to\nseniority from the date of his appointment notwithstanding the fact\nthat a teacher has been given personal promotion to the same post\nunder rule 15 in the same recruitment year.”\n\nThus, on a plain reading of Rule 20 it is perceptible that certain\ncategories of incumbents are entitled to seniority from the date of their\nappointment notwithstanding the fact that they have been conferred personal\npromotion to the same post under Rule 15 in the same recruitment year. It\nis evident that benefit of seniority has been given to the incumbents who\nare governed by a different set of rules altogether. The High Court, as we\nnotice, has referred to Rule 21 of 1990 rules which governs the case of the\nrespondent No. 1. The said Rule clearly stipulates that if an order of\nappointment specifies a particular back date with effect from which a\nperson is substantively appointed then only that date will be deemed to be\nthe date of the order of substantive appointment. From the narration of the\naforesaid facts, it is demonstrable that respondent is governed by\ndifferent set of rules and the promotions that have been given to other\ncategory of teachers are under separate set of rules. When the seniority\nis governed by two separate set of rules, it is inconceivable that one can\nclaim seniority on the basis of the rule relating to determination of\nseniority enshrined in the other rules. The respondent No. 1 is bound to\nbase his case under Rule 21 of the 1990 rules by which he is governed.\nThus analysed, we find that the High Court has misdirected itself by\nrecording the finding that there has been hostile discrimination. The\nquestion of hostile discrimination would have arisen had the State\nGovernment extended the benefit under Rule 21 of the 1990 rules to\nsimilarly placed persons governed by the same Rules. That being not the\nposition we are afraid that the view expressed by the High Court on that\nscore is not sustainable.\n\n7. In this context, it is seemly to state that the names of candidates\nselected by the Selection Committee in its meeting held on 19.5.2005 were\nsent to the Commission. Be it noted, six candidates, namely, Dr Hari\nShanker Pandey, Dr. Jai Ram Verma, Dr. S.K. Arya, Dr. V.P. Upadhyaya, Dr.\nLal Bahadur Singh and Dr. Ashok Kumar Srivastava were found fit for\npromotion and none of them was given retrospective seniority from the date\nwhen the vacancy arose. The High Court has placed reliance on the\nrecommendation of the Public Service Commission which was a reply to the\nquery dated 4.6.2007. The commission by letter dated 10.8.2007 had stated\nthat recommendation has been made for promoting Dr. Ashok Kumar Srivastava\non the post of Reader of Ayurvedic and Unani Colleges w.e.f. the date of\nvacancy created on account of the superannuation of Dr. Hari Shanker Pandey\non 31.7.2001. It is condign to note here that the commission in his\nclarificatory recommendation had amended its letter dated 2.7.2007.\nIt is\nalso perceivable that the language used in the communication by the\nCommission is not free from ambiguity. That apart, the discretion, if any,\nrests with the Government. Be that as it may, the recommendations of the\ncommission cannot be treated to be binding on the State Government. (See\n\nJatinder Kumar and Others v. State of Punjab\n[3].) Thus, it is perceptible\nthat all the incumbents promoted along with the respondent No. 1 were given\nseniority from the date of promotion and not from the date when the\nvacancies arose. Therefore, the factum of arbitrary discrimination does\nnot arise and accordingly we are unable to concur with the view of the High\nCourt.\n\n8. Presently, we shall advert to the rule position. The relevant part\nof Rule 21 of the 1990 rules by which the 1st respondent is governed, is\nreproduced below:-\n\n“21. Seniority – (1) Except as hereinafter provided, the seniority of\npersons in any category of posts shall be determined from the date of\nthe order of substantive appointment and if two or more persons are\nappointed together by the order in which their names are arranged in\nthe appointment order :\n\nProvided that if the appointment order specifies a particular\nback date with effect from which a person is substantively appointed,\nthat date will be deemed to be the date of order of substantive\nappointment and in other cases, it will mean the date of issue of the\norder :\n\nProvided further that, if more than one orders of appointment\nare issued in respect of any one selection the seniority shall be as\nmentioned in the combined order of appointment issued under sub-rule\n(3) of rule 18 :\n\nProvided also that a candidate recruited directly may lose his\nseniority if he fails to join without valid reasons when vacancy is\noffered to him, the decision of the appointing authority as to the\nvalidity of reason shall be final.”\n\n9. On a studied scrutiny of the aforesaid Rule, it is vivid that the\nseniority of the candidates is to be determined from the date of order of\nsubstantive appointment. The proviso carves out an exception by\nstipulating that if the appointment order specifies a particular back date\nwith effect from which a person is substantively appointed that date will\nbe deemed to be the order of substantive appointment otherwise it would be\nthe date of the issue of the order. The second proviso clarifies that the\nseniority will be determined when more than one orders of appointment are\nissued in respect of any one selection. From the aforesaid, it is luminous\nthat unless otherwise stipulated in the letter of appointment the seniority\nhas to be computed from the date of appointment to the post. In the case\nat hand, nothing has been stipulated in the letter of appointment. The\nHigh Court while granting retrospective seniority with consequential\nbenefits has placed reliance on the principle stated in\nKeshav Chandra\nJoshi\n(supra). In the said case, controversy related to fixation of\nseniority between direct recruits and the promotees. A three-Judge Bench\ntook note of the plea which was to the effect that promotees should be\ndeclared to have been regularly appointed from the respective dates of\ntheir initial promotion as Assistant Conservators of Forest with all\nconsequential benefits. To substantiate the said plea it was urged that\nthough the promotees were appointed on ad hoc basis due to non-availability\nof direct recruits to the vacant posts of Assistant Conservators of Forest,\nyet they were continuing for well over 5 to 12 years discharging the same\nduties, drawing the same scale of pay without any reversion and, therefore,\nthe posts held by them were not fortuitous, nor stop gap. In this backdrop\nit was contended that the entire continuous length of service from the\ndates of their initial promotion should be counted towards their seniority.\nIn opposition, it was urged that the appointment of the promotees\nadmittedly being ad hoc, they had no right to the posts and hence, their\nseniority could be counted only from the dates of their substantive\nappointment. The Court after scanning the anatomy of relevant rules opined\nthat in order to become a member of the service he/they must satisfy two\nconditions, namely, the appointment must be in substantive capacity and the\nappointment has to be to the post in the service according to rules and\nwithin the quota to a substantive vacancy. The learned Judges observed\nthat there exists a marked distinction between appointment in a substantive\ncapacity and appointment to the substantive post. Therefore, the\nmembership to the service must be preceded by an order of appointment to\nthe post validly made by the Governor. Then only he/they become\nmember/members of the service. The Court further stated that any other\nconstruction would be violation of the Rules. After so expressing, the\nCourt posed two questions :-\n\n“When promotees become members of the cadre of Assistant Conservators\nin accordance with the rules, and whether the entire length of service\nfrom the date of initial appointments should be counted towards their\nseniority.”\n\nThereafter, analyzing the entire gamut of case law, opined that employees\nappointed purely on ad hoc or officiating basis due to administrative\nexigencies, even though continued for a along spell, do not become the\nmembers of the service unless the Governor appoints them in accordance with\nthe rules, and so they are not entitled to count the entire length of their\ncontinuous officiating or fortuitous service towards their seniority.\nEventually, in paragraph 24 which has been reproduced by the High Court in\nentirety in the impugned order to build the edifice of its reasoning, in\nessence, it has been laid down thus: -\n\n“It is notorious that confirmation of an employee in a substantive\npost would take place long years after the retirement. An employee is\nentitled to be considered for promotion on regular basis to a higher\npost if he/she is an approved probationer in the substantive lower\npost. An officer appointed by promotion in accordance with Rules and\nwithin quota and on declaration of probation is entitled to reckon his\nseniority from the date of promotion and the entire length of service,\nthough initially temporary, shall be counted for seniority. Ad hoc or\nfortuitous appointments on a temporary or stop gap basis cannot be\ntaken into account for the purpose of seniority, even if the appointee\nwas subsequently qualified to hold the post on a regular basis. To\ngive benefit of such service would be contrary to equality enshrined\nin\nArticle 14\nread with\nArticle 16(1)\nof the Constitution as unequals\nwould be treated as equals. When promotion is outside the quota, the\nseniority would be reckoned from the date of the vacancy within the\nquota, rendering the previous service fortuitous. The previous\npromotion would be regular only from the date of the vacancy within\nthe quota and seniority shall be counted from that date and not from\nthe date of his earlier promotion or subsequent confirmation.”\n\nIn the ultimate conclusion the learned Judges ruled as follows:-\n\n“Accordingly we have no hesitation to hold that the promotees have\nadmittedly been appointed on ad hoc basis as a stop gap arrangement,\nthough in substantive posts, and till the regular recruits are\nappointed in accordance with the rules. Their appointments are de hors\nthe rules and until they are appointed by the Governor according to\nrules, they do not become the members of the service in a substantive\ncapacity. Continuous length of ad hoc service from the date of initial\nappointment cannot be counted towards seniority.”\n\n10. From the aforesaid, it is clear as day that what is meant by\nreckoning of seniority from the date of vacancy in the context of the facts\nof\nthe said judgment\nhas been wholly misunderstood by the High Court.\n\nIn\nthe case of\nKeshav Chandra Joshi\n(supra), the controversy that arose\npertained to the seniority between direct recruits and promotees. The\nCourt opined that when promotion is given beyond the quota of the\npromotees, the seniority has to be reckoned from the date of vacancy\narising within the quota meant for the promotees. The Court further\nobserved that the previous promotion would be regular only from the date of\nvacancy within the quota and the seniority shall be counted only from that\ndate and not from date of earlier promotion or subsequent confirmation.\nThe factual matrix, the relevant rules, the concepts of direct recruit\nquota and the promotee quota and the fortuitous appointment and the\nprinciple stated therein have nothing to do with grant of retrospective\nseniority in the context of the present case.\n\nThus, we have no scintilla\nof doubt that the High Court has erroneously applied the\nratio\nlaid down in\n\nKeshav Chandra Joshi\n(supra).\n\n11. The thrust of the matter is how the seniority is to be determined in\nsuch circumstances.\nIn\nUnion of India v. S.S. Uppal and another\n,[4] it has\nbeen opined that the seniority of a person is to be determined according to\nthe seniority rule applicable on the date of appointment. It has also been\nobserved that weightage in seniority cannot be given retrospective effect\nunless it is specifically provided in the rule in force at the material\ntime.\n\n12.\nIn\nState of Karnataka and others v. C. Lalitha\n[5] it has been\nobserved that it is well settled that seniority should be governed by rules\nand a person should not be allowed to derive any undue advantage over other\nemployees, for concept of justice demands that one should get what is due\nto him or her as per law.\n\n13.\nIn\nState of Uttaranchal and another v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma\n[6] it has\nbeen clearly stated that seniority has to be decided on the basis of rules\nin force on the date of appointment and no retrospective promotion or\nseniority can be granted from a date when an employee has not even been\nborn in the cadre.\n\n14.\nIn\nNirmal Chandra Singh\n(supra) it has been ruled that promotion\ntakes effect from the date of being granted and not from the date of\noccurrence of vacancy or creation of the post. It has also been laid down\ntherein that it is settled in law that date of occurrence of vacancy is not\nrelevant for the determination of seniority.\n\n15. Learned senior counsel for the appellants has drawn inspiration from\nthe recent authority in\nPawan Pratap Singh and others v. Reevan Singh and\nothers\n,[7] where the Court after referring to earlier authorities in the\nfield has culled out certain principles out of which the following being\nthe relevant are reproduced below:\n\n“(ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be\ndetermined as per the service rules. The date of entry in a particular\nservice or the date of substantive appointment is the safest criterion\nfor fixing seniority inter se between one officer or the other or\nbetween one group of officers and the other recruited from different\nsources. Any departure therefrom in the statutory rules, executive\ninstructions or otherwise must be consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of occurrence\nof the vacancy and cannot be given retrospectively unless it is so\nexpressly provided by the relevant service rules. It is so because\nseniority cannot be given on retrospective basis when an employee has\nnot even been borne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely\naffect the employees who have been appointed validly in the meantime.”\n\n16. In view of the aforesaid enunciation of law, the irresistible\nconclusion is that the claim of the first respondent for conferment of\nretrospective seniority is absolutely untenable and the High Court has\nfallen into error by granting him the said benefit and accordingly the\nimpugned order deserves to be lancinated and we so do.\n\n17. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the order passed by the High\nCourt is set aside. The parties shall bear their respective costs.\n\n…………………………….J.\n[Anil R.

UNDER THE RULES, THE PROMOTIONAL POST FROM AMONGST THE LECTURERS IS READERS. AS THE VACANCIES IN RESPECT OF READERS WERE NOT FILLED UP, THE RESPONDENT NO. 1 PREFERRED W.P. NO. 1136 (S/B) OF 2004 BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD AT LUCKNOW BENCH, LUCKNOW, WHEREIN THE HIGH COURT TOOK NOTE OF THE STATEMENT BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE STATE AND DIRECTED THAT IT SHOULD BE IN THE FITNESS OF THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION SHALL MAKE EARNEST EFFORTS TO EXPEDITE THE WHOLE PROCESS RELATING TO PROMOTION WITHIN A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS. EVENTUALLY, ON 15.6.2005 THE U.P. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, (FOR SHORT ‘THE COMMISSION’), THE RESPONDENT NO. 2 HEREIN, RECOMMENDED THE NAMES OF SIX PERSONS FOR PROMOTION TO THE POST OF READERS. AS FAR AS THE RESPONDENT NO. 1 IS CONCERNED, HE WAS PLACED AT SERIAL NO. 6 AND IT WAS MENTIONED THEREIN THAT THE VACANCY IN RESPECT OF WHICH THE 1ST RESPONDENT HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR PROMOTION HAD ARISEN AFTER THE SUPERANNUATION OF ONE DR. HARI SHANKER PANDEY ON 31.7.2001.
