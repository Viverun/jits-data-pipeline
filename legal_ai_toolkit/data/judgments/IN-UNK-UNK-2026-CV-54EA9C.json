Gemini, Deputy Advocate General assisted by Mr. Lalit Miglani, Brief Holder for\nthe State of Uttarakhand/respondent no. 1.\n\nMr. Ravi Babulkar, Advocate for respondent no. 2.\n\n Dated: 28th September, 2018\n\n1. A vexed question which arises for consideration before this\nCourt is with regard to the extent of exercising the powers by this Court\nunder \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. so far it relates to the composition of\noffences punishable under \nSection 307\n I.P.C. as well as the offences\nunder \nSections 147\n, \n148\n, \n149\n, \n323\n, \n504\n and \n325\n of Indian Penal Code,\n1860 (henceforth to be called as '\nI.P.C\n.') Though they have been\nanswered by the various judgments rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court\nfrom both the prospective but, they have to be considered together in\nharmony to arrive at a rationale balance in its applicability. To elucidate\nits applicability and to the manner, in which, it has to be applied\ndepending upon the circumstances of the each case and the\ncircumstances and factors leading to the commission of offence sought\nto be compounded. The present C482 Application would be dealing\nwith the offences under \nSections 307\n and \n506\n I.P.C. The factual\nbackdrop of this particular case is as under :\n\n2. Initially, an F.I.R. was registered for offences under\n\nSections 285\n and \n506\n I.P.C., read with under \nSection 27\n and\n u/s 30\n of\nthe Arms Act. During the course of investigation, it was found by the\nInvestigating Officer that the offence under \nSection 285\n I.P.C. as alleged\n\n 2\n\nin F.I.R. is not made out and \nSection 307\n I.P.C. was added to it. Thus,\nultimately charge sheet was submitted for the offences under \nSections\n307\n and \n506\n I.P.C. This C482 Application was called for from the\nRegistry, on a mention being made by the counsel for the parties. The\napplicant and respondent No. 2 are present in person and they have been\nduly identified by their respective counsel. The offences which are being\nsought to be compounded in the present C482 Application emanates\nfrom Case Crime No. 111/2016, registered under \nSections 307\n & \n506\n of\nI.P.C. at Police Station Raipur, District Dehradun, which was ultimately\non submission of the charge sheet, being Charge Sheet No. 69A/16\ndated 03.09.2016, was registered as Criminal Case No. 3577/2016 \n'State\nvs. Pan Singh Rana\n', on which, after submission of charge-sheet, the\nsummoning order was issued on 15.09.2016. Consequently, the present\nC482 Application has been preferred questioning the summoning order\ndated 15.09.2016, Charge-Sheet No. 69A/16 dated 03.09.2016 as well as\nthe entire criminal proceedings, pending before IInd Additional Chief\nJudicial Magistrate. The applicant has sought the following relief :\n\n \n\"It is, therefore, Most Respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble\n Court may graciously be pleased to quash / set-aside charge-sheet\n dated 29.08.2016 as well as the summoning order dated\n 05.09.2016 passed by the learned IInd Additional Chief Judicial\n Magistrate, Dehradun in Criminal Case No. 3577 / 2016 (\nState\n Vs. Pan Singh Rana\n) (Case Crime No. 111/2016), under \nSections\n 307\n, \n506\n of I.P.C. registered at Police Station - Raipur, District -\n Dehradun and further to quash the entire proceedings of the\n aforesaid Criminal Case No. 3577 / 2016 (\nState Vs. Pan Singh\n Rana\n) (Case Crime No.111/2016), under \nsections 307\n, \n506\n of\n I.P.C. registered at Police Station - Raipur, District-Dehradun\n pending in the court of learned IInd Additional Chief Judicial\n Magistrate, Dehradun, and / or to pass such other and further\n order which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the\n facts and circumstances of the case.\"\n\n3. The Compounding Application, which has been preferred\njointly by the parties to the present 482 Application by invoking \nSection\n320\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicants submit that the\nparties to the C-482 Application had settled their dispute outside the\nCourt and the complainant/respondent no. 2, herein, who is present apart\n\n 3\n\nfrom filing affidavit has categorically stated before this Court that he\ndoes not want to prosecute the applicant any further for the offences\nunder \nSections 307\n and \n506\n of I.P.C. as has been registered against the\npresent applicant by way of criminal case.\n\n4. The argument of the applicant's counsel is that though\nthere had been an accidental fire without there being any deliberate and\nmotivated intention to harm or cause injury, and rather in fact no injury\nwas caused on respondent no. 2 and, as such, as a matter of fact, there\nare no ingredients available which are required for prosecution under\n\nSection 307\n of I.P.C., which could be said to have been made out. In the\nCompounding Application, particularly in paragraph-3, it has been\nsubmitted by complainant/respondent no. 2 that he does not want to\nfurther prosecute the applicant and a written compromise has been\nentered into between the parties on 09.09.2018, which is on record duly\nsigned by both the parties, where the terms of the compromise has been\nsettled between them. The relevant part of settlement is quoted\nhereunder:\n\n \"le>kSrkukek\n Jh fd\"ku flag pkSgku iq= Jh ch0,l0 pkSgku mi vkcdkjh fujh{kd\n eq[;ky; nsgjknwu gky irk ch&307 f}rh;ry lgL=/kkjk jslhMsUlh lgL=/kkjk\n jksM] nsgjknwuA\n\n -----------iz\n\n -----------izFkei{k\n ,oa\n Jh iku flag jk.kk iq= Jh vkye flag jk.kk vkcdkjh flikgh Mk.Mk\n y[kkS.M lSDVj izFke] nsgjknwu gky irk& 131 lkSa/kksokyh iks-vks- d.Mksyh ftyk\n nsgjknwu\n\n -------------f}rh;i{k\n\n -------------f}rh;i{k\n fofnr gks fd izFkei{k ,oa f}rh;i{k ,d gh foHkkx esa dk;Zjr gSAa\n ;g fd fnukad 23-07-2016 dks i{kdkjksa dh vkil esa dgklquh gks xbZ Fkh\n ftlds pyrs izFkei{k us xyrQgeh@vkos\"ko\"k eqdnek vijk/k la[;k&111@16\n Fkkuk jk;iqj esa iathd`r djk fn;k Fkk ftldk okn ekuuh; U;k;ky; eq[;\n U;kf;d eSftLVªsV nsgjknwu ds U;k;ky; esa fopkjk/khu gSA mijksDr ?kVuk fnukad\n\n 4\n\n 23-07-2016 ds laca/k esa f}rh;i{k }kjk Hkh xyrQgeh@vkos\"ko\"k ,d izFke lwpuk\n fjiksVZ eqdnek vijk/k la[;k&116@17 Fkkuk jk;iqj esa iathd`r djk j[kh gSA\n ;g fd orZeku esa vkilh tku igpku@fe=x.kksa }kjk i{kdkjksa ds e/;\n vkilh le>kSrk djk fn;k gS rFkk leLr xyrQgfe;ka nwj djk nh xbZ gSaA\n orZeku esa i{kdkjksa ds e/; ,d nwljs ds izfr dksbZ fxyk f\"kdok ugha jg x;k gSA\n ;g fd vc nksuksa i{kdkj gq, le>kSrs ds Øe esa vius vius okn ij dksbZ\n cy ugha nsuk pkgrs gSa rFkk mls lekIr djkuk pkgrs gSa o eqdneksa dh lekfIr gsrq\n tks Hkh vko\";d dk;Zokgh@izkFkZuki=@\"kiFki=@O;fDrxr mifLFkfr tgka\n Hkh@ftl Hkh U;k;ky; esa vko\";d gksxh ogka mifLFkr gksus ds fy, ikcUn gS vkSj\n jgsaxsA\"\n\n5. Considering the fact that they belong to the same\nDepartment and the fact that it was an accidental fire at spur of moment\ndue to heated reaction in fact there was no intention as such to inflict\ninjury on respondent no. 2, and also considering the fact that both the\nparties unanimously agree that the C482 Application may be allowed.\n\n6. Mr. Lalit Miglani, Brief Holder for the State, vehemently\nopposes the application for compounding on the ground that the offence\nunder \nSection 307\n of the I.P.C. is not such an offence which could be\ncompounded under \nSection 320\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As\nit is a serious offence having grave implications and social impact and if\nit is permitted to be compounded, it will give a wrong message to\nsociety and may result in augmenting the crime.\n\n7. Principally, there is no dispute with regard to the legal\npreposition, which has been argued by Mr. Lalit Miglani, learned Brief\nHolder for the State but, this Court cannot be oblivious of the fact that\nwhen there happens to be a joint affidavit filed by the parties, wherein,\nthe complainant himself has submitted that he does not want to\nprosecute the applicant and, therefore, even then, if the parties to the\ndispute are forced to face the trial apart from the fact that it will cause\nuncalled hardship and embarrassment, it will not attain any fruitful\n\n 5\n\nconclusion. Besides increasing the apathy on the litigating parties\nunnecessary imposing a litigation on them, involving fruitless\ninvestment of time and money on the parties resulting to futility. This\nCourt is of the view that this Court while exercising its powers under\n\nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C., it can compound the offences by imposing\nconditions as \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex Court in various\njudgments, even those which are not compoundable under \nSection 320\n\nCr.P.C. The rationale behind the above philosophy is as under :\n\n8. Principally, for the purposes of scrutinizing the ambit of\npower of the Courts seized with the jurisdiction under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. or under \nArticles 226\n \n/ 227\n of the Constitution of India, the\nprime consideration is that as to how the equitable balance in exercise of\nsaid powers could be struck down for the purposes of exercising the\npowers under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. which deals with the composition of\noffences. The classification which has been held out by the Hon'ble\nApex Court is that a distinction has to be drawn between the ground of\nsettlement of disputes by the offenders amongst themselves in the terms\nacceptable by them as compared to the ambit and extent of the power,\nwhich has been given to the Court under Section 320 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n9. As a matter of fact, on its precise reading, both the\nsituations, i.e. when a criminal offence is being sought to be settled\nbased on the compromise or where the criminal offences are being\nsought to be settled by the invocation of \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C., they are\ndefinitely not interchangeable with one another because both are\nmaterially different as they deal with different parameters and grounds,\nto be considered, as in the first situation, the Court has to exercise its\ninherent power under C-482 or under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of\nConstitution of India which cannot be circumscribed and limited by the\nstipulations contained under \nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. which deals with\nsecond concept. \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, so far as it relates to the\nprovisions contained under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C., it could very well be\n\n 6\n\nsaid, it only guides the consideration to be borne in mind by the Courts\nwhen the Court exercises a power for composition of an offence in an\nabsence of settlement under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C.. In such a situation,\nwhere the Court exercise the power, obviously, the implication of Sub-\nsection (2) of Section 320 and Sub-section (9) of \nSection 320\n of the\nCr.P.C. has to be taken into consideration which limits the scope of\nexercise of powers by the Courts. But, a situation where the criminal\ndisputes, irrespective of its nature of offences, its seriousness is being\nsettled by the terms arrives at, the provisions contained under \nSection\n320\n of the Cr.P.C. is not to be strictly made applicable to athwart the\nsettlement between the parties. Only rider which has been attached\nthereto which requires caution when the Courts are settling the disputes\nin relation to the offences which are of serious in nature, for example\n\nSections 302\n, \n306\n, \n307\n and \n376\n I.P.C., and such other sexual offences,\nthe Court's will have to consider to attract its inherent power depending\nupon the material and the nature of the offences which is under\nconsideration to be settled in terms of the compromise. There cannot be\nany strait jacketed formula for deciding the criminal controversy\nbetween the parties based on the settlement as each settlement has its\nown facts and nature of offence and the circumstances in which it has\nbeen committed which will call upon the court to consider pondering on\nthe issue of exercising inherent powers of compounding the offence, and\nthe controversy which is to be decided is based on the attraction of\n\nSection 320\n Cr.P.C., is altogether different ingredients.\n\n10. The basic ratio and the extent of power which the\nconstitutional Courts have, they are much distinct to the powers which\ncould be exercised by the criminal Courts for the purpose of\ncompounding the offences. The inherent powers of the Courts,\nparticularly, when seized with the powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and\n\nArticles 226\n \n/ 227\n of the Constitution of India, it has got a wide\nplentitude and the same cannot be circumscribed or limited to be\nexercised so as to meet the ends of justice instead of strictly considering\n\n 7\n\nthe inherent powers in relation to the powers under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C.\nWhat is necessary to be considered by the Constitutional Courts, while\ndeciding the matter based on the settlement, which is distinct to the\ncomposition of scope under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. These are the\nfollowing wider parameters for compounding offences based on the\nsettlement :\n\n 1. Whether such a settlement which has been arrived at between\n the parties for settling the criminal offence would secure the\n ends of justice.\n\n 2. As to whether it would prevent the abuse of process of Court\n unnecessarily forcing the litigants who has otherwise settled\n the disputes to undergo the criminal trial.\n\n 3. It has to consider its social impact and its affect on the society\n in an event if offence is compounded.\n\n Hence, the prime consideration for the Court is not only the\nnature of offence which is being sought to be settled but it also depends\nupon the considerations to be made by the Court having regard to the\nnature of dispute between the offender and the victim and the terms of\nits settlement, as to whether it is not ill motivated. The ratio which has\nalso been laid down that the Constitutional Courts while exercising the\ninherent powers would also have to take into consideration that whether\nby adopting a strict principle for declining to settle the criminal disputes\nbetween the offender and victim on the premise of the offence being of\nheinous nature, will it ultimately on the conclusion of the trial would\nhave an effective adjudication in a situation where the victim has settled\nthe dispute with the offenders does not derive his prosecution. Thus, the\nbasic intention for settling the heinous offences, which includes the\noffences under \nSections 307\n, \n306\n and \n376\n I.P.C., it should not be forced\nupon to be continued by denial of settlement on a technical ground of\nimplications of Sub-section (9) of Section 320 and Sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. so that ultimately on the culmination of the\nproceedings of the trial, it may not result to be a proceeding of futility.\n\n 8\n\n11. There is another aspect to be taken care of, as already\nobserved, the High Courts when it exercises the power under Section C-\n482 \nCr.P.C\n. and under \nArticles 226\n \n/ 227\n of the Constitution of India,\nthe High Courts have to apply the rationale approach which is not to be\nrestricted in a concise manner because apart from the fact that it has to\nensure that it meets the ends of justice, rather also that High Court has to\nensure that such concised interpretation does not lead to the abuse of\nprocess. The Court (in particular High Court) will also have to consider\nthat if such type of settlement voluntarily entered between the parties,\nexpressing their unrestricted opinion in terms of the compromise settled\ndown, it has to consider that if the comprise is sacredly entered into,\nwhether it would result into an establishment of harmony and\nunderstanding between the offenders and the victim. The only\nstipulation which has to be borne in mind while the High Court either\nunder Section 482 Cr.P.C., or under Article 226 and 227 of Constitution\nof India decides a criminal dispute, apart from the fact that it has not be\ninfluenced by the restriction of Section 320 Cr.P.C. It would depend\nupon the nature of offence, the terms of settlement, wider object it aims\nto achieve and the period at which the settlement is arrived at.\n\n12. The aforesaid ratio as discussed, came up for consideration\nin the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nGian Singh Vs.\nState of Punjab and another\n reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303, wherein,\nin its para 57, 58 and 61, the Court has held as under :-\n\n \"57. Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings on the\n ground of settlement between an offender and victim is not the\n same thing as compounding of offence. They are different and not\n interchangeable. Strictly speaking, the power of compounding of\n offences given to a court under Section 320 is materially different\n from the quashing of criminal proceedings by the High Court in\n exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences,\n power of a criminal court is circumscribed by the provisions\n\n 9\n\ncontained in Section 320 and the court is guided solely and\nsquarely thereby while, on the other hand, the formation of\nopinion by the High Court for quashing a criminal offence or\ncriminal proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the\nmaterial on record as to whether the ends of justice would justify\nsuch exercise of power although the ultimate consequence may be\nacquittal or dismissal of indictment.\n\n 58. Where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding\nhaving regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender and\nthe victim has been settled although the offences are not\ncompoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of\ncriminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in\nthe case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an\nend and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the\nultimate guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have\nharmful effect on the public and consist in wrongdoing that\nseriously endangers and threatens the well-being of the society\nand it is not safe to leave the crime-doer only because he and the\nvictim have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim has\nbeen paid compensation, yet certain crimes have been made\ncompoundable in law, with or without the permission of the court.\nIn respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or\nother offences of mental depravity under \nIPC\n or offences of moral\nturpitude under special statutes, like the \nPrevention of Corruption\nAct\n or the offences committed by public servants while working\nin that capacity, the settlement between the offender and the\nvictim can have no legal sanction at all. However, certain\noffences which overwhelmingly and predominantly bear civil\nflavour having arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial,\nfinancial, partnership or such like transactions or the offences\narising out of matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or\nthe family dispute, where the wrong is basically to the victim and\nthe offender and the victim have settled all disputes between them\n\n 10\n\namicably, irrespective of the fact that such offences have not been\nmade compoundable, the High Court may within the framework\nof its inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal\ncomplaint or FIR if it is satisfied that on the face of such\nsettlement, there is hardly any likelihood of the offender being\nconvicted and by not quashing the criminal proceedings, justice\nshall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated. The above\nlist is illustrative and not exhaustive. Each case will depend on its\nown facts and no hard-and-fast category can be prescribed.\n\n 61. The position that emerges from the above discussion\ncan be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing\na criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its\ninherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given\nto a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section\n320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no\nstatutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the\nguideline engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to secure the ends of\njustice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In\nwhat cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint\nor FIR may be exercised where the offender and the victim have\nsettled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances\nof each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before\nexercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to\nthe nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences\nof mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.\ncannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's\nfamily and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences\nare not private in nature and have a serious impact on society.\nSimilarly, any compromise between the victim and the offender in\nrelation to the offences under special statutes like the \nPrevention\nof Corruption Act\n or the offences committed by public servants\nwhile working in that capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis\n\n 11\n\n for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But\n the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominatingly\n civil flavour stand on a different footing for the purposes of\n quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial,\n financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or\n the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or\n the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or\n personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire\n dispute. In this category of cases, the High Court may quash the\n criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\n between the offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction\n is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal case would\n put the accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme\n injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal\n case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with\n the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether\n it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue\n with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal\n proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite\n settlement and compromise between the victim and the\n wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is\n appropriate that the criminal case is put to an end and if the\n answer to the above question(s) is in the affirmative, the High\n Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal\n proceeding.\"\n\n13. The Hon'ble Apex Court has held that settlement of\ncriminal disputes by way of a compromise has to be distinctly treated\nfrom different prospective and has not to be camouflaged and eclipsed\nby the provision of \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. but only rider imposed are the\nguidelines as framed by the Hon'ble Apex Court. It has to consider as\nto whether despite the offences being of a serious nature, what was its\n\n 12\n\ngravity, whether it was of private nature and such other factors which\nhas been \nlaid down in\n \nthe said judgment\n.\n\n14. The intention and purpose of \nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. is\nrather spirited to attain a public policy with regard to the composition of\nan offence and that is why, it enlists the offences which are\ncompoundable and the manner in which its composition could be made\nby the courts. But, it does not limit the power of High Courts while\nexercising its inherent powers. \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. reads as\nunder :\n\n \"482. Saving of inherent powers of High Court.--\n Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the\n inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be\n necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to\n prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure\n the ends of justice.\"\n\n Even on a simplicitor reading of provisions contained under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., which is quoted hereinabove, on its simple reading\nof its language and analyzing the legislative instant, it suggests that by\nvirtue of the said provision, the power which has been vested with the\nSuperior Courts, apart from the fact that it intends to prevent the abuse\nof process, it also aims to achieve the ends of justice and that is why the\nprovision of \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. has been given an overriding effect to\nany other provisions contained in the Code because it precedes with the\nword \"nothing in this code\". Obviously, it would over ride under\n\nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. too.\n\n15. Under normal law of interpretation, by the use of aforesaid\nwords, \"nothing in this code\", the provision of \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C.\nwould have an effect of being an overriding provision and there is no\ndoubt about the fact that the other provisions of the \nCriminal Procedure\nCode\n will not limit or restrict the inherent powers to be exercised by the\nHigh Court. Rather, it could also be said that the powers vested with the\n\n 13\n\nHigh Courts while exercising powers under Section C-482 \nCr.P.C\n. is not\nan addition to the power but rather it is the power which intends to\nsafeguards the abuse which may occur on account of enforceability of\nother provisions under the Code, and is spirited to meet the ends of\njustice in its wider social implication. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the\ncase of \nGian Singh\n (Supra), in its para 53 and 54 has held as under :-\n\n \"53. Section 482 of the Code, as its very language suggests,\n saves the inherent power of the High Court which it has by virtue\n of it being a superior court to prevent abuse of the process of any\n court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. It begins with the\n words, \"nothing in this Code\" which means that the provision is\n an overriding provision. These words leave no manner of doubt\n that none of the provisions of the Code limits or restricts the\n inherent power. The guideline for exercise of such power is\n provided in Section 482 itself i.e. to prevent abuse of the process\n of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. As has\n been repeatedly stated that Section 482 confers no new powers on\n the High Court; it merely safeguards existing inherent powers\n possessed by the High Court necessary to prevent abuse of the\n process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. It is equally\n well settled that the power is not to be resorted to if there is\n specific provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of\n an aggrieved party. It should be exercised very sparingly and it\n should not be exercised as against the express bar of law\n engrafted in any other provision of the Code.\n\n 54. In different situations, the inherent power may be\n exercised in different ways to achieve its ultimate objective.\n Formation of opinion by the High Court before it exercises\n inherent power under Section 482 on either of the twin objectives,\n\n (i) to prevent abuse of the process of any court, or (ii) to secure\n the ends of justice, is a sine qua non.\"\n\n 14\n\n16. The aforesaid preposition is guided on a principle factor\nthat it is judicial obligation on the constitutional Courts which has to be\nunfettered as aimed by section 482 Cr. P.C. to prevent a public wrong\nwhich is a duty casted by implication of law, in the course of\nadministration of justice, so as to prevent unnecessary judicial process\ndispensation of justice amongst litigating parties. It also constitutes to be\nhaving an inherent element of the administration of justice, which\nbecomes an integral part of courts function.\n\n The aforesaid principle is based upon a maxim, called as \"quando\nlex aliquid alicui concedit, conceditur et id sine quo res ipsa esse non\nprotest.\"\n\n The aforesaid maxim infers that whenever a particular action is to\nbe taken as a matter in the course of discharge of duty, which is required\nto be done to attain impossible, it attains to perform a real, complete and\nsubstantial justice for the purposes for which the Courts are created and\npossessed with its plenary powers conferred under Section C-482\nCr.P.C.\n\n17. The Five-Judge Bench of Haryana High Court, in the case\nof \nKulwinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab\n, reported in (2007) 4 CTC\n769, was identically called upon to answer the powers of High Court\nwhich it can exercise under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. while considering\nthe composition of offence under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. and settling of a\ndispute on the basis of the compromise arrived between offender and the\nvictim. Apart from laying down the wide ratio pertaining to the nature\nof offence involved in the said case, it has laid down a broader\nguidelines to the effect that any offence in relation to a human body,\nother than murder and culpable homicide, they can be permitted to be\ncompounded when the Courts on the basis of material on record, forms\nan opinion in terms of the settlement between the parties that such a\nsettlement, when it is fair not ill motivated and voluntary, it could be\ncompounded. In addition to it, there is another test which has to be\nconsidered is that such type of terms of settlement for a heinous offence,\n\n 15\n\nresulting to bodily injury, each terms of settlement has to satisfy the\nconscious of the Courts and it has to be seen that it has been fairly\narrived at without any duress or oppression being made by the offenders\non the victim taking advantage of its autocratic capacity on the victim\nand also it has to be seen that as to whether the weak victim have not\nbeen made vulnerable to the powers of the superiors. This judgment,\ntoo, has provided that the only factors to be considered by the High\nCourt under C-482 \nCr.P.C\n. is to prevent the abuse of the process of any\nCourt and to secure the ends of justice, uphold law its intentions, under a\ngiven set of circumstances amongst the parties.\n\n18. An issue which crops up for consideration before this Court\nat this stage to be considered is as to what would be the impact of Sub-\nsection (9) of \nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. which absolutely creates a bar\nthat the offences other than the offences referred under \nSection 320\n\nCr.P.C. cannot be compounded. What has been dealt with and the ratio\nas \nlaid down by\n the Apex Court in the case of \nGian Singh\n (Supra),\nsince having held that the plenary power conferred on the High Court\nunder C-482 is not circumscribed and restricted by the power under\n\nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. and it would not in any way create an\nembargo or curtail the powers, as there is no statutory bar in exercise of\npowers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. The relevant part of the Five-Judges\nBench judgment of Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of\n\nKulwinder Singh\n (Supra), in its para 23 and 25 has laid down as\nunder:\n\n \"23. No embargo, be in the shape of \nSection 320(9)\n CrPC,\n or any other such curtailment, can whittle down the power under\n \nSection 482\n CrPC.\n\n * * *\n\n 25. The only inevitable conclusion from the above discussion\n is that there is no statutory bar under \nCrPC\n which can affect the\n inherent power of this Court under Section 482. Further, the same\n\n 16\n\n cannot be limited to matrimonial cases alone and the court has the\n wide power to quash the proceedings even in non-compoundable\n offences notwithstanding the bar under \nSection 320\n CrPC, in\n order to prevent the abuse of law and to secure the ends of justice.\n The power under \nSection 482\n CrPC is to be exercised ex debito\n justitiae to prevent an abuse of process of court. There can neither\n be an exhaustive list nor the defined parameters to enable a High\n Court to invoke or exercise its inherent powers. It will always\n depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The power\n under \nSection 482\n CrPC has no limits. However, the High Court\n will exercise it sparingly and with utmost care and caution. The\n exercise of power has to be with circumspection and restraint.\n The court is a vital and an extraordinary effective instrument to\n maintain and control social order. The courts play role of\n paramount importance in achieving peace, harmony and\n everlasting congeniality in society. Resolution of a dispute by\n way of a compromise between two warring groups, therefore,\n should attract the immediate and prompt attention of a court\n which should endeavour to give full effect to the same unless\n such compromise is abhorrent to lawful composition of the\n society or would promote savagery.\"\n\n19. In view of what has been discussed, it could be said that the\npower of compounding on one hand under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C., and\nquashing of the criminal proceedings, charge sheets, summoning orders\nor compounding of offence based on settlement in exercise of inherent\npowers are not to be treated as synonymous to one other but only has to\nbe restricted by the condition precedent to satisfy the criteria of these\ntwo different and distinct aspects of law for compounding of an offence\nso as to render substantial justice. What is to be seen is also important,\nas to the communality, its harmony of the offence which is to be settled\nin the exercise of powers in favour of the accused persons. This Court is\nof the view that if there are sufficient element available that the\n\n 17\n\nsettlement was fairly entered into without any oppression being\nexercised as against the victim, and it ultimately results into resolving\nthis discord amongst the parties to a lis, the bar of Sub-section (9) of\n\nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. for composition of an offence would not come into\nplay when the Court exercises its inherent powers under C-482, which\nalso legislatively has administratively purpose of enforcing justice.\n\n20. The aspect pertaining to the composition of offence and its\nambit and amplitude came up for consideration in the case of \nNikhil\nMerchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and another\n reported\nin (2008) 9 SCC 677. Although it was in relation to the offence under\n\nSections 420\n, \n467\n, \n468\n and \n471\n of the I.P.C. read with \nSection 5 (2)\n and\n\n5 (1) (d)\n of the Prevention of Corruption Act, but it has widely laid\ndown the principles of compounding and settlement under \nSection 320\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. Para 6 of \nthe said judgment\n reads as\nunder:\n\n \"6. Before the High Court, it was urged that since the\n subject-matter of the dispute had been settled between the\n appellant and the Bank, it would be unreasonable to continue with\n the criminal proceedings which had been commenced on a\n complaint filed on behalf of the Bank having particular regard to\n Clause 11 of the consent terms by which the parties had\n withdrawn all claims against each other. It was submitted that the\n learned Special Judge had erred in rejecting the appellant's prayer\n for discharge from the criminal case.\"\n\n21. It has been held in principle to the effect that once subject\nmatter of the dispute, it has been voluntarily settled between the parties,\nit would be absolutely unreasonable to continue with the criminal\nproceedings which has commenced on a complaint, though, despite the\nfact that the offences alleged may prime facie have been made out. \nThe\nJudgment of Nikhil Merchant\n (Supra) in its para 8 had more or less\n\n 18\n\nreiterated the ratio as \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\njudgment of \nState of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal\n reported in 1992 Supp.\n\n(1) SCC 335, which too, has provided the determination of powers of\nthe High Courts under Section C-482 \nCr.P.C\n.. Para 8 of the judgment\nof \nNikhil Merchant\n (Supra) reads as under :-\n\n \n\"8. Apart from \nthe said decision\n, reliance was also placed\n on another decision of this Court in \nB.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana\n\n wherein while dealing with the proceedings under Sections 498-A\n and 406 of the Penal Code involving matrimonial disputes and\n offences, this Court held that even though the provisions of\n \nSection 320\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not apply\n to such offences which are not compoundable, it did not limit or\n affect the powers under \nSection 482\n CrPC and the powers\n conferred on the High Courts and the Supreme Court under\n \nArticles 226\n and \n136\n of the Constitution of India.\n \nReferring to the\n decision of this Court in \nState of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal\n this\n Court observed that the categories indicated in the said case\n which warranted exercise of power under \nSection 482\n CrPC were\n only illustrative and not exhaustive. This Court ultimately held\n that the High Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash\n criminal proceedings or an FIR or complaint and \nSection 320\n\n CrPC does not limit or affect the power of the High Court under\n Section 482 of the Code.\"\n\n22. The High Court in the exercise of its power under Section\n482 quashes a criminal proceeding having regard to the fact of each case\nthat dispute between the offender and victim stood settled. It does so, as\nin its opinion, continuation of criminal proceedings will be an exercise\nin futility and justice in the case demands that the dispute between the\nparties is put to an end and peace amongst parties is restored; securing\nthe ends of justice being the ultimate guiding factor for administration of\njustice. It is an inevitable conclusion that crimes committed between\n\n 19\n\nparties, do have a social effect as it is a crime against a society and it\ndefeats the very fabric of reformatic concept of criminal law of our\ncountry, at time composition of offence based on settlement, may not\nbe safe so as to leave crime doer. But still there are exceptions which\nhave been carved out by judicial precedents where wrong is against a\nprivate individual. The High Court may within the framework of its\ninherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal complaint or\nF.I.R if it is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly\nany likelihood of offender being convicted and by not quashing the\ncriminal proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of justice shall\nbe defeated.\n\n23. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the aforesaid case of \nGian\nSingh\n (Supra) has also dealt with the judgment in the cases of \nB.S.\nJoshi and others Vs. State of Haryana and another\n reported in (2003)\n4 \nSCC 675 and Nikhil Merchant\n (Supra).\n\n24. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nB.S. Joshi\n (Supra),\nhas held as follows:\n\n \"6. \nIn \nPepsi Food Ltd. & Anr. v. Special Judicial Magistrate &\n Ors.\n [(1998) 5 SCC 749], this Court with reference to \nBhajan\n Lal\n's case observed that the guidelines laid therein as to where the\n court will exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code\n could not be inflexible or laying rigid formulae to be followed by\n the courts. Exercise of such power would depend upon the facts\n and circumstances of each case but with the sole purpose to\n prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure\n the ends of justice. It is well settled that these powers have no\n limits. Of course, where there is more power, it becomes\n necessary to exercise utmost care and caution while invoking\n such powers.\n\n 8. It is, thus, clear that Madhu Limaye's case does not lay\n down any general proposition limiting power of quashing the\n criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint as vested in Section 482\n of the Code or extra ordinary power under \nArticle 226\n of the\n Constitution of India. We are, therefore, of the view that if for the\n purpose of securing the ends of justice, quashing of FIR becomes\n necessary, Section 320 would not be a bar to the exercise of\n\n 20\n\npower of quashing. It is, however, a different matter depending\nupon the facts and circumstances of each case whether to exercise\nor not such a power.\n\n10. \nIn \nState of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy & Ors.\n [(1977) 2\nSCC 699], considering the scope of inherent power of quashing\nunder Section 482, this Court held that in the exercise of this\nwholesome power, the High Court is entitled to quash\nproceedings if it comes to the conclusion that ends of justice so\nrequire. It was observed that in a criminal case, the veiled object\nbehind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on\nwhich the structure of the prosecution rests and the like would\njustify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in the interest\nof justice and that the ends of justice are higher than the ends of\nmere law though justice had got to be administered according to\nlaws made by the legislature. This Court said that the compelling\nnecessity for making these observations is that without a proper\nrealization of the object and purpose of the provision which seeks\nto save the inherent powers of the High Court to do justice\nbetween the State and its subjects, it would be impossible to\nappreciate the width and contours of that salient jurisdiction. On\nfacts, it was also noticed that there was no reasonable likelihood\nof the accused being convicted of the offence. What would\nhappen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the\nimputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier\nnoticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was registered\nat her instance due to temperamental differences and implied\nimputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the\nimputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved\ndisputes with her husband and his other family members and as a\nresult thereof she has again started living with her husband with\nwhom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted\ncompany and is living happily on her own or has married\nsomeone else on earlier marriage having been dissolved by\ndivorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on\nsome other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would\nalmost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to\ndecline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would\nbe permitting the parties to compound non-compoundable\noffences. Answer clearly has to be in 'negative'. It would,\nhowever, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines\nthe prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of\nbona fides.\n\n11. \nIn \nMadhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia & Ors. v. Sambhajirao\nChandrojirao Angre & Ors.\n [(1988) 1 SCC 692], it was held that\nwhile exercising inherent power of quashing under Section 482, it\nis for the High Court to take into consideration any special\nfeatures which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is\n\n 21\n\n expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to\n continue. Where, in the opinion of the Court, chances of an\n ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is\n likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue,\n the court may, while taking into consideration the special facts of\n a case, also quash the proceedings.\n\n 15. In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High\n Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal\n proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section 320 of the Code\n does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the\n Code.\"\n\n25. The issue regarding the composition of an offence based on\nsettlement under \nSection 307\n of the I.P.C. was considered by the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dimpey Gujral and others Vs.\nUnion Territory through Administrator, UT, Chandigarh and\nothers reported in (2013) 11 SCC 497. This was a case where the\noffence which was considered to be compounded was at a stage when\nafter submission of the report under \nSection 173\n of the Cr.P.C., the\ncharges were already framed in relation to the offences as involved\ntherein, being the offences covered by \nSections 147\n, \n148\n, \n149\n, \n323\n, \n307\n,\n\n452\n and \n506\n I.P.C. Widely it involved the offences with which we are\nconcerned partially in the present matter and other connected cases.\n\n \nPrimarily, the said judgment which was dealing with the powers\nfor compounding the offence under \nSection 307\n I.P.C. has derived the\nratio and distinction which has been laid down in the case of \nGian\nSingh\n (Supra) regarding the inherent powers and powers given under\nstatute under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. and has held out that even the offences\nas narrated therein whichever is inclusive of offence under \nSection 307\n\nIPC, would be compoundable though not covered by \nSection 320\n of the\nCr.P.C. Para 8 of the judgment of Dimpey Gujral (Supra) reads as\nunder :-\n\n \"8. In the light of the above observations of this Court in\n Gian Singh, we feel that this is a case where the continuation of\n criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of\n law because the alleged offences are not heinous offences\n\n 22\n\n showing extreme depravity nor are they against the society. They\n are offences of a personal nature and burying them would bring\n about peace and amity between the two sides. In the\n circumstances of the case, FIR No. 163 dated 26-10-2006\n registered under \nSections 147\n, \n148\n, \n149\n, \n323\n, \n307\n, \n452\n and \n506\n\n IPC at Police Station Sector 3, Chandigarh and all consequential\n proceedings arising therefrom including the final report presented\n under Section 173 of the Code and charges framed by the trial\n court are hereby quashed.\"\n\n26. It was arising out of the judgment rendered by the Punjab\nand Haryana High Court, wherein, while exercising the jurisdiction\nunder Section C-482 \nCr.P.C\n., the High Court has declined to quash the\nF.I.R. under \nSections 307\n, \n324\n and \n323\n/\n34\n I.P.C., based on the\ncompromise entered between the victim and the offender and the reason\nfor refusal which has been recorded by the Punjab and Haryana High\nCourt was that the offence being heinous in nature would fall to be an\noffence not compoundable under \nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C and bar of\nSub-section (9) of \nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. come into play as it has an\nelement of being a social offence and also the stage at which, the\nsettlement for the offences aforesaid was under consideration, was an\nissue before the High Court was the stage when the investigation stood\ncompleted, challan has been presented in the Court and the accused\nwere charged and the matter was pending before the Trial Court. It was\nat that stage that in C-482 proceedings by way of criminal petition, a\nprayer was made for quashing of the F.I.R.. In the said case, settlement\nthus arrived, following assertions were made :-\n\n 1. Complainant has specially made a statement that he has no\n intention to prosecute the offender.\n\n 2. The situation where the complainant agrees that he has got no\n objection for quashing of the proceedings.\n\n 3. Where the offenders and the victim have undertaken in writing\n that in writing or by way of affidavit that they do not intent to\n\n 23\n\n undertake and indulge in any criminal offences against one\n another.\n\n 4. Based on the criminal offences alleged, they do not want to\n litigate any further.\n\n 5. As a consequence of such settlement in writing or by way of\n affidavit, when it results into futile exercise on culmination of\n the criminal proceedings and,\n\n 6. Lastly, when in an event of declining to accept such settlement\n covering the aforesaid condition would result into unnecessary\n wastage of time of the Court as well as the Investigating\n Agency and would cause unnecessary hardship and wastage of\n time to the parties to the dispute.\n\n27. These are the wider governing factors, which have to be\nborne in mind by the High Court when even serious offence like that of\n307 \nIPC\n, which happens to be in the instant case, is sought to be\ncompounded. The High Courts before whom such an application for\ncomposition of offence comes for consideration, based on the\nsettlement, the High Court is not denuded of its powers to consider its\npropriety while exercising its inherent powers under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C., which will not be eclipsed and overridden by the restriction of\nSub-section (9) of \nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. because Section 320 itself\nas already observed above, it will not in view of language used under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. which has an overriding effect, derived power of\nthe Court to decide application for heinous offences also as inherent\npower is independent to the circumstances for compounding under\n\nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. Because the experience do not rule out a situation\nwhere on most of the occasions, the criminal act is taken on account of a\nspur of moment, on account of verbal fighting, and on account of a\nheated discussion and moment, which are to be considered while\nconsidering the application for composition.\n\n 24\n\n28. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nNarendra Singh\n\n(Supra), has laid down the wider principles and circumstances as to\nhow the power to compromise an offence should be exercised as there\nhappens to be a subtle distinction between the composition of offence\nexercising inherent power and the power which is given to the Court\nunder \nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. Para 9 of the judgment of \nNarendra\nSingh\n (Supra) reads as under :-\n\n \"9. At the same time, one has to keep in mind the subtle\n distinction between the power of compounding of offences given\n to the court under Section 320 of the Code and quashing of\n criminal proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent\n jurisdiction conferred upon it under Section 482 of the Code.\n Once it is found that compounding is permissible only if a\n particular offence is covered by the provisions of Section 320 of\n the Code and the court in such cases is guided solitarily and\n squarely by the compromise between the parties, insofar as power\n of quashing under Section 482 of the Code is concerned, it is\n guided by the material on record as to whether the ends of justice\n would justify such exercise of power, although the ultimate\n consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment.\"\n\n29. The normal philosophy and the psychology with courts\nwhich persists when an offence of such nature comes into consideration\nbefore the Court of law pertaining to a bodily harm being inflicted,\nwhereas, in the instant case which happens to be contended to be an\nattempt to take life of another person under \nSection 307\n of I.P.C. It\nbecomes imperative no doubt that heinous crimes too have to be treated\nas a crime against the society and not against any individual. But, there\nis a distinction while giving an offence a flavor of a social crime as in\nrelation to the personal crime covered under \nSection 307\n I.P.C. For\nsuch type of offences, the basic underlining principle for classifying it to\nbe a public crime is to act as a deterrent for the people at large and\n\n 25\n\nhence, in para 17 of the \nNarendra Singh\n Case (Supra), it has been\ndealt with as under :-\n\n \"17. We would like to expand this principle in some more\n detail. We find, in practice and in reality, after recording the\n conviction and while awarding the sentence/punishment the court\n is generally governed by any or all or combination of the\n aforesaid factors. Sometimes, it is the deterrence theory which\n prevails in the minds of the court, particularly in those cases\n where the crimes committed are heinous in nature or depict\n depravity, or lack morality. At times it is to satisfy the element of\n \"emotion\" in law and retribution/vengeance becomes the guiding\n factor. In any case, it cannot be denied that the purpose of\n punishment by law is deterrence, constrained by considerations of\n justice. What, then, is the role of mercy, forgiveness and\n compassion in law? These are by no means comfortable questions\n and even the answers may not be comforting. There may be\n certain cases which are too obvious, namely, cases involving\n heinous crime with element of criminality against the society and\n not parties inter se. In such cases, the deterrence as purpose of\n punishment becomes paramount and even if the victim or his\n relatives have shown the virtue and gentility, agreeing to forgive\n the culprit, compassion of that private party would not move the\n court in accepting the same as larger and more important public\n policy of showing the iron hand of law to the wrongdoers, to\n reduce the commission of such offences, is more important. Cases\n of murder, rape, or other sexual offences, etc. would clearly fall in\n this category. After all, justice requires long-term vision. On the\n other hand, there may be offences falling in the category where\n the \"correctional\" objective of criminal law would have to be\n given more weightage in contrast with \"deterrence\" philosophy.\n Punishment, whatever else may be, must be fair and conducive to\n good rather than further evil. If in a particular case the court is of\n\n 26\n\n the opinion that the settlement between the parties would lead to\n more good; better relations between them; would prevent further\n occurrence of such encounters between the parties, it may hold\n settlement to be on a better pedestal. It is a delicate balance\n between the two conflicting interests which is to be achieved by\n the court after examining all these parameters and then deciding\n as to which course of action it should take in a particular case.\"\n\n30. About the nature of offence as contemplated under \nSection\n307\n I.P.C. which is normally dealt with as to be a public offence, this\naspect was considered in Dimpey Gujral Case (Supra), which, in turn,\nwhile considering the ratio rendered in \nGian Singh\n case (Supra), has\nheld that if the three ratio are read harmoniously, it has been provided\nthat the interpretation given to the offence under \nSection 307\n IPC may\nbe that they are social offence and it ought to be made punishable so as\nto made deterrent for offenders at large but simultaneously while\nreferring to \nthe said judgment\n of Dimpey Gujral (Supra), as well as\n\nNarinder Singh\n (Supra) has thus held that even at times, looking to the\ncircumstances, which led to commission of offence the nature of injury\ninflicted, the circumstances of commission of offence, they do at times\nmake an important consideration for compounding offence based on\nsettlement the offences under \nSection 307\n IPC also as to be a personal\noffence and not an offence against the society.\n \nThat is why in\n\nNarinder Singh\n (Supra) case, the Hon'ble Apex Court while drawing a\ndistinction as against the \nratio \nlaid down in\n the case of \nRajendra\nHarakchand Bhandari Vs. State of Maharashtra\n reported in (2011)\n13 SCC 311 and in the case of \nShiji Alias Pappu and others Vs.\nRadhika and another\n, reported in (2011) 10 SCC 705 and in the case\nof \nState of Rajasthan Vs. Shambhu Kewat and another\n reported in\n(2014) 4 SCC 149, where these judgments have invariably held that the\noffence under \nSection 307\n I.P.C. since being non-compoundable offence\ncovered by the Sub-section (9) of \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C would not be\ncompoundable.\n \nConsidering the ratio of making the offence as not\n\n 27\n\ncompoundable, irrespective of the settlement arrived at between the\nparties, the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nNarinder Singh\n (Supra) has drawn\na distinction from the aforesaid judgment and has deviated to lay down\nthe ratio that even the offence under \nSection 307\n I.P.C., though heinous\nin nature, though at times it may be a social offence, but, the same\nwould still be dependent upon its own facts and circumstances which is\nthe prerogative of the Court to consider in each case when the same is\nbeing decided on the basis of the settlement while exercising its plenary\npowers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. or under \nArticle 226\n /227 of the\nConstitution of India.\n \nIt would be apt to refer to para 22 and 23 of the\njudgment of \nNarendra Singh\n (Supra) case.\n\n \"22. Thus, we find that in certain circumstances, this Court\n has approved the quashing of proceedings under \nSection 307\n IPC\n whereas in some other cases, it is held that as the offence is of\n serious nature such proceedings cannot be quashed. Though in\n each of the aforesaid cases the view taken by this Court may be\n justified on its own facts, at the same time this Court owes an\n explanation as to why two different approaches are adopted in\n various cases. The law declared by this Court in the form of\n judgments becomes binding precedent for the High Courts and\n the subordinate courts, to follow under \nArticle 141\n of the\n Constitution of India. Stare decisis is the fundamental principle of\n judicial decision-making which requires \"certainty\" too in law so\n that in a given set of facts the course of action which law shall\n take is discernible and predictable. Unless that is achieved, the\n very doctrine of stare decisis will lose its significance. The related\n objective of the doctrine of stare decisis is to put a curb on the\n personal preferences and priors of individual Judges. In a way, it\n achieves equality of treatment as well, inasmuch as two different\n persons faced with similar circumstances would be given identical\n treatment at the hands of law. It has, therefore, support from the\n human sense of justice as well. The force of precedent in the law\n is heightened, in the words of Karl Llewellyn, by \"that curious,\n\n 28\n\n almost universal sense of justice which urges that all men are to\n be treated alike in like circumstances\".\n\n 23. As there is a close relation between equality and justice,\n it should be clearly discernible as to how the two prosecutions\n under \nSection 307\n IPC are different in nature and therefore are\n given different treatment. With this ideal objective in mind, we\n are proceeding to discuss the subject at length. It is for this reason\n we deem it appropriate to lay down some distinct, definite and\n clear guidelines which can be kept in mind by the High Courts to\n take a view as to under what circumstances it should accept the\n settlement between the parties and quash the proceedings and\n under what circumstances it should refrain from doing so. We\n make it clear that though there would be a general discussion in\n this behalf as well, the matter is examined in the context of the\n offences under \nSection 307\n IPC.\"\n\n31. On a wider principle, the aspects which are to be\nconsidered while dealing with the composition of offence is to be based\non the terms of settlement, its spirit of amicable settlement and also the\nintention of the parties to bury their hatchet to live in harmony. This\nhas also to be considered with regard to the advantageous or\ndisadvantageous situation of the parties, their social status, their mental\nstatus, to understand their well being, the circumstance under which the\noffence has been committed and basically the intention of such\nsettlement to establish harmony and restoring friendly ties between the\noffenders and it does not intent to defeat the process of law and the\nvictim. The issue which crops as to when the party is in such a\nsituation when they inspires to settle their score, whether the law and the\nCourt should create a hurdle by giving its immature opinion to the\nsettlement? \nThus, Narinder Singh\n case (Supra), in para 26 has laid\ndown the circumstances for deciding the dispute, based on the\nsettlement in relation to the heinous crime. Para 26 reads as under :\n\n 29\n\n \"26. Having said so, we would hasten to add that though it\n is a serious offence as the accused person(s) attempted to take the\n life of another person/victim, at the same time the court cannot be\n oblivious to hard realities that many times whenever there is a\n quarrel between the parties leading to physical commotion and\n sustaining of injury by either or both the parties, there is a\n tendency to give it a slant of an offence under \nSection 307\n IPC as\n well. Therefore, only because FIR/charge-sheet incorporates the\n provision of \nSection 307\n IPC would not, by itself, be a ground to\n reject the petition under Section 482 of the Code and refuse to\n accept the settlement between the parties. We are, therefore, of\n the opinion that while taking a call as to whether compromise in\n such cases should be effected or not, the High Court should go by\n the nature of injury sustained, the portion of the bodies where the\n injuries were inflicted (namely, whether injuries are caused at the\n vital/delicate parts of the body) and the nature of weapons used,\n etc. On that basis, if it is found that there is a strong possibility of\n proving the charge under \nSection 307\n IPC, once the evidence to\n that effect is led and injuries proved, the Court should not accept\n settlement between the parties. On the other hand, on the\n basis of prima facie assessment of the aforesaid circumstances, if\n the High Court forms an opinion that provisions of \nSection 307\n\n IPC were unnecessarily included in the charge-sheet, the Court\n can accept the plea of compounding of the offence based on\n settlement between the parties.\"\n\n32. However\n, \nthe said judgment\n has created a specific bar that\nwhen such an agreement for settling the dispute of a heinous crime is\nbased on the compromise which is being sought to be arrived at, at an\nappellate stage, when the accused has already been held guilty, no such\npower of composition of offence at the appellate stage could be made.\n\nHence, while concluding, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nNarinder Singh\n (Supra), in its para 29 has laid down the certain\n\n 30\n\nguiding factors to be adhered to for dealing with the composition based\non settlement.\n\n \"29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay\n down the following principles by which the High Court would be\n guided in giving adequate treatment to the settlement between the\n parties and exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code\n while accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings or\n refusing to accept the settlement with direction to continue with\n the criminal proceedings:\n\n 29.1. Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to\n be distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to\n compound the offences under Section 320 of the Code. No doubt,\n under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent power\n to quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are\n not compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter\n between themselves. However, this power is to be exercised\n sparingly and with caution.\n\n 29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on\n that basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed,\n the guiding factor in such cases would be to secure:\n\n (i) ends of justice, or\n\n (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.\n\n While exercising the power the High Court is to form an\n opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.\n\n 29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those\n prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences of\n mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such\n offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on\n society. Similarly, for the offences alleged to have been\n committed under special statute like the \nPrevention of Corruption\n Act\n or the offences committed by public servants while working\n\n 31\n\nin that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of\ncompromise between the victim and the offender.\n\n 29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and predominantly civil character, particularly\nthose arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of\nmatrimonial relationship or family disputes should be quashed\nwhen the parties have resolved their entire disputes among\nthemselves.\n\n 29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to\nexamine as to whether the possibility of conviction is remote and\nbleak and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to\ngreat oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be\ncaused to him by not quashing the criminal cases.\n\n 29.6. Offences under \nSection 307\n IPC would fall in the\ncategory of heinous and serious offences and therefore are to be\ngenerally treated as crime against the society and not against the\nindividual alone. However, the High Court would not rest its\ndecision merely because there is a mention of \nSection 307\n IPC in\nthe FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be\nopen to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of\n\nSection 307\n IPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has\ncollected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to\nproving the charge under \nSection 307\n IPC. For this purpose, it\nwould be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury\nsustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate\nparts of the body, nature of weapons used, etc. Medical report in\nrespect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the\nguiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High\nCourt can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of\nconviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In\nthe former case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash\nthe criminal proceedings whereas in the latter case it would be\n\n 32\n\npermissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding\nthe offence based on complete settlement between the parties. At\nthis stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the\nsettlement between the parties is going to result in harmony\nbetween them which may improve their future relationship.\n\n 29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under\nSection 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a\ncrucial role. Those cases where the settlement is arrived at\nimmediately after the alleged commission of offence and the\nmatter is still under investigation, the High Court may be liberal\nin accepting the settlement to quash the criminal\nproceedings/investigation. It is because of the reason that at this\nstage the investigation is still on and even the charge-sheet has\nnot been filed. Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed\nbut the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy\nstage, the High Court can show benevolence in exercising its\npowers favourably, but after prima facie assessment of the\ncircumstances/material mentioned above. On the other hand,\nwhere the prosecution evidence is almost complete or after the\nconclusion of the evidence the matter is at the stage of argument,\nnormally the High Court should refrain from exercising its power\nunder Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court\nwould be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to\ncome to a conclusion as to whether the offence under \nSection 307\n\nIPC is committed or not. Similarly, in those cases where the\nconviction is already recorded by the trial court and the matter is\nat the appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromise\nbetween the parties would not be a ground to accept the same\nresulting in acquittal of the offender who has already been\nconvicted by the trial court. Here charge is proved under \nSection\n307\n IPC and conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime\nand, therefore, there is no question of sparing a convict found\nguilty of such a crime.\"\n\n 33\n\n \nOn considering the aforesaid judgment and the ratio as\npropounded by his Lordships as a matter of fact even the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt has laid down that it would not be safe to hold that there is an\nabsolute bar of compounding the heinous offence, but, only precautions\nare the guidelines which have been \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in para 29 of the \nNarinder Singh\n (Supra) case.\n\n33. Often, whenever the question comes as to whether an\noffence is compoundable or not and whether the High Courts, which\nexercising its powers under Section C-482 \nCr.P.C\n. or under \nArticles 226\n\n/ 227\n of the Constitution of India, is seized with the settlement, what\nwould be the extent of its power, it has to consider it from the view\npoint with regard to nature of offence, which is being sought to be\ncompounded, if it happens to be of personal nature, for example, that of\nmatrimonial dispute, financial transactions, company matters or matter\npertaining to the \nNegotiable Instruments Act\n, the composition under\n\nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. or based on a settlement, has to be entered into\nkeeping in mind the personal nature of dispute as the settlement will not\nat all affect a public policy, rather it would result into the settlement of\npersonal dispute. This is the broader ratio as \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of \nMadan Mohan Abbot Vs. State of Punjab\n\nreported in (2008) 4 SCC 582. Para 5 of \nthe said judgment\n has dealt\nwith the aforesaid ratio, the same is quoted hereunder :\n\n \"5. It is on the basis of this compromise that the application\n was filed in the High Court for quashing of proceedings which\n has been dismissed by the impugned order. We notice from a\n reading of the FIR and the other documents on record that the\n dispute was purely a personal one between two contesting parties\n and that it arose out of extensive business dealings between them\n and that there was absolutely no public policy involved in the\n nature of the allegations made against the accused. We are,\n therefore, of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served\n in continuing with the proceedings in the light of the compromise\n\n 34\n\n and also in the light of the fact that the complainant has on 11-1-\n 2004 passed away and the possibility of a conviction being\n recorded has thus to be ruled out.\"\n\n It is rather postulated that whenever the Court comes to the\nconclusion that the offence has the private element, it has to liberally\nexercise its power while settling the dispute based on the compromise.\n\n34. A similar preposition pertaining to the composition of an\noffence under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and \nArticle 226\n \n/ 227\n of the\nConstitution of India, has been \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nthe case of \nGold Quest International Private Limited Vs. State of\nTamil Nadu and others\n reported in (2014) 15 SCC 235. Para 8 of \nthe\nsaid judgment\n reads as under :-\n\n \"8. \nIn view of the principle \nlaid down by\n this Court in the\n aforesaid cases, we are of the view that in the disputes which are\n substantially matrimonial in nature, or the civil property disputes\n with criminal facets, if the parties have entered into settlement,\n and it has become clear that there are no chances of conviction,\n there is no illegality in quashing the proceedings under \nSection\n 482\n CrPC read with \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution. However, the\n same would not apply where the nature of offence is very serious\n like rape, murder, robbery, dacoity, cases under the \nPrevention of\n Corruption Act\n, cases under the \nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\n Substances Act\n and other similar kind of offences in which\n punishment of life imprisonment or death can be awarded. After\n considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, we\n are of the view that the learned Single Judge did not commit any\n error of law in quashing the FIR after not only the complainant\n and the appellant settled their money dispute but also the other\n alleged sufferers entered into an agreement with the appellant,\n and as such, they too settled their claims.\"\n\n \nThe aforesaid judgment of \nGold Quest International\n (Supra)\nhas been rendered considering the principle \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble\n\n 35\n\nApex Court in Gian Singh as well as in \nNikhil Merchant\n (Supra)\ncases.\n\n35. The wider amplitude of powers which the High Courts\nhave held are not circumscribed to limit its plenary powers. The Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of \nState of Haryana and others Vs. Bhajan\nLal and others\n reported in 1992, Supl (1) SCC 335, while considering\nthe contention in its para 102 has classified the situation where and the\ncircumstances under which the constitutional Courts can exercise its\npowers, has held in para 102 as under :-\n\n \"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various\n relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the\n principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions\n relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under \nArticle\n 226\n or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which\n we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following\n categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power\n could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any\n court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not\n be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and\n sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid\n formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases\n wherein such power should be exercised.\n\n (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or\n the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and\n accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence\n or make out a case against the accused.\n\n (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other\n materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a\n cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers\n under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a\n Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.\n\n 36\n\n (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or\n complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do\n not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case\n against the accused.\n\n (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a\n cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence,\n no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order\n of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the\n Code.\n\n (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so\n absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no\n prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is\n sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.\n (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the\n provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a\n criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and\n continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific\n provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious\n redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.\n (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala\n fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an\n ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a\n view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.\"\n\n36. An altogether a new aspect has been considered and\npropounded by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of \nPepsi Foods\nLtd. and another Vs. Special Judicial Magistrate and others\n reported\nin (1998) 5 SCC 749. The Apex Court, while dealing with the powers\nof the High Court in the matters of compounding the offences, has laid\ndown that the exercise of powers of judicial review conferred to the\nHigh Courts is not only to ensure administration of justice, but it is also\nof a judicial nature, which intends to prevent the abuse of the process by\nthe inferior courts and also to see that stream of justice remains clean\n\n 37\n\nand pure and attains the social objective. To attain the wider principle\nas considered by the Apex Court, it has been held that the powers of the\nHigh Court is not limited but only thing is that while exercising the\nsame, the Court has to be extremely cautious and due care has to be\ntaken and that is why it has been laid down that the powers under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. which has been given an overriding power to the\nprovision of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n would be an inflexible\npower and could be exercised depending upon the facts and\ncircumstances of each case.\n\n \nIn the aforesaid judgment, it has been observed that the guidelines\nin terms therein, where the Court while exercising the powers under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. is inflexible and not laying down the rigid formula\nto be followed while exercising its jurisdiction. Para 22, 26 and 28 of\nthe judgment of \nPepsi Foods Ltd.\n (Supra) read as under :-\n\n \"22. It is settled that the High Court can exercise its power\n of judicial review in criminal matters. \nIn \nState of Haryana v.\n Bhajan Lal\n this Court examined the extraordinary power under\n \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution and also the inherent powers under\n Section 482 of the Code which it said could be exercised by the\n High Court either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or\n otherwise to secure the ends of justice. While laying down certain\n guidelines where the court will exercise jurisdiction under these\n provisions, it was also stated that these guidelines could not be\n inflexible or laying rigid formulae to be followed by the courts.\n Exercise of such power would depend upon the facts and\n circumstances of each case but with the sole purpose to prevent\n abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends\n of justice. One of such guidelines is where the allegations made in\n the first information report or the complaint, even if they are\n taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not\n prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the\n accused. Under \nArticle 227\n the power of superintendence by the\n\n 38\n\nHigh Court is not only of administrative nature but is also of\njudicial nature. This article confers vast powers on the High Court\nto prevent the abuse of the process of law by the inferior courts\nand to see that the stream of administration of justice remains\nclean and pure. The power conferred on the High Court under\n\nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of the Constitution and under Section 482 of\nthe Code have no limits but more the power more due care and\ncaution is to be exercised while invoking these powers. When the\nexercise of powers could be under \nArticle 227\n or Section 482 of\nthe Code it may not always be necessary to invoke the provisions\nof \nArticle 226.\n Some of the decisions of this Court laying down\nprinciples for the exercise of powers by the High Court under\nArticles 226 and 227 may be referred to.\n\n 26. Nomenclature under which petition is filed is not quite\nrelevant and that does not debar the court from exercising its\njurisdiction which otherwise it possesses unless there is special\nprocedure prescribed which procedure is mandatory. If in a case\nlike the present one the court finds that the appellants could not\ninvoke its jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n, the court can certainly\ntreat the petition as one under \nArticle 227\n or Section 482 of the\nCode. It may not however, be lost sight of that provisions exist in\nthe Code of revision and appeal but some time for immediate\nrelief Section 482 of the Code or \nArticle 227\n may have to be\nresorted to for correcting some grave errors that might be\ncommitted by the subordinate courts. The present petition though\nfiled in the High Court as one under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n could\nwell be treated under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution.\n\n 28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a\nserious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a matter\nof course. It is not that the complainant has to bring only two\nwitnesses to support his allegations in the complaint to have the\n\n 39\n\n criminal law set into motion. The order of the Magistrate\n summoning the accused must reflect that he has applied his mind\n to the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto. He has to\n examine the nature of allegations made in the complaint and the\n evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof and would\n that be sufficient for the complainant to succeed in bringing\n charge home to the accused. It is not that the Magistrate is a silent\n spectator at the time of recording of preliminary evidence before\n summoning of the accused. The Magistrate has to carefully\n scrutinise the evidence brought on record and may even himself\n put questions to the complainant and his witnesses to elicit\n answers to find out the truthfulness of the allegations or otherwise\n and then examine if any offence is prima facie committed by all\n or any of the accused.\"\n\n37. \nIn the matter of \nMadhu Limaye Vs. State of\nMaharashtra\n reported in (1977) 4 SCC 551, the Court has laid down\nthat \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. would not create a bar for the exercise of\npowers by the High Courts for quashing of a proceedings, summoning\norder or the charge sheet without being affected by the powers under\n\nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. and it would exclusively be governed by the factors\ndepending upon the circumstances of each case.\n\n38. A harmonious interpretation can also be discerned from the\nratio laid down by the Apex Court in the judgment of B.S. Joshi and\nothers Vs. State of Haryana and another reported in (2003) 4 SCC\n\n675. Para 5, 6, 8 and 15 of \nthe said judgment\n reads as under\n\n \n\"5. After reproducing the seven categories of cases as\n given in para 102 of \nBhajan Lal\n case the High Court has held that\n the parameters, principles and guidelines for quashing of\n complaints, first information report and criminal proceedings\n have been settled in terms thereof and has concluded therefrom\n that the instant case does not fall in any of the said categories. It is\n\n 40\n\nquite clear that the High Court has lost sight of the earlier part of\npara 102 which made it abundantly clear that the said categories\nof cases were being given by way of illustration.\n \nNeither were the\ncategories of cases given exhaustive nor could it be so. Before\ngiving those categories, it was said in \nBhajan Lal\n case that: (SCC\np. 378, para 102)\n \"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various\n relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the\n principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of\n decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power\n under \nArticle 226\n or the inherent powers under Section 482 of\n the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we\n give the following categories of cases by way of illustration\n wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse\n of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of\n justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise,\n clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible\n guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of\n myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be\n exercised.\"\n\n 6. \nIn \nPepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate\n this\nCourt with reference to \nBhajan Lal\n case observed that the\nguidelines laid therein as to where the court will exercise\njurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code could not be inflexible\nor laying rigid formulae to be followed by the courts. Exercise of\nsuch power would depend upon the facts and circumstances of\neach case but with the sole purpose to prevent abuse of the\nprocess of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. It\nis well settled that these powers have no limits. Of course, where\nthere is more power, it becomes necessary to exercise utmost care\nand caution while invoking such powers.\n\n 41\n\n \n8. It is, thus, clear that \nMadhu Limaye\n case does not lay\n down any general proposition limiting power of quashing the\n criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint as vested in Section 482\n of the Code or extraordinary power under \nArticle 226\n of the\n Constitution of India. We are, therefore, of the view that if for the\n purpose of securing the ends of justice, quashing of FIR becomes\n necessary, Section 320 would not be a bar to the exercise of\n power of quashing. It is, however, a different matter depending\n upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether to exercise\n or not such a power.\n\n 15. In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High\n Court in exercise of its inherent powers can quash criminal\n proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section 320 of the Code\n does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the\n Code.\"\n\n \nHence, on considering the aforesaid prepositions, it can be safely\nconcluded that in view of the language used in the provisions contained\nunder \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., which confers the inherent power to the High\nCourts, cannot be limited by the provisions contained under \nSection 320\n\nCr.P.C. as they being the plenary power and independent to \nSection 320\n\nCr.P.C and will not be eclipsed by the restrictions of sub-Section (9) of\n\nSection 320\n of the Cr.P.C. Hence, the composition for the heinous\noffence and, in particularly, the case at hand in relation to the offence\nunder \nSection 307\n I.P.C., it would depend upon the factors as\ndetermined by para 29 of the \nNaarinder Singh\n (Supra) case.\n\n39. The Coordinate Bench of this Court had also in the case of\nCriminal Misc. \nApplication 1253 of 2012, Dilbagh Singh Vs. State of\nUttarakhand\n has also held that the offences under \nSections 147\n, \n148\n,\n\n149\n, \n323\n, \n324\n, \n325\n, \n427\n, \n452\n, \n504\n, \n506\n and \n307\n I.P.C. would be\ncompoundable.\n An identical view has been expressed by the Coordinate\nBench of Allahabad High Court in a judgment rendered in Application\nunder Section C482 No. 31751 of 2015, Rajendra Sharma and 18\n\n 42\n\nothers Vs. State of U.P. and another, wherein, the Court has held as\nunder :-\n\n \"A perusal of the aforesaid would indicate that this Court is\n competent to quash a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in\n exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, which is distinct and different\n from the power to compound an offence under Section 320 of the\n Code. The Apex Court went on to hold that the inherent powers\n are of wide amplitude with the no statutory limitations, but the\n same is to be exercised either to secure the ends of justice or to\n prevent the abuse of the process of any court. Thus where the\n offender and the victim have settled their dispute in respect of an\n offence, which is neither heinous and serious, nor involved any\n mental depravity relating to an offence like murder, rape, dacoity\n etc, such proceedings can be quashed on the basis of settlement,\n but the offence should be private in nature and should not have\n any societal impact, such as an offence under the \nPrevention of\n Corruption Act\n or an offence involving public servants in\n discharge of duties etc. But criminal cases having a\n predominantly civil flavour, such as commercial, financial\n mercantile civil partnership etc. or family disputes are such\n instances, where prosecution could be quashed subject to a\n settlement.\"\n\n40. Even recently, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nParbatbhai Aahir Alias Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and\nothers Vs. Sate of Gujrat and another reported in (2017) 9 SCC 641\nwas dealing with the powers of the Superior Courts under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C.. The said judgment too places reliance on the ratio as\npropounded in \nGian Singh\n (Supra).\n The judgment of Parbatbhai\nAahir (Supra) could widely be summarized as under :-\n\n (1) \nSection 482\n Cr.PC preserves the inherent powers of the High\n Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to\n secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new\n\n 43\n\n powers. It only recognizes and preserves powers which\n inhere in the High Court.\n\n(2) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a\n first information report or a criminal proceeding on the\n ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the\n offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of\n jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence.\n\n While compounding an offence, the power of the court is\n governed by the provisions of \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. The power\n to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is\n non-compoundable.\n\n(3) In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or\n complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction\n under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., the High Court must evaluate\n whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the\n inherent power.\n\n(4) While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit\n and plentitude, it has to be exercised to secure the ends of\n justice and to prevent an abuse of the process of any Court.\n(5) The decision as to whether a complaint or F.I.R. should be\n quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have\n settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts and\n circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of\n principles can be formulated.\n\n(6) In the exercise of power under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and while\n dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High\n Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the\n offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental\n depravity or fences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot\n be appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of\n the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are not\n private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The\n decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on\n\n 44\n\n the overriding element of public interest in punishing persons\n for serious offences.\n\n (7) Criminal cases involving offences which arise from\n commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar\n transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in\n appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have\n settled the dispute.\n\n (8) The High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view\n of the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a\n conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal\n proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice. Economic\n offences involving the financial and economic well-being of\n the State have implications which lie beyond the domain of a\n mere dispute between the private disputants. The High Court\n would be justified in declining to quash where the offender is\n involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud\n or misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of\n upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the\n balance.\n\n41. In view of discussions and reasons enumerated, the\nconclusion which could be safely deduced is that the powers under\n\nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. of compounding of offences within its ambit will\nhave to read distinct to the powers vested with superior Courts under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and Writ Courts under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of the\nConstitution of India and they cannot be limited and circumscribed, as\nthey carry a distinct and wide powers of exercising the inherent powers\nto eradicate the abuse of process of law. Thus, even heinous offences\nwhich are not compoundable under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C., which includes\noffences under \nSections 147\n, \n148\n and \n307\n I.P.C. and so forth can be\ncompounded but with the frame work of guidelines laid down by the\nHon'ble Apex Court and, in particular, testing each case based on its\nown factual merits. It could also be concluded by saying that concept of\n\n 45\n\ncompounding also achieves wider social objectives to bring peace\namongst people, increasing tranquility and saving the litigants from\nfacing long drawn judicial proceedings, which would otherwise on its\nconclusion will not have any legal conclusion.\n\n42. \nIn view of ratio as laid by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\ncatena of decisions cited hereinabove, Compounding Application No.\n10867 of 2018, filed by the parties will stand allowed and the entire\nproceedings of Criminal Case \nNo. 3577 of 2016 'State Vs. Pan Singh\nRana\n' arising out of Case Crime No. 111 of 2016 under \nSections 307\n\nand \n506\n of I.P.C. at Police Station Kotwali Raipur, District Dehradun,\nwhich is presently pending before the IInd Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nDehradun stands quashed.\n\n43. Consequently, this C-482 Application under \nSection 482\n of\nCr.P.C. would also stand allowed. There would be no order as to costs.\n\n (Sharad Kumar Sharma, J.)\n 28.09.2018\nShiv",

It was observed that in a criminal case, the veiled object\nbehind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on\nwhich the structure of the prosecution rests and the like would\njustify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in the interest\nof justice and that the ends of justice are higher than the ends of\nmere law though justice had got to be administered according to\nlaws made by the legislature. This Court said that the compelling\nnecessity for making these observations is that without a proper\nrealization of the object and purpose of the provision which seeks\nto save the inherent powers of the High Court to do justice\nbetween the State and its subjects, it would be impossible to\nappreciate the width and contours of that salient jurisdiction. On\nfacts, it was also noticed that there was no reasonable likelihood\nof the accused being convicted of the offence. What would\nhappen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the\nimputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier\nnoticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was registered\nat her instance due to temperamental differences and implied\nimputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the\nimputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved\ndisputes with her husband and his other family members and as a\nresult thereof she has again started living with her husband with\nwhom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted\ncompany and is living happily on her own or has married\nsomeone else on earlier marriage having been dissolved by\ndivorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on\nsome other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would\nalmost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to\ndecline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would\nbe permitting the parties to compound non-compoundable\noffences.

It is, however, a different matter depending\n upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether to exercise\n or not such a power."
