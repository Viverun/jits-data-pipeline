Narasingh\n\n IN THE HIGH COURT OF ORISSA AT CUTTACK\n\n BLAPL No.1164 of 2023\n\n Soumya Ranjan Mohanty .... Petitioner\n Mr. S. Satapathy, Advocate\n -versus-\n\n State of Odisha .... Opposite Party\n Mr. K.K. Gaya, ASC\n\n CORAM: JUSTICE V. NARASINGH\n\n ORDER\n\n 04.07.2023\nOrder No.\n\n 04. 1. Heard learned counsel for the Petitioner and learned\n counsel for the State.\n\n 2. The Petitioner is an accused in connection with 2 (a) C.C.\n Case No.06 of 2023, pending in the Court of the learned Sessions\n Judge-cum-Special Judge, Cuttack, arising out of P.R. No.429 of\n 2023, for alleged commission of offences under \nSection\n 20(b)(ii)(C)\n of NDPS Act.\n\n 3. Being aggrieved by the rejection of his application for bail\n U/s.439 \nCr.P.C\n. by the learned Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge,\n Cuttack, by order dated 24.01.2023 in the aforementioned case, the\n present BLAPL has been filed.\n\n 4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the\n Petitioner was released on interim bail by order dated 14.03.2023\n and on instruction, it is stated that after expiry of the interim bail\n period, the Petitioner has surrendered on 27.04.2023.\n\n 5. It is submitted by the learned counsel that the Petitioner\n along with three others were taken into custody on 17.01.2023 on\n\n Page 1 of 2\n\n the accusation of possessing contraband to the tune of 60Kgs\n(Ganja).\n\n6. It is stated with vehemence that independent seizures have\nbeen clubbed together so as to attract the rigors of \nSection 37\n of the\nNDPS Act.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the orders\npassed by this Court dated 21.06.2023 and 23.06.2023 in BLAPL\nNos.6242 & 3033 of 2023 respectively and seeks release inter alia\non the ground of parity.\n\n8. It is further submitted by the learned counsel that the since\nfinal form has already been submitted as evident from the order of\nrejection and as the Petitioner is the first offender, he may be\nreleased on bail.\n\n9. Per contra, learned counsel for the State opposes the prayer\nfor bail in view of the bar contained in \nSection 37\n of the NDPS Act\nand the seizure being a common one, the defence of the Petitioner\ndoes not stand to reason and hence the bail application does not\ndeserve consideration.\n\n10. Taking into account the release of the co-accused and\nbleak chance of early trial, this Court directs the Petitioner to be\nreleased on bail on such terms to be fixed by the learned Court in\nseisin.\n\n11. Before releasing the Petitioner on bail, learned Court in\nseisin is called upon to verify as to whether the Petitioner has\nsurrendered on 27.04.2023, as submitted and also the criminal\nantecedent of the Petitioner. If it comes to the fore that the\nsubmission regarding surrender of the Petitioner is not correct and\nhe has any criminal antecedent, this order shall stand recalled.\n\n12. Additionally, it is directed that the Petitioner shall appear\nbefore the jurisdictional police station once every week on such date\n\n Page 2 of 3\n\n and time to be fixed by the learned Court in seisin till conclusion of\n trial. Certification of such appearance shall be submitted to the Court\n in seisin.\n\n 13. The BLAPL thus stands disposed of.\n\n 14. Urgent certified copy of this order be granted as per rules.\n\n (V.
