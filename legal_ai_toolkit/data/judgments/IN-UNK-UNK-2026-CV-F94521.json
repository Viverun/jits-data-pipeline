AND JMFC, HOSANAGARA.\n\n THESE PETITIONS, COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,\nORDER WAS MADE THEREIN AS UNDER:\n\nCORAM: HON'BLE MR JUSTICE S VISHWAJITH SHETTY\n\n ORAL ORDER\n\n1. Accused nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.40/2024 registered by\n\nNagara Police Station, Shivamogga, for the offences punishable\n\nunder \nSections 323\n, \n498A\n, \n149\n IPC and \nSections 3\n & \n4\n of the\n\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961, are before this Court under\n\nSection 438\n of Cr.PC seeking anticipatory bail.\n\n2. Heard the learned Counsel for the parties.\n\n3. FIR in Crime No.40/2024 was registered by Nagara Police\n\nStation, Shivamogga, against the petitioners herein and\n\nanother for the aforesaid offences on the basis of the first\n\ninformation dated 26.07.2024 received from Akshata Kalahal\n\nwho is the wife of accused no.1. Apprehending arrest in the\n\n -5-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:37494\n\n CRL.P No. 9189/2024\n\n C/W CRL.P.Nos.9225/2024,\n\n 9231/2024\n\nsaid case, petitioners had filed applications before the\n\njurisdictional Sessions Court seeking anticipatory bail. The said\n\napplications were rejected by the Sessions Court, and\n\ntherefore, the petitioners are before this Court.\n\n4. Learned Counsel for the petitioners having reiterated the\n\ngrounds urged in the petition, submits that the relationship\n\nbetween accused no.1 and his wife is strained. The alleged\n\noffences are triable by the Court of Magistrate and the\n\nmaximum punishment for the same is imprisonment for a\n\nperiod of three years. Petitioner are ready and willing to\n\ncooperate with the police for the purpose of investigation.\n\nAccordingly, he prays to allow the petitions.\n\n5. Per contra, learned HCGP has opposed the petitions.\n\n6. Perusal of the material available on record would go to\n\nshow that the marriage of accused no.1 and the first informant\n\nwas solemnized on 27.01.2022. It is appears that subsequently\n\ntheir relationship got strained and the first informant was\n\nsuspecting that accused no.1 had illicit relationship with\n\naccused no.4. The first information is now filed alleging that\n\n -6-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:37494\n\n CRL.P No. 9189/2024\n\n C/W CRL.P.Nos.9225/2024,\n\n 9231/2024\n\naccused persons were ill-treating and torturing the first\n\ninformant in her matrimonial house and were also demanding\n\nadditional dowry from her. It is also alleged that accused no.1\n\nhas illicit relationship with accused no.4. Petitioners do not\n\nhave criminal antecedents. The alleged offences are triable by\n\nthe Court of Magistrate and the maximum punishment for the\n\nsaid offences is imprisonment for a period of three years.\n\nPetitioners have undertaken to cooperate with the police for the\n\npurpose of investigation. Under the circumstances, I am of the\n\nopinion that the petitioners prayer for grant of anticipatory bail\n\nis required to be answered affirmatively. Accordingly, the\n\nfollowing order:\n\n7. The petitions are allowed. The respondent - Police or any\n\nother police in the State of Karnataka are directed to release\n\nthe petitioners in the event of their arrest in Crime No.40/2024\n\nregistered by Nagara Police Station, Shivamogga, for the\n\noffences punishable under \nSections 323\n, \n498A\n, \n149\n IPC and\n\nSections 3\n & \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, subject to\n\nthe following conditions:\n\n -7-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:37494\n\n CRL.P No. 9189/2024\n\n C/W CRL.P.Nos.9225/2024,\n\n 9231/2024\n\n 1. The Petitioners shall appear before the\n Investigating Officer within 15 days from the date\n of receipt of the copy of this order and shall\n execute a personal bond for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-\n\n each with two sureties for the likesum to the\n satisfaction of the investigating officer.\n\n 2. Petitioners shall regularly appear before\n the Trial Court without fail unless exempted by the\n Trial Court for valid reasons.\n\n 3. Petitioners shall not tamper with the\n prosecution witness and they shall co-operate with\n the police for investigation and appear before them\n whenever called upon.\n\n 4. The petitioners shall not involve in similar\n offences in future.\n\n SD/-\n\n (S VISHWAJITH SHETTY)\n JUDGE\n\nKK",
