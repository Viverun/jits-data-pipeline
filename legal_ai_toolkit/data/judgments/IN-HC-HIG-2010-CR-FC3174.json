The appellants Girajo Devi, Ram Bahadur, Satender @ Satte and\n\nRamesh Chand have preferred this joint appeal against impugned\n\njudgment dated 17th October, 1995 in Sessions Case No. 109/90, FIR\n\nNo. 242/90, P.S. Malviya Nagar in terms of which the appellants have\n\nbeen convicted for the offences punishable under Section 498-A and\n\n304-B, both read with\nSection 34\nIPC as also against the consequent\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 1 of 20\n\norder on sentence dated 18th October, 1995 in terms of which all the\n\nappellants have been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\n\nlife and also to pay a fine of Rs. 2000/- each, in default of payment of\n\nwhich, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for further period of six\n\nmonths for the offences under\nSection 304-B\n/\nIPC and also to\n\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for the period of three years and to pay\n\nfine of Rs. 1000/- each, in default of payment of which, to undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for the period of three months respectively\n\nunder\nSection 498-A\n/\nIPC.\n\n2. During the pendency of appeal, the appellant Ram Bahadur\n\nexpired, as such, the appeal against him abated. The appellant\n\nSatender @ Satte absconded during the pendency of appeal and was\n\ndeclared proclaimed offender. The appellant Ramesh Chand is in\n\njudicial custody and the appellant Girajo Devi is on bail.\n\n3. Briefly stated, case of the prosecution is that Ms. Manju\n\n(hereinafter referred to as „deceased‟) was married to the appellant\n\nRam Bahadur (since expired) on 15th February, 1989. On 12th June,\n\n1990, her dead body was found in burnt condition in the latrine of her\n\nmatrimonial home i.e. House No. 87/4, Sector 1, Pushp Vihar, New\n\nDelhi. Someone conveyed this information on 12th June, 1990 at 1:50\n\npm, which information was conveyed by PCR to the Police Post, Pushp\n\nVihar, New Delhi. The information was recorded in the daily diary\n\nmaintained in the Police Post, Pushp Vihar as Entry No. 12 and a copy\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 2 of 20\n\nthereof was sent to the Police Station Malviya Nagar. On receipt of the\n\ncopy of DD No. 12, SI Murari Lal proceeded to the place of occurrence\n\nwhere he found the dead body of the deceased lying in the toilet of\n\nHouse No. 87/4, Sector 1, Pushp Vihar, New Delhi. The parents of the\n\ndeceased were also present there. Sh. B. K. Sehgal, PW18, the then\n\nSDM, South Delhi also reached at the spot and recorded the statement\n\nEx.PW11/A of Kanti Devi, mother of the deceased (PW11).\n\n4. Kanti Devi, in her statement to the SDM narrated that the\n\ndeceased was married to Ram Bahadur on 15th February, 1989.\n\nEverything was fine with marriage for about four months, thereafter, in-\n\nlaws of the deceased started harassing her. She was not even\n\nprovided with proper food and was not permitted to cook food as her\n\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law did not find the taste of food cooked by\n\nher to their liking. Kanti Devi also stated that her daughter told her\n\nthat her mother-in-law was demanding a colour T.V., her husband had\n\nraised a demand for Scooter, her father-in-law had demanded a plot\n\nand her brother-in-law Satte asked her to vacate her house of Pushp\n\nVihar and shift to her parents‟ house and take a room there. Her son-\n\nin-law Ram Bahadur (since expired) was getting a meagre salary of\n\nRs.1200/- per month and because of that reason, they got the\n\ndeceased admitted in a training course for Laboratory Assistant run by\n\nSafdarjang Hospital. On 11th June, 1990, the deceased came to their\n\nhome with her brother Anupam and she told that her mother-in-law\n\nand brother-in-law had hit her with a bucket and a „bhagona‟, resulting\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 3 of 20\n\nin an injury on her leg. After staying at the parental house for some\n\ntime, the deceased insisted on going back to her matrimonial home\n\nand her father Mool Chand (PW6) dropped her there. She further\n\nstated that on the next day, they got a message through two boys that\n\nManju was unwell and they should reach at her matrimonial house\n\nimmediately. When they reached there, they found that Manju had\n\ndied due to fire burns. She also stated before the SDM that since her\n\nmarriage, Manju was being treated badly by the appellants who used\n\nto beat her time and again. On the basis of said statement, a case\n\nunder\nSection 498-A\nIPC and\nSection 304-B\nIPC was registered at P.S.\n\nMalviya Nagar on the directions of the SDM.\n\n5. The Investigating Officer Murari Lal prepared a rough site plan of\n\nthe place of occurrence. He also got the scene of occurrence\n\nphotographed. The SDM also recorded the statement of the father of\n\nthe deceased as well as the appellants. On inspection, a plastic can\n\ncontaining kerosene oil and a half burnt matchbox was found at the\n\nspot, which were seized by the Investigating Officer. After completion\n\nof the inquest proceedings, the dead body was sent to AIIMS for post-\n\nmortem examination. The appellants were arrested at the spot. On\n\ncompletion of the formalities of investigation, all the four appellants\n\nwere charge-sheeted and sent for trial.\n\n6. The appellants were charged for offences punishable under\n\nSection 498-A\n,\n304-B\nand\nIPC all read with\nSection 34\nIPC and an\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 4 of 20\n\nadditional charge for the offence under\nSection 342\nIPC was also\n\nframed against the appellant Girajo Devi. The appellants pleaded\n\ninnocence and claimed to be tried.\n\n7. In order to bring home the guilt of the appellants, prosecution\n\nexamined 27 witnesses in all. On conclusion of the prosecution\n\nevidence, the appellants were examined under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. with\n\na view to afford them an opportunity to explain the incriminating\n\ncircumstances appearing against them. The appellants denied the\n\nprosecution case in their respective statements. Appellants Girajo\n\nDevi, Satender and Ramesh Chand took the plea that their‟s is a middle\n\nclass joint family with meagre means. The deceased was an ambitious\n\nlady and wanted to lead a comfortable luxurious life, which was beyond\n\ntheir means and perhaps because of that reason, she became\n\nfrustrated and lost interest in life and had committed suicide. No\n\nwitness in defence has been examined.\n\n8. The learned Trial Court did not find any merit in the defence set\n\nup by the appellants and relying upon the prosecution evidence found\n\nthe appellants guilty of offences punishable under\nSection 304B\nIPC\n\nand\nSection 498A\nIPC both read with\nSection 34\nIPC and convicted\n\nthem accordingly. As regards the other charges, appellants were\n\nacquitted.\n\n9.\nSection 304B\nIPC is an extraordinary provision which was\n\nintroduced into the\nIndian Penal Code\nby the Dowry Prohibition\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 5 of 20\n\n(Amendment) Act 1986 with a view to combat the menace of dowry\n\ndeath. It defines a new concept called dowry death and raises a\n\npresumption of culpability against the husband or his relatives if the\n\ndeath of the deceased lady falls within the four corners of the definition\n\nof dowry death. It provides that where the death of a married woman\n\nis caused by any burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under normal\n\ncircumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that\n\nsoon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by\n\nher husband or any relative of her husband for or in connection with\n\nthe demand for dowry, such death shall be called dowry death. The\n\nSecond part of\nSection 304B(1)\nIPC provides that once it is established\n\nthat the woman has died a dowry death, such husband or relative of\n\nthe husband of the deceased who are seen to have indulged in\n\nsubjecting the deceased to harassment or cruelty for or in connection\n\nwith dowry shall be deemed to have caused the death. Thus, in order\n\nto establish the guilt of an accused for an offence under\nSection 304B\n\nIPC, the prosecution is required to establish following ingredients for a\n\ndowry death:\n\n(i) There was a married lady,\n\n(ii) Her death occurred due to burns or bodily injury or it\n\nwas an unnatural death,\n\n(iii) That such death has occurred within seven years of\n\nthe marriage,\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 6 of 20\n\n(iv) That soon before her death, the deceased was\n\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or\n\nany of his relative.\n\n(v) And if such ingredients are established, then as per\n\nthe second limb of\nSection 304B(i)\nIPC, the husband\n\nor such relative of her husband shall be deemed to be\n\nguilty of causing dowry death.\n\n10. Thus, it is obvious that before raising the presumption of guilt\n\nagainst the accused, the prosecution is required to establish the above\n\nenumerated ingredients.\n\n11. In order to succeed on the charge under\nSection 498A\nIPC, the\n\nprosecution is required to establish following essential ingredients:\n\n(a) That the victim was a married lady,\n\n(b) That she was subjected to cruelty by her husband\n\nor the relatives of her husband,\n\n(c) That such cruelty consisted of either harassment of\n\nthe woman with a view to coerce a meeting of\n\ndemand for dowry or a wilful conduct of the\n\nhusband or the relative of the husband of such a\n\nnature as is likely to lead the lady to commit\n\nsuicide or cause grave injury to her life limb or\n\ndeath.\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 7 of 20\n\n12. In the light of aforesaid provisions of law, we now proceed to\n\nconsider the submissions on behalf of the parties.\n\n13. Learned counsel for the appellants, while assailing the impugned\n\njudgment, fairly conceded that the deceased was married to the\n\nappellant Ram Bahadur and she died of an unnatural death by burning\n\nwithin seven years of her marriage. He also stated that the appellants\n\nGirajo Devi, Ramesh Chand and Satender are the parents and the\n\nbrother of the appellant Ram Bahadur. Learned counsel submitted that\n\nthe above fact by itself does not establish the guilt of the appellants.\n\nIn order to succeed on the charge under\nSection 304B\nIPC and\nSection\n\n498A\nIPC, the prosecution was required to establish beyond doubt that\n\nthe appellants demanded dowry from the deceased or from her family\n\nmembers and had subjected the deceased to harassment and cruel\n\ntreatment with a view to coerce her and her relatives to concede to\n\ntheir dowry demands. Learned counsel submitted that the learned\n\nTrial Court has failed to appreciate that the prosecution has miserably\n\nfailed on both the counts, i.e., the demand for dowry and the\n\nharassment or cruel treatment meted out by the appellants to the\n\ndeceased.\n\n14. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that in order to\n\nprove the demand of dowry harassment as well as the cruel treatment\n\nmeted out to the deceased for or in connection with the dowry\n\ndemand, the prosecution examined 10 witnesses who can be divided\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 8 of 20\n\ninto two categories i.e. neighbours residing in the vicinity of\n\nmatrimonial home of the deceased and others. So far as the\n\nneighbours i.e. PW1-A Ms. Bindu Kharbanda, PW2 Ms. Kamlesh\n\nAggarwal and PW19 Ms. Amrawati are concerned, they have not\n\nsupported the case of the prosecution. Though they were cross-\n\nexamined at length by learned APP after seeking permission from the\n\ncourt but nothing incriminating could be elicited from their cross-\n\nexamination. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the\n\nother witnesses are the relatives and the friends of the family of the\n\ndeceased who are interested in the success of the case and their\n\ntestimony is not reliable. In support of this contention, learned counsel\n\nhas made detailed submissions, which are not reproduced for the sake\n\nof brevity and we propose to deal with the said submissions later.\n\n15. Learned counsel for the State, on the other hand, has argued that\n\nfrom the testimony of PW1 Ganga Devi, PW3 Ajit Singh Saini, PW4\n\nKanwar Singh, PW6 Mool Chand, PW7 Alka, PW11 Kanti Devi and PW20\n\nSurender Sharma, it stands established on the record that the\n\nappellants, within a few months of the marriage had started\n\ndemanding for dowry and with a view to coerce the deceased and her\n\nparents to meet their demands, they subjected the deceased to\n\nharassment and cruelty, which ultimately resulted in the death of the\n\ndeceased by burning within a period of slightly more than a year of her\n\nmarriage. Thus, he submitted that the learned Trial Judge has rightly\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 9 of 20\n\nconvicted the appellant on two counts i.e. under\nSection 498A\nread\n\nwith\nSection 34\nIPC and\nSection 304B\nread with\nSection 34\nIPC.\n\n16. We have considered the rival contentions and perused the\n\nmaterial on record.\n\n17. PW6 Mool Chand Saini, father of the deceased is one of the main\n\nwitnesses of the prosecution. Learned counsel for the appellant\n\nsubmitted that though in his examination-in-chief, he has supported\n\nthe case of the prosecution, his version is not worthy of credence as he\n\nhas made material improvements over his previous statement\n\nEx.PW6/DB recorded by the SDM on the date of death of the deceased.\n\nIn support of this contention, learned counsel for the appellant has\n\ndrawn our attention to the relevant part of the cross-examination of\n\nPW6 Mool Chand, which is, inter alia, reproduced as under:\n\n\"........In my statement made to the SDM I did not state that accused Ram\nBahadur used to demand scooter. In my statement before the SDM I did\nnot talk about any demand of dowry particularly. I had stated about the\ndemand of plot which I consider to be demand of dowry.\n\nI had told the SDM that after Satte came back home, he and his mother\nGirajo Devi started harassing my daughter. I had told the SDM that\naccused persons used to harass my daughter for not bringing sufficient\ndowry. (Confronted with Ex.PW6/DB where this fact is not specifically\nmentioned.). I did not tell the SDM that in June, 1989 Smt. Girajo Devi\naccused had demanded a coloured T.V. from me. I did not tell the SDM\nthat father-in-law of my daughter Manju asked in Sept. 1989 for a plot. I\nalso did not tell the SDM that in October, 1989 Ram Bahadur accused\nmade a demand for a scooter, which took I declined. I also did not tell the\nSDM that during all this period they continued to maltreat my daughter. I\nalso did not tell the SDM that in Jan. 1990 Manju's Devar Satte asked me\nto spare on a separate room in my house for Manju and her husband or\nthat this demand was made by him after consultation and after the advice\nof his parents. I also did not tell the SDM that for this reason the\nharassment of my daughter grew day by day. I had not stated in my\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 10 of 20\n\nstatement before the SDM that I implored them not to harass my daughter\nbut no avail.\n\nI had not stated before the SDM that in March, 1990 I got her admitted in\nS.J.Hospital for training course of Lab. Asstt. despite that her harassment\ncontinued, I also had not stated before the SDM that however, I did not\nthink it proper to lodge the report with the police because the things may\nhave flared up. I had also not stated before the SDM in my statement that\nin May 1990 they again raised the same demands but I flatly declined\nbecause I had no source to meet their demand.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid improvements made by the witness over his\n\nprevious statement on material aspects of the case, we do not find it\n\nsafe to place any reliance upon the testimony of PW6 Mool Chand.\n\n18. The other important witness examined by the prosecution is the\n\nmother of the deceased Ms. Kanti Devi (PW11). As regards demand for\n\ndowry, she has stated that the brother-in-law of the deceased used to\n\ndemand colour T.V., father-in-law used to demand a plot and husband\n\nused to demand scooter, besides that, the brother-in-law Satte told the\n\ndeceased to persuade her father to spare one room in his residence for\n\nthe deceased and her husband. In the cross-examination, the witness\n\nchanged her stand and stated that it was not the brother-in-law who\n\ndemanded colour T.V. but the demand for colour T.V. was made by\n\nmother-in-law. The above referred version of PW11 Kanti Devi gives an\n\nimpression of an effort to rope in all the members of the family of the\n\nhusband of the deceased. Otherwise also, her version regarding\n\ndemand for dowry is vague and it is bereft of specific instances giving\n\napproximate dates and place where the demand was made. Further,\n\nhad such demand actually been made by the in-laws of the deceased,\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 11 of 20\n\nPW11 Kanti Devi, as also the deceased, under the natural course of\n\ncircumstances, were expected to discuss such demands with the father\n\nof the deceased namely PW6 Mool Chand Saini and he would have\n\ncome to know about it. The fact that PW6 Mool Chand Saini in his\n\nstatement before the SDM has not said anything regarding dowry\n\ndemand raises a strong doubt that PW11 Kanti Devi is not speaking the\n\ntruth and she is not a reliable witness.\n\n19. PW1 Ganga Devi, who claimed to be a friend of the deceased, is\n\nanother star witness of the prosecution. She has stated that the\n\ndeceased had joined the training programme for Laboratory Assistant\n\nin Safdarjung Hospital, sometime in April, 1990. She always appeared\n\ngloomy and sad and when asked as to why she was always sad, the\n\ndeceased told her that her mother-in-law and brother-in-law did not\n\nallow her to prepare the meals and they always quarrelled with her.\n\nShe also told her that her mother-in-law demanded a scooter, brother-\n\nin-law demanded a T.V., father-in-law demanded a plot and the\n\nhusband demanded a room in her parents‟ house which was lying\n\nvacant. She also deposed that on 10th June, 1990 at about 11:30 am,\n\nshe visited the house of the deceased to ask for repayment of money\n\nowed by her. When she reached near the entrance door of the house,\n\nshe heard noise of cries and utensils. In response to the door bell,\n\nmother-in-law of the deceased opened the door and asked her about\n\nthe reason for her visit. When she told her that she had come to meet\n\nthe deceased, the mother-in-law, who was seemingly angry, pointed\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 12 of 20\n\ntowards the deceased who was weeping. She stated that at that time,\n\nshe saw an injury on the leg of the deceased. When she asked the\n\ndeceased as to how she had sustained the injury, she (deceased) told\n\nher that her in-laws, in connection with their demands, had beaten her\n\nand that her mother-in-law and brother-in-law had hit her with a \"steel\n\nbucket\" and „bhagona‟ and that her father-in-law abused her and\n\nhusband slapped her. On careful scrutiny of her evidence, we do not\n\nfind her testimony worthy of credence because her testimony also\n\ngives an impression that she is trying to rope in all the family members\n\nof the husband of the deceased. Further it does not appear natural\n\nthat this witness, having known about the tense relationship between\n\nthe deceased and her in-laws, would have gone to the house of the\n\ndeceased on a Sunday to ask for return of so-called money owed to her\n\nparticularly when the next day was a working day and the deceased\n\nwould have met the witness in the Hospital on 11.06.90. We may also\n\nnote that PW6 Mool Chand has admitted in his cross-examination\n\nrecorded on 27.01.93 that he was an active member of the Employees\n\nUnion of Safdarjung Hospital and he had held various offices in the\n\nexecutive of the union from time to time. Therefore, a possibility\n\ncannot be ruled out that the father of the deceased, using his position\n\nas holder of an office in the executive committee of union might have\n\ninfluenced PW1 Ganga Devi to be a witness against the appellant. This\n\nsuspicion gets compounded by the fact that the statement of Ganga\n\nDevi, PW1 was recorded under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. after a long delay of\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 13 of 20\n\naround 22 days from the date of the incident on 04.07.1990 for which\n\ndelay no reasonable explanation is forthcoming from the Investigating\n\nOfficer. Thus, we do not find the testimony of PW1 Ganga Devi\n\nreliable.\n\n20. As regards, PW3 Ajit Singh Saini and PW4 Kanwar Singh, maternal\n\nuncle of the deceased, they claimed to have gone to the house of the\n\ndeceased on 11.06.1990 to talk with the in-laws of the deceased. Both\n\nof them have stated that during their talks with the father-in-law of the\n\ndeceased, he told them that he had asked the father of the deceased\n\nto arrange for a plot which has not been arranged till then. They also\n\nstated that mother-in-law of the deceased demanded a colour T.V.,\n\nhusband of the deceased demanded a scooter and brother-in-law of\n\nthe deceased said that if the parents of the deceased were unable to\n\nmeet their demands, they should provide for a side room in their house\n\nfor the deceased and her husband. The aforesaid version of the\n\nwitnesses is also a parrot like repetition of the version of PW1 Ganga\n\nDevi as also PW11 Kanti Devi, mother of the deceased, which appears\n\nto be unnatural. It is unlikely that one day before the occurrence, the\n\nin-laws of the deceased might have raised such demand in presence of\n\nthe witnesses. Further, testimony of these two witnesses is not reliable\n\nbecause of the fact that they admit that they had visited the maternal\n\nhouse of the deceased after her death on 12.06.1990. They have also\n\nadmitted that police as well as the SDM were also present at the spot,\n\nbut neither the police nor the SDM recorded their statements nor they\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 14 of 20\n\noffered to give their statements to them. Their statements under\n\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. had also been recorded after about 22 days on\n\n04.07.1990. There is no cogent explanation on the record as to why\n\ntheir statements were not recorded at an earlier date despite of the\n\nfact that they were available to the police during the intervening\n\nperiod. Therefore, a possibility cannot be ruled out that they have\n\nbeen introduced as witnesses after due deliberations, so we do not find\n\nit safe to rely upon their testimony. We may add that PW4 Kanwar\n\nSingh is the maternal uncle of the deceased, therefore, under the\n\nnatural course of circumstances, had his version been true, he would\n\ndefinitely have stated those facts to the SDM as well as the\n\nInvestigating Officer during the inquest proceedings conducted by the\n\nSDM on 12.06.90.\n\n21. We may note that prosecution has relied upon some purported\n\nhand-written letters/notes of the deceased namely Exhibits PW6/A,\n\nPW6/B, PW6/C and PW6/D. Ex. PW6/A is dated 09.06.1990 wherein it is\n\nrecorded by the deceased that in her absence, her parents-in-law and\n\nbrother-in-law had placed the sofa set etc. in her room. This writing of\n\nthe deceased gives an impression that there was some discord\n\nbetween the deceased and her in-laws and for that reason, her\n\nparents-in-law and brother-in-law had removed her sofa set etc. from\n\nthe drawing room/sitting room and placed the same in the room\n\nallotted to her. This document, by no means, suggests that there was\n\nany demand for dowry. Ex.PW6/B is an innocuous document, i.e., an\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 15 of 20\n\napplication for leave for 23.04.1990 and 24.04.1990. Ex.PW6/C is a\n\nsort of diary note written by the deceased on 11.05.89, which is vague\n\nand it records \"Manju ko hanse hue bhi pata nahi kitne saal ho gaye\n\nhain. Ab toh wo bechari hansna, bolna bilkul hee bhool gayi hai. Ab\n\ntoh sir ek yaad hai toh .......(paper torn) ya fir bahut adhik udaas sa\n\nman lekar akele ghanton baithkar sochte rahna. Ab zindagi mein baaki\n\nkuch bhi nahi bacha hai. Aur kahin is ladki ko kuch ho gaya toh iske\n\nmaa baap thatha rishtedar in logon ko kahin ka bhi nahi chodhenge.\n\nYe sab kuch bhool chuke hain. Sochte hain iska toh koi aage peeche\n\nhai nahi. Bechari saara din tanao se grast rahti hai. Raat ko niyam ke\n\nanusar Ram ka peekar aana, weh toh kisi ke saamne kuch keh bhi nahi\n\nsakti hai. Isme iske maa baap ka koi dosh nahi, saara dosh ya toh\n\nManju ka hai ya phir uski kismat ka kyonki shaadi ke liye haan toh\n\nkewal Manju ne hee ki thee. Mr. Ram, main toh abhi ghar se jaa rahin\n\nhoon. Aur haan, aapke 150 Rs. Diary ke andar rakhe hue hain. Le\n\nlena\". At the bottom of this writing, she had further written (Ex.PW6/D)\n\nthat she was taking away the torn agreement with her and they would\n\nmeet in the High Court. This document gives an impression that there\n\nwas some dispute between the deceased Manju and her husband for\n\nwhich, perhaps they had arrived at some agreement, which was later\n\non torn and the deceased left in May, 1990 threatening legal\n\nproceedings in the High Court. Parents of the deceased in their\n\ntestimony have not thrown any light about said torn agreement or\n\nwhat happened in May 1990. This writing Ex.PW6/D leads us nowhere.\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 16 of 20\n\nOn perusal of Ex.PW6/D, it transpires that it is the product of a\n\ndisturbed mind and it gives an impression that the deceased was under\n\nsome stress and tension. However, said reason has not been spelled\n\nout in the note. There was not even a whisper of any dowry demand.\n\nIf there actually was dowry demand, in the ordinary course of nature, in\n\nall probabilities the deceased was expected to write about it in her\n\nwritten note Ex.PW6/D, which is not the case. This circumstance also\n\nmakes the prosecution story about the dowry demand suspect.\n\n22. Coming to the issue regarding the cruel treatment meted out to\n\nthe deceased; in this regard, the material witnesses examined by the\n\nprosecution are PW1 Ganga Devi, who stated that she visited the house\n\nof the deceased on 10.06.1990. She found her weeping and crying and\n\nshe noticed that there was injury on her leg and when she asked for\n\nthe cause, the deceased told that she was beaten by her mother-in-law\n\nand brother-in-law and hit by them with a steel bucket and a\n\n„bhagona‟. PW6 Mool Chand Saini and PW11 Kanti Devi, parents of the\n\ndeceased have deposed that in the afternoon of 11.06.1990, the\n\ndeceased was brought to their home by her brother and they noticed a\n\nbandage on her right leg. If the aforesaid version of the witnesses is to\n\nbe believed, then the deceased had suffered an injury on her leg for\n\nwhich she also got treatment, presumably in Safdarjung Hospital or by\n\nsome other doctor. No doctor has been examined to substantiate this\n\nallegation. The aforesaid version of the witnesses is belied by the\n\nmedical evidence. PW5 Dr. D.N.Bhardwaj, who conducted the post-\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 17 of 20\n\nmortem on the dead body of the deceased, has categorically stated\n\nthat there was no evidence of mechanical injury on the person of the\n\ndeceased. This fact also finds mention in the post-mortem report\n\nEx.PW5/A. Thus, in view of the contradiction between the above-\n\nreferred oral testimony of witnesses and the medical evidence, we do\n\nnot find it safe to rely upon the testimony of above three witnesses.\n\n23. We may note that if the version of PW6 Mool Chand Saini and\n\nPW11 Kanti Devi is to be believed, then, they sent back their daughter\n\nto her matrimonial home to suffer the ire of her in-laws despite of\n\nhaving come to know that she was being ill-treated there and she had\n\nbeen hit with a steel bucket and a „bhagona‟ resulting in an injury on\n\nher leg. This conduct on the part of the parents of the deceased\n\nappears to be highly unnatural. It is highly improbable that PW6 Mool\n\nChand, father of the deceased, after having come to know about the\n\ninjuries sustained by the deceased at the hands of her in-laws would\n\nhave dropped the deceased outside her matrimonial home without\n\neven making an effort to talk to the husband and in-laws of the\n\ndeceased to clarify the situation. Thus, the above referred story of\n\ninjury caused to the deceased by her mother-in-law and brother-in-law\n\nin presence of the other two appellants is highly doubtful. It appears\n\nthat aforesaid story has been concocted with a view to meet the\n\nrequirement of\nSection 304B\nIPC that soon before her death, the\n\ndeceased was subjected to harassment or cruelty by her in-laws in\n\nrelation to their demand for dowry.\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 18 of 20\n\n24. The doubt against the prosecution story is further compounded\n\nby the fact that PW7 Kumari Alka has testified that a day before the\n\noccurrence i.e. on 11.06.1990 at about 11:00 a.m., appellant Ram\n\nBahadur visited her office and threatened that in case her parents\n\nfailed to consider their demands, they will face the dire consequences.\n\nIf this version is to be believed, then PW7 Kumari Alka was expected to\n\nconvey this information to her parents and it would have been\n\nreflected in their initial versions Ex.PW6/DB and Ex.PW11/A given to\n\nthe SDM on 12.06.1990, which is not the case. Further, if the appellant\n\nRam Bahadur had actually threatened Kumari Alka and asked her to\n\nsend her father to their house for settlement, under the natural course\n\nof circumstances, the appellants were expected to wait for the meeting\n\nwith PW6 Mool Chand, which also is not the case. Therefore also, it\n\nappears that PW7 Kumari Alka has been introduced as a witness with a\n\nview to give strength to the prosecution case against the appellants.\n\n25. In view of the evidence discussed above, we find that the\n\nprosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the basic\n\ningredients of the offence under\nSection 304B\nIPC as also under\n\nSection 498A\nIPC, i.e., the appellants had demanded dowry from the\n\ndeceased or her relatives or they subjected the deceased to cruelty for\n\nor in relation of their dowry demand or that they subjected the\n\ndeceased to such a treatment, which falls within the meaning of cruelty\n\nas defined in the Explanation given in\nSection 498A\nIPC. A possibility\n\ncannot be ruled out that since the deceased has died unnatural death\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 19 of 20\n\nin her matrimonial home, the parents of the deceased held the\n\nappellants responsible for her death and, therefore, they went to the\n\nextent of accusing them of demand of dowry and subjecting the\n\ndeceased to harassment and cruelty. Thus, we are unable to sustain\n\nthe impugned judgment and the consequent order on sentence. We\n\naccordingly accept the appeal and acquit the appellants, giving them\n\nbenefit of doubt.\n\n26. The appellant Ramesh Chand is in jail. He be released forthwith,\n\nif not required in any other case. Bail-cum-surety bonds of other\n\nappellants are discharged.\n\n27. Appeal is accordingly disposed of.\n\nAJIT BHARIHOKE, J.\n\nMARCH 26, 2010 SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.\nakb/pst\n\nCrl.A.No.242/1995 Page 20 of 20",
