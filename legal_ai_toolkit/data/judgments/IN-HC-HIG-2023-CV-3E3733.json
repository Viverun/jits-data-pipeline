By way of present petition filed under\nSection 482\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1973 ('\nCr.P.C\n'), quashing of FIR bearing no.\n519/2012, registered at Police Station Uttam Nagar, for the offences\npunishable under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n('\nIPC\n') has been sought qua the present petitioners.\n\nI. HISTORY AND FACTS OF THE CASE\n\n2. Brief facts of the present case are that the marriage between the\ncomplainant i.e. respondent no. 2 and co-accused Lalit was solemnized\non 23.01.2011. It is stated that there was irretrievable breakdown of the\nmarriage due to incompatible behaviour, conduct and temperament of\nthe parties. Thereafter, on the complaint of respondent no. 2 alleging\nphysical and mental cruelty for demand of dowry and beating by her\nhusband and in-laws, the present FIR was registered against the husband\nas well as the petitioners i.e. brother of husband's father, his son, and\nelder brother of husband.\n\n3. The matter was referred to mediation centre at the time of hearing\nof anticipatory bail application of the accused husband. Fortunately, the\nmatter was amicably settled before the mediation centre and all the\ndisputes were resolved between the parties which were reduced to\nwriting by way of a mediated settlement agreement dated 30.07.2014.\n\n4. The story of the dispute culminating into an agreement to settle all\ndisputes past, present and future, thus, had a happy ending for both the\nparties as the agreement was to the contentment of both the parties.\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 2 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nHowever, there was a twist in the story as now the police filed a\nchargesheet against all the accused persons and the police duly informed\nthe learned Magistrate about the settlement arrived at between the\nparties and the quashment clause in the agreement. In the meantime, the\npetition to quash FIR was filed by the husband as only he had been\nsummoned by the learned Magistrate and the FIR was quashed against\nthe husband before summons could reach him. Thus, even husband or\nhis relatives did not know that chargesheet had been filed by police, as\nthe summons were to reach the husband before 25.08.2015. The twists in\nthe story did not end here as now the other relatives of the husband i.e.\npetitioners were summoned by the learned Magistrate. By the time the\npresent petitioners realised that they too needed to get the FIR quashed\nagainst them, another twist awaited them after eight years which was\nunforeseen that by this time, the other key player of the story i.e the\ncomplainant conveniently changed her mind and appeared before this\nCourt only to inform that she had not entered into agreement with them\nbut only with her husband and therefore, FIR cannot be quashed, even\nafter receiving the entire amount of settlement including the amount for\nquashing of FIR.\n\n5. This Court, therefore, had a situation at hand where the petitioners\nherein had a bumpy ride so far as the present litigation is concerned.\nThey were lucky that the matter was amicably settled even before the\nchargesheet could be filed before the learned Magistrate, however, they\nwere unlucky that the settlement agreement did not mention their names.\nThey were blissfully unaware of the fact that they were also accused in\nthis case. They were lucky that the chargesheet was filed without\narresting them but they were unlucky that the Magistrate was\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 3 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nconstrained to summon them after taking cognizance against them, since\nthe FIR in question was not quashed qua them. In other words, they\nthought that they were fortunate that the FIR had been quashed, but\nunfortunately, the entire amount was paid to the complainant for\nquashing of the FIR without their names being included in the quashing\npetition. And even now, their misfortune, as far as the present litigation\nis concerned, has not come to an end as the complainant now refuses to\ngive her statement for quashing of the FIR.\n\nII. CONTENTIONS OF THE COUNSELS\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioners states that complainant/\nrespondent no. 2 has no grievance against the accused persons and she is\nnot willing to support the imputations made in FIR because the dispute\nin question has already been settled/compromised between the parties in\nterms of Mediated Settlement Agreement dated 30.07.2014 arrived at\nbefore Mediation Centre, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi. It is further stated that\nthe present petitioners could not file a petition for quashing of FIR since\nthe investigating officer did not give any notice under\nSection 160\n\nCr.P.C to the petitioners on the day of registration of FIR. It is further\nstated that inadvertently, the earlier petition for quashing of FIR i.e.\nCRL.M.C. 3069/2015 was filed only by the husband and could not be\nfiled by present petitioners, however the settlement agreement explicitly\nmentions that FIR shall be quashed qua all accused persons. Hence, it is\nstated that FIR be quashed.\n\n7. Per contra, learned counsel for complainant/respondent no. 2\nargues that the Mediated Settlement Agreement dated 30.07.2014 was\nonly qua husband of the complainant and FIR in respect of the husband\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 4 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nalready stands quashed. It is further stated that only the husband had\nsigned the settlement agreement and not the present petitioners. It is,\nhowever, admitted by learned counsel for respondent no. 2 that FIR qua\nhusband stands quashed vide order dated 31.07.2015 and that respondent\nno. 2 has already received payment of Rs.2,75,000/- towards full and\nfinal settlement of her claims including dowry articles, stridhan,\nalimony, maintenance of past, present and future, as well as all other\nclaims and rights as per the terms of Settlement Agreement. The\ncomplainant after issuance of Court notice appeared before the Court\nand submitted that she has settled the case only with her husband,\nthough she admits that she has received the entire settlement amount,\nincluding Rs.65,000/- received for quashing of FIR on 31.07.2015 as per\nsettlement agreement. She states that matter may again be sent for\nmediation qua the present accused(s) and she will settle the matter again\nwith them, as the money in this case was given by her husband and she\nhad, thus, settled it with him only.\n\n8. This Court has heard the rival contentions raised on behalf of both\nthe parties and has perused the material on record.\n\nIII. MEDIATED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN QUESTION\n\n9. For proper adjudication of the present case, it shall be imperative\nto reproduce the Mediated Settlement Agreement dated 30.07.2014 for\nreference, which reads as under:\n\n\"30.07.2014\nPresent: Ms. Neeru, complainant alongwith Sh.

It has also been agreed between the parties that a petition shall\nbe filed under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. by the respondents for\nquashing of FIR bearing No 519/12 under\nSection 498-A\n/\n/\nIPC with PS Uttam Nagar and the complainant shall cooperate\nwith the respondents and also shall file her affidavit for the\nquashing of the FIR.

That the fourth and last installment of Rs.65,000/- (Rupees\nSixty Five Thousand only) shall be paid by the respondent no. l to\nthe complainant at the time of disposal of the petition under\n\nSection 482\nCr.P.C for the quashing of the above said FIR.\n\n7. It has also been agreed between the parties that the petition\nfor quashing of the FIR shall also be filed by both the parties\nwithin one month from the date of disposal of petition under\n\nSection 13 (B) (2)\nof HMA.\n\n8. It has been agreed between the parties that the complainant\nshall withdraw the case under\nSection 125\nCr.P.C. from the Court\nof Sh. Brijesh Sethi, Ld.

It has also been agreed between the parties that this settlement\nis full and final and both parties undertake not to file any\ncase/complaint/suit/petition against each other and shall be entitled\nto lead their life independently and both the parties shall not\ninterfere in the life of each other and family members of each\nother.\n\nThis settlement has been voluntarily arrived at between the\nparties with their own freewill and without any force, pressure or\ncoercion and both the parties are bound on the terms and\nconditions herein above. The contents of the settlement have been\nexplained to the parties in vernacular and they have understood the\nsame and have admitted the same to be correct.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nIV. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS\n\n10. A bare perusal of the aforesaid Mediated Settlement Agreement\nreveals that it has been clearly mentioned in clause 5 of the Agreement\nthat the complainant shall \"cooperate with the respondents\" and shall\nfile her affidavit for quashing of the FIR. It is further mentioned that she\nwill also make a statement in terms of compromise arrived at between\nthe parties before this Court. It is, thus, clear that the settlement\nagreement between the parties towards full and final settlement was not\nwith the husband alone, and in case it was so, the word 'respondents'\nwould not have been mentioned in Clause 5 of the Agreement.\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 7 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\n11. Furthermore, clause 9 of the Agreement also mentions that the\nsettlement entered into between the parties was \"full and final\" and that\nboth the parties undertook to not file any \"case/complaint/suit/petition\nagainst each other\". It was also agreed that they \"shall be entitled to\nlead their life independently and both the parties shall not interfere in\nthe life of each other and family members of each other\". The\nconcluding clause also records that the settlement between the parties\nhad been voluntarily arrived at with their own free will and without any\nforce, pressure or coercion, and that the parties would remain bound by\nthe terms of the agreement.\n\n12. If the Settlement Agreement is scrutinized from a close angle, it\nwill be revealed that though it has been signed by the husband only, it is\nclear from the contents of the agreement that the settlement was being\narrived at on behalf of all the respondents i.e. co-accused persons in\npresent FIR since they were his close family members.\n\n13. Moreover, in the judgment dated 27.03.2015 vide which divorce\nwas granted to both the parties, it is mentioned in para no. 5 that\ncomplainant had stated on oath that she had settled all her claims of past,\npresent and future maintenance, and that the final instalment of\nRs.65,000/- would be paid to her at the time of final disposal of the\npetition under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. for quashing the present FIR.\nTherefore, even before the learned Family Court, the complainant/\nrespondent no. 2 did not state that she would make her statement for\nquashing of FIR only qua the husband and not in respect of other\naccused persons i.e. petitioners herein.\n\n14. The complainant in the present case had signed the Settlement\nAgreement voluntarily, and thereafter, had also appeared before this\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 8 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nCourt for the purpose of quashing of FIR against the husband i.e.\npetitioner in CRL.M.C. 3069/2015, wherein the FIR qua the husband\nwas quashed vide order dated 31.07.2015. The operative part of the said\norder passed by this Court reads as under:\n\n\"...Respondent No.2, present in the Court, submits that the dispute\nbetween the parties has been amicably resolved vide aforesaid\nMediated Settlement and terms thereof have been folly acted upon\nas today, she has received the balance settled amount of Rs.\n65,000/- by way of two demand drafts and that divorce by mutual\nconsent has been already granted by the family court on 27\"\n\nMarch, 2015. Respondent No.2 affirms the contents of aforesaid\nMediated Settlement and of her affidavit of supporting this petition\nand submits that now no dispute with petitioner survives, and so,\nthe proceedings arising out of the FIR in question be brought to an\nend.\n\n***\nAccordingly, this petition is allowed and FIR No.519/2012, under\n\nSections 498-A\n/\n/\nof IPC registered at police station Uttaih\nNagar, Delhi and the proceedings emanating therefrom are\nquashed qua petitioner...\"\n\n15. In the case at hand, upon a close perusal and scrutiny of the\nrecords, it transpires that the instant matter had been referred for\nmediation at the time of hearing of anticipatory bail application of the\nhusband of the complainant when rest of the accused persons were not\neven present before the Court concerned and the accused/husband had\nappeared on behalf of other respondents also before mediator as they\nwere his close family members and were primarily facing criminal\naction due to his matrimonial discord with the complainant. In view of\nthe settlement dated 30.07.2014 arrived at between the parties, the\nhusband was admitted to anticipatory bail. Having compromised the\nmatter with his wife, the husband had filed the petition i.e. Crl.M.C. No.\n3069/2015 for quashing of FIR and by that point of time, charge sheet\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 9 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nhad not been filed by the prosecution. Thereafter, because the matter had\nbeen compromised between the parties, the relatives of the husband were\nkept in column no. 11 in the chargesheet i.e. they were chargesheeted\nwithout arrest.\n\n16. Since the matter had already been settled, the learned Magistrate,\npursuant to filing of the chargesheet, had taken cognizance of the\noffence only against the husband, and had neither taken cognizance nor\nhad issued summons to rest of the family members. It was also\nmentioned that cognizance qua other accused persons would be taken\nonly if the accused husband fails to take any steps with regard to filing\nof quashing petition. In this regard, a reference can be made to the order\ndated 14.07.2015 passed by learned Magistrate which reads as under:\n\n\"...It is submitted by the IO that matter has been settled between\nthe parties before the mediation centre on 30.07.2015. Copy of\nmediation order attached with the charge sheet.\nHeard. Record perused.\n\nConsidering the fact that matter has been settled, I take cognizance\nfor the offence\nu/s 498A\n/\n/\nIPC against the accused/husband\nLalit Raj only at this very stage.\n\nCognizance qua rest of the respondents will be considered if no\nstep is taken by the accused for filing quashing petition.\nLet summons to the accused Lalit Raj be issued through IO\nconcerned returnable on 25.08.2015...\"\n\n17. Considering the aforesaid observations of the learned Magistrate\nand the fact that the husband alone had been summoned to appear before\nthe Court, only the husband would have deemed it appropriate to file the\nquashing petition since the impression was that the FIR was filed solely\nagainst him. Subsequently, when the FIR was quashed specifically in\nrelation to him by this Court vide order dated 31.07.2015, the learned\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 10 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nMagistrate was pleased to issue court notice to other accused persons by\nway of following order dated 25.08.2015:\n\n\"...None for accused despite repeated calls. Court is already in\nreceipt of order dated 31.07.2015 passed by Hon'ble High Court\nwhereby present FIR No. 519/12\nu/s 498A\n/\n/\nIPC PS Uttam\nNagar has been quashed for accused Lalit Raj.\nIt is submitted by Ld. APP for the State that as the FIR has already\nbeen quashed, hence nothing is left to be adjudicated upon.\nIn view of the same, after the quashing of FIR, nothing survives\nagainst the accused Lalit Raj. The accused Lalit Raj is discharged.\nHis surety also stand discharged. The documents of the surety if\nany attached with the bonds, be returned to him against\nacknowledgment after cancellation of endorsement.\nAt this stage, it is submitted by the Ld. APP for the State that the\npresent quashing petition has been quashed against accused Lalit\nRaj only, hence he request for summoning rest of the accused\npersons.\n\nHeard.\n\nLet court notice be issued to rest of the accused persons to be\nexecuted through IO concerned, for 28.09.2015...\"\n\n18. Further, four accused persons including the present petitioners\nwere summoned by the learned Magistrate vide order dated 28.09.2015,\nwhich reads as under:\n\n\"...It is submitted by the Ld. Defence counsel that FIR has already\nbeen quashed. To this, Ld. Substitute APP for the State submits\nthat FIR has been quashed against accused Lalit Raj and there are\nspecific allegation against rest of the accused persons, hence he\nrequest to take cognizance against rest of the accused persons.\nHeard.\n\nIn the quashing order it has been specifically mentioned that the\nFIR has been quashed only against the applicant who is the\naccused Lalit Raj and in mediation cell also matter got settled\nbetween accused Lalit Raj and complainant.\n\nIn view of the above, relying upon the submission of Ld. APP for\nthe State and finding specific allegation, let summons be issued to\naccused Rukmani, Chhatarpal, Vijay and Rajiv to be executed\nthrough IO concerned, for 26.10.2015...\"\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 11 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\n19. It was only after the rest of the accused persons i.e. petitioners\nwere summoned by the learned Magistrate that they realized the need to\nfile a petition for quashing of the FIR. Considering the non-legal\nbackgrounds of the parties involved and the specific circumstances of\nthis case, it is plausible that the present petitioners might have assumed\nthat they did not have to file a quashing petition since they had not been\nearlier summoned by the learned Magistrate.\n\n20. To sum up the timeline of the present case, it may be noted that at\nthe time of hearing of anticipatory bail application filed by the husband\npursuant to registration of present FIR, the case had been referred for\nmediation by the Court concerned and thereafter, the matter had been\nsettled. Thus, after the FIR was quashed in relation to the husband as\ncognizance had only been taken against him by the learned Magistrate,\nthe other family members i.e. the petitioners herein may have been\noblivious to the fact that they could have been summoned by the Court\nand the matter, which had been resolved amicably in the year 2014, may\nbe prolonged for another 10 years.\n\n21. Though the complainant has already received the amount that she\nwas to get for quashing of FIR, the FIR was unfortunately quashed only\nqua the husband and not against rest of the family members even though\nthe term 'respondents' had been mentioned in clause 5 of the Settlement\nAgreement which clearly depicts the intention to quash the entire FIR\nagainst all the accused persons. Moreover, the fact that the Agreement\nalso mentions that it is full and final settlement of all past, present and\nfuture claims with each other and that they will not interfere in each\nother's life or in the life of family members of each other, makes it clear\nthat the complainant was well aware that the agreement was being\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 12 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\narrived at between herself and all the respondents. She was also duly\nassisted by her counsels who would have made it clear to her at the time\nof signing the mediation agreement.\n\n22. However, seeking to take advantage of the situation in which the\npresent petitioners are, the complainant appeared before this Court and\nstated that the Mediated Settlement Agreement dated 30.07.2014 was\nonly between her and her husband. She also stated that the monetary\nsettlement arrived at between the parties was also qua the husband only\nand matter may again be sent for mediation if the present petitioners also\nwanted the FIR to be quashed against them.\n\n23. This approach of the complainant, in the considered opinion of\nthis Court, is neither correct nor acceptable as she has already received\nthe entire amount as per the settlement agreement towards settlement of\nall her claims and matrimonial disputes as well as for quashing of\npresent FIR. In case this Court returns a finding that the settlement was\narrived solely between the wife/complainant and the husband, it would\nundermine the fundamental objective of the process of mediation in this\ncase. Suffice it to say, the very purpose of mediation in this case has\nalready been defeated as legal proceedings have been prolonged and\ndragged on for 10 long years despite a successful mediation between the\nparties.\n\n24.\nIn the given set of facts and circumstances, this Court deems it fit\nto advert to the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of\nRuchi\nAgarwal v. Amit Kumar Agrawal\n(2005) 3 SCC 299, wherein the Apex\nCourt while quashing the criminal proceedings against the accused\nhusband on the basis of compromise even though the complainant had\nrefused to give her consent, had observed as under:\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 13 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\n\"6. From the above narrated facts, it is clear that in the compromise\npetition filed before the Family Court, the appellant admitted that\nshe has received Stridhan and maintenance in lump sum and that\nshe will not be entitled to maintenance of any kind in future. She\nalso undertook to withdraw all proceedings civil and criminal filed\nand initiated by her against the respondents within one month of\nthe compromise deed which included the complaint under\nSections\n498A\n,\nand\nIPC and under\nSections 3\nand\nof Dowry\nProhibition Act from which complaint this appeal arises. In the\nsaid compromise, the respondent- husband agreed to withdraw his\npetition filed under\nSection 9\nof the Hindu Marriage Act pending\nbefore the Senior Judge, Civil Division, Rampur and also agreed to\ngive a consent divorce as sought for by the appellant.\n\n7. It is based on the said compromise the appellant obtained a\ndivorce as desired by her under\nSection 13(B)\nof the Hindu\nMarriage Act and in partial compliance of the terms of the\ncompromise she withdrew the criminal case filed under\nSection\nof the Criminal Procedure Code but for reasons better known\nto her she did not withdraw that complaint from which this appeal\narises. That apart after the order of the High Court quashing the\nsaid complaint on the ground of territorial jurisdiction, she has\nchosen to file this appeal. It is in this background, we will have to\nappreciate the merits of this appeal.\n\n8. ....Therefore, we are of the opinion that the appellant having\nreceived the relief she wanted without contest on the basis of the\nterms of the compromise, we cannot now accept the argument of\nthe learned counsel for the appellant. In our opinion, the conduct of\nthe appellant indicates that the criminal complaint from which this\nappeal arises was filed by the wife only to harass the respondents.\n\n9. In view of the above said subsequent events and the conduct of\nthe appellant, it would be an abuse of the process of the court if the\ncriminal proceedings from which this appeal arises is allowed to\ncontinue. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion to do\ncomplete justice, we should while dismissing this appeal also\nquash proceedings arising from the Criminal Case\nNo.Cr.No.224/2003 registered in Police Station, Bilaspur,\n(Distt.Rampur) filed under\nSections 498A\n,\nand\nIPC and\nunder\nSections 3\nand\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act against the\nrespondents herein...\"\n\n25.

State Crl.M.C. 3230-32/2006,\nwhile dealing with a situation wherein the complainant wife had refused\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 14 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nto appear before the Court for quashing of FIR after having received all\nthe settlement amount and after divorce proceedings had been\nconcluded, had also quashed the FIR against the accused husband with\nthe following observations:\n\n\"13. This court cannot but accept the statements made on oath by\nRespondent No. 2 accepting the terms of the compromise and\nrecorded by and forming part of the record of the Punjab and\nHaryana High Court. She has also accepted the sum of Rs. 4 lakhs\nin terms of the compromise. The divorce has been granted and the\ncriminal case for maintenance stands withdrawn. Only the last bit\nregarding the quashing of the criminal proceedings under\nSections\n498A\n,\n/\nIPC remains. With the Respondent No. 2 not\nappearing in these proceedings to contest the petition, the\nassertions of the petitioners as noted hereinabove remain\nuncontroverter.\n\n14. This Court is therefore inclined to follow the aforementioned\ntwo decisions of the Supreme Court in Ruchi Agarwal and Mohd.\nShamim and quash the pending criminal proceedings against the\npetitioners. It may be mentioned that the learned APP for the State\nalso does not dispute the facts stated in the petition or the law as\nsettled by the Supreme Court. He expresses no objection the\nquashing of the FIR in view of the aforesaid developments.\n\n15. Consequently the FIR No. 575 of 2002 registered in Police\nStation Rajouri Garden, New Delhi on 26th July 2002 under\n\nSections 498A\n,\n/\nIPC and all proceedings consequent thereto\nhereby stand quashed. The petition is allowed but with no order as\nto costs.\"\n\n26. A similar view was also taken by this Court in\nDalbir Singh v.\nState\n2011 SCC OnLine Del 3528.\n\n27. The present petitioners had been victims of circumstances not\nonly in the past when they had failed to file quashing petitions for\nhaving not been summoned by the learned Magistrate, but now again,\nsince the complainant, despite having received the full and final\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 15 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nsettlement amount, has refused to give her statement for quashing of the\nFIR.\n\n28. Upon a careful analysis and calibration of how the mediation\nprocess was conducted in this case from start to finish and keeping in\nmind the peculiar circumstances of the present case, it is difficult to\naccept that the settlement in this case was only qua husband for the\npurpose of quashing of FIR. As the surrounding circumstances indicate,\nthe negotiations and execution of the settlement agreement took place\npursuant to a Court referred mediation, and both the parties had engaged\nlegal counsels and after negotiations, the substance of the agreement had\nbeen reduced into writing, which is a matter of dispute today. The\ncomplainant had understood and acted upon the agreement in question\nas she had filed petition for obtaining mutual consent divorce, had\nwithdrawn certain cases and FIR against husband had been quashed and\nshe had received all the money that she had agreed to as full and final\nsettlement of the dispute with the husband and had undertaken that both\nof them will not interfere in peaceful life of each other and their family\nmembers life. The settlement agreement therefore, has to be accessed in\nthe context of the circumstances in which it has reached this Court.\n\n29. Thus, considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case\nand for the reasons stated in the preceding discussion, this Court is of the\nview that it would be gross injustice to the present petitioners if the\ncriminal proceedings arising out of instant FIR qua them are allowed to\nbe continued, when the complainant had already settled all her\nmatrimonial disputes, had undertaken not to interfere in lives of family\nmembers of her husband, and had also received monetary sum including\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 16 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nRs.65,000/- specifically for the purpose of quashing FIR against\n'respondents' (i.e. accused persons) in the present case.\n\nV. CONCERN AND DUTY OF THE COURT\n\n(a) Dispute Over Clause Which Resolved The Dispute: Reasons\n\n30. However, before parting with this case, this Court notes that the\ndispute in question has arisen primarily due to an inadequately worded\nand ambiguous Mediated Settlement Agreement.\n\n31. In the process of mediation, the task of drafting an agreement at\nthe culmination of long, arduous and challenging mediation proceedings\ncarries significant responsibility. Each word included in the agreement\nholds importance for the parties involved. This is particularly crucial in\ncases involving criminal matters, as omission of even a single word can\nlead to severe legal ramifications and the interested parties can exploit\nsuch loopholes to their advantage, causing disadvantages to the opposing\nparty.\n\n32. The primary objective of mediation in matrimonial cases is to\nfacilitate early resolution of disputes outside the Courts. In India,\nmatrimonial disputes often include criminal proceedings. In case of\ncomprehensive settlement agreements between the parties, especially\nwhen law mandates mediation in cases of family and matrimonial\ndisputes, a number of issues should be considered and the settlement\nagreements arrived at from successful mediation must be drafted with\ndue care and caution, so that the very purpose of mediation is not\ndefeated.\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 17 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\n33. In cases relating to matrimonial offences, at times, there are\ndistant relatives, old parents, married sisters, etc. who are also involved\nand arraigned as accused, but they may not attend the mediation\nproceedings as the same generally will take place between the two key\nplayers i.e. the husband and wife. In such cases, the disputes are often\nsettled on behalf of the entire family by the husband. The mediator\nwhile drafting an agreement must remember that the parties have come\nto an understanding and have reached a mediated settlement with\nwillingness to resolve the disputes due to the skills of the mediator and\nhelp of family, friends, counsels etc., however, their own needs and\nprotection of their interests remains paramount.\n\n34. In the present case, as already discussed at length, the complainant\nhad settled all her matrimonial disputes and had received Rs.2,75,000/-\ntowards full and final settlement of all her claims and had also agreed to\ncooperate in quashing of FIR qua the 'respondents'. However, ambiguity\nand lack of clarity in the Mediated Settlement Agreement was sought to\nbe misused before this Court by the complainant.\n\n35. Rather than merely writing in the Settlement Agreement that a\npetition for quashing would be filed \"by the respondents for quashing of\nFIR\", had the mediator specifically mentioned that the FIR as well as all\nproceedings emanating therefrom were to be quashed qua all the accused\npersons, along with their names\n,\nin that case\n, even if the learned\nMagistrate was to decide on issuance of summons to the accused\npersons, the said Agreement drafted by the Mediator would have come\nto the rescue of the present petitioners. In such a situation, the\ncomplainant would have been bound to co-operate even in those\nproceedings which emanated from the same FIR. In other words, the\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 18 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nMediated Settlement Agreement in the present case should have been\nmore explicit, particularly in terms of clearly identifying and specifying\nthe names of all the respondents referred to in the agreement.\n\n36. The Mediator should have ensured that all the persons against\nwhom allegations had been levelled and were named in the FIR,\nquashing of which was agreed between the parties, their names and\nidentities were clearly spelt out in the Settlement Agreement, rather than\nusing the general term 'respondents'.\n\n37. Therefore, as gathered by this Court after going through entire\nrecords, lack of incorporation of specific names of the respondents, or\npersons named in the FIR, in the Settlement Agreement has put the\nparties concerned at disadvantage and has resulted in unwanted\nprolonging of criminal proceedings, which were already settled between\nthem long back. The very purpose of resolving the dispute at the earliest\nhas been successfully defeated in the present case despite a successful\nmediation due to a carelessly worded Mediated Settlement Agreement.\n\n38. There is no denying the fact that each case that reaches mediation\nand successfully culminates into a settlement is based on its own\ncircumstances and dynamics.\n\n39. To put it differently, an inadequately drafted agreement will be\nthe one which fails to include essential elements such as the name of all\nthe relevant parties, the terms outlining the conditions of settlement, and\nthe consequences in the event of non-compliance or breach.\n\n40. While deliberating upon such issues, this Court also takes note of\nthe decision rendered by Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in\nRajat\nGupta v. Rupali Gupta\n2018 SCC OnLine Del 9005, wherein four\nquestions of law had been sent for consideration by way of reference,\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 19 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nand the Court had laid down detailed guidelines regarding drawing up\npetitions and agreements in cases filed for divorce by mutual consent.\n\n41. The mediation process involving family disputes, albeit, is no\nmore in its infancy in India. However, considering the problems that\narise in such disputes, it is still evolving and trying to grapple with new\nproblems which may arise on several grounds. While there can be no\nfixed pattern for preparing an agreement or a performa to fill in for the\npurpose of affecting a settlement before a mediator, the mediators\ndealing especially with matrimonial disputes should keep in mind that\nsuch agreements are reached with an intent to attain finality to all the\ndisputes. In matrimonial disputes, the parties in majority of cases want\nthe disputes to be settled at the earliest while the emotions and tempers\nrun high. While the Mediator performs the duty of not only dealing with\nthose tempers but also their disagreements and emotions, the mediator\nalso has another responsibility to ensure that the agreement reached by\nthe parties, as well as the hard work of the parties, their families,\ncounsels and the Mediator, is crystalised. It is unfortunate to note that\nthese attempts fail in a large number of cases, and the parties find\nthemselves in conflict once again due to flaws or ambiguities in the\nsettlement agreements.\n\n(b) Guidelines Apropos Drafting A Settlement Agreement in\nMatrimonial Disputes with Special Reference to Clauses dealing\nwith Criminal Cases\n\n42. Having discussed the significance of process of mediation in\nresolution of a dispute, especially those arising out of family and\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 20 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nmatrimonial cases, and having taken note of complexities that can arise\ndue to inadequate drafting, inconsistencies, omissions or oversights\nwithin a settlement agreement achieved between parties subsequent to a\nsuccessful mediation, this Court deems it appropriate to lay down\nfollowing guidelines in relation to drafting of a Mediated Settlement\nAgreement, in addition to the guidelines laid down:\n\n(i) Specify Names of Parties: The agreement must specifically\ncontain names of all the parties to the agreement.\n\n(ii) Avoid Ambiguous Terms: The terms such as 'respondent',\n'respondents', 'petitioner' or 'petitioners', in absence of\ntheir names in the agreement must be avoided in an\nagreement as it leads to ambiguities and further litigation.\n\n(iii) Include All Details: The terms and conditions of the\nagreement reached between the parties, howsoever small and\nminute they may be, must be incorporated in the agreement.\n\n(iv) Timeline For Compliance: The timeline of the fulfilment\nof terms and conditions as well as their execution must be\nclearly mentioned. There should be no tentative dates as far\nas possible.\n\n(v) Default Clause: A default clause should be incorporated in\nthe agreement and the consequences thereof should be\nexplained and enlisted in the agreement itself.\n\n(vi) Mode of Payment: In case any payment is to be made as per\nsettlement, the agreement should specify the method of\npayment agreed upon between the parties which should also\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 21 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nbe as per their convenience i.e. electronic mode, by way of a\nDemand Draft or FDR and the necessary details for\nfulfilment of this condition.\n\n(vii) Follow-Up Documents: The agreement should also\nstipulate as to which Follow-up documents are to be\nprepared and signed by which party. It may also be\nmentioned as to when, where, how and at whose cost such\ndocuments are to be prepared in furtherance of the terms of\nthe agreement, as far as possible.\n\n(viii) Cases involving 498A\nIPC\n: Further, especially in cases of\nmatrimonial disputes, where one of the conditions in the\nAgreement is to cooperate in quashing of FIR, such as those\nunder\nSection 498A\nIPC, and filing of affidavit and\nappearing in the Court for the purpose of the same, it is\nadvisable that the agreement must stipulate the names of all\nthe parties concerned who have been named in the FIR\nspecifically and the fact that the claims have been settled in\ntotality for quashing of entire FIR and proceedings\nemanating therefrom qua all persons named in the FIR. It be\nalso clarified specifically that the FIR will be quashed in\ntotality against all the persons arrested, not arrested,\nchargesheeted, not chargesheeted, with their names and\nwhether the entire FIR will be quashed against all of them\nupon payment by husband or any other person on behalf of\nthe husband.\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 22 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\n(ix) Criminal Complaints/Cross-cases: Criminal Complaints\nfiled by parties against each other, pending trial or\ninvestigation should also find specific mention with names\nof all the parties, the Court concerned, and as to how the\nparties intend to deal with them. The number/details of the\ncomplaint, FIR, Sections under which they have been filed,\nshould also be mentioned specifically.\n\n(x) Read and Understood: The agreement should necessarily\nmention that all the parties have read and understood the\ncontents of the settlement agreement in their vernacular\nlanguage.\n\n(xi) Signing of Agreement: In case only one or some parties are\npresent during mediation proceedings and only their\nsignatures are obtained on the agreement, it be clearly\nmentioned and clarified that the agreement is being signed\non behalf of those relatives or parties also even in case they\nare not present, in case the agreement is qua them too and\nthey are not present in person due to age, ailment, distance\nor any other reason. It is important to do so since in\nmatrimonial offences, the near and distant relatives may, due\nto above reasons, not be present in person but agreements\nare reached in totality, especially regarding quashing of FIRs\nand criminal proceedings and withdrawal of complaints.\n\n(xii) Clarity of Language: At last, the language used in a\nsettlement agreement must be definite enough to understand\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 23 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nthe real intention of the parties and the goals they wish to\nachieve by entering into the agreement.\n\n(c) Judicial Realism: Urgent Need to have Settlement\nAgreements in Hindi\n\n43. There is an urgent need to ensure that the agreement drafted to\nsettle the issues to bring an end to a future or pending lis does not itself\nbecome a matter of dispute giving rise to another lis between the parties.\nThe common understanding of the parties on essential conditions for\nenforceability of an agreement is crucial in a mediated settlement\nagreement and expressing intentions and commitments to the agreement\nthrough clear and concise language is critical for its effective\nenforcement. But a mediator should bear in mind that the level of\nunderstanding of the parties concerned may vary according to their\nsocial backgrounds, and thus, the mediator should remain attentive and\nalert to the circumstances, capacity, and linguistic abilities of the parties\ninvolved, considering their backgrounds and language proficiency. Since\nmediated settlement agreements are usually drafted in English, it is\nimportant to carefully draft and ensure that the parties concerned\ncomprehend the agreement in vernacular language as this can\nsignificantly impact its effectiveness and execution.\n\n44. This Court also remains conscious of the fact that the majority of\nlitigants who approach this Court and the Courts below speak Hindi as\ntheir first language. Given that Hindi is their mother tongue, they are far\nmore adept at speaking and understanding it than they are at other\nlanguages such as English. However, the mediated settlement\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 24 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nagreements in Delhi are drafted only in English. In such a scenario, the\nSettlement Agreement and the conditions thereof may not always be\nadequately clear to the parties and at times, the translation from English\nto Hindi may not convey exactly what the parties intend to do.\n\n45. It can be noted that as per directions of the Central Government, a\nHindi Department has been constituted in every Court and Hindi\nCommittee is also constituted in every Court complex. The project of\ntranslation of the judgments from English to Hindi is already\nsuccessfully working under guidance of Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\ni. Preparation of Mediated Settlement Agreements in Hindi\n\n46. It is, therefore, directed that concerned In-charge of Mediation\nCentres will ensure that the mediated settlement agreements are\nprepared in Hindi language also, in addition to English language, as\nfar as possible. It is being directed since in majority of cases, the parties\ndo not comprehend English and their spoken language and mother\ntongue is Hindi. However, in cases the parties are well-versed in English\nlanguage and want the agreement to be in English language only, there\nwill be no such insistence or requirement.\n\n47. This Court hopes that once the agreements are written in Hindi,\nwherever required, which the parties understand and the Mediator\nperforms his/her duty carefully, it will ensure not only finality of\nagreements in the mediation centers but also its successful culmination\nin the Courts of law which is the aim and objective of mediation centers.\n\n48. Also because the aim of mediation is to reduce or resolve\nlitigation and not to escalate it, it would be apt to ask both the parties to\nbring their agreements in their own language even in skeletal form,\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 25 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nwhich can help the mediator to ensure that none of the conditions is left\nout while preparing the final draft or agreement.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\n49. While it is difficult to lay down a definitive list of factors to be\nconsidered while drafting mediated settlement agreements, this Court\nhas made an effort to bring the issue to the fore and try to provide a\nsolution as this Court is alive to the plight of the parties where even after\nten years of having reached an agreement, they are still before the Court\nwhere the clause vide which agreement was reached is itself under\nchallenge due to its ambiguity.\n\n50. The above guidelines and directions, as enlisted in para no. 42 and\n46 are in addition to the guidelines and directions contained in the\njudgment of\nRajat Gupta v. Rupali Gupta\n(supra) passed by Hon'ble\nDivision Bench of this Court in respect of the issues raised before the\nCourt therein.\n\n51. Coming back to the present case, the parties to the settlement\nagreement had demonstrated their intention to release one another from\nall past, present and future claims and had settled all the matrimonial\ndisputes against each other and their families, but the petitioners herein\ncould not have foreseen that the complainant will use the ambiguity in\nthe Mediated Settlement Agreement after ten years to their detriment.\nWhile the contextual analysis in this case indicates mutually acceptable\nagreement between the parties, the Settlement Agreement reflects the\nunderstanding of the parties towards the economic consequences and\ntowards attaining a finality to the lis. However, the absence of a default\nclause and the conditions being written in inadequate terms have come\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 26 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nin the way of putting an end to the litigation and the misery of the\npetitioners. While the petitioners herein thought that they were insulated\nfrom any claim from the complainant or from criminal charges as the\ncase had been settled and the FIR was agreed to be quashed wherein\nthey were named, they remained unaware of the change of mind of the\ncomplainant which happened before this Court.\n\n52. In cases of matrimonial disputes and proceedings of divorce, both\nthe parties go through one of the most stressful phases of their lives. In\ncases such as the present one, where the matter was settled at an early\nstage and the parties were able to reach the final agreement, the mediator\nshould also be careful of the future consequences of the agreement that\nthe parties were arriving at, and the fact that fulfilment of one condition\nleads to another and in matrimonial cases, fulfilment of each condition\nand successful culmination and execution of such an agreement can\nmake or break many lives.\n\n53. When a Court is faced with a situation as the present one, it is left\nwith no other option but to look at the circumstances in which the\nagreement was negotiated and executed and also peruse the records to\nfind the original objective which the parties were seeking to achieve as\nwell as the original intention exhibited by subsequent substantial\ncompliance with the terms of the mediated settlement agreement. The\ncomplainant, who is now seeking to persuade this Court to believe that\nshe had not agreed to settle the case with rest of the accused persons i.e.\npetitioners herein though she has already obtained a mutual consent\ndivorce and has received the entire amount for quashing of the FIR, had\nto bring before this Court the reasons and circumstances which reflect\nthat she can make significant departure from the settlement agreement\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 27 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nqua the present petitioners, and the clock cannot be put back by setting\naside the entire settlement agreement.\n\n54. This Court, therefore, having taken a broader approach of\ncharacterising the main issue in this case as discussed above, holds that\nthe agreement in the present case for quashing of the FIR was qua all\nthe respondents as mentioned in clause 5 of the Settlement Agreement\nin question.\n\n55. Thus, as far as the prayer in the present petition is concerned, the\nsame is allowed and the FIR bearing no. 519/2012, registered at Police\nStation Uttam Nagar, for the offences punishable under\nSections\n498A\n/\n/\nIPC and all proceedings emanating therefrom stands\nquashed.\n\n56. Accordingly, the present petition stands disposed of in above\nterms and directions.\n\nVII. WAY FORWARD\n\n57. To conclude, this Court notes that the confusion that arose due to\nan ambiguity in the settlement agreement and the prolonging of the\npresent case for ten years after having been settled underscored the\nimportance of laying down the above mentioned guidelines for\npreparation of mediated settlement agreements. The lives of people\nembroiled in matrimonial litigation are often in state of turmoil, and\nthus, the mediation as a method of alternate dispute resolution has to\ncome to their rescue instead of further extending the state of turmoil.\nGuidance needed by the mediators to draft agreements with degree\nof coherence, consistency, and unambiguity will come a long way in\nhealing the lives of those in need of such healing by immediately\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 28 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:3396\n\nputting an end to a dispute and further insulating them from future\nlitigation. This Court by way of this judgment only aims to ensure that\nchallenges to such mediation agreements due to lack of clarity or\nmissing out on the crucial aspects of the agreement are minimized.\n\n58. A copy of this judgment be forwarded to In-Charge, Delhi High\nCourt Mediation and Conciliation Centre (SAMADHAN) as well as\nconcerned In-charge of all the Mediation Centres in all District Courts of\nDelhi, for taking note and ensuring compliance and for further\ncirculation among all learned mediators. A copy be also forwarded to\nDirector (Academics), Delhi Judicial Academy.\n\n59. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.\n\nSWARANA KANTA SHARMA, J\nMAY 16, 2023/ns\n\nSignature Not Verified CRL.M.C. 6197/2019 Page 29 of 29\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\n\nSigning Date:19.05.2023\n\n19:24:46",
