Appeal (DB) No. 250 of 2024\n ----\n\nLalu Prasad Saw @ Lalu Prasad Sahu @ Lalu Prasad\n ... ... Appellant\n Versus\nThe State of Jharkhand ... ... Respondent\n\n -------\n\nCORAM :HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SUJIT NARAYAN PRASAD\n HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE NAVNEET KUMAR\n\n ------\n\nFor the Appellant : Mr. Suraj Kumar, Advocate\n Mr. Robin Kumar, Advocate\nFor the Respondent : Mr. Bhola Nath Ojha, APP\n\n --------\n\n th\nOrder No. 06 : Dated 19 November, 2024\n\nI.A. No. 9108 of 2024\n\n1. The instant interlocutory application has been filed on\n\nbehalf of appellant under Section 389(1) and (2) \nCr.P.C\n for\n\nsuspension of sentence dated 19.01.2024 passed by the\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Lohardaga in S.T. Case\n\nNo. 36 of 2022 arising out of Bagru P.S. Case No. 25 of 2021\n\ncorresponding to G.R. Case No. 74 of 2022, whereby and\n\nwhereunder, the appellant has been convicted and sentenced\n\nto undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for life for the offence\n\nunder \nSection 304-B\n/\n34\n IPC and further sentenced to\n\nundergo RI for 3 years for the offence under \nSection 498A\n/\n34\n\nIPC with fine of Rs. 10,000 and in default of payment of fine\n\nhe shall further undergo SI for three months and the\n\nappellant was further directed to undergo RI for 2 years with\n\nfine of Rs. 10,000 for the offence U/S 4 \nD.P. Act\n and in\n\n -2-\n\ndefault of payment of fine to undergo SI for three months. All\n\nthe sentences were directed to go concurrently.\n\n2. It has been submitted on behalf of the appellant that he\n\nhas falsely been implicated in this case. There is no material\n\navailable to substantiate the allegation of demand of dowry\n\nand more so the deceased has died due to drowning in the\n\nwell in which she fell.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted by\n\nplacing reliance upon the order passed by the Co-ordinate\n\nBench of this Court in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 149 of 2024\n\nwhereby the co-convict, namely, Arjun Saw @ Arjun Sahu\n\nhas been directed to be released on bail vide order dated\n\n06.08.2024 observing that \"the death is due to drowning,\n\nwhich is apparent from the postmortem report and there is\n\nno injury on the person of the deceased\".\n\n4. Learned counsel for the appellant, based upon the\n\naforesaid ground has submitted that it is a fit case where\n\nsentence is to be suspended taking into consideration the\n\nfact that the death is due to drowning, which is evident from\n\npostmortem report.\n\n5. While on the other hand, Mr. Bhola Nath Ojha, learned\n\nAPP appearing for the State has vehemently opposed the\n\nprayer for suspension of sentence.\n\n6. It has been contended that the basis of conviction is\n\nmade under \nSection 113(B)\n of the Evidence Act reason being\n\n -3-\n\nthat the dead body was found from the well which is inside\n\nthe house that is in orchard of the house of the appellant\n\ni.e., matrimonial house of the deceased.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the State has submitted that order\n\npassed the Co-ordinate Bench while granting bail by\n\nsuspension of sentence of Arjun Saw @ Arjun Sahu in Cr.\n\nAppeal (DB) No. 149 of 2024 is distinguishable on two\n\ncounts i.e., the said co-convict is the brother-in-law and\n\nfurther there is no consideration of provision of \nSection\n\n113(B)\n of the Evidence Act. Further, here the appellant is the\n\nhusband against whom the demand of dowry has\n\nconclusively been proved and such under \nSection 113(B)\n of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, the onus is upon the appellant to\n\nshow the bona fide the reason of death since the death has\n\nadmittedly occurred in the matrimonial house of the\n\ndeceased wherein the dead body has been found in the well.\n\n8. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone\n\nacross the finding recorded by the learned trial Court in the\n\nimpugned judgment as also the testimony of the witnesses\n\nas available in the Lower Court Records as also the order\n\npassed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Cr. Appeal\n\n(DB) No. 149 of 2024 whereby the co-convict, namely, Arjun\n\nSaw @ Arjun Sahu has been directed to be released on bail\n\nvide order dated 06.08.2024.\n\n -4-\n\n9. This Court in order to appreciate the argument\n\nadvanced on behalf of the parties has found the imputation\n\nmade against the appellant based upon the first information\n\nreport that the death of the daughter of the informant has\n\noccurred on account of non-fulfillment of dowry. Hence, a\n\ncase was instituted under \nSection 304B\n/\n34\n and \n498A\n/\n34\n\nIPC as also under \nSection 3\n/ \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act.\n\nAfter completion of the investigation, the charge-sheet was\n\nsubmitted and accordingly charged were framed against the\n\nappellant for the said offence.\n\n10. This Court has gone through the testimonies of all the\n\nwitnesses, who consistently have deposed about demand of\n\ndowry and for that reason within a period of six and half\n\nmonths from the date of solemnization of marriage, the\n\ndeceased-wife was killed. It is also admitted fact on the basis\n\nof material available on record that the death has been\n\nshown to be caused due to drowning. The dead body was\n\nfound from the well which was situated in the orchard of the\n\nmatrimonial house of the deceased, i.e, the house of the\n\nappellant, who is the husband of the deceased. After taking\n\nout of the dead body from the well, the body was sent for\n\npost mortem where the cause of death has been shown to be\n\ndue to drowning.\n\n11. This Court has also considered the testimony of the\n\ndoctor [PW 7], who has conducted the postmortem, who has\n\n -5-\n\nopined that the lungs were found water-logged, voluminous\n\nand completely cover the heart. On section blood stained\n\nfrothy fluid streams away from cut surface. Heart right\n\nchamber full and containing dark and red blood, left\n\nchamber of heart empty.\n\n12. The learned trial court after taking into consideration\n\nthe implication of Section 113( B) of the Evidence Act as also\n\ntaking into consideration the fact that the dead body was\n\nfound from the well which was inside the matrimonial house\n\nof the deceased and as such has found the culpability\n\nagainst the appellant.\n\n13. This Court after having referred the aforesaid has\n\nconsidered the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench in Cr.\n\nAppeal (DB) No. 149 of 2024 whereby the co-convict, namely,\n\nArjun Saw @ Arjun Sahu, who is the brother-in-law of the\n\nappellant, has been directed to be released on bail vide order\n\ndated 06.08.2024.\n\n14. The learned counsel for the appellant has referred the\n\nobservation made by the Co-ordinate Bench the death is due\n\nto drowning, which is apparent from the postmortem report\n\nand there is no injury on the person of the deceased. The\n\naforesaid fact admittedly is not in dispute but the question\n\nherein is that consideration which has been made by the\n\nlearned trial Court under \nSection 113(B)\n of the Evidence Act\n\nand taking into consideration the statutory provision since\n\n -6-\n\nthe death is inside the house of the appellant and the body\n\nof the deceased was found in well which was inside the\n\nhouse of the appellant and as such the appellant being the\n\nhusband it is onus upon him to disprove the charge imputed\n\nagainst him in view of provision of the \nEvidence Act\n\nparticularly \nSection 106\n IPC.\n\n15. The appellant, in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 149 of 2024,\n\nnamely, Arjun Saw @ Arjun Sahu, who is the brother-in-law\n\nof the appellant, the Co-ordinate Bench did not find any\n\nmaterial against him that the brother-in-law was living in the\n\nsame house i.e., matrimonial house of the deceased.\n\n16. Therefore, this Court based upon the material available\n\non record, is of view that the principle of parity will not apply\n\nwith case of Arun Saw @ Arjun Sahu to that of the present\n\nappellant in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nin the case of \nRamesh Bhavan Rathod vs. Vishanbhai\n\nHirabhai Makwana\n, (2021) 6 SCC 230, wherein it has\n\nbeen laid down that the principle of parity is to be\n\nmaintained but while applying the principle of parity, the\n\nfactual aspect as also the fact upon which the judgment of\n\nconviction has been passed is required to be compared with.\n\nFor ready reference relevant paragraph is quoted as under:\n\n \"25. We are constrained to observe that the orders passed by\n the High Court granting bail fail to pass muster under the law.\n They are oblivious to, and innocent of, the nature and gravity\n of the alleged offences and to the severity of the punishment in\n\n -7-\n\nthe event of conviction. In Neeru Yadav v. State of U.P. [Neeru\nYadav v. State of U.P., (2014) 16 SCC 508 :] , this Court has\nheld that while applying the principle of parity, the High Court\ncannot exercise its powers in a capricious manner and has to\nconsider the totality of circumstances before granting bail. This\nCourt observed : (SCC p. 515, para 17)\n\n\"17. Coming to the case at hand, it is found that when a stand\nwas taken that the second respondent was a history-sheeter,\nit was imperative on the part of the High Court to scrutinise\nevery aspect and not capriciously record that the second\nrespondent is entitled to be admitted to bail on the ground of\nparity. It can be stated with absolute certitude that it was not\na case of parity and, therefore, the impugned order [\nMitthan\nYadav v. State of U.P.\n, 2014 SCC OnLine All 16031] clearly\nexposes the non-application of mind. That apart, as a matter of\nfact it has been brought on record that the second respondent\nhas been charge-sheeted in respect of number of other heinous\noffences. The High Court has failed to take note of the same.\nTherefore, the order has to pave the path of extinction, for its\napproval by this Court would tantamount to travesty of justice,\nand accordingly we set it aside.\n\n26. Another aspect of the case which needs emphasis is the\nmanner in which the High Court has applied the principle of\nparity. By its two orders both dated 21-12-2020 [\nPravinbhai\nHirabhai Koli v. State of Gujarat\n, 2020 SCC OnLine Guj 2986] ,\n[Khetabhai Parbatbhai Makwana v. State of Gujarat, 2020\nSCC OnLine Guj 2988] , the High Court granted bail to Pravin\nKoli (A-10) and Kheta Parbat Koli (A-15).\n \nParity was sought\nwith Sidhdhrajsinh Bhagubha Vaghela (A-13) to whom bail\nwas granted on 22-10-2020 [\nSiddhrajsinh Bhagubha Vaghela\nv. State of Gujarat\n, 2020 SCC OnLine Guj 2985] on the ground\n(as the High Court recorded) that he was \"assigned similar\nrole of armed with stick (sic)\". Again, bail was granted to\nVanraj Koli (A-16) on the ground that he was armed with a\nwooden stick and on the ground that Pravin (A-10), Kheta (A-\n\n15) and Sidhdhrajsinh (A-13) who were armed with sticks had\nbeen granted bail. The High Court has evidently\nmisunderstood the central aspect of what is meant by parity.\n\n -8-\n\n Parity while granting bail must focus upon the role of the\n accused. Merely observing that another accused who was\n granted bail was armed with a similar weapon is not sufficient\n to determine whether a case for the grant of bail on the basis\n of parity has been established. In deciding the aspect of\n parity, the role attached to the accused, their position in\n relation to the incident and to the victims is of utmost\n importance. The High Court has proceeded on the basis of\n parity on a simplistic assessment as noted above, which again\n cannot pass muster under the law.\"\n\n \n17. The Hon'ble Apex Court in \nTarun Kumar vs.\n\n Assistant Director Directorate of Enforcement\n, (2023)\n\n SCC OnLine SC 1486 wherein at paragraph-18, it has\n\n been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that parity is not the\n\n law and while applying the principle of parity, the Court is\n\n required to focus upon the role attached to the accused\n\n whose application is under consideration.\n\n 18. This Court based upon the aforesaid discussion is of the\n\n view that the case of the present appellant is quite\n\n distinguishable to the case of Arun Saw @ Arjun Sahu, as\n\n such no parity can be given to the case of present appellant.\n\n 19. Accordingly, the present Interlocutory Application\n\n stands dismissed.\n\n (Sujit Narayan Prasad, J.)\n\n (Navneet Kumar, J.)\nAlankar/",
