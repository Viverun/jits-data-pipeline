GHUGE\n&\nY. G. KHOBRAGADE, JJ.\n\nReserved on : 12th July, 2024\n\nPronounced on : 08th August, 2024\n\nJUDGMENT (Per Ravindra V. Ghuge, J.):\n-\n\n1. Rule. Rule made returnable forthwith and heard\n\nfinally, with the consent of the parties.\n\nWe are reminded of the words of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in\nO.P. Singla and another vs. Union of India\n\nand others\n, (1984) 4 SCC 450 :-\n\n\"Once again, we are back to the irksome question of inter\n\nse seniority between promotees and direct recruits\".\n\n2. In this judgment, for the sake of brevity, the\n\n'Directly Appointed Deputy Collectors' would be referred to as\n\n'DDC' and the 'Promotee Deputy Collectors' would be referred\n\nto as 'PDC'.\n\n3. The two Petitions (Transfer Application Nos.1 and 2\n*13* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nof 2021) were filed by Shivaji Tukaram Shinde with Sunil\n\nVitthalrao Yadav and Smt. Samiksha Ramakant Chandrakar with\n\nPandurang Ramrao Kulkarni. These four Applicants (PDC) had\n\nchallenged the final seniority list of the officers in the cadre of\n\nDeputy Collectors for the period 01.01.1999 to 31.12.2003\n\npublished by the State vide circular dated 31.12.2020, which was\n\nthe impugned seniority list. The grievance of these Applicants\n\nwas that they had been wrongly pushed down from Sr.Nos.411\n\nand 413 (provisional seniority list published on 24.09.2009) to\n\nSr.Nos.599 and 603, respectively, by the impugned final seniority\n\nlist published on 31/12/2020. The other two were pushed down\n\nfrom Sr.Nos.323 and 328 to Sr.Nos.500 and 506, respectively. It\n\nwas contended that the State desired to favour the DDC and\n\nhence, the seniority of the PDC was wrongly reckoned with from\n\nthe date, other than their date of continuous officiation. For the\n\nsake of brevity, the prayers in Transfer Application Nos.1 and 2\n\nof 2021, are reproduced hereunder :-\n\n\"Transfer Application No.1/2021:-\n\nA) Rule may kindly be issued.\n\nB) Rule may kindly be made absolute by quashing\n& setting aside the impugned final seniority list\nof the cadre of Deputy Collectors dated\n31/12/2020 (Annex. H) prepared & published\nby Resp. No. 1.\n\n*14* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nC) Rule may kindly be made absolute by further\n\ndirecting the Resp. No. 1 to prepare & publish\na fresh final seniority list of the cadre of Deputy\nCollectors perfectly in tune with the provisions\nof Rules 4, 10, 12, 13 and 14 of the\n\"Maharashtra Deputy Collectors (Recruitment,\nFixation of Seniority and Confirmation) Rules,\n1977 and on the basis of the provisional\nseniority list already prepared & published on\n24/09/2009.\n\nD) Pending the admission, hearing and final\ndisposal of this Writ Petition the effect,\noperation and implementation of the impugned\nfinal seniority list of the cadre of Deputy\nCollectors dated 31/12/2020 (Annex. H)\nprepared & published by Resp. No. 1 may\nkindly be stayed and the Resp. No. 1 may kindly\nbe restrained from effecting any promotions on\nthe basis of the said list.\n\nE) The cost of this Writ Petition be awarded to the\npetitioner.\n\nF) Any other appropriate relief as may be deemed\nfit by this Hon'ble Court be granted in favour of\nthe petitioner.\n\nTransfer Application No.2/2021:-\nA) Writ Petition may kindly be allowed.\nB) The impugned Final Seniority Lists published\nby R-1 vide Circular dated 31.12.2020 at Exh.\n\n'E' may kindly be quashed and set aside, by\ndirecting to prepare the Seniority Lists strictly\nin tune with the provisions of Rule 4 read with\nRule 13 and Rule 14 of the Maharashtra\nDeputy Collectors (Recruitment, Fixation of\nSeniority & Confirmation) Rules, 1977 at Exh.\n'B' hereto.\n\nC) Pending hearing and final disposal of this Writ\nPetition, execution & implementation of the\nimpugned Seniority List published by R-1 vide\nCircular dated 31.12.2020 at Exh. 'E' may\nkindly be stayed by keeping the same in\n*15* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nabeyance.\n\nD) Respondent No. 1 may kindly be directed not to\neffect further promotions on the basis of the\nimpugned Seniority Lists published vide\nCircular dated 31.12.2020 at Exh. 'E'.\n\nE) Any other suitable and equitable relief, to\nwhich the petitioners are entitled to, and this\nHon'ble Court deems fit, may kindly be granted\nin their favour.\"\n\n4. All the Petitioners, including the State of\n\nMaharashtra, expressly canvassed in the open Court that they all\n\nare aggrieved by the impugned Judgment and order dated\n\n26.08.2022, delivered by the Maharashtra Administrative\n\nTribunal (hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal). However, each\n\nof the Petitioner desired that the impugned judgment should be\n\npartly set aside to the extent it is adverse to him/ her and the\n\nparticular portion which is favourable to each of them, should not\n\nbe disturbed. We had granted adjournments to the litigating\n\nparties on at least two occasions, to state whether we should\n\nremand the matters to the Tribunal, for fresh consideration.\n\nHowever, the original Applicants insisted that these Petitions\n\nshould be considered on their merits. Shri Kumbhakoni, learned\n\nSenior Advocate submitted that the whole judgment be set aside\n\nand the matters be remanded to the Tribunal and, since no\n*16* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ninterim relief has been granted by this Court, the State be\n\npermitted to proceed with promotions, notwithstanding the\n\nremanded cases before the Tribunal\n\n5. We have recorded the lengthy submissions of the\n\nlearned advocates. We could not conduct hearing in these matters\n\nin between 08.02.2024 to 02.05.2024 as one of us (Brother\n\nJustice Khobragade) was not available due to medical reasons.\n\nLastly, they have addressed us on 05.07.2024 and additional\n\nwritten notes were tendered on 12.07.2024. It would be apposite\n\nto summarize their submissions, in this judgment.\n\nSubmissions of learned Senior Advocate Shri V.D. Sapkal\n\n6. Shri V.D. Sapkal, has extensively canvassed on\n\nbehalf of Respondent No.10 in Writ Petition No.9163/2022. The\n\nsaid Respondent is the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.9632/2022.\n\nAccording to him, the issue is as regards the dates of seniority for\n\nthe purposes of settling the deemed dates of promotion.\n\n7. Both the Petitioners, namely, Smt.Samiksha\n\nRamakant Chandrakar and Shri Pandurang Ramrao Kulkarni,\n*17* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nwere appointed as Tahasildar on 24.02.1994 and 31.05.1994,\n\nrespectively. Both of them assumed office as Tahasildar on the\n\nsame day, 02.03.1994. Consequentially, both of them completed\n\nfive years as Tahasildar, on 01.03.1999. Both were appointed as\n\nDeputy Collector, on 09.07.1999 and both were then promoted to\n\nthe cadre of Additional Collector, from 30.01.2020.\n\n8. Shri Sapkal has tendered a compilation of\n\ndocuments on behalf of his client, the Petitioner in Writ Petition\n\nNo.9632/2022. The document at Sr.No.1 is the order passed by\n\nthe State Government, on 09.07.1999, for appointing Tahasildars\n\non temporary basis in the cadre of the Deputy Collector. The\n\norder clearly indicates that such Tahasildars are being granted\n\ntemporary promotion in the cadre of Deputy Collector \"Nivval\n\nTatpurtya Swaroopat Padonnati\", (purely on temporary basis).\n\nPetitioner No.1 Smt.Chandrakar is at Sr.No.76 and Petitioner\n\nNo.2 Shri Kulkarni is at Sr.No.81. He then points out the\n\nconcluding remarks in the said order, viz. 'the said temporary\n\npromotion will be subject to the approval of the Maharashtra\n\nPublic Service Commission' (MPSC/Commission). It was\n\nexpressly mentioned that they would not be entitled to any\n*18* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nbenefits and the Divisional Commissioners were directed to\n\napprise such Tahasildars that, 'no requests with regard to such\n\ntemporary promotion and in the nature of any changes that may\n\nbe sought in their Departments', would be entertained by the\n\nGovernment. To be more specific, the directions issued are\n\nreproduced as under:-\n\n\"संबंधित विभागीय आयुक्तांना विनंती करण्यात येते की, पदोत्रती\n\nअधिकान्यांना त्यांच्या नियुक्तीच्या ठिकाणी रुजू होण्यासाठी सध्य\n\nकार्यभारातून तात्काळ कार्यमुक्त करावे.\n\nसंबंधित अधिकान्यांना उपजिल्हाधिकारी पदावर देण्यात आलेली\n\nपदोन्नती ही पूर्ण पणे तात्पुरत्या स्वरूपाची असून शासन व महाराष्ट्र लोकसेवा\n\nआयोगाच्या अंतिम मान्यतेच्या अधीन राहून देण्यात येत आहे या\n\nपदोन्नतीमुळे त्यांना उपजिल्हाधिकारी संवर्गात सेवाजेष्ठता वेतननिश्चिती,\n\nइत्यादीबाबत कोणत्याही प्रकारचे अधिकारी प्रदान होणार नाहीत.\n\nविभागीय आयुक्तांनी पदोन्नत अधिकान्यांना अशीही जाणीव दयावी\n\nकी, ही पदोन्नती तात्पुरती असल्या कारणाने विभाग बदलून देण्यासंबंधीच्या\n\nकिंवा त्यांच्या प्रत्यक्ष नेमणूका विभाग स्तरावर बदल करण्यासंबंधीच्या\n\nत्यांच्या कोणत्याही विनंतीची शासनाकडू न दखल घेतली जाणार नाही.\"\n\n9. Shri Sapkal, therefore, contends that none of these\n\nTahasildars were promoted in consultation of the MPSC and,\n*19* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ntherefore, their temporary promotion would not accrue any right\n\nfor regularization from the deemed dates of promotions. Though\n\nthis issue relates back to 1999, their seniority altered by the\n\nimpugned final seniority list, cannot be faulted.\n\n10. Shri Sapkal then draws our attention to the\n\nGovernment Order dated 30.01.2020, which is with regard to yet\n\nanother temporary promotion granted to these Petitioners. The\n\nsaid order refers to a decision of the Bombay High Court dated\n\n18.12.2019, delivered in Writ Petition No.11368/2019 (\nAjinkya\n\nNatha Padwal and others vs. State of Maharashtra and\n\nothers\n) and connected petitions wherein, this Court had ordered\n\nas under:-\n\n\"(iii) Needless to mention, it is open for the State\nGovernment to take an independent decision\nwhether to make promotions on adhoc basis\npending finalization of seniority list.\"\n\n11. He then draws our attention to the specific words\n\n\"Saksham Pradhikarnachya Mannyatene Tadartha Padonnatya\n\nDenyat Yet Aahet\". His client, namely, Shri Vijaysinha\n\nShankarrao Deshmukh is at Sr.No.1, since he is a directly\n\nappointed Deputy Collector (DDC).

He then draws our attention to clause 4 in the said\n\nGovernment order dated 30.01.2020, which is reproduced as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"4. उप जिल्हाधिकारी (निवडश्रेणी) (गट-अ) या संवर्गातील उक्त\n\nअधिकान्यांना अपर जिल्हाधिकारी (गट-अ) या संवर्गात खालील अटी /\n\nशर्तीच्या अधीन राहून तदर्थ पदोन्नत्या देण्यात येत आहेत. :-\n\n(i) पदोन्नतीसाठी पात्र ठरलेल्या उपरोक्त अधिकाऱ्यांना देण्यात\n\nयेणाऱ्या अपर जिल्हाधिकारी संवर्गातील ह्या तदर्थ स्वरुपाच्या आहेत.\n\n(ii) संदर्भ क्र. २ येथील नमूद सामान्य प्रशासन विभागाच्या\n\nपत्रान्वये प्राप्त अपर जिल्हाधिकारी पदावरील पदोन्नतीची निवड सूची ही उप\n\nजिल्हाधिकारी संवर्गाची दि.०३.०३.२०१८ ची तात्पुरती ज्येष्ठता सूची\n\nविचारात घेऊन तयार करण्यात आली असल्याने सदर पदोन्नत्या तदर्थ\n\nस्वरुपाच्या राहतील व उप जिल्हाधिकारी या निम्न संवर्गाची ज्येष्ठता सूची\n\nअंतिम झाल्यानंतर होणाऱ्या तद्वदनुषंगिक सेवा जेष्ठतेच्या अधिन राहून सदर\n\nअधिकाऱ्यांच्या पदोन्नत्या नियमित करण्यासंदर्भात आदेश निर्गमित करण्यात\n\nयेतील.\n\n*21* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n(iii) सदर निवडसूची व तदर्थ पदोन्नती यास महाराष्ट्र लोकसेवा\n\nआयोगाची मान्यता प्राप्त झाल्यानंतरच पदोन्नतीच्या पदावर सेवाज्येष्ठता व\n\nअन्य सेवाविषयक लाभ मिळण्यास पदोन्नत अधिकारी पात्र राहतील.\n\n(iv) सदर सर्व तदर्थ पदोन्नत्या या अपर जिल्हाधिकारी संवर्गाच्या\n\nवित्त विभागाच्या मान्यतेने मंजूर होणाऱ्या सुधारित आकृतीबंध निश्चितीच्या\n\nअधिन राहतील.\n\n(v) प्रतिनियुक्तीवर कार्यरत असलेले ज्येष्ठ अधिकारी यांचे\n\nप्रत्यावर्तन झाल्यानंतर त्यांच्यासाठी अपर जिल्हाधिकारी या संवर्गात पद\n\nरिक्त नसल्यास या आदेशातील कनिष्ठतम अधिकान्यांना पदावनत\n\nकरण्याच्या अधीन राहून सदर तदर्थ पदोन्नती देण्यात येत आहे.\n\n(vi) मा. सर्वोच्च न्यायालयात प्रलंबित असलेल्या विशेष अनुमती याचिका क्र.\n\n२८३०६/२०१७ मध्ये होणाऱ्या अंतिम निर्णयाच्या अधिन राहून, मा. उच्च\n\nन्यायालय, मुंबई यांनी रिट याचिका क्र. ११३६८/२०१९ व इतर\n\nयाचिकांमध्ये दि. १८ डिसेंबर, २०१९ रोजी दिलेल्या निर्णयानुसार तसेच\n\nसामान्य प्रशासन विभागाने दि. २९ डिसेंबर २०१७ च्या पत्रान्वये दिलेल्या\n\nमार्गदर्शनपर सूचनांनुसार सदरहू तदर्थ पदोन्नत्या देण्यात येत आहेत.\"\n\nHe, therefore, submits that unless the State of\n\nMaharashtra acquires the approval of the Commission, there\n\ncannot be confirmation of an employee on the said promotional\n\npost.\n\n*22* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n13. He, then draws our attention to the Government\n\ncircular, dated 03.03.2018 by which a provisional seniority list\n\nwas declared by the State Government. This was challenged\n\nbefore the Principal Seat in Writ Petition No.11368/2019\n\n(\nAjinkya Natha Padwal and others vs. State of Maharashtra\n\nand others\n) and connected matters. The Division Bench of this\n\nCourt delivered a Judgment on 18.12.2019, more specifically,\n\nparagraph Nos.11 to 18, as under:-\n\n\"11. During the pendency of the O.A. No.916 of\n2016, pursuant to the order dated 25.07.2017\nin Miscellaneous Application No.292 of 2017\nfiled by the State Government, the Tribunal\nallowed the State Government to effect\npromotions in the cadre of Additional Collector\n(Selection Grade) subject to the outcome of the\nO.A. based on provisional seniority list then in\nexistence. The Tribunal passed the order\ndirecting the State Government that the final\nproclamation of the seniority list should not be\nmade without express leave of the Tribunal.\n\n12. On 03.10.2017 the State Government effected\npromotions to the posts of Deputy Collector\n(Selection Grade) and Additional Collector on\nthe basis of the draft final seniority list. Till\n03.10.2017 all promotions were made on the\nbasis of earlier provisional seniority list.\n\n13. The State Government thereafter published a\nfresh provisional seniority list of Deputy\nCollectors on 03.03.2018 for the period\n01.01.1999 to 31.12.2000 and 01.01.2001 to\n31.12.2003. It is the contention of the\n*23* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npromotees that this provisional seniority list of\n3.3.2018 had the effect of pushing down the\npromotee Deputy Collectors below the Direct\nRecruits in the order of seniority. It is\ncontended by promotees that by publishing the\nsaid list the benefit of seniority to the\npromotees from the dates of their actual\npromotions is denied and the quota rule in\nfavour of direct recruits was wrongly applied.\n\n14. The provisional seniority list of 03.03.2018 was\nchallenged by one promotee-Deputy Collector\nby fling O.A. No.308 of 2018. However, O.A.\nNo.308 of 2018 was disposed of by the Tribunal\non 03.09.2018 as challenge to the provisional\nseniority list was premature.\n\n15. On 07.09.2018 one of the promotee (Ajinkya\nNatha Padwal - the petitioner No.1 in Writ\nPetition No.11368 of 2019) filed M.A. No.468\nof 2018 in O.A. No.916 of 2016 seeking interim\norder of stay on promotions on the basis of\nprovisional seniority list dated 03.03.2018. On\n14.09.2018 the Tribunal by its order in M.A.\nNo.468 of 2018 directed the State Government\nnot to issue any order of ad-hoc promotions\nunless the seniority list is finalised without\nexpress leave of the Tribunal.\n\n16. Thereafter, the State Government filed M.A.\nNo.429 of 2019 seeking leave of the Tribunal to\neffect promotions from the cadre of Deputy\nCollector to the grade of Deputy Collector\n(Selection Grade) purely by way of temporary\narrangement, subject to further orders and on\nthe terms and conditions that may be imposed\nby the Tribunal. By order dated 13.08.2019 the\nTribunal permitted the State Government to\nissue ad-hoc promotions to the post of Deputy\nCollector (Selection Grade) \"for the purpose\nstated in the M.A.\". Though it is recorded in the\norder that the promotees consented to such\norder being passed, according to the\npromotees, said concession was erroneously\n*24* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nrecorded. It is the contention of the promotees\nthat the application was made for speaking to\nthe minutes but the same has not been disposed\nof .\n\n17. Thereafter, on 14.08.2019 the State\nGovernment issued promotion orders.\n\nAccording to the promotees the dates of\npromotion of 48 promotee Deputy Collectors in\nthe Selection Grade were illegally altered. By\nsecond order dated 14.08.2019, 40 Direct\nRecruits are granted ad-hoc promotions as\nDeputy Collectors (Selection Grade)\nretrospectively from various dates beginning\nfrom 31.05.2011.\n\n18. Sometime after 14/8/2019 the Direct Recruits\napplied to the Tribunal for withdrawal of O.A.\nNo.916 of 2016. While allowing the application\nfor withdrawal by impugned order dated\n29/8/2019 the Tribunal recorded that the State\nGovernment had already promoted 48 Officers\nfrom the provisional seniority list published on\n03.03.2018 of Deputy Collector (Selection\nGrade) by an order dated 14.08.2019. The\nTribunal further permitted the State\nGovernment to promote 57 Officers who are\neligible, suitable and in the zone of\nconsideration.\"\n\n14. He submits that after considering the submissions on\n\nbehalf of the promotees, which are reproduced in paragraph 20,\n\nthe submissions on behalf of the direct recruits (DDC) and the\n\nsubmissions on behalf of the State Government, were recorded in\n\nparagraph 21 and 22. The conclusions of the Court are found in\n\nparagraphs 23 to 29 and the operative part, which read thus:-\n\n*25* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n\"23. This is an inter se seniority dispute between\nDirect Recruit Deputy Collectors and promotee\nDeputy Collectors. The provisional seniority\nlist was published in 2009 and thereafter in\n2014. Ad-hoc promotions were made on the\nbasis of these provisional seniority lists. The\nprovisional seniority lists of 2009 and 2014 are\nprepared by granting seniority to the promotees\nfrom the date of promotion by taking into\nconsideration the length of continuous service\nin the cadre. Ad-hoc promotions in the grade of\nDeputy Collectors and the post of Additional\nCollectors also came to be made on the basis of\nprovisional seniority lists of 2009 and 2014. It\nis the grievance of the Direct Recruits that the\nprovisional seniority lists are not prepared in\naccordance with the Rules of 1977. According\nto the Direct Recruits, Rules of 1977 provides\nfor 35% quota for Direct Recruits which is not\nadhered to. The promotees were promoted as\nagainst the quota meant for Direct Recruits.\nThe Direct Recruits contend that the promotees\nhave misconstrued the decision of the Tribunal\nin O.A. No. 526 of 2004 as the Tribunal\nnowhere indicates that quota meant for Direct\nRecruits should not be followed while\npublishing the combined seniority list.\n\n24. The Direct Recruits approached the Tribunal by\nfling O.A. No.916 of 2016 for direction that the\nseniority list of Deputy Collectors should be\nfinalised. It is their contention that since 2009\nthe State Government is only publishing the\nprovisional seniority list and effecting\npromotions on ad-hoc basis. Even during the\npendency of the O.A., the Tribunal granted\nleave to the State Government to effect\npromotions and/or the State Government\neffected promotions on ad-hoc basis as per the\nprovisional seniority list of 2014.\n\n25. It is when the State Government published the\nprovisional seniority list on 03.03.2018 that the\n*26* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npromotees were pushed down in the provisional\nseniority list. When the question of further\npromotions arose, the Direct Recruits who now\nwere placed higher in the seniority list of\n3/3/2018 are considered by the State\nGovernment for promotion on ad-hoc basis.\nAccordingly, 48 Officers were promoted from\nthe provisional seniority list of 03.03.2018 as\nDeputy Collector (Selection Grade) by an order\nissued on 14.08.2019. The State Government\nalso wanted to promote 57 officers from the list\nof Deputy Collector (Selection Grade) as\nAdditional Collector in view of the\nadministrative exigency purely on temporary\nbasis. The State Government sought leave of\nthe Tribunal to issue orders promoting them.\nPending this application of the State\nGovernment, the Direct Recruits made an\napplication for withdrawing the O.A. In our\nopinion, the Tribunal should have simply\npermitted the Direct Recruits to withdraw the\nO.A. In the O.A. filed by the Direct Recruits\nclaiming the relief directing the State\nGovernment to prepare the final seniority list,\nthe Tribunal has committed an error in\npermitting the State Government to promote 57\nofficers as Additional Collectors. The\napplication made by the State Government\nseeking leave to promote 57 officers would not\nsurvive for consideration upon withdrawal of\nthe O.A. filed by direct recruits.\n\n26. There is no serious challenge by any of the\nparties to the direction issued by the Tribunal\nto finalise the seniority list. In any case,\nlearned Senior Counsel Shri Apte has made a\nstatement that the State Government would\nfinalise the seniority list by end of January,\n2020 after taking into considering the\nrepresentations and objections of all\nconcerned. Learned Senior Counsel Shri Apte\nhas further clearly indicated that the\n*27* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npromotions which have been made during\npendency of O.A.916 of 2016 are purely on ad-\nhoc basis and the same are subject to final\nseniority list. In view of this submission, the\napprehension of the promotees, that Direct\nRecruits who are promoted on ad-hoc basis in\nterms of the provisional seniority list of 3 rd\nMarch, 2018 would claim equities and assert\ntheir rights on the basis of such ad-hoc\npromotions is misplaced and unfounded.\n\n27. It is further submission of learned Senior\nCounsel Shri Apte that even if the order of the\nTribunal is sustained, no prejudice will be\ncaused to any one, as most of the promotees\nincluding the direct recruits who are parties to\nthese Petitions are likely to get promotions on\nadhoc basis. These promotions will obviously\nbe subject to final seniority list. According to\nlearned Senior Counsel Shri Apte only some of\nthe petitioners who are represented by learned\nSenior Counsel Shri Setalwad are likely to be\ndeprived of the benefit of ad-hoc promotion as\nthey are not in the zone of consideration for\npromotion in terms of the provisional seniority\nlist of 3rd March, 2018.\n\n28. Taking an over all view of the matter, we refrain\nfrom addressing on the larger issue raised by\nlearned Senior Counsel for the petitioners that\nthe direct recruits should not be allowed to\ncontinue to take advantage of the interim\norders in their favour once they have\nwithdrawn the O.A.. Suffice it to observe that\neven on the previous occasions, the ad-hoc\npromotions were made on the basis of the\nprovisional seniority list of 2009 and those of\n2014 which by and large benefited the\npromotees. The provisional seniority list of 3rd\nMarch, 2018 ensures to the benefit of direct\nrecruits. Even the State Government has taken\na specific stand that the final seniority list\nwould be published by the end of January,\n*28* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n2020. In this view of the matter, we do not find\nthis is to be a ft case to interfere with the ad-\nhoc promotions already made on the basis of\nthe provisional seniority list of 3rd March, 2018\nwhich even according to Shri Apte are purely\non ad-hoc basis subject to final seniority list. It\nis therefore clear that the said promotions are\npurely on ad-hoc basis subject to the final\nseniority list to be prepared by the State\nGovernment by the end of January, 2020.\n\n29. We are however of the opinion that Clause (6)\nof the impugned order of the Tribunal which\npermits the State Government to promote 57\nofficers calls for interference. According to us,\non a motion made by the direct recruits for\nwithdrawal of the O.A., the Tribunal should not\nhave permitted the State Government to\npromote 57 direct recruits, more so, when the\nO.A. was at the instance of the direct recruits\nessentially for the relief of finalising the\nseniority list. On a motion made by the direct\nrecruits for withdrawal of the O.A., the\nquestion of considering any pending\napplication and that too of the State\nGovernment was uncalled for. The other reason\nwhy we are inclined to interfere with clause (6)\nof the impugned order passed by the Tribunal is\nthat by issuing this direction the promotees are\ndeprived of an opportunity to test the\ncorrectness of the ad-hoc promotions if made\nby the State Government before the Tribunal.\nWe therefore quash and set aside Clause (6) of\nthe impugned order passed by the Tribunal. We\nmay however hasten to add that considering the\nexigency of the administration, it is for the\nState Government to independently consider\nthe question of effecting ad-hoc promotions\npending finalisation of seniority list which will\nafford a fair opportunity to the aggrieved to test\nthe decision before the Tribunal on grounds\nlegally permissible. Hence the following order.\n\n*29* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nORDER\n(i) Clause (6) of the impugned order dated 29th\n\nAugust, 2019 passed by the Tribunal in O.A.\nNo. 916 of 2016 and O.A. No. 1099 of 2016 is\nquashed and set aside.\n\n(ii) The statement made by learned Senior Counsel\nShri Apte on instructions that the State would\nfinalise the seniority list by the end of January,\n2020 after considering the representations and\nobjections to the provisional seniority list dated\n3rd March, 2018, is accepted.\n\n(iii) Needless to mention, it is open for the State\nGovernment to take an independent decision\nwhether to make promotions on ad-hoc basis\npending finalisation of seniority list.\n\n(iv) Writ Petitions are partly allowed.\"\n\n15. He draws our attention to an Original Application\n\nNo.763/2003 (\nJotiba Tukaram Patil and others vs. The State\n\nof Maharashtra and others\n), preferred by the promotees before\n\nthe Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (Tribunal) wherein, a\n\njudgment was delivered on 09.01.2004, in which, the Tribunal\n\nconcluded as under:-\n\n\"The respondent No.1 is directed to finalise the\nseniority list of Deputy Collectors determining\nthe inter-se seniority among promotee Deputy\nCollectors and directly recruited Deputy\nCollectors on the basis of the relevant rules and\nthe direction given by High Court in W.P. No.\n4548 of 1983 and also after deciding the\nobjections raised by the applicants to the\nprovisional seniority list within a period of six\nmonths from today. The respondent No.1,\n*30* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nhowever, is at liberty to make selection for\npromotion on the basis of the provisional\nseniority list subject to condition that\npromotions given on the basis of such selection\nshall be subject to the inter-se gradation in the\nfinal seniority list. O.A. is disposed of\naccordingly. No order as to costs.\"\n\n16. Two Miscellaneous Applications bearing Nos.188\n\nand 215 of 2004 (\nThe State of Maharashtra vs. J.T. Patil and\n\nothers\n), were preferred before the Tribunal and the operative part\n\nof the earlier order dated 09.01.2004, was modified by arriving at\n\nthe following conclusions in paragraphs 8 to 10:-\n\n\"8) We find that the applicants, in their petition,\nrelied upon the decision in W.P. No. 4548/1983\nin order to make a point regarding the date of\nseniority in respect of direct recruits to be\ncounted from the date of then actual taking\nover charge. It is true that the judgment passed\nin the said W.P. contains direction to prepare\ngradation list by determining the seniority of\nthe promotee Dy. Collectors with effect from the\ndate of their continuous officiation and in\nrespect of direct recruits from the date of then\nactual taking over charge. But as pointed out\nby the learned Chief Presenting Officer the said\ndirection is applicable only to the seniority list\nof the Dy. Collectors recruited against the\nvacancies during the period 1972-1975 when\nthe Maharashtra Dy. Collectors (Recruitment,\nFixation of Seniority and Confirmation) Rules\n1977 were not framed. It is not the case of the\noriginal applicants that they were recruited\nduring that specific period. Hence the principle\n\nlaid down in\nthe judgment passed in the said\n*31* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nW.P.No. 4548/83 shall not be applicable to\nthem. The Maharashtra Dy. Collectors\n(Recruitment, Fixation of Seniority and\nConfirmation) Rules 1977 specifically provide\nthe manner in which the inter-se seniority\nbetween promotee and direct recruit Dy.\n\nCollectors to be determined. Hence we find that\nthe reference to the judgment passed in W.P.No.\n4548/83 in the operative part of the order\npassed by this Tribunal in O.A. No. 763 of 2003\nis not relevant as far as determination of\nseniority of the original applicants is\nconcerned. The order dated 9.1.2004 passed by\nthis Division Bench of the Tribunal in the said\nO.A. therefore needs to be modified.\n\n9) By filing M.A.No. 215 of 2004, the applicant\n(Original respondent State Govt.) has prayed\nfor grant of additional six months time for\nfinalizing the seniority list of Dy. Collectors.\nConsidering the facts and circumstances,\ndiscussed above in respect of M.A. No. 188 of\n2004, we of opinion that the request needs to be\ngranted.\n\n10) We therefore pass the following order.\n\nORDER\n\n1. Both these miscellaneous applications are\nallowed.\n\n2. The operative part of the order dated 9.1.2004\nin O.A. No. 763 of 2003 is modified and shall\nread as follows:\n\n\"The respondent no. 1 is directed to finalize the\nseniority list of Dy. Collectors determining the\ninter-se seniority among promotee Dy.\nCollectors and direct recruit Dy. Collectors on\nthe basis of relevant rules and also after\ndeciding the objections raised by the applicants\nto the provisional seniority list within a period\nof six months from today. The respondent no. 1,\nhowever is at liberty to make selection for\npromotion on the basis of the provisional\nseniority list subject to condition that\n*32* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npromotions given on the basis of such selection\nshall be subject to the inter-se gradation in the\nfinal seniority list. O.A. is disposed of\naccordingly. No order as to costs\".\n\n3. Additional time of six months is granted to the\napplicant from today for implementing the\norder dated 9.1.2004, passed in O.A. No. 763 of\n2003.\n\n4. No order as to costs.\"\n\n17. The above orders were challenged in Writ Petition\n\nNo.7851/2004 (\nJotiba T. Patil and others vs. The State of\n\nMaharashtra and others\n), (Civil Appellate Jurisdiction,\n\nMumbai) and this Court delivered the judgment on 14.06.2018,\n\nwherein, it was concluded in paragraphs 23 to 27 as under:-\n\n\"23] In fact, it is quite clear that the judgment of this\ncourt in Writ Petition No. 4548 of 1983 was in\nthe context of appointees between 1972 to 1975\nwhen there were no statutory rules for\ndetermination of interse seniority. This court,\ntherefore, applying the principles\nlaid down in\n\nS.B. Patwardhan (supra) formulated the\nprinciples to be applied in the meantime. After\nthe 1983 Rules entered into force therefore,\nthere was no question of once again falling\nback upon the principles in Writ Petition No.\n4548 of 1983.\n\n24] Significantly, it is not even the case of the\npetitioners that they are appointees between\n1972 and 1975 or that 1983 Rules do not apply\nto the determination of their seniority.\nTherefore, we see no merit in the attack on\norder dated 23.6.2004 based upon the\nrestrictive parameters of review jurisdiction or\n*33* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\neven otherwise on merits.\n\n25] As noted earlier, all that the impugned\njudgments and orders had directed was the\nfinalisation of the provisional seniority list in\naccordance with law and after taking into\nconsideration the objections of the petitioners.\nNow that the seniority list has already been\nfinalised and such finalised seniority list is not\nunder challenge, we see no good ground to\ninterfere with the impugned judgments and\norders.\n\n26] Since the finalised seniority list is not under\nchallenge, we are not in a position to know\nwhether such finalised seniority list is\nconsistent with the rules as well as the law laid\ndown by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\ndecisions upon which reliance is placed by\nMr.Rajadhyaksha. Suffice to note that there is\nno inconsistency between the directions issued\nby the MAT in the impugned judgments and\norders and the decisions upon which reliance is\nplaced by Mr. Rajadhyaksha. This is because as\nnoted repeatedly, the impugned judgments and\norders had merely directed the State to finalise\nthe seniority list in accordance with law and\nafter taking the petitioners objections.\n27] For all the aforesaid reasons, we dismiss this\npetition. Rule is discharged. There shall be no\norder as to costs.\"\n\n18. Shri Sapkal, therefore, contends that the seniority of\n\nthe directly appointed Deputy Collectors (DDC/ direct\n\nappointees), will be from the dates of their entry in such direct\n\nappointment. Per contra, for the promotees (PDC), it will be from\n\nthe dates of their regular promotion and not from the dates when\n*34* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthey were granted adhoc promotions, since the Maharashtra\n\nDeputy Collector (Recruitment, Fixation of Seniority and\n\nConfirmation) Rules, 1977, framed under\nArticle 309 (Rules of\n\n1977 or the 1977 Rules)\n, were not adhered to. Their promotions\n\nwill relate to their dates of actual entry as Deputy Collectors and\n\nnot as adhoc Deputy Collectors.\n\n19.\nIn support of this submission, he relies upon a\n\njudgment delivered by the Honourable Supreme Court, on\n\n28.09.2021, in\nMalook Singh and others vs. State of Punjab\n\nand others\n, (three Judges Bench), Civil Appeal Nos.6026-\n\n6028/2021, [(2021) 7 SCR 1080 : 2021 SCC Online SC 876] .\n\nHe contends that this judgment crystallizes the law that adhoc\n\nservice cannot be counted for conferring the benefits of seniority\n\non such an employee. He specifically draws our attention to the\n\nobservation of the Honourable Supreme Court in paragraph\n\nNo.20, which reads thus:-\n\n\"20. The law on the issue of whether the period of\nad hoc service can be counted for the purpose\nof determining seniority has been settled by this\nCourt in multiple cases. In Direct Recruits\n(supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court has\nobserved:\n\n\"13. When the cases were taken up for\n*35* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nhearing before us, it was faintly suggested that\nthe principle laid down in Patwardhan case\n[(1977) 3 SCC 399: 1977 SCC (L&S) 391:\n(1977) 3 SCR 775] was unsound and fit to be\noverruled, but no attempt was made to\nsubstantiate the plea. We were taken through\nthe judgment by the learned counsel for the\nparties more than once and we are in complete\nagreement with the ratio decidendi, that the\nperiod of continuous officiation by a\ngovernment servant, after his appointment by\nfollowing the rules applicable for substantive\nappointments, has to be taken into account for\ndetermining his seniority; and seniority cannot\nbe determined on the sole test of confirmation,\nfor, as was pointed out, confirmation is one of\nthe inglorious uncertainties of government\nservice depending neither on efficiency of the\nincumbent nor on the availability of substantive\nvacancies. The principle for deciding inter se\nseniority has to conform to the principles of\nequality spelt out by\nArticles 14\nand\n16.\nIf an\nappointment is made by way of stop-gap\narrangement, without considering the claims of\nall the eligible available persons and without\nfollowing the rules of appointment, the\nexperience on such appointment cannot be\nequated with the experience of a regular\nappointee, because of the qualitative difference\nin the appointment. To equate the two would be\nto treat two unequals as equal which would\nviolate the equality clause. But if the\nappointment is made after considering the\nclaims of all eligible candidates and the\nappointee continues in the post uninterruptedly\ntill the regularization of his service in\naccordance with the rules made for regular\nsubstantive appointments, there is no reason to\nexclude the officiating service for purpose of\nseniority. Same will be the position if the initial\nappointment itself is made in accordance with\n*36* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe rules applicable to substantive\nappointments as in the present case. To hold\notherwise will be discriminatory and\narbitrary.....\n\n47. To sum up, we hold that\n(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post\naccording to a rule, his seniority has to counted\nfrom the date of appointment and not according\nto date of his confirmation. The corollary to the\nabove rule is that where the initial appointment\nis only ad hoc and not according to rules and\nmade as a stop-gap arrangement, the\nofficiation in such post cannot be taken into\naccount considering the seniority.\"\n\nThe decision in Direct Recruits (supra) stands\nfor the principle that ad hoc service cannot be\ncounted for determining the seniority if the\ninitial appointment has been made as a stop\ngap arrangement and not according to rules.\nThe reliance placed by the Single Judge in the\njudgement dated 6 December 1991 on Direct\nRecruits (supra) to hold that the ad hoc service\nshould be counted for conferring the benefit of\nseniority in the present case is clearly\nmisplaced.\nThis principle laid down in Direct\nRecruits (supra) was subsequently followed by\nthis Court in\nKeshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of\nIndia\n.\n\nRecently a two judge Bench of this Court\nin\nRashi Mani Mishra v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n,\nof which one of us (Justice DY Chandrachud)\nwas a part, observed that the services rendered\nby ad hoc employees prior to their\nregularization cannot be counted for the\npurpose of seniority while interpreting the\nUttar Pradesh Regularization of Ad Hoc\nAppointment Rules. This Court noted that\nunder the applicable Rules, \"substantive\nappointment\" does not include ad hoc\nappointment and thus seniority which has to be\ncounted from \"substantive appointment\" would\n*37* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nnot include ad hoc service.\nThis Court also\nclarified that the judgement in Direct Recruits\n(supra) cannot be relied upon to confer the\nbenefit of seniority based on ad hoc service\nsince it clearly states that ad hoc appointments\nmade as stop gap arrangements do not render\nthe ad hoc service eligible for determining\nseniority. This Court speaking through Justice\nMR Shah made the following observations:\n\n\"36. The sum and substance of the above\ndiscussion would be that on a fair reading of\nthe 1979 Rules, extended from time to time;\ninitial appointment orders in the year 1985 and\nthe subsequent order of regularization in the\nyear 1989 of the ad hoc appointees and on a\nfair reading of the relevant Service Rules,\nnamely Service Rules, 1993 and the Seniority\nRules, 1991, our conclusion would be that the\nservices rendered by the ad hoc appointees\nprior to their regularization as per the 1979\nRules shall not be counted for the purpose of\nseniority, vis-à-vis, the direct recruits who were\nappointed prior to 1989 and they are not\nentitled to seniority from the date of their initial\nappointment in the year 1985. The resultant\neffect would be that the subsequent re-\ndetermination of the seniority in the year 2016\ncannot be sustained which was considering the\nservices rendered by ad hoc appointees prior to\n1989, i.e., from the date of their initial\nappointment in 1985. This cannot be sustained\nand the same deserves to be quashed and set\naside and the seniority list of 2001 counting the\nservices rendered by ad hoc appointees from\nthe date of their regularization in the year 1989\nis to be restored.\n\n37. Now so far as the reliance placed\nupon the decision of this Court in the case of\nDirect Recruit Class II Engg. Officers' Assn.\n(supra), relied upon by the learned Senior\nAdvocate appearing on behalf of the ad hoc\n*38* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nappointees is concerned, it is required to be\nnoted that even in the said decision also, it is\nobserved and held that where initial\nappointment was made only ad hoc as a stop\ngap arrangement and not according to the\nrules, the officiation in such post cannot be\ntaken into account for considering the seniority.\n\nIn the case before this Court, the appointments\nwere made to a post according to rule but as ad\nhoc and subsequently they were confirmed and\nto that this Court observed and held that where\nappointments made in accordance with the\nrules, seniority is to be counted from the date of\nsuch appointment and not from the date of\nconfirmation. In the present case, it is not the\ncase of confirmation of the service of ad hoc\nappointees in the year 1989. In the year 1989,\ntheir services are regularized after following\ndue procedure as required under the 1979\nRules and after their names were recommended\nby the Selection Committee constituted under\nthe 1979 Rules. As observed hereinabove, the\nappointments in the year 1989 after their\nnames were recommended by the Selection\nCommittee constituted as per the 1979 Rules\ncan be said to be the \"substantive\nappointments\". Therefore, even on facts also,\nthe decision in the case of Direct Recruit Class\nII Engg. Officers' Assn. (supra) shall not be\napplicable to the facts of the case on hand. At\nthe cost of repetition, it is observed that the\ndecision of this Court in the case of Direct\nRecruit Class II Engg. Officers' Assn. (supra)\nwas considered by this Court in the case of\nSantosh Kumar (supra) when this Court\ninterpreted the very 1979 Rules.\"\n\nThe notification dated 3 May 1977 stated that\nthe ad hoc appointments were made in\nadministrative interest in anticipation of\nregular appointments and on account of delay\n*39* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthat takes place in making regular appointment\nthrough the concerned agencies. In this regard,\nthe vacancies were notified to the Employment\nExchange or advertisements were issued, as the\ncase maybe, by appointing authorities. The\nappointments were not made on the\nrecommendation of the Punjab Subordinate\nService Selection Board. However,\nsubsequently a policy decision was made to\nregularize the ad hoc appointees since their\nouster after a considerable period of service\nwould have entailed hardship. Thus, the initial\nappointment was supposed to be a stop gap\narrangement, besides being not in accordance\nwith the rules, and the ad hoc service cannot be\ncounted for the purpose of seniority.\"\n\n20. Shri Sapkal has then drawn our attention to Rule\n\n2(b), 2(e), 2(i), 2(n), Rule 4, Rule 5, Rules 8 to 10, Rule 12 and\n\nRule 13 of the Maharashtra Deputy Collectors (Recruitment,\n\nFixation of Seniority and Confirmation) Rules, 1977, which are\n\nas under:-\n\n\"2. Definitions. In these rules, unless the context\notherwise requires,-\n\n\"(b) \"Commission\" means the Maharashtra Public\nService Commission;\"\n\n\"(e) \"deemed date\" has the meaning assigned to it\nin rules 7 and 13;\"\n\n\"(i) \"fortuitous service\" means that service which is\nrendered by a person during the period\ncommencing on the date of his actual\ncontinuous officiation in a cadre and ending on\nthe deemed date of continuous officiation in\nthat cadre (such deemed date being later than\n*40* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe date of the actual continuous officiation of\nsuch person in the said cadre);\"\n\n\"(n) \"select list\" means the initial list of officers who\nare fit to be appointed as Tahsildars or, as the\ncase may be of Tahsildars who are fit to be\nappointed as Deputy Collectors, in the order of\nseniority assigned to them in such respective\nlist (each such list being drawn up by\nGovernment in consultation with the\nCommission).\"\n\n\"4. Mode of recruitment to post of Deputy\nCollector.-\n\n(1) Appointment to the post of Deputy Collector\nmay be made either by nomination in the\nmanner provided by rule 5 or by promotion of\nTahsildars as provided by rule 10 or by transfer\non deputation of officers holding the posts of\nUnder Secretary to Government:\n\nProvided that the appointment by nomination\nshall be made in such manner as to ensure that\nthe total number of directly recruited Deputy\nCollectors in the cadre of Deputy Collectors\nshall not, at any time, be less than 35 per cent,\nand not more than 50 per cent of the total\nnumber of permanent posts in that cadre.\n(2) For the purpose of complying with the proviso\nto sub-rule (1) Government shall determine in\nadvance the number of nominations to be made\nin each year.\"\n\n\"5. Manner of appointment by nomination.-\n(1) Appointment by nomination shall be made upon\nthe result of a competitive examination to be\nheld by the Commission in accordance with the\nrules made by Government in that behalf.\n(2) To be eligible for appearing at any such\nexamination, a candidate,-\n\n(a) shall hold a degree of a statutory University\nor a qualification recognised by Government as\nequivalent thereto;\n\n*41* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n(b) shall have adequate knowledge of Marathi\nfor the purpose of reading, writing and\nspeaking fluently, in that language;\n\n(c) shall not be less than 19 years and more\nthan 28 years) of age on 1st day of April of the\nyear following the year in which the posts are\nadvertised by the Commission:\"\n\n\"8. Preparation of combined seniority list of\nTahsildars:-\n\n(1) In each year, in accordance with the seniority\nof all the Tahsildars determined under sub-rule\n(6) of rule 7, a combined provisional seniority\nlist of Tahsildars serving in all the revenue\nDivisions in the State (hereinafter referred to as\n\"the provisional seniority list of Tahsildars\")\nwho have put in continuous service of five years\nor more, shall be prepared by Government in\nForm I showing their inter-se seniority as on\nthe 1st day of April of that year.\n\n(2) After the preparation of such seniority list\nunder sub-rule (1), a copy thereof shall be kept\nby Government for inspection in the office of\nevery Commissioner and of every Collector by\nthe persons interested therein. Government\nshall also issue a press note announcing that\ncopies of the provisional seniority list of\nTahsildar have been kept for inspection as\naforesaid and calling upon persons concerned\nto submit to the Commissioner of the Division\nconcerned, any objections or suggestions if any,\nto such list within a period of sixty days from\nthe date of the press note.\n\n(3) Every Commissioner shall forward the\nsuggestions and objections, if any received by\nhim under sub-rule (2) to Government with his\nremarks within fifteen days from the last day of\nthe period specified in the press note for\nsubmission of objections and suggestions.\n(4) Government shall, after considering the\nsuggestions and objections and the remarks of\n*42* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nall the Commissioners, prepare the final\nseniority list of Tahsildars.\n\n(5) A copy of such final seniority list of Tahsildars\nshall be kept by Government in the office of\nevery Commissioner and of every Collector for\ninformation of the persons interested therein.\n\nGovernment shall also issue a press note\nannouncing that copies of the final seniority list\nof Tahsildars have been kept as aforesaid.\"\n\n\"9. Constitution of Selection Committee and\npreparation of select list of Tahsildars:-\n\n(1) For the purpose of preparing a select list of\nTahsildar, Government shall constitute a\nSelection Committee consisting of-\n\n(1) Secretary, Revenue and Forests\nDepartment of Government or where there are\ntwo or more Secretaries in that Department,\none of them nominated by Government.\n\n...Chairman\n(2) Secretary (Personal) in the General\nAdministration Department of Government.\n\n...Member\n(3) Two Revenue Commissioners nominated\nby Government (one of them shall be belonging\nto Backward Classes, if available).\n\n...Members\n(4) Deputy Secretary in-charge of the subject\nin the Revenue and Forests Department.\n\n...Member/ Secretary\n\n(2) The Committee shall meet in the month of\nSeptember or as soon as possible thereafter\nevery year; and subject to the provisions of\nsub-rule (5), prepare a select list as provided in\nthis rule of Tahsildars fit to be promoted to the\ncadre of Deputy Collectors.\n\n(3) The Committee shall consider the cases of all\nTahsildars including,-\n\n(i) those whose names are already included\nin the select list prepared earlier but orders\n*43* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nregarding whose promotion to cadre of Deputy\nCollectors have not been issued till the date of\nthe meeting,\n\n(ii) those who, after being provisionally\npromoted to the cadre of Deputy Collectors,\nhave been reverted as Tahsildars, and\n\n(iii) those whose names are included in the\nfinal seniority list of Tahsildars prepared under\nsub-rule (4) of rule 8 in the order in which their\nnames appear in that list.\n\n(4) The number of Tahsildars to be included in the\nselect list shall be, as nearly as may be, equal\nto the vacancies in the cadre of Deputy\nCollectors which are likely to arise during the\nnext twelve months (i.e. from 1st September to\n31st August).\n\n(5) The Committee shall take into consideration all\nconfidential reports about the officer in the\ncadre of Tahsildars and then assess the merit of\nthat officer.\n\n(6) Those officers who are considered to possess\noutstanding merit, exceptional ability or\npositive merit and have achieved tangible result\nand show promise of being able to discharge\nefficiently the duties and responsibilities of a\nDeputy Collector shall alone be ranked\namongst the first 25 per cent of the total\nnumber of officers to be included in the select\nlist. The officer to be ranked thereafter shall be\nselected from amongst those who are\nconsidered fit for the post of a Deputy\nCollector.\n\n(7) The select list drawn up by the Committee shall\nbe submitted to Government together with all\nthe relevant material including the confidential\nreports about the officers concerned.\n\nGovernment shall, thereafter, in consultation\nwith the Commission, determine the final select\nlist of Tahsildars fit to be promoted as Deputy\nCollectors.\"\n\n*44* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n\"10. Provisional promotion to Deputy Collector's\ncadre:-\n\n(1) The Tahsildars whose names are included in the\nfinal select list determined by Government\nunder sub-rule (7) of rule 9 shall be\nprovisionally promoted to a post in the cadre of\nDeputy Collectors in the order of their ranking\nin that list as and when vacancies occur in that\ncadre:\n\nProvided that, where such final select list is\nexhausted and the exigencies of administration\nrequire the vacancies in that cadre to be filled\nup immediately, Government may, purely as a\nstop gap arrangement, appoint,-\n\n(i) where the fresh select list is yet to be\nprepared, Tahsildars included in the final\nseniority list of Tahsildars prepared under rule\n8 in the order of their seniority in that list and\nwho are considered fit by it for promotion to the\ncadre of Deputy Collectors after considering\nup-to-date confidential reports about them,\n\n(ii) where the Committee has drawn up a\nselect list but Government has not determined\nthe final select list in consultation with the\nCommission as provided in sub-rule (7) of rule\n9, the Tahsildars included in the select list\ndrawn by the Committee in the order of their\nranking in that list.\n\n(2) The appointment made as a stop-gap\narrangement under the proviso to sub-rule (1)\nshall be deemed to be a regular provisional\nappointment under sub-rule (1) when the\nofficer in question is included in the final select\nlist determined by Government under sub-rule\n(7) of rule 9. Where the officer appointed as a\nstop-gap arrangement under the proviso to sub-\nrule (1) is not included in such final select list,\nhe shall be reverted immediately after such\nfinal select list is determined by Government\nunder sub-rule (7) of rule 9.\n\n(3) The promotion under sub-rule (1) or under sub-\n\n*45* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nrule (2) shall continue to be provisional until\nthe officer has been considered fit to be\ncontinued in the cadre of Deputy Collectors in\nthe review made under rule 12:\n\nProvided that it shall be competent to\nGovernment to revert any Deputy Collector\neven before the completion of the review under\nrule 12 if his work is considered unsatisfactory\nor for any other reason considered sufficient by\nGovernment for such reversion; and in such\ncases, the Commission shall be consulted\nwithin six months of the reversion.\"\n\n\"12. Review of Duty Collectors promoted\nprovisionally:-\n\n(1) Whenever the Selection Committee constituted\nunder rule 9 meets as required by sub-rule (2)\nof that rule, it shall also consider the cases of\nthe officers who have been provisionally\npromoted as Deputy Collectors under rule 10\nand have so officiated for a continuous period\nof not less than three years for determining\nwhether they are fit to be continued in the cadre\nof Deputy Collectors.\n\n(2) The Committed shall, after considering the\nconfidential reports of the officers for the\nperiod during which the officers had officiated\nin the cadre of Deputy Collectors prepare a list\nof officers who are fit to be continued in the\nDeputy Collectors' cadre and also a list of\nofficers who are not so fit.\n\n(3) The two lists drawn up by the Committee under\nsub-rule (2) shall be submitted to Government\ntogether with all the relevant material\nincluding all the confidential reports about the\nofficers concerned. Government will, therefore,\nin consultation with the Commission, finalise\nthe two lists.\n\n(4) The officers who are not found fit for\ncontinuing in the cadre of Deputy Collectors\n*46* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nshall be reverted immediately, and their names\nremoved from the select list determined by\nGovernment under sub-rule (7) of rule 9.\"\n\n\"13. Principles according to which seniority of\nDeputy Collectors shall be determined:-\n\n(1) The seniority inter-se of the promoted Deputy\nCollectors shall be in the same order in which\ntheir names appear in the final select list\ndetermined by Government under sub-rule (7)\nof rule 9:\n\nProvided that the seniority of the promoted\nDeputy Collectors appointed as a stop- gap\narrangement under the proviso to sub-rule (1)\nof rule 10, shall be deemed to be provisional till\nhis appointment becomes regular under sub-\nrule (2) of that rule.\n\n(2) Where the dates of continuous service of the\npromoted Deputy Collectors in the cadre of\nDeputy Collectors are not chronologically in\nconformity with their inter-se seniority as\nprovided in sub-rule (1) due to the seniority of\nany Deputy Collector being revised subsequent\nto his promotion as Deputy Collector in order\nto remove an injustice done to him in fixing his\nseniority in the cadre of Deputy Collectors or\nTahsildars or, as the case may be, Awal\nKarkuns. or Naib Tahsildars, or for rectifying\nan error made in the fixation of such seniority.\n\nthe dates of continuous service as Deputy\nCollectors shall be assigned to the promoted\nDeputy Collectors in such manner as to be\nchronologically in conformity with their order\nof seniority (that is to say, the senior officer will\nhave the earlier date of continuous service than\nhis junior in the seniority list). The dates so\nassigned shall be called the deemed dates\" of\ncontinuous service in the Deputy Collectors'\ncadre, and shall be taken into consideration for\nthe purpose of this rule.\n\n(3) The inter-se seniority of the directly recruited\n*47* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nDeputy Collectors, selected in one batch by the\nCommission shall be determined in accordance\nwith the order of preference recommended for\nthem by the Commission irrespective of the\ndates of their joining the cadre of Deputy\nCollectors, subject to the condition that they\njoin the cadre within one month of their\nappointment order or, where an extension of the\nperiod for joining the cadre is sanctioned by\nGovernment, within such extended period; and\nif they join such cadre after the expiry of the\nperiod of one month or as the case may be, of\nthe extended period, then such seniority shall\nbe determined according to the dates of their\njoining the cadre.\n\n(4) Where the dates of appointment of directly\nrecruited Deputy Collectors are not\nchronologically in conformity with their inter-\nse seniority as provided in sub-rule (3), such\ndates shall be assigned to them in such manner\nas to be chronologically in conformity with\ntheir order of seniority. The dates so assigned\nshall be called \"the deemed dates\" of\nappointment on probation of the directly\nrecruited Deputy Collectors and shall be taken\ninto consideration for the purposes of this rule.\n(5) After having determined the seniority of\npromoted Deputy Collectors and directly\nrecruited Deputy Collectors in the manner\nprovided in sub-rules (2), (3), (4) and (5),\nGovernment shall determine the seniority of all\nthe Deputy Collectors according to the date of\ncontinuous service in the cadre cf Deputy\nCollectors or, as the case may be, according to\nthe deemed dates assigned to them under sub-\nrule (2) or sub-rule (4):\n\nProvided that,\n\n(a) any service rendered in a fortuitous\nappointment shall be excluded,\n\n(b) where the dates of continuous service or,\nas the case may be, of joining the cadre of\n*48* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nDeputy Collectors of any two or more officers\nare identical, the officer senior in age shall be\nconsidered as senior for the purpose of\ndetermining such seniority.\"\n\n21. He then contends that, under Rule 8, the 01 st day of\n\nApril of a particular year is the cut off date for completion of five\n\nyears by a Tahasildar. Under Rule 9(1), the selection committee\n\nis to be constituted by the Government. The committee has to\n\nmeet in the month of September of each year or as soon as\n\npossible thereafter, thereby mandating the committee to fulfill\n\nthis requirement prior to 31st December of each year, considering\n\nthe specific language set out in sub-rule (2). Rule 3 provides for\n\ncases of the Tahasildars to be considered in view of sub clauses\n\n(i) to (iii). Even those Tahasildars, who were provisionally\n\npromoted to the cadre of the Deputy Collectors and have been\n\nreverted and those whose names are included in the final\n\nseniority list of Tahasildars prepared under Rule 8(4) in the order\n\nin which their names appear in that list, can be considered to be\n\nfit for promotion.\n\n22. He, therefore, contends that the two Petitioners\n\nSmt.Chandrakar and Shri Kulkarni, could not have been\n*49* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nappointed as Deputy Collectors on 09.07.1999, since they\n\ncompleted five years as Tahasildars on 01.03.1999 and the\n\ncommittee could not have convened a meeting to consider their\n\ncases prior to September of 1999, under Rule 9(2). So also, under\n\nRule 9(4), the probable vacancies which are likely to arise during\n\nthe next twelve months i.e. from 1st September of that year to 31st\n\nAugust of the next year, are also to be considered. This could not\n\nhave been done as in July,1999.\n\n23. He, then, submits that Rule 9(7) provides for\n\nsubmitting the select list drawn by the committee, to the\n\nGovernment along with relevant material. The Government is\n\nduty bound by a mandate, in view of the word \"shall\", to consult\n\nthe Commission and determine the final select list of Tahasildars\n\nfit to be promoted as Deputy Collectors. Under Rule 10(1), the\n\nTahasildars whose names are included in the final select list\n\ndetermined under Rule 9(7), are to be provisionally promoted to\n\na post in the cadre of Deputy Collector in the order of their\n\nranking in that list, as and when the vacancies occurred.\n\n24. He then draws our attention to the proviso below\n*50* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nRule 10(1), which permits the Government to appoint the Deputy\n\nCollectors purely as a stop-gap arrangement, if the final select\n\nlist is exhausted and the exigencies of administration require the\n\nvacancies in that cadre to be filled up immediately. He, therefore,\n\nrelies specifically on Rule 10(2) and contends that the\n\nappointment made as a stop-gap arrangement under the proviso\n\nto sub rule (1) of Rule 10, shall be deemed to be a regular\n\nprovisional appointment under sub-rule (1), only when the\n\nofficer in question is included in the final select list determined\n\nby the Government under Rule 9(7). When the officer appointed\n\nas a stop gap arrangement is not included in the final select list,\n\nhe has to be reverted immediately after such final select list is\n\ndetermined by the Government under Rule 9(7). He then draws\n\nour attention to Rule 10(3) by which, the promotion under sub-\n\nrule (1) or (2), would continue to be provisional until the officer\n\nis considered fit to be continued in the cadre of Deputy\n\nCollectors, in the review made under Rule 12.\n\n25. He then refers to Rule 12 which pertains to review\n\nof PDC who are promoted provisionally. Sub rule (1) mandates\n\nthe selection committee to consider cases of officers who have\n*51* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nbeen provisionally promoted as Deputy Collectors under Rule 10\n\nand have officiated for a continuous period of not less than three\n\nyears for determining whether they are fit to be continued in the\n\ncadre of Deputy Collectors. Sub rule (2) mandates the\n\nCommittee to prepare one list of officers provisionally appointed\n\nas Deputy Collectors, who are fit to be continued in the Deputy\n\nCollector's cadre and also prepare a second list of officers, who\n\nare not so fit. Sub-rule (3) mandates the committee to present\n\ntwo lists to the Government, together with all the relevant\n\nmaterial. The Government, thereafter, would consult the\n\nCommission and finalize the two lists. Under sub-rule (4),\n\nofficers who are not found fit for continuing in the cadre of\n\nDeputy Collectors, are to be reverted immediately and their\n\nnames are to be removed from the select list prepared under Rule\n\n9(7).\n\n26. Rule 13(1) mandates that the seniority inter-se the\n\npromoted Deputy Collectors, shall be in the same order in which\n\ntheir names appear in the final select list determined by the\n\nGovernment under Rule 9(7). The proviso below sub-rule (1)\n\nindicates that the seniority of the promoted Deputy Collectors,\n*52* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nappointed as a stop-gap arrangement under the proviso below\n\nRule 10(1), shall be deemed to be provisional till the\n\nappointment becomes regular under Rule 10(2).\n\n27. Shri Sapkal specifically submits in relation to the\n\ncases in hand, that there was no consultation by the Government\n\nwith the Commission as mandated under Rule 9(7). Therefore,\n\nthere is no final select list prepared by the Government. He\n\npoints out that the Government has admitted this fact before the\n\nTribunal and even before this Court.\n\n28. The learned Advocate Shri Katneshwarkar,\n\nrepresenting the Government, when called upon, submits that the\n\nGovernment has admitted this aspect and there was no\n\nconsultation by the Government with the Commission under\n\nRule 9(7), before finalizing the list. Shri Sapkal, therefore,\n\nreiterates that the adhoc appointment of these two Petitioners\n\nSmt.Chandrakar and Shri Kulkarni, w.e.f. 09.07.1999, as Deputy\n\nCollectors, is not as per the approved list under Rule 9(7) and\n\nsuch adhoc promotions are in violation of Rule 9(2) and 9(4).\n\n*53* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n29. Shri Sapkal has referred to the impugned judgment\n\ndelivered by the Tribunal, dated 26.08.2022. Primarily, he has\n\ncontended that, both the learned members of the Bench have\n\ntaken 'almost contradictory' views. Though the learned Member\n\n(Administrative) has signed the portion of the judgment (86\n\npages), authored by the learned Member (Judicial), he has added\n\nhis observations, analysis and conclusions (11 pages), which are\n\ncontrary to the view taken by the learned Member (Judicial).\n\n30. He has referred to the text of the portion authored by\n\nthe learned Member (Administrative), which we are referring to,\n\n(in brief), as follows:-\n\n(a) In paragraph 1, it is noted that all the parties are\n\nunited/ in agreement on the aspect of the applicability of the\n\n1977 Rules.\n\n(b) In paragraph 2, he has referred to the conclusion that\n\nthe Applicants before the Tribunal had entered the cadre of\n\nDeputy Collectors as \"promotee Deputy Collectors\" (PDC).\n\nThey have claimed seniority in the cadre of Deputy Collectors as\n\nper their dates of appointments.\n\n(c) The directly appointed Deputy Collectors (DDC)\n*54* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nhave contended that the initial appointment of the Applicants has\n\nbeen on adhoc basis and fortuitous in nature and under the 1977\n\nRules in the light of the judgment of the Honourable Supreme\n\nCourt, they are fit to be reverted to their parent cadre of\n\nTahasildars.\n\n(d) The State Authorities admitted that the initial\n\nappointment of the Applicants had not been strictly in accordance\n\nwith the 1977 Rules and that a sincere effort was made through\n\nthe process of preparation and publication of the combined\n\nseniority list of officers in the cadre of Deputy Collectors for the\n\nperiod 01.01.1999 to 31.12.2003, by assigning the DDC their due\n\nseniority position and at the same time, regularizing the adhoc\n\nand fortuitous services rendered by the Promotee Deputy\n\nCollectors (PDC).\n\n(e) The issue of locus-standi of the Applicants has been\n\nraised in explicit terms by the Respondents individuals (not the\n\nState Authorities) and it is necessary to examine the said issue\n\nbefore going to the merits of the case.\n\n(f) Admittedly, the Applicants have not placed on\n\nrecord a copy of the \"final combined seniority list\" for the cadre\n\nof Tahasildars, which was prepared and published by the\n*55* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nRespondent Authorities as per Rule 8(4) and 8(5) for the\n\npurposes of drawing a select list of Tahasildars for promotion to\n\nthe post of Deputy Collectors, by the Selection Committee\n\nconstituted under Rule 9(1). So also, the Applicants have not\n\nplaced on record the \"final select list\" prepared by the\n\nGovernment under Rule 9(7), though the Applicants claim that\n\ntheir names were included in such a list. The State of\n\nMaharashtra has not taken a clear stand. This last sentence is\n\nagainst the record since the State Government has filed an\n\naffidavit before the Tribunal stating therein that such a \"final\n\ncombined seniority list\" and the \"final select list\", was never\n\nprepared by the Government.\n\n(g) An inference can be drawn that the names of the\n\nApplicants were not eligible for inclusion in the final combined\n\nseniority list prepared under Rule 8(4), for placing the same for\n\nconsideration of the selection committee for their promotions to\n\nthe cadre of Deputy Collectors. The individual Respondents had\n\nasserted that the Applicants had not completed a minimum of\n\nfive years of service in the cadre of Tahasildars at the time of the\n\npreparation of the combined seniority list.\n\n(h) There is no evidence to show that the names of the\n*56* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nApplicants in both the proceedings, were eligible to be\n\nincorporated in the said final select list prepared under Rule 9(7).\n\nIt was contended by the individual Respondents that Rule 9(7)\n\nwas not complied with by Respondent No.1 and which is\n\nadmitted in it's Written Statement.\n\n(i) In the specific view of the learned Member\n\n(Administrative), that the seniority inter-se the PDC, could not be\n\nan issue which could be raised by the DDC. However, a DDC\n\ncannot be excluded from raising objections in respect of\n\ninclusion of the names of the PDC in the final combined\n\nseniority list as per Rule 8(4), on the ground that such a PDC did\n\nnot meet the eligibility criteria under Rule 8(1). The names of\n\nonly such Tahasildars could be considered for inclusion in the\n\nselect list prepared under Rule 9(7), if they are eligible to be\n\nincluded in the final combined seniority list prepared under Rule\n\n8(4).\n\n(j) The learned Member (Administrative) cast issue\n\nNo.1 as \"Whether the Applicants in TA-1 and TA-2 were qualified\n\nto be included in the State level final combined seniority list of\n\nTahasildars as per the provisions of Rule 8(1) of the Rules of\n\n1977?\"\n\n*57* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nWhile answering the said issue, it was concluded\n\nthat the meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee\n\n(DPC) cannot be construed to mean that the Selection Committee\n\nconstituted under Rule 9(1) is deemed to have convened a\n\nmeeting and the meeting of the Selection Committee has to be\n\nheld in the manner prescribed under the 1977 Rules.\n\n(k) Issue No.3 (there is no issue No.2 in the order) reads\n\nas \"Whether the names of the Applicants in TA-1 and TA-2 had\n\nbeen included in the select list of Tahasildars as per provisions of\n\nRule 9 of the Rules of 1977?\"\n\nThis issue was answered by concluding that the\n\nnames of these four Applicants had not been included in the\n\nselect list of Tahasildars, if any, as per Rule 9(3)(iii), since their\n\nnames did not appear in the final combined seniority list of\n\nTahasildars which has to be prepared under Rule 8(4). Therefore,\n\nit was concluded that the four Applicants do not have the locus-\n\nstandi to contest the Transfer Applications.\n\n(l) Issue No.4 reads as \"Whether the appointment of the\n\nApplicants listed in TA-1 and TA-2 can be classified as a stop-\n\ngap arrangement as per provisions of Rule 10(1) of the Rules of\n\n1977?\"\n\n*58* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nThis was answered by concluding that the provisos\n\n(i) and (ii), to Rule 10(1), provide for filling up the vacancies in\n\nthe cadre of Deputy Collectors purely as a stop-gap arrangement.\n\nHowever, proviso (i) indicates that only an officer in the cadre of\n\nTahasildar whose name has been included in the combined final\n\nseniority list prepared under Rule 8(4), could be appointed as a\n\nDeputy Collector on a stop-gap basis. It was concluded that the\n\nApplicants were not eligible for appointment even on stop-gap\n\nbasis on the post of Deputy Collector under proviso (i) of Rule\n\n10.\n\n(m) Issue No.5 reads as \"Whether the names of\n\nApplicants included in select list by approval of Government with\n\nprior consultation with MPSC as per provisions of Rule 9(7) of\n\nthe Rules of 1977?\"\n\nIt was concluded that no select list was prepared\n\nunder Rule 9(7), which mandates consultation with the MPSC.\n\n(n) Issue No.6 reads as \"Whether review of services of\n\nthe Applicants in TA-1 and TA-2 had been duly carried out as per\n\nprovisions of Rule 12 of the Rules of 1977?\"\n\nIt was concluded that there was no review of\n\nservices of the Applicants as was required to be carried out as per\n*59* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nRule 12.\n\n(o) Issue No.7 reads as \"How the seniority of Applicants\n\nin TA-1 and TA-2 is to be determined under provisions of Rule 13\n\nof the Rules of 1977?\"\n\nIt was concluded that the impugned seniority list\n\nprepared and published by the State, was not in accordance with\n\nthe relevant provisions under the 1977 Rules. A combined\n\nseniority list of DDC and PDC cannot be prepared in accordance\n\nwith Rule 13, without following the due procedure for\n\nregularization of the recruitment of the Applicants and similarly\n\nsituated other PDC. In the absence of any provision in this regard\n\nin the Rules of 1977, the case law may be referred to which\n\npermits regularization of recruitment which is irregular ab-initio.\n\n(p) Issue No.8 reads as \"As the Applicants in TA-1 and\n\nTA-2 have continued in cadre of Deputy Collectors for\n\ncontinuous period of 20 to 22 years, how does inaction on part of\n\nRespondent No.1 and 2 to take action as per relevant rules under\n\nthe Rules of 1977 affect the right of the Applicants to claim and\n\nget seniority w.e.f. their respective dates of appointments in the\n\ncadre of Deputy Collectors vis-a-vis the seniority of direct recruit\n\nDeputy Collectors?\"\n\n*60* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nIt was concluded that though the Rules mandate that\n\nthe Applicants need to be reverted back to the cadre of\n\nTahasildar, this may amount to turning the clock backwards\n\nwhich may lead to multiple administrative complications. On the\n\nother hand, conceding to the demands of the Applicants to grant\n\nthem seniority w.e.f. their date of joining the cadre of Deputy\n\nCollectors, may amount to injustice to the DDC. Regularization\n\nof the PDC in the combined seniority list seems to be the only\n\noption which has been apparently accepted by most of the PDC,\n\nexcept these four Applicants who stand on a weak ground of\n\nlocus-standi.\n\n(q) Issue No.9 reads as \"Whether the exact number of\n\nposts in the cadre of Deputy Collectors is material to decide the\n\nclaims of four Applicants?\"\n\nIt was concluded that the four Applicants do not\n\nhave the locus standi and, therefore, the total number of posts in\n\nthe cadre of Deputy Collectors may not be material for deciding\n\nthe Applications filed by the Applicants. However, the\n\nRespondents may, in order to be fair to all the officers in the said\n\ncadre, re-confirm the data depicted in the matrix enclosed along\n\nwith the circular issued by the Government, Revenue and Forest\n*61* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nDepartment bearing No.SNT-22/97/E-1A-Mantralay dated\n\n31.12.2020, with special reference to creation of posts of the\n\nDeputy Collectors and it's total number along with the break-up\n\nof temporary and permanent posts.\n\n(r) While concluding in a long paragraph, the learned\n\nMember (Administrative) has, finally, held that:-\n\n\"On one hand, we have recorded\nunambiguous finding that the method which has\nbeen adopted and applied by the respondent no.1\nwhile determining the impugned seniority list is,\nstrictly speaking, not in precise conformity with\nthe provisions under \"the Rules of 1977\". On the\nother hand, we also observe that prima facie, the\napplicants do not seem to have locus-standi in the\npresent matter. The argument put forth by the\nlearned Special Counsel for private respondent\nthat the applicants having been promoted in\nviolation of rules need to be reverted back to their\nparent cadre of Tahasildars, can be said to be\nadministratively impractical in view of the fact of\nlong service rendered by the applicants. These\ntwo sides of the matter put up in a dilemma as to\nhow a legally valid, workable resolution to the\nproblem can be worked out without letting the\nmatter to stale further. From above analysis, it is\nalso inferred by me that the issue of seniority\nposition of the original applicants cannot be\ndecided by the provisions of the Recruitment\nRules, 1977 and passing an order in the present\nmatters requires superior learning and ability to\nanalyze the judgments delivered by Hon'ble High\nCourts and Hon'ble Apex Court touching upon\nsimilar aspects of service matters. Therefore, after\nputting my views on record as above for\nconsideration, I may prefer to concur with\n*62* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\noperative part of the order passed by Hon'ble\nJustice P.R. Bora, the Vice Chairman.\"\n\n31. The learned Senior Advocate Shri Sapkal submits\n\nthat though the learned Member (Judicial) and the learned\n\nMember (Administrative), have concurred as regards the fact that\n\nthe select list was not in accordance with the Rules and there was\n\nno consultation with the Commission, the learned Member\n\n(Judicial) has held that the said fact could be termed as an\n\nirregularity. Per contra, the learned Member (Administrative) has\n\nconcluded that if there is no final combined seniority list and the\n\nselect list, as is required by law, the PDC will have to suffer the\n\nconsequences. On the issue of the manner in which the PDC\n\nshould now be dealt with, the learned Member (Judicial) has\n\nconcluded that they cannot be made to suffer the consequences.\n\nHe has directed to delete the remark \"fortuitous service\", against\n\nthe PDC who are at Sr.Nos.582 to 700. Per contra, the learned\n\nMember (Administrative) has concluded that these PDC cannot\n\nbe in the seniority positions and, therefore, being in a dilemma,\n\nhe would prefer to concur with the learned Member (Judicial).\n\nShri Sapkal, therefore, submits that though both the Members of\n*63* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe Bench are unanimous as regards the illegality in the final\n\nseniority list and the select list, both have taken a divergent view.\n\n32. In paragraph 23 of his judgment, the learned\n\nMember (Judicial) has held that the DPC was convened on\n\n15.04.1999 and the promotion orders are issued in the month of\n\nJuly, 1999. To this extent, there is reason to believe that there is\n\nsome deviation from the Recruitment Rules. The said minor\n\ncontravention has to be treated as an irregularity and it would be\n\nunjust and unfair to treat the appointments by way of promotion\n\ngranted to the four Applicants as being illegal, after a period of\n\n20 years.\n\n33. In paragraph 26, it is held that a reasonable\n\ninference can be drawn that the inclusion of these Applicants in\n\nthe select list in the cadre of Deputy Collectors, cannot be held to\n\nbe illegal. Though a review meeting under Rule 12 is not held,\n\nthe State has taken a conscious decision that the review meeting\n\nis deemed to have been convened as these four Applicants were\n\ncontinued as PDC, admittedly without a review meeting.\n\n*64* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n34. In paragraph 29, it is held as under:-\n\n\"29. It is true that sub-rule 9 of Rule 7 provides for\nconsultation with MPSC while determining the\nseniority list drawn up by the committee of the\nTahsildars fit to be promoted as Deputy\nCollectors. It is also true that there is nothing\non record to show that the MPSC was consulted\nby the State before determining the final select\nlist of Tahsildars under sub-rule 7 of Rule 9.\nHowever, question arises whether such\nobjection assumes any value and significance\nafter the period of more than 20 years of the\nalleged action. According to us, the delay\ncaused has rendered the objection raised on\nbehalf of private respondents redundant.\nMoreover, as has been held by Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the case of\nState of U.P. vs.\nManbodhan Lal Shrivastava\n(cited supra)\nabsence of consultation with MPSC can be\ntreated as irregularity and not illegality.\n\nThe\nsaid irregularity can be cured as held by\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nAjay\nKumar Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n(cited\nsupra) through prospective consultation. The\npromotions granted in favour of the applicants\nand inclusion of their names in the select list\ndetermined under Rule 9(7), therefore cannot\nbe negated on the ground of 'non-consultation'\nwith MPSC.\"\n\n35. The learned Member (Judicial) has relied upon an\n\nearlier view taken by the Tribunal vide judgment dated\n\n17.04.2008, in O.A. No.526/2004, from paragraph Nos.31 to 41\n\nwherein, the Tribunal concluded in paragraph 41 that \"There is\n*65* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nno difficulty for us to hold that cadre includes both permanent\n\nand temporary posts.\"\n\n36. In paragraph 49, it is held that \"In addition to\n\npermanent posts of 514, definitely some temporary posts were\n\nthere in existence meaning thereby, that cadre strength at the\n\nrelevant time was more than 514 and the Applicants in both these\n\nApplications were part of the cadre of Deputy Collectors.\" In\n\nparagraph 50, he concludes that \"... Though in the said orders, it\n\nhas been stated that the promotions so granted are purely\n\ntemporary and further that the applicants may not be entitled to\n\nclaim any benefit on the basis of the said temporary promotion\n\nlike seniority etc., it is nowhere mentioned in the said order\n\nunder which provision of the Recruitment Rules such promotions\n\nwere given. It is not mentioned in the said orders that the\n\npromotions granted in favour of the applicants are by way of\n\nstop-gap arrangement or on adhoc basis.\"\n\n37. In paragraph 52, it is held as under:-\n\n\"52. We have reproduced the proviso to Sub-rule (1)\nof Rule 10 hereinbefore. We have also noted in\nwhat circumstances the promotions can be\n*66* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ngranted by the Government under the said\nprovision. In the affidavit in reply submitted on\nbehalf of respondent no. 1 it is not its case that\nat the time when the applicants and other 94\nofficers in the cadre of Tahsildars were\npromoted to the post of Deputy Collector, there\nwas any administrative exigency. Respondent\nno. 1 has also not provided any such\ninformation or has raised any such plea that at\nthe time when the applicants were promoted, the\nfinal select list prepared under Sub-rule 7 of\nRule 9 was already exhausted. It is also not\ndisclosed by respondent No. 1 whether\nadministrative exigency was of the nature that\nthe vacancies in the cadre of Deputy Collectors\nwere to be filled up immediately. Respondent\nNo. 1 has further not provided any information\nwhether names of the applicants for promoting\nthem to the post of Deputy Collector under the\nsaid provision were required to be taken from\nthe final select list of the Tahsildars prepared\nunder Rule 8. It is also not stated by respondent\nNo. 1 whether the names of the applicants were\nselected from the select list which was awaiting\nits determination under Sub-rule 7 of Rule 9 by\nthe Government. It is undisputed that once\npromoted to the post of Deputy Collector, the\napplicants did not suffer reversion to any lower\ncadre and they have been discharging their\nduties uninterruptedly on the promoted post of\nDeputy Collector.\"\n\n38. Shri Sapkal submits that the learned Member\n\n(Judicial) has erred in concluding in paragraph 53 that the PDCs\n\nare not covered by Rule 10(1), which provides for temporary\n\npromotions as a stop-gap arrangement. He held that Respondent\n*67* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nNo.1/State does not take a stand that these PDCs are covered by\n\nRule 10(1). According to Shri Sapkal, this view is contrary to the\n\nview taken by the Bombay High Court in the case of one of these\n\nApplicants, namely, Smt.Samiksha Ramakant Chandrakar, who\n\nhad preferred Writ Petition No.11367/2019. He points out the\n\njudgment dated 18.12.2019, more specifically paragraph Nos.25,\n\n26, 27, 28 and 29 (operative part), reproduced above.\n\n39. He then submits that the learned Member (Judicial)\n\nhas given a cursory glance to a directly applicable judgment\n\ndelivered by the Honourable Supreme Court in\nMalook Singh\n\n(supra) and has brushed aside the\nratio\nlaid down in\n\nthe said\n\njudgment\nby holding that it would not apply to the facts of the\n\ncase. Similarly, three judgments of the Supreme Court, viz.\n\n(\ni)\n\nUnion of India and another vs. Prof. S.K. Sharma\n,\nAIR 1992\n\nSC 1188, (ii) Excise Commissioner, Karnataka and another\n\nvs. V. Sreekanta\n, AIR 1993 SC 1564 and (iii) P.K. Singh vs.\n\nBool Chand Chablani and others, AIR 1999 SC 1478, have\n\nbeen brushed aside with a passing remark that \"It may not be\n\nnecessary to elaborately discuss each of the said judgment, for\n\nthe reason that in all these judgments the principle laid down is\n*68* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nsame that the 'services rendered on adhoc basis cannot be\n\nconsidered for the purpose of reckoning seniority'.\" He,\n\ntherefore, submits that the conclusions drawn in paragraph 58,\n\nthat it is not established that the initial appointment of the four\n\nApplicants was not in accordance with the Rules of Recruitment,\n\nis a perverse finding. After having concluded that Rule 9(7) of\n\nthe Rules has been violated, it cannot be held that there is no\n\nillegality in the promotions of the PDC. This is apparently a\n\nperverse conclusion.\n\n40. Shri Sapkal has expressed astonishment that though\n\nthe Tribunal has concluded that the four Applicants have no locus\n\nstandi to file the Applications and the said Applications need not\n\nbe entertained, it has effectively granted relief and directions,\n\nwithout quashing the final seniority list dated 31.12.2020. Once\n\nthe Tribunal concludes that the Applicants had no locus standi to\n\nassail the impugned notification, it was not necessary for the\n\nTribunal to deal with the merits of the claims of these four\n\nApplicants.\n\n*69* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nSubmissions of the learned Senior Advocate Shri Apte\n\n41. Shri Apte, the learned Senior Advocate has appeared\n\nas a Special Counsel for the State of Maharashtra. He submits\n\nthat the dispute is regarding the seniority inter-se the DDC and\n\nPDC. Rule 4 provides for a quota. The DDC should not be less\n\nthan 35% and more than 50% in the cadre of Deputy Collectors.\n\nThe PDC, subject to the compliance of the Rules insofar as\n\nfinalization of the seniority and the select list, should not exceed\n\n65% and should not be less than 50%. The adhoc promotion\n\norders resulted in the PDC exceeding 65%. Such excess in quota\n\nis to be termed as \"fortuitous\" appointment. It is also called as a\n\nstop-gap appointment.\n\n42. Shri Apte has relied upon\nKeshav Chandra Joshi\n\nand others vs. Union of India and others\n, 1992 Suppl. (1)\n\nSCC 272, more particularly paragraph Nos.18 to 28 and 34\n\nwhich read as under:-\n\n\"18. A close reading of the fasciculus of rules clearly\nposits that recruitment as Assistant Conservator\nof Forest shall be from two sources, namely, by\ndirect recruitment and by promotion of permanent\nForest Rangers of the Subordinate Forest Service.\nQualifications have been provided for\nrecruitment. The direct recruit, on selection by the\nPublic Service Commission is required to undergo\ntraining for two years in the college as a part of\n*70* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe selection and on obtaining diploma, the\nGovernor is to appoint him to the substantive post\nof Assistant Conservator of Forest on probation.\nThe service of the direct recruits is to be counted\nfrom the date of discharging the duties of the post\nand on successful completion of the probation\nwithin two years or extended period and passing\nthe tests and on confirmation thereof by the\nGovernor, he becomes a member of the service in\nsubstantive capacity. Similarly the promotees\nshall be recruited in accordance with Rule 5(b)\nand the procedure prescribed in Appendix 'B'. The\nChief Conservator of Forest would draw up the\nlist of permanent Forest Range Officers eligible\nfor promotion strictly on the basis of merit. The\nCommittee headed by the member of the Public\nService Commission would interview them and\nprepare the list of the selected candidates on the\nbasis of merit and ability, which would be\nforwarded to the government. On receipt thereof\nthe Governor would appoint the Forest Range\nOfficers as Assistant Conservator of Forest on\nprobation in terms of the ratio prescribed in Rule\n\n6. The selection shall be based on merit and\nability. The seniority of Forest Rangers inter se is\nto be considered only where the merit and ability\nas Forest Rangers are approximately equal. Thus\neven the juniormost meritorious Forest Range\nOfficer would steal a march over his seniors and\nwould earn his seniority as Assistant Conservator\nof Forest. The promotee shall also be on\nprobation for a period of two years and shall also\nhave to pass the prescribed tests unless exempted.\nOn successful completion and the Governor after\nsatisfying himself that the appointee is also\notherwise fit to be confirmed, makes an order.\nThen only the promotee becomes a regular\nmember of the service in a substantive capacity.\n\n19. The heart of the controversy lies in the question as\nto when a person is appointed to a post in the\n*71* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nservice in a substantive capacity within the\nmeaning of Rule 3(h) read with Rules 5 and 24 of\nthe Rules. Under Rule 5 read with Rule 3(h) a\nmember of the service means a person, be it direct\nrecruit under Rule 5(a) or promotee under Rule\n5(b), appointed in a substantive capacity to the\nservice as per the provisions of the rules. In order\nto become a member of the service he/they must\nsatisfy two conditions, namely, the appointment\nmust be in substantive capacity and the\nappointment has to be to the post in the service\naccording to rules and within the quota to a\nsubstantive vacancy. There exists marked\ndistinction between appointment in a substantive\ncapacity and appointment to the substantive post.\nTherefore, the membership to the service must be\npreceded by an order of appointment to the post\nvalidly made by the Governor. Then only he/they\nbecome member/members of the service. Any\nother construction would be violation of the\nRules.\n\n20. The narrative of facts and attendant\ncircumstances would indicate that the\nGovernment at no point of time abandoned direct\nrecruitment under Rule 5(a), nor omitted to fix\ninter se seniority. No blame in this regard should\nlie at the doors of the government as due to\nrecourse to judicial process this situation crept\nup. It is not the case of the promotees that\nGovernment held out any promise that the\npromotees would be regularised from the\nrespective dates of promotion. On the other hand\nthe government's positive act of adjusting the\npromotees in excess of the quota under Rule 6 in\nthe vacancies that arose in the succeeding years\nbelie such a situation.\n\n21. From the above background two questions would\nemerge: (i) as to when promotees become\nmembers of the cadre of Assistant Conservators in\n*72* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\na substantive capacity in accordance with the\nrules, and (ii) whether the entire length of service\nfrom the date of initial appointments should be\ncounted towards their seniority. The prerequisite\nof the right to inclusion in a common list of\nseniority is that all those who claim that right\nmust broadly bear the same characteristics.\nFortuitous circumstances of their holding the\ngrade post carrying the same designation or scale\nof pay or discharging the same duty would not\njustify the conclusion that they belong to the same\ncadre. Due to exigencies of service temporary\npromotions against substantive vacancies were\nmade. It is undoubted that preceding their\npromotion, an ad hoc committee had considered\nthe cases of the promotees. Admittedly seniority\nsubject to rejection of unfit was the criteria,\nfollowed in the selection. The selection was,\ntherefore, in defiance of and de hors Rule 5(b)\nread with Appendix 'B'.\n\n22. In a democracy governed by rule of law, it is\nnecessary for the appropriate governance of the\ncountry that the political executive should have\nthe support of an efficient bureaucracy. Our\nConstitution enjoins upon the executive and\ncharges the legislature to lay down the policy of\nadministration in the light of the directive\nprinciples. The executive should implement them\nto establish the contemplated egalitarian social\norder envisaged in the preamble of the\nConstitution.\n\n23. It is seen that the appointments of the promotees\nwere made in batches yearwise. The rule\npostulates that appointment shall be strictly as\nper merit after interview arranged in order by the\nPublic Service Commission. In the same year\nwhen the appointments are made to the\nsubstantive vacancies from both the sources, the\npromotees shall rank senior to the direct recruits\n*73* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nin accordance with the quota prescribed under\nRule 6. The rules provide the power to appoint\nForest Rangers from Subordinate Service, due to\nadministrative exigencies to officiate or to act\ntemporarily as Assistant Conservators of Forest.\nThe rule itself, thus, recognises the distinction\nbetween substantive appointment and\ntemporary/officiating appointment. The procedure\nto prepare the list to man the officiating or\ntemporary vacancies is on the basis of seniority\nsubject to rejection of the unfit. The question of\nconsidering relative merit and ability of the\npromotees inter se, then would not arise. Thereby,\nit is clear that the list prepared by the Chief\nConservator of Forest for appointment of the\nForest Rangers to officiate in the posts of\nAssistant Conservator of Forest on ad hoc or\ntemporary basis is only fortuitous due to non-\navailability of the direct recruits as stop gap\narrangement. Employees appointed purely on ad\nhoc or officiating basis due to administrative\nexigencies, even though continued for a long\nspell, do not become the members of the service\nunless the Governor appoints them in accordance\nwith the rules and so they are not entitled to count\nthe entire length of their continuous officiating or\nfortuitous service towards their seniority.\n\n24. It is notorious that confirmation of an employee in\na substantive post would take place long years\nafter the retirement. An employee is entitled to be\nconsidered for promotion on regular basis to a\nhigher post if he/she is an approved probationer\nin the substantive lower post. An officer appointed\nby promotion in accordance with Rules and within\nquota and on declaration of probation is entitled\nto reckon his seniority from the date of promotion\nand the entire length of service, though initially\ntemporary, shall be counted for seniority. Ad hoc\nor fortuitous appointments on a temporary or stop\ngap basis cannot be taken into account for the\n*74* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npurpose of seniority, even if the appointee was\nsubsequently qualified to hold the post on a\nregular basis. To give benefit of such service\nwould be contrary to equality enshrined in\nArticle\nread with\nArticle 16(1)\nof the Constitution as\nunequals would be treated as equals. When\npromotion is outside the quota, the seniority\nwould be reckoned from the date of the vacancy\nwithin the quota, rendering the previous service\nfortuitous. The previous promotion would be\nregular only from the date of the vacancy within\nthe quota and seniority shall be counted from that\ndate and not from the date of his earlier\npromotion or subsequent confirmation. In order to\ndo justice to the promotees it would not be proper\nto do injustice to the direct recruits. The rule of\nquota being a statutory one it must be strictly\nimplemented and it is impermissible for the\nauthorities concerned to deviate from the rule due\nto administrative exigencies or expediency. The\nresult of pushing down the promotees appointed in\nexcess of the quota may work out hardship but it\nis unavoidable and any construction otherwise\nwould be illegal, nullifying the force of statutory\nrules and would offend\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1).\n\nTherefore, the rules must be carefully applied in\nsuch a manner as not to violate the rules or\nequality assured under\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution. This Court interpreted that equity is\nan integral part of\nArticle 14.\nSo every attempt\nwould be made to minimise, as far as possible,\ninequity. Disparity is inherent in the system of\nworking out integration of the employees drawn\nfrom different sources, who have legitimate\naspiration to reach higher echelons of service. A\nfeeling of hardship to one, or heart burning to\neither would be avoided. At the same time equality\nis accorded to all the employees.\n\n25. In Direct Recruits case the Constitution Bench of\nthis Court in which one of us (K. Ramaswamy, J.)\n*75* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nwas a member, in Propositions 'A' and 'B' in\nparagraph 47 at page 475 stated:\n\n\"(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a\npost according to rule, his seniority has to be\ncounted from the date of his appointment and not\naccording to the date of his confirmation. The\ncorollary of the above rule is that where the initial\nappointment is only ad hoc and not according to\nrules and made as stop gap arrangement, the\nofficiation in such post cannot be taken into\naccount for considering the seniority.\n\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by\nfollowing the procedure laid down by the rules but\nthe appointee continues in the post\nuninterruptedly till the regularisation of his\nservice in accordance with the rules, the period of\nofficiating service will be counted.\"\n\nMr Mukhoty and Mr Garg repeatedly asked us to\napply the ratio in the cases of Narender Chadha',\nBaleshwar Dass' and Chauhan contending that\nthe promotees were appointed to the same post;\nare discharging the same duties; drawing the\nsame salary, therefore, they should be deemed to\nbe given promotion from their initial dates of\nappointment, We express our inability to travel\nbeyond the ratio in Direct Recruits case. While\nreiterating insistence upon adherence to the rule\nthat seniority between direct recruits and the\npromotees has to be from the respective dates of\nappointment, this Court noticed that in certain\ncases, government by deliberate disregard of the\nrules promotions were made and allowed the\npromotees to continue for well over 15 to 20 years\nwithout reversion and thereafter seniority is\nsought to be fixed from the date of ad hoc\nappointment. In order to obviate unjust and\ninequitious results, this Court was constrained to\nevolve \"rule of deemed relaxation of the relevant\nrules\" and directed to regularise the services\n*76* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ngiving the entire length of temporary service from\nthe date of initial appointment for seniority. To lay\ndown binding precedent the cases were referred to\na Constitution Bench. In the Direct Recruits case,\nthis Court has laid down clear propositions of\ngeneral application in Items A to K. Therefore, to\nkeep the law clear and certain and to avoid any\nslant, we are of the considered view that it is not\nexpedient to hark back into the past precedents\nand we prefer to adhere to the ratio laid down in\nthe Direct Recruits case.\n\n26. As stated, the counsel for the promotees placed\nstrong reliance on proposition 'B' while the\ncounsel for the Direct Recruits relied on\nproposition 'A'. The controversy is as to which of\nthe propositions would apply to the facts of this\ncase. The proposition 'A' lays down that once an\nincumbent is appointed to a post according to\nrules, his seniority has to be counted from the date\nof his appointment and not according to the date\nof his confirmation. The latter part thereof\namplifies that where the initial appointment is\nonly ad hoc and not according to rules and is\nmade as a stop gap arrangement, the period of\nofficiation in such post cannot be taken into\naccount for reckoning seniority. The quintessence\nof the propositions is that the appointment to a\npost must be according to rules and not by way of\nad hoc or stop gap arrangement made due to\nadministrative exigencies. If the initial\nappointment thus made was de hors the rules, the\nentire length of such service cannot be counted for\nseniority. In other words the appointee would\nbecome a member of the service in the substantive\ncapacity from the date of his appointment only if\nthe appointment was made according to rules and\nseniority would be counted only from that date.\nPropositions 'A' and 'B' cover different aspects of\none situation. One must discern the difference\ncritically. Proposition 'B' must, therefore, be read\n*77* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nalong with para 13 of the judgment wherein the\nratio decidendi of Narender Chadha' was held to\nhave considerable force. The latter postulated that\nif the initial appointment to a substantive post or\nvacancy was made deliberately, in disregard of\nthe rule and allowed the incumbent to continue on\nthe post for well over 15 to 20 years without\nreversion and till the date of regularisation of the\nservice in accordance with the rules, the period of\nofficiating service has to be counted towards\nseniority. This Court in Narender Chadha case?\nwas cognizant of the fact that the rules empower\nthe government to relax the rule of appointment.\nWithout reading paragraph 13 and Proposition 'B'\nand Narender Chadha' ratio together the true\nimport of the proposition would not be\nappreciated. We would deal with the exercise of\npower of relaxing the rule later. After giving\nanxious consideration, we are of the view that the\nlatter half of Proposition 'A' would apply to the\nfacts of the case and the rule laid down in that\nhalf is to be followed. If the concerned rules\nprovide the procedure to fix inter se seniority\nbetween direct recruits and promotees, the\nseniority has to be determined in that manner.\n\n27. Realising that applicability of Proposition 'B' to\nthe facts would run into rough weather the\ncounsel for the promotees attempted to anchor it\nby reiterating that as on date the Public Service\nCommission found the promotees eligible for\nconfirmation as per rules, the entire length of\nservice would be counted for their seniority. We\nexpress our inability to accede to the contention.\nIt is seen that appointment of the promotees as\nAssistant Conservators of Forest was not in\naccordance with Rule 5(b) read with Appendix 'B'\nof the Rules. Admittedly the promotions were on\nad hoc basis pending direct recruitment and are in\nexcess of the quota prescribed under Rule 6. By\nno strength of imagination it could be said that\n*78* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe promotions were made to a substantive post in\naccordance with the Rules. Therefore, the\npromotees do not hold the post in substantive\ncapacity.\n\n28. Undoubtedly when there was dearth of direct\nrecruits the promotees discharged the duties\nranging between 5 to 12 years prior to filing of\nthe writ petitions. The promotees generally may\nget one or two chances of promotion to cadre\nposts in higher echelons of the Indian Forest\nService. Reckoning continuous officiation of ad\nhoc promotion would enable the less privileged to\nexcel their latent capabilities in the cadre post.\"\n\n\"34. Accordingly we have no hesitation to hold that the\npromotees have admittedly been appointed on ad\nhoc basis as a stop gap arrangement, though in\nsubstantive posts, and till the regular recruits are\nappointed in accordance with the rules. Their\nappointments are de hors the rules and until they\nare appointed by the Governor according to rules,\nthey do not become the members of the service in\na substantive capacity. Continuous length of ad\nhoc service from the date of initial appointment\ncannot be counted towards seniority. The\nGovernor shall have to make recruitment by\npromotion to substantive vacancies in the posts of\nAssistant Conservator of Forest, if not already\nmade, in accordance with Rule 5(b) read with\nAppendix 'B' and Rule 6. Their seniority shall be\ncounted only from the respective dates of\nappointment to the substantive posts in their\nquota under Rule 6 as per the rules. The direct\nrecruits having been appointed in accordance\nwith Rule 5(a) read with Appendix 'A', their\nseniority shall be counted from the date of their\ndis- charging the duties of the post of Assistant\nConservator of Forest and the seniority of the\ndirect recruits also shall accordingly be fixed. The\ninter se seniority of the direct recruits and\n*79* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npromotees shall be determined in accordance with\nRules 5, 6 and the Rule 24 in the light of the law\ndeclared in the judgment. All the employees are\nentitled to all consequential benefits. On account\nof the pendency of judicial proceedings, if any of\nthe employees became barred by age for\nconsideration for promotion to cadre posts, the\nappropriate governments would do well to\nsuitability relax the rules and do justice to the\neligible conditions.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n43. He, therefore, submits that the Tribunal has\n\nunanimously concluded that the four Applicants did not have any\n\nlocus standi to challenge the impugned final list dated\n\n31.12.2020 and the final seniority list dated 03.03.2018. He\n\nfurther submits that these four Applicants were in excess of the\n\nquota and, therefore, they would be eligible for regularization\n\nfrom the dates a permanent vacancy arose within their quota.\n\nUntil then, they would continue to be adhoc appointees and the\n\nday they are absorbed on a permanent vacant post in the cadre,\n\nthat would be the day of their entering the Deputy Collector's\n\nquota. In the absence of a vacant post, the Tahasildar could not\n\nhave been promoted as a Deputy Collector since two Deputy\n\nCollectors cannot occupy one post.\n\n*80* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n44. In the light of the above, Shri Apte submits that if\n\nthe select list is not in tune with the Rules, these Deputy\n\nCollectors in the absence of a review under Rule 12 leading to\n\nthe ratification of their selection, will have to return back as\n\nTahasildars, notwithstanding the long times they have spent as\n\nPDC. He relies upon\nMaharashtra Vikrikar Karmachari\n\nSanghatana vs. State of Maharashtra\n, (2000) 2 SCC 552 , in\n\nsupport of his above contention. Paragraphs 4 and 26 read as\n\nfollows:-\n\n\"4. For the first time, the State Government in\nexercise of powers conferred by provisions of\n\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India, framed\nthe rules called Maharashtra Sales Tax\nInspectors Recruitment Rules, 1971 (for short\n'the Rules 1971') which came into force w.e.f.\nSeptember 6, 1971. Suffice is to refer to Rule 2\nthereof. It deals with the appointments to the\nposts of Sales Tax Inspectors from two sources,\nnamely direct recruits and by promotion in the\nratio of 60:40 as far as practicable. Rule 2\nreads thus :-\n\n\"2. Appointment to the posts of Sales\nTax Inspectors shall be made either :\n\n(a) by promotion of suitable clerks in\nthe Sales Tax Department, who have passed at\nleast Part I of the Departmental Examination\nprescribed for the Sales Tax Inspector or for the\nHigher Clerical staff in the Sales Tax\nDepartment or who have been exempted from\npassing the Departmental Examination\nprescribed for Sales Tax Inspectors or for the\nHigher Clerical Staff:\n\n*81* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nProvided that the Clerks who have\npassed Part I of the Departmental Examination\nfor Sales Tax Inspector and who have been\npromoted to the posts of Sales Tax Inspectors\nare required to pass Part II of the Departmental\nExamination for Sales Tax Inspector also,\naccording to the rules made in that behalf,\nfailing which they shall be liable to be reverted.\n\nThe ratio of persons appointed by\npromotion as provided above and by\nnomination as provided below shall, as far as\npracticable, be 40:60. The ratio shall not apply\nto temporary vacancies not exceeding one year\nwhich may be filled by promotion. Such\npromotions shall, however, be treated as\nstopgap promotions and will not entitle the\npromotees to seniority by virtue thereof.\n\nNote : In the period from the date on\nwhich these rules come into force to the date on\nwhich the results of the first Departmental\nExamination of Sales Tax Inspectors under the\nunified Departmental Examination Rules are\ndeclared, promotions made to the post of Sales\nTax Inspector shall be purely provisional and\npersons so promoted shall be required to pass\nthe prescribed Departmental Examination\nwithin the prescribed period from the date the\nDepartmental Examination rules come into\nforce, failing which they shall be liable to be\nreverted :\n\nOR\n\n(b) by nomination, on the result of a\ncompetitive examination held by the\nMaharashtra Public Service Commission, from\namong candidates who -\n\n(i) possess a degree in Arts, Science,\nCommerce, Law or Agriculture of a recognised\nUniversity or any recognised equivalent\nqualifications;\n\nand\n(ii) have attained the age of 18 years\n*82* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nand have not attained the age of 24 years, on\nthe first day of the month immediately following\nthe month in which the posts are advertised by\nthe Commission;\n\nProvided that the upper age limit shall be\nrelaxed upto 30 years in the case of persons\nserving in the Sales Tax Department.\"\n\nThereafter, the State of Maharashtra in exercise\nof powers conferred under\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution of India framed the Rules for\nregulating the seniority amongst government\nemployees. The said Rules were called\nMaharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of\nSeniority) Rules, 1982 (for short 'Rules 1982').\nThese rules came into force w.e.f. June 21,\n1982, Rule 4 is relevant in the present\ncontroversy and it reads thus :\n\n\"4. General Principles of Seniority :\n\n(1) Subject to the other provisions of these\nrules, the seniority of a Government servant in\nany post, cadre or service shall ordinarily be\ndetermined on the length of his continuous\nservice there:\n\nProvided that, for the purpose of\ncomputing such service, any period of absence\nfrom the post, cadre or service due to leave,\ndeputation for training or otherwise or on\nforeign service or temporary officiation in any\nother post shall be taken into account, if the\ncompetent authority certified that the\nGovernment servant concerned would have\ncontinued in the said post cadre or service\nduring such period, had he not proceeded on\nleave or deputation Or been appointed\ntemporarily to such other post:\n\nProvided further that, the service, if any,\nrendered by him as a result of a fortuitous\nappointment shall be excluded in computing the\nlength of service and for the purposes of\nseniority he shall be deemed to have been\n*83* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nappointed to the post in the cadre of service on\nthe date on which his regular appointment is\nmade in accordance with the provisions of the\nrelevant recruitment rules.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in\nsub rule (1) :\n\n(a) the inter se seniority of direct\nrecruits selected in one batch for appointment\nto any post, cadre or service, shall be\ndetermined according to their ranks in the\norder of preference arranged by the\nCommission, Selection Board or in the case of\nrecruitment by nomination directly made by the\ncompetent authority, the said authority, as the\ncase may be, if the appointment is taken up by\nthe person recruited within thirty days from the\ndate of issue of the order of appointment or\nwithin such extended period as the competent\nauthority may in its discretion allow.\n\n(b) the inter se seniority of\nGovernment servants promoted from a Select\nList shall be in the same order in which their\nnames appear in such Select List. If the Select\nList is prepared in two parts, the first part,\ncontaining the names of those selected\nunconditionally and the second part containing\nthe names of those selected provisionally. All\npersons included in the first part shall rank\nabove those included in all second part:\n\nProvided that, if the order in which the\nnames are arranged in the Select List is\nchanged following a subsequent review of it,\nthe seniority of the Government servants\ninvolved shall be re-arranged and determined\nafresh in conformity with their revised ranks.\n\n(c) the seniority of a transferred\nGovernment servant vis-a-vis the Government\nservant in the posts, cadre or service to which\nhe is transferred shall be determined by the\ncompetent authority with due regard to the\n*84* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nclass and pay scale of the post, cadre or service\nfrom which he is transferred, the length of his\nservice therein and the circumstances leading\nto his transfer.\n\n(3) Where the dates of appointment in posts,\ncadre or service of any two or more persons\ndetermined after assigning the deemed dates, if\nnecessary, are identical the person senior in\nage shall be considered as senior for the\npurpose of deter-mining the seniority.\"\n\nRule 3 contains several definitions and we are\nconcerned with four definitions.\n\n\"3(d) \"Deemed date\" means the date\nassigned to a Government servant in\naccordance with the provisions of Rub 5;\n\n3(e) \"Direct recruit\" means, in relation to\nany post, cadre or service, a person appointed\nby nomination thereto;\n\n3(f) \"fortuitous appointment' means a\ntemporary appointment made pending a\nregular appointment in accordance with the\nprovisions of the relevant recruitment rules;\n\n3(h) \"Promotee\" means, In relation to\nany post, cadre or service, a Government\nservant appointed thereto by promotion from a\nlower post, cadre or service;\"\n\n\"26. Lastly, it was contended on behalf of the\nappellants that some of :the appellants have put\nin more than 17 years of service when few of\nthe direct recruits were either schooling and/or\nnot born in the cadre. If the appellants were to\nbe pushed down, it will cause a great hardship\nto them. We are unable to subscribe to this\ncontention because if there is patent violation\nof the quota rule, the result must follow and the\nappellants who remained in the office for all\nthese years cannot take the advantage of this\nsituation. This submission is, therefore, devoid\n*85* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nof any substance.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n45. He then relies upon\nM.S.L. Patil, Asstt.\n\nConservator of Forests, Solapur (Maharashtra) and others\n\nvs. State of Maharashtra and others\n, (1996) 11 SCC 361 , to\n\ncontend that even if many years have passed in the PDC cadre, if\n\nthere is no review, the result of returning back as Tahasildar, has\n\nto follow. Paragraphs 2 and 3 read as under:-\n\n\"2. Mr. M.S.L. Patil, party appearing-in-person has\nraised five contentions, namely, that the\ncombined seniority as per the rules was to be\nmaintained from the date of the regular\nappointment or promotion. As per the rules, the\npetitioner came to be appointed prior to the\nappointment of the direct recruits. Therefore,\nthe entire length of service rendered by him as\nan Assistant Conservator of Forests requires to\nbe tagged for maintaining his seniority. If so\nconsidered, he would be senior to the direct\nrecruits. Therefore, they cannot scale march\nover the promotees. It is also contended that the\ndirect recruits unfilled quota cannot be carried\nforward. He places reliance on the judgment of\nthis court in\nIndra Sawhney v. Union of India\n\n[1992 Supp.\n(3) 217] known as Mandal's case.\nThey were not recruited according to rules. He\nalso contended that he was not made a party to\nthe earlier proceedings which culminated in the\naforesaid judgment. Therefore, the decision\npassed by this Court is violative of the\nprinciples of natural justice. He also contended\nthat the third respondent in this case is a direct\nrecruit and has concealed several material\n*86* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nfacts which led to the open judgment by this\nCourt. Shri Raju Ramachandran, learned\nsenior counsel appearing for some of the\npromotees, contended that in the earlier case,\nthis Court in paragraph 9 of the judgment has\nspecifically stated the premises that specific\nmaterial has not been placed on record of the\nappointment of the promotees, viz., whether\ntheir promotions were fortuitous or not. The\nquota rules was broken down between the\ndirect recruits and the promotees. Even under\nRules, 1982, the second proviso thereto gives a\npower to the Government to certify that the\ndirect recruitment could not be made. In view of\nthe stand taken by the Government in the\ncounter- affidavit filed in the Tribunal that the\nso-called rule of quota has been broken down,\nit would amount to certification that it did not\nmake regular recruitment; as a result,\npromotees gain seniority which has to be\ncounted from the date of the regular promotion.\nThereby, they would be senior to the direct\nrecruits.\n\n3. In view of these contentions, the question that\narises is whether the judgment of this Court has\nbeen vitiated by any error of law warranting\nreconsideration at the behest of some of the\npersons who are not parties to the earlier\nproceedings? It is undoubted that they were not\nparties to their earlier petition but this Court\nhas laid down the general principle of law, and,\ntherefore, whether or not they are parties to the\nearlier proceedings, the general principle of\nlaw stands applicable to every person\nirrespective of the fact whether he is party to\nthe earlier order or not. It is not in dispute that\nthere is a ratio prescribed for the direct recruits\nand the promotees, namely 1:1. In other words,\nfor every 100 vacancies the promotees are\nentitled only to 50 vacancies. It is not in dispute\n*87* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthat these promotees have been promoted in\nexcess of the quota. Under those circumstances,\nit is settled law that the promotees who are\nappointed in excess of the quota cannot get the\nbe fitted into seniority according to the rules.\nAs to what is the date on which the promotees\nor the direct recruits came to be appointed into\nthe respective quota is a matter of record and\nthe seniority is required to be determined\naccording to the law laid down by this Court.\nIn several judgments of this Court, it is now\nfirmly settled that mere by because of the fact\nthat State Government could not make direct\nrecruitment due to its inaction, it cannot be said\nthat the rule of quota has been broken down.\nTherefore, as and when the direct recruitment\nhas been made, the direct recruits are entitled\nto placement of their seniority into the\nvacancies reserved for them as per the ratio\nand the seniority determined as per the rules\nwithin the respective quota.\nSimilarly, when the\npromotees came to be promoted in accordance\nwith the rules in excess of their quota, this\nCourt stated in\nK.C. Joshi and others v. Union\nof India and others\n, [AIR 1991 SC 284] though\na Bench of three Hon'ble Judges, that the\npromotees in excess of the quota cannot be\ngiven seniority from the respective dates of\ntheir promotions. They have to be considered\nonly from the respective dates on which their\nrespective quota is available.\n\nThe same\ndecision was followed and reiterated in\nA.N.\nSehgal vs. Raje Rama\n[1992 Supp. (1) SCC\n304]. Under these circumstances, we do not\nthink that the judgment of this Court is vitiated\nby any error of law for reconsideration. Even\nRule 4, second proviso has no application to\nthe facts in this case. Rule 4 contemplates the\nseniority and second proviso postulates that\nwhen the recruitment could not be made, they\nhave to certify the ground on which it could not\n*88* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nbe made and thereafter the seniority has to be\ndetermined. In view of the law now laid down,\nthe certification of the non-making of direct\nrecruitment according to rules, bears no\nrelevance. The question of carry forward in this\ncase, as\nlaid down in\nMandal's\ncase, has no\napplication\nfor the reason that the recruitment\nin proportion is one the methods of recruitment\nand is required to be made. The balance posts\nare required to be recruited by subsequent\npublication and the promotees have no right to\nget into the post reserved for the direct recruits.\n\nMandal's case concerns carry forward posts\nreserved under\nArticle 16(4)\nfor Scheduled\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward\nClasses which has nothing to do in this case.\nThough some of the grounds will be available\nto argue the case on merits, that is no ground to\nreopen the settled law laid by this Court in\nearlier decision.\"\n\n46. He then relies upon a judgment delivered by the\n\nTribunal on 17.04.2008 in Original Application No.526/2004\n\n(\nRajendra Nimbalkar and others vs. The State of\n\nMaharashtra and others\n), wherein, the Tribunal has upheld the\n\nrule of quota as set out in Rule 4. He relies upon clauses 2, 3, 5\n\nand 5.1 of the impugned list dated 31.12.2020 in support of his\n\nabove contention. To the extent of review under Rule 12, he\n\nrelies upon clause 5.2. He also relies upon clause 5.3 with regard\n\nto fortuitous service. He has further\nplaced reliance upon\nclauses\n\n5.4, 5.5, 6, 6.1 to 6.3, 7, 7.1 to 7.4 and 8.\n\n*89* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n47. Shri Apte has then referred to clause 3 of the\n\noperative order, passed by the learned Member (Judicial) and\n\nsubmits that such directions without allowing the O.A. and\n\nwithout concluding that the impugned final list is bad in law,\n\nwould be an unsustainable direction. Clause 3 reads thus:-\n\n\"3. The seniority list of the Deputy Collectors for\nthe period 01.01.2004 onwards shall be\nprepared having regard to the observations\nmade in the present order and strictly in\nobservance of the Recruitment Rules of 1977,\nwithin the period of next 6 months from the date\nof this order.\"\n\n48. Shri Apte has then referred to the Government\n\nResolution dated 31.12.2020 by which, the cadre strength of the\n\nDeputy Collectors was fixed at 514 from 1999 onwards. This\n\nstrength was maintained upto 2012. The impugned seniority list\n\nis upto 2003. He then takes a strong exception to the direction\n\nissued by the Tribunal to prepare a fresh seniority list from 2004,\n\nwhich was nobody's prayer before the Tribunal. When the\n\nTribunal has held that the four Applicants did not have the locus\n\nstandi to file the petition and had no cause of action due to which\n\nthe Tribunal disposed off the applications, it could not have\n*90* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ngranted any relief indirectly to the Applicants which they could\n\nnot get directly. On these premises, he submits that clause 4 of\n\nthe operative part of the Tribunal's order directing deletion of the\n\nword 'fortuitous', is unsustainable.\n\nSubmissions of the Senior Advocate Shri Kumbhakoni\n\n49. The learned Senior Advocate representing the DDC\n\nin these matters, more specifically Respondent No.5 in Writ\n\nPetition No.9163/2022 and the Petitioner in Writ Petition\n\nNo.9631/2022, submits that the impugned judgment of the\n\nTribunal is a \"fractured view\". The Tribunal Members have\n\nconcurred only on two grounds, firstly that the four Applicants\n\ndo not have the locus to file the applications and they do not have\n\nany cause of action. Despite having concluded that the four\n\nApplicants could not have filed the proceedings, the Tribunal\n\nproceeded to deal with the merits of the matter. This was\n\nuncalled for and was not expected from the Tribunal.\n\n50. On the merits of the claims of these Applicants, the\n\nTribunal did not interfere with the impugned final seniority list\n\ndated 31.12.2020, which covers the period from 01.01.1999 till\n*91* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n31.12.2003. The earlier seniority list dated 31.12.1998 has\n\nbeen finalized and the said issue is concluded. In the light\n\nof these facts, the Tribunal had no reason to go into the merits of\n\nthe claims of the Applicants, inasmuch as, it has further travelled\n\nin declining to interfere with the final seniority list and yet, has\n\nissued certain directions to the State, which cannot be sustained.\n\n51. On the aspect of whether, the impugned judgment\n\ncould be termed as a \"judgment\", Shri Kumbhakoni has relied\n\nupon the view taken by the Honourable Supreme Court in\n\nShakuntala Shukla vs. State of U.P. and others\n, (2021) SCC\n\nOnline SC 672, wherein, it has been held that the judgment must\n\nbe pronounced on the statement of material/ relevant facts, legal\n\nissues or questions, deliberation to reach at a decision and the\n\nratio or conclusive decision. It would be apposite to reproduce\n\nparagraph Nos.32 to 37 hereunder:-\n\n\"32. Having gone through the impugned judgment\nand order passed by the High Court releasing\nthe accused on bail pending appeal, we are at\npains to note that the order granting bail to the\naccused pending appeal lacks total clarity on\nwhich part of the judgment and order can be\nsaid to be submissions and which part can be\nsaid to be the findings/reasonings. It does not\neven reflect the submissions on behalf of the\n*92* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nPublic Prosecutor opposing the bail pending\nappeal. A detailed counter affidavit was filed\non behalf of the State opposing the bail pending\nappeal which has not been even referred to by\nthe High Court. The manner in which the High\nCourt has disposed of the application under\n\nSection 389\nCr.P.C. and has disposed of the\napplication for bail pending appeal cannot be\napproved. It is very unfortunate that by this\njudgment, we are required to observe the\nimportance of judgment; purpose of judgment\nand what should be contained in the judgment.\n\n33. First of all, let us consider what is \"judgment\".\n\n\"Judgment\" means a judicial opinion which\ntells the story of the case; what the case is\nabout; how the court is resolving the case and\nwhy. \"Judgment\" is defined as any decision\ngiven by a court on a question or questions or\nissue between the parties to a proceeding\nproperly before court. It is also defined as the\ndecision or the sentence of a court in a legal\nproceeding along with the reasoning of a judge\nwhich leads him to his decision. The term\n\"judgment\" is loosely used as judicial opinion\nor decision. Roslyn Atkinson, J., Supreme Court\nof Queensland, in her speech once stated that\nthere are four purposes for any judgment that is\nwritten:\n\ni) to spell out judges own thoughts;\nii) to explain your decision to the parties;\n\niii) to communicate the reasons for the\ndecision to the public; and\n\niv) to provide reasons for an appeal court to\nconsider\n\n34. It is not adequate that a decision is accurate, it\nmust also be reasonable, logical and easily\ncomprehensible. The judicial opinion is to be\nwritten in such a way that it elucidates in a\nconvincing manner and proves the fact that the\nverdict is righteous and judicious. What the\n*93* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ncourt says, and how it says it, is equally\nimportant as what the court decides.\n\n35. Every judgment contains four basic elements\nand they are (i) statement of material (relevant)\nfacts, (ii) legal issues or questions, (iii)\ndeliberation to reach at decision and (iv) the\nratio or conclusive decision. A judgment should\nbe coherent, systematic and logically\norganised. It should enable the reader to trace\nthe fact to a logical conclusion on the basis of\nlegal principles. It is pertinent to examine the\nimportant elements in a judgment in order to\nfully understand the art of reading a judgment.\n\nIn the Path of Law, Holmes J. has stressed the\ninsentient factors that persuade a judge. A\njudgment has to formulate findings of fact, it\nhas to decide what the relevant principles of\nlaw are, and it has to apply those legal\nprinciples to the facts. The important elements\nof a judgment are:\n\ni) Caption\n\nii) Case number and citation\n\niii) Facts\n\niv) Issues\n\nv) Summary of arguments by both the parties\n\nvi) Application of law\n\nvii) Final conclusive verdict\n\n36. The judgment replicates the individuality of the\njudge and therefore it is indispensable that it\nshould be written with care and caution. The\nreasoning in the judgment should be intelligible\nand logical. Clarity and precision should be the\ngoal. All conclusions should be supported by\nreasons duly recorded. The findings and\ndirections should be precise and specific.\n\nWriting judgments is an art, though it involves\nskillful application of law and logic. We are\nconscious of the fact that the judges may be\noverburdened with the pending cases and the\narrears, but at the same time, quality can never\n*94* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nbe sacrificed for quantity. Unless judgment is\nnot in a precise manner, it would not have a\nsweeping impact. There are some judgments\nthat eventually get overruled because of lack of\nclarity. Therefore, whenever a judgment is\nwritten, it should have clarity on facts; on\nsubmissions made on behalf of the rival\nparties; discussion on law points and thereafter\nreasoning and thereafter the ultimate\nconclusion and the findings and thereafter the\noperative portion of the order. There must be a\nclarity on the final relief granted. A party to\nthe litigation must know what actually he has\ngot by way of final relief. The aforesaid aspects\nare to be borne in mind while writing the\njudgment, which would reduce the burden of\nthe appellate court too. We have come across\nmany judgments which lack clarity on facts,\nreasoning and the findings and many a times it\nis very difficult to appreciate what the learned\njudge wants to convey through the judgment\nand because of that, matters are required to be\nremanded for fresh consideration. Therefore, it\nis desirable that the judgment should have a\nclarity, both on facts and law and on\nsubmissions, findings, reasonings and the\nultimate relief granted.\n\n37. If we consider the impugned order passed by\nthe High Court, as observed hereinabove, we\nfind that there is a total lack of clarity on the\nsubmissions, which part of the order is\nsubmission, which part of the order is the\nfinding and/or reasoning. As observed\nhereinabove, even the submissions on behalf of\nthe Public Prosecutor have not been noted and\nreferred to, though a detailed counter affidavit\nwas filed by the State opposing the bail\napplications. We do not approve the manner in\nwhich the High Court has disposed of the\napplication for bail pending appeal.\"\n\n*95* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n52. He, therefore, poses a legal question before us as to\n\nwhether, this Court should deal with the aspect of the locus\n\nstandi and cause of action, alone or go into the merits of the\n\nmatter as if this Court is exercising appellate jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to him, the impugned judgment is impossible to be\n\nconfirmed \"as it is\". He, therefore, contends that this Court could\n\ndecide the issues of locus standi and cause of action and not any\n\nother issue, since it is a fractured decision. This Court exercising\n\nWrit jurisdiction, cannot deal with a matter as an Appellate\n\nCourt. If there is a direct conflict between the two Members of\n\nthe Tribunal, almost on all points except the two\nreferred above\n,\n\nany indulgence by the High Court in going into the merits of the\n\nmatter would amount to performing the obligation of a third\n\nmember, by the High Court.\n\n53. He refers to\nSection 26\nof the Administrative\n\nTribunals Act, 1985, which reads thus:-\n\n\"26. Decision to be by majority.--If the Members of\na Bench differ in opinion on any point, the\npoint shall be decided according to the opinion\nof the majority, if there is a majority, but if the\nMembers are equally divided, they shall state\nthe point or points on which they differ, and\nmake a reference to the Chairman who shall\n*96* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\neither hear the point or points himself or refer\nthe case for hearing on such point or points by\none or more of the other Members of the\nTribunal and such point or points shall be\ndecided according to the opinion of the\nmajority of the Members of the Tribunal who\nhave heard the case, including those who first\nheard it.\"\n\n54. He submits that when one member draws a specific\n\nconclusion as regards the important aspects in the case and the\n\nMember (Administrative) authors a separate portion of the\n\njudgment, his concluding approval paragraph can only be termed\n\nas a compulsion and not a conclusion. Even the PDC have raised\n\ngrounds in Writ Petition No.9163/2022, that the reliefs and\n\ndirections which were sought, have not been granted by the\n\nTribunal and such directions which were never sought, have been\n\ngranted. He contends that the learned Judicial Member has taken\n\na different, distinct and divergent view, vis-a-vis the view taken\n\nby the Member (Administrative).\n\n55. He relies upon paragraphs 16 to 19 of the judgment\n\ndelivered by the Honourable Supreme Court in\nJ. Balaji Singh\n\nvs. Diwakar Cole and others\n, (2017) 14 SCC 207 , which read\n\nas under:-\n\n*97* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n\"16. In our considered view, the only error which the\nfirst Appellate Court committed was that it went\non to record the findings on merits. In our view,\nit was not necessary to do so while passing the\norder of remand. The reason is that once the\nfirst Appellate Court formed an opinion to\nremand the case, it was required to give\nreasons in support of the remand order as to\nwhy the remand is called for in the case.\n\nIndeed, the remand was made only to enable\nthe Trial Court to decide the case on merits.\nTherefore, there was no need to discuss much\nless record findings on several issues on merits.\nIt was totally uncalled for.\n\n17. So far as the impugned order is concerned, the\nHigh Court, in our view, committed\njurisdictional error when it also again\nexamined the case on merits and set aside the\njudgment of the first Appellate Court and\nrestored the judgment of the Trial Court. The\nHigh Court, in our opinion, should not have\ndone this for the simple reason that it was only\nexamining the legality of the remand order in\nan appeal filed under Order 43 Rule 1(u) of the\nCode. Indeed, once the High Court came to a\nconclusion that the remand order was bad in\nlaw then it could only remand the case to the\nfirst Appellate Court with a direction to decide\nthe first appeal on merits.\n\n18. The High Court failed to see that when the first\nAppellate Court itself did not decide the appeal\non merits and considered it proper to remand\nthe case to the Trial Court, a fortiori, the High\nCourt had no jurisdiction to decide the appeal\non merits. Moreover, Order 43 Rule 1(u)\nconfers limited power on the High Court to\nexamine only the legality and correctness of the\nremand order of the first Appellate Court but\nnot beyond that. In other words, the High Court\nshould have seen that Order 43 Rule 1(u) gives\na limited power to examine the issue relating to\n*98* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nlegality of remand order, as is clear from Order\n43 Rule 1(u) which reads thus:-\n\n\"1(u) an order under rule 23 or rule 23A\nof Order XLI remanding a case, where an\nappeal would lie from the decree of the\nAppellate Court\"\n\n19. It is well settled law that the jurisdiction to\ndecide the appeal on merits can be exercised by\nthe Appellate Court only when the appeal is\nfiled under Section 96 or 100 of the Code\nagainst the decree. Such was not the case\nhere.\"\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n56. Shri Kumbhakoni has then relied upon a judgment\n\ndated 09.02.2021, delivered by this Court at the Nagpur Bench in\n\nWrit Petition No.3077/2020, Vijaysingh Gajrajsingh Chauhan\n\nvs. Governor of Maharashtra and others\n, AIR Online 2021\n\nBombay 99, [Civil Writ Petition No.3077/2020 (Nagpur Bench)\n\ndecided on 09.02.2021]. The averment of the State in the said\n\ncase was that, the petition did not disclose any cause of action,\n\nno averments have been put forth as regards the right of the\n\nPetitioner being affected.\n\nReliance was placed on\nKusum Ingots\n\nand Alloys Limited vs. Union of India and another\n, 2004 (\n6)\n\nSCC 254, Jotun India Private Limited vs. Union of India and\n\nothers\n, 2018 SCC Online Bombay 6400 and United Forum\n\nand others vs. The Union of India and others, 2018 SCC\n*99* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nOnline Bombay 2221, to buttress his contention that the Court\n\nshould decide an issue if there is a cause of action and should\n\nrefrain from taking up an issue which is purely academic in\n\nnature.\n\n57. He has then pointed out paragraphs 4, 7, 8 and 10,\n\nwhich read thus:-\n\n\"4. Learned Advocate General further contends\nthat the present matter not being a public\ninterest litigation but a writ petition filed by the\npetitioner, the requirement to disclose a cause\nof action, is mandatory. He further submits that\nthe petitioner does not fall within the\nexpression \"aggrieved person\" and neither does\nhe have any direct grievance, for which\nreliance is placed upon\nAyaaubkhan Noorkhan\nPathan Vs. State of Maharashtra and others\n,\n(2013) 4 SCC 465. Further contentions are that\nthere is no executable prayer; the petition\nmerely seeking a declaration is not\nmaintainable. He further submits that only para\n54 in the petition, remotely suggests of any\ncause of action, which does not satisfy the\nrequirement of law of any cause in the\npetitioner. The petition therefore according to\nhim is not maintainable and is required to be\ndismissed on that count alone.\"\n\n\"7. The right to approach a Court of law by a\nparty, is intrinsically linked to a cause of\naction, accrued in favour of such a party. The\napproach, is always for the redressal of a\ngrievance or an entitlement, the denial of which\ngives rise to a cause of action to a party whose\n*100* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nright is affected by any such cause of action.\nThus, the traditional view as to a \"cause of\naction\" is always personal to the party. The\nquestion whether passing of a legislation by\nitself would give rise to a cause of action, has\nbeen considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nRai Bahadur Hurdut Roy Moti Lal Jute Mills\n\n(supra) as under :-\n\n\"7. On behalf of the appellant Mr Lal\nNarain Sinha has contended that the High\nCourt was in error in holding that the proviso\nto Section 14-A violates either\nArticle 20(1)\nor\n\nArticle 31(2)\nof the Constitution. He has\naddressed us at length in support of his case\nthat neither of the two articles is violated by the\nimpugned proviso. On the other hand, the\nlearned Solicitor-General has sought to support\nthe findings of the High Court on the said two\nconstitutional points; and he has pressed before\nus as a preliminary point his argument that on\na fair and reasonable construction, the proviso\ncannot be applied to the case of the first\nrespondent. We would, therefore, first deal with\nthis preliminary point. In cases where the vires\nof statutory provisions are challenged on\nconstitutional grounds, it is essential that the\nmaterial facts should first be clarified and\nascertained with a view to determine whether\nthe impugned statutory provisions are\nattracted; if they are, the constitutional\nchallenge to their validity must be examined\nand decided. If, however, the facts admitted or\nproved do not attract the impugned provisions\nthere is no occasion to decide the issue about\nthe vires of the said provisions. Any decision on\nthe said question would in such a case be\npurely academic. Courts are and should be\nreluctant to decide constitutional points merely\nas matters of academic importance.\"\n\nThe same has also been considered in Kartar\n*101*\nWP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nSingh\n(supra) as under :-\n\n\"12. The standards themselves, it would\nbe noticed, have been prescribed by the Central\nGovernment on the advice of a Committee\nwhich included in its composition persons\nconsidered experts in the field of food\ntechnology and food analysis. In the\ncircumstances, if the rule has to be struck down\nas imposing unreasonable or discriminatory\nstandards, it could not be done merely on any\nappropriate reasoning but only as a result of\nmaterials placed before the Court by way of\nscientific analysis. It is obvious that this can be\ndone only when the party invoking the\nprotection of\nArticle 14\nmakes averments with\ndetails to sustain such a plea and leads\nevidence to establish his allegations. That\nwhere a party seeks to impeach the validity of a\nrule made by a competent authority on the\nground that the rules offend\nArticle 14\nthe\nburden is on him to plead and prove the\ninfirmity is to well established to need\nelaboration. If, therefore, the respondent\ndesired to challenge the validity of the rule on\nthe ground either of its unreasonableness or its\ndiscriminatory nature, he had to lay a\nfoundation for it by setting out the facts\nnecessary to sustain such a plea and adduce\ncogent and convincing evidence to make out his\ncase, for there is a presumption that every\nfactor which is relevant or material has been\ntaken into account in and formulating the\nclassification of the zones and the prescription\nof the minimum standards to each zone, and\nwhere we have a rule framed with the\nassistance of a committee containing experts\nsuch as the one constituted under\nSection 3\nof\nthe Act, that presumption is strong, if not\noverwhelming. We might in this connection add\nthat the respondent cannot assert any\nfundamental right under\nArticle 19(1)\nto carry\n*102* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\non business in adulterated foodstuffs.\n\n13. Where the necessary facts have been\npleaded and established, the Court would have\nmaterials before it on which it could base\nfindings, as regards the reasonableness or\notherwise or of the discriminatory nature of the\nrules. In the absence of a pleading and proof of\nunreasonableness or arbitrariness the Court\ncannot accept the statement of a party as to the\nunreasonableness or unconstitutionality of a\nrule and refuse to enforce the rule as it stands\nmerely because in its view the standards are too\nhigh and for this reason the rule is\nunreasonable. In the case before us there was\nneither pleading nor proof of any facts directed\nto that end. The only basis on which the\ncontention regarding unreasonableness or\ndiscrimination was raised was an apriori\nargument addressed to the Court, that the\ndivision into the zones was not rational, in that\nhilly and plain areas of the country were not\ndifferentiated for the prescription of the\nminimum Reichert values. That a distinction\nshould exist between hilly regions and plains,\nwas again based on apriori reasoning resting\non the different minimum Reichert values\nprescribed for Himachal Pradesh and Uttar\nPradesh and on no other. It was, however, not\nas if the entire State of Himachal Pradesh is of\nuniform elevation or even as if no part of that\nState is plain country but yet if the same\nminimum was prescribed for the entire area of\nHimachal Pradesh, that would clearly show\nthat the elevation of a place is not the only\nfactor to be taken into account.\"\n\nIn\nKusum Ingots\n(supra) the Hon'ble\nApex Court held as under :-\n\n\"19. Passing of a legislation by itself in our\nopinion do not confer any such right to file a\nwrit petition unless a cause of action arises\n*103* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ntherefor.\n\n21. A parliamentary legislation when it\nreceives the assent of the President of India and\nis published in an Official Gazette, unless\nspecifically excluded, will apply to the entire\nterritory of India. If passing of a legislation\ngives rise to a cause of action, a writ petition\nquestioning the constitutionality thereof can be\nfiled in any High Court of the country. It is not\nso done because a cause of action will arise\nonly when the provisions of the Act or some of\nthem which were implemented shall give rise to\ncivil or evil consequences to the petitioner. A\nwrit court, it is well settled, would not\ndetermine a constitutional question in vacuum.\"\n\n8. Thus the consistency of judicial opinion, in so\nfar as it considers the cause of action, for the\npurpose of laying a challenge to the\nconstitutional validity of any statutory\nprovision, as spelt out from the above decisions,\nclearly indicates that the person raising such\nchallenge, ought to have a cause of action,\nwhich would mean material facts, enabling the\nexistence of a cause of action.\"\n\n\"10. It is further material to note that the petitioner\nalso does not fall within the expression\n\"aggrieved person\", as indicated in\n\nAyaaubkhan Noorkhan Pathan\n(supra) in the\nfollowing manner :-\n\n\"9. It is a settled legal proposition that a\nstranger cannot be permitted to meddle in any\nproceeding, unless he satisfies the\nauthority/court, that he falls within the\ncategory of aggrieved persons. Only a person\nwho has suffered, or suffers from legal injury\ncan challenge the act/action/order etc. in a\ncourt of law. A writ petition under\nArticle\nof the Constitution is maintainable either\nfor the purpose of enforcing a statutory or legal\n*104* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nright, or when there is a complaint by the\nappellant that there has been a breach of\nstatutory duty on the part of the authorities.\nTherefore, there must be a judicially\nenforceable right available for enforcement, on\nthe basis of which writ jurisdiction is resorted\nto. The Court can, of course, enforce the\nperformance of a statutory duty by a public\nbody, using its writ jurisdiction at the behest of\na person, provided that such person satisfies\nthe Court that he has a legal right to insist on\nsuch performance. The existence of such right\nis a condition precedent for invoking the writ\njurisdiction of the courts. It is implicit in the\nexercise of such extraordinary jurisdiction that\nthe relief prayed for must be one to enforce a\nlegal right. In fact, the existence of such right,\nis the foundation of the exercise of the said\njurisdiction by the Court. The legal right that\ncan be enforced must ordinarily be the right of\nthe appellant himself, who complains of\ninfraction of such right and approaches the\nCourt for relief as regards the same.\n\n10. A \"legal right\", means an entitlement\narising out of legal rules. Thus, it may be\ndefined as an advantage, or a benefit conferred\nupon a person by the rule of law. The\nexpression, \"person aggrieved\" does not\ninclude a person who suffers from a\npsychological or an imaginary injury; a person\naggrieved must, therefore, necessarily be one\nwhose right or interest has been adversely\naffected or jeopardised.\n\n11. In Anand Sharadchandra Oka v.\n\nUniversity of Mumbai, a similar view was taken\nby this Court, observing that, if a person\nclaiming relief is not eligible as per\nrequirement, then he cannot be said to be a\nperson aggrieved regarding the election or the\nselection of other persons.\"\n\n*105* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n58. Shri Kumbhakoni, therefore, submits that unless a\n\ncause of action is intrinsically linked with a litigant in whose\n\nfavour a specific right in law has accrued, a court should avoid\n\nentering into the merits of the case in the absence of any cause\n\nespoused by the litigant. He then relies upon\nState of Bihar vs.\n\nRai Bahadur Hurdut Roy Moti Lal Jute Mills and another\n,\n\nAIR 1960 SC 378, wherein, the Honourable Supreme Court has\n\nheld that any decision on a question which is purely of an\n\nacademic nature, would serve no purpose and the Courts should\n\nbe reluctant to take up such an issue. He, therefore, sums up that\n\nwhen both the members of the Tribunal had concurred on there\n\nbeing no cause of action and the Applicants had not locus standi,\n\nit should not have dealt with the merits of the case.\n\n59. Shri Kumbhakoni has submitted that Writ Petition\n\nNo.12699/2022 filed by\nNitin Mahajan vs. The State of\n\nMaharashtra and others\n, is not maintainable since the Petitioner\n\nhas directly approached this Court praying for reliefs which\n\ncould be considered only by the Tribunal.\nHe relies upon the\n\njudgment delivered by this Court dated 16.02.2022, delivered in\n\nWrit Petition No.12297/2021 (Aurangabad Bench), M/s Mestra\n*106* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nAG Switzerland vs. The State of Maharashtra and others.\n\nParagraphs 14, 17, 26 and 27 read as under:-\n\n\"14. In the present case, the machinery providing\nappeal is sought to be bye-passed by the\npetitioner on the ground that the Tribunal\nhaving already pronounced its decision in a\nsimilar matter, substantial justice cannot be\nexpected from the first appellate authority as\nwell as from the second appellate authority.\nThis is the crux of Mr. Sridharan's argument. It\nis now time to examine the contentions raised\nby him.\"\n\n\"17. Mr. Sridharan is again right, but only partially.\n\nNotwithstanding that questions of fact emerged\nfor decision in Thansingh Nathmal (supra), the\nSupreme Court had the occasion to lay down\ntherein a principle of law which is salutary and\nnot to be found in any other previous decision\nrendered by it. The principle, plainly is that, if a\nremedy is available to a party before the high\ncourt in another jurisdiction, the writ\njurisdiction should not normally be exercised\non a petition under\nArticle 226\n, for, that would\nand allow the machinery set up by the\nconcerned statute to be bye-passed. The\nrelevant passage from the decision reads as\nfollows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the High Court\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution is couched\nin wide terms and the exercise thereof is not\nsubject to any restrictions except the territorial\nrestrictions which are expressly provided in the\nArticle. But the exercise of the jurisdiction is\ndiscretionary; it is not exercised merely\nbecause it is lawful to do so. The very\namplitude of the jurisdiction demands that it\nwill ordinarily be exercised subject to certain\nself-imposed limitations. Resort to that\njurisdiction is not intended as an alternative\n*107* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nremedy for relief which may be obtained in a\nsuit or other mode prescribed by statute.\nOrdinarily the Court will not entertain a\npetition for a writ under\nArticle 226\n, where the\npetitioner has an alternative remedy which,\nwithout being unduly onerous, provides an\nequally efficacious remedy. Again the High\nCourt does not generally enter upon a\ndetermination of questions which demand an\nelaborate examination of evidence to establish\nthe right to enforce which the writ is claimed.\nThe High Court does not therefore act as a\ncourt of appeal against the decision of a court\nor tribunal, to correct errors of fact, and does\nnot by assuming jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\n\ntrench upon an alternative remedy provided by\nstatute for obtaining relief. Where it is open to\nthe aggrieved petitioner to move another\ntribunal, or even itself in another jurisdiction\nfor obtaining redress in the manner provided by\na statute, the High Court normally will not\npermit, by entertaining a petition under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, the machinery created\nunder the statute to be by-passed, and will\nleave the party applying to it to seek resort to\nthe machinery so set up.\"\n\n\"26. To sum up, we are loath to entertain this writ\npetition by exercising our discretion because (i)\nthe petitioner can approach this Court in its\nappellate jurisdiction under\nsection 27\nof the\nMVAT Act at the appropriate time; and (ii) the\npetitioner is free to rely on the decision in\n\nMahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt. Ltd.\n\n(supra) before the appellate authority to have\nthe impugned order reversed since such\ndecision will prevail, if it is applicable, over\nany previous contra decision of the Tribunal.\"\n\n\" 27. However, in the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances, viz. pendency of this writ\npetition on the file of this Court for quite some\n*108* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ntime and that a Constitutional issue touching\n\nArticle 286\nof the Constitution is sought to be\nraised, we are inclined not to relegate the\npetitioner to the first appellate remedy but to\ngive it opportunity to prefer an appeal before\nthe Tribunal directly, if it so chooses, so that\nany infirmity in the impugned order can be\nbrought to its notice, including the decision of\nthis Court in the case of\nMahyco Monsanto\nBiotech (India) Pvt. Ltd.\n(supra), for its\ncorrection. It is ordered accordingly.\"\n\n60. He has then relied upon Gaurav Ganesh Das Daga\n\nand others vs. MPSC and others, Writ Petition No.2270/2021\n\n(Mumbai Appellate Jurisdiction), wherein, this Court has\n\ndelivered a judgment on 04.03.2022, concluding that when the\n\nprovisions of the\nAdministrative Tribunals Act\nare applicable and\n\nthe Tribunal is a statutory forum, approaching the High Court\n\nshould be discouraged. He relies upon paragraph Nos.8, 9, 11,\n\n16, 18, 22 and 23, which read as under:-\n\n\"8. Having heard the parties and on consideration of\nthe decisions cited at the Bar, we find no reason to\ntake a view different from the one expressed by us\norally on 2nd March, 2022. We completely concur\nwith the reasons assigned by the coordinate Bench\nin Vijay Ghogare (supra) for holding the writ\npetition to be not maintainable before the Court at\nthis stage. In view of such concurrence, we could\nhave preferred to maintain reticence to assigning\nour reasons twice over on the same subject.\n\n*109* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nHowever, we wish to furnish our opinion with a\nview to clear certain misconceptions in law while\nholding these writ petitions not to be maintainable\nbefore this Court. This, we feel, is required on\nnoticing the emergence of judicial decisions by\nsome Courts, based on misreading of the law laid\ndown in\nL. Chandra Kumar\n(supra) as well as\nT.\nK. Rangarajan\n(supra), whereby grievances of\nState Government employees were entertained at\nthe first instance upon holding that the remedy\nbefore the Tribunals constituted by the Act is an\nalternative to the writ remedy available under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution.\n\n9. The discussion on the topic must, however, begin\nwith\nKiran Singh & Ors. vs. Chaman Paswan &\nOrs.. It\nhappens to be one of the vintage decisions\nof the Supreme Court referring to the fundamental\nprinciple of law, well established, that a decree\npassed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity\nand that its invalidity could be set up whenever\nand wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied\nupon, even at the stage of execution and even in\ncollateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction,\nwhether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether\nit is in respect of the subject matter of the action\nstrikes at the very authority of the Court to pass\nany decree, and such a defect cannot be cured\neven by consent of parties. The said decision has\nbeen followed in a long-line of decisions to which\nreference is considered unnecessary at this stage.\nHowever, we wish to record why such decision is\nrelevant at a later part of this discussion.\"\n\n\"11. We have found on perusal of the decisions cited by\nMr. Deshmukh that some of the Courts have lost\ncomplete sight of the difference between an\nalternative remedy (meaning thereby that, apart\nfrom the High Court, another statutory remedy is\navailable that provides an equally efficacious\nremedy and which could have been pursued by the\nlitigant, but he elects to explore the writ remedy\nsince the bar of alternative remedy, being a rule of\n*110* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nself-imposed limitation, does not oust the writ\ncourt's jurisdiction) and a statutory remedy\n(which is provided by the law as the first, nay\nonly, legal remedy, whereafter the aggrieved party\ncould pursue, if so advised, the writ remedy\nquestioning the decision given by the statutory\nfora). This position of law would require a little\nelaboration in the wake of what the position in\nlaw was prior to the 42nd Constitution\n(Amendment) Act, 1976, which introduced Part\nXIV A in the Constitution containing\nArticles 323-\n\nA and 323-B as well as in the light of what the\nConstitution Bench\nlaid down in\n\nL. Chandra\nKumar\n(supra) while inter alia examining\nchallenges to sub-clause (d) of clause (2) of\n\nArticle 323-A\nand\nsection 28\nof the Act.\"\n\n\"16. Having regard to such scheme of things,\nwhich could be pursued by an aggrieved\nemployee, we are also of the firm view that the\nlaw\nlaid down in\n\nWhirlpool Corporation vs.\nRegistrar of Trade Marks\n(carving out exceptions\non the fulfillment whereof a writ petition could be\ndirectly entertained notwithstanding that the\nlitigant has not availed the alternative remedy\nmade available by a statute) cannot be applied to\nproceedings seeking to invoke the writ jurisdiction\nof the High Court for relief when the subject\nmatter of the action is covered by \"service\nmatters\" as defined in\nsection 3(q)\nof the Act.\"\n\n\"18. Unhesitatingly therefore, we record that the\ndecision in Magadh Sugar & Energy (supra) does\nnot assist the case of the petitioners.\"\n\n\"22. Now, we need to come back to\nKiran Singh\n\n(supra) and say why it is relevant for the present\npurpose.\n\nIn our considered opinion, a decision\nrendered by the High Court on a challenge of the\npresent nature (which is covered by the provisions\nof the Act and MAT being the forum required to be\napproached for relief) would be a nullity in view\nof the decision in\nKiran Singh\n(supra) read with\nL.\nChandra Kumar\n(supra). Knowing and\n*111* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nunderstanding what the law is, straining ourselves\nto look into the merits of the challenge and\nrendering a decision which we know would be a\nnullity should not at all be attempted.\n\n23. We ought to deal with one other side argument of\nMr. Deshmukh before recording our conclusion.\n\nHe has submitted that since the GRs under\nchallenge in this batch of writ petitions are also\nunder challenge in a separate batch of writ\npetitions concerning recruitment of engineers in\nthe Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution\nCompany Ltd. (hereafter \"MSEDCL\", for short),\nthe MAT has no jurisdiction to try such writ\npetitions and the same would be required to be\nheard and decided on merits by this Court.\nHowever, driving one set of petitioners to move\nthe MAT while allowing another set of petitioners\nto have their claim decided by the High Court\ncould lead to divergent opinions being rendered.\nHe, therefore, submits that it is desirable that this\nCourt hears all the writ petitions analogously.\"\n\n61. He contends that though the Tribunal at Aurangabad\n\nhas taken a particular view, the said Petitioner does not get a\n\nright to bypass the Tribunal and approach this Court directly.\n\nMoreover, the right of the Respondents also has to be considered\n\nsince, if the said Petitioner was to succeed before the Tribunal, a\n\nright to test the legality and validity of the judgment delivered by\n\nthe Tribunal is available to the Respondents and such right stands\n\ntaken away by the Petitioner having directly approached this\n\nCourt.\n\n*112* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nShri Kumbhakoni's submissions on the merits of the\n\ncases\n\n62. Shri Kumbhakoni refers to\nSection 26\nof the\n\nAdministrative Tribunals Act to contend that the members of the\n\nTribunal have to identify the differing points. He relies on\n\nShekhar Narayan Shetty vs. Madhavlal Pittie and others\n,\n\n2015(4) Mh.L.J. 687.\n\nIn support of his contention that these\n\nmatters deserve to be remitted to the Tribunal for a rehearing, he\n\nrelied upon\nB. Premanand and others vs. Mohan Koikal and\n\nothers\n, (2011) 4 SCC 266.\n\n63. Shri Kumbhakoni further contends that since this\n\nCourt is exercising supervisory jurisdiction, if there are inherent\n\ndeficiencies in the impugned judgment of the Tribunal, this Court\n\ncannot take up the matters as if it is exercising jurisdiction in an\n\nappeal. The conclusions drawn by each member of the Tribunal\n\ncannot be rectified by this Court. He further submits that since\n\nthe 'coram' of the Tribunal has changed, it would be fruitful to\n\nremand the matters to the Tribunal for a rehearing.\n\n*113* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n64. Shri Kumbhakoni submits that the consultation with\n\nthe Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC), is\n\ninevitable and the Tribunal has clearly failed in considering this\n\naspect. Without concurrence of the MPSC, no promotion can be\n\nlegalized/ratified by the State.\n\nSubmissions of the learned Senior Advocate Shri\n\nRajadhyaksha\n\n65. Shri Atul Rajadhyaksha, the learned Senior\n\nAdvocate, is leading all the learned Advocates, who are\n\nappearing for the PDC in all these matters. He submits that the\n\nWrit Petitions filed by the State of Maharashtra and the DDC,\n\nwill have to be dismissed purely on the ground of non-joinder of\n\nparties. The Tribunal has not been arrayed as a Respondent in the\n\nsaid petitions. He relies upon the judgment delivered by the\n\nHonourable Supreme Court in\nUdit Narain Singh Malpaharia\n\nvs. Additional Member, Board of Revenue, Bihar\n, AIR 1963\n\nSC 786 and points out paragraph Nos.8 and 11, which read as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"8. The next question is, what is the nature of a\n*114* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nwrit of certiorari? What relief can a petitioner\nin such a writ obtain from the Court?\nCertiorari lies to remove for the purpose of\nquashing the proceedings of inferior courts of\nrecord or other persons or bodies exercising\njudicial or quasi-judicial functions. It is not\nnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to\nnotice the distinction between a writ of\ncertiorari and a writ in the nature of certiorari;\nin either case the High Court directs an inferior\ntribunal or authority to transmit to itself the\nrecord of proceedings pending therein for\nscrutiny and, if necessary, for quashing the\nsame. It is well settled law that a certiorari lies\nonly in respect of a judicial or quasi-judicial\nact as distinguished from an administrative act.\nThe following classic test\nlaid down by\nLord\njustice Atkin, as he then was, in\nThe Kind v.\nElectricity Commissioner\n(1924) 1 KB 171 and\nfollowed by this Court in more than one\ndecision clearly brings out the meaning of the\nconcept of judicial act:\n\n\"Wherever any body of persons having\nlegal authority to determine questions affecting\nthe rights of subjects, and having the duty to act\njudicially.. act in excess of their legal authority\nthey are subject to the controlling jurisdiction\nof the King's Bench Division exercised in these\nwrits.\"\n\nLord justice Slesser in The King v.\n\nLondon County Council, (1931) 2 KB 215 (243)\ndissected the concept of judicial act\nlaid down\nby\nAtkin, L. J., into the following heads in his\njudgment: \"wherever any body of persons (1)\nhaving legal authority (2) to determine\nquestions affecting rights of subjects and (3)\nhaving the duty to act judicially (4) act in\nexcess of their legal authority a writ of\ncertiorari may issue\". It will be seen from the\ningredients of judicial act that there must be a\nduty to act judicially. A tribunal, therefore,\n*115* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nexercising a judicial or quasi-judicial act\ncannot decide against the rights of 1 party\nwithout giving him a hearing or an opportunity\nto represent his case in the manner known to\nlaw. If the provisions of a particular statute or\nrules made thereunder do not provide for it,\nprinciples of natural justice demand it. Any\nsuch order made without hearing the affected\nparties would be void. As a writ of certiorari\"\n\nwill be granted to remove the record of\nproceedings of an inferior tribunal or authority\nexercising judicial or quasi judicial acts, ex\nhypothesi it follows that the High Court in\nexercising its jurisdiction shall also act\njudicially in disposing of the proceedings\nbefore it. It is implicit in such a proceeding that\na tribunal or authority which is directed to\ntransmit the records must be a party in the writ\nproceedings, for, without giving notice to it, the\nrecord of proceedings cannot be brought to the\nHigh Court. It is said that in an appeal against\nthe decree of a subordinate court, the court that\npassed the decree need not be made a party and\non the same parity of reasoning it is contended\nthat a tribunal need not also be made a party in\na writ proceeding. But there is an essential\ndistinction between an appeal against a decree\nof a subordinate court and a writ of certiorari\nto quash the order of a tribunal or authority: in\nthe former, the proceedings are regulated by\nthe\nCode of Civil Procedure\nand the court making\nthe order is directly subordinate to the\nappellate court and ordinarily acts within its\nbounds, though sometimes wrongly or even\nillegally, but in the case of the latter, a writ of\ncertiorari is issued to quash the order of a\ntribunal, which is ordinarily outside the\nappellate or revisional jurisdiction of the court\nand the order is ;set aside on the ground that\nthe tribunal or authority acted Without or in\nexcess of jurisdiction. If such a tribunal- or\n*116* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nauthority is not made party to the writ, it can\neasily ignore the order of the High Court\nquashing its order, for not being, a party, it will\nnot be liable, to contempt. In these\ncircumstances whoever else is a necessary\nparty or not the authority or tribunal is\ncertainly a necessary party to such a\nproceeding. In this case, the Board of Revenue\nand the Commissioner of Excise were rightly,\nmade parties in the writ petition.\"\n\n\"11. The long established English practice, which\nthe High Courts in our country have adopted\nall along, accepts the said distinction between\nthe necessary and the proper party in a writ of\ncertiorari. The English practice is recorded in\nHalsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 11, 3rd Edn.\n(Lord Simonds') thus in paragraph 136:\n\n\"The notice of motion or summons must\nbe served on all persons directly affected, and\nwhere it relates to any proceedings in or before\na court, and the object is either to compel the\ncourt or an officer thereof to do any act in\nrelation to the proceedings or to quash them or\nany order made therein, the notice of motion or\nsummons must be served on the clerk or\nregistrar of the court, the other parties to the\nproceedings, and (where any objection to the\nconduct of the judge is to be made) on the\njudge........\".\n\nIn paragraph 140 it is stated :\n\n\"On the hearing of the summons or\nmotion for an order of mandamus, prohibition\nor certiorari, counsel in support begins and has\na right of reply. Any person who desires to be\nheard in opposition, and appears to the Court\nor judge to be a proper per-son to be heard, is\nto be heard not withstanding that he has not\nbeen served with the notice or summons, and\nwill be liable to costs in the discretion of the\nCourt or judge if the order should be\n*117* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nmade..........\"\n\nSo too, the Rules made by the Patna High\nCourt require that a party against whom relief\nis sought should be named in the petition. The\nrelevant Rules read thus:\n\nRule 3. Application under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution shall be registered as\nMiscellaneous judicial Cases or Criminal\nMiscellaneous Cases as the case may be.\nRule 4. Application shall, soon after it is\nregistered, be posted for orders before a\nDivision Bench as to issue of notice to the\nrespondents. The Court may either direct notice\nto issue and pass such interim order as it may\ndeem necessary or reject the application.\nRule 5. The notice of the application shall be\nserved on all persons directly affected and on\nsuch other persons as the Court may direct.\n\nBoth the English rules and the rules\nframed by the Patna High Court lay down that\npersons who are directly affected or against\nwhom relief is sought should be named in the\npetition, that is all necessary parties should be\nimpleaded in the petition and notice served on\nthem. In \"The law of Extraordinary Legal\nRemedies\" by Ferris, the procedure in the\nmatter of impleading parties is clearly\ndescribed at p.201 thus:\n\n\"Those parties whose action is to be\nreviewed and who are interested therein and\naffected thereby, and in whose possession the\nrecord of Such action remains, are not only\nproper, but necessary parties. It is to such\nparties that notice to show cause against the\nissuance of the writ must be given, and they are\nthe only parties who may make return, or who\nmay demur. The omission to make parties those\nofficers whose proceedings it is sought to direct\nand control, goes to the very right of the relief\nsought. But in order that the court may do\n*118* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nample and complete justice, and render\njudgment which will be binding on all persons\nconcerned, all persons who are parties to the\nrecord, or who are interested in maintaining the\nregularity of the proceedings of which a review\nis sought, should be made parties respondent.\"\n\nThis passage indicates that both the\nauthority whose order is sought to be quashed\nand the persons who are interested in\nmaintaining the regularity of the proceeding of\nwhich a review is sought should be added as\nparties in a writ proceeding. A division Bench\nof the Bombay High Court in\nAhmedalli V.\nM.D. Lalkaka\n, AIR 1954 Bom 33 at p 34 laid\ndown the procedure thus:\n\n\"I think we should lay down the rule of\npractice that whenever a writ is sought\nchallenging the order of a Tribunal, the\nTribunal must always be a necessary party to\nthe petition. It is difficult to understand how\nunder any circumstances the Tribunal would\nnot be a necessary party when the petitioner\nwants the order of the Tribunal to be quashed\nor to be called in question. It is equally clear\nthat all parties affected by that order should\nalso be necessary parties to the petition.\"\n\nA Full Bench of the Nagpur High Court\nin Kanglu Baula v. Chief Executive Officer, AIR\n1955 Nag 49 (FB), held that though the\nelections to various electoral divisions were\nvoid the petition would have to be dismissed on\nthe short ground that per-sons who were\ndeclared elected from the various\nconstituencies were not joined as parties to the\npetition arid had not been given an opportunity\nto be heard before the order adverse to them\nwas passed. The said decisions also support the\nview we have expressed.\"\n\n*119* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n66. He has then relied upon paragraph Nos.31, 38 to 41\n\nand 43 in\nJogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji vs. State of Gujarat and\n\nothers\n, (2015) 9 SCC 1, which read thus:-\n\n\"31. The next facet pertains to the impleadment of\nthe Court or tribunal as a party. The special\nBench has held that even if application is\ndescribed as one not only under\narticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution, but also under\narticle 227\n, the\nCourt or tribunal whose order is sought to be\nquashed, if not arrayed as a party, the\napplication would not be maintainable as one\nof the relief of certiorari, in the absence of the\nconcerned tribunal or Court as a party, cannot\nbe granted. It has also been held that if the\nCourt or tribunal has not been impleaded as\nparty- respondent in the main writ petition,\nthen by merely impleading such Court or\ntribunal for the first time in letters patent\nappeal would not change the nature and\ncharacter of the proceeding before the learned\nSingle Judge and, therefore, intra-court appeal\nwould not be maintainable. To arrive at the\nsaid conclusion, the High Court has referred to\nMessrs.\nGhaio Mal & Sons v. State of Delhi and\nothers\n, Hari Vishnu Kamath (supra) and relied\nupon a four-Judge Bench judgment in Udit\nNarain Singh Malpaharia v. Addl. Member,\nBoard of Revenue.\"\n\n\"38. After so stating, the four-Judge Bench referred\nto English practice as recorded in Halsbury's\nLaws of England, Vol. 11, 3rd Edn. (Lord\nSimonds') and a Division Bench judgment of\nthe Bombay High Court in\nAhmedalli v. M.D.\nLalkaka\nand a Full Bench decision of Nagpur\nHigh Court in Kanglu Baula Kotwal v. Janpad\nSabha, Durg and summarized thus: (\nUdit\nNarain Singh Malpaharia\ncase, AIR p.790,\n*120* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npara 12)\n\"To summarise: in a writ of certiorari\nnot only the tribunal or authority whose order\nis sought to be quashed but also parties in\nwhose favour the said order is issued are\nnecessary parties. But it is in the discretion of\nthe court to add or implead proper parties for\ncompletely settling all the questions that may\nbe involved in the controversy either suo motu\nor on the application of a party to the writ or\nan application filed at the instance of such\nproper party.\"\n\n39. The High Court, as we find, relied on the\naforesaid decision to form the foundation that\nunless a Court or a tribunal is made a party,\nthe proceeding is not maintainable. What has\nbeen stated in Hari Vishnu Kamath (supra),\nwhich we have reproduced hereinbefore is that\nwhere plain question on issuing directions\narises, it is conceivable that there should be in\nexistence a person or authority to whom such\ndirections could be issued. The suggestion that\nnon-existence of a tribunal might operate as a\nbar to issue such directions is not correct as the\ntrue scope of certiorari is that it merely\ndemolishes the offending order and hence, the\npresence of the offender before the Court,\nthough proper is not necessary for the exercise\nof the jurisdiction or to render its determination\neffective.\n\n40.\nIn\nUdit Narain Singh\n(supra), the fulcrum of\nthe controversy was non- impleadment of the\npersons in whose favour the Board of Revenue\nhad passed a favourable order. There was\nviolation of fundamental principles of natural\njustice. A party cannot be visited with any kind\nof adverse order in a proceeding without he\nbeing arrayed as a party.\nAs we understand in\nHari Vishnu Kamath (supra), the seven-Judge\nBench opined that for issuance of writ of\n*121* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ncertiorari, a tribunal, for issue of purpose of\ncalling of record, is a proper party, and even if\nthe tribunal has ceased to exist, there would be\nsome one incharge of the tribunal from whom\nthe records can be requisitioned and who is\nbound in law to send the records. The larger\nBench has clearly stated that while issuing a\nwrit of certiorari, the Court merely demolishes\nthe defending order, the presence of the\noffender before the Court though proper but is\nnot necessary for exercise of jurisdiction. The\nsaid finding was recorded in the context of a\ntribunal.\n\n41. In this context, we may profitably refer to the\ndecision in Savitri Devi (supra) wherein a\nthree-Judge Bench, though in a different\ncontext, had observed thus:-\n\n\"14. Before parting with this case, it is\nnecessary for us to point out one aspect of the\nmatter which is rather disturbing. In the writ\npetition filed in the High Court as well as the\nspecial leave petition filed in this Court, the\nDistrict Judge, Gorakhpur and the 4th\nAdditional Civil Judge (Junior Division),\nGorakhpur are shown as respondents and in the\nspecial leave petition, they are shown as\ncontesting respondents. There was no necessity\nfor impleading the judicial officers who\ndisposed of the matter in a civil proceeding\nwhen the writ petition was filed in the High\nCourt; nor is there any justification for\nimpleading them as parties in the special leave\npetition and describing them as contesting\nrespondents. We do not approve of the course\nadopted by the petitioner which would cause\nunnecessary disturbance to the functions of the\njudicial officers concerned. They cannot be in\nany way equated to the officials of the\nGovernment. It is high time that the practice of\nimpleading judicial officers disposing of civil\nproceedings as parties to writ petitions under\n*122* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India or\nspecial leave petitions under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution of India was stopped. We are\nstrongly deprecating such a practice.\"\"\n\n\"43. As we notice, the decisions rendered in Hari\nVishnu Kamath (supra),\nUdit Narain Singh\n\n(supra) and Savitri Devi (supra) have to be\nproperly understood.\nIn Hari Vishnu Kamath\n(supra), the larger Bench was dealing with a\ncase that arose from Election Tribunal which\nhad ceased to exist and expressed the view how\nit is a proper party.\nIn\nUdit Narain Singh\n\n(supra), the Court was really dwelling upon the\ncontroversy with regard to the impleadment of\nparties in whose favour orders had been passed\nand in that context observed that tribunal is a\nnecessary party.\nIn Savitri Devi (supra), the\nCourt took exception to courts and tribunals\nbeing made parties. It is apposite to note here\nthat propositions laid down in each case has to\nbe understood in proper perspective. Civil\ncourts, which decide matters, are courts in the\nstrictest sense of the term. Neither the court nor\nthe Presiding Officer defends the order before\nthe superior court it does not contest. If the\nHigh Court, in exercise of its writ jurisdiction\nor revisional jurisdiction, as the case may be,\ncalls for the records, the same can always be\ncalled for by the High court without the Court\nor the Presiding Officer being impleaded as a\nparty. Similarly, with the passage of time there\nhave been many a tribunal which only\nadjudicate and they have nothing to do with the\nlis. We may cite few examples; the tribunals\nconstituted under the\nAdministrative Tribunals\nAct, 1985\n, the Custom, Excise & Service Tax\nAppellate Tribunal, the Income Tax Appellate\nTribunals, the Sales Tax Tribunal and such\nothers. Every adjudicating authority may be\nnomenclatured as a tribunal but the said\n*123* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nauthority(ies) are different that pure and simple\nadjudicating authorities and that is why they\nare called the authorities. An Income Tax\nCommissioner, whatever rank he may be\nholding, when he adjudicates, he has to be\nmade a party, for he can defend his order. He is\nentitled to contest. There are many authorities\nunder many a statute. Therefore, the\nproposition that can safely be culled out is that\nthe authorities or the tribunals, who in law are\nentitled to defend the orders passed by them,\nare necessary parties and if they are not\narrayed as parties, the writ petition can be\ntreated to be not maintainable or the court may\ngrant liberty to implead them as parties in\nexercise of its discretion. There are tribunals\nwhich are not at all required to defend their\nown order, and in that case such tribunals need\nnot be arrayed as parties. To give another\nexample:- in certain enactments, the District\nJudges function as Election Tribunals from\nwhose orders a revision or a writ may lie\ndepending upon the provisions in the Act. In\nsuch a situation, the superior court, that is the\nHigh Court, even if required to call for the\nrecords, the District Judge need not be a party.\n\nThus, in essence, when a tribunal or authority\nis required to defend its own order, it is to be\nmade a party failing which the proceeding\nbefore the High Court would be regarded as not\nmaintainable.\"\n\n67. He then points out\nSection 255(4)\nof the Income Tax\n\nAct, 1961, which is almost identical to\nSection 26\nof the\n\nAdministrative Tribunals Act, 1985. He refers to\nDynavision\n\nLtd. vs. Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and others\n, 2008 SCC\n*124* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nOnline Mad 1041 : (2008) 304 ITR 350 and adverts to\n\nparagraph Nos.9 to 11 and 13 to 15, which are as under:-\n\n\"9. As, there is a difference of opinion between the\nmembers of the Division Bench, they requested the\nPresident under\nsection 255(4)\nof the Act to\nconstitute a third member for resolving the\nopinion expressed by each one of them. According\nto the President, there is a difference of opinion\nwhile identifying the differences between the\nmembers of the Division Bench. As there is no\nuniformity even in identifying the points, the\nPresident has formulated the points of difference\nbetween the Division Bench-Members and\ndecided the case on the merits. Aggrieved by the\nsame, the petitioner has filed W.P. No. 7060 of\n2000 challenging the order of the third member.\n\n10. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\nsubmitted that the Third member has no right to\ngo beyond the scope of reference in a matter of\ndifference of opinion between the judicial member\nand the accountant member. He has to consider\nonly the difference of opinion stated by the\nmembers. So, the third member is wrong in\nformulating the questions on his own and\ndeciding the case as against the assessee. It is,\ntherefore, submitted that the order passed by the\nthird member is illegal and without justification\nand the same should be quashed. Learned counsel\nalso submitted that since the third member\nexceeded his jurisdiction, the order passed by him\nhas to be set aside with a direction to the third\nmember to reconsider the matter afresh and also\nfurther direction to the third member to consider\nonly the difference of opinion stated by the\nrespective members..\n\n11. Learned counsel appearing for the Revenue\nsubmitted that even though the third member re-\nframed the difference of opinion, the sum and sub\nstance of the issue involved is the same, therefore,\n*125* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe order of the third member is in conformity\nwith law and the same should be affirmed. She\nfurther stated that in view of the framing the new\nissues by the third member, she has no objection\nto remand the matter with a direction to the third\nmember to consider only the difference of opinion\nreferred to by the judicial member and the\naccountant member.\"\n\n\"13. From a reading of the above section makes\nit clear that whenever the members or Bench\ndiffer in opinion on any point, the point shall be\ndecided according to the opinion of the majority,\nif there is a majority. If the members are equally\ndivided, they shall state the point or points on\nwhich they differ, and the case shall be referred by\nthe President of the Appellate Tribunal for\nhearing on such point or points by one or more of\nthe other members of the Appellate Tribunal, and\nsuch point or points shall be decided according to\nthe opinion of the majority of the members of the\nAppellate Tribunal who have heard the case\nincluding the persons, who first heard it. The\norder of reference to the third member shall\ncontain the difference of opinion between the\nmembers of the Bench. The President or the third\nmember has no right to go beyond the scope of\nreference and they have to consider only the\ndifference of opinion stated by the members of the\nBench. Section 255(4) does not vest such power\nwith the President or the third member. They have\nalso no right to formulate the question on their\nown. Framing the question on their own goes\nbeyond the jurisdiction. The third member must\nconfine himself to the order of reference.\nTherefore, he has no right to enlarge, restrict and\nmodify and/or formulate any question of law on\nhis own on the difference of opinion referred to by\nthe members of the Tribunal. In this case, the\nJudicial and the accountant member had the\ndifference of opinion and formulated the\n*126* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nquestions. The Third Member in paragraph 2 of\nthe order has held as follows:\n\n\"2. When there is difference of opinion even\nwhile identifying the differences between the\nmembers of the Division Bench, what is to be\ndone was earlier decided by me as a third member\nin a case now found reported in\nChetna\nEnterprises v. ITO\n, [1999] 238 ITR (AT) 103\n(Patna). At page 125 of the reported decision,\nafter extracting the provision of\nsection 255(4)\nof\nthe Income-tax Act, I held that in such a case the\nsolution should be found out as follows:\n\n\"It would show that the point or points of\ndifference shall be referred by the President to a\nthird member. Suppose, if there is no unanimity\neven in identifying the point or points of difference\namong the differing members, just like in this\ncase, then I feel it is the duty of the President to\nidentify the real points of difference and refer\nthem to a third member whom he may appoint\nunder the powers given to him under section\n255(4).\"\n\nThen, I identified the real differing points\nbetween the differing members and formulated\nthem for decision of the third member, similarly\nfollowing the said precedent, which was not either\ndisapproved or set aside by the Hon'ble High\nCourt or Supreme Court, I feel that I should\nfollow the same procedure even in this case and,\ntherefore, I went through the whole record, orders\nof the differing members and I found out that\nfollowing are the points of difference between the\ndiffering Division Bench members and these\ndifferences are to be resolved by the third\nmember:\n\n1. Whether the assessee debited Rs. 4,59,10,736 to\nthe purchase account towards customs duty,\nadded the said sum to the closing stock value and\ndebited the said sum to the profit and loss\naccount?\n\n2. When did the liability to pay customs duty arise\n*127* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nto the assessee?\n\n3. Whether there was change of method of\naccounting adopted by the assessee while\naccounting customs duty liability in this\nassessment year?\n\n4. Whether out of Rs. 4,59,10,736, the assessee\npaid Rs. 3,34,13,672 between the date of close of\nthe accounting year and the date of filing return\nby the assessee under\nsection 139(1)\nof the\nIncome-tax Act for the assessment year 1990-91,\nand it is, the asses see was correctly allowed\ndeduction of Rs. 3,34,13,672 as customs duty paid\nunder\nsection 43B\nof the Income-tax Act ?\nand\n\n5. Whether the impugned sum of Rs. 1,24,97,664\nremained to be paid as customs duty and whether\nits disallowance under section 438 on the ground\nof non-payment within the time allowed under the\nprovisions of section 438 is correct under law ?\"\n\n14. The High Court of Madras, in the case of\nITO v.\nVice-President, ITAT\n, [1985] 155 ITR 310,\nconsidered the scope of\nsection 255(4)\nof the\nIncome-tax Act, 1961, wherein it has been held\nthat the power of the third member is confined to\ngiving of a decision on the points on which the\nmembers of the Tribunal had differed and which\nhad been formulated by them as the question for\nthe decision of the third member and held as\nfollows (page 314):\n\n\"Admittedly, in this case, the President of\nthe Appellate Tribunal has referred the matter to\nthe third member (Thiru D. Rangaswamy) to hear\non the point or points on which the two members\nof the Tribunal had differed and on the third\nmember giving his decision on the point or points\nreferred to it, the appeal should be taken to have\nbeen decided by the opinion of the majority of the\nmembers of the Appellate Tribunal who have\nheard the case including those who first heard it.\nThus, the power of the third member to whom the\n*128* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ncase is referred is confined to giving of a decision\non the point on which the members had differed\nand which has been formulated them as a\nquestion for the decision of a third member.\n\nIn this case, the third member has\nproceeded on the basis that the question referred\nby the two members of the Tribunal is wide\nenough to enable the assessee to raise additional\npoints and, therefore, the additional points\npressed by the assessee should be considered.\nEven so, we are of the view that the third member\nshould have pronounced his opinion on the point\nof difference as also on the additional points\nraised by the assessee. But without doing so, the\nthird member has remitted the matter to the\noriginal two members of the Tribunal for a fresh\ndecision. We are of the view that the third member,\nwho is functioning under\nsection 255(4)\nof the Act\ndoes not have such a power as to direct the two\nmembers of the Tribunal who had differed on the\npoint referred to the third member, to decide a\nparticular point or act in a particular manner.\nSuch a power vests only with an appellate or\nrevisional authorities, if there are any. The power\nof the third member to whom the points of\ndifference have been referred cannot act as if it\nwere an appellate authority over the two members\nof the Tribunal and direct them to rehear and\ndispose of the matter afresh. No doubt, the third\nmember, in this case, happened to be the Vice-\nPresident. But that will not clothe him with the\npower to give directions or remit the matters\nwhile functioning under\nsection 255(4)\nof the Act.\nThe learned Advocate General appearing for the\nassessee would say that\nsection 255(4)\nof the Act\nshould be read in conjunction with\nsection 254(1)\n\nof the Act which deals with the powers of the\nAppellate Tribunal. According to him, the third\nmember to whom the points of difference have\nbeen referred, should be taken to have all the\npowers of the Tribunal under section 254(1) and\n*129* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nas such the Tribunal can pass such orders as it\nthinks fit. Therefore, the third member has got the\npower to pass any order as he thinks fit. The\nsubmission of the learned Advocate-General is in\ndirect conflict with the language and the object\nbehind\nsection 255(4)\nof the Act. When section\n255(4) says that the third member shall decide the\npoints of difference referred to him and the\ndecision of the Tribunal will be as per the\nmajority opinion, the third member is expected to\ngive his decision, whatever it is, so that the\nmajority opinion could be determined for the\npurpose of disposal of the appeal before the\nTribunal. If, based on the language of\nsection\n254(1)\nof the Act, we were to hold that the third\nmember can pass any order he likes, then such an\norder will not serve the purpose for which\nsection\n255(4)\nof the Act was introduced in the statute\nbook. It is well established that the provisions of\nthe Act have to be construed harmoniously so as\nto give effect to all the provisions of the Act and to\ncarry out the objects sought to be achieved by the\nvarious statutory provisions. In this case, the third\nmember has not chosen to give his opinion one\nway or the other either on the point of dispute,\ni.e., on the mode of computation of the capital\ngains or on the new points urged by the assessee\nbefore him. If the third member has entertained\nthe new points and has given his opinion one way\nor the other, as also on the point of dispute\nreferred to it, it can be said that he has acted\nwithin his jurisdiction, though it may be open to\nthe Revenue to contend before the appropriate\nforum that the third member should not have\nentertained the new points which were not urged\nbefore the two members of the original Tribunal.\nIn this case, as already stated, without giving his\ndecision on any of the points the third member has\nmerely remitted the matter to the two members of\nthe Tribunal for a fresh consideration on all the\npoints. We do not see how the third member to\n*130* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nwhom the point of dispute is referred under\nsection 255(4) can claim to have any larger power\nthan the two members who originally constituted\nthe Tribunal. The third member has no higher\npower or jurisdiction than the members who\noriginally constituted the Tribunal, and therefore,\nthe remit order directing them to rehear the matter\nwill be clearly outside the jurisdiction of the third\nmember. Hence, we cannot sustain legally the\norder of the third member, in this case, remitting\nthe matter to the two members of the original\nTribunal without expressing any opinion on the\nquestion which he had to consider.\"\n\n15. Similar view was also taken by the Allahabad\nHigh Court, in the case of\nJan Mohammed v. CIT\n,\n(1953] 23 ITR 15, and considered the scope of the\nprovision of\nsection 5A(7)\nof the Act,\ncorresponding to section 255(4) of the new Act,\nwherein it was held that the third member can\ndecide only the point that had been referred to\nhim and he cannot formulate the new points\nhimself and reads as follows (page 25):\n\n\"The third member could, therefore, decide\nonly the point that had been referred to him and\nhe could not formulate a new point for himself on\nwhich he could base his decision. It appears to us\nto be further clear from a reading of the sub-\nsection quoted above that, after the decision of the\npoint or points referred to him by the third\nMember, the case should go back to the original\nTribunal because so far as we can see, the third\nmember has not been given any right to decide the\nappeal. According to section 5A(6) of the Income-\ntax Act, the appeal must be decided by the\nTribunal which must consist of a Bench of not less\nthan two members. As we have already said, the\npoint referred to the third member was whether\nthere could be a presumption legally drawn from\nthe materials on the record that the bus belonged\nto the 'appellant', and on that point the third\n*131* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nmember having agreed with Shri Kalbe Abbas\nthat no such presumption could be legally drawn,\nthe majority view was in favour of the assessee.\nThe last part of\nsection 5A(7)\nof the Act provides\nthat the point or points have to be decided\naccording to the opinion of the majority of the\nmembers of the Tribunal who had heard the case\nincluding those who had first heard it. After the\nopinion of the third member had been obtained\nthe case should have gone back to the Tribunal\nfor its final orders.\"\"\n\n68. He has then referred to H. Chandunmul vs.\n\nCommissioner of Income Tax, 1953 The Indian Law Reports\n\n(Vol.XXXII) Patna Series 445. His contention, therefore, is that\n\nif\nSection 26\nis to be invoked, it is not for this Court to frame the\n\npoints/ divergent opinions, which is for the members of the\n\nTribunal to formalize. Unless the members set out the points of\n\ndifference between the two, this Court cannot frame such points\n\nfor reference to the third Member under\nSection 26\n. As has been\n\nheld in H. Chandunmul (supra), even the Chairperson/ President\n\ncannot frame the points and it has to be left to the members of\n\nthe Tribunal who have to forward the points on which they differ,\n\nto the Chairperson for adjudication.\n\n*132* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n69. In the above backdrop, Shri Rajadhyaksha contends\n\nthat if the DDCs desire to invoke\nSection 26\nof the Act, they\n\nwould have to implead the Tribunal as a Respondent in the\n\npresent proceedings. This Court will have to issue notices to the\n\nTribunal calling upon it to explain as to why the points were not\n\nformulated and whether,\nSection 26\nwas lost sight off. After\n\nconsidering the explanation of the Tribunal, this Court can\n\nconclude on the issue referable to\nSection 26\nof the Act. He,\n\ntherefore, sums up on this issue by contending that the petitions\n\npreferred by the DDCs will have to be dismissed for non joinder\n\nof parties.\n\nSubmissions of Shri Rajadhyaksha on the 1977 Rules\n\n70. Shri Rajadhyaksha has contended that Rule 13(5) is\n\nthe determination test for deciding the seniority inter-se the\n\nTahasildar [on promotion to Deputy Collector (PDC)] and the\n\nDDC. The promotional ladder begins from the Tahasildar-\n\nDeputy Collector- Deputy Collector (Selection Grade)-\n\nAdditional Collector- Additional Collector (Selection Grade) and\n\nthen the Collector.\n\n*133* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n71. He contends that the terms 'permanent' post,\n\n'temporary' post and 'officiating' posts are not defined under the\n\n1977 Rules. He adverts to Rule 9(40) \"permanent post\" and\n\n9(53) \"temporary post\" of the Maharashtra Civil Services\n\n(General Conditions of Services) Rules, 1981 (for short \"the\n\nMCS Rules of 1981\"), which read as under:-\n\n\"(40) Permanent Post means a post carrying a\ndefinite rate of pay sanctioned without limit of\ntime.\"\n\n\"(53) Temporary post means a post carrying a\ndefinite rate of pay sanctioned for a limited\ntime.\"\n\n\"Note- Substantive appointments to\ntemporary posts should be made in a limited\nnumber of cases only, as for example, when\nposts are, to all intents and purposes, quasi-\npermanent or when they have been sanctioned\nfor a period of not less than, or there is reason\nto believe that they will not terminate within a\nperiod of three years. In all other cases,\nappointments in temporary posts should be\nmade in an officiating capacity only.\n\nInstruction.- The benefit of substantive\nappointments to temporary posts contemplated\nin the above note should not be allowed to be\nenjoyed by more than one person\nsimultaneously. Therefore, where a Government\nservant has already been appointed\nsubstantively to a temporary post and there is a\ntemporary interruption in his tenure of the post,\nit would not be proper to appoint another\nGovernment servant substantively to the post\nduring such temporary interruption. For this\npurpose, interruptions which are likely to last\nfor less than 3 years may be treated as\n*134* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ntemporary. It follows, therefore, that where a\nGovernment servant is already appointed\nsubstantively to temporary post a second\nGovernment servant should not be appointed\nsubstantively to it unless the previous holder of\nthe post has been transferred from it\npermanently or unless he has been transferred\ntemporarily and there is reason to believe that\nhe will remain absent from the post for a period\nof not less than three years.\"\n\n72. According to him, the definition of 'continuous\n\nservice' under Rule 2(d) of the 1977 Rules read with the proviso\n\nthere below and Rule 2(i) defining \"fortuitous service\", would\n\nmean that the service between the commencement of officiating\n\nas a Deputy Collector until the deemed date is granted.\n\n73. He refers to clause 5.2 of the impugned final list\n\ndated 31.12.2020 and points out that the State Government has\n\ntaken a conscious decision that it would not take a review of the\n\nPDC under Rule 12. This categoric stand renders the select list as\n\ndefined under Rule 2(n), final. He then refers to the definition of\n\n'cadre' under Rule 9(5) and 'officiate' under Rule 9(35) of the\n\nMCS Rules, 1981.\n\n74. He further contends that the quota of Deputy\n*135* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nCollectors would include the sanctioned strength as well as the\n\nadhoc/ temporary appointments by way of promotions of the\n\nTahasildars. He adverts to the judgment of the Tribunal delivered\n\nin O.A. No.526/ 2004 dated 17.04.2008 wherein, the Tribunal\n\nhas concluded in paragraphs 55 and 56 that the 'quota' would\n\ninclude both these categories. With this submission, he contends\n\nthat the rule of appointing the Direct Deputy Collectors in\n\nbetween 35% to 50% and commensurate appointments on\n\ntemporary promotions of the PDC, would be included in the said\n\nquota. Hence, the number of posts of Deputy Collectors would\n\nnot be restricted to 514 for the period 1999 upto 2012.\n\n75. He has relied upon the judgment delivered in\nO.P.\n\nSingla and another vs. Union of India and others\n, (1984) 4\n\nSCC 450 and has relied upon paragraph Nos.1 to 3, 8 and 16 to\n\n18, which read as under:-\n\n\"1. Once again, we are back to the irksome\nquestion of inter se seniority between\npromotees and direct recruits. The contestants,\nthis time, are judicial officers of Delhi. Our\nfamiliarity, generally, with the difficulties in the\nway of judicial officers and our awareness of\ntheir just aspirations make our task difficult\nand sensitive.\n\n2. The conclusion to which we have come in this\n*136* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\njudgment is not different from the one reached\nby our learned Brother Sabyasachi Mukharji.\nIn this Judgment, Brother Mukharji has\ndiscussed, more fully, the various aspects of this\nmatter as also the decisions which were cited\nbefore us. Our reasons for writing this separate\nopinion are, the general importance of this\ncase. the fact that it concerns the higher\njudiciary and our respectful disagreement with\nBrother Mukharji on the interpretation of some\nof the provisions with which we are concerned\nin these Writ Petitions.\n\n3. There are many decisions bearing upon the\nfamiliar controversy between promotees and\ndirect recruits and this will be one more.\nPerhaps, just another. Since those various\ndecisions have not succeeded in finding a\nsatisfactory solution to the controversy, we\nwould do well by confining our attention to the\nlanguage and scheme of the rules which are\nunder scrutiny herein, instead of seeking to\nderive a principle of universal application to\nthe cases like those before us. Previous\njudgments of this Court are, of course, binding\nto the extent that they are relevant and they\ncannot be ignored. But, if they turn upon their\nown facts, the general set-up of the particular\nservice, its historical development and the\nwords of the impugned provisions, no useful\npurpose will be served by discussing those\ncases at length, merely to justify an observation\nat the end that they have no application and are\ndistinguishable.\"\n\n\"8. Rules 7 and 8 which are crucial to the\ncontroversy between the promotees and direct\nrecruits read thus :\n\n\"Rule 7- Regular Recruitment:-\n\nRecruitment after the initial recruitment shall\nbe made :\n\n(a) by promotion on the basis of selection from\n*137* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nmembers of the Delhi Judicial Service, who\nhave completed not less than 10 years of\nService in the Delhi Judicial Service.\n\n(b) by direct recruitment from the Bar.\n\nProvided that not more than 1/3rd of the\nsubstantive posts in the Service shall be held by\ndirect recruits.\"\n\n\"Rule 8-(1) The inter-se seniority of members of\nthe Delhi Judicial Service promoted to the\nService shall be the same as in the Delhi\nJudicial Service.\n\n(2) The seniority of direct recruits vis-a-vis\npromotees shall be determined in the order of\nrotation of vacancies between the direct\nrecruits and promotees based on the quotas of\nvacancies reserved for both categories by Rule\n7 provided that the first available vacancy will\nbe filled by a direct recruit and the next two\nvacancies by promotees and so on.\"\"\n\n\"16. Logically, we must begin this inquiry with the\nquestion as to the interpretation of the proviso\nto Rule 7. Does that proviso prescribe a quota\nor does it merely provide for a ceiling ? In\nother words, does the proviso require that, at\nany given point of time, 1/3rd of the substantive\nposts in the Service shall be reserved for direct\nrecruits or does it only stipulate that the posts\nheld by direct recruits shall not be more than\n1/3rd of the total number of substantive posts in\nthe Service? The proviso reads thus:\n\n\"Provided that not more than 1/3rd of the\nsubstantive posts in the Service shall be held by\ndirect recruits.\"\n\nThis language is more consistent with the\ncontention of the promotees that the proviso\nmerely prescribes, by way of imposing a\nceiling, that the direct recruits shall not hold\nmore than 1/3rd of the substantive posts.\nExperience shows that any provision which is\nintended to prescribe a quota, generally\n*138* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nprovides that, for example, \"1/3rd of the\nsubstantive posts shall be filled in by direct\nrecruitment.\" A quota provision does not use\nthe negative language, as the proviso in the\ninstant case does, that \"not more than\" one-\nthird of the substantive posts in the Service\nshall be held by direct recruits.\n\n17. If the matter were to rest with the proviso, its\ninterpretation would have to be that it does not\nprescribe a quota for direct recruits : it only\nenables the appointment of direct recruits to\nsubstantive posts so that, they shall not hold\nmore than 1/3rd of the total number of\nsubstantive posts in the Service. However, it is\nwell recognised that, when a rule or a section is\na part of an integral scheme, it should not be\nconsidered or construed in isolation. One must\nhave regard to the scheme of the fasciculus of\nthe relevant rules or sections in order to\ndetermine the true meaning of any one or more\nof them. An isolated consideration of a\nprovision leads to the risk of some other inter-\nrelated provision becoming otiose or devoid of\nmeaning. That makes it necessary to call\nattention to the very next rule, namely, rule 8. It\nprovides by clause 2 that :\n\n\"The seniority of direct recruits vis-a-vis\npromotees shall be determined in the order of\nrotation of vacancies between the direct\nrecruits and promotees based on the quotas of\nvacancies reserved for both categories by Rule\n7 provided that the first available vacancy will\nbe filled by a direct recruit and the next two\nvacancies by promotees and so on.\"\n\nThis provision leaves no doubt that the\noverall scheme of the rules and the true\nintendment of the proviso to Rule 7 is that 1/3rd\nof the substantive posts in the Service must be\nreserved for direct recruits. Otherwise, there\nwould neither be any occasion nor any\n*139* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\njustification for rotating vacancies between\ndirect recruits and promotees. Rule 8 (2), which\ndeals with fixation of seniority amongst the\nmembers of the Service, provides, as it were, a\nkey to the interpretation of the proviso to Rule 7\nby saying that the proviso prescribes \"quotas\"\nand reserves vacancies for both categories. The\nlanguage of the proviso to Rule 7 is certainly\nnot felicitous and is unconventional if its\nintention was to prescribe a quota for direct\nrecruits. But the proviso, as I have stated\nearlier, must be read along with Rule 8 (2)\nsince the two provisions are inter-related. Their\ncombined reading yields but one result, that the\nproviso prescribes a quota of 1/3rd for direct\nrecruits.\n\n18. The process of reading the Rules as parts of a\nconnected whole does not end with Rules 7 and\n\n8. Rules 16 and 17 are also relevant for the\npresent purpose and have, indeed, an important\nbearing on the question of reservation of\nvacancies for direct recruits to the extent of\none-third of the substantive posts in the Service.\nClause (1) of Rule 16 confers power upon the\nAdministrator to create temporary posts in the\nService. By clause (2) of Rule 16, such posts\nare required to be filled, in consultation with\nthe High Court, from amongst the members of\nthe Delhi Judicial Service, that is to say, the\npromotees. Rule 17, which is in the nature of a\nnon-obstante provision, provides that not\nwithstanding anything contained in the Rules,\nthe, Administrator may, in consultation with the\nHigh Court, fill substantive vacancies in the\nService by making temporary appointments\nthereto from amongst the members of the Delhi\nJudicial Service. The position which emerges\nfrom the provisions contained in Rules 16 and\n17 is that it is permissible to create temporary\nposts in the Service and, even substantive\nvacancies in the Service can be filled by making\n*140* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ntemporary appointments. The twofold\nrestriction on this dual power is that the High\nCourt must be consulted and such appointments\nmust be made from amongst the promotees\nonly. If temporary appointment to the Service,\neither in temporary posts or in substantive\nvacancies, can be made within the framework\nof the Rules and have to be made, if at all, from\namongst the promotees and promotees only, the\nquota rule contained in the proviso to Rule 7\nmust inevitably break down when such\nappointments are made. The simple reason\nleading to that consequence is that direct\nrecruits cannot be appointed either to\ntemporary posts in the Service or to substantive\nvacancies in the Service which are filled in by\nmaking temporary appointments. Thus, even\nthough the proviso to Rule 7 prescribes a quota\nof one-third for direct recruits, Rules 16 and 17\npermit the non- observance of the quota rule in\nthe circumstances stated in these rules.\"\n\n76. He refers to paragraph Nos.2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 13 and 14\n\nin\nV. Bhasker Rao and others vs. State of A.P. and others\n,\n\n(1993) 3 SCC 307, which read as under:-\n\n\"2. The recruitment to the Andhra Pradesh Higher\nJudicial Service (the Service) is governed by\nthe Rules called \"The Andhra Pradesh State\nHigher Judicial Service Special Rules\" (the\nSpecial Rules). Rules 1, 2, 4 and 6 of the\nSpecial Rules which are relevant are as under:\n\n\"Rule 1. Constitution:- The service shall consist\nof the following categories:-\n\nCategory-1 :- District and Sessions Judges 1st\nGrade.\n\n*141* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nCategory-II :- District and Sessions Judges,\nSecond Grade including Chairman, Andhra\nPradesh Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chief\nJudge, City Civil Court, Additional Chief\nJudge, City Civil Court, Chief Judge, Court of\nsmall Causes, Chief City Magistrate,\nChairman, Tribunal for Disciplinary\nProceedings, Presiding Officers, Labour Courts\nand Addl. District and Sessions Judges.\nRule 2. Appointment :- (a) Appointment to\nCategory-I shall be made by promotion from\nCategory-II and appointment to Category-II\nshall be made:-\n\n(i) by transfer from among:-\n\n(a) Sub-Judges in the Andhra State Judicial\nService; or in the Hyderabad State Judicial\nService; and\n\n(ii) by direct recruitment from the Bar:\n\nProvided that 33-1/3% of the total number of\npermanent posts shall be filed or reserved to be\nfilled by direct recruitment.\n\nExplanation:- In the determination of 33-1/3%\nof the total number of permanent posts,\nfractions exceeding one-half shall be counted\nas one and other fractions shall be disregarded.\n\n(b) All promotions shall be made on grounds of\nmerit and ability, seniority being considered\nonly when merit and ability are approximately\nequal.\n\nRule 4.

Seniority:- The seniority of a person\nappointed to Category 1 or Category 2 shall be\ndetermined with reference to the date from\nwhich he was continuously on duty in that\ncategory.\"\"\n\n\"4. On a plain reading of the Special Rules the\nsalient features of the Service can be culled out\n*142* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nas under:\n\n(1) Rule 1 provides for the constitution of\nthe Service. All the posts of District and\nSessions Judges Second grade created from\ntime to time are part of the Service. The natural\ncorollary is that the Service consists of\npermanent as well as temporary posts.\n\n(2) The recruitment to Category-II of the\nservice is by transfer from amongst the\nSubordinate Judges and also by direct recruits\nfrom the Bar.\n\n(3) 33 1/3% of the total number of\npermanent posts in Category-II of the Service\nare to be filled by way of direct recruitment.\n\n(4) The seniority under Rule 6 is to be\ndetermined with reference to the date from\nwhich a person is continuously on duty.\n\nWhether the person is continuously on duty\nagainst a temporary post or permanent post is\nof no consequence. A person is entitled to the\nfixation of his seniority on the basis of\ncontinuous length of service rendered either\nagainst permanent post or temporary post.\"\n\n\"7. Mr. P.P. Rao, learned counsel for the petitioners\nhas raised the following contentions for our\nconsideration:\n\n(1) That the Service consists of only\npermanent posts under the Special Rules. There\nis no provision under the Special Rules for\nadding temporary posts to the cadre. The\nappointment of respondents to the posts of\nDistrict and Sessions Judges Second grade on\ntemporary basis can at best be treated under\nrule 10(a)(i) of the State Rules.\n\n(2) The temporary service rendered by\nrespondents.4 to 16 being outside the cadre\ncannot be counted towards seniority.\n\n(3) Proviso to Rule 2 and Rule 6 of the\nSpecial Rules have to be read together and\ndoing so the permanent vacancies having been\n*143* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nmade available for respondents 4 to 16 in the\nyear 1983 their service prior to that date\ncannot be counted towards seniority.\"\n\n\"10. Mr. Madava Reddy then contended that the\npetitioners were appointed in the years 1981\nand since then till the year 1988 twelve\nseniority lists have been published showing the\npetitioners below respondents 4 to 16. At no\npoint of time they challenged the seniority lists\nin the Court. Even when the writ petitions filed\nby Chalapathi and others were pending they\ndid not intervene before the High Court. The\npetitioners, according to Mr. Madava Reddy,\nare guilty of gross delay and latches and as\nsuch are not entitled to get relief by way of this\npetition under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution of\nIndia.\"\n\n\"11. We see considerable force in both the\ncontentions raised by Mr. Madava Reddy. We\nare, however, of the view that it would be in the\nlarger interest of the Service to dispose of this\npetition on merits.\"\n\n\"13. Having taken the view that the Service under\nthe Special Rules consists of permanent as well\nas temporary posts the second contention of Mr.\nRao looses its ground. Temporary, posts of\nDistrict and Sessions Judges Second grade\nbeing part of the Service the seniority has to be\ncounted on the basis of length of service\nincluding the service against a temporary post.\n\n14. The third contention of Mr. Rao is mentioned to\nbe rejected in view of Rule 6 of the Special\nRules. Rule 6 of the Special Rules is in no way\ndependent on proviso to Rule 2 of the Special\nRules. Both are to be operative independently.\nIn the scheme of the rules the seniority rule is\nnot dependent on the quota Rule. Quota has\nbeen provided for the direct recruits only\n*144* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nagainst permanent posts. The seniority rule\npermits the counting of total period of service\nfrom the date a person is on duty against a post\nin the category. Even though, the petitioners\nwere appointed substantively to the service\nearlier to respondents 4 to 16 but in view of\nRule 6 they cannot be declared senior on the\nbasis of continuous length of service against\ntemporary as well as permanent posts\nrespondents 4 to 16 have been rightly given\nseniority above the petitioners.\"\n\n77.

Deshpande, the learned Advocate\n\nrepresenting the Petitioners in Writ Petition No.9163/2022\n\n(Samiksha Chandrakar and Pandurang Kulkarni), besides his\n\noral submissions, has tendered his Written Notes. The gist of his\n\nsubmissions is as under:-\n\n(a) The Government Resolution dated 31.12.2020\n\ndetermining the cadre strength has not been challenged.\n\nHowever, it was incorrectly stated that it was challenged in TA\n\nNo.1/2021. For this incorrect statement, Shri Deshpande tenders\n\nan unconditional apology.\n\n(b) The cadre strength is irrelevant because the Rules\n\nrefer to 'permanent posts,' not 'cadre strength'. Thus, whether\n\nthe cadre strength is 514 or 5014, it does not impact the case.\n\nThis Court has to determine only 'permanent post'.\n\n(c) The GR dated 31.12.2020 determining cadre\n\nstrength year wise from 1980 onwards, retrospectively, is\n*146* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nirrelevant. Any retrospective determination of cadre strength or\n\nincrease in cadre strength, is disapproved by the Honourable\n\nSupreme Court in\nUnion of India vs. Hemraj Singh Chauhan\n,\n\n(2010) 4 SCC 290.\n\n(d) Merely because PDCs do not challenge the\n\ndetermination of cadre strength retrospectively, will not\n\nautomatically validate the order of determining cadre strength,\n\nretrospectively.\n\n(e) The permanent posts of Deputy Collectors were 413\n\nas of 11.08.1980. The Tribunal erroneously presumed 514 posts.\n\nThe Government failed to provide documents justifying this\n\nincrease. The PDC never agreed the figure of permanent 514\n\nposts.\n\n(f) 26 posts of Leave Reserve Deputy Collectors have\n\nbeen abolished and 25 posts of Additional Collectors' cadre have\n\nbeen created and thus, the total number of permanent posts in the\n\nyear 1992, were 383.\n\n(g) The Government has come with a specific case that\n\n514 posts of Deputy Collectors include 'permanent posts' as well\n\nas 'temporary posts' in the cadre, which in fact is a logical stand,\n\nwhich has not been accepted and endorsed by the Tribunal.\n\n*147* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n(h) The prejudice that is caused to the PDCs is because\n\nthe Government has considered the 'cadre strength' and\n\n'permanent posts' as synonyms, due to which the number of\n\n'permanent posts' has suddenly increased from 383 in the year\n\n1995 to 514 in 1999. The Government is not able to substantiate\n\nthis sudden increase in the 'permanent posts'.\n\n(i) Since the Administrative Tribunal has categorically\n\nrecorded a finding that, the promotions of the petitioners herein\n\nare neither 'adhoc' nor by way of 'stop gap arrangement' or in\n\nbreach of the Rules, as a necessary corollary thereof, the entire\n\nservice rendered by the petitioners will have to be counted for the\n\npurpose of seniority.\n\n(j) Despite acknowledging the Petitioners' valid\n\npromotions, the Tribunal did not appropriately address the\n\nseniority list, resulting in contradictions.\n\n(k) Attempts were made by the PDCs to submit\n\nrelevant documents demonstrating the increase in permanent\n\nposts, but the Government did not produce them. Though some\n\nof the documents were produced by the Government, same do\n\nnot deal with conversion of the posts of Deputy Collectors into\n\n'permanent posts', but they deal with creation of posts of Deputy\n*148* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nCollectors on 'temporary basis'.\n\n(l) The Petitioners respect this Court's decision not to\n\ncall for additional records from the Tribunal.\n\n(m) One Mr.Waman Kadam, who was senior to\n\nPetitioner No.2 (Pandurang Kulkarni) was given a deemed date\n\nof promotion vide the order dated 24.06.2010. It is only and only\n\nwhen, the junior is promoted in a substantive capacity, the\n\nquestion of deemed date comes into play, and not otherwise.\n\nTherefore, on this count as well, promotions of the Petitioners\n\ncannot be considered to be either 'adhoc' or 'fortuitous'.\n\n(n) Government circulars dated 11.06.1993 and\n\n06.06.2002 and the meeting proceedings dated 14.09.2009,\n\nconfirm that the Petitioners' promotions were substantive, not\n\n'adhoc'.\n\n(o) The case of Mr. Jairam Vinayak Deshpande decided\n\nby the Tribunal at the Principal Seat in Original Application\n\nNo.573/1999 supports the Petitioners' contentions that their\n\npromotions were not 'adhoc'.\n\n(p) On 15.04.1999, the DPC was properly convened\n\nunder the Government Resolution dated 03.03.1999, for\n\nconsidering the claims of the eligible Tahasildars for promotion\n*149* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nto the posts of Deputy Collectors, which culminated in\n\npromotions of the Petitioners, on 08th and 9th July, 1999. As such,\n\nthe Petitioners' promotions followed proper procedures, making\n\nthe claim of fortuitous promotions untenable.\n\n(q) The Tribunal's finding regarding ineligibility of the\n\nPetitioners to be considered for promotion, lacks merit, as it\n\nignored substantial affidavits and evidence on record.\n\n(r) The Petitioners never feared reversion. Therefore,\n\nthe observations of the Tribunal about reversion, are absolutely\n\nout of context.\n\n(s) In so far as the nomination of IAS is concerned, the\n\ncareer-graph in the cadre of Deputy Collectors is significant and\n\nnot merely the career-graph of Additional Collectors. This fact\n\nhas been lost sight of by the Administrative Tribunal.\n\n(t) Loss of opportunity to be considered for IAS\n\nnomination is indeed a cause, which was required to be taken\n\ninto consideration by the Administrative Tribunal. However, it\n\nhaving failed to consider the same, intervention of this Hon'ble\n\nCourt is inevitable.\n\n(u) Once the Tribunal disapproves the method of\n\ndetermining seniority impugned before it, as an inevitable\n*150* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nconsequence thereof, the impugned seniority list must have been\n\nquashed and set aside. Seniority in the cadre of Deputy\n\nCollectors continues to assume significance, till an incumbent\n\nenters in IAS cadre.\n\n(v) If there is an illegality in determination of seniority,\n\nthe question of adjusting equities becomes absolutely irrelevant.\n\nAs such, the Tribunal is not expected to adjust the equities, as it\n\ndoes not have any such powers akin to the powers of the\n\nHonourable Supreme Court under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution\n\nof India.\n\n(w) In the process of satisfying everybody, although the\n\nAdministrative Tribunal disapproved the method of preparing\n\nseniority list and holding the appointments of the Petitioners to\n\nbe in a substantive capacity, declining to set aside the impugned\n\nseniority list, is indeed a blunder, warranting intervention of this\n\nCourt to subserve the ends of justice and also to set the things in\n\norder by appropriately issuing directions to remove absurdity in\n\nthe impugned decision.\n\n(x) Though the Tribunal did not quash the impugned\n\nseniority list, but directed the State Government to remove the\n\nremark 'fortuitous service' against the names of the incumbents\n*151* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nat Serial Nos.582 to 700. This has resulted in yet another irony,\n\ninasmuch as, junior incumbents to the Petitioners become regular\n\nbefore the Petitioners and the seniors continue to be adhoc.\n\n(y) The learned Member (Administration) had no\n\njustification to record the findings contrary to the pleadings on\n\nrecord, once he is a party to the decision rendered with\n\nconsensus.\n\n(z) Whether, at any point of time during last 20 years or\n\nmore, inclusion of Petitioner No.2 or any of the Petitioners was\n\never a subject matter of challenge before any of the Court or\n\nForum and a candid answer to the query is 'NO'. Therefore, the\n\nissue cannot be permitted to be opened after 20 long years,\n\nduring which the Respondents have chosen to accept the\n\nposition, without a slightest protest thereto.\n\n(aa) Direct Recruits were given deemed date of\n\npromotion in the cadre of Deputy Collectors much latter in point\n\nof time, than the conferment of Selection Grade on the\n\nPetitioners promotees. Never ever grant of Selection Grade to the\n\nPetitioners PDC was the subject matter of challenge, and\n\ntherefore, surreptitious change in the approach of the\n\nGovernment in the year 2018 or there about, and an attempt to\n*152* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nadvocate the cause of the direct recruits, is beyond\n\ncomprehension of a man of ordinary prudence.\n\n(bb) If the permanent posts were 514 since long, then\n\nthere was no necessity of appointing the Petitioners as Tahsildars.\n\nHaving regard to the number of vacancies available then, from\n\nday one in the year 1994, the Petitioners promotees will have to\n\nbe considered or treated as Deputy Collectors. This has a\n\nsignificance with Sub Rule 2 of Rule 4 of 1977 Rules, which\n\nrequires the Government to determine the 'permanent posts' in\n\nthe cadre in advance, so as to send a requisition to the Public\n\nService Commission for selecting particular number of\n\ncandidates.\n\n79. We had raised certain queries, which are reflected in\n\nour order dated 28.06.2024. The learned Advocate Shri A.S.\n\nDeshpande submitted that the Petitioners (original Applicants)\n\nare unable to locate from the impugned judgment, despite\n\nreading it over and over again, any such finding concluding that\n\nthe Applicants are not aggrieved parties. All the prayers put forth\n\nby them have been considered by the Tribunal, except the prayer\n\nfor quashing the impugned seniority list. He adds that, however,\n*153* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe Tribunal has observed that the Applicants do not have a\n\nsurviving cause of action. This conclusion was founded on the\n\nstatement made on behalf of the State Government in it's\n\naffidavit in reply dated 01.02.2022 filed by Mr.Madhav Veer, that\n\nnone of the Applicants or the Respondents before the Tribunal\n\nwould be reverted and hence, the Tribunal held that the\n\nApplicants do not have a surviving cause of action.\n\n80. Shri Deshpande further submits that the seniority list\n\ndated 31.12.1998, has attained finality and there has been no\n\nchallenge to the same. The circular dated 29.06.2010 is a\n\ntestimony of the said seniority list being crystallized. This has\n\nalso been reiterated in the impugned seniority list vide paragraph\n\nNos.7.1 and 7.2. Paragraph Nos.11 and 20 of the affidavit in\n\nreply of the State Government before the Tribunal crystallize the\n\nsaid issue.\n\n81. Shri Rajadhyakshya, the learned Senior Advocate,\n\nsubmits that it was the statement of the State Government before\n\nthe Tribunal that none of the Applicants would be reverted. He\n\nsubmits that the Petition filed by Nitin Gunaji Mahajan (Writ\n*154* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nPetition No.12699/2022) concerns the issue as to how the\n\nseniority list in the cadre of Deputy Collectors, which includes\n\nPDC and DDC, ought to be compiled when the class of PDC and\n\nDDC have merged for the first time for the purpose of the\n\nseniority. He points out that the Tribunal has held in the\n\nimpugned judgment (paragraph Nos.73-74) that, \"The method\n\nadopted by Respondent No.1 to reckon the seniority of PDC from\n\nthe date of their absorption in the permanent posts is apparently\n\ncontrary to the provisions in the Recruitment Rules. We,\n\ntherefore, disapprove the same and declare it to be invalid and\n\nunsustainable.\"\n\n82. With regard to the fate of the seniority list of Deputy\n\nCollectors dated 31.12.1998, Shri Rajadhyakshya submits that\n\nthe same has been finalized on 29.06.2010, which is apparent\n\nfrom the circular dated 31.12.2020 (clauses 7.1 and 7.2) and\n\nparagraphs 11 and 12 of the affidavit in reply filed by the State.\n\n83. The learned Senior Advocate Shri Apte confirms the\n\ncontentions of Shri Deshpande and Shri Rajadhyakshya. He\n\nfurther points out the circular dated 25.04.2014 and submits that\n*155* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthe combined seniority list for the period 01.01.1999 to\n\n31.12.2000 was confirmed. Earlier seniority lists have been\n\nreferred to while concluding below paragraph No.3 as under:-\n\n\"३. सदर ज्येष्ठतासूची म.ना.से. (ज्येष्ठतेचे विनियमन) १९८२ मध्ये\n\nविहित केलेली सर्वसाधारण तत्वे आणि खालील बाबी विचारात घेऊन तयार\n\nकरण्यात आली आहे.\n\n१) ज्येष्ठतासूचीत नमूद अधिका-यांपैकी सरळ सेवा प्रविष्ट उप\n\nजिल्हाधिका-यांची महाराष्ट्र लोकसेवा आयोगाने निश्चित केलेल्या गुणवत्ता\n\nयादीप्रमाणे त्यांची आपआपसातील ज्येष्ठता राखण्यासाठी त्यांना\n\nसमायोजित दिनांक देऊन ज्येष्ठता निश्चित करण्यात आली आहे.\n\n२) पदोन्नत अधिका-यांच्या बाबतीत सामान्यतः त्यांच्या रुजू\n\nदिनांकानुसार तथापि निवडसूचीतील क्रम कायम ठे वून ज्येष्ठता निश्चित\n\nकरण्यात आलेली आहे. परंतु एखाद्या ज्येष्ठ अधिका-यास पदोन्नतीचे आदेश\n\nकाढल्यानंतर पदोन्नतीच्या पदावर रुजू होण्यासाठी प्रशासकीय कारणास्तव\n\nविलंब झाला असल्याचे निदर्शनास आणल्यास व आयुक्तांनी त्याची योग्य ती\n\nछाननी केली तर त्यांची आपसातील ज्येष्ठता कायम राखण्यासाठी\n\nआयुक्तांच्या अहवालाप्रमाणे त्यांना समायोजित तारखा देऊन त्यांची ज्येष्ठता\n\nनिश्चित करण्यात येईल.\"\n\n84. Below clauses 4, 5 and 6 of the circular dated\n\n25.04.2014, objections were called for and it was apprised to all\n*156* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthat the seniority list would be confirmed after considering the\n\nobjections.\n\n85. It was after taking into account the objections, the\n\nseniority list for the period 01.01.1999 to 31.12.2000, was\n\nconfirmed. He further submits that the DDCs are accepting the\n\nimpugned seniority list dated 31.12.2020, but are not in\n\nagreement with the preamble to the extent it maintains that the\n\nseniority list for the period 01.01.1998 to 31.12.1998 is final.\n\nThey cannot selectively accept few portions of the seniority list\n\nonly to the extent it gives them an advantage. The original\n\nApplicants had prayed for quashing of the seniority list. This\n\nprayer was considered by the Division Bench of the Tribunal and\n\nthere is no dispute between the members that the impugned list\n\ndoes not deserve to be quashed and set aside. He further submits\n\nthat the impugned seniority list has been rightly prepared on the\n\nbasis of the statutory Rules of 1977.\n\n86. Shri Sapkal, the learned Senior Advocate submitted\n\nin rebuttal, on the basis of the gist set out in the brief written\n\nnotes tendered to the Court, that the conditional promotion orders\n*157* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nhave been issued in the past more than three decades and no right\n\nof seniority or pay fixation of the cadre of the Deputy Collector\n\nwould accrue in favour of the PDC. Once the original Applicants\n\nhave accepted conditional promotion orders, they are estopped\n\nfrom denying the applicability of the conditions imposed upon\n\nthem. Since the State has considered the rules of 1977 framed\n\nunder\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India, the original\n\nApplicants cannot claim to have entered into the cadre of Deputy\n\nCollectors on the basis of the provisional promotion orders. He\n\nfurther submits that the seniority list as on 31.12.1998, ought to\n\nhave been modified and revised as per paragraph No.6 of the\n\ncircular dated 29.06.2010. The seniority list as on 31.12.1998,\n\ncannot be said to have attained finality. Considering the\n\nstatement of the State Government before the Tribunal that the\n\nPDC would not be reverted, the State Government has to stand\n\nby it's statement.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n87. We have considered the extensive submissions of the\n\nlearned advocates and have referred to the pleadings before the\n\nTribunal as well as the analysis of the Tribunal in the impugned\n*158* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\njudgment, which also comprises of a separate portion authored\n\nby the learned Member (Administrative). As is visible from the\n\njudgment, both the members have agreed that the Original\n\nApplicants have not suffered any legal injury and yet, the\n\nTribunal has opened the whole issue that travels over a period of\n\nmore than 30 years. It is also obvious that the Tribunal has not\n\nentertained both the Applications and has left the impugned\n\nseniority list, untouched.\n\n88. The first and foremost issue to be considered by the\n\nTribunal was as to whether, any legal injury was caused to the\n\noriginal four Applicants. Applicant Nos.1 and 2 were appointed\n\nas Tahsildar and they assumed office on 02.03.1994. Technically,\n\nthey completed five years on 01.03.1999. They were appointed as\n\nDeputy Collectors on 08th July, 1999. They were promoted as\n\nAdditional Collector on 30.01.2020. Similar is the case of the\n\ntwo Applicants in T.A. No.02/2021.\n\n89. It is undisputed that they were promoted on\n\ntemporary basis. The temporary promotion order of these four\n\nApplicants in the cadre of Deputy Collectors hinges on the fact\n*159* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nthat it was purely a temporary promotion as is mentioned in their\n\norders as 'निव्वळ तात्पुरत्या स्वरूपात पदोन्नती'. This can neither be\n\ncontradicted, nor have the four Applicants adverted to the\n\ncontrary. So also, their orders clearly indicate that their\n\ntemporary promotion was subject to the approval of the MPSC.\n\nThere is no controversy that no such approval was given by the\n\nMPSC as there was no consultation between the DPC and the\n\nMPSC. It was also set out that their temporary promotion would\n\nnot create any equities or rights in their favour and that would not\n\nimprove their seniority or salary structuring (see paragraph No.8\n\nof this judgment). Be that as it may, the State made a statement\n\nbefore the Tribunal that, no matter what may be the irregularities\n\nin the ad-hoc promotions of the PDCs, none would now be\n\nreverted. A statement made on behalf of the State Government,\n\nis found in it's affidavit in reply dated 01.02.2022, filed by\n\nMr.Madhav Veer, that none of the Applicants or the Respondents\n\nbefore the Tribunal would be reverted. We have every reason to\n\nbe circumspect as to how would the State cope up with the huge\n\nmess created by innumerable ad-hoc promotions made over the\n\npast 30 years. Nevertheless, the assurance of the State that none\n\nwould be reverted, has dispelled the apprehension of the 4\n*160* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nApplicants.\n\n90. It cannot be lost sight of, that, if the challenge posed\n\nby these four Applicants is held to be devoid of merits, their\n\npetitions (Transfer Applications) will have to be dismissed. If\n\ntheir claim is rejected by this Court, the further issues as regards\n\nthe legality and validity of the seniority order dated 31.12.2020,\n\nneed not be subjected to any further scrutiny.\n\n91.\nIn\nAjinkya Natha Padwal\n(supra), the Bombay\n\nHigh Court left it open to the State Government to take an\n\nindependent decision whether to make promotions on ad-hoc\n\nbasis pending finalization of the seniority list. It is undisputed\n\nthat several ad-hoc promotions have been effected by the State\n\nGovernment in the last four decades. The temporary promotion\n\norders issued to these four Applicants, was under a caveat of the\n\napproval of the competent authority, keeping in view the\n\nlanguage used 'सक्षम प्राधिकरणाच्या मान्यतेने तदर्थ पदोन्नत्या देण्यात\n\nयेत आहेत'. It is also undisputed that the first ad-hoc promotion of\n\nthese four Applicants from the Tahasildar to Deputy Collector on\n\n09.07.1999, was de-hors the requirement of consultation and\n*161* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\napproval by the competent authority.\n\n92. Under sub-rule (2) of Rule 9 of the 1977 Rules, the\n\nCommittee that was constituted by the State with the intent and\n\npurpose of formalizing the select list of Tahasildars so as to be\n\npromoted as Deputy Collectors, was to meet in the month of\n\nSeptember of 1999 and not there before. However, a meeting of\n\nthe DPC was held on 15.04.1999 and the select list was prepared,\n\nde-hors Rule 9(2). The DPC, by holding a meeting on\n\n15.04.1999, apparently overlooked possible candidates who\n\ncould have been considered if the meeting was held in\n\nSeptember, 1999, under Rule 9(2). The promotion orders were\n\nissued on 09.07.1999. Both the learned Members of the Tribunal\n\nhave concluded that there is a deviation from the Recruitment\n\nRules. The distinction, however, is that the learned Member\n\n(Judicial) treated such deviation as a minor contravention/\n\nirregularity, whereas, the other learned Member (Administrative)\n\nhas concluded that the Applicants were not eligible for inclusion\n\nin the final combined seniority list prepared as per Rule 8(4), so\n\nas to be placed for consideration of the DPC, for promoting them\n\nto the cadre of Deputy Collectors.\n\n*162* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n93. Considering the submissions of the four original\n\nApplicants, coupled with the submissions of the other non-\n\nApplicants and the Petitioners before us and taking into account\n\nthe undisputed fact situation emerging from the record and the\n\n1977 Rules, it cannot be contradicted that the ad-hoc promotion\n\nof the four Applicants (viz. Shivaji T. Shinde appointed as a\n\nTahasildar on 12.07.1995 and promoted on ad-hoc basis as\n\nDeputy Collector on 30.08.2001,\nSunil V. Yadav\nappointed as a\n\nTahasildar on 08.08.1995 and promoted on ad-hoc basis as\n\nDeputy Collector on 30.08.2001, Samiksha R. Chandrakar\n\nappointed as a Tahasildar on 24.02.1994 and promoted on ad-hoc\n\nbasis as Deputy Collector on 08.07.1999 and Pandurang R.\n\nKulkarni appointed as a Tahasildar on 31.05.1994 and promoted\n\non ad-hoc basis as Deputy Collector on 08.07.1999), was de-hors\n\nthe Rules.\n\n94. It cannot be ignored that 75 days time is required to\n\nprepare the final combined seniority list. These Applicants were\n\nappointed as ad-hoc PDC in the hurriedly convened DPC on\n\n15.04.1999, which is in contravention of the Rules. As such,\n*163* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nsince the final selection list was not formalized in compliance\n\nwith the Rules while preparing the select list, these four\n\nApplicants cannot be said to have been appointed as PDC in\n\ndeference to the Rules applicable.\n\n95. In this legal and factual backdrop, though the four\n\nApplicants may be aggrieved because of being pushed down by\n\nthe impugned seniority list dated 31.12.2020, thereby giving\n\nthem a cause to approach the Tribunal, the fact remains that their\n\ngrievance is misconceived and unsustainable. Had it been the\n\ncase that the placement of these 4 Applicants in the seniority list\n\nof the cadre of Dy. Collectors had some bearing on the ad-hoc\n\npromotion already granted to them, it could have been said that\n\nthe cause of action was surviving for them to prosecute the 2\n\napplications. Now, the Applicants have also crossed that hurdle\n\nand have already entered into the cadre of Additional Collector.\n\nAs assured by the Government, they are not to be reverted.\n\n96. It cannot be contradicted that, on the one hand, the\n\nState found it convenient to resort to ad-hoc promotions, perhaps\n\nout of necessity, and on the other hand, the State had no reason to\n*164* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nact in undue haste and prepare the select list, not in ignorance,\n\nbut by overlooking and ignoring the 1977 Rules. Even otherwise,\n\nthese four Applicants were only engaged as ad-hoc PDC\n\n(temporary promotion as Promotee Deputy Collectors) as a stop-\n\ngap arrangement, which does not justify the contention that they\n\nshould be treated as validly promoted Deputy Collectors.\n\nAdmittedly, since a select list as prescribed by sub-rule (7) of\n\nRule 9 was prepared, apparently without consultation with the\n\nMPSC, these four Applicants could not have been in the final\n\nselect list. This defeats the claim of these four Applicants to be\n\ntreated as being regularly promoted Deputy Collectors w.e.f.\n\n30.08.2001 (first two Applicants) and 08.07.1999 (other two\n\nApplicants) in view of proviso (i) below Rule 10(1) of the 1977\n\nRules.\n\n97. It is evident that there was no consultation of the\n\nState with the MPSC, while including these four Applicants in\n\nthe select list, before determining the final select list of the\n\nTahsildars under sub-rule 7 of Rule 9. So also, no review of their\n\nservices was carried out as per Rule 12 of the 1977 Rules.\n\n*165* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n98. The proviso (i) and (ii), to Rule 10(1) of the Rules of\n\n1977, provide for filling up the vacancies in the cadre of Deputy\n\nCollectors purely as a stop-gap arrangement. However, proviso\n\n(i) indicates that only an officer in the cadre of Tahasildar whose\n\nname has been included in the combined final seniority list\n\nprepared under Rule 8(4), could be appointed as a Deputy\n\nCollector on a stop-gap basis. The Applicants were not eligible\n\nfor appointment even on stop-gap basis on the post of Deputy\n\nCollector under proviso (i) of Rule 10.\n\n99. On the one hand, though the Rules mandate that the\n\nApplicants deserve to be reverted back to the cadre of Tahasildar,\n\nthis would amount to turning the clock back by more than 2\n\ndecades, which may lead to multiple administrative\n\ncomplications. On the other hand, accepting the claim of the\n\nApplicants to grant them seniority w.e.f. their date of joining the\n\ncadre of Deputy Collectors, would amount to injustice to the\n\nDDC. Regularization of the PDC in the combined seniority list\n\nseems to be the only plausible way out which has been\n*166* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\napparently accepted by most of the PDC, except these four\n\nApplicants.\n\n100.\nIn a recently delivered judgment by the Honourable\n\nSupreme Court (Coram : Dr.Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Vikram\n\nNath and B.V. Nagarathna, JJJ) in\nMalook Singh and others vs.\n\nState of Punjab and others\n(supra), a reference was made by\n\nthe Honourable Court to the judgment delivered by the Court in\n\nDirect Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association vs.\n\nState of Maharashtra\n, (1990) 2 SCC 715, and more particularly\n\nparagraph Nos.13 and 47, reproduced in this judgment in\n\nparagraph No.19 herein above.\n\nIt was, thus, concluded in\n\nMalook Singh\n(supra), that when the initial appointment is only\n\nad-hoc and not according to the Rules and made as a stop-gap\n\narrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into\n\naccount considering the seniority.\n\n101.\nIn\nUnion of India and another vs. Professor S.K.\n\nSharma\n, AIR 1992 SC 1188, the Honourable Supreme Court\n\nconcluded that the seniority of an appointee is to be reckoned\n\nfrom the date of his regular appointment and not from the day he\n*167* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nofficiated on ad-hoc/ officiating basis.\n\n102. The names of these four Applicants had not been\n\nincluded in the select list of Tahsildars, if any, as per Rule 9(3)\n\n(iii), since their names did not appear in the final combined\n\nseniority list of Tahsildars which has to be prepared under Rule\n\n8(4). Nevertheless, now that they have become Additional\n\nCollectors and with the assurance from the State that they will\n\nnot be reverted, the impugned seniority list, hardly dents their\n\ncareer chances. Therefore, it can be concluded that the four\n\nApplicants cannot be said to be aggrieved in order to have a\n\ncause to question the impugned seniority list. When the seniority\n\nof these Applicants, was not likely to be adversely affected\n\nbecause of any change in their position in the impugned seniority\n\nlist of Deputy Collectors, in fact, no cause of action would\n\nsurvive for the said applicants to pray for setting aside the\n\nimpugned seniority list.\n\n103. Three judgments of the Supreme Court, viz. (\ni)\n\nUnion of India and another vs. Prof. S.K. Sharma\n, AIR 1992\n\nSC 1188, (ii) Excise Commissioner, Karnataka and another\n*168* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nvs. V. Sreekanta, AIR 1993 SC 1564 and (iii) P.K. Singh vs.\n\nBool Chand Chablani and others, AIR 1999 SC 1478, clearly\n\nlay down the law that the 'services rendered on adhoc basis\n\ncannot be considered for the purpose of reckoning seniority'.\n\n104. The Tribunal has unanimously concluded that the\n\nfour Applicants did not have any locus-standi to challenge the\n\nimpugned final list dated 31.12.2020 and the final seniority list\n\ndated 03.03.2018. These four Applicants were in excess of the\n\nquota and, therefore, they would be eligible for regularization\n\nfrom the dates a permanent vacancy arose within their quota.\n\nUntil then, they would continue to be adhoc appointees and the\n\nday they are absorbed on a permanent vacant post in the cadre,\n\nthat would be the day of their entering the Deputy Collector's\n\nquota.\n\n105. The officers who are awaiting their promotion to the\n\npost of Dy. Collector Selection Grade, are working on the post\n\nPDC for more than 17-18 years. As such, we do not apprehend\n\nthat the chances of their promotion to the post of Selection Grade\n\nDy. Collector, could be affected. Once these officers are\n*169* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\npromoted to the post of Dy. Collector Selection Grade, the\n\ncriteria would be 'merit' and not 'seniority', for their further\n\npromotion to the post of Additional Collector.\n\n106.\nIn\nM.S.L. Patil, Asstt. Conservator of Forests,\n\nSolapur (Maharashtra) and others vs. State of Maharashtra\n\nand others\n, (1996) 11 SCC 361, it is observed that even if many\n\nyears have passed in the PDC cadre, if there is no review, the\n\nresult of returning back as Tahsildar, has to follow. However, this\n\nwould have disastrous effects on every PDC and DDC. Noticing\n\nthis impact, the State Government declared before the Tribunal\n\nthat none of the these officers would be reverted, which includes\n\nthe 4 Applicants before the Tribunal.\n\n107. The direction issued by the Tribunal to prepare a\n\nfresh seniority list from 2004, was nobody's prayer before the\n\nTribunal. So also, this would surely impact those PDCs/DDCs,\n\nwho were not before the Tribunal. Moreover, when the Tribunal\n\nhas held that the four Applicants did not have the 'locus standi'\n\nand had no cause of action, it could not have granted any relief\n\nindirectly to the Applicants, which they could not have been\n*170* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ngranted directly.\n\n108. The effect of the irregularities in the ad-hoc\n\npromotions of the 4 Applicants is writ large. The Tribunal has\n\ndealt with the factors indicating the irregularities in details. We\n\nhave, as well, adverted to the same as we recorded the\n\ncontentions of the learned Advocates, elaborately. While\n\nexercising Supervisory jurisdiction and not Appellate\n\njurisdiction, we cannot interfere in a judgment only because a\n\ndifferent view is possible, and more so when a plausible view has\n\nbeen taken.\n\n109. In the backdrop of this settled position of law, we\n\nhave considered the views expressed by the two learned\n\nMembers of the Tribunal. Much ado has been made by the\n\nlitigating parties before us, contending that two divergent views\n\nhave been expressed by the two learned Members. We do not\n\nentirely agree with this submission. Both the learned Members\n\nhave expressed their findings in different ways. Finally, the\n\nlearned Member (Administrative) has handed down a concurring\n\njudgment.\n\n*171* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n110. We agree with the view taken by the Tribunal that\n\nthe very transition of these 4 Applicants, from Tahsildars to\n\npromotee deputy Collectors, is an irregularity. The seniority list\n\ndated 31.12.1998, has attained finality and there has been no challenge\n\nto the same. The circular dated 29.06.2010 is a testimony of the said\n\nseniority list being crystallized. This has also been reiterated in the\n\nimpugned seniority list vide paragraph Nos.7.1 and 7.2. Paragraph\n\nNos.11 and 20 of the affidavit in reply of the State Government before\n\nthe Tribunal, crystallized the said issue. In the light of the same, the\n\nimpugned final seniority has been settled. The grievance of these\n\n4 Applicants is, therefore, baseless and does not deserve\n\nconsideration. Except these 4, all other PDCs have accepted the\n\nimpugned seniority list.\n\n111. We need to consider another angle, as to whether the\n\nTribunal could have made suggestions and issued directions,\n\nwhen it had come to a conclusion that both the Applications\n\ndeserved to the rejected. Once the Tribunal came to a conclusion\n\nthat the grievance of the 4 Applicants is unsustainable, it should\n\nnot have travelled any further as their Applications deserved no\n*172* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nconsideration. Therefore, issuing guidelines and suggestions, was\n\nunwarranted, more so, when all those who would be affected by\n\nsuch suggestions or directions, were not before the Tribunal.\n\n112. Consequentially, when the challenge posed by the\n\nfour Applicants had been rejected, the Tribunal could not have\n\ntravelled beyond their prayers. Since we have concluded that\n\nboth the Transfer Applications of these four Applicants deserve to\n\nbe rejected, the suggestions put forth by the Tribunal below\n\nparagraph No.87 and the consequential order below paragraph\n\nNo.88, deserve to be quashed. There was no reason, in our view,\n\nfor the learned Tribunal to make suggestions when the impugned\n\nseniority list was not to be interfered with or set aside.\n\n113. The law is clearly\nlaid down in\n\nKusum Ingots\n\nand Alloys Limited vs. Union of India and another\n, 2004 (\n6)\n\nSCC 254, Jotun India Private Limited vs. Union of India and\n\nothers\n, 2018 SCC Online Bombay 6400 and United Forum\n\nand others vs. The Union of India and others, 2018 SCC\n\nOnline Bombay 2221, that the Court should decide an issue if\n\nthere is a cause of action and should refrain from taking up an\n*173* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nissue which is purely academic in nature.\n\n114. In view of our conclusions in this judgment and as\n\nboth the Transfer Applications fail, we have no reason to deal\n\nwith the other contentions made by the private parties/ Petitioners\n\nbefore us. The grievance of these four Applicants as against the\n\nimpugned seniority list dated 31.12.2020, is unsustainable. Both\n\nthe Transfer Applications, on this ground, deserve to be\n\ndismissed.\n\n115. Writ Petition Nos.11692/2022 and 11762/2022,\n\nfiled by the State, are allowed. Accordingly, the two Transfer\n\nApplications stand dismissed. Consequentially, the suggestions/\n\ndirections issued by the learned Tribunal in paragraph Nos.87\n\nand 88, are quashed and set aside. Rule is made absolute in\n\nthese two petitions.\n\n116.\nIn view of the above analysis and our conclusions,\n\nWrit Petition No.12699/2022, filed by\nMr. Nitin Mahajan v/s\n\nState of Maharashtra and others\n, does not deserve consideration.\n\nMoreover, with our conclusions recorded above, no purpose\n*174* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\nwould be served in entertaining this Petition. Therefore, Writ\n\nPetition No.12699/2022, stands disposed off. Rule is\n\ndischarged in this petition.\n\n117. In view of the above, Writ Petition No.9163/2022\n\n(filed by Samiksha Ramakant Chandrakar and another), Writ\n\nPetition No.9631/2022 (filed by Vijaysingh Shankarrao\n\nDeshmukh), Writ Petition No.9632/2022 (filed by Tushar\n\nEknath Thombre), and Writ Petition No.12675/2022 (filed by\n\nK. K. Suryakrishnamurty), are dismissed. Rule is discharged in\n\nthese four petitions.\n\n118. After this judgment was pronounced, the learned\n\nSenior Advocate Shri Rajadhyaksha, representing the Petitioner\n\nin Writ Petition No.12699/2022, Shri Ajay S. Deshpande, the\n\nlearned Advocate representing the Petitioners in Writ Petition\n\nNo.9163/2022 and Shri Avinash S. Deshmukh, the learned\n\nAdvocate, representing Respondent Nos.3 and 4 in Writ Petition\n\nNo.9632/2022 and Respondent Nos.1 and 2 in Writ Petition\n\nNo.11692/2022, prayed for staying the operation of this\n\njudgment.\n\n*175* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\n119. The learned Senior Advocate Shri R.S. Apte,\n\nrepresenting the State of Maharashtra as a Special Counsel along\n\nwith the learned Senior Advocate Shri P.R. Katneshwarkar and\n\nthe learned Senior Advocate Shri V.D. Sapkal, submit that the\n\nOriginal Applications (Transfer Application Nos.1/2021 and\n\n2/2021), were dismissed by the learned Maharashtra\n\nAdministrative Tribunal vide the impugned judgment dated\n\n26.08.2022. There has been no protective order passed by the\n\nlearned Tribunal thereafter. When the parties reached this Court\n\nin these petitions, there was no interim order operating. At the\n\nsame time, the judgment of the learned Tribunal impugned in\n\nthese petitions, was also not stayed.\n\n120. The learned Senior Advocate Shri Rajadhyaksha and\n\nthe learned Advocate Shri Deshpande, raised a question as to\n\nwhy did the State not issue any orders of promotion when there\n\nwere no prohibitory orders from this Court. In our view, this\n\nquestion cannot be posed to the Court. It is between the parties\n\nand the State. This Court had never passed any order in the\n\nnature of either staying the judgment of the Tribunal or\n*176* WP DC PROMOTIONS\n\ninjuncting the State Government from issuing promotion orders.\n\n121. In fact, the learned Senior Advocate Shri Apte had\n\nsuggested before this Court on 31.01.2024 that any further\n\ndevelopment that may take place with regard to the promotions\n\nof eligible candidates, can be made subject to the result of these\n\npetitions. In short, neither the judgment of the learned Tribunal\n\ndismissing the Original Applications, was kept in abeyance, nor\n\nhad this Court issued any injunctory order. We have not issued\n\nany order or direction to any of the parties before us. We have\n\nonly upheld the verdict of the Tribunal, which had dismissed the\n\n2 proceedings before it. Hence, no orders.\n\n(Y.G. KHOBRAGADE, J.) (RAVINDRA V. GHUGE, J.)\n\n(Kalyan Sangvikar, PS)",
