JUSTICE SANJEEV NARULA\nJUDGMENT\n\nSANJEEV NARULA, J.:\n\n1. This application under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha\nSanhita, 20231 seeks regular bail in case FIR No. 564/2023 registered under\n\nSections 498A\n/\n304B\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code, 18602 at P.S. Shahbad\nDairy. A chargesheet under the aforesaid provisions has since been filed.\nFACTUAL MATRIX\n\n2. The case of the prosecution, in brief, is as follows:\n\n2.1. The marriage between the Applicant and the deceased Shivani was\nsolemnized on 08th December, 2022. On 03rd June, 2023, information was\n\"BNSS\"\n\"\nIPC\n\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed BAIL APPLN. 3329/2025 Page 1 of 7\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN\n\nSigning Date:24.11.2025\n\n17:33:00\n\nreceived from Dr. BSA Hospital that Shivani had been brought dead with an\nalleged history of hanging.\n\n2.2. Proceedings under\nSection 176\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n19733 were conducted by the executive magistrate. In the course of these\nproceedings, Shivani's father alleged that the Applicant and his family\nsubjected her to dowry-related cruelty, which drove her to commit suicide.\nOn this basis, the present FIR came to be registered.\n\n2.3. The complainant handed over certain photographs and an audio clip\npurportedly sent by the deceased, in which she is stated to have complained\nof harassment and beatings by the Applicant.\n\n2.4. The Applicant was arrested on 06th June, 2023. All the co-accused\nhave been granted anticipatory bail. Investigation in the case stands\nconcluded and chargesheet has been filed.\n\nSUBMISSIONS\n\n3. Mr. Manoj Kumar Duggal, counsel for the Applicant submits that the\nApplicant has been falsely implicated. It is contended that the material relied\nupon by the prosecution, including the audio recording and photographs\nattributed to the deceased, does not disclose any specific demand for dowry\nand, at best, indicates ordinary marital discord or allegations of quarrels and\nbeatings. On this basis, it is urged that the foundational requirements of\n\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC are not met, as there is no material to establish\na proximate or live link between any alleged acts of cruelty and the death in\nquestion. It is further submitted that the Applicant has remained in custody\nfor more than two years; the investigation stands concluded; chargesheet has\nalready been filed; and no further custodial interrogation is required. Thus,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed BAIL APPLN. 3329/2025 Page 2 of 7\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN\n\nSigning Date:24.11.2025\n\n17:33:00\n\ncontinued incarceration of the Applicant would be unjustified in these\ncircumstances. It is also emphasised that all co-accused family members\nhave been granted anticipatory bail.\n\n4. Mr. Yudhvir Singh Chauhan, APP for the State, opposes the\napplication. He submits that the case concerns the unnatural death of a\nyoung woman within the first seven years of marriage, attracting the rigours\nof\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC. He points out that the prosecution material,\nincluding the voice recording and photographs, depicts sustained harassment\nand physical violence, and that the complainant has made categorical\nallegations of dowry demands by the Applicant and his family members. On\nthis basis, it is urged that the ingredients of the aforesaid offences are prima\nfacie satisfied. He further submits that the co-accused who have been\ngranted anticipatory bail are not similarly situated, as they are in-laws,\nwhereas the Applicant is the husband of the deceased and the central figure\nin the allegations. Mr. Chauhan also raises a concern that if released, the\nApplicant may attempt to threaten or intimidate the complainant or the\nfamily of the deceased out of anger or a sense of reprisal, thereby posing a\nrisk to their safety and to the fairness of the trial.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n5. This Court has considered the rival submissions and examined the\nmaterial placed on record, including the transcript of the audio recording\nrelied upon by the prosecution. The Applicant stands charged, inter alia,\nunder\nSection 304B\nIPC, which creates a distinct offence of 'dowry death'\nand is complemented by the statutory presumption under Section 113B of\n\"\nCr.P.C\n.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed BAIL APPLN. 3329/2025 Page 3 of 7\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN\n\nSigning Date:24.11.2025\n\n17:33:00\n\nthe\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872\n.4 For this presumption to operate, the\nprosecution must establish, at least prima facie, that: (i) the death of a\nwoman occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances; (ii) such death\ntook place within seven years of marriage; and (iii) soon before her death,\nshe was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his relatives,\nin connection with any demand for dowry. Once these foundational facts are\nestablished, the law permits a presumption that the husband or his relatives\ncaused the dowry death.\n\n6. In the present case, the first two elements are, at this stage, not in\ndispute. The marriage took place on 8th December 2022 and the death\noccurred on 3rd June 2023, in circumstances recorded as an alleged case of\nhanging. The real controversy, even at the threshold, concerns the third\nrequirement, namely whether there is material to suggest that the deceased\nwas subjected to cruelty or harassment 'soon before her death' in connection\nwith any dowry demand.\n\n7. The prosecution places reliance on (i) the statement of the deceased's\nfather recorded during inquest proceedings under\nSection 176\nCr.P.C., and\n\n(ii) certain photographs and an audio clip said to have been sent by the\ndeceased. At this stage, the Court refrains from commenting on the\nevidentiary weight of this material. However, on a prima facie reading of the\ntranscript of the audio clip, as also acknowledged by the prosecution, does\nnot reveal dowry related demands. The transcript reflects quarrels and\nallegations of beatings, but it does not contain any clear or specific reference\nto dowry demand by the Applicant. There is also no prior complaint or\nreport lodged with the police or any other authority regarding dowry demand\n\"the\nEvidence Act\n\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed BAIL APPLN. 3329/2025 Page 4 of 7\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN\n\nSigning Date:24.11.2025\n\n17:33:00\n\nbefore the inquest statement was recorded. Thus, whether the general\nallegations of cruelty or harassment adverted to by the complainant and the\nmaterial relied upon by the prosecution meet the statutory threshold of\n'cruelty in connection with dowry' and 'soon before her death' for the\npurposes of\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC is a matter that will require full-\nfledged evidence and cross-examination at trial. At the stage of considering\nbail, the Court is not expected to conduct a mini-trial or render any\nconclusive finding on the applicability of the presumption under\nSection\n113B\nof the Evidence Act.\n\n8. As per the nominal roll, as on 1st October 2025, the Applicant has\nremained in custody for approximately two years and five months. The\ninvestigation stands completed and a chargesheet has already been filed.\nThere is nothing on record in the present proceedings to indicate that the\nApplicant has any previous criminal history or that he has attempted to\nabscond or interfere with the process of law during the period of\ninvestigation. The trial is yet to conclude and, having regard to the nature of\nthe offence and the pendency of such matters, it is reasonable to expect that\nit will take some time before it reaches finality. Prolonged pre-trial\nincarceration, particularly once the investigation is over and the accused is\nno longer required for custodial interrogation, has been consistently viewed\nwith caution by the Supreme Court.\n\n9. The co-accused, who are family members of the Applicant and\nagainst whom allegations also stand levelled, have been granted anticipatory\nbail. It is correct that the Applicant, being the husband, is placed somewhat\ndifferently from the in-laws and the principle of parity cannot be applied\nmechanically. However, whether the prosecution ultimately establishes the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed BAIL APPLN. 3329/2025 Page 5 of 7\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN\n\nSigning Date:24.11.2025\n\n17:33:00\n\nessential ingredients of the offences is a matter that will fall for appreciation\non the basis of the evidence, parties shall adduce at trial and cannot be pre-\njudged at the bail stage.\n\n10. The general principles governing the grant of bail are well settled.\nBail is not to be withheld as a form of pre-trial punishment, and the primary\npurpose of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at trial.5 In\nconsidering a bail application, due regard must be given to the nature and\ngravity of the accusation, the severity of the punishment in the event of\nconviction, the prima facie evaluation of the material, the likelihood of the\naccused fleeing from justice, and the possibility of tampering with evidence\nor influencing witnesses.\n\n11. Having regard to the totality of circumstances, including the duration\nof custody, the stage of the proceedings, the nature of the material on record,\nand the settled principles governing grant of bail, this Court is of the view\nthat the Applicant has made out a case for being released on bail. The\napprehensions expressed by the State that the Applicant may threaten or\nintimidate the complainant or other witnesses can be addressed by imposing\nstrict and enforceable conditions.\n\n12. Accordingly, the Applicant is directed to be released on bail on\nfurnishing a personal bond for a sum of ₹25,000/- with two sureties of the\nlike amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court/Duty MM, on the\nfollowing conditions:\n\na. The Applicant shall cooperate in any further investigation as and\nwhen directed by the concerned IO;\nSee also:\nSanjay Chandra v. CBI\n, (2012) 1 SCC 40;\nSatender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of\nInvestigation\n, (2022) 10 SCC 51.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed BAIL APPLN. 3329/2025 Page 6 of 7\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN\n\nSigning Date:24.11.2025\n\n17:33:00\n\nb. The Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement,\nthreat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case or\ntamper with the evidence of the case, in any manner whatsoever;\nc. The Applicant shall under no circumstance leave the country without\nthe permission of the Trial Court;\n\nd. The Applicant shall appear before the Trial Court as and when\ndirected;\n\ne. The Applicant shall provide the address where he would be residing\nafter his release and shall not change the address without informing the\nconcerned IO/ SHO;\n\nf. The Applicant shall, upon his release, give his mobile number to the\nconcerned IO/SHO and shall keep his mobile phone switched on at all times.\ng. The Applicant shall report to the concerned PS on first Friday of\nevery 3 months;\n\n13. In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/complaint lodged\nagainst the Applicant, it would be open to the State to seek redressal by\nfiling an application seeking cancellation of bail.\n\n14. It is clarified that any observations made in the present order are for\nthe purpose of deciding the present bail application and should not influence\nthe outcome of the trial and also not be taken as an expression of opinion on\nthe merits of the case.\n\n15. The bail application is allowed in the afore-mentioned terms.\n\nSANJEEV NARULA, J\nNOVEMBER 24, 2025/MK\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed BAIL APPLN. 3329/2025 Page 7 of 7\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN\n\nSigning Date:24.11.2025\n\n17:33:00",

IN THE COURSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, SHIVANI'S FATHER ALLEGED THAT THE APPLICANT AND HIS FAMILY SUBJECTED HER TO DOWRY-RELATED CRUELTY, WHICH DROVE HER TO COMMIT SUICIDE. ON THIS BASIS, THE PRESENT FIR CAME TO BE REGISTERED.  2.3.

MANOJ KUMAR DUGGAL, COUNSEL FOR THE APPLICANT SUBMITS THAT THE APPLICANT HAS BEEN FALSELY IMPLICATED. IT IS CONTENDED THAT THE MATERIAL RELIED UPON BY THE PROSECUTION, INCLUDING THE AUDIO RECORDING AND PHOTOGRAPHS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DECEASED, DOES NOT DISCLOSE ANY SPECIFIC DEMAND FOR DOWRY AND, AT BEST, INDICATES ORDINARY MARITAL DISCORD OR ALLEGATIONS OF QUARRELS AND BEATINGS.

IT IS FURTHER SUBMITTED THAT THE APPLICANT HAS REMAINED IN CUSTODY FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS; THE INVESTIGATION STANDS CONCLUDED; CHARGESHEET HAS ALREADY BEEN FILED; AND NO FURTHER CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION IS REQUIRED.
