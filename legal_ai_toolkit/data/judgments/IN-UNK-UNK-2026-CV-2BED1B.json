Date of such order 01­07­2019\n For the following:­\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n This is a charge sheet submitted by Police Inspector of\n\nChandralayout PS against the accused 1 and 2 for an\n\noffence Punishable U/Sec. 498A r/w 34 of \nIPC\n and 3 & 4\n\nD.P.Act.\n\n2. The case of the prosecution in brief is as under:\n\n The accused No.1 married CW1 on 24­06­2010 in\n\naccordance with customs and received dowry of Rs.20,000/­\n\nas cash and gold ornaments i.e., one gold chain, one gold\n\nring and one gold bracelet from the parents of CW1 and\n\nsubsequently the accused 1 at the instigation of accused 2\n\ntreated CW1 with cruelty both physically and mentally and\n\ndemanded motorcycle as an additional dowry and thrown\n\nout CW1 from the matrimonial house and thereby the\n\naccused has committed the offence.\n\n 3 C.C.No.12786/2019\n\n3. Accused 1 and 2 were on bail. Substance of accusation\n\nwas read over to the accused 1 and 2 for the offence\n\npunishable U/s. 498A r/w 34 of \nIPC\n and 3 & 4 D.P.Act. The\n\naccused 1 and 2 have pleaded not guilty and claimed to be\n\ntried.\n\n4. In order to substantiate the allegation, prosecution has\n\nexamined PW.1 and got marked the documents as Ex.P1 to\n\nP7. Since there are no incriminating evidence against the\n\naccused 1 and 2 as such recording of 313 \nCr.P.C\n., is\n\ndispensed.\n\n5. Heard the arguments.\n\n6. The point that would arise for my consideration in this\n\ncase are as under:\n\n 1. Whether the prosecution has proved beyond\n all reasonable doubt that accused 1 married\n CW1 on 24­06­2010 in accordance with\n customs and received dowry of Rs.20,000/­ as\n cash and gold ornaments i.e., one gold chain,\n one gold ring and one gold bracelet from the\n\n 4 C.C.No.12786/2019\n\n parents of CW1 and subsequently the accused\n 1 at the instigation of accused 2 treated CW1\n with cruelty both physically and mentally and\n demanded motorcycle as an additional dowry\n and thrown out CW1 from the matrimonial\n house and thereby committed an offence\n punishable u/s 498A r/w 34 of \nIPC\n and 3 & 4\n D.P.Act?\n\n 2. What order?\n\n7. My findings on the above points are as under:\n\n Point No.1 : In the Negative.\n Point No.2 : As per final order,\n for the following:\n\n REASONS\n\n8. Point No.1 and 2:­ In order to avoid the repetition of\n\nfacts taken together for discussion. In order to bring home\n\nthe guilt of the accused 1 and 2 the prosecution has\n\nexamined one witness i.e., PW1 who is the complainant in\n\nher evidence she has deposed that he has not lodged\n\ncomplaint against the accused 1 and 2 and further stated\n\n 5 C.C.No.12786/2019\n\nthat he does not know the contents of complaint and\n\nmahazar marked as Ex.P1 and P2.\n\n9. Except the evidence of PW.1, no other evidence is\n\navailable on record to establish the guilt of accused 1 and 2.\n\nIt is to be noted that, complainant has turned out hostile to\n\nthe case of the prosecution as he has compromised the\n\nmatter with the accused 1 and 2. The prayer of Sr. APP for\n\nissuance of summons to other witnesses is rejected as no\n\npurpose will be served in view of evidence of P.W.1.\n\nAccordingly, I answer point no.1 and 2 in the negative.\n\n10. Point No.3:­ In the result, I proceed to pass the\n\nfollowing:\n\n ORDER\n\n Acting under \nSection 248 (1)\n of Cr.P.C., accused 1 and\n\n2 are hereby acquitted of the offences punishable U/sec.\n\n498A r/w 34 of \nIPC\n and 3 & 4 D.P.Act.\n\n 6 C.C.No.12786/2019\n\n Bail bonds of accused 1 and 2 and their surety bond\n\nstands cancelled.\n\n(Dictated to the stenographer directly on the computer, verified and corrected by me, then the\njudgment pronounced by me in the open court, on this 1 st day of July 2019.)\n\n (M.Mahesh Babu)\n VIII Addl.
