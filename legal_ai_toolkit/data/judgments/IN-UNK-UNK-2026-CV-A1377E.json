SESSIONS\n JUDGE-II (NORTH-WEST): ROHINI COURTS: DELHI\n\nState Vs. Krishna Sharma\nFIR 211/2011\nPS Rani Bagh\n30.1.2012\nORDER\n\n This application under \nSection 439 (2)\n of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure has been filed on behalf of the State seeking\ncancellation of bail granted to the Krishna Sharma and for setting\naside the order dated 5.11.2011 passed by Ld. Magistrate. Brief facts\nof the case are that on 21.7.11 on receiving DD No. 41A, SI Govind\nalong with PSI Vishal Malik reached at 3445C, Raja Park Delhi\nwherein it was learnt that Sangeeta W/o Pushpender was found\nhanging and she had been taken to Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital by\nPCR Van. IO/SI Govind after leaving PSI Vishal Malik at spot,\nreached at Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital where he collected MLC No.\n1001/11 of Sangeeta w/o Pushpender upon which doctor had\nmentioned alleged history of hanging and declared brought dead. On\nenquiry it was revealed that she had married with Pushpender about\n5 years ago. I.O. informed to Executive Magistrate Model Town and\ndead body was sent to mortuary BJRM Hospital. The spot was\ninspected by police as well as by crime team and one chunni of\nparrot colour and one blue brown diary of year 2007were recovered\nfrom the spot. In the said diary besides some writing at page 19/20\nDecember, there was one writing with pencil without signatures\nwherein it was mentioned about harassment by Susralwalas. Parents\nof the deceased were informed and Sh. M.P. Kushwaha, Executive\nMagistrate Model Town recorded statements of the father and other\n\n 1\n\n witnesses and gave direction to the police to initiate legal action.\nFather of the deceased namely Sh. Madhav Prasad Sharma in his\nstatement before Executive Magistrate has stated that he married her\ndaughter with Pushpender Gautam and gave cash and jewellery to\nthe accused Pushpender and his family members and in all about 12\nlacs spent by him in the marriage. The complainant also alleged that\nwhen deceased was brought by him to Bareli i.e. parental house, the\ndeceased told him about the cruelty and harassment made by her\nhusband and her in-laws on account of insufficient dowry. The\ncomplainant also stated that her daughter i.e. deceased made\ncomplaints several times to him about their demands and the cruelty\nand harassment made by the accused persons on her. He also told in\nhis statement before Executive Magistrate on 21.7.11 at about 9 PM\ndeceased Sangeeta made call on mobile of her mother at mobile No.\n09411831748, which was attended by him and Sangeeta told him\nthat \"her susralwalas were planning to kill her and that she\napprehended perhaps she was talking to him i.e. Madhav Prasad,\nlast time\" and thereafter she disconnected the phone while telling\nhim that Puspender has come and thereafter Pushpender made call on\nthe said mobile phone about 11 PM and told to complainant\n\"Dekhiye Sangeeta meri baat nahi maan rahi hai aur iska parinam\nacha nahi hoga\" and when complainant asked Pushpender to get\nhim to talk with Sangeeta, on this Pushpender disconnected the\nphone. Later on complainant and his wife tried to contact the phone\nof their daughter Sangeeta but it was switched off and Pushpender\nand her mother in law Smt. Krishna (accused before this Court) did\nnot pick up their phone. Subsequent to that 22.7.11 at 3 AM, the\ncomplainant to come to know the admission of their daughter\n\n 2\n\n Sangeeta at Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital, Delhi in ICU. The\ncomplainant told in his statement to Executive Magistrate he\nbelieved that Pushpender, Krishna Sharma, Usha, Husband of Usha\nand Madan had their hands in murder of his daughter Sangeeta.\n\n The impugned order of Ld. Magistrate dated 5.12.2011\nhas been assailed on the ground that the order dated 5.12.11 passed\nby Ld. MM is wrong and against the settled principles of law. It is\nfurther pleaded that the Ld, MM did not grant sufficient\nopportunity to the prosecution to argue the matter as the bail\napplication of accused Krishna Devi Sharma was moved by her\ncounsel on the same day i.e. 5.12.11 and no report was called from\nthe Investigating Officer. It is also pleaded that the Ld. MM failed to\nconsider that accused avoided her arrest intentionally and did not\njoine the investigation. It is further pleaded that the bail application\nwas moved on 5.12.11 and the bail order passed on the same day,\nwhich shows that the order was passed in haste without going\nthrough the record and without seeking report from IO. It is also\npleaded that there were concealment of facts by the accused as\nthere were NBWs issued against the accused and also proceedings\nunder \nSection 82\n Cr.PC initiated against her. It is also pleaded that\nthe present case pertains to dowry death and exclusively triable by\nSession Court therefore, the Court of Ld. Magistrate should refrain\nfrom entertaining bail applications in such cases wherein the\npunishment provided is death or life imprisonment. It is also\npleaded that the impugned order of Ld. MM is not speaking order\nas it does not shows any grounds or reason for which Ld. MM\ngranted the bail to the accused and not considered the fact of the\ndismissal of bail of accused by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi as\n\n 3\n\n well by Session Court Rohini and proceedings\n u/s 82\n Cr.PC against\nthe accused. It is further pleaded that there was no parity between co-\naccused Madan Mohan, Daughter and Son-in-Law of accused as\npleaded by accused and moreover there is no provision in the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code\n for the Magistrate Court to exercise\ndiscretionary Powers as pleaded by the accuse in the said para of bail\napplication. It is also pleaded that the Ld. MM overlooked the\norders of Hon'ble Delhi High Court and Hon'ble Session Court\nas the bail applications of the accused have already been dismissed.\n\n Notice on this application was issued to the accused\nKrishna Sharma who has filed a detailed reply wherein the facts\nregarding dismissal of her two applications for grant of anticipatory\nbail by Ld. Sessions Judges and another application for grant of\nanticipatory bail having been dismissed by Hon'ble Delhi High\nCourt, stands admitted. It is submitted that there is no whisper of\nallegations against the present accused Krishna Devi and even to\nremotely suggest that she was involved in the matrimonial affairs of\nthe deceased and therefore \nSection 498A\n/\n304 B \nIPC do not attract\nagainst her. It is further submitted that similarly placed co-accused\nMadan Mohan Gautam was granted anticipatory bail by the Sessions\nCourt vide order dated 12.8.2011 and also the daughter and son-in-\nlaw of present accused were granted seven days notice prior to their\narrest vide orders dated 17.8.2011 and 19.8.2011 by Ld. Sessions\nCourt, and therefore the present case is on parity with the said co-\naccused. It is further submitted that there is no likelihood of the\naccused absconding nor she is required for any recovery. It is also\npleaded that there is no apprehension of the accused evading her\nappearance before the court during trial and under these\n\n 4\n\n circumstances the present application is impermissible.\n\n In the reply on merits, it is also submitted that the Ld.\nMagistrate while passing the order dated 5.12.2011 was well within\nher power as envisaged in \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n and has\npassed the orders after duly scrutinizing the charge sheet and careful\napplication of mind. It has been denied that the prosecution was not\ngranted sufficient opportunity or that the application of bail had been\nmoved by the counsel on the same day and no report has been called\nfrom the investigating officer. It is argued that the Public Prosecutor\nwas present in the court and had been granted an opportunity to put\nforward the case of the prosecution and even otherwise the\nrequirement of getting the report from the investigating officer at the\ntime of bail application is not mandatory. It is also pointed out that\npursuant to the dismissal of the application for grant of anticipatory\nbail of the accused, she was summoned by the Ld. Magistrate to\nappear and having complied with the said summons, she filed the\napplication for grant of bail under \nSection 439\n Cr.PC on 5.11.2011\non which Ld. MM had passed the order. It is denied that there has\nbeen a concealment of facts by the accused as NBWs were issued\nagainst the accused and also process under \nSection 82\n Cr.PC was\ninitiated against her. It is submitted that the Ld. Magistrate was fully\nwithin her right to pass her orders in terms of the provisions of\nSection 439 Sub Section (1) (i) (ii) Cr.PC.\n\n \nI have duly considered the rival contentions. During the\ncourse of arguments Ld. Addl. PP for the State has vehemently\nargued that the impugned order of the Ld. MM has been improperly\nobtained by concealment of material facts regarding denial of relief\nof anticipatory bail to her by two Ld. Session Judges and also by the\n\n 5\n\n Hon'ble Delhi High Court. He has also submitted that even\notherwise Krishna Sharma being absconding was not entitled to any\ndiscretionary relief on account of her conduct and the Ld. MM has\nseriously faulted by ignoring the said aspect. Ld. Addl. PP has also\npointed out that the one line order passed by the Ld. MM smacks of\narbitrariness reflecting non application of mind being a non-specific\norder. He has placed his reliance in the case of \nJayanti Prasad Goel\nVs. Sumitra Jain\n reported in 1994 (Vol. 28) DRJ 42: 1993 (Vol. 3)\nApex Decision (Del.) 1001 where in a similar matter the Delhi High\nCourt had cancelled the bail granted to the accused keeping in view\nthe gravity of the offence involved.\n\n After having perused the detailed record placed before\nme, I may observe that Firstly after the committal of the case,\ncharges against accused have already been framed and the present\naccused has been duly charged under \nSection 498A\n/\n304B\n/\n34\n Indian\nPenal Code and also under \nSection 302\n Indian Penal Code (in\nterms of the directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Crl. MP No.\n23051/2010 decided on 22.11.2010.)\n Secondly, it is an admitted case of both the prosecution\nand the accused that the first application for grant of anticipatory bail\nwas dismissed by Sh. S. K. Sarvaria, ASJ on 20.8.2011 and after\nwhich second application for grant of anticipatory bail was\ndismissed by the court of Sh. Vinod Kumar, ASJ on 27.9.2011.\nDuring this period, the accused Krishna Sharma absconded and\nNBWs had been issued which could not be executed upon her and\ntherefore the IO had initiated the process under \nSection 82\n Cr.PC\nseeking to declare her an absconder. Further, the accused again took\na chance before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court by moving third\n\n 6\n\n application for grant of anticipatory bail which was dismissed by\nHon'ble Mr. Justice M. L. Mehta on 21.11.2011.\n\n Thirdly it is evident that in the meanwhile, the charge\nsheet being filed against the accused, the Ld. Magistrate issued\nsummons for 22.11.2011 but the accused Krishna Sharma filed an\napplication for exemption before Ld. Magistrate on 22.11.2011 by\nconcealing this fact regarding dismissal of her anticipatory bail\napplication by the Hon'ble High Court due to which she was\nexempted from personal appearance on 22.11.2011 and the Ld.\nMagistrate was pleased to fix the case for 5.12.2011.\n\n Fourthly when the accused Krishna Sharma appeared\nbefore Ld. Magistrate on 5.12.2011 along with other co-accused she\nmoved an application for grant of bail under \nSection 437\n Cr.PC and\nin the said application though she had in a cursory manner mentioned\nthe fact of her third application for grant of anticipatory bail\ndismissed by Delhi High Court on 16.11.2011 (wrong date was\nmentioned in the application by the accused because the said\napplication was dismissed on 21.11.2011) but no such copy of the\norder of Hon'ble High Court was attached along with her application\nand it is on this application that the Ld. Magistrate passed a two\nsentence order as under:\n\n \"Heard. Application stands allowed subject to\n furnishing PB/SB in sum of Rs.35,000/- with one\n surety of like amount.\"\n\n Fifthly anticipatory bail had been granted to the other co-\naccused except the accused Pushpender who was the husband of the\ndeceased and the present accused Krishna. Ld. Sessions Judge,\n\n 7\n\n while dismissing the application for grant of anticipatory bail of the\naccused Krishna on 20.8.2011 had made specific observations that\nthe case of the mother in law (i.e. accused Krishna Devi) was\ndifferent to the case of the other accused who had applied for\nanticipatory bail as they had not been residing with her.\n\n Sixthly the accused Pushpender and Krishna had been\nresiding with the deceased at the time of her death and there were\ndirect demand of money and even prior to her death there was a\nrecent demand of Rs. Five lacs upon the victim by the accused which\nwould attract the offence of dowry death. On 27.9.2011, Ld.\nSessions Judge while dismissing the application of anticipatory bail\nfiled by the present accused had also observed that the suicide note\nof the deceased was very clear wherein the deceased had mentioned\nthat the accused had married to her only for the service of his mother,\ncleaning and cooking and treating her like a maid. It was further\nobserved that even if it is presumed that the deceased herself had\nwritten the said suicide note, it cannot be said that it only implicates\nthe husband as it refers to other persons also has her tormentors. It\nwas further observed by Ld. Session Judge that the mother-in-law\n(Sas) is the person residing in the matrimonial home of the\ndeceased and the said note also alludes to her as well as the other\nrelatives and therefore it was not a fit case to grant of\nanticipatory bail. Again, the Delhi High Court while considering\nthe allegations made against the accused and while dismissing the\nsaid application, had specifically noted that earlier two applications\nfor grant of anticipatory bail had been dismissed by the Ld. Sessions\nJudges vide detailed reasoned orders and therefore filing the petition\nagainst the order of Ld. ASJ was nothing but an abuse to the\n\n 8\n\n process of law. The Hon'ble High Court was also of the similar\nview that keeping in view the seriousness of the offence\ncommitted by the petitioner, no anticipatory bail is granted. This\nbeing the background with three successive bail applications\n(anticipatory) filed by this absconding where then was the question\nfor the Ld. MM to have even considered her application on merits\nand that too without passing a speaking order unless the above facts\nhad been concealed.\n\n Lastly it is writ large that while granting bail to the\npresent accused/ an absconder against whom allegations were of\noffences punishable with maximum punishment extending up to life\nor life, no speaking/ reasoned order was passed by the Ld. Magistrate\nnor the order reflects a notice to the public prosecutor or an effective\nhearing been given to the Public Prosecutor which was mandatory.\n\n \nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nState (Delhi)\nAdministration Vs. Sanjay Gandhi\n, (1978), Vol.\n II, SCC 411 and\nin the case of Gurucharan Singh Vs. State (Delhi Administration)\nAIR 1978 SC 179, has specifically observed that that while\nconsidering the question of cancellation of bail, the higher court can\nalways examine the propriety and legality of the orders passed by\nthe court of Sessions. In the case of Smt. Rajani Rani Kar & Anr.\nVs. Goli Pradhan @ Ors. 1992 (Vol. 3) Crimes, 181, the Orissa\nHigh Court has specifically observed that if it is found that the bail\nto the accused had been granted improperly and arbitrarily the\nsame can be cancelled by the High Court. \nA similar view was taken\nby Delhi High Court in the case of \nJayanti Prasad Goel Vs.\nSumitra Jain\n reported in 1994 (Vol. 28) DRJ 42: 1993 (Vol. 3)\nApex Decision (Del.) 1001.\n\n 9\n\n \nApplying the above settled principles of law to the facts\nof present case, I may observe that as per the provisions of \nSection\n437\n Cr.P.C. Ld. Magistrate has no jurisdiction to consider the\napplication for bail of any offender who is accused of an offence\npunishable more than seven years with an exception provided in case\nof a woman in which case an effective hearing to the Public\nProsecutor is mandatory. In the present case charges have already\nbeen framed against the accused Krishna Sharma under \nSection\n304\n/\n304B\n/\n302\n/\n34\n Indian Penal Code providing for a maximum\npunishment for life or with death and therefore under these\ncircumstances it was mandatory for the Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate\nto have passed a speaking order after an effective hearing to the\nPublic Prosecutor and after due application of mind. The law as \nlaid\ndown by\n the Hon'ble Dehi High Court in the case of \nJayanti\nPrasad Goel Vs. Sumitra Jain\n, is succinctly clear wherein it had\nbeen observed that where a lady is involved in crime of heinous\nnature, the benefit provided under the proviso to \nSection 439 (i)\n\nand (ii) of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, does not warrants\nextending the benefit of said provision to her. (Ref.\n: \nJayanti\nPrasad Goel Vs. Sumitra Jain, Para\n 23). Ld. Sessions Judges and\nthe Hon'ble Delhi High Court having already considered the\naforesaid facts and having dismissed the applications for grant of\nanticipatory bail to the accused, I hereby hold that the manner in\nwhich the accused Krishna Devi was able to procure bail was\nimproper and the order of the Ld. Magistrate does not even reflect\nany application of mind or the fact that the Ld. Magistrate had\nresorted to the application of the proviso to \nSection 1\n of \nSection 437\n\nand Sub Section (iv) of \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n. It is also\n\n 10\n\n evident that the application has been filed on the same day as soon as\nthe accused were produced in the court without any opportunity to\nthe Addl. PP as contemplated in the proviso to \nSection 439 (iv)\n\nCr.P.C. which proviso was substituted in the year 1990 providing\nthat in case where the Ld. Magistrate seeks recourse involves Proviso\n\n(i) of releasing a person on bail and opportunity to hearing the Addl.\nPP is mandatory which hearing is not mere formality but an effective\nhearing, which does not appears to have been given.\n\n It has been observed that recently there is an increasing\ntrend of condemning Judges rather than the judgments and the level\nof ethics not being what it should be or as expected. The interference\nof the higher courts in the orders of the subordinate courts can only\nbe under two circumstances. Firstly when the order of the\nsubordinate court is per-se illegal, irregular, improper or causes\ngrave injustice and secondly when a view different to the one taken\nby the subordinate court is possible. Further, each Court is entitled\nto an opinion on the basis of the material before it which may of\ncourse not always be accepted view and hence it is always open for\nthe Higher Courts to take a view different from the one taken by the\nlower court. We in India have a beautiful system of hierarchy where\nevery order of the Court, lower in hierarchy is subjected to judicial\nreview and corrections. However, not every order which is set aside\nby the Courts higher in hierarchy is erroneous or illegal and in many\ncases the difference being only of perception or opinion. I may also\nobserve that Judges being Human Beings may falter and this Court is\nconscious of the pressure of work and the charged atmosphere in\nwhich the lower courts normally function. Even if the the order of\nLd. Metropolitan Magistrate is erroneous or improper or may even\n\n 11\n\n reflect an element of arbitrariness despite which no malafidies can be\nattributed and it is open to the higher court to correct the same.\n\n In the present case, the order may not per-se be illegal but\nis certainly improper the Ld. MM not having taken into consideration\ntwo successive orders of the Ld. Session Courts and also the order of\nthe Hon'ble Delhi High Court and the impugned order being a non\nspeaking order not reflecting proper application of mind or an\neffective hearing given to the prosecution but I may add that no\nmalafidies can be attribute to the Judge though the Ld. Subordinate\nCourt ought to be much more vigilant.\n\n The order of the Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate dated\n5.12.2011 is hereby set aside being an abuse of process of law. I\nhereby allow the application and direct that the accused Krishna\nSharma be taken into custody forthwith.\n\nAnnounced in the open court (Dr. KAMINI LAU)\nDated: 30.01.2012 ASJ (NW)-II: ROHINI\n\n 12",
