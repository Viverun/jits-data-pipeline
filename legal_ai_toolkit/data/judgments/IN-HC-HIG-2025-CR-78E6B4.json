It is further alleged that with the help of the\n\nvillagers the informant was taken to Taraiya Hospital where his\n\ntreatment is going on. The reason of the alleged incident is the\n\nprevious enmity.\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n4/37\n\n7.

APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n6/37\n\nFindings of the Learned Trial Court\n\n11. Learned trial court after analyzing the evidences on\n\nthe record found that the accused-respondent no.2 was charged\n\nfor the offence under\nSection 302\nIPC and the informant\n\n-appellant in his fardbeyan alleged that the accused had\n\ninflicted two knife blows which finds support from the injury\n\nreport (Exhibit-4) issued by the doctor of Primary Health\n\nCentre. The prosecution witnesses have deposed that there was\n\nargument between the informant and the accused on the point of\n\nmoney for tree of Gullar whereafter the accused caused injury\n\nto the informant and thereafter he was treated at Taraiya\n\nhospital from where he was referred to Sadar hospital, Chapra\n\nwhere x-ray of injured was done but he was not admitted there.\n\nFrom the Exhibit-E brought by the defence learned trial court\n\nfound that injured was treated at Ishwar Dayal Hospital, Patna\n\nand he returned home after getting cured. Thereafter, after 40\n\ndays of the occurrence, on 14.07.2009 the injured was admitted\n\nin PMCH.\n\n12. Learned trial court has held that the informant died\n\nafter 50 days of the occurrence. The Medical Officer has in his\n\nreport given different reasons which are self-contradictory.\n\nAccording to the learned court, the act committed by the\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n7/37\n\naccused does not satisfy the essential ingredients of\nSection 300\n\nIPC. In these circumstances, the learned court acquitted the\n\naccused of the offence under\nSection 302\nIPC.\n\n13. Having taken the aforementioned views, the learned\n\ntrial court held that the accused had assaulted the informant\n\n(since deceased) by a dagger as a result whereof the informant\n\ndied after 50 days. The learned trial court held that this act of\n\nthe accused would come in the category of culpable homicide\n\nas defined under\nSection 299\nIPC. The learned trial court\n\nclearly held that the act of assault by dagger clearly indicates\n\nthat the accused had within his knowledge that the act which he\n\nwas committing can cause death of the informant. The learned\n\ntrial court has recorded that from the post mortem report\n\n(Exhibit '3') issued by the PMCH, it appears that the death of\n\nthe informant has occurred because of the infection and\n\nformation of pus in the wound of the stomach.\n\n14. The learned trial court, however, went to add that\n\nfrom the oral and documentary evidences of the prosecution, it\n\nis evident that the informant (deceased) had not got his\n\ntreatment properly done. Referring to Explanation 2 of\nSection\nof the IPC, the learned trial court held that if appropriate\n\nand skilled treatment would have been provided to the\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n8/37\n\ninformant (deceased), the death could have been avoided. The\n\nlearned trial court has clearly recorded that the informant (the\n\ndeceased) died due to the injury caused by the accused. For\n\nthese reasons, the learned trial court has held the accused\n\n(respondent no. 2 in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023) guilty of\n\nthe offence under\nSection 304\nPart II of the\nIPC\n. The learned\n\ntrial court has awarded a sentence of five years rigorous\n\nimprisonment to the accused with a fine of Rs.20,000/-. In case\n\nof non-payment of fine, the convict shall undergo an additional\n\nimprisonment of three months. The learned trial court has given\n\nbenefit of adjustments of the period already spent in\n\nincarceration in terms of\nSection 428\nCrPC (now\nSection 468\nof\n\nthe Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)).\n\n15. On the point of compensation to the victim under\n\nSection 357\nA(3), the learned trial court has recommended the\n\ncase of the victim to the District Legal Service Authority, Saran,\n\nChapra under the Bihar Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014 for\n\nproviding appropriate compensation.\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the Appellant\nin Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023\n\n16. Learned counsel for the appellant in Cr. Appeal\n\n(DB) No. 203 of 2023 has submitted that despite there being\n\nclinching evidence on the record that the respondent no. 2\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n9/37\n\nintentionally caused the injuries which ultimately led to the\n\ndeath of the informant, the learned trial court has acquitted\n\nrespondent no. 2 on a completely irrelevant and extraneous\n\nconsideration by taking a view that if proper and skilled\n\ntreatment would have been provided to the informant then his\n\nlife could have been saved.\n\n17. Learned counsel submits that the learned trial court\n\nhas found in paragraph '21' of the impugned judgment that the\n\naccused had assaulted the informant by dagger and caused\n\ninjury. The learned trial court has referred the cause of death\n\nshown in the PMCH report wherein it is said to be caused due\n\nto heart attack. The learned trial court has noticed the post\n\nmortem report of Sadar Hospital, Chapra and the opinion of the\n\nDoctor saying that the death of deceased was caused due to\n\ninfection and pus formation. The learned trial court has got\n\ninfluenced only because the death has taken place due to\n\ninfection and pus formation in the wound caused in the stomach\n\nof the deceased.\n\n18. It is submitted that the learned trial court\n\nmisconstrued\nSection 299\nIPC and thereby took a view that\n\nfrom the evidence led by the prosecution, it appears that the\n\ndeceased had not received proper treatment and had he been\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n10/37\n\nproperly treated then his death could have been avoided. It is\n\nsubmitted that such observations of the learned trial court is\n\ncompletely irrelevant and contrary to Explanation 2 to\nSection\nIPC.\n\n19. It is further submitted that in this case the date,\n\ntime, place and manner of occurrence have been duly proved by\n\nthe prosecution. The trial court has accepted the prosecution\n\nstory but instead of convicting the accused under\nSection 302\n\nIPC, convicted him under Part II of\nSection 304\nIPC and\n\nawarded a meagre sentence of only five years rigorous\n\nimprisonment with a fine of Rs.20,000/-.\n\n20. It is submitted that the learned trial court has\n\ngrossly erred in appreciation of evidence. There is a complete\n\nmisunderstanding of Explanation 2 of\nSection 299\nIPC on the\n\npart of the learned trial court and the Exceptions to\nSection 300\n\nIPC. The learned trial court has not recorded any finding that\n\nthe accused had no intention to cause death of the informant.\n\n21. It is submitted that the act of the accused is covered\n\nunder the definition of\nSection 300\nand there was no reason for\n\nthe learned trial court to put it within the category of culpable\n\nhomicide not amounting to murder and then convict the accused\n\nunder Part II of\nSection 304\nIPC.\n\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n11/37\n\nSubmissions on behalf of Respondent No. 2\n\nin Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023\n\n22. Mr. Ansul, learned Senior Counsel representing\n\nrespondent no. 2 in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023 and\n\nsimultaneously arguing the appeal of respondent no. 2 being Cr.\n\nAppeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023, though initially took a plea that in\n\nthis case the place of occurrence has not been duly proved by\n\nthe prosecution and the presence of the son of the informant,\n\nnamely, Arjun Yadav at the place of occurrence and as an eye\n\nwitness cannot be believed but in course of his submissions\n\nwhen he was confronted with the averments made in the protest\n\npetition (Exhibit 'D') filed by the accused in the court of\n\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chapra, Saran vide C 3689 of\n\n2010 (Exhibit 'D') in which the accused has himself stated\n\nabout the occurrence which took place on 04.06.2009 at 04:00\n\nPM in Village Andharwari and has shown the presence of Sabha\n\nRai, Pintu, Baharan Rai, Sunil Kumar Rai out of whom Baharan\n\nRai (PW-2) and Sabha Rai (PW-5) have deposed as prosecution\n\nwitnesses and then the fardbeyan of Kameshwar Rai which is\n\nthe basis of the FIR in which he has clearly stated about the\n\npresence of his son Arun Rai with him at the time of\n\noccurrence, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no. 2 has\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n12/37\n\nnot pressed this plea.\n\n23. Learned Senior Counsel submits that he would\n\nconfine his submissions to the extent that in this case the\n\nalleged injury caused by the respondent no. 2 is not the\n\nproximate cause of death. Learned Senior Counsel has relied\n\nupon a Division Bench judgment of the Hon'ble Madhya\n\nPradesh High Court in\nImran Khan versus State of Madhya\n\nPradesh\nreported in 1994 MPLJ 862 to submit that an act is\n\nsaid to be a cause of death when the death result from the act\n\nitself and from some consequences necessarily or naturally\n\nflowing from the act and reasonably contemplated as its result.\n\nIt is his submission in this case the chain of consequences stood\n\nbroken as the informant (deceased) was admitted in PMCH\n\nafter 40 days of the occurrence and he ultimately died as a\n\nresult of the infection suffered and the pus formed in the\n\nwound.\n\n24. It is his submission that there was an unexpected\n\ncomplication which would be in the nature of a new mischief\n\nand the relation of cause and effect or the causal connection is\n\ntoo remote. It is his submission that the proximate cause of\n\ndeath being the infection and formation of pus in the wound,\n\nthe respondent no. 2 would not be liable to be convicted under\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n13/37\n\nSection 302\nIPC. It is his submission that in this case the report\n\nof PMCH as enclosed with the Letter No. 6143 dated\n\n17.04.2015 (Exhibit 'B') shows that the Doctor noticed on\n\nadmission of the informant that it was an old case of stab injury\n\nfor which exploratory laprotomy was done in Ishwar Dayal\n\nHospital where colostomy was done. The Doctor noticed loose\n\nwatery stool coming out from colostomy wound and wound\n\ndehiscence. The informant (deceased) remained admitted in\n\nPMCH for about 10 days. He was declared dead clinically on\n\nthe basis of the findings: pulse-absent; BP- not recordable; heart\n\nS./breath S.- not audible; pupil- B/L dilated and fixed; mode of\n\ndeath- cardio pulm. Arrest.\n\nSubmissions of the State\nin Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023\n\n25. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State\n\nhas opposed Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023. It is submitted\n\nthat the challenge to the impugned judgment of conviction has\n\nno plausible basis and it is liable to fail. The learned trial court\n\nhas rightly appreciated the entire evidence on the record and\n\nhaving found that the date, time, place and manner of\n\noccurrence have been duly proved by the prosecution,\n\nconvicted the accused for the offence of culpable homicide not\n\namounting to murder and sentenced him to undergo a rigorous\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n14/37\n\nimprisonment of five years with a fine of Rs.20,000/-.\n\nConsideration\n\n26. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant in\n\nboth the appeals simultaneously and learned Additional Public\n\nProsecutor for the State.\n\n27. As recorded hereinabove, in course of hearing of\n\nthe appeals, learned Senior Counsel for the convict-appellant in\n\nCr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023 has given up his submissions\n\nwith regard to the place of occurrence and the credibility of the\n\neye witness as also finding of the learned trial court that the\n\ncause of death in this case is the injury caused by the accused\n\nbut the sole contention of learned Senior Counsel for the said\n\nappellant while arguing on his behalf as respondent no. 2 in Cr.\n\nAppeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023 is that the death of the informant\n\n(deceased) has resulted due to the new mischief in form of\n\ninfection and pus in the wound, therefore, the learned trial court\n\nhas not committed any error in convicting the respondent no. 2\n\nonly for the culpable homicide not amounting to murder and\n\npunished him under Part II of\nSection 304\nof the IPC.\n\n28. Notwithstanding the fact that learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the appellant in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023\n\nand respondent no. 2 in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023 has\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n15/37\n\nconfined his submissions, this Court takes it as its' duty to go\n\nthrough the entire evidences on the record, re-appreciate it and\n\nsatisfy itself that the prosecution has duly proved its' case\n\nbeyond all reasonable doubt.\n\n29. We have examined the evidences available on the\n\nrecord. Binda Raut (PW-1) is an eye witness of the occurrence.\n\nHe is a resident of village Andharwari. He has stated that he\n\nwas in his house when Kameshwar Rai (the deceased) was\n\ncoming after grinding flour and Baijnath Singh also reached\n\nthere. His son was also with him. This witness has not stated\n\nany quarrel having taken place in front of his house. He has\n\nstated that Baijnath Singh inflicted dagger in right side on to the\n\nstomach of Kameshwar Rai. Intenstine had come out and\n\nprofused bleeding took place. Kameshwar Rai was taken to\n\nhospital at Chapra and from Chapra he was taken to Patna. In\n\nhis cross-examination, this witness has stated that the\n\noccurrence had taken place in front of house of Ram Pravesh\n\nRai. He knows Rajendra Rai and Ram Pravesh Rai who are full\n\nbrothers and their houses are within a distance of one meter. He\n\nhas stated that Kameshwar Rai came home after one and half/\n\ntwo months of treatment from hospital but after some\n\ncomplications occurred in the wound, he again went to the\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n16/37\n\nhospital. This witness has not been suggested by defence that\n\nthere was any sudden quarrel between the informant and the\n\nrespondent no. 2.\n\n30. Baharan Rai (PW-2) is another villager of village\n\nAndharwari. He has stated that he heard hulla and when he\n\nreached there then he saw that some altercation was taking\n\nplace between Kameshwar Rai and Baijnath Singh, on that,\n\nBaijnath Singh took out a dagger and assaulted Kameshwar Rai\n\nwhich caused injury at three places. People assembled then they\n\ntook Kameshwar Rai to hospital. In his cross-examination, he\n\nhas stated that the occurrence has taken place in front of the\n\nhouse of Ram Pravesh Rai. His house is situated at a distance of\n\nten laggis from the house of Ram Pravesh Rai. He has\n\nexplained that one laggi is equal to ten hands and his house is\n\nsituated at a distance of hundred hands. Again, from the\n\nevidence of this witness, it appears that the Respondent No. 2\n\nwas armed with dagger and while having some altercation in\n\nform of oral shoutings, he took out the dagger and assaulted the\n\ninformant. This witness has seen the occurrence.\n\n31. Arjun Rai (PW-3) is the son of the deceased. He is\n\nan eye witness to the occurrence. In the fardbeyan, the\n\ninformant has stated about the presence of his son Arjun Rai\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n17/37\n\n(PW-3) with him at the time of occurrence. PW-3 has stated that\n\nhe was coming with his father by foot after grinding flour from\n\nthe flour mill which was kept on a bicycle and when they\n\nreached near the house of Ram Pravesh Rai then from Taraiya\n\nside, Baijnath Singh came on a motorcycle. There was an oral\n\nexchange of words over the Gullar Tree on which Baijnath\n\nSingh took out a dagger and assaulted on the right shoulder of\n\nhis father and then he penetrated the dagger in the left side on to\n\nthe stomach. This witness tied the wound by his gamchha and\n\ntried to catch hold of Baijnath Singh but Baijnath Singh chased\n\nhim to assault. PW-3 has stated that he fled whereafter the\n\nvillagers assembled. Baijnath Singh had left his motorcycle\n\nthere. The father of this witness was taken to Taraiya Hospital\n\nfrom where he was referred to Chapra Sadar Hospital and then\n\nfrom Chapra, he was referred to PMCH but he was taken to\n\nIshwar Dayal Hospital where he was operated upon. PW-3 has\n\nstated that in course of the treatment, his father died. In Taraiya\n\nHospital, the statement of his father was recorded, his father\n\nhad put his signature on his statement. This witness had also put\n\nhis signature on the fardbeyan. He has identified the signature\n\nof his father on the fardbeyan as Exhibit '1' and his own\n\nsignature as Exhibit '1/1'.\n\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n18/37\n\n32. In his cross-examination, this witness has stated that\n\nhis home is village-Sitalpatti. Occurrence took place in the\n\nvillage 'Andharwari'. There are 10/12 houses in village\n\nAndharwari and the houses are situated at a distance of 2-4\n\nsteps. He has stated that his father was assaulted for about 10/5\n\nminutes. He was not assaulted and he had not tried to save him.\n\nHe had seen the assault by dagger. The pointed part was\n\npenetrated. He has made it clear in his cross-examination that\n\nthe house of Rajendra Rai and Ram Pravesh Rai are situated at\n\na distance of one laggi meaning thereby at a distance of seven\n\nhands. This is important to note because in the fardbeyan the\n\ninformant has stated that the occurrence had taken place in front\n\nof the house of Rajendra Rai but in course of evidence it has\n\ntranspired that Rajendra Rai and Ram Pravesh Rai are both\n\nbrothers and their houses are situated at a distance of one laggi\n\nonly.\n\n33. This Court has, therefore, found that the statement\n\nof the informant that the occurrence had taken place in front of\n\nthe house of Rajendra Rai cannot be taken to establish any\n\ndispute with respect to the place of occurrence. It is to be\n\nremembered that the occurrence had taken place in another\n\nvillage where the deceased had gone with his son for grinding\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n19/37\n\nflour and he was assaulted by Respondent No. 2 on his way in\n\nfront of the house of Ram Pravesh Rai. The I.O. has also\n\nestablished the place of occurrence being in front of the house\n\nof Ram Pravesh Rai. Considering the distance between the\n\nhouses of the two brothers being only a distance of seven hands\n\nwhich is equivalent to one laggi, it cannot be said to be a\n\nmaterial discrepancy.\n\n34. It is found that in course of cross-examination of\n\nPW-3, he was suggested that Baijnath Singh had also lodged a\n\ncase. This witness said that he was not aware of it. Thereafter,\n\nthe defence did not prove any documentary evidence to show\n\nthat Baijnath Singh had lodged a case. All that has been proved\n\nby defence is a protest petition which has been marked Exhibit\n\n'D'.\n\n35. The defence further suggested PW-3 that Baijnath\n\nSingh (accused) had suffered injury but in course of trial, the\n\ndefence has not brought on record any injury report of Baijnath\n\nSingh (Respondent No. 2). No oral evidence has been adduced\n\nin this regard even though in protest petition, Baijnath Singh\n\nclaimed that he had gone to Chapra Hospital for his treatment.\n\nThus, the defence has not proved by leading any cogent\n\nevidence that Baijnath Singh had suffered any injury in the said\nPatna High Court CR.

On perusal of the evidence of PW-3 coupled with\n\nthe fardbeyan of the informant (Exhibit '2'), it is evident that he\n\nis an eye witness to the occurrence. He is the son of the\n\ndeceased. PW-1 has also said about the presence of PW-3 with\n\nhis father. PW-3 has withstood the test of cross-examination\n\nand no material contradictions have been shown to this Court in\n\nhis evidence. The defence suggested PW-3 that occurrence is\n\nsaid to have taken place in front of the house of Rajendra Rai\n\nand no occurrence had taken place in front of the house of Ram\n\nPravesh Rai. PW-3 denied the suggestion.\n\n36. Surendra Rai (PW-4) is an independent witness of\n\nvillage Andharwari. He had seen Kameshwar at the place of\n\noccurrence immediately after the occurrence. He has stated that\n\nwhen he heard hulla at his bathan and went ahead to that place,\n\nhe found that Kameshwar Rai had suffered dagger injury in the\n\nleft and right side of his stomach. Baijnath Singh had assaulted.\n\nArjun son of Kameshwar Rai had fled away. Kameshwar Rai\n\nwas taken to hospital. This witness is, however, not an eye\n\nwitness to the occurrence and he has stated that he had not seen\n\nthe assault by dagger.\n\n37. Sabha Rai (PW-5) is another eye witness to the\n\noccurrence who has stated that there was a talk with regard to\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n21/37\n\nmoney on account of Gullar Tree, on this Baijnath Singh took\n\nout a dagger and penetrated the same in the left side of the\n\npanjara of Kameshwar Rai and second time assaulted on his\n\nshoulder. He had chased this witness and Arjun (PW-3). This\n\nwitness stated that he fled away raising hulla whereafter\n\nvillagers assembled. He identified the accused. This witness has\n\nstated in his cross-examination that he is the brother in Gotiya\n\nof Kameshwar Rai. He has given the description of the place of\n\noccurrence. He has stated that in South there is house of Ram\n\nPravesh and Rajendra. In East, atta-chakki. PW-4 has stated that\n\nhe is doing chowkidari. Thus, this witness corroborates the\n\nstatement of PW-3 with regard to place of occurrence. He has\n\nstated that blood had fallen on the earth. He has stated that\n\nbefore he could have reached, Baijnath Singh had already\n\nreached there. When this witness reached there, he saw\n\nKameshwar Rai was bleeding whereafter he ran and raised\n\nhulla.\n\n38. Sachidanand Singh (PW-6) is the I.O. of the case.\n\nHe has proved the fardbeyan recorded by Asim Khan. It has\n\nbeen marked Exhibit '2'. He had taken the charge of\n\ninvestigation and proceeded to the place of occurrence on\n\n05.06.2009. He was shown the place of occurrence by Baharan\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n22/37\n\nRai (PW-2). The I.O. has proved the place of occurrence as the\n\npucci road North to the house of Ram Pravesh Rai. Road is\n\nEast-West. He has given the description of the place of\n\noccurrence. He has stated that he did not find any noticeable\n\nthing. The road is a very busy road. He recorded the statement\n\nof witness. Later on, he came to know that the injured died\n\nduring his treatment. He had received the post-mortem report\n\nand had filed the chargesheet.\n\nIn his cross-examination, he has stated to have recorded the\n\nre-statement of Kameshwar Rai at Sitalpatti. When he had\n\nrecorded the re-statement of Kameshwar at that time, he had\n\nwounds, when there was some healing he had come back but\n\nthereafter his condition worsened and he again went to Patna.\n\nHe has stated that there is no counter case of this case. Case No.\n\n17/10 Taraiya P.S. was registered after this case. This Court has\n\nnoticed from the protest petition (Exhibit 'D') that the\n\ninformant has mentioned about the case registered on\n\n15.03.2010 in Taraiya P.S. on the basis of a Complaint Case No.\n\n1919/09 dated 12.06.2009.\n\n39. This Court finds that in this case, the date of\n\noccurrence is 04.06.2009. This private complaint was filed after\n\n8 days of the occurrence. In this case, the respondent no. 2 has\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n23/37\n\nnot brought any evidence showing any injury to him. Thus, the\n\nI.O. has stated that there was no counter case of the present\n\ncase.\n\n40. Dr. Muneshwar Prasad Singh (PW-7) was the\n\nMedical Officer in the Sadar Hospital, Chapra who has\n\nconducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased. He had\n\nfound the following injuries:-\n\n\"(i) one partially healed infected wound about 3/4\" x\n1/4\" on the left side of upper part of abdomen with\nsurrounding excoriation of skin.\n\n(ii) One infected wound about 1\"x1\" with\nsurrounding 5 stitches with granulation and\nexcoriation around the wound.\n\n(iii) The abdomen was open in the mid line upper part\n6\"x3\" with marks of stitches on the wound margins -\n\nrectus muscle being visible through the gaping wound\nwith granulation and infection material over it, bluish\ndiscolouration in the lower part.\"\n\n41. PW-7 deposed on the injuries suffered by\n\nKameshwar Rai which he noticed in course of postmortem. He\n\nhas recorded that \"shock and exhaustion due to infection of the\n\nwounds, gaping of the abdominal wound and injury to intestine\n\nwere the cause of death\". He has further opined that all the\n\ninjuries may be possible by chura. He has proved the post\n\nmortem report which has been marked Exhibit '3'. In his cross-\n\nexamination, PW-7 has stated that \"there are many causes of\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n24/37\n\ninfection. Carelessness of patient may be one of the causes of\n\ninfection. If proper treatment was held, there was least chance\n\nof infection. The pus formation was held in the intestine. The\n\ndeath of the deceased was caused due to infection and pus\n\nformation\".\n\n42. It is evident from the deposition of Doctor (PW-7)\n\nthat the wound caused to the deceased had developed infection\n\nand pus formation had taken place which proved fatal and the\n\ninformant died. Explanation 2 to\nSection 299\nIPC takes care of\n\nthis aspect of the matter. It is evident that the death had taken\n\nplace because of the injury caused to the deceased.\n\n43. We have further noticed the evidence of another Dr.\n\nSurendra Prasad Singh (PW-9) who had examined the\n\ninformant in the Referral Hospital, Taraiya on 04.06.2009. He\n\nhad found the following injuries on his body:-\n\n\"(1) incised wound 2\" x 1\" deep to chest cavity on\nthe lower part of the back of chest on the left side.\n(2) Incised wound on the right shoulder joint about\n1\" x ½\" x skin deep.\n\nOpinion of the both injury reserved and Patient is\nreferred to Sadar Hospital Chapra for further and\nproper treatment.\n\nMark of Identification - a mole on left upper arm.\"\n\n44. PW-9 has proved the injury report (Exhibit '4'). It\n\nclearly shows that he had found incised wound deep to chest\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n25/37\n\ncavity on the lower part of the back of the chest and incised\n\nwound on the right shoulder joint. Thus, the prosecution story\n\nof two repeated dagger blow inflicted by the accused\n\n(respondent no. 2) has been duly proved.\n\n45. One of the witnesses, namely, Shri Bhagwan Rai\n\n(PW-8) has been declared hostile. He was cross-examined by\n\nthe prosecution and his attention was drawn towards his\n\nprevious statement made before police. He has stated in his\n\ncross-examination that he knew Baijnath Singh because he is\n\nDak Munshi but he did not know about the occurrence.\n\n46. We have noticed that the prosecution has duly\n\nproved the inquest report (Exhibit '5) and the post mortem\n\nreport as also report of the PMCH to show that two repeated\n\ndagger blow were given to the deceased one of which\n\nultimately proved fatal to the life of the informant\n\n47. This Court finds that in this case, the prosecution\n\nhas proved the date, time, place and manner of occurrence.\n\nProsecution witnesses are reliable, they have withstood the test\n\nof cross-examination. The defence has, though questioned the\n\nplace of occurrence but it is well proved that Ram Pravesh and\n\nRajendra are brothers, they have their houses besides each other\n\nwhich is hardly situated at a distance of one 'laggi' only. I.O.\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n26/37\n\nhas given the description of the place of occurrence. The\n\nwitnesses are consistent that the informant was attacked by\n\nrespondent no. 2 (Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023) and he\n\npenetrated dagger into the left side on to the stomach of the\n\ninformant.\n\n48. We have been left with the sole argument of\n\nrespondent no. 2 that the proximate cause of death of the\n\ninformant in this case is not relatable to the actual death. We\n\nwill examine this submission of learned Senior Counsel for the\n\nrespondent no. 2 hereinafter.\n\n49.\nSection 299\nIPC on which the learned trial court has\n\nplaced reliance reads as under:-\n\n\"299. Culpable homicide.--Whoever causes death\nby doing an act with the intention of causing death, or\nwith the intention of causing such bodily injury as is\nlikely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is\nlikely by such act to cause death, commits the offence\nof culpable homicide.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention\nof thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that\ndeath is likely to be thereby caused.

But it may\namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a\nliving child, if any part of that child has been brought\nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been\ncompletely born.\"\n\n50.\nSection 300\nIPC is the charging Section which\n\ndefines 'murder'.\nSection 300\nwith its five explanations are\n\nbeing reproduced hereunder for a ready reference:-\n\n\"300. Murder.--Except in the cases hereinafter\nexcepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of\ncausing death, or--\n\n2ndly.--If it is done with the intention of causing\nsuch bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely\nPatna High Court CR.

Z dies\nin consequence. A commits murder.\n\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a\ndisease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes\nhim with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies\nin consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder,\nalthough the blow might not have been sufficient in\nthe ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a\nperson in a sound state of health. But if A, not\nknowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives\nhim such a blow as would not in the ordinary course\nof nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here\nA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is\nnot guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause\ndeath, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course\nof nature would cause death.\n\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound\nsufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary\ncourse of nature.

A is guilty of\nmurder, although he may not have had a premeditated\ndesign to kill any particular individual.\n\nException 1.--When culpable homicide is not\nmurder.--Culpable homicide is not murder if the\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control\nby grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of\nthe person who gave the provocation or causes the\ndeath of any other person by mistake or accident.\nThe above exception is subject to the following\nprovisos:--\n\nFirst.--That the provocation is not sought or\nvoluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for\nkilling or doing harm to any person.\nSecondly.--That the provocation is not given by\nanything done in obedience to the law, or by a public\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such\npublic servant.\n\nThirdly.--That the provocation is not given by\nanything done in the lawful exercise of the right of\nprivate defence.\n\nExplanation.--Whether the provocation was grave\nand sudden enough to prevent the offence from\namounting to murder is a question of fact.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a\nprovocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child.\n\nThis is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not\ngiven by the child, and the death of the child was not\ncaused by accident or misfortune in doing an act\ncaused by the provocation.\n\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on\nthis provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending\nnor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near\nhim, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not\nPatna High Court CR.

A is excited to\nsudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z.\nThis is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was\ngiven by a thing done by a public servant in the\nexercise of his powers.\n\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z\nsays that he does not believe a word of A's deposition,\nand that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden\npassion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.\n\n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the\nright of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him\nfrom doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent\npassion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder,\ninasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing\ndone in the exercise of the right of private defence.\n\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to\nviolent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take\nadvantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts\na knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with\nthe knife. Here B may have committed only culpable\nhomicide, but A is guilty of murder.\n\nException 2.--Culpable homicide is not murder if the\noffender in the exercise in good faith of the right of\nprivate defence of person or property, exceeds the\npower given to him by law and causes the death of the\nperson against whom he is exercising such right of\ndefence without premeditation, and without any\nintention of doing more harm than is necessary for the\npurpose of such defence.\n\nIllustration\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to\ncause grievous hurt to A.

Here, on\naccount of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving\nconsent to his own death; A has therefore abetted\nmurder.\"\n\n51. On a bare perusal of Explanation 2 to\nSection 299\n\nIPC, it would appear that where death is caused by bodily\n\ninjury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be\n\ndeemed to have caused death, although by resorting to proper\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n32/37\n\nremedies and skillful treatment, the death might have been\n\nprevented. The learned trial court has understood otherwise. It\n\nhas taken a view that with proper and skillful treatment of the\n\ninformant, the death could have been avoided and the infection\n\nas well as formation of pus in the wound is the cause of death.\n\nThis seems to have prevailed upon the learned trial court.\n\n52. Further, we find that the learned trial court has held\n\nthat it is a culpable homicide. The learned trial court, however,\n\nerred in taking a view that it is a case of culpable homicide not\n\namounting to murder. In this case, respondent no. 2 has inflicted\n\ntwo dagger blows upon the informant. One of the dagger blows\n\ncould hit on the shoulder but it is nearer to the neck, luckily the\n\ninformant suffered only a skin deep injury on his shoulder but\n\nthe another blow was fatal, it hit on a vital part of the body and\n\nthere is no iota of doubt that the dagger blows were inflicted\n\nwith intention of causing such bodily injury which the\n\nrespondent no. 2 knew to be likely to cause death of the person\n\nto whom such an injury is caused and the injuries is sufficient in\n\nan ordinary cause of nature to cause death. The intention of the\n\nappellant to kill the informant is found in the fact that he twice\n\nattacked the informant aiming vital part of the body. The blow\n\nsuffered by the informant on his shoulder could have hit any\nPatna High Court CR.

The observations of the learned trial court that had\n\nthere been a proper and skilled treatment, the death could have\n\nbeen avoided, cannot come to the rescue of the accused\n\n(respondent no. 2).\n\n56. The act of respondent no. 2 is apparently covered\n\nunder\nSection 300\nIPC.\n\n57. We have taken note of the five Exceptions\n\nhereinabove. It is not the case of defence that the dagger blow\n\nwas inflicted upon the informant due to any sudden and grave\n\nprovocation. The case would not fall in either of the Exceptions\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n34/37\n\n1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Some of the prosecution witnesses have stated\n\nthat there were exchange of words between the informant and\n\nthe respondent no. 2 when respondent no. 2 took out a dagger\n\nand assaulted the informant twice. It is not a case of grave and\n\nsudden provocation. The fact that the respondent no. 2 was\n\ncarrying a dangerous weapon such as a dagger with him and he\n\nintercepted the informant in another village 'Andharwari',\n\nstabbed him and gave repeated dagger blow only proves that\n\nthe accused-respondent no. 2 had intercepted the informant with\n\na pre-meditation of mind, armed with a weapon in his\n\npossession, he stopped, indulged in exchange of words, took\n\nout his dagger, stabbed the informant and fled away.\n\n58. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no. 2\n\nhas relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Madhya\n\nPradesh in the case of\nImran Khan\n(supra) but we find that\n\nwhat has been held by the Hon'ble High Court in paragraph\n\n'11' of the judgment would go against respondent no. 2.\n\nParagraph '11' of the judgment in the case of\nImran Khan\n\n(supra) reads as under:-\n\n\"11. An act is said to cause death when death\nresults from the act itself or from some\nconsequences necessarily or naturally flowing\nfrom the act, and reasonably contemplated as its\nresult.

The cause must not only be the cause a\nsine qua non, but it must also be a cause\nreasonably proximate, but the doctrine of\ncriminal creation has reasonable limits. An injury\nmay lead to death. Death may be instantaneous\nor may be delayed. The injury may lead to shock,\nexcessive bleeding, coma, syncope etc. and cause\ndeath; in such a case, injury and death have a\nclearly perceptible and direct nexus and there\nwill be no difficulty in finding that death is the\ndirect result of injury. The decision may not be\nso easy in a case where death is caused not\ndirectly by the injury itself, but due to a\ncomplication or development or in a case where\ndeath is delayed or due to a later complication or\ndevelopment, court has to consider the nature of\nthe injury, complication or development and\nattendant circumstances. If the complication or\ndevelopment is the natural or probable or\nnecessary consequence of the injury and if it is\nreasonably contemplated as its result, the injury\ncan be said to have caused death. If, on the other\nhand, the chain of consequences is broken or if\nthere is unexpected complication causing new\nmischief, the relation of cause and effect is not\nestablished or the causal connection is too\nremote and the injury cannot be said to have\ncause death.

In the kind of materials present on the record, we\n\nfind that the prosecution has been able to prove a case of\n\n'murder' as defined under\nSection 300\nIPC. The learned trial\n\ncourt has erred in acquitting the accused-respondent no. 2 of the\n\ncharge under\nSection 302\nIPC. This Court reaches to an\n\nirresistible conclusion that the respondent no. 2 assaulted the\n\ninformant with a pre-meditation of mind, intentionally caused\n\ntwo injuries, one of which hit on the vital part of the body\n\nwhich was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause\n\ndeath.\n\n60. This Court would, therefore, allow the Cr. Appeal\n\n(DB) No. 203 of 2023. The respondent no. 2 is held guilty of\n\ncommission of offence punishable under\nSection 302\nIPC. The\n\nconviction of respondent no. 2 is altered from\nSection 304\nPart\n\nII to\nSection 302\nIPC.\n\n61. For the reasons discussed hereinabove, we find no\n\nmerit in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023. Hence, Cr. Appeal\n\n(SJ) No. 119 of 2023 is dismissed.\n\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n37/37\n\n62. The respondent no. 2 is on bail. His bail bond is\n\ncancelled and he is taken into custody. He will be sent to Beur\n\nJail for the present.\n\n63. As prayed by learned Senior Counsel for\n\nrespondent no.2, the records are kept for hearing on sentence\n\nday after tomorrow i.e. 07.05.2025. Respondent No.2 shall be\n\nproduced before this Court on 07.05.2025 at the time of hearing\n\non sentence.\n\n(Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J)\n\n( Ashok Kumar Pandey, J)\narvind/sushma2-\n\nAFR/NAFR AFR\nCAV DATE 01.05.2025\nUploading Date 05.05.2025\nTransmission Date 05.05.2025",
