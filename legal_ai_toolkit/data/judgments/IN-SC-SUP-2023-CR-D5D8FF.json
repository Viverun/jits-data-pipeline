Trivedi\n,\nDinesh Maheshwari\n\nREPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 762 OF 2012\n\nVAHITHA …………..APPELLANT(S)\n\nVERSUS\n\nSTATE OF TAMIL NADU ..…..RESPONDENT(S)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nDINESH MAHESHWARI, J.\n\n1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and\n\norder dated 09.03.2010 in Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 2010, whereby the High\n\nCourt of Judicature at Madras has dismissed the appeal against the\n\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 15.10.2009, as passed\n\nby the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Perambalur in Sessions Case No. 9\n\nof 2008, holding the appellant guilty of the offence punishable under\n\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code, 18601 and awarding her the\n\npunishment of imprisonment for life and fine of Rs. 2,000/- with default\n\nstipulations.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nARJUN BISHT\n\nDate: 2023.02.22\n\n15:15:52 IST\n\nReason:\n\n1 ‘\nIPC\n’, for short.\n2. In a brief outline, it could be noticed that in this case, the appellant\n\nhas been convicted of the offence of murder of her five-year-old child in the\n\nhouse of her mother-in-law at Perambalur in the morning of 21.06.2007.\n\nAccording to the prosecution case, the appellant’s husband was living\n\nabroad for earning livelihood and the appellant was mostly living with her\n\nfather at Kolakkudi. However, on being forced to live with her mother-in-\n\nlaw for the purpose of upbringing and education of the child, she found the\n\nchild to be an obstacle in her desire to live separate and hence,\n\nstrangulated the child to death when her mother-in-law had gone out of the\n\nhouse. It was alleged that the appellant was last seen with the child and\n\nafter having killed the child, when her mother-in-law and other witnesses\n\nreached the scene of crime, she ran away and was apprehended in the late\n\nafternoon at Perambalur New Bus Stand. As per the post-mortem report,\n\nthe cause of death of the child was asphyxia because of strangulation. In\n\nthe trial, all but one prosecution witnesses supported the accusations\n\nagainst the appellant. Only the father of the appellant deposed to the\n\ncontrary and asserted that at the relevant point of time, the appellant was\n\nwith him at Kolakkudi and he accompanied her to Perambalur after\n\nreceiving information about death of the child. After appreciation of\n\nevidence, the Trial Court, in its judgment dated 15.10.2009, rejected the\n\nplea of alibi taken on behalf of the accused-appellant and held proved that\n\nthe victim child died of asphyxia because of strangulation and was last seen\n\nalive with the appellant, who failed to explain the circumstances in which\nthe child died. Hence, the appellant was convicted of the offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 302\nIPC and was sentenced accordingly. In\n\nappeal, the High Court concurred with the findings of the Trial Court while\n\nholding that the ingredients establishing culpability of the appellant were\n\nclearly established on record.\n\n2.1. In this appeal, the concurrent findings of the two Courts have been\n\nquestioned essentially with reference to certain discrepancies in the\n\nversion of the prosecution witnesses and on the ground that the\n\nprosecution has failed to establish a chain of cogent circumstances which\n\ncould lead to the only hypothesis that the appellant had killed her own child.\n\nThese submissions have been countered with reference to the evidence of\n\nthe prosecution and findings of the two Courts.\n\n3. Having regard to the submissions made and the questions arising\n\nfor determination, we may take note of the relevant factual and background\n\naspects as follows:\n\n3.1. In this case, the First Information Report2, bearing No. 328 of 2007\n\nwas registered at Perambalur Police Station at around 9.00 a.m. on\n\n21.06.2007 on the information furnished by PW-1 Basheera, mother-in-law\n\nof the appellant, about killing of the victim child by her own mother, that is,\n\nthe appellant. The relevant contents of the FIR, said to have been scribed\n\nby PW-10 Subbulakshmi, SI, Perambalur, read as under:3 -\n\n“…As my grand daughter is 5 years old, my son had spoken from\nRiyat to Kolakkudi and said that she has to go to Perambalur and\n\n2 ‘FIR’, for short.\n\n3 The extractions in this judgment are from the translated copies placed on record.\nstay in my house and educate the child. Hence, Vahida was brought\nby her father on 18.6.07 along with grand daughter Farhana and\ndropped in my house at Perambalur. For two days after her arrival\nshe did not properly have the food and also did not speak to me\nproperly and my daughter-in-law Vahida picked up quarrel with me\nand was telling me that she is going to Kolakkudi. As I had warned\nher not to go to Kolakkudi, she was telling that only because of this\nchild, I could not live peacefully. My husband is suspecting me. You\nare also not allowing me to go to Kolakkudi. Only if I finish off this\nchild, I shall live peacefully. I, my daughter Mumtaz, my 2 nd\ndaughter-in-law Asha, and the Kamala, my neighbour together had\nwarned her on the night of 20.6.2007. On 21.06.2007 at about 8.00\nA.M. I said that I will go and get idli for the child. She said that I\ncould not educate my child here and she wanted to go to Kolakkudi.\nHence, there was a quarrel picked up between me and my\ndaughter-in-law Vaheetha. I told her let us see and went to get the\nidli. By that time, my daughter Mumtaz and my daughter-in-law\nAsha came to see me. I being left the home for buying idli without\ntaking money went along with them came to house to take the\nmoney. By that time my daughter-in-law Vaheetha, was tying the\nneck of my grand daughter Farhana who is aged five years with the\nouter end of a saree (mundanai) portion of her saree and was\nholding it tight. After seeing this I shouted why are you killing my\ngrandchild. Besides, holding my grandchild’s neck with the saree\nand killing her, she had pushed us and ran away through the\nentrance. The neighbours Kamala and Jayaraman came running\nthere, after hearing my scream. I touched the child. She was\ndead…”\n\n3.2. After registration of the FIR (Ex.P10), PW-12 Thiru G. Ayyanar, the\n\nfirst Investigating Officer4 reached the place of occurrence, photographs of\n\nthe dead body (Ex. P11) were taken; the rough sketch (Ex. P12) and\n\ninquest report (Ex. P13) were prepared; and the dead body was sent for\n\npost-mortem examination. As per the post-mortem report (Ex. P5), there\n\nwas a wound around the neck of the victim child measuring 20 cm in length\n\nand 2 cm in breadth; and victim died due to asphyxia because of\n\nstrangulation.\n‘IO’, for short.\n3.3. According to the first IO, PW-12 Thiru G. Ayyanar, the appellant\n\nwas arrested at about 5.00 p.m. near a ladies washroom at the Perambalur\n\nNew Bus Stand, i.e., approximately nine hours after the occurrence. It was\n\nalleged that after her arrest, the appellant identified the saree by which the\n\nchild was strangulated; that the saree allegedly carrying blood-stains was\n\nseized in the presence of attesting witnesses; and that following her arrest,\n\nthe appellant made a confessional statement that was recorded by PW-12\n\nin the presence of witnesses. Later on, the investigation was taken over by\n\nPW-14 D. Sivasubramanian, who filed the charge-sheet for the offence\n\nunder\nSection 302\nIPC against the appellant. After committal, and upon\n\ndenial of charge by the appellant, the case was tried as Sessions Case No.\n\n9 of 2008 by the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Perambalur.\n\n4. In trial, a total of fourteen witnesses were examined by the\n\nprosecution. The first witness PW-1 Basheera, mother-in-law of the\n\nappellant and the informant, was examined as the key witness related with\n\nthe occurrence. Four other witnesses, PW-2 Mumtaz, daughter of PW-1;\n\nPW-3 Asha Begum, other daughter-in-law of PW-1; PW-4 Sharfunisha,\n\nlandlord of PW-1; and PW-5 Thiru-Jothi, neighbour of PW-1 were claimed\n\nto be the witnesses who reached the scene of crime immediately after the\n\noccurrence. PW-8 Dr. Saravanan and PW-13 Dr. Karthikeyan A. testified\n\nrespectively to the post-mortem report and the report with respect to the\n\nthyroid cartilage bone of the victim child. PW-9 Devaraj, Village\n\nAdministrative Officer and PW-7 Sadiq Ali were examined as attesting\nwitnesses related with the process of investigation. PW-10 Subbulakshmi\n\nhad recorded the statement of PW-1 and scribed the FIR whereas PW-11\n\nMohammed Munwar Khan was the photographer who had taken\n\nphotographs at the scene of occurrence. As noticed, PW-12 Thiru G.\n\nAyyanar carried out the initial investigation whereas PW-14 D.\n\nSivasubramanian, SI, Perambalur completed the investigation and filed\n\ncharge-sheet. Apart from these witnesses who supported the prosecution\n\ncase, there had been another witness PW-6 Jamal Mohammed, father of\n\nthe appellant, who stated to the contrary and asserted that the appellant\n\nwas with him at his village Kolakkudi. In other words, this witness supported\n\nthe appellant’s plea of alibi.\n\n5. Though elaboration of the entire prosecution evidence is not\n\nnecessary for the purpose of the present appeal, but having regard to the\n\ncontentions urged, we may take note of the relevant part of depositions,\n\nparticularly in reference to certain inconsistencies/discrepancies in the\n\nassertions of the prosecution witnesses as also in reference to the\n\nappellant’s plea of alibi.\n\n5.1. PW-1 Basheera has been the key witness for the prosecution. In\n\nher testimony, she stated that her son Abdul Raheem had married the\n\nappellant; that a female child was born to the appellant after the marriage;\n\nand that Abdul Raheem was sending all the money earned by him to the\n\nappellant. She further stated that Abdul Raheem had called her to say that\n\nhis daughter should be admitted in a school in Perambalur and he would\nsend her money for that purpose; and subsequently, on 18.06.2007, PW-6\n\nJamal Mohammed, father of the appellant, dropped the appellant and the\n\nchild to the house of PW-1 with request to educate the child in Perambalur\n\nsince Abdul Raheem was allegedly not sending the appellant any money.\n\nShe stated that on the morning of 21.06.2007, the appellant gave her Rs.\n\n100 and asked her to buy idli; that when she came back to the house, the\n\nappellant was sitting silently next to the child; and that upon asking, the\n\nappellant told her that she had killed the child. During cross-examination,\n\nthis witness stated that she went to the police station with the appellant\n\nimmediately after the occurrence. The relevant parts of her statement read\n\nas under: -\n\n“……About 10 months ago, 18th day of 6th month, my daughter-in-\nlaw’s father Jamal Mohammed had brought his daughter, the\nmargin accused and our grand child to my house at Perambalur. My\ndaughter-in-law’s father was telling his daughter, the margin\naccused, that on the next day, 19th he would be leaving to his village\nand she has to take care of everything. The margin accused told\nher father that she would take care. On the next day 19 th, the\naccused’s father went back to his village. On the next day to that,\non 20th Wednesday we cooked and had our food and were available\nin the house of my daughter Mumtaz. ….. I am residing separately\nafter 4 or 5 houses from her house. (the witness repeats the same.)\nI told the margin accused to come to my house along with her\ndaughter and we would admit the grand daughter in school. The\naccused said OK for the same and on that day Wednesday, night,\nI, the accused and the grand daughter Farhana three of us went to\nthe house wherein I am staying as a tenant for our sleep. In the\nmorning of the next day, at about 6.00 A.M. I went to get the society\nmilk. … I bought the milk and made tea and gave to her. Thereafter\nI told her that I would get meat. For that the margin accused said\nthat no need of getting meat, and gave me Rs.100/- and asked me\nto get idli. It would be around 7.00 A.M. I came to Farmers’ market.\nIt took some time. By that time I got the change for Rs.100/- and got\nthe idli and came back to home. On the same day, i.e. 21st at 6.00\nA.M. my son Abdul Raheem had called my daughter Mumtaz from\nabroad. The said information was given to me by my daughter\nMumtaz on the way to home after getting the idli, as the house of\nmy daughter Mumtaz is situated on the way….. I bought the idli and\nwent to my house. The tea which was kept by me in a glass was\nthere as it is. That tea was kept by me for my grand daughter. It was\nthere as it is. By that time the accused Vahida was sitting near my\ngrand daughter who was lying there. I told the details given by\nMumtaz to me and asked her to wake up grand daughter and give\nher the tea. For that the accused was sitting quiet. When I was\ntelling the accused about the admission of my granddaughter into\nschool and she has to talk to my son Abdul Raheem over phone,\nthe accused asked me where is the police station. I asked the\naccused, “What I am telling you. What you are asking me.” For that\nthe margin accused said that she had killed her daughter. I told her,\n“none of the mother who gave birth to a child will kill the child. You\nare telling lie”. For that the margin accused said that really she had\nkilled her child. When I was telling the accused that she is telling lie\nonce again, my daughter Mumtaz and my middle daughter-in-law\nAsha Begum both of them came into my house. Again I told the\naccused “You are telling lie.” And asked her to wake up the child.\nBut again the accused said that she had killed the child, I shook the\nhead of my grand daughter. There was blood out of my grand\ndaughter’s nose. My grand daughter Farhana was dead. When I\nsaw that my grand daughter was dead and came out shouting, as\nsaid by me earlier, my daughter Mumtaz, my middle daughter-in-\nlaw Asha begum came there. The people also gathered. I had\ngiddiness. They took me to the neighbouring house and made me\nto sit there. Anwar Basha had made phone call. Police authorities\ncame to our house. They called me to the police station and asked\nme. I told them all that had transpired. The police authorities\nrecorded the same. I had affixed my left thumb impression in the\nsame. That was shown to me. When the witness was shown the\ncomplaint dated 21.6.2007 and asked about the same, as the\nwitness had accepted the same the above said complaint had been\nmarked as Ex.P1. ….. The accused told me that she had put the\nsaree outer end of a saree (mundanai) around her neck and\nmurdered her. When the police authorities examined me I deposed\nwhat had happened.\n\nCross Examination: On the date of the death of my grand\ndaughter, at about 8.30 A.M. the police authorities came to our\nhouse. After the police authorities came, seeing that the child was\ndead, the police authorities brought me and the margin accused,\nmy daughter-in-law to the police station. I had deposed the same\nparticulars that I had deposed in the chief examination, in the police\nstation also. If anyone call loudly in front of my house, it would be\nheard by the persons in the house of my daughter Mumtaz. My son\nShamsudeen and his wife Asha Begum both were staying in a\nhouse in some other street. When I bought idli and came back, Asha\nBegum and Shamsudeen were not available in the house of my\ndaughter Mumtaz……. If it is said that as we did not take any steps\nto admit our grand daughter in the school, on 20th morning the father\nof the accused had left our grand daughter Farhana in our house\nand left for Kollakudi village, it is incorrect. When I saw the child was\ndead and when I came out of the house and shouted at about 10 or\n15 feet distance, Mumtaz and Asha Begum were coming. The name\nof my house owner is Majid. I was residing in a portion of the portico\nwhich was covered with asbestos sheet. It has only one door. As\nthe place wherein I resided is a portico, there are no windows. When\nI got the idli and came back, the door of the house was closed tight.\n\nI had knocked it strongly and opened. …. It is incorrect to state that\nI had not deposed during the police investigation that on the next\nday at 6.00 A.M. I went to get the society milk and brought the milk.\nIt is incorrect to state that I had not deposed during the police\ninvestigation that after making the tea and giving it to my daughter-\nin-law the margin accused gave me Rs.100/- to get idli and that I\nwent to the farmer's market to get the idli and when I got the idli and\nwas coming back, through my daughter Mumtaz she said that Abdul\nRaheem spoke to my daughter Mumtaz over phone. It is incorrect\nto state that as deposed during my chief examination, I did not\nmention in the complaint statement as well as during the police\ninvestigation, that when I came back the tea which had been kept\nfor my grand daughter was as it is, and that when I asked the\naccused, why she did not wake up granddaughter and give her the\ntea, she was sitting quiet, and that when I asked again the accused\nsaid that she had killed the child. … My eldest son Jamal\nMohammed and my another son Shamsudeen, alone were sending\nmoney to be from abroad. It is incorrect to state that as Abdul\nRaheem did not take care of me, after his marriage, I am angry with\nhim. It is incorrect to state that in the event that my son Abdul\nRaheem and the accused did not take care of me, they had handed\nover my grand daughter Farhana to me. If it is said that on account\nof this anger, I and my daughter Mumtaz colluded and murdered my\ngrand daughter, it is false. If it is said that Shamudeen who came\nfrom abroad had given the money and by using his influence, had\nused me and made a false case to be filed against the accused, all\nof them are wrong. If it is said that after hearing the news of the\nchild's death, the accused who came to Perambalur at 5.00 P.M.\nfrom Kollakudi Village, was taken by all of us and handed over to\nthe police, all are incorrect.”\n\n5.2. The testimony of PW-2 Mumtaz, daughter of PW-1, assumes\n\nrelevance in view of her close connectivity with the occurrence, as asserted\n\nby PW-1. The relevant parts of her statement read as under: -\n\n“…..The name of the daughter of the margin accused is Farhana.\nThe child died on the 21st day of June, 2007. Two days earlier, the\naccused and her daughter stayed at Perambur as guests. My\nmother is residing separately in a house which is away slightly from\nmy house. By that time, along with my mother, the margin accused\nand her daughter were staying when they came to Perambalur. The\naccused and her daughter were residing in my mother’s house\nseparately. On the date of incident, between 7.30 to 8.00 A.M. my\nmother went to get idli. When my mother got idli and went home,\nmy mother shouted. People gathered there. We went to that place.\nI saw that the accused’s daughter was dead…..When I asked\nmargin accused, she said that she had killed the child. (The witness\nonce again said this). At about 7.00 A.M. on that day, my younger\nbrother Abdul Raheem had called me over phone and said that\nVahida i.e. the margin accused should not go anywhere and that\nthe accused’s daughter has to be admitted in the school. My\nyounger brother Abdul Raheem told me over phone that I have to\ntell the accused to admit the school in Perambalur and to stay along\nwith my mother. When my mother got idli and came back, I told the\ndetails as said by my younger brother, Abdul Raheem over phone.\nMy younger brother told me over phone to bring the margin accused\nand keep her in my house and before I could do the same, the\nincident had taken place. When I saw, Farhana was dead with the\nblood coming out of the nose and mouth. When the police\nauthorities examined me, I deposed the above details. That is all.\n\nCross Examination: After my mother got idli she shouted within\n5 minutes. By that time 20 or 30 persons gathered there.\n\nImmediately, between 9.30 and 9.45 A.M. the police authorities\ncame there. When I went and saw and asked the accused, the\naccused was silent and this had been deposed by me in the chief\nexamination and the same had not been deposed during the\ninvestigation by the police authorities. I did not depose during the\ninvestigation by the police authorities about the phone call from\nAbdul Raheem at 7.00 A.M. on that day, and the details of\nconversation and also about my informing the same to my mother,\nas I had deposed in my chief examination…. After the marriage the\naccused and her husband did not have smooth relationship with my\nmother. In these circumstances, if it is said that the accused had left\nher daughter for educating her in my mother’s house and on 20 th\nshe went to Kolakkudi Village they are all false. The reason for the\ndeath of the child who had been left as such is me and my mother,\nthey are all false.”\n\n5.3. PW-3 Asha Begum, the other daughter-in-law of PW-1, also\n\nallegedly reached the scene of occurrence at the relevant point of time.\n\nShe allegedly asked the appellant as to why she killed the child but the\n\nappellant did not answer. During her cross-examination, this witness\nmentioned that she was not speaking to the appellant for four years prior\n\nto the occurrence. The relevant parts of her statement read as under: -\n\n“….The margin accused had a daughter by name Farhana. She\ndied on 21.6.2007. On the date of incident, the accused, her\ndaughter were staying in the house, wherein Basheera was staying,\nalong with P.W.1 Basheera. After my mother-in-law got the idli,\nwhen she shouted, I and my sister-in-law Mumtaz went to the house\nof my mother-in-law. My mother-in-law was residing in a house 5\nhouses away from my house. When I went there and saw, the child\nof the accused was instable. One nurse came and saw the child and\nconfirmed that the child was dead. My sister-in-law Mumtaz had\nsaid accused “Why did you do like this. If you do not like the child,\nyou would have left her with me” and she was beating on her head.\nI also asked the accused “You are an educated woman. Isn’t it?\nWhy did you kill the child” and shouted at her. The accused did not\nspeak anything. When the police authorities examined me, I\ndeposed the above said particulars. If it is asked who is the cause\nfor the death of Farhana, her mother is the sole reason. That is all.\n\nCross-examination: I had deposed the facts which had been said\nby me in the chief examination, during the police investigation also.\nOn the date of incident, my husband came from abroad for his\nholidays. I and the margin accused are not speaking with each other\nfor the past four years. Two days before the death of Farhana, the\naccused came with her child to our house. After she came, she\nasked my husband that the husband of the margin accused Abdul\nRaheem is not sending money to her and that he is also not calling\nher over phone, and that she wanted to educate her child Farhana.\nMy husband asked the margin accused keeping silent for all these\nyears, now you have come here. Thereafter, the accused took the\nchild and went to the house of my mother-in-law. I did not say the\ndetails of my sister-in-law Mumtaz, asking the accused after seeing\nthe dead body of the child, during the police investigation. It is\nincorrect to state that the accused is not the cause for the death of\nFarhana and that as there is no contact between me and the\naccused for the past four years, I am adducing false evidence\nagainst the accused. As the accused did not come to us, there is no\ncontact between us.”\n\n5.4. PW-4 Sharfunisha, the landlord of PW-1, deposed that when she\n\ncame back to her house, she saw the child with the appellant. The witness\n\nalso claimed that she heard the appellant admit that she had killed the child.\n\nThe relevant parts of her statement could also be reproduced as under: -\n“… P.W.1 Basheera is residing in a portion of our house. At the time\nof the incident, the margin accused came as a guest to Basheera’s\nhouse. Only then I came to know her. Before that, I do not know the\nmargin accused. The margin accused came with her child to the\nhouse of Basheera and stayed there. On 21.6.2007, the child of the\naccused was dead. I came to send my child to school by bus went\nnear to Perambalur Farmers market and came back to my house,\nafter sending my child. People were talking there that the accused\nhad killed her child. When I saw that child, the margin accused was\nthere. She said the crowd that she had killed her child by straggling\nwith her saree outer end of a saree (mundanai) around her neck. I\nwas there at that time. When the police authorities examined me I\ndeposed the above particulars.\n\nCross Examination: Basheera is residing in our house as a\ntenant with the monthly rent of Rs.350/- for the past two years. It is\nincorrect to state that I did not depose during the police investigation\nthat I went to send my child to school and after sending my child,\nwhen I came back, I saw the crowd in my house. I did not tell the\npolice authorities that the accused had said the crowd that she\nstraggled the child with her saree outer end of a saree (mundanai).\nIt is incorrect to state that I do not know the accused and that I had\nnot seen the accused on the date of the death of her child. It is\nincorrect to state that as Basheera is our tenant, I am adducing false\nevidence.”\n\n5.5. PW-5 Thiru-Jothi, neighbour of PW-1, testified to have seen the\n\nappellant for ten minutes, when the appellant was sitting near the body of\n\nthe deceased child. Her deposition could also be usefully reproduced as\n\nunder: -\n\n“My name is Jothi. My father’s name is Veerasamy. I am residing at\nPerambalur. Witness Basheera is residing in the house next to our\nhouse. About 4 or 5 months ago, one day on the date of death of\nthe child, I had seen the accused for 10 minutes. The margin\naccused’s child had passed away on that day. Only on the date of\nthe death of the accused’s child, I had seen the margin accused\nwhen she was sitting near the dead body of the child in the house\nwherein witness Basheera was staying. By that time, it would be\naround 8 or 8.15 A.M. P.W.1 Basheera was crying and said the\nmother who gave birth to the child itself had murdered the child. I\ntold her to go to the police station and not to do anything else. I told\nthis at the time of police investigation.\n\nCross-examination: It is incorrect to state that I had not deposed\nthe details as mentioned in the chief examination, during the police\ninvestigation. It is incorrect to state that I am adducing false\nevidence.”\n5.6. As noticed, the prosecution examined two medical officers as\n\nregards post-mortem examination of the dead body of the victim child who\n\ntestified to the injuries noticed on the dead body and as regards the cause\n\nof death. PW-8 Dr. Saravanan testified that there was a wound measuring\n\n20 cm in length and 2 cm in breadth around the neck; and the thyroid\n\ncartilage bone was fractured, which was consistent with strangulation. He\n\nalso opined that if outer end of a saree was twisted, put around the neck\n\nand strangled, there was a chance of such wound to the child. During\n\ncross-examination, he deposed that the wound would be more than 2 cm\n\nif a saree was tied around the neck. However, in re-examination, he\n\nclarified that the wound could be less than 2 cm if the saree was completely\n\ntwisted in small measurement. PW-13 Dr. Karthikeyan A. has been the\n\ndoctor who gave the report in respect of the thyroid cartilage bone. As per\n\nhis examination, the fracture of the thyroid bone was ante-mortem and\n\nthere was a chance that it was caused due to strangling. However, during\n\ncross-examination, he stated that if the neck is strangled using a saree,\n\nthere is a less likelihood of marks. The fact that the victim child died due to\n\nasphyxia because of strangulation is as such not a matter of dispute and\n\nhence, we need not elaborate on these testimonies.\n\n5.7. As regards the police personnel related with this matter, PW-10\n\nSubbulakshmi, Sub-Inspector of Perambalur, recorded the statement of\n\nPW-1 and scribed the FIR. She deposed that at around 9:00 am, PW-1\ncame to the police station to file a complaint. During cross-examination,\n\nshe clarified that PW-1 had not deposed in her original complaint that she\n\nhad come out of her house and shouted after realising that the child was\n\ndead and had not brought the appellant to the police station immediately\n\nafter the occurrence. She also denied the suggestions in the cross-\n\nexamination that she visited the place of occurrence at 8:00 a.m. and\n\nbrought the witnesses as also the appellant with her to the police station.\n\nThe relevant extracts from the testimony of PW-10 are as under: -\n\n“…On 21.6.2007 at 9:00 A.M. when I was on duty, Basheera, wife\nof Mohammed Kasim, aged 65 years, residing at No. 230/48D,\nCross Street, Renga Nagar, Perambalur, came to the station and\nhad deposed the complaint and I recorded the same in writing. After\ndeposing the complaint, I had read out the statement to Basheera.\nAs she said that it was as deposed by her, and as she said that she\ndid not know to sign, I had obtained her left thumb impression in the\ncomplaint…\n\nCross Examination:…In the complaint that had been deposed to me\nit had not been indicated that after the incident was over, the margin\naccused was brought by the complainant Basheera to the\nPerambalur Police Station. When Basheera deposed, Anwar Basha\nwas with her.… The witness Basheera did not depose in the\ncomplaint that after seeing that the child was dead, Basheera came\nout of the house, and shouted and thereafter the witnesses Mumtaz\nand Asha Begum came there. Basheera did not depose in the\ncomplaint that she went to get the society milk at 6:00 A.M. She did\nnot depose in the complaint that when she bought the milk and\ncame on the way she met her daughter Mumtaz at her house and\ntalked to her. The witness Basheera did not depose in the complaint\nthat after coming to house, the accused had given Rupees one\nhundred for getting idli and that she had taken the same and went\nto the farmer's market to get idli. The witness Basheera did not\ndepose in the complaint that after she came to the house, the house\ndoor was locked and she had knocked the door and opened the\nsame. If it is said that after coming to know of the incident, I went to\nthe place of incident at 8.00 A.M. itself and I had brought the\nwitnesses, Basheera, Mumtaz and Asha Begum to the police\nstation, they are all incorrect. If it is said that at that time, I had taken\nthe margin accused along with the above said witnesses, it is also\nincorrect…”\n5.8. PW-12 Thiru G. Ayyanar was the first IO in the case. He stated to\n\nhave received the FIR at 10:15 a.m. on 21.06.2007 and commenced the\n\ninvestigation. For the purpose, he went to the place of incident and\n\nexamined a few witnesses; prepared the mahazar; and seized the articles\n\nlike mat and pillow. He also stated to have arrested the appellant at\n\nPerambalur New Bus Stand and having recorded her confessional\n\nstatement in the presence of witnesses. He further stated to have seized\n\nthe saree said to have been used in the offence. The relevant parts of his\n\ntestimony read as under:\n\n“…On the same day at about 17.00 hours, I had arrested the\naccused Vahida in the Perambalur New Bus Stand. I had examined\nthe margin accused and recorded her confession statement before\nthe witnesses Devaraj and Parameswaran. The margin accused\nsaid in her confession statement that she had killed the child by\nstrangling her neck with the saree which she was wearing. The\nadmitted portion of the confession statement had already been\nmarked as Ex. P9. As per the confession statement, the saree which\nshe was wearing was seized by me with the assistance of the lady\npolice under the mahazar. The mahazar for the same was the one\nshown to me. That had already been marked as Ex. P8. The saree\nwhich was seized by me is the one shown to me. That had already\nbeen marked as M.O.3. ….\n\nCross-Examination: In Ex.P8 Mahazar, it had been indicated that\nthrough the Sub-Inspector, Subbulakshmi the accused was given\nthe alternate saree. The accused who was arrested at 5.00 P.M. on\nthat day, was kept by me till 6.45 P.M. in the Perambalur New Bus\nStand only. In the last portion of the confession statement, it had\nnot been mentioned that the sub-inspector Subbulakshmi was sent\nto get the alternate saree. It had been indicated that the lady police\nhad been sent and the alternate saree was brought… The evening\nnewspapers which are published in Perambalur would come at 5.00\nP.M. If it is said that in the Maalai Malar newspaper dated\n21.6.2007, which had been circulated at 5.00 P.M. on that day, it\nwas indicated that the accused of this case had been arrested, I do\nnot know of the same. I did not give such a news. If it is said that in\nthe same newspaper, the news stating that the police authorities\nare conducting the investigation to witness Basheera, I do not know\nof the same. The witnesses Basheera and Mumtaz had deposed\nthat after the incident was over, the margin accused ran from the\nhouse. If it is said that in the circulation of Dinakaran and Dinamalar\nnewspapers, it had been indicated that after the incident was\nconcluded, the mother of the child was lying down near the child, I\ndo not know of the same. It is incorrect to state that after the death\nof the child the margin accused had ran away from the house and\nthat we had published the news falsely stating that the margin\naccused was lying near the deceased child. It is incorrect to state\nthat the witnesses Basheera, Mumtaz and Ashabegum had\ndeposed during my investigation that they had seen that the child\nwas dead. It is incorrect to state that on 20.6.2007 itself, the margin\naccused had left her female child to the witness Basheera, and she\nwent to Kolakkudi Village on the same day. It is incorrect to state\nthat on 21.6.07, the accused who was in Kolakkudi village had the\ninformation that her child was dead and that she came to\nPerambalur by bus and when she got down, I had arrested her….”\n\n5.9. PW-14 D. Sivasubramanian had been the other police officer who\n\ncarried out the later part of investigation, recorded the statements of other\n\nwitnesses and then filed the charge-sheet. For the present purpose, we\n\nneed not elaborate on the testimony of this witness or the other witnesses\n\nwho had been a part of the investigation including the photographer and\n\nthe attesting witnesses.\n\n5.10. However, the testimony of PW-6 Jamal Mohammed, father of the\n\nappellant, assumes relevance in the present case, particularly when he did\n\nnot support the prosecution version and deposed in support of the plea of\n\nalibi as taken by the appellant by asserting that he had left the child with\n\nPW-1 on 20.06.2007; had taken the appellant with her to Kolakkudi village,\n\nand the next day, he came to Perambalur with the appellant after getting\n\ninformation about demise of the child, when the appellant was arrested at\n\nthe bus stand. This witness was treated as a hostile witness and permission\n\nwas granted to the prosecution to cross-examine him. He was, of course,\nnot cross-examined by the defence. The relevant parts of the statement of\n\nthis witness could be usefully reproduced as under: -\n\n“….On 16.6.2007, I had called Shamsudeen who came from foreign\ncountry over phone. He asked me to come on Monday. On 18 th I\ntook my daughter, the margin accused and my granddaughter\nFarhana and went to the house of Shamsudeen. I talked to\nShamsudeen that if leave the child in Perambalur for education and\nif she is in their protection, Abdul Raheem would be sending the\nmoney. Shamsudeen asked me to tell this to his mother. I went\nthere and told that. She asked me to tell the same to her daughter\nMumtaz. In this manner, I was telling for 3 days. They did not\nrespond properly. When I started to go to the village, my son-in-\nlaw’s mother asked me to leave her grand daughter Farhana alone\nand take my daughter along with me. On 20th Wednesday at 6.00\nP.M. I took my daughter alone and went to Kolakkudi Village. The\nnext day morning we got the information over phone that the child\nFarhana was dead. We came to Perambalur. They had arrested my\ndaughter. My son-in-law Abdul Raheem is not sending the sufficient\nmoney. In these circumstances, this witness had been treated as\nhostile witness by the prosecution and sought permission for the\ncross examination. The permission was granted for cross\nexamination.\n\nCross-examination on the side of the prosecution: As Abdul\nRaheem did not send the money properly and manage the family,\nwe dropped his child in Perambalur. No one said us to go to\nPerambalur. We ourselves went to the eldest son of the family\nShamsudeen. As no one had responded at Perambalur we did not\ntake steps to take the child again to Kolakkudi. As she i.e. my son-\nin-law’s mother asked to leave the child and go, we had left the child\nand went from there. I was working in foreign country earlier. At\npresent I am running the poultry shops business. If it is said that I\nhad deposed during police investigation, that my daughter margin\naccused used to tell me that she is going to mother-in-law’s house\nand hospital, and was going in a wrong way, it is not correct. The\npolice authorities did not examine me. If it is said that the margin\naccused was not staying in my house properly and that the conduct\nof the accused is not good and that if the same is revealed out it will\nspoil the prestige of my family, and hence I did not reveal it, they\nare all incorrect. If it is said that during the police investigation, I had\ndeposed that my son-in-law who came to know all these details, had\ncalled over phone and told me to drop the margin accused and his\nchild in the house of witness Basheera, they are all incorrect. It is\nincorrect to state that during the police investigation I had deposed\nthat thereafter I had taken the margin accused and her child and\ndropped them in the house of witness Basheera. If it is said that\nduring the police investigation, I had deposed that when I dropped\nthem and started to leave Permabalur, the accused told me that she\ncould not stay in Perambalur and that she will be coming soon to\nme and that I had advised her to do as said by the accused’s\nhusband and I left from there, they are all incorrect. If it is said that,\nduring the police investigation I had deposed that on the next day, I\ncame to know over phone that my daughter, the margin accused\nhad killed my grand daughter Farhana and that thereafter I came to\nPerambalur and saw my granddaughter who was dead and that the\naccused had ran away, they are all incorrect. If it is said that, during\nthe police investigation I had deposed that as the accused could not\nact as per whims and fancies at Perambalur, the accused had killed\nher child, it is incorrect. It is incorrect to state that as the accused is\nmy daughter, I am adducing false evidence.”\n\n5.11. In her examination under\nSection 313\nof the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure, 19735, the appellant denied all the allegations made against\n\nher as false.\n\n6. With the aforesaid status of record, the Trial Court heard the parties\n\nand proceeded to decide the matter by way of its judgment and order dated\n\n15.10.2009.\n\n6.1. The Trial Court held that although PW-1 to PW-3 were related\n\nwitnesses but, PW-4 and PW-5 were independent witnesses who had seen\n\nthe child and the accused-appellant together; and there was no necessity\n\nfor them to depose against the appellant. The Trial Court also held that the\n\ntestimony of PW-1 could not be discarded merely because of minor\n\ncontradictions, given that she might not have been able to remember\n\ncertain details on account of her age and other factors. The Trial Court also\n\nreferred to the statement of PW-6, the hostile witness, who admitted the\n\nfact that the appellant was arrested at the bus stand; and held that the\n\nappellant had not fulfilled the burden of proving alibi, since there were two\n\n5 ‘\nCrPC\n’ for short.\nindependent witnesses who saw her at the scene of occurrence. Further,\n\nthe Trial Court held that the oral testimony was consistent with the cause\n\nof death determined by the medical findings.\n\n6.2. After finding that the appellant was the last person to be seen with\n\nthe victim child, as established by the testimony of PW-1 to PW-5, the Trial\n\nCourt highlighted the importance of cogent evidence establishing the chain\n\nof circumstances; and held that the prosecution had discharged its burden\n\nof proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had committed the\n\noffence of murder of the victim child. The Trial Court summed up its\n\nconclusion as follows: -\n\n“38. In the case before us also, the accused who had been\nleading an independent luxurious life with the money more than\nsufficient, not willing to live with P.W.1 for the sake of the education\nof her child, and without considering that the child was born to her\nwith an intention to cause death to the child, and also knowing full\nwell that the act being committed by her would cause death to the\nchild on 21.6.2007 at 8.00 A.M. in the house of P.W.1, when P.W.1\nwas not available at house, she had twisted outer end of her saree\nand strangled around the neck of her daughter 6 years old Farhana,\nwho was sleeping and the thyroid cartilage bone was fractured and\nthus caused the death. In order to prove the charge, the prosecution\nhad placed the oral evidences and documentary evidences in a\ncogent manner like a chain.”\n6.3. Accordingly, the Trial Court held that the appellant was guilty of the\n\noffence under\nSection 302\nIPC and awarded the sentence as noticed\n\nhereinbefore.\n\n7. The appellant challenged the decision of the Trial Court before the\n\nMadras High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 2010, which was dismissed\n\nby the impugned judgment and order dated 09.03.2010.\n7.1. While accepting the submissions that there had been certain\n\ninconsistencies in the statements made by PW-1, the High Court held that\n\nthe only point for consideration was as to whether the child was left in the\n\ncustody of the appellant at the time of occurrence; and after detailed\n\nexamination of the evidence on record, affirmed the findings of the Trial\n\nCourt that the appellant was the last person seen with the deceased child.\n\nHence, the High Court observed that the onus was on the appellant to\n\nexplain as to how the death was caused. Addressing the plea of alibi, the\n\nHigh Court also held that such a plea was not tenable because PW-4 and\n\nPW-5 were independent witnesses, both of whom testified that the\n\nappellant was available at the place of occurrence on 21.06.2007; that she\n\nwas arrested on the very same day she was seen with the deceased child;\n\nand that she was the only person available with the child at the time of\n\noccurrence. The High Court, inter alia, observed and held as under: -\n\n“13. Now learned counsel brought to the notice of this Court that\naccording to P.W.1, when she was returning from the house, she\nfound that the accused was strangulating the child, which was not\navailable in 161 statement. It is true, when she gave Ex.P1 report,\nshe has stated that she actually found the accused/appellant\nstrangulating the child, which was not available in 161 statement.\nEven then, the only point that arises for consideration at this\njuncture is that when the child was left in the custody of the\nmother/appellant by P.W.1 at the time of occurrence, when P.W.1\ncame back, she found only the dead body of the child. At the time\nof occurrence, the appellant alone was available along with the\nchild. Hence, it is for the accused to explain as to how the death\nwas occurred. In the instant case, the prosecution proved that the\nchild died of asphyxia due to strangulation. If to be so, it is for the\nmother/appellant to explain as to how the death was caused.”\n“14. The defence plea putforth before the Trial Court and equally\nhere also is that the accused was absent during the relevant time\nand she left the place leaving the child along with P.W.1. The Court\nis unable to agree with the same for more reasons than one. It is a\nfalse plea. Firstly, P.Ws.4 and 5 are independent witnesses, who\nare neighbors. According to P.Ws.4 and 5, the accused was very\nmuch available at the place of occurrence, which took place on 21st\nJune, 2007 morning. Secondly, according to the police, she was\narrested on the very day and she was produced before the Court.\nWhen the occurrence had taken place at 8 a.m., the case came to\nbe registered at 9 a.m. and the First Information Report reached the\nCourt on the same day. Thirdly, the accused was the only person\navailable with her child at the place and time of occurrence and it is\nfor the accused to explain as to how the occurrence had taken\nplace. But, she did not explain. Under such circumstances, it is quite\nclear that the prosecution has proved its case that except the\naccused, no one could have committed the murder of the child.”\n\n7.2. In view of the above and taking all the factors into consideration,\n\nthe High Court upheld the judgment of the Trial Court and dismissed the\n\nappeal.\n\n8. Assailing the judgment and order aforesaid, learned counsel for the\n\nappellant has put forward a variety of submissions, particularly assailing\n\nthe findings in question with reference to several discrepancies appearing\n\nin the prosecution case; the factum of strained relations between the\n\nhusband of the appellant and PW-1 to PW-3 for which, they might be\n\ninterested in deposing against the appellant; the plea of alibi of the\n\nappellant, particularly with reference to the testimony of PW-6 Jamal\n\nMohammed; and no likelihood of motive for the appellant to kill her own\n\nchild.\n\n8.1. Learned counsel has made elaborate reference to the contents of\n\nthe complaint and several contradictions appearing in the version occurring\n\nin the complaint from that occurring in the statement of PW-1 Basheera,\n\nparticularly when in the complaint she alleged to have left her house for\nbuying idli without taking money but, in the deposition, she has stated that\n\nthe appellant gave her Rs. 100 and asked her to get idli; when in the\n\ncomplaint, PW-1 asserted that the appellant ran away from the scene of\n\noccurrence, but in her deposition, she stated that the appellant was taken\n\nto the police station. Various other contradictions as to what PW-1 saw and\n\ndid after reaching back the house have also been referred to.\n\n8.2. Learned counsel has also referred to the omission in the statements\n\nof witnesses that the appellant twisted her saree and strangulated the child\n\nby pressing the same around the neck and has submitted that their\n\nversions do not correlate with the post-mortem examination.\n\n8.3. Learned counsel has submitted that there was no conclusive proof\n\nas regards the theory of arrest of the appellant at the bus stand and has\n\nrelied upon the testimony of PW-6 Jamal Mohammed that the appellant\n\nwas arrested at the bus stand only when she came back to Perambalur\n\nwith him after receiving information about the demise of the child. Further,\n\nwith respect to the statement of PW-6, learned counsel has argued that\n\nplea of alibi taken by the appellant is clearly established on record and\n\nlooking to the background facts, particularly the strained relations of the\n\nappellant with her mother-in-law and other relatives of her husband, the\n\nplea of alibi and assertion of PW-6 that he and the appellant left the child\n\nin the company of PW-1 and her relatives cannot be ignored.\n\n8.4. Learned counsel has also argued that the motive as suggested by\n\nthe prosecution that the appellant wanted to live lavishly and for that\npurpose killed the child remains baseless as the appellant was living alone\n\nin her matrimonial house immediately after the marriage where her\n\nhusband used to stay during his short visits to India. In this regard, the\n\nlearned counsel has also submitted that husband of the appellant was\n\nnever examined by the prosecution as regards her conduct and hence,\n\nthere is no basis to allege motive. It has also been submitted that in view\n\nof the admitted fact that there were strained relations between husband of\n\nthe appellant and PW-1, possibility of the appellant being falsely implicated\n\nso that PW-1 could derive monetary benefit from her son, husband of the\n\nappellant, cannot be ruled out.\n\n8.5. Learned counsel has argued in the alternative that the case does\n\nnot fall under\nSection 302\nIPC, particularly in view of the fact that admittedly\n\nthere had been strained relations between the parties and even as per the\n\nversion of PW-1, on the morning of the date of incident itself, she and the\n\nappellant had entered into a quarrel as the appellant wanted to go to the\n\nplace of her father, Kolakkudi. In the given circumstances, according to the\n\nlearned counsel, even if the accusations against the appellant are taken\n\ninto consideration, it could not be a case beyond culpable homicide not\n\namounting to murder.\n\n8.6. Learned counsel has relied upon various decisions of this Court\n\nincluding that in the case of\nShyamal Ghosh v. State of West Bengal\n:\n\n(2012) 7 SCC 646 as regards the witness discrepancies;\nSharad\n\nBirdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra\n: (1984) 4 SCC 116 as\nregards circumstantial evidence and the factors when accused would be\n\nentitled to benefit of doubt as also with regard to the testimony of\n\ninterested/related witnesses; and\nRamnaresh v. State of Chhattisgarh\n:\n\n(2012) 4 SCC 257 as regards entitlement of the accused to maintain\n\nsilence in examination under\nSection 313\nCrPC; and obligation on the part\n\nof the Trial Court to put the material evidence to the accused to extend an\n\nopportunity of explanation.\n\n9. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State has submitted\n\nthat the prosecution has discharged its burden of proving beyond\n\nreasonable doubt that the appellant committed the offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 302\nIPC.\n\n9.1. Learned counsel has argued that minor discrepancies in the\n\nstatements of witnesses have no effect on the prosecution case, and that\n\npresence of the appellant alone with the child has been corroborated by\n\nthe testimony of independent witnesses.\nIn this regard, reliance has been\n\nplaced on various decisions including those in\nBharwada Bhoginbhai\n\nHirjibhai v. State of Gujarat\n: (1983) 3 SCC 217;\nKrishna Mochi v. State\n\nof Bihar\n: (2002) 6 SCC 81 and Leela Ram v. State of Haryana: (1999) 9\n\nSCC 525 to submit that minor contradictions are normal and are bound to\n\nappear in the statements of witnesses.\n\n9.2. It has further been submitted by the learned counsel that the\n\nappellant was the last person to be seen with the child before she died;\n\ntherefore, she had special knowledge about the death of the child and was\nrequired to provide an explanation in terms of Section 106 of the Evidence\n\nAct, 18726 about the circumstances under which the death took place.\nIn\n\nthis regard, learned counsel for the respondent-State has relied upon\n\nvarious decisions including those in\nSatpal v. State of Haryana\n: (2018) 6\n\nSCC 610; and\nState of Rajasthan v. Kashi Ram\n: (2006) 12 SCC 254 to\n\nsubmit that if the accused does not offer an explanation under\nSection 106\n\nand there is corroborative evidence establishing a chain of circumstances\n\nleading to the conclusion of guilt, the accused could be convicted on that\n\nbasis.\n\n9.3. It has also been submitted that the testimonies of PW-1 to PW-5\n\nclearly establish the fact that the appellant was present at the place of\n\noccurrence and hence, her alibi has not been proved. The appellant was\n\nrequired to furnish some explanation under\nSection 313\nCrPC but she did\n\nnot do so, leaving no room for doubt that she was responsible for the death\n\nof the child.\n\n9.4. Coming to the question of reasonable doubt, learned counsel has\n\ncontended that this benefit cannot be stretched and the prosecution cannot\n\nprove its case without there being an iota of doubt. To substantiate this\n\nargument, the learned counsel has relied upon several decisions including\n\nthose in\nState of Haryana v. Bhagirath\n: (1999) 5 SCC 96;\nGangadhar\n\nBehera v. State of Orissa\n: (2002) 8\nSCC 381 and Krishna Mochi\n(supra)\n\nwherein it was held that it is impossible to prove all the elements in a\n\n6 ‘\nEvidence Act\n’ for short.\ncriminal trial with scientific precision and that reasonable doubt must not be\n\na ‘trivial’ or ‘merely possible’ doubt.\n\n9.5. The learned counsel for the respondent-State has also countered\n\nthe argument that PW-1 to PW-3 were biased witnesses by submitting that\n\nin the instant case, there was no reason to falsely implicate the appellant\n\nor protect the real culprit.\nIn this regard, reliance has been placed on\n\nGangabhavani v. Rayapati Venkat Reddy\n: (\n2013) 15 SCC 298 and State\n\nof Rajasthan v. Kalki\n: (1981) 2 SCC 752 to submit that a witness can only\n\nbe called “interested” when they derive some benefit out of the litigation.\n\nNatural witnesses are not interested witnesses, and if a related witness\n\nwas present at the scene of occurrence, his deposition cannot be\n\ndiscarded.\n\n9.6. It has also been submitted on behalf of the respondent-State that\n\nlast seen theory would not apply to PW-1 as she was never found present\n\nalone with the deceased child. It has further been contended that PW-1\n\nwould not have benefitted in any way from the death of the child.\n\n9.7. Thus, learned counsel for the respondent-State would submit that\n\nwhen duly established chain of circumstances leads to no other plausible\n\nhypothesis than the guilt of the appellant, no case for interference in the\n\nconcurrent findings of the Trial Court and the High Court is made out.\n\n10. We have given anxious consideration to the rival submissions and\n\nhave examined the record with reference to the law applicable.\n11. As noticed, the Trial Court and the High Court have concurrently\n\nrecorded the findings in this case that the prosecution has been able to\n\nsuccessfully establish the chain of circumstances leading to the only\n\nconclusion that the appellant is guilty of the offence of murder of her\n\ndaughter. The concurrent findings leading to the appellant’s conviction\n\nhave been challenged in this appeal as if inviting re-appreciation of entire\n\nevidence. Though the parameters of examining the matters in an appeal\n\nby special leave under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India have been\n\nlaid down by\nthis Court in several decisions but, having regard to the\n\nsubmissions made in this case, we may usefully reiterate the observations\n\nin the case of\nPappu v. The State of Uttar Pradesh\n: (2022) 10 SCC 321\n\nwherein, after referring to\nArticles 134\nand\nof the Constitution of India\n\nand Section 2 of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate\n\nJurisdiction) Act, 1970 as also with a detailed reference to the relevant\n\ndecisions, this Court has summed up the subtle distinction in the scope of\n\na regular appeal and an appeal by special leave as follows: -\n\n“71.…. In such an appeal by special leave, where the trial court and\nthe High Court have concurrently returned the findings of fact after\nappreciation of evidence, each and every finding of fact cannot be\ncontested nor such an appeal could be dealt with as if another forum\nfor reappreciation of evidence. Of course, if the assessment by the\ntrial court and the High Court could be said to be vitiated by any\nerror of law or procedure or misreading of evidence or in disregard\nto the norms of judicial process leading to serious prejudice or\ninjustice, this Court may, and in appropriate cases would, interfere\nin order to prevent grave or serious miscarriage of justice but, such\na course is adopted only in rare and exceptional cases of manifest\nillegality. Tersely put, it is not a matter of regular appeal. This Court\nwould not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact based on\npure appreciation of evidence nor it is the scope of these appeals\nthat this Court would enter into reappreciation of evidence so as to\ntake a view different than that taken by the trial court and approved\nby the High Court.”\n\n11.1. This proposition has been recapitulated in the case of\nMekala\n\nSivaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n: (2022) 8 SCC 253, in the following\n\nwords: -\n\n“15. It is well settled by judicial pronouncement that\nArticle 136\nis\nworded in wide terms and powers conferred under the said Article\nare not hedged by any technical hurdles. This overriding and\nexceptional power is, however, to be exercised sparingly and only\nin furtherance of cause of justice. Thus, when the judgment under\nappeal has resulted in grave miscarriage of justice by some\nmisapprehension or misreading of evidence or by ignoring material\nevidence then this Court is not only empowered but is well expected\nto interfere to promote the cause of justice.\n\n16. It is not the practice of this Court to re-appreciate the evidence\nfor the purpose of examining whether the finding of fact concurrently\narrived at by the trial court and the High Court are correct or not. It\nis only in rare and exceptional cases where there is some manifest\nillegality or grave and serious miscarriage of justice on account of\nmisreading or ignoring material evidence, that this Court would\ninterfere with such finding of fact.”\n\n12. Learned counsel for the appellant has endeavoured to argue that\n\nthere are several shortcomings and lacunae in the prosecution case,\n\nparticularly in view of several inconsistencies and contradictions in the\n\nversions of the witnesses; and that the relied upon factors are not providing\n\nsuch links in the circumstances which may lead to the finding on the guilt\n\nof the appellant. While dealing with such submissions, we may usefully take\n\nnote of the basic principles applicable to this case, as noticeable from the\n\nrelevant cited decisions.\n\n12.1. The principles explained and enunciated in the case of\nSharad\n\nBirdhichand Sarda\n(supra) remain a guiding light for the Courts in regard\n\nto the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence.\n\nTherein, this Court\nreferred to the celebrated decision in the case of\nHanumant v. State of\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n: AIR 1952 SC 343 and deduced five golden principles\n\nof proving a case based on circumstantial evidence in the following terms:-\n\n“152. It may be useful to extract what Mahajan, J. has\nlaid down\nin\nHanumant case:\n\n“It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a\ncircumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion\nof guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established,\nand all the facts so established should be consistent only with the\nhypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances\nshould be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be\nsuch as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be\nproved. In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far\ncomplete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such\nas to show that within all human probability the act must have been\ndone by the accused.”\n\n153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the\nfollowing conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an\naccused can be said to be fully established:\n\n(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be\ndrawn should be fully established.\n\nIt may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances\nconcerned “must or should” and not “may be” established. There is\nnot only a grammatical but a legal distinction between “may be\nproved” and “must be or should be proved” as was held by this Court\nin\nShivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra7\nwhere the\nobservations were made:\n\n“Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not\nmerely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental\ndistance between ‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is long and divides vague\nconjectures from sure conclusions.”\n(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the\nhypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not\nbe explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is\nguilty,\n(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and\ntendency,\n(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one\nto be proved, and\n(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave\nany reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the\ninnocence of the accused and must show that in all human\nprobability the act must have been done by the accused.\n(1973) 2 SCC 793.\n154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute\nthe panchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial\nevidence.\n\n155. It may be interesting to note that as regards the mode of\nproof in a criminal case depending on circumstantial evidence, in\nthe absence of a corpus delicti, the statement of law as to proof of\nthe same was\nlaid down by\nGresson, J. (and concurred by 3 more\nJudges) in King v. Horry [1952 NZLR 111] thus:\n\n“Before he can be convicted, the fact of death should be proved by\nsuch circumstances as render the commission of the crime morally\ncertain and leave no ground for reasonable doubt: the\ncircumstantial evidence should be so cogent and compelling as to\nconvince a jury that upon no rational hypothesis other than murder\ncan the facts be accounted for.”\n\n156. Lord Goddard slightly modified the expression “morally\ncertain” by “such circumstances as render the commission of the\ncrime certain”.\n\n157. This indicates the cardinal principle of criminal\njurisprudence that a case can be said to be proved only when there\nis certain and explicit evidence and no person can be convicted on\npure moral conviction...””\n12.2. As regards inconsistencies and/or discrepancies in the version of\n\nthe witnesses, in the case of\nShyamal Ghosh\n(supra) this Court has\n\nexplained the distinction between serious contradictions and omissions\n\nwhich materially affect the prosecution case and marginal variations in the\n\nstatement of witnesses in the following terms: -\n\n“68. From the above discussion, it precipitates that the\ndiscrepancies or the omissions have to be material ones and then\nalone, they may amount to contradiction of some serious\nconsequence. Every omission cannot take the place of a\ncontradiction in law and therefore, be the foundation for\ndoubting the case of the prosecution. Minor contradictions,\ninconsistencies or embellishments of trivial nature which do\nnot affect the core of the prosecution case should not be taken\nto be a ground to reject the prosecution evidence in its entirety.\nIt is only when such omissions amount to a contradiction creating a\nserious doubt about the truthfulness or creditworthiness of the\nwitness and other witnesses also make material improvements or\ncontradictions before the court in order to render the evidence\nunacceptable, that the courts may not be in a position to safely rely\nupon such evidence. Serious contradictions and omissions which\nmaterially affect the case of the prosecution have to be understood\nin clear contradistinction to mere marginal variations in the\nstatement of the witnesses. The prior may have effect in law upon\nthe evidentiary value of the prosecution case; however, the latter\nwould not adversely affect the case of the prosecution.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n12.3.\nIn the case of\nBharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai\n(supra), this Court\n\nhas explained that concurrent findings of fact cannot be reopened in an\n\nappeal by special leave unless shown to be based on no evidence or\n\ninadmissible evidence or being perverse or suffering from disregard of some\n\nvital piece of evidence. In that case the finding of guilt concurrently recorded\n\nby the Trial Court and the High Court was challenged mainly on the ground\n\nof minor discrepancies in the evidence for which, this Court emphasised that\n\nexcessive importance cannot be attached to such minor discrepancies. This\n\nCourt explained the reasons including that a witness cannot be expected to\n\npossess a photographic memory; a witness is likely to be overtaken by events\n\nparticularly of unanticipated occurrence; the powers of observation differ from\n\nperson to person; by and large people cannot accurately recall the\n\nconversations or the sequence of events; and a witness howsoever truthful\n\nis liable to be overawed by the Court atmosphere and piercing cross-\n\nexamination etc. The following passage from this decision could be usefully\n\nextracted thus: -\n\n“5……Their evidence has been considered to be worthy of\nacceptance. It is a pure finding of fact recorded by the Sessions\nCourt and affirmed by the High Court. Such a concurrent finding of\nfact cannot be reopened in an appeal by special leave unless it is\nestablished : (1) that the finding is based on no evidence or (2) that\nthe finding is perverse, it being such as no reasonable person could\nhave arrived at even if the evidence was taken at its face value or\n(3) the finding is based and built on inadmissible evidence, which\nevidence, if excluded from vision, would negate the prosecution\ncase or substantially discredit or impair it or (4) some vital piece of\nevidence which would tilt the balance in favour of the convict has\nbeen overlooked, disregarded, or wrongly discarded. The present\nis not a case of such a nature. The finding of guilt recorded by the\nSessions Court as affirmed by the High Court has been challenged\nmainly on the basis of minor discrepancies in the evidence. We do\nnot consider it appropriate or permissible to enter upon a\nreappraisal or reappreciation of the evidence in the context of\nthe minor discrepancies painstakingly highlighted by learned\nCounsel for the appellant. Overmuch importance cannot be\nattached to minor discrepancies. The reasons are obvious:\n\n“(1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to\npossess a photographic memory and to recall the details\nof an incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the\nmental screen.\n\n(2) Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken\nby events. The witness could not have anticipated the\noccurrence which so often has an element of surprised.\n\nThe mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be\nattuned to absorb the details.\n\n(3) The powers of observation differ from person to\nperson. What one may notice, another may not. An object\nor movement might emboss its image on one person's\nmind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of another.\n(4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a\nconversation and reproduce the very words used by them\nor heard by them. They can only recall the main purport of\nthe conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be\na human tape-recorder.\n\n(5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time\nduration of an occurrence, usually, people make their\nestimates by guess-work on the spur of the moment at the\ntime of interrogation. And one cannot expect people to\nmake very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.\nAgain, it depends on the time-sense of individuals which\nvaries from person to person.\n\n(6) Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall\naccurately the sequence of events which takes place in\nrapid succession or in a short time span. A witness is\nliable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated\nlater on.\n\n(7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be\noverawed by the court atmosphere and the piercing\ncross-examination made by counsel and out of\nnervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding\nsequence of events, or fill up details from imagination on\nthe spur of the moment. The sub-conscious mind of the\nwitness sometimes so operates on account of the fear of\nlooking foolish or being disbelieved though the witness is\ngiving a truthful and honest account of the occurrence\nwitnessed by him — Perhaps it is a sort of a psychological\ndefence mechanism activated on the spur of the moment.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n12.4.\nIn the case of\nGangadhar Behera\n(supra), this Court again\n\nhighlighted that the normal discrepancies in evidence are of natural\n\noccurrence in the Court, while observing as under: -\n\n“15. Normal discrepancies in evidence are those which are due to\nnormal errors of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse\nof time, due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the\ntime of occurrence and those are always there however honest and\ntruthful a witness may be. Material discrepancies are those which\nare not normal, and not expected of a normal person. Courts have\nto label the category to which a discrepancy may be categorized.\nWhile normal discrepancies do not corrode the credibility of a party's\ncase, material discrepancies do so. These aspects were highlighted\nrecently in\nKrishna Mochi v. State of Bihar\n[(2002) 6 SCC 81] .…..”\n\n12.5.\n\nAs regards the approach towards the appreciation of the evidence of\n\nclosely related witnesses, in the case of\nGangabhavani\n(supra), this Court\n\nhas explained the principles as follows: -\n\n“15…..It is a settled legal proposition that the evidence of closely\nrelated witnesses is required to be carefully scrutinised and\nappreciated before any conclusion is made to rest upon it, regarding\nthe convict/accused in a given case. Thus, the evidence cannot\nbe disbelieved merely on the ground that the witnesses are\nrelated to each other or to the deceased. In the case the evidence\nhas a ring of truth to it, is cogent, credible and trustworthy, it can,\nand certainly should, be relied upon. (\nVide Bhagaloo Lodh v. State\nof U.P\n.) [(2011) 13 SCC 206]”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n12.6.\n\nIn the case of\nRamnaresh\n(supra), this Court has, though recognised\n\nthe right of the accused to maintain silence during investigation as also before\n\nthe Court in the examination under\nSection 313\nCrPC but, at the same time,\n\nhas also highlighted the consequences of maintaining silence and not\n\navailing opportunity to explain the circumstances appearing against him,\n\nincluding that of the permissibility to draw adverse inference in accordance\n\nwith law. This Court observed and held as under: -\n“49. In terms of\nSection 313\nCrPC, the accused has the freedom\nto maintain silence during the investigation as well as before the\ncourt. The accused may choose to maintain silence or complete\ndenial even when his statement under\nSection 313\nCrPC is\nbeing recorded, of course, the court would be entitled to draw\nan inference, including adverse inference, as may be\npermissible to it in accordance with law.\n\n**** **** *****\n\n52. It is a settled principle of law that the obligation to put material\nevidence to the accused under\nSection 313\nCrPC is upon the court.\n\nOne of the main objects of recording of a statement under this\nprovision of\nCrPC\nis to give an opportunity to the accused to explain\nthe circumstances appearing against him as well as to put\nforward his defence, if the accused so desires. But once he does\nnot avail this opportunity, then consequences in law must\nfollow. Where the accused takes benefit of this opportunity, then\nhis statement made under\nSection 313\nCrPC, insofar as it supports\nthe case of the prosecution, can be used against him for rendering\nconviction. Even under the latter, he faces the\nconsequences in law.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n12.7. The principles enunciated by this Court in regard to the obligation of\n\nexplanation in terms of\nSection 106\nof the Evidence Act and the\n\nconsequences of want of explanation have been explained by this Court in\n\nthe case of\nSatpal\n(supra) as follows: -\n\n“6. We have considered the respective submissions and the\nevidence on record. There is no eyewitness to the occurrence but\nonly circumstances coupled with the fact of the deceased having\nbeen last seen with the appellant. Criminal jurisprudence and the\nplethora of judicial precedents leave little room for reconsideration\nof the basic principles for invocation of the last seen theory as a\nfacet of circumstantial evidence. Succinctly stated, it may be a weak\nkind of evidence by itself to found conviction upon the same\nsingularly. But when it is coupled with other circumstances\nsuch as the time when the deceased was last seen with the\naccused, and the recovery of the corpse being in very close\nproximity of time, the accused owes an explanation under\n\nSection 106\nof the Evidence Act with regard to the\ncircumstances under which death may have taken place. If the\naccused offers no explanation, or furnishes a wrong\nexplanation, absconds, motive is established, and there is\ncorroborative evidence available inter alia in the form of\nrecovery or otherwise forming a chain of circumstances\nleading to the only inference for guilt of the accused,\nincompatible with any possible hypothesis of innocence,\nconviction can be based on the same. If there be any doubt or\nbreak in the link of chain of circumstances, the benefit of doubt must\ngo to the accused. Each case will therefore have to be examined on\nits own facts for invocation of the doctrine.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n12.8.\nIn\nSatye Singh and Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand\n: (2022) 5 SCC\n\n438, where the prosecution failed to prove the basic facts as against the\n\naccused, this Court emphasised that\nSection 106\nof the Evidence Act does\n\nnot relieve the prosecution of its primary duty to prove the guilt of the accused\n\nas follows: -\n\n“19. …the Court is of the opinion that the prosecution had miserably\nfailed to prove the entire chain of circumstances which would\nunerringly conclude that alleged act was committed by the accused\nonly and none else. Reliance placed by learned advocate Mr.\nMishra for the State on\nSection 106\nof the Evidence Act is also\nmisplaced, inasmuch as\nSection 106\nis not intended to relieve the\nprosecution from discharging its duty to prove the guilt of the\naccused….”\n\n12.9. Apart from the above, we may also usefully take note of the decision\n\nof this Court in the case of\nSabitri Samantaray v. State of Odisha\n: 2022\n\nSCC OnLine SC 673. In that case based on circumstantial evidence, with\n\nreference to\nSection 106\nof the Evidence Act, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court\n\nhas noted that if the accused had a different intention, the facts are specially\n\nwithin his knowledge which he must prove; and if, in a case based on\n\ncircumstantial evidence, the accused evades response to an incriminating\n\nquestion or offers a response which is not true, such a response, in itself,\n\nwould become an additional link in the chain of events. This Court said, inter\n\nalia, as under: -\n“19. Thus, although\nSection 106\nis in no way aimed at relieving the\nprosecution from its burden to establish the guilt of an accused, it\napplies to cases where chain of events has been successfully\nestablished by the prosecution, from which a reasonable inference\nis made out against the accused. Moreover, in a case based on\ncircumstantial evidence, whenever an incriminating question is\nposed to the accused and he or she either evades response, or\noffers a response which is not true, then such a response in itself\nbecomes an additional link in the chain of events.”\n\n13. While keeping the aforesaid principles in view, and while reiterating\n\nthat wholesome reappreciation of evidence is not within the scope of this\n\nappeal, we may examine if the concurrent findings call for any interference\n\nin this case.\n\n14. A few basic aspects are not of much controversy in this case,\n\nessentially based on circumstantial evidence. The husband of the appellant\n\nwas mostly living abroad and the appellant was mostly living with her\n\nparents at Kolakkudi. As per the version of the witnesses PW-1, PW-2 and\n\nPW-3, who supported the prosecution case as also as per the version of\n\nPW-6 Jamal Mohammed, father of the appellant, who did not support the\n\nprosecution case and was declared hostile, this much remains indisputable\n\nthat on 18.06.2007, the appellant came with her father and with her\n\ndaughter to Perambalur from Kolakkudi. The victim child, daughter of the\n\nappellant, met with her homicidal death on 21.06.2007.\n\n15. The major disputable part of the matter is that as per the testimony\n\nof PW-6 Jamal Mohammed, on 20.06.2007, he left the victim child with\n\nPW-1 Basheera and went back to Kolakkudi with his daughter, that is, the\n\nappellant. According to the prosecution case, the appellant remained very\nmuch in Perambalur with the victim child and in the morning of 21.06.2007,\n\nshe strangled the child when her mother-in-law (PW-1) was out of the\n\nhouse. According to PW-6 Jamal Mohammed, the appellant was not in\n\nPerambalur at the relevant point of time; and she came to Perambalur with\n\nhim on 21.06.2007 in the late afternoon after receiving information about\n\ndemise of the child and thereafter, she was arrested. Some of the other\n\nprosecution witnesses were also given the same suggestions in the cross-\n\nexamination. These aspects lead to the plea of alibi as has been referred\n\nto and relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant.\n\n15.1. The Trial Court and the High Court have examined the evidence on\n\nrecord and have rejected this plea of alibi with reference to the significant\n\nfeatures of the case that there is no corroborative evidence on record, to\n\nthe assertion made by PW-6 Jamal Mohammed, that on 20.06.2007, he\n\ntook his daughter back to his village Kolakkudi. The accused-appellant did\n\nnot adduce any evidence to prove that she was not present in Perambalur,\n\nat the time and place of incident. Apart from the fact that PW-1, PW-2 and\n\nPW-3 consistently maintained their versions that the appellant was\n\navailable at the time and place of incident, two independent witnesses, PW-\n\n4 Sharfunisha, landlord of PW-1 and PW-5 Thiru-Jothi, neighbour of PW-1\n\ntestified that they saw the appellant sitting with or near the body of the\n\ndeceased child immediately after, and at the place of, the incident.\n\nAlthough there appears to be no reason to discard the testimonies of PW-\n\n2 and PW-3 but even if for the sake of argument their testimonies are left\naside for being directly related witnesses who might not be favourably\n\ndisposed towards the appellant, there appears no reason to disbelieve and\n\ndiscard the testimonies of PW-4 and PW-5. Nothing even remotely has\n\nbeen shown as to why PW-4 and PW-5 would be interested in testifying\n\nabout the presence of appellant around the time, and at the place of\n\nincident.\n\n15.2. Apart from the foregoing, fact of the matter also remains that the\n\nappellant was arrested on 21.06.2007 i.e., the very day of the incident,\n\nalbeit nine hours after the incident, at the bus stand. However, when the\n\ntheory propounded by PW-6 Jamal Mohammed that the appellant had\n\ntravelled to Kolakkudi with him on 20.06.2007 and then travelled back to\n\nPerambalur on 21.06.2007 is discarded, all other facts taken together lead\n\nto the logical conclusion that the plea of alibi is required to be rejected.\n\n16. Another major factor highlighted and elaborated by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant relates to certain discrepancies appearing in the\n\nversions of PW-1 Basheera, as stated in the complaint made to the police\n\ncompared with her assertions before the Court. No doubt, there had been\n\nsome such discrepancies in the matter which, at the first blush, give rise to\n\ncertain doubts as to whether the testimony of PW-1 could be believed or\n\nnot. However, a close look at the record makes it clear that the\n\ndiscrepancies, said to be of contradictions in the versions given by PW-1\n\nBasheera, could only be considered to be normal and natural or being the\n\nresult of her want of proper comprehension.\n16.1. PW-1 Basheera is none other than mother-in-law of the appellant\n\nand the grand-mother of the victim child. The first discrepancy in the matter\n\nis that, as per the version in the complaint, she left her house in the morning\n\nto buy idli without taking money, but in her deposition, she stated that\n\nappellant gave her Rs. 100 and asked her to get idli. Another major\n\ndiscrepancy surfaces when it is noticed that in the complaint, she asserted\n\nthat the appellant ran away from the scene of occurrence but in her\n\ndeposition, she stated that the appellant was taken to the police station.\n\nThirdly, what she saw and did upon reaching the house after visiting the\n\nmarket is also stated differently in the complaint and in the deposition. The\n\nquestion is as to whether her testimony and the prosecution case be\n\nrejected altogether because of these discrepancies.\n\n16.2. In our view, the Trial Court has rightly analysed the matter and has\n\nrightly observed that when PW-1, sixty-five years of age, was deposing\n\nbefore the Court from her memory after one year from the incident, such\n\ndiscrepancies would not result in rejection of her testimony altogether. The\n\nrelevant features emanating from her assertions in the complaint as also in\n\nthe statement are that she had gone out to purchase eatables in the\n\nmorning while leaving the victim child with the appellant; and after coming\n\nback, found the child dead, with the appellant being with the child. As to\n\nwhether she had gone to the market after being given money by the\n\nappellant or without taking money, in our view, cannot override entire of her\n\ntestimony as also the testimonies of other witnesses. Further, the said\nwitness PW-1 seems to have obviously lost the track of facts when she\n\nasserted in her deposition that the appellant was taken to the police station\n\nafter the incident. It has clearly been established on record that the\n\nappellant was arrested in the late afternoon at the bus stand and it has\n\nnowhere been shown if she was taken to the police station immediately\n\nafter the incident. A suggestion made in that regard to the official witness\n\nPW-10 Subbulakshmi has also been specifically denied by her. The said\n\ndiscrepancy in the version of PW-1 is also of no relevance and the\n\nconcurrent findings of the two Courts cannot be displaced on that count.\n\nEven the version given in the complaint as if PW-1 saw the appellant\n\nstrangling her child seems to be an overt assertion immediately after the\n\nincident. The other witnesses who had reached the scene of crime\n\nincluding the independent witnesses PW-4 and PW-5 have consistently\n\nmaintained that the appellant was available with the dead body of the child\n\nat the place of, and immediately after, the incident.\n\n16.3. Taking an overall view of the matter, we do not find any reason that\n\nentire prosecution case be disbelieved and discarded because PW-1 has\n\nnot projected the case in a consistent manner. Apart from the private\n\nwitnesses, all the relevant facts have been duly established in the\n\ntestimonies of the official witnesses too. The discrepancies as noticed in\n\nthe present case, at the most, could be said to be of minor contradictions\n\nor inconsistencies or embellishments of trivial nature; and are reasonably\n\nreferable to the reasons recounted by this Court in\nBharwada Bhoginbhai\nHirjibhai\n(supra) for which, the minor discrepancies do occur in evidence\n\nand excessive importance cannot be attached to them.\n\n17. The submission that the assertion about the appellant having\n\nstrangled the victim, by pressing her saree around the neck, does not\n\ncorrelate with the post-mortem examination is also untenable. As noticed,\n\nthe medical officers have clearly established that the child suffered\n\nstrangulation with a wound measuring 20 cm in length and 2 cm in breadth\n\naround the neck and with thyroid cartilage bone having been fractured. PW-\n\n8 also opined that if outer end of the saree was twisted and put around the\n\nneck and the person was strangled, there was a chance of such a wound.\n\nThe saree in question had been duly recovered from the appellant and was\n\nsaid to be carrying blood stains.\n\n18. In the given set of facts and circumstances, the motive as\n\nsuggested by the prosecution, i.e., the desire of the appellant not to live in\n\nher matrimonial house and, on being forced to do so only because of the\n\nchild, she being not interested in the existence of the child, though presents\n\na somewhat difficult proposition but, at the same time, cannot be ruled out\n\naltogether, particularly looking to the fact that, until 18.06.2007, the\n\nappellant was living with her parents and she was forced to come to\n\nPerambalur for the purpose of upbringing of the child with the family of her\n\nhusband.\n\n19. Another submission made on behalf of the appellant, that her\n\nhusband has not been examined by the prosecution, does not take her\ncase any further. Her husband was not shown to be in the country at the\n\ntime of incident and he was not a direct witness in relation to the material\n\nfacts to be established by the prosecution. Other way round, if at all the\n\nappellant considered him to be a material witness, nothing prevented her\n\nfrom making a prayer to the Court for his examination and nothing\n\nprevented her from making specific submissions in that regard during her\n\nexamination under\nSection 313\nCrPC.\n\n20. As regards the statement under\nSection 313\nCrPC, the appellant\n\nhas not given any explanation whatsoever and has not made any statement\n\nexcept denying the circumstances put to her. In the facts of the present\n\ncase, when the prosecution evidence categorically established the fact that\n\nthe victim child was last seen alive with the appellant only; she was required\n\nto explain the circumstances leading to the demise of the child. Upon her\n\nfailure to do so and failure to give the explanation with regard to the\n\ncircumstances under which death may have taken place, burden of\nSection\nof the Evidence Act operates heavily against the appellant, as\n\nnoticeable from the decisions above referred, particularly in the cases of\n\nSatpal and Sabitri Samantaray\n(supra).\n\n21. In an overall comprehension of the material on record and the\n\nfindings recorded by the Trial Court and the High Court, in our view, no\n\ncase for interference with the concurrent findings of fact is made out.\n\n22. The submissions made in the alternative that in the given set of\n\ncircumstances, the present case could only be of culpable homicide not\namounting to murder has only been noted to be rejected. Even if it be taken\n\nthat there was a quarrel of the appellant with her mother-in-law (PW-1) in\n\nthe morning of the date of incident because the appellant wanted to go the\n\nplace of her father, it cannot be said that such a quarrel would make it a\n\ncase of grave and sudden provocation. The circumstances as proved on\n\nrecord, and the manner of commission of crime, make it clear that the\n\npresent case cannot be brought under any of the Exceptions of\nSection\nIPC; and conviction and sentencing of the appellant under\nSection 302\n\nIPC cannot be faulted.\n\n23. In view of the above, this appeal fails and is, therefore, dismissed.\n\n..…………………………J.\n(DINESH MAHESHWARI)\n\n..…………………………J.\n(BELA M. TRIVEDI)\nNEW DELHI;\n\nFEBRUARY 22, 2023",
