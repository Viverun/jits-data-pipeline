JUSTICE APARESH KUMAR SINGH\n HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE B.B.MANGALMURTI\n\n CAV on 11th October, 2017 Pronounced on: 02 .02. 2018\n\nB.B.Mangalmurti, J. This appeal is filed against judgment passed in Matrimonial\n\n Title Suit No. 18 of 2001 by Principal Judge, Family Court, Hazaribagh\n\n dismissing the suit on 20.02.2008.\n\n 2. The case of the appellant is that the marriage of appellant Ajay\n\n Narayan Das with respondent Asha Devi was solemnized in the month of\n\n June, 1995 after observing the Hindu rites and customs. Thereafter both\n\n started their conjugal life in the house of the appellant at Village-\n\n Morangi, P.S. Muffasil, district - Hazaribagh. After few months of\n\n marriage, the respondent did not want to live in the village area and\n\n without the consent of the husband left the village in the month of\n\n October, 1995 and stayed in the house of her father at village - Tikuliya\n\n 2 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\nfor about six months. During this period, the appellant visited village\n\nTikuliya where the respondent was residing but she refused to return\n\nwith her husband as also expressed her desire that if her husband will live\n\nin the town area leaving the house at village-Morangi then she will\n\naccompany him. Since the husband was unemployed, therefore, he could\n\nnot fulfill her demand. The further case is that the respondent came back\n\nin the month of May, 1996 at village-Morangi but was compelling her\n\nhusband to leave his parents' house and thereafter she started demanding\n\nRs. 6 lakhs from her husband. The husband could not fulfill the demand\n\nand then respondent permanently left the house of her husband in the\n\nmonth of July, 1998. Therefore, there was no cohabitation between the\n\nhusband and wife since July, 1998 as the respondent deserted the\n\nappellant causing mental agony. Appellant visited several times to bring\n\nback the respondent but she refused to come back and also imposed\n\nallegation of impotency against her husband which also caused mental\n\nagony to the appellant. The respondent implicated the entire family\n\nmembers of her husband in a false criminal case. The hostile attitude\n\ntowards amicable settlement and her gesture was so violent that that the\n\nSessions Judge also observed while hearing the anticipatory bail\n\napplication being A.B.P. No.18 of 2008 that she is not ready to live at her\n\nin-laws place rather she had herself gone to her parents and for\n\ncompromise sake she demanded registration of entire lands of her\n\nhusband's share or consideration money of Rs.6,00,000/-. It was also\n\nobserved that complainant is present in dock and identified by Sri Anil\n\nKumar Sinha, Advocate and when asked she showed absolute hostile\n\n 3 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\nattitude towards amicable settlement and rather from her gesture she\n\nherself appears to be with violent mood.\n\n3. After appearance of respondent in the suit, a written statement was\n\nfiled and after taking the legal technical pleas she denied the allegations of\n\nnot wanting to live in the village as well as demand of Rs. 6 lakhs and\n\nleaving the appellant's house on her own sweet will rather she was\n\ncompelled to leave due to humiliation, torture and neglect shown towards\n\nher. She denied that she ever made any allegation on the character or\n\nimpotency against the appellant. It was also stated that observation made\n\nby the Sessions Judge in a bail application is not binding upon the\n\nrespondent nor could be taken into account in adjudicating this case.\n\nAfter examining five (05) witnesses on behalf of appellant, 17 exhibits\n\nwere also brought on record from the side of appellant whereas\n\nrespondent also examined five (05) witnesses and brought on record\n\nexhibits A to L.\n\n4. After appreciating the oral and documentary evidences brought on\n\nrecord from both the sides, the court below came to the conclusion that\n\nthere is no breakdown of the marriage rather, respondent came in her\n\nsasural in the year 2003 on compromise and after acquittal of her\n\nhusband. She came to her sasural after filing of the suit and she had\n\nclearly stated in her statement that she is still willing to reside with her\n\nhusband so no relief can be granted on the ground that the marriage had\n\nbroken down irretrievably. Since the petitioner has not been able to\n\nestablish the fact that the respondent treated him with cruelty and he also\n\nfailed to establish that respondent deserted him, so no other ground is\n\n 4 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\navailable in the plaint, therefore, petitioner is not entitled for a decree of\n\ndivorce.\n\n5. Assailing the judgment learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant submitted that the Principal Judge, Family Court, without\n\nappreciating the evidences brought on record, dismissed the suit for\n\ndissolution of marriage which was filed on the ground of cruelty and\n\ndesertion. He further submitted that the court below has completely\n\nignored that the respondent without any valid reason abandoned her\n\nmatrimonial house in the month of July, 1998 and in spite of repeated\n\nrequests by the appellant, she never returned to her matrimonial house.\n\nThe court below also erred that the respondent was putting pressure on\n\nthe appellant to transfer his entire share of land in her favour as well as\n\nshe was demanding Rs. 6 lakhs as she was not in the mood to reside in a\n\nvillage area. She has expressed her desire to live in the town area. Counsel\n\nfor the appellant further submitted that the respondent instituted Simaria\n\nP.S. Case No.47 of 2001 implicating the father and brothers of the\n\nappellant although the brother of respondent was actually murdered by\n\nthe extremists. These acts constitute cruelty committed upon the\n\nappellant. He also submitted that court below overlooked the situation\n\nthat there was breakdown of marriage as the respondent was not willing\n\nto reside with the husband and she has caused physical and mental\n\ncruelty.\n\n Elaborating his argument, counsel for the appellant submitted that\n\nthe respondent filed a criminal case under \nSection 498A\n of the Indian\n\nPenal Code and under Section ¾ of the \nDowry Prohibition Act\n against the\n\n 5 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\nappellant, his parents and elder brother and two younger brothers being\n\nTandwa P.S. Case No.29 of 2000. When the anticipatory bail applications\n\non behalf of lady members of the family were filed the nature, behavior\n\nand character of the respondent were observed by the Sessions Judge in\n\nA.B.P. No. 18 of 2008. In that case the appellant remained in judicial\n\ncustody for about four months and thereafter he was released on bail,\n\nalthough the court of S.D.J.M., Chatra by his judgment dated 29.04.2003\n\nacquitted them from the charges which has been brought on record as\n\nExt.-10. He further submitted that the brother of respondent was\n\nmurdered by the extremists but taking advantage of the situation the\n\nfather and brothers of the appellants were made accused in Simariya P.S.\n\nCase No. 47 of 2001 (Ext.-1) but after investigation the final form was\n\nsubmitted against the father and brother of the appellant with the finding\n\nthat the murder was caused by the extremists (Ext.-4). The respondent\n\nhad threatened that she will commit suicide if Rs. 6 lakhs is not paid to\n\nher in lieu of the share of agricultural land of the appellant for which a\n\nsanha was submitted in Tandwa police station and on enquiry the same\n\nwas found true which has been marked as Ext. 6 and 7. The father of the\n\nrespondent Kamakhya Prasad Singh filed an application before Sub-\n\nDivisional Police Officer, Chatra for causing torture for divorce by the\n\nappellant upon the respondent. This complaint was also enquired into\n\nand the same was also found to be false which has also been brought on\n\nrecord as Ext.-11. The respondent went further in filing a complaint case\n\nNo. 333 of 2005 before the court of C.J.M., Chatra under Section 498 A,\n\n323, 324 and 504 \nI.P.C\n. (Ext.-15) where the appellant and his father was\n\nconvicted and two years' imprisonment was imposed. Subsequently on\n\n 6 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\nAppeal the said conviction was set aside by the court of Sessions Judge,\n\nChatra. The respondent-wife without the consent of the appellant got her\n\nuterus removed at Vandana Nursing Home, Hazaribagh in the year 2013.\n\nCounsel for the appellant submitted that all these incidents clearly\n\nindicate towards torture meted out to the appellant and every efforts were\n\nmade by the respondent-wife to cause mental and physical torture to the\n\nappellant and/or appellant's family. He also submitted that the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has held that even filing of one false case could be treated\n\nas cruelty. \nHe relied on the decisions rendered in the case of \nK.Srinivas\n\nRao Vs. D.A.Deepa\n reported in (\n2013) 5 SCC 226 and K.Srinivas Vs.\n\nK.Sunita\n reported in (2014) 16 SCC 34 Paragraph-6 is quoted\n\nhereinbelow:-\n\n \"6. Another argument which has been articulated on\n behalf of the learned counsel for the Respondent is that the filing of\n the criminal complaint has not been pleaded in the petition itself. As\n we see it, the criminal complaint was filed by the wife after filing of\n the husband's divorce petition, and being subsequent events could\n have been looked into by the Court. In any event, both the parties\n were fully aware of this facet of cruelty which was allegedly suffered\n by the husband. When evidence was led, as also when arguments\n were addressed, objection had not been raised on behalf of the\n Respondent-Wife that this aspect of cruelty was beyond the\n pleadings.\"\n\n6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the conduct of the wife in\n\nmaking unfounded, indecent and defamatory allegations against the\n\nfamily members and her all attempts to ensure that the other sides were\n\nput in jail and he was removed from his job certainly constituted cruelty.\n\nCounsel for the petitioner also submitted that the court below has erred in\n\nholding that the respondent had after compromise came to the house of\n\nappellant and stayed till the year 2003. The father of respondent-\n\nKamakhya Prasad Singh has deposed in Paragraph 45 of cross-\n\nexamination that his daughter Asha Devi is staying with him since the\n\n 7 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\nyear 2000 even the respondent has also stated in Paragraph 23 of her\n\ncross-examination that she remained in her Sasural from 1997 till the year\n\n2000. If the statement of respondent and her father is taken then the court\n\nbelow has come to a wrong conclusion that the respondent-wife had\n\nstayed in the house of appellant till the year 2003. The court below has\n\nalso erred in holding that the judgment passed in Matrimonial Suit No.18\n\nof 2001 was passed on the basis of compromise but in the evidence of\n\nfather of respondent Kamakhya Prasad Singh it has not been stated about\n\nthe compromise. The respondent in her deposition have stated about the\n\nPanchayti between the year 2000-03 but no fruitful result could be\n\nachieved. The respondent has admitted that she is working as Para\n\nteacher at her parental village. Therefore, the court below has misdirected\n\nitself in coming to a conclusion which is not based on the evidences\n\nbrought on record.\n\n7. Learned Senior counsel appearing for the respondent submitted\n\nthat the marriages between the parties were solemnized in June, 1995. The\n\nrespondent has returned to her matrimonial house in 2003 during the\n\npendency of matrimonial suit, so it is not a case of desertion. He\n\nsubmitted that actually the respondent was compelled to leave\n\nmatrimonial home. He further submitted that FIR was lodged by father of\n\nrespondent that does not constitute mental cruelty. He also submitted that\n\nremarks passed by Sessions Judge while considering the anticipatory bail\n\napplication could be termed as mere observation of that court. He further\n\nsubmitted that it was not the pleading that entire family member were\n\nimplicated in the murder case. The respondent-wife acted upon as per the\n\nterms of compromise but the respondent did not withdrew matrimonial\n\n 8 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\nsuit and violated the condition of compromise. As per compromise she\n\nreturned to matrimonial house also. Therefore, the court below has rightly\n\nheld that the marriage has not broken down irretrievably and dismissed\n\nthe suit. The appellant could not establish that he was treated by\n\nrespondent with cruelty since after compromise she resided with the\n\nhusband in the year 2003, so living separately for a long time is also not\n\nestablished. In this situation, learned Senior counsel prayed for dismissal\n\nof this appeal.\n\n8. Considering the above submission of the parties and on perusal of\n\nlower court records, it appears that the appellant-husband has filed suit\n\nfor a decree of divorce under \nSection 13\n of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955\n\non the ground of cruelty as well as desertion with further prayer for cost\n\nof suit or any other relief. Counsel for the appellant tried to establish that\n\nconduct of the wife towards the family members of the appellant was\n\nsuch which will fall under the category of cruelty inflicted upon the\n\nappellant. With a view to put pressure upon the appellant, the respondent\n\nstarted demanding transfer of his share of land in her favour or\n\nRs.6,00,000/- in lieu thereof. The respondent was not in a mood to reside\n\nin village area. With a view to implicate the family members they were\n\nmade accused in Simaria P.S. Case No.47 of 2001 which was lodged when\n\nthe brother of respondent was murdered by the extremist outfit. The\n\nrespondent has also filed a criminal case under \nSection 498A\n of the Indian\n\nPenal Code and \nSection 3\n/\n4\n of Dowry Prohibition Act against the\n\nappellant and his family members. In that case the appellant remained in\n\njudicial custody for about four months. The court of S.D.J.M., Chatra\n\nacquitted the appellant in this case so the conduct of wife could be\n\n 9 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\ninferred that these actions of filing false criminal cases are lodged not only\n\nwith a view to put pressure upon the appellant but the same also caused\n\nmental torture to the appellant and their family members. Several exhibits\n\nhave been brought on record by the appellant. From the Ext.15, it would\n\nappear that the respondent went on filing Complaint Case bearing No.333\n\nof 2005 before the court of C.J.M., Chatra under \nSections\n\n498A\n/\n323\n/\n324\n/\n504\n of the Indian Penal Code in which the appellant and\n\nhis father was convicted but the conviction was set aside in appeal. It is\n\nalso brought to our notice that the brother of respondent was murdered\n\nbut the family members of appellant were also implicated although the\n\nPolice after investigation finding the allegation false submitted the final\n\nform. These actions of respondent are such which might have inflicted\n\nmental torture upon the appellant and their family members. \nThe\n\njudgment \nK.Srinivas Vs. K.Sunita\n (supra) has amply covered the facts of\n\npresent case. The Hon'ble Supreme Court came to the finding that the\n\nrespondent-wife had filed a criminal complaint, and even one such\n\ncomplaint is sufficient to constitute matrimonial cruelty. In this case also\n\nthe appellant and their family members were made accused in a murder\n\ncase although their involvement were not found and final form was\n\nsubmitted. Thus, the respondent-wife and her Father knowingly and\n\nintentionally filed criminal cases that amounts to cruelty under Section\n\n13(1)(i-a) of the \nHindu Marriage Act\n.\n \nThe proposition held in \nK.Srinivas\n\nRao Vs. D.A.Deepa\n (supra) also deals with mental cruelty. It has dealt\n\nwith several other judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court and came to the\n\nfinding that the effects of the conduct of the respondent-wife in filing\n\nunfounded indecent and defamatory allegations and the manner and\n\n 10 F.A. No. 74 of 2008\n\nconduct would constitute mental cruelty to the appellant-husband.\n\nTherefore basing on the proposition of above two judgments of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court, we come to the conclusion that the court below has\n\nerred in holding that the appellant could not able to establish the ground\n\nof cruelty. The conduct of respondent-wife and her family members could\n\nbe considered within the category of cruelty.\n\n9. In these circumstances, the appellant deserves to get a decree of\n\ndivorce. Accordingly, we allow the appeal holding that the appellant\n\nentitled for a decree of divorce. The marriage solemnized between the\n\nAppellant and Respondent stand dissolved. Decree accordingly.\n\n(Aparesh Kumar Singh, J.) (B.B. Mangalmurti, J.)\n\nHigh Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi\nDated 2nd February, 2018\nBirendra/AFR",
