Petitioners were initially appointed as Junior\n\n Engineers (Civil) in the Department of Public Works,\n\n Government of Himachal Pradesh on 8.9.1992 and\n\n 16.5.1988, respectively. Petitioner No.1 qualified\n\n of\n Bachelor of Engineering Course and petitioner No.2\n\n qualified AMIE course during service. Petitioner No.1\n rt\n also completed his M.E. (Highway Engineering) Couse\n\n in March, 2003.\n\n 3. Both the petitioners were promoted as\n\n Assistant Engineers (Civil) w.e.f. December, 2006.\n\n Petitioner No.1 was assigned the charge of Executive\n\n Engineer (Civil) in October 2016 and was substantially\n\n promoted to the said post in March, 2017. Petitioner\n\n No.2 was promoted as Executive Engineer (Civil) in\n\n August, 2016.\n\n 4. The case as set-up by the petitioners is that\n\n till 30.05.2002, the service conditions to the post of\n\n Assistant Engineer (Civil) were governed by the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 3\n\n Recruitment and Promotion Rules framed in the year\n\n 1995. Amended Recruitment and Promotion Rules were\n\n notified w.e.f. 01.06.2002. In 1995 Rules, the vacancy-\n\n .\n\n based roster was maintained, whereas, on promulgation\n\n of 2002 Rules, the post-based roster was adopted.\n\n 5. As per the petitioners, 21 clear cut vacancies\n\n of Assistant Engineers were available in April 2002 and\n\n of\n 23 vacancies were anticipated upto 31.12.2002 due to\n\n retirement/promotion. In this manner, total 44 number\n rt\n of vacancies were available in the year 2002 for which\n\n DPC was to be convened. By application of vacancy-\n\n based roster, two posts fell to the quota to which the\n\n petitioners belonged. The DPC was however convened\n\n on 30.5.2003 and the promotions were made on the\n\n basis of 2002 Rules by ignoring the vacancy position as\n\n in April 2002 i.e. before promulgation of 2002 Rules.\n\n \n6. It has further been submitted on behalf of the\n\n petitioners that review DPC was convened by the\n\n respondent-department in 2013 in compliance to the\n\n orders passed by this Court in CWP No. 1358 of 2008\n\n titled \nS.S. Kutlehria and others Vs State of H.P and\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 4\n\n others\n and at that juncture also the case of the\n\n petitioners was not considered for review.\n\n 7. The petitioners made repeated\n\n .\n\n representations. The Department was convinced with\n\n the injustice meted out to the petitioners and had\n\n withheld its final decision on the representation of the\n\n petitioners on account of the various matters pending\n\n of\n before this Court. It is further submitted that even after\n\n the embargo placed on the promotions of Assistant\n rt\n Engineers by this Court was lifted, justice was not done\n\n to the petitioners, rather the representation of petitioner\n\n No.1, Annexure P-10, has been rejected on the ground\n\n that the claim of the petitioner was stalled in case the\n\n settled position was tinkered, it will open gates for\n\n unavoidable litigation and will create unrest and chaos\n\n in the service.\n\n 8. The respondent in its reply has supported its\n\n action on the ground that the petitioners have\n\n approached this Court after a period of more than 15\n\n years and their claim is barred by principle of delay and\n\n laches. It is submitted that the petitioners had not\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 5\n\n preferred any representation whatsoever, even the\n\n representation of petitioner No.1 was submitted at a\n\n belated stage. The passing of order Annexure P-10 has\n\n .\n\n been justified on the ground that the representation of\n\n petitioner No.1 was not only devoid of merits, but was\n\n also time barred.\n\n 9. \nIn rejoinder, the petitioners have submitted\n\n of\n that the seniority list of Assistant Engineers (Civil) in the\n\n Department of Public Works has been finalized and\n rt\n circulated only recently after the judgment passed by\n\n this Court on 24.4.2023 in CWP No.5718 of 2022 titled\n\n as \nAnkush Jamwal and others vs. State of H.P. and\n\n another\n and hence, there is no question of unsettling\n\n the seniority position. As per petitioners, the grant of\n\n promotion to the petitioners as Assistant Engineers\n\n w.e.f. 2002 will not change the equation in any manner.\n\n 10. I have heard learned counsel for the parties\n\n and have also gone through the records of the case\n\n carefully.\n\n \n11. The petitioners have based their claim on the\n\n principle of \"old post old rules\" as enunciated in \nY.V.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 6\n\n Rangaiah vs. J. Sreenivasa Rao\n, (1983) (3) SCC 284.\n\n However, the perception has undergone a sea change.\n\n \nIn \nUnion of India & others vs. Krishna Kumar\n &\n\n .\n\n \nOthers, Civil Appeal No.672 of 2019, reported in (2019)\n\n 1 SCR 982, after discussing the fruition of law on the\n\n subject from \nY.V. Rangiah\n (supra), \nDeepak Agarwal\n\n vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n (\n2011) 6 SCC 725 and\n\n of\n State of Tripura vs. Nikhil Ranjan Chakraborty\n,\n\n (2017) 3 SCC 646, it has been held as under:\n\n \nrt \"It is well-settled that there is no vested right to\n promotion, but a right to be considered for promotion\n\n in accordance with the Rules which prevail on the date\n on which consideration for promotion takes place. This\n Court has held that there is no rule of universal\n application to the effect that vacancies must\n necessarily be filled in on the basis of the law which\n\n existed on the date when they arose. The decision of\n this Court in \nY.V. Rangaiah vs. Sreenivasa Rao\n has\n been construed in subsequent decisions as a case\n where the applicable Rules required the process of\n\n promotion or selection to be completed within a\n stipulated time frame.\n \nHence, it has been held in \nH.S.\n\n Grewal vs. Union of India\n that the creation of an\n intermediate post would not amount to an interference\n with the vested right to promotion.\n\n Once the structure of Assam Rifles underwent a\n change following the creation of the intermediate post\n of Warrant Officer, persons holding the post of\n Havildar would be considered for promotion to the\n post of Warrant Officer. The intermediate post of\n Warrant Officer was created as a result of the\n restructuring exercise. The High Court was in error in\n postulating that vacancies which arose prior to the\n amendment of the Recruitment Rules would\n necessarily be governed by the Rules which existed at\n the time of the occurrence of the vacancies. As the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 7\n\n decided cases noted earlier indicate, there is no such\n rule of absolute or universal application. The entire\n basis of the decision of the High Court was that those\n who were recruited prior to the restructuring exercise\n and were holding the post of Havildars had acquired\n a vested right of promotion to the post of Naib\n\n .\n\n Subedar. This does not reflect the correct position in\n\n law. The right is to be considered for promotion in\n accordance with the Rules as they exist when the\n exercise is carried out for promotion.\n\n \n12. Recently a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court in \nState of Himachal Pradesh and\n\n of\n others vs. Raj Kumar and others\n, (2023) 3 SCC 773\n\n has held as under:\n\n \nrt\n \"14. We have taken note of the fact that there are a\n large number of decisions that have either followed\n\n the principle in Rangaiah or have distinguished it. The\n principle in \nRangaiah\n's case has given rise to a\n number of decisions, most of them have disapplied\n Rangaiah and have in fact, watered-down the\n principle while distinguishing it. In this view of the\n\n matter, and for clarity and certainty, it is necessary\n for us to review the subject and restate the principle\n in simple and clear terms.\n\n \n15. We will first examine the principle \nlaid down in\n\n Rangaiah itself. We will verify it in the context of the\n\n constitutional position provided in Chapter XIV of the\n Constitution relating to services under the State.\n We\n will thereafter examine the decisions that followed\n Rangaiah and also those that have distinguished it.\n\n After restating the principle, we will apply it to the\n facts of the case for arriving at our decision.\n\n XXX XXX XXX\n\n 28. In view of the above principles, flowing from the\n constitutional status of a person in employment with\n the State, we have no hesitation in holding that the\n observations in Rangaiah that posts which fell vacant\n prior to the amendment of Rules would be governed\n by old Rules and not by new Rules do not reflect the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 8\n\n correct position of law. We have already explained\n that the Syed Khalid Rizivi V Union of India 1993\n Supp (3) SCC 575 ; Hardev Singh v Union of India\n 2011(10) SCC 121 Rajasthan Public Service\n Commission v. Chanan Ram, (1998) 4 SCC\n\n 202. Status of a Government employee involves a\n\n .\n\n \nrelationship governed exclusively by rules and that\n\n there are no rights outside these rules that govern the\n services. Further, the Court in \nRangaiah\n's case has\n not justified its observation by locating such a right on\n any principle or on the basis of the new Rules.28 As\n\n there are a large number of judgments which followed\n Rangaiah under the assumption that an overarching\n principle has been \nlaid down in\n Rangaiah, we have to\n necessarily examine the cases that followed\n\n of\n Rangaiah. We will now examine how subsequent\n decisions understood, applied or distinguished\n Rangaiah.\n\n rt XXX XXX XXX\n\n \n84. The decision in \nDeepak Agarwal\n (supra) is a\n complete departure from the principle in Rangaiah, in\n\n as much as the Court has held that a candidate has a\n right to be considered in the light of the existing rule.\n That is the rule in force on the date the consideration\n takes place.\n \nThis enunciation is followed in many\n subsequent decisions including that of \nUnion of India\n\n v. Krishna Kumar\n (supra). In fact, in Krishna Kumar\n Court held that there is only a \"right to be considered\n for promotion in accordance with rules which prevail\n on the date on which consideration for promotion take\n\n place.\"\n\n \n85. The consistent findings in these fifteen decisions\n that \nRangaiah\n's case must be seen in the context of\n its own facts, coupled with the declarations therein\n that there is no rule of universal application to the\n\n effect that vacancies must necessarily be filled on the\n basis of rules which existed on the date which they\n arose, compels us to conclude that the decision in\n Rangaiah is impliedly overruled. However, as there is\n no declaration of law to this effect, it continues to be\n cited as a precedent and this Court has been\n distinguishing it on some ground or the other, as we\n have indicated hereinabove. For clarity and certainty,\n it is, therefore, necessary for us to hold;\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 9\n\n \n85.1. The statement in \nY.V. Rangaiah v. J. Sreenivasa\n Rao\n that, \"the vacancies which occurred prior to the\n amended rules would be governed by the old rules\n and not by the amended rules\", does not reflect the\n correct proposition of law governing services under the\n Union and the States under part XIV of the\n\n .\n\n Constitution. It is hereby overruled.\n\n 85.2. The rights and obligations of persons serving\n the Union and the States are to be sourced from the\n rules governing the services.\"\n\n 13. Thus, Y.V. Rangaiah, stands overruled and\n\n it is well settled that the Government servant has no\n\n of\n right to seek promotion and, therefore, the rules\n\n prevalent at the time of his consideration for promotion\n rt\n shall prevail.\n\n 14. In the facts of the case in hand, the DPC was\n\n convened on 31.5.2003 when 2002 Recruitment and\n\n Promotion Rules were in vogue. Admittedly, till the\n\n availability of 1995 Rules, the candidature of\n\n incumbents was not considered for promotion to the\n\n post of Assistant Engineer (Civil). That being so, the\n\n claim of petitioners for considering them for promotion\n\n to the post of Assistant Engineer (Civil) for the year\n\n 2002, is not tenable.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 10\n\n 15. Further, vide impugned Annexure P-10, the\n\n representation of petitioner No.1 has been rejected\n\n primarily on the ground that the same was belated\n\n .\n\n attempt and in case after a long lapse of time the\n\n seniority positions are disturbed, the entire services will\n\n be affected.\n\n of\n\n 16. Noticeably, petitioner No.2 has not made any\n\n representation at any stage. There is no individual\n rt\n representation of petitioner No. 2 on record. In the case\n\n of petitioner No.1 also, the first representation filed by\n\n him was in the year 2014. Another representation was\n\n filed by petitioner No.1 in 2021.\n\n 17. The DPC was held on 31.5.2003 when the\n\n petitioners were denied their alleged right of\n\n consideration against vacancies available in the year\n\n 2002. Petitioners did not raise any grievance at that\n\n stage. In 2006, petitioners were promoted as Assistant\n\n Engineers (Civil), and they accepted such promotion\n\n without any reservation. Thereafter, till 2014, no issue\n\n was raised by the petitioners and in 2014 also, it was\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 11\n\n petitioner No.1, who had submitted his first\n\n representation. Thereafter, second representation was\n\n filed by him in the year 2021, which was rejected vide\n\n .\n\n impugned Annexure P-10. In these circumstances, the\n\n claim of the petitioners is stale. The delay and laches\n\n stare at their face.\n\n of\n\n 18. \nIn \nState of Uttaranchal and another vs.\n\n Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari and others\n (2013) 12\n rt\n SCC 179, it has been held as under:\n\n \"17. \nIn \nC. Jacob vs. Director of Geology and Mining\n\n (2008) 10 SCC 115, a two-Judge Bench was dealing\n with the concept of representations and the directions\n\n issued by the court or tribunal to consider the\n representations and the challenge to the said rejection\n thereafter. In that context, the court has expressed\n\n thus: (SCC p.123, para 10)\n\n \"10. Every representation to the Government for\n relief, may not be replied on merits.\n\n Representations relating to matters which have\n\n become stale or barred by limitation, can be\n rejected on that ground alone, without\n examining the merits of the claim.

Representations with\n incomplete particulars may be replied by\n seeking relevant particulars. The replies to such\n representations, cannot furnish a fresh cause of\n action or revive a stale or dead claim.\"\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 12\n\n 18. \nIn \nUnion of India and others v. M.K. Sarkar\n, (2010)\n 2 SCC 59, this Court, after referring to \nC. Jacob\n (supra)\n has ruled that (SCC p.66, para 15)\n\n \"15. When a belated representation in regard to\n\n .\n\n a \"stale\" or \"dead\" issue/dispute is considered\n\n and decided, in compliance with a direction by\n the court/tribunal to do so, the date of such\n decision cannot be considered as furnishing a\n\n fresh cause of action for reviving the \"dead\"\n issue or time-barred dispute. The issue of\n limitation or delay and laches should be\n considered with reference to the original cause\n of action and not with reference to the date on\n\n of\n which an order is passed in compliance with a\n court's direction. Neither a court's direction to\n consider a representation issued without\n examining the merits, nor a decision given in\n rt compliance with such direction, will extend the\n limitation, or erase the delay and laches.\n\n 28. Remaining oblivious to the factum of delay and\n laches and granting relief is contrary to all settled\n principles and even would not remotely attract the\n concept of discretion. We may hasten to add that the\n\n same may not be applicable in all circumstances\n where certain categories of fundamental rights are\n\n infringed. But, a stale claim of getting promotional\n benefits definitely should not have been entertained\n\n by the tribunal and accepted by the High Court.\"\n\n 19. \nIn \nUnion of India and others vs. C. Girija\n\n and others\n (2019) 15 SCC 633, it has been held as\n\n under:\n\n \n\"16. This Court had occasion to consider the question\n of cause of action in reference to grievances pertaining\n to service matters. This Court in \nC. Jacob Vs. Director\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 13\n\n of Geology and Mining and Another\n, (2008) 10 SCC\n 115 had occasion to consider the case where an\n employee was terminated and after decades, he filed\n a representation, which was decided. After decision of\n\n .\n\n the representation, he filed an O.A. in the Tribunal,\n\n which was entertained and order was passed. In the\n above context, in paragraph No.9, following has been\n\n held: (SCC pp. 122-23)\n\n \"9. The courts/tribunals proceed on the\n assumption, that every citizen deserves a reply\n\n of\n to his representation. Secondly, they assume\n that a mere direction to consider and dispose\n of the representation does not involve any\n \"decision\" on rights and obligations of parties.\n rt Little do they realise the consequences of such\n a direction to \"consider\". If the representation\n is considered and accepted, the ex-employee\n gets a relief, which he would not have got on\n\n account of the long delay, all by reason of the\n direction to \"consider\". If the representation is\n considered and rejected, the ex-employee files\n an application/writ petition, not with reference\n to the original cause of action of 1982, but by\n\n treating the rejection of the representation\n given in 2000, as the cause of action. A prayer\n is made for quashing the rejection of\n representation and for grant of the relief\n\n claimed in the representation. The\n tribunals/High Courts routinely entertain such\n\n applications/petitions ignoring the huge delay\n preceding the representation, and proceed to\n examine the claim on merits and grant relief. In\n this manner, the bar of limitation or the laches\n\n gets obliterated or ignored.\"\n\n \n17. This Court again in \nUnion of India and Others Vs.\n M.K. Sarkar\n, (2010) 2 SCC 59 on belated\n representation laid down following, which is\n extracted below: (SCC p.66, para 15)\n\n \"15. When a belated representation in regard\n to a \"stale\" or \"dead\" issue/dispute is\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 14\n\n considered and decided, in compliance with a\n direction by the court/tribunal to do so, the\n date of such decision cannot be considered as\n furnishing a fresh cause of action for reviving\n the \"dead\" issue or time-barred dispute.

Again, this Court in \nState of Uttaranchal and\n Another Vs. Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari and Others\n,\n (2013) 12 SCC 179 had occasion to consider question\n rt\n of delay in challenging the promotion. The \nCourt\n further held\n that representations relating to a\n\n stale claim or dead grievance does not give rise to a\n fresh cause of action. In paras 19 and 23, following\n was laid down: (SCC pp. 184-85)\n\n \"19. From the aforesaid authorities it is clear\n as crystal that even if the court or tribunal\n directs for consideration of representations\n\n relating to a stale claim or dead grievance it\n does not give rise to a fresh cause of action.\n\n The dead cause of action cannot rise like a\n phoenix. Similarly, a mere submission of\n representation to the competent authority\n does not arrest time.\n\n 23. \nIn \nState of T.N. v. Seshachalam\n, (2007) 10\n SCC 137, this Court, testing the equality\n clause on the bedrock of delay and laches\n pertaining to grant of service benefit, has\n ruled thus: (SCC p. 145, para 16)\n\n \"16. ... filing of representations alone\n would not save the period of limitation.\n Delay or laches is a relevant factor for a\n court of law to determine the question as\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 15\n\n to whether the claim made by an\n applicant deserves consideration.

This Court referring to an earlier judgment\n in \nP.S. Sadasivaswamy Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n,\n (1975) 1 SCC 152 noticed that a person aggrieved\n\n of\n by an order of promoting a junior over his head\n should approach the Court at least within six months\n or at the most a year of such promotion. In\n rt\n Paragraph No. 26 and 28, following was laid down:\n\n \n(\nShiv Charan Singh Bhandari\n case, SCC pp. 185-86)\n\n \"26.\n \nPresently, sitting in a time machine, we\n may refer to a two-Judge Bench decision\n in \nP.S.

For example, if the issue relates to\n payment or refixation of pay or pension, relief\n may be granted in spite of delay as it does not\n affect the rights of third parties. But if the claim\n involved issues relating to seniority or\n promotion, etc., affecting others, delay would\n\n .\n\n render the claim stale and doctrine of\n\n laches/limitation will be applied. Insofar as\n the consequential relief of recovery of arrears\n for a past period is concerned, the principles\n relating to recurring/successive wrongs will\n\n apply. As a consequence, the High Courts will\n restrict the consequential relief relating to\n arrears normally to a period of three years\n prior to the date of filing of the writ petition.\"\n\n of\n\n \n19. Close to the facts of this case, in \"\nC. Jacob v.\n Director of Geology and Mining\n\" (2008) 10 SCC\n 115, this Court, having found that the employee\n rt\n suddenly brought up a challenge to the order of\n\n termination of his services after 20 years and\n claimed all consequential benefits, held that the\n relief sought for was inadmissible. The legal\n\n position in this regard was laid out in the\n following terms:\n\n \"10. Every representation of the Government\n for relief, may not be applied on merits.\n Representations relating to matters which\n\n have become stale or barred by limitation, can\n be rejected on that ground alone, without\n examining the merits of the claim. In regard to\n\n representations unrelated to the Department,\n the reply may be only to inform that the matter\n did not concern the Department or to inform\n the appropriate Department. Representations\n with incomplete particulars may be replied by\n seeking relevant particulars. The replies to\n such representations, cannot furnish a fresh\n cause of action or revive a stale or dead claim.\n\n 11. When a decision is issued by a\n court/tribunal to consider or deal with the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 18\n\n representation, usually the directee (person\n directed) examines the matter on merits, being\n under the impression that failure to do so may\n amount to disobedience. When an order is\n passed considering and rejecting the claim or\n representation, in compliance with direction of\n\n .\n\n the court or tribunal, such an order does not\n\n revive the stale claim, nor amount to some\n kind of \"acknowledgement of a jural\n relationship\" to give rise to a fresh cause of\n action.\n\n 12. When a government abandons service to\n take alternative employment or to attend to\n personal affairs, and does not bother to send\n\n of\n any letter seeking leave or letter of resignation\n or letter of voluntary retirement, and the\n records do not show that he is treated as\n being in service, he cannot after two decades,\n represent that he should be taken back to\n rt\n duty. Nor can such employee be treated as\n having continued in service, thereby deeming\n the entire period as qualifying service for the\n\n purpose of pension. That will be a travesty of\n justice.\n\n 13. Where an employee unauthorisedly\n absents himself and suddenly appears\n\n after 20 years and demands that he\n should be taken back and approaches the\n court, the department naturally will not or\n\n may not have any record relating to the\n employee at that distance of time. In such\n cases, when the employer fails to produce\n\n the records of the enquiry and the order of\n dismissal/removal, court cannot draw an\n adverse inference against the employer for\n\n not producing records, nor direct\n reinstatement with back wages for 20\n years, ignoring the cessation of service or\n the lucrative alternative employment of the\n employee. Misplaced sympathy in such\n matters will encourage discipline, lead to\n unjust enrichment of the employee at fault\n and result in drain of public exchequer.\n Many a time there is also no application of\n mind as to the extent of financial burden,\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 19\n\n as a result of a routine order for back\n wages.\"\n\n 21. The aforesaid enunciation is clear and\n\n categoric. The belated representation on behalf of\n\n .\n\n petitioner No.1, that too, after about 12 years will not\n\n create a fresh cause of action in favour of the\n\n petitioners.\n\n of\n\n 22. It has been contended on behalf of the\n\n petitioners that the matters relating to seniority of\n rt\n Assistant Engineers (Civil) in the department of Public\n\n Works, were pending before this Court. It was in the\n\n year 2013 that review DPC was convened. It was\n\n thereafter that petitioner No.1 had submitted his\n\n representation. The explanation rendered on behalf of\n\n petitioners does not appeal to reason. Even if, litigation\n\n with respect to seniority of Assistant Engineers (Civil)\n\n was pending, it would not have been an impediment for\n\n the petitioners to have espoused their own cause, which\n\n primarily related to the right of consideration for\n\n promotion against the vacancies available under 'Old\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n\n 20\n\n Rules'. The seniority would have been an essential\n\n consequence only.\n\n .\n\n 23. Petitioners have also submitted that the\n\n respondent had recognised their right to be promoted\n\n w.e.f. 2002. Reliance has been placed on office notes\n\n dealing with the representation of the petitioner No.1\n\n of\n and others. I have gone through the contents of office\n\n notes as relied upon by the petitioners but in my\n rt\n considered view the petitioners still cannot succeed for\n\n the reasons firstly that there was no categoric admission\n\n and secondly office recommendation(s) cannot bind the\n\n employer more particularly when such\n\n recommendation(s) are against law.\n\n 24. In light of above discussion, there is no merit\n\n in the instant petition and the same is accordingly\n\n dismissed, so also the pending miscellaneous\n\n application(s) if any.\n\n (Satyen Vaidya)\n Judge\n 16th September, 2023\n (GR)\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS",
