There is a prior history of litigation also before the Indian Courts.\n\nRespondent No.1 on 27 July 2008, had approached this Court by filing\n\na petition under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, challenging the\n\nawards in question. This petition was filed after 90 days however\n\nwithin the extended period of 30 days as provided under\nSection 34(3)\n\nof the Arbitration Act. However as the said petition was filed beyond\n\nthe prescribed period of 90 days, a notice of motion was filed by\n\nrespondent No.1 seeking condonation of delay. The petitioner appeared\n\nas the respondent in the said petition, and opposed the said notice of\n\nmotion as filed by respondent No.1 as also opposed the\nSection 34\n\npetition. The petitioner contended that each of the foreign award(s)\n\nwas a separate award and even assuming that\nSection 34\nwas to apply,\n\nthe awards were required to be challenged within prescribed limitation\n\nas provided under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act. The petitioner in\n\nopposing the\nSection 34\npetition also contended that the respondent's\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n4 carbp 414-18\n\nSection 34\npetition was per se not maintainable as awards in question\n\nwere foreign awards.\n\n4. By an order dated 10 June 2013 this Court condoned the delay as\n\nalso held that it had jurisdiction to entertain\nSection 34\npetition filed by\n\nthe respondents. The petitioner being aggrieved by these orders\n\napproached the Supreme Court in a Special Leave Petition. By an\n\ninterim order dated 19 November 2013, the Supreme Court stayed the\n\nproceedings of the respondents\nSection 34\npetition pending before this\n\nCourt. The proceedings before the Supreme Court were decided finally\n\nby an order dated 10 March 2017 whereby the Supreme Court set aside\n\nthe orders passed by this Court, inter-alia holding that this Court had no\n\njurisdiction to entertain the\nSection 34\npetition challenging the foreign\n\nawards. It is thereafter that this petition under\nSection 47\n,\nand\nof\n\nthe Arbitration Act was filed by the petitioner on 2 April 2018 seeking\n\nenforcement and execution of the foreign award(s) in question.\n\n5. At the outset, an objection is raised on behalf of respondent No.1\n\nto the maintainability of this petition on the ground that the petition is\n\ntime barred considering the provisions of\nArticle 137\nunder the\n\nSchedule to the Limitation Act\n.\nArticle 137\nis a residuary article\n\nprescribing period of limitation to be 3 years. The title of the\nArticle\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\ncarbp 414-18\n\nreads as: 'any other application for which no period of limitation is\n\nprovided elsewhere in this division ' and time from which period begins\n\nto run is provided from when the right to apply accrues. Also\nArticle\nis relevant as contended to be applicable on behalf of the petitioner.\n\nIt would be appropriate to note the said\nArticles 136\nand\nwhich\n\nreads thus:-\n\nDescription of application Period of Time from which\nLimitation period begins to\nrun\n\n136. For the execution Twelve Years When the decree\nof any decree (other than a or order becomes\ndecree granting a enforceable or\nmandatory injunction) or where the decree\norder of any civil court. or any subsequent\norder directs any\npayment of money\nor the delivery of\nany property to be\nmade at a certain\ndate or at\nrecurring periods,\nwhen default in\nmaking the\npayment or deliver\nin respect of which\nexecution is\nsought, takes\nplace:\n\nProvided that an\napplication for the\nenforcement or\nexecution of a\ndecree granting a\nperpetual\ninjunction shall not\nbe subject to any\nperiod of\nlimitation.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n6 carbp 414-18\n\n137. Any other application Three years When the right to\nfor which no period of apply accrues.\n\nlimitation is provided\nelsewhere in this division.\n\n6. Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for respondent No.1 would contend\n\nthat the delay on the part of the petitioner is apparent to reach to a\n\nconclusion that this petition is barred by limitation, in as much as the\n\nimpugned foreign awards are dated 9 February 2006, 24 August 2007\n\nand 27 March 2008 and this petition has been filed on 2 April 2018. It\n\nis submitted that the scheme of provisions of\nSections 46\n,\n,\nand\nfalling under\nPart II of the Act\nis quite clear in as much as unless the\n\nawards are held to be enforceable by this Court in the proceedings of\n\nSections 47\nto\nof the ACA, the award would not be a decree\n\navailable for execution. The contention is that for the purposes of\n\nlimitation an application/proceedings filed for seeking enforcement of a\n\nforeign award as per requirement of\nSections 47\nto\nwould be an\n\napplication/proceeding falling under\nArticle 137 (supra)\nof the\n\nLimitation Act, 1963\n.\n\n7. Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for respondent No.1 would next\n\ncontend that the limitation, for the petitioners to assail the award,\n\nstarted running against the petitioner to file the present\nSection 47\nand\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n7 carbp 414-18\n\n49 proceedings, immediately after the awards were published. It is\n\nsubmitted that considering the dates of the award, it cannot be held\n\nthat a petition which was filed almost after about 10 years from the last\n\naward is within the prescribed period of limitation. Dr. Saraf in\n\nsupporting this contention would refer to the provisions of Sub-Section\n\n(3) of\nSection 48\nwhich according to him categorically provides that\n\neven if an application is made for setting aside or suspension of a\n\nforeign award before a competent authority as referred to in clause (e)\n\nof sub-section (1) of\nSection 48\n, the Court may, if it considers proper,\n\nadjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award and may also, on\n\nthe application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order\n\nthe other party to give suitable security. It is thus contended that, the\n\nlaw recognizes that even after proceedings are filed to challenge the\n\nforeign awards, there is no impediment for the decree holder to file\n\nproceedings for enforcement of the award.\n\n8. Dr. Saraf would submit that there is no application as filed on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner seeking condonation of delay. It is contended\n\nthat even assuming that the petitioner had wrongly approached this\n\nCourt by filing\nSection 34\nproceedings in the year 2008 and ultimately,\n\nthe issue came to be decided by the Supreme Court on 10 March 2017\n\nholding that the said proceedings filed by respondent No.1 under\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n8 carbp 414-18\n\nSection 34\nwere not maintainable, however, the pendency of these\n\nproceedings can in no manner save the limitation as prescribed under\n\nArticle 137\nto hold that the proceedings are within the prescribed\n\nlimitation. This according to Dr.Saraf, for the reason that, seeking\n\nenforcement of an award is governed by substantive provisions of\n\nSections 47\nto\nof the ACA and the party holding a foreign award\n\ncannot sleep over its enforcement/decreetal rights as arisen under the\n\naward and not seek enforcement of the award merely because there are\n\nproceedings filed by the award debtor assailing the awards even before\n\na Court not competent to entertain such proceedings. In this context,\n\nDr.Saraf would contend that one important facet which is required to be\n\nconsidered is the fact that although the\nSection 34\npetition was filed on\n\n27 July 2008 by respondent No.1 however till such time the delay on\n\nthe said petition was condoned as per provisions of Sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act on 10 June 2013, it was an obvious\n\nposition that there were no proceedings under\nSection 34\npending in\n\nthe eyes of law. It is contended that unless the delay was condoned it\n\ncould not have been presumed that a\nSection 34\npetition challenging\n\nthe award could be of any consequence. In other words, Dr.Saraf's\n\nsubmission is that the law would recognize the pendency of the\nSection\npetition filed by the respondents only after this Court condoned the\n\ndelay on the said petition, that is, when the Court passed an order on\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n9 carbp 414-18\n\nrespondent No.1's notice of motion on 10 June 2013 condoning the\n\ndelay. It is thus, submitted that for the period from 27 July 2008 (date\n\nof filing of the\nSection 34\npetition) till 10 June 2013 (date when delay\n\nwas condoned) the\nSection 34\npetition cannot be said to be on the file\n\nof the Court, to assume that filing of\nSection 34\npetition as per the pre-\n\namended (prior to amending Act No.3 of 2016 with effect from 23\n\nOctober 2015) was to operate as a stay on the execution of the award.\n\nIn supporting all these contentions Dr.Saraf has placed reliance on the\n\ndecisions of learned Single Judge in Noy Vallesina Engineering Spa v/s.\n\nJindal Drugs Limited1, M/s.Louis Dreyfus Commodities Suisse S.A., 29\n\nv/s. Sakuma Exports Limited2, Hameed Joharan (Dead) & Ors. vs.\n\nAbdul Salam (Dead) by LRs.\n&\nOrs.3, Assam Urban Water Supply and\n\nSewerage Board Vs. Subash Projects And Marketing Limited4\n.\n\n9. Per contra Dr.Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel for the\n\npetitioner would submit that the objection as urged on behalf of\n\nrespondent No.1 of the petition being time barred is not well founded.\n\nAt the outset Dr.Tulzapurkar would submit that the respondent's\n\ncontention of applicability of\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act\nis also not\n\ncorrect. This principally for the reason that the foreign award itself is\n\n1 2006 SCC ONLINE BOM 545\n2 2015 SCC OnLine Bom 5006\n3 (2001) 7 Supreme Court Cases 573\n4 (2012) 2 Supreme Court Cases 624\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n10 carbp 414-18\n\nrequired to be accepted as a decree and these proceedings as filed by\n\nthe petitioner under\nSections 47\nand\nof the Arbitration Act are\n\nrequired to be considered as proceedings for enforcement and execution\n\nof the foreign award. This according to Dr.Tulzapurkar is also clear\n\nfrom the prayers (supra) as made in the present petition.\n\nDr.Tulzapurkar would thus submit that it is not\nArticle 137\n, but\nArticle\nof the\nLimitation Act\nwhich would be applicable when it comes to\n\nenforcement and execution of a foreign award under the provisions of\n\nSections 47\nto\nof the ACA.\nArticle 136\nprovides inter-alia for\n\nexecution of any decree or order of any Civil Court, and prescribes a\n\nperiod of limitation of 12 years from the time when the decree or order\n\nbecomes enforceable.\n\n10. Dr.Tulzapurkar would submit that the statutory scheme qua the\n\nenforcement of a foreign award, falls in two stages. The first stage is\n\nrecognition of the award for enforcement and post recognition\n\nexecution of the award. It is submitted that thus enforcement and\n\nexecution in the context of\nSections 47\nto\nare synonymous.\n\nReferring to the decision of Supreme Court in\nThyssen Stahlunion\n\nGMBH Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd.5\n,\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.\n\nJindal Exports Ltd.6, Dr.Tulzapurkar\nwould contend that the Supreme\n5 (1999) 9 Supreme Court Cases 334\n6 (2001) 6 Supreme Court Cases 356\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n11 carbp 414-18\n\nCourt has categorically held that \" the foreign award is already stamped\n\nas a decree.\" According to Dr.Tulzapurkar, once a foreign award itself is\n\na decree and when the provisions of\nSections 47\nto\nlay down a\n\ncomposite scheme for enforcement and execution of a foreign award,\n\nfor the purposes of limitation, the provisions of\nArticle 136\nwhich\n\nprovide a limitation of 12 years from the date of receipt of the award,\n\nto file such proceedings, are clearly attracted. Dr.Tulzapurkar would\n\nsubmit that there can be no other reading of the statutory scheme of\n\nSections 47\nto\n, hence the present petition is within the prescribed\n\nperiod of limitation.\n\n11. The second limb of Dr.Tulzapurkar's submission is to contend that\n\neven assuming that the provisions of\nArticle 137\nare applicable, the\n\npetition is nevertheless within the prescribed limitation. This according\n\nto Dr.Tulzapurkar is for the reason that once the\nSection 34\npetition as\n\nfiled by respondent No.1 on 27 July 2008 albeit the notice of motion for\n\ncondonation of delay, which came to be allowed on 10 June 2013, the\n\npendency of such a petition, as the law stood prior to the Arbitration\n\nAmendment Act, 2015, itself acted as a stay on the enforcement of the\n\naward. This submission is being supported by contending that the order\n\npassed by this Court condoning the delay would relate back to the date\n\nof filing of\nsection 34\npetition. To make good this submissions,\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n12 carbp 414-18\n\nDr.Tulzapurkar has placed reliance on the decision of the Single Judge\n\nof Delhi High Court in\nDelhi Development Authority Vs. Amita Nand\n\nAgarwal7\n. It is next submitted that the interim order dated 19\n\nNovember 2013 passed by the Supreme Court in the petitioner's SLP\n\nmerely stayed the\nSection 34\nproceedings pending before this Court.\n\nThe effect of this order is not that the\nSection 34\nproceedings stood\n\nextinguished or were no more on the file of High Court, so as to\n\nconsider that there is no stay to the enforcement of the award as\n\nbrought about by pendency of\nSection 34\npetition as per the prevailing\n\nlaw. According to Dr.Tulzapurkar, this stay on the proceedings of the\n\nSection 34\npetition continued till 10 March 2017 when the Supreme\n\nCourt set aside the orders passed by the High Court holding that the\n\nSection 34\npetition as filed by the respondents was not maintainable.\n\nThus according to Dr.Tulzapurkar, the awards in question became\n\navailable for enforcement only after 10 March 2017 and therefore even\n\nif it is assumed that the provisions of\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act\n\nare to be applied, the present petition being filed on 2 April 2018 is\n\nrequired to be held as maintainable.\n\nIn supporting these contentions,\n\nDr.Tulzapurkar has placed reliance on various decisions namely in\nFiza\n\nDevelopers and Inter-Trade Private Limited Vs.

Bharat Salt\n\nRefineries Ltd. & Anr.13\n.\n\n12.\nIn rejoinder Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for respondent No.1 would\n\nsubmit that the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioner that the\n\nforeign award has a stamp of a decree is the observation of the Supreme\n\nCourt in\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n(supra) in a\n\ndifferent context. It is submitted that these observations of the\n\nSupreme Court are required to be read in the context of erstwhile\n\nArbitration Act (Arbitration Act\nof 1940) under which the Court was\n\ncalled upon to pass a decree in terms of the award and which is not the\n\nposition under the present\nArbitration Act\n. It is thus contended that\n\nnecessarily an application under\nSections 47\nto\nfor the purpose of\n\nlimitation would fall under\nArticle 137.\n\nDr.Saraf, learned Counsel for\n\nrespondent No.1 in supporting this submission would refer to the\n\ndecision in Noy Vallesina Engineering Spa v/s.\nJindal Drugs Limited\n\n(supra) and M/s.Louis Dreyfus Commodities Suisse S.A., 29 v/s.\n9 (1992) 3 Supreme Court Cases 1\n10 2003 C L C 877\n11 2002(2) Bom.C.R. 93\n\n12 O.S.A.

Dr.Saraf would next contend that\n\nArticles 136\nand\nprescribe the time from which period begins to\n\nrun, namely that in case of\nArticle 136\nwhen a decree and order\n\nbecomes enforceable and in case of\nArticle 137\nwhen the right to apply\n\naccrues. The Court's attention is drawn to\nArticles 116\n, 126\nand\nto\n\npoint out that these articles provide for the limitation to start running\n\nfrom the date of the decree or order. It is submitted if\nSection 49\nof the\n\nArbitration Act is considered, it clearly prescribes that only when the\n\nCourt holds that the foreign award is enforceable under the said\n\nchapter, the award shall be deemed to be decree of the Court and not\n\nbefore that. It is hence submitted that considering this clear position,\n\nArticle 136\nof the\nLimitation Act\nas contended on behalf of the\n\npetitioner even otherwise is not applicable.\n\n13. Having heard learned Counsel for the parties, the short question\n\nwhich has arisen for consideration at this stage of the proceeding is as\n\nto whether the present petition is filed within the prescribed limitation\n\nor the petition would be required to be held as time barred.\n\n14. Some admitted facts are required to be noted. The three awards\n\nas sought to be executed by the petitioner are the awards dated 9\n\nFebruary 2006, 24 August 2007 and the final award dated 27 March\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n15 carbp 414-18\n\n2008 of the ICC London. It is also not in dispute that the respondents\n\napproached this Court on 27 July 2008 by filing a petition under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act challenging these foreign awards. As\n\nthe\nSection 34\npetition was filed beyond the period of 90 days, however,\n\nwithin the extended period of 120 days, a delay condonation\n\napplication (Notice of Motion) No.2560 of 2008 was filed by the\n\nrespondents in the said petition. By an order dated 10 June 2013\n\npassed by this Court on the said application filed by the respondents,\n\nthis Court condoned the delay in filing\nSection 34\npetition as also it was\n\nheld that the\nSection 34\npetition although it assailed a foreign award(s)\n\nwas maintainable. The petitioner being aggrieved by the said orders\n\npassed by this Court, approached the Supreme Court in a Special Leave\n\nPetition. The Supreme Court by an order dated 19 November 2013\n\nstayed the proceedings of the\nSection 34\npetition. The Supreme Court\n\nfinally by an order dated 10 March 2017 set aside the orders passed by\n\nthis Court holding that this Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the\n\nSection 34\npetition. Thereafter on 2 April 2018 the petitioner filed the\n\npresent petition seeking enforcement and execution of the Award.\n\n15. The provisions of the\nArbitration Act\nwould be required to be\n\ngiven a broader meaning and the Court would not take a narrow\n\npedantic approach, more particularly considering the situation in hand\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n16 carbp 414-18\n\nwhen the petitioner has foreign awards in its favour, recognised by the\n\nforeign court and requiring enforcement and execution. The provisions\n\nof\nSections 47\nto\nare required to be applied in a meaningful manner\n\nwhich would not defeat the substantive and concluded arbitral\n\nproceedings between the parties. It is in this perspective, even the\n\nsubmission as urged on behalf of the respondents that the petitioner\n\nshould have filed a delay condonation application, praying for\n\ncondonation of delay in filing this petition for enforcement and\n\nexecution of the award would be required to be considered. This for\n\nmore than one reason. Indisputedly it was the respondents who brought\n\nabout a situation by approaching this Court by filing\nSection 34\n\nproceedings challenging the awards, although with a delay. This\n\nSection 34\npetition was filed on 27 July 2008. The delay was condoned\n\non 10 June 2013. Although there were already proceedings pending\n\nbefore this Court from July 2008 till 10 June 2013 when the delay\n\ncondonation was granted, in the facts of the case it cannot be said that\n\nthe awards were instantly available to the petitioner for enforcement\n\nand execution inasmuch as there was a situation brought about that\n\nthere were substantive proceedings challenging the award(s) were\n\npending before this Court. The fate of the award(s) itself was the\n\nsubject matter of consideration before this Court. The order dated 10\n\nJune 2013 condoning the delay would surely relate back to the date on\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n17 carbp 414-18\n\nwhich the petition was filed. Considering the provisions of the\n\nArbitration Act\nprior to its amendment by the 2015 Amendment Act\n\n(with effect from 23 October 2015), filing of the\nSection 34\npetition\n\namounted to stay of the award. The law in this regard is well settled.\nIn\n\nFiza Developers and Inter-Trade Private Limited Vs. AMCI (India)\n\nPrivate Limited & Anr.\n(supra) the Supreme Court held that until\n\ndisposal of the application under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, there\n\nis an implied prohibition on the enforcement of the arbitral award as\n\nthe very filing and pending of an application under\nSection 34\n, in effect\n\noperated as a stay on the enforcement of the award. The Court in\n\nparagraphs 19 and 20 held thus:-\n\n\"20.\nSection 36\nprovides that an award shall be enforced in\nthe same manner as if it were a decree of the court, but only\non the expiry of the time for making an application to set\naside the arbitral award under\nSection 34\n, or such application\nhaving been made, only after it has been refused.\n\n20. ..........Until the disposal of the application under\nSection\nof the Act, there is an implied prohibition of enforcement\nof the arbitral award. They very filing and pendency of an\napplication under\nSection 34\n, in effect, operates as a stay of\nthe enforcement of the award.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n16. The order dated 10 June 2013 passed by this Court condoning\n\ndelay in filing\nSection 34\npetition would be required to be taken\n\nrelating back to the day on which\nSection 34\npetition was filed that is it\n\nwould relate back to 27 July 2008.. In this context learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the petitioner would be correct in relying on the decision of\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n18 carbp 414-18\n\nthe learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in\nDelhi Development\n\nAuthority Vs.

In the present case, the objections were filed\nthough beyond 90 days but within the priod of 120 days and the\nobjections raised by the Registry were also removed within the\nperiod of two weeks.

Hence, the legal position as had arisen was that with effect from\n\n27 June 2008, the\nSection 34\npetition as filed by the respondents can be\n\nsaid to be pending. Thus even if the petitioners were to file a petition\n\nwithin three years after the awards, and before the delay was condoned\n\ni.e. upto 10 June 2013, nonetheless the petitioners were met with a fate\n\nof stay of the award(s), and the awards were thus not available for\n\nenforcement and execution.\n\n18. The orders passed by this Court dated 10 June 2013 condoning\n\nthe delay and holding that\nSection 34\npetition is maintainable came to\n\nbe challenged by the petitioner. By an order dated 19 November 2013\n\nthe Supreme Court granted stay to the proceedings of the\nSection 34\n\npetition and finally on 10 March 2017 the Supreme Court set aside the\n\norders passed by this Court holding that\nSection 34\npetition was not\n\nmaintainable before this Court, the award(s) being foreign award(s).\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n19 carbp 414-18\n\nThus, it is only after 10 March 2017 the award(s) became available to\n\nthe petitioner to be enforced. In my opinion, it is at this juncture, even\n\nif\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act\nas being pressed into service on\n\nbehalf of the respondents, is applied and a period of three years is to be\n\navailable to the petitioners to file an enforcement petition, this petition\n\nwhich was filed on 2 April 2018 would be required to be held to be filed\n\nwithin the limitation of three years as prescribed under\nArticle 137\n, as\n\nclear from the above facts. It would be required to be held that the\n\nsubstantive cause of action had arisen to the petitioner to file the\n\npresent petition only on 10 March 2017 when the Supreme Court set\n\nasides the order passed by this Court holding the\nSection 34\npetition to\n\nbe not maintainable.\n\n19. The respondents have contended that once a stay was granted by\n\nthe Supreme Court to the proceedings of the\nSection 34\npetition, it\n\nwould bring about a situation of the\nSection 34\npetition not being on\n\nthe file of this Court. This may not be a correct proposition for the\n\nrespondents to urge.\nIn this context and considering the facts of the\n\ncase, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would be correct in\n\nplacing reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in\nShree\n\nChamundi Mopeds Ltd. Vs. Church of South India Trust Association CSI\n\nCinod Secretariat, Madras\n(supra) to contend that the stay which was\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n20 carbp 414-18\n\ngranted by the Supreme Court on 19 November 2013 to the\n\nproceedings of\nSection 34\npetition would not have any effect on the\n\nSection 34\npetition to say that the same was not on the file of the Court\n\nor the\nSection 34\npetition in any manner had come to an end or that\n\nthere was no stay on the enforcement of the award. The Supreme Court\n\nin paragraph 10 of\nthe said decision\nhas observed thus:-\n\n\"... ... ... ... The said stay order of the High Court cannot have the\neffect of reviving the proceedings which had been disposed of by\nthe Appellate Authority by its order dated January 7, 1991. While\nconsidering the effect of an interim order staying the operation of\nthe order under challenge, a distinction has to be made between\nquashing of an order and stay of operation of an order Quashing\nof an order results in the restoration of the position as it stood on\nthe date of the passing of the order which has been quashed. The\nstay of operation of an order does not, however, lead to such a\nresult. It only means that the order which has been stayed would\nnot be operative from the date of the passing of the stay order and\nit does not mean that the said order has been wiped out from\nexistence.\"\n\n20. Apart from the above discussion now it is well settled that a\n\nforeign award is stamped as a decree and hence, as a decree it can be\n\nenforced and be executable in one and the same proceeding. In that\n\nevent\nArticle 136\nof the\nLimitation Act\nwould surely become applicable\n\nprescribing a limitation of twelve years from the date when award\n\nbecomes enforceable and/or the award directing payment of money as\n\nspecifically provided, under\nArticle 136.\nThis particularly, when the\n\nexecution of such award is held to be permissible in the same\n\nproceedings in two parts/stages. One on its enforcement and the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n21 carbp 414-18\n\nsecond part being the execution. The law in this context is required to\n\nbe noted.\n\n21.\nIn\nThyssen Stahlunion GMBH Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd.\n\n(supra) the issue which fell for consideration of the Supreme Court was\n\nin respect of the arbitral proceedings which commenced before the\n\nArbitration Act,1996\n(brought into force on 25 January 1996), and the\n\naward being delivered after the commencement of the\nArbitration Act\n\non 24 September 1997. The issue was whether the provisions of the\n\nArbitration Act,1940\nor\nArbitration Act,1996\nwould become applicable\n\nin regard to enforcement of the foreign award. It is in this context the\n\nCourt considered as to what is the nature of a foreign award. The\n\nSupreme Court while observing that there is not much difference\n\nbetween enforcement of the foreign award under the Old Act and the\n\nNew Act, held that the only difference is that while under the regime of\n\nArbitration Act,1940\nread with\nForeign Awards (Recognition and\n\nEnforcement) Act,1961\n, a decree follows, whereas under the\n\nArbitration Act, 1996\nthe foreign award is already stamped as a decree.\n\nIt would be appropriate to note the observations of the Supreme Court\n\nin paragraph 40 of the decision which reads thus:-\n\nAs a matter of fact if we examine the provisions of Foreign\nAwards Act and the new Act there is not much difference for the\nenforcement of the foreign award. Under the Foreign Awards\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n22 carbp 414-18\n\nAct when the court is satisfied that the foreign award is\nenforceable under that Act the court shall order the award to be\nfiled and shall proceed to pronounce judgment accordingly and\nupon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow.\nSections 7 and 8 of the Foreign Awards Act respectively\nprescribe the conditions for enforcement of a foreign award and\nthe evidence to be produced by the party applying for its\nenforcement. Definition of foreign award is same in both the\nenactments.\nSections 48\nand\nof the new Act correspond to\n\nSections 7\nand\nrespectively of the Foreign Awards Act. While\n\nSection 49\nof the new Act states that where the court is satisfied\nthat the foreign award is enforceable under this Chapter\n(Chapter I, Part II, relating to New York Convention Awards)\nthe award is deemed to be decree of that court. The only\ndifference, therefore, appears to be that while under the Foreign\nAwards Act a decree follows, under the new Act foreign award\nis already stamped as the decree. Thus if provisions of the\nForeign Awards Act and the new Act relating to enforcement of\nthe foreign award arc juxtaposed there would appear to be\nhardly any difference.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n22. The Supreme Court in\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports\n\nLtd.\n(supra) again commented on the nature of a foreign award prior to\n\nthe\nArbitration Act,1996\ncoming into force namely during the regime of\n\nthe erstwhile\nForeign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act,1961\n.\n\nThe Supreme Court again held that under the\nArbitration Act\n1996, the\n\nforeign award is already stamped as a decree and the party holding the\n\nforeign award can apply for enforcement of the award but the Court\n\nbefore taking further effective step for execution of the award is\n\nrequired to proceed under\nSections 47\nand\n. It is held that in one\n\nproceeding there may be different stages, the first stage being that the\n\nCourt would be required to decide enforceability of the award, having\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n23 carbp 414-18\n\nregard to the requirement of the said provisions and thereafter once it is\n\ndecided that the foreign award is enforceable, it is to proceed to take\n\nfurther effective steps for execution of such an award. There did not\n\narise question of making foreign award a rule of court/decree again. It\n\nis further observed that if the object and purpose of the provisions of\n\nSections 47\nto\nof the Arbitration Act can be served in the same\n\nproceedings, there is no need to take two separately proceedings\n\nresulting into multiplicity of litigation. The observations of the Supreme\n\nCourt in paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 are required to be noted which read\n\nthus:-\n\n\"30. Alternatively it was contended that a party holding a\nforeign award has to file a separate application and produce\nevidence as contemplated under\nSection 47\nand also satisfy the\nconditions laid down under\nSection 48\nand it is only after the\nCourt decides about the enforceability of the award, it should be\ndeemed to be a decree under\nSection 49\nas available for\nexecution. In other words, the party must separately apply\nbefore filing an application for execution of a foreign award. The\nArbitration and Conciliation Ordinance, 1996 was promulgated\nwith the object to consolidate and amend the law relating to\ndomestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and\nenforcement of foreign arbitral award and to define law relating\nto conciliation and for matters connected therewith or incidental\nthereto. In para 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons\ncontained in the Act, the main objects of the Bill are stated. To\nthe extent relevant for the immediate purpose, they are:\n\n\"i) to comprehensive cover international commercial arbitration\nand conciliation as also domestic arbitration and conciliation;\n\n(ii) --(iv) * * *\n\n(v) to minimize the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral\nprocess;\n\n(vi) * * *\n\nvii) to provide that every final arbitral award is enforced in the\nsame manner as if it were a decree of the court;\"\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n24 carbp 414-18\n\n31. Prior to the enforcement of the Act, the Law of\nArbitration in this country was substantially contained in three\nenactments namely, (1)\nThe Arbitration Act, 1940\n, (2)\nThe\nArbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937\nand (3)\nThe\nForeign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961\n. A\nparty holding a foreign award was required to take recourse to\nthese enactments. Preamble of the Act makes it abundantly clear\nthat it aims at to consolidate and amend Indian laws relating to\ndomestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and\nenforcement of foreign arbitral awards. The object of the Act is\nto minimize supervisory role of court and to give speedy justice.\nIn this view, the stage of approaching court for making award a\nrule of court as required in\nArbitration Act, 1940\nis dispensed\nwith in the present Act. If the argument of the respondent is\naccepted, one of the objects of the Act will be frustrated and\ndefeated. Under the old Act, after making award and prior to\nexecution, there was a procedure for filing and making an award\na rule of court i.e. a decree. Since the object of the act is to\nprovide speedy and alternative solution of the dispute, the same\nprocedure cannot be insisted under the new Act when it is\nadvisedly eliminated. If separate proceedings are to be taken,\none for deciding the enforceability of a foreign award and the\nother thereafter for execution, it would only contribute to\nprotracting the litigation and adding to the sufferings of a\nlitigant in terms of money, time and energy. Avoiding such\ndifficulties is one of the objects of the Act as can be gathered\nfrom the scheme of the Act and particularly looking to the\nprovisions contained in\nSections 46\nto\nin relation to\nenforcement of foreign award. In para 40 of the Thyssen\njudgment already extracted above, it is stated that as a matter of\nfact, there is not much difference between the provisions of the\n1961 Act and the Act in the matter of enforcement of foreign\naward. The only difference as found is that while under the\nForeign Award Act a decree follows, under the new Act the\nforeign award is already stamped as the decree. Thus, in our\nview, a party holding foreign award can apply for enforcement\nof it but the court before taking further effective steps for the\nexecution of the award has to proceed in accordance with\n\nSections 47\nto\n. In one proceeding there may be different\nstages. In the first stage the Court may have to decide about the\nenforceability of the award having regard to the requirement of\nthe said provisions. Once the court decides that foreign award is\nenforceable, it can proceed to take further effective steps for\nexecution of the same. There arises no question of making\nforeign award as a rule of court/decree again. If the object and\npurpose can be served in the same proceedings, in our view,\nthere is no need to take two separate proceedings resulting in\nmultiplicity of litigation. It is also clear from objectives\ncontained in para 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons,\n\nSections 47\nto\nand Scheme of the Act that every final arbitral\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n25 carbp 414-18\n\naward is to be enforced as if it were a decree of the court. The\nsubmission that the execution petition could not be permitted to\nconvert as an application under\nSection 47\nis technical and is of\nno consequence in the view we have taken. In our opinion, for\nenforcement of foreign award there is no need to take separate\nproceedings, one for deciding the enforceability of the award to\nmake rule of the court or decree and the other to take up\nexecution thereafter. In one proceeding, as already stated above,\nthe court enforcing a foreign award can deal with the entire\nmatter. Even otherwise, this procedure does not prejudice a\nparty in the light of what is stated in para 40 of the Thyssen\njudgment.\n\n32.\nPart II of the Act\nrelates to enforcement of certain foreign\nawards. Chapter 1 of this Part deals with New York Convention\nAwards.\nSection 46\nof the Act speaks as to when a foreign award\nis binding.\nSection 47\nstates as to what evidence the party\napplying for the enforcement of a foreign award should produce\nbefore the court.\nSection 48\nstates as to the conditions for\nenforcement of foreign awards. As per\nSection 49\n, if the Court is\nsatisfied that a foreign award is enforceable under this Chapter,\nthe award shall be deemed to be a decree of that court and that\ncourt has to proceed further to execute the foreign award as a\ndecree of that court. If the argument advanced on behalf of the\nrespondent is accepted, the very purpose of the Act in regard to\nspeedy and effective execution of foreign award will be\ndefeated. Thus none of the contentions urged on behalf of the\nrespondent merit acceptance so as to uphold the impugned\njudgment and order. We have no hesitation or impediment in\nconcluding that the impugned judgment and order cannot be\nsustained.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n23. Learned Single Judge of this Court in\nForce Shipping Ltd. Vs.\n\nAshapura Minechem Ltd.\n(supra) referring to the decision in\nFuerst Day\n\nLawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n(supra) observed that along with\n\napplication for enforcement it would be open to a party seeking\n\nenforcement of a foreign award to apply for execution in the form\n\nprescribed so that once the court proceeds to hold that the Award is\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::\n\n26 carbp 414-18\n\nenforceable, it can thereafter proceed to execute the decree without\n\nfurther procedural requirements.\n\n24. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has also referred to\n\nthe decision of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in\n\nM/s.Compania\nNaviera 'SODNOC' Vs. Bharat Refineries Ltd. & Anr.\n\n(supra) in which the court referring to the decision of the Supreme\n\nCourt in\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n(supra) rejected\n\nthe contention of the respondent that as the award was passed on 2\n\nMarch 2000 the petition to enforce the award should have been filed\n\nwithin three years and as the same being filed in the year 2005, the\n\nrelief was barred by limitation. It was held that the foreign award is\n\nalready stamped as a decree and the party having the foreign award can\n\nstraight away apply for enforcement of the foreign award, the party\n\nwould have 12 years time like that of a decreeholder to execute the\n\nforeign award. The Court in paragraphs 41 and 42 has made the\n\nfollowing observations:-\n\n\"41. The next objection of the learned Counsel for the 1st\nrespondent is that as the award was passed on 2.3.2000, the\npetition to enforce the award should have been filed within 3 years\nand as the same was filed only in 2005, the relief is barred by\nlimitation.\n\n42. I am unable to accept this submission also.\nUnder the Act,\n, the foreign award is already stamped as a decree and the\nparty, having a foreign award can straight away apply for\nenforcement of it and in such circumstances, the party having a\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n27 carbp 414-18\n\nforeign award has got 12 years time like that of a decree holder.\nTherefore it cannot be said that the present petition is barred by\nlimitation.\"\n\n25.\nIn another decision in M/s.Bharat Salt Refineries Ltd. Vs. M/s.\n\nCompania Naviera\n(supra) another learned Single Judge of the Madras\n\nHigh Court referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in\nFuerst Day\n\nLawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n(supra) rejected the contention that\n\nthe petition for enforcement should have been filed within three years\n\nfrom the date of the award. In paragraph 20 the Court held as under:-\n\n\"20. The contention of the appellant that as the award was made\non 2.3.2000, the petition for enforcement should have been filed\nwithin three years therefrom and the petition for enforcement filed\nin the year 2005 is hit by limitation is raised only for rejection.\nUnder the 1996 Act, the foreign award is stamped as a decree and\nthe party having a foreign award has got 12 years time like any\nother decree for its enforcement or execution. Hence the point of\nlimitation is also decided against the appellant, in the sense, the\npetition filed for enforcement is well within the period of\nlimitation. Our view is fortified by the ruling of the Apex Court in\nthe case of\nM/S FUERST DAY LAWSON LTD. VS. JINDAL EXPORTS\nLTD\n(AIR 2001 Supreme Court 2293), .............. ..........\"\n\n... .. ... ... .\n\nA reading of the above it is clear that once the Court decides that a\nforeign award is enforceable, it can proceed to take further\neffective steps for execution of the same and also the award shall\nbe deemed to be a decree of that Court.\n\n26. It is thus beyond a pale of doubt that enforcement and execution\n\ncan form part of the same proceedings. If this be so then certainly\n\nArticle 136\nunder the\nLimitation Act\nbecomes relevant. If the argument\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n28 carbp 414-18\n\nof non applicability of\nArticle 136\nas urged on behalf of the respondent\n\nis accepted, it would be contrary to the principle of law as\nlaid down by\n\nthe Supreme Court in\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n\n(supra) apart from deeply damaging the decreetal interest of the award\n\ncreditors apart from being contrary to the object of\nSection 47\nto\nof\n\nthe Arbitration Act.\n\n27.\nIn fact the above legal position now stands reinforced as seen\n\nfrom a recent decision of the Supreme Court in\nM/S.Shriram EPC Ltd.\n\nVs. Rioglass Solar SA14\n, the Supreme Court taking note of the decisions\n\nin\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n(\nsupra) and Thyssen\n\nStahlunion GMBH Vs.

The following observations of the\n\nSupreme Court in paragraph 19 read thus:-\n\n\"One sentence in\nFuerst Day Lawson\n(supra) reads, \"[T]he only\ndifference as found is that while under the Foreign Awards Act a\ndecree follows, under the new Act the foreign award is already\nstamped as the decree.\"\n\nThis sentence does not lead to the\n\n14 2018(6) Bom.C.R. 529\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n29 carbp 414-18\n\nconclusion, following the judgment in\nThyssen Stahlunion GMBH\nVs.

All\nthat this sentence means is that the foreign award is to be regarded\nas a decree. The expression \"stamped\" means \"regarded\". This\njudgment also does not carry us much further.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n28. Now coming to the contention as urged on behalf of the\n\nrespondents, the main thrust of the respondents' argument is the\n\ndecision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Noy Vallesina\n\nEngineering Spa v/s.\nJindal Drugs Limited\n(supra). In my opinion\n\nconsidering the facts of the present case and as noted above, that the\n\nSupreme Court on 10 March 2017 set aside the order passed by this\n\nCourt holding that the\nSection 34\npetition filed by the respondents was\n\nnot maintainable and the present proceedings being filed on 2 April\n\n2018, even by applicability of the provisions of\nArticle 137\nof the\n\nLimitation Act\n, the petition is not barred by limitation.\n\nIn any case,\n\napplying the princple of law as\nlaid down in\n\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.\n\nJindal Exports Ltd.\n(\nsupra) and M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass Solar\n\nSA\n(supra), the Court cannot overlook the prayers as made by the\n\npetitioner which are in the nature of a combined petition namely for\n\nenforcement and for execution of the award. As observed above a\n\nbroader view is required to be taken to advance the object and intention\n\nof the provisions of the\nArbitration Act\nand not a hard technical\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n30 carbp 414-18\n\napproach as urged by the respondents that the petition be held as time\n\nbarred, by applying\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act\nin the absence of a\n\ndelay condonation applicaton and the delay being condoned.\n\nThis\n\ncontention of the respondents militates against from what the Supreme\n\nCourt has now further clarified in\nM/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass\n\nSolar SA\n(supra)that when it was observed in\nFurest Day Lawson Ltd.\n\nVs. Jindal Exports Ltd\n(supra) that the Foreign award is already\n\nstamped as a decree, it means that \"the foreign award is to be regarded\n\nas a decree.\" In view of this clear position in law there is no manner of\n\ndoubt and more particularly as seen the prayers as made in the petition\n\nthat this petition cannot be held to be time barred, as contended on\n\nbehalf of the respondents.\n\n29.\nIn so far as the reliance on behalf of the respondents on the\n\ndecision in\nHameed Joharan (Dead) & Ors. vs. Abdul Salam (Dead) by\n\nLRs\n.\n& Ors.(supra), this decision may not assist the respondents when\n\nthe issue is of enforcement of a foreign award. The Supreme Court in\n\nthis decision has considered as to what would be the purport of the\n\nword \"enforce\" as used in\nArticle 136\nof the\nLimitation Act\n. The\n\nSupreme Court was considering the meaning of the word \"enforce\" as\n\nused in\nArticle 136\nof the\nLimitation Act\n.\nHowever, in the present facts\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n31 carbp 414-18\n\nconsidering that the award is a foreign award, the reliance on this\n\ndecision is not well founded, more particularly in view of the principles\n\nof law in regard to the enforceability of a foreign award as laid down in\n\nFurest Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n(\nsupra) and\n\nM/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass Solar SA\n(supra).\n\n30. The decision in\nAssam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Board\n\nVs. Subash Projects And Marketing Limited\n(supra) would also not\n\nassist the respondents, as the question which fell for determination of\n\nthe Court was as to whether the appellants were entitled to extension of\n\ntime under\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act,1963 and the context of the\n\nwords \"prescribed period\" as used in the said provision. It was held that\n\nSection 2(j)\nof the Limitation Act defines the period of limitation and\n\nwhen read in the context of\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act,1996,\n\nthe prescribed period for making an application for setting aside the\n\narbitral award was three months. It was held that the period of 30 days\n\nmentioned in the proviso that follows sub-section (3) of\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Arbitration Act is not the \"period of limitation\" and therefore, not\n\nthe 'prescribed period' for the purpose of making an application for\n\nsetting aside the arbitral award. It was held that the period of 30 days\n\nbeyond three months which the Court may extend on sufficient cause\n\nbeing shown under the proviso below sub-section (3) of\nSection 34\nof\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n32 carbp 414-18\n\nthe\nArbitration Act\nbeing not a period of limitation (prescribed period),\n\nand\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act would thus not be applicable. I\n\nwonder as to how this decision would at all is applicable in the present\n\nfacts.\n\n31. The decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in\n\nM/s.Louis Dreyfus Commodities Suisse S.A., 29 v/s. Sakuma Exports\n\nLimited (supra) would also not assist the respondents. This was a case\n\nwhere initially the execution application simplicitor came to be filed\n\nwithout filing of an enforcement petition.\nSubsequently, the\n\nenforcement petition was filed and the learned Judge referring to the\n\ndecision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Noy Vallesina\n\nEngineering Spa v/s.\nJindal Drugs Limited\n(supra) and the decision of\n\nthe Supreme Court in\nFurest Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.\n\n(supra) the Court held that the petition was not barred by limitation.\n\nLearned Judge in paragraphs 46, 48 and 49 has made the following\n\nobservations:-\n\n\"46. The Supreme Court in the case of M/s.\nFuerst Day Lawson Ltd.\n\n(supra) has held that there is no need to take two separate\nproceedings resulting in multiplicity of proceedings. It is also clear\nfrom objectives contained in the statement of objects and reasons\nthat in view of\nSection 47\nto\nand the scheme of\nArbitration Act\n,\nevery final arbitral award is to be enforced as if it were a decree of\nthe court. The Supreme Court held the submission that the\nexecution petition could not be permitted to convert as an\napplication under\nSection 47\nis technical and was of no\nconsequence in the view the Supreme Court had taken in the said\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n33 carbp 414-18\n\njudgment. It is held that in one proceedings, the court enforcing a\nforeign award can deal with the entire matter and that the\nprocedure does not prejudice a party. It is not in dispute that the\nsaid execution application filed by the petitioner was pending for\nquite some time. No objection was raised by the respondent by\nfiling reply.\n\n..... ..... ....\n\n48. In\nthe said judgment\n, this Court held that such an application\nfor enforcement of the foreign award would attract\nArticle 137\nand\naccording to that Article, the period of limitation is three years and\nwould commence from the date when right to apply occurs. This\nCourt has also observed that the least that could be said is that the\nquestion as to whether any period of limitation is prescribed for\nmaking an application for enforcement of the foreign award and if\nthere is period of limitation prescribed, what would be that period\nof limitation, was not a question free from doubt and this Court\naccordingly, condoned the delay filed by the petitioner. In my view,\nthe petitioner has filed the execution application which was within\nfour months from the date of the said foreign award and was\nprosecuting the same in good faith and with due diligence. The\nrespondent raised an objection about the maintainability of the\nsaid application for the first time before the Division Bench and not\nearlier. In my view, the petitioner has thus made out a case for\ncondonation of delay in filing the petition under\nSection 47\nof the\nArbitration Act. The judgment of this Court in case of Noy Vallesina\nEngineering Spa (supra) assist the case of the petitioner and not\nthe respondent.\n\n49. I am not inclined to accept the submission made by learned\nsenior counsel for the respondent that\nSection 14\nof the Limitation\nAct, 1963 would not be attracted to Arbitration Petition (No.47 of\n2015) filed by the petitioner. The petitioner filed the said\napplication based on the interpretation of the judgment of the\narbp47-15g Supreme Court in M/s.Fuerst\nDay Lawson Ltd.\n(supra)\nand the said proceedings were pending. The Division Bench of this\nCourt did not find the said execution application not maintainable\nbut on the contrary directed that if any application is filed under\n\nSection 47\nby the petitioner, the same shall be heard along with the\nsaid execution application. In my view, there is thus no substance\nin the submission of learned senior counsel that\nSection 14\nwould\nnot be applicable to the facts of this case. I am therefore of the\nview that the delay in filing the arbitration petition deserves to be\ncondoned. I shall now deal with the submissions made by both the\nleaned counsel on enforceability of the foreign award.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n32.\nIn fact the Court has recognized the clear applicability of the well\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::\n\n34 carbp 414-18\n\nsettled principle of law as\nlaid down in\n\nFurest Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.\n\nJindal Exports Ltd.\n(supra)\n\n33. As a sequel to the above discussion, the respondents objection\n\nthat the petition is required to be held as time barred, cannot be\n\naccepted. It is held that the present petition is filed within the\n\nprescribed limitation.\n\n[G.S. KULKARNI, J.]\n\n::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:20 :::",
