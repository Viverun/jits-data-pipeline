They volun-\ntarily appointed Panchas to determine the shares of the\nparties and to divide the property. The Panchas first\ndetermined the shares of the parties and reduced the\ndetermination to writing. It was accepted by the parties\nand was signed by all of them and the Panchas. Thereafter,\non various dates the Panchas divided several items of\nmovable and immovable properties and the parties entered\ninto possession of their shares. These divisions were duly\nentered in the \" partition books \" and were signed by the\nparties and the Panchas. The Panchas were unable to divide\nthe remaining properties and with the consent of the parties\nthey appointed one G to divide them. G divided some of the\nproperties but he too was unable to divide the remaining\nproperties. One of the parties served a notice cancelling\nthe authority of the Panchas and filed a suit for partition\nof the remaining properties. Upon an application made by\nthe plaintiff for revoking the reference the Trial Court\ncancelled the arbitration as one of the Panchas was\nunwilling to proceed with the division. Another party filed\na suit for partition of all the properties contending that\nthe division made by the Panchas was not binding as the\naward had not been made a rule of the court and the\nreference had been revoked and as the award was not\nregistered.\nHeld, that the divisions already made by the Panchas were\nbinding on the parties and only the remaining properties\nwere liable to be partitioned. By the reference to the\nPanchas, the\nparties ceased to be members of the joint Hindu family.\nThereafter, by the division of the family assets which was\naccepted by the parties and by the taking into possession of\ntheir shares by the parties, the properties came under the\nindividual ownerships of the parties to whom they were\nallotted; and in respect of the remaining properties they\nbecame tenants-in-common. The proceedings taken by the\nPanchas were not revoked by the order of the trial Court\nrevoking the reference as they had been accepted and acted\nupon by the parties. Where an award made in arbitration out\nof court is voluntarily accepted and acted upon by the\nparties and a suit is thereafter filed by one of the parties\nignoring the acts done in pursuance of the acceptance of the\naward, the defence that the suit is not maintainable is not\nfounded on the plea that there is an award which bars the\nsuit but that the parties have by mutual agreement settled\nthe dispute, and that the agreement and the subsequent\nactings of the parties are binding. Such a plea is not\nbarred by\ns. 32\nof the Arbitration Act. The records made by\nthe Panchas were documents which merely acknowledged\npartitions already made and were not required to be\nregistered.\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 218 to 223\nof 1959.\n\nAppeals from the Judgment and Decree dated August 9, 1953,\nof the Bombay High Court in Appeals Nos. 605 and 606 of 1952\nfrom Original Decrees.\n\nB....B.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered\nby\nSHAH, J.-These six appeals are filed with certificates under\n\nArt. 133\nof the Constitution granted by the High Court of\nJudicature at Bombay. The appeals arise out of the\njudgments and decrees in suits Nos. 47 of 1948 and 36 of\n1949 in the court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division,\nDharwar. The following- geneology set out in the plaint in\nSuit No. 47 of 1948 explains the relationship between the\nparties:\n\nDongarsa\n\n-------------|----------------------\n\n| |\nYamosa Ramakrishnasa\n| |\n| |\n------------- -----------\n| | | Hanmantsa\nKashinathsa Bhaskarsa Murarsa |\n(D 1) | (D 2) Bhimasa\n| (D 3)\n|\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n| | | |\nNarsingsa Pandurangsa Benakosa Hanmantsa\n(P 1) (P 2) (P 3) (P 4)\n\nThe principal contesting party in the suits was Kashinathsa,\neldest son of Yamosa, and he was the first defendant in both\nthe suits. For facility of reference, we propose to refer\nto the parties as they were arrayed in Suit No. 47 of 1948.\nBhimasa the plaintiff in Suit No. 36 of 1949 will,\ntherefore, be referred in this judgment as defendant No. 3.\nAt a partition in 1893 between Dongarsa's branch and the\nother branches, the former branch received property of the\naggregate value of Rs. 13,000/-. Members of that branch\nthereafter carried on business of weaving silk garments and\nalso of sale and purchase of silk garments. In 1912,\ndefendant No. 1 started a cloth shop in the name of\nKashinathsa Kabadi. In 1916, be started a commission agency\nbusiness in the name of H. R. Kabadi Shop, and in 1920 he\nstarted, business in money-lending and silk goods. Since\n1912, defendant No. 1 was the principal earning member of of\nthe family and was attending to the various lines of\nbusiness and he was assisted by the other members of the\nfamily. The family prospered and in course of time acquired\na large estate. Before 1946, Bhaskarsa father of the\nplaintiffs and Ramakrishnasa and\nHanmantsa grandfather and father respectively of defendant\nNo. 3 had expired, and the first defendant was the senio-\nrmost member of the family. In 1946, disputer, arose\nbetween the members of the family and defendant No. 3\ndeclined to continue in jointness with the other members of\nthe family and demanded that he be given his half share\nafter dividing the properties by metes and bounds. Claiming\nthat he alone was instrumental in amassing the vast estate\nwhich exceeded in value to Rs. 14,00,000/-, defendant I\nsubmitted that the estate be divided in four equal shares\nand that one share be given to him and the remaining shares\nto the heirs of Bhaskarsa, defendant No. 2 and defendant No.\n\n3. On August 17,1946, the disputes were referred under a\ndeed in writing to three persons Vithaldas Devidas\nVajreshwari a merchant of Betegiri, Devindrasa Tuljansa a\ncommon relation of the parties and Parappa Nagappa Jagalur a\nclerk of the pleader acting for the family-(whom we will\ncollectively refer as the Panchas) with authority to\ndetermine what shares should be allotted to the different\nbranches of the family and to determine the extra shares to\nbe given to defendant No. 1 for \" special exertions made by\nhim in acquiring the property \" and to divide the assets of\nthe money lending and other properties of the family_\nbusiness as the \" Panchas thought fit and proper.\" The\nPanchas accepted the reference and embarked initially upon\nan enquiry for ascertaining what shares in the family\nproperty should be allotted to the various contesting\nparties. On September 23, 1946, the Panchas decided that\neach of the four parties-defendant No. 1, defendant No. 2,\nthe plaintiffs collectively and defendant No. 3-should be\ngiven a fourth share in the properties of the family. This\ndecision was reduced to writing: it was signed by the\nPanchas and was accepted by the parties and in token of\nacceptance, they subscribed their signatures thereto. On\nthe same day, gold ornaments of the value of Rs. 67,000/-\n\nwere divided by the Panchas in four equal shares. A record\nthereof was made in the proceedings of the Panchas.\nThe Panchas then proceeded to award to each of the parties\ngold ornaments weighing 167 tolas 15 as. and silver 481\ntolas and 4 as. On September 24, 1946, it is the case of\ndefendant No. 1 that the Panchas decided to give him an\nadditional share of the value of Rs. 40,000/- out of the\nproperty for bringing the family \" to the present prosperous\nconditions \" and the Panchas directed that defendant No. 2\nshould for that purpose pay out of his share Rs. 30,000/- to\ndefendant No. 1 and the plaintiffs should pay Rs. 10,000/-\nto him and the old house of the joint family be allotted to\nhim as his exclusive property. This was denied by the other\nparties. On October 12, 1946, the Panchas divided the\nresidential houses and a record of this division was entered\nin five separate books hereinafter referred to as \"partition\nbooks.\" In each of the \" partition books the Panchas\nsubscribed their signatures under the record of the division\nand allotment of the shares and the parties also signed\nunderneath the same in token of acceptance of that division.\nOn October 19, 1946, the Panchas divided an amount of Rs.\n64,000/- entries regarding which had been posted in the\nfamily books of account. Each party was given Rs. 16,000/-\nand this division was entered in the account books of Yamosa\nDongarsa Kabadi and the entry was duly signed in token of\nacknowledgment of the correctness by all the parties. It is\nthe case of defendant No. 1 that on that day another amount\nof Rs. 3,20,000/. which was \" the unaccounted cash lying in\nthe safe of the family but which was not entered in the\nbooks of account and details whereof were set out in a\nTippan Book,\" was also divided and each party was given Rs.\n80,000/-. of the two major contentions in this group of\nappeals, one has centered round the truth of the story about\nthe division of this amount. 1 On October 20, 1946, the \"\n\nfour empty safes \" and the warehouses and lands at Betgiri\nwere divided. On October 21, 1946, the stock-in-trade of\nthe silk shop was divided in four equal shares and on\nNovember 10, 1946, miscellaneous gold and pearl ornaments\nand the houses at Gadag and plots of land in the Hubli\nCotton Market were similarly divided, On February 7, 1947,\nthe agricultural lands, cattle and agricultural implements\nwere divided. On February 22,1947, Rs. 24,000/as the\naccumulated cash on hand in the money lending business were\ndivided into four equal shares. Divisions made on October\n20, 1946, October 21, 1946, February 7 and February 22,\n1947, were duly entered in the \" partition books \" and the\nentries were signed by the Panchas and were also by the\nparties in acknowledgment of the correctness of the\ndivisions. On February 24, 1947, acknowledgments were\nobtained from the junior members of the family to the\nreference to the Panchas and to the decision of the Panchas\ndated September 23, 1946, whereby each branch was given a\nfour annas share and also to the subsequent divisions made\nfrom time to time between September 23, 1946, and February\n24, 1947. Between February 25, 1947, and April 10, 1947,\ncotton bales belonging to the family of the value of Rs.\n3,20,000/were divided into four equal shares. The record of\nthis division was not signed by the parties. After the\nfurniture and utensils of the family were divided, there\nsurvived certain disputes about the outstandings of the\nfamily and other properties especially a dispute about Rs.\n16,000/- lying in cash with the family which could not be\ndecided. To resolve the disputes about these properties and\nthe outstandings of the family, the Panchas, with the\nconsent of the parties referred them for decision to one\nBhim Rao Godkhindi, a senior pleader of the Gadag Bar. On\nNovember 3, 1947, the Panchas executed a writing in favour\nof Godkhindi authorising him to complete the work of\npartition of the estate. Godkhindi accepted the authority.\nOn December 5, 1947, Godkhindi asked the parties to \"state\nclearly \" what according to them were the properties which\nremained to be partitioned, and the plaintiffs gave a list\nto Godkhindi of such properties. Between February 5 and\nFebruary 9, 1948, outstandings of the value of Rs.\n1,20,000/- were divided by Godkhindi and this was accepted\nby the parties. But Godkhindi was unable to proceed with\nthe division of the remaining assets. On February 9, 1948,\nthe first plaintiff served a notice canceling the authority\nof the Panchas to\ndivide the properties of the family and on August 19, 1948,\nhe filed Suit No. 47 of 1948 in the court of the Civil\nJudge, Senior Division, Dharwar, for partition of the\nproperties remaining to be divided and for accounts of the\njoint family properties. By his plaint, the plaintiffs\nadmitted that the parties had agreed to divide the property\ninto four equal shares. in para. 6 of their plaint, they set\nout the properties which they alleged had not been divided.\nThe plaintiffs claimed that they be awarded a fourth share\nin the outstandings of the assets of \" Kashinathsa Yamosa\nKabadi \" and \" H. R. Kabadi \" shops, and in \" a considerable\namount of money that has been there\" since the time of the\nancestors the Tippan in respect of which it was alleged was\nwith defendants Nos. 1 and 2 and in certain gold and silver\narticles, and lands and houses and rents which were\nrecovered. On August 19, 1948, the plaintiffs also filed a\npetition in the court of the Civil Judge for leave to revoke\nthe authority of the Panchas. Notice of this petition was\nserved upon the Panchas, and the Panchas having expressed\nunwillingness to function the court passed an order\ncancelling their authority.\n\nThereafter defendant No. 3 filed Suit No. 36 of 1949 on\nAugust 16, 1949, for partition and separate possession of a\nhalf share in all the properties of the joint family. By\nhis plaint, he claimed that he \" had been told \" that\ndespite the decision of the Panchas dated September 23,\n1946, he will be given a half share in the properties, that\nhis consent to the divisions made by the Panchas was\nobtained by misrepresentation and that the Panchas were\nguilty of partiality and therefore their decisions were not\nbinding on him. He averred that it was not possible for him\nto give the descriptions of the properties other than those\ndescribed in the plaint and of all the movables belonging to\nthe family and the money lending dealings, he claimed a\ndeclaration that the authority given to the Panchas had been\nrevoked and for a decree for partition and separate\npossession of a half share in the property which may be\nproved to belong to the joint family.\nIn both the suits, defendant No. 1 contended that the\nPanchas had divided the properties in four equal shares\nafter their decision to divide the same in that manner was\naccepted, that the Panchas from time to time had made actual\ndivision of the properties with the consent of the parties,\nthat the division of the properties in each case was acted\nupon and properties allotted to the parties were reduced\ninto possession by the parties to whom they were allotted,\nand that on that account the division could not be reopened.\nHe also contended that the \" unaccounted cash \" had been\ndivided on October 19, 1946, and each party was given his\nshare therein, and that the Panchas had given to him an\nextra share of the value of Rs. 40,000/- in cash payable by\nthe plaintiffs and defendant No. 2 and the residential\nfamily house at Betgiri. Defendant No. 2 supported the\nclaim made by the plaintiffs.\n\nThe Civil Judge held that by virtue of the order passed in\nthe petition for revoking the reference to the Panchas their\nauthority as well as the proceedings and all the decisions\ngiven by them ceased to bind the parties because \" the\ndecisions stood cancelled.\" He also held that the decisions\nwere not binding upon the parties as they were not filed in\ncourt; that the Panchas were not proved to have awarded to\ndefendant No. 1 any additional share in the property of the\nfamily; and that the ,unaccounted cash\" of the family which\namounted to Rs. 3,20,000/- was not divided. He accordingly\npassed decrees in the two suits ordering that a fresh\npartition be effected of all the joint family property\nmoveable and immoveable.\n\nAgainst the decrees passed by the court of first instance\ndefendant No. 1 preferred Appeal No. 605 of 1952, against\nthe decree in Suit No. 47 of 1958 and Appeal No. 606 of\n1952, against the decree in Suit No. 36 of 1949. In the two\nappeals, the High Court at Bombay by a common judgment\nmodified the decrees passed by the court of first instance.\nIn the view of the High Court, there were in law no valid\nawards made by the Panchas which could be set up in defence\nby defendant No. 1 to the claim made by the third defendant.\nThey observed that the awards of the\nPanchas were not binding because they were not properly\nstamped and those that affected immoveable properties were\nnot registered. But the High Court held that the division\nof the moveables such as gold and silver ornaments made on\nSeptember 23, 1946, could not be reopened. They further\nheld that the \" unaccounted cash \" amounting to Rs.\n3,20,000/- was divided on October 19, 1946, and that each\nbranch had received Rs. 80,000/-. The High Court\naccordingly modified the decree passed by the trial court in\nso far as it related to the gold and silver ornaments\ndivided by the Panchas on September 23, 1946, and also in\nrespect of the amount of the unaccounted cash of Rs.\n3,20,000/-. There were certain other modifications made in\nthe decrees which are not material for the purposes of these\nappeals, as no arguments have been advanced at the bar\nrelating thereto.\n\nIn these appeals by defendant No. 1, the plaintiffs and\ndefendant No. 3, two principal questions fall to be\ndetermined: (1) whether defendant No. 3 is entitled to a\nhalf share in all the properties of the joint family\nignoring the division already made and (2) whether the\nunaccounted cash which was estimated by defendant No. 3 and\nthe plaintiffs at Rs. 4,00,000/- and which was stated by\ndefendant No. 1 to be Rs. 3,20,000/was divided on October\n19, 1946. On these two questions, the parties are\ndifferently arrived. On the first question, defendant No. 1\nis supported by the plaintiffs and defendant No. 2. On the\nsecond question, defendant No. 1 is opposed by the\nplaintiffs and defendants Nos. 2 and 3.\n\nAfter setting out the contentions of the parties, it is\nrecited in the deed of reference that the parties had given\nauthority to the Panchas to peruse the written and oral\nevidence and to decide what shares shall be allotted to the\ndifferent branches and also to decide what may appear to be\nproper for providing an \"extra share\" to defendant No. 1.\nThe agreement between the members of the joint Hindu family\nto appoint Panchas for dividing the family properties\namounts to severance of the joint family status from the\ndate of the agreement. Once reference is made, joint family\nstatus is severed and it is not postponed until the division\nof the property by metes and bounds.\n\nTo appreciate the contentions, it is necessary to follow the\nmethod adopted by the Panchas in dividing the properties.\nThe decision of the Panchas to allot to each branch a fourth\nshare was accepted by all the parties. Thereafter the\nPanchas proceeded to allot shares in the properties movable\nand immovable. The distribution of the properties was set\nout in writing and in acknowledgment of the fact that\ndistribution was made as described the parties signed the\nwriting:\n\n\" We have appointed these as the Panchas. In\naccordance therewith all the Panchas heard all\nthe information (placed below them) and all\nthe Panchas unanimously decided on 23-9-1946\nthat Kashinathsa Yamosa Kabadi should be given\na 1/4 share, that Narasingsa Bhaskarsa Kabadi\nshould be given a 1/4 share, and that Bhimasa\nHanumantasa Kabadi should be given a I share,\nand we all having consented to the said\ndecision of the Panchas, we all and all the\nPanchas have put our respective signatures to\nthe said decision of the Panchas. The details\nof the properties that have fallen to the\nshares of the different shares as per the\ndecision effected in accordance with the said\ndecision are as follows:\"\n\nThis acknowledgment was not merely an agreement not to\nchallenge the decision of the Panchas, but was made as\nevidencing the division actually made and reduced to\nwriting. The trial court found that the properties\nseparately allotted to the various branches were reduced\ninto possession by the parties and the High Court agreed\nwith that view. If the consent of the parties was not\nprocured by fraud, misrepresentation or any other ground\nwhich may vitiate a partition under the general law, the\ndivision made by the Panchas and accepted by the parties\nwould be binding upon them. It is always open to the\nmembers of a joint Hindu family to divide some properties of\nthe family and to keep the remaining undivided. By the\nreference to the Panchas, the parties ceased, to be members\nof the joint Hindu family. If thereafter the\nassets of the family were divided and that division was\naccepted by the parties, the properties reduced by the\nparties to their possession must be deemed to be of the\nindividual ownership of the parties to whom they were\nallotted, and the remaining properties as of their tenancy-\nin-common. Evidently in this case, the Panchas suggested\nwhat they regarded as a just and -convenient method of\npartition and that method was accepted by the parties.\nOriginally it was intended to make a general division or\naward in respect of all the properties and with that end in\nview a stamp paper of the value of Rs. 30/- was purchased.\nBut in the course of the proceedings, effectuating a\ndivision of all the properties by a single award was\napparently found inconvenient and a convenient method was\nadopted and the properties were divided by stages. In the\nfirst instance, the principle of division was discussed and\ndecided upon and that principle was accepted by the parties.\nThereafter the properties were divided in different\nsections.\n\nThe plea raised in his plaint by defendant No. 3 that his\nconsent to the reference was obtained by coercion and undue\ninfluence is somewhat vague and indefinite. He merely\nstated that he had recently attained the age of majority,\nthat defendant No. I was the head of the family and that he\nwas not in a position ',either to say anything against him\n(defendant No. 1) or to act against him.\" He also stated\nthat defendant No. I had threatened him that he (defendant\nNo. 3) would be given a share only if he acted according to\nthe behest of defendant No. 1 otherwise he would be driven\nout of the house without anything and therefore he \" became\nhelpless \" and agreed to sign the \" letter of authority\npassed in favour of the Panchas.\" He pleaded in para. 5 of\nthe plaint that he had not agreed to take a more fourth\nshare and that he \" had all along been insisting upon\nreceiving a half share,\" and that it was his intention to\ntake his legitimate half share \" without dispute if that\ncould be managed \" and as he believed that he would be given\nthat share he did not immediately raise any objections He\nalso stated that hill had been promised\nby defendant No. 1 that he would be given his share in the\nproperty. The learned trial judge rejected this plea\nholding that Defendant No. 3 failed to prove that he was \"\n\ncompelled by exercise of undue influence and coercion to\nagree to the reference to the Panchas, and that he had been\npromised by defendant No. I that he would be given a half\nshare.\" In the High Court, the plea raised by defendant No.\n3 about coercion and undue influence and the promise made by\ndefendant No. I does not appear to have been seriously\npressed. The plea of defendant No. 3 that he subscribed his\nsignatures to the various decisions given by the Panchas\nfrom time to time because he believed that he was bound by\nthe decision dated September 23,'1946, and that but for such\nbelief he would not have subscribed his signatures to those\ndecisions has in our judgment no force. Defendant No. 3, it\nappears on the evidence, voluntarily accepted the decision\nthat each branch was to be given a fourth share and he\naccepted the division of the properties allotted to him on\nthat footing.\n\nAgain by virtue of the order passed by the Civil Judge\ncancelling the reference, the proceedings taken by the\nPanchas including the division of the property which had\nbeen accepted were not revoked. The plaintiffs filed Misc.\nApplication No. 15 of 1948 for an order revoking the\nreference and as the Panch Devendrasa was found unwilling to\nproceed with the work of dividing the property, the\narbitration was cancelled. Under\ns. 12\n, sub-s. (2) of the\n\nArbitration Act\n, where the authority of an arbitrator or\narbitrators is revoked by leave of the court, the court may\norder that the arbitration agreement shall cease to have\neffect with respect to the difference referred. If the\ndecisions of the Panchas had not been accepted by the\nparties with the revocation of the reference, all\nproceedings which they had adopted might have fallen\nthrough; but the parties did accept the decisions made from\ntime to time and the cancellation of the reference had not\nthe effect of vacating the divisions already made. We are\nunable to agree with the view of the trial judge that the\ncancellation had the effect of\nnullifying all the interim divisions and that they must be\ndeemed to have been impliedly set aside.\n\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether these decisions may\nbe regarded as \" interim awards \" within the meaning of s.\n27 of the\nArbitration Act\n. The decisions given and\ndivisions made were not merely tentative arrangements liable\nto be superseded at a later stage. The decisions were\ntreated as final and were carried out. We agree with the\nHigh Court that whatever may be the original intention of\nthe parties, the Panchas having with the consent of the\nparties proceeded to divide the properties in stages, each\ndecision must be regarded as final with regard to the\nproperty divided thereby.\n\nWe are of the view that it was open to defendant No. I to\nset up the division of the properties made from time to time\nas a defence to the action filed by defendant No. 3. Even\nassuming that the records of the divisions made by the\nPanchas are awards strictly so called, what is set up in\ndefence is not the awards made by the Panchas, but the\npartition of the property by agreement after accepting the\nmethod of partition suggested by the Panchas. To such a\nplea, there is in our judgment no bar of s. 32 of the\n\nArbitration Act\n. By\ns. 32\nit is provided:\n\n\" Notwithstanding any law for the time being\nin force, no suit shall lie on any ground\nwhatsoever for a decision upon the existence,\neffect or validity of an arbitration agreement\nor award nor shall any arbitration agreement\nor award be set aside, amended, modified or in\nany way affected otherwise than as provided in\nthis Act. \"\n\nBefore the Arbitration Act, 1940\n, was enacted, an award made\nby arbitrators appointed out of court even if it was -not\nmade a rule of the court was regarded as equivalent to a\nfinal judgment and any suit filed on the original cause of\naction referred to the arbitrators was held barred.\n\nIn\nMuhammad Nawaz Khan v. Alam Khan\nit was held by the\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council that an award is\nvalid even if no party has sought to enforce it by the\nsummary procedure,\n(1) (1891) L.R. 18 I.A. 73.\nSince the enactment of the\nArbitration Act, 1940\n,, there has\n&risen wide divergence of judicial opinion among the High\nCourts on the question whether an award made in a reference\nout of court can be set up as a defence to an action filed\nby a party thereof on, the original cause of action when the\naward is not filed in court.\nSection 31\n, sub-s. (2) of the\n\nArbitration Act\nprovides:\n\n\" Notwithstanding anything contained in any\nother law for the time being, in force and\nsave as otherwise provided in this Act, all\nquestions regarding the validity, effect or\nexistence of an award or an arbitration\nagreement between the parties to the agreement\nor persons claiming under them shall be\ndecided by the Court in which the award under\nthe agreement has been, or may be, filed and\nby no other court \"\n\nand s. 33 sets out the procedure to be followed for\nchallenging the existence, effect or validity of an\narbitration agreement or an award or to have its effect\ndetermined. It is manifest that questions relating to the\nvalidity, effect or existence of an award can be decided by\nthe court to which an application making it a rule of court\nlies.\n\nIn Babui S. K. Kuer v. B. N. Sinha (1), the Patna High Court\nheld that by virtue of\ns. 32\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940,\nan award made on a private reference to arbitration is not\noperative of its own force; it only becomes operative on\nbeing made a rule of the court. It was held in that case\nthat an award cannot be set up as a defence to an action\nunless it is filed in court and a decree is obtained\nthereon.\nSimilar view was taken in\nSait Pamandass v. T. S.\nManikyam Pillai Bhimavarapu Venkatasubbauva\nv. Addanki\nBapadu and Firm Gulzarimal Gheesdal v. Firm Rameshrhandra\nRadhyeshyam (4).\n\nOn the other hand, in\nPamudurthi\nSuryanarayana Reddy v. Pamudurthi Venkata Reddi\n(1), it was\nheld that\nss. 32\nand\nof the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940,\ndid not preclude a defendant from\n(1) (1952) l.L.R. 31 Pat. 886.\n\n(2) A.I.R. 1960 And. Pra. 59.\n\n(3) A.I.R. 1951 Mad. 458.\n\n(4) I.L.R. [1959] Raj. 515.\n\n(5) I.L.R. [1949] Mad. 11.\nsetting forth an award which had been fully performed by him\nbut which was not filed in Court under\ns. 14\nand on which a\njudgment was not pronounced or a decree given under\ns. 17\nof\nthe Act, in answer to the plaintiff's claim which was the\nsubject matter of the reference and the award. That view\nwas accepted in\nRajamanickam Pillai v. Swaminatha Pillai\n\n(died) (,). It is not necessary in this appeal to express a\nconsidered opinion on this disputed question. It may be\nsufficient to observe that where an award made in\narbitration out of court is accepted by the parties and it\nis acted upon voluntarily and a suit is thereafter sought to\nbe filed by one of the parties ignoring the acts done in\npursuance of the acceptance of the award, the defence that\nthe suit is not maintainable is not founded on the plea that\nthere is an award which bars the suit but that the parties\nhave by mutual agreement settled the dispute, and that the\nagreement and the subsequent actings of the parties are\nbinding. By setting up a defence in the present case that\nthere has been a division of the property and the parties\nhave entered into possession of the properties allotted,\ndefendant No. I is not seeking to obtain a decision upon the\nexistence, effect or validity of an award. He is merely\nseeking to setup a plea that the property was divided by\nconsent of parties. Such a plea is in our judgment not\nprecluded by anything contained in the\nArbitration Act\n.\nThe records made by the Panchas about the division of the\nproperties, it is true, were not stamped nor were they\nregistered. It is however clear that if the record made by\nthe Panchas in so far as it deals with immoveable properties\nis regarded as a non-testamentary instrument purporting or\noperating to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish\nany right, title or interest in immoveable property, it was\ncompulsorily registrable under\ns. 17\nof the Registration\nAct, and would not in the absence of registration be\nadmissible in evidence. But in our judgment, the true\neffect of what are called awards is not by their own force\nto create any. interest in immoveable property they recorded\n(1) A.I.R. 1952 Mad. 24.\ndivisions already made and on the facts proved in this case,\ntheir validity depends upon the acceptance by the parties.\nThe records made by the Panchas were documents which merely\nacknowledged partitions already made and were not by law\nrequired to be registered. On a perusal of Ex. 456A which\nis a translation of the tippan book in which are recorded\nthe decisions which are signed by the parties, it is evident\nthat the Panchas were merely recording what had been\nactually divided and they were not seeking to set out their\ndecisions relating to division of property to be made. The\nquestion whether the various decisions recorded in Ex. 456A\nand in the, books of account were required by law to be\nstamped need not be decided. The documents were admitted in\nevidence by the trial court and no question of admissibility\nof those documents can be raised at a later stage of the\nsuit or in appeal (see\ns. 36\n, Stamp Act).\n\nWe are unable to agree with the view of the High Court that\nthe decisions dated October 12, 1946, October 20,1946, and\nNovember 10, 1946, were not intended to be final decisions.\nThere is no reliable evidence to support the view of the\nHigh Court. Even if the divisions are not strictly in\nconformity with the shares declared in the decision dated\nSeptember 23, 1946, the parties having accepted those\ndivisions and having reduced the shares allotted to their\npossession, it is not open to them to seek to reopen the\nsame on the ground that the division was unequal.\nDefendant No. 3 contended in the trial courts and the High\nCourt that he had not taken possession, of the property\nallotted to his share. The trial court held that he had\ntaken possession of all the properties which had fallen to\nhis share and the plea that he has not obtained possession\nwas untrue. The High Court has accepted that view.\nTo sum up: on a consideration of the materials placed before\nthe court, the reference to Panchas is proved to be made\nvoluntarily by all the parties, that the Panchas had in the\nfirst instance decided that each branch was to get a fourth\nshare in the properties and that decision was accepted by\nthe parties, that division\nof properties made from time to time was also accepted by\nthe parties, and subsequently, when the Panchas were unable\nto proceed with the division, the matter was referred by\nconsent of the parties to Godkhindi and Godkhindi divided\nwith the consent of the parties the outstandings. but he was\nunable to divide the remaining properties. For reasons we\nhave already stated, the division made by the Panchas and by\nGodkhindi is binding upon the parties. Such properties as\nare not partitioned must of course be ordered to be divided\nand the division will be made consistently with the rules of\nHindu law. To the division of such properties which have\nnot been divided, the decision of the Panchas dated\nSeptember 23, 1946, will not apply.\n\nWe may now turn to the second question whether on October\n19, 1946, the amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- which was the \"\n\nunaccounted cash with the family \" was partitioned. It was\nthe plea of defendant No. I that on that day after dividing\nthe amount of Rs. 64,000/- the \" unaccounted cash \" which\nwas found to be Rs. 3,20,000/- was actually divided and each\nbranch was given Rs. 80,000/-. Defendant No. 1 relied upon\nhis own testimony besides the testimony of Parappa (one of\nthe Panchas) and of Huchappa---clerk of the family shop.\nDefendant No. 3 examined the other Panch Devendrasa.\nThe trial court held that the testimony of Huchappa and\nParappa was unreliable. Defendant No. 1 did admit that the\nfamily possessed Rs. 3,20,000/- as \" unaccounted cash \"; and\nthe burden of proving that division was in fact made lay on\nhim. The trial court observed that there was no writing\nevidencing the division of Rs. 3,20,000/-, no receipt was\ntaken from any person for payment of a share in that amount,\nand that it was highly improbable that a person like\ndefendant No. 1 would part with substantial amounts without\ntaking receipts.\n\nThe High Court disagreed with this view., They pointed out\nthat there was no entry made in the books of account of this\nlarge amount of cash, and apprehending that a division of\nthe property with a\nformal record which may ultimately be produced in court\nwas likely to involve the members of the family in\nproceedings for concealment of income, no record was\nmaintained of the division thereof. The High Court also\nrelied upon the testimony of Parappa, Huchappa and defendant\nNo. 1 and upon the circumstance that neither in the\nplaintiffs' plaint nor in the plaint of defendant No. 3 was\nany specific reference made to the refusal of defendant No.\n1 to divide this amount. In our view, the High Court was\nright in the conclusion to which it arrived.\nIt is true that it is difficult to rely upon the oral\ntestimony of either side. Defendant No. I and defendant No.\n3 are evidently interested persons and their testimony may\nnot carry much weight. Parappa one of the Panchas deposed\nthat the amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- was divided on August 19,\n1947, and each branch received its share. He stated that\nthe amount was not entered in the books of account. He\nfurther stated that after the safes were opened, the Tippan\nbook was found together with the money and that the cash was\ncounted but it was not compared with the Tippan book, that\nthereafter the amount was divided. According to this\nwitness, there was no documentary evidence about that amount\nand he did not know whether the defendants had knowledge of\nthe extent thereof He explained that no receipts were taken\nbecause defendant No. I did not demand the same, that he did\nnot press for a writing as the parties said that it was a \"\n\nsecret arrangement \", and as the division was \" with\ncomplete concord \", he did not think it necessary to take a\nwriting or to record it in the books.\n\nThe testimony of Huchappa 'was similar. The other Panch\nDevendrasa stated that plaintiff No. 1 and defendant No. 2\nhad pressed the Panchas to give them their share in the \"\n\nunaccounted cash \", saying that defendant No. I was \"\n\nindefinitely postponing \" it, that the Panchas advised\ndefendant No. 1 to divide this amount, but he stated that he\nwould be \" reduced to equality \" with others when' he had a\nlarge family and that he had made great efforts and that he\nshould\nbe given more property, otherwise he would not allow\ndivision of the \" unaccounted cash \" and the other property.\nThe Panchas then told him that they had decided upon the\nshare each should be given and no further proposal would be\nentertained by plaintiff No. 1. The witness then said that\nhe left for Gadag. In cross-examination, he stated that he\nand the other Panchas had told defendant No.1 to give the\nshares of the unaccounted cash to the other sharers.\nThe evidence of the witnesses clearly shows that the\nquestion relating to the division of the \"unaccounted cash \"\n\nwas expressly discussed and the plaintiffs as well as\ndefendant No. 3 were fully aware of the existence of this\namount lying in the safe which was not entered in the books\nof account. It is the case of defendant No. I that the\namount was divided on October 19, 1947. The first plaintiff\nand defendant No. 3 have denied this on oath; defendant No.\n2 did not enter the witness box. The burden certainly did\nlie upon defendant No. 1 to establish the division of the\namount but there are several important circumstances which\ngo to prove that a partition must have been effected as\nalleged by defendant No. 1. From the sequence in which\nvarious properties were partitioned, it is clear that in the\nfirst instance the principle of division was decided and\nthen the valuable properties like the immovable properties,\nthe cash, stock in trade of the shops, were divided and then\nthe division of properties of comparatively small value like\nthe agricultural implements, pots and furniture was taken in\nhand. If there was a. large amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- in\ncash lying undivided before dividing pots, pans and\nfurniture, the other parties would have insisted upon the\ndivision of that amount.: - It is difficult to believe\nespecially having regard to the plea that defendant No. 1\nhad adopted a refractory attitude with the other parties\nthat defendant No. 3 accepted the division of properties of\ncomparatively small value without insisting upon division of\nthis large amount. There is also the circumstance that even\nthough plaintiff No. I know about the existence of the \"\n\nunacounted cash \" in the safe, it was\nexpressly mentioned in the plaint. We would have expected\nthe plaintiffs to state expressly that on or about October\n19, 1947, \" unaccounted cash \" was found in the safe and\nthat even though defendant No. I was asked to divide the\nsame by the remaining parties as well as the Panchas, he\ndeclined to accede to that demand. The conduct of defendant\nNo. 3 in not setting out this item in his plaint renders the\nstory that defendant No. I refused to divide this amount\nsomewhat improbable. There is again no reference in the\nplaint filed by defendant No. 3 that the amount that was\ndivisible was not divided on account of the attitude adopted\nby defendant No. 1. Counsel for defendant No. 3 relied upon\nthe averments in para. 9 of the plaint that it was not\npossible for defendant No. 3 to give a description of the\nremaining properties and the movable articles belonging to\nthe family and the money lending dealings. But there is in\nthe plaint no reference to any cash amount. Schedules\nappended to the plaint are very detailed and it is difficult\nto believe that defendant No. 3 did not mention that this\namount of Rs. 3,20,000/- was not divided even after demands\nwere made and ignored. The plea that he apprehended that he\nmight be called upon to pay court fee ad valorem on the\namount if he specified it in the plaint is futile.\nConsistently with the 'practice prevailing in the courts in\nthe Bombay Province, defendant No. 3 had paid Rs. 18,12,0 as\ncourt fee under\nArt. 17\n, cl. VII, on the plea that he and\nthe other parties were in constructive possession of the\nentire property, belonging to the family. Properties worth\nlakhs of rupees were described in the schedules annexed to\nthe plaint and if court fee ad valorem was not payable\naccording to defendant No. 3 in respect of, those\nproperties, we fail to appreciate why he should have\napprehended that court fee ad valorem would still be payable\nif he claimed a share -in the cash amount of Rs. 3,20,000/-.\nThere is also the other circumstances that with consent\nof the parties reference was made to Godkhindi by the three\nPanchas of all the matters which had\nremained to be settled, and in the statement made before him\nwhich was recorded in writing, there was no reference to\nthe claim that the amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- had remained to\nbe divided. Plaintiff No. 1 gave a detailed statement of\nthe properties which remained to be divided and that\ndocument is dated December 5, 1947: Ex. D-482. Item 5 is \"\n\ncash balance in the Dalali shops and in the house should be\ndivided \", and again in cl. (12) it was stated \" an account\nof the amounts in suspense (parabhare) account should be\ntaken and the total of the said amount should be divided.\"\n\nCounsel for the plain. tiffs and the third defendant\nsubmitted that the original of this list was in Kannad which\nwas translated into Marathi and the Marathi word which is\ntranslated into English as \" suspense \" was \" parabhare \".\nThat word according to the plaintiffs and the third\ndefendant meant \" unaccounted for \". It is difficult for us\nto express any opinion on this argument. It may be observed\nthat the learned Judge of the High Court who delivered the\njudgment was himself conversant with the Marathi language\nand he was not prepared to accept that interpretation. But\nthat by itself may not be sufficient to reject the plea of\nthe plaintiffs. What is material is that in a detailed\nstatement consisting of as many as 24 items the plaintiffs\nhave not set out that this amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- which\nwas found in the family safe and which the Panchas wanted to\ndivide, was on account of the uncompromising attitude of the\nfirst defendant not divided. If the amount had not been\ndivided, we have not the slightest doubt that in the\nstatement this amount would have been expressly included.\nGodkhindi was examined as a witness in these suits. The\ntrial court found him to be a person who was wholly\ndisinterested. It appears from the evidence of Godkhindi\nthat no question about the division of Rs. 3,20,000/- was\nmooted. If the amount had not been divided, we have no\ndoubt that this question would have been prominently brought\nto his notice; but no such plea was even raised. We are of\nthe view having regard to these circumstances that\nthe amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- must have been divided.\nIn that view of the case, the decree passed by the High\nCourt will be modified as follows:--\n\nThe properties of the joint family except the properties\ndivided on September - 23, 1946, October 12, 1946, October\n19, 1946, including the amount of Rs. 3,20,000/-, October\n20, 1946, October 21, 1946, including the stock-in-trade,\nsilks and sarees and cupboards, and on November 10, 1946,\nFebruary 7, 1947, February 22, 1947, February 24, 1947,\nFebruary 25, 1947, and the furniture, utensils and other\nmovables between May and June, 1947, and the property\ndivided on July 13, 1947, and the outstandings divided be-\ntween February 5, 1948, and February 9,1948, shall be\npartitioned between the parties. The partition will be made\non the footing that defendant No. 3 is entitled to a half\nshar and defendant No. 1, the plaintiffs collectively and\ndefendant No. 2 are each entitled to a 1/6 share. Defendant\nNo. I will be entitled to his costs in Appeals Nos. 218 of\n1959 and 219 of 1959. The other appeals filed by the\nplaintiffs and defendant No. 3 will be dismissed. One\nhearing fee.\n\nC. As. Nos. 218 and 219 of 1959 allowed.\n\nC. As. Nos. 220 to 223 of 1959 dismissed.",
