As per the facts pleaded in the writ petition, petitioner is an\n\nemployee of respondent No.1-Bank. He joined the services as Clerk\n\non 31st of January, 1995.

Petitioner represented to the respondent for assigning reason\n\nfor ignoring him from consideration. The representation has been\n\nplaced on record at Annexure P-6 which has not been decided as yet.\n\nPetitioner claims that respondent No.1 conveyed through\n\ncommunication dated 1st of September, 2017 that in ACR for the year\n\n2016-17 he has been assessed as 'Average'. Petitioner claims that the\n\nremarks were never conveyed to him.\n\n3. Ld.

Reliance is being\n\nplaced upon Rajinder Kumar vs. Punjab State Cooperative\n\nAgricultural Development Bank Ltd., CWP No.20465 of 2012,\n\ndecided on 13.05.2016; and by the Apex Court in\nDev Dutt vs. Union\n\nof India and others\n, 2008(8) SCC 725 and Sukhdev Singh vs. Union\n\nof India and others, 2013(5) SCR 1004.\n\n4. Ld.

Thus, the\n\nsame is not amenable to writ jurisdiction.

Sultanpur, U.P.\n\nvs. Satrughan Nishad and others\n, JT 2003(8) SC 235 the present\n\nwrit petition is not maintainable.\n\n5.\nIn order to controvert the preliminary objection raised by\n\nrespondent, counsel for the petitioner has relied upon AIR 1982 P&H\n\n228 titled as\nPritam Singh Gill vs. State of Punjab and others\nand\n\nU.P. State Co-Operative Land Development Bank Ltd. vs.\n\nChandra Bhan Dubey and others\ndecided on 18th of December,\n\n1998.\n\nIt has been claimed that since the Bank has been constituted\n\nunder the Punjab Act No.26 of 1957 titled as 'the Punjab Cooperative\n\nAgricultural Development Banks Act, 1957', the case of the petitioner\n\nwould be fully covered by the law\nlaid down by\nApex Court in\nU.P.\n\nState Co-Operative Land Development Bank Ltd.\n(supra).\n\n6. I have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through\n\nthe records of the case.\n\n7. The issues involved in the present writ petition are :\n\na) whether Cooperative Society falls within the ambit of 'State' as\n\nenumerated under\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution of India?'.\n\nb) 'whether the writ petition would be maintainable against a\n\n3 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:49 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 4\n\nCooperative Society despite the fact that it does not fall within the\n\nambit of 'State'?.\n\n8. So far as the first issue is concerned Seven Judges Bench\n\nof Apex Court in the case of\nPradeep Kumar Biswas vs. Indian\n\nInstitute of Chemical Biology\n, (2002) 5 SCC 111 while considering\n\nthe test as\nlaid down in\nthe case of\nAjay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib\n\nSehravardi\n, (1981) 1 SCC 722 and overruling the view taken in\n\nSabhajit Tewari vs. Union of India and others\n, (1975) 1 SCC 485\n\nobserved as under :\n\n\"40. The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests\nformulated in Ajay Hasia are not a rigid set of principles so that if\na body falls within any one of them it must, ex-hypothesis, be\nconsidered to be a State within the meaning of\nArticle 12.\nThe\nquestion in each case would be - whether in the light of the\ncumulative facts as established, the body is financially,\nfunctionally and administratively dominated by or under the\ncontrol of the Government. Such control must be particular to the\nbody in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the\nbody is a State within\nArticle 12.\nOn the other hand, when the\ncontrol is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it\nwould not serve to make the body a State.\"\n\n9. The question w.r.t. Punjab State Co-operative Land\n\nMortgage Bank being a 'State' or not already stands answered by Full\n\nBench of this Court in the case of Pritam Singh vs. State (FB), AIR\n\n1982 Punjab and Haryana 228.\nThe Full Bench following the\n\nprinciples laid down in\nAjay Hasia\n's case (supra) concluded as\n\n4 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:49 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 5\n\nunder :-\n\n\"25. From the above, the conclusion, therefore, is inevitable that it\nhas not even remotely been established that respondent No. 3 the\nmortgage bank (against which alone the primary relief is claimed),\nis an instrumentality or agency of the State. Consequently, it cannot\nbe deemed to be an authority within the meaning of\nArt. 12\nof the\nConstitution of India and thus not amenable to a writ of certiorari\nunder\nArt. 226\nof the Constitution of India, which is the primary\nrelief sought.\n\n26. Repelled on his primary plank to establish that the mortgage\nbank was an instrumentality of the State and consequently\namenable to the writ jurisdiction (despite the fact of its being\nregistered under the\nCo-operative Societies Act\n), Mr. Saini made a\ntactical retreat to make a flanking attack which seems to be equally\nfutile. It was forcefully contended that in spite of the fact that the\nmortgage bank may not be an authority under\nArt. 12\nof the\nConstitution of India, a writ of certiorari will nevertheless still lie\nfor quashing the order of the Managing Director of the respondent-\nmortgage bank, whereby the petitioner has been compulsorily\nretried. This contention might merit some dubious tribute to the\ningenuity of the learned counsel but the same is patently\nfallacious.\"\n\nIt needs to be mentioned that in afore-said judgment Full Bench\n\napproved the view taken by Single Bench viz-a-viz the respondent-\n\nBank in this case holding that it is not 'State'.\n\n10. Being bound by ratio of law\nlaid down by\nthe Full Bench\n\nin\nPritam Singh\n's case (supra), I have no hesitation in holding that the\n\nrespondent-Cooperative Society is not 'State' or instrumentality thereof\n\nand, thus, would not fall within ambit of\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution\n\nof India. Resultantly, the first question framed in Para 7 stands\n\n5 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 6\n\nanswered in favour of the respondent.\n\n11. Now coming on to the second issue. The law has evolved.\n\nOwing to the change post economic liberalization of the country in the\n\n1990s, role of the State is getting limited. Doctrine of laissez-faire is\n\nthe norm. However, it has led to creation of a parallel eco-system\n\nwherein bodies of different characters and species are performing\n\npublic functions. The Apex Court in the case of\nAnadi Mukta\n\nSadguru vs. V.R. Rudani and others\n, (1989) 2 SCC 691 made\n\nfollowing observations :-\n\n\"The term \"authority\" used in\nArticle 226\n, in the con- text, must\nreceive a liberal meaning unlike the term in\nArticle 12.\n\nArticle 12\n\nis relevant only for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental\nrights under\nArt. 32.\n\nArticle 226\nconfers power on the High Courts\nto issue writs for enforcement of the fundamental rights as well as\nnon-fundamental rights. The words \"Any person or authority\" used\nin\nArticle 226\nare, therefore, not to be confined only to statutory\nauthorities and instrumentalities of the State. They may cover any\nother person or body performing public duty. The form of the body\nconcerned is not very much relevant. What is relevant is the nature\nof the duty imposed on the body. The duty must be judged in the\nlight of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the\naffected party. No matter by what means the duty is imposed. If a\npositive obligation exists mandamus cannot be denied.\"\n\n12.\nIn the case of\nSt. Mary's Education Society and another\n\nvs. Rajendra Prasad Bhargava and others\n, 2022 SCC OnLine SC\n\n1091 while concluding the law w.r.t. maintainability of writ petition\n\n6 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 7\n\nagainst the State instrumentality/bodies involved in public functions\n\nheld as under :\n\n\"(a) An application under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution is\nmaintainable against a person or a body discharging public duties\nor public functions. The public duty cast may be either statutory\nor otherwise and where it is otherwise, the body or the person\nmust be shown to owe that duty or obligation to the public\ninvolving the public law element. Similarly, for ascertaining the\ndischarge of public function, it must be established that the body\nor the person was seeking to achieve the same for the collective\nbenefit of the public or a section of it and the authority to do so\nmust be accepted by the public.\n\n(b) Even if it be assumed that an educational institution is\nimparting public duty, the act complained of must have a direct\nnexus with the discharge of public duty. It is indisputably a public\nlaw action which confers a right upon the aggrieved to invoke the\nextraordinary writ jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nfor a prerogative\nwrit. Individual wrongs or breach of mutual contracts without\nhaving any public element as its integral part cannot be rectified\nthrough a writ petition under\nArticle 226.\nWherever Courts have\nintervened in their exercise of jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\n,\neither the service conditions were regulated by the statutory\nprovisions or the employer had the status of \"State\" within the\nexpansive definition under\nArticle 12\nor it was found that the\naction complained of has public law element.\n\n(c) It must be consequently held that while a body may be\ndischarging a public function or performing a public duty and thus\nits actions becoming amenable to judicial review by a\nConstitutional Court, its employees would not have the right to\ninvoke the powers of the High Court conferred by\nArticle 226\nin\nrespect of matter relating to service where they are not governed\nor controlled by the statutory provisions. An educational\ninstitution may perform myriad functions touching various facets\nof public life and in the societal sphere. While such of those\n\n7 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 8\n\nfunctions as would fall within the domain of a \"public function\"\n\nor \"public duty\" be undisputedly open to challenge and scrutiny\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, the actions or decisions\ntaken solely within the confines of an ordinary contract of service,\nhaving no statutory force or backing, cannot be recognised as\nbeing amenable to challenge under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution. In the absence of the service conditions being\ncontrolled or governed by statutory provisions, the matter would\nremain in the realm of an ordinary contract of service.\n\n(d) Even if it be perceived that imparting education by private\nunaided the school is a public duty within the expanded\nexpression of the term, an employee of a nonteaching staff\nengaged by the school for the purpose of its administration or\ninternal management is only an agency created by it. It is\nimmaterial whether \"A\" or \"B\" is employed by school to\ndischarge that duty. In any case, the terms of employment of\ncontract between a school and non-teaching staff cannot and\nshould not be construed to be an inseparable part of the obligation\nto impart education. This is particularly in respect to the\ndisciplinary proceedings that may be initiated against a particular\nemployee. It is only where the removal of an employee of non-\n\nteaching staff is regulated by some statutory provisions, its\nviolation by the employer in contravention of law may be\ninterfered by the court. But such interference will be on the\nground of breach of law and not on the basis of interference in\ndischarge of public duty.\n\n(e) From the pleadings in the original writ petition, it is apparent\nthat no element of any public law is agitated or otherwise made\nout. In other words, the action challenged has no public element\nand writ of mandamus cannot be issued as the action was\nessentially of a private character.\"\n\n13. Thus, the proposition that emerges is that for an\n\nestablishment to be a 'State' as defined under\nArticle 12\nof the\n\n8 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 9\n\nConstitution of India, it must pass the tests as enumerated by Apex\n\nCourt in\nAjay Hasia\n's case (supra) and reiterated by the Constitution\n\nBench in the case of\nPradeep Kumar Biswas\n(supra). In case the\n\nestablishment against whom writ has been filed falls within the ambit\n\nof\nArticle 12\nand can be termed as 'State', there would be no doubt\n\nabout the same being amenable to writ jurisdiction. However, writ\n\npetition will not be held to be maintainable against a body discharging\n\npublic function merely because it does not fall within the definition of\n\n'State'. The test is : whether cause of action pleaded by the petitioner\n\ninvolves breach of statutory provision? In the case of Cooperative\n\nSociety also though it is not 'State' but a breach of statutory Rules\n\nwould render it amenable to writ jurisdiction.\n\n14. Even in the case of\nS.S. Rana vs. Registrar Co-operative\n\nSocieties & Anr.\n(2006) 11 SCC 434 Apex Court held as under :-\n\n\"8. ....It is not in dispute that the Society has not been constituted\nunder an Act. Its functions like any other Co-operative Society\nare mainly regulated in terms of the provisions of the Act, except\nas provided in the bye-laws of the Society. The State has no say\nin the functions of the Society. Membership, acquisition of shares\nand all other matters are governed by the bye-laws framed under\nthe Act. The terms and conditions of an officer of the Co-\noperative Society, indisputably, are governed by the Rules. Rule\n56, to which reference has been made by Mr. Vijay Kumar, does\nnot contain any provision in terms whereof any legal right as such\nis conferred upon an officer of the Society.\n\n9. It has not been shown before us that the State exercises any\n\n9 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 10\n\ndirect or indirect control over the affairs of the Society for deep\nand pervasive control. The State furthermore is not the majority\nshareholder. The State has the power only to nominate one\ndirector. It cannot, thus, be said that the State exercises any\nfunctional control over the affairs of the Society in the sense that\nthe majority directors are nominated by the State. For arriving at\nthe conclusion that the State has a deep and pervasive control\nover the Society, several other relevant questions are required to\nbe considered, namely : (1) How the Society was created ?; (2)\nWhether it enjoys any monopoly character ?; (3) Do the functions\nof the Society partake to statutory functions or public functions ?;\nand (4) Can it be characterised as public Authority ?\n\n10. The respondent No. 1-Society does not answer any of the\nafore-mentioned tests.\nIn the case of a non-statutory society, the\ncontrol thereover would mean that the same satisfies the tests\nlaid\ndown by\nthis Court in\nAjay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi\n,\n(1981)1 SCC 722. [See Zoroastrian Coop. Housing Society Ltd.\n\nv. District Registrar, Coop. Societies (Urban) & Ors., 2005(5)\nSCC 632].\n\n11. It is well settled that general regulations under an Act, like\n\nCompanies Act\nor the\nCo-operative Societies Act\n, would not\nrender the activities of a company or a society as subject to\ncontrol of the State. Such control in terms of the provisions of the\nAct are meant to ensure proper functioning of the Society and the\nState or statutory authorities would have nothing to do with its\nday-to-day functions.\n\n12. The decision of the Seven Judge Bench of this Court in\n\nPradeep Kumar Biswas\n(supra), whereupon strong reliance has\nbeen placed, has no application in the instant case.\n\nIn that case,\nthe Bench was deciding a question as to whether in view of the\nsubsequent decisions of this Court, the law was correctly\nlaid\ndown in\n\nSabhajit Tewary v. Union of India & Ors.\n, (1975) 1\nSCC 485, and it not whether the same deserved to be overruled.\nThe majority opined that the Council of Scientific and Industrial\n\n10 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 11\n\nResearch (CSIR) was a 'State' within the meaning of\nArticle 12\nof\nthe Constitution of India. This Court noticed the history of the\nformation thereof, its objects and functions, its management and\ncontrol as also the extent of financial aid received by it. Apart\nfrom the said fact it was noticed by reason of an appropriate\nnotification issued by the Central Government that CSIR was\namenable to the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative\nTribunal in terms of\nSection 14(2)\nof the Administrative\nTribunals Act, 1985.\n\nIt was on the aforementioned premises this\nCourt opined that\nSabhajit Tewary\n(supra) did not lay down the\ncorrect law.\n\nThis Court reiterated the following six tests\nlaid\ndown in\n\nAjay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi\n, (1981) 1 SCC\n722 :\n\n\"(1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the\ncorporation is held by Government, it would go a long\nway towards indicating that the corporation is an\ninstrumentality or agency of Government.\n\n(2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much\nas to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it\nwould afford some indication of the corporation being\nimpregnated with Governmental character.\n\n(3) It may also be relevant factor ...whether the\ncorporation enjoys monopoly status which is State\nconferred or State protected.\n\n(4) Existence of deep and pervasive State control may\nafford an indication that the corporation is a State agency\nor instrumentality.\n\n(5) If the functions of the corporation are of public\nimportance and closely related to Governmental functions,\nit would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation\nas an instrumentality or agency of Government.\n(6) 'Specifically, if a department of Government is\ntransferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor\nsupportive of this inference' of the corporation being an\ninstrumentality or agency of Government.\"\n\n11 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 12\n\nThis\nCourt further held\n:\n\n\"This picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests\nformulated in Ajay Hasia are not a rigid set of principles\nso that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex\nhypothesi, be considered to be a State within the meaning\nof\nArticle 12.\nThe question in each case would be whether\nin the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body\nis financially, functionally and administratively dominated\nby or under the control of the Government. Such control\nmust be particular to the body in question and must be\npervasive. If this is found then the body is a State within\n\nArticle 12.\nOn the other hand, when the control is merely\nregulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would\nnot serve to make the body a State.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n13. As the respondent No. 1 does not satisfy any of the tests\nlaid\ndown in\n\nPradeep Kumar Biswas\n(supra), we are of the opinion\nthat the High Court cannot be said to have commtted any error in\narriving at a finding that the respondent-Bank is not a State within\nthe meaning of\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n14. We are, however, not oblivious of a three judge Bench decision\nin\nGayatri De v. Mousumi Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. &\nOrs.\n, 2004(3) RCR (Civil) 204 : (2004) 5 SCC 90, wherein this\nCourt held a writ petition to be maintainable against the\ncooperative society only stating :\n\n\"We have, in paragraphs supra, considered the judgments\nfor and against on the question of maintainability of writ\npetition. The judgments cited by the learned Senior\nCounsel appearing for the respondents are distinguishable\non facts and on law. Those cases are not cases covered by\nthe appointment of a Special Officer to manage the\nadministration of the Society and its affairs. In the instant\ncase, the Special Officer was appointed by the High Court\nto discharge the functions of the Society, therefore, he\n\n12 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 13\n\nshould be regarded as a public authority and hence, the\nwrit petition is maintainable.\"\n\n15. The said decision, therefore, is of no assistance to us.\n\n16. Our attention has also been drawn to U.P. State Cooperative\nLand development\nBank Ltd. v. Chandra Bhan Dubey & Ors.\n,\n1999(1) S.C.T. 593 : (1999) 1 SCC 741, wherein the writ petition\nwas held to be maintainable principally on the ground that it had\nbeen created under an Act.\n\nReliance has also been placed upon\n\nRam Sahan Rai v. Sachiv Samanaya Prabandhak & Anr.\n, 2001\n(2) S.C.T. 231 : (2001) 3 SCC 323, wherein again the appellant\nthus was recruited in a Society constituted under the U.P.\nCooperative Land Development Bank Act, 1964 and this Court,\nhaving examined different provisions of rules, bye-laws and\nregulations, was of the firm opinion that the State Government\nexercised all-pervasive control over the Bank and moreover its\nemployees were governed by statutory rules, prescribing an entire\ngamut of procedure of initiation of disciplinary proceedings by\nframing a set of charges culminating in inflicting of appropriate\npunishment, after complying with the requirements of giving a\nshow-cause and an opportunity of hearing to the delinquent.\n\n17. It is, therefore, evident that in\nRam Sahan Rai\n(supra) also the\ncooperative society was held to be established under a statute.\n\nWe\nmay notice that in\nNayagarh Cooperative Central Bank Ltd. &\nAnr. v. Narayan Rath & Anr.\n, (1977) 3 SCC 576, this Court was\nof the opinion that :\n\n\"The High Court has dealt with the question whether a\nwrit petition can be maintained against a cooperative\nsociety, but we are inclined to the view that the\nobservations made by the High Court and its decision that\nsuch a writ petition is maintainable are not strictly in\naccordance with the decisions of this Court. We would\nhave liked to go into the question for ourselves, but it is\nunnecessary to do so as Respondent 1 by his writ petition,\n\n13 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 14\n\nwas asking for relief not really against a cooperative\nsociety but in regard to the order which was passed by the\nRegistrar, who was acting as a statutory authority in the\npurported exercise of powers conferred on him by the\n\nCooperative Societies Act\n. The writ petition was in that\nview maintainable.\"\n\n18. We may notice in some decisions, some High Courts have\nheld wherein that a writ petition would be maintainable against a\nsociety if it is demonstrated that any mandatory provision of the\nAct or the rules framed thereunder, have been violated by it. [See\n\nBholanath Roy & Ors. v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n, (1996)\nVol. 1 Calcutta Law Journal 502].\n\n19. The Society has not been created under any statute. It has not\nbeen shown before that in terminating the services of the\nappellant, the Respondent has violated any mandatory provisions\nof the Act or the rules framed thereunder. In fact, in the writ\npetition no such case was made out.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n15. In the present writ petition, the petitioner prays for writ of\n\nmandamus and not for writ of certiorari. Trite it is that in order to\n\ninvoke the mandamus jurisdiction, the petitioner is under obligation to\n\nshow public or statutory duty laid on the respondent and to\n\ndemonstrate an equally clear legal right to enforce the same. On the\n\naforesaid principle, ratio of law\nlaid down by\nFull Bench of this Court\n\nin\nPritam Singh\n's case (supra) is fully in-line with exceptions carved\n\nout in\nS.S. Rana\n's case (supra). Now the question arises is: whether\n\nthe Punjab State Cooperative Agricultural Development Bank Service\n\n14 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 15\n\nCommon Cadre Rules, 1978 are mandatory?.\n\n16.

There are three categories of Service Rules which can be\nframed to regulate the conditions of service of the employees of\nthe Society. In first category, a registered Society under the\n\nSocieties Act\ncan frame its own Service Rules to regulate the\nservice conditions of its employees. The Rules may be binding\nbetween the Society and its employees. The second category of\nthe Rules is those rules which are formulated under Section 85(2)\n(xxxviii), which empower the Government to frame Service Rules\nfor any Co-operative Society or for class of societies with regard\nto qualifications for employees of a Society or class of society and\nthe conditions of service subject to which persons may be\nemployed by Societies. Such Rules so framed have the force of\nStatute and are deemed to be incorporated as a part of the Statute,\nwhereas this principle does not apply to the first category of Rules\nframed by the Society because those Rules merely govern the\ninternal management, business or administration of a society.\nThey are of the nature of the Articles of Association of a\nCompany incorporated under the\nCompanies Act\n. They may be\nbinding between the persons affected by them, but they do not\nhave the force of a statute. But the second category of Rules is the\nStatutory Rules and they have the force of the statute. Similarly,\nthere is third category of Rules known as Common Cadre Rules.\nThese rules could have been framed under Section 84-A of the\nPunjab Act which provide that an apex society may suo motu and\nwhen required to do so by the Registrar shall constitute a common\ncadre of all, or specified class of employee in the service of that\nsociety or in the service of the central societies which are\n\n15 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 16\n\nmembers of the apex society or in the service of the primary\nsocieties which are members of the apex society. Sub-section (2)\nfurther provides that when a common cadre of employee is\nconstituted under sub-section (1), the Registrar shall\nnotwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being\nin force or any agreement, settlement or award determine the pay\nscales and allowances admissible to such employees and Apex\nSociety shall make rules for the regulation of recruitment and\nconditions of service of such employees with the prior approval of\nthe Registrar. Therefore, the Common Cadre Rules framed under\nsub-section (2) by the Registrar are also having the statutory\ncolour and stand on the same footing as that of the Statutory\nRules.\"\n\n17. Thus Full Bench of this Court has already held that the\n\nCommon Cadre Rules are mandatory in nature and, thus, the writ of\n\nmandamus to enforce the same would be maintainable in view of\n\nsettled law.\n\n18. In the present case admittedly, the service conditions of the\n\nemployees of the Bank are governed by the Punjab State Cooperative\n\nAgricultural Development Bank Service Common Cadre Rules, 1978\n\nwhich are statutory in nature. The petitioner claims right to be\n\nconsidered for promotion on the basis of the said Rules. Thus, writ\n\npetition is held to be maintainable. The petitioner claims that the\n\naction of the authorities in relying upon un-communicated ACRs ought\n\nnot have been considered to deny him promotion. On merits the\n\nrespondent-Bank in its written statement has not denied that the\n\n16 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 17\n\nAverage ACRs were never communicated to the petitioner. As per\n\ncounsel for the petitioner the matter is squarely covered by ratio of law\n\nlaid down by\nthis Court in the case of\nRajinder Kumar vs. Punjab\n\nState Agricultural Development Bank Limited - CWP No.20465\nof\n\n2012, decided vide order dated 13th of May, 2016 in which this Court\n\nheld as under :\n\n\"The said stand taken by the Bank, cannot be accepted. It\nhas been time and again held that ACRs, whether good or\nadverse, have to be communicated to the employee so that he can\nimprove his performance. The Apex Court in\nDev Dutt Vs. Union\nof India & others\n2008 (8) SCC 725 held to that effect.\n\nThe said\nview has further been approved by a three-Judge Bench of the\nApex Court in\nSukhdev Singh vs. Union of India and others\n,\n2013 (5) SCR 1004. The relevant portion reads as under:-\n\n\"8. In our opinion, the view taken in Dev Dutt that every\nentry in ACR of a public servant must be communicated to\nhim/her within a reasonable period is legally sound and\nhelps in achieving threefold objectives. First, the\ncommunication of every entry in the ACR to a public\nservant helps him/her to work harder and achieve more\nthat helps him in improving his work and give better\nresults. Second and equally important, on being made\naware of the entry in the ACR, the public servant may feel\ndissatisfied with the same. Communication of the entry\nenables him/her to make representation for upgradation of\nthe remarks entered in the ACR. Third, communication of\nevery entry in the ACR brings transparency in recording\nthe remarks relating to a public servant and the system\nbecomes more conforming to the principles of natural\njustice. We, accordingly, hold that every entry in ACR -\npoor, fair, average, good or very good - must be\ncommunicated to him/her within a reasonable period. 9.\n\n17 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 18\n\nThe decisions of this Court in\nSatya Narain Shukla vs.\nUnion of India\nand others10 and\nK.M. Mishra vs. Central\nBank of India\nand others11 and the other decisions of this\nCourt taking a contrary view are declared to be not laying\ndown a good law.\"\n\nSimilarly, in\nDr.Gurdev Singh Bhardwaj vs. State of\nPunjab and others\n2013 (1) RSJ 474, it was held that adverse\nentry needs to be communicated to the employee and is liable to\nbe ignored while determining the bench marks. The relevant\nportions read thus:-\n\n\"12. Following the dictum\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court, it\nis clear that the average report relating to the year 2005- 06\nwhich clearly had an adverse effect insofar as\nconsideration of the petitioner for purposes of promotion to\nthe higher post of Senior Medical Officer, was required to\nbe conveyed to him. Accordingly, it is held that the ACR\nfor the year 2005- 06 having not been communicated to the\npetitioner was liable to be ignored while determining the\nbench mark.\n\n13. That apart, I find that the respondent-authorities have\nacted arbitrarily in not considering the ACR of the\npetitioner for the year 2007-08. The right of an employee\nto be considered for promotion is a fundamental right\nunder\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution of India. It is not just a\nright of consideration but, in fact, an obligation cast upon\nthe employer to afford a fair consideration to an employee\nin terms of the principles of service jurisprudence. It has\nbeen admitted that the petitioner had been graded 'very\ngood' for the year 2007-08 and such report had been duly\nreceived but was not available at the time of preparation of\nagenda submitted before the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee. This cannot be a basis for denying to the\npetitioner the grading in terms of assigning three numbers\nfor such 'very good' report for the year 2007- 08. 14.\nLearned counsel appearing for the petitioner would bring\nto my notice that the petitioner has since retired on\n\n18 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 19\n\n29.2.2012, having attained the age of superannuation. 15.\nAccordingly, I allow the present petition in terms of\ndirecting the respondent-authorities to reconsider the claim\nof the petitioner for promotion to the post of Senior\nMedical Officer in terms of determining the bench mark\nafresh by ignoring the ACR for the year 2005-06 and in\nterms of taking into account the five previous ACRs i.e.\nfor the years 2008-09, 2007- 08, 2006-07, 2004-05 and\n2003-04. It is further directed that if in pursuance to such\nexercise, which shall be concluded positively within a\nperiod of three months from the date of receipt of a\ncertified copy of this order, the petitioner fulfils the\nrequisite bench mark, then orders shall be issued\npromoting the petitioner to the post of Senior Medical\nOfficer on a notional basis. The petitioner in such\neventuality would also be held entitled to notional pay\nfixation on the post of Senior Medical Officer as on the\ndate of his superannuation and would be released the\nrevised pensionary/retiral benefits accordingly.\"\nAccordingly, keeping in view the settled position of law,\nthe present writ petition is allowed....\"\n\n19. The same approved by the Division Bench holding that :-\n\n\"11. However, if the appellant-bank introduced the element of\n'selection' for promoting its officials, then it cannot adopt the rule\nof seniority-cum-merit. In that even, the bank needs to amend its\nrules and insert the criteria of 'merit-cum-seniority' or 'selection'.\nThe fact remains that as per the existing provisions of the rules, the\nrespondent having earned all the favourable annual confidential\nreports, was entitled to be promoted on seniority-cum-merit basis.\nDenial of such benefit to him was undoubtedly violative of\nArticle\n& 16\nof the Constitution. Hence, the interference made by\nlearned Single Judge is fully justified.\"\n\n19 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 20\n\n20. Thus, in view of the fact that the Division Bench has\n\nalready held that denial of promotion at the hands of the Punjab State\n\nCooperative Agricultural Development Bank Limited by considering\n\nun-communicated ACR would be violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India in view of law\nlaid down by\nApex Court in the\n\ncase of Dev Dutt.\nvs.\nUnion of India and others\n(supra) as approved\n\nby Three-Judges Bench in the case of\nSukhdev Singh vs. Union of\n\nIndia and others\n(supra), the claim of the petitioner merits\n\nacceptance.\n\n21. Accordingly, present writ petition is allowed. Respondents\n\nare directed to promote the petitioner from the date his juniors were\n\npromoted i.e. 7th of July, 2017 as Deputy Manager and the financial\n\nbenefits due to the petitioner be disbursed accordingly. Needful be\n\ndone within a period of three months from the date of receipt of\n\ncertified copy of this order.\n\nFebruary 23, 2023 (PANKAJ JAIN)\nDpr JUDGE\nWhether speaking/reasoned : Yes/No\nWhether reportable : Yes/No\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\n20 of 20\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::",
