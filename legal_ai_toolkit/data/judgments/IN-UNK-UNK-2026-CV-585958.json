Bhupendra Pandey\n) arising out of Case Crime No. 150 of 2021 under \nSections 376-D\n, \n506\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3 (2) (v)\n of SC/ST Act, Police Station Daraganj, District Prayagraj, as expeditiously as possible.\n\n3. The instant case has remained pending since 2022. When the matter came up for consideration on 21.07.2022, it was intimated to the Court by Sri Bhupendra Pandey, the opposite party no.2 that several gangs of non-practising Advocates, are being operated involving women, to trap the innocent persons in fake cases implicating them amongst others Sections of \nIPC\n, under SC/ST Act and after submission of charge sheet, they distribute the money received from the Government, amongst themselves. \n\n4. Apart from the aforesaid submissions made by Sri Bhupendra Pandey, it was also intimated to the Court that certain persons, though they are Advocates on paper, but are non-practising Advocate have formed a gang and are closely associated with the ladies of SC/ST community. The modus operandi of the gang is -the ladies enter into agreement to sell after taking earnest money from the vendee. When the vendee asks them to execute the sale deed, they refuse and on insistence by the vendee, the alleged vendor use to implicate those vendees in false and frivolous case under penal provision of \nIPC\n along with SC/ST Act.

The inherent power cannot be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. Such powers have to be exercised only to give effect to any order under \nCr.P.C\n, to prevent abuse of the process of any court and to secure the ends of justice.

This Court while allowing the intervention application no. 09 of 2022, had directed the C.B.I. to conduct preliminary enquiry by the CBI with respect to Case Crime No. 91 of 2020 under \nSections 354Kh\n, \n147\n, \n148\n, \n323\n, \n308\n, \n427\n, \n452\n, \n504\n, \n506\n I.P.C.

It goes without saying that the applications which were allowed by this Court for conducting preliminary enquiry by the C.B.I. in respect to the cases as detailed in paragraph nos. 13 to 18, the accused persons are of pracitising Advocates.\n\n20. Apart from allowing the aforesaid applications, numbers of applications were rejected by this Court vide order dated 31.10.2023.\n\n21. Thus this Court, on different dates directed the C.B.I. to conduct preliminary enquiry in as many as 78 cases, details of which have already been given in the preceding paragraph nos.7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.\n\n22. Pursuant to the order dated 18.08.2022, the Preliminary Enquiry report submitted by the C.B.I. being No. PE 0532022S0001 shows that the cases which were directed to be enquired preliminary by the C.B.I. were 46, however the cases shown at serial nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 23, and 28 have been repeated at serial no. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 29 respectively and the F.I.R. said to have been registered at serial no. 30 of that report being Case Crime No. 391 of 2017 under \nSections 147\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n, \n379\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3 (2)\n V Ka SC/ST Act, Police Station Shivkuti, District Allahabad is not existing. Thus out of 46 cases, only 38 cases were preliminary enquired by the C.B.I. which as are under:-\n\n23. The preliminary enquiry No. PE 0532022S0001 with respect to 38 cases is in the following terms:\n\n(I) Case Crime No. 150 of 2021 under \nSections 376-D\n, \n506\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3 (2)(v)\n of SC/ST Act, Police Station Daraganj, District Prayagraj, which is instant case in the present 482 \nCr.P.C\n. in which, the applicant-informant Nikki Devi lodged against the opposite party no.2 Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, has sought prayer to expedite the proceedings.\n\nFindings of the State Police:- The first Investigating Officer namely, Sri Jai Prakash Shahi collected CDR of the accused during the investigation, the C.C.T.V. footage to ascertain the movement of the vehcile and recorded the statement of independent witnesses at scene of crime and found the alleged rape allegation suspicious. Since the prosecutrix belongs to Scheduled Caste, the concerned Sections of S/ST Act were added in the case. Therefore, case was transferred to concerned Circle Officer (City-V), Prayagraj for investigation. During subsequent investigation, accused Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, Advocate was arrested.\n\nThe Investigation was lastly carried out by Ms. Astha Jaiswal, who obtained legal opinion from Sri Gulab Chandra Saroj Prosecuting Officer, Prayagraj, for filing charge sheet on the basis of material available on record. He opined positively and suggested that IO may collect more evidence before filing the report under \nSection 173\n Cr.P.C. No further investigation was carried out in this matter and charge sheet was filed against Bhupendra Kumar Pandey under \nSection 376D\n and \n506\n I.P.C. only on the basis of statement of the victim recorded under \nSection 164\n Cr.P.C. The case is at the stage of trial.\n\nEnquiry by the CBI:- The first informant-victim had provided her mobile number 6391568409 in the F.I.R. which was issued by the service provider on 15.06.2021 at about 11:44 A.M. CDRs of the mobile number shows that there was no activity on this mobile number from 12:59 hours on 15.06.2021 to 17.06.2021. She got issued one more new mobile SIM on 15.06.2021 (the date of incident of alleged rape) in her name i.e. 7607946506 (Ritel) apart from 6391568406 (Vadafone). ON this day at 18:57:58, the location of mobile no. 7607946506 was found to be at Village Chak Payagi, Pargana Sikandara, Tehsil Phoolpur, District Prayagraj, which is about 32 kilometers away from the place of abduction i.e. C.M.P. Degree College, Prayagraj. Hence her allegation that she met with accused Bhupendra Kumar Pandey near C.M.P. Degree College at 07:00 P.M. does not appear to be correct. Sri Sonu husband of younger sister of the prosecutrix and his wife were using mobile no. 7754832321 & 9369071845 respectively and on that day i.e. on 15.06.2021, they had talked with the victim on her mobile no.7607946506. This further confirms that on 15.06.2021 the victim was using the mobile no 7607946506.\n\nThe CDR also reflects that during the alleged time of rape i.e. from 07:00 P.M. to 08:30 P.M. on 15.06.2021, this mobile number had received three calls at 20:06:54, 20:07:48 and 20:22:30 and at the time of receiving these calls, her location was at Village Dharauta, Tehil Mau Aima, District Allahabad and Lalganj, District Patapgarh which locations are more than 43 kilometers away from Jhoonsi area, the alleged place of rape.\n\nThe scrutiny of CDRs of mobile numbers 7318336999, 9792866999 of alleged accused Bhupendra Kumar Pandey revealed that on 15.06.2021 from 16:37:31 to 18:42:47, his location was at Stanley Road, Civil Line, Prayagraj whereas at around 18:58:40, he was at Elgin Road, Prayagraj. At this time he had conversation on mobile no. 9889100101 which lasted for about 12 minutes. From 19:11:03 till 20:56:08 his location was at Kydganj, Bai Ka Bagh, Prayagraj. CDRs do not reflect his movement to the place of scene of crime.\n\nImmediately after activation of mobile number 7607946506 by the victim-prosecutrix, the first call was made from this mobile was at around 12:28 PM on mobile number 8787272838 which was in the name of Sh. Vinay Shankar Tripathi, being used by Sh. Vinod Shankar Tripathi. On 15.06.2021, there were 03 more calls made from this mobile number to the mobile number 8787272838 of Sh. Vinod Shankar Tripathi. Sh. Sandeep Kumar Srivastava, Advocate, who appeared for Prosecutrix in Crl. Appeal No. 5350/21 has stated that Vakalatnama for this purpose was brought to him by Sh. Vinod Shankar Tripathi He denied having seen Prosecutrix in person.\n\nThe versions regarding the place of incident are varying in victim's statements recorded\n u/s 161\n Cr.PC, 164 \nCr.PC\n and during inspection of the crime scene. Residents around the place of incident have denied the occurrence of any incident of rape at that place.\n\nFrom the CCTV footage of the cameras located along the route narrated by Prosecutrix/victim in her statement, movement of accused's vehicle was not seen during the relevant time. During her medical examination, prosecutrix had named Shri Govind Pandey in place of Bhupendra Kumar Pandey as an accused who had raped her.\n\nThe above facts do not inspire faith in the allegations of rape levelled by prosecutrix against Bhupendra Kumar Pandey & another. Further, the conduct of Sri. Vinod Shankar Tripathi, Advocate being in constant touch with the prosecutrix/ complainant during the relevant period also points finger towards his involvement in this case.\n\nThe registration of the aforesaid false case was followed by a counter rape case wherein Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and his father were arrayed as an accused on 15.05.2022 in FIR No. 105/2022 of Police Station: Daraganj lodged by Smt. Samla Giri alleging gang rape of her daughter on 08.05.2022 at about 07:30 PM. Investigation by the State Police established that no such incident had taken place. In fact, the victim, daughter of Smt. Samla Giri in her statement\n u/s 164\n Cr.PC had stated that no such incident had taken place and the FIR was got registered on the directions of her mother. The CDR locations of mobile numbers of accused Vinod Shankar Tripathi, Brijesh, Rajesh Shukla, Sudhakar Mishra and Vijay Tripathi were collected by the State Police during investigation which reflected that at the time of incident, the accused persons were not present at the scene of crime. Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi has alleged that Smt. Samla Giri is an associate of Shri Bhupender Kumar Pandey, Advocate and this FIR was lodged by her at his behest only.\n\nAround this time Smt. Kusum Lata had stated to be an associate as well as client of Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, Advocate filed another complaint no. 125/2022 dated 22.04.2022 under SC /ST Act before C.J.M. Allahabad against Vinod Shankar Tripathi, his father and brothers alleging that on 20.06.2021 at around 11:30 PM they forcibly entered her house at 14/A, Rajapur, PS Cantt. Prayagraj. Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi has stated that as per the existing norms, the Govt. of UP gave a compensation of Rs. 6 lacs to her. In this case against Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and his family, Shri Jagat Narayan Tiwari is one of the witnesses in favour of Smt. Kusum Lata. Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi has further stated that Smt. Kusum Lata had earlier taken similar compensation in FIR No. 243 of 2018, PS Civil Lines, Prayagraj in which Sri Jagat Narayan Tiwari who is star witness in this case, was made an accused as per the complaint of Smt. Kusum Lata Around this time, another FIR No. 114/2022 U/s 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506, 307 \nIPC\n PS Phaphamau was registered on 21.04.2022 against Vinod Shankar Tripathi and his father on the complaint of Bhupendra Kumar Pandey alleging that on 16.06.2021 while coming from Shantipuram towards Ghori Road, his motorcycle was knocked down by Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi by his car and that Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and his father allegedly fired bullets on him.\n\nWhile the aforesaid cases were registered against Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi, gang rape case was registered on 24.05.2022 against Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, Advocate & his associates with the following details:-\n\n(II) Case Crime No. 144 of 2022 under \nSections 376-D\n, \n328\n, \n504\n, \n506\n I.P.C. Police Station Phaphamau, District Prayagraj (placed at serial no.45 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: The victim-X in her statement under \nSection 161\n Cr.P.C. reiterated the facts narrated in the complaint. Accused-Wasim was arrested in this the matter. However, in her statement recorded under \nSection 164\n Cr.P.C. she did not mention the name of Wasim. She replaced the name/role of Wasim with Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, Advocate. Accordingly, a report under \nSection 169\n Cr.P.C. was filed and Wasim was released from jail. The case is still under investigation.\n\nEnquiry of CBI:- Analysis of CDRs established that mobile number 6393579462 of Ms. Mansi Srivastava complainant/victim was in regular contact with mobile no. 9335909607 of Shams Vikas and mobile no. 8787272838 used by Vinod Shanker Tripathi from 17.05.2022 to 26.05.2022. The location of this mobile number on 22.05.2022 was at Jhakarrkati Bus Station, Kanpur at 11:53:54 hours and at Prayagraj Civil Line Bus Terminal at around 17:22:31 hrs. Thereafter, the mobiles location was used to be near Teliharganj from 17:50 to 19:16 Hours. She stayed near Lok Sewa Ayog Chauraha, Allahabad from 22.05.2022 to 24.05.2022 (9:26 Hrs).\n\nAnalysis of CDRs of mobile numbers 9792866999, 7318336999 of Advocate Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, revealed that on 22.05.2022, his location was near Civil Lines area, Allahabad only. He had not visited Phaphamau on 22/23.05.2022 i.e. the date of incident. \n\nScrutiny of CDRs of mobile number 8787272838 of Vinod Shanker Tripathi revealed that on 22.05.2022, he was in contact with the victim Shams Vikas Advocate (9335909607) and Sudhakar Mishra Advocate (6394965879).\n\nScrutiny of CDRs therefore indicate that at the alleged time of rape incident , the complainant-victim was present in Civil Lines area, Prayagraj and not a Phaphamau area which is about 9 kilometers away.\n\nAdvocate Shams Vikas who is close associate of Vinod Shanker Tripathi, Advocate has confirmed that Vinod Shanker Tripathi is anguished by two false cases against him by Bhupendra Kumar Pandey and Samlagiri used the victim of Kanpur to implicate Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, his brother Arun associate Wasim and Shubham Giri son of Samalgiri in her rape case. During this period i.e. 17.05.2022 to 26.05.2022, Vinod Shanker Tripathi was also using mobile number 9335909607 of Shams Vikas to communicate the victim-X on her mobile 6393579462.\n\nVinod Shanker Tripathi, Advocate came in contact with complainant/victim as he had filed Public Interest Litigation before this Court in the matter of death of Sri Jitendra @ Kallu, the brother of the complainant/victim, Gaurav Tiwari, Junior of Shri Vinod Shanker Tripathi, confirmed the presence of Ms. Poonam Srivastava (sister of complainant/victim) with Vinod Shanker Tripathi at the residence of Sri Dineshwar Mani Tripathi (relative of Sri Vinod Shanker Tripathi) inside the Lok Sewa Ayog, premises during the relevant conspiracy period.\n\nFacts aforesaid indicate that complainant/victim in conspiracy with Vinod Shanker Tripathi lodged a false F.I.R. No. 144 of 2022 pertaining to her rape against Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, Wasim, Arun Pandey and Shubham Giri to settle the scores particularly after the registration of false cases against Vinod Shanker Tripathi at the behest of BhupendraKumar Pandey and Samlagiri and to extort money from them.\n\nImmediately after registration of above referred false gang rape case, the next day i.e. on 25.05.2022 Smt.Saira Bano wife of accused Wasim resident of Dheenpur, Mauaima Prayagraj filed an application with S.S.P. Prayagraj alleging her rape by Sri Vinod Shanker Tripathi, his father and ot hers on 24.05.2022 near Shantipuram Phaphamau, Prayagraj. Enquiry has revelased that husband of the complainant is work as Clerk (Munshi) with Advocate Bhupendra Kumar Pandey.\n\nAnother F.I.R. No. 424 of 2022 dated 04.08.2022 under \nSection 420\n IPC. Police Station Civil Lines, District Prayagraj was registered on the complaint of Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey against Vinod Shanker Tripathi and his father alleging manipulation of theHigh Court Order. He got another FIR No. 447 of 202 dated 31.08.2022 under \nSections 147\n, \n149\n, \n148\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n, \n395\n I.P.C. Police Station Colonelganj, District Prayagraj against Sri Vinod Shanker Tripathi, and four othes alleging beating/abuse (maarpeet) in District Court premises.\n\nFindings of CBI:- The above mentioned facts established that the rivalry between Sri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey and Sri Vinod shanker Tripathi, Advocates had led to registration of number of criminal cases against both of them and their associates. Enquiry has revealed that out of 8 cases at least 03 cases i.e. F.I.R. Nos. 150 of 2021, Police Station Daraganj District Prayagraj, F.I.R. No. 144 of 2022 Police Station Phaphamau, District Prayagraj against Sri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, Advocate and F.I.R. No. 105 of 2022 Police Station Daraganj, District Prayagraj lodged against Vinod Shanker Tripathi, Advocate do not appear to be based on true facts.\n\n(III) Case Crime No. 617/2018 U/s 376, 506, 313, 380 \nIPC\n of Police Station- Mauaima Prayagraj. (placed at serial no.44 in the preceding paragraph no.7) The Enquiry has revealed that Sri. Ashish Kumar Mishra whose petition no. 17706 of 2019 was clubbed with the petition of Smt. Nikki Devi, is practicing as an Advocate in the Allahabad High Court. He has alleged that he has been falsely implicated in this matter. \n\nThe aforesaid F.I.R was registered against Akash Kumar and his brother Dharmendra by the victm on the allegation that Akash Kumar had raped and both had looted her. Sri Sudhakar Mishra, Advocate was the lawyer of the victim in that matter Shri Prabhat Kumar Mishra, Advocate is a close associate of Shri Sudhakar Mishra, Advocate.\n\nSri Ashish Mishra was appearing before the High Court on behalf of Dharayandra Mishra and others. He stated that on 04.10.2018, he was threatened by Advocate Sunil Kumar and Advocate, Ajay Kumar Mishra on behalf of Prabhat Kumar Mishra that he should not appear before the High Court in the said matter otherwise he would face the consequences. Sri Krishna Kumar Shukla, Senior of Shri Ashish Mishra was also threatened to refrain from appearing in related matters filed by Sh Ramesh Kumar Ojha, Advocate (maternal uncle of Ajay Kumar Mishra) to which he acceded. However, Ashish Mishra continued to appear before the High Court on behalf of Dharayandra Mishra and others and the fact of threatening was submitted before the High Court. The same was mentioned in the order dated 12.10.2018 of the Hon'ble High Court in Transfer Application (Crl.) No. 423 of 2018.\n\nSubsequently, on the basis of statement\n u/s 164\n Cr.P.C., 1973 of rape victim in Case Crime No. 617/2018, PS Mauaima, Prayagraj, name of Ashish Kumar Mishra was added as an accused in the said case. Prosecutrix in her statement\n u/s 161\n Cr.PC had stated that she was raped by Akash Kumar and was looted by Akash and Dharmendra. However, in her subsequent statement\n u/s 164\n Cr.PC, she named Ashish Mishra and Mustqeem as additional offenders. On completion of investigation, a chargesheet was submitted on 23.02.2019 against Akash Kumar, Dharmendra Kumar and Ashish Kumar. Mustqeem was not charge-sheeted as he was living in Mumbai during the relevant period.\n\nScrutiny of statements of victim recorded under \nSections 161\n Cr.P.C. as well as statement during medical examination and and the statements 164 \nCr.P.C\n. shows glaring contradictions. Names of Ashish Mishra and Mustqeem surfaced for the first time in the statement of the victim recorded\n u/s 164\n Cr.P.C wherein she stated that both raped her after Akash. Ashish Mishra has stated that he had not visited the place of crime on the day of incident and the same has been corroborated by the tower location of his mobile numbers which shows that at the time of incident, his location was at Prayagraj and not at the scene of crime i e. village Baka Jalalpur, which is 40 km, away from the scene of crime.\n\nThe victim had divorced her first husband Vinod and married Akash, the main accused in this case. The victim on 05.07.2022.\n\nFinding of CBI:- Thus, it appears that Ashish Mishra Advocate was falsely implicated in the rape case of victim . The conduct of Sudhakar Mishra, Advocate, Ramesh Kumar Ojha, Advocate, Sunil Kumar, Advocate and Ajay Kumar Mishra, Advocate in this case appears to be suspicious.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that Shri Sudhakar Mishra is an Advocate, who practising in Allahabad. It has been revealed that Advocates namely Ajay Kumar Mishra, Prabhat Kumar Mishra, Dheeraj Kumar Pandey Anurag Mishra, Satish Kumar Shukla, Ashutosh Shukla, Ramesh Kumar Ojha (maternal uncle of Ajay Kumar Mishra), Varun Shukla, Vishvambhar Nath and Aditya Kumar Mishra are associates of Sri Sudhakar Mishra, Advocate. He is native of village Chhata PS Mauaima Prayagraj and Diwakar Prasad Mishra, elder brother of Sudhakar Mishra is active in local Panchayat.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that the group led by Diwakar Prasad Mishra, brother of Sudhakar Mishra is opposed to another group led by Sh. Devanand Yadav in the local Panchyat politics of Village-Chhata. Due to this political rivalry between these two groups, a number of cases were got registered by these rival groups at PS Mauaima. Details of these cases are as under:\n\n(IV) Case Crime No. 179/2016 dated 29.06.2016 U/s 147, 148, 149, 364, 302, 201 \nIPC\n of Police Station: Mauaima, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.26 in the preceding paragraph no.7) \n \nFindings of State Police: Charge-sheet was filed against all 05 FIR named accused persons\n u/s 147\n, \n148\n, \n149\n, \n364\n, \n302\n and \n201\n IPC. On conclusion of trial, all five accused were convicted vide order dated 08.05.2021 and sentenced for life imprisonment by the trial court and presently they are lodged in the Naini Jail, Allahabad\n \nEnquiry of CBI: The complainant and 04 accused persons are neighbours while accused Devanand Yadav is the husband of Pradhan (Pradhan Pati) of their village. Pradhan of the village allotted Govt. Land on Lease to Santlal, Rajbahdur and Ramsevak equally. Davanand Yadav in the capacity of Pradhan Pati helped Santlal to get the possession of patta of said Land from Rajbahadur in the presence of Revenue Officer on 11.05.2016. Diwakar Mishra was having election rivalry with Santlal and Devanand Yadav as wife of Devanand Yadav defeated Diwakar Mishra's wife.\n\nBefore the murder case, The daughter-in-law of Raj Bahadur i.e. the Sunita lodged rape FIR No 176/2016 dated 26.06.2016 U/s 376 \nIPC\n relating to commission of rape upon her minor daughter alleging that Anil Kumar (13 years old) S/o Sant Lal committed rape upon the victim aged about 07 years on 05.06.2016. Sunita got her treated by local doctor and lodged FIR after 21 days of the alleged rape Anil Kumar was arrested on 27.06.2016. On 28.06.2016, allegation of rape could not be confirmed in the medical examination of the victim She was called by the Medical Officer, the next day le. on 29.06.2016. However, before the victim could appear before the medical examiner/ doctor, she was murdered in the intervening night of 28/29.06.2016. The IO of the State Police did not examine Doctor Bal Govind who was consulted to treat Babita on 05.06.2016 and afterwards.\n\nThe witnesses cited by the State Police namely Ramsevak, Satyaprakash and Makhan Lal confirmed the suspicious presence and movement of Ramesh, Sunita, Jeetlal @ Chutnu and Ram Sunder at the house of Raj Bahadur on the night of 28.06.2016, and at the field of Santlal where Babita's body was found.\n\nAnil s/o Basantlal (brother of Sant Lal) had alleged that Sudhakar Mishra and Diwakar Mishra (both brothers) took money from him promising him that they will get his father Basant Lal released as their target was Devanand Yadav and not his family members.\n\nDuring investigation by State Police, clothes of the victim which were worn by the victim at the time of alleged rape and murder, were not sent for Forensic examination. During the trial, the lady doctor who had examined victim stated that injuries relating to the rape upon 7 year old child, were not found on the body. Further, the medical examination of accused Anil who was a minor i.e. aged 13 years at the time of incident to ascertain whether he was competent for sexual activity or not, is not on record.\n\nAccording to Post mortem report, food in the stomach of the victim was not fully digested. She was murdered within 03 hours after having her last meal. As per the Doctor who had conducted the post mortem, the general time of food digestion is around 04 hours and in the case of minor girl, it would be less than 04 hours. If she was kidnapped at around 1.30 AM and murdered later on, it means she had had her food not before 10.30 PM. But in her statements Sunita and Rajbahadur had stated that all family members had slept around 08-09 PM at that night which indicate that they must have taken their dinner by that time. It means Babita was murdered before 12.30 AM, not after 01:30 AM which was the time of her abduction. Investigation on this aspect was not conducted.\n\nSimilarly, no investigation regarding movement/ presence of all 05 accused persons at the time of incident was conducted, as residence of Devanand Yadav is situated in other village ie Chhata which is more than 02 KM away from the scene of crime. Motive in respect of Devanand Yadav to kill the victim/deceased is absent.\n\nAccording to FIR, family of the victim/deceased first informed State Police through dial 100 about kidnapping of the victim/deceased. The records of dial 100 and statement of the concerned official are not on record.\n\nSmt. Sunita, mother of the deceased died around 02 months ago due to cancer as stated by her father in Law.\n\nFinding of the C.B.I:- It is a fact that a minor girl was murdered.

They revealed that there was a property dispute due to which this case was got registered. When the victims were brought for their Medico Legal Examination, they refused the same in writing to the Medical Officer. Accordingly, the State Police filed a closure report dated 02.03.2022 before the Court of Ld. Special Judge, SC/ST, Prayagraj.\n\nFindings of CBI:- Enquiry has revealed that earlier another FIR No. 0679 of 2021 dated 03.12.2021 U/s 376-D, 323, 504, 506 and \nSection 3(2)(v)\n of SC/ST Act was lodged by victim Diwakar Mishra & his two other associates, all residents of Chhata, Mau Aima, Prayagraj alleging that the victim was raped by them on 17.11.2021 and 01.12.2021 However, during CBI enquiry, victim stated that she was molested by the accused and not raped by them.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that Shubhash @ Kallu, brother of complainant had been working as labourer at the residence of Diwakar Mishra and Sudhakar Mishra for the last 7-8 years. In response to the above mentioned FIR No. 679/2021 lodged by victim against Diwakar Mishra and his associates, the present FIR no. 680/2021 was got lodged through Anita against Surendra Kumar (husband of victim) & 5 others for creating pressure on victim as well as on Dharmendra Yadav @ Babloo. It has also been revealed that with the efforts of Smt Sushma Bharti, a local politician and Shri Ram Tirth Yadav, Gram Pradhan, Mau Aima, a compromise was arrived at between the complainant and accused persons of both these cases. As a result, both the complainants agreed to withdraw the cases on the basis of investigation and statements recorded u/s 161 and\n u/s 164\n Cr.PC, 1973 of the complainants wherein they had denied the incidents of rape and stated that FIRs were lodged due to property disputes, Closure Reports dated 02.03.2022 were filed in both the cases with the recommendations for action\n u/s 182 (1)\n Cr.PC against the complainants of both the cases.\n\nFindings of the C.B.I:- Thus, both the FIRs No. 679/21 and 680/21 of PS Mau Aima are not based on genuine facts and were registered due to enmity between Diwakar Prasad Mishra/ Sudhakar Mishra and Dharmendra Yadav @ Babloo and their supporters.\n\n(VI) Case Crime No. 233/2007 dated 22.08.2008 U/s 198(Ka), 323, 504, 506, 452, 307, 394, 147, 148 \nIPC\n PS Mau Aima, Allahabad. (placed at serial no.4 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: Chargesheet has been filed by State Police before the competent Court\n \nEnquiry of CBI: The accused have stated that no such incident had taken place and that due to the political rivalry, this FIR was filed by Sh. Diwakar Mishra against them. It has come to notice that accused Balbir Singh Yadav was only 11 years old at the time of incident.\n\nShri Harikesh Pandey, an accused in his statement stated that some quarrel had taken place. He stated that he was in his house when he heard a loud hue and cry. He went to the spot and saw Devanand and other people near the house of Banshi Mishra Soon after police came and took away Diwakar with them on motor cycle. He was not involved in the fight but had been made as an accused\n \nFinding of the CBI:- From the statements of both parties and independent witnesses and documents available on record it is inferred that some fight had actually taken place between Diwakar and Devanand on the date of incident. Role of accused can at best be appreciated during the trial.\n\n(VII) Case Crime No. 112 of 2010 dated 10.03.2010 U/s 307, 323, 504, 506, 324 \nIPC\n of Police Station:- Mauaima, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.5 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: On conclusion of investigation, State police filed chargesheet against Devanand Yadav. The other accused Lavkush committed suicide during investigation. The accused has been convicted after trial.\n\nFindings of CBI: Diwakar Mishra handed over the judgement dated 04.07.2012 of the A.D.J., Allahabad. Perusal of the judgement revealed that Devanand Yadav was convicted for 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. The said time period of punishment has already expired on 03.07.2022. Since, a judicial finding is already on record in this case, one of the accused namely Lavkush Vishvakarma had expired during investigation and the other accused Devanand Yadav has completed his sentence pursuant to the judicial verdict, no further enquiry was conducted as of now.\n\n(VIII) Case Crime No. 270 of 2019 dated 18.06.2019 U/s 147, 323, 392, 504, 506 of \nIPC\n and 7 of \nCriminal Law Amendment Act\n 1932 of Police Station: Mauaima, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.27 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: After completion of investigation chargesheet dated 23.10.2019\n u/s 147\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n IPC was filed against Dharmendra Kumar Yadav & 17 others. The matter is under trial. Accused Om Prakash Patel and Punwasi Bind were not chargesheeted.\n\nFindings of CBI: During the course of enquiry it is revealed that there was an election for allotment of Government Food Shop in Gram Panchyat Chhata. There were two candidates vying for the Government shop, one was Shri Ram Bahadur Bind (who was supporter of Dharmendra Yadav @ Babloo whose mother was Gram Pradhan of Chhata) and other was Shri Chedi Patel (who was supporter of Diwakar & Sudhakar Mishra). During the course of election, the differences between two opposite parties led to the fight amongst the villagers.\n\nEnquiry further revealed that a cross FIR No. 271 of 2019. PS Mau Aima, u/s 147, 223 and 506 \nIPC\n was lodged by Smt. Kanchan Devi W/o Munshi Lal @ Chinni, Rio Vill. Chhataa Prayagraj against Diwakar Mishra, Sudhakar Mishra & 3 others alleging that her husband (Shri Munshi Lal Patel) was badly beaten by the accused persons. This case has also been charge sheeted. Thus trial of both the cases is pending in the Court at Prayagraj and the role of respective accused can be appreciated during the course of trial.\n\n(IX). Case Crime No. 142/2012 dated 08.05.2012 U/s 149, 323, 452, 504, 308, 508, 506 \nIPC\n PS Mau Aima, Allahabad.(placed at serial no.23 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: Details are awaited from State Police. Case was charge sheeted U/s 323, 324, 504, 506, 308 \nIPC\n.\n\nFindings of CBI: Complainant Sudhakar and Shobhnath (main accused) were having a land dispute between them. On 08.05.2012, at about 17:00 hrs Diwakar and Shobhnath came across each other at the Tea shop of Ashok Jaiswal, Chhata Chaurah and an argument ensued which led to a fight amongst them. The incident had taken place, role of individual accused persons can be looked into during the course of trial.\n\n(X) Case Crime No. 416 of 2011 dated 23.10.2011 U/s 147, 392, 452, 504, 506 and 427 \nIPC\n and \nSection 7\n CLA of Police Station: Mauaima, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.6 in the preceding paragraph no.7).\n\nFindings of State Police: Chargesheet dated 28.11.2011 was filed against Doodh Nath & 8 other all residents of Village- Gharauta, Police Station.

But Shri Diwakar Mishra had not only named the persons involved in the quarrel in his complaint but also named the supporters of rival group of his village- Chhata who were actually not present in the fair.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that during the trial of the instant case, all the witnesses including the complainant turned hostile and the learned Court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, Allahabad vide judgment and order dated 12.09.2014 acquitted all the accused persons.\n\n(XI). Case Crime No. 30/2013 dated 01.02.2013 U/s 506, 507, 115, 120- B \nIPC\n of Police Station: Shivkuti, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.9 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: After investigation chargesheet dated 07.04.2013 was filed before the concerned trial Court. The case is presently under trial.\n\nFinding of CBI: Nothing incriminating has surfaced during the course of enquiry conducted so far to question the findings of State Police in the matter.\n\n(XII) Case Crime No. 97 of 2022 dated 05.03.2022 U/s 147, 323, 504, 506, 452 and 427 \nIPC\n of Police Station: Mauaima, Prayagraj: (placed at serial no.23 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: This case is still under investigation\n \nEnquiry of CBI: It has been revealed that on 04.03.2022.

Vijay Kumar, Driver of Sudhakar Mishra stated that only altercation had taken place and none was beaten/ threatened. He has also stated that Rakesh Mishra, Sushil Mishra and Piyush Mishra were not present at the time of altercation. He has further revealed that it is not correct that Rakesh Mishra, Sushil Mishra, Piyush Mishra, Chhaya Mishra and Neetu Mishra entered into the house of Sudhakar Mishra and beaten up the family members and also damaged the property.\n\nThe accused persons have stated that on 05.03.2022, on the issue of passage of tractor through the fields of Rakesh Mishra, the family members of Diwakar Mishra entered into the house of Rakesh Mishra and beaten his family members. Despite the fact that the family members of Rakesh Mishra were beaten, FIR was lodged by Diwakar Prasad Mishra against them. Piyush Mishra Slo Sushil Mishra has stated that at the time and date of incident, he was at Prayagraj for coaching and he was not aware about the incident.\n\nEnquiry further revealed that in the same matter, a cross FIR No. 101 of 2022 dated 09.03.2022\n u/s 147\n, \n452\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n and \n354\n IPC was lodged by Shri Rakesh Mishra at Police Station. Mau Aima, Prayagraj against Diwakar Mishra brother of Sudhakar Mishra and 6 others.\n\nFinding: On the basis of above facts, it appears that Shri Sudhakar Mishra and his family members were the agressors but got an FIR registered against the victim by misrepresenting the facts. Subsequently, a counter case has also been registered by the other party on the same incident. Both these cases are still under investigation.\n\n(XIII) Case Crime No. 218/2012 U/s 279/337/338 \nIPC\n. Police Station: Shivkuti, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.19 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police and present status of the case: The alleged incident was found truthful and FIR named accused Ramesh Kumar was charge-sheeted.\n\nFindings of CBI: Nothing has come on record during the course of enquiry conducted so far to contradict the chargesheet filed by State Police\n \n(XIV). Case Crime No. 154/2016 dated 10.09.2016 U/s 147, 323, 447, 452, 504, 506, 427 \nIPC\n Police Station: Baharia, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.11 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: On conclusion of investigation, chargesheet was filed against the FIR named accused person U/s 147, 323, 447, 452, 504, 506, 427 \nIPC\n. The case is under trial.\n\nEnquiry of CBI: Enquiry has revealed that Om Prakash borrowed Rs 1.6 lacs from Radheshyam and purchased a piece of Abadi land from Bhola Harijan on 08.09.2016. He was constructing a boundary wall on the said land on 10.09.2016. When Prabhat Mishra got to know about this, he reached his village with his associates and beaten Om Prakash Mishra and demolished the said boundary. The piece of said land does not belong to Prabhat Kumar Mishra. Prabhat Kumar Mishra objected to the said construction because he was annoyed at the said deal which was done without his knowledge. Further, he had some land disputes with Om Prakash Mishra and Bhola separately.\n\nThe said incident took place but the incident was represented with distorted facts. Actually, Prabhat Kumar Mishra and his associates lodged another FIR No. 299/2016 dated 10.09.2016 against Om Prakash Mishra & others U/s 447, 507, 506 \nIPC\n Police Station: Shivkuti, Prayagraj before reaching his village Hariram Patti @Katnai, where they had beaten Om Prakash Mishra and demolished his boundary and also lodged an FIR against Om Prakash Mishra & others as victim of this case.\n\nDuring investigation, the State Police had not collected CDRs of the accused persons. No efforts were made to find out the truth by knowing the location of accused persons as one of the accused persons Sushil Kumar is the employee of IFFCO, Phoolpur Prayagraj. He was present at home within the premises of IFFCO and was in office from 02:00 PM to 06:00 PM at his work at IFFCO on the relevant day.\n\nFinding: Prabhat Kumar Mishra alongwith his associates Sudhakar Mishra and others, reached Prabhat's village. Prabhat and his advocates outnumbered his opponents Om Prakash & others. They beat Om Prakash and demolished his boundary wall. Though Prabhat appears to be the offender and did the crime but he represented himself as victim and lodged two FIRs against Om Prakash Mishra and others on that day.\n\n(XV) Case Crime No. 277 / 2017 dated 14.09.2017\n u/s 323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n of IPC Police Station: Shivkuti, Prayagraj: (placed at serial no.15 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: The State Police chargesheeted the FIR named accused persons on the basis of oral evidence of Shiv Kumar Gupta and Vijay Pandey. The matter is under trial.\n\nFindings of CBI: The FIR named accused persons have denied that any such incident took place. Witnesses, Shiv Kumar Gupta and Vijay Pandey are close associates of Prabhat Kumar Mishra and the veracity of their statements cannot be verified at this stage ile. after more than 05 years of the alleged incident and the threats about registration of false cases against him and others. Since the case is under trial, the roles of respective accused can be better appreciated by the Ld. Trial Court.\n\n(XVI) Case Crime No.299/2016 under \nSections 447\n, \n507\n, \n506\n IPC Police Station: Shivkuti, Prayagraj: -(placed at serial no.10 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: The alleged incident was found to be false and IO filed the closure report in this matter.\n\nFinding of CBI: Nothing incriminating has surfaced so far during the course of enquiry to question the finding of \nState Police\n \n(XVII\n) Case Crime No. 381/2017 dated 20.04.2017 U/s 506 \nIPC\n Police Station: Colonelganj, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.29 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: During investigation, the alleged incident of SMS was found truthful and Harshu Prasad was chargesheeted accordingly. The case is under trial.\n\nFindings of CBI: Nothing incriminating has surfaced during the enquiry to question the findings of the \nState Police\n \n(XVIII\n) Case Crime No. 47/2016 (NCR) dated 22.09.2016 U/s 323, 504, 427 \nIPC\n, Police Station: Kydganj Prayagraj (placed at serial no.12 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police and present status of the case: After concluding investigation, state police chargesheeted FIR named accused\n u/s 323\n, \n504\n, \n427\n IPC on 26.11.2016.\n\nEnquiry of CBI: Enquiry revealed that all the FIR named accused persons were not given the opportunity to explain their version regarding the alleged incident. On being shown the notice\n u/s 41(1)\n of Cr.P.C., 1973 accused Om Prakash Mishra denied his signatures on the said notice. Accused Dharayandra Mishra was not contacted by the IO regarding this case. However, in the case diary it is mentioned that Dharayandra Mishra had refused to put his signatures on the notice\n u/s 41(1)\n Cr.P.C., 1973 Accused Harshu Mishra was called by IO of this case at IO's residence near Kutchehry. When he reached there, he got to know that Prabhat Kumar Mishra had lodged an FIR as mentioned above He informed the IO that the alleged incident was false and at the alleged time of incident he was present at his work place. He was assured by the IO that he would do fair investigation and asked him to sign notice\n u/s 41(1)\n Cr.P.C.. 1973 Signatures of Harshu (as per his version) were taken by the IO on blank notice\n u/s 41(1)\n Cr.P.C. 1973.\n\nFurther, CDRs of the accused persons, the complainant and the witnesses namely Vikas Shukla, Satya Sakshi Tiwari, Nangi Lal were not taken to establish the exact locations of the concerned person to find out the truth. One of the accused Harshu Prashad, Helper in NCR, Allahabad was attending his duties at Chivki Railway Station from 2.00 pm to 10.00 pm on the date of incident. Hence, the allegation of the complainant that he was beaten up by Harshu Prasad & others on 21.09.2016 at around 19:00 PM did not appear to be correct.\n\nFinding: Therefore, this case lodged by Prabhat Kumar Mishra against his rivals Harshu Mishra, Om Prakash Mishra and Dharayandra Mishra might be a motivated case in which investigation does not appear to have been conducted appropriately by the State Police. \n\n(XIX) Case Crime No. 557/2017 U/s 147, 323, 504, 506, 427, 394 \nIPC\n, Police Station: Cantt. Prayagraj (placed at serial no.18 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: The state police filed closure report in this case.\n\nEnquiry of CBI: Enquiry has revealed that on 16.11.2017 at around 10:00 AM Dr. Ramesh Singh Thakur was abused and beaten by Prabhat Kumar Mishra, Sudhakar Mishra, Satish Shukla and Ajay Mishra, all advocates because Dr. Ramesh Singh Thakur had refused to entertain them in issuing forged medical certificate. Dr. Thakur was misbehaved and brutally beaten by them. His FIR could not be registered till night as there was tremendous pressure from Prabhat Kumar Mishra, Sudhakar Mishra and their associates. After intervention by District Magistrate, Prayagraj Cant. Police registered FIR No. 553/2017 U/s 352, 353, 332, 504, 506, 427, 511 \nIPC\n and u/s 3 Medicare Act late in the night.\n\nAfter registration of this FIR. Dr. Ramesh Thakur stated that he was pressurised to withdraw his FIR. When he denied. Prabhat Kumar Mishra and Sudhakar Mishra lodged this false FIR No. 557 /2017 dated 17.11.2017 U/s 147, 323, 504, 506, 427, 394 \nIPC\n against Dr. Ramesh Thakur and Dr. Dwivedi to compel him to compromise in this matter.\n\nDespite knowing the facts, Police lodged the false cross FIR under pressure from Advocate Prabhat Kumar Mishra, Sudhakar Mishra and their associates. As there was no other way left for Dr. Ramesh Thakur, he compromised with Prabhat Kumar Mishra and Sudhakar Mishra. IO Brijesh Kumar Gautam, SI filed the closure report mentioning that he was unable to find the name and address of the accused persons.\n\nFinding of the C..B.I.: Thus, this case appears to have been falsely lodged by Prabhat Kumar Mishra and Sudhakar Mishra against Dr. R.S. Thakur to compel him to withdraw FIR No. 553/2017 lodged by Dr. Ramesh Singh Thakur against them.\n\n(XX) Case Crime No. 361/2016 dated 26.10.2016\n u/s 147\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n and \n379\n of IPC and \nSection 3(2) (v)\n of SC & ST Act. Police Station: Shivkuti, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.13 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: IO received the affidavit of four advocates namely Mayank Mishra, Shivji, Rakesh Kumar and Rajesh Kumar regarding the truthfulness of the incident as alleged by Sunil Kumar in the capacity of eyewitness of the incident disclosing the name of two unknown persons as Ashutosh Mishra S/o Harshu Prashad and Suraj Mishra S/o Om Prakash Thereafter, their names were added as accused in the case. On conclusion of investigation, charge-sheet was filed against Rohit Mishra, Om Prakash, Dharmendra Kumar, Harshu Prashad Ashutosh Mishra and Suraj Mishra\n u/s 147\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n and \n379\n of IPC and \nSection 3(2) (v)\n of SC & ST Act. The case is presently under trial.\n\nEnquiry of CBI: The complainant Sunil Kumar was saved by Shivji & others from beating as per FIR However, four advocates as eyewitness to the incident gave affidavits to IO subsequently The names of three advocates out of four were not mentioned in the said complaint although all three advocates are well known to the complainant. It raises suspicion as to why complainant had forgotten their names at the time of filing of the complaint. Dharayandra Kumar is the junior of Sh. Girja Pati Tripathi, Advocate and was present with him during the day at the court on the date of incident. At the time of incident i.e. from 05:00 PM to 05:45 PM, Dharayandra Kumar was with him at his work place ie seat no. 15, 84 Khambha District Court, Prayagraj. At that time there were other advocates namely Ramesh Kumar Tiwari, K.Κ. Shukla, S.K. Tripathi, A.K. Mishra, S.K. Mishra and A.K. Rai who were also present at his work place. Sh.

Abhishek Shukla had given his affidavit regarding presence of Rohit Mishra in Jhalwa College, Allahabad at the time of alleged incident. Principal of School gave certificate regarding presence of Suraj Mishra in the school at the time of incident.\n\nFinding of the C.B.I.: IO of State Police did not make any effort to establish the truthfulness of the incident. No CDR of alleged accused persons or the complainant and the four advocates who gave the affidavits in the capacity of eyewitness were obtained. Suraj Mishra was just 14 years old boy (born on 25.07.2002) at that time. He was chargesheeted as adult not as juvenile.\n\nSunil Kumar had received 1.5 lacs as Govt. compensation in this case.\n\n(XXI) Case Crime No. 90/2021 dated 01.03.2021 U/s 342, 376D, 506 \nIPC\n of Police Station:-Mauaima, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.39 in the preceding paragraph no.7)\n \nFindings of State Police: On the basis of victim's statement recorded\n u/s 164\n Cr.P.C., 1973 accused Md.

When the Court of Judicial Magistrate called for the police to report in the matter of rape of Archana Singh, Police filed a report dated 21.01.2020 stating that allegations of rape were found to be false.\n\nIn response to the above mentioned application, on 03.12.2020, Wasim Ali through his counsel Rakesh Nath Pandey, Advocate filed an application\n u/s 156(3)\n Cr.P.C. against Smt. Archana Singh, Awdhesh Singh, Brijesh Shukla, Rajesh Shukla, Ram Sajiwan Patel and Radheysham Saroj alleging that they had filed an application\n u/s 156(3)\n Cr.P.C. to lodge an FIR with the malafide intention to implicate him and others in the false rape case of Archana Singh.

Rajesh Patel paid Rs. 50,000/- in cash after which Archana and Awadhesh accepted that Rajesh had been falsely implicated in said rape case which was recorded by Rajesh Patel in a video Further, Smt. Archana Singh gave an affidavit dated 25.09.2021 stating that Rajesh Patel had not committed any offence and his name was included by mistake.\n\nAnother accused Shri Chandra Bhushan Singh is brother of Sh. Awadhesh Singh, husband of Smt. Archana Singh. Sh. Awadhesh Singh and his wife demanded money from him and his wife; threatening him that otherwise he would be implicated in the false rape case by Smt. Archana Singh. He did not pay any money. therefore, he was implicated in the false rape case by Archana Singh. Chandra Bhushan Singh was sent to Jail in this case.\n\nWhen he was in Jail, Awadhesh Singh demanded Rs. 1 lac from Devraj Pandey @ Bhola (his friend) and Balendra Bhushan @ Lal (his elder brother) for removing his name from the alleged rape case.

Archana Singh gave an affidavit dated 23.05.2022 stating that Deva had not committed any offence and his name was included by mistake \n \nArchana Singh had given an affidavit that Samlagiri was not involved in her rape case.\n\nDue to filing of the case in the court of CO Sadar Allahabad (now Prayagraj) regarding illegal possession on Govt. land (ie Talab & Naveen Parti land) by Ram Sajiwan Patel and Rajesh Shukla by Inderdev Prasad, Wasim and Brijesh Kumar enmity was created between both the groups.

(placed at serial no.9 in the preceding paragraph no.11).\n\nFindings of State Police: In this case Police had filed chargesheet against Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi on 29.03.2022.\n\nFindings of CBI: Enquiry has revealed that Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and Smt. Kusum Lata were known to each other previously. Smt. Kusum Lata offered her own disputed residential plot No. 2/2/2R, Sapru Marg Cuil Line Prayagraj to Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi for purchase. At that time Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and Shri Bhupendra Pandey were good friends and both agreed to jointly purchase this residential plot at No. 2/2/2R, Sapru Marg for Rs. 20 lacs. They entered into an agreement to sale dated 13.11.2018 with Smt. Kusum Lata and an advance of Rs. 50001/- was paid to her.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that Sri Bhupendra Pandey and Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi mutually agreed by that the ground floor will be used for chambers/offices and parking space for both and the first and second floor will be used by them as residence.

After completion of construction Sri Bhupendra Pandey got the sale deed executed on 25.02.2020 for first floor and on the same day Smt. Kusum Lata executed a new agreement to sale with Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi for second floor. Till then Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi had paid Rs. 5.5 lacs to Smt. Kusum Lata and took some more time for making balance payment to her.\n\nHowever, dispute arose between them with regard to the clearance of the respective dues. Some part of the property was occupied by Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey and later Sri Vinod Shankar Tripathi occupied the other part of the property which was lying vacant. This was not to the liking of Sri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey who felt that he had born the cost of construction of the property himself without fully receiving the consideration from Sri Vinod Shanker Tripathi, \n \nEnquiry has further revealed that in November 2020, when Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi asked Smt. Kusum Lata for registration of sale deed for second floor of above mentioned property. She asked him to first clear the dues of Shri Bhupendra Pandey, which were incurred on construction of house.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that since the sale consideration was not fully paid by Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi to the vendor Smt. Kusum Lata but the former took the property in his possession, Smt. Kusum Lata lodged FIR No. 558 of 2021 at PS- Civil Lines, Prayagraj U/s 147, 447, 323, 504 \nIPC\n and 3(2)(v) \nSC & ST Act\n against Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and his family members on 29.06.2021 for criminal trespass and forcible occupation. In this case, charge-sheet has been filed against Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi, Advocate in the Competent Court which is under trial.

During investigation, the State Police had recovered Rs 1,00,000/- from accused persons and State Police has filed chargesheet against Shri Mukhtar Ahmad, Miss Khushboo and Smt. Reshma on 26.11.2022. The incident appears to be genuine.\n\n(X) Case Crime No. 114 / 2022 dated 21.04.2022 U/s 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506, 307 \nIPC\n, Police Station: Phaphamau, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.12 in the preceding paragraph no.11).\n\nFindings of State Police: Investigation by State Police established that the alleged incident was false and a closure report dated 05.06.2022 was filed in this matter.\n\nFindings of CBI: During enquiry Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey has stated that between 3.00 pm to 4.00 pm, he met with an accident on 16.06.2021 at Gohari More, Phaphamau, Prayagraj when his motorcycle was hit by a red car driven by Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi, his father Shri Vijay Shankar Tripathi and some unknown persons. When he fell down both Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and Shri Vijay Shankar Tripathi fired bullets at him. Luckily the bullets did not hit him.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that on 16.06.2021 Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey received first aid at 3.35 pm at Community Health Centre, Chaka, Naini, Prayagraj reportedly after a Road Side Accident. He was referred to SRN Hospital, Prayagraj. However, at 5.30 pm on 16.06.2021 he was admitted and took treatment at Priti Nursing and Maternity Home, George Town, Prayagraj. He was relieved from the hospital on 20.06.2021.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that FIR on the incident was registered on the complaint of Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey on 21.04.2022.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that the reported site of accident at Gohari More, Phaphamau, Prayagraj was about 35 Km from Community Health Centre, Chaka, Naini, Prayagraj and Priti Nursing and Maternity Home, George Town, Prayagraj lies in between about 25 Km from Community Health Centre (CHC), Chaka.\n\nThe CDR analysis of mobiles of Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi & his father Shri Vijay Shankar Tripathi has revealed that between 3.00 P.M. 4.00 P.M. on 16.06.2021, their locations were as under:\n\ni. Shri Vijay Shankar Tripathi (Mob no. 9935341097) was mostly located in the vicinity of Krishna Dev Chaurasiya Arazi No.- 394 to 397, Mauza- Mahdauri Uparhar, Teliarganj, Rasulabad, Prayagraj. However, his location was not available during the period between 3.00 P.M. 4.00 P.M. on 16.06.2021.\n\nii. Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi (Mob No. 8787272838 & 9956487136), for the time period between 3.00 P.M. 4.00 P.M. on 16.06.2021, he was located in the vicinity of (a) A-189, Mahdauri Colony, Teliarganj, Prayagraj (b) Arazi No. 394 to 397, Mauza- Mahdauri. Uparhar, Teliarganj, Rasulabad, Prayagraj.\n\nThe location of Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi was about 9.0 Km from the reported point of accident. Hence, the allegation of Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey that both Shri Vinod Shankar Pandey and Shri Vijay Shankar Pandey were instrumental in causing his accident at Gohari More, Phaphamau, Prayagraj does not appear to be true.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that on 16.06.2021, Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey was using mobile number 9792866999. Scrutiny of the CDR of this number has revealed that at 12.40.57 hrs on 16.06.2021, he was near his residence at Stanley Road, Civil Lines, Prayagraj. Thereafter, he moved towards Dandi, Prayagraj and remained stationed in that area till 07.26.59 P.M.. The CHC (Community Health Centre). Chaka is located in that area Thereafter, he moved to George Town area in the vicinity of Priti Nursing & Maternity Hospital, Georgetown.\n\nOn the basis of the medical records of CHC, Chaka, Prayagraj. Priti Nursing & Maternity Hospital, Georgetown and CDR of the mobile No. 9792866999 of Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, it is clear that he must have met with road accident in Dandi / Chaka area only and was given first aid at CHC, Chaka. Thereafter, he was admitted at Priti Nursing & Maternity Hospital, Georgetown where he remained admitted till 20.06.2021. Scrutiny of CDR has also revealed that on 16.06.2021 Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey never visited the Gohari Road, Phaphamau which is more than 12 kms from his residence in a direction diagonally opposite to Chaka/Dandi, Prayagraj.\n\nThus, it appears that no such firing accident had taken place at Gohari Road, Phaphamau, Prayagraj on 16.06.2021 and the FIR was lodged on the basis of false facts.\n\n(XI). Case Crime No. 424/ 2022 dated 04.08.2022 U/s 420 \nIPC\n, Police Station: Civil Lines, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.13 in the preceding paragraph no.11)\n \nFindings of State Police: Despite lodging the FIR, the complainant Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey did not provide the alleged forged document / Court order.

He also failed to provide the said document in this enquiry despite being aware about the fact that this enquiry was being conducted on the directions of the Hon'ble High Court to ascertain the veracity of the facts. In view of the above, it is apparent that the present FIR lodged by Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey is due to his animosity with Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and the same does not appear to be based on genuine facts.\n\n(XII) Case Crime No. 447/2022 dated 31.08.2022 U/s 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506, 395, 34 \nIPC\n, Police Station: Colonelganj, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.14 in the preceding paragraph no.11).\n\nFindings of State Police: The case is presently under investigation.\n\nFindings of CBI: Enquiry revealed that on 31.08.2022 at about 02:00 PM during lunch hour, Shri Bhupendra Pandey abused Shri Prabhat Mishra that since the CBI is conducting enquiry, they are not happy and were not feeling well. On this issue, Shri Bhupendra Pandey was asked by Shri Prabhat Mishra why he was abusing in that way. On this Shri Bhupendra Pandey, his munshi Shri Wasim and 2-3 unknown persons started beating Shri Prabhat Mishra. Shri Prabhat was saved by the other Advocates of the District Court. In this regard, Case Crime No. 446/2022 U/s 147, 323, 504, 506 \nIPC\n against Shri Bhupendra Pandey and 04 unknown persons were got registered.\n\nDuring enquiry, Call Detail Records (CDRs) of mobile phones of the FIR named accused persons were obtained and it was revealed that three of them namely Shri Ramesh Chandra Ojha, Advocate, Shri Ajay Kumar Mishra, Advocate & Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi, Advocate were not present in the vicinity of scene of crime at the time of alleged incident on 31.08.2022 in the District Court (Kuchahri), Allahabad.\n\nEnquiry revealed that instant Case Crime No. 447 / 2022 dated 31.08.2022 U/s 147, 148, 149, 323, 504, 506, 395, 34 \nIPC\n was got registered by Shri Bhupendra Pandey at Police Station: Colonelganj. Prayagraj as a cross FIR of Case Crime No. 446/2022U/s 147, 323, 504, 506 \nIPC\n against Shri Bhupendra Pandey and 04 unknown persons. He also named Advocates in the FIR on the basis of false facts in order to take revenge from the Advocates who are connected with the person with whom Shri Bhupendra Pandey had dispute. Both these cases are still under investigation.\n\n(XIII) Case Crime No. 361/2021 dated 23.10.2021 U/s 279 and 304A of \nIPC\n, Police Station: Cantt., Prayagraj (placed at serial no.15 in the preceding paragraph no.11)\n \nFindings of State Police: During investigation, the State Police could not identify the vehicle causing accident and filed Closure Report No. 113/2022 dated 17.04.2022 before the Court of Ld. ACJM-17, Allahabad.\n\nFindings of CBI: Enquiry revealed that Smt. Raisa Bano, Khala (Mausi) of Shri Mohd. Harum used to live with him and on the day of incident i.e., 22.10.2021, she had left for the office of Shri Salim Shervani seeking some financial help. Shri Salim Shervani was a known person of the area extending help to the poor. When she did not return by late night, the complainant thought that she might had gone to her home situated at Phaphamau and contacted her neighbours at Phaphamau who informed him that two Police personnel had visited her house and informed that his mausi had met with an accident. When complainant reached the Police Station- Cantt, he came to know that his mausi had expired in the road accident.\n\nShri Harun subsequently visited the place of accident and tried to identify the vehicle which had hit his Khala (Mausi). After 5-6 days, the complainant again visited PS- Cantt. Where he was informed by IO of the case that as per CCTV footage his Khala (Mausi) was hit by a motorcycle ridden by an Advocate aged about 40-42 years.\n\nThereafter, Mohd. Harun contacted Shri Arun Kumar Srivastava. Advocate and informed him about the circumstances. After about 2- 2% months, Shri Arun Srivastava contacted Harun and told him to go to the place of incidence where some person might inform about the registration number of vehicle which caused the accident. When he visited at the place of accident, a person riding a scooter came and gave him a piece of paper mentioning the vehicle number of the vehicle which hit his Khala (Mausi). Thereafter, with the help of Shri Arun Kumar Srivastava, Advocate he submitted an application mentioning the vehicle number to the SSP, Prayagraj and also made an application for claim before the L earned Court.\n\nDuring enquiry, Shri Mohd Harun has submitted that registration details of the vehicle UP 70 CE 8529 was submitted by him on 05.01.2022 to the SSP, Prayagraj. This motorcycle was registered in the name of Shri Vibhav Shankar Tripathi, brother of Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi, Advocate.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that the Case Diaries do not mention time of the incident on 22.10.2021. On the basis of the statement of witnesses it is apparent that the accident had taken place in the afternoon of 22.10.2021.\n\nDuring enquiry CDR of mobile number 9839422649 of Shri Mohd. Harun has revealed on 04.01.2022 he was contacted by Shri Bhupendra Pandey (Mob No. 9792866999) and the call lasted for 274 seconds. Thereafter, there were calls between Shri Mohd. Harun & his advocate Shri Arun Kumar Srivastawa& also between Shri Arun Kumar Srivastava and Bhupendra Kumar Pandey. Shri Mohd Harun has stated that on 04.01.2022 he received details of the vehicle used in the hit and run case involving his khala and the same were filed by him with Sr. SP Prayagraj on 05.01.2022. There was no previous contact between Shri Mohd Harun and Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey.\n\nThe scrutiny of the CDRs could not confirm locations of the family members of Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi to be in the vicinity of the point of accident on 22.10.2021. It is relevant here that on 04.01.2022, Shri Mohd Harun was contacted by Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey and on 05.01.2022 he had submitted the motorcycle number of Shri Vibhav Shankar Tripathi, brother of Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi to the Police alleging that the said Motorcycle was used in the hit and run case on 22.10.2021.\n\nIn view of the above it is clear that an accident had taken place in which the lady had expired. However, it is also apparent that due to his animosity with Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi, Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey had provided the registration number of the motorcycle of Shri Vibhav Tripathi.\n\n(XIV) Case Crime No. 239/2012 dated 20.07.2012 U/s 376, 354, 504, 5061PC of Police Station:Mauamia, Allahabad (placed at serial no.16 in the preceding paragraph no.11)\n \nFindings of State Police: In compliance with the orders of Ld.

After investigation of case State Police has filed closure report on 22.07.2012.\n\nFindings of CBI: Enquiry revealed that Smt. Samla Giri was earlier married to Shri Ram Sevak Giri. Due to their difference Ram Sevak Giri sold his agriculture land to one Shri Rajesh Patel, Advocate and left the village. Smt. Samla Giri, left by her husband, remained in the village and refused to hand over the possession of the agriculture land to Shri Rajesh Patel. Efforts made by Shri Rajesh Patel to obtain possession of the land purchased by him were apparently resisted by Smt. Samla Giri who filed the present FIR alleging various offences against him including her rape. Enquiry has also revealed that Smt. Samla Giri had earlier filed complaint with the PS- Mau Aima on similar allegation. However, as no case was registered on her complaint, she filed Complaint U/s 156 (3) \nCr.PC\n on which directions were issued and the present case was registered. Further, investigation by Local Police established that this FIR has been registered by Smt. Samla Giri only to create pressure on Shri Rajesh Patel to desist him from taking possession of her land. With these findings, the Local Police had closed the case recommending action against her U/s 182/211 \nIPC\n. Nothing incriminating has surfaced during the course of enquiry to question these findings of State Police.\n\n(XV).

Seeing Shri Chandra Babu Naidu, Shri Rajendra Patel @ Govardhan reached on the road alongwith tractor and came towards Shri Chandra Babu Naidu and took the keys of his motorcycle. In the meantime Smt. Samla Giri alongwith her daughter reached there and took the key of motorcycle with her. This led to altercation & exchange of blows between Shri Chandra Babu Naidu and Smt. Samla Giri. Thereafter, the instant case was got registered by Smt. Samla Giri.\n\nIn view of the above it appears that the incident had taken place. The facts of the case can be appropriately appreciated during the course of trial.\n\n(XVI) Case Crime No. 105/2022\n u/s 376-D\n, \n328\n, \n506\n I.P.C. & sec 5/6 of \nPOCSO Act\n of Police Station: Mau Aima, Prayagraj (placed at serial no.18 in the preceding paragraph no.11)\n \nEnquiry has also revealed that the modification application of Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi has mentioned the case filed by Smt.

But Savita declined to go with Vikas without marriage and did not turn up at the Railway Station.\n\nOn 18.04.2022, she came to know that Vikas was going to be married to a girl of Village- Isauta and in order to stop the marriage she alongwith her father and Bua went to PS- Meja Prayagraj and the family members of the girl were called at the Police Station and marrated her story. Thereafter, a complaint dated 19.04.2022 was lodged by Ms. Savita at Police Station Industrial Area, Prayagraj on the basis of which, the instant F.I.R. was registered.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that during investigation of above mentioned FIR, statement of Ms. Savita U/s 164 \nCr.PC\n was recorded in which she had narrated all the facts pertaining to the allegation leveled in this FIR. She also stated that Lavkush Maurya, assured her of help in the lodging of FIR in this matter and had called her at his Ishu Hospital and raped her. Shri Lavkush Maurya was arrested after her statement was recorded\n u/s 164\n Cr.P.C.\n\nIn her statement U/s 164 \nCr.PC\n dt. 09.06.2022, Ms. Savita, without mentioning any date, has stated that she was raped by Lavkush Maurya in his Ishu Hospital. During present enquiry, Ms. Savita stated that she was raped by Shri Lavkush Maurya at Ishu Hospital on 18.05.2022.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that on 25.05. 2022 Ms. Savita Devi made a written complaint to Sr. SP, Prayagraj and alleged that she had gone to Naini, Prayagraj for marketing on 20.05.2022. At about 08:00 PM, while returning from Naini she was waiting for public conveyance, when Shri Suraj brother of Vikas alongwith another person muffling his face came to her and offered to drop her in their vehicle to which she agreed. When she boarded the vehicle she was brought to an isolated place near Amilo Nahar, PS- Karchana, Prayagraj and was raped by both of them. Further, she identified that the person covering his face was Lavkush Maurya. She further mentioned in the complaint that after her rape she was left there and brought to her home by Shri Shiv Kumar, her brother-in-law and one Shri Arvind Patel of her village. In the enquiry conducted by State Police, the matter was found to be false and no FIR was lodged.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that on 30.05.2022 she filed a complaint U/s 156 (3) Cr PC before the Court of Ld. Special Judge, (SC/ST Act) Allahabad regarding the above incident about her rape by Lavkush Maurya and Suraj on 20.05.2022. The Ld. Court directed State Police (PS- Karchana, Prayagraj) to ascertain about the said rape incident and the State Police submitted a Report mentioning therein that the matter is false. Now, the matter is pending before the Ld. Special Judge, (SC/ST Act), Allahabad.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that Shiv Kumar and Shri Arvind Patel, who were witnesses cited by her in her complaint to Sr. SP. Prayagraj as well as complaint U/s 156 (3) \nCr.PC\n, have denied any such incident and not supported the version of the Ms. Savita Devi. Shri Hari Ram, father of Ms. Savita Devi has also denied any such incident of her rape by Lavkush Maurya and Suraj. It was also revealed that after filing the complaint with the Sr.SP, Prayagraj on 25.05.2022, she has not returned to her parents' house.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that she has also lodged complaint dated 06.08.2022 on the IGRS (Chief Minister portal) against Lavkush and his brother Mahendra Maurya for threatening her for life. On this complaint State Police has submitted a report that the complaint is false because accused Lavkush Maurya was in judicial custody in Case Crime No. 90/2022 of PS- Industrial Area, Prayagraj.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that after her 164 \nCr.PC\n Statement \nSection 376\n IPC and \nSection 3 (2) (v)\n of SC/ST Act were added in the instant FIR, she has been given compensation amounting to Rs. 3.75 lacs by the Govt. of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that when she came to know that CBI enquiry is to be conducted in the case lodged by her, she contacted Arvind Patel and Shiv Kumar who were cited as witnesses in the complaint filed by her U/s 156 (3) \nCr.PC\n before the Ld. Special Judge (SC/ST Act), Allahabad as well as to the Sr.SP. Shri Arvind Patel and Shiv Kumar have stated that they were offered money by her for supporting her version before CBI and were also threatened to implicate them in false cases just as Lavkush Maurya was implicated.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that initially she had lodged an FIR regarding her marriage dispute against Vikas and his family members. At the time of her statement\n u/s 164\n Cr.PC she added new facts about her rape by Lavkush Maurya without any complaint to Police.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that in her complaint dated 25.05.2022 to Sr.SP. Prayagraj and Complaint dated 30.05.2022\n u/s 156(3)\n Cr.PC before Ld. Special Court (SC/ST), Allahabad, Ms. Savita has alleged her rape by Lavkush Maurya & Suraj at Amilo Nahar, PS Karchhana on 20.05.2022. However, in her statement dated 09.06.2022 recorded\n u/s 164\n Cr.PC. Ms. Savita has stated that she was raped by Lavkush Maurya at Ishu Hospital, PS: Industrial Area, Prayagraj.\n\nThus, enquiry has revealed that the allegations made by the complainant on her dispute against Vikas & his family members appear to be correct but the allegations of her rape against Lavkush Maurya do not appear to be genuine at this stage and seems to have been made with a mala fide intention of getting financial benefits from the Government of Uttar Pradesh. She has already received Rs 3.75 lacs in this matter.\n\n(IV) Case Crime No. 91 of 2020 under \nSections 354Kh\n, \n147\n, \n148\n, \n323\n, \n308\n, \n427\n, \n452\n, \n504\n, \n506\n I.P.C.

Court against his uncles, namely, Shri Ram Pyare Lal Srivastava and Shri Subhash Srivastava. They told him a story and pressurized the complainant to file the complaint which was drafted by Sunil Kumar Srivastava, Advocate. He first time visited the Court alongwith Shri Kajulal Srivastava and all the expenses of the travel were incurred by Shri Kajulal Srivastava. It further revealed that the complainant was accompanied by Shri Sunil Kumar Srivastava, Advocate to the Ld. Court but he was not asked any question either by the Judge or by Shri Sunil Kumar Srivastava in the Court.\n\nDuring enquiry Shri Ranjeet Kumar Gautam stated that no such incident had taken place with him and he had filed the complaint only on the instructions of Shri Kajulal Srivastava and his brother Sunil Srivastava.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that the instant complaint was filed on the instructions/ pressure of Shri Kajulal Srivastava and Shri Sunil Kumar Srivastava as there was a property dispute with Shri Ram Pyare Lal Srivastava and Shri Subhash Srivastava (who are real uncles of Shri Kajulal Srivastava and Shri Sunil Srivastava).\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that no such incident occurred with the complainant and he had signed the complaint under pressure/promise of Shri Kajulal Srivastava and Shri Sunil Kumar Srivastava, Advocate because they wanted to take revenge from their uncles in a property dispute. Hence, this complaint is apparently not based on true facts.\n\n(VI) Criminal Complaint Case No. 13615 of 2020 (Old Case No. 801 of 2020 ) under \nSections 323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n, \n427\n I.P.C.

Shri Chhattu was not happy with the conduct of S/Shri Subhash Chandra Srivastava, Ram Pyare Lal Srivastava as they supported Shri Lal Chand in the case lodged against him.\n\nDuring enquiry Shri Chhattu has stated that Shri Sunil Srivastava, Advocate taking the advantage of the situation, instigated him to file a complaint against Shri Lal Chand. Thereafter, the complaint was drafted by Shri Sunil Srivastava, Advocate who also got the thumb impression of the complainant as the complainant and her husband were illiterate. The names of Subhash Chandra Srivastava, Ram Pyare Lal Srivastava (both real uncles of Shri Sunil Srivastava with whom he was having property dispute) were mentioned in the complaint by Sunil Srivastava to falsely implicate them.\n\nDuring enquiry, it has been admitted by the complainant Smt. Sarita Devi that no such incident occurred with her and her husband but the same was filed before the Ld. Court on the instructions of Shri Sunil Kumar Srivastava who also accompanied them to the Court for filing of the complaint against his uncles and Lal Chand.\n\nHene the instant complaint under \nSection 156 (3)\n Cr.P.C. filed in the learned Court by Smt. Sarita Devi against Sri Subhash Chandra Srivastava, Ram Pyare Lal Srivastava, Lal Chand is apparently based on false facts to implicate them in a criminal case.\n\n(VII) Case Crime No. 195 of 2020 under \nSections 376D\n, \n406\n, \n342\n, \n506\n I.P.C. Police Station Kareilly, District Prayagraj.\n\nFindings of State Police: After investigation, State Police had filed charge-sheet on 14.04.2021 in the Court of Ld.

Due to financial crisis, in the year 2017, he handed over operation of this Petrol Pump to Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Sri Prashant Kumar Mishra. An agreement to sale & operation of the said Petrol Pump was also executed on 30.08.2017 in their favour for a consideration of Rs. 05.00 crores, out of which, Rs. 1.0 crore was paid in cash at the time of Agreement. Further, amount of Rs. 45,00,000/- was paid on 31.08.2017, Rs. 13,00,000/- on 01.09.2017 and Rs. 50,00,000/- on 17.10.2017 were also paid to Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi S/o Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi, which was acknowledged by him through receipts on Non-Judicial Stamp Papers. It has been revealed that Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Sri Prashant Kumar Mishra continued to manage the affairs of the Petrol Pump from 31.08.2017 till February 2020.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that the file regarding the transfer of Petrol Pump in favour of Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Sri Prashant Kumar Mishra was under process at Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). Prayagraj. In the meantime, Shri Subhash Chandra Tripathi expired on 18.10.2019 and the petrol pump was temporarily transferred for operation for a period of 6 months to Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi eldest son of Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that despite the payments received by Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi as well as his family members against sale of the Petrol Pump to Shri Anoop Tiwari and Sri Prashant Kumar Mishra, the sale agreement was not further processed by family members of Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi. Thereafter, both Shri Anoop and Shri Prashant started creating pressure for transfer of the same in their names. Due to this, Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi and his family members shifted themselves to Lucknow from Prayagraj. Shri Anoop and Shri Prashant, who were operating the petrol pump since August, 2017, were facing problems in financial transactions as all the Bank accounts of Sangam Service Station were being operated by Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi after the death of his father. Due to this, the operation of the petrol pump was stopped by them.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that on 22.02 2021, the dealership of Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump was transferred in the name of Smt. Shakuntala Tripathi W/o Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi (51%) and Sunil Kumar Pandey (49%). After some time, Smt. Shakuntala Tripathi transferred all her shares of the said petrol pump in favour of Shri Sunil Kumar Pandey. The consideration for transfer of 49% share & remaining 51% share of Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump to Shri Sunil Kumar Pandey could not be established during the enquiry.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Shri Prashant Mishra who had paid more than Rs 2 crores to Subhash Chandra Tripathi & Rakesh Chandra Tripathi, neither received back the sale consideration paid by them nor got the ownership of the petrol pump in their names. Being aggrieved, they lodged Case Crime No. 253/20 U/s 406 and 506 \nIPC\n against four sons of Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi on 22.03.2020 at PS- Colonelganj. Prayagraj in which chargesheet had been filed.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that Smt. Soni Dubey had issued a cheque of Rs 5 lacs from her A/c No. 3611976337 maintained at Kotak Mahindra Bank, Civil Lines, Prayagraj and the same was encashed by Shri Pankaj Tripathi S/o Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi on 30.01.2018.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that on 07.02.2018 from account No. 1001210007658 of M/s Kesarwani Plywood and Hardware Place maintained at PNB, Allapur, Prayagraj, a sum of Rs. 5 lacs was transferred into the above mentioned account No. 3611976337 of Smt. Soni Dubey. Shri Abhishek Kesarwani, Proprietor, M/s Kesarwani Plywood and Hardware Place has stated that this amount was transferred by him on the request of Shri Pankaj Tripathi who had given him cash against the same.\n\nIn view of above, it is clear that the amount of Rs. 5 lacs was received back by Smt. Soni Dubey on 07.02.2018 and, therefore, her claim that loan of Rs 5 Lacs was still outstanding on Shri Pankaj Tripathi & his brothers on the date of above alleged incident in September 2019 appears to be false.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that the address and contact number given by the complainant Smt. Soni Dubey in the FIR as well as during investigation by State Police, were not in use. Family members of the complainant could not provide the present whereabouts of Smt. Soni Dubey and informed that they are not in contact with her for more than 5-6 years.\n\nDuring enquiry, Shri Munish Mishra, Advocate was contacted as hehad earlier produced Smt. Soni Dubey before IO of Crime Branch, Prayagraj. He identified Anoop Kumar Tiwari who was running Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump at that time as the person on whose directions he had accompanied Smt. Soni Dubey to Crime Branch, Prayagraj for her examination. He also informed that FIR lodged by Smt. Soni Dubey is being pursued with him by Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari who is aware about her whereabouts. However, he declined to record his statement in the present enquiry. Accordingly. Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari was contacted & requested to ensure presence of Smt. Soni Dubey for enquiry before CBI. After 3-4 days Smt. Soni Dubey contacted CBI telephonically and appeared for her examination. She stated that she had given Rs 5 lacs to Shri Pankaj Tripathi on 30.01.2018 but feigned ignorance about refund of Rs 5.0 lacs in her bank account on 07.02.2018.\n\nEnquiry has further revealed that on the allegations of rape, Smt. Soni Dubey in her complaint as well as statement u/s 164 Cr PC has mentioned the name of the accused as Rakesh Kumar & Dinesh Kumar after being taken to their house on the pretext of returning her money. However, enquiry has established that she had already received back the loaned amount on 07.02.2018, hence, question of the accused persons calling her to their house on pretext of returning the loan and raping her sometime in September 2019 appears to be concocted.\n\nThus, it seems that the instant Case Crime has been lodged on 26.05.2020 by Smt. Soni Dubey in collusion with the S/Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Prashant Kumar Mishra to falsely implicate the sons of Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi to build pressure on them for coming to a conclusion in respect of the money advanced to them in lieu of sale of the petrol pump.\n\n(VIII) Case Crime No. 141 of 2020 under \nSections 468\n, \n467\n, \n420\n, \n419\n, \n406\n I.P.C.

Shri Abhishek Kesarwani has stated that he had transferred another Rs. 13 lacs in the A/c of Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump through RTGS by Cheque No. 255992 dated 26.02.2020 on the request of Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi, Dinesh Chandra Tripathi and Pankaj Tripathi. The complainant alleged that this amount of Rs. 40.46 lacs was given by him to the accused persons for the purchase of petrol pump and on their directions it was paid directly to Indian Oil Corporation, Mumbai or to Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra were managing the affairs of the Petrol Pump from 31.08.2017 till February 2020 but its bank accounts were being operated by Shri Subhash Chand Tripathi & thereafter by Shri Rakesh Kumar Tripathi. The scrutiny of statement of Account No. 1001210007658 of Kesarwani Plywood and Hardware Place maintained at PNB, Allapur, Prayagraj revealed that on 31.10.2018, Rs. 15.00 lacs were deposited in cash in this account and on the same day Rs. 15,00,060/- were transferred to Indian Oil Corporation, Mumbai through RTGS vide cheque No. 767993. On 02.11.2018, Rs. 7.65 lacs were transferred in the above account from account of Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump and on the same day Rs. 7,65,060/- were transferred to Indian Oil Corporation, Mumbai through RTGS vide cheque No. 767994. On 03.11.2018, Rs. 4.81 lacs were transferred in the above said account from Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump and on the same day Rs. 4,81,030/- were transferred to Indian Oil Corporation, Mumbai through RTGS vide cheque No. 767996.\n\nDuring enquiry Shri Abhishek Kesarwani could not explain the source of Rs. 15 lacs which were deposited in cash in the account of Kesarwani Plywood and Hardware Place on 31.10.2018. Further, he also could not explain as to why the amounts of Rs. 7.65 lacs and Rs. 4.81 lacs were received in the account of Kesarwani Plywood and Hardware Place from Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump on 2nd & 3rd of Nov 2018.\n\nEnquiry has also revealed that on 26.02.2020, a loan of Rs. 13 lacs were advanced by Shri Abhishek Kesarwani to Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi from the account of Kesarwani Plywood and Hardware Place which was credited into the account of Sangam Service Station Petrol Pump and the same is presently outstanding.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that the amount of Rs. 7.65 lacs and Rs. 4.81 lacs belonged to Sangam Service Station and not to the complainant Abhishek Kesarwani.\n\nDuring enquiry, Shri Abhishek Kesarwani has stated that sometime in May 2020, S/Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra approached him (Abhishek Kesarwani) and informed that they had paid about Rs 6.50 crores for purchasing petrol pump from Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi but after his death his sons were not transferring the petrol pump to them and have now shifted to Lucknow thereby cheating them. Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra informed that they have already lodged an FIR against the sons of Late Subhash Chandra Tripathi for cheating and encouraged him to lodge FIR to build pressure for return of the outstanding money. Upon this, he also informed them about lending money to Subhash Chandra Tripathi & his sons on several occasions including lending of Rs 13 lacs in Feb 2020 which has not been returned by them.\n\nEnquiry has revealed that on the advice of S/Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra, Shri Abhishek Kesarwani provided copy of statement of bank account of his firm to them for drafting of complaint by their Advocate. Subsequently, they had given a written complaint to Shri Abhishek Kesarwani which he signed without reading. Thereafter, all the four persons, S/Shri Anoop Kumar Tiwari, Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra, Abhshek Kesarwani and his advocate visited police station and lodged FIR bearing Case Crime No. 0141/2020 dated 27.05.2020 U/s 406, 419, 420, 467 and 468 \nIPC\n at Police Station Kydganj, Prayagraj against the accused persons.\n\nThus, it appears that the Case Crime No. 253 of 2020 of PS Colonelganj, Prayagraj dated 23.03.2020 by Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Prashant Kumar Mishra, Case Crime No. 195/2020 of PS- Kareli, Prayagraj dated 26.05.2020 and Case Crime No. 0141/2020 dated 27.05.2020 of Police Station: Kydganj, Prayagraj were got registered by Anoop Kumar Tiwari and Prashant Kumar Mishra to build pressure on the four brothers namely S/Shri Umesh Chandra Tripathi, Rakesh Chandra Tripathi, Dinesh Chandra Tripathi and Pankaj Tripathi to obtain/get the ownership over the Petrol Pump.\n\nHence, it is apparent that the instant FIR bearing Case Crime No. 0141/2020 dated 27.05.2020 U/s 406, 419, 420, 467 and 468 \nIPC\n of Police Station: Kydganj, Prayagraj was not based on true facts.\n\n29. Thus this Court had directed the C.B.I to conduct preliminary in respect of 79 cases, regarding which the findings of the State Police as well as findings of the C.B.I. has already been discussed above.\n\n30. Apart from the aforesaid, an intervener application no. 22 of 2023 was also filed by Sri Mujib Ahmad @ Mujib Ahmad Siddiqui as well as Sri Mushir Ahmad Siddiqui, one of whom, is a practising Advocate of this Court. They were also victimised on false accusation by one Roshan Jahan Siddiqui, a practising Advocate, by way of lodging a F.I.R. in Case Crime No. 310 of 2021 under \nSections 354Ka\n, \n354Gha\n, \n504\n, \n506\n I.P.C. and Section 7/8 of POSCO Act, Police Station Cantt., district Prayagraj.

Police Station Mauaima, District Prayagraj. RC0532023S0002 in relation to Case Crime No. 150 of 2016 under \nSections 147\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n, \n379\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3(2)(V)\n SC/ST Act, Police Station Shivkuti, District Prayagraj.

RC0532023S0004 with respect to Case Crime No. 617 of 2018 under \nSections 313\n, \n376\n, \n380\n, \n506\n I.P.C. Police Station Mauaima, District Prayagraj and had submitted the status report as under:-\n\n(I) RC0532023S0001 with respect to Case Crime No. 90 of 2021 under \nSections 342\n, \n376D\n, \n506\n I.P.C. Police Station Mauaima, District Prayagraj. In this case, the State Police had filed a Charge-sheet dated 05.10.2021 against named accused Wasim Ali followed by Supplementary Charge-sheet dated 07.07.2022 against FIR named accused Shri Chandra Bhushan, Shri Rakesh Nath Pandey (Advocate) and Smt. Samla Giri in the Court of Ld. Special Chief Judicial Magistrate, Allahabad and further investigation was kept open qua remaining four FIR named accused persons namely S/Shri Rajesh Kumar, Brijesh Patel, Indra Dev and Deva. Investigation conducted by CBI has established that in Case Crime No. 90/2021 U/s 342, 376D, 506 \nIPC\n, PS Mau Aima, Prayagraj, thereis no evidence to suggest involvement of any FIR named accused in any such incident. The evidence collected during investigation has revealed that no such incident of alleged gang rape upon the complainant Smt. Archana Singh has been committed by the FIR named accused persons. Thus, a Closure Report has been filed on 21.05.2024 in the Court of Ld. Special Judicial Magistrate, CBI/Pollution cases, Lucknow.\n\n(II) RC0532023S0002 in relation to Case Crime No. 150 of 2016 under \nSections 147\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n, \n379\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3(2)(V)\n SC/ST Act, Police Station Shivkuti, District Prayagraj.\n\n During investigation, the allegations against the accused persons made in the FIR by the complainant have not been substantiated. Investigation has established that Shri Sunil Kumar (Advocate) lodged a false case against Shri Om Prakash and his 5 other family members. On completion of investigation of this case, a Closure Report has been filed on 29.01.2024 in the Court of Ld. Special Judge, SC & ST Act, Prayagraj.\n\n(III) RC0532023S0003 with regard to Case Crime No. 150 of 2021 under \nSections 376D\n, \n506\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3 (2)(V)\n SC/ST Act, Police Station Daraganj, District Prayagraj.\n\n It goes without saying that it is the aforesaid case in which the informant Nikki Devi, the applicant in the present application under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. has sought for a direction to the concerned trial Court to consider and decide the trial of the aforesaid case expeditiously. The status report of the aforesaid case is as under:-\n\n \nInitially, this case was investigated by \nState Police\n case and after investigation by the State Police and after investigation, State Police filed a charge-sheet against Bhupendra Kumar Pandey U/s 376D, 506 \nIPC\n and 3 (2) (v) of SC/ST Act on 13.11.2021 in the Court of learned Special Judge, SC & ST Act, Prayagraj. Investigation conducted by CBI has established that accused Bhupendra Kumar Pandey has been falsely implicated in this case. The evidence collected during investigation clearly revealed that there was property dispute between Shri Vinod Shanker Tripathi, Advocate and Sri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey. Shri Vinod Shanker Tripathi and Shri Sudhakar Mishra both are known to each other and they conspired to settle their score with Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey and used Smt. Nikki Devi for lodging this false FIR against Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey. In furtherance of the said conspiracy with intent to cause injury to Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey, Smt. Nikki Devi gave false complaint on the basis of which FIR was registered U/s 376D, 506 \nIPC\n against Shri Bhupendra Kumar Pandey and another. Accordingly, on completion of investigation, a Closure Report has been filed on 11.01.2024 in the court of Ld. Special Judicial Magistrate, CBI/Pollution cases, Lucknow along with an application for initiating proceedings under Section 120B r/w \nSec. 211\n IPC and substantive offences against Smt. Nikki Devi (Complainant), Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and Shri Sudhakar Mishra in this case.\n\n(IV) RC0532023S0004 with respect to Case Crime No. 617 of 2018 under \nSections 313\n, \n376\n, \n380\n, \n506\n I.P.C. Police Station Mauaima, District Prayagraj.\n\n State Police filed a charge-sheet against Shri Akash Kumar Harijan and Shri Ashish Mishra (name emerged in the statement of victim recorded U/s 164 \nCr.PC\n only) for commission of offence U/s 376 and 506 \nIPC\n and against Dharmendra Kumar Harijan U/s 506 \nIPC\n. The complainant Smt. Sanju Devi expired on 05.07.2022 due to some complications at the time of child birth. Investigation by CBI has established that incident of rape on complainant and the theft committed by the accused persons alleged by Late Sanju Devi (complainant) had never occurred. Name of Shri Ashish Mishra, Advocate was falsely mentioned by the complainant Smt. Sanju Devi in her statement recorded\n u/s 164\n Cr.PC at the instance of her associates. Thus, a Closure Report has been filed on 09.01.2024 in the Ld. Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, CBI/ Pollution cases, Lucknow.\n\n33. The Special Investigation Team of Uttar Pradesh Police was directed to conduct investigation with regard to eight cases, details of which has already been given in foregoing paragraph no.31. Pursuant to which, an affidavit of compliance dated 20.05.2024 has been filed by Sri Rajeshwar Singh, learned A.G.A. wherein it has been stated that eight cases were required to be investigated by S.I.T. team and out of eight cases, in six cases charge sheet has been filed whereas in Case Crime No. 379 of 2022 under \nSections 147\n, \n452\n \n427\n, \n392\n, \n504\n, \n506\n I.P.C. Police Station Civil Lines, District Prayagraj, final report has been submitted in absence of evidence, however in one case being Case Crime No. 06 of 2020 under \nSections 323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n, \n376-D\n I.P.C. Police Station Mau Aima, District Prayagraj, investigation is going on against the accused-applicant. \n\n34. Perusal of the aforesaid preliminary report as well as investigation conducted by the C.B.I. and also the Special Investigation team, shows that the Advocates, who are officers of the Court, are being victimised and harassed on false accusations by an Advocate when as a matter of fact advocacy is a noble profession. It cannot be compared with any other profession because it is a part and parcel of judiciary and administration of justice. Bar and Bench are two eyes of the 'Justice'. There are judicial ethics and etiquettes for Judges. There are professional ethics and etiquettes for advocates. Every advocate should follow them in his profession. Besides the fact that Advocates are not born stalwart but by giving their most of the life in the field of law, they become stalwart, an advocate is also a key person in conducting a proceeding before the court. An advocate is considered as an officer of the court, honoured member of the community, and a gentleman, thinking to become a member of the Bar he has not only to be lawful and moral in his professional capacity but also in his non-professional capacity. An advocate has to courageously support the interest of justice and also have to follow the ethics and etiquettes. \n\n An advocate has to do several functions which are necessary in conducting proceedings. While carrying out these functions, an advocate must act prudently, legally and cautiously. There are several ethics and etiquettes controlling the conduct of advocates. These ethics and etiquettes impose certain duties upon advocates. Ethics and etiquette means ethics are morals, a moral philosophy or moral science. It is the first stage of society. To become a lawyer is not only a profession for earning livelihood rather it is more onerous responsibility to play active role in the system to prevent miscarriage of justice.\n\n Etiquette is the second stage, which formulates the rules of behaviour standard in polite society. Humans have experienced ethics in their life. They are inherent in every religion. Along with the civilization of humans there were Ethics. Every religion preached morals and ethics. Etiquette is restricted to particular kind of profession. It is nothing but regularization of ethics. In simple words ethics are bundle of habits whereas etiquette is bundle of rules of ethics. Advocates are the part and parcel of the administration of justice. They strive for justice. They struggle for the welfare and good of the society in general and their clients in particular. It does not mean that the advocate and the opponent advocate are rivals. There may be conflict of opinion on the issue but not between them. Their conflict ends as soon as they come out of the court premises. If they quarrel with each other like ordinary persons it affects the bar- bench relations. It may part the noble profession of advocacy into groups which may largely affect the society. But exception in every field may not be ignored. Owing to intrusion of black sheep into the noble profession of advocacy, the reputation of good lawyers in the society is at the verge of fall. \n\n35. The applicant in the instant case has been used as tool by an Advocate.The investigation conducted by the CBI with respect to case crime No. 150 of 2021 under \nSection 376D\n, \n506\n IPC, \nSection 3(2)(5)\n SC/ST Act, police station Daraganj, District Prayagraj (for expedition of which case present 482 application has been moved) clearly reveals the false implication of the opposite party No. 2, at the instance of practising advocate. It is a venom and if it is allowed to be mingled with other members of the Bar freely, the entire profession would be ruined, like a single drop of poison if put in a pot of milk turns the whole milk into poison. Lawyers are globally recognised as Officers of the Court and agents of the administration of justice and they are imposed with the social duty to promote rule of law in the society and fight for protecting the fundamental rights and freedom of the citizens as guaranteed in the Constitution. \n\n36. \nIn the instant matter, though the applicant has approached this Court seeking direction for the trial Court to consider and decide the trial of Sessions Trial No. 560 of 2021 (\nState Vs. Bhupendra Pandey\n) arising out of Case Crime No. 150 of 2021 under \nSections 376-D\n, \n506\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3 (2) (V)\n SC/ST Act, Police Station Daraganj, District Prayagraj pending before learned Special Judge SC/ST Act, Prayagraj, District Prayagraj but when the matter came up for consideration before this Court on 21.07.2022, it has come to light that a gang of Advocates is operating, even in this Court, who used to trap innocent people in fake/false cases with the intent to extract money from them. The members of this gang trap the innocent persons under SC/ST Act cases and after receiving money from the Government (as compensation), they distribute the money amongst themselves, which has become their habit. This Court cannot sit like a mute spectator by merely considering the case of the litigant. A society that will allow its members to misuse its courts, will ultimately suffer and pay a huge cost. Litigants, both genuine and bogus, will always continue to stand in the same queue. The courts have no mechanism to pre-identify and distinguish between the genuine and the bogus litigant. That becomes known only after hearing is concluded in a case. Hearing requires time. In fact, even if the courts were to take punitive action against a bogus litigant, being bound by rules of procedure and fairness, such cases would require more time to be devoted to them than a case of genuine litigants and therefore, to bring the cat out of the bag, this Court had directed for preliminary enquiry into the matters by the C.B.I. and after considering the preliminary enquiry reports, this Court found it essential that investigation be conducted by the C.B.I. in four cases as well as in eight cases by the Special Investigation Team, as stated in the preceding paragraph and after investigation, the entire position of the cases became crystal clear and it is apparent by perusal of the preliminary enquiry reports that innocent persons have been trapped in fake and bogus cases at the behest of Advocates.\n\n37. After investigation by the C.B.I. in the instant case, it has borne out that closure report has been filed on 11.01.2024 in the court of learned Special Judicial Magistrate, CBI/Pollution cases, Lucknow along with an application for initiating proceedings under Section 120B r/w \nSec. 211\n IPC and substantive offences against Smt. Nikki Devi (applicant in the present case), Shri Vinod Shankar Tripathi and Shri Sudhakar Mishra and therefore, the real fact emerged in the instant case, which was more essential. \n\n38. Considering the fact that closure report has been filed by the C.B.I. after investigation in the matter with respect to Case Crime No. 150 of 2021 (registered as Sessions Trial No. 560 of 2021 (\nState Vs. Bhupendra Pandey\n), under \nSections 376D\n, \n506\n I.P.C. and \nSection 3 (2)(V)\n SC/ST Act, Police Station Daraganj, District Prayagraj, for which the instant 482 application has been filed seeking expeditious disposal of the case, the relief sought by the applicant-Nikki Devi has become infructuous.\n\n39. The powers vested under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. are inherent and wide powers, which ought to exercised by the High Court to prevent the abuse of process of law and to secure the ends of justice, however caution must be there while exercising such powers. In the cases, in which preliminary enquiry was directed to be conducted by the C.B.I. material fact and truth has been brought to the notice of this Court out-tracking the black sheep, on whose behest, the malicious prosecution has been launched, as has been stated in the preceding paragraphs, this Court directs the concerned trial Courts to consider and decide the pending trial in accordance with law after applying its judicial wisdom, after taking into consideration the said preliminary enquiry reports submitted by the C.B.I. as well as investigation reports of the S.I.T. as detailed in paragraph nos. 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 31 of this order.\n\n40. The Inspector General of Police (SIT), Lucknow is directed to furnish the investigation report conducted by Special Investigation Team, as has been directed by this Court vide order dated 13.02.2023, with respect to eight cases, to the concerned trial Court expeditiously.\n\n41. The Registrar (Compliance) is directed to sent a copy of this order to the concerned District Judge to ensure its production before the concerned trial Court as well as Inspector General of Police (SIT), Lucknow forthwith for necessary compliance.\n\n42. The preliminary enquiry reports as well as status report submitted by C.B.I. are sealed again and are sent to the Registrar General of this Court to keep the same in his safe custody.\n\n43. Interim order, if any stands vacated.\n\n44. The connected cases are de-linked and be placed before appropriate Court.\n\n45. With the aforesaid direction, the instant petition stands disposed of.\n\nOrder Date :- 26.7.2024 (Dr. Gautam Chowdhary,J.)\n \nS.Ali",

When the vendee asks them to execute the sale deed, they refuse and on insistence by the vendee, the alleged vendor use to implicate those vendees in false and frivolous case under penal provision of \nIPC\n along with SC/ST Act.

Thereafter, both Shri Anoop and Shri Prashant started creating pressure for transfer of the same in their names. Due to this, Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi and his family members shifted themselves to Lucknow from Prayagraj. Shri Anoop and Shri Prashant, who were operating the petrol pump since August, 2017, were facing problems in financial transactions as all the Bank accounts of Sangam Service Station were being operated by Shri Rakesh Chandra Tripathi after the death of his father. Due to this, the operation of the petrol pump was stopped by them."

Perusal of the aforesaid preliminary report as well as investigation conducted by the C.B.I. and also the Special Investigation team, shows that the Advocates, who are officers of the Court, are being victimised and harassed on false accusations by an Advocate when as a matter of fact advocacy is a noble profession. It cannot be compared with any other profession because it is a part and parcel of judiciary and administration of justice. Bar and Bench are two eyes of the 'Justice'. There are judicial ethics and etiquettes for Judges. There are professional ethics and etiquettes for advocates. Every advocate should follow them in his profession. Besides the fact that Advocates are not born stalwart but by giving their most of the life in the field of law, they become stalwart, an advocate is also a key person in conducting a proceeding before the court. An advocate is considered as an officer of the court, honoured member of the community, and a gentleman, thinking to become a member of the Bar he has not only to be lawful and moral in his professional capacity but also in his non-professional capacity. An advocate has to courageously support the interest of justice and also have to follow the ethics and etiquettes."

There are several ethics and etiquettes controlling the conduct of advocates. These ethics and etiquettes impose certain duties upon advocates. Ethics and etiquette means ethics are morals, a moral philosophy or moral science. It is the first stage of society. To become a lawyer is not only a profession for earning livelihood rather it is more onerous responsibility to play active role in the system to prevent miscarriage of justice."

Along with the civilization of humans there were Ethics. Every religion preached morals and ethics. Etiquette is restricted to particular kind of profession. It is nothing but regularization of ethics. In simple words ethics are bundle of habits whereas etiquette is bundle of rules of ethics. Advocates are the part and parcel of the administration of justice. They strive for justice. They struggle for the welfare and good of the society in general and their clients in particular. It does not mean that the advocate and the opponent advocate are rivals. There may be conflict of opinion on the issue but not between them. Their conflict ends as soon as they come out of the court premises. If they quarrel with each other like ordinary persons it affects the bar- bench relations. It may part the noble profession of advocacy into groups which may largely affect the society. But exception in every field may not be ignored. Owing to intrusion of black sheep into the noble profession of advocacy, the reputation of good lawyers in the society is at the verge of fall."

The members of this gang trap the innocent persons under SC/ST Act cases and after receiving money from the Government (as compensation), they distribute the money amongst themselves, which has become their habit. This Court cannot sit like a mute spectator by merely considering the case of the litigant. A society that will allow its members to misuse its courts, will ultimately suffer and pay a huge cost. Litigants, both genuine and bogus, will always continue to stand in the same queue. The courts have no mechanism to pre-identify and distinguish between the genuine and the bogus litigant. That becomes known only after hearing is concluded in a case. Hearing requires time. In fact, even if the courts were to take punitive action against a bogus litigant, being bound by rules of procedure and fairness, such cases would require more time to be devoted to them than a case of genuine litigants and therefore, to bring the cat out of the bag, this Court had directed for preliminary enquiry into the matters by the C.B.I. and after considering the preliminary enquiry reports, this Court found it essential that investigation be conducted by the C.B.I. in four cases as well as in eight cases by the Special Investigation Team, as stated in the preceding paragraph and after investigation, the entire position of the cases became crystal clear and it is apparent by perusal of the preliminary enquiry reports that innocent persons have been trapped in fake and bogus cases at the behest of Advocates."
