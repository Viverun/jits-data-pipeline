As this death reference and the instant appeal arise out\n\nof the common Judgment of conviction and Order of\n\nsentence, they were heard together and are being disposed of\n\nby this common Judgment.\n\n3. This death reference and the connected Criminal Appeal\n\narise out of the impugned Judgment of conviction dated\n\n09.01.2025 and Order of sentence dated 10.01.2025 passed\n\nby learned Additional and Sessions Judge-I-cum-Special\n\nJudge (POCSO Act), Lohardaga, in Special POCSO Case\n\nNo.09/2023 whereby, the sole appellant Indar Oraon has\n\nbeen found guilty and convicted for the offences under\n\nSections 302\nof the Indian Penal Code and\nSection 6\nof the\n\nPOCSO Act.\n\nUpon hearing on the point of sentence, the appellant\n\nIndar Oraon has been sentenced to the capital punishment of\n\ndeath, for the offence under\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode, directing him to be hanged by neck till his death.

This Court, before proceeding to examine the legality\n\nand propriety of the judgment of conviction and order of\n\nsentence, deems it fit and proper to refer the background of\n\ninstitution of prosecution case. The prosecution story in brief\n\nas per the allegation made in the First Information Report\n\nreads hereunder as :-\n\nThe case of the prosecution is that on 24.12.2022 at\n\n3.00 O'clock the informant alongwith her younger daughter\n\n(victim/deceased aged about 5 years) visited towards roof of\n\nAnganbari for getting the paddy crop parched.\n\nIn the meanwhile, her daughter rushed out from there\n\nand started playing with other children. Accused Indar Oraon\n\naged about 25 years visited there and offered 5 rupees to\n\neach children and on the other hand her daughter was\n\noffered 50 rupees by the accused Indar Oraon.\n\nAccused Indar Oraon wandered alongwith her daughter.\n\nAt 4.35 O'clock when she returned home, her daughter was\n\nfound to be missing. She inquired whereabout of her\n\ndaughter from Indar Oraon accused.\n\nShe on suspicion apprehended accused but accused\n\nIndar Oraon strove hard to stifle her in the court yard of\n\nFuldeo.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nIn the meanwhile, Sukhmaniya Oraon and Heeramuni\n\nOraon rushed there and informed her that her daughter was\n\nlying dead. Then Indar Oraon started fleeing from the spot\n\nbut he was apprehended by the people who divulged that he\n\nattempted to ravish the victim/deceased behind the house of\n\nTewasi Oraon during which victim/deceased squealed and in\n\nthe said course he stifled her neck causing her death.\n\nIt has been indicted that Indar Oraon killed the\n\nvictim/deceased when he attempted to ravish her. It has\n\nbeen also alleged that Indar Oraon was having criminal\n\nhistory of killing her grand-mother and in this connection\n\nearlier a case was instituted in Bagru Police Station.\n\nThereafter the matter was reported to the Bagru Police\n\nStation for institution of F.I.R.\n\nOn the written report of informant, this case was\n\ninstituted vide Bagru P.S. Case No. 33/2022 dated\n\n24.12.2022 for the offences\nu/s 302\n,\n376(2)(f)\nof I.P.C. and\n\nSection 6\nPOCSO Act.\n\n5. After investigation Police submitted charge-sheet\n\nagainst the accused /appellant for the offences U/s 302,\n\n376(2)(f)\nI.P.C\n. and\nSection 6\nPOCSO Act.\n\n6. On 23.02.2023, cognizance was taken against\n\naccused/appellant for the offences U/s 302, 376(2)(f)\nIPC\nand\n\nSection 6\nPOCSO Act.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n7. Accordingly, charges U/s 376(2)(f), 302\nIPC\nand\nSection\nPOCSO Act were framed against the appellant which was\n\nread and explained to him to which he pleaded not guilty and\n\nclaimed to be tried.\n\n8. In order to establish charges levelled against accused\n\nperson, prosecution examined altogether 17 witnesses which\n\nare as follows:\n\nPW-1 Mehrani Orain\n\nPW-2 Sukhmaniya Oraon\n\nPW-3 Rajmuni Oraon\n\nPW-4 Mrs. X (Informant)\n\nPW-5 Bipasa Oraon\n\nPW-6 Khushboo Kumari\n\nPW-7 Bablu Oraon\n\nPW-8 Sudhir Oraon\n\nPW-9 Priti Oraon\n\nPW-10 Sunil Oraon\n\nPW-11 Biyas Sahu\n\nPW-12 Sulendra Sahu\n\nPW-13 Dr. Anand Kumar\n\nPW-14 Dr. Ajay Kumar Bhagat\n\nPW-15 Kiran Pandit\n\nPW-16 Vishwajit Kumar Singh (I.O.)\n\nPW-17 Pankaj Kumar Sharma (I.O.)\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n9. The Defence has not examined any witness in support\n\nof his case.\n\n10. The trial Court, after recording the evidence of\n\nwitnesses, examination-in-chief and cross-examination,\n\nrecorded the statement of the accused/appellant found the\n\ncharges levelled against the appellant proved beyond all\n\nreasonable doubts.\n\n11. Accordingly, the appellant had been found guilty and\n\nconvicted for the offence punishable under\nSection 302\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code and\nSection 6\nof the POCSO Act.\n\n12. The aforesaid order of conviction and sentence is\n\nsubject matter of instant appeal.\n\nSubmission of the learned counsel for the appellant:\n\n13. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that\n\nthe impugned Judgment of conviction and Order of sentence\n\npassed by the trial court cannot be sustained in the eyes of\n\nlaw.\n\n14. The following grounds have been taken by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant in assailing the impugned judgment\n\nof conviction: -\n\n(i) The impugned judgment of conviction and\n\nsentence has been passed mechanically and\n\nwithout appreciating the evidence available on\n\nrecord and without taking into consideration the\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nevidences in its right perspective, thereby arriving\n\nat erroneous conclusion.\n\n(ii) The impugned judgment is not sustainable either\n\non facts or in the eyes of law and is fit to be set\n\naside as the same has been passed on conjectures,\n\nsurmises and suspicion.\n\n(iii) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate the\n\nfact that the version of PW-1-Mehrani Orain and\n\nPW-2-Sukhmaniya Oraon did not inculpate the\n\nAppellant with certainty and did not prove the case\n\nof the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n(iv) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate\n\nthat PW-3- Rajmuni Oraon was merely a witness\n\nwho had seen the dead body and she is not the\n\nwitness of alleged occurrence. Further, the PW-3's\n\nversion of seizure also casts a serious doubt on the\n\nfactum of seizure.\n\n(v) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate\n\nthat there was improvement in the deposition of\n\nthe PW-4- informant in the trial as compared to\n\nher version in the FIR thereby casting a serious\n\ndoubt on her testimony.\n\n(vi) Learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate that\n\nthe evidence of PW-5 Bipasa Oraon, PW-6\n\nKhushboo Kumari and PW-9 Priti Oraon were\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nmerely of the nature of 'last seen' and did not\n\nfurther the case of the prosecution as regard the\n\nalleged occurrence. Further, the learned Trial\n\nCourt did not record proper satisfaction that these\n\nwitnesses being child witnesses were competent to\n\nunderstand the facts and circumstances of the\n\nmatter.\n\n(vii) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate\n\nthat the purported confession made by the\n\nAppellant before the PW-7 Bablu Oraon was made\n\nin 'Sadri' language which the witness has\n\nexpressed inability to understand in his cross-\n\nexamination and hence the entire prosecution\n\nversion of Appellant's extra-judicial confession\n\nstood demolished.\n\n(viii) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate\n\nthat the PW-8 has specifically stated in his cross-\n\nexamination that he had not witness the alleged\n\noccurrence as he was at his home.\n\n(ix) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate\n\nthat the evidence of the PW-10, 11 and 12 was in\n\nthe nature of hearsay and hence did not further\n\nthe case of the prosecution.\n\n(x) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate\n\nthat the prosecution had failed to examine Prof.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nDr. Chandrashekhar Prasad under whose\n\nsupervision the post-mortem of the deceased was\n\nconducted, as specifically deposed by PW-13 in his\n\ncross-examination.\n\n(xi) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate\n\nthat the PW-15 Kiran Pandit in her cross-\n\nexamination has specifically stated that the\n\ninquest report does not specifically state that the\n\ndead body was found from near the house of\n\nTewasi Oraon.\n\n(xii) The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate the\n\nfact that there is no eye witness to the alleged\n\noccurrence and that the prosecution failed to\n\nexamine several material witnesses in order to\n\nunearth the truth of the matter.\n\n(xiii) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the prosecution was unable to\n\nestablish the time of death of the deceased with\n\nprecision thereby casting a serious doubt on the\n\nentire case of the prosecution.\n\n(xiv) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the forensic report completely\n\nnegated the involvement of the Appellant in the\n\nalleged crime since there was no DNA match of the\n\nAppellant with any of the seized materials.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n(xv) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the case was of circumstantial\n\nevidence however none of the chain of\n\ncircumstances were complete so as to give rise to\n\nan irrefutable inference that the alleged crime has\n\nbeen committed by the Appellant.\n\n(xvi) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the last-seen version put forth\n\nby the prosecution was extremely faint and could\n\nnot be construed as incriminating material against\n\nthe Appellant.\n\n(xvii) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the medical and forensic\n\nevidence did not corroborate the prosecution case.\n\n(xviii) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the extra-judicial confession of\n\nthe Appellant was not at all corroborated by any\n\nother evidence led by the prosecution.\n\n(xix) The learned Trial Court has miserably failed to\n\ntake into consideration that there are several\n\ninconsistencies, improvement and contradictions\n\nin the evidence of prosecution witnesses, which\n\ncast a serious doubt on the entire case of the\n\nprosecution.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n(xx) The learned Trial Court has failed to properly\n\nappreciate the statement of the Appellants\n\nrecorded u/s 351 of the BNSS.\n\n(xxi) The prosecution has not been able to prove the\n\ncharges leveled against the accused persons\n\nbeyond shadow of all reasonable doubt.\n\n(xxii) The prosecution has failed to establish any motive\n\nof the Appellant for committing the alleged offence.\n\n(xxiii) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the entire investigation was\n\nconducted in hot-haste by the police.\n\n(xxiv) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration the principle that if offence is proved\n\nby circumstantial evidence ordinarily death penalty\n\nshould not be awarded and no 'special reason' has\n\nbeen recorded by the learned court below which\n\nmakes awarding of death penalty imperative.\n\n(xxv) The learned Trial Court has failed to apply and\n\nbalance aggravating circumstances with mitigating\n\ncircumstances while awarding death penalty to the\n\nAppellant and has also failed to take into\n\nconsideration that the Appellant is a young person.\n\n(xxvi) The learned Trial Court has failed to take into\n\nconsideration that even if it is held that the\n\nprosecution has been able to prove its case beyond\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nreasonable doubt, still the instant case is not\n\n'rarest of rare case warranting imposition of death\n\npenalty.\n\n(xxvii) The learned Trial Court has miserably failed to\n\nrecord a finding that the Appellant was beyond any\n\nreforms and that the death penalty was the only\n\noption in the facts and circumstances of the case\n\nand that alternative option of a lesser punishment\n\nis unquestionably foreclosed.\n\n(xxviii) Learned counsel, accordingly, submitted that there\n\nbeing only circumstantial evidence against the\n\naccused and there being no eyewitness to the\n\noccurrence of rape, murder or concealing the dead\n\nbody, it was a fit case, in which, the appellant\n\nought to have been given at least the benefits of\n\ndoubt.\n\n15. The learned counsel for the appellant, based upon the\n\naforesaid grounds, has submitted that, therefore, it is a case\n\nwhere the judgment of conviction and order of sentence is fit\n\nto be interfered with.\n\nSubmission of the learned counsel/P.P for the state:\n\n16. Per contra, Mr. Pankaj Kumar, learned Public\n\nProsecutor appearing for the State, has submitted by taking\n\nthe following grounds in defending the impugned judgment:\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n(i) Learned counsel for the State submitted that the\n\ncase in hand relates to brutal murder of the victim\n\ngirl after commission of rape upon her by the\n\naccused in extremely brutal, gruesome and\n\ndiabolical manner, and the case comes within the\n\ncategory of rarest of rare cases, and as such it is a\n\nfit case in which the death sentence awarded to\n\nthe accused by the Trial Court below be confirmed,\n\nirrespective of his age, family background or lack\n\nof criminal antecedents, which cannot be\n\nconsidered as mitigating circumstances\n\n(ii) Learned State counsel while supporting the death\n\nreference, has placed reliance upon the decisions\n\nof the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nBachan Singh Vs.\n\nState of Punjab\n, reported in (1980) 2 SCC 684\n\nand Machi Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab,\n\nreported in (1983) 3 SCC 470, giving the\n\nnecessary guidelines for awarding the death\n\nsentence, and submitted that in Machi Singh's\n\ncase (supra), it has been held that when the victim\n\nof murder is an innocent child who could not have\n\nor has not provided even an excuse, much less a\n\nprovocation, for murder, the case comes within the\n\nrarest of the rare category, and it is a fit case for\n\nimposing the death sentence.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n(iii) Learned counsel has further placed reliance upon\n\nthe decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nBantu\n\nVs. State of U.P.\n, reported in (2008) 11 SCC 113,\n\nwhich related to the rape and murder of a child,\n\naged about five years, wherein the Apex Court held\n\nthat the case fell within the category of rarest of\n\nrare cases, affirming the death sentence.\n\n(iv) Similarly, in\nShivaji Vs. State of Maharashtra\n,\n\nreported in (2008) 15 SCC 269, which related to\n\nrape and murder of a child aged about nine years,\n\nit was held that the plea that in cases of\n\ncircumstantial evidence, the death sentence\n\nshould not be awarded, is without any logic. This\n\ncase was also found to be falling within the\n\ncategory of rarest of rare cases, and the death\n\nsentence to the accused was affirmed.\n\n(v) Again in\nPurushottam Dashrath Borate Vs. State\n\nof Maharashtra\n, reported in AIR 2015 SC 2170,\n\nthe Supreme Court, in a case related to gang rape\n\nand murder of a married woman, re-iterated the\n\nneed of imposing just punishment upon the\n\naccused, holding that the undue sympathy shown\n\nto the accused shall do more harm. It was also\n\nheld that the age of the accused or his family\n\nbackground or lack of criminal antecedents,\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\ncannot alone be considered as mitigating\n\ncircumstances. The death sentence was affirmed\n\nby the Hon'ble Apex Court, upon the accused in\n\nspite of his young age.\n\n17. Learned counsel for the State, based upon the aforesaid\n\npronouncements, has submitted that the impugned judgement\n\nneeds no interference.\n\nResponse of the learned counsel for the appellant\n\n18. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant, in\n\nresponse, has submitted that simply because the case relates\n\nto rape and murder of a child, it does not come under the\n\ncategory of rarest of rare cases.\n\n19. Learned counsel for the appellant, in support of his\n\ncontention, has\nplaced reliance upon\nthe decisions of the\n\nSupreme Court in Sebastian Vs. State of Kerela, reported in\n\n(2010) 1 SCC 58, Ram Deo Prasad Vs. State of Bihar,\n\nreported in (\n2013) 7 SCC 725, Tattu Lodhi Vs. State of\n\nM.P.\n, reported in (2016) 9 SCC 675, and in all these cases,\n\nthe child aged between 2 to 7 years were murdered after\n\ncommitting rape upon them but the Hon'ble Supreme Court,\n\nin the facts of these cases, held that they do not come within\n\nthe category of rarest of rare cases, and the death sentence\n\nawarded by the Trial Court, and confirmed by the High Court,\n\nwere commuted to life imprisonment.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n20. Learned counsel has also\nplaced reliance upon\nthe\n\ndecision of\nRameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) Vs. State of\n\nGujarat\n, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 764, which also related to\n\nrape and murder of a child by the guard of the building. The\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court laid down the law that it was\n\nobligatory upon the Trial Court to have given the finding as to\n\na possible rehabilitation and reformation and the possibility\n\nthat the accused could still be a useful member of the society,\n\nin case, he was given a chance to do so, and in absence of\n\nsuch finding, the death sentence awarded by the Trial Court\n\nand confirmed by the High Court, was commuted to the\n\nsentence for whole life, but subject to any remission or\n\ncommutation of sentence by the State Government for good\n\nand social reasons.\n\n21. Placing reliance on these decisions, learned counsel\n\nsubmitted that the present case also, does not come within the\n\npurview of rarest of rare cases, and it is a fit case in which the\n\ndeath sentence passed by the Trial Court below be set aside\n\nfor the offence under\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\n22. It has also been submitted that the Trial Court has not\n\ngiven any finding as to a possible rehabilitation and\n\nreformation of the accused/appellant and in absence of such\n\nfinding, the death sentence awarded by the Trial Court cannot\n\nbe sustained in the eyes of law.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nAnalysis\n\n23. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and\n\nappreciated their arguments.\n\n24. The issues which require consideration based upon the\n\nargument advanced on behalf of the parties are -\n\n(i) whether prosecution has been able to prove charges\n\nlevelled against accused person/appellant beyond all\n\nreasonable doubt or not\n\n(ii) Whether the case in hand comes under the purview of\n\nrarest of rare cases?\n\n(iii) Whether there is no alternative but to impose death\n\nsentence in the facts and circumstances of the case?\n\n25. Since all the issues are interlinked and, as such, all are\n\nbeing taken up together for its consideration. But, before\n\nconsidering the same, background of the initiation of the case\n\nright from the day of institution of F.I.R. and evidence led on\n\nbehalf of the prosecution and the statement recorded under\n\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. need to be referred herein :-\n\nThe case of the prosecution is that on 24.12.2022 at\n\n3.00 O'clock the informant alongwith her younger daughter\n\n(victim/deceased aged about 5 years) visited towards roof of\n\nAnganbari for getting the paddy crop parched.\n\nIn the meanwhile, her daughter rushed out from there\n\nand started playing with other children. Accused Indar Oraon\n\naged about 25 years visited there and offered 5 rupees to each\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nchild and on the other hand her daughter was offered 50\n\nrupees by the accused Indar Oraon.\n\nAccused Indar Oraon wandered alongwith her daughter.\n\nAt 4.35 O'clock when she returned home, her daughter was\n\nfound to be missing. She inquired whereabout of her daughter\n\nfrom Indar Oraon accused.\n\nShe on suspicion apprehended accused but accused\n\nIndar Oraon strove hard to stifle her in the court yard of\n\nFuldeo.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Sukhmaniya Oraon and Heeramuni\n\nOraon rushed there and informed her that her daughter was\n\nlying dead. Then Indar Oraon started fleeing from the spot but\n\nhe was apprehended by the people who divulged that he\n\nattempted to ravish the victim/deceased behind the house of\n\nTewasi Oraon during which victim/deceased squealed and in\n\nthe said course he stifled her neck causing her death.\n\nIt has been alleged that Indar Oraon killed the\n\nvictim/deceased when he attempted to ravish her. It has been\n\nalso alleged that Indar Oraon was having criminal history of\n\nkilling her grand-mother and in this connection earlier a case\n\nwas instituted in Bagru Police Station. Thereafter the matter\n\nwas reported to the Bagru Police Station for institution of\n\nF.I.R.\n\n26. On the basis of the written report of informant, this case\n\nwas instituted for the offences\nu/s 302\n,\n376(2)(f)\nof I.P.C. and\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nSection 6\nPOCSO Act and accordingly, the cognizance of the\n\noffences was taken against accused/appellant Indar Oraon\n\ncharges were framed for the offences U/s 302, 376(2)(f)\nIPC\n\nand\nSection 6\nPOCSO Act and accordingly trial procedded.\n\n27. In course of trial, the prosecution has examined\n\naltogether 17 witnesses. Their depositions are being referred\n\nherein :-\n\nP.W. 1 is Mehrani Orain. She deposed that occurrence\n\ntook place seven months ago on Saturday. It was 5.30 PM. At\n\nthat time, she was bringing mud to her house from the field.\n\nIn the meanwhile, she noticed that Indar Oraon dragged the\n\nvictim inside the bathroom and bolted the bathroom. After\n\nsometime he rushed out from bathroom with having child\n\n(victim/deceased) in his hand and laid the said child beneath\n\nflowering plant. He also shrouded the said child by sack and\n\neloped from the spot. Then she screamed. Villagers gathered\n\nthere and it was traced out that the said child was dead.\n\nVillagers apprehended Indar Oraon. Prior to the alleged\n\noccurrence Indar Oraon had killed her grand-mother. She\n\nidentified the accused Indar Oraon present in the court room\n\nthrough Video Conferencing.\n\nIn cross-examination, at paragraph-5 she has stated\n\nthat when she was bringing mud at her house then she\n\nnoticed that the accused was loitering with deceased/victim.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nShe did not notice as to what was done with the\n\nvictim/deceased inside the bathroom.\n\nP.W. 2 is Sukhmaniya Oraon.

(PW\n\n16), no ocular witness was traced out in course of\n\ninvestigation to vindicate the alleged occurrence of ravishment\n\nand murder of the deceased/victim by the hands of accused\n\nIndar Oraon. In such situation the prosecution case rests\n\nupon circumstantial evidence.\n\n30. Thus, before venturing to the merit of the case it would\n\nbe apt to discuss herein the settled proposition of law on the\n\nissue of circumstantial evidence based up the last seen theory.\n\n31. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the year 1952, in the\n\njudgment rendered in Hanumant Son of Govind Nargundkar\n\nvs. State of Madhya Pradesh [AIR 1952 SC 343] has laid\n\ndown the parameters under which, the case of circumstantial\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nevidence is to be evaluated, which suggests that: \"It is well to\n\nremember that in cases where the evidence is of a\n\ncircumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the\n\nconclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance\n\nbe fully established, and all the facts so established should be\n\nconsistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.\n\nAgain, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and\n\ntendency and they should be such as to exclude every\n\nhypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other words,\n\nthere must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to\n\nleave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with\n\nthe innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show\n\nthat within all human probability the act must have been done\n\nby the accused. ......\"\n\n32. The judgment referred in Hanumant (supra) has been\n\nconsistently followed by Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment\n\nrendered in Tufail (Alias) Simmi Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n\n[(1969) 3 SCC 198];\nRam Gopal Vs. State of\n\nMaharashtra\n[(\n1972) 4 SCC 625] and Sharad Birdhichand\n\nSarda Vs. State of Maharashtra\n[(1984) 4 SCC 116 and also\n\nin Musheer Khan alias\nBadshah Khan & Anr. Vs. State of\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n[(2010) 2 SCC 748.\n\n33. The Hon'ble Apex Court in\nMusheer Khan\n(Supra) while\n\ndiscussing the nature of circumstantial evidence and the\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nburden of proof of prosecution has held as under paragraph\n\nnos. 39 to 46 as under:\n\n\"39. In a case of circumstantial evidence, one must look\nfor complete chain of circumstances and not on snapped\nand scattered links which do not make a complete\nsequence. This Court finds that this case is entirely\nbased on circumstantial evidence. While appreciating\ncircumstantial evidence, the Court must adopt a cautious\napproach as circumstantial evidence is \"inferential\nevidence\" and proof in such a case is derivable by\ninference from circumstances.\n\n40.Chief Justice Fletcher Moulton once observed that\n\"proof does not mean rigid mathematical formula\" since\n\"that is impossible\". However, proof must mean such\nevidence as would induce a reasonable man to come to a\ndefinite conclusion. Circumstantial evidence, on the other\nhand, has been compared by Lord Coleridge \"like a\ngossamer thread, light and as unsubstantial as the air\nitself and may vanish with the merest of touches\". The\nlearned Judge also observed that such evidence may be\nstrong in parts but it may also leave great gaps and rents\nthrough which the accused may escape. Therefore,\ncertain rules have been judicially evolved for appreciation\nof circumstantial evidence.\n\n41. To my mind, the first rule is that the facts alleged as\nthe basis of any legal inference from circumstantial\nevidence must be clearly proved beyond any reasonable\ndoubt. If conviction rests solely on circumstantial\nevidence, it must create a network from which there is no\nescape for the accused. The facts evolving out of such\ncircumstantial evidence must be such as not to admit of\nany inference except that of guilt of the accused.\n(See\nRaghav Prapanna Tripathi v. State of U.P.\n[AIR 1963\nSC 74 : (1963) 1 Cri LJ 70] )\n\n42. The second principle is that all the links in the chain\nof evidence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt and\nthey must exclude the evidence of guilt of any other\nperson than the accused. (See State of U.P. v. Dr.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nRavindra Prakash Mittal [(1992) 3 SCC 300 : 1992 SCC\n(Cri) 642 : 1992 Cri LJ 3693] , SCC p. 309, para 20.)\n\n43. While appreciating circumstantial evidence, we must\nremember the principle laid down in\nAshraf Ali v. King\nEmperor\n[21 CWN 1152 : 43 IC 241] (IC at para 14) that\nwhen in a criminal case there is conflict between\npresumption of innocence and any other presumption,\nthe former must prevail.\n\n44. The next principle is that in order to justify the\ninference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be\nincompatible with the innocence of the accused and are\nincapable of explanation upon any other reasonable\nhypothesis except his guilt.\n\n45. When a murder charge is to be proved solely on\ncircumstantial evidence, as in this case, presumption of\ninnocence of the accused must have a dominant\nrole.\nIn\nNibaran Chandra Roy v. King Emperor\n[11 CWN\n1085] it was held that the fact that an accused person\nwas found with a gun in his hand immediately after a\ngun was fired and a man was killed on the spot from\nwhich the gun was fired may be strong circumstantial\nevidence against the accused, but it is an error of law to\nhold that the burden of proving innocence lies upon the\naccused under such circumstances. It seems, therefore,\nto follow that whatever force a presumption arising\nunder\nSection 106\nof the Evidence Act may have in civil\nor in less serious criminal cases, in a trial for murder it is\nextremely weak in comparison with the dominant\npresumption of innocence.\n\n46. The same principles have been followed by the\nConstitution Bench of this Court in Govinda Reddy v.\n\nState of Mysore [AIR 1960 SC 29 : 1960 Cri LJ 137]\nwhere the learned Judges quoted the principles\nlaid down\nin\nHanumant Govind Nargundkar v. State of M.P. [(1952)\n2 SCC 71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 : 1953 Cri LJ 129] The ratio\nin Govind [(1952) 2 SCC 71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 :1953 Cri\nLJ 129] quoted in AIR para 5, p. 30 of the Report in\nGovinda Reddy [AIR 1960 SC 29 : 1960 Cri LJ 137] are:\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n\"5. ... „10. ... in cases where the evidence is of a\ncircumstantial nature, the circumstances [which lead to\nthe conclusion of guilt should be in the first instance]\nfully established, and all the facts so established should\nbe consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the\naccused. Again, the circumstances should be of a\nconclusive nature and tendency and they should be such\nas to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be\nproved. In other words, there must be a chain of evidence\nso far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for\na conclusion consistent with the innocence of the\naccused and it must be [shown] that within all human\nprobability the act must have been [committed] by the\naccused.‟ [As observed in Hanumant Govind Nargundkar\nv. State of M.P., (1952) 2 SCC 71 : AIR 1952 SC 343 at\npp. 345-46, para 10.]\n\" The same principle has also been\nfollowed by this Court in\nMohan Lal Pangasa v. State of\nU.P.\n[(1974) 4 SCC 607 : 1974 SCC (Cri) 643 : AIR 1974\nSC 1144] \"\n\n34. Thus, it is evident that for proving the charge on the\n\nbasis of circumstantial evidence, it would be necessary that\n\nevidence so available must induce a reasonable man to come\n\nto a definite conclusion of proving of guilt; meaning thereby\n\nthere must be a chain of evidence so far it is complete as not\n\nto leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent\n\nwith the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to\n\nshow that within all human probability the act must have\n\nbeen done by the accused.\n\n35. There is no dispute regarding the settled position of law\n\nthat in the case of circumstantial evidence, the chain is to be\n\ncomplete then only there will be conviction of the concerned\n\naccused person but, the circumstances should be of a\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nconclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to\n\nexclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.\n\nIn other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far\n\ncomplete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a\n\nconclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it\n\nmust be such as to show that within all human probability\n\nthe act must have been done by the accused.\n\n36. The same view has been taken by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in\nBakhshish Singh vs. State of Punjab\n, (1971) 3 SCC\n\n182 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that the\n\nprinciple in a case resting on circumstantial evidence is well\n\nsettled that the circumstances put forward must be\n\nsatisfactorily proved and those circumstances should be\n\nconsistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.\n\nThese circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and\n\ntendency and they should be such as to exclude every\n\nhypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other words,\n\nthere must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to\n\nleave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with\n\nthe innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show\n\nthat within all human probability the act must have been done\n\nby the accused.\n\n37. The Hon'ble Apex Court while laying down such\n\nproposition in the said case has considered the factual aspect\n\nrevolving around therein and while considering the fact has\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nonly found the incriminating evidence against the appellant\n\nwas his pointing the place where the dead body of the\n\ndeceased had been thrown which the Hon'ble Apex Court has\n\nnot considered to be circumstantial evidence though\n\nundoubtedly it raises a strong suspicion against the appellant.\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court while coming to such conclusion has\n\nobserved that even if he was not a party to the murder, the\n\nappellant could have come to know the place where the dead\n\nbody of the deceased had been thrown. Hence anyone who saw\n\nthose parts could have inferred that the dead body must have\n\nbeen thrown into the river near about that place. In that\n\npretext, the law has been laid down at paragraph-9 thereof,\n\nwhich reads as under:\n\n\"9. The law relating to circumstantial evidence has been\nstated by this Court in numerous decisions. It is needless\nto refer to them as the law on the point is well-settled. In\na case resting on circumstantial evidence, the\ncircumstances put forward must be satisfactorily proved\nand those circumstances should be consistent only with\nthe hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again those\ncircumstances should be of a conclusive nature and\ntendency and they should be such as to exclude every\nhypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other\nwords, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete\nas not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused and it must\nbe such as to show that within all human probability the\nact must have been done by the accused.\"\n\n38. Further, in this regard, reference is required to be made\n\nof the judgments rendered by Hon'ble Apex Court in\nAnwar\n\nAli Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh\n(2020) 10 SCC 166 and\n2026:\nJHHC:140-DB\n\nMohd. Yonus Ali Tarafdar Vs. State of West Bengal\n,\n\n(2020) 3 SCC 747 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has laid\n\ndown the following propositions to be taken into consideration\n\nin a case based on circumstantial evidences :-\n\n(i) The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is\n\nto be drawn should be fully established;\n\n(ii) The circumstances should be of a definite tendency\n\nunerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused;\n\n(iii) The circumstances taken cumulatively should form a\n\nchain so far complete that there is no escape from the\n\nconclusion that within all human probability the crime\n\nwas committed by the accused;\n\n(iv) The circumstances should be consistent only with the\n\nhypothesis regarding the guilt of the accused; and\n\n(v) They must exclude every possible hypothesis except the\n\none which is sought to be proved.\n\n39. The authoritative judgment in the aforesaid context is\n\nthe\nSharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra\n,\n\n(supra) wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held all the above\n\nfive principles to be the golden principles which constitute the\n\n\"panchsheel\" of the proof of a case based on circumstantial\n\nevidence. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the said case as under\n\nparagraph-155, 156, 157, 158 and 159 has been pleased to\n\nhold that if these conditions are fulfilled only then a Court can\n\nuse a false explanation or a false defence as an additional link\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nto lend an assurance to the court and not otherwise.\n\nParagraphs-155, 156, 157, 158 and 159 of\nthe said judgment\n\nread as under:\n\n\"155. It may be interesting to note that as regards the\nmode of proof in a criminal case depending on\ncircumstantial evidence, in the absence of a corpus\ndelicti, the statement of law as to proof of the same was\n\nlaid down by\nGresson, J. (and concurred by 3 more\nJudges) in King v. Horry [1952 NZLR 111] thus: \"Before\nhe can be convicted, the fact of death should be proved\nby such circumstances as render the commission of the\ncrime morally certain and leave no ground for reasonable\ndoubt: the circumstantial evidence should be so cogent\nand compelling as to convince a jury that upon no\nrational hypothesis other than murder can the facts be\naccounted for.\" 156. Lord Goddard slightly modified the\nexpression \"morally certain\" by \"such circumstances as\nrender the commission of the crime certain\". 157. This\nindicates the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence\nthat a case can be said to be proved only when there is\ncertain and explicit evidence and no person can be\nconvicted on pure moral conviction.\nHorry case [1952\nNZLR 111] was approved by this Court in\nAnant\nChintaman Lagu v. State of Bombay\n[\nAIR 1960 SC 500]\nLagu\ncase [AIR 1960 SC 500] as also the principles\nenunciated by this Court in Hanumant case [(1952) 2\nSCC 71] have been uniformly and consistently followed in\nall later decisions of this Court without any single\nexception.\n\nTo quote a few cases -- Tufail case [(1969) 3\nSCC 198] , Ramgopal case [(1972) 4 SCC 625] ,\nChandrakant Nyalchand Seth v. State of Bombay [\nCriminal Appeal No 120 of 1957,],\nDharambir Singh v.\nState of Punjab [ Criminal Appeal No\n98 of 1958,].\n\nThere\nare a number of other cases where although Hanumant\ncase [(1952) 2 SCC] has not been expressly noticed but\nthe same principles have been expounded and reiterated,\nas in\nNaseem Ahmed v. Delhi Administration\n[(1974) 3\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nSCC 668, 670] , Mohan Lal Pangasa v. State of U.P.\n[(\n1974) 4 SCC 607,] , Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit v. State\nof Maharashtra\n[(1981) 2 SCC 35, 39] and M.G. Agarwal\nv. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1963 SC 200 : (1963) 2 SCR\n405,] -- a five-Judge Bench decision. 158.\n\nIt may be\nnecessary here to notice a very forceful argument\nsubmitted by the Additional Solicitor General relying on a\ndecision of this Court in\nDeonandan Mishra v. State of\nBihar\n[AIR 1955 SC 801] to supplement his argument\nthat if the defence case is false it would constitute an\nadditional link so as to fortify the prosecution case. With\ndue respect to the learned Additional Solicitor-General we\nare unable to agree with the interpretation given by him\nof the aforesaid case, the relevant portion of which may\nbe extracted thus: \"But in a case like this where the\nvarious links as stated above have been satisfactorily\nmade out and the circumstances point to the appellant\nas the probable assailant, with reasonable definiteness\nand in proximity to the deceased as regards time and\nsituation. such absence of explanation or false\nexplanation would itself be an additional link which\ncompletes the chain.\"\n\n159. It will be seen that this Court while taking into\naccount the absence of explanation or a false explanation\ndid hold that it will amount to be an additional link to\ncomplete the chain but these observations must be read\nin the light of what this Court said earlier viz. before a\nfalse explanation can be used as additional link, the\nfollowing essential conditions must be satisfied: (1)\nvarious links in the chain of evidence led by the\nprosecution have been satisfactorily proved, (2) the said\ncircumstance points to the guilt of the accused with\nreasonable definiteness, and (3) the circumstance is in\nproximity to the time and situation.\"\n\n40. The foremost requirement in the case of circumstantial\n\nevidence is that the chain is to be completed.\nIn\nPadala Veera\n\nReddy v. State of A.P.\n[1989 Supp. (2) SCC 706], the\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nHon'ble Apex Court held that when a case rests upon\n\ncircumstantial evidence, the following tests must be satisfied:\n\n\"10. ... (1) the circumstances from which an inference of\nguilt is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly\nestablished; (2) those circumstances should be of a\ndefinite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the\naccused; (3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively,\nshould form a chain so complete that there is no escape\nfrom the conclusion that within all human probability the\ncrime was committed by the accused and none else; and\n(4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain\nconviction must be complete and incapable of\nexplanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt\nof the accused and such evidence should not only be\nconsistent with the guilt of the accused but should be\ninconsistent with his innocence.\"\n\n41. Thus, it is evident that for proving the charge on the\n\nbasis of circumstantial evidence, it would be necessary that\n\nevidence so available must induce a reasonable man to come\n\nto a definite conclusion of proving of guilt; meaning thereby\n\nthere must be a chain of evidence so far it is complete as not\n\nto leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent\n\nwith the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to\n\nshow that within all human probability the act must have\n\nbeen done by the accused.\n\n42. A theory of \"accused last seen in the company of the\n\ndeceased\" is a strong circumstance against the accused while\n\nappreciating the circumstantial evidence. In such cases,\n\nunless the accused is able to explain properly the material\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\ncircumstances appearing against him, he can be held guilty\n\nfor commission of offence for which he is charged.\n\n43. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nSatpal v. State of\n\nHaryana\n, (2018) 6 SCC 610 has observed that when there is\n\nno eyewitness to the occurrence but only circumstances\n\ncoupled with the fact of the deceased having been last seen\n\nwith the appellant, the Criminal jurisprudence and the\n\nplethora of judicial precedents leave little room for\n\nreconsideration of the basic principles for invocation of the\n\nlast seen theory as a facet of circumstantial evidence.\n\nSuccinctly stated, it may be a weak kind of evidence by itself\n\nto found conviction upon the same singularly. For ready\n\nreference the relevant paragraph is being quoted as under:\n\n\"6. We have considered the respective submissions and\nthe evidence on record. There is no eyewitness to the\noccurrence but only circumstances coupled with the fact\nof the deceased having been last seen with the appellant.\nCriminal jurisprudence and the plethora of judicial\nprecedents leave little room for reconsideration of the\nbasic principles for invocation of the last seen theory as a\nfacet of circumstantial evidence. Succinctly stated, it may\nbe a weak kind of evidence by itself to found conviction\nupon the same singularly. But when it is coupled with\nother circumstances such as the time when the deceased\nwas last seen with the accused, and the recovery of the\ncorpse being in very close proximity of time, the accused\nowes an explanation under\nSection 106\nof the Evidence\nAct with regard to the circumstances under which death\nmay have taken place. If the accused offers no\nexplanation, or furnishes a wrong explanation, absconds,\nmotive is established, and there is corroborative evidence\navailable inter alia in the form of recovery or otherwise\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nforming a chain of circumstances leading to the only\ninference for guilt of the accused, incompatible with any\npossible hypothesis of innocence, conviction can be based\non the same. If there be any doubt or break in the link of\nchain of circumstances, the benefit of doubt must go to\nthe accused. Each case will therefore have to be\nexamined on its own facts for invocation of the doctrine.\"\n\n44. In the backdrop of the aforesaid discussed settled legal\n\nposition this Court is now adverting to the factual aspect of\n\nthe instant case in order to find that whether charges against\n\nthe present appellant have been proved beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n45. The evidences adduced by PW 1, PW 2, PW 5, PW 6 and\n\nPW 9 support the case of prosecution in palpable way in\n\nrespect of \"last seen circumstances \".\n\n46. P.W. 5, PW 6 and PW 9 are the child witnesses who are\n\nsaid to be playing with the victim/deceased at 3.00 PM on\n\n24.12.2022 at village Areya, Bagru, Lohardaga.\n\n47. P.W. 5 is Bipasa Oraon. This witness is aged about 8\n\nyears. She deposed that she is the student of class IV and the\n\nalleged occurrence took place seven months ago. She had\n\nreturned from her school at 3.00 PM. Thereafter she, Priti,\n\nKhushboo and deceased/victim were playing in court yard.\n\nIndar rushed on the spot and he provided 20 rupees to them.\n\nHe also provided 50 rupees to the deceased/victim. He also\n\nasked her and her friends to go outside to have some\n\nrefreshment. He grasped the deceased victim due to which\n\nvictim did not accompany her. Thereafter she rushed to the\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nshop to have chocolate and biscuit. When she returned from\n\nthe shop then deceased and accused Indar were not present\n\nthere. When they were going home then the mother of\n\ndeceased asked whereabout of her daughter then she narrated\n\nthat Indar was loitering with her. One lady visited towards her\n\nwashroom then she noticed the dead body of deceased was\n\nlying there shrouded with sack. She noticed that blood\n\npercolated from her mouth and 50 rupees note was lying in\n\nher hand. She came to have learnt that Indar slayed her. In\n\ncross-examination she reiterated that she took 20 rupees from\n\nIndar and rushed towards shop. After half an hour she\n\nreturned from shop. She Has also asserted that when she was\n\ngoing to the shop then deceased/victim was along with Indar.\n\n48. From the aforesaid deposition, no vital contradiction is\n\noriginating which could cast doubt over her veracity and her\n\nversion that the accused was last seen with victim/deceased\n\nwhen she was dispelled by the accused Indar Oraon from the\n\nplace where she was playing with victim/deceased remained\n\nunassailed.\n\n49. P.W. 6 is Khushboo Kumari. This witness is aged about\n\n11 years. She deposed that she is the student of class IV and\n\nthe alleged occurrence took place seven months ago. She had\n\nreturned from her school at 3.00 PM. Thereafter she, Priti,\n\nBipasa and deceased/victim were playing in court yard. Indar\n\nrushed on the spot and he provided 20 rupees to them. He\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nalso provided 50 rupees to the deceased. He also caused her\n\nand her friends to go outside to have some sweets. He asked\n\ndeceased/victim to stay with him and let her friends to visit\n\nthe shop. Thereafter she along with her friends (except\n\ndeceased) rushed to the shop. When she along with her friends\n\nreturned from the shop then they found deceased and accused\n\nIndar missing from the said court yard. She narrated to the\n\ndeceased's mother about loitering of deceased with accused\n\nIndar. She came to have learnt that Indar slayed deceased in\n\nthe bathroom covering her dead body behind the bathroom by\n\ncement sack. During para no. 13 of cross-examination she\n\nasserted that Indar coaxed her and her friends by providing\n\nmoney. No vital contradiction is emanating from her cross-\n\nexamination which could cast doubt over her veracity and her\n\nversion that the accused was last seen with victim/deceased\n\nwhen she was dispelled by the accused Indar Oraon from the\n\nplace where she was playing with victim/deceased remained\n\nintact.\n\n50. Another material witness is PW 9 Priti Oraon who is\n\nsaid to have been playing with PW 5 and PW 6 and\n\nvictim/deceased on the alleged date and time of occurrence.\n\nThis witness is aged about 06 years. She has deposed that she\n\nwas the student of class II and asserted that on the alleged\n\ndate of occurrence she alongwith Khushboo, Bipasa and\n\ndeceased/victim was playing in court yard. Indar rushed on\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nthe spot and he provided 20 rupees to them. He also provided\n\n50 rupees to the deceased. He also caused her and her friends\n\nto go outside to have biscuit. He ushered deceased/victim\n\nalong with him. Informant asked whereabout of her daughter\n\nthen she narrated to her that the deceased victim was with\n\nIndar. Indar took the deceased/victim towards the bathroom\n\nof Gabbar Oraon. Indar slayed the victim and concealed her\n\nbody behind bathroom. During cross-examination she\n\nasserted that she was provided 20 rupees and she rushed to\n\nthe shop to have some biscuit. Her friend (deceased/victim)\n\nwas along with Indar at that time. They returned back after\n\nhaving biscuit then she noticed that deceased victim was not\n\npresent there. No vital contradiction is emanating from her\n\ncross-examination which could cast doubt over her veracity\n\nand her version that the accused was last seen with\n\nvictim/deceased when she was dispelled by the accused Indar\n\nOraon from the place where she was playing with\n\nvictim/deceased remained unassailed.\n\n51. Herein the learned counsel for the appellant has raised\n\nthe issue that the learned Trial Court did not record proper\n\nsatisfaction that P.W. 5,6 and 9 being child witnesses were\n\ncompetent to understand the facts and circumstances of the\n\nmatter.\n\n52. In the aforesaid context it needs to refer herein that a\n\nchild of tender age can be allowed to testify if he or she has\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nintellectual capacity to understand questions and give rational\n\nanswers thereto. A provision has been made in the Indian\n\nEvidence as under\nSection 118\nof the Indian Evidence Act\n\nwherein it has been provided that the testimony of the tender\n\nwitness can be accepted subject to verification of the\n\nintellectual capacity of such witness. For, ready reference the\n\nsection 118 is being quoted as under:\n\n118. Who may testify. --All persons shall be competent to testify unless\nthe Court considers that they are prevented from understanding the\nquestions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those\nquestions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body\nor mind, or any other cause of the same kind.\n\nExplanation.-- A lunatic is not incompetent to testify, unless he is\nprevented by his lunacy from understandingthe questions put to him\nand giving rational answers to them.\n\n53. Further, the evidence of a child witness is not required\n\nto be rejected per se, but the court as a rule of prudence\n\nconsiders such evidence with close scrutiny and only on being\n\nconvinced about the quality thereof and reliability can record\n\nconviction, based thereon. Reference in this regard may be\n\ntaken from the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nin the case of Virendra alias Buddhu & Anr. Vs. State of\n\nUttat Pradesh [(2008) 16 582], relevant paragraph of which\n\nis quoted as under:\n\n19. A child of tender age can be allowed to testify if he or\nshe has intellectual capacity to understand questions\nand give rational answers thereto. The evidence of a child\nwitness is not required to be rejected per se, but the\ncourt as a rule of prudence considers such evidence with\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nclose scrutiny and only on being convinced about the\nquality thereof and reliability can record conviction,\nbased thereon.\n\n20.\nIn\nDattu Ramrao Sakhare v. State of\nMaharashtra\n[(1997) 5 SCC 341 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 685] it\nwas held as follows : (SCC p. 343, para 5) \"5. ... A child\nwitness if found competent to depose to the facts and\nreliable one such evidence could be the basis of\nconviction. In other words even in the absence of oath the\nevidence of a child witness can be considered\nunder\nSection 118\nof the Evidence Act provided that such\nwitness is able to understand the questions and able to\ngive rational answers thereof. The evidence of a child\nwitness and credibility thereof would depend upon the\ncircumstances of each case. The only precaution which\nthe court should bear in mind while assessing the\nevidence of a child witness is that the witness must be a\nreliable one and his/her demeanour must be like any\nother competent witness and there is no likelihood of\nbeing tutored.\"\n\n21. Subsequently, in Ratansinh Dalsukhbhai Nayak v.\n\nState of Gujarat [(2004) 1 SCC 64 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 7]\nwherein one of us (Dr. Arijit Pasayat) was a member the\nBench held that (SCC p. 67, para 7) though \"[t]he\ndecision on the question whether the child witness has\nsufficient intelligence primarily rests with the trial Judge\nwho notices his manners, his apparent possession or lack\nof intelligence, and the said Judge may resort to any\nexamination which will tend to disclose his capacity and\nintelligence as well as his understanding of the obligation\nof an oath.\"\n\nbut \"[t]he decision of the trial court may, however, be\ndisturbed by the higher court if from what is preserved in\nthe records, it is clear that his conclusion was\nerroneous\".\n\nThe\nBench further held\nas under : (Ratansinh case\n[(2004) 1 SCC 64 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 7] , SCC p. 67, para 7)\n\"7. ... This precaution is necessary because child\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nwitnesses are amenable to tutoring and often live in a\nworld of make-believe. Though it is an established\nprinciple that child witnesses are dangerous witnesses as\nthey are pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shaken\nand moulded, but it is also an accepted norm that if after\ncareful scrutiny of their evidence the court comes to the\nconclusion that there is an impress of truth in it, there is\nno obstacle in the way of accepting the evidence of a child\nwitness.\"\n\n54. The Hon'ble Apex Court further in the case judgment\n\nrendered in the case of\nNivrutti Pandurang Kokate & Ors Vs.\n\nState of Maharashtra\n[(2008) 12 SCC 565], wherein at\n\nparagraph 10 it has been held as under:\n\n10. \"6. ...\nThe Evidence Act, 1872\n(in short „the\nEvidence\n\nAct\n‟) does not prescribe any particular age as a\n\ndeterminative factor to treat a witness to be a competent\n\none. On the contrary,\nSection 118\nof the Evidence Act\n\nenvisages that all persons shall be competent to testify,\n\nunless the court considers that they are prevented from\n\nunderstanding the questions put to them or from giving\n\nrational answers to these questions, because of tender\n\nyears, extreme old age, disease--whether of mind, or any\n\nother cause of the same kind. A child of tender age can\n\nbe allowed to testify if he has intellectual capacity to\n\nunderstand questions and give rational answers thereto.\n\nThis position was concisely stated by Brewer, J. in\n\nWheeler v. United States [40 L Ed 244 : 159 US 523\n\n(1895)] . The evidence of a child witness is not required to\n\nbe rejected per se, but the court as a rule of prudence\n\nconsiders such evidence with close scrutiny and only on\n\nbeing convinced about the quality thereof and reliability\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\ncan record conviction, based thereon.\n\n(See\nSuryanarayana v. State of Karnataka\n[(2001) 9 SCC\n\n129 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 413] .)\n\n55. It is, thus, evident from the consideration made\n\nhereinabove in the context of\nSection 118\nof the Evidence Act\n\nthat all persons shall be competent to testify, unless the Court\n\nconsiders that they are prevented from understanding the\n\nquestion put to them or from giving rationale answers to the\n\nquestions, because of tender years, extreme old age, disease\n\nwhether of mind, or any other cause of the same kind. It\n\nfurther appears that a child of tender age can be allowed to\n\ntestify if he has intellectual capacity to understand questions\n\nand given rationale thereto. It further appears that the\n\nevidence of a child witness is not required to be rejected per\n\nso, but the court as a rule of prudence considers such\n\nevidence with close scrutiny and only on being convinced\n\nabout the quality thereof and reliability can record conviction.\n\n56. In the instant case the evidence adduced by PW 5, PW\n\n6 and PW 9 on the point that the victim/deceased was last\n\nseen with the accused on 24.12.2022 at 3.00 PM and\n\nthereafter she was found dead nearby the washroom of Tewasi\n\nOraon remained unshaken and these versions of PW 5, PW 6\n\nand PW 9 have been also corroborated by evidences\n\npropounded by PW 1 and PW 2.\n\n57. P.W. 1 is Mehrani Orain. She deposed that occurrence\n\ntook place seven months ago on Saturday. It was 5.30 PM. At\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nthat time, she was bringing mud to her house from the field.\n\nIn the meanwhile, she noticed that Indar Oraon dragged the\n\nvictim inside the bathroom and bolted the bathroom. After\n\nsome time, he rushed out from bathroom with having child\n\n(victim) in his hand and laid the said child beneath flowering\n\nplant. He also shrouded the said child by sack and eloped\n\nfrom the spot.\n\n58. P.W. 2 is Sukhmaniya Oraon. She deposed that alleged\n\noccurrence took place 6-7 months ago. At 4.00 PM Indar\n\nOraon was seen loitering with the victim/deceased. Thereafter\n\nshe heard the screaming sound of Mehrani (PW 1) and noticed\n\nthat the said victim child was lying dead beneath the plant of\n\nMarigold. Indar Oraon had killed her.\n\n59. Thus, from the aforesaid evidences it is established that\n\nthe accused Indar Oraon was last seen with victim/deceased\n\nand there after in vey short interval of time the victim was\n\nfound to be dead near the bathroom and deceased body was\n\nshrouded with sack.\n\n60. The Inquest Report (Ext. P-8) is the document to reveal\n\nthat the dead body of the deceased/victim was recovered by\n\nthe Police after preparing inquest report at 17.45 hours on\n\n24.12.2022 and it was also depicted in the Ext. P-8 that the\n\nvictim/deceased was strangulated to death after being raped.\n\nMoreover prosecution witnesses PW 1, PW 2, PW 3, PW 4, PW\n\n5, PW 6, PW 7, PW 10 and PW 11 have testified in their\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nevidences that the deceased/victim was found to be dead near\n\nthe washroom of Tewasi Oraon.\n\n61. PW 13 is Dr. Anand Kumar who conducted postmortem\n\nexamination alongwith Dr. Ajay Kumar Bhagat (PW 14) on the\n\ndead body of victim on 25.12.2022 and as per postmortem\n\nreport (Ext. P5) the injuries were antemortem in nature caused\n\nby hard and blunt object and death was due to asphyxia as a\n\nresult of physical strangulation. Further, it has been opined\n\nthat the deceased had been sexually assaulted by hard and\n\nblunt object(s), with evidence of forceful vaginal and anal\n\npenetration.\n\n62. No explanation has been given in the statement of\n\naccused Indar Oraon\nu/s 313\nCr.P.C. as to when he parted\n\nthe company of victim/deceased. Also, no explanation is there\n\nas to what happened inside the bathroom of Tewasi Oraon\n\nwith the victim. Accused remained silent when he was\n\nexamined\nu/s 313\nCr.P.C. and it was a mere denial by the\n\naccused of all the incriminating circumstances which were put\n\nto him\nu/s 313\nCr.P.C. The silence on the part of the accused,\n\nin such a matter wherein he is expected to come out with an\n\nexplanation, leads to an adverse inference against the\n\naccused.\n\n63. The circumstance of deceased being last seen alive in\n\nthe company of the deceased is a vital link in the chain of\n\nother circumstances but on its own strength it is insufficient\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nto sustain conviction unless the time-gap between the\n\ndeceased being last seen alive with the accused and recovery\n\nof dead body of the deceased is so small that possibility of any\n\nother person being the author of the crime is just about\n\nimpossible. Last seen theory is considered to be a weak basis\n\nfor conviction. However, when the same is coupled with other\n\nfactors such as when the deceased was last seen with the\n\naccused, proximity of time to the recovery of the body of\n\ndeceased etc.\n\n64. The accused is bound to give an explanation under\n\nsection 106\nof the Evidence Act, 1872. If he does not do so, or\n\nfurnishes what may be termed as wrong explanation or it a\n\nmotive is established-pleading securely to the conviction of the\n\naccused closing out the possibility of any other hypothesis,\n\nthen a conviction can be based thereon. This opinion of this\n\ncourt is fortified from the\nratio\nlaid down in\n\nSatpal Singh Vs\n\nState of Haryana\n(supra) .\n\n65. As per Ext. P-10, the alleged time span of the\n\noccurrence is from 15.00 Hours to 16.35 Hours on\n\n24.12.2022. As per Ext. P-8 the inquest report regarding\n\nrecovery of the dead body of victim was prepared by the Police\n\n(PW 15) at 17.45 Hours on 24.12.2022. The time-gap between\n\ndeceased being last seen with accused and recovery of dead\n\nbody of deceased is small and no plausible explanation as to\n\nhow the victim was strangulated to death after being raped\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nwas adduced by the accused\nu/s 313\nCr.P.C. as well as\n\nSection 106\nof Evidence Act. Chapter - VII under Part -\nIII of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, 1872\ndeals with \"Burden of Proof\"\n\nSection 101 provides that when a person is bound to prove the\n\nexistence of any fact it is said that the burden of proof lies on\n\nthat person. However, there may be a case in which it is not\n\nknown to the prosecution how the death of a person has\n\noccurred. Wherever it is found that a fact which is relevant is\n\nwithin the special knowledge of the accused and such fact\n\ncannot be unearthed by the investigating officer by any\n\namount of enquiry and investigation by operation of\nsection\nof the Indian Evidence Act the burden would shift upon\n\nthe person who has special knowledge of such fact.\nSection\nIndian Evidence Act incorporates the principle of reverse\n\nburden. Hence adverse inference can be drawn against the\n\naccused\nu/s 106\nEvidence Act. Fact so established are\n\nincessant and consistent to evince that the act of\n\nstrangulation and ravishment of deceased/victim has been\n\ndone by the accused Indar Oraon.\n\n66. PW 4 (victim/deceased mother-cum-informant) deposed\n\nthat occurrence took place on 24.12.2022. Her daughter was\n\nplaying with her friends. She was indulged in some cultivation\n\nwork and when she returned home at 4.30 PM, her daughter\n\nwas found to be missing. Then she inquired the whereabout of\n\nher daughter from her daughter's friends. They divulged to her\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nthat Indar Oraon provided them 20 rupees and he also\n\nprovided 50 rupees to the deceased victim. They also narrated\n\nto her that they rushed towards shop for biscuit and chocolate\n\nwhile Indar was loitering with the deceased victim. Frantic\n\nsearch was made by her then she rushed towards chowk\n\nwhere she came across Indar Oraon who was eating chowmin\n\nthere. When she inquired the matter from Indar then Indar\n\nOraon started trembling and the chowmin plate fell down on\n\nground. Sukhmaniya and Hiramani visited there who unfolded\n\nto her that her daughter was lying behind the bathroom of\n\nDewasi Oraon. Indar Oraon strove hard to elope from there\n\nbut Sudhir Oraon and Bablu Oraon apprehended Indar after\n\nchase who confessed before the village that he stifled the\n\ndeceased/victim after committing rape upon her in the\n\nbathroom of Dewasi Oraon. Police visited there. There were\n\nscratch mark over the cheek of deceased. There was\n\nstrangulation mark over the neck of the deceased. Deceased\n\nwas of five years and two months at the time of alleged\n\noccurrence. Blood also exuded from the private part of\n\ndeceased victim. No vital contradictions or paradoxical\n\nstatement is emanating during her cross-examination which\n\ncould cast doubt over her veracity as PW 7, PW 8, PW 10, PW\n\n11 and PW 12 have also countenanced the version of PW 4 in\n\ncandid and limpid manner. The version of PW 4 has been\n\ncorroborated and invigorated by other prosecution witnesses\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nas mentioned above. Moreover stringent documents i.e. Ext. P-\n\n2, Ext. P5, Ext. P-8 also go to vindicate the flawless evidence of\n\nPW 4.\n\n67. PW 7, PW 8, PW 10, PW 11 and PW 12 have asserted in\n\ntheir evidences that accused Indar Oraon was taking chowmin\n\nat shop situated Jogiya Chowk and in the meanwhile\n\ninformant (PW 4) asked accused Indar Oraon regarding\n\nwhereabout of her daughter (victim/deceased) then the\n\nchowmin plate slipped down from the hands of the accused\n\nand he strove hard to elope from there but he was\n\napprehended by PW 7 and PW 8 on the spot. PW 7, PW 8, PW\n\n10, PW 11 and PW 12 are reliable and trustworthy witnesses\n\nbecause their evidences are devoid of paradoxical and\n\ninconsistent statements. The incessant and flawless evidences\n\nof PW 7, PW 8, PW 10, PW 11 and PW 12 go to evince that the\n\naccused Indar Oraon confessed before them and villagers that\n\nhe after committing rape upon the victim/deceased inside the\n\nbathroom of Tewasi Oraon strangulated her to death and also\n\nshrouded her dead body with a sack beneath the Marigold\n\nFlower Plant. The stringent, consistent and corroborative\n\nversions of PW 4, PW 7, PW 8, PW 10, PW 11 and PW 12 go to\n\ndepict that the accused Indar Oraon strove hard to elope from\n\nthe chowmin shop when he was asked about deceased/victim\n\nand his chowmin plate also slipped down to earth. These\n\ncircumstances and the conduct of the accused in front of\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nreliable prosecution witnesses are well relevant\nu/s 6\nand\nof\n\nIndian Evidence Act.\n\n68. From the cogent evidences of prosecution, it is well\n\nestablished that the accused Indar Oraon, on 24.12.2022, who\n\nwas familiar to the deceased/victim as being the dweller of the\n\nsame village that of informant, enticed away the\n\ndeceased/victim towards the bathroom of Tewasi Oraon while\n\nvictim/deceased was playing with other children.\n\n69. It is also well established and proved through the\n\ncircumstantial chain that accused Indar Oraon caused other\n\nchildren to have some refreshment and thereafter enticed the\n\ndeceased/victim towards secluded place inside the bathroom\n\nof Tewasi Oraon. It has been also proved by cogent\n\nprosecution evidences that the victim/deceased was last seen\n\nwith the accused Indar Oraon on 24.12.2022 during evening-\n\nperiod and accused was also seen covering the body of\n\ndeceased beneath the flower plant situated near the bathroom\n\nof Tewasi Oraon. In this case the alleged place of occurrence\n\nwas affirmed by the I.O. which is the secluded place nearby\n\nthe marigold flower plant situated near bathroom of Tewasi\n\nOraon. It is also well established that the being salacious\n\naccused Indar Oraon raped the victim/deceased who was\n\nminor and aged about 5 years and was also well acquainted\n\nwith the accused. Ext. P8 is a stringent and rattling document\n\nto unfold that the deceased/victim was manually strangulated\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nafter being raped and antemortem injuries were also found to\n\nbe present on her person.\n\n70. The learned counsel for the appellant has contended\n\nthat SFSL report negates the involvement of the accused/\n\nappellant in the alleged occurrence.\n\n71. It needs to refer herein that in the case of\nRanjitsing\n\nBrahmajeetsing Sharma vs. State of Maharashtra\n, 2005\n\nCrLJ 2533 the Hon'ble Apex Court by referring to the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court decision rendered in the case of R. vs.\n\nWatters, (2000) All.E.R. (D) 1469, has ruled that the DNA\n\nevidence may have a great significance where there is\n\nsupporting evidence, dependent of course, on the strength of\n\nthat evidence. In every case one has to put the DNA evidence\n\nin the context of the rest of the evidence and decide whether\n\ntaken as a whole, it does amount to a prima facie case.\n\n72. Further the DNA evidence is like any other expert\n\nopinion\nu/s 45\nof Evidence Act and its probative value may\n\nvary from case to case. If DNA evidence is not properly\n\ndocumented, collected, packaged and preserved, it will not\n\nmeet the legal and scientific requirements for admissibility in\n\na court of law.\n\n73. Herein, it needs to refer herein that Ext. P-7 is the SFSL\n\nreport and as per the said report DNA profiling could not be\n\nextracted from the materials seized by the Police in course of\n\ninvestigation as per seizure list (Ext. P-11). Further Non-\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\ngeneration of DNA profiling can't be a ground to negate the\n\ninvolvement of the accused in the alleged occurrence as Ext.\n\nP-5 (post-mortem report) has substantiated the fact that the\n\nvictim was manually strangulated to death after being raped\n\nand further just before the said gruesome act the victim was\n\nseen with the accused/appellant and this fact has been\n\nsubstantiated by the cogent evidence led by P.W. 5, 6 and 9,\n\ntherefore the contention of the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant is not tenable.\n\n74. Further the dead body of the deceased was found\n\nbeneath flowering plant shrouded by sack, which clearly\n\nshows that after committing rape and murder, the dead body\n\nwas thrown away in order to conceal the dead body, in an\n\nattempt to cause the disappearance of the evidence.\n\n75. The evidences of witnesses, clearly show that the\n\ndeceased girl was last seen with the accused, near the\n\nbathroom of Tewasi Oraon and short proximity of time the\n\ndead body of the victim is found and the entire alleged\n\noccurrence has been fully substantiated by the medical\n\nevidence.\n\n76. Thus, on the basis of discussion made hereinabove it is\n\nconsidered view of this Court that there is no illegality in the\n\nfindings of the Trial Court below, in convicting the present\n\nappellants for the offence under\nSections 302\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code and\nSection 6\nof the POCSO Act.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n77. We have heard learned counsel for both the sides in\n\ndetail on the point of sentence.\n\n78. Learned counsel for the State, supporting the death\n\nreference, has placed reliance upon the decisions of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in\nBachan Singh Vs. State of Punjab\n,\n\nreported in (1980) 2 SCC 684 and Machi Singh & Ors. Vs.\n\nState of Punjab, reported in (1983) 3 SCC 470, giving the\n\nnecessary guidelines for awarding the death sentence, and\n\nsubmitted that in Machi Singh's case (supra), it has been held\n\nthat when the victim of murder is an innocent child who could\n\nnot have or has not provided even an excuse, much less a\n\nprovocation, for murder, the case comes within the rarest of the\n\nrare category, and it is a fit case for imposing the death\n\nsentence.\n\n79. Learned counsel has further placed reliance upon the\n\ndecision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nBantu Vs. State of U.P.\n,\n\nreported in (2008) 11 SCC 113, which related to the rape and\n\nmurder of a child, aged about five years, wherein the Apex\n\nCourt held that the case fell within the category of rarest of\n\nrare cases, affirming the death sentence.\n\n80. Similarly, in\nShivaji Vs. State of Maharashtra\n,\n\nreported in (2008) 15 SCC 269, which related to rape and\n\nmurder of a child aged about nine years, it was held that the\n\nplea that in cases of circumstantial evidence, the death\n\nsentence should not be awarded, is without any logic. This\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\ncase was also found to be falling within the category of rarest\n\nof rare cases, and the death sentence to the accused was\n\naffirmed.\n\n81.\nIn\nMohd. Mannan Vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in\n\n(2011) 5 SCC 317, which related to rape and murder of a\n\nchild aged about eight years, again it was held to be falling\n\nwithin the rarest of rare category, and death sentence was\n\naffirmed by the Supreme Court, re-iterating the guidelines for\n\nimposing death sentence, as follows :-\n\n\"24. Further, crime being brutal and heinous itself does not\nturn the scale towards the death sentence. When the crime\nis committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical,\nrevolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and\nextreme indignation of the community and when collective\nconscience of the community is petrified, one has to lean\ntowards the death sentence. But this is not the end. If these\nfactors are present the court has to see as to whether the\naccused is a menace to the society and would continue to be\nso, threatening its peaceful and harmonious coexistence. The\ncourt has to further enquire and believe that the accused\ncondemned cannot be reformed or rehabilitated and shall\ncontinue with the criminal acts. In this way a balance sheet\nis to be prepared while considering the imposition of penalty\nof death of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and a\njust balance is to be struck. So long the death sentence is\nprovided in the statute and when collective conscience of the\ncommunity is petrified, it is expected that the holders of\njudicial power do not stammer dehors their personal opinion\nand inflict death penalty. These are the broad guidelines\nwhich this Court has laid down for imposition of the death\npenalty.\"\n\n82.\nIn\nVasanta Sampat Dupare Vs. State of Maharashtra\n,\n\nreported in (2015) 1 SCC 253, which related to rape and\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nmurder of a child aged about four years, who, after the rape\n\nwas committed upon her, was crushed to death by stone, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, finding\n\nthe case to be one under the category of rarest of rare cases.\n\nIn this case, the accused-appellant had also filed the Review\n\nPetition in the Supreme Court, which was again dismissed by\n\nthe Judgment, reported in (2017) 6 SCC 631.\n\n83. Placing reliance on these decisions, learned counsel for\n\nthe State submitted that the case in hand relates to murder of\n\nthe victim girl after commission of rape upon her by the\n\naccused and the case comes within the category of rarest of\n\nrare cases, and as such it is a fit case in which the death\n\nsentence awarded to the accused by the Trial Court below be\n\nconfirmed, irrespective of his age, family background or lack of\n\ncriminal antecedents, which cannot be considered as\n\nmitigating circumstances.\n\n84. On the other hand, learned counsel for the appellant\n\nhas submitted that simply because the case relates to rape\n\nand murder of a child, it does not come under the category of\n\nrarest of rare cases.\n\n85. Learned counsel has\nplaced reliance upon\nthe decisions\n\nof the Supreme Court in Sebastian Vs. State of Kerela,\n\nreported in (2010) 1 SCC 58, Ram Deo Prasad Vs. State of\n\nBihar, reported in (\n2013) 7 SCC 725, Tattu Lodhi Vs. State\n\nof M.P.\n, reported in (2016) 9 SCC 675, and in all these cases,\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nthe child aged between 2 to 7 years were murdered after\n\ncommitting rape upon them. The Supreme Court, in the facts\n\nof these cases, held that they do not come within the category\n\nof rarest of rare cases, and the death sentence awarded by the\n\nTrial Court below, and confirmed by the High Court, were\n\ncommuted to life imprisonment.\n\n86. Learned counsel has also\nplaced reliance upon\nthe\n\ndecision of\nRameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) Vs. State\n\nof Gujarat\n, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 764, which also related\n\nto rape and murder of a child by the guard of the building. The\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court laid down the law that it was\n\nobligatory upon the Trial Court to have given the finding as to\n\na possible rehabilitation and reformation and the possibility\n\nthat the accused could still be a useful member of the society,\n\nin case, he was given a chance to do so, and in absence of\n\nsuch finding, the death sentence awarded by the Trial Court\n\nand confirmed by the High Court, was commuted to the\n\nsentence for whole life, but subject to any remission or\n\ncommutation of sentence by the State Government for good\n\nand social reasons.\n\n87. Similar view was taken by the Apex Court in\nAmit Vs.\n\nState of U.P\n, reported in (2012) 4 SCC 107, which also\n\nrelated to rape and murder of a three years old child.\n\nIn the\n\nsaid case also, the ratio of\nRameshbhai Chandhubhai\n\nRathod\n's case (supra), was applied by the Supreme Court and\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nthe death sentence was commuted to the sentence of life in\n\nthe same terms.\n\n88. Placing reliance on these decisions, learned counsel for\n\nthe accused/appellant submitted that the present case also,\n\ndoes not come within the purview of rarest of rare cases, and\n\nit is a fit case in which the death sentence passed by the Trial\n\nCourt below be set aside for the offence under\nSection 302\nof\n\nthe Indian Penal Code.\n\n89. It is also submitted that the Trial Court has not given\n\nany finding as to a possible rehabilitation and reformation and\n\nthe possibility that the accused could still be a useful member\n\nof the society, in case, he is given a chance to do so, and in\n\nabsence of such finding, the death sentence awarded by the\n\nTrial Court cannot be sustained in the eyes of law.\n\n90. We cannot loose sight of some landmark Judgements on\n\nthe issue of awarding death sentence, rendered by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court.\nIn the case of\nRajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik Vs.\n\nState of Maharashtra\n, reported in AIR 2019 SC 1, which\n\nrelated to rape and murder of a child aged about three years,\n\nand the appellant was found guilty and convicted for the\n\noffences under\nSections 376(2)(f)\n,\nand\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code, in which, the death sentence was awarded by the\n\nTrial Court for the offence under\nSection 302\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code, which was confirmed by the High Court. Criminal\n\nAppeal filed by the appellant also stood dismissed by the\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nSupreme Court, as reported in (2012) 4 SCC 37. The review\n\npetitions were then filed by the appellant, which also stood\n\ndismissed by the Supreme Court.\n\nThereafter, in a completely\n\ndifferent case, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in\n\nMohd. Arif Vs. Registrar\n, Supreme Court of India, reported\n\nin (2014) 9 SCC 737, considered two basic issues in the cases\n\nwhere death sentence was pronounced by the High Court: (1)\n\nwhether the hearing of such cases should be by a Bench of at\n\nleast three if not five Judges of the Supreme Court and (2)\n\nwhether the hearing of review petitions in death sentence\n\ncases should not be by circulation, but should only be in open\n\nCourt. Though the Supreme Court was not persuaded to\n\naccept the submission that the appeal should be heard by five\n\nJudges of the Court, but it decided that in every appeal\n\npending in the Court in which the death sentence had been\n\nawarded by the High Court, only a Bench of three Judges shall\n\nhear the appeal. As regards the oral hearing of the review\n\npetitions in the open Court, it was held that a limited oral\n\nhearing ought to be given, and it was held that this direction\n\nwould also apply where the review petition is already\n\ndismissed, but the death sentence was not executed. This gave\n\nan opportunity of consideration of the matter of the accused\n\nRajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik again by the Supreme Court. As\n\nregards the said accused, it was found by the Supreme Court\n\nthat the High Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court had\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nnot taken into consideration the probability of reformation,\n\nrehabilitation and social integrity of the appellant into the\n\nsociety. The Court, however, found that the appellant was\n\naccused in other three similar nature of cases. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the backdrop of these facts laid down the\n\nlaw as follows :-\n\n\"75. -------------. It must be appreciated that a sentence of death\nshould be awarded only in the rarest of rare cases, only if an\nalternative option is unquestionably foreclosed and only after full\nconsideration of all factors keeping in mind that a sentence of\ndeath is irrevocable and irretrievable upon execution. It should\nalways be remembered that while the crime is important, the\ncriminal is equally important in so far as the sentencing process\nis concerned. In other words, courts must \"make assurance\ndouble sure\".\" (Emphasis supplied).\n\n91. Even in the backdrop of the fact that the accused was\n\nfound to be accused in three similar nature of cases, and the\n\ncase related to the gruesome rape and murder of a girl child\n\naged about three years, the Hon'ble Apex Court, laying down\n\nthe law that in absence of any consideration about the\n\nprobability of reformation, rehabilitation and social re-\n\nintegration of the appellant into the society, the death\n\nsentence awarded upon the appellant, could not be\n\nmaintained, commuted the death sentence of the accused,\n\nwhich was earlier affirmed up to the Supreme Court, to the life\n\nimprisonment with direction that the accused should not be\n\nreleased from the custody for the rest of his normal life.\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\n92. Again in the case of\nSachin Kumar Singhraha Vs.\n\nState of M.P.\n, reported in 2019 SCC On Line SC 363, a\n\nschool going girl was subjected to rape, and her school bag\n\nand dead body were recovered at the instance of the accused,\n\npursuant to his disclosure statement, it was not found to be a\n\ncase of such category, where the death sentence was\n\nnecessarily to be imposed, and the death sentence imposed\n\nupon the accused was commuted to the sentence of life\n\nimprisonment, with no remission for 25 years. In the facts of\n\nthe case, the Hon'ble Apex Court was not convinced that the\n\nprobability of reform of the accused was low, in absence of any\n\ncriminal antecedent and keeping in mind his overall conduct.\n\n93. Taking cues from the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in\nRajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik\n's case and\nSachin\n\nKumar Singhraha\n's case (supra), we are of the view that the\n\nprinciples laid down therein, would squarely cover the case of\n\nthe appellant in the present case also. The probability of\n\nreformation, rehabilitation and social re-integration of the\n\nappellant, also cannot be ruled out. But at the same time, we\n\njust cannot lose sight of the manner in which the deceased\n\nwas murdered after committing rape upon her.\n\n94. In the facts of this case, we are of the considered view,\n\nthat though the extreme penalty of death was not warranted in\n\nthe facts of this case, but the accused does not deserve any\n\nmajor leniency in the matter of remission of the sentence. As\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nsuch, the impugned order of sentence, awarding the capital\n\npunishment of death to the appellant, Indar Oraon, for the\n\noffence under\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code, is hereby,\n\ncommuted to the life sentence.\n\n95. In our considered view, this alternative option shall\n\nserve the interest of justice. The sentence passed against the\n\nappellant Indar Oraon for the offence under\nSection 6\nof the\n\nPOCSO Act shall also run concurrently. We also hereby, affirm\n\nthe sentence of the appellant Indar Oraon for the offence\n\nunder\nSection 6\nof the POCSO Act.\n\n96. Accordingly, the impugned Judgment of conviction\n\ndated 09.01.2025 and Order of sentence dated 10.01.2025\n\npassed by learned Additional and Sessions Judge-I-cum-\n\nSpecial Judge (POCSO Act), Lohardaga, in Special POCSO\n\nCase No.09/2023, stand affirmed, with the modification in the\n\nsentence of the appellant Indar Oraon, as aforesaid.\n\n97. Before parting with this Judgment, we find that the\n\nparents of the deceased are the victims of crime in this case\n\nand they are required to be duly compensated under the\n\n'Victim Compensation Scheme' under\nSection 357-A\nof the\n\nCr.P.C./Section 396 of the BNSS, 2023.\n\n98. We accordingly, direct the Member Secretary,\n\nJharkhand State Legal Services Authority, Ranchi, to take up\n\nthe matter with the concerned District Legal Services\n2026:JHHC:140-DB\n\nAuthority, so that these victims of crime may be duly\n\ncompensated at an early date.\n\n99. Let a copy of this Judgment be sent to the Member\n\nSecretary, Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority, Ranchi,\n\nfor the needful.\n\n100. The aforesaid Criminal Appeal is accordingly, dismissed\n\nwith the modification of the sentence of the appellant Indar\n\nOraon for the offence under\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode.\n\n101. The Death Reference is also answered, accordingly.\n\n102. Let the Lower Court Records be sent back to the Court\n\nconcerned forthwith, along with a copy of this Judgment.\n\nI agree (Sujit Narayan Prasad, J.)\n\n(Arun Kumar Rai, J.)
