Now, the moot question is whether in view of the\n\ninvolvement of the petitioner in so many cases, can he still\n\nbe released on parole.\n\n7. It is more than settled that the grant of remission\n\nor parole is not a right vested with the prisoner. It is a\n\nprivilege available to the prisoner on fulfilling certain\n\nconditions. This is a discretionary power which has to be\n\nexercised by the authorities conferred with such powers\n\nunder the relevant rules/regulations. The Court cannot\n\nexercise these powers, though once the powers are\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\nexercised, the Court may hold that the exercise of powers is\n\nnot in accordance with rules.\n\n.\n\n8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered in\n\ndetail the nature, object, purpose and parameters for grant\n\nof parole subject to which parole can be granted in\nAsfaq\n\nversus State of Rajasthan and others\n, (2017) 15 SCC\n\n55, wherein it was observed as under:\n\n\"14. Furlough, on the other hand, is a brief release\nfrom the prison. It is conditional and is given in case\n\nof long term imprisonment. The period of sentence\n\nspent on furlough by the prisoners need not be\nundergone by him as is done in the case of parole.\nFurlough is granted as a good conduct remission.\n\n15. A convict, literally speaking, must remain in jail\nfor the period of sentence or for rest of his life in case\n\nhe is a life convict. It is in this context that his release\n\nfrom jail for a short period has to be considered as an\nopportunity afforded to him not only to solve his\n\npersonal and family problems but also to maintain his\nlinks with society. Convicts too must breathe fresh air\nfor at least some time provided they maintain good\nconduct consistently during incarceration and show a\ntendency to reform themselves and become good\ncitizens. Thus, redemption and rehabilitation of such\nprisoners for good of societies must receive due\nweightage while they are undergoing sentence of\nimprisonment.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n16. This Court, through various pronouncements, has\nlaid down the differences between parole and\n\n.\n\nfurlough, few of which are as under:\n\n(i) Both parole and furlough are conditional\nrelease.\n\n(ii) Parole can be granted in case of short term\nimprisonment whereas in furlough it is granted\n\nin case of long term imprisonment.\n\n(iii) Duration of parole extends to one month\nwhereas in the case of furlough it extends to\n\nfourteen days maximum.\n\n(iv) Parole is granted by Divisional\nCommissioner and furlough is granted by the\n\nDeputy Inspector General of Prisons.\n\n(v) For parole, specific reason is required,\n\nwhereas furlough is meant for breaking the\nmonotony of imprisonment.\n\n(vi) The term of imprisonment is not included in\n\nthe computation of the term of parole, whereas\nit is vice versa in furlough.\n\n(vii) Parole can be granted number of times\nwhereas there is limitation in the case of\nfurlough.\n\n(viii) Since furlough is not granted for any\nparticular reason, it can be denied in the\ninterest of the society.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n{See\nState of Maharashtra and Another v. Suresh\nPandurang Darvakar\n(2006) 4 SCC 776; and State of\n\n.\n\nHaryana and Others v. Mohinder Singh\n, (2000) 3\n\nSCC 394.\n\n17. From the aforesaid discussion, it follows that\n\namongst the various grounds on which parole can be\ngranted, the most important ground, which stands\nout, is that a prisoner should be allowed to maintain\n\nfamily and social ties. For this purpose, he has to\ncome out for some time so that he is able to maintain\nhis family and social contact. This reason finds\n\njustification in one of the objectives behind sentence\n\nand punishment, namely, reformation of the convict.\nThe theory of criminology, which is largely accepted,\nunderlines that the main objectives which a State\n\nintends to achieve by punishing the culprit are:\n\ndeterrence, prevention, retribution and reformation.\nWhen we recognise reformation as one of the\n\nobjectives, it provides justification for letting of even\nthe life convicts for short periods, on parole, in order\n\nto afford opportunities to such convicts not only to\nsolve their personal and family problems but also to\n\nmaintain their links with the society. Another\nobjective which this theory underlines is that even\nsuch convicts have right to breathe fresh air, al beit\nfor periods. These gestures on the part of the State,\nalong with other measures, go a long way for\nredemption and rehabilitation of such prisoners. They\nare ultimately aimed for the good of the society and,\ntherefore, are in public interest.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n18. The provisions of parole and furlough, thus,\nprovide for a humanistic approach towards those\n\n.\n\nlodged in jails. Main purpose of such provisions is to\n\nafford to them an opportunity to solve their personal\nand family problems and to enable them to maintain\n\ntheir links with society. Even citizens of this country\nhave a vested interest in preparing offenders for\nsuccessful re-entry into society. Those who leave\nprison without strong networks of support, without\n\nemployment prospects, without a fundamental\nknowledge of the communities to which they will\nreturn, and without resources, stand a significantly\n\nhigher chance of failure. When offenders revert to\n\ncriminal activity upon release, they frequently do so\nbecause they lack hope of merging into society as\naccepted citizens. Furloughs or parole can help\n\nprepare offenders for success.\n\n19. Having noted the aforesaid public purpose in\n\ngranting parole or furlough, ingrained in the\n\nreformation theory of sentencing, other competing\npublic interest has also to be kept in mind while\n\ndeciding as to whether in a particular case parole or\nfurlough is to be granted or not. This public interest\nalso demands that those who are habitual offenders\nand may have the tendency to commit the crime\nagain after their release on parole or have the\ntendency to become threat to the law and order of\nthe society, should not be released on parole. This\naspect takes care of other objectives of sentencing,\nnamely, deterrence and prevention. This side of the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\ncoin is the experience that great number of crimes\nare committed by the offenders who have been put\n\n.\n\nback in the street after conviction. Therefore, while\n\ndeciding as to whether a particular prisoner deserves\nto be released on parole or not, the aforesaid aspects\n\nhave also to be kept in mind. To put it tersely, the\nauthorities are supposed to address the question as\nto whether the convict is such a person who has the\ntendency to commit such a crime or he is showing\n\ntendency to reform himself to become a good citizen.\n\n20. Thus, not all people in prison are appropriate for\n\ngrant of furlough or parole. Obviously, society must\n\nisolate those who show patterns of preying upon\nvictims. Yet administrators ought to encourage those\noffenders who demonstrate a commitment to\n\nreconcile with society and whose behaviour shows\nthat aspire to live as law-abiding citizens. Thus, parole\nprogram should be used as a tool to shape such\n\nadjustments.\n\n21. To sum up, in introducing penal reforms, the State\nthat runs the administration on behalf of the society\n\nand for the benefit of the society at large cannot be\nunmindful of safeguarding the legitimate rights of the\ncitizens in regard to their security in the matters of life\nand liberty. It is for this reason that in introducing such\nreforms, the authorities cannot be oblivious of the\nobligation to the society to render it immune from\nthose who are prone to criminal tendencies and have\nproved their susceptibility to indulge in criminal\nactivities by being found guilty (by a Court) of having\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\nperpetrated a criminal act. One of the discernible\npurposes of imposing the penalty of imprisonment is\n\n.\n\nto render the society immune from the criminal for a\n\nspecified period. It is, therefore, understandable that\nwhile meting out humane treatment to the convicts,\n\ncare has to be taken to ensure that kindness to the\nconvicts does not result in cruelty to the society.\nNaturally enough, the authorities would be anxious to\nensure that the convict who is released on furlough\n\ndoes not seize the opportunity to commit another\ncrime when he is at large for the time-being under the\nfurlough leave granted to him by way of a measure of\n\npenal reform.\n\n22. Another vital aspect that needs to be discussed is\nas to whether there can be any presumption that a\n\nperson who is convicted of serious or heinous crime is\nto be, ipso facto, treated as a hardened criminal.\nHardened criminal would be a person for whom it has\n\nbecome a habit or way of life and such a person would\nnecessarily tend to commit crimes again and again.\n\nObviously, if a person has committed a serious\noffence for which he is convicted, but at the same\n\ntime it is also found that it is the only crime he has\ncommitted, he cannot be categorised as a hardened\ncriminal. In his case consideration should be as to\nwhether he is showing the signs to reform himself and\nbecome a good citizen or there are circumstances\nwhich would indicate that he has a tendency to\ncommit the crime again or that he would be a threat\nto the society. Mere nature of the offence committed\nby him should not be a factor to deny the parole\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\noutrightly. Wherever a person convicted has suffered\nincarceration for a long time, he can be granted\n\n.\n\ntemporary parole, irrespective of the nature of offence\n\nfor which he was sentenced. We may hasten to put a\nrider here, viz. in those cases where a person has\n\nbeen convicted for committing a serious office, the\ncompetent authority, while examining such cases, can\nbe well advised to have stricter standards in mind\nwhile judging their cases on the parameters of god\n\nconduct, habitual offender or while judging whether\nhe could be considered highly dangerous or prejudicial\nto the public peace and tranquillity etc.\n\n23. There can be no cavil in saying that a society that\nbelieves in the worth of the individuals can have the\nquality of its belief judged, at least in part, by the\n\nquality of its prisons and services and recourse made\navailable to the prisoners. Being in a civilized society\norganized with law and a system as such, it is\n\nessential to ensure for every citizen a reasonably\ndignified life. If a person commits any crime, it does\n\nnot mean that by committing a crime, he ceases to be\na human being and that he can be deprived of those\n\naspects of life which constitute human dignity. For a\nprisoner all fundamental rights are an enforceable\nreality, though restricted by the fact of imprisonment.\n{See - Sunil Batra (II) v. State (UT of Delhi) (\n1980) 3\nSCC 488 , Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India\n(\n1978) 1\nSCC 248 and Charles Sobraj v. Superintendent\nCentral Jai, Tihar, New Delhi\n, (1978) 4 SCC 104.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n24. It is also to be kept in mind that by the time an\napplication for parole is moved by a prisoner, he\n\n.\n\nwould have spent some time in the jail. During this\n\nperiod, various reformatory methods must have been\napplied. We can take judicial note of this fact, having\n\nregard to such reformation facilities available in\nmodern jails. One would know by this time as to\nwhether there is a habit of relapsing into crime in\nspite of having administered correctional treatment.\n\nThis habit known as \"recidivism\" reflects the fact that\nthe correctional therapy has not brought in the mind\nof the criminal. It also shows that criminal is hardcore\n\nwho is beyond correctional therapy. If the correctional\n\ntherapy has not made in itself, in a particular case,\nsuch a case can be rejected on the aforesaid ground\ni.e. on its merits.\"\n\n9. Bearing in mind the aforesaid exposition of law, it\n\nis evidently clear that even though the purpose of granting\n\nparole is ingrained in the reformatory theory of sentencing,\n\nhowever, the other competing public interest has also to be\n\nkept in mind while deciding as to whether in a particular\n\ncase parole is to be granted or not. This public interest also\n\ndemands that those who are habitual offenders and may\n\nhave the tendency to commit the crime again after their\n\nrelease on parole or have the tendency to become threat to\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\nthe law and order of the society, should not be released on\n\nparole.\n\n.\n\n10. The grant of parole is not a right vested with the\n\nprisoner and is rather a privilege available to the prisoner\n\non fulfilling certain conditions and in view of the long history\n\nof cases as set out hereinabove, we really do not find any\n\ninfirmity with the order passed by the respondents rejecting\n\nthe claim of the petitioner for grant of parole.\n\n11. Consequently, we find no merit in the instant\n\nwrit petition and the same is accordingly dismissed, leaving\n\nthe parties to bear their own costs.
