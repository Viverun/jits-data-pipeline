Act, PS Bharat Nagar, Delhi.\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 1 of 20\n\n2. Notice of the application was given to the State.\n\n3. Reply to the bail application has already been filed by the State.\nMr.Sidharth Luthra, learned Addl. Solicitor General submits that the\ncomplete call details record could not be annexed with the reply to the\nbail application and the remaining pages, he is placing on record today\nwith copy to learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\n4. Learned Addl.Solicotor General has submitted that in a recent\ndevelopment, Chanshivroop Singh, who is a co-accused in this case and\nwas released on bail by the Court, had moved an application under\n\nSection 306\nCrPC to become Approver to which the investigating agency\nhad given 'No Objection'. His Statement under\nSection 164\nCrPC was\nrecorded on 07.11.2012 and to remove a technical infirmity in the\nprevious statement, his statement was again recorded on 27.11.2012.\nThe application under\nSection 306\nCrPC was to come up for hearing on\n30.11.2012 on which date Chanshivroop Singh was to appear in person\nin the Court. He did not appear in the Court on 30.11.2012 and when the\nmatter was adjourned for 01.12.2012, his father informed that his son\nhad left for Mumbai on the night of 27.11.2012 and thereafter he had\nneither contacted nor returned. On inquiry from his Mumbai contacts, it\nwas revealed that he had left for Abu Dhabi on 28.11.2012 by early\nmorning flight. Mr.Sidharth Luthra, learned Addl. Solicitor General has\nsubmitted that a person who volunteered to become Approver in this\ncase, has left the country and this shows the amount of influence the\naccused person can exercise.\n\n5. Today, Mr.U.U.Lalit, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has\nplaced on record the photocopy of birth certificate of daughter of the\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 2 of 20\n\npetitioner and also the treatment record of her parents. He has also\nplaced on record the statement of Geetika Sharma made before Emirates\nGroup on 11.08.2010 and the statements under\nSection 161\nCrPC of\nDr.Vishakha Munjal and Mr.Batush Pal submitting that statements are\npart of chargesheet.\n\n6. Arguments on the bail application heard.\n\n7. As per the averments made in the bail application, the first\napplication filed before this Court on 21.09.2012 was dismissed as\nwithdrawn with liberty to file a fresh application before the Trial Court\nin accordance with law.\n\n8. The petitioner applied for regular bail before learned ASJ I/C,\nRohini Courts, Delhi but her prayer for release on bail was declined vide\norder dated 15.10.2012 observing that though the petitioner is a woman\nwith aged parents and a female child to look after which go in her favour\nbut in the facts and circumstances of the case, likelihood of tampering\nwith the prosecution evidence and also larger social interest viz-a-viz her\nright to be enlarged on bail.\n\n9. The prayer for bail has been made before this Court on the\nfollowing grounds :-\n\n(i) The petitioner is a woman and in view of the proviso to\nSection\nCrPC, she is entitled to be released on bail in view of the nature of\noffence for which she has been chargesheeted;\n\n(ii) The petitioner has seven years old daughter and aged parents to\nlook after. Her parents are suffering from various old age related\nailments and other diseases requiring presence of the petitioner to take\ncare of them financially and otherwise;\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 3 of 20\n\n(iii) The petitioner had joined the investigation as and when required\nand she was arrested unexpectedly on 08.08.2012 when she appeared to\njoin the investigation at 9.00 am in the morning but unexpectedly\narrested at 9.30 pm on that day;\n\n(iv) The allegations against the petitioner in the FIR and the two\nseparate suicide notes impute certain acts done by her within the realms\nof her job profile;\n\n(v) The allegations against the petitioner even if taken on their face\nvalue, do not constitute the basic ingredients of abetment to commit\nsuicide;\n\n(vi) The deceased Geetika Sharma was her senior and she had called\nthe deceased in connection with official work;\n\n(vii) The allegations made in the two suicide notes are not in\nconformity with the contents of the FIR;\n\n(viii) The incident had taken place at the house of the deceased where\nshe was residing alongwith her family and the petitioner was not even\npresent at the spot so could not have instigated her to commit suicide;\n\n(ix) The two suicide notes written on different dates show suspicious\ncircumstances and even if taken to be dying declaration, do not attract\n\nSection 306\nIPC or conspiracy for abetment;\n\n(x) The act of suicide by the deceased is of her own volition and her\nown independent act without there being any abetment or inducement by\nthe petitioner and the suicide notes do not lead to proximity of any act,\nomission or commission of the petitioner to abet or instigate the deceased\nto take the extreme step; and\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 4 of 20\n\n(xi) There is no possibility of the tampering with the evidence by the\npetitioner.\n\n10. At the outset, Mr.U.U. Lalit, learned Senior counsel for the\npetitioner has submitted that the petitioner is a woman who has already\nspent 110 days in custody. She has to take care of her seven years old\ndaughter as single parent as well her ailing parents. Chargesheet has\nbeen filed in this case and in view of the proviso to\nSection 437\nCrPC,\nher prayer for bail may be considered.\n\n11. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that in the\nstatement made by Geetika Sharma before Emirates Group on\n11.08.2010, she has specifically mentioned that Ex-Company Manager\nhelped her in getting the release order for which she apologised. Thus,\nit was the deceased who owned responsibility for this document and\npetitioner cannot be blamed for the same.\n\n12. Referring to the statement of Dr. Vishakha Munjal, the\nGynaecologist, Mr.U.U.Lalit, learned Senior Counsel has submitted that\nfrom her statement recorded by the IO as well as given by her in her own\nhandwriting on her letter head, it can be gathered that she was known to\npetitioner Aruna Chadha. The role attributed to the petitioner Aruna\nChadha by Dr.Vishakha Munjal is limited to the extent that she\naccompanied the deceased who was unmarried but pregnant. The\nsubsequent visits to the clinic was by the deceased alone and in the given\ncircumstances, at the most the petitioner can be said to have helped the\ndeceased by taking her to a Gynaecologist known to her and this\ncircumstance in any case does not go against her. Referring to the call\ndetails and the statement made by the mother of the deceased at the time\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 5 of 20\n\nof registration of FIR and subsequently under\nSection 164\nCrPC, learned\nSenior Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that in none of the\nstatement, the role of the petitioner has been specifically defined which\ncould have the effect of instigating and abetting her to commit suicide.\nReferring to the two suicide notes, one dated 04.05.2012 and another\ndated 04.08.2012 and co-relating with the statement of the\nGynaecologist, it was contended that after writing first note on\n04.05.2012, the deceased had visited the Gynaecologist on 14.05.2012\nand 19.06.2012 of her own. Referring the call details submitted by the\nprosecution today, it has been submitted by Mr.U.U.Lalit, learned Senior\nCounsel for the petitioner that even as per the call details submitted by\nthe prosecution, the last contact between the petitioner and the deceased\nwas on 26.07.2012 whereas suicide was committed on the night\nintervening 04/05.08.2012. Even as per the statement made by mother of\nthe deceased, at the most it can be said that the petitioner was asking the\ndeceased to come to the office to sign certain documents and then resign,\nwhich in no circumstance can be termed as abetment or instigation to\ncommit suicide.\n\n13. Distinguishing the present case from the other cases under\nSection\nIPC, where a married woman commits suicide on being subjected to\ncruelty, on the basis of presumption to be drawn under\nSection 113-A\nof\nEvidence Act where the Court may presume having regard to all the\ncircumstances of the case that such suicide has been abetted by husband\nor by such relative of the husband, he submitted that it is not such a case\nwhere any such presumption can be drawn to charge the petitioner for\nabetment to commit suicide. The deceased was pursuing MBA for\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 6 of 20\n\nwhich the petitioner helped her. Apart from that, she is a lady entitled to\nthe benefit of proviso of\nSection 437\nCrPC especially when she has a\nyoung daughter aged about seven years and aged parents suffering from\nvarious ailments to look after. It has also been submitted by\nMr.U.U.Lalit, learned Senior Counsel that once Chanshivroop Singh was\narrested and released on bail, it was for the Court to ensure that he does\nnot flee. The petitioner cannot be blamed if due to any lapse on the part\nof Court or investigating agency, he has managed to flee from the\ncountry. At the most, it can be said that the petitioner asked the deceased\nto come to the office to sign some documents and then resign which does\nnot amount to instigation or abetment. Rather deceased was attending\nthe Fashion Show of her brother in Mumbai and for whatever reason she\nmight have committed suicide, the petitioner cannot be blamed for that.\n\n14. While summing up arguments, Mr.U.U.Lalit, learned Senior\nCounsel has submitted that petitioner deserves to be enlarged on bail for\nthe reason that she had been in custody for 110 days and during this\nperiod, she has also been subjected to custodial interrogation,\nchargesheet has already been filed by the prosecution and going by the\nallegations in the chargesheet, no case, even prima facie, for commission\nof the offence under\nSection 306\nIPC can be said to have been committed\nby the petitioner.\n\n15. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has relied upon\nMadan\nMohan Singh vs. State of Gujarat and Another\n(2010) 8 SCC 629\nwherein quashing was allowed in a case under\nSection 306\n/\nIPC in\nthe similar circumstances that employee (Driver) committed suicide\nholding the superior officer responsible for his extreme step.\n\nIn\nMadan\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 7 of 20\n\nMohan Singh\n's case, in the suicide note, the appellant was named to be\nthe person responsible for the suicide by deceased Deepakbhai\nKrishanlal Joshi, who was employed as driver. Reference was made to\npara 13 of the report wherein the Apex Court observed that it was absurd\nto even think that a superior officer like the appellant would intend to\nbring about suicide of his driver and, therefore, abet the offence. In fact,\nthere was no nexus between the so-called suicide (if at all it was one for\nwhich also there was no material on record) and any of the alleged acts\non the part of the appellant and there was no proximity either and the\nproceedings were quashed.\n\n16. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that here\nin the given facts, at least the petitioner is entitled to bail in the given\nfacts and circumstances when there is nothing on record to suggest that\nexcept performing her official part of work and helping the deceased as\ncolleague, she had done any other act for which she can be, prima facie,\nheld liable under\nSection 306\n/\n120-B\nIPC.\n\n17. In reply to the bail application filed by the State, reference has\nbeen made to two suicide notes dated 04.05.2012 and 04.08.2012\nwherein role of the petitioner has been specified to prima facie establish\nactive involvement of the petitioner in abetting the commission of\nsuicide by the deceased. It has been submitted that deceased was\nsubjected to harassment for a specific purpose by the petitioner and her\nco-accused which compelled her to end her life, hence the petitioner is\nequally liable alongwith the co-accused.\n\n18. Mr.Sidharth Luthra, learned Addl. Solicitor General has urged that\nproviso of\nSection 437\nCrPC does not create an absolute right for bail\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 8 of 20\n\nbeing granted to a woman in non-bailable cases dehors the seriousness\nof the offence.\n\n19. On behalf of State, it has been further urged that the petitioner\nplayed an active role and ensured that the deceased return from Dubai to\njoin MDLR Group of Companies and remain under the control of co-\naccused Gopal Goyal. The NOC given to the deceased when she left\nMDLR Group of Companies to join Emirates Airlines bore the signature\nof one Rajiv Kumar Prashar who was not on the pay roll of MDLR\nduring the period 07.11.2009 to 14.06.2010 and the NOC was forged at\nthe behest of the petitioner and her co-accused with malafide intention\nto disown the NOC and blame the deceased for forgery. This was also\nused to pressurise the deceased to return from Dubai. Further\nChanshivroop Singh was sent to Dubai by the petitioner and her co-\naccused authorising him to act on behalf of MDLR Airlines in all matters\nrelated to the deceased Geetika Sharma and the petitioner was in constant\ntouch with Chanshivroop Singh to know the progress to ensure removal\nof deceased from Emirates Airlines and join MDLR. Thus,\ncircumstances were created wherein Geetika Sharma was forced to\nresign from her job in Emirates Airlines in Dubai and return to join\nMDLR Airlines. Chanshivroop Singh was asked to create false E-mail\nID in the name of Sheikh Bhasir Al Bhoram, Director, Emirates Groups\nto send a threatening e-mail to the deceased. Since Chanshivroop Singh\nhesitated and refused for the same, the petitioner threatened him and told\nhim to either do the work or face consequences. The said forged e-mail\ndated 01.10.2010 sent to the deceased had an attached file having the\ncopy of forged order dated 13.09.2010 of Dubai Court purported to be\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 9 of 20\n\nissued from Justice Hassan Abdelaziz Musand. It has been submitted\nthat these acts amount to commission of forgery of the record of the\nCourt and forgery for the purpose of harming the reputation of an\nindividual and are punishable and the intention was to pressurize and\nthreaten Geetika Sharma to force her and to come back into the clutches\nof co-accused Gopal Goyal.\n\n20. On behalf of State, it has been further submitted that it was the\npetitioner who had taken the deceased to a clinic at Lajpat Nagar for\ngetting her abortion done. On 03.08.2012, just a day before this\noccurrence, the petitioner had a talk with mother of the deceased\ninstructing her to send Geetika Sharma to sign the documents and resign\nand at that time, adverse comments were made regarding the character of\nthe deceased which mentally disturbed the deceased and her mother.\nReferring to the call details record, it has been submitted that earlier the\npetitioner had detailed conversation with the deceased.\n\n21. While referring to the statement of parents and brother of the\ndeceased recorded under\nSection 164\nCrPC, it has been submitted that\nthe role of the petitioner is duly reflected in the same. The petitioner was\nnot only an employee of MDLR Airlines but constantly participated in\nthe conspiracy with her co-accused Gopal Goyal to cause harassment to\nthe deceased and acted as facilitator in the illegal acts of her co-accused\nand there is every possibility of the petitioner tampering with the\nevidence and threatening the witness if enlarged on bail at this stage.\nFurther the job profile of the petitioner was such that earlier also her\ndaughter was being looked after by her parents and she has close\nrelations to take care of her family.\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 10 of 20\n\n22. Mr.Sidharth Luthra, learned Addl. Solicitor General has submitted\nthat statement of Rajiv Kumar Prashar has been recorded wherein he has\nspecifically stated that he was not on the pay roll of MDLR from\n07.11.2009 to 14.06.2010 and that NOC on the letter head of MDLR\ndoes not bear his signature.\n\n23. Mr.Sidharth Luthra, learned Addl. Solicitor General has placed\nreliance on\nPraveen Pradhan vs. State of Uttaranchal & Anr.\n(2012) 9\nSCC 734 wherein prayer for quashing was made in a case under\nSection\n/\nIPC. The deceased\nin that case\nwas an Engineer. As per the\nsuicide note left by him, he blamed Praveen Pradhan i.e. the petitioner\nin\nthat case\n, for humiliating, exploiting, demoralising him and hurting his\nself-respect and forcing him to resign. The Apex Court observed that\ninstigation has to be gathered from the circumstances of a particular case\nand no straitjacket formula can be laid down to find out as to whether in\na particular case there has been instigation which forced the person to\ncommit suicide. It was further observed that in a particular case, there\nmay not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may have\ndirect nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has to be\ndrawn from the circumstances and it is to be determined whether\ncircumstances had been such which in fact had created the situation that\na person felt totally frustrated and committed suicide.\n\n24. I have considered the rival contentions. First I deal with the\ncontention of the petitioner that she should be enlarged on bail for the\nreason that she has spent 110 days in custody, being woman her prayer\nfor bail has to be considered in the light of proviso to\nSection 437\nCrPC\nespecially her family circumstances that she has to lookafter her seven\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 11 of 20\n\nyears old daughter as single parent as well her aged ailing parents.\n\n25. Merely because, the petitioner is in incarceration for 110 days, is\nin itself does not entitle her to be enlarged on bail.\nIn the case of\nKalyan\nChandra Sarkar vs. Rajesh Ranjan\n2004 CriLJ 1796, it was held that :\n\n'The mere fact that the accused has undergone certain period of\nincarceration by itself would not entitle the accused to be enlarged\non bail nor the fact that the trial is not likely to be concluded in\nnear future either by itself or coupled with the period of\nincarceration would be sufficient for enlarging the accused on bail\nwhen the gravity of the offence alleged is severe.'\n\n26. So far as release of the petitioner on the ground that she is a\nwoman and is entitled to bail under proviso (1) to\nSection 437\nCrPC, is\nconcerned, it is necessary to mention here that this proviso is not\nmandatory.\nIn the case\nChandrawati vs. State of U.P.\n1992 CriLJ 3634\nit was held that :\n\n'Overriding considerations in granting bail which are common\nboth in\nSection 437(1)\nand\n439(1)\nof Criminal Procedure Code are\nthe nature and gravity of the circumstances in which the offence\nhas been committed, position and status of the accused with\nreference to the victim and the witnesses and likelihood of the\naccused fleeing from justice and tampering with witnesses etc. It\nwas held that the bail is at the most a matter of procedural\nprivilege and not an accrued right until it is granted.\nConsequently, it was held that the accused would not be entitled to\nbail merely being a woman on account of proviso to\nSection 437(4)\n\nof the Criminal Procedure Code. It was further held that the cause\nof public justice also has to be zealously guarded compared to the\nrights of a criminal defendant. Interest of society and also cause of\npublic justice has also to be kept in mind while granting or\nrefusing bail. Consequently, if offence is of such a nature which\naffects the vital interest of the society and has adverse effect on the\nsocial and family life, in such matters the issue is to be considered\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 12 of 20\n\nwith reference to them and one of the consideration which has to\nbe weighed for granting or refusing bail is a nature of the offence\nand its heinousness.'\n\n27. The parameters to be considered for grant of bail in non-bailable\noffences have been dealt with by the Apex Court recently in\nPratapbhai\nHamirbhai Solanki Vs. State of Gujarat and Anr.\n- 2012 (10) SCALE\n\n237. In paras 15 to 19 of the report, it has been observed :\n\n'15. At this juncture, we may refer with profit to certain authorities\nwhich lay down the considerations that should weigh with the\nCourt in granting bail in non-bailable offences. This Court in\nState\nv. Capt\n.\nJagjit Singh MANU/SC/0139/1961 : (1962) 3 SCR 622\nand Gurcharan Singh v. State (Delhi Admn.)\nMANU/SC/0420/1978 : (1978) 1 SCC 118 has held that the nature\nand seriousness of the offence; the character of the evidence;\ncircumstances which are peculiar to the accused; a reasonable\npossibility of the presence of the accused not being secured at the\ntrial; reasonable apprehension of witnesses being tampered with;\nthe larger interest of the public or the State and other similar\nfactors which may be relevant in the facts and circumstances of the\ncase are to be considered.\nThe said principles have been reiterated\nin\nJayendra Saraswathi Swamigal v. State of T.N.\nMANU/SC/0017/2005\n: (2005) 2 SCC 13.\n\n16.\nIn\nPrahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT, Delhi and Anr\n.\n\nMANU/SC/0193/2001 : (2001) 4 SCC 280, this Court has culled\nout the principles to be kept in mind while granting or refusing\nbail. In that context, the two-Judge Bench has stated that while\ngranting the bail, the court has to keep in mind the nature of\naccusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity\nof the punishment which conviction will entail, the character,\nbehaviour, means and standing of the accused, circumstances\nwhich are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of\nsecuring the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable\napprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger\ninterests of the public or State and similar other considerations. It\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 13 of 20\n\nhas also to be kept in mind that for the purposes of granting the\nbail the legislature has used the words \"reasonable grounds for\nbelieving\" instead of \"the evidence\" which means the court dealing\nwith the grant of bail can only satisfy it as to whether there is a\ngenuine case against the accused and that the prosecution will be\nable to produce prima facie evidence in support of the charge. It is\nnot expected, at this stage, to have the evidence establishing the\nguilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n17. In State of U.P. through C.B.I. v. Amarmani Tripathi\nMANU/SC/0677/2005 : (2005) 8 SCC 21, while emphasizing on\nthe relevant factors which are to be taken into consideration, this\nCourt has expressed thus: -\n\nWhile a vague allegation that the accused may tamper with the\nevidence or witnesses may not be a ground to refuse bail, if the\naccused is of such character that his mere presence at large would\nintimidate the witnesses or if there is material to show that he will\nuse his liberty to subvert justice or tamper with the evidence, then\nbail will be refused.\n\nIn the said case, the Bench has also observed as follows: -\n\nTherefore, the general rule that this Court will not ordinarily\ninterfere in matters relating to bail, is subject to exceptions where\nthere are special circumstances and when the basic requirements\nfor grant of bail are completely ignored by the High Court.\n\n18. Recently, in\nAsh Mohammad v. Shiv Raj Singh @ Lalla Babu\nand Anr. JT\n2012 (9) SC 155, this Court while dealing with\nindividual liberty and cry of the society for justice has opined as\nunder: -\n\nIt is also to be kept in mind that individual liberty cannot be\naccentuated to such an extent or elevated to such a high pedestal\nwhich would bring in anarchy or disorder in the society. The\nprospect of greater justice requires that law and order should\nprevail in a civilized milieu. True it is, there can be no arithmetical\nformula for fixing the parameters in precise exactitude but the\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 14 of 20\n\nadjudication should express not only application of mind but also\nexercise of jurisdiction on accepted and established norms. Law\nand order in a society protect the established precepts and see to it\nthat contagious crimes do not become epidemic. In an organized\nsociety the concept of liberty basically requires citizens to be\nresponsible and not to disturb the tranquility and safety which\nevery well-meaning person desires.\n\n19. We are absolutely conscious that liberty is a greatly cherished\nvalue in the life of an individual, and no one would like to barter it\nfor all the tea in China, but it is obligatory on the part of court to\nscan and scrutinize, though briefly, as regards the prima facie\ncase, the seriousness and gravity of the crime and the potentiality\nof the accused to tamper with the evidence apart from other\naspects before the restriction on liberty is lifted on imposition of\ncertain conditions.'\n\n28. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has referred to the\nstatement of the mother of the deceased that on being satisfied about the\nfamily environment at the work place that Geetika - the deceased\nresumed duties. Here suffice it to say that the family members of the\ndeceased could make statement only to the extent what they were seeing\nand what happened in their presence. What kind of physical\nexploitation, the deceased was subjected to, can be made out from the\npostmortem report. The factum of her being pregnant and taken to a\nGynaecologist is appearing in the statement of Dr. Vishakha Munjal. It\nis stated by Dr.Vishakha Munjal that when deceasedGeetika was brought\nto her by Aruna Chadha, she was informed that the deceased Geetika was\nunmarried but pregnant and that it was not possible to get the MTP done\nas indoor patient. Thus, medicines were prescribed which could induce\nabortion. The contention of the petitioner that she had taken the\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 15 of 20\n\ndeceased to the Gynaecologist to help her being her fellow colleague, on\nthe face of it appears to be innocuous but in the light of her role in the\ntwo suicide notes wherein she has been put at par with her co-accused\nGopal Goyal to be the person responsible for creating the circumstances\nwherein the deceased thought of taking the extreme step even on\n04.05.2012 by writing a note to the effect that now this time Aruna is\nalso helping him (Gopal Goyal) to hurt her, harass her, sabotage her\nfamily. She used to act as her well wisher but eventually she had shown\nher true colours and that for the sake of her job, she can stoop down to\nany level and that her trust in them was costing her life, indicate that it is\nnot a case where the petitioner was only helping the fellow colleague.\n\n29. The first suicide note is dated 04.05.2012. She has visited the\nGynaecologist in March, 2012 alongwith the petitioner with the history\nof early pregnancy and wanted to go for abortion. While giving the\nhistory and the duration of pregnancy, the doctor was informed that she\nhad got the pregnancy test done of her own and duration was about 5-6\nweeks. On being asked, she disclosed her marital status as unmarried.\n\n30. After being internally examined and advised admission for\npurpose of medical termination of pregnancy, she expressed her inability\nto get MTP done as indoor patient and opted for pills which was advised\nand she was called for review after two weeks. She preferred not to\ncome after two weeks but visited the Gynaecologist on 14.05.2012 with\nsome complaint of pain in lower abdomen and burning in urine for which\nshe was treated.\n\n31. This statement of the Gynaecologist indicates the state of mind\nthrough which the deceased was passing at the time when she had gone\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 16 of 20\n\nfor abortion induced by pills and was passing through tough phase due to\nthat. May be that, she left the idea of committing suicide after getting rid\nof unwanted pregnancy and was in the process of normalising when she\nstarted getting calls again, sometimes on her phone and sometimes on the\nphone of her brother and mother.\n\n32. At this stage, the statement made by the petitioner before Emirates\nAirlines on 11.08.2010 cannot be said to be of any benefit to the\npetitioner for the reasons that (i) if the NOC was the creation of the\ndeceased, the petitioner or her co-accused on detecting the forgery could\nhave lodged FIR against her and complain to Emirates Airlines, (ii)\nchasing her in Dubai by making personal visits by the petitioner and her\nco-accused making her resign from there, give rise to the inference that\nthey were well aware of this fake NOC and wanted to use it as a tool to\ncreate a situation where deceased had no option but to resign from\nEmirates Airlines, (iii) normally no prudent person would re-employ and\nassign a senior position to an ex-employee who had committed forgery to\nthe extent that NOC from the company was forged. Not only she was re-\nemployed, even admission in MBA course by the deceased was also\nsponsored by MDLR Company.\n\n33. These circumstances suggest that fake NOC was not an issue for\nthe petitioner or his co-accused or the MDLR Company, rather on the\nstrength of that NOC, they managed to get the deceased back in the\ncompany.\n\n34. At this stage for purpose of bail application, her visit to Dubai in\nconnection with joining of Emirates Airlines by deceased and efforts to\nbring her back on one pretext or other, do suggest that she was alleged to\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 17 of 20\n\nbe instrumental in her leaving Emirates Airlines to rejoin MDLR\nCompany run by co-accused of the petitioner.\n\n35. The suicide note dated 04.08.2012 allegedly written by Geetika\nSharma before taking the extreme step, blames two people for her death\nnaming them as Aruna Chadha and Gopal Goyal for ruining her life. At\nthe stage of dealing with the bail application, this court is not supposed\nto give a prima facie finding as to whether a case for abetment to commit\nsuicide is made out against the petitioner. This is the job of Trial Court\nto hear on the point of charge and prima facie form an opinion whether it\nis a case of charge or discharge. Whatever allegations are made against\nthe petitioner and her co-accused in the two suicide notes dated\n04.05.2012 and 04.08.2012 left by deceased Geetika Sharma about the\nharassment being meted out to her by them. The statement of brother of\nthe deceased is that initially Geetika was harassed by not giving NOC on\none pretext or other and subsequently when she joined Emirates after\ngetting the NOC, she was chased even in Dubai and the petitioner has\nalso gone to Dubai to meet Geetika to force her to rejoin MDLR, even\nmails were sent to Emirates Airlines that Geetika had joined that Airlines\nafter playing fraud and on the basis of fake NOC, thus creating a\nsituation wherein she was compelled to come back and subsequently\npetitioner joined MDLR. Even the legal advisor of MDLR Company\ncalled him (brother of the deceased) to talk to Geetika and on getting the\nmessage, she talked to Ankit Ahluwalia from Mumbai Airport and that\nGeetika was so tense that she missed her flight on 03.08.2012 and\nreturned to Delhi by morning flight on 04.08.2012. He had talked to\nGeetika 3-4 times on that day to enquire as to why she was disturbed and\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 18 of 20\n\nlastly he talked to her on the night intervening 04/05.08.2012 at about\n1.15 am and at that time he was informed by Geetika that she has been\nunder lot of mental tension because of Gopal Goyal and Aruna Chadha\nwho were harassing her too much and then she said that she would talk\nin the morning. It is a matter of record that on that very night Geetika\ncommitted suicide. Thus, lastly she had a talk with her brother wherein\nshe named the petitioner and her co-accused to be the persons who were\nharassing her.\n\n36. In the statement of mother of the deceased recorded under\nSection\nCrPC, she referred to a call by Aruna Chadha about 15-20 days prior\nto the occurrence when deceased had some arguments with the petitioner\nwho was insisting Geetika to sign some papers and thereafter resign from\nservice. At this, her daughter got annoyed and asked the petitioner not to\nmake further call to her. The statement of mother of the petitioner is also\nto the effect that in the night of 03.08.2012, she received a call from\nAruna Chadha - the petitioner that Geetika had to sign some papers and\nresign after four days. The petitioner also told her that the allegations\nmade earlier in respect of character of Geetika by Gopal Goyal were true.\nThen, mother of the deceased said to the petitioner that she could never\nthink that the petitioner would stoop so low to save her job.\n\n37. A bare reading of the contents of two suicide notes and the\nstatement made by brother and mother of the deceased if read as a whole,\nat this stage, it cannot be said that the petitioner had no role in\ncommission of suicide by Geetika. It is not necessary in such type of\ncases to have direct evidence or presence at the spot immediately before\nor at the time of commission of suicide to form an opinion whether the\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 19 of 20\n\nallegations against the petitioner amount to instigation or abetment which\nforced Geetika to take the extreme step. The relationship between the\ndeceased and the co-accused cannot be said to be limited to that of an\nemployer and employee relationship as can be gathered from the medical\nrecord and the statement of the doctor.\n\n38. Taking into consideration the parameters to be kept in mind while\nconsidering an application at the time of grant of bail, I find that the\nnature of allegations against the petitioner are serious as a young life has\nbeen lost on inability to bear the harassment at the hands of petitioner\nand her co-accused. The petitioner may be an employee of MDLR but\nfrom the record, it can be gathered that she ensured that the deceased\nremain in MDLR Company.\n\n39. Having considered the submissions made and the material on\nrecord, I feel that it is not a case of extending the benefit of bail to the\npetitioner. Application is dismissed.\n\n40. Any observations made hereinabove for the purpose of dealing\nwith the contentions of the parties shall not prejudice to the case of either\nparty at any stage of the trial.\n\nPRATIBHA RANI, J\nDECEMBER 03, 2012\n'st'\n\nBail Appln.1705/2012 Page 20 of 20",
