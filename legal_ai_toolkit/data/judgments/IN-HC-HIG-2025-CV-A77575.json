JUSTICE JYOTI SINGH\nJUDGEMENT\n\nJYOTI SINGH, J.\n\n1. ARB.P. 1294/2023 is filed by the Petitioner under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ('1996 Act') for appointment of a\nSole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes and differences between the parties\narising out of Settlement Agreement dated 31.12.2021. O.M.P.(I) (COMM.)\n152/2023 is filed by the Petitioner under\nSection 9\nof 1996 Act seeking\nmultiple interim reliefs.\n\nARB.P. 1294/2023 and I.A. 16788/2025\n\n2. Case of the Petitioner as set out in the petition is that Petitioner is a\ncompany incorporated and registered under\nCompanies Act, 1956\n. It is the\nlawful owner of piece and parcel of land bearing Rectangle No.56, Killa\nNo.24/2(3-1), 25/1(3-15); Rectangle No.212, Killa No.2/2(0-10); Rectangle\nNo.65, Killa No.4/2(3-5), 5/1(3-5), admeasuring 13 Kanals 16 Marlas (1.725\nacres) situated in revenue estate of Ajronda, Sector-12, Tehsil and District\nFaridabad, Haryana. Petitioner and Respondent No.1/M/s Pebble Downtown\nIndia (P.) Ltd. entered into a Collaboration Agreement dated 25.06.2015,\nwhereby Respondent No.1 was to inter alia develop and construct a\ncommercial colony on the project land. Disputes having arisen between the\nparties out of the Collaboration Agreement, Sole Arbitrator was appointed,\nhowever, after he entered upon reference, parties resolved their disputes and\nexecuted a Settlement Agreement on 31.12.2021 incorporating terms of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 2 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nsettlement. On joint application filed by Petitioner and Respondent No.1, in\naccordance with Clause 69 of Collaboration Agreement, the Arbitrator\npassed a Consent Award on 08.04.2022, apportioning and identifying\nPetitioner's share as the owner and Respondent No.1's share as Developer in\nthe commercial project as follows:-\n\n3. It is averred in the petition that parties agreed that after expiry of six\nmonths from the date of receipt of Occupation Certificate i.e. 14.03.2022,\nRespondent No.1 will have no right to lease out Petitioner's share in the\nproject and hence post 14.09.2022, Petitioner executed Sale Deeds dated\n29.03.2023 and 31.03.2023 with M/s Shree Sai Sales Corporation in respect\nof 3 units out of 24 units falling to Petitioner's share. With an illegal design\nand oblique motive to frustrate the sale by the Petitioner, Respondent No.1\nexecuted two ante-dated Lease Deeds on 06.04.2022 and leased out all 16\nunits and got them registered on 10.04.2023. The ante-dating is evident from\nthe fact that while the date of execution of the Lease Deeds is shown as\n06.04.2022, the date of purchase of the stamp papers is 12.04.2023.\n\n4. It is further stated that at the time of settlement and passing of the\nConsent Award, Respondent No.1 had represented that the total carpet area\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 3 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\non the 4th and 5th floors in the demised premises was 1398.271 sq. mts.,\nhowever, on actual measurement it was found to be 2195 sq. mts. and\ntherefore, Petitioner is entitled to allocation of 36.25% share in the excess\narea on these floors, which Respondent No.1 refused to give. In order to\npreserve its share in the demised premises, Petitioner filed a petition in this\nCourt under\nSection 9\nof 1996 Act, being O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 152/2023,\nseeking restraint orders against Respondent No.1 as also appointment of\nLocal Commissioner to re-measure the actual carpet area of the two floors.\n\n5. To complete the chronology of facts it is relevant to mention at this\nstage that when the\nSection 9\npetition was listed on 22.05.2023, Court\nobserved that prima facie Petitioner was able to show circumstances which\ncast a doubt on the execution of Lease Deeds dated 06.04.2022 and thus to\nmaintain a balance, directed that Respondents No.3 and 4 will remain bound\nby their statement that any fitment activity carried out in the subject shops\nwill be at their own peril and they will not claim special equity/right or title.\nA direction was also issued that these Respondents shall not begin\ncommercial operations from the shops in question without prior permission\nof the Court. Respondent No.1 was restrained from dealing with Petitioner's\nshare in the subject mall. With respect to the second issue of Petitioner's\nentitlement to share in the excess area on 4th and 5th floors, it was directed\nthat this consideration will have to await replies from the Respondents. This\norder was challenged before the Supreme Court in SLP (C) No.14880/2023,\nwhich was dismissed. Petitioner sent notice invoking arbitration dated\n18.08.2023 to Respondent No.1 under\nSection 21\nof 1996 Act proposing the\nname of a former Judge of the Supreme Court as an Arbitrator, however,\nRespondent No.1 did not agree for arbitration. In this backdrop, ARB.P.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 4 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\n1294/2023 was filed by the Petitioner seeking appointment of a Sole\nArbitrator, invoking clause 37 in the Settlement Agreement and clause QQ\nin the Consent Award, the arbitration clauses.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that Petitioner and\nRespondent No.1 entered into a Collaboration Agreement to develop and\nconstruct a commercial mall, whereunder Petitioner and Respondent No.1\nwere entitled to 36.25% and 63.75% shares respectively, in the built-up area.\nDisputes between the parties led to appointment of an Arbitrator, however,\nthe disputes were amicably resolved and Settlement Agreement was\nexecuted, culminating into a Consent Award dated 08.04.2022. Under\nClause 26 of the Collaboration Agreement, Respondent No.1's exclusive\nright to lease Petitioner's units expired on 14.09.2022 i.e on expiry of 6\nmonths from the date of receipt of Occupation Certificate and Petitioner\nlawfully sold 3 units via Sale Deeds dated 29.03.2023 and 31.03.2023.\nRespondent No.1 obstructed the sale by executing ante-dated Lease Deeds\non 06.04.2022, leasing out 16 units with an oblique motive to frustrate the\nsale by the Petitioner and thus this issue needs to be adjudicated through\narbitration.\n\n7. It was further contended that the total carpet area on the 4th and 5th\nfloors of the mall has also come under dispute due to misrepresentation of\nby Respondent No.1 at that stage, inasmuch as after obtaining the Auto\nCAD of 4th and 5th prepared by architect of Respondent No.1, when the\narchitect of the Petitioner measured the total carpet area, it was revealed that\nthe area was 2195 sq. mts. and not 1398.271 sq. mts. and owing to this,\nPetitioner was given lesser area of 506.873 sq. mts. i.e., 36.25% on lower\nground floor in exchange of its share at the 4th and 5th floor. Petitioner has\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 5 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nthus become entitled to further area in the 800 sq. mts. (approx.) excess area,\nin the agreed proportion. Respondent No.1, however, refuses to honour the\nsettlement and thus this legitimate claim of the Petitioner be referred to\narbitration in terms of Clause 37 of the Settlement Agreement and Clause\nQQ of the Consent Award.\n\n8. To make good the plea that even after settlement and Consent Award,\nPetitioner can seek reference to arbitration, it was argued that at the time of\nexecuting the Settlement Agreement, parties had clearly envisaged that\nfurther disputes may arise and for this reason Clause 37 was incorporated in\nthe Settlement Agreement, which is an arbitration agreement. Additionally,\nConsent Award also contains arbitration Clause QQ for adjudication of\ndisputes arising out of or in connection with the Settlement Agreement\nand/or the Collaboration Agreement. Moreover, sub-Clause (x) of Clause N\nof the Consent Award provides that in case deviation in the carpet area\nbetween the last sanctioned plan of the commercial project and proposed\noccupation plan of commercial project is less than 20-30 sq. mts., then there\nwill be no change in owner's or developer's allocation, however, in case the\nsaid carpet area increased beyond 20-30 sq. mts., then the same will be\nshared proportionately by the parties as per their allocation, adjacent to their\nallocated areas. Since a deviation has been found beyond 20-30 sq. mts. and\nRespondent No.1 has declined to share the area proportionately, dispute has\narisen between the parties on this aspect.\n\n9. It was contended that the objection raised by the Respondents that no\nreference can be made as the claims are barred by res judicata in light of the\nConsent Award and/or are non-arbitrable, cannot be sustained. It is a settled\nlaw that jurisdiction of a referral Court under\nSection 11\nof 1996 Act is\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 6 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nconfined to determination of existence of a valid arbitration agreement and\nwhether the petition itself is barred by limitation and all other issues\npertaining to merits of the case; tenability of the claims; issue of res\njudicata; arbitrability etc., are in the domain of the Arbitral Tribunal.\nIn\nsupport of this plea reliance was placed on the judgments of the Supreme\nCourt in SBI General Insurance Company Limited v. Krish Spinning,\n2024 SCC OnLine SC 1754;\nIndian Oil Corporation Limited v. SPS\nEngineering Limited\n, (2011) 3 SCC 507; and of this Court in\nHindustan\nConstruction Company Ltd. v. Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd.\n,\n2025 SCC OnLine Del 3661.\n\n10. On the objection raised by Respondents No.2, 3 and 4 that they cannot\nbe referred for arbitration being non-signatories to the arbitration agreement\nin the Collaboration Agreement and to the Settlement etc., the submission\nwas that these Respondents are beneficiaries of the commercial transactions\nwith Respondent No.1. Respondents No.3 and 4 are shell companies of\nRespondent No.1, in favour of whom Respondent No.1 executed ante-dated\nLease Deeds, leasing all remaining 16 units falling to Petitioner's share after\nPetitioner sold 3 units from its allocated share, which fact was recognized by\nthe Court when interim order was passed staying their commercial\noperations. Respondent No.2 is in possession of entire 4th and 5th floors,\nwhich includes the area of dispute i.e., 800 sq. mts., approximately.\nIn any\nevent, it is for the Arbitrator to decide whether non-signatories to an\narbitration agreement are necessary parties to arbitration, in light of the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in\nCox and Kings Limited v. SAP India\nPrivate Limited and Another\n, (2024) 4 SCC 1.\n\n11. Arguing on behalf of Respondent No.1, Mr. Akhil Sibal, learned\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 7 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nSenior Counsel opposed the appointment of Arbitrator on ground of non-\narbitrability of disputes invoking the doctrine of res judicata and urging that\nafter full and final settlement of disputes and passing of the Consent Award,\nthere can be no fresh reference. It was emphasized that the Consent Award\ndated 08.04.2022 has the force of a final decree under\nSection 36\nof 1996\nAct and cannot be construed as a new contract with an arbitration\nagreement. Assuming that the Petitioner has any grievance with the Award,\nthe only remedy is to challenge the Award under\nSection 34\nof 1996 Act,\nalbeit that remedy is now time barred.\n\n12. It was further submitted that in terms of the Settlement Agreement\nand Consent Award, Respondent No.1 has fully constructed, built and\ndeveloped the Pebble Mall and has handed over peaceful physical\npossession of identified and apportioned carpet areas falling to the share of\nthe Petitioner in June, 2022, which was accepted by the Petitioner, without\nany protest and demur and parties have been enjoying their respective\nallocations under the agreement and the award till April, 2023, when\nPetitioner raised a frivolous dispute of excess area. Respondent No.1 has\nalready leased 48 out of 57 units apportioned to it and Petitioner is a\nconfirming party to the lease between Respondent No.1 and Respondent\nNo.2. In fact Petitioner has also leased 25 out of 26 units apportioned to it\nand illegally sold 3 units to M/s Shree Sai Sales Corporation and is enjoying\nthe rentals. Petitioner has no right to re-open a binding and concluded\nsettlement acted upon by the parties and whereunder third party rights have\nbeen created and importantly, Respondent No.1 has altered its financial\nposition.\n\n13. Allegations of fraud and/or misrepresentation with regard to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 8 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\ncarpet area of 4th and 5th floors were strenuously denied and it was urged that\nthe area was apportioned based on joint measurements by both the parties, as\nrecorded in the settlement agreement and Petitioner accepted possession of\nits share, without any protest. Contents of paragraphs L, M, N, T, KK and\nLL of the Award show that shares of Petitioner and Respondent No.1 were\nspecifically identified and apportioned in the Pebble Mall and parties agreed\nthat neither of them will make any further claims or demands with respect to\nsuch apportionment and/or shares. It is trite that when a Court/Tribunal puts\nits seal of approval on a Settlement Agreement/ compromise, it ceases to be\na contract and gets the status of decree of a Court, which continues to bind\nthe parties thereto, unless set aside by a Competent Court. If the plea of the\nPetitioner is accepted, no settlement will be final and it will be open to a\nparty to re-agitate the disputes thus making a mockery of the settlement.\nIn\nthis regard, reliance was placed on the judgments in\nBhima Rama Jadhav v.\nAbdul Rashid\n, 1960 SCC OnLine Kar 21;\nRani Pravabati Roy & Others v.\nSaileshnath Roy and Others\n, 1977 SCC OnLine Cal 8;\nSarabjit Singh\nChadha v. Dinesh Sehgal\n, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 3996; and\nShankar\nSitaram Sontakke and Another v. Balkrishna Sitaram Sontakke and\nOthers\n, (1995) 1 SCR 99.\n\n14. Existence of a valid arbitration agreement was also questioned by\nRespondent No.1 on the ground that clauses 37 and QQ do not satisfy the\ningredients of\nSection 7(1)\nof 1996 Act, which provides that an 'arbitration\nagreement' means an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or\ncertain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in\nrespect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not. Neither\nthe arbitral award nor the Settlement Agreement constitutes 'a defined legal\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 9 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nrelationship' and sans existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the\nPetitioner and Respondent No.1, which is a sine qua non for reference under\n\nSection 11\nof 1996 Act, no reference can be made to arbitration. The law\n\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in Krish Spinning (supra), ought not to be\ninterpreted to mean that referral Court's functions are merely administrative\nand ministerial and it is not required to apply its mind and test the existence\nand validity of the arbitration agreement invoked by a party.\nNotably, even\nafter the judgment of the Supreme Court in Krish Spinning (supra), Courts\nhave declined appointment of the Arbitrators, where manifestly the disputes\nare non-arbitrable and in this context, reliance was placed on the judgments\nof the Supreme Court in\nDushyant Janbandhu v. Hyundai Autoever India\nPvt. Ltd.\n, (2024) SCC OnLine SC 3691; HPCL Bio-Fuels v. Shahaji\nBhanudas Bhad, (2024) SCC OnLine SC 3190 and of this Court in ARSS\nInfrastructure Projects Ltd. v. National Highway and Infrastructure\nDevelopment Corporation Ltd., (2025) SCC OnLine Del 1482; and\n\nJaiprakash Associates Limited v. Nhpc Limited\n, (2025) SCC OnLine Del\n\n170. Significantly, in all these cases, existence of arbitration agreement was\nnot disputed yet the prayer for appointment of Arbitrators was declined.\n\n15. Mr. Sibal attempted to distinguish the judgment of the Supreme Court\nin\nSPS Engineering\n(supra) on the ground that in the said case, there was\nno dispute that a valid arbitration clause existed between the parties\nfulfilling all ingredients of\nSection 7\nof 1996 Act. Moreover, it was held that\ndecision on res judicata requires consideration of pleadings, claims, issues\nin the previous round of arbitration in juxtaposition with pleadings, claims\nand issues in the second round of arbitration and therefore, this\ndetermination must be left to the Arbitral Tribunal. In the present case, all\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 10 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nissues pertaining to measurement of the areas is question, their identification\nand apportionment stand settled and crystallized in the Consent Award and\nno further consideration on facts or documents is required. All disputes qua\nthe carpet area of the 4th and 5th floors as also the execution of Lease Deeds\nin the identified and apportioned areas between the parties were settled and a\nquietus was put and thus this is an open and shut case of a reference being\nbarred by res judicata and the disputes being non-arbitrable.\n\n16. Learned counsel for Respondent No.2/PVR Limited submitted that no\nreference can be made to arbitration qua the said Respondent, who is a bona\nfide third-party lessee with no privity of contract with the Petitioner.\nRespondent No.2 is neither a signatory to the Collaboration Agreement nor\nthe Settlement Agreement and the Consent Award has nothing to do with the\nsaid Respondent. Answering Respondent's legal relationship was only with\nRespondent No.1, strictly governed by clauses of Lease Deed dated\n07.10.2022 executed between them with its own distinct arbitration clause\n18, envisaging reference of disputes between Respondent No.1 and\nRespondent No.2 to arbitration. Furthermore, Petitioner in essence seeks\nrelief of cancellation of Respondent No.2's Lease Deed which falls within\nexclusive jurisdiction of a Civil Court as per\nSection 31\nof the Specific\nRelief Act, 1963 and hence the dispute, if any, is non-arbitrable. For this\nproposition, reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in\n\nVidya Drolia and Others v. Durga Trading Corporation\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1.\nAll other arguments addressed by Respondent No.1 were adopted by\nRespondent No.2.\n\n17. Arguing on behalf of Respondents No.3 and 4, Mr. Rajshekar Rao,\nlearned Senior Counsel while adopting the arguments of the other\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 11 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nRespondents urged that there is no privity of contract between the said\nRespondents and the Petitioner. This petition stems out of Clause 37 of\nSettlement Agreement and Clause QQ of Consent Award and Respondents\nNo.3 and 4 are privy to none and have been erroneously impleaded on the\nground that they have acquired rights from Respondent No.1. In essence, the\nallegation concerning Respondent Nos.3 and 4 is that the Lease Deeds\nexecuted by Respondent No.1 in their favour were ante-dated, which is\nfactually incorrect. This petition is only a guise to re-agitate disputes which\nstand settled and the terms of settlement are now a part of a Consent Award.\nThe Consent Award is legally binding as a decree of a Court and cannot be\nindirectly challenged by seeking fresh arbitration. Alternatively, even\nassuming there is a valid arbitration agreement between Petitioner and\nRespondent No.1, the same cannot be invoked and/or enforced against\nRespondents No.3 and 4.\n\n18. It was also submitted that Petitioner is wrongly involving\nRespondents No.3 and 4 in a demarcation dispute, with which they have no\nconcern. The lease deeds are independent and distinct transactions, wholly\nunrelated with the demarcation dispute or any other dispute arising from\nCollaboration Agreement, Settlement Agreement and Consent Award.\nRespondent No.1 entered into a Term Sheet dated 09.03.2022 with\nRespondent No.3 on behalf of the Petitioner and acting in accordance with\nthe same, a valid Lease Deed was executed on 06.04.2022, which was\nregistered on 10.04.2023 and all these transactions were signed well within\nsix months from the date of Occupation Certificate issued on 14.03.2022.\nThe same position obtains in respect of Term Sheet dated 09.03.2022 with\nRespondent No.4. Petitioner has sold 3 shops to a third party and has no\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 12 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nlocus standi to seek relief of appointment of Arbitrator qua the said shops. It\nis only the vendee, who can contest the rights of Respondent No.3 and as a\nmatter of record, vendee has already filed a suit being CS(COMM.) 12/2025\nbefore the District Court, Faridabad, which is pending adjudication. At the\nhighest, assuming that Petitioner has any rights qua the lease properties, the\nremedy lies before Civil Courts and not in invoking arbitral mechanism.\n\n19. Heard learned Senior Counsels and other counsels appearing for the\nrespective parties and examined their submissions.\n\n20. By petition under\nSection 11\nof 1996 Act, Petitioner seeks\nappointment of a Sole Arbitrator and reference of disputes for adjudication.\nRespondent No.1 has taken two-fold objections to appointment of the\nArbitrator viz: (a) non-existence of valid arbitration agreement between the\nparties; and (b) full and final settlement entered into between Petitioner and\nRespondent No.1 culminating into a Consent Award. Respondents No.2 to 4\nquestion the reference to arbitration on an additional ground that they are\nnon-signatories to the original Collaboration Agreement, Settlement\nAgreement and Consent Award and cannot be referred to arbitration.\n\n21. Before proceeding to examine the objections raised by the\nRespondents, it is imperative to look into the scope and ambit of the\njurisdiction of this Court as a referral Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof 1996\nAct. It is trite that under\nSection 11(6)\nof 1996 Act, Court is only required to\nexamine the existence of a valid arbitration agreement on the basis of\n\nSection 7\nof 1996 Act and whether the petition is barred by period of\nlimitation prescribed under\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act, 1963\ni.e., 3\nyears from the date when the right to apply accrues in favour of the\nPetitioner and right to apply has been held to commence from the date when\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 13 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\na valid notice invoking arbitration has been sent by the Petitioner to the\nother party and there is a failure or refusal on part of that other party in\ncomplying with the requirements of the notice. In Interplay Between\nArbitration Agreements under\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nand\n\nStamp Act, 1899\n, in Re, (2024) 6 SCC 1, seven-Judge Bench of the\nSupreme Court referred to several earlier judgments on the scope of judicial\ninterference at the reference stage and noted the paradigm shift in law due to\nlegislative amendment by the\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment\nAct\n), 2015 ('2015 Amendments'), whereby\nSection 11\n(6-A) was inserted.\nThe Supreme Court observed that the decision in SBP & Co. v. Patel\nEngineering Ltd. and Another, (\n2005) 8 SCC 618 and National Insurance\nCompany Limited v. Boghara Polyfab Private Limited\n, (2009) 1 SCC 267,\nallowed for greater judicial interference at pre-arbitral stage and referral\nCourts were encouraged to conduct mini trials instead of summarily dealing\nwith the preliminary issues. The Law Commission recognising that one of\nthe problems plaguing implementation of the 1996 Act was pendency of\n\nSection 11\napplications for years, decided to remedy the situation and\nproposed the 2015 Amendment Act to reduce the judicial intervention at\npre-arbitral stage. The Statement of Objects and Reasons as noted in the\njudgment states that sub-Section (6-A) was inserted in\nSection 11\nto provide\nthat referral Court shall confine to the examination of an arbitration\nagreement.\n\nThe Supreme Court then referred to the judgment in\nDuro\nFelguera, S.A. v.

Pradyuat Deb Burman\n,\n(2019) 8 SCC 714, passed by three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court\naffirming the reasoning in\nDuro Felguera\n(supra) and observing that the\nexamination under\nSection 11\n(6-A) was confined to examination of\nexistence of an arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow\nsense as also that position of law prior to 2015 Amendment Act, as set forth\nby decisions of the Supreme Court in Patel Engineering (supra) and\n\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra), has been legislatively overruled.\n\n22. After referring to several judgments on the issue as also legislative\nintent behind incorporating\nSection 11\n(6-A), the Supreme Court in In Re:\n\nInterplay (supra) held that\nSection 11\nconfines Court's jurisdiction to\nexamination of existence of an arbitration agreement and the use of the term\n'examination' in itself connotes that the scope of power is limited to a prima\nfacie determination. It was further held that since the 1996 Act is a self-\ncontained code, the requirement of 'existence' of an arbitration agreement\ndraws effect from\nSection 7\nof 1996 Act.\nIn this context, once again\nreference was made to the judgment in\nDuro Felguera\n(supra), wherein the\nSupreme Court held that the referral Court would only consider whether the\nunderlying contract contains an arbitration agreement which provides for\narbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the parties\nto the agreement.

The extent of judicial interference at the referral stage was\nscrutinised by a Bench of two Judges of this Court in\nNational Insurance\nCo. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd. [National Insurance Co.\nLtd.\nv. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ)\n117] This Court held that when the intervention of the Court is sought\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act, the following categories of issues\nwill arise before the Referral Court:\n\n152.1. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate is bound to\ndecide. These issues were : first, whether the party making the application\nhas approached the appropriate High Court; and second, whether there is\na valid arbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Act, is a party to such an agreement;\n152.2. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate may choose to\ndecide or leave them to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues\nwere : first, whether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or a live\nclaim; and second, whether the parties have concluded the\ncontract/transaction by recording the satisfaction of their mutual rights\nand obligations or by receiving the final payment without objection; and\n152.3. The issues which the Chief Justice or their designate should leave\nexclusively to the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues were : first, whether a\nclaim made falls within the arbitration clause (as for example, a matter\nwhich is reserved for final decision of a departmental authority and\nexcepted or excluded from arbitration); and second, merits or any claim\ninvolved in the arbitration.\n\n153. The decisions of this Court in Patel Engg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg.\nLtd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab [National Insurance Co.\nLtd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ)\n117] allowed for greater judicial interference at the pre-arbitral stage. In\neffect, the Referral Courts were encouraged to conduct mini trials instead\nof summarily dealing with the preliminary issues. This was also noted by\nthe Law Commission of India, which observed that judicial intervention in\nthe arbitral proceedings is a pervasive problem in India leading to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 16 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nsignificant delays in the arbitration process. [ Law Commission of India,\n246th Report (2014).] The Law Commission recognised that one of the\nproblems plaguing implementation of the\nArbitration Act\nwas that\nSection\napplications were kept pending for years by the Courts. To remedy the\nsituation, the Law Commission proposed changing the then existing\nscheme of the power of appointment being vested in the \"Chief Justice\" to\nthe \"High Court\" and the \"Supreme Court\". It also clarified that the\npower of appointment of arbitrators ought not to be regarded as a judicial\nact.\n\n154. Significantly, the Law Commission observed that there was a need to\nreduce judicial intervention at the pre-arbitral stage, that is, prior to the\nconstitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Accordingly, it proposed limiting the\nscope of the judicial intervention at the referral stage under\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act \"to situations where the Court/Judicial Authority\nfinds that the arbitration agreement does not exist or is null and void\".\n\nThe Law Commission suggested insertion of sub-section (6-A) under\n\nSection 11\nwhich would read:\"Any appointment by the High Court or the\nperson or institution designated by it under sub-section (4) or sub-section\n(5) or sub-section (6) shall not be made only if the High Court finds that\nthe arbitration does not exist or is null and void.\" In light of the\nrecommendations of the Law Commission, Parliament passed the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n(\"the 2015\nAmendment Act\") to incorporate\nSection 11\n(6-A).\n\n155. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act\nstates that sub-section (6-A) is inserted in\nSection 11\nto provide that the\nSupreme Court or the High Court while considering application under\nsub-sections (4) to (6) \"shall confine to the examination of an arbitration\nagreement\". With the coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, the\nnature of preliminary examination at the referral stage under\nSection 11\n\nwas confined to the existence of an arbitration agreement. It also\nincorporates a non obstante clause which covers \"any judgment, decree or\norder of any court\". By virtue of the non obstante clause,\nSection 11\n(6-A)\nhas set out a new position of law, which takes away the basis of the\nposition laid down by the previous decisions of this Court in Patel\nEngg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara\nPolyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009)\n1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 117] . It is also important to note that\nParliament did not incorporate the expression \"or is null and void\" as\nwas suggested by the Law Commission. This indicates that Parliament\nintended to confine the jurisdiction of the Courts at the pre-arbitral stage\nto as minimum a level as possible.\n\n156. The effect and impact of the 2015 Amendment Act was subsequently\nclarified by this Court.\nIn\nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port\nLtd. [Duro Felguera\n,\nS.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017) 9 SCC 729 :\n\n(2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] , Kurien Joseph, J. noted that the intention of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 17 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nlegislature in incorporating\nSection 11\n(6-A) was to limit the scope of the\nReferral Court's jurisdiction to only one aspect -- the existence of an\narbitration agreement. To determine the existence of an arbitration\nagreement, the Court only needs to examine whether the underlying\ncontract contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining to the\ndisputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. This\n\nCourt further held\nthat\nSection 11\n(6-A) incorporates the principle of\nminimal judicial intervention : (SCC p. 765, para 59)\n\"59.\nThe scope of the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act was\nconsiderably wide in view of the decisions in SBP & Co. [SBP &\nCo. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara\nPolyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd.,\n(2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 117] . This position continued\ntill the amendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all\nthat the Courts need to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists-\n\nnothing more, nothing less. The legislative policy and purpose is\nessentially to minimise the Court's intervention at the stage of\nappointing the arbitrator and this intention as incorporated in\nSection\n(6-A) ought to be respected.\"\n\n157. In 2017, the High-Level Committee to Review the Institutionalisation\nof Arbitration Mechanism in India submitted a report noting that while the\n2015 amendment facilitated the speedy disposal of\nSection 11\n\napplications, they failed to limit judicial interference in arbitral\nproceedings. Accordingly, the High-Level Committee recommended the\namendment of\nSection 11\nto provide for appointment of arbitrators solely\nby arbitral institutions designated by the Supreme Court in case of\ninternational commercial arbitrations or the High Court in case of all\nother arbitrations. In view of the report of the High-Level Committee,\nParliament enacted the\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act,\n(\"the 2019 Amendment Act\") omitting\nSection 11\n(6-A) so as to leave\nthe appointment of arbitrators to arbitral institutions.\nSection 1(2)\nof the\n2019 Amendment Act provides that amended provisions shall come into\nforce on such date as notified by the Central Government in the official\ngazette. However,\nSection 3\nof the 2019 Amendment Act which amended\n\nSection 11\nby omitting\nSection 11\n(6-A) is yet to be notified. Till such time,\n\nSection 11\n(6-A) will continue to operate.\n\n158.\nIn\nMayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman [Mayavati\nTrading (P) Ltd.\nv. Pradyuat Deb Burman, (2019) 8 SCC 714 : (2019) 4\nSCC (Civ) 441] , a three-Judge Bench of this Court affirmed the reasoning\nin\nDuro Felguera [Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017)\n9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] by observing that the examination\nunder\nSection 11\n(6-A) is \"confined to the examination of the existence of\nan arbitration agreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense\".\n\nMoreover, it held that the position of law prior to the 2015 Amendment\nAct, as set forth by the decisions of this Court in Patel Engg. [SBP &\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 18 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nCo. v. Patel Engg.

Thus,\nthis Court gave effect to the intention of the legislature in minimising the\nrole of the Courts at the pre-arbitral stage to the bare minimum.\n\n159. Thereafter, in\nVidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n,\n(2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , another three-Judge Bench of\nthis Court, affirmed the ruling in\nMayavati Trading [Mayavati Trading (P)\nLtd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman\n, (2019) 8 SCC 714 : (2019) 4 SCC (Civ)\n441] that Patel Engg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618]\nhas been legislatively overruled.\n\nIn\nVidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga\nTrading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , one of the\nissues before this Court was whether the Court at the reference stage or\nthe Arbitral Tribunal in the arbitration proceedings would decide the\nquestion of non-arbitrability. This Court began its analysis by holding that\nan arbitration agreement has to satisfy the mandate of the\nContract Act\n, in\naddition to satisfying the requirements stipulated under\nSection 7\nof the\nArbitration Act to qualify as an agreement.\n\n160.\nIn the course of the decision, one of the questions before this Court\nin\nVidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 :\n\n(2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] was the interpretation of the word \"existence\" as\nappearing in\nSection 11\n. It was held that existence and validity are\nintertwined. Further, it was observed that an arbitration agreement does\nnot exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy mandatory legal requirements.\n\nTherefore, this Court read the mandate of valid arbitration agreement\ncontained in\nSection 8\ninto the mandate of\nSection 11\n, that is, \"existence of\nan arbitration agreement\".\n\n161. At the outset,\nVidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n,\n(2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] noted that \"\nSection 11\nhas\nundergone another amendment vide Act 33 of 2019 with effect from 9-8-\n2019.\" The purport of the omission of the said clause was further\nexplained in the following terms : (SCC p. 115, para 145)\n\"145. Omission of sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was with the\nspecific object and purpose and is relatable to by substitution of sub-\nsections (12), (13) and (14) of\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act by Act\n33 of 2019, which, vide sub-section (3-A) stipulates that the High\nCourt and this Court shall have the power to designate the arbitral\ninstitutions which have been so graded by the Council under Section\n43-I, provided where a graded arbitral institution is not available, the\nHigh Court concerned shall maintain a panel of arbitrators for\ndischarging the function and thereupon the High Court shall perform\nthe duty of an arbitral institution for reference to the Arbitral\nTribunal.\nTherefore, it would be wrong to accept that post omission of\nsub-section (6-A) of\nSection 11\nthe ratio in Patel Engg. [SBP &\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 19 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nCo. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] would become\napplicable.\"\n\n162.Vidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1\n: (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] proceeds on the presumption that\nSection 11\n(6-\nA) was effectively omitted from the statute books by the 2019 Amendment\nAct. This is also reflected in the conclusion arrived at by the Court, as is\nevident from the following extract : (SCC p. 121, para 154)\n\"154. ... 154.1.\nRatio of the decision in Patel Engg. [SBP &\nCo. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] on the scope of judicial\nreview by the Court while deciding an application under\nSections 8\nor\n11 of the\nArbitration Act\n, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with\nretrospective effect from 23-10-2015) and even post the amendments\nvide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from 9-8-2019), is no longer\napplicable.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n163. We are of the opinion that the above premise of the Court in\nVidya\nDrolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1\nSCC (Civ) 549] is erroneous because the omission of\nSection 11\n(6-A) has\nnot been notified and, therefore, the said provision continues to remain in\nfull force. Since\nSection 11\n(6-A) continues to remain in force, pending the\nnotification of the Central Government, it is incumbent upon this Court to\ngive true effect to the legislative intent.\n\n164. The 2015 Amendment Act has laid down different parameters for\njudicial review under\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\n. Where\nSection 8\nrequires\nthe Referral Court to look into the prima facie existence of\na valid arbitration agreement,\nSection 11\nconfines the Court's jurisdiction\nto the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. Although\nthe object and purpose behind both\nSections 8\nand\nis to compel parties\nto abide by their contractual understanding, the scope of power of the\nReferral Courts under the said provisions is intended to be different. The\nsame is also evident from the fact that\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration Act\nallows an appeal from the order of an Arbitral Tribunal refusing to refer\nthe parties to arbitration under\nSection 8\n, but not from\nSection 11\n. Thus,\nthe 2015 Amendment Act has legislatively overruled the dictum of Patel\nEngg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] where it was\nheld that\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nare complementary in nature.\nAccordingly, the two provisions cannot be read as laying down a similar\nstandard.\n\n165. The legislature confined the scope of reference under\nSection 11\n(6-A)\nto the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. The use of\nthe term \"examination\" in itself connotes that the scope of the power is\nlimited to a prima facie determination. Since the Arbitration Act is a self-\ncontained code, the requirement of \"existence\" of an arbitration\nagreement draws effect from\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act.\nIn\nDuro\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 20 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nFelguera [Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017) 9 SCC\n729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] , this Court held that the Referral Courts\nonly need to consider one aspect to determine the existence of an\narbitration agreement -- whether the underlying contract contains an\narbitration agreement which provides for arbitration pertaining to the\ndisputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement.\nTherefore, the scope of examination under\nSection 11\n(6-A) should be\nconfined to the existence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of\n\nSection 7\n. Similarly, the validity of an arbitration agreement, in view of\n\nSection 7\n, should be restricted to the requirement of formal validity such\nas the requirement that the agreement be in writing. This interpretation\nalso gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-competence by leaving\nthe issue of substantive existence and validity of an arbitration agreement\nto be decided by Arbitral Tribunal under\nSection 16\n.\n\nWe accordingly\nclarify the position of law\nlaid down in\n\nVidya Drolia [Vidya\nDrolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ)\n549] in the context of\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n166. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement\ngenerally lies on the party seeking to rely on such agreement. In\njurisdictions such as India, which accept the doctrine of competence-\ncompetence, only prima facie proof of the existence of an arbitration\nagreement must be adduced before the Referral Court. The Referral Court\nis not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial by allowing the parties\nto adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or validity of an\narbitration agreement. The determination of the existence and validity of\nan arbitration agreement on the basis of evidence ought to be left to the\nArbitral Tribunal. This position of law can also be gauged from the plain\nlanguage of the statute.\n\n167.\nSection 11\n(6-A) uses the expression \"examination of the existence of\nan arbitration agreement\". The purport of using the word \"examination\"\nconnotes that the legislature intends that the Referral Court has to inspect\nor scrutinise the dealings between the parties for the existence of an\narbitration agreement. Moreover, the expression \"examination\" does not\nconnote or imply a laborious or contested inquiry. [ P. Ramanatha\nAiyar, The Law Lexicon (2nd Edn., 1997) 666.] On the other hand,\nSection\nprovides that the Arbitral Tribunal can \"rule\" on its jurisdiction,\nincluding the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. A\n\"ruling\" connotes adjudication of disputes after admitting evidence from\nthe parties. Therefore, it is evident that the Referral Court is only required\nto examine the existence of arbitration agreements, whereas the Arbitral\nTribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction, including the issues pertaining to\nthe existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. A similar view was\nadopted by this Court in Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre\nLtd. [Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd., (2005) 7 SCC\n234]\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 21 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\n23. In this context, I may also allude to the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt in Krish Spinning (supra), where one of the questions that fell for\ndetermination was with respect to the scope and standard of judicial scrutiny\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof 1996 Act, more particularly, in light of the second\nquestion whether the execution of a discharge voucher towards full and final\nsettlement between the parties would operate as bar to invoke arbitration.\n\n24. The Supreme Court referred to earlier judgments of the Supreme\nCourt including Patel Engineering (supra) and\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra)\nand observed that in these two decisions the scope of interference under\n\nSection 11\nwas substantially expanded.\n\nReference was also made to the\ndecision in\nUnited India Insurance Company Limited v. Antique Art\nExports Private Limited\n, (2019) 5 SCC 362, where reliance was placed on\nthe judgments in\nUnion of India and Others v. Master Construction\nCompany\n, (2011) 12 SCC 349 and New India Assurance Company Limited\nv. Genus Power Infrastructure Limited, (2015) 2 SCC 424, both decisions\ndelivered before insertion of\nSection 11\n(6-A) and it was held that in\nAntique\nArt\n(supra), the Supreme Court had failed to take into account the legislative\nintent behind insertion of\nSection 11\n(6-A), which was succinctly explained\nin\nDuro Felguera\n(supra).\n\nThe Supreme Court then referred to and relied on\nthe judgment in\nMayavati Trading\n(supra) overruling the decision in\n\nAntique Art\n(supra).\n\nIn Krish Spinning (supra), the Supreme Court\nobserved that the position after the decisions in\nMayavati Trading\n(supra)\nand\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) was that ordinarily, Court while exercising in its\npower under\nSection 11\nof 1996 Act will only look into the existence of an\narbitration agreement and would refuse arbitration only as a demurrer when\nthe claims are ex facie frivolous and non-arbitrable.\nThereafter, examining\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 22 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nthe effect of the decision in In Re: Interplay (supra), it was held by the\nSupreme Court in Krish Spinning (supra) that scope of examination under\n\nSection 11\n(6-A) is confined to the existence of an arbitration agreement on\nthe basis of\nSection 7\nand this examination is limited to requirement of\nformal validity such as the agreement should be in writing and nothing else.\n\nIt was observed that for this reason, it was difficult to hold that the\nobservations made in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) and adopted in\nNTPC Limited v.\nSPML Infra Limited\n, (2023) 9 SCC 385, that jurisdiction of the referral\nCourt when dealing with the issue of \"accord and satisfaction\" extends to\nweeding out ex facie non-arbitrable and frivolous disputes, would continue\nto apply, despite the decision in In Re: Interplay (supra).\nRelevant passages\nfrom Krish Spinning (supra), are as follows:-\n\n\"73. The net effect of the decisions in SBP & Co. (supra) and\nBoghara\nPolyfab\n(supra) was that the scope for interference available to the\nreferral courts when acting under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 was\nsubstantially expanded. The referral courts were conferred with the\ndiscretion to conduct mini trials and indulge in the appreciation of\nevidence on the issues concerned with the subject matter of arbitration.\nThe Law Commission of India in its 246th report took note of the issue of\nsignificant delays being caused to the arbitral process due to enlarged\nscope of judicial interference at the stage of appointment of arbitrator and\nsuggested as follows:\n\ni. First, that the power of appointment conferred upon the Chief\nJustice be devolved on to the Supreme Court and the High Court, as\nthe case may be; and\nii. Secondly, the power of appointment under\nSection 11\nbe clarified to\nbe an administrative power and not a judicial one.\n\niii. Thirdly, the scope of interference under\nSections 8\nand\nrespectively of the Act, 1996 be restricted only to those cases where\nthe court finds that no arbitration agreement exists or is null and void.\n\n74. The Law Commission suggested the insertion of\nSection 11\n(6-\nA) in the\nAct, 1996\n. The aforesaid recommendations of the Commission were taken\nnote of by the Parliament and accordingly the Act, 1996 was amended in\n2015 to incorporate\nSection 11\n(6-A), which reads thus:\n\"(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 23 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nwhile considering any application under subsection (4) or sub-section\n(5) or sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or\norder of any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an\narbitration agreement.\"\n\n75. Interestingly,\nSection 11\n(6-A) was omitted by the 2019 amendment to\nthe Act, 1996 on the basis of a report of the High-Level Committee to\nReview the Institutionalisation of Arbitration Mechanism in India.\nHowever, in the absence of the omission being notified,\nSection 11\n(6-\nA) of\nthe Act, 1996\ncontinues to remain on the statute book and thus has to be\ngiven effect as such.\n\n76. The impact of the addition of\nSection 11\n(6-A) was elaborately\ndiscussed by this Court in\nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd\n\nreported in (2017) 9 SCC 729 as follows:\n\n\"48. [...] From a reading of\nSection 11\n(6-A), the intention of the\nlegislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should and need only look into\none aspect--the existence of an arbitration agreement. What are the\nfactors for deciding as to whether there is an arbitration agreement is\nthe next question. The resolution to that is simple--it needs to be seen\nif the agreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration\npertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the\nagreement.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n59. The scope of the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act was\nconsiderably wide in view of the decisions in SBP and Co. [(2005) 8\nSCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab [(2009) 1 SCC 267]. This position\ncontinued till the amendment brought about in 2015. After the\namendment, all that the courts need to see is whether an arbitration\nagreement exists--nothing more, nothing less. The legislative policy\nand purpose is essentially to minimise the Court's intervention at the\nstage of appointing the arbitrator and this intention as incorporated in\n\nSection 11\n(6-A) ought to be respected.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n77. Despite the decision in\nDuro Felguera\n(supra), this Court in\nUnited\nIndia Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports Pvt. Ltd.\nreported in\n(2019) 5 SCC 362, while dealing with the issue of \"full and final\nsettlement\" in the context of appointment of an arbitrator, held that mere\nbald allegation by a party that the discharge voucher was obtained under\ncoercion or undue influence would not entitle it to seek referral of the\ndispute to arbitration unless it is able to produce prima facie evidence of\nthe same during the course of proceedings under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act,\n1996. Important paragraphs from\nthe said decision\nare extracted\nhereinbelow:\n\n\"15.

Ltd. case [...]\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n17. It is true that there cannot be a rule of its kind that mere allegation\nof discharge voucher or no claim certificate being obtained by\nfraud/coercion/undue influence practised by other party in itself is\nsufficient for appointment of the arbitrator unless the claimant who\nalleges that execution of the discharge agreement or no claim\ncertificate was obtained on account of fraud/coercion/undue influence\npractised by the other party is able to produce prima facie evidence to\nsubstantiate the same, the correctness thereof may be open for the\nChief Justice/his Designate to look into this aspect to find out at least\nprima facie whether the dispute is bona fide and genuine in taking a\ndecision to invoke\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n18. In the instant case, the facts are not in dispute that for the two\nincidents of fire on 25-9-2013 and 25-10-2013, the appellant\nCompany based on the Surveyor's report sent emails on 5-5-2016 and\n24-6-2016 for settlement of the claims for both the fires dated 25-9-\n2013 and 25-10-2013 which was responded by the respondent through\nemail on the same date itself providing all the necessary information\nto the regional office of the Company and also issued the discharge\nvoucher in full and final settlement with accord and satisfaction.\nThereafter, on 12-7-2016, the respondent desired certain information\nwith details, that too was furnished and for the first time on 27-7-\n2016, it took a U-turn and raised a voice of undue influence/coercion\nbeing used by the appellant stating that it being in financial distress\nwas left with no option than to proceed to sign on the dotted lines. As\nobserved, the phrase in itself is not sufficient unless there is a prima\nfacie evidence to establish the allegation of coercion/undue influence,\nwhich is completely missing in the instant case.\n\n19. In the given facts and circumstances, we are satisfied that the\ndischarge and signing the letter of subrogation was not because of\nany undue influence or coercion as being claimed by the respondent\nand we find no difficulty to hold that upon execution of the letter of\nsubrogation, the claim was settled with due accord and satisfaction\nleaving no arbitral dispute to be examined by an arbitrator to be\nappointed under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n20. The submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that after\ninsertion of sub-section (6-A) to Section 11 of the Amendment Act,\n2015 the jurisdiction of this Court is denuded and the limited mandate\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 25 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nof the Court is to examine the factum of existence of an arbitration\nand relied on the judgment in\nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram\nPort Ltd. [Duro Felguera\n,\nS.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017) 9\nSCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] The exposition in this decision is\na general observation about the effect of the amended provisions\nwhich came to be examined under reference to six arbitrable\nagreements (five agreements for works and one corporate guarantee)\nand each agreement contains a provision for arbitration and there\nwas serious dispute between the parties in reference to constitution of\nArbitral Tribunal whether there has to be Arbitral Tribunal pertaining\nto each agreement. In the facts and circumstances, this Court took\nnote of sub-section (6-A) introduced by the Amendment Act, 2015 to\n\nSection 11\nof the Act and in that context observed that the preliminary\ndisputes are to be examined by the arbitrator and are not for the\nCourt to be examined within the limited scope available for\nappointment of arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. Suffice it to\nsay that appointment of an arbitrator is a judicial power and is not a\nmere administrative function leaving some degree of judicial\nintervention; when it comes to the question to examine the existence of\na prima facie arbitration agreement, it is always necessary to ensure\nthat the dispute resolution process does not become unnecessarily\nprotracted.\n\n21. In the instant case, prima facie no dispute subsisted after the\ndischarge voucher being signed by the respondent without any demur\nor protest and claim being finally settled with accord and satisfaction\nand after 11 weeks of the settlement of claim a letter was sent on\n27-7-2016 for the first time raising a voice in the form of protest\nthat the discharge voucher was signed under undue influence and\ncoercion with no supportive prima facie evidence being placed on\nrecord in absence thereof, it must follow that the claim had been\nsettled with accord and satisfaction leaving no arbitral dispute\nsubsisting under the agreement to be referred to the arbitrator for\nadjudication.\n\n22. In our considered view, the High Court has committed a manifest\nerror in passing the impugned order and adopting a mechanical\nprocess in appointing the arbitrator without any supportive evidence\non record to prima facie substantiate that an arbitral dispute subsisted\nunder the agreement which needed to be referred to the arbitrator for\nadjudication.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n78. It is pertinent to observe that in\nAntique Art\n(supra) the Court placed\nreliance on the decisions in\nMaster Construction\n(supra) and New India\nAssurance (supra). Both these decisions were delivered before the\ninsertion of\nSection 11\n(6-A) by the 2015 amendment to the Act, 1996.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 26 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nThus, this Court in\nAntique Art\n(supra) failed to take into account the\nlegislative intent behind the introduction of\nSection 11\n(6-A), which was\nalso succinctly explained in\nDuro Felguera\n(supra).\n\n79. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in\nMayavati Trading Private\nLimited v. Pradyut Deb Burman\nreported in (2019) 8 SCC 714 overruled\nthe decision in\nAntique Art\n(supra) and clarified that the position of law\nexisting prior to the 2015 amendment to the Act, 1996 under which\nreferral courts had the power to examine the aspect of \"accord and\nsatisfaction\" had come to be legislatively overruled by\nSection 11\n(6-\nA) of\nthe Act, 1996\n.\n\nThe Court, while affirming the reasoning given in\nDuro\nFelguera\n(supra), observed thus:\n\n\"10. This being the position, it is clear that the law prior to the 2015\nAmendment that has been\nlaid down by\nthis Court, which would have\nincluded going into whether accord and satisfaction has taken place,\nhas now been legislatively overruled.\n\nThis being the position, it is\ndifficult to agree with the reasoning contained in the aforesaid\njudgment [\nUnited India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P)\nLtd.\n, (2019) 5 SCC 362 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 785] , as\nSection 11\n(6-A)\nis confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration\nagreement and is to be understood in the narrow sense as has been\n\nlaid down in\nthe judgment in\nDuro Felguera, SA [Duro Felguera, SA\nv. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ)\n764] -- see paras 48 & 59\n\n11. We, therefore, overrule the judgment in\nAntique Art Exports (P)\nLtd. [United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd.\n,\n(2019) 5 SCC 362 : (2019) 2 SCC (Civ) 785] as not having laid down\nthe correct law but dismiss this appeal for the reason given in para 3\nabove.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n90.\nIn\nNTPC Ltd. v. SPML Infra Ltd.\nreported in (2023) 9 SCC 385, a\ntwoJudge Bench of this Court was again faced with the issue of \"accord\nand satisfaction\" in the context of a\nSection 11\npetition for appointment of\narbitrator.\n\nPlacing reliance on\nVidya Drolia\n(supra), this Court gave the\n\"Eye of the Needle\" test to delineate the contours of the power of\ninterference which the referral court may exercise under\nSection 11\nof the\nAct, 1996. The first prong of the said test requires the court to examine the\nvalidity and existence of the arbitration agreement which includes an\nexamination of the parties to the agreement and the privity of the applicant\nto the contract. The second prong of the test requires the court to, as a\ngeneral rule, leave all questions of non-arbitrability to the arbitral\ntribunal and only as a demurrer reject the claims which are ex-facie and\nmanifestly non-arbitrable. However, it was clarified that the standard of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 27 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nthe aforesaid scrutiny is only prima facie, that is, unlike the pre-2015\nposition, the scrutiny does not entail elaborate appreciation of evidence\nand conduct of mini trials by the referral courts. The relevant observations\nmade therein are reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n\"24. Following the general rule and the principle\nlaid down in\n\nVidya\nDrolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 :\n\n(2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , this Court has consistently been holding\nthat the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first authority to determine\nand decide all questions of non-arbitrability.\nIn\nPravin Electricals (P)\nLtd. v. Galaxy Infra & Engg. (P) Ltd. [Pravin Electricals (P) Ltd.\nv.\nGalaxy Infra & Engg. (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 671, paras 29, 30 :\n(2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 307] , Sanjiv Prakash v. Seema Kukreja [Sanjiv\nPrakash v. Seema Kukreja, (2021) 9 SCC 732 : (2021) 4 SCC (Civ)\n597] , and Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. NCC Ltd. [Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd.\n\nv. NCC Ltd., (2023) 2 SCC 539 : (2023) 1 SCC (Civ) 88] , the parties\nwere referred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in each of these\ncases on the objection of non-arbitrability was found to be\ninconclusive. Following the exception to the general principle that the\nCourt may not refer parties to arbitration when it is clear that the\ncase is manifestly and ex facie nonarbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel\nNetworks (India) (P) Ltd. [BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd.,\n(2021) 5 SCC 738 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ) 352] (hereinafter \"Nortel\nNetworks\") and Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B.\nRamachandraiah & Sons [Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B.\nRamachandraiah & Sons, (2021) 5 SCC 705 : (2021) 3 SCC (Civ)\n335] , arbitration was refused as the claims of the parties were\ndemonstrably time-barred.\n\nEye of the needle\n\n25. The abovereferred precedents crystallise the position of law that\nthe pre-referral jurisdiction of the Courts under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nAct is very narrow and inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is\nabout the existence and the validity of an arbitration agreement,\nwhich also includes an inquiry as to the parties to the agreement and\nthe applicant's privity to the said agreement. These are matters which\nrequire a thorough examination by the Referral Court. The secondary\ninquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect to\nthe non-arbitrability of the dispute.\n\n26. As a general rule and a principle, the Arbitral Tribunal is the\npreferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-\narbitrability. As an exception to the rule, and rarely as a demurrer,\nthe Referral Court may reject claims which are manifestly and ex\nfacie nonarbitrable [\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2\nSCC 1, para 154.4 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] [...]\n\n27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of a\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 28 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nclaim is only prima facie. Referral Courts must not undertake a full\nreview of the contested facts; they must only be confined to a primary\nfirst review [\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1,\npara 134 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] and let facts speak for themselves.\nThis also requires the Courts to examine whether the assertion on\narbitrability is bona fide or not.\n\n[\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading\nCorpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] The prima facie\nscrutiny of the facts must lead to a clear conclusion that there is not\neven a vestige of doubt that the claim is non-arbitrable.\n\n[BSNL v.\nNortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd., (2021) 5 SCC 738, para 47 : (2021)\n3 SCC (Civ) 352] On the other hand, even if there is the slightest\ndoubt, the rule is to refer the dispute to arbitration [\nVidya Drolia v.\nDurga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 154.4 : (2021) 1 SCC\n(Civ) 549].\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n91. The justification given in\nNTPC v. SPML\n(supra) for allowing the\nscrutiny of arbitrability at the stage of\nSection 11\npetition was that the\nreferral court is under a duty to protect the parties from being forced to\narbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non-arbitrable, and any\ninterference by the referral court preventing such ex-facie meritless\narbitration could be termed as legitimate. It was observed thus:\n\n\"28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is necessary\nand compelling. It is intertwined with the duty of the Referral Court to\nprotect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\ndemonstrably non-arbitrable . It has been termed as a legitimate\ninterference by Courts to refuse reference in order to prevent wastage\nof public and private resources [\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading\nCorpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1, para 139 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] .\n\nFurther, as noted in\nVidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading\nCorpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] , if this duty within\nthe limited compass is not exercised, and the Court becomes too\nreluctant to intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both,\narbitration and the Court [\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n,\n(2021) 2 SCC 1, para 139 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] .\n\nTherefore, this\nCourt or a High Court, as the case may be, while exercising\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, is not expected to act\nmechanically merely to deliver a purported dispute raised by an\napplicant at the doors of the chosen arbitrator, as explained in\nDLF\nHome Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd. [DLF Home\nDevelopers Ltd.\nv. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd., (2021) 16 SCC 743,\nparas 22, 26]\"\n\n92. The position that emerges from the aforesaid discussion of law on the\nsubject as undertaken by us can be summarised as follows: -\n\ni. There were two conflicting views which occupied the field under the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 29 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nArbitration Act, 1940\n. While the decisions in Damodar Valley (supra)\nand Amar Nath (supra) took the view that the disputes pertaining to\n\"accord and satisfaction\" should be left to the arbitrator to decide,\nthe view taken in\nP.K. Ramaiah\n(supra) and Nathani Steels (supra)\nwas that once a \"full and final settlement\" is entered into between the\nparties, no arbitrable disputes subsist and therefore reference to\narbitration must not be allowed.\n\nii.\nUnder the Act, 1996\n, the power under\nSection 11\nwas characterised\nas an administrative one as acknowledged in the decision in Konkan\nRailway (supra) and this continued till the decision of a seven-Judge\nBench in SBP & Co. (supra) overruled it and significantly expanded\nthe scope of judicial interference under\nSections 8\nand\nSpecial\n\nLeave Petition (C) Nos. 3792/2024 & 7220/2024 Page 62 of 85\n\nrespectively of the Act, 1996.\nThe decision in\nJayesh Engineering\n\n(supra) adopted this approach in the context of \"accord and\nsatisfaction\" cases and held that the issue whether the contract had\nbeen fully worked out and whether payments had been made in full\nand final settlement of the claims are issues which should be left for\nthe arbitrator to adjudicate upon.\n\niii. The decision in SBP & Co. (supra) was applied in\nBoghara\nPolyfab\n(supra) and it was held by this Court that the Chief Justice or\nhis designate, in exercise of the powers available to them under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996, can either look into the question of\n\"accord and satisfaction\" or leave it for the decision of the arbitrator.\nHowever, it also specified that in cases where the Chief Justice was\nsatisfied that there was indeed \"accord and satisfaction\", he could\nreject the application for appointment of arbitrator. The prima facie\nstandard of scrutiny was also expounded, stating that the party\nseeking arbitration would have to prima facie establish that there was\nfraud or coercion involved in the signing of the discharge certificate.\n\nThe position elaborated in\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra) was adopted in a\nnumber of subsequent decisions, wherein it was held that a mere bald\nplea of fraud or coercion was not sufficient for a party to seek\nreference to arbitration and prima facie evidence for the same was\nrequired to be provided, even at the stage of the\nSection 11\npetition.\n\niv. The view taken by SBP & Co. (supra) and\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra)\nwas seen by the legislature as causing delays in the disposal of\n\nSection 11\npetitions, and with a view to overcome the same,\nSection\n(6-A) was introduced in the Act, 1996 to limit the scope of enquiry\nunder\nSection 11\nonly to the extent of determining the \"existence\" of\nan arbitration agreement.\n\nThis intention was acknowledged and given\neffect to by this Court in the decision in\nDuro Felguera\n(supra)\nwherein it was held that the enquiry under\nSection 11\nonly entailed an\nexamination whether an arbitration agreement existed between the\nparties or not and \"nothing more or nothing less\".\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 30 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nv. Despite the introduction of\nSection 11\n(6-A) and the decision in\n\nDuro Felguera\n(supra), there have been diverging views of this Court\non whether the scope of referral court under\nSection 11\nof the Act,\n1996 includes the power to go into the question of \"accord and\nsatisfaction\".\n\nIn\nAntique Art\n(supra) it was held that unless some\nprima facie proof of duress or coercion is adduced by the claimant,\nthere could not be a referral of the disputes to arbitration.\n\nThis view,\nhowever, was overruled in\nMayavati Trading\n(supra) which reiterated\nthe view taken in\nDuro Felguera\n(supra) and held that post the 2015\namendment to the Act, 1996, it was no more open to the Court while\nexercising its power under\nSection 11\nof the Act, Special Leave\nPetition (C) Nos. 3792/2024 & 7220/2024 Page 64 of 85 1996 to go\ninto the question of whether \"accord and satisfaction\" had taken\nplace.\n\nvi. The decision in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) although adopted the view\ntaken in\nMayawati Trading\n(supra) yet it provided that in exceptional\ncases, where it was manifest that the claims were exfacie time barred\nand deadwood, the Court could interfere and refuse reference to\narbitration.\n\nRecently, this view in the context of \"accord and\nsatisfaction\" was adopted in\nNTPC v. SPML\n(supra) wherein the \"eye\nof the needle\" test was elaborated. It permits the referral court to\nreject arbitration in such exceptional cases where the plea of fraud or\ncoercion appears to be ex-facie frivolous and devoid of merit.\n\n93. Thus, the position after the decisions in\nMayavati Trading\n(supra) and\n\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) is that ordinarily, the Court while acting in exercise\nof its powers under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996, will only look into the\nexistence of the arbitration agreement and would refuse arbitration only\nas a demurrer when the claims are ex-facie frivolous and non-arbitrable.\niii. What is the effect of the decision of this Court in In Re: Interplay\nBetween Arbitration Agreements under the\nArbitration and Conciliation\nAct\n1966 and the\nIndian Stamp Act\n1899 on the scope of powers of the\nreferral court under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996?\n\n94. A seven-Judge Bench of this Court, in In Re: Interplay Between\nArbitration Agreements under the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\nand the\nIndian Stamp Act\n1899 reported in 2023 INSC 1066, speaking\neruditely through one of us, Dr Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Chief\nJustice of India, undertook a comprehensive analysis of\nSections 8\nand\nrespectively of the Act, 1996 and, inter alia, made poignant observations\nabout the nature of the power vested in the Courts insofar as the aspect of\nappointment of arbitrator is concerned. Some of the relevant observations\nmade by this Court in In Re: Interplay (supra) are extracted hereinbelow:\n\n\"179. [...] However, the effect of the principle of competence-\ncompetence is that the arbitral tribunal is vested with the power and\nauthority to determine its enforceability. The question of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 31 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nenforceability survives, pending the curing of the defect which renders\nthe instrument inadmissible. By appointing a tribunal or its members,\nthis Court (or the High Courts, as the case may be) is merely giving\neffect to the principle enshrined in\nSection 16\n. The appointment of an\narbitral tribunal does not necessarily mean that the agreement in\nwhich the arbitration clause is contained as well as the arbitration\nagreement itself are enforceable. The arbitral tribunal will answer\nprecisely these questions.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n185. The corollary of the doctrine of competence-competence is that\ncourts may only examine whether an arbitration agreement exists on\nthe basis of the prima facie standard of review. The nature of\nobjections to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal on the basis that\nstamp-duty has not been paid or is inadequate is such as cannot be\ndecided on a prima facie basis. Objections of this kind will require a\ndetailed consideration of evidence and submissions and a finding as to\nthe law as well as the facts. Obligating the court to decide issues of\nstamping at the\nSection 8\nor\nSection 11\nstage will defeat the legislative\nintent underlying the\nArbitration Act\n.\n\n186. The purpose of vesting courts with certain powers under\nSections\nand\nof the Arbitration Act is to facilitate and enable arbitration\nas well as to ensure that parties comply with arbitration agreements.\nThe disputes which have arisen between them remain the domain of\nthe arbitral tribunal (subject to the scope of its jurisdiction as defined\nby the arbitration clause). The exercise of the jurisdiction of the courts\nof the country over the substantive dispute between the parties is only\npossible at two stages:\n\na. If an application for interim measures is filed under\nSection 9\nof\nthe Arbitration Act; or\nb. If the award is challenged under\nSection 34\n. Issues which\nconcern the payment of stamp-duty fall within the remit of the\narbitral tribunal. The discussion in the preceding segments also\nmake it evident that courts are not required to deal with the issue of\nstamping at the stage of granting interim measures under\n\nSection 9\n.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n110. The scope of examination under\nSection 11\n(6-A) is confined to the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of\nSection 7\n. The\nexamination of validity of the arbitration agreement is also limited to the\nrequirement of formal validity such as the requirement that the agreement\nshould be in writing.\n\n111.

The prima facie view on existence of the\narbitration agreement taken by the referral court does not bind either the\narbitral tribunal or the court enforcing the arbitral award.\n\n112. The aforesaid approach serves a two-fold purpose - firstly, it allows\nthe referral court to weed out non-existent arbitration agreements, and\nsecondly, it protects the jurisdictional competence of the arbitral tribunal\nto rule on the issue of existence of the arbitration agreement in depth.\n\n113. Referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration\nand Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, it was observed in In Re:\n\nInterplay (supra) that the High Court and the Supreme Court at the stage\nof appointment of arbitrator shall examine the existence of a prima facie\narbitration agreement and not any other issues. The relevant observations\nare extracted hereinbelow:\n\n\"209. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or High\nCourt at the stage of the appointment of an arbitrator shall\n\"examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement and\nnot other issues\". These other issues not only pertain to the validity\nof the arbitration agreement, but also include any other issues which\nare a consequence of unnecessary judicial interference in the\narbitration proceedings. Accordingly, the \"other issues\" also include\nexamination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by the\nreferral court at the\nSection 8\nor\nSection 11\nstage. The process of\nexamination, impounding, and dealing with an unstamped instrument\nunder the\nStamp Act\nis not a timebound process, and therefore does\nnot align with the stated goal of the\nArbitration Act\nto ensure\nexpeditious and time-bound appointment of arbitrators. [...]\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n114. In view of the observations made by this Court in In Re: Interplay\n(supra), it is clear that the scope of enquiry at the stage of appointment of\narbitrator is limited to the scrutiny of prima facie existence of the\narbitration agreement, and nothing else.\nFor this reason, we find it\ndifficult to hold that the observations made in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) and\nadopted in\nNTPC v. SPML\n(supra) that the jurisdiction of the referral\ncourt when dealing with the issue of \"accord and satisfaction\" under\n\nSection 11\nextends to weeding out ex-facie non-arbitrable and frivolous\ndisputes would continue to apply despite the subsequent decision in In Re:\n\nInterplay (supra).\n\n115. The dispute pertaining to the \"accord and satisfaction\" of claims is\nnot one which attacks or questions the existence of the arbitration\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 33 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nagreement in any way. As held by us in the preceding parts of this\njudgment, the arbitration agreement, being separate and independent from\nthe underlying substantive contract in which it is contained, continues to\nremain in existence even after the original contract stands discharged by\n\"accord and satisfaction\".\n\n116. The question of \"accord and satisfaction\", being a mixed question of\nlaw and fact, comes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitral\ntribunal, if not otherwise agreed upon between the parties. Thus, the\nnegative effect of competence-competence would require that the matter\nfalling within the exclusive domain of the arbitral tribunal, should not be\nlooked into by the referral court, even for a prima facie determination,\nbefore the arbitral tribunal first has had the opportunity of looking into it.\n\n117. By referring disputes to arbitration and appointing an arbitrator by\nexercise of the powers under\nSection 11\n, the referral court upholds and\ngives effect to the original understanding of the contracting parties that\nthe specified disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Mere appointment\nof the arbitral tribunal doesn't in any way mean that the referral court is\ndiluting the sanctity of \"accord and satisfaction\" or is allowing the\nclaimant to walk back on its contractual undertaking. On the contrary, it\nensures that the principal of arbitral autonomy is upheld and the\nlegislative intent of minimum judicial interference in arbitral proceedings\nis given full effect. Once the arbitral tribunal is constituted, it is always\nopen for the defendant to raise the issue of \"accord and satisfaction\"\n\nbefore it, and only after such an objection is rejected by the arbitral\ntribunal, that the claims raised by the claimant can be adjudicated.\n\n118. Tests like the \"eye of the needle\" and \"ex-facie meritless\", although\ntry to minimise the extent of judicial interference, yet they require the\nreferral court to examine contested facts and appreciate prima facie\nevidence (however limited the scope of enquiry may be) and thus are not in\nconformity with the principles of modern arbitration which place arbitral\nautonomy and judicial non-interference on the highest pedestal.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n127. In Arif Azim (supra), while deciding an application for appointment\nof arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996, two issues had arisen\nfor our consideration:\n\ni.\nWhether the Limitation Act, 1963\nis applicable to an application for\nappointment of arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996? If yes, whether the petition filed by M/s Arif\nAzim was barred by limitation?\n\nii. Whether the court may decline to make a reference under\nSection\nof Act, 1996 where the claims are ex-facie and hopelessly\ntimebarred?\n\n128. On the first issue, it was observed by us that the\nLimitation Act, 1963\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 34 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nis applicable to the applications filed under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996.\nFurther, we also held that it is the duty of the referral court to examine\nthat the application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996 is not barred by\nperiod of limitation as prescribed under\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act,\n, i.e., 3 years from the date when the right to apply accrues in favour\nof the applicant. To determine as to when the right to apply would accrue,\nwe had observed in paragraph 56 of the said decision that \"the limitation\nperiod for filing a petition under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996 can only\ncommence once a valid notice invoking arbitration has been sent by the\napplicant to the other party, and there has been a failure or refusal on\npart of that other party in complying with the requirements mentioned in\nsuch notice.\"\n\n129. Insofar as the first issue is concerned, we are of the opinion that the\nobservations made by us in Arif Azim (supra) do not require any\nclarification and should be construed as explained therein.\n\n130. On the second issue it was observed by us in paragraph 67 that the\nreferral courts, while exercising their powers under\nSection 11\nof the Act,\n1996, are under a duty to \"prima-facie examine and reject non-arbitrable\nor dead claims, so as to protect the other party from being drawn into a\ntimeconsuming and costly arbitration process.\"\n\n131. Our findings on both the aforesaid issues have been summarised in\nparagraph 89 of the said decision thus:\n\n\"89. Thus, from an exhaustive analysis of the position of law on the\nissues, we are of the view that while considering the issue of limitation\nin relation to a petition under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996, the\ncourts should satisfy themselves on two aspects by employing a two-\npronged test - first, whether the petition under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nAct, 1996 is barred by limitation; and secondly, whether the claims\nsought to be arbitrated are ex-facie dead claims and are thus barred\nby limitation on the date of commencement of arbitration proceedings.\nIf either of these issues are answered against the party seeking\nreferral of disputes to arbitration, the court may refuse to appoint an\narbitral tribunal.\"\n\n132.\nInsofar as our observations on the second issue are concerned, we\nclarify that the same were made in light of the observations made by this\nCourt in many of its previous decisions, more particularly in\nVidya Drolia\n\n(supra) and\nNTPC v. SPML\n(supra).\nHowever, in the case at hand, as is\nevident from the discussion in the preceding parts of this judgment, we\nhave had the benefit of reconsidering certain aspects of the two decisions\n\nreferred to above\nin the light of the pertinent observations made by a\nseven-Judge Bench of this Court in In Re: Interplay (supra).\n\n133. Thus, we clarify that while determining the issue of limitation in\nexercise of the powers under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996, the referral\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 35 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\ncourt should limit its enquiry to examining whether Section 11(6)\napplication has been filed within the period of limitation of three years or\nnot. The date of commencement of limitation period for this purpose shall\nhave to be construed as per the decision in Arif Azim (supra). As a natural\ncorollary, it is further clarified that the referral courts, at the stage of\ndeciding an application for appointment of arbitrator, must not conduct an\nintricate evidentiary enquiry into the question whether the claims raised\nby the applicant are time barred and should leave that question for\ndetermination by the arbitrator. Such an approach gives true meaning to\nthe legislative intention underlying Section 11(6-\nA) of the Act\n, and also to\nthe view taken in In Re: Interplay (supra).\n\n134. The observations made by us in Arif Azim (supra) are accordingly\nclarified. We need not mention that the effect of the aforesaid clarification\nis only to streamline the position of law, so as to bring it in conformity\nwith the evolving principles of modern-day arbitration, and further to\navoid the possibility of any conflict between the two decisions that may\narise in future. These clarifications shall not be construed as affecting the\nverdict given by us in the facts of Arif Azim (supra), which shall be given\nfull effect to notwithstanding the observations made herein.\nF. CONCLUSION\n\n135. The existence of the arbitration agreement as contained in Clause 13\nof the insurance policy is not disputed by the appellant. The dispute raised\nby the claimant being one of quantum and not of liability, prima facie,\nfalls within the scope of the arbitration agreement. The dispute regarding\n\"accord and satisfaction\" as raised by the appellant does not pertain to\nthe existence of the arbitration agreement, and can be adjudicated upon by\nthe arbitral tribunal as a preliminary issue.\"\n\n25. From a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it is crystal clear that\nthe scope of jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of 1996 Act is limited to\nexamining the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties\non the touchstone of Section 7 of 1996 Act and whether the petition is\nbarred by limitation and no more. It is nobody's case that the petition is time\nbarred. Therefore, I will now examine whether there exists an arbitration\nagreement between Petitioner and Respondent No.1 for reference of disputes\nraised by the Petitioner to arbitration. At the cost of repetition, I may briefly\nrecapitulate the narrative of facts. Petitioner and Respondent No.1 entered\ninto a Collaboration Agreement dated 25.06.2015, whereby Respondent\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 36 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nNo.1 was to inter alia develop and construct a commercial project on the\nproject land. Disputes having arisen, Petitioner took recourse to Section 9 of\n1996 Act and filed a petition before District Court, Faridabad. However,\nduring the pendency of the petition, parties entered into an amicable\nsettlement and terms of settlement were incorporated in a Settlement\nAgreement dated 31.12.2021. In the meantime, the Arbitrator appointed by\nthe parties entered upon reference. After Settlement Agreement was\nexecuted, parties jointly approached the Arbitrator and a Consent Award\nwas passed on 08.04.2022 in terms of the settlement. According to the\nPetitioner, post the Consent Award disputes once again arose between the\nparties, owing to execution of ante-dated Lease Deeds dated 06.04.2022 by\nRespondent No.1, leasing 16 units to third parties as also in respect of the\ntotal carpet area on the 4th and 5th floors in the Mall, in lieu of which\nPetitioner had taken an area of 506.873 sq. mts. i.e., 36.25% of 1398.271 sq.\nmts. on Lower Ground Floor. Petitioner asserts that after the Consent Award\nwhen Auto CAD of 4th and 5th floors was obtained and the Architect of the\nPetitioner company measured the total carpet area, it was revealed that the\nactual area was 2195 sq. mts. and not 1398.271 sq. mts. as represented by\nRespondent No.1 at the time of settlement. Hence, Petitioner sought its share\nin the extra area of 800 sq. mts. (approximately), proportionate to its agreed\nshare and also sent a notice under Section 21 of 1996 Act but Respondent\nNo.1 declined to indulge on the ground that there was full and final\nsettlement of all the disputes and any further claim was barred by res\njudicata and consequently, the disputes were non-arbitrable.\n\n26. Ordinarily, if the parties enter into a full and final settlement of their\ndisputes and in a pending arbitration a Consent Award is passed, Court\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 37 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nwould not entertain a petition under Section 11 of 1996 Act. However, the\nSupreme Court has held in Krish Spinning (supra) that a dispute pertaining\nto full and final settlement itself, by necessary implication being a dispute\narising out of or in relation to or under the substantive contract, would not be\nprecluded from reference to arbitration as the arbitration agreement\ncontained in the original contract continues to be in existence even after the\nparties have discharged the original contract by \"accord and satisfaction\". It\nwas observed that there is no rule of an absolute kind which precludes\narbitration in cases where a full and final settlement has been arrived at.\nRelevant passages are as follows:-\n\n\"54. Although ordinarily no arbitrable disputes may subsist after\nexecution of a full and final settlement, yet any dispute pertaining to the\nfull and final settlement itself, by necessary implication being a dispute\narising out of or in relation to or under the substantive contract, would not\nbe precluded from reference to arbitration as the arbitration agreement\ncontained in the original contract continues to be in existence even after\nthe parties have discharged the original contract by \"accord and\nsatisfaction\".\n\n55. The aforesaid position of law has also been consistently followed by\nthis Court as evident from many decisions.\nIn\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra),\nwhile rejecting the contention that the mere act of signing a \"full and final\ndischarge voucher\" would act as a bar to arbitration, this Court held as\nfollows:\n\n\"44. ... None of the three cases relied on by the appellant lay down a\nproposition that mere execution of a full and final settlement receipt\nor a discharge voucher is a bar to arbitration, even when the validity\nthereof is challenged by the claimant on the ground of fraud, coercion\nor undue influence. Nor do they lay down a proposition that even if\nthe discharge of contract is not genuine or legal, the claims cannot be\nreferred to arbitration. [...]\"\n\n56. Again, in\nR.L. Kalathia and Company v. State of Gujarat\nreported in\n(2011) 2 SCC 400, it was re-iterated that the mere issuance of the no-dues\ncertificate would not operate as a bar against the raising of genuine\nclaims even after the date of issuance of such certificate. The relevant\nobservations are extracted hereinbelow:\n\n\"13. From the above conclusions of this Court, the following\nprinciples emerge:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 38 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\n(1) Merely because the contractor has issued \"no-dues certificate\",\nif there is an acceptable claim, the court cannot reject the same on\nthe ground of issuance of \"no-dues certificate\".\n\n(ii) Inasmuch as it is common that unless a discharge certificate is\ngiven in advance by the contractor, payment of bills are\ngenerally delayed, hence such a clause in the contract would not be\nan absolute bar to a contractor raising claims which are\ngenuine at a later date even after submission of such \"no-claim\ncertificate\".\n\n(iii) Even after execution of full and final discharge voucher/receipt\nby one of the parties, if the said party is able to establish that he is\nentitled to further amount for which he is having adequate\nmaterials, he is not barred from claiming such amount merely\nbecause of acceptance of the final bill by mentioning \"without\nprejudice\" or by issuing \"no-dues certificate\".\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n57. The position that emerges from the aforesaid discussion is that there is\nno rule of an absolute kind which precludes arbitration in cases where a\nfull and final settlement has been arrived at. In\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra),\ndiscussing in the context of a case similar to the one at hand, wherein the\ndischarge voucher was alleged to have been obtained on ground of\ncoercion, it was observed that the discharge of a contract by full and final\nsettlement by issuance of a discharge voucher or a no-dues certificate\nextends only to those vouchers or certificates which are validly and\nvoluntarily executed. Thus, if the party said to have executed the discharge\nvoucher or the no dues certificate alleges that the execution was on\naccount of fraud, coercion or undue influence exercised by the other party\nand is able to establish such an allegation, then the discharge of the\ncontract by virtue of issuance of such a discharge voucher or no dues\ncertificate is rendered void and cannot be acted upon.\n\n58. It was further held in\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra) that the mere execution\nof a full and final settlement receipt or a discharge voucher would not by\nitself operate as a bar to arbitration when the validity of such a receipt or\nvoucher is challenged by the claimant on the ground of fraud, coercion or\nundue influence. In other words, where the parties are not ad idem over\naccepting the execution of the no-claim certificate or the discharge\nvoucher, such disputed discharge voucher may itself give rise to an\narbitrable dispute.\n\n59. Once the full and final settlement of the original contract itself\nbecomes a matter of dispute and disagreement between the parties, then\nsuch a dispute can be categorised as one arising \"in relation to\" or \"in\nconnection with\" or \"upon\" the original contract which can be referred to\narbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause contained in the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 39 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\noriginal contract, notwithstanding the plea that there was a full and final\nsettlement between the parties.\"\n\n27. From a plain reading of the aforesaid passages, it is clear that\nexecution of a full and final settlement may not preclude a party from taking\nrecourse to arbitration if a dispute arises from the settlement itself and this\nlaw applies with full vigour in the present case for an additional reason that\nthe parties themselves envisaged and agreed to refer disputes arising from\nthe Settlement Agreement to arbitration by incorporating Clause 37 in the\nSettlement Agreement, which is as follows:-\n\n\"37. The Parties agree that in case of any dispute arising out of or in\nconnection therewith or in relation thereto then the Parties shall try to\nresolve the same amicably failing which the same shall be decided through\nthe arbitration by a sole arbitrator to be mutually appointed by the Parties\nherein in accordance with law. The award passed by the sole arbitrator\nshall be in English. The seat and venue of the said arbitration proceedings\nshall be at New Delhi. The award passed by the Sole Arbitrator shall be\nbinding the Parties.\"\n\n28. A bare reading of the clause shows that parties agreed that in case any\ndispute arose out of or in connection with the Settlement Agreement or in\nrelation thereto, parties shall try to resolve the same amicably failing which\nthe disputes shall be decided through arbitration by a Sole Arbitrator and the\naward passed by the Sole Arbitrator shall be binding on the parties. Clause\n37 on a plain reading, satisfies all ingredients of Section 7 of 1996 Act\ninasmuch as the agreement is in writing; it evidences the intention of the\nparties to refer the disputes arising from the Settlement Agreement to\narbitration as dispute resolution mechanism and parties agreed to be bound\nby the decision of the Arbitrator. Therefore, tested on the touchstone of\nSection 7, Clause 37 is an arbitration agreement between Petitioner and\nRespondent No.1. [Ref.: In Re: Interplay (supra)].\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 40 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\n29. According to the Petitioner, the disputes have purportedly arisen\nowing to the fact that the total carpet area on the 4th and 5th floors of the Mall\nis 2195 sq. mts. as against 1398.271 sq. meters represented by Respondent\nNo.1 at the time of settlement and Respondent No.1 refuses to apportion the\nextra area of 800 sq. meters (approximately) as per the agreed shares.\nPetitioner asserts that disputes have also arisen since Respondent No.1\nexecuted ante-dated Lease Deeds on 06.04.2022 and illegally leased all 16\nunits beyond the expiry of 6 months from the date of issue of Occupation\nCertificate. The disputes flagged by the Petitioner thus arise out of and are in\nrelation to or under the Settlement Agreement and by virtue of Clause 37 are\nreferrable to arbitration.\n\n30. Coming to the next argument of the Respondents that no reference\ncan be made to arbitration once the earlier arbitral proceedings have\nculminated into a Consent Award dated 08.04.2022, there can be no quarrel\nwith the legal proposition that an arbitral award is enforceable as a decree of\nthe Court. It is equally well settled that if a party is aggrieved by an arbitral\naward, the remedy is to challenge the same under Section 34 of 1996 Act.\nHowever, in the present case, the matter does not rest here inasmuch as the\nConsent Award also contains an arbitration agreement as follows:-\n\n\"QQ. An arbitral award hereby holding that in case of any dispute arising\nout of or in connection with the Settlement Agreement and/or\nCollaboration Agreement or in relation thereto then the Claimant and the\nRespondent shall try to resolve the same amicably failing which the same\nshall be decided through the arbitration by a sole arbitrator to be mutually\nappointed by them in accordance with law. The award passed by the sole\narbitrator shall be in English. The seat and venue of the said arbitration\nproceedings shall be at New Delhi. The award passed by the Sole\nArbitrator shall be binding on the Claimant and the Respondent.\"\n\n31. Clause QQ clearly provides that in case of any dispute arising out of\nor in connection with not only the Settlement Agreement but also\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 41 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nCollaboration Agreement or in relation thereto shall be resolved by the\nparties amicably, failing which the dispute will be decided through\narbitration by the Sole Arbitrator to be mutually appointed by them in\naccordance with law and the award passed by the Sole Arbitrator shall be\nbinding on them. Clearly, Clause QQ passes muster of Section 7 of 1996 Act\nand is an arbitration agreement. The incorporation of Clause QQ in the\nConsent Award is a reflection that parties envisaged that despite settlement\nand the Consent Award, disputes may arise in future and decided that they\nwill be adjudicated through arbitration. As noted above, disputes have arisen\nbetween the parties inter alia with respect to the actual carpet area on 4th and\n5th floors of the Mall as also alleged ante-dating of Lease Deeds dated\n06.04.2022 by Respondent No.1.\nIn fact the existence of Clauses 37 and QQ\nis the distinguishing feature of this case for which reason the judgements\nrelied upon by Respondent No.1 in\nDushyant Janbandhu\n(supra); HPCL\nBio-Fuels (supra); ARSS Infrastructure (supra); and\nJaiprakash\nAssociates\n(supra) are inapplicable as none of these cases had arbitration\nclauses in the Settlement Agreements.\n\n32. Much was argued between the parties with respect to the arbitrability\nof the disputes and bar of res judicata. Broadly understood, contention of\nthe Respondents was that the alleged disputes, which are sought to be\nreferred to arbitration by the Petitioner, stood settled and the Settlement\nAgreement merged in the Consent Award and reference of these disputes is\nbarred by res judicata as also that the disputes arising out of Lease Deeds\nare non-arbitrable. It is trite that the question whether the disputes sought to\nbe referred are arbitrable or not is to be determined and decided by the\nArbitral Tribunal and is beyond the remit of a referral Court under Section\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 42 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\n11 of 1996 Act. This very question came up for consideration in In Re:\n\nInterplay (supra).\nIt was held that the view taken in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra)\nthat exercise of power of judicial review to examine the existence of\narbitration agreement also includes inter alia a prima facie view related to\nnon-arbitrability of the disputes, is erroneous since omission of Section\n11(6-A) has not been notified and continues to remain in full force and\ntherefore, Courts must give true effect to the legislative intent i.e., the scope\nof jurisdiction under Section 11 of 1996 Act must be restricted to\ndetermination of existence of valid arbitration agreement between the\nparties.\n\nThis issue also came up for consideration before the Supreme Court\nin Krish Spinning (supra) and the Supreme Court reemphasised and\nreiterated that the scope of examination under Section 11(6-A) is confined to\nexistence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of Section 7 of 1996 Act\nand nothing else and after the judgment in In Re: Interplay (supra), it is\ndifficult to hold that the observations in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) that the\njurisdiction of the referral Court when dealing with issue of \"accord and\nsatisfaction\" under Section 11 extends to weeding out ex facie non-\narbitrable disputes. This judgment is also important and relevant for the\npresent case since it specifically deals with the issue whether on a plea of\n'full and final settlement' and \"accord and satisfaction\", by a party\ncontesting the appointment of the Arbitrator, reference can be refused.\nNegating this plea, the Supreme Court held that dispute regarding \"accord\nand satisfaction\" or full and final settlement of all disputes does not pertain\nto existence of arbitration agreement and can be adjudicated only by an\nArbitral Tribunal.\n\n33. More specifically, in the context of a plea of res judicata, I may\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 43 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nallude to the judgment in\nSPS Engineering\n(supra), where the Supreme\nCourt held that the question whether a claim is barred by res judicata does\nnot arise for consideration in a proceeding under Section 11 of 1996 Act.\n\nSuch an issue will have to be examined by the Arbitral Tribunal since\ndecision on res judicata requires consideration of pleadings as also claims\nand issues etc. and the limited scope of Section 11 does not permit such\nexamination on facts or in law. Relevant passage is as follows:-\n\n\"16. The question whether a claim is barred by res judicata, does not\narise for consideration in a proceeding under\nSection 11\nof the Act. Such\nan issue will have to be examined by the Arbitral Tribunal. A decision on\nres judicata requires consideration of the pleadings as also the\nclaims/issues/points and the award in the first round of arbitration, in\njuxtaposition with the pleadings and the issues/points/claims in the second\narbitration. The limited scope of\nSection 11\nof the Act does not permit such\nexamination of the maintainability or tenability of a claim either on facts\nor in law. It is for the Arbitral Tribunal to examine and decide whether the\nclaim was barred by res judicata.

Pivotal\nInfrastructure Private Limited and Others\n, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 2363,\nagreed with the contention of the Petitioner that the question whether the\nclaim of 10% share in the built-up area stood settled in terms of past\nlitigations between the parties was akin to a plea of res judicata and could\nnot be decided in a petition under Section 11 of 1996 Act.\n\nThis view was\ntaken earlier by another Coordinate Bench of this Court in\nParsvnath\nDevelopers Limited and Another v.

Legislature has by way of 2015 Amendment Act inserted Section\n11(6-A) restricting the scrutiny of the Court at this stage only to existence of\narbitration agreement. This judgement was upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nTo\nthe same effect is the judgement of this Court in\nHindustan Construction\n\n(supra). Accordingly, the contention of the Respondents that this Court must\nfirst adjudicate on whether the disputes sought to be referred for arbitration\nby the Petitioner are barred by res judicata and are non-arbitrable, only\ndeserves to be rejected.\nIn Krish Spinning (supra), the Supreme Court held\nthat it is not an absolute rule that disputes cannot be referred to arbitration if\nthere is full and final settlement as disputes may still arise from the\nsettlement and this judgement would apply with greater vigour in the present\ncase since the parties themselves envisaged this situation and agreed to\ninclude an arbitration agreement not just in the Settlement Agreement but\nalso in the Consent Award.\n\n35. Respondents No.2 to 4 have contested reference to arbitration on the\nground that they are non-signatories to the arbitration agreement,\nCollaboration Agreement, Settlement Agreement as also not privy to the\nConsent Award. Petitioner is right in contending that the question whether a\nnon-signatory is bound by the arbitration agreement is completely\nindependent of the question concerning the existence of an arbitration\nagreement and therefore, whether or not a non-signatory is a veritable party\nto the arbitration agreement should be left for determination by the Arbitral\nTribunal.\nIn ASF Buildtech Private Limited v. Shapoorji Pallonji and\nCompany Private Limited, (2025) 9 SCC 76, the Supreme Court referring to\nand relying on the judgment in\nCox and Kings\n(supra) held that the entire\nexercise of determining whether a non-signatory is bound by an arbitration\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 45 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nagreement, necessitates a far more expansive enquiry, which transcends the\nlimited question of mere existence of an arbitration agreement since it\nentails interpretation of the scope and contours of the principal agreement,\nan assessment of commercial understanding between the parties,\nexamination of nature and purpose underlying the principal contract and\ncharacter of transactions etc. It was thus held that by no stretch of\nimagination can the issue whether non-signatory is bound by the arbitration\nagreement be characterised as one that is either significant or sine qua non to\nthe determination of existence of the arbitration agreement. The question\ninvolves a more nuanced determination and therefore, even if it is assumed\nthat referral Court in its jurisdiction under Section 11 of 1996 Act has the\ndiscretion to examine this question, Court should not only refrain but rather\nloathe the exercise of such discretion and leave the same to the Arbitral\nTribunal.\n\nIn this context, I may also refer to the judgments of the Supreme\nCourt in\nAdavya Projects Pvt. Ltd. v. Vishal\nstructural Pvt. Ltd. and\nOthers, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 806; and\nOPG Power Generation Private\nLimited v.

The relevant\nobservations read as under:--\n\n\"110.\nIn\nDiscovery Enterprises\n(supra), this Court refined and\nclarified the cumulative factors that the courts and tribunals should\nconsider in deciding whether a company within a group of companies\nis bound by the arbitration agreement:\n\n\"40. In deciding whether a company within a group of companies\nwhich is not a signatory to arbitration agreement would nonetheless\nbe bound by it, the law considers the following factors:\n\n(i) The mutual intent of the parties;\n\n(ii) The relationship of a non-signatory to a party which is a signatory\nto the agreement;\n\n(iii) The commonality of the subject-matter;\n\n(iv) The composite nature of the transactions; and\n\n(v) The performance of the contract.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n76. Owing to the intrinsic character of the test -- being one that entails a\nfact- intensive inquiry involving a mixed question of fact and law -- and\nfurther, given the extensive standard it demands, requiring a\ncomprehensive and holistic appraisal of all material facts and attendant\ncircumstances, it may be safely concluded that the arbitral tribunal is the\nmore appropriate and competent forum to adjudicate upon the issue of\nwhether a non-signatory is bound by the arbitration agreement, as the\narbitral as it has the innate advantage of going through all the relevant\nevidence and pleadings in greater depth and detail than the referral court\nat the pre-reference stage, and as such is uniquely positioned to undertake\nsuch a nuanced determination.\n\nII. Determining the \"existence\" viz-à-viz the intention of parties from\n\"express words\" of an Arbitration Agreement.\n\n77.\nIn order to resolve the question whether the issue of a non-signatory\nbeing bound by an arbitration agreement could be said to be inextricably\nintertwined with the determination of the \"existence\" of the arbitration\nagreement, it is apposite to once again advert to\nCox and Kings\n(I\n) (supra), more particularly, as to the manner in which it envisages the\nidentification and determination of the binding effect of an arbitration\nagreement upon a non-signatory, based on the factual aspects delineated\nby it, as mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n78.\nCox and Kings (I\n) (supra) observed that the \"legal relationship of a\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 47 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nnon- signatory to a party which is a signatory to the agreement\" must be\nanalyzed in the context of the underlying substantive contract which\ncontains the arbitration agreement. This may be ascertained either from\nthe duty or relationship attributed to the non-signatory within the\nunderlying contract or may be inferred from its conduct with respect to\nsuch contract. If the underlying contract forms basis for a subject-matter\ncommon to both the signatory and the non-signatory or any composite\ntransaction by them, then it would be a positive indicum for inferring the\nconsent of the non-signatory to arbitrate with respect to the subject-\nmatter. Transactions by a non-signatory which are interlinked with the\nunderlying contract in such manner, in the absence of which the\nperformance of the contract may not be feasible, is one another instance\nfor inferring this consent.\nPlacing reliance on Chloro Controls (supra) it\nobserved that factors such as \"commonality of the subject- matter\" or\n\"composite transaction\" would have to be gathered from the conjoint\nreading of the principal and supplementary agreements on the one hand,\nand the intention of the parties and their conduct on the other. Amongst\nthese, the participation of the non-signatory in the performance of the\nunderlying contract is the most crucial factor to discern the intention of\nthe parties.\n\n\"112.\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act broadly talks about an\nagreement by the parties in respect of a defined legal relationship,\nwhether contractual or not. Such a legal relationship must give rise to\nlegal obligations and duties. In a corporate group, a company may\nhave various related companies. The legal relationship must be\nanalysed in the context of the underlying contract containing the\narbitration agreement. The nature of the contractual relationship can\neither be formally encrusted in the underlying contract, or it can also\nbe inferred from the conduct of the signatory and non-signatory\nparties with respect to such contract. [...]\n\n115. In case of multiple parties, the necessity of a common subject-\nmatter and composite transaction is an important factual indicator.\nAn arbitration agreement arises out of a defined legal relationship\nbetween the parties with respect to a particular subject matter.\nCommonality of the subject matter indicates that the conduct of the\nnon-signatory party must be related to the subject matter of the\narbitration agreement. For instance, if the subject matter of the\ncontract underlying the arbitration agreement pertains to distribution\nof healthcare goods, the conduct of the non-signatory party should\nalso be connected or in pursuance of the contractual duties and\nobligations, that is, pertaining to the distribution of healthcare goods.\nThe determination of this factor is important to demonstrate that the\nnon-signatory party consented to arbitrate with respect to the\nparticular subject matter.\n\n116. In case of a composite transaction involving multiple\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 48 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nagreements, it would be incumbent for the courts and tribunals to\nassess whether the agreements are consequential or in the nature of a\nfollow-up to the principal agreement. This Court in Canara\nBank (supra) observed that a composite transaction refers to a\nsituation where the transaction is interlinked in nature or where the\nperformance of the principal agreement may not be feasible without\nthe aid, execution, and performance of the supplementary or ancillary\nagreements.\n\n117. The general position of law is that parties will be referred to\narbitration under the principal agreement if there is a situation where\nthere are disputes and differences \"in connection with\" the main\nagreement and also disputes \"connected with\" the subject- matter of\nthe principal agreement In Chloro Controls (supra), this Court\nclarified that the principle of \"composite performance\" would have to\nbe gathered from the conjoint reading of the principal and\nsupplementary agreements on the one hand, and the explicit intention\nof the parties and attendant circumstances on the other. The common\nparticipation in the commercial project by the signatory and non\nsignatory parties for the purposes of achieving a common purpose\ncould be an indicator of the fact that all the parties intended the non-\nsignatory party to be bound by the arbitration agreement. [...]\"\n\n118. The participation of the non-signatory in the performance of the\nunderlying contract is the most important factor to be considered by\nthe courts and tribunals. The conduct of the non- signatory parties is\nan indicator of the intention of the non- signatory to be bound by the\narbitration agreement. The intention of the parties to be bound by an\narbitration agreement can be gauged from the circumstances that\nsurround the participation of the non signatory party in the\nnegotiation, performance, and termination of the underlying contract\ncontaining such agreement. The UNIDROIT Principle of International\nCommercial Contract, 201698 provides that the subjective intention of\nthe parties could be ascertained by having regard to the following\ncircumstances:\n\n(a) preliminary negotiations between the parties;\n\n(b) practices which the parties have established between themselves;\n\n(c) the conduct of the parties subsequent to the conclusion of the\ncontract;\n\n(d) the nature and purpose of the contract;\n\n(e) the meaning commonly given to terms and expressions in the trade\nconcerned; and\n\n(f) usages.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n79. What can be discerned from the above is that, the entire exercise of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 49 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\ndetermining whether a non-signatory is bound by an arbitration\nagreement, in contradistinction to the narrow question of the \"existence\"\nof the arbitration agreement, necessitates a far more expansive inquiry.\nThis inquiry transcends the limited question of the mere \"existence\" as it\nentails an interpretation of the scope and contours of the principal\nagreement, an assessment of the commercial understanding between the\nparties, examination of the nature and purpose underlying the principal\ncontract, and the character of the transactions and conduct of the parties\nviz-à-viz the object and wisdom of the parties underlying contractual\narrangement. Such an exercise mandates a detailed and comparative\nevaluation of the substantive provisions of both the principal and\nsupplementary agreements, and not merely of the arbitration agreement or\nclause in isolation.\n\n80. The determination of the \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement, by\ncontrast, is confined to examining the formal validity of the arbitration\nagreement or the arbitration clause itself, where only the arbitration\nagreement or clause, as the case may be has to be looked into. It does not\nrequire delving into the broader legal relationships emerging from the\nunderlying contractual framework.\nCox and Kings (I\n) (supra) specifically\nmandates a holistic appraisal of the principal and supplementary\nagreements in tandem with the parties' intention and conduct, thereby\ndemanding an inquiry far more extensive than that required for the mere\nestablishment of the existence of the arbitration agreement.\n\n81. Thus, by no stretch of imagination can the issue of whether a non-\nsignatory is bound by the arbitration agreement be characterized as one\nthat is either significant or sine qua non to the determination of the\narbitration agreement's \"existence\". The former necessitates a substantive\nexamination of the entire contractual relationship, whereas the latter is a\nlimited exercise directed only at confirming the formal validity of the\narbitration agreement itself. Such a question is not one of \"existence\" of\nthe arbitration agreement, but one of interpretation and scope of the\nprinciple agreement.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n84. From the above exposition of law, it can be seen that this Court in\nCox\nand Kings (I\n) (supra) recognized that there exists a fine but pertinent\ndistinction between determining the \"existence\" of an arbitration\nagreement and determining the intention of the parties from the \"express\nwords\" used in the arbitration agreement, when dealing with the question\nwhether a non- signatory is bound by the arbitration agreement or not.\nThe former only deals with determining whether an arbitration agreement\nexists and is present in the record of agreement or the written materials as\ndelineated under Section 7 sub- section (4)(b) of the Act, 1996. The latter,\nin contrast, involves construction and interpretation of the \"express\nwords\" that has been used in such material from the surrounding\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 50 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\ncircumstances such as nature and object of the contract and the conduct of\nthe parties during the formation, performance, and discharge of the\ncontract, and how the arbitration agreement fits within the broader\ncontractual framework.\n\n85. Once the referral court, identifies an arbitration agreement that\nsatisfies the formal requirements of\nSection 7\nof the Act, 1996, either from\nthe record of agreement or the written materials under sub-section (4), the\n\"existence\" of the arbitration agreement is said to have been established,\neven though, its binding nature qua the non-signatory may not be\nestablished, as it is entirely possible for a referral court to arrive at\nfinding that prima-facie there exists an arbitration agreement in terms of\n\nSection 7\nof the Act, 1996 without resolving the question of whether a non-\nsignatory is bound by such arbitration agreement or not, as it depends on\nadditional factors beyond mere existence.\n\n86. Once, the \"existence\" of the arbitration agreement is said to have\nbeen established, the condition stipulated in terms of Section 11 sub-\nsection (6\nA) of the Act, 1996\n, is said to have been fulfilled, and the referral\ncourts have no option but to refer the dispute to arbitration,\nnotwithstanding whether the intention of a non-signatory as a veritable\npartly to such agreement is established or not. Apart from the pre-\ncondition of examining the \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement,\n\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 does not either contemplate or require\ndetermination of the \"defined legal relationship\" in terms of Section 7,\nnor does it mandate an assessment of the futuro intention of the parties,\nwhether signatories or non-signatories, from the \"express words\" of the\narbitration agreement. This limited inquiry does not extend to the\nsubstantive legal consequences or implications of such arbitration\nagreement. The question of whether a non-signatory is bound by the\narbitration agreement is entirely separate from the question of its\n\"existence.\" The latter is a relatively straightforward, procedural\ndetermination based on the formal presence of the agreement, whereas the\nformer involves a substantive and contextual inquiry into the mutual intent\nof the parties, which may be examined by the arbitral tribunal.\n\n87. What follows from this is that, the question whether a non-signatory is\nbound by the arbitration agreement is completely independent of the\nquestion concerning the \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement. The two\ninquiries -- while related -- are distinct in nature and function. The\n\"existence\" of an arbitration agreement pertains solely to its formal\npresence in the contractual documentation, as per the requirements under\nthe Act, 1996 and once established, it obligates the referral of the dispute\nto arbitration. By contrast, the question of whether a non-signatory is\nbound by the arbitration agreement involves a more nuanced\ndetermination of the parties' intentions, contractual relationships, and the\nbroader context of the agreement, which is not confined to the formal text\nof the arbitration clause alone.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 51 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\n88. Thus, even in the absence of the non-signatory being made a party to\nthe proceedings before the referral court, and where the question of its\nimpleadment has neither been raised nor addressed or left open to the\narbitral tribunal by the referral court, the arbitral tribunal would be full\nempowered to examine this issue in the first instance and determine\nwhether any non- signatory is bound by the arbitration agreement based\non the factual circumstances of the case, and if necessary, implead such\nnon-signatory to the arbitration proceedings.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n90. This is further fortified from the fact that,\nCox and Kings (I\n) (supra) in\nits subsequent paragraphs, more particularly paragraph No.164, while\ndiscussing the scope of\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996, distinctively refers to\nand treats the criterion of \"existence of arbitration agreement\" and\n\"veritable party to the arbitration agreement\", as two separate and\nindependent inquiries, thereby underscoring that the determination of the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement stands apart from the assessment of\nwhether a non-signatory can be bound to it.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n92. Thus, what has been conveyed in so many words by Ajay Madhusudan\nPatel (supra) is that the inquiry into whether a non-signatory is bound by\nan arbitration agreement is not, in its essence, an inquiry into the formal\nor juridical existence of the arbitration agreement itself. It is an exercise\nof determining the functional concept of consent within the existing\narbitration agreement rather than the existence of the arbitration\nagreement itself. It is to cull out and discern the intention of various\nparties -- whether signatories or otherwise -- in relation to their\nwillingness to be bound by the arbitration mechanism embedded in the\ncontract.\n\n93. Put differently, although notionally the exercise of determining\n'existence of the arbitration agreement qua the non-signatory', may, on\nthe surface appear to be concerned with the arbitration agreement or\nclause in question, yet one must be mindful that the actual focus of\nsuch exercise lies in determining the existence of consent of the parties\nthrough fact patterns to such arbitration agreement or clause and not\nvice-versa. It is the existence of mutual consent to arbitrate -- not the\nformal existence of the arbitration agreement -- that is the heart of this\ninquiry.\n\n94. There runs no umbilical cord between the exercise of determining the\n\"existence of the arbitration agreement\" and determining its \"existence\nqua the non-signatory\". The latter is an independent and substantive\ndetermination that falls outside the narrow and circumscribed domain of\nthe referral court's singular obligation under Section 11 sub-section (6\nA)\nof the Act, 1996\nand as such cannot be conflated to be one pertaining to or\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 52 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nattacking the \"existence\" of an arbitration.\n\n95. Even if it is assumed for a moment that the referral court in its\njurisdiction under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 has the discretion to\ndetermine whether a non-signatory is a veritable party to the arbitration\nagreement or not, by virtue of\nCox and Kings (I\n) (supra), the referral court\nshould only refrain but rather loathe the exercise of such discretion. Any\ndiscretion which is conferred upon any authority, be it referral courts must\nbe exercised reasonably and in a fair manner. Fairness in this context\ndoes not just extend to a non-signatory's rights and its apprehension of\nprejudice, fairness also demands that the arbitration proceedings is given\ndue time to gestate so that the entire dispute is holistically decided. Any\ndetermination even if prima-facie by a referral court on such aspects\nwould entail an inherent risk of frustrating the very purpose of resolution\nof dispute, if the referral courts opine that a non- signatory in question is\nnot a veritable party. On the other hand, the apprehensions of prejudice\ncan be properly mitigated by leaving such question for the arbitral\ntribunal to decide, as such party can always take recourse to\nSection 16\nof\nthe Act, 1996 and thereafter in appeal under Section 37, and where it is\nfound that such party was put through the rigmarole of arbitration\nproceedings vexatiously, both the tribunal and the courts, as the case may\nbe, should not only require that all costs of arbitration insofar as such\nnon- signatory is concerned be borne by the party who vexatiously\nimpleaded it, but the arbitral tribunal would be well within its powers to\nalso impose costs.\n\nIII. Decision of Cox and Kings (II) and Ajay Madhusudan and the scope\nof\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 for joinder of non-signatories to\narbitration proceedings.\n\n96. The aforesaid may be looked at from one another angle. This Court\nin\nCox and Kings (I\n) (supra) also discussed the role and scope of\njurisdiction of the referral courts and arbitral tribunals under Section(s)\n11 and 16 of the Act, 1996, particularly in the context of binding a non-\nsignatory to the arbitration agreement. It reiterated that under Section 11,\nthe referral court only has to determine the prima-facie existence of an\narbitration agreement. Whereas, the issue of determining parties to an\narbitration agreement is quite distinct from \"existence\" of the arbitration\nagreement, as such issue goes to the very root of the jurisdiction\ncompetence of the arbitral tribunal, and thus, empowered to decide the\nsame under Section 16.\n\nPlacing reliance on the decision of this Court\nin\nShin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd.\nreported in, (2005) 7\nSCC 234, it held that the referral court should not unnecessarily interfere\nwith arbitration proceedings, and rather allow the arbitral tribunal to\nexercise its primary jurisdiction for deciding such issues. The relevant\nobservations read as under:--\n\n\"157. When deciding the referral issue, the scope of reference\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 53 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\nunder both Sections 8 and 11 is limited. Where Section 8 requires\nthe referral court to look into the prima facie existence of a\nvalid arbitration agreement, Section 11 confines the court's\njurisdiction to the existence of the examination of an arbitration\nagreement.\n\n158.\nSection 16\nof the Arbitration Act enshrines the principle of\ncompetence competence in Indian arbitration law. The provision\nempowers the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction,\nincluding any ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or\nvalidity of arbitration agreement. Section 16 is an inclusive provision\nwhich comprehends all preliminary issues touching upon the\njurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. The doctrine of competence\ncompetence is intended to minimize judicial intervention at the\nthreshold stage. The issue of determining parties to an arbitration\nagreement goes to the very root of the jurisdictional competence of the\narbitral tribunal.\n\n161. The above position of law leads us to the inevitable conclusion\nthat at the referral stage, the court only has to determine the prima\nfacie existence of an arbitration agreement. If the referral court\ncannot decide the issue, it should leave it to be decided by the\narbitration tribunal. unnecessarily interfere with arbitration\nproceedings, and rather allow the arbitral tribunal to exercise its\nprimary jurisdiction.\nIn\nShin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre\nLtd.125\n, this Court observed that there are distinct advantages to\nleaving the final determination on matters pertaining to the validity of\nan arbitration agreement to the tribunal [...]\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n97.\nCox and Kings (I\n) (supra) further observed that in case of joinder of\nnon- signatory parties to an arbitration agreement, the referral court will\nbe required to prima-facie rule on the existence of the arbitration\nagreement and whether the non-signatory is a veritable party to the\narbitration. However, it further clarified that, due to the inherent\ncomplexity in determining whether the non- signatory is indeed a veritable\nparty, the referral court should leave this question for the arbitral tribunal\nto decide as it can delve into the factual and circumstantial evidence along\nwith its legal aspects for deciding such an issue. The relevant observations\nread as under:--\n\n\"163. [...] Thus, when a non-signatory person or entity is arrayed as\na party at Section 8 or Section 11 stage, the referral court should\nprima facie determine the validity or existence of the arbitration\nagreement, as the case may be, and leave it for the arbitral tribunal to\ndecide whether the non signatory is bound by the arbitration\nagreement.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 54 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\n164. In case of joinder of non-signatory parties to an arbitration\nagreement, the following two scenarios will prominently emerge :\n\nfirst, where a signatory party to an arbitration agreement seeks\njoinder of a non-signatory party to the arbitration agreement; and\nsecond, where a non-signatory party itself seeks invocation of an\narbitration agreement. In both the scenarios, the referral court will be\nrequired to prima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration\nagreement and whether the non-signatory is a veritable party to the\narbitration agreement. In view of the complexity of such a\ndetermination, the referral court should leave it for the arbitral\ntribunal to decide whether the non signatory party is indeed a party to\nthe arbitration agreement on the basis of the factual evidence and\napplication of legal doctrine. The tribunal can delve into the factual,\ncircumstantial, and legal aspects of the matter to decide whether its\njurisdiction extends to the non-signatory party. In the process, the\ntribunal should comply with the requirements of principles of natural\njustice such as giving opportunity to the non-signatory to raise\nobjections with regard to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. This\ninterpretation also gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-\ncompetence by leaving the issue of determination of true parties to an\narbitration agreement to be decided by arbitral tribunal under Section\n\n16.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n98. Thus, even if it is assumed for a moment, that the question whether a\nnon- signatory is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement is\nintrinsically connected with the issue of \"existence\" of arbitration\nagreement, the referral courts should still nevertheless, leave such\nquestions for the determination of the arbitral tribunal to decide, as such\nan interpretation gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-\ncompetence enshrined under\nSection 16\nof the Act, 1996.\n\n99. This hands-off approach of referral courts in relation to the question\nof whether a non-signatory is a veritable party to the arbitration\nagreement or not was reiterated in Cox and Kings (II), wherein one of us,\n(J.B. Pardiwala J.), observed that once an arbitral tribunal stands\nconstituted, it becomes automatically open to all parties to raise any\npreliminary objections, including preliminary objections touching upon\nthe jurisdiction of such tribunal, and to seek an early determination\nthereof. Consequently, the issue of impleadment of a non-signatory was\ndeliberately left for the arbitral tribunal to decide, after taking into\nconsideration the evidence adduced before it by the parties and the\nprinciples enunciated under\nCox and Kings (I\n) (supra).\n\n100. Similarly, in Ajay Madhusudan (supra) it was held that since a\ndetailed examination of numerous disputed questions of fact was required\nfor determining whether the non-signatory is a veritable party to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 55 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\narbitration agreement, the same cannot be examined in the limited\njurisdiction under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 as it would tantamount to a\nmini trial. Accordingly, the arbitral tribunal was found to be the\nappropriate forum for deciding the said issue on the basis of the evidence\nthat may be adduced by the parties.\n\n101. This approach is necessitated by the inherent complexity involved in\ndetermining whether a non-signatory qualifies as a veritable party to the\narbitration agreement, a determination that hinges upon a multiplicity of\nfactual aspects and demands a high threshold of satisfaction based on a\ncumulative and holistic evaluation of the entire factual matrix. Such an\nintricate and evidence-driven exercise makes the arbitral tribunal the most\nappropriate forum to adjudicate the matter, as it possesses the\ninstitutional advantage of conducting a comprehensive scrutiny of all\nevidences and materials adduced by the parties.\n\n102. Furthermore, the legislative intent underlying\nSection 11\nof the Act,\n1996 -- particularly sub-section (6A) -- is to ensure the expeditious\ndisposal of applications for the appointment of arbitrators. This legislative\nobjective militates against referral courts undertaking any elaborate or\ndetailed factual inquiry, which would inevitably delay proceedings.\nPrudence thus dictates that the referral courts confine themselves to\na prima-facie examination of the existence of the arbitration agreement\nand leave substantive determinations, such as the binding nature of non-\nsignatories, to the arbitral tribunal. An additional and equally compelling\nconsideration is that the power exercised by the referral courts under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 is judicial in nature. Consequently, referral\ncourts must refrain from embarking upon an intricate evidentiary inquiry\nor making final determinations on matters that are within the jurisdiction\nof the arbitral tribunal. Any premature adjudication or opinion by the\nreferral court would not only usurp the tribunal's role as the forum of first\ninstance for dispute resolution but could also cause irremediable\nprejudice. In particular, if the referral court were to refuse impleadment of\na non-signatory, there would be no statutory right of appeal available to\nchallenge such a refusal. In contrast, determinations made by the arbitral\ntribunal -- including on issues of jurisdiction and impleadment -- are\namenable to challenge under\nSection 16\nof the Act, 1996 and, thereafter,\nunder Section 37. Accordingly, the better course of action is for referral\ncourts to refrain altogether from delving, into the issue of whether a non-\nsignatory is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement, and to leave\nsuch matters for the arbitral tribunal to decide in the first instance.\"\n\n36. It is thus luminously clear that the question whether Respondents\nNo.2 to 4 being non-signatories are veritable parties to the arbitration\nagreement will have to be left to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal and\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR ARB.P. 1294/2023 & connected matter Page 56 of 58\n\nSigning Date:06.12.2025\n\n17:59:30\n\ncannot be subject matter of adjudication in the present petition.\nAccordingly, Respondents No.2 to 4 are deleted from the array of parties in\nthe present petition with liberty to the Petitioner to seek their impleadment\nduring the arbitral proceedings and as and when an application is filed by the\nPetitioner, the same shall be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance\nwith law.\n\n37. In light of the existence of valid arbitration agreement between the\nPetitioner and Respondent No.1, this Court finds no impediment in\nappointing a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes arising between the\nparties. Accordingly, Ms. Justice Mukta Gupta (Mobile No. 9650788600),\nformer judge of this Court is appointed as Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the\ndisputes between the parties. Fees of the learned Arbitrator will be fixed as\nper Fourth Schedule of the 1996 Act.\n\n38. Learned Arbitrator shall give disclosure under Section 12 of the 1996\nAct before entering upon reference.\n\n39. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion on the\nmerits of the case and all rights and contentions of the parties are left open.\n\n40.

By judgment dated 22.05.2023, Court restrained Respondent No.1\nfrom dealing with Petitioner's share in the subject Mall and the interim order\nhas continued till date.\n\n42.
