JUSTICE P. B. BAJANTHRI\n and\n HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAMESH CHAND\n MALVIYA\n ORAL JUDGMENT\n (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE P. B. BAJANTHRI)\n\n Date : 31-01-2024\n\n The Bihar State Power (Holding) Company Limited\n\n through the Managing Director, the present L.P.A. is filed in\n\n assailing the order of the learned Single Judge dated 07.08.2019\n\n passed in C.W.J.C. No.13542 of 2019.\n\n 2. The brief facts of the case are that on 06.07.2006,\n\n the appellants notified contractual appointment. Pursuant to the\n\n advertisement, members of the Employees Association-\n\n Respondents submitted their application and they were selected\n\n and appointed on 13.12.2006. Such a contract appointment was\n\n for a period of one year and it was extendable from time to time\n\n and they were appointed on consolidated pay of Rs.5000/- per\n\n month. On 03/04 March, 2015, the appellants have taken a\n\n decision \"Appointment of the persons engaged on contract on\n\n various post in regular pay-scale\" and they proceeded to resolve\n\n as under:\n\n \"RESOLVED THAT the personnel engaged\n on Contract Basis on the post of Legal\n Supervisor-II, Stenographer-II, Junior\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n 3/28\n\n Line man, Switch Board Operator,\n Assistant Operator, Computer Data Entry\n Operator, shall be appointed in regular\n pay scale on the terms and conditions as\n mentioned in Para-7 of the Agenda\n Notes.\"\n\n 3. Pursuant to the aforementioned decision,\n\n members of the Respondents-Associations' services were\n\n regularized to the post of Switch Board Operator, Grade-II in\n\n PB-I, Pay Band of Rs.5200-20200, GP-2900 with terms and\n\n conditions.

In this backdrop, the members of the\n\n Respondents-Association filed C.W.J.C. No.5532 of 2019 in\n\n seeking a direction to extend A.C.P., M.A.C.P. and other service\n\n benefits while counting the service rendered on contract basis\n\n during the intervening period from 13.12.2006 till 31.03.2015.\n\n The aforementioned writ petition was disposed of on 09.04.2019\n\n with a direction to the Respondent-Association to consider\n\n representation to the appellants. The Respondent-Association\n\n had submitted representation on 03.04.2018 and it was rejected\n\n on 29.04.2019. Rejection of the members of the respondents'\n\n claim is the subject matter of C.W.J.C. No.13542 of 2019 and it\n\n was decided in favour of the respondents-members of the\n\n Association to the extent that they are entitled to count the\n\n contract service during the intervening period from 13.12.2006\n\n to 31.03.2015 for the purpose of service benefits towards grant\n\n of A.C.P. and M.A.C.P. and other service benefits.\n\n 5. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\n\n order of the learned Single Judge, the present L.P.A. is presented\n\n by the Appellants-Company.\n\n 6. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted\n\n that the service rendered by the members of the respondents are\n\n not entitled to count the service of intervening period\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n 7/28\n\n from13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 for the purpose of service\n\n benefits like M.A.C.P. and other benefits for the reasons that\n\n they have entered into the respective cadre on regular basis on\n\n 31.03.2015\n vide Annexure-P7 to C.W.J.C. Such regularization\n\n of the members of the respondents are not with retrospective\n\n effect so as to claim any service benefits for contractual service.\n\n The respondents have not questioned the validity of order dated\n\n 31.03.2015 related to regularization to the effect that they are\n\n entitled to have the benefit of regularization with retrospective\n\n effect from the date they were initially appointed on contractual\n\n basis, i.e., with effect from 13.12.2006. It is also submitted that\n\n conditions stipulated in the order dated 31.03.2015 insofar as\n\n condition nos.(vii), (viii) and (ix)a have not been questioned. In\n\n other words they have accepted the terms and conditions\n\n stipulated in the order of regularization dated 31.03.2015. It is\n\n further submitted that M.A.C.P. Rules/Schemes is applicable to\n\n only regular holder of the post and not in respect of\n\n adhoc/contract employees during the intervening period from\n\n the inception of M.A.C.P. Rules issued in the year 2010\n\n (M.A.C.P. Scheme dated 07.10.2010). No doubt, M.A.C.P.\n\n Scheme 2010 was modified in respect of paragaph-9 while\n\n substituting the word \"adhoc/contract employee\" was\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 8/28\n\n substituted as only \"adhoc\" In other words, from the inception\n\n of the M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules issued in the year 2010 insofar\n\n as paragraph-9, the word \"contractual employee\" has been\n\n substituted to the extent of only \"adhoc employees\". Since the\n\n members of the respondents are not adhoc employees and they\n\n cannot claim any service benefits towards the M.A.C.P. benefits.\n\n 7. In support of the aforementioned contentions,\n\n the learned counsel for the appellants relied on two decisions of\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court, namely, (2022) 2 Supreme Court\n\n Cases 25 {Union of India and others Versus N. Murugesan\n\n and others (paragraphs-25, 26 and 27.2)} and (2018) 9\n\n Supreme Court Cases 293 {K. Anbazhagan and another\n\n Versus Registrar General, High Court of Madras and\n\n another (paragraphs-32, 34 and 36)}.\n\n 8. It is further submitted that the learned Single\n\n Judge has not appreciated to the extent that the members of the\n\n respondents have not questioned the validity of certain\n\n conditions stipulated in the order of the regularization dated\n\n 31.03.2015 and so also has not apprised applicability of\n\n M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules 2010 read with modified on\n\n 27.05.2013 to the extent of replacing of certain words in\n\n paragraph-9 of M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules 2010. It is also\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 9/28\n\n submitted that the learned Single Judge has taken note of the\n\n decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Central\n\n Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Another\n\n Versus Brojo Nath Ganguly and Another {(1986) 3 SCC 156}\n\n to extend benefits to the respondents. The cited decision has no\n\n assistance to the respondents in the backdrop of regularization\n\n order and its condition read with eligibility clause in the\n\n M.A.C.P. Scheme. There is no challenge to the conditions\n\n stipulated in the order of regularization and so also Para-9 to the\n\n M.A.C.P. It is further submitted that the factual aspect of the\n\n matter is required to be taken note of read with the decision of\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court. To that effect, the learned Single\n\n Judge has committed error in extending relief to the members of\n\n the respondents.\n\n 9. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents\n\n submitted that there is no error committed by the learned Single\n\n Judge. He has relied on clause-9 of the regularization order\n\n dated 31.03.2015. It is further submitted that modified M.A.C.P.\n\n notification or letter dated 27.05.2013 which is restricted to the\n\n word \"adhoc\" while substituting \"adhoc and contractual\n\n employee\". Contractual employees would also fall under the\n\n definition of adhoc employees. Therefore, the members of the\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 10/28\n\n respondents are entitled to have the benefit of counting their\n\n contractual service from 13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 towards\n\n grant of M.A.C.P. benefits. Hence, there is no infirmity in the\n\n order of the learned Single Judge so as to interfere and L.P.A. is\n\n liable to be rejected while affirming the order of the learned\n\n Single Judge.\n\n 10. Heard the learned counsels for the respective\n\n parties.\n\n 11. Members of the respondents were appointed\n\n on contract basis to various posts on 13.12.2006 and their\n\n services were regularized on 31.03.2015 with the conditions\n\n stipulated cited supra. The respondents have not questioned the\n\n validity of certain conditions imposed in the order of the\n\n regularization in particularly condition nos.(vii), (viii) and (ix) a\n\n and so also their regularization is prospective in nature, i.e., with\n\n effect from 31.03.2015 and they were regular holder of the\n\n various posts only with effect from 31.03.2015. In other words,\n\n they were holders of substantive post w.e.f. 31.03.2015. For the\n\n purpose of extending M.A.C.P. benefits or any other service\n\n benefits, such service is required to be taken only in respect of\n\n regular service rendered by an employee. In the present case,\n\n contractual service from 13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 cannot be\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 11/28\n\n counted for the purpose of extending any service benefits. In the\n\n light of conditions imposed in the order of regularization and\n\n Para-9 of M.A.C.P. Scheme. It is to be noted that service\n\n conditions ordinarily notified under \nArticle 309\n of the\n\n Constitution of India and eligibility clause invariably it is for\n\n regular employee unless and until regularization order is with\n\n retrospective effect. The respondents have not questioned the\n\n terms and conditions stipulated in the order of regularization,\n\n 12. Paragraph-9 of the M.A.C.P.

Rules 2010, M.A.C.P. benefits\n\n were not extended to adhoc employees and contractual\n\n employees. By virtue of decision dated 27.05.2013, the State\n\n Government took a policy decision to the effect that such of\n\n those adhoc employees and their services could be counted for\n\n the purpose of extending M.A.C.P. under 2010 M.A.C.P.\n\n Schemes and it is crystal clear contractual employee have been\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 14/28\n\n excluded.\n\n 14. It is necessary to extract the relevant portion\n\n of the Hon'ble Supreme Court decisions cited on behalf of the\n\n appellants. Paragraphs-25, 26 and 27.2 of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court decision in the case of Union of India and others\n\n Versus N. Murugesan and others {(2022) 2 Supreme Court\n\n Cases 25} read as under:\n\n \"25. Acquiescence would mean a tacit\n or passive acceptance. It is implied\n and reluctant consent to an act. In\n other words, such an action would\n qualify a passive assent. Thus, when\n acquiescence takes place, it\n presupposes knowledge against a\n particular act. From the knowledge\n comes passive acceptance, therefore\n instead of taking any action against\n any alleged refusal to perform the\n original contract, despite adequate\n knowledge of its terms, and instead\n being allowed to continue by\n consciously ignoring it and thereafter\n proceeding further, acquiescence does\n take place. As a consequence, it\n reintroduces a new implied agreement\n between the parties. Once such a\n situation arises, it is not open to the\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 15/28\n\n party that acquiesced itself to insist\n upon the compliance of the original\n terms. Hence, what is essential, is the\n conduct of the parties. We only dealt\n with the distinction involving a mere\n acquiescence. When acquiescence is\n followed by delay, it may become\n laches. Here again, we are inclined to\n hold that the concept of acquiescence\n is to be seen on a case-to-case basis.\"\n\n Approbate and reprobate\n\n 26. These phrases are borrowed from\n the Scots law. They would only\n mean that no party can be allowed to\n accept and reject the same thing, and\n thus one cannot blow hot and cold.\n\n The principle behind the doctrine of\n election is inbuilt in the concept of\n approbate and reprobate. Once\n again, it is a principle of equity\n coming under the contours of\n common law. Therefore, he who\n knows that if he objects to an\n instrument, he will not get the\n benefit he wants cannot be allowed\n to do so while enjoying the fruits.\n\n One cannot take advantage of one\n part while rejecting the rest. A\n person cannot be allowed to have\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 16/28\n\n the benefit of an instrument while\n questioning the same. Such a party\n either has to affirm or disaffirm the\n transaction. This principle has to be\n applied with more vigour as a\n common law principle, if such a\n party actually enjoys the one part\n fully and on near completion of the\n said enjoyment, thereafter questions\n the other part. An element of fair\n play is inbuilt in this principle. It is\n also a species of estoppel dealing\n with the conduct of a party. We have\n already dealt with the provisions of\n the \nContract Act\n concerning the\n conduct of a party, and his\n presumption of knowledge while\n confirming an offer through his\n acceptance unconditionally.\n\n \n27.2. \nState of Punjab v. Dhanjit\n Singh Sandhu\n (2014) 15 SCC 144] :\n\n (SCC pp. 153-54, paras 22-23 &\n 25-26)\n\n \"22. The doctrine of \"approbate\n and reprobate\" is only a species of\n estoppel, it implies only to the\n conduct of parties. As in the case of\n estoppel it cannot operate against\n the provisions of a statute. (Vide\n CIT v. MR. P. Firm Muar [CIT v.\n\n MR. P. Firm Muar, AIR 1965 SC\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 17/28\n\n 1216] .)\n\n 23. It is settled proposition of law\n that once an order has been passed,\n it is complied with, accepted by\n the other party and derived the\n benefit out of it, he cannot\n challenge it on any ground. (Vide\n Maharashtra SRTC v. Balwant\n Regular Motor Service\n [Maharashtra SRTC v. Balwant\n Regular Motor Service, AIR 1969\n SC 329] .) In R.N. Gosain v.\n\n Yashpal Dhir [R.N. Gosain v.\n\n Yashpal Dhir, (1992) 4 SCC 683]\n this Court has observed as under :\n\n \n(R.N. Gosain case [\nR.N. Gosain v.\n Yashpal Dhir\n, (1992) 4 SCC 683] ,\n SCC pp. 687-88, para 10)\n '10. Law does not permit a person\n to both approbate and reprobate.\n This principle is based on the\n doctrine of election which\n postulates that no party can accept\n and reject the same instrument and\n that 'a person cannot say at one\n time that a transaction is valid and\n thereby obtain some advantage, to\n which he could only be entitled on\n the footing that it is valid, and then\n turn round and say it is void for the\n purpose of securing some other\n advantage'.'\n * * *\n\n \n25. The Supreme Court in\n Rajasthan State Industrial\n Development & Investment\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 18/28\n\nCorpn. v. Diamond & Gem\n Development Corpn. Ltd\n.\n\n \n[\nRajasthan State Industrial\n Development & Investment\n Corpn. v. Diamond & Gem\n Development Corpn. Ltd.\n, (2013)\n 5 SCC 470 : (2013) 3 SCC (Civ)\n 153] , made an observation that a\n party cannot be permitted to\n \"blow hot and cold\", \"fast and\n loose\" or \"approbate and\n reprobate\". Where one knowingly\n accepts the benefits of a contract\n or conveyance or an order, is\n estopped to deny the validity or\n binding effect on him of such\n contract or conveyance or order.\n This rule is applied to do equity,\n however, it must not be applied in\n a manner as to violate the\n principles of right and good\n conscience.\n\n 26. It is evident that the doctrine\n of election is based on the rule of\n estoppel, the principle that one\n cannot approbate and reprobate is\n inherent in it. The doctrine of\n estoppel by election is one among\n the species of estoppel in pais (or\n equitable estoppel), which is a\n rule of equity. By this law, a\n person may be precluded, by way\n of his actions, or conduct, or\n silence when he has to speak,\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 19/28\n\n from asserting a right which he\n would have otherwise had.\"\n\n 15. Paragraphs 32, 34 and 36 of the Supreme\n\n Court decision in the case of K. Anbazhagan and another\n\n Versus Registrar General, High Court of Madras and\n\n another {(2018) 9 Supreme Court Cases 293} read as under:\n\n \"32. By Direction 10(16), this\n Court had directed the State\n Governments to ensure\n compliance, hence, the terms and\n conditions of service of the\n appellants were same as those\n other judicial officers of the State\n as per order of this Court. The\n High Court in its judgment\n although observed that Fast Track\n Courts cannot be said to have\n been created in \"pensionable\n establishment\" but the said\n conclusion has been arrived at\n without considering relevant\n materials and without giving any\n cogent reasons. We thus are of the\n view that appointment of the\n appellants was in \"pensionable\n establishment\".\n\n 34. In service jurisprudence, the\n appointments are made by the\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 20/28\n\n employer with different\n nomenclature/characteristics.\n\n Appointments are made both on\n permanent or temporary basis\n against permanent post or\n temporary post. The appointment\n can also be made on ad hoc basis\n on permanent or temporary post.\n\n There is one common feature of\n appointments of permanent,\n temporary or ad hoc appointment\n i.e. those appointments are made\n against the post whether\n permanent or temporary. On the\n contrary, for contractual\n appointment, there is no\n requirement of existence of any\n post. A contractual appointment\n is not normally made against a\n post. Further, contractual\n appointments are also not\n normally on pay scale. On the\n mere fact that the advertisement\n as well as the appointment was\n made initially for a period of five\n years, the nature of appointment\n of the appellants cannot be\n termed as contractual\n appointment. When a\n government servant is\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 21/28\n\n contemplated to hold a certain\n post for a limited period it is a\n tenure post.\n\n 36. The fact that the\n advertisement limited the\n appointment for a period of five\n years only because the posts were\n contemplated for five years only,\n the appointment of the appellants\n at best can be said as \"tenure\n appointment\". Although\n temporary, ad hoc and\n contractual appointments are\n used in contradiction to a regular\n and permanent appointment but\n between ad hoc appointment and\n contract appointment, distinction\n is there in service jurisprudence\n and both the expressions cannot\n be interchangeably used. When\n the advertisement against which\n the appellants were appointed\n and the appointment order\n mentions the appointment as ad\n hoc appointment, we cannot\n approve the view of the High\n Court that the nature of the\n appointment of the appellants\n was only a contractual\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 22/28\n\n appointment.\n\n \n16. (2018) 9 Supreme Court Cases 293 {K.\n\n Anbazhagan and another Versus Registrar General, High\n\n Court of Madras and another} decision has some bearing and\n\n its supports the argument of the learned counsel for the\n\n appellants insofar as distinguishing contractual employee and\n\n regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court distinguished\n\n adhoc employee and regular employee in the case of \nState of\n\n Karnataka and Others vs. Uma Devi\n reported in (2006) 4\n\n SCC 1 read with full bench decision of this Court in the case of\n\n \nRam Sevak Yadav and Another vs. The State of Bihar and\n\n Others\n in C.W.J.C. Nos. 267 and 472 reported in 2013 (1)\n\n PLJR 964. Therefore, the contentions of the respondents to the\n\n effect that contractual employee could be treated as adhoc\n\n employee is impermissible.\n\n \n17. The learned Single Judge proceeded to allow\n\n the petition of the respondents with reference to decision in the\n\n case of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation\n\n Limited and another Versus Brojo Nath Ganguly and\n\n Another {(1986) 3 SCC 156}. The aforementioned decision is\n\n distinguishable to the extent that for the purpose of claim of the\n\n respondents are entitled to M.A.C.P. while counting service of\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 23/28\n\n contractual service during the intervening period from\n\n 13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 read with the conditions stipulated in\n\n the order of regularization and in not questioning Para-9 of the\n\n modified M.A.C.P. dated 27.05.2013 insofar as replacing the\n\n certain words \"adhoc and contractual employee\" in 2010\n\n M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules and restricted only to the extent of\n\n adhoc employees. The cited decision is not applicable in view\n\n of the of Hon'ble Supreme Court decision in the case of \nNair\n\n Service Society vs. Dr. T. Beermasthan\n reported in (2009) 5\n\n SCC 545. Paragraph No. 48 thereof reads as under:\n\n \"48. Several decisions have\n been cited before us by the\n respondents, but it is well\n established that judgments\n in service jurisprudence\n should be understood with\n reference to the particular\n service rules in the State\n governing that field.\n\n Reservation provisions are\n enabling provisions, and\n different State Governments\n can have different methods\n of reservation. There is no\n\n (Underline supplied)\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 24/28\n\n challenge to the Rules, and\n what is challenged is in the\n matter of application alone.\n\n \nIn our opinion the\n communal rotation has to be\n applied taking 20 vacancies\n as a block.\"\n\n 18. The principle \nlaid down in\n the\n\n aforementioned case is that before taking note of any judicial\n\n pronouncement it is for the Court to analyze the factual aspects\n\n of the matter read with the relevant rules or executive order\n\n governing particular post. In the present case, service\n\n conditions have been stipulated in the order of regularization. If\n\n there are any arbitrariness in the condition stipulated in the order\n\n of regularization, the respondents have failed to question the\n\n same. Further, they have failed to question modified M.A.C.P.\n\n dated 27.05.2013 insofar as replacing certain words in\n\n paragraph-9 of M.A.C.P. 2010 Schemes and it is beneficial to\n\n only ad hoc employee and not to contractual employee.\n\n \n19. Taking note of these factual aspects as well\n\n as the principle \nlaid down by\n the various judicial\n\n pronouncements that at no point of time, contractual employees\n\n services could be counted for service benefits unless and until\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 25/28\n\n regularization order stipulates that regular employees is entitled\n\n to count contractual service towards other service benefits.\n\n Whereas in terms of conditions in the regularization order dated\n\n 31.03.2015, Respondents are not entitled to count contractual\n\n service towards M.A.C.P. benefits.\n\n 20. In the present case, in fact, conditions\n\n stipulated in the order of the regularization is disadvantage to\n\n the respondents' members. In other words, whatever the service\n\n benefits which were to be given to the regular employee like the\n\n members of the respondents are with prospective effect, namely,\n\n with effect from 31.03.2015, the date on which their services\n\n were regularized.\n\n \n21. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\n \nDirector General, Doordarshan Prasar Bharti Corporation\n\n of India and Anr. Vs. Smt. Magi H Desai-2023 Live Law\n\n (SC\n) 248 in paragraphs-5 and 9 it is held as under:\n\n \"5. We have heard learned counsel for the\n respective parties at length.\n\n At the outset, it is required to be noted and it\n is an admitted position that for the period\n between 1985 till 31.03.1995 the respondent\n served as a casual/contractual employee and\n her services came to be regularised as per the\n Scheme w.e.f. 31.03.1995. As such, under\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 26/28\n\n the Scheme of Regularisation, there is no\n mention that the casual services shall be\n counted towards service benefits/ pensionary\n benefits. Even as per the clarification issued\n by the DOPT in the year 2009, it was\n clarified that such appointee is not entitled to\n claim any benefit out of the services\n rendered by him/her on contractual basis\n before he/she was appointed on regular basis\n on a government post.\n\n 9. Now so far as the submission on behalf of\n the respondent that in other departments\n under the scheme the employees of such\n departments are entitled to their services\n rendered as casual/contractual counted for\n qualifying service for pensionary/service\n benefits is concerned, merely because some\n other departments might have such schemes,\n the respondent shall not be entitled to the\n same benefit in absence of any scheme in the\n appellants' department/ department in which\n the respondent rendered her services. The\n appellant - Doordarshan Prasar Bharti\n Corporation of India is an autonomous\n independent department/body. As observed\n hereinabove, neither the rule nor the\n regularisation scheme provide that services\n rendered as casual/contractual shall be\n treated as temporary service and/or the same\n shall be counted for the purposes of\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 27/28\n\n pensionary/ service benefits.\"\n\n In the case of K. Anbazhagan and another cited\n\n Supra in paragraph 34 aptly applicable to the present case.\n\n 22. Adhoc/contractual employee means an\n\n employee, whose services have been engaged for specific\n\n purpose and for specific period or for work essentially\n\n temporarily in nature. Further, adhoc means appointment for a\n\n particular job for adhoc or temporarily employee. The adhoc\n\n appointments are not contractual. Such a distinction has been\n\n made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.\n\n Anbazhagan and another cited Supra decided on 13.08.2018.\n\n In the cited decision, it is observed that although temporary,\n\n adhoc and contractual appointment are used in contradiction to a\n\n regular and permanent appointment but between adhoc and\n\n contract appointment, distinction is there in service\n\n jurisprudence and both the expressions cannot be\n\n interchangeably used.\n\n 23. Contractual employees whose services are\n\n regularized on the basis of past temporary service, shall not be\n\n entitled to any other benefits from the original date of his\n\n joining on contractual basis or from any other retrospective date\n\n as is evident from the conditions stipulated in the order of\n Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n 28/28\n\n regularization dated 31.05.2015. As long as those conditions are\n\n not questioned before competent forum and such conditions are\n\n set aside in such an event only the respondents are entitled to\n\n have certain benefits with reference to past contractual service.\n\n As on this day whatever the terms and conditions stipulated in\n\n the order of regularization dated 31.03.2015 are intact,\n\n therefore, the learned Single Judge has committed error in\n\n allowing the writ petition.\n\n 24. Accordingly, the appellants have made out a\n\n case so as to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge\n\n dated 07.08.2019 and it is set aside while rejecting C.W.J.C.\n\n No.13542 of 2019.\n\n 25. The present L.P.A. stands allowed.\n\n (P. B. Bajanthri, J)\n\n ( Ramesh Chand Malviya, J)\n\nP.S./-\n\nAFR/NAFR A.F.R\nCAV DATE N.A\nUploading Date 20.02.2024\nTransmission Date N.A",
