Relaxation in setbacks, height of floors\n\nand building etc. may be allowed in Government\nprojects in the public interest. In case of private\nconstruction/projects relaxation in setbacks,\n\nheight of floors and building etc. may be\nconsidered by the Competent Authority keeping\nin view the site conditions. However, in private\n\nprojects having plot area of more than one\n\nhectare, relaxation shall be allowed by the State\nGovernment only.\n\nAccording to the Technical Committee, after\n\nexamining the technical and legal aspects of the case, it was\n\nfound that the case of the petitioner for proposed construction\n\nof retail outlet pump as stated above is a public utility and is\n\nlocated in Non-Core Area of Shimla Planning Area.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee also found that the construction\n\nproposed is not in relation to building construction but only for\n\nthe development of land/site in question and, therefore,\n\nfollowing two relaxations are required in the instant case:-\n\ni. Hill cutting beyond permissible limits of 3.50 mtrs.\n\nii. Relaxation in overall slope of the site from 52\n\ndegrees to 45 degrees.\n\nAs regards the first relaxation, it is not in dispute that\n\nonly application for sanctioning of plans for construction are\n\nrequired to be submitted to the concerned department, which\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:37 :::CIS\n\nin turn shall then ensure that no construction activity takes\n\nplace where the slope is more than 45 degrees/35 degrees.\n\n.\n\nAs regards the second relaxation, the proposal for retail\n\npetrol pump outlet is to be constructed in and around 20\n\nmetres of the total plot area and this condition is duly fulfilled\n\nby the petitioner. Once that be so, obviously, the slope where\n\nthe construction is proposed will naturally be less than 45\n\ndegrees once the hill cutting is carried out.\n\nIn such circumstances, we direct the respondents to\n\nconsider the case of the petitioner for relaxation as aforesaid\n\nwithin a period of two weeks from today.\n\nFor compliance to come up on 23.5.2022.\n\n(Tarlok Singh Chauhan)\n\nJudge\n\n(Chander Bhusan Barowalia)\nJudge\n\n2.5.2022\n(mamta/himani)\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:37 :::CIS\n\nM/s.\nAPJ Laboratories Vs.

P. Chauhan, Advocate, for the respondent.\n\n.\n\n(Through Video Conferencing)\n\nNotice. Mr. P. P. Chauhan, Advocate, appears and\n\nwaives service of notice on behalf of the respondent.\n\nIt is rather shocking to note that even though the\n\npetition filed by the respondent herein was for restitution of\n\nconjugal rights and even the judgment that was rendered by\n\nthe learned court below is to this effect.\n\nHowever, perusal of the decree accompanying the\n\njudgment, would show that the petition has been accepted and\n\nthe marriage between the parties has been dissolved by a\n\ndecree of divorce on the ground of cruelty, which obviously is\n\nnot in accordance with either prayer made in the petition or\n\nfindings rendered by the learned court below in the judgment\n\nitself.\n\nIt is more than settled that the decree follows the\n\njudgment. Therefore, let notice be issued to the official/officer,\n\nwho has drawn the decree in question to explain his conduct.\n\nSince the instant appeal emanates out of a\n\nmatrimonial discord, therefore, let both the parties appear\n\nbefore this Court on the next date of hearing.\n\nList on 12.7.2021.\n\n(Tarlok Singh Chauhan)\nJudge\n\n(Satyen Vaidya)\nJudge\n6.7.2021\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:39 :::CIS\n\n(pankaj)\n\n.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:39 :::CIS\n\nFAO No. 27/2021\n\n6.7.2021 Present: Mr. Kulwant Singh Gill, Advocate, for the\nappellant.\n\n.\n\nMr. Ashok Sharma, A.G. with Mr. Vinod Thakur,\nMr. Hemanshu Misra, Mr. Shiv Pal Minhans, Addl.\nA.Gs., Mr. J.
