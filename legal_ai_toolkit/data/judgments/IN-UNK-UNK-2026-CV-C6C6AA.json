TO JUDGE.\n\nPrv.\n\f\n\n S.S.SATHEESACHANDRAN,J.\n ================================\n Crl.M.C.No.1466 OF 2013\n ================================\n\n Dated this the 3rd day of June,2013\n\n ORDER\n\n Petitioner is the de facto complainant in\n\nCrime No.868/2011 of Kuruppampady Police\n\nStation registered for the offence punishable\n\nunder \nsection 498A\n IPC. She has filed the\n\nabove petition for cancellation of the bail\n\ngranted to the first respondent (first accused)\n\nin the above crime, by Annexure A order dated\n\n7.9.2011 by the Judicial First Class\n\nMagistrate, Perumbavoor. First respondent had\n\nviolated the conditions on which bail was\n\ngranted by the Magistrate is the case of\n\npetitioner for cancellation of his bail, under\n\nsection 439(2) read with section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\f\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 2\n\n 2. The above petition came up for\n\nconsideration with another petition, an application\n\nfor bail moved by the first respondent\n\n(B.A.3663/2013) in another crime in which he is\n\nproceeded as one among the accused. Though\n\narguments were addressed by the respective counsel\n\nin both petitions in common the petitions have to\n\nbe disposed separately since different yardsticks\n\napply in the matter of grant of a bail and of\n\nrevoking bail already granted.\n\n 3. The present petition has been filed to\n\ncancel bail granted to the first respondent\n\nproceeded as an accused in a crime registered at\n\nthe instance of the de facto complainant.\n\nPetitioner/de facto complainant is the wife of\n\nfirst respondent. Her complaints imputing of\n\nmatrimonial cruelty by her husband and his close\n\nrelatives has led to the registration of the above\n\ncrime for the offence under \nsection 498A\n IPC. In\n\nthat crime, it is seen from Annexure A order, after\n\nnegativing the objections raised by her, which was\n\f\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 3\n\nso done filing an application setting forth the\n\ngrounds thereof, Magistrate granted bail to the\n\nfirst respondent (first accused) in the crime\n\nsubject to some conditions. Among other conditions\n\nimposed for release of first respondent on bail it\n\nwas ordered that he should not commit any offence\n\nwhile on bail. First respondent subsequently got\n\ninvolved in another crime while continuing on bail\n\nenjoyed under Annexure A order is the crux of\n\npetitioner's case to seek for cancellation of his\n\nbail. He is involved as an accused in another\n\nsessions case, the incident of which occurred even\n\nprior to the registration of the crime at the\n\ninstance of de facto complainant, with the\n\ncircumstances surrounding that case as well, and,\n\nthat of the subsequent crime registered against him\n\nafter his release on bail under Annexure A order\n\nare banked upon by petitioner to set forth a case\n\nthat bail granted to first respondent under\n\nAnnexure A order has to be cancelled.\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 4\n\n 4. After hearing the counsel on both sides at\n\nlength and looking into Annexure A order, I find\n\nwhatever circumstances surrounding the sessions\n\ncase in which the first accused is proceeded as an\n\naccused had been urged by the petitioner against\n\ngranting the first respondent bail and after\n\nconsidering the merit of such objections the\n\nMagistrate had granted him bail. Whether the first\n\nrespondent getting involved in another crime as an\n\naccused, after getting bail under Annexure-1 order,\n\nas such would tantamount to violation of one or\n\nother condition imposed for his bail by Magistrate\n\nhas to be considered. The second crime was\n\nregistered over an incident which occurred in the\n\ncourt hall of Family Court, Ernakulam. Admittedly,\n\nthe relationship of de facto complainant and her\n\nhusband (first respondent) is too bitter and it has\n\ngiven rise to civil and criminal cases. First\n\nrespondent has filed a petition for divorce, which\n\nis stated to be pending consideration. Over the\n\ncustody of a child born out of the wedlock of the\n\f\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 5\n\nspouses interim orders passed are in force, and on\n\nthe day fixed for handing over the custody of child\n\nto the first respondent (father) he came to the\n\nfamily court with his sister and mother. That day\n\nthe incident giving rise to the second crime\n\noccurred in which the father of de facto\n\ncomplainant is alleged to have been assaulted by\n\nthe first respondent and his sister. Further\n\nallegation is that first respondent has stabbed him\n\nwith a pen knife and caused him severe injuries.\n\nAfter going through the report collected from the\n\njudge of the family court with respect to the\n\nincident which occurred in the court hall and also\n\nthe Case Diary and also considering the submissions\n\nmade by the counsel on both sides and also hearing\n\nthe counsel for the de facto complainant in the\n\nabove crime who got impleaded as addl respondent I\n\nhave disposed of the application for bail moved by\n\nthe first respondent proceeded as one of the\n\naccused in that crime granting him bail subject to\n\nconditions.\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 6\n\n 5. Though learned counsel appearing for\n\npetitioner (de facto complainant) referred to\n\nvarious observations made by this court in some of\n\nthe proceedings wherein first respondent is\n\nproceeded as accused in one or other crime such\n\nobservations cannot have any impact in adjudging\n\nthe merit of the case canvassed for revoking bail\n\nalready granted to him. He did not appear before\n\nthe Sessions Judge for his questioning under\n\nsection 313\n Cr.P.C in the pending sessions case and\n\nthat in the matrimonial appeal this Court had\n\ngiven a direction that he should not carry arms\n\nwhen he appear before the family court, but it was\n\nviolated as seen from the incident in the second\n\ncrime are highlighted to press the petition.\n\nThere should be proof that the accused has misused\n\nor abused the freedom during the bail. Report sent\n\nby the Judge, Family Court prima facie indicate\n\nthat when the first respondent's sister, allegedly,\n\nabused the father of petitioner at the court hall\n\nhe slapped her and then first respondent intervened\n\f\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 7\n\nand both he and his sister assaulted the father of\n\npetitioner. Having regard to that report and\n\ntaking note of the parameters in adjudging a bail\n\napplication with other circumstances presented\n\nafter perusal of the Case Diary in that crime I\n\nhave granted bail to the first respondent subject\n\nto some conditions. When that be so, his\n\ninvolvement in the subsequent crime cannot be set\n\nforth as a ground enabling the petitioner to seek\n\nfor cancellation of bail granted in a previous\n\ncase. Consideration over cancellation of bail is\n\ndifferent from those of granting bail to an accused\n\nperson. Where there is reason to hold that the\n\nliberty granted by bail has been abused it can be\n\nrevoked. Normally, in a case of this nature where\n\nMagistrate has granted bail that too after giving\n\nan opportunity of hearing to petitioner de facto\n\ncomplainant) who intervened and opposed the\n\napplication for bail filing separate petition,\n\nnothing prevented her from moving the Magistrate\n\nfor cancellation if she has sufficient ground to do\n\f\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 8\n\nso. It goes without saying an opportunity has to\n\nbe afforded to the accused already released on bail\n\nbefore his bail is cancelled. Violation of facts\n\nimputing abusing of0 his freedom while on bail is\n\nto be affirmed by the person seeking cancellation\n\nof bail providing an opportunity to the accused to\n\ncontrovert it, if he disputed such allegations,\n\nfiling a counter affidavit. Petitioner has\n\nevidently filed this petition before this court to\n\nrender support to the opposition raised by the de\n\nfacto complainant (her father) in opposing the bail\n\nsought by first petitioner in the crime registered\n\nover the incident which occurred in the family\n\ncourt. Though there may be strong suspicious\n\ncircumstance to show the culpability of the first\n\nrespondent in mounting a conjoint assault with his\n\nsister on petitioner's father at the family court,\n\nat this stage, when investigation of the crime\n\nregistered thereof is pending, I find it cannot be\n\njustifiably considered as a circumstance to revoke\n\nthe bail granted to first respondent in another\n\f\n\nCrl.M.C.1466/2013 9\n\ncrime. I find petitioner has not made out a case\n\nfor cancelling the bail granted to the first\n\nrespondent under Annexure A order. Petition is\n\ndismissed.\n\n S.S.SATHEESACHANDRAN\n JUDGE\n\ntpl/-",
