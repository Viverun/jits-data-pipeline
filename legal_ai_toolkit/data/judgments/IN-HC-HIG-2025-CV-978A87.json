A. Choudhury, Advocate\n\nFor Respondent : Mr. A. Dhar, Advocate\n\nDate of Judgment : 01.04.2025\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 1\nBEFORE\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MRIDUL KUMAR KALITA\nJUDGMENT\n\n(MRIDUL KUMAR KALITA, J)\n\n1. Heard Mr. M. A. Choudhury, the learned counsel for the\nappellant. Also heard Mr. A. Dhar, the learned counsel for the\nrespondent.\n\n2. This appeal under\nSection 28\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955\nhas been preferred by the appellant/husband Shri Ashok\nGanguly, impugning the judgment dated 11.02.2021 passed\nby the Court of the learned District Judge, Karimganj, in Title\nSuit (D) No. 81/2014, whereby the Trial Court dismissed the\ndivorce suit filed by the appellant for a decree of divorce\nagainst the respondent.\n\n3. The facts relevant for consideration of the instant matrimonial\nappeal, in brief, are that the appellant/husband had filed a\ndivorce suit before the Court of the learned District Judge,\nKarimganj against the respondent/wife, Smti Sima Ganguly\nunder\nSection 13\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for a\ndecree of divorce and alternatively for a decree for judicial\nseparation on the grounds of cruelty and desertion.\n\n4. In the plaint filed by the appellant/husband before the Trial\nCourt, it was averred that the respondent is the legally\nmarried wife of the appellant and their marriage was\nsolemnized on 11.10.2004 at Kancha Kanti Temple, Silchar\naccording to Hindu rites and rituals. After their marriage, both\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 2\nthe parties cohabited as husband and wife at Badarpur\nRailway GRP Colony, i.e., the place where the appellant was\nworking at that time. Out of their wedlock, a girl child was\nborn (Annapurna Ganguly), who was about 10(ten) years of\nage when the divorce suit was filed by the appellant. The\nappellant had pleaded in his plaint that after the marriage,\nthe respondent used to frequently go to her paternal house\nand used to live with them and the parents of the respondent\nused to interfere in the matrimonial life of the parties, which\ncaused matrimonial discord amongst the appellant and the\nrespondent.\n\n5. The appellant has stated in his plaint that on 29.08.2006, the\nrespondent, on the instigation of her parents, instituted a\ncriminal case under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code,\nwhich was registered as G.R. Case No. 771/2006. In the said\ncase, the appellant was arrested and was detained in jail\ncustody. It was further stated by the appellant that ultimately\nthe appellant was acquitted by the Trial Court in the said case\nby its judgment dated 26.02.2014.\n\n6. It was also alleged that due to filing of the false case, the\nmatrimonial relationship between the parties deteriorated.\nAfter his release from jail custody, the appellant was\ntransferred to Baksa and since 29.08.2006 there is no\nmatrimonial relationship between the appellant and the\nrespondent. It was further averred in the plaint, by the\nappellant/husband that he tried his level best to resolve the\nmatrimonial dispute and asked the respondent to come to his\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 3\nplace but she paid no heed to the same. In the meanwhile,\nthe respondent also filed a case under\nSection 125\nof the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which was registered as\nMisc. Case No. 236/2006, where she claimed for monthly\nmaintenance allowance for her as well as for her daughter\nfrom the appellant.\n\n7. It is pertinent to mention herein that the appellant also has a\nson, from his earlier marriage, namely, Abhinandan Ganguly,\nwho was aged about 19(nineteen) years when the divorce\nsuit was filed. It was after the death of his first wife, that the\nappellant married the present respondent.\n\n8. The respondent/wife contested the divorce suit by filing\nwritten statement, wherein apart from making usual defence\npleas, she has stated that the appellant/husband had a\ndoubtful relationship with one Sathi Das, who was the maid\nservant of the appellant working in his house and when the\nrespondent protested against such illicit relationship of the\nappellant, she was subjected to physical abuse.\n\n9. It was also pleaded in her written statement that in respect of\nthe said issue a local meeting (Bichar) also took place,\nwherein the appellant admitted of having relationship with the\nsaid lady and assured not to continue the same or to assault\nthe respondent. However, in spite of such assurance, he\ncontinued to do so. It was also stated by the respondent in\nher written statement that again when the respondent\nprotested against the extra marital relationship of the\nappellant on 28.08.2006, the appellant tried to pour kerosene\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 4\nand burn the respondent. However, due to intervention of the\nneighboring people, she could be saved. On the following day\ni.e., on 29.08.2006, the respondent lodged an FIR before the\nBadarpur Police Station, which was registered as Badarpur\nP. S. Case No. 113/2006.\n\n10. It was further stated in her written statement, by the\nrespondent that after filing of the aforesaid G. R. Case, there\nwas an endeavor for amicable settlement and the appellant\napproached the respondent through well-wishers for the\namicable settlement of their matrimonial dispute and\naccordingly, the respondent filed a \"no objection\" before the\nCourt for bail of the appellant and as such, bail was granted\nto him.\n\n11. However, even after getting bail the appellant did not take\nany step for starting the matrimonial relationship again. The\nrespondent also contended that as she did not state anything\nagainst the appellant in the pending case under\nSection 498A\n\nof the Indian Penal Code, the appellant was acquitted in the\nsaid case. She has also stated that there are no ingredients of\ncruelty as well as desertion in the petition filed under\nSection\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 by the appellant.\n\n12. On the basis of the pleadings filed by both the parties, the\nTrial Court framed the following issues:\n\n(i) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to get a decree of\ndivorce as prayed for? ;\n\n(ii) What other relief/reliefs is the plaintiff entitled?\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 5\n\n13. In support of his case, the appellant/husband examined\nhimself as PW-1 and one Johar Kanti Mazumdar as PW-2. On\nthe other hand, the respondent/wife examined herself as DW-\n\n1 and one Smt. Dipti Choudhury as DW-2.\n\n14. However, after considering the evidence adducted by both the\nsides as well as after considering the submissions of the\nlearned counsel for both the sides, the Trial Court decided\nboth the issues against the appellant/husband and dismissed\nthe divorce suit filed by him.\n\n15. Mr. M. A. Choudhury, the learned counsel for the appellant\nhas submitted that the Trial Court erred in dismissing the\ndivorce suit filed by the appellant on the ground that it found\nno evidence of physical cruelty as well as desertion by the\nrespondent. He submits that the Trial Court failed to take into\nconsideration the fact that by filing a false criminal case\nagainst the appellant, the respondent subjected him to mental\ncruelty.\n\n16. He submits that the Trial Court was wrong in coming to the\nfinding that the appellant was acquitted in the G.R. Case No.\n771/2006 only because of the fact that a \"no objection\" was\nfiled by the respondent to the bail application for the\nappellant and the said factor influenced the decision of the\nCourt while acquitting the appellant.\n\n17. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Trial\nCourt failed to take into consideration the fact that in G. R.\nCase No. 771/2006, 08(eight) prosecution witnesses were\nexamined by the prosecution side including the respondent\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 6\nand as the prosecution witnesses failed to prove the charge\nagainst the appellant under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal\nCode, he was acquitted.\n\n18. He submits that compelling the appellant to undergo the\nrigours of the criminal trial, in which ultimately he got a\nverdict of acquittal, is in itself an act of mental cruelty by the\nrespondent and on that ground only the appellant was\nentitled to get a decree of divorce.\n\n19.\nIn respect of his submission, the learned counsel for the\nappellant had cited the ruling of the Apex Court in the case of\n\"\nRani Narasimha Sastry Vs. Rani Suneela Rani\n\"\n\nreported in (2020) 18 SCC 247. The learned counsel for the\nappellant had also relied upon the ruling of the Division Bench\nof this Court in the case of \"\nLalit Sinha Vs. Smti Sandhya\nSinha\n\" reported in (2022) 2 GLT 31 where the Division\nBench relying upon the above-mentioned case of \"\nRani\nNarasimha Sastry\n\" (Supra) granted the decree of divorce to\nthe husband on the ground that subjecting the appellant to\nundergo trial in which ultimately he is acquitted would be\nregarded as an act of mental cruelty by the wife.\n\n20. The learned counsel for the appellant has also submitted that\nthe appellant and the respondent are living separately since\nthe year 2006 and this long separation has resulted into a\nmatrimonial discord, which is beyond repair, therefore, he\nsubmits that this long separation is in itself a ground, which\nmay also be regarded as an aspect of mental cruelty and on\nthat ground also the appellant is entitled to get the decree of\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 7\ndivorce.\nIn support of his submission, the learned counsel for\nthe appellant has cited a ruling of the Apex Court in the case\nof \"\nSamar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh\n\" reported in (2007) 4\nSSC 511, wherein it was observed as follows:\n\n\"101.(xiv) Where there has been a long\nperiod of continuous separation, it may\nfairly be concluded that the matrimonial\nbond is beyond repair. The marriage\nbecomes a fiction, though supported by a\nlegal tie. By refusing to sever that tie the\nlaw in such cases does not serve the\nsanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it\nshows scant regard for the feelings and\nemotions of the parties in such like\nsituation, it may lead to cruelty.\"\n\n21. The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that in\nthe instant case, the respondent and the appellant are living\nseparately for almost 19(nineteen) years and their marriage\nhas reached beyond point of repair and these aspects were\nnot considered by the Trial Court. Hence, he submits that the\nimpugned judgment of the Trial Court is liable to be set aside\nand the respondent is entitled to get a decree of divorce on\nthe ground of mental cruelty and desertion.\n\n22. On the other hand Mr. A. Dhar, the learned counsel for the\nrespondent has submitted that the Trial Court has rightly\ndismissed the divorce suit filed by the appellant as he failed to\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 8\nprove the grounds of cruelty and desertion as pleaded by him\nin his plaint.\n\n23. The learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that\nthe appellant has mainly filed this appeal on the ground that\nthe Trial Court failed to take into consideration that the\nappellant was acquitted in the G. R. Case No. 771/2006,\nunder\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code, which was\nregistered on the basis of an FIR lodged by the present\nrespondent. However, he submits that the appellant has\nsuppressed the fact that on 31.08.2006, during the pendency\nof the Badarpur P. S. Case No. 113/2006, corresponding to\nG. R. Case No. 771/2006, the respondent filed an application,\nwhich was registered as Petition No. 7116 dated 31.08.2006,\nbefore the Court of the learned Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Karimganj, stating therein that on account of\nsome misunderstanding with her husband she lodged an FIR\nand at the intervention of the well-wishers, the matter has\nbeen resolved and she want to go with her husband and as\nsuch, the appellant was granted bail by the Court on\n31.08.2006 itself.\n\n24. The learned counsel for the respondent has further submitted\nthat on the same day i.e., 31.08.2006 itself, one Sathi Das\nclaiming himself to be the wife of the appellant also filed\nanother petition which was registered Petition No. 7112 dated\n31.08.2006 before the learned Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Karimganj, praying for bail of the appellant.\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 9\n\n25. The learned counsel for the respondent submits that filing of\nbail application by Sathi Das, wherein she claimed herself to\nbe the wife of the appellant itself shows that the allegation of\nextra-marital affair by the respondent against the appellant\nwas not without any basis.\n\n26. The learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that\nwhile acquitting the appellant in the G. R. Case No. 771/2006,\nthe Court of learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nKarimganj has observed that the prosecution side had failed\nto prove the charges beyond all reasonable doubt. It also took\ninto consideration the fact that the criminal case was filed on\naccount of some misunderstanding between the respondent\nand the appellant, therefore, he submits that it is not a case,\nwhere false accusations were made against the appellant by\nthe respondent, while filing the FIR against him.\n\n27. The learned counsel for the respondent submits that the\ncircumstances were such that the respondent was compelled\nto lodge an FIR against the appellant and in the judgment\npassed in G. R. Case No. 771/2006, the Court of learned\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karimganj did not make\nany observation that the allegations made by the informant\nare false, rather the appellant was given benefit of doubt as\nthe prosecution side failed to prove the charges beyond all\nreasonable doubt.\n\n28. The learned counsel for the respondent has also submitted\nthat after release of the appellant he was transferred to Baksa\nand there is no evidence to show that he attempted to bring\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 10\nthe respondent to her matrimonial house and therefore, the\nlearned counsel for the respondent submits that the appellant\nhas failed to show that there was any animus deserendi on\nthe part of the respondent to stay away from her husband.\n\n29. The learned counsel for the respondent has also submitted\nthat mere long separation, in itself, may not entitle the\nappellant to get a decree of divorce, unless, it is shown that\nthe respondent was at fault on some count and the appellant\nis able to prove any of the ground mentioned in\nSection 13\nof\nthe Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to get a decree of divorce.\n\n30. The learned counsel for the respondent has also referred to\nExhibit-B exhibited by the respondent before the Trial Court\nwhich is the order dated 31.08.2006 passed by the Court of\nlearned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karimganj in\nBadarpur P. S. Case No. 113/2006, which shows that one\nSathi Das had also filed an application for bail of the appellant\nAshok Ganguly claiming herself to be the wife of the\nappellant. He also submitted that from the said order itself it\nwould appear that as because the respondent submitted\nbefore the Court that the matter has been amicably settled,\nthe appellant was granted bail in that case.\n\n31. I have considered the submission made by the learned\ncounsel for both sides and have gone through the materials\non record including the records of the Title Suit (D) No.\n81/2014, which was requisitioned in connection with the\ninstant appeal.\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 11\n\n32. The appellant has assailed the impugned judgment in this\nappeal mainly on the ground that by filing the G.R. Case\nNo. 771/2006 (corresponding to Badarpur P. S. Case No.\n113/2006) under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code, the\nrespondent has subjected the appellant to mental cruelty and\nsaid fact has not been taken into consideration by the Trial\nCourt.\n\n33. The term cruelty as mentioned in\nSection 13(1)\n(i-a) of the\n\nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\nmay mean physical cruelty or\nmental cruelty.\n\n34.\nIn this regard, the observation made by the Apex Court in the\ncase of \"\nSrinivas Rao Vs. D. A. Deepa\n\" reported in (2013)\n5 SCC 226 are relevant and the same are reproduced herein\nbelow:\n\n\"10. Under\nSection 13(1)\n(i-a) of the\n\nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n, a\nmarriage can be dissolved by a\ndecree of divorce on a petition\npresented either by the husband or\nthe wife on the ground that the other\nparty has, after solemnisation of the\nmarriage, treated the petitioner with\ncruelty. In a series of judgments this\nCourt has repeatedly stated the\nmeaning and outlined the scope of\nthe term \"cruelty\". Cruelty is evident\nwhere one spouse has so treated the\nother and manifested such feelings\ntowards her or him as to cause in her\nor his mind reasonable apprehension\nthat it will be harmful or injurious to\nlive with the other spouse. Cruelty\nmay be physical or mental.\"\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 12\n\n35. However, there cannot be any fix standard to judge as to\nwhat may amount to mental cruelty. The facts of each case\nhave to be considered to ascertain whether mental cruelty\nhas been perpetrated by any of the party upon another by\nany of her or his action or inaction. Though, making\nunfounded, indecent defamatory allegations against the\nspouse by the another spouse may amount to mental cruelty.\nSimilarly, filing of criminal cases on the basis of\nunsubstantiated allegations by one of the spouse against\nanother spouse may also amount to mental cruelty.\n\n36. However, before coming to the conclusion that the\nrespondent has subjected the appellant to mental cruelty, in\nthe instant case, the facts of the case are to be examined. In\nthe instant case, the respondent had lodged an FIR against\nthe appellant alleging that she was subjected to torture by\nthe appellant and it was also alleged that the appellant is\nhaving an illicit affair with the maid of the house namely,\nSathi Das and ultimately, the appellant was acquitted of said\ncharges in G.R. Case No. 771/2006 by the Court of the\nlearned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karimganj.\n\n37. As the appellant was acquitted of the charges levelled by the\nrespondent in the criminal case, it has been projected that the\nappellant was subjected to cruelty by compelling the appellant\nto undergo trial in a case where ultimately he was acquitted.\n\n38. However, if we peruse the judgment dated 26.02.2014,\npassed by the Court of the learned Additional Chief Judicial\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 13\nMagistrate, Karimganj in G.R. Case No. 771/2006, it appears\nthat the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nKarimganj, while passing the aforesaid judgment took into\nconsideration the fact that the present respondent while\ndeposing as PW-1 in the said case has deposed during cross-\nexamination that she had filed a petition before the Court that\nmatter has been amicably settled and the case was lodged\ndue to misunderstanding.\n\n39. The present respondent, while deposing as a prosecution\nwitness in G. R. Case No. 771/2006 has deposed that her\nhusband was in the house of Sathi Das and when the\nrespondent protested to the same she was abused and\nassaulted by the appellant. The Trial Court, did not make any\ncomment regarding the truthfulness or falsity of this\ntestimony, therefore, what was deposed by the respondent\ncannot be treated as false merely because of the fact that the\nappellant was acquitted in the said case.\n\n40. It also appears that the appellant was acquitted in the said\ncase mainly because the prosecution side failed to prove that\nthere was demand of dowry by the appellant (accused). The\nallegation of demand of dowry was never made by the\npresent respondent (wife) while lodging the FIR against the\nappellant.\n\n41. It also appears that the appellant was acquitted as the\nprosecution side failed to prove the charges under\nSection\n498A\nof the Indian Penal Code beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 14\n\n42. It is pertinent to mention herein that there is no observation\nin the said judgment that the allegation made by the present\nrespondent (wife) that the appellant was found in the house\nof Sathi Das and that the appellant assaulted and tried to\npour kerosene on her is false allegation.\n\n43. Further, what is relevant in this case is that the respondent\nwhile deposing as DW-1, in the Title Suit (D) No. 81/2014,\nhas exhibited the certified copy of the order dated 31.08.2006\npassed by the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nKarimganj in Badarpur P. S. Case No. 113/2006, which shows\nthat one Sathi Das claiming herself to be the wife of the\npresent appellant also filed a bail application praying for bail\nof the appellant in the case, which was registered on the\nbasis of the FIR lodged by the present appellant. From the\naforesaid order of the learned Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Karimganj, it appears that the allegations\nregarding Sathi Das made by the present respondent in her\nevidence before the Trial Court may not be considered as\nabsolutely false allegation.\n\n44. In the rulings cited by the learned counsel for the appellant,\nthe lodging of criminal cases, on the basis of unsubstantiated\nallegation against the husband, was regarded as an act of\nmental cruelty. However, that does not mean in every case,\nwhere a case under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code\nresults into an acquittal, the act of lodging of such case by\nthe wife against the husband, would be treated as mental\ncruelty within the meaning of\nSection 13(1)\n(i-a) of the Hindu\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 15\n\nMarriage Act, 1955\n, irrespective of the facts and\ncircumstances of the said case.\n\n45. It is pertinent to note that in G.R. Case No. 771/2006, the\nappellant was tried for charges under\nSection 498A\nof the\nIndian Penal Code and he was acquitted because the\nallegation of the demand of dowry, which is required for\nproving of such charge, was not made in this case.\n\n46. As discussed hereinabove, there was no allegation regarding\ndemand of dowry by the respondent/wife against the present\nappellant/husband. The main allegation against the appellant\nwas that he was having illicit relationship with one Sathi Das\nand when the respondent objected to the same, she was\nassaulted by him.\n\n47. There is no finding in the judgment passed by the learned\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karimganj, in G. R. Case\nNo. 771/2006 that the allegation levelled against the appellant\nby the present respondent was false allegation. The appellant\nwas acquitted of the charge under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian\nPenal Code mainly due to the absence of the demand of\ndowry, which is an essential ingredient for commission of an\noffence under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\n48. In view of above, this Court is of the considered opinion that\nthe facts of the instant case are not such so that mere lodging\nof the FIR and acquittal of the appellant, on the failure to\nprove the essential ingredient of the demand of dowry, in G.\nR. Case No. 771/2006, may be regarded as an act of mental\ncruelty by the respondent, so as to grant the appellant a\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 16\ndecree of divorce under\nSection 13(1)\nof the Hindu Marriage\nAct, 1955.\n\n49. As regards, the long period of continuous separation being\nregarded as an element of mental cruelty, there is no doubt\nthat such a long period of continuous separation between the\nappellant and the husband may result in a situation where\nmatrimonial bond can be regarded as beyond repair,\nhowever, if the respondent (wife) is not found to be at fault\nfor such long separation, the said long separation, in itself,\nmay not be regarded as an act of cruelty by her.\n\n50. Further, such a long separation, in absence of animus\ndeserendi, on the part of the respondent would also not\namount to an act of her deserting the appellant. In the\ninstant case, it appear that after getting bail in G.R. Case\nNo. 771/2006, the appellant was transferred to Baksa and\nthereafter, he went to the paternal house of the respondent\nwife, where she was living, only on two occasions and there is\nno evidence to show that he made an effort to take the\nresponded with him to Baksa.\n\n51. Thus, the mere fact that the respondent and the appellant are\nliving separately since 28.08.2006, in itself, may not amount\nto desertion by the respondent, if the appellant fails to prove\nthat the respondent intended to desert him. The appellant has\nnot been able to show the animus deserendi on the part of\nthe respondent to dessert him, so as to justify the grant of\ndecree of divorce, on the ground of desertion, to the\nappellant.\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 17\n\n52. In view of the reasons mentioned and the discussions made\nin the foregoing paragraphs, this Court does not find any\ninfirmity in the conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court in the\nimpugned judgment that the appellant has failed to prove the\nground of cruelty and desertion as required under\nSection 13\n\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and rejecting the prayer for\ngrant of the decree of divorce to the appellant.\n\n53. This appeal is, therefore, found devoid of any merit and\naccordingly, same is dismissed.\n\nJUDGE\nComparing Assistant\n\nMat.App./2/2022 Page 18",
