A perusal of the record reveals that the following course of events\nhas led to the filing of the instant petition:-\n\na. The disputes and controversy that are before this Court are\nstemming out of financial relations between the husband of the\npetitioner and one Surinder Wadhwa and his associates.\nTransactions, primarily in the nature of financial loans, were being\ncarried out between the said persons to this effect by the personal\naccounts of the petitioner and her family with Surinder Wadhwa,\nhis associates and family members.\n\nb. An Agreement to Sell dated 26th October 2015 was\npurported to be executed between the petitioner and\nclaimant/respondent, an associate of Surinder Wadhwa, for sale of\nproperty bearing Mustail No. 3 Killa Nos. 21/1 (1-14), 21/2 Min\n(1-4) situated in the revenue estate of Village Jonapur, Tehsil\nMehrauli, New Delhi. The case of the petitioner is that the said\nAgreement to Sell came to her knowledge only upon receiving the\nletter dated 14th March 2017 and that she had never executed the\nsame. The petitioner denied even the existence of the said\nAgreement, through her husband.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Subsequently, a complaint dated 10th April 2017 was lodged\nwith the Joint Commissioner of Police (South), Delhi Police, by the\nhusband of the petitioner against Surinder Wadhwa against\nSurinder Wadhwa for offences of cheating, criminal conspiracy,\ncriminal breach of trust, amongst others.\n\nd. The respondent approached this Court for the appointment of\nan arbitrator for adjudication of the disputes which arose between\nthe parties seeking specific performance of the purported\nAgreement to Sell dated 26th October 2015. Accordingly, a\nCoordinate Bench of this Court in Arb. P. No. 402/2017 vide its\norder dated 2nd November 2017 appointed the learned Sole\nArbitrator.\n\ne. The arbitration proceedings were initiated amongst the\nparties and upon conclusion of the arbitration proceedings, the\nAward dated 30th September 2019 came to be passed by the learned\nArbitrator.\n\nf. The complaint lodged on by the husband of the petitioner\nagainst Surinder Wadhwa and his associates came to be registered\nas an FIR bearing No. 0027 dated 7th February 2018 for offences\nunder\nSection 420\n,\n,\n,\nand\n120B\nof the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860, during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings.\n\ng.

(COMM) 144/2020 Page 6 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\n3. The parties have advanced their arguments on the challenge to the\nArbitral Award passed by the learned Arbitrator before this Court as well\nas in their pleadings and written submissions. The sum of the arguments\nadvanced is discussed hereunder.\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the petitioner\n\n4. Mr. Arvind Varma, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf\nof the petitioner submitted that the alleged Agreement to Sell dated 26th\nOctober 2015, which has allegedly given rise to the arbitration\nproceedings in question, has never been executed by the petitioner. It is\nsubmitted that the Agreement is forged and fabricated. Therefore, the first\npart of the arguments on behalf of the petitioner is that there was no\narbitrable dispute which required the intervention of the Court or an\narbitrator.\n\n5. The objection to the existence of an Agreement has been taken by\nthe petitioner since the very beginning of the litigation between the\nparties and the was also set out in her email dated 20th March 2017 sent in\nreply to Notice issued by the respondent on 14 th March 2017. The\nobjection was noted by the Coordinate Bench of this Court while\nappointing the Arbitrator in its order dated 2nd November 2017.\nMoreover, in her Statement of Defence, the petitioner denied signing any\nAgreement to Sell.\n\n6. It is submitted that the learned Arbitrator did not give any specific\nfinding on the said issue and wrongly held that the Agreement to Sell has\nbeen executed properly without any basis or justification.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 7 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\n7. It is further submitted that the consideration which has been\npurported to be consideration for the Agreement was in fact the amount\nfor cross-loans exchanged between the parties involved. The cross-loan\ntransactions have been coloured as Agreement to Sell by the respondent.\nIt is submitted that the petitioner has a long history of financial\ntransactions with Surinder Wadhwa and his associates. Moreover, the\noriginal deeds of the property in question were handed over to the\nrespondent as security against the loan provided by him, however, in his\nStatement of Claim, the respondent stated that the original deeds were not\nhanded over.\n\n8. As per alleged Agreement to Sell, possession of the property in\nquestion was handed over to the respondent at the time of its execution\nhowever, the fact is that till date the possession of the property is being\nenjoyed by the petitioner.\n\n9. It is submitted that the learned Arbitrator did not consider that on\nthe day of the alleged execution of the Agreement between the parties the\npetitioner along with her husband had gone to Chandigarh. She has also\nproduced an independent witness, RW-3, Dr. Naresh Kaushal, who\nsupported the said averment. Further, the alleged Agreement to Sell at\nvarious spaces is hand written however same has not been counter signed\nby either party which clearly suggests that said spaces wherein are filled\nlater so as to suit the case of the respondent.\n\n10. The alleged Agreement to Sell was never registered before an\nappropriate authority under the\nRegistration Act, 1908\n, which specifically\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 8 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\nprovides for an Agreement to Sell to be necessarily registered under\n\nSection 17\n.\n\n11. It is further submitted that the testimonies of the respondent\nwitnesses are also wholly unreliable since there are significant\ncontradictions and material discrepancies in the statements of the\nwitnesses. It is submitted that CW-1 himself stated that he has had a long-\nstanding association with Surender Wadhwa. Therefore, his statement has\nno evidentiary value.\n\n12. It is further submitted that as per the alleged Agreement to Sell the\npetitioner had agreed to sell the property for a sum of Rs. 60 lakhs.\nHowever, the value of the property is more than Rs. 10 crores, which has\nbeen admitted by the respondent. The sale consideration to this effect is\nfictitious and unreasonable.\n\n13. While granting the Claim No. 1, pertaining to the specific relief of\nthe Agreement in favour of the respondent, the learned Arbitrator failed to\nconsider that specific performance is a discretionary relief. Relying upon\nthe judgment of\nOm Prakash vs. Amarjit Singh\n, 1988 Supp SCC 780,\nthe learned senior counsel submitted that\nSection 20\nof the Specific Relief\nAct, 1963 provides that the jurisdiction to decree specific performance is\ndiscretionary, and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely\nbecause it is lawful to do so, but the discretion of the Court is not\narbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by judicial principles.\n\n14. It is further submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has time and\nagain reiterated the scope of intervention by an Arbitrator in cases where\nthere are serious allegations of fraud. Learned senior counsel relied upon\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Ayyasamy vs. A. Paramasivam & Ors.\n(2016) 10 SCC 386\n\n―25 [Ed. : Para 25 corrected vide Official Corrigendum\nNo. F-3/Ed.B.J./101/2016 dated 17-7-2017.] . In view of\nour aforesaid discussions, we are of the opinion that mere\nallegation of fraud simpliciter may not be a ground to\nnullify the effect of arbitration agreement between the\nparties. It is only in those cases where the court, while\ndealing with\nSection 8\nof the Act, finds that there are very\nserious allegations of fraud which make a virtual case of\ncriminal offence or where allegations of fraud are so\ncomplicated that it becomes absolutely essential that such\ncomplex issues can be decided only by the civil court on\nthe appreciation of the voluminous evidence that needs to\nbe produced, the court can sidetrack the agreement by\ndismissing the application under\nSection 8\nand proceed\nwith the suit on merits. It can be so done also in those\ncases where there are serious allegations of\nforgery/fabrication of documents in support of the plea of\nfraud or where fraud is alleged against the arbitration\nprovision itself or is of such a nature that permeates the\nentire contract, including the agreement to arbitrate,\nmeaning thereby in those cases where fraud goes to the\nvalidity of the contract itself of the entire contract which\ncontains the arbitration clause or the validity of the\narbitration clause itself. Reverse position thereof would\nbe that where there are simple allegations of fraud\ntouching upon the internal affairs of the party inter se\nand it has no implication in the public domain, the\narbitration clause need not be avoided and the parties\ncan be relegated to arbitration. While dealing with such\nan issue in an application under\nSection 8\nof the Act, the\nfocus of the court has to be on the question as to whether\njurisdiction of the court has been ousted instead of\nfocusing on the issue as to whether the court has\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 10 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\njurisdiction or not. It has to be kept in mind that insofar\nas the statutory scheme of the Act is concerned, it does\nnot specifically exclude any category of cases as non-\narbitrable. Such categories of non-arbitrable subjects are\ncarved out by the courts, keeping in mind the principle of\ncommon law that certain disputes which are of public\nnature, etc. are not capable of adjudication and\nsettlement by arbitration and for resolution of such\ndisputes, courts i.e. public fora, are better suited than a\nprivate forum of arbitration. Therefore, the inquiry of the\nCourt, while dealing with an application under\nSection 8\n\nof the Act, should be on the aforesaid aspect viz. whether\nthe nature of dispute is such that it cannot be referred to\narbitration, even if there is an arbitration agreement\nbetween the parties. When the case of fraud is set up by\none of the parties and on that basis that party wants to\nwriggle out of that arbitration agreement, a strict and\nmeticulous inquiry into the allegations of fraud is needed\nand only when the Court is satisfied that the allegations\nare of serious and complicated nature that it would be\nmore appropriate for the Court to deal with the subject-\nmatter rather than relegating the parties to arbitration,\nthen alone such an application under\nSection 8\nshould be\nrejected.\n\nb.\nRashid Raza v. Sadaf Akhtar\n, (2019) 8 SCC 710\n\n―4. The principles of law\nlaid down in\nthis appeal make a\ndistinction between serious allegations of\nforgery/fabrication in support of the plea of fraud as\nopposed to ―simple allegations‖.\n\nTwo working tests\nlaid\ndown in\npara 25 are: (1) does this plea permeate the\nentire contract and above all, the agreement of\narbitration, rendering it void, or (2) whether the\nallegations of fraud touch upon the internal affairs of the\nparties inter se having no implication in the public\ndomain.‖\nc.\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Radhakrishnan [N. Radhakrishnan v. Maestro\nEngineers, (2010) 1 SCC 72 : (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 12]\ninter alia observing that allegations of fraud can (sic\ncannot) be made a subject-matter of arbitration when\nthey relate to a civil dispute. This is subject to the caveat\nthat fraud, which would vitiate and invalidate the\narbitration clause, is an aspect relating to non-\narbitrability.\nWe have also set aside the Full Bench\ndecision of the Delhi High Court in\nHDFC Bank Ltd.\n[HDFC Bank Ltd. v. Satpal Singh Bakshi\n, 2012 SCC\nOnLine Del 4815 : (2013) 134 DRJ 566] which holds that\nthe disputes which are to be adjudicated by the DRT\nunder the\nDRT Act\nare arbitrable. They are non-\narbitrable.\n\n82. Issue of non-arbitrability can be raised at three\nstages. First, before the court on an application for\nreference under\nSection 11\nor for stay of pending judicial\nproceedings and reference under\nSection 8\nof the\nArbitration Act; secondly, before the Arbitral Tribunal\nduring the course of the arbitration proceedings;\n\nor thirdly, before the court at the stage of the challenge to\nthe award or its enforcement. Therefore, the question --\n―Who decides non-arbitrability?‖ and, in particular, the\njurisdiction of the court at the first look stage, that is, the\nreferral stage.‖\nd.\nN.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd.\n,\n(2021) 4 SCC 379\n\n―45. The civil aspect of fraud is considered to be\narbitrable in contemporary arbitration jurisprudence,\nwith the only exception being where the allegation is that\nthe arbitration agreement itself is vitiated by fraud or\nfraudulent inducement, or the fraud goes to the validity of\nthe underlying contract, and impeaches the arbitration\nclause itself...\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

The civil aspect of fraud can be adjudicated by an\nArbitral Tribunal...‖\n\n15. Further, the second challenge to the impugned Award is that the\nAward is in conflict with the public policy of India and is also patently\nillegal. Reliance has been placed upon\nSsangyong Engineering and\nConstruction Company Limited vs. NHAI\n, (\n2019) 15 SCC 131, Patel\nEngineering Limited vs. North Eastern Electric Power Corporation\nLtd.\n, (\n2020) 7 SCC 167 and Delhi Airport Metro Express Ltd. vs. Delhi\nMetro Rail Corporation Ltd.\n, (2021) 1 SCC 131 to submit that where an\nAward suffers from patent illegality, it is liable to be set aside.\n\n16. It is submitted that a criminal complaint dated 10th April 2017 has\nalso been filed against Surinder Wadhwa and his associates, including the\ndefendant herein under\nSections 420\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\n120-B\nof the\nIndian Penal Code, 1860. The said complaint was registered as an FIR\nbearing No. 27/2018 on 7th February 2018. However, the learned\nArbitrator has not considered the same while allowing Claim No. 1 in\nfavour of the respondent and did not even discuss the criminal\nproceedings.\n\n17. It is further submitted that the learned Arbitrator granted the relief\nof specific performance of a contract in the absence of readiness and\nwillingness as stipulated under the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963\n. It is\nsubmitted that this Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in various\npronouncements categorically held that, the words \"ready\" and \"willing\"\nimply that the person was prepared to carry out the terms of the contact.\nReliance has been placed upon the judgment of\nN.P.

However, the Respondent was never ready and willing to\nsatisfy his part in accordance with the alleged Agreement to Sell dated\n26th October 2015 as Clause 2 of the alleged Agreement to Sell stipulated\nthat the respondent shall make the balance payment of Rs. 20,00,000/-\nwithin a period of six months from the date the alleged Agreement to Sell\nwas signed. It is submitted that the accounts statements of the respondent\nshow that he never processed requisite funds to make payment for the\nbalance consideration. Moreover, the specific performance is a\ndiscretionary relief which need not be necessarily granted. Therefore, the\nobservation of the learned Arbitrator regarding readiness and willingness\non the part of the respondent is erroneous.\n\n18. Therefore, it is prayed that the impugned Award be set aside.\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the respondent\n\n19. Per Contra, the learned counsel for the respondent vehemently\nopposed the instant petition and submitted that there is no error in the\nimpugned Award passed in the arbitration proceedings between the\nparties.\n\n20. The learned counsel presented the respondent's version of the facts\nand submitted that the petitioner approached the respondent, through her\nhusband Mr. Amrish Gupta, and represented that she is sole, legal and\nabsolute owner of property in question situated in revenue estate of\nVillage Jonapur, Tehsil Mehrauli, New Delhi. After due negotiations and\ndeliberations, the sale consideration amount was settled as Rs. 60 lakhs\nand it is decided between the parties that an amount of Rs. 40 lakhs would\nbe paid at the time of execution of Agreement to Sell and balance sale\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

It was also agreed\nbetween the parties that the First Party, the petitioner herein, shall get the\nmutation of the property done in favor of Second Party, the respondent\nbefore this Court. It is submitted that based upon the representations and\nassurances, the respondent agreed to enter into the Agreement to Sell with\nthe petitioner.\n\n21. It is submitted that out of total sale consideration, the part payment\nof Rs. 40 lakhs was paid through UTR No. BARBR52015102600767457\ndated 26th October 2015 through Bank of Baroda, Shalimar Bagh, New\nDelhi, by the respondent. The said Agreement was duly executed out of\nfree will and with consent of both the parties. However, the petitioner has\nraised the objection to the existence of the Agreement.\n\n22. The respondent has offered Rs. 20 lakhs to the petitioner at several\noccasions, however, the petitioner was not coming forward for the\nexecution of Agreement to Sell. The respondent has been and is still\nready and willing to pay balance sale consideration amount of Rs. 20\nlakhs to the petitioner subject to the petitioner executing the Sale Deed in\nfavor of respondent. It is submitted that the learned Arbitrator duly noted\nthe financial capacity of the respondent, pari delicto relations of the party\nand then passed the finding regarding the readiness and willingness to\nperform.\n\n23.

Therefore, the observation\nof the learned Arbitrator after due consideration of the validity of\nAgreement for specific performance of the Agreement was in accordance\nwith the law as well as facts of the case.\n\n24. The Clause 15 of the Agreement to Sell stipulates an Arbitration\nClause and provides that in case of any dispute arising out of or in\nconnection with this agreement, the same shall be referred to sole\nArbitration of Mr. Vineet Malhotra. Accordingly, when the dispute\nregarding remaining consideration amount arose, the respondent invoked\nthe Arbitration Clause and sought to initiate arbitration proceedings.\n\n25. The petitioner raised objections qua the possession of the property.\nTo this this effect, it is submitted that though the Agreement mentions\nthat the possession/original title deed of the said property was handed\nover to the respondent, however, the correct facts are that the petitioner\nrequested for some time for handing over the possession, as the property\nhas to be surveyed by the concerned department for obtaining necessary\npermissions for NOC and believing the request of petitioner to be bona\nfide, the respondent agreed for the same and the possession of the\nproperty remained with the petitioner. The respondent was assured by the\npetitioner that she has already initiated the process of obtaining the\nnecessary permissions/NOC and will soon register the transfer document\nin favor of respondent, however, the petitioner never took the necessary\nsteps. It is submitted that the petitioner delayed the execution of the\nAgreement on one or another pretext. The petitioner also represented that\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

It is also submitted that the petitioner purchased the property in\nquestion for Rs. 28 lakhs and the consideration for the Agreement to Sell\nin question is Rs. 60 lakhs, which is more than double the purchase\namount. Therefore, there arises no objection to this issue. The issue has\nalso been discussed by the learned Arbitrator in the impugned Award.\n\n27. To the objections raised on behalf of the petitioner regarding the\nfindings of the learned Arbitrator, the learned counsel for the respondent\nsubmitted that the learned Arbitrator gave the parties were proper\nopportunity to lead their documentary as well as oral, which was duly led\nand only thereafter passed the finding granting Claim No. 1 in favour of\nthe respondent. It is submitted that the Agreement to Sell in question was\nprepared on the Stamp Paper which is in the name of the petitioner.\nMoreover, the learned Arbitrator in paragraphs no. 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32,\n34, 35 and paragraph no.

Kaushal, which was\nallowed on 4th December 2018. Dr. N.K. Kaushal was examined as RW-\n\n3. No original prescription was produced. No fee bill was examined.\nDuring the course of oral arguments as well, it was admitted by\npetitioner's counsel that the doctor was known to him. Therefore, the\npetitioner failed to establish that she was not present at the time of\nexecution of the Agreement.\n\n29. The learned Arbitrator made specific observations to this effect and\nfound that the plea was not taken at any earlier stage. To support the\nargument, the learned counsel referred to the evidence of the petitioner.\nReliance has also been placed on the judgment passed in Mohinder Singh\nvs. State, AIR 1953 SC 415 whereby the Hon'ble Supreme Court held\nthat the standard of proof required in regard to a plea of alibi must be the\nsame as the standard applied to the prosecution evidence and in both\ncases it should be a beyond reasonable doubt.\nFurther, in\nLakhan Singh\n@ Pappu vs. the State of NCT of Delhi, Crl Appeal No.\n166/1999, this\nCourt held that the plea of alibi cannot be equated with a plea of self-\ndefence and ought to be taken at the first instance and not belatedly at the\nstage of defence evidence. In any case, the appellant/accused gives no\nreason or explanations for not taking this plea of alibi at the earliest\nopportunity. Therefore, there is no force in the argument of the petitioner\nto this effect.\n\n30.

Moreover, the Bank Account\nStatement or the Financial Statements of the petitioner herein do not\ndisplay any repayment of loan or any payment of interest on loan and\nmoreover, if the same has been treated as a loan transaction by the\npetitioner, then due diligence under\nSection 194A\nof Income Tax Act,\n1961 has not been made.\n\n31. The learned counsel submitted the scope of enquiry in the\nproceedings under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is restricted to a\nconsideration whether any of the grounds mentioned in\nSection 34(2)\nor\n\nSection 13(5)\nor\nSection 16(6)\nof the Act are made out to set aside the\naward. The grounds for setting aside the award are specific. It is\nimperative for expeditious disposal of cases under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act be decided only with reference to the pleadings and the\nevidence placed before the arbitral tribunal and the limited grounds\nspecified under\nSection 34(2)\nof the Act.\n\n32. In the present case, the petitioner has failed to raise and establish\ngrounds as enumerated under\nSection 34(2)\nof the Arbitration Act. The\nAward is a well-reasoned and speaking Award not warranting any\ninterference from this Court. Therefore, the instant petition is liable to be\ndismissed for being devoid of merit.\n\n33.

The petitioner has assailed the Award dated 30th September 2019\npassed by the learned Arbitrator, which has been thoroughly perused and\nconsidered by this Court. After hearing the parties at length and perusing\nthe record, this Court deems it necessary to narrow down the controversy\nand dispute between the parties to the following questions:-\n\nI. What is the scope of the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator as well as\nof the interference of this Court while adjudicating a petition under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nII. Whether the learned Arbitrator has considered the objections\nraised on behalf of the petitioner regarding the execution of the\nAgreement to Sell while considering the grant of relief of specific\nperformance.\n\nIII. Whether the grounds stipulated under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act have been satisfied to set aside the impugned\nAward in the instant matter.\n\nAccordingly, this Court shall delve into the adjudication upon the\naforesaid issues.\n\nISSUE NO. I\n\nSpirit of the Arbitration Act\n\n35. Before adjudicating upon the merits of the case, it is essential to\nrecapitulate the idea, purpose, goal and objective of the\nArbitration Act\nas\nwell as\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act to understand the implications\nthe provisions therein have on the powers and jurisdiction of this Court.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 20 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\n36.\nThe Arbitration Act\nwas enacted for providing a mechanism to the\npublic to resolve their disputes in a process less rigorous, technical and\nformal than that of a litigation. It has proven to be easier, more accessible,\nefficient and even cost effective for the parties involved, whether at an\nindividual level or at the level of a business or corporation. The\nalternative dispute mechanism is not only advantageous for the people\ninvolved in disputes but has also been aiding the effective disposal and\nrelease of burden on the Courts of the Country. The parties have a more\nhands-on involvement in an Arbitration process and play an active role in\nthe adjudication process.\n\n37. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nUnion of India vs. Varindera\nConstructions Ltd.\n, (2018) 7 SCC 794, while discussing the object of\narbitration held as under:-\n\n―12. The primary object of the arbitration is to reach a final\ndisposition in a speedy, effective, inexpensive and expeditious\nmanner. In order to regulate the law regarding arbitration,\nlegislature came up with legislation which is known as\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n. In order to make\narbitration process more effective, the legislature restricted\nthe role of courts in case where matter is subject to the\narbitration.\nSection 5\nof the Act specifically restricted the\ninterference of the courts to some extent. In other words, it is\nonly in exceptional circumstances, as provided by this Act,\nthe court is entitled to intervene in the dispute which is the\nsubject-matter of arbitration. Such intervention may be\nbefore, at or after the arbitration proceeding, as the case\nmay be. In short, court shall not intervene with the subject-\nmatter of arbitration unless injustice is caused to either of the\nparties.‖\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Therefore, expeditious and effective disposal of matters are most\ncertainly considered the primary objectives of the enactment of the\n\nArbitration Act\n. To fulfil the objective of introducing the\nArbitration Act\n,\nit has been deemed necessary by the legislature as well as the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court to limit interference by the Courts in the process of\narbitration, whether before, during or after the conclusion of the\nproceedings.\n\n39. The petitioner before this Court has invoked\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act to challenge the impugned Award. The relevant portion of\nthe said provision is reproduced hereunder for perusal and consideration:-\n\n―34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--\n\n(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be\nmade only by an application for setting aside such award in\naccordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).\n(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if--\n\n(a) the party making the application establishes on the\nbasis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that--\n\n(i) a party was under some incapacity, or\n\n(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under\nthe law to which the parties have subjected it or,\nfailing any indication thereon, under the law for\nthe time being in force; or\n\n(iii) the party making the application was not\ngiven proper notice of the appointment of an\narbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was\notherwise unable to present his case; or\n\n(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not\ncontemplated by or not falling within the terms\nof the submission to arbitration, or it contains\ndecisions on matters beyond the scope of the\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

The contents of the provision clearly show that the intention of\nlegislature while enacting the\nArbitration Act\n, as well as while carrying\nout amendments to the same, was that there should be limited\nintervention of the Courts in arbitral proceedings, especially after the\nproceedings have been concluded and an Award thereto has been made\nby the concerned Arbitral Tribunal. Any claim brought forth a Court of\nlaw under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act shall be in accordance with\nthe principle of the provisions laid down under the\nArbitration Act\nas well\nas interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n41. The Law Commission of India in its 246 th Report has also\nelaborated upon the background of introducing\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act and laid down as under:-\n\n―3.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(hereinafter\n\"the Act\") is based on the UNCITRAL Model law on\nInternational Commercial Arbitration, 1985 and the\nUNCITRAL Conciliation Rules, 1980.\nThe Act\nhas now been\nin force for almost two decades, and in this period of time,\nalthough arbitration has fast emerged as a frequently chosen\nalternative to litigation, it has come to be afflicted with\nvarious problems including those of high costs and delays,\nmaking it no better than either the earlier regime which it\nwas intended to replace; or to litigation, to which it intends\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 24 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\nto provide an alternative. Delays are inherent in the\narbitration process, and costs of arbitration can be\ntremendous. Even though courts play a pivotal role in giving\nfinality to certain issues which arise before, after and even\nduring an arbitration, there exists a serious threat of\narbitration related litigation getting caught up in the huge\nlist of pending cases before the courts. After the award, a\nchallenge under\nSection 34\nmakes the award inexecutable\nand such petitions remain pending for several years. The\nobject of quick alternative disputes resolution frequently\nstands frustrated.\n\n4. There is, therefore, an urgent need to revise certain\nprovisions of the Act to deal with these problems that\nfrequently arise in the arbitral process. The purpose of this\nChapter is to lay down the foundation for the changes\nsuggested in the Report of the Commission. The suggested\namendments address a variety of issues that plague the\npresent regime of arbitration in India and, therefore, before\nsetting out the amendments, it would be useful to identify the\nproblems that the suggested amendments are intended to\nremedy and the context in which the said problems arise and\nhence the context in which their solutions must be seen.\n\n25. Similarly, the Commission has found that challenges to\narbitration awards under\nSections 34\nand\nare similarly\nkept pending for many years. In this context, the Commission\nproposes the addition of\nSections 34(5)\nand\n48(4)\nwhich\nwould require that an application under those sections shall\nbe disposed of expeditiously and in any event within a period\nof one year from the date of service of notice. In the case of\napplications under\nSection 48\nof the Act, the Commission has\nfurther provided a time-limit under\nSection 48(3)\n, which\nmirrors the time-limits set out in\nSection 34(3)\n, and is aimed\nat ensuring that parties take their remedies under this section\nseriously and approach a judicial forum expeditiously, and\nnot by way of an afterthought.‖\n\n42. With the repeal of\nArbitration Act\nof 1940 by way of\nArbitration\nAct, 1996\n, the legislature sought to achieve the objective of reducing the\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

The amendment of\n\nSection 34\nwas also to have the Courts readily and expeditiously\nadjudicate upon any proceedings arising out of arbitration proceedings.\nThe challenge to an Award also must be disposed of as expeditiously\npossible by the Courts.\n\n43. It is clear that the speed and efficiency of disposal of disputes\nbetween parties are few of the substantial and key purposes of the\nintroduction, development and promotion of resolving disputes by way of\nalternate mechanisms of dispute resolution.\n\n44. Hence, the objective, goal and purpose of the Act as well as the\nintention of the legislature have to be given due consideration while\nadjudicating a petition under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nScope of Powers of Arbitrator & Intervention of Courts\n\n45. The Arbitrator, who in his wisdom, passes an Award, upon\nconducting the arbitration proceedings with the participation of parties to\nthe dispute, considering the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defence\npresented by and on behalf of the parties, the relevant documents placed\non record by the parties, is considered a Court for the purposes of\nadjudicating the dispute before him. An unfettered intervention in his\nfunctioning would defeat the spirit and purpose of the\nArbitration Act\n, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n46. An Arbitrator has wide powers while adjudicating arbitration\nproceedings. There is, undoubtedly, a scrutiny on the Arbitrator and the\nAwards passed by him, which has been stipulated under the\nArbitration\nAct\n. However, there is a deemed privilege of limited intervention from\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

The same has been reiterated by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court time and again.\n\n47. There is an extent to the accountability put upon an Arbitrator\nwhile passing an Award. This is evident from the fact that with the\nenforcement of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n, an Arbitrator\nneeds only to adhere to and fulfil the requirements under\nSection 31\nof\nthe Act. The limited requirements under\nSection 31\nare reproduced\nhereunder:-\n\n―Form and contents of arbitral award. -\n\n(1) An arbitral award shall be made in writing and shall be\nsigned by the members of the arbitral tribunal.\n(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), in arbitral\nproceedings with more than one arbitrator, the signatures of\nthe majority of all the members of the arbitral tribunal shall\nbe sufficient so long as the reason for any omitted signature\nis stated.\n\n(3) The arbitral award shall state the reasons upon which it\nis based, unless--\n\n(a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be\ngiven, or\n\n(b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms\nunder\nsection 30\n(4)\nThe arbitral award shall state its date and the place of\narbitration as determined in accordance with\nsection 20\nand\nthe award shall be deemed to have been made at that place.\n(5) After the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be\ndelivered to each party.\n\n(6) The arbitral tribunal may, at any time during the arbitral\nproceedings, make an interim arbitral award on any matter\nwith respect to which it may make a final arbitral award. ...‖\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

In addition to the requirements laid down under the provision, an\nArbitrator, although acting in accordance with the requirements of the\n\nArbitration Act\n, need not act as a formal Court while adjudicating a\ndispute and pass an Award which is lengthy, detailed or speaking. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated that an Award which is not\nspeaking shall be set aside by the Court only in exceptional cases.\n\n49.\nIn\nAnand Brothers (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors.\n, (2014) 9\nSCC 212, the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the question of a reasoned or\nspeaking Award observed and held as under:-\n\n―7. Before we examine whether the expression ''finding\"\n\nappearing in Clause 70 would include reasons in support of\nthe conclusion drawn by the arbitrator, we consider it\nappropriate to refer to the Constitution Bench decision of this\nCourt in\nRaipur Development Authority v. Chokhamal\nContractors\nwherein this Court was examining whether an\naward without giving reasons can be remitted or set aside by\nthe Court in the absence of any stipulation in the arbitral\nagreement obliging the arbitrator to record his reasons.\nAnswering the question in the negative, this Court held that a\nnonspeaking award cannot be set aside except in cases where\nthe parties stipulate that the arbitrator shall furnish reasons\nfor his award. This Court held: (SCC pp. 750-51, para 33)\n―33 . ... When the parties to the dispute insist upon\nreasons being given, the arbitrator is, as already\nobserved earlier, under an obligation to give reasons.\nBut there may be many arbitrations in which parties to\nthe dispute may not relish the disclosure of the reasons\nfor the awards. In the circumstances and particularly\nhaving regard to the various reasons given by the\nIndian Law Commission for not recommending to the\nGovernment to introduce an amendment in the Act\nrequiring the arbitrators to give reasons for their\nawards we feel that it may not be appropriate to take\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Any\nlaxity in that behalf might lend itself to and, perhaps justify\nthe legitimate criticism, that the Government failed to\nprovide against possible prejudice to public interest.\n\n8. The following passage is in this regard apposite: (\nRaipur\nDevelopment Authority\ncase, SCC pp. 752-53, para 37)\n―37. There is, however, one aspect of non-speaking\nawards in non-statutory arbitrations to which\nGovernment and governmental authorities are parties\nthat compel attention. The trappings of a body which\ndischarges judicial functions and is required to act in\naccordance with law with their concomitant\nobligations for reasoned decisions, are not attracted to\na private adjudication of the nature of arbitration as\nthe latter, as we have noticed earlier, is not supposed\nto exert the State's sovereign judicial power. But\narbitral awards in disputes to which the State and its\ninstrumentalities are parties affect public interest and\nthe matter of the manner in which Government and its\ninstrumentalities allow their interest to be affected by\nsuch arbitral adjudications involve larger questions of\npolicy and public interest. Government and its\ninstrumentalities cannot simply allow large financial\ninterests of the State to be prejudicially affected by\nnon-reviewable---except in the limited way allowed by\nthe statute-non-speaking arbitral awards. Indeed, this\nbranch of the system of dispute resolution has, of late,\nacquired a certain degree of notoriety by the manner\nin which in many cases the financial interests of\nGovernment have come to suffer by awards which\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 29 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\nhave raised eyebrows by doubts as to their rectitude\nand propriety. It will not be justifiable for\nGovernments or their instrumentalities to enter into\narbitration agreements which do not expressly\nstipulate the rendering of reasoned and speaking\nawards. Governments and their instrumentalities\nshould, as a matter of policy and public interest-if not\nas a compulsion of law-ensure that wherever they\nenter into agreements for resolution of disputes by\nresort to private arbitrations, the requirement of\nspeaking awards is expressly stipulated and ensured. It\nis for Governments and their instrumentalities to\nensure in future this requirement as a matter of policy\nin the larger public interest. Any lapse in that behalf\nmight lend itself to and perhaps justify, the legitimate\ncriticism that Government failed to provide against\npossible prejudice to public interest.‖\n\n9. Reference may also be made to the\nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\nwhich has repealed the\nArbitration\nAct, 1940\nand which seeks to achieve the twin objectives of\nobliging the Arbitral Tribunal to give reasons for its arbitral\naward and reducing the supervisory role of courts in\narbitration proceedings.\nSection 31(3)\nof the said Act obliges\nthe Arbitral Tribunal to state the reasons upon which it is\nbased unless the parties have agreed that no reasons be\ngiven or the arbitral award is based on consent of the\nparties. There is, therefore, a paradigm shift in the legal\nposition under the new Act which prescribes a uniform\nrequirement for the arbitrators to give reasons except in the\ntwo situations mentioned above. The change in the legal\napproach towards arbitration as an alternative dispute\nresolution mechanism is perceptible both in regard to the\nrequirement of giving reasons and the scope of interference\nby the court with arbitral awards. While in regard to\nrequirement of giving reasons the law has brought in\ndimensions not found under the old Act, the scope of\ninterference appears to be shrinking in its amplitude, no\nmatter judicial pronouncements at time appear to be heading\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

We are referring to these developments\nfor it is one of the well-known canons of interpretation of\nstatutes that when an earlier enactment is truly ambiguous in\nthat it is equally open to diverse meanings, the later\nenactment may in certain circumstances serve as the\nparliamentary exposition of the former.\n\n14. It is trite that a finding can be both: a finding of fact or a\nfinding of law. It may even be a finding on a mixed question\nof law and fact. In the case of a finding on a legal issue the\narbitrator may on facts that are proved or admitted explore\nhis options and lay bare the process by which he arrives at\nany such finding. It is only when the conclusion is supported\nby reasons on which it is based that one can logically\ndescribe the process as tantamount to recording a finding. It\nis immaterial whether the reasons given in support of the\nconclusion are sound or erroneous. That is because a\nconclusion supported by reasons would constitute a \"finding\"\n\nno matter the conclusion or the reasons in support of the\nsame may themselves be erroneous on facts or in law. It may\nthen be an erroneous finding but it would nonetheless be a\nfinding. What is important is that a finding presupposes\napplication of mind. Application of mind is best\ndemonstrated by disclosure of the mind; mind in turn is best\ndisclosed by recording reasons. That is the soul of every\nadjudicatory process which affects the rights of the\nparties....‖\n\n50. Therefore, while considering a challenge to an Arbitral Award\nwhere private parties are involved, the Court need not examine the\nvalidity of the findings or the reasoning behind the findings given by an\nArbitrator. The extent to which a Court may exercise supervisory powers\nin this respect is limited to examining whether the Award and the\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

It has also been reiterated that, while adjudicating a challenge\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, the Courts must limit themselves\nto examining the Award itself and not the facts of the case. A Court shall\nnot conduct a roving enquiry into the facts and evidence of the matter and\nneither shall the Court sit in appeal against the Award of the Arbitrator.\n\n52.\nIn\nUHL Power Co. Ltd. vs. State of Himachal Pradesh\n, (2022) 4\nSCC 116, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the narrow scope under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act and held as under:-\n\n―16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on courts under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is fairly narrow, when it\ncomes to the scope of an appeal under\nSection 37\nof the\nArbitration Act, the jurisdiction of an appellate court in\nexamining an order, setting aside or refusing to set aside an\naward, is all the more circumscribed.\nIn\nMMTC Ltd. v.\nVedanta Ltd.\n5, the reasons for vesting such a limited\njurisdiction on the High Court in exercise of powers under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act have been explained in the\nfollowing words: (SCC pp. 166-67, para 11)\n―11. As far as\nSection 34\nis concerned, the position is\nwell-settled by now that the Court does not sit in\nappeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on\nmerits on the limited ground provided under\nSection\n34(2)(b)(ii)\ni.e. if the award is against the public policy\nof India. As per the legal position clarified through\ndecisions of this Court prior to the amendments to the\n1996 Act in 2015, a violation of Indian public policy,\nin turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy\nof Indian law, a violation of the interest of India,\nconflict with justice or morality, and the existence of\npatent illegality in the arbitral award.

Furthermore, \"patent\nillegality\" itself has been held to mean contravention\nof the substantive law of India, contravention of the\n1996 Act, and contravention of the terms of the\ncontract.‖\n\n17. A similar view, as stated above, has been taken by this\nCourt in\nK. Sugumar v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.\n7,\nwherein it has been observed as follows: (SCC p. 540, para\n\n2)\n―2. The contours of the power of the Court under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act are too well established to\nrequire any reiteration. Even a bare reading of\nSection\nof the Act indicates the highly constricted power of\nthe civil court to interfere with an arbitral award. The\nreason for this is obvious. When parties have chosen to\navail an alternate mechanism for dispute resolution,\nthey must be left to reconcile themselves to the wisdom\nof the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the\ncourt should be restricted to the bare minimum.\n\nInterference will be justified only in cases of\ncommission of misconduct by the arbitrator which can\nfind manifestation in different forms including exercise\nof legal perversity by the arbitrator.‖\n\n53.\nIn\nDelhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd vs. Delhi Metro Rail\nCorporation\n, (2022) 1 SCC 131, the Hon'ble Supreme Court to this\naspect held as under:-\n\n―28.

Further, in\nState of Jharkhand vs. HSS Integrated DSN\n, (2019) 9\nSCC 798, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that even when there are more\nthan one plausible views and the Arbitrator, in his wisdom, adopts one of\nthem, having given reasons for his findings, the Courts shall not interfere\nwith such an Award. It was observed as under:-\n\n―6.1. In Progressive-MVR3, after considering the catena of\ndecisions of this Court on the scope and ambit of the\nproceedings under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, this\nCourt has observed and held that even when the view taken\nby the arbitrator is a plausible view, and/or when two views\nare possible, a particular view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal\nwhich is also reasonable should not be interfered with in a\nproceeding under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\n6.2. In Datar Switchgear Ltd., this Court has observed and\nheld that the Arbitral Tribunal is the master of evidence and\nthe findings of fact which are arrived at by the arbitrators on\nthe basis of the evidence on record are not to be scrutinised\nas if the Court was sitting in appeal. In para 51 of the\njudgment, it is observed and held as under: (SCC pp. 169-70)\n―51. ..... The proposition of law that the Arbitral\nTribunal is the master of evidence and the findings of\nfact which are arrived at by the arbitrators on the\nbasis of evidence on record are not to be scrutinised as\nif the Court was sitting in appeal now stands settled by\na catena of judgments pronounced by this Court\nwithout any exception thereto.‖\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Hence, the law which has been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt is that the scope of interference with an Arbitral Award under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is fairly limited and narrow. The Courts\nshall not sit in an appeal while adjudicating a challenge to an Award\nwhich is passed by an Arbitrator, the master of evidence, after due\nconsideration after facts, circumstances, evidence and material before\nhim.\n\n56. Therefore, it is clear that this Court shall also limit itself to the\nAward in question and not re-appreciate evidence and all material before\nthe Arbitrator.\n\nISSUE NO. II\n\n57. The foremost ground raised on behalf of the petitioner is that the\nfindings of the learned Arbitrator qua the specific performance of the\nAgreement to Sell dated 26th October 2015 are erroneous since the\nlearned Arbitrator failed to consider that the same was a forged and\nfabricated document, never executed by the petitioner.\n\n58. To this extent the arguments which have been detailed above are\nreiterated to sum up the objections to be considered while adjudicating\nthe instant issue.\n\na. The petitioner claimed that she had not signed the Agreement\nto Sell.\n\nb. The petitioner took the plea of alibi and stated that she was not\nin the City when the alleged Agreement to Sell was purported\nto be signed.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

It was argued that the consideration for the Agreement was in\nfact the amount for cross-loan transactions between the\nparties.\n\n59. It has been averred on behalf of the petitioner that the learned\nArbitrator did not consider the said aspects while granting the relief of\nspecific performance of contract. Therefore, it is pertinent to reproduce\nand look into the findings of the learned Arbitrator. The same are\ndiscussed hereunder.\n\n60. The petitioner raised the objection of the Agreement to Sell before\nthe learned Arbitrator, which has been raised before this Court as well. To\nthis issue the learned Arbitrator as under:-\n\n―Claim No.1\nDecree for specific performance of Agreement to Sell dated\n26.10.2015, against the Respondent for execution of sale\ndeed of property in question.\n\ni. For consideration of relief of specific performance, the first\nquestion to be determined is whether the Agreement to Sell\ndated 26.10.2015, was executed between the parties? This is\nbecause Respondent claims it to be forged and fabricated.\nWhile referring the dispute to arbitration, 'the above issue\nincluding all others had been left open for adjudication by\nthe arbitrator. To prove execution of Agreement to Sell,\nClaimant produced original Agreement to Sell (Ex-CW 1/ A)\nwith proof of payment of part sale consideration of\nRs.40,00,000/- through banking channel. As noted earlier,\nClaimant deposed regarding Respondent's husband proposal\nto sell the agricultural land for the total sale consideration of\nRs.60,00,000/- being agreed with Rs.40,00,000/- being paid\nat the time of execution of the Agreement to Sell. Claimant\ndeposed as to due execution of Agreement to Sell dated\n26.10.2015 and proved the due execution by parties. Conjoint\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

He categorically stated to\nhave paid Rs. 40,00,000/- through banking channel as\nrecorded in the Agreement and receipt of the said amount is\nduly admitted by the Respondent albeit falsely claimed as\nloan.\n\nii. Claimant's testimony was further supported by the\nattesting witness CW-2, Ran Vijay Singh who also deposed\nthat Claimant and Respondent had executed the agreement.\nMr. Ran Vijay Singh verified Respondent's signatures on the\nAgreement to Sell. He categorically stated that Respondent\nhad signed the agreement in his presence.

We did not get it\nexamined from the handwriting expert because the\nsignatures on the alleged agreement looked similar to\nher usual style. of signatures.\n\niv. During arguments, Counsel for Respondent submitted that\nsignatures on Agreement to Sell appears to be of Respondent,\nbut she does not remember to have signed the agreement. On\nperusal of whole cross examination of Respondent, it is\nstrongly suggestive that it was her husband who took care of\nall her financial dealings and she only affixed her signatures,\nwhenever she was told to do so by her husband.\nv.

The learned Arbitrator noted that the petitioner herein failed to\ncorroborate her plea that the document pertaining to the Agreement to\nSell was not signed by her. It was noted that the petitioner was often\noblivious of the contents of the documents she used to sign since her\nhusband used to take care of the finances. It was also noted by the learned\nArbitrator that the petitioner herein suggested that the signatures on the\ndocument in question were very similar to hers, however, she did not take\nany steps to have the same examined.\n\n62. Thereafter, to the issue of plea of alibi, the learned Arbitrator held\nas under:-\n\n―Respondent raised the plea of alibi for the first time in her\ncross-examination. In her cross- examination, she deposed\nthat they were not in Delhi and had gone to Panchkula to\ninvite former Deputy Chief Minister Mr. Chandramohan and\nhis wife for her son's wedding. As already noted application\nto examine Dr. Naresh Kaushal was allowed by the Tribunal\nin view of \"no objection\" by Respondent's Counsel. In\naddition to reasons already stated, it was admitted by RW-3\nthat he met Respondent and her husband Mr. Amrish Gupta\nonly once; but curiously, was able to identify RW-1.\nIt is pertinent to note that Mr. Amrish Gupta, RW-1, the\npatient himself did not mention the visit to Panchkula or\nfalling ill at Kamal in his affidavit by way of evidence or\nduring his cross examination. It was only during the cross-\nexamination of Respondent/RW-2, at a later date, when she\nfor first time volunteered to say that they were not in Delhi\non 26/10/2015 i.e. the date of execution of the Agreement to\nSell.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

RW-3 deposed to have\nchecked blood pressure, ECG and carried out other random\nblood tests including sugar. No entries were made either in\nthe hospital register or laboratory, where tests had been\nconducted. He admitted that as a matter of course, entries\nwere made in patient's record, laboratory and hospital\nregister when blood tests, ECG and intravenous glucose is\nadministered to a patient, but no such entry had and\nadministration of intravenous glucose takes away the\ncredibility of bald statement of the witness. Moreover, no\nECG report or test results have been produced by\nRespondent or the laboratory of that date to substantiate\nexamination/tests but only photocopy of prescription was\nshown. Curiously, Dr. Naresh Kaushal recognized Mr.\nAmrish Gupta whom he claims to have met only once on\n26.10.2015 but could not give the name of even one patient\nout of 12 patients, he claimed to have examined the day\nbefore his deposition on 20.02.2019. He appears to be a\nprocured and biased witness, who does not deserve any\ncredence or inspire any confidence. The absence of any entry\nin the Hospital record of the tests carried out or ECG done,\nor any payment therefor cuts at the root of his deposition\nbeen made in present case. No convincing reason had been\ngiven by the witness during the cross-examination for this.\n\nAbsence of entries of blood tests, ECG and administration of\nintravenous glucose takes away the credibility of bald\nstatement of the witness. Moreover, no ECG report or test\nresults have been produced by Respondent or the laboratory\nof that date to substantiate examination/tests but only\nphotocopy of prescription was shown.

It arouses\nsuspicion when taken at belated stage, in a last ditch attempt\nto support the plea of nonexecution of the agreement in the\nface of credible evidence led by the Claimant. Respondent\nthroughout the proceedings had simply denied execution of\nAgreement to Sell without raising plea of alibi or examining\nany of the witnesses to prove her alleged trip to Panchkula. It\nshows nothing but an afterthought defence. Judicial\nPronouncements relied on by the Claimant namely\nMohinder\nSingh v State\n, reported at AIR 1953 Cri LJ 1761;\nLakban\nSingh @ Pappu vs The State of NCT of Delhi\n, reported at Cr.\nAppeal No. 166/1999, are with regard to consequences\nflowing from the plea of alibi in criminal matters being found\nto be false. Even though analogy of adverse inference to\nreject the other defences as well can be drawn, but in view of\nforegoing discussion and reasons, the plea of alibi as taken\nby Respondent deserves to be rejected on merits as well.\nIn light of foregoing discussion, I hold that the Agreement to\nSell dated 26.10.2015 was duly executed between Claimant\nand the Respondent with sum of Rs.40,00,00/-, being paid as\npart sale consideration and the denial thereof by Respondent\nis wrongful, with ulterior motive to somehow avoid, deny and\nresile from the bargain entered into.‖\n\n63. It was observed by the learned Arbitrator that the application for\nplea of alibi was raised by the petitioner herein at a belated stage. It was\nfurther noted that nothing on record, including material or even the\ntestimony of RW-3, could substantiate the claim raised by the petitioner\nto suggest that she was not present at the place of signing of the\nAgreement on the day it was signed.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

While considering the objection the question of allegations\nregarding cross-loan transaction, the learned Arbitrator held as under:-\n\n―vii. Let us now consider the defence raised by the\nRespondent namely the receipt of Rs. Rs.40,00,000/- was\ntowards a loan. Not a single document has been produced by\nway of any receipt or any loan agreement. The said amount\nhas also not been reflected in the Income Tax returns of the\nRespondent. No remittance of any interest or deduction of\nany tax on the interest income has been either produced, or\nproved on record. Respondent also was unaware about the\nrate or interest or if it was an interest free loan. Relevant\nportion from her cross-examination is reproduced herein\nbelow:\n\nQ.28.

Though Respondent and· her husband in their pleadings\nand evidence had taken the plea that the said financial\ntransaction of Rs.40,00,000/- was part of numerous cross-\ntransactions where loans were taken and cross-loans were\ngiven between Claimant, his associates and Mr. Surinder\nKumar Wadhwa and Respondent and her family.

There is no special relation of Respondent's\nhusband with Claimant pleaded or shown or even Claimant's\nconnection with the said parties so as to secure loan for them\nfrom Respondent and/or her husband. Respondent further\nreferred to ongoing recovery proceedings against these firms\nwhich are related to Claimant. Respondent's husband was\ncross-examined on these aspects of cross-loans and business\ntransactions. Extract from cross-examination of Respondent's\nhusband are given below for ready reference:\n\nQ.13. What was/is the constitution of M/s Sarna Sale,\nM/s ASP Sealing Products Pvt. Ltd., M/s Supreme\nElectricals and M/s Bharat Communications, to whom\nyou have allegedly advance loans ofRs.4 to 5 crores?\nAns: I do not know the constitution of the above\nentities except that of M/s Bharat Communications.\nM/s Bharat Communication is a sole proprietorship\nconcern owned by Mr. Bharat Goel. All these loans\nwere given at the behest of the Claimant without\nknowing the other concerns.\n\nx. The answers to questions as above do not indicate any\nconnection of Claimant with these transactions. Moreover,\nClaimant is not impleaded as party in any of these recovery\nproceedings, filed by Respondent's and/or her husband.\nRespondent's claim of cross-loans falls flat. It is Clear\ntherefore that no financial transaction had been made by\nRespondent or her family with Claimant. Moreover, her plea\nof associating Claimant is without any factual foundation.\nTherefore, the plea of Respondent, that the said sum being a\nloan transaction or part of a cross-loans with\nClaimant/family members is found to be baseless and without\nany factual foundation and has only be to state to be rejected,\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Upon consideration of the examination and cross-examination of\nthe relevant witnesses, the learned Arbitrator made the above findings.\n\n66. A perusal of the aforementioned portions of the Award clearly\nshow that the claims raised on behalf of the petitioner herein have been\nconsidered, adjudicated upon and answered by the learned Arbitrator in\nthe impugned Award. It is evident that not only has he given sufficient\nreasons for the findings but such findings have also been supported with\nevidence and other material on record. The petitioner failed to\ncorroborate, with her submissions and even evidence that the Agreement\nto Sell was forged and fabricated. At this stage, the scope of interference,\nwhich has been laid out in the foregoing paragraphs, is referred to. There\nis no need for this Court to enter into the validity of the reasoning and the\nfindings given by the learned Arbitrator.\n\n67. During the course of the argument before this Court, it was argued\non behalf of the petitioner that the learned Arbitrator did not give any\nfinding on the aspect of execution of the Agreement, however, the\ncontrary is evident from the perusal of the Award that the aspect was duly\nand carefully considered by the learned Arbitrator at length and only after\nconsideration and appreciation of material, the findings against the\npetitioner were passed.\n\n68.

The law regarding the issue specific performance under the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\n, has been settled. The same stands modified with the\namendments brought about in the\nSpecific Relief Act\nintroduced in 2018.\nThe relief of specific performance is an equitable relief. As per the\namended Act, the Courts no longer have discretionary powers under the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\nwhile adjudicating a relief of specific performance.\nThe Court may require to be satisfied on certain tests before granting the\nrelief of specific performance, however, upon fulfilment of the\ningredients and satisfaction of the court, a relief of specific performance\nmay mandatorily be granted. To this effect, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nKatta Sujatha Reddy v. Siddamsetty Infra Projects (P) Ltd.\n, (2023) 1\nSCC 355 while holding that the amendments brought to the\nSpecific\nRelief Act\nin the year 2018 are prospective and not retrospective in\nnature, observed as under:-\n\n―44. We may note that the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963\nis the\nsecond legislation, replacing the earlier 1877 enactment of\nthe\nSpecific Relief Act\n. The 1963 Act was enacted after\nconsideration of the Law Commission in its Ninth Report.\nThe 1963 Act more or less followed the English position on\nequitable remedy of specific performance. In Common Law,\nthe remedy of specific performance was unknown in the\ninitial days and courts only granted damages for the value of\ngoods if there was any breach of contract. Accordingly\nEnglish courts, in the early years, granted monetary relief. In\norder to rectify the harsh stance of law, Courts of Equity in\nEngland started granting relief of specific performance if the\nCourt of Equity found that granting damages would be\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

In any case, grant of such relief, which emanated from\nequitable principles, remained discretionary. This principle is\nclearly explained by Swinfen Eady M.R., in Whiteley\nLtd. v. Hilt [Whiteley Ltd. v. Hilt, (1918) 2 KB 808 (CA)] , in\nthe following manner : (KB p. 819)\n\n―... the power vested in the Court to order the delivery\nup of a particular chattel is discretionary, and ought\nnot to be exercised when the chattel is an ordinary\narticle of commerce and of no special value or interest,\nand not alleged to be of any special value to the\nplaintiff, and where the damages would fully\ncompensate.‖\n\n46. However, this was not the position under the Civil Law.\n\nUnder the Civil Law of contracts, adherence to the sanctity of\ncontract is enforced with greater rigour by inversing the\nsituation. The reason for choice of damages and specific\nperformance range from legal to economic. It is in this\ncontext that the courts cannot engage on the merits of having\ndamages or specific performance or a hybrid. It is best left to\nthe legislature to choose the course best-suited to the\neconomy without sheepishly following the typecast approach\nin England or Civil Law systems.\n\n48. We do not subscribe to the aforesaid reasoning provided\nby the High Court for the simple reason that after the 2018\nAmendment, specific performance, which stood as a\ndiscretionary remedy, is not (sic now) codified as an\nenforceable right which is not dependent anymore on\nequitable principles expounded by Judges, rather it is\nfounded on satisfaction of the requisite ingredients as\nprovided under the\nSpecific Relief Act\n. For determination of\nwhether a substituted law is procedural or substantive,\nreference to the nature of the parent enactment may not be\nmaterial. Instead, it is the nature of the amendments which\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

In any case, the amendment carried out in 2018 was\nenacted to further bolster adherence to the sanctity of\ncontracts. This approach was radical and created new rights\nand obligations which did not exist prior to such an\namendment.\nSection 10\n, after amendment, reads as under:\n\n―10. Specific performance in respect of contracts.--\nThe specific performance of a contract shall be\nenforced by the court subject to the provisions\ncontained in sub-section (2) of\nSection 11\n,\nSection 14\n\nand\nSection 16\n.‖\n\n52. This provision, which remained in the realm of the courts'\ndiscretion, was converted into a mandatory provision,\nprescribing a power the courts had to exercise when the\ningredients were fulfilled. This was a significant step in the\ngrowth of commercial law as the sanctity of contracts was\nreinforced with parties having to comply with contracts and\nthereby reducing efficient breaches.\n\n53. Under the pre-amended\nSpecific Relief Act\n, one of the\nmajor considerations for grant of specific performance was\nthe adequacy of damages under\nSection 14(1)(a)\n. However,\nthis consideration has now been completely done away with,\nin order to provide better compensation to the aggrieved\nparty in the form of specific performance.\n\n54. Having come to the conclusion that the 2018 Amendment\nwas not a mere procedural enactment, rather it had\nsubstantive principles built into its working, this Court\ncannot hold that such amendments would apply\nretrospectively.‖\n\n70. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, prior to holding that the relief of\nspecific performance is no longer discretionary, in the judgment of\nKamal\nKumar v.

The material questions, which are required to be gone\ninto for grant of the relief of specific performance, are:\n\n7.1. First, whether there exists a valid and concluded\ncontract between the parties for sale/purchase of the suit\nproperty.\n\n7.2. Second, whether the plaintiff has been ready and willing\nto perform his part of contract and whether he is still ready\nand willing to perform his part as mentioned in the contract.\n\n7.3. Third, whether the plaintiff has, in fact, performed his\npart of the contract and, if so, how and to what extent and in\nwhat manner he has performed and whether such\nperformance was in conformity with the terms of the\ncontract;\n\n7.4. Fourth, whether it will be equitable to grant the relief of\nspecific performance to the plaintiff against the defendant in\nrelation to suit property or it will cause any kind of hardship\nto the defendant and, if so, how and in what manner and the\nextent if such relief is eventually granted to the plaintiff;\n\n7.5. Lastly, whether the plaintiff is entitled for grant of any\nother alternative relief, namely, refund of earnest money, etc.\nand, if so, on what grounds.\n\n8. In our opinion, the aforementioned questions are part of\nthe statutory requirements [See\nSections 16(c)\n,\n,\n,\n,\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and Forms 47/48 of\nAppendices A to C\nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n].

In the instant case, the learned Arbitrator, while allowing the Claim\nof the respondent, held as under:-\n\n―For purposes of grant of relief of specific performance,\nTribunal is to look into Claimant's averments and conduct to\nadjudge whether he performed or has always been ready and\nwilling to perform, essential terms of contract, other than\nthose which are prevented or waived by Respondent. While\nexamining the entitlement, the conduct of parties is also to be\nseen qua the obligations undertaken. Specific Performance\nbeing a statutory remedy, Tribunal has to examine readiness\nand willingness of Claimant, conduct of the parties by\nevaluating the evidence led by the parties and whether the\nsame meets the statutory requirements and exercise\ndiscretion accordingly. This needs to be done in the context\nof the obligations, reciprocal promises undertaken in terms\nof the Agreement to Sell.\n\n***\nIn view of the discussion in preceding paras, the due\nexecution of Agreement to Sell stands established. We now\nneed to examine whether the Claimant has also shown its\nreadiness and willingness to go through the transaction\nand/or whether he was precluded from doing so by the\nactions and conduct of the Respondent. Claimant in his\naffidavit by way of evidence, deposed that he had offered the\nbalance sale consideration of Rs.20,00,000/- number of times\nbut Respondent was not coming forward for execution of the\nSale Deed. Claimant reiterated his readiness and willingness\nto pay remaining sale consideration of Rs.20,00,000/- subject\nto the latter executing the sale Deed in favour of Claimant in\nhis cross-examination. As per requirement\nu/s 16\nof the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963 that Claimant must plead/aver to\nhave performed or being ready and willing to perform, the\nessential obligation under the contract, Claimant has\ndischarged that burden to aver.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

It may also be noticed that apart from the conduct of\nthe Claimant, in case, it is found that the\nRespondent/defendant who either does not come with clean\nhands or suppresses or delays or misleads the Court, then\ndiscretion is not to be exercised in Respondent/ defendant's\nfavour by refusing Specific Performance to the Claimant.\nReference is invited to judgment of Supreme Court in\nZarina\nSiddiqui vs A. Ramalingam@ R. Amarnathan\nreported at\n2015 (1) SCC 705 while dealing on issue of specific\nperformance observed:\n\n33. \"The equitable discretion to grant or not to grant a\nrelief for specific performance also depends upon the\nconduct of the parties. The necessary ingredient has to\nbe proved and established by the plaintiff so that\ndiscretion would be exercised judiciously in favour of\nthe plaintiff At the same time. if the defendant does not\ncome with clean hands and suppresses material facts\nand evidence and misled the Court then such\ndiscretion should not be exercised by refusing to grant\nspecific performance.\n\n34. In the instant case, as noticed above, although\nDefendant 2 held a registered power of attorney on\nbehalf of Defendant 1 to Sell and dispose of the\nproperty, but the defendants not only made a false\nstatement on affidavit that the power of .attorney had\nauthorized the second defendant only to look after .and\nmanage the property but also. withheld the said power\nof attorney from the court in order to misguide the\ncourt from the truth of the facts. Further, by registered\nagreement the defendants agreed to Sell the suit\npremises after receiving advance consideration but\nthey denied the existence of the agreement in their\npleadings. Such conduct of the defendants in our\nopinion. disentitles them to ask the court for exercising\ndiscretion in their favour by refusing to grant a decree\nfor specific performance. Further, If a party to a lis\ndoes not disclose all material facts truly and fairly but\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

It would follow from the above that the\nRespondent who was denying transaction of Agreement to\nSell, had no intention to perform her part of obligation.\nNeither did Respondent handover possession nor did\nRespondent take any other steps, towards initiating the\nprocess of obtaining the permission\nu/s 4\nof The Delhi Land\n(Restrictions on Transfer) Act, 1972. Therefore, in terms of\nthe aforesaid judgments the Respondent, who is guilty of\nabuse of legal process and taking false pleas cannot seek the\ndiscretion of the Tribunal in her favour by refusing to grant a\ndecree of Specific performance.\n\nReference may also be made in this regard to the case of\n\nSilvey and Ors. vs. Arun Varghese and Ors.\nreported at\n(2008) 11 SCC 45, to support the proposition that discretion\nshould not be exercised in favour of the defendant by refusing\ngrant of specific performance to plaintiff, where defendant\ntook a false plea and was not ready to perform his part of the\nobligation.\n\nxxi. Claimant's conduct prior and subsequent to filing of\nclaim are taken into consideration. Readiness of Claimant\ncan be seen from his financial capacity whereas willingness\nwould be derived from his conduct. Therefore, to prove\nreadiness Claimant must prove his financial capacity to pay\nthe balance amount ofRs.20,00,000/- since the day of\nexecution of Agreement to Sell till the date of award and the\nsame is examined in light of evidence led by Claimant.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Income Tax Returns for\n\"assessment year of 2018-19 is Rs. 20,86,217/-. Additionally,\nClaimant produced Bank Statement of Claimant's\nproprietorship M/S GRV Polymers w.e.f 01.01.2016 to\n31.03.2017 with sanctioned loan facility of Rs. Rs.94,00,000/-\n(Ninety Four Lakhs) and additional Rs.20,00,000/- extended\nto Claimant's proprietorship by Bank of Baroda against\ncollateral Securities.\n\nIn view of the above evidence, it would be seen that loan\nfacility extended to Claimant against securities of Claimant\nwas at his disposal with liberty to put money to his use. As on\n25:04.2016, it had drawing option/window of Rs.93,79,548/-.\nSubsequently profit ofRs.16,25,085/- is reflected for the year\nending on 31.03.2018. Moreover, Claimant's own income for\nthe year ?O 16-1 7 was shown to be of about 12 lakhs and for\nthe year 2018-19, it was Rs.20 lakhs. Moreover, Claimant\nalso discharged the burden of paying the entire arbitral fee\nwith Respondent unwilling to pay due to alleged financial\nduress and hardship. Claimant had enough liquidity to pay\nthe balance sale consideration of only Rs.20,00,000/- while\nsubstantial consideration of Rs.40,00,000/- stood already\npaid. Therefore, Claimant has proved his readiness and\ncapacity to pay the remaining sum ofRs.20,00,000/\nthroughout.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid authoritative pronouncement of the\nSupreme court directly applicable to the case, I have not\nconsidered it necessary to advert to other judgments cited by\nthe Claimant and Respondent. It is therefore held that the\nClaimant is not disentitled to the relief of decree of Specific\nPerformance merely on the ground of absence of\ncommunication for the period of 11 months during which\ntime he was following up and making efforts with the\nRespondent for completing the sale and not resort to\nlitigation.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

An award is accordingly\npassed in favour of the Claimant and against the Respondent\ngranting specific performance of the Agreement to Sell dated\n26.10.2015 in respect of Agriculture land admeasuring 2\nbighas 8 biswas, bearing Mustatil No. 3, Killa Nos. 2111 (1-\n\n4) and 2112 Min 1112 (1-4), situated in village Jonapur,\nTehsil, Mehrauli, New Delhi. subject to the Claimant\ndepositing the balance sale consideration of Rs. 20,00,000/-\nbefore the Registrar General of High Court of Delhi within 2\nweeks of the Respondent applying for and obtaining NOC/\nPermission for transfer of the suit land under the (Delhi Land\nRestriction on Transfer) Act. Claimant shall join the\nRespondent in any such application for obtaining NOC. In\ncase, the Respondent fails to apply for such permission, the\nClaimant may apply to the Registrar of the High Court for\nobtaining such permission.‖\n\n72. It is apparent that the learned Arbitrator considered the aspect of\nreadiness and willingness to perform an Agreement while deciding the\nquestion of specific performance while applying the principles to the facts\nof the instant case. Referring to the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt as well as the issue of extended time period raised by the petitioner\nherein, the learned Arbitrator found that there was a degree of readiness\nand willingness on the part of the respondent to fulfil his obligations and\nperform the Agreement. The learned Arbitrator has thoroughly considered\nthe evidence, contentions of the parties as well as the law\nlaid down by\n\nthe judicial precedents before reaching the conclusion that the respondent\nis entitled for specific performance of the Agreement.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Therefore, this Court on the Issue No. II is of the opinion that the\nlearned Arbitrator thoroughly and elaborately considered the objections\nraised on behalf of the petitioner regarding execution of the Agreement to\nSell and only thereafter considered the question of specific performance\nof the Agreement after due appreciation of evidence and material on\nrecord.\n\nISSUE NO. III\n\n74. Since, it has been settled that the scope of interference under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is limited, it is now pertinent to see the\nconsiderations that are to be considered while adjudicating upon a\nchallenge and in what circumstances may an Award may be set aside.\n\n75. On a bare reading of the invoked provision\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act as quoted above, it has become evident the words used\ntherein are that \"An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if\",\nwhich signifies the intent of limiting the scope of interference by Courts\nin an Arbitral Award, passed after thorough procedure, involvement of\nparties, and appreciation of facts, evidence and law, \"only\" in the event of\nthe circumstances delineated in the provision being met. The limited\ngrounds which may invite the intervention and action thereupon by the\nCourts are explicitly laid down under the provision. What is to be seen by\na Court exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is\nthat an Award passed by an Arbitral Tribunal may only be set aside if it is\npatently illegal, against the public policy of India, based on no evidence\nand delineates no reason for passing the Award.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

The petitioner has raised the ground of patent illegality as well as\ncontravention to public policy while impugning the Award dated 30 th\nSeptember 2019.\n\n77. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in BCCI vs. Cricket Association &\nOrs. (2015) 3 SCC 251, on the question of public policy, held as under:-\n\n―90. The validity of Rule 6.2.4 as amended can be examined\nalso from the standpoint of its being opposed to \"public\npolicy\". But for doing so we need to first examine what is\nmeant by \"public policy\" as it is understood in legal\nparlance. The expression has been used in\nSection 23\nof the\nContract Act, 1872 and in\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 and host of other statutes but has not\nbeen given any precise definition primarily because the\nexpression represents a dynamic concept and is, therefore,\nincapable of any straitjacket definition, meaning or\nexplanation. That has not, however, deterred jurists and\ncourts from explaining the expression from very early times.\n\n91. Mathew, J. speaking for the Court in\nMurlidhar\nAggarwal v. State of U.P.\n27 referred to Winfield's definition\nin Public Policy in English Common Law 42 Harvard Law\nReview 76 to declare that: (SCC p. 482, para 31)\n―31. Public policy does not remain static in any given\ncommunity. It may vary from generation to generation\nand even in the same generation. Public policy would\nbe almost useless if it were to remain in fixed moulds\nfor all time.‖\n\n92. The Court then grappled with the problem of ascertaining\npublic policy if the same is variable and depends on the\nwelfare of the community and observed: (Murlidhar\nAggarwal case27 , SCC pp. 482-83, para 32)\n―3 2. If it is variable, if it depends on the welfare of the\ncommunity at any given time, how are the courts to\nascertain it?

However, there is no alternative under our\nsystem but to vest this power with Judges. The\ndifficulty of discovering what public policy is at any\ngiven moment certainly does not absolve the Judges\nfrom the duty of doing so. In conducting an enquiry, as\nalready stated, Judges are not hidebound by\nprecedent. The Judges must look beyond the narrow\nfield of past precedents, though this still leaves open\nthe question, in which direction they must cast their\ngaze. The Judges are to base their decisions on the\nopinions of men of the world, as distinguished from\nopinions based on legal learning. In other words, the\nJudges will have to look beyond the jurisprudence and\nthat in so doing, they must consult not their own\npersonal standards or predilections but those of the\ndominant opinion at a given moment, or what has been\ntermed customary morality. The Judges must consider\nthe social consequences of the rule propounded,\nespecially in the light of the factual evidence available\nas to its probable results. Of course, it is not to be\nexpected that men of the world are to be subpoenaed\nas expert witnesses in the trial of every action raising\na question of public policy. It is not open to the Judges\nto make a sort of referendum or hear evidence or\nconduct an inquiry as to the prevailing moral concept.\n\nSuch an extended extra-judicial enquiry is wholly\noutside the tradition of courts where the tendency is to\n'trust the Judge to be a typical representative of his\nday and generation'. Our law relies, on the implied\ninsight of the Judge on such matters. It is the Judges\nthemselves, assisted by the Bar, who here represent the\nhighest common factor of public sentiment and\nintelligence. No doubt, there is no assurance that\nJudges will interpret the mores* of their day more\nwisely and truly than other men. But this is beside the\npoint.

In Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. this Court was\nalso considering the import of the expression \"public policy\"\n\nin the context of the service conditions of an employee\nempowering the employer to terminate his service at his\nsweet will upon service of three months' notice or payment of\nsalary in lieu thereof. Explaining the dynamic nature of the\nconcept of public policy this Court observed: (SCC pp. 217-\n18, para 92)\n―92. . . . Public policy, however, is not the policy of a\nparticular Government. It connotes some matter which\nconcerns the public good and the public interest. The\nconcept of what is for the public good or in the public\ninterest or what would be injurious or harmful to the\npublic good or the public interest has varied from time\nto time. As new concepts take the place of old,\ntransactions which were once considered against\npublic policy are now being upheld by the courts and\nsimilarly where there has been a well recognised head\nof public policy, the courts have not shirked from\nextending it to new transactions and changed\ncircumstances and have at times not even flinched\nfrom inventing a new head of public policy ....\nIt is thus clear that the principles governing public\npolicy must be and are capable, on proper occasion, of\nexpansion or modification. Practices which were\nconsidered perfectly normal at one time have today\nbecome obnoxious and oppressive to public\nconscience. If there is no head of public policy which\ncovers a case, then the court must in consonance with\npublic conscience and in keeping with public good and\npublic interest declare such practice to be opposed to\npublic policy. Above all, in deciding any case which\nmay not be covered by authority our courts have\nbefore them the beacon light of the Preamble to the\nConstitution. Lacking precedent, the court can always\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

We may also refer to the decision of this Court in ONGC\nLtd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd., wherein this Court was considering\nthe meaning and import of the expression \"public policy of\nIndia\" as a ground for setting aside an arbitral award.\nSpeaking for the Court M.B. Shah, J. held that the expression\n\"public policy of India\" appearing in the Act aforementioned\nmust be given a liberal meaning for otherwise resolution of\ndisputes by resort to arbitration proceedings will get\nfrustrated because patently illegal awards would remain\nimmune to court's interference. This Court declared that\nwhat was against public good and public interest cannot be\nheld to be consistent with public policy. The following\npassage aptly summed up the approach to be adopted in the\nmatter: (Saw Pipes Ltd. case, SCC pp. 727-28, para 31)\n―31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase 'public policy\nof India' used in\nSection 34\nin context is required to be\ngiven a wider meaning. It can be stated that the\nconcept of public policy connotes some matter which\nconcerns public good and the public interest. What is\nfor public good or in public interest or what would be\ninjurious or harmful to the public good or public\ninterest has varied from time to time. However, the\naward which is, on the face of it, patently in violation\nof statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public\ninterest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely to\nadversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in\nour view in addition to narrower meaning given to the\nterm 'public policy' in Renusagar case it is required to\nbe held that the award could be set aside if it is\npatently illegal. The result would be-award could be\nset aside if it is contrary to:\n\n(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or\n\n(b) the interest of India; or\n\n(c) justice or morality, or\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Award could also\nbe set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it\nshocks the conscience of the court. Such award is\nopposed to public policy and is required to be\nadjudged void.‖\n\n95. In ONGC Ltd. v. Western GECO International Ltd., this\nCourt was examining the meaning of \"fundamental policy of\nIndian law\", an expression used by this Court in Saw Pipes\ncase. Extending the frontiers of what will constitute \"public\npolicy of India\" this Court observed: (Western GECO\nInternational Ltd. case , SCC pp. 278-80, paras 35 & 38-39)\n―35. What then would constitute the 'fundamental\npolicy of Indian law' is the question. The decision in\nONGC does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the\nexpression must, in our opinion, include all such\nfundamental principles as providing a basis for\nadministration of justice a and enforcement of law in\nthis country. Without meaning to exhaustively\nenumerate the purport of the expression 'fundamental\npolicy of Indian law', we may refer to three distinct\nand fundamental juristic principles that must\nnecessarily be understood as a part and parcel of the\nfundamental policy of Indian law. The first and\nforemost is the principle that in every determination\nwhether by a court or other authority that affects the\nrights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences,\nthe court or authority concerned is bound to adopt\nwhat is in legal parlance called a 'judicial approach'\nin the matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach\narises from the very nature of the power exercised by\nthe court or the authority does not have to be\nseparately or additionally enjoined upon the fora\nconcerned. What must be remembered is that the\nimportance of a judicial approach in judicial and\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 60 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\nquasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so\nlong as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising\npowers that affect the rights or obligations of the\nparties before them shows fidelity to judicial\napproach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious\nor whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that\nthe authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject\nin a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its\ndecision is not actuated by any extraneous\nconsideration. Judicial approach in that sense acts as\na check against flaws and faults that can render the\ndecision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to\nchallenge.\n\n38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the\npolicy of Indian law is the principle that a court and so\nalso a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining\nthe rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in\naccordance with the principles of natural justice.\nBesides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of\nthe facets of the principles of natural justice is that the\ncourt/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind\nto the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a\nview one way or the other. Non-application of mind is\na defect that is fatal to any adjudication. Application\nof mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind\nand disclosure of mind is best done by recording\nreasons in support of the decision which the court or\nauthority is taking. The requirement that an\nadjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that\nview, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it\ncan be described as a fundamental policy of Indian\nlaw.\n\n39. No less important is the principle now recognised\nas a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative\nlaw that a decision which is perverse or so irrational\nthat no reasonable person would have arrived at the\nsame will not be sustained in a court of law. Perversity\nor irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Decisions\nthat fall short of the standards of reasonableness are\nopen to challenge in a court of law often in writ\njurisdiction of the superior courts but no less in\nstatutory processes wherever the same are available.‖\n\n96. To sum up: public policy is not a static concept. It varies\nwith times and from generation to generation. But what is in\npublic good and public interest cannot be opposed to public\npolicy and vice versa. Fundamental Policy of Law would also\nconstitute a facet of public policy. This would imply that all\nthose principles of law that ensure justice, fair play and\nbring transparency and objectivity and promote probity in\nthe discharge of public functions would also constitute public\npolicy. Conversely, any deviation, abrogation, frustration or\nnegation of the salutary principles of justice, fairness, good\nconscience, equity and objectivity will be opposed to public\npolicy. It follows that any rule, contract or arrangement that\nactually defeats or tends to defeat the high ideals of fairness\nand objectivity in the discharge of public functions no matter\nby a private non-governmental body will be opposed to\npublic policy. ....‖\n\n78. While discussing the fundamentals of patent illegality, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in\nState of Chhattisgarh vs. Sal Udyog (P) Ltd.\n, (2022) 2\nSCC 275 held as under:-\n\n―14. The law on interference in matters of awards under the\n1996 Act has been circumscribed with the object of\nminimising interference by courts in arbitration matters. One\nof the grounds on which an award may be set aside is \"patent\nillegality\". What would constitute \"patent illegality\" has been\nelaborated in\nAssociate Builders v. DDA\n, where \"patent\nillegality\" that broadly falls under the head of \"Public\nPolicy\", has been divided into three sub-heads in the\nfollowing words: (SCC p. 81, para 42)\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 62 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\n―42. In the 1996 Act, this principle is substituted by\nthe \"patent illegality\" principle which, in turn,\ncontains three sub-heads:\n\n42.1. (a) A contravention of the substantive law of\nIndia would result in the death knell of an arbitral\naward. This must be understood in the sense that such\nillegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot\nbe of a trivial nature. This again is really a\ncontravention of\nSection 28\n(1 )(a) of the Act, which\nreads as under:\n\n'28. Rules applicable to substance of dispute.-(])\nWhere the place of arbitration is situated in\nlndia,-\n\n(a) in an arbitration other than an international\ncommercial arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal\nshall decide the dispute submitted to arbitration\nin accordance with the substantive law for the\ntime being in force in India;'\n42.2. (b) A contravention of the\nArbitration Act\nitself\nwould be regarded as a patent illegality - for example\nif an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in\ncontravention of\nSection 31 (3)\nof the Act, such award\nwill be liable to be set aside.\n\n42.3. (c) Equally, the third sub-head of patent illegality\nis really a contravention of\nSection 28\n( 3) of the\n\nArbitration Act\n, which reads as under:\n\n'28. Rules applicable to substance of dispute.-\n\n(1)-(2) * * *\n(3) In all cases, the Arbitral Tribunal shall\ndecide in accordance with the terms of the\ncontract and shall take into account the usages\nof the trade applicable to the transaction.'\n\n15. In Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAJ9,\nspeaking for the Bench, R.F. Nariman, J. has spelt out the\ncontours of the limited scope of judicial interference in\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 63 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\nreviewing the arbitral awards under the 1996 Act and\nobserved thus: (SCC pp. 169-71, paras 34-41)\n\"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression\n\"public policy of India\", whether contained in\nSection\nor in\nSection 48\n, would now mean the \"fundamental\npolicy of Indian law\" as explained in paras 18 and 27\nof Associate Builders8 i.e. the fundamental policy of\nIndian law would be relegated to \"Renusagar\"\n\nunderstanding of this expression. This would\nnecessarily mean that Western Geco 10 expansion has\nbeen done away with. In short, Western Geco10 , as\nexplained in paras 28 and 29 of Associate Builders8,\nwould no longer obtain, as under the guise of\ninterfering with an award on the ground that the\narbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the\nCourt's intervention would be on the merits of the\naward, which cannot be permitted post amendment.\nHowever, insofar as principles of natural justice are\nconcerned, as contained in\nSections 18\nand\n\n34(2)(a)(iii)\nof the 1996 Act, these continue to be\ngrounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in\npara 30 of Associate Builders8 .\n\n3 5. It is important to notice that the ground for\ninterference insofar as it concerns \"interest of India\"\n\nhas since been deleted, and therefore, no longer\nobtains. Equally, the ground for interference on the\nbasis that the award is in conflict with justice or\nmorality is now to be understood as a conflict with the\n\"most basic notions of morality or justice\". This again\nwould be in line with paras 36 to 39 of Associate\nBuilders8 , as it is only such arbitral awards that shock\nthe conscience of the court that can be set aside on this\nground.\n\n36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now\nconstricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is\ncontrary to the fundamental policy f Indian law, as\nunderstood in paras 18 and 27 of Associate Builders8 ,\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P. (COMM) 144/2020 Page 64 of 69\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2815\n\nor secondly, that such award is against basic notions\nof justice or morality as understood in paras 36 to 39\nof Associate Builders8. Explanation 2 to\nSection\n34(2)\n(b )(ii) and Explanation 2 to\nSection 48(2)\n(b )(ii)\nwas added by the Amendment Act only so that Western\nGeco10 , as understood in Associate Builders8, and\nparas 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away with.\n\n37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are\nconcerned, an additional ground is now available\nunder sub-section (2-A), added by the Amendment Act,\n2015, to\nSection 34\n. Here, there must be patent\nillegality appearing on the face of the award, which\nrefers to such illegality as goes to the root of the\nmatter but which does not amount to mere erroneous\napplication of the law. In short, what is not subsumed\nwithin \"the fundamental policy of Indian law\", namely,\nthe contravention of a statute not linked to public\npolicy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the\nbackdoor when it comes to setting aside an award on\nthe ground of patent illegality.\n\n38. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation\nof evidence, which is what an appellate court is\npermitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground\nof patent illegality appearing on the face of the award.\n\n39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders8 ,\nnamely, a mere contravention of the substantive law\noflndia, by itself, is no longer a ground available to set\naside an arbitral award. Para 42.2 of Associate\nBuilders8, however, would remain, for if an arbitrator\ngives no reasons for an award and contravenes\nSection\n31(3)\nof the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount to a\npatent illegality on the face of the award.\n\n40. The change made in\nSection 28\n( 3) by the\nAmendment Act really follows what is stated in paras\n42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders8 , namely, that the\nconstruction of the terms of a contract is primarily for\nan arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

Also, if the\narbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with\nmatters not allotted to him, he commits an error of\njurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall\nwithin the new ground added under\nSection 34\n(2-A).\n\n41. What is important to note is that a decision which\nis perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32 of\nAssociate Builders, while no longer being a ground for\nchallenge under \"public policy of India\", would\ncertainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on\nthe face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no\nevidence at all or an award which ignores vital\nevidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse\nand liable to be set aside on the ground of patent\nillegality. Additionally, a finding based on documents\ntaken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator\nwould also qualify as a decision based on no evidence\ninasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led\nby the parties, and therefore, would also have to be\ncharacterised as perverse.\"\n\n16. In Delhi Airport Metro Express (P) Ltd. referring to the\nfacets of patent illegality, this Court has held as under: (SCC\np. 150, para 29)\n\"29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to\nthe root of the matter. In other words, every error of\nlaw committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall\nwithin the expression \"patent illegality\". Likewise,\nerroneous application of law cannot be categorised as\npatent illegality. In addition, contravention of law not\nlinked to public policy or public interest is beyond the\nscope of the expression \"patent illegality\". What is\nprohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to\nconclude that the award suffers from patent illegality\nappearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not\nsit in appeal against the arbitral award.

The conclusions of the arbitrator which are\nbased on no evidence or have been arrived at by\nignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set\naside on the ground of patent illegality. Also,\nconsideration of documents which are not supplied to\nthe other party is a facet of perversity falling within the\nexpression ―patent illegality‖.‖\n\n79. The abovementioned precedents have settled the position of a\nchallenge to an Arbitral Award. The facets under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act, specifically under Sub-\nsection 2\n, provide the limited\npurview of such a challenge.\n\n80. In order to set aside an Award under\nSection 34\nthe petitioner must\nshow that illegality which has been alleged goes to the root of the matter\nand is not an illegality of trivial nature. In failure of the same the\nimpugned Award cannot be held to be against the public policy. Award\ncould also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the\nconscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is\nrequired to be adjudged void.\n\n81. To argue that the impugned Award before this Court is liable to set\naside in the instant petition it has been argued that the findings of the\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

As stipulated by the aforementioned precedents, the words are\nnot to be construed in their plain meaning, but the essence to be\nappreciated while adjudicating a challenge under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act is that the illegalities or deficiencies are such that they are\napparent on the face of record and/or shock the conscience of the Court\nand can in no manner be sustained. In the case at hand, the petitioner has\nnot been able to show that the impugned Award suffers from such\nillegality that is apparent on the face of record and upholding the same\nwould be against the law.\n\n82. Therefore, as regards to Issue No. III, this Court is of the\nconsidered view that the petitioner has not been able to show that the\ngrounds laid under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act for setting aside the\nimpugned Award are made out on behalf of the petitioner. None of the\nfinding of the learned Arbitrator is such that it shows that the impugned\nAward is patently illegal to shock the conscience of the Court, against\npublic policy or fundamental policy of India or falls under the grounds\nlaid down in\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n83. The law settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court with respect to\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act leaves no scope for doubt that the\nenactment of the\nArbitration Act\nand the amendments thereto have been\ncarried out with the aim to promote resolution by way of alternative\nmechanisms and to limit interference of the Courts in the process of\npromoting this alternative mechanism of dispute resolution.\n\nSignature Not VerifiedO.M.P.

In the instant matter, the petitioner has failed to show that the\nimpugned Award suffers from any patent illegality on the face of the\nrecord or that the grounds set out under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act\nare satisfied.\n\n85. Therefore, after consideration of the material on record, including\nthe impugned Arbitral Award, submissions on behalf of the parties this\nCourt is of the view that there is no finding or conclusion reached by the\nlearned Arbitrator which warrants interference of this Court. The\npetitioner has not been able to substantiate her case for setting aside of the\nimpugned Award.\n\n86. Accordingly, the instant petition is dismissed since there is no\ncogent reason to set aside the impugned Award.\n\n87. Pending applications, if any, also stand dismissed.\n\n88.
