The Respondent No. 1 \"M/s United Foundation Private\nLimited\" had invoked the Arbitration Agreement and preferred\ncertain Claims against \"K.M.B. Estates LLP\" the Petitioner.\n\n 4\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n3. The Brief facts leading to the case are as follows:-\n\n The Petitioner is the developer of the property who\nundertook to construct both residential and commercial\nbuildings at the project site, which belongs to Krishna E\nCampus, that the Respondent No. 1 approached to undertake\nthe work and issued a quotation as per Ex.R.26, that\nsubsequently after deliberations the Respondent No. 1 issued\nEx.R.1/ letter and re-considered the dewatering system with\ndeep well method, that the Petitioner had handed over Ex.R.2/\nSoil Test Reports to the Respondent No. 1, that the Respondent\nNo. 1 submitted revised quotation in the meeting held as per\nEx.R.27, that the Respondent No. 1 also issued Ex.R.28/ Letter\nstating that the program for strutting and demolishing of soil\nnails and subsequent earth work has to be worked out with the\nmain contractor, thereafter Ex.C.1/ Letter of Intent was issued,\nthat the Respondent No. 1 failed to keep up with time schedule\nand failed to provide proper works in terms of schedule, that the\nRespondent No. 1 was required to start earth work excavation\nworks on 02.04.2013, but the work have never started on time,\nthat the Respondent No. 1 claimed payments as per Ex.R.19,\nthat the PMC has issued Ex.R.29/ email to the Respondent No. 1\nto put up safety boards and safety manuals, that the\nRespondent No. 1 sent Ex.R.31/ email seeking payments, that\n\n 5\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nthe PMC issued Ex.R.32/ email seeking reasons for not\ndeploying proper machinery and man power, that the PMC\ngranted permission to the Respondent No. 1 to engage the\nservices of BBF Group as per Ex.P.75/ email, that RA Bill No.1\nwas forwarded to the PMC as per Ex.R.35, that the PMC as per\nEx.R.36/ email elaborating the necessary documents and the\nformats for billing to be submitted, that as per Ex.R.37/ email\nthe Respondent No. 1 represented that he was fully equipped to\nhandle the situations, that as per Ex.R.38/ email, the\nRespondent No. 1 claimed that there is another leak on the\neastern side of the project site, that despite the untenable\nclaims, the Petitioner made payments of Rs. 31,22,718/- to the\nRespondent No. 1 as per Ex.R.41, that the PMC as per Ex.R.42,\nmentioned the actual date of completion of work, that according\nto the Respondent No. 1, he has carried out works in terms of\nconditions and submitted RA Bills to the Petitioner, that however\nthey have not paid entire amount and hence he has filed the\nClaim Petition before the learned Arbitrator and after enquiry,\nthe learned Arbitrator has passed the Impugned Award and\nallowed the Claim Petition in part and rejected the counter claim\nof the Petitioner.\n\n 6\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n4. Being aggrieved by the said Arbitral Award, the Petitioner\nhas challenged the same on several grounds, which will be\ndiscussed later in the body of the Judgment.\n\n5. The Respondent No. 1 has submitted on 13.06.2019 that\nno written statement to be filed in this case since everything\nwas placed before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n6. The records of the Arbitral Tribunal are secured. I have\nheard the arguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner and the\narguments of the Advocate for the Respondent No. 1. The\nAdvocate for the Petitioner has filed Written Arguments on\n18.03.2021. The Advocate for the Respondent has filed his\nwritten arguments on 08.04.2021.\n\n7. Based on the above contentions of both parties, following\nPoints arise for my consideration:-\n\n 1. Whether there are grounds to set aside the\n Impugned Award under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n & Conciliation Act?\n\n 2. What Order?\n\n 7\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n8. My findings on the above points are as follows:-\n\n Point No.1:- In the Negative.\n\n Point No.2:- As per the final Order for\n the following reasons.\n\n REASONS\n\n9. Point No.1: - The Respondent No.1 has preferred a\nClaim Petition before the Learned Arbitrator for Rs.\n3,31,03,442/- under 13 heads. The Petitioner has raised a\ncounter-claim of Rs. 3,63,01,025/- with interest at 18% per\nannum from the date of Letter of Intent till the commencement\nof Arbitration and from that date till the amounts are paid.\n\n10. The Learned Arbitrator has partly allowed the claims of\nthe Respondent No.1 and dismissed the Counter Claim of the\nPetitioner in the Impugned Award. It is to be noted that the\nRespondent No. 1 has not challenged the rejection of the\nportion of his Claims.\n\n11. The Petitioner has challenged the said Impugned Award\nin this proceeding. The Hon'ble High Court in the Judgment\ndated 17.04.2021 in Com.A.P.No.25/2021 (Union of India\nvs. M/s Warsaw Engineers), has laid down certain\n\n 8\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nguidelines/principles about the writing of Judgments in a\nPetition filed under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct. Keeping in my mind the said guidelines, I now propose to\nexamine each and every ground urged by the Petitioner\nspecifically with reference to the submissions made by both\nAdvocates.\n\n12. By considering the facts of the case and the arguments of\nboth Advocates, I now propose to answer the grounds urged by\nthe Petitioner.\n\n13. The First ground is that the Impugned Award is totally\nperverse, contrary to laws, public policy of India, is completely\nunconscionable, shocks the conscience and causes considerable\nand tremendous prejudice to the rights of the Petitioner.\n\n13.a. This is a general ground and the same will be discussed\nalong with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.\n\n14. The Second ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nignored all material facts and has embarked on enquiry which is\nalien to the matter, that he has come to several unsupported\ninferences and the award is full of such inferences and\nconjectures which are not sustainable either in law or on facts.\n\n 9\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n14.a. This is also a general ground and the same will be\ndiscussed along with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.\n\n15. The Third ground is that the learned Arbitrator has not\nconsidered applicable laws, the provisions cited and such non-\nconsideration would render the award contrary to the public\npolicy.\n\n15.a. This is also a general ground and the same will be\ndiscussed along with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.\n\n16. The Fourth ground is that the Principle of natural\njustice is not followed, that contentions and documents\nproduced by the Petitioner have been ignored and blindly\naccepted the contentions and documents of the Respondent\nNo.1 and thereby the reasoning based on misinterpretation of\nfacts and evidence.\n\n16.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Impugned Award is contrary to \nSection 34\n of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act since most of the contentions\nput forth by the Petitioner which have been rejected without\nany reasoning or basis, that the principles of natural justice\nbeing required to be followed by the Tribunal, that the same\n\n 10\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nhave not been followed, on one hand the contentions and\ndocuments produced by the Petitioner have been ignored and\non the other hand, the contentions urged by the Respondent\nNo.1, though false, baseless, untenable, contrary to record,\ncontrary to evidence on record, have been plainly accepted\nwithout reasoning based on the misinterpretation,\nmisrepresentation of facts, evidence and applicable law, that\nthe Rules of the proceedings have been laid down prior to the\ncommencement of trial, that the Tribunal has unilaterally\nchanged the Rules at the time of the Award by holding that the\nburden of proof pales into insignificance at Para 27 of the\nAward, that there is no such concept in law, that the Rules and\nprocedure as agreed between the parties cannot be changed\npost the Arbitration, that such a change if at all was sought to\nbe made ought to have been informed to the Petitioner which\nhas not been done, that therefore, the vested right in the\nPetitioner has been taken away by the Tribunal thereby violating\nthe principles of natural justice which are inherent in an\nArbitration proceedings, that in terms of Rule 18 of the\nArbitration Centre, Karnataka (Domestic and International)\nRules 2012 it is required for the Tribunal to secure agreement of\nparties to dispense with formal proof of documents except in\ncase of questioned documents, that there being no such\nagreement, the said Rule had to be followed since the same\n\n 11\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nwas not followed the Award liable to be quashed, that the\nTribunal ought to have applied the principles of burden of proof\nand onus of proof form a substantial portion of Arbitration\nproceedings and the Tribunal ought to have acted in accordance\nwith the issue as framed and not travel beyond it or dilute the\nissues in the matter as done, that this is violative of public\npolicy, unknown to judicial procedure and amounts to Judicial\nmalafide on part of the Arbitrator, on this ground alone the\naward is liable to be set aside.\n\n16.b. In this aspect, it is to be noted that in the decision\nreported in A.I.R. - 1988 - S.C. - 1340 (\nIndian Oil\nCorporation vs. Indian Carbon Ltd\n), it is held as follows:-\n\n \"It is one thing to say that reasons should be stated\nand another thing to state that a detailed judgment is to\nbe given in support of an award. Even if it be held it is\nobligatory to state the reason, it is not obligatory to\ngive a detailed judgment\".\n\n16.c. A similar view was also taken by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the decision reported in A.I.R. - 1989 - S.C.\n\n- 973 (\nGujarat Water Supply vs. Unique Erectors\n).\n\n16.d. Similar views were expressed by Full Bench (5 Hon'ble\nJudges Bench) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision\nreported in A.I.R. - 1991 - S.C. - 2089 (\nGoa, Daman & Diu\n\n 12\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nHousing Board vs. Ramakant V.P. Darvotkar\n), wherein the\nHon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:-\n\n \" There is however nothing to show that the awards\nhave been improperly procured. There is no allegation,\nfar less, any finding, that the Arbitrator was biased or\nunfair or he has not heard both the parties or he has not\nfairly considered the submission of the parties in\nmaking the award in question. In our opinion, it is\nevident from the four awards made by the Arbitrator,\nthat the Arbitrator has considered the submission of the\nparties in making the award in question. In our opinion,\nit is evident from the four awards made by the\nArbitrator, that the Arbitrator has considered all the\nrelevant issues raised by the parties in the Arbitrator\nproceedings and came to his finding after giving cogent\nreasons. The above award cannot under any\ncircumstances be considered to be made by the\nArbitrator without recording any reasons for the same.\nTherefore, in such circumstances, it is not proper to hold\nthat the Arbitrator has misconducted himself or the\nproceedings in the matter of giving the awards\".\n\n16.e. In another decision reported in 2014 (9) - S.C.C. -\n212 (\nAnand Brothers Private Limited vs. Union of India\nand Others\n), at Para No. 12 has considered and decided the\nphrase 'finding' and in Para No. 13 defined the phrase\n\"conclusion\" and further regarding the finding and speaking\norder the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para No. 14 has held as under:-\n\n 13\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n \"It is trite that a finding can be both; a finding of\nfact or a finding of law........This is the rule also in the\ncase of finding of fact where too the process of\nreasoning must be disclosed in order that it is accepted\nas a finding in the sense the expression is used in\nClause 70\".\n\n16.f. In the present case also though there is a contention\nof the Petitioner that the Tribunal has changed the Rules of\nproceedings at the time of passing the award, there is no\nallegation about any other aspects. The Arbitrator has given\ncogent reasons and made detailed discussions in the Impugned\nAward. Therefore, in view of the ratio of aforesaid decisions, it\nhas to be examined by perusing of the Impugned Award\nwherein the learned Arbitrator dealt with each and every claim\nseparately and recorded the reasoning for allowing or\ndisallowing the claim. Hence, as per the ratio of the above\ndecisions, the said contentions of the Petitioner cannot be\naccepted. The award cannot be set aside on the said ground.\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-\nsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n 14\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n17. The Fifth ground is that the Impugned Award has been\npassed in contravention of terms of the agreement and on a\nfundamental misconception of evidence and ignoring the\nmaterial evidence.\n\n17.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Impugned Award is in contravention to the Letter of\nIntent entered into between the parties, that the Award being\ncontrary to terms of the contract the same is to be interfered\nwith the ground that it is patently illegal and is opposed to\nPublic Policy of India, that the Tribunal being a creature of the\ncontract, ought to act only in terms of the contract and could\nnot travel beyond it, that the Tribunal ought to strictly apply the\nterms of the contract in arriving at a decision in regard to the\nmatter in dispute, that the Tribunal could not have traveled\nbeyond the terms of the contract.\n\n17.b. On perusal of the Impugned Award with the terms of\nthe contract between the parties, it cannot be held that the\nlearned Arbitrator has completely ignored the terms of the\ncontract and traveled beyond all the terms of the contract while\ninterpreting the same.\n\n 15\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n17.c. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The findings of fact by the Arbitral Tribunal, if based on\nevidence, even where a different opinion can be held on the\nbasis of that evidence, the findings given by the Arbitrator has\nto be accepted and the Courts cannot substitute its opinion. The\npower to interpret the contract also lies with the Arbitrator. If\nthe Arbitrator interpreted the terms of contract in a particular\nway based on the material before him and the evidence\nadduced before him, even if another view is possible to be\ntaken on the same materials and evidence, the Court cannot\ninterfere the said findings of the learned Arbitrator, as held by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in 2009(6)\n\n- S.C.C. - 414 (\nG.Ramachandra Reddy & Company vs.\nUnion of India & another\n), wherein it is held that the\ninterpretation of a contract will fall within the realm of\narbitrator, that the Court while dealing with an award would not\nre-appreciate the evidence, that an award containing reasons\nmay not be interfered unless they are found to be perverse or\n\n 16\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nbased on a wrong proposition of law.\n \nIn another decision\nreported in 2009 (10) - S.C.C. - 63 (\nSteel Authority of\nIndia Limited vs. Gupta Brothers Steel Tubes Limited\n), it\nis held that once the arbitrator has constructed Clause 7.2 of\nthe contract of the said case, in a particular manner and such\nconstruction is not absurd and appears to be plausible, it is not\nopen to the Court to interfere with the award of the arbitrator.\n\n17.d. For the same principle, I wish to refer another\ndecision reported in 2019 (7) - S.C.C. - 236 (\nParsa Kenta\nCollieries Limited vs. Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan\nNigam Limited\n). Once the courts reach to the conclusion that\nthe Arbitrator has acted within its jurisdiction, even if the courts\nare of the view that the opinion of the arbitrator is wrong the\nsame cannot be disturbed unless it is against the public policy.\n\n17.e. Therefore, an award warrants interference by the\nCourt under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act\nonly when it contravenes a substantive provision of law or is\npatently illegal or shocks the conscious of the Court and that a\nplausible/reasonable view taken by an Arbitrator, even if the\nsame is based on insufficient evidence, is not to be substituted\nby the Court. Hence, this ground is not available for the\nPetitioner under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\n\n 17\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and rejected.\n\n18. The Sixth ground is that the learned Arbitrator ignored\nthe arguments and has gone beyond the pleadings and\nevidence.\n\n18.a. This is also a general ground and the same will be\ndiscussed along with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.\n\n19. The Seventh ground is that the claim of the 1 st\nRespondent about the alleged dues until RA Bill 4 allegedly\ncertified has no support of any evidence and the same was\nawarded which is contrary to the evidence and pleadings.\n\n19.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat though the 1st Respondent has prayed for Rs.91,83,693/-\ntowards the alleged dues until RA Bill No.4 allegedly certified,\nwithout any evidence about the certification, the Tribunal has\nawarded Rs. 1,30,62,323/-, towards Bill No. 1 to 4. It is to be\nnoted that as already discussed by me, the learned Arbitrator\nhas discussed the contentions and evidence of both parties in\nthe Impugned Award. If any, calculation mistakes crept in the\naward, this court cannot interfere about the same in this\n\n 18\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nproceedings. Therefore, there are no grounds to accept the said\ncontentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this ground is not available\nfor the Petitioner under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and rejected.\n\n20. The Eighth ground is that the learned Arbitrator could\nnot have considered the so called RA Bill 1 to 4 in the absence\nof satisfying the requirements of Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36.\n\n20.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat RA Bills 1 to 4 to be running bills in the absence of them\nsatisfying the requirements of Ex.P.1, LOI, Ex.P.2 and Ex.R.36,\nthat there is absolutely no finding by the Tribunal that the\nabove conditions precedent have been satisfied, that such\nbeing the case the so called RA Bill 1 to 4 could have not even\nbeen considered by the Tribunal.\n\n20.b. This ground is more or less similar to that of seventh\nground. Hence, for the same reasons, the contentions of the\nPetitioner cannot be accepted. Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\n\n 19\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n21. The Ninth ground is that the learned Arbitrator could\nnot have considered the so called RA Bill No.5 in the absence of\nsatisfying the requirements of Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36, and by\nrelying on Ex.P.76 only.\n\n21.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat as regards prayer at Sl. No.3 Page 18 of the Award towards\nthe alleged 5th RA Bill, the claim made by the 1 st Respondent\nwas for a sum of Rs. 32,34,127/- which has been awarded by\nthe Tribunal, that while doing so, the Tribunal has considered\nEx.P.76 being the e-mail of an Excel Sheet as a RA Bill and not\nconsidered the requirements under Ex.P.1, LOI, Ex.P.2, BOQ and\nEx.R.36, that without first satisfying the requirements of a RA\nBill, Ex.P.76 could not be considered to be a RA Bill, that apart\nthere is no certification of Ex.P.76 by the PMC nor as the 1 st\nRespondent claimed for such certification, that Ex.P.76 adds\nback all the deductions made by PMC, that the award directing\nthe payment towards the alleged RA Bill No.5 in the form of\nExcel Sheet is liable to be set aside.\n\n 20\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n21.b. The learned Advocate for the 1st Respondent has\nargued that the Petitioner denied the submission of RA Bill No.5\nby the 1st Respondent to PMC, that the RA Bill No.5 was sent by\nthe 1st Respondent to PMC on 04.12.2013, that since there was\nno communication from the PMC, the 1 st Respondent sent one\nmore copy of RA Bill No.5 on 06.12.2013 to PMC through e-mail\nas per Ex.P.76, that PMC has not certified the payment claimed\nby the 1st Respondent in RA Bill No.5.\n\n21.c. The same aspect is once again agitated at twelfth\nground. About the factual aspect, I shall discuss about the same\nwhile answering the twelfth ground. However, the aspect about\nsending the RA Bill through e-mail as per Ex.P.76 is concerned,\nthough the same is not in terms of the contract between the\nparties, the same is to be considered in the light of provisions of\n\nInformation Technology Act\n. With regard to the said aspect, I\nnow discuss about the same.\n\n21.d. \nSections 4\n and \n6\n of the Information Technology Act,\n2000 provide for legal recognition of electronic records and\ntheir use in Government and its agencies. Section10-A of the\nsaid Act specifically provides for validity of contract through\nelectronic means and accordingly provides that such contract\nshall not be deemed to be unenforceable solely on the ground\n\n 21\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nthat such electronic form or means was used for that purpose.\n\nSection 12\n of the said Act provides for acknowledgment of\nreceipt including in an automated manner. \nSection 13\n of the\nsaid Act provides for time and place of dispatch and receipt of\nelectronic records. Upon careful consideration of all these\nprovisions, it is seen that electronic records have been provided\nwith full legal recognition.\n\n21.e. Under the provisions of the \nInformation Technology Act,\n2000\n particularly Section 10-A, an electronic contract is valid and\nenforceable, which states as follows:-\n\n \"Section 10-A: Validity of contracts formed through\nelectronic means:- Where in a contract formation, the\ncommunication of proposals, the acceptance of\nproposals, the revocation of proposals and acceptances,\nas the case may be, are expressed in electronic form or\nby means of an electronic record, such contract shall not\nbe deemed to be unenforceable solely on the ground\nthat such electronic form or means was used for that\npurpose.\"\n\n21.f. E-Contracts can be entered into through modes of\ncommunication such as e-mail, internet and fax. The only\nessential requirement to validate an E-Contract is compliance with\nthe necessary pre-requisites provided under the \nIndian Contract\nAct, 1872\n.\n\n 22\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n21.g. The evidentiary value of e-contracts can be well\nunderstood in the light of the Sections 85A, 85B, 88A, 90A and\n85C deals with the presumptions as to electronic records whereas\nSection 65B relates to the admissibility of electronic record. In the\npresent case, there is no dispute about the admissibility of various\ne-mails exchanged between the parties.\n\n21.h. Formation of contracts online via emails has been\nrecognized and given validity to by the Indian courts time and\nagain. In the decision reported in 2010(1) - SCALE - 57 (Trimex\nInternational FZE Limited, Dubai vs. Vendata Aluminium\nLtd.), the parties thoroughly agreed to the terms of the contract\nvia emails. The Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the validity of this\ncontract and further held as follows:-\n\n \"Once the contract is concluded orally or in writing,\nthe mere fact that a formal contract has to be prepared\nand initiated by the parties would not affect either the\nacceptance of the contract so entered into or\nimplementation thereof, even if the formal contract has\nnever been initiated.\"\n\n21.i. In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court after going\nthrough the various E-mails exchanged between the parties\nincluding an E-mail attaching the draft contract, which remained\nunsigned, opined as follows:-\n\n 23\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n \"44. From the materials placed, it has to be\nascertained whether there exists a valid contract with\nthe arbitration clause. It is relevant to note that on 15-\n\n10-2007 at 4.26 p.m. the petitioner submitted a\ncommercial offer wherein Clause 6 contains the\narbitration clause i.e. \"this contract is governed by\nIndian law and arbitration in Mumbai courts\". At 5.34\np.m. though the respondents offered their comments, as\nrightly pointed out by Mr. K.K. Venugopal, no comments\nwere made in respect of the \"arbitration clause\". It is\nfurther seen that at 6.04 p.m., the petitioner sent a\nreply to the comments made by the respondent. Again,\non 16-10-2007 at 11.28 a.m., though the respondents\nsuggested certain additional information on the offer\nnote, here again no suggestion was made with regard to\nthe arbitration clause...........\".\n\n21.j. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in\n(2001) 7 - S.C.C. - 328 (\nSmita Conductors Limited vs. Euro\nAlloys Limited\n), has commented about two contracts and held\nthat one of the party had in his mind those contracts while\nopening the letters of credit and while addressing the letters to the\nbank in that regard and had also invoked force majuere clause in\nthose contracts which would obviously mean that the parties had\nin their mind those two contracts which stood formed by those\nletters of credit. It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that if two\ncontracts stood affirmed by reason of conduct of the parties as\nindicated in the letters exchanged, it must be held that there was\nan agreement in writing between the parties in that regard.\n The\n\n 24\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nsaid judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was specifically\napproved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its subsequent above-\nmentioned decision reported in 2010(1) - SCALE - 57 (Trimex\nInternational FZE Limited, Dubai vs. Vendata Aluminium\nLtd.).\n\n21.k. In another decision reported in (2009) 2 - S.C.C. -\n134 (\nShakti Bhog Foods Ltd. vs. Kola Shipping Ltd.\n), the\nHon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:-\n\n \"The existence of an arbitration agreement can be\ninferred from a document signed by the parties, or an\nexchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of\ntelecommunication, which provide a record of the\nagreement\".\n\n21.l. Therefore, the correspondence through email can be\nconsidered as a valid binding agreement/contract between the\nparties and hence, the contention of the Petitioner that Ex.P.76 is\nonly an e-mail sent through Excel Sheet cannot be accepted at all.\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-\nsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n 25\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n22. The Tenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has not\ntaken into account that towards the Bank Guarantee\nmobilization advance has been released and that the same has\nnot been completely recovered, which is contrary to terms of\ncontract.\n\n22.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has referred\nto Sl. No.9 at Page No. 18 of the Award. In the said page at Para\nNo. 29 the learned Arbitrator has mentioned the prayer in Claim\nPetition as well as in the counter-claim of the Petitioner. There is\nno discussion about the claims referred to in the said\nparagraph. When such being the case the said ground is itself is\nmisconception of facts. Even otherwise, as mentioned above,\nthe Impugned Award is a Speaking Order. There are no grounds\nto interfere the same. Hence, this ground is not available for the\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.\n\n23. The Eleventh ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nnot considered the purport and impact of the issues framed\nwhen the parties went to trial.\n\n 26\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n23.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has drawn my\nattention to Para No. 27 of the Impugned Award wherein the\nlearned Arbitrator has held that the parties have adduced\nevidence consciously knowing the crux of the dispute, that after\nhaving led the evidence consciously the burden of proof fails\ninto insignificance and has referred to a decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has\nargued that no such decision as mentioned by the learned\nArbitrator in the said paragraph. In fact, there is a mistake in\nmentioning the citation and also names of the parties. The\nprinciple of law as mentioned by the learned Arbitrator is well\nsettled. Such a principle is enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in the decision reported in A.I.R. -1960 - S.C. - 100\n(\nNarayan Bhagwantrao vs. Gopal Vinayak Gosavi And\nOthers\n). When such being the case, the learned Advocate for\nthe Petitioner cannot find fault with the learned Arbitrator for\nhaving mentioned an incorrect citation. Hence, this ground is\nnot available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n 27\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n24. The Twelfth ground is that the Rules of proceedings\nlaid down to prior to commencement of trial has unilaterally\nchanged at the time of the award by holding that the burden of\nproof fails into insignificance at Para No. 27 of the award.\n\n24.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat It is a matter of fact and record that the Respondent No.1\nhas not produced or led any evidence in respect of the claims,\nthat it is also a matter of fact and record that the Respondent\nNo.1 did not even produce the RA Bills before the Tribunal and,\nin fact, they were got confronted by the Petitioner during cross-\nexamination of PW.1, that the principles as enshrined under\n\nSection 101\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 have not even\nbeen applied by the Respondent No.1, that it is for the\nRespondent No.1 to have led positive evidence that it had\ndischarged its obligations as required in terms of Ex.R.36 and\nEx.P.1, that even a thorough reading of the Affidavit in-lieu of\nevidence filed by the Respondent No.1 would establish that no\nevidence is on record by the Respondent No.1 on this aspect,\nthat the principles enunciated in the Civil Procedure Code and\nthe Indian Evidence Act are applicable to an arbitral\nproceedings as \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nand various other Courts, that it is therefore required that the\nTribunal applies the principles enunciated under Section 101 to\n\n \n28\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n104 ought to have been discharged by Respondent No.1, that\ntherefore, the burden of proof that the bills were submitted in\nthe required manner and complied with Ex.R.36 is entirely on\nthe Respondent No.1 which has not been discharged, that the\nburden of proof also vested with the Respondent No.1 since\nfailure to prove the above facts would result in a failure of the\nRespondent No.1's claim, that the aspect of whether the bills\nhad been submitted in the required format with the required\nenclosures is in the sole custody and prerogative of Respondent\nNo.1 , that the Respondent No.1 not having led any evidence in\nthis regard has failed in discharging its burden of proof, that this\ncrucial aspect has also been ignored by the Tribunal, that in\nspite of the same having been argued, brought to the notice of\nthe Tribunal and the Tribunal having recorded the same from\nPara 12 Page 7 to Para 20 Page 12 of the Impugned Order, that\nTribunal has misdirected itself as regards the role of CBRE,\nbeing a PMC and adverted to the document relating to\nappointment of CBRE and has given a finding that CBRE is the\nlawful custodian of the original RA Bills, that Tribunal has not\ngiven any finding as to whether the Respondent No.1 has\ndischarged its obligations and the demands made by the PMC.\n\n24.b. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has relied on\na decision reported in (2011) 12 - S.C.C. - 220 (Rangammal\n\n 29\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nvs. Kuppusamy and another), wherein it is held that the\n\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872\n has clearly laid down that the burden\nof proving the fact always lies upon a person who asserts it,\nthat unless such burden is discharged, the other party is not\nrequired to be called upon to prove its case, that the court has\nto examine as to whether the person upon whom the burden\nlies has been able to discharge its burden, that unless he\narrives at such a conclusion, he cannot proceed on the basis of\nweakness of the other party. Relying on the said decision, the\nlearned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued that this\nprinciple has also been ignored by the Tribunal.\n\n24.c. He has further argued that the Tribunal applied a\nwrong position of law to the present case thereby rendering the\nentire award, contrary to fundamental public policy of the\ncountry, that such a wrong finding has resulted in the Tribunal\ncommitting a further illegality of passing an award in favour of\nthe Respondent.\n\n24.d. I have discussed about this aspect while answering\nninth ground above. In fact, the learned Arbitrator after\ndiscussing the contentions and arguments of both parties, has\ndiscussed at Para No. 26 at Page No.16 of the Award, that the\nPetitioner has denied the receipt of Ex.P.76/RA Bill No.5, that\n\n 30\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nEx.P.76 was submitted with an e-mail letter dated 06.12.2013,\nin respect work executed during the period from 24.09.2013 to\n30.11.2013, that as per Ex.R.91, CBRE alone was expected to\nbe verified the RA Bills and to make certification recommending\nfor payment, that if RA Bill No.5 is not processed through the\nPMC then the best person who could have spoken about the\nnon-submission of Ex.P.76 is the engineer or official of CBRE and\nin view of the non-examination of the said engineer and official\nand in view of the receipt of Ex.P.76 is not seriously disputed in\nthe evidence of RW.1, he has answered Issue No.5 in the\nAffirmative. When such being the case, the said finding cannot\nbe considered as perverse or illegal. Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n25. The Thirteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas not examined whether the 1st Respondent has submitted\nthe running bills in the required form with all supporting\ndocuments.\n\n 31\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n25.a. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n26. The Fourteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas blindly awarded amounts more than claimed and rejected\nthe deductions made by the PMC without any basis.\n\n26.a. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re-appreciate and re-evaluate\n\n 32\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n27. The Fifteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nnot referred to the cross-examination of PW.1 thereby rendering\nthe entire cross-examination otiose.\n\n27.a. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\n\n 33\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n28. The Sixteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nturned the law of evidence by holding that the Petitioner ought\nto have led the evidence of PMC to enable the Respondent No.1\nto post questions in the cross-examination of said PMC, that the\nsaid finding being contrary to the legal aspects.\n\n28.a. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect\nwhile answering twelfth ground above. In addition to the same\nit is to be noted that Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-appreciate and re-\n\n 34\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n29. The Seventeenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas ignored the fact that if at all the 1 st Respondent wanted to\nlead evidence of PMC there was nothing preventing him for\nsummoning the said PMC as a witness.\n\n29.a. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect\nwhile answering twelfth ground above. In addition to the same\nit is to be noted that \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\n\n 35\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nAct, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and\nre-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n30. The Eighteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas not considered that there were discrepancies in the\nsubmission of RA Bills and that in spite of RA Bills having been\nre-submitted several times, the discrepancies were not cleared.\n\n30.a. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\n\n 36\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n31. The Nineteenth ground is that until the submission of\nRA Bill with all requirements satisfying the terms of the\ncontract, Ex.R.36, the submissions could not be held to be\ncomplete and proper.\n\n31.a. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect\nwhile answering twelfth ground above. In addition to the same\nit is to be noted that \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\n\n 37\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nAct, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and\nre-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n32. The Twentieth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas treated both the parties unequally by permitting the 1 st\nRespondent to produce documents after completion of evidence\nand rejected the similar prayer of the Petitioner.\n\n32.a. By elaborating the arguments on this ground, the\nlearned Advocate for the Petitioner has also relied on a decision\n\n 38\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nreported in 2008 (13) - S.C.C. - 80 (\nDDA vs. R.S. Sharma &\nCo.\n), and has argued that the learned Arbitrator has not given\nequal treatment to both parties. On perusal of the Arbitral\nRecords, the learned Arbitrator has recorded the evidence of\nPW.1 on behalf of the 1st Respondent and RW.1 and 2 on behalf\nof the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent has produced Ex.P.1 to\nEx.P.117 and the Petitioner has produced Ex.R.1 to Ex.R.94. The\nlearned Arbitrator has considered the said oral and\ndocumentary evidence in the Impugned Award. Just because he\nhas not permitted the Petitioner to produce additional\ndocuments as prayed by him in the Application dated\n16.04.2015, as per the Orders dated 05.06.2015, it cannot be\nconsidered that the learned Arbitrator has not given equal\ntreatment to both parties. In order to find out the equal\ntreatment the entire proceedings conducted by the learned\nArbitrator has to be taken into consideration. When such being\nthe case the said contention of the Petitioner cannot be\naccepted. Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner\nunder Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by\nthe Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\nthis ground is thwarted and rejected.\n\n 39\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n33. The Twenty First ground is that the learned Arbitrator\non the one hand has held that the adhoc payment advice of the\nPMC is certification thereby holding that the Petitioner had to\nmake payments to the 1st Respondent in terms thereof and on\nthe other hand indicates that the deduction made by the PMC\nwithout any reasoning, basis or evidence on record.\n\n33.a. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make re-\nappreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned\nArbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\n\n 40\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n34. The Twenty Second ground is that the mere reading\nof Issue No.5 that it is for the 1 st Respondent to prove that RA\nBills were submitted as per the required format agreed upon\nthat all the supporting documents required to be submitted as\nagreed upon between the parties, and that if the same had not\nbeen submitted as per Item No. 4 and 5 of Ex.P.1 and the\nextracted portion of Ex.R.6 had not been complied, there was a\nviolation and Issue No.5 ought to have been answered in favour\nof the Petitioner.\n\n34.a. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make re-\nappreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned\nArbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\n\n 41\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n35. The Twenty Third ground is that a mere perusal of the\nappreciation of Issue No.5 at Para No.11 Page No. 6 to Para\nNo.27 at Page No.17 would establish that the learned Arbitrator\nhas not applied the terms of the contract while dealing with the\nsaid issue.\n\n35.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat a mere perusal of the appreciation of Issue No.5 would\ncategorically and unimpeachably establish that the Tribunal has\nnot applied the terms of the contract while dealing with\nappreciating the said issue, that the Tribunal though at Para\nNo.11 Page No. 7 extracted the requirements no finding has\nbeen given in respect of the said requirements.\n\n 42\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n35.b. So far as the interpretation of terms of contracts by\nthe learned Arbitrator, I have already discussed while answering\ntwelfth ground above. For the same reasons, the contentions of\nthe Petitioner on this ground also cannot be accepted. Hence,\nthis ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n36. The Twenty Fourth ground is that instead of\nexamining the requirements under Ex.R.36, the learned\nArbitrator has misdirected as regards the role of PMC and\nadverted to the document relating to appointment of CBRE and\nhas given a finding that CBRE is the lawful custodian of the RA\nBills.\n\n36.a. About this ground, the learned Advocate for the\nPetitioner has argued about the burden of proof lies on the 1 st\nRespondent since failure to prove the said aspect would result\nin a failure of the claim of the 1 st Respondent, that the aspect of\nwhether the bills had been submitted in the require enclosures\nis in the sole custody and prerogative of the 1 st Respondent,\nthat the 1st Respondent not having led any evidence in this\n\n 43\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nregard has failed in discharging its burden of proof and this\naspect has been ignored by the learned Arbitrator. With this\nbackground if this ground is read, this ground is in the nature\nand tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to\nmake re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the\nlearned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and\nre-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n37. The Twenty Fifth ground is that at Para No.11 of the\naward, the learned Arbitrator though refers to the letter dated\n\n 44\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n25.06.2013, calling upon the 1st Respondent to furnish\ndocuments with the RA Bills he has not given any finding has to\nwhether the 1st Respondent has discharged its obligations and\ndemands made by the PMC.\n\n37.a. About this ground, the learned Advocate for the\nPetitioner has argued about the burden of proof lies on the 1 st\nRespondent for production of RA Bills and satisfaction of the\nrequirements of Ex.R.36 and that this aspect has been ignored\nby the learned Arbitrator. With this background if this ground is\nread, this ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order\nto answer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the\nevidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the\nfindings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The\nSuperior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible\nto a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the\narbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The\nnature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary\nin nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara\nNidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\n\n 45\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n38. The Twenty Sixth ground is that at Para No. 12 to 19 of\nthe Award, though has referred to the dates of submission and\nre-submission of the RA Bills, has not appreciated the fact that\nsuch re-submissions were necessitated on account of improper\nsubmissions and non-compliance of Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36.\n\n38.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat it is a facts on record which cannot be ascertained by a\nperusal of Ex.R.4, Ex.R.6, Ex.R.7 which are the copies of the Bills\nobtained from the PMC which would categorically indicate and\nestablish that the requirement as stated in Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36\nhad not been complied while submitting the RA Bills. With this\nbackground if this ground is read, this ground is in the nature\nand tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to\nmake re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the\nlearned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and\nre-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n 46\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n39. The Twenty Seventh ground is that the learned\nArbitrator has completely misconstrued the recommendation\nmade by the PMC for adhoc payments to the certification of the\nRA Bills.\n\n39.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the 1st Respondent submitted insufficient, incomplete,\ninadequate false bills, that the said bills were returned from\ntime to time by the PMC, that with an intention to keep the\nworks going and not to cause stoppage of work, the PMC had\n\n 47\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nrecommended certain adhoc payments, that such\nrecommendation does not amount to certification of the RA\nBills, that none of the RA Bills has been certified by the PMC and\nthat there is no such certification on record. \nIn support of said\narguments, he has relied on the decision reported in 2009 (2) -\nS.C.C. - 606 (\nU.P. State Electricity Board and Another vs.\nAziz Ahamad\n), wherein it is held that pleadings are required to\nbe proved by leading evidence. The learned counsel submitted\nthat where evidence is not led by a party in support of the\npleadings no reliance can be placed only on the pleadings\nwithout there being any cogent evidence in support of the\npleadings.\n\n39.b. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect\nwhile answering Ground No. 11 and 12 above. For the same\nreasons, I cannot accept the said contentions of the Petitioner.\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-\nsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n40. The Twenty Eighth ground is that the learned\nArbitrator has misapplied in holding that the claim of Rs.\n\n 48\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n3,31,03,442/- is towards the work done in terms of the contract,\nthat the said claim is on account of interest and idle charges,\nloss of material, bank guarantee etc.\n\n40.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has drawn my\nattention to the table reproduced by the Tribunal at Page No. 18\nof the Award and has argued that the same would indicate that\nthe said claim is an account of interest and idle charges,\ndemurrage, loss of material, bank guarantee etc., that the claim\nas regards the work done is only at Sl. No.1 at Page No. 18 for\nthe balance for Rs. 91,83,693/-.\n\n40.b. On perusal of said table along with the submission of\nthe Advocate for the Petitioner is concerned, in order to answer\nthis ground, I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence\nadduced before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the\nfindings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The\nSuperior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible\nto a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the\narbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The\nnature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary\n\n 49\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nin nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara\nNidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n41. The Twenty Ninth ground is that the reasoning given\nby the Tribunal establishes that instead of ascertaining whether\nthe 1st Respondent has proved its case, the Tribunal has sought\nto ascertain the veracity of the defence of the 1 st Respondent.\n\n41.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Tribunal has patently erred and has not adopting a\njudicial approach while dealing with the question, it has ignored\nmost material evidence has not applied its mind to all the\nrelevant facts and circumstances, that the Tribunal has not\nadopted a judicial approach, has completely ignored this\nevidence, that the Tribunal has completely failed to adopt a\njudicial approach while dealing with Issue No. 1 to 3, has acted\narbitrarily, capriciously, ignored material pieces of evidence and\n\n 50\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nhas not at all applied its mind to all the material on record, that\nthe award suffers from patent errors and contradictory.\n\n41.b. If this ground is read, it is about the allegation against\nthe learned Arbitrator about the appreciation of evidence at\nIssue No. 1 to 3 and hence, this ground is in the nature and\ntenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make\nre-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned\nArbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n 51\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n42. The Thirtieth ground is that the entire reasoning as\nregards the submissions of bill and required format at Para No.\n33 and 34 of the Award is misconceived and contrary to the\nfacts on record, that the findings is on the basis of inferences by\nthe Tribunal rather than on the basis of facts and documents,\nthat the recommendation made for adhoc payment by PMC has\nbeen regarded to be certification by the Tribunal which is\ncontrary to the records.\n\n42.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Tribunal committed manifest and grave error by\nholding that the 1st Respondent is lawful custody of all the\ndocuments and the certificate, that the assertions have been\nmade by the 1st Respondent, it was for the 1st Respondent to\nprove these facts and assertions, that the Tribunal having\naccepted that the revised bill was submitted on 24.06.2013\ncould not have taken any other date for the purpose of arriving\nat the date of payment, that having considered that the bill was\nsubmitted on 24.06.2013, the Tribunal ought to have\nascertained whether bill was in the form agreed between the\nparties, that the Tribunal has disregarded the assertion made by\nthe 1st Respondent in his pleadings as also in evidence that the\npayment were made in adhoc manner for going on with the\nwork and not to effect the work at site.\n\n 52\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n42.b. If this ground is read, it is about the allegation against\nthe learned Arbitrator about the appreciation of evidence about\nthe revised bill submitted on 24.06.2013 and hence, this ground\nis in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this\nground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced\nbefore the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-\nappreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the\nArbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the\nArbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have\nrepeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine\nthe correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in the\ndecision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 =\n(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.\n\n 53\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n43. The Thirty First ground is that the Tribunal at Para No.\n34 commits a grave error by referring to an I.A. filed by the 1 st\nRespondent on 16.04.2015 under which the 1 st Respondent had\nsought for certain documents as if to hold that the 1 st\nRespondent is required to produce documents when in fact the\nTribunal has dismissed the said application by way of its Order\ndated 05.06.2015.\n\n43.a. I have already discussed about this aspect while\nanswering twentieth ground above. For the same reasons, I\ncannot accept the said contentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n44. The Thirty Second ground is that the findings of the\nTribunal at Para No 35 that the inadequacy pointed out by CBRE\nto the 1st Respondent were complied with while furnishing\nremaining bills is contrary to those remaining bills.\n\n44.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the inadequacy continued in the remaining bills, that\n\n 54\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nhaving arrived at a conclusion that there were inadequacies in\nRA Bill No.1, that the Tribunal could not have held that there\nwas delay on the part of the Petitioner in making payments of\nmoney, that the finding that there were separate adhoc\nrecommendation and certification is not borne out by any\nrecords.\n\n44.b. If this ground is read, it is about the appreciation of\nthe Tribunal about the inadequacy pointed out by the CBRE\nwhile furnishing remaining bills and hence, this ground is in the\nnature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I\nhave to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before\nthe learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-\nappreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the\nArbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the\nArbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have\nrepeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine\nthe correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in the\ndecision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 =\n(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\n 55\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.\n\n45. The Thirty Third ground is that at Para No. 36, the\nTribunal committed grave errors in holding that the adhoc\nrecommendation was a final certification and by accepting the\ncontention of the 1st Respondent that the sum of Rs. 9,61,906/-\nwhich was withheld could not have been withheld.\n\n45.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Tribunal has not referred Ex.R.6, Ex.R.7, Ex.R.11 in\nrespect of the said aspect, that thus the finding that a sum of\nRs. 28,63,944/- was due from the Petitioner, to the 1 st\nRespondent is bereft of any merits and contrary to any records,\nthat there is no basis for the same and such a finding is\ncontrary to the contractual document available before the\nTribunal, that the Tribunal could not have gone beyond the\ncontract to arrive at such a finding, that the Tribunal had a duty\nto implement the contract as it is and not on the basis of any\ninferences.\n\n 56\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n45.b. If this ground is read, it is about the appreciation of\nthe Tribunal about the withholding of sum of Rs.9,61,906/- by\nthe Petitioner and hence, this ground is in the nature and tenor\nof appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make re-\nappreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned\nArbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n 57\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n46. The Thirty Fourth ground is that the finding at Para\nNo. 37 relating to RA Bill 3 is contrary to the records and the\ncontract.\n\n46.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Tribunal having observed that the RA Bill No.3 was\nraised for an amount Rs. 73,85,862/- but final certification was\nmade for Rs. 15,18,466/- would itself establishes the malafides\non the part of the 1st Respondent which the Tribunal ought to\nhave taken note of, that on the one hand the Tribunal contends\nthat the payment advice is certification and it has to be\naccepted in totality and on the other hand the Tribunal has\nsought to find faults with the said payment advice, that the\nTribunal ought not to have traveled beyond the references\nmade and the contentions urged to arrive such a finding, that\nthis being without prejudice to the fact that there was no\ncertification was made by the PMC and all these payments were\nadhoc payments and further even while recommending\npayments it had been categorically stated that the required\ndocuments have not been submitted with the bills.\n\n46.b. I have already discussed about adhoc payment\ncertification by PMC while answering earlier grounds. I need not\nprolong my discussion to avoid repetition. For the same\n\n 58\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nreasons, I cannot accept the said contentions of the Petitioner.\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-\nsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n47. The Thirty Fifth ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal at Para No. 38 relates to RA Bill 4 that the same was\ninitially raised for Rs. 98,06,902/- and submitted to CBRE on\n09.10.2013 and according to the Tribunal the same was\ncertified by PMC on 11.11.2013 for a sum of Rs. 35,03,878/-,\nthat the Tribunal comes to wrong conclusion that in the said\npayment advice a sum of Rs. 31,43,813/- is stated to have been\npaid.\n\n47.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat all these findings are dehors the documents on evidence\non record and or not supported by any evidence, that in the\ntable made out by the Tribunal the due amount is at Rs.\n1,30,62,320/- on account of RA Bill No.1 to 4, that this amount is\neven more than what is claimed by the 1 st Respondent, that this\nitself would indicate that the RA Bills submitted by the 1 st\nRespondent were completely confusing, not proper and do not\n\n 59\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nsatisfy the requirements of the contract, that the finding of the\nTribunal in respect of RA Bill No. 1 to 4 is a baseless inference\nand presumption on part of the Tribunal.\n\n47.b. If this ground is read, it is about the appreciation of\nthe Tribunal about the RA Bill No. 1 to 4 and hence, this ground\nis in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this\nground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced\nbefore the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-\nappreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the\nArbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the\nArbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have\nrepeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine\nthe correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in the\ndecision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 =\n(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.\n\n 60\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n48. The Thirty Sixth ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal at Para No. 39 that Ex.R.11 is a Bill containing\nvoluminous documents submitted by the 1 st Respondent is\nfalse.\n\n48.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Tribunal has ignored the fact that the 1 st Respondent\nhas not produced any documentary evidence which would\nsupport the claim of any amounts as claimed by the 1 st\nRespondent, that Ex.R.11 was submitted by the 1 st Respondent\nbut was confronted to the witness of the 1 st Respondent by the\nPetitioner, that while dealing with the aspects the deductions\nmade by the Tribunal instead of referring documents on record\nagain misapplied itself thereby misdirecting itself by holding\nthat any aspect relating to this evidence ought to have been led\nby the Petitioner through PMC, that the Tribunal failed to take\nnote of the fact that the 1st Respondent by not leading any\nevidence had not discharge the burden that it had carried out\nthe works in a proper manner, that instead the Tribunal\nwrongfully shifted the burden on the Petitioner which could not\nbe done under law, that though the Tribunal holds that the\ninadequacy and deficiency ought to have been made note of in\nthe daily progress report and the minutes of meeting, the\nTribunal has not considered the deduction made by CBRE itself,\n\n 61\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nit is not in dispute that CBRE had made such deduction, that the\nTribunal again misdirected itself by holding that the CBRE ought\nto have made note of it on the daily progress report when in\nfact daily progress report were submitted by the 1 st Respondent\nand not prepared by CBRE, that the various minutes of meeting\nhave categorically referred to the inadequacy of works carried\nout by the 1st Respondent and have not been looked into and\nhave been ignored by the Tribunal, that the documentary\nevidence being on record, the Tribunal misapplied itself by\nholding that the Engineers of the Petitioner ought to have been\nexamined, that the examination or otherwise of Mr. G. Ethiraj\nas a witness has nothing to do with the matter when the\ndocuments were on record and the correspondences on record\nindicated and established the facts, that it was for the 1 st\nRespondent to establish that it had carried out the works in a\nproper and required manner.\n\n48.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the\nAdvocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the\nappreciation of the Tribunal about Ex.R.11 and hence, this\nground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer\nthis ground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence\nadduced before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\n\n 62\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the\nfindings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The\nSuperior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible\nto a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the\narbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The\nnature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary\nin nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara\nNidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n49. The Thirty Seventh ground is that the finding a Para\nNo. 43 by the Tribunal is contradictory, that on the one hand it\nholds that the dewatering system was place and the works was\ngoing on as usual and on the other hand refers to CBRE\ninstructions to repair the damaged header lines.\n\n 63\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n49.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat if the header lines were damaged, the question of\ndewatering system working would not at all arise, that the\nMinutes of Meeting of 11.10.2013 were much after the 1 st\nRespondent abandoned the site on 18.09.2013, that the Daily\nProgress Report of 16 to 19 and 21.10.2013 do not include\nreference to any work done by the 1 st Respondent, that the\nTribunal has misdirected itself as regards this document.\n\n49.b. If this ground is read and the above arguments of the\nAdvocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding\nof the Tribunal in respect of Minutes of Meeting and the damage\ncaused to dewatering system and hence, this ground is in the\nnature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I\nhave to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before\nthe learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-\nappreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the\nArbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the\nArbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have\nrepeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine\nthe correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in the\n\n 64\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ndecision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 =\n(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.\n\n50. The Thirty Eighth ground is that the Tribunal\nmisapplied itself in Para No. 44 by holding that the CBRE would\nincorporate the deficiency in daily progress report will in fact\ndaily progress report were submitted by the 1 st Respondent and\nnot prepared by CBRE.\n\n50.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the entire reasoning in Para No.44 is contrary to evidence\nand contract between the parties, that it is not understood as to\non what basis the Tribunal has concluded that nothing escaped\nthe watchful eyes of the Engineers at site, that work was going\non at multiple places and the engineers were to supervise each\nand every work, all the time they were at site to broadly\nmanage the work, that the said engineers were not preparing\nany daily progress report, that the works done had to be\n\n 65\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ncertified by CBRE by furnishing necessary measurement sheets\nand documents which were not so furnished.\n\n50.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the\nAdvocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding\nof the Tribunal in respect of the Daily Progress Reports and\nhence, this ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order\nto answer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the\nevidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the\nfindings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The\nSuperior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible\nto a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the\narbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The\nnature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary\nin nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara\nNidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\n\n 66\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n51. The Thirty Ninth ground is that the Tribunal without\neven considering the documentary evidence on record has\ncome to a wrongful conclusion that an engineer of CBRE or\nPetitioner was to have been examined in the matter.\n\n51.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\n\n 67\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n52. The Fortieth ground is that the Tribunal has wrongly\ncome to a conclusion that PW.1 is a highly qualified person\nhaving rich experience in pile foundation when in fact the works\ncarried out as also his cross-examination would establish\notherwise.\n\n52.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings.

Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\n\n 68\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n53. The Forty First ground is that the Tribunal has not even\nlooked into the cross-examination PW.1.\n\n53.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong.

Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n 69\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n54. The Forty Second ground is that it is not known on\nwhat basis the Tribunal at Para No. 46 of the Award come to a\nconclusion that 32 dewatering pumps had been installed by the\n1st Respondent when in fact as per the records only 32 number\nof pumps had been installed.\n\n54.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the records which had been marked by the 1 st Respondent\nand produced along with RA Bill No. 3 and 4 would categorically\nand unimpeachably establish that the DG sets were switched off\nand not working, that when the DG sets were not working, the\npumps automatically switching on would not arise at all and\nhence the said finding is contrary to evidence and contractual\nagreement between the parties.\n\n54.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the\nAdvocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding\nof the Tribunal in respect of 32 dewatering pumps and hence,\nthis ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to\nanswer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the\nevidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the\n\n 70\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nfindings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The\nSuperior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible\nto a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the\narbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The\nnature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary\nin nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara\nNidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n55. The Forty Third ground is that the Tribunal has also\nignored several correspondences made by the Petitioner and\nthe PMC which were on record.\n\n55.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\n\n 71\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n56. The Forty Fourth ground is that the Tribunal has\nmisapplied and misdirected itself by holding that water gushed\nfrom Mantri Flora side when in fact water accumulated in the\nproperty of Mantri Flora on account of the improper works\ncarried out by the 1st Respondent which has been accepted and\nobserved by an independent surveyor.\n\n56.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the an insurance surveyor was appointed by the insurance\ncompany in terms of Ex.R.112, that the reports submitted\nthough available with the 1 st Respondent, the same was\nsuppressed by him, that the sewage pipe on which is on the\n\n 72\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\neastern side as nothing to do with the damaged caused on the\nwestern side, they being on opposite ends and separated by\nmore than 330 feet, that the Tribunal has completely misapplied\nitself and it appears that the facts have not been understood by\nthe Tribunal.\n\n56.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the\nAdvocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding\nof the Tribunal in respect of the direction of the sewage pipe as\nobserved by the Tribunal and hence, this ground is in the nature\nand tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to\nmake re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the\nlearned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and\nre-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\n\n 73\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n57. The Forty Fifth ground is that the Tribunal has\nmisdirected itself while appreciating Ex.P.111 being the letter\ndated 04.09.2013, sent by Mr. G Ethiraj to Mantri Flora\nComplex.\n\n57.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat it is a matter of fact and record that the Petitioner was\nsupporting the claim of the 1st Respondent in all manner\npossible in respect of the insurance claim and that the\nPetitioner was acting as per the information and instructions\nprovided by 1st Respondent, that the statements made both by\n1st Respondent and the Petitioner have been considered by an\nindependent insurance surveyor and the said surveyor has\nsubmitted his report after having conducted an analysis of the\nworks done whereas the letters at Ex.P.111 and Ex.P.114 were\nissued on the basis of instructions and information of the 1 st\nRespondent, that an expert in the field, appointed by the\ninsurance company, having come to a conclusion that the works\ncarried out by the Respondent No.1 were improper, not in\n\n 74\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\naccordance with the drawings as also the Engineering practice,\nthe report of the insurance surveyor ought to have been\naccepted by the Tribunal, more so, when such a finding as not\nbeen challenged by the insured, i.e. the 1 st Respondent from\n2014 till the date of award, that admittedly no steps have been\ntaken by the 1st Respondent to challenge the report which\nwould lease to an inescapable conclusion, that the report is\naccepted by the 1st Respondent, that the report being\nsubsequent to letters at Ex.P.111 and Ex.P.114, the question of\nthe subsequent report being watered down by earlier letters\nwould not at all arise, more so, when Ex.P.111 has been\nconsidered by the Insurance Surveyor.\n\n57.b. The learned Advocate for the 1st Respondent has\nargued that the dispute arose between the parties after the\nmishap which happened on the intervening night of the 3 rd and\n4th September 2013, when a portion of the compound wall of\nMantri Flora collapsed due to heavy rains causing damage to\ndewatering system and 64 piles, that in relation to which the 1 st\nRespondent had taken a CAR Policy (Ex.P.115), that the\nEx.P.111/Letter of Petitioner through Sri. G Ethiraj dated\n04.09.2013, which also forms part of Ex.P.115, clearly states\nthat the mishap happened on account of overflow on the\nwestern side, undertaking the existing foundation, that the\n\n 75\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nRW.2 submitted a report and as per that report he has\ncategorically admitted that the work executed by 1 st\nRespondent was in order and deflection of the piles on western\nside was on account of the sudden gush of water on the Mantri\nside, that having regard to the evidence of RW.2, on material\naspects has supported the case of the 1 st Respondent and there\ncan be no doubt about the quality of the work done by the 1 st\nRespondent, that the Petitioner who had admitted its liability in\nthe Ex.R.60/Letter dated 09.12.2013, had taken a U-Turn after\nthe loss assessed by the Surveyor, who had opined that it was a\nresult of bad engineering obviously referring to Ex.R.5, that\naccording to surveyor the piles were embedded in loose soil\ninstead of rock, that the letter dated 04.09.2013 written by the\nPetitioner (through Sri. Ethiraj to Mantri Flora) is a part of\nEx.P.115 and was referred to by the surveyor to prima facie\ncome to the conclusion that it was open to the Petitioner to\nproceed against Mantri Flora and not against the Insurance\ncompany, that however the surveyor found that the claim of the\ninsured for damage caused to 64 pile beams is established, but\nturned down on the basis of the letter dated 04.09.2013.\n\n57.c. This ground is more or less similar to that of Ground\nNo. 36. I have discussed about the contentions of both parties,\nwhile answering Ground No. 36. Hence for the same reasons, I\n\n 76\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ncannot accept the contentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n58. The Forty Sixth ground is that the Tribunal has\napparently arrived at a conclusion that the letter was sent post\ncollapse of the compound wall since the letter is dated\n04.09.2013 and according to the 1st Respondent compound wall\ncollapsed in the night of 03.09.2013, when in fact the collapse\nhappened on 14.09.2013.\n\n58.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the finding of the Tribunal at Para No. 49 Page No. 31 of the\nAward is extremely contradictory and does not make any sense,\nthat it is not known as to how the independent insurance\nsurveyor's report Ex.R.12 dated 28.02.2014 could be watered\ndown by Ex.P.111 dated 04.09.2013 and / or the Ex.P.114/letter\ndated 26.02.2014, which were prior to Ex.R.12.\n\n58.b. The learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1 has\nargued that it is submitted that the Petitioner was also\n\n 77\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nquestioning the competence of the surveyor as to the findings\nrecorded by him, that in fact the Petitioner has addressed\nEx.P.114/ Letter to the higher authorities of the Claims Hubs of\nInsurance Company wherein the Petitioner has stated that the\nrejection of the claim by the surveyor is not correct and that the\nwork carried out by the 1 st Respondent is correct in all respects,\nthat the Petitioner having stated in Ex.P.114 that the surveyors\nreport is wrong cannot now rely on it to blame the 1 st\nRespondent to any extent, that the question of the liability of\nthe insurer is not a closed chapter, that it is even now open to\nthe Petitioner to proceed against the insurance company and\nrecover the amounts.\n\n58.c. This Ground is more or less similar to Ground No. 44,\nwherein both parties have argued about Ex.P.114. This is only\nfurther contention about the appreciation of the Ex.P.114 by the\nTribunal. When such being the case, the said contention of the\nPetitioner is not accepted for the same reasons given while\nanswering Ground No. 44. Hence, this ground is not available\nfor the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside\nof arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.\n\n 78\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n59. The Forty Seventh ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal in respect of alleged RA Bill No.5 at Para No. 56 and 27\nat Page No. 37 - 38 of the Award or contradictory.\n\n59.a. I have already discussed about the finding and\nobservation of the Tribunal about RA Bill No.5 while answering\nGround Nos . 9 and 12 above. For the same reasons I cannot\naccept the said arguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner.\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-\nsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n60. The Forty Eighth ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal that in terms of Ex.P.73 there was unequivocal\nindication that the Petitioner owed monies to the 1 st Respondent\nprior to mishap and had assured release the same and\ntherefore it was a justified demand is contrary to the evidence\non record.\n\n60.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued\nthat the Ex.P.73/ Minutes of Meeting dated 11.10.2013, which is\nmuch subsequent to the mishap which according to the 1 st\n\n 79\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nRespondent occurred on 03.09.2013, and according to the\nPetitioner occurred on 13.09.2013, that therefore Ex.P.73 being\na demand of dues prior to the mishap is false, that Ex.P.73 does\nnot speak of the quantum of money and hence that cannot be a\ndemand as regards the dues as construed by the Tribunal.\n\n60.b. I have already discussed about the observation and\nfinding of the Tribunal in respect of Ex.P.73, while answering\nGround No.37. For the same reasons I cannot accept the said\narguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner. Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n61. The Forty Ninth ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal at Para No. 66 and 67 as regards the rain is again\nmisconceived.\n\n61.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\n\n 80\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n62. The Fiftieth ground is that the finding of the Tribunal\nthat the sewage line on the eastern side and permitted rain on\nthe western side negated to the adjoining residential complex is\nnot supported by any evidence on record.\n\n62.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate\nthe evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\n\n 81\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that\nit is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his\nfindings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nis summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)\n\n- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462\n(\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n63. The Fifty First ground is that the finding of the Tribunal\nthat Ex.R.2 was incomplete and second opinion report of\nGeocon resulted in descoping of excavation work is not\nsupported by any evidence on record.\n\n63.a. The learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1 has\nargued that it was pointed out that the Petitioner has misled all\nthe parties concerned, while it served Ex.R.2/Soil Test Report,\nthat due to the own acts of Petitioner delay has occasioned.\nElaborating his arguments he has drawn my attention to the\nfollowing aspects:-\n\n 82\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n a) Delay in marking of the piles by 11 days and in relation\nto which several correspondences have taken place between\nthe 1st Respondent and PMC.\n\n b) Delay in taking decision about the piling work to be\ntaken or not in so far as the south western side (curved\nportion). Initially there was a Meeting between the Petitioner/\nPMC/ MCPL/ 1st Respondent on 09.05.2013, wherein Sri. Sailesh\nMahimthura suggested that to ascertain the Rock Profile of the\nsouth western portion, pits have to be dug, that it was pointed\nout by the 1st Respondent on 10.05.2013 itself as could be seen\nfrom Ex.P.27 and Ex.P.83, that if the suggestion of Sri. Sailesh\nMahimthura were to be followed, it would virtually make it\nimpossible to carry out piling work in the South-Western side,\nthat Ex.R.76 records the visit of Sri. Sailesh Mahimthura to the\nsite on 27.06.2013.\n\n He has drawn my attention to Item No.1 of Ex.R.76, which\nreads as follows:-\n\n General Excavation details to be followed at (besides\nCurved ramp, where micro pilling not carried out) southern side.\nMCPL informed that adjacent to curve portion short creating as\nwell as Soil nailing not required. MCPL will send the general\n\n 83\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nexcavation details by next week. Action by MCPL, Target date\n04.07.2013'\n By drawing my attention to the same, he has argued that\nthe above minutes of the meeting makes it amply clear MCPL,\nhas taken nearly 54 days to decide on the need of piling, soil\nnailing, short-creating on the south-western side (curved\nportion), that the time taken by MCPL to decide upon the said\nissue cannot be attributed to the 1 st Respondent.\n\n c) On the Eastern side of the site, a sewage line was\nsituated in the land in question, very near to the Trinity Acres\nand Woods, which was not shown during the time of negotiation\nand came to the knowledge of the 1 st Respondent later, that it is\nsubmitted that Ex.R.5 was not given to the 1 st Respondent by\nthe Petitioner, during the negotiation process or at the time of\nLOI, that it was furnished to the 1st Respondent at the time of\nmaking of the site for location of pile bearing, that is was only\nwhen the drawing at Ex.R.5 was furnished to the 1 st Respondent\nthe 1st Respondent came to know about the existence of the\nsewerage line on the eastern side of the property, since there is\ndescription in Ex.R.5, about the existence of the sewerage line,\nthat the sewage line was weak and broke down during the time\nof execution of work by the 1st Respondent and prevented the\nwork being carried by 1st Respondent, that the compound wall\n\n 84\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nof Trinity Wood and Acres fell down, which also hampered the\nprogress of work, that several times the Petitioner and PMC\nwere informed about the leakage of the sewer line on the\nEastern side and that remedial measures have to be taken up,\nthat neither the Petitioner nor the PMC paid any attention to the\nsaid fact, that the 1st Respondent had to spend substantial\namounts for repair of the same, the suggestion of suggesting a\ncontractor for replacing the sewer line was ruled out by the\nPetitioner, that the 1st Respondent was left to spend for itself in\nso far as the sewer line is concerned.\n\n63.b. By considering the said arguments of the learned\nAdvocate for the 1st Respondent, I am of the opinion that this\nground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer\nthis ground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence\nadduced before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the\nfindings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The\nSuperior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible\nto a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the\narbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The\nnature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary\n\n 85\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nin nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara\nNidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n64. The Fifty Second ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal at Para No. 80 that there was delay of 11 days in\nmarking the areas is contrary to the records.\n\n64.a. The learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1 has\nargued that the crux of the matter relates to the delay, that the\nquestion is whether delay occasioned on account of the 1 st\nRespondent or by the Petitioner, that 1st Respondent has not\ncommitted any breach of LOI dated 15.03.2013 nor was it\nresponsible for delay in execution of the work, that having\nregard to the circumstances mentioned in the Impugned Award\nthere is absolutely no delay on the part of the 1 st Respondent in\nexecuting the work, that the delay is mainly attributed to the\nPetitioner due to circumstances mentioned in the Impugned\nAward couples with the fact that the Petitioner violated\n\n 86\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\npayment in terms of Ex.P.1, Clause No.2.A cursory glance at\nEx.P.6, which is the payments details, would indicate that\nPetitioner was deliberately delaying payment with a view to\ngain time.\n\n64.b. About this aspect, I have already discussed while\nanswering Ground No. 32. For the same reasons I cannot accept\nthe said contentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n65. The Fifty Third ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal that whenever the PMC insisted on the 1 st Respondent\nto speed up work, the 1st Respondent had insisted for payment\nof the amounts due to it immediately is also contrary to the\nrecords.\n\n65.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In\norder to answer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of\nthe evidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower\n\n 87\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nthe Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence\nproduced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if\nthe findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The\nSuperior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible\nto a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the\narbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The\nnature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary\nin nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara\nNidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n66. The Fifty Fourth ground is that the finding of the\nTribunal at Para No. 84 Page No. 58 and 59 that the Petitioner is\navoiding important and useful admissions in Ex.P.111, Ex.P.114,\nEx.R.60 etc., is without any basis.\n\n66.a. I have already discussed about the Ex.P.111 and 114,\nwhile answering Ground No. 46. For the same reasons I cannot\naccept the said arguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner.\n\n 88\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-\nsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n67. The scope of this court is limited with regard to \nSection 34\n\nof the Act. The position of law stands crystallized today, that\nfindings, of fact as well as of law, of the arbitrator/Arbitral\nTribunal are ordinarily not amenable to interference under\n\nSection 34\n of the Act. The scope of interference is only where\nthe finding of the Tribunal is either contrary to the terms of the\ncontract between the parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that\ninterference, by this court, is absolutely necessary. The\narbitrator is the final arbiter on facts as well as in law, and even\nerrors, factual or legal, which stop short of perversity, do not\nmerit interference under \nSection 34\n of the Act. The Hon'ble High\nCourt of Delhi in the decision reported in 2015 - S.C.C.\nOnLine - Del - 13192 (P.C.L. Suncon (JV) vs. NHAI), in\nParagraph No. 24 has held as follows :-\n\n \"24. As a postscript, this Court believes that\n it is imperative to sound a word of caution.\n Notwithstanding the considerable jurisprudence\n\n 89\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n advising the Courts to remain circumspect in\n denying the enforcement of arbitral awards,\n interference with the awards challenged in the\n petitions before them has become a matter of\n routine, imperceptibly but surely erasing the\n distinction between arbitral tribunals and courts.\n \nSection 34\n jurisdiction calls for judicial restraint\n and an awareness that the process is removed\n from appellate review. Arbitration as a form of\n alternate dispute resolution, running parallel to\n the judicial system, attempts to avoid the prolix\n and lengthy process of the courts and\n presupposes parties consciously agreeing to\n submit a potential dispute to arbitration with the\n object of actively avoiding a confrontation in the\n precincts of the judicial system. If a court is\n allowed to review the decision of the arbitral\n tribunal on the law or on the merits, the speed\n and, above all, the efficacy of the arbitral process\n is lost.\"\n\n68. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in\n(2006) 11 - S.C.C. - 181 ( \nMcDermott International Inc.\nvs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Ors.\n), has held as follows :-\n\n \"52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the\n supervisory role of courts, for the review of the\n arbitral award only to ensure fairness.\n Intervention of the court is envisaged in few\n circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias\n by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice,\n etc. The court cannot correct errors of the\n arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving\n\n 90\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n the parties free to begin the arbitration again if\n it is desired. So, scheme of the provision aims at\n keeping the supervisory role of the court at\n minimum level and this can be justified as parties\n to the agreement make a conscious decision to\n exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for\n arbitration as they prefer the expediency and\n finality offered by it.\"\n\n69. Thus, it is observed and held that the arbitral award is\nnot marred by any patent illegality, as there is no contravention\nof the substantive law of India, which would result in the death\nknell of an arbitral award. It is also observed that there is no\npatent illegality in the arbitral award, which must go to the root\nof the matter. The arbitral award is also a well reasoned and a\nspeaking award. The arbitral award is also held to not be in\ncontravention of \nSection 28(3)\n of the Act, which pertains to the\nterms of the contract, trade usages applicable to the nature of\ncontract and substance of dispute.\n\n70. \nThe Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n\nmade major changes to \nSection 34\n. The changes were\nsuggested by the 246th Report of the Law Commission of India\non Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 of\nAugust 2014 and the Supplementary to the 246th Report of the\n\n 91\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nLaw Commission of India on Amendments to the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 of February 2015. These changes were\naimed at restricting Courts from interfering with arbitral awards\non the ground of \"public policy.\" Accordingly, the amendment\nadded \"Explanation 2\" to \nSection 34(2)\n as well as Section 2A.\nExplanation 2 of \nSection 34(2)\n states -\n\n \"For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether\nthere is a contravention with the fundamental policy of\nIndian Law shall not entail a review on the merits of the\ndispute.\"\n\n71. Because of this amendment, Courts would no longer be\nable to interfere with the award passed by the arbitrator. The\nexplanation makes it especially clear that in no way would a\nCourt be entailed to review the award on merits of the dispute.\nThe learned Advocate for the Petitioner has relied on a decision\nreported in 2003 (5) - S.C.C. - 705 (ONGC vs. Saw Pipes\nLimited). However, after amendment to \nArbitration and\nConciliation Act\n, Section 2A also curtails the scope of\ninterpretation of \"patently illegal\" as propounded in the said\ndecision reported in 2003 (5) - S.C.C. - 705 (ONGC vs. Saw\nPipes Limited). Section 2A states :-\n\n \"An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other\nthan international commercial arbitrations, may also be\nset aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award\n\n 92\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nis vitiate by patent illegality appearing on the face of\nthe award:\n\n Provided that an award shall not be set aside\nmerely on the ground of an erroneous application of law\nor by reappreciation of evidence.\"\n\n72. Thus, Courts can no longer reappraise evidence or set\naside awards merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has made\nerrors when dealing with the same.\n\n73. Hence, the scope of interference is only where the finding\nof the Tribunal is either contrary to the terms of the contract\nbetween the parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that interference, by\nthis court, is absolutely necessary. The Arbitrator is the final\narbiter on facts as well as in law, and even errors, factual or\nlegal, which stops short of perversity, does not merit\ninterference under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996. Courts can no longer reappraise evidence or set\naside awards merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has made\nerrors when dealing with the same. For the said aspect, the\nlearned Advocate for the Respondent has relied on a decision\nreported in 2015 (5) - S.C.C. - 698 (\nNavodaya Mass\nEntertainment Limited vs. J.M. Combines\n).\n\n 93\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n74. Per-contra, the learned Advocate for the Petitioner has\nrelied on a decision reported in 2015 (3) - S.C.C. - 49\n(\nAssociate Builders vs. DDA\n). The ratio of \nthe said decision\n\nis to be appreciated along with the subsequent decisions of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n75. Subsequent to \nthe said decision\n, In the decision reported\nin (2017) 13 - SCALE - 91 (SC) (\nVenture Global\nEngineering LLC and Ors vs. Tech Mahindra Ltd. and\nOrs\n), the Hon'ble Supreme court has held as follows:-\n\n \"The Award of an Arbitral Tribunal can be set aside\nonly on the grounds specified in \nSection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act and on no other ground.\nThe Court cannot act as an Appellate Court to examine\nthe legality of Award, nor it can examine the merits of\nclaim by entering in factual arena like an Appellate\nCourt.\"\n\n76. A similar view is also taken in the decision reported in\n(2017) 14 - SCALE - 240 (SC) (\nSutlej Construction vs. The\nUnion Territory of Chandigarh\n).\n\n77. \nIn the decision reported in 2019 (15) - S.C.C. - 131\n(\nSsangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs.\nNational Highways Authority of India Ltd.\n), the Hon'ble\n\n 94\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nSupreme Court has once again reiterated the law related to the\nexamination by a Court of an Award under \nSection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and has held as under:-\n\n \n\"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression\npublic policy of India, whether contained in \nSection 34\n\nor in \nSection 48\n, would now mean the fundamental\npolicy of Indian law as explained in paragraphs 18 and\n27 of \nAssociate Builders\n (supra), i.e., the fundamental\npolicy of Indian law would be relegated to the\n\"Renusagar\" understanding of this expression.\n This\nwould necessarily mean that the Western Geco (supra)\nexpansion has been done away with. \nIn short, Western\nGeco (supra), as explained in paragraphs 28 and 29 of\n\nAssociate Builders\n (supra), would no longer obtain, as\nunder the guise of interfering with an award on the\nground that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial\napproach, the Court's intervention would be on the\nmerits of the award, which cannot be permitted post\namendment.\n \nHowever, in so far as principles of natural\njustice are concerned, as contained in \nSections 18\n and\n\n34(2) (a) (iii)\n of the 1996 Act, these continue to be\ngrounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in\nparagraph 30 of \nAssociate Builders\n (supra).\n\n 35. It is important to notice that the ground for\ninterference in so far as it concerns \"interest of India\"\n\nhas since been deleted, and therefore, no longer\nobtains. Equally, the ground for interference on the\nbasis that the award is in conflict with justice or\nmorality is now to be understood as a conflict with the\n\"most basic notions of morality or justice\". This again\nwould be in line with paragraphs 36 to 39 of \nAssociate\n\n 95\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nBuilders\n (supra), as it is only such arbitral awards that\nshock the conscience of the court that can be set aside\non this ground.\n\n \n36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now\nconstricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is\ncontrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as\nunderstood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of \nAssociate\nBuilders\n (supra), or secondly, that such award is against\nbasic notions of justice or morality as understood in\nparagraphs 36 to 39 of \nAssociate Builders\n (supra).\n\nExplanation 2 to \nSection 34(2)(b)(ii)\n and Explanation 2\nto \nSection 48(2)(b)(ii)\n was added by the Amendment Act\nonly so that Western Geco (supra), as understood in\n\nAssociate Builders\n (supra), and paragraphs 28 and 29 in\nparticular, is now done away with.\n\n 37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are\nconcerned, an additional ground is now available under\nsubsection (2A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015, to\n\nSection 34\n.Here, there must be patent illegality\nappearing on the face of the award, which refers to such\nillegality as goes to the root of the matter but which\ndoes not amount to mere erroneous application of the\nlaw. In short, what is not subsumed within the\nfundamental policy of Indian law, namely, the\ncontravention of a statute not linked to public policy or\npublic interest, cannot be brought in by the back door\nwhen it comes to setting aside an award on the ground\nof patent illegality.\n\n 38. Secondly, it is also made clear that re-\n\nappreciation of evidence, which is what an appellate\ncourt is permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the\n\n 96\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the\naward.\n\n \n39. To elucidate, paragraph 42.1 of \nAssociate\nBuilders\n (supra), namely, a mere contravention of the\nsubstantive law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground\navailable to set aside an arbitral award.\n \nParagraph 42.2\nof \nAssociate Builders\n (supra), however, would remain,\nfor if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and\ncontravenes \nSection 31(3)\n of the 1996 Act, that would\ncertainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the\naward.\n\n \n40. The change made in \nSection 28(3)\n by the\nAmendment Act really follows what is stated in\nparagraphs 42.3 to 45 in \nAssociate Builders\n (supra),\nnamely, that the construction of the terms of a contract\nis primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the\narbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no\nfair minded or reasonable person would; in short, that\nthe arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take.\nAlso, if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and\ndeals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an\nerror of jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now\nfall within the new ground added under \nSection 34(2A)\n.\n\n \n41. What is important to note is that a decision\nwhich is perverse, as understood in paragraphs 31 and\n32 of \nAssociate Builders\n (supra), while no longer being\naground for challenge under public policy of India,\nwould certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing\non the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no\nevidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence\nin arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable\nto be set aside on the ground of patent illegality.\n\n 97\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nAdditionally, a finding based on documents taken behind\nthe back of the parties by the arbitrator would also\nqualify as a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as\nsuch decision is not based on evidence led by the\nparties, and therefore, would also have to be\ncharacterized as perverse.\"\n\n78. \nIn the decision reported in 2019 (16) - SCALE - 823\n(\nHindustan Construction Company Limited & Anr. vs.\nUnion of India & Ors.\n), the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as\nunder:-\n\n \n\"49. Further, this Court has repeatedly held that an\napplication under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996\nis a summary proceeding not in the nature of a regular\nsuit - \nsee Canara Nidhi Ltd. v. M. Shashikala\n 2019 SCC\nOnline SC 1244 at paragraph 20.\n \nAs a result, a court\nreviewing an arbitral award under \nSection 34\n does not\nsit in appeal over the award, and if the view taken by\nthe arbitrator is possible, no interference is called for -\n\nsee Associated Construction v. Pawanhans Helicopters\nLimited\n. (2008)16 SCC 128 at paragraph 17.\n\n \n50. Also, as has been held in the recent decision\n\nSsangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. NHAI\n\n2019 SCC Online SC 677, after the 2015 Amendment Act,\nthis Court cannot interfere with an arbitral award on\nmerits.\"\n\n79. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in\n2020 - SCC Online - S.C. - 466 (\nPatel Engineering Ltd. vs.\n\n 98\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nNorth Eastern Power Corporation Ltd\n) has once again\nexposited the 'patent illegality' ground, appearing in \nSection 34\n(2A)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n \nThe most\nsignificant part of this judgment is the recognition and re-\naffirmation given to the test of patent illegality, as set out in\nParagraph (42.3) of the above-mentioned decision reported in\n2015 (3) - S.C.C. - 49 (\nAssociate Builders vs. DDA\n) and\nwhich was reiterated in Paragraph (40) of the decision reported\nin 2019 (15) - S.C.C. - 131 (\nSsangyong Engineering &\nConstruction Co. Ltd. vs. National Highways Authority of\nIndia Ltd.\n). The aforementioned test of 'patent illegality' lays\ndown that any contravention of \nSection 28 (3)\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act, 1996 is deemed to be a sub-head of patent\nillegality. According to it, an Arbitral Tribunal must decide in\naccordance with the terms of the contract, but if an Arbitrator\nconstrues a term of the contract in such a way that it could be\nsaid to be something that no fair minded or reasonable person\ncould do, the same will render the award 'patently illegal'.\n\n80. By keeping in mind about the said legal aspects, I am of\nthe opinion that the Arbitral Award is not marred by any patent\nillegality, as there is no contravention of the substantive law of\nIndia, which would result in the death knell of an Arbitral Award.\nIt is also observed that there is no patent illegality in the\n\n 99\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nArbitral Award, which must go to the root of the matter. The\nArbitral Award is also a well reasoned and a speaking award.\nThe Arbitral Award is also held to not be in contravention of\n\nSection 28(3)\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, which\npertains to the terms of the contract, trade usages applicable to\nthe nature of contract and substance of dispute.\n\n81. On a parting note, I would like to add, that the challenge\nto the various clauses of contract by the Petitioner under the\npresent petition is not tenable. It is accordingly, held that the\nArbitral Award is neither against the fundamental policy of India\nnor in contravention of law. Therefore, I find no perversity in\nthe Arbitral Award and the same is upheld.\n\n82. Having given my careful consideration to the submissions\nurged and the complete case record in the preceding\nparagraphs of this judgment, I am of the view that is not a fit\nand proper case for exercise the jurisdiction of this court under\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act and interfere\nwith the Arbitral Award and the same is upheld.\n\n83. As far as reliance placed by the Learned Advocate for the\nPetitioner on the recent judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\n 100\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nreported in 2021 - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 508 (\nPSA Sical\nTerminals Pvt. Ltd. vs. Board of Trustees of V.O.\nChidambranar Port Trust Tuticorin and Others\n) is\nconcerned, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that a decision,\nwhich is perverse, though may not be a ground for challenge\nunder public policy of India, however, the same can certainly\namount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the\naward. The Hon'ble Apex Court has further held that a finding\nbased on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital\nevidence in arriving at its decision, would be perverse and liable\nto be set aside.\n\n84. In my humble opinion, it cannot be said, in the present\nmatter, that finding recorded by the Learned Arbitrator is based\non no evidence or it has ignored vital evidence before arriving\nat the decision. A bare perusal of the award passed by the\nLearned Arbitrator shows that evidence of both the parties\nhave been considered in detail and the Learned Arbitrator has\ntaken into account each and every submissions advanced by\nthe parties before him, including appreciation of evidence in\nproper manner before arriving at the decision to pass the\nimpugned award and as such, the judgment cited by the\nLearned Counsel for the Petitioner, is of little assistance to him.\n\n 101\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n85. For the said aspect, I wish to refer a recent decision of\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2021) 3 - S.C.C. - 308\n(Anglo American Metallurgical Coal Pty. \nLtd. vs. MMTC\nLimited\n), wherein it has laid down the parameters of judicial\nreview and Courts have been permitted to interfere only if there\nis a ground of patent illegality or violation of fundamental policy\nof Indian law and if a possible view is based on oral and\ndocumentary evidence led in the case, which cannot be\ncharacterized as being either perverse or being based on no\nevidence and as such, no interference is permissible. The\nrelevant portion of the judgment is reproduced hereunder:-\n\n \n\"48. Given the parameters of judicial review\n \nlaid down in\n Associate Builders, it is obvious that\n neither the ground of fundamental policy of\n Indian law, nor the ground of patent illegality,\n have been made out in the facts of this case,\n given the fact that the majority award is\n certainly a possible view based on the oral and\n documentary evidence led in the case, which\n cannot be characterized as being either perverse\n or being based on no evidence.\"\n\n86. The learned Advocate for the 1st Respondent has relied on\na recent Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nDelhi\n\n 102\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nAirport Metro Express Private Limited vs. Delhi Metro\nRail Corporation Limited\n in Civil Appeal No.5627/2021\n(arising out of SLP (C) No. 4115/2019) decided on\n09.09.2021. In \nthe said judgment\n, the Arbitral Award which was\nchallenged before the Hon'ble High Court under \nSection 34\n was\ndismissed and in appeal under \nSection 37\n. The Division Bench\nof Hon'ble High Court has allowed the appeal and set aside the\naward. In this judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has set\naside the order of the Division Bench. In the said Judgment, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in Para 24 has held as under:-\n\n[\n\n \"24. This court has in several other judgments\ninterpreted \nSection 34\n of the 1996 Act to stress on the\nrestraint to be shown by courts while examining the\nvalidity of the arbitral awards. The limited grounds\navailable to courts for annulment of arbitral awards are\nwell known to legally trained minds. However, the\ndifficulty arises in applying the well-established\nprinciples for interference to the facts of each case that\ncome up before the courts. There is a disturbing\ntendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards, after\ndissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases\nto come to a conclusion that the award needs\nintervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be\nvitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart\nfrom the other grounds available for annulment of the\naward. This approach would lead to corrosion of the\nobjection of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to\npreserve this court, which is minimal judicial\n\n 103\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\ninterference with arbitral awards. That apart, several\njudicial pronouncements of this court would become a\ndead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by\ncategorizing them as perverse or patently illegal\nwithout appreciating the contours of the said\nexpressions.\"\n\n87. The Hon'ble Supreme Court at Para 35 of the said\nJudgment has held that as the arbitrator is the sole judge of the\nquality as well as the quantity of the evidence, the task of being\na judge on the evidence before the Tribunal does not fall upon\nthe court in exercise of its jurisdiction under \nSection 34\n. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court has also held in Para 39 of the said\nJudgment that construction of the contract is within the\njurisdiction of the Tribunal and merely because another view is\npossible, the court cannot interfere with such construction and\nsubstitute its own view.\n\n88. On going through these Judgments, it makes further clear\nthat Arbitrator is sole judge of the quality and quantity of the\nevidence and construction of contract is within the jurisdiction\nof the Tribunal and the court cannot lightly interfere with the\naward passed by the learned Arbitrator. On considering the\nfacts of the present case, as held in this Judgment there are no\ngrounds to set aside the award of the learned Arbitrator under\n\n 104\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nSection 34\n of the Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in this\nJudgment has even held that patent illegality which do not go to\nthe root of the matter and every error of law committed by the\nArbitral Tribunal could not fall within the expression patent\nillegality.\n\n89. Relying upon the law laid in the above-mentioned\ndecision reported in 2015 (5) - S.C.C. - 698 (\nNavodaya\nMass Entertainment Limited vs. J.M. Combines\n), it can be\nsaid that not only the reasoning of Arbitral Tribunal are logical,\nbut all the material and evidence were taken note of by Arbitral\nTribunal and this Court cannot substitute own evaluation of\nconclusion of law or fact to come to the conclusion other than\nthat of Arbitral Tribunal. Cogent grounds, sufficient reasons\nhave been assigned by Arbitral Tribunal in reaching the just\nconclusion and no error of law or misconduct is apparent on the\nface of the record. This Court cannot re-appraise the evidence\nand it is not open to this Court to sit in the appeal over the\nconclusion/findings of facts arrived at by Arbitral Tribunal.\n Re-\n\nappraisal of the matter cannot be done by this Court. No error is\napparent in respect of the Impugned Award. I do not find any\ncontradiction in the observations and findings given by Arbitral\nTribunal. The Impugned Award does not suffer from vice of\n\n 105\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\nirrationality and perversity. The conclusion of the Arbitral\nTribunal is based on a possible view of the matter, so the Court\nis not expected to interfere with the award. Even impugned\naward passed by Arbitral Tribunal cannot be set aside on the\nground that it was erroneous. The award is not against any\npublic policy nor against the terms of contract of the parties. No\nground for interference is made out. None of the grounds raised\nby the petitioner attract \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act. Therefore, I answer this Point in Negative.\n\n90. Point No. 2 :- Therefore, I proceed to pass the following\nOrder.\n\n ORDER\n\n The Petition filed under \nSection 34\n of\n the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,\n is dismissed.\n\n The Arbitral Award dated 01.06.2017 is\n hereby upheld.\n\n The Petitioner shall pay the cost of this\n proceeding to the Respondent No. 1.\n\n Office is directed to return the\n arbitral records to the Arbitration Center\n after the appeal period is over.\n\n 106\n\n Com.A.S.No.108/2017\n\n The Office is directed to send copy of\n this judgment to both parties to their\n email ID as required under Order XX Rule\n 1 of the Civil Procedure Code as amended\n under \nSection 16\n of the Commercial\n Courts Act.\n\n ( Dictated to the Stenographer, typed by her directly on\ncomputer, verified and then pronounced by me in open Court\non this the 03rd day of January, 2022).\n\n (DEVARAJA BHAT.M),\n LXXXII Addl.

The above award cannot under any\ncircumstances be considered to be made by the\nArbitrator without recording any reasons for the same.\nTherefore, in such circumstances, it is not proper to hold\nthat the Arbitrator has misconducted himself or the\nproceedings in the matter of giving the awards\"."
