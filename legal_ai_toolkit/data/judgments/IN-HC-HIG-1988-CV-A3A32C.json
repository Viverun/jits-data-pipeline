In\nthe meantime, after the conclusion of the arguments, the respondent No.1\nexpired and, thus in law, the appeals against her have abated.\nNevertheless, in view of the gamut of the imputations and the frame-work of\nthe charges as well as the nature of the evidence, oral and documentary,\navailable on records, reference to her role and involvement, based thereon\nin collaboration with other respondents would have to be essentially\nexamined. The respondents-accused would hereinafter be referred to as\nrespondents/accused/A1/A2/A3/ A4, as the case may be, contingent on the\ncontext.\n\nCharges were framed against A1 – former Chief Minister of the State of\nTamil Nadu and the co-accused viz. A2, A3 and A4 (respondents herein), for\ncommission of the alleged offences punishable under Section 13(1)(e) read\nwith Section 13(2) of the 1988 Act and further under Section 120-B and Section 109 of IPC. It is the case of the prosecution that A1 (since\ndeceased) was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 24th June, 1991 till\n13th May, 1996. Prior to this, she was a member of the Rajya Sabha from\nApril, 1984 till 27th January, 1989 and further she was a member of Tamil\nNadu Legislative Assembly from 27th January, 1989 till 30th January, 1991.\nShe also acted in the films during 1964-1972. Facts reveal that she was the\ndaughter of late Smt. N.R. Sandhya, who also acted in films during 1960’s.\nSmt. N.R. Sandhya died in the year 1971 and by virtue of her mother’s Will\ndated 01.11.1971, A1 became the owner of the following properties viz.,\n\nLand and building at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-86;\n\nHouse at Plot No.36, Door No.8/3/1099 in Sri Nagar Officer’s Colony at\nHyderabad City;\n\nLands totally measuring 10.20 acres in Sy.No.52 and Sy.No.50 of Jeedimetla\nvillage and Sy. No.93/1 of Pet Basheerabad Village in Metchal Taluk in\nRanga Reddy Dist. of Andhra Pradesh with Grape Garden, Farm House and\nServants quarters;\n\nLand in Sy.No.93/2 to the extent of 3.15 acres in Pet Basheerabad village\nin Andhra Pradesh;\n\nIn addition to the above properties, A1 was also in possession of –\n\nAgricultural land measuring 3.43 acres in Cheyyur Taluk now in Anna Dist.\n(as per Doc. No.4564/81, dt.16.12.1981 of SRO North Madras);\n\nAn old Ambassador car and an old Contessa car;\n\nA new Maruti car bearing registration No.TMA-2466 worth Rs.60,435/- and\n\nCompany shares.\n\nThus, the assets which were in the possession of A1 up to 1987 were found\nto be worth only Rs.7.5 lakhs. Besides, she also claimed to have possessed\nbalance in her bank accounts to the extent of Rs.1 lakh and certain items\nof jewellery.\n\nA2 – Tmt. Sasikala Natarajan is the wife of one Mr. M. Natarajan who had\njoined Government service as a Publicity Assistant in the Department of\nInformation and Public Relation, Government of Tamil Nadu, in the year 1970\nand thereafter promoted in succession eventually as Deputy Director in the\nyear 1986 in the same department. He tendered his resignation from\nGovernment service on 1st November, 1988 which was accepted by the\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu with retrospective effect on 3rd April, 1991.\n\nA2, as it appears from the facts, is the daughter one C. Vivekanandan, a\nMedical Compounder, and her marriage with said Natarajan was held in the\nearly 1970’s. A2 was initially an occasional visitor to the residence of\nA1 at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-86, and started permanently living there\nwith A1 from 1988 onwards and was acknowledged and declared by A1 as her\nfriend-cum-sister. A2 continued to live with A1 since then.\n\nA3 – Tr. V.N. Sudhakaran is the son of A2’s elder sister Smt. Vanithamani\nand T.T. Vivekanandan. He started residing at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-\n86 in the year 1992 while pursuing his studies at New College, Chennai. A1\nhad acknowledged and proclaimed A3 as her “foster son” and had conducted\nhis marriage with one Sathiyalakshmi at Chennai on 7.9.1995, in a lavish\ncelebrations.\n\nA4, Tmt. J. Elavarasi is the wife of late V. Jayaraman, the elder brother\nof A2. The said V. Jayaraman was a Government servant and he died in\nDecember, 1991 due to electrocution while attending to works in the Grape\nGarden of A1 at Hyderabad. Following her husband’s death, A4 came to live\nat No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-86, from the beginning of 1992.\n\nThe case of the prosecution is that, as on 1.7.1991, A1 was found in\npossession of properties and pecuniary resources in her name and in the\nname of A2 Smt. N. Sasikala, who was living with A1 at No. 36, Poes Garden,\nChennai to the extent of Rs.2,01,83,957/- including the properties acquired\nin the name of M/s. Jaya Publications, M/s. Sasi Enterprises and Namadhu\nMGR, which had been floated by A1 and A2 with themselves as partners. But,\nafter 1.7.1991, there was sudden spurt in the acquisition of assets and\nduring this period, A1 and A2 floated several firms in the names of A2, A3\nand A4 viz.,\n\nM/s. J. Farm Houses;\n\nM/s. J.S. Housing Development;\n\nM/s. Jay Real Estate;\n\nM/s. Jaya Contractors and Builders;\n\nM/s. J.S. Leasing and Maintenance;\n\nM/s. Green Farm Houses;\n\nM/s. Metal King;\n\nM/s. Super Duper TV (P) Ltd.,\n\nM/s. Anjaneya Printers Pvt. Ltd.,\n\nM/s. Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd.,\n\nM/s. Signora Business Enterprises Pvt., Ltd.,\n\nM/s. Lex Property Development Pvt., Ltd.,\n\nM/s. Riverway Agro Products Pvt., Ltd.,\n\nM/s. Meadow Agro Farms Pvt., Ltd.,\n\nM/s. Indo Doha Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,\n\nM/s. A.P. Advertising Services;\n\nM/s. Vigneswara Builders;\n\nM/s. Lakshmi Constructions;\n\nM/s. Gopal Promoters;\n\nM/s. Sakthi Constructions;\n\nM/s. Namasivaya Housing Development;\n\nM/s. Ayyappa Property Developments;\n\nM/s. Sea Enclave;\n\nM/s. Navasakthi Contractors and Builders;\n\nM/s. Oceanic Constructions;\n\nM/s. Green Garden Apartments;\n\nM/s. Marble Marvels;\n\nVinod Video Vision;\n\nFax Universal;\n\nFresh Mushrooms;\n\nM/s. Super Duper TV., and\n\nM/s. Kodanadu Tea Estate;\n\nThe further case of the prosecution is that during the check period i.e.\nfrom 1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996, there were no business activities at all in\nrespect of many of the above firms, and in respect of others, the\nactivities were more in the nature of acquiring assets like lands,\nmachinery, building etc., which were not production oriented. No income-tax\nreturns were filed by these firms. No assessment for commercial tax has\nalso been done with respect to the business of these firms. A1 also did not\nfile her Income-tax returns for the assessment years 1987-88 to 1992-93\ntill November, 1992 and when this issue was sought to be raised in\nParliament, A1 filed the income-tax returns for the above period in\nNovember, 1992. Subsequent to 1.7.1991, assets in the form of movable and\nimmovable properties and pecuniary resources like bank deposits etc., were\nfound acquired not only in the name of A1, but also in the names of A2, A3\nand A4 and the firms floated in their names. Scrutiny of various bank\naccounts maintained in the names of A1 to A4 and in the names of the above\nfirms disclosed that huge credits in cash had been frequently made into\nvarious accounts which were not commensurate with the income of the\nindividuals and of the firms concerned. There were frequent transfers of\namounts between one account to the others to facilitate illegal acquisition\nof assets. The huge quantum of such assets, when viewed in the context that\nA1 was holding the office of the Chief Minister and that A2, A3 and A4 were\nliving under the same roof with A1 and not having sufficient means to\nacquire the assets in their names, established that the assets were\nactually acquired by A1.\n\nIt is further alleged that, pursuant to the criminal conspiracy between A1,\na public servant and her associates viz., A2, A3 and A4, to acquire and\npossess properties and pecuniary resources by A1 in her name and in the\nnames of A2, A3 and A4 and in the names of various firms floated by them,\nthey amassed properties and pecuniary resources to the tune of\nRs.66,64,73,573/- (later corrected as Rs.66,65,20,395/-), which was grossly\ndisproportionate to the known sources of income of A1 and A2 to A4 during\nthe check period from 1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996. According to the prosecution,\nthe income from the known sources of A1 during this period, such as rental\nincome, interest derived from various bank deposits and other deposits held\nby her in her name and in the names of A2, A3 and A4, agricultural income,\nloans and the salary received by her as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,\nworked out to a total of Rs.9,34,26,054/-, whereas during this period the\nexpenditure incurred by A1 including repayment of principal amounts and\ninterest on loan, and other outgoings were assessed at Rs.11,56,56,833/-.\nThus, as on 30.4.1996, A1 being a public servant was found to have acquired\nand possessed pecuniary resources and properties in her name and in the\nnames of A2, A3 and A4 and the firms floated by them, which were\noverwhelmingly disproportionate to her known sources of income to the\nextent of Rs.66,65,20,395/- (Rupees Sixty Six Crores Sixty Five Lakhs\nTwenty Thousand Three hundred and Ninety Five only) which is an offence of\ncriminal misconduct within the definition of Sec.13(1)(e) punishable under Section 13(2) of 1988 Act and A2, A3, and A4 conspired with A1 and abetted\nthe commission of the above offence.\n\nOn 14.6.1996, Dr. Subramanian Swamy (PW-232), the then President of Janata\nDal lodged a complaint against A1 before the Principal Sessions/Special\nJudge, Madras, under Section 200 of Cr.P.C., alleging that A1, after\nassuming the public office as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, had acquired\nproperties and earned income disproportionate to her known sources of\nincome. The said complaint was registered as Crl.M.P. No.3238 of 1996 and\nby order dated 21.06.1996, the Principal Sessions Judge/Special Judge\ndirected investigation under Section 17 of 1988 Act and Section 202 of\nCr.P.C. and further directed to collect necessary materials and submit a\nreport before the Court within a period of two months. Pursuant to the\nsaid order, PW-240 - Smt. Letika Saran, a senior IPS Officer, took up the\ninvestigation, collected records and documents from various sources.\n\nDuring the investigation, the said order passed by the Principal Sessions\nJudge/Special Judge was challenged before the High Court of Madras. The\ninvestigation was stayed for a brief period and thereafter the High Court\nwas pleased to direct the Director of Vigilance and Anti Corruption, Madras\n(hereinafter also referred to as “DVAC”) to take appropriate steps to\ninvestigate into the allegations made in the complaint and ultimately, an\nFIR was filed against A1 on 18.9.1996 as per Ext.P-2266.\n\nDuring investigation, after conducting search of the residential premises\nof A1 and various other locations, the Investigating Officer found several\nincriminating materials and voluminous documents were seized and statements\nof a large number of witnesses were recorded. The incriminating evidence\ncollected during such investigation disclosed the complicity of A2 to A4 in\nthe alleged offence. Hence, an application was filed before the Special\nJudge on 22.01.1997 for addition of A2, A3 and A4 as co-accused and for\nincorporation of additional offences under Section 120-B of IPC read with Sections 13(2) and 13(1)(e) of 1988 Act and Section 109 of IPC. On\ncompletion of such investigation, PW-259 (Shri Nallamma Naidu) laid the\ncharges against all the accused on 4.6.1997 which was duly registered as\nSpl. C.C. No.7/97 on the file of the IX Additional Sessions Judge (Special\nCourt, I), Chennai.\n\nThe ball was set into motion and following charges were framed by the\nSpecial Judge, Chennai:\n\nr/w 13(2) r/w 13(1)(e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and within the\ncognizance of this Court.\n\nSecondly:- That you A1 in pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy, during\nthe said period and the said places, being a public servant to wit the\nChief Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu, acquired and possessed in your\nname and in the names of A2 to A4 and in the names of the business\nenterprises floated in the names of A2 to A4, pecuniary resources and\nproperty disproportionate to your known sources of income to the extent of\nRs.66,65,20,395/- for which you could not satisfactorily account, and\nthereby you A1 committed an offence punishable u/Sec. 13(2) r/w 13(1)(e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and within the cognizance of this Court.\n\nThirdly:- That you A2 to A4 in pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy\nduring the said period and the said places abetted A1 who was a public\nservant, by intentionally aiding her in the possession of pecuniary\nresources and property disproportionate to her known sources of income and\nfor which she could not satisfactorily account, by holding a substantial\nportion of the said pecuniary resources and property in your names and in\nthe names of the business enterprises floated in your names, and thereby\nyou A2 to A4 committed an offence punishable u/Sec. 109 I.P.C . r/w 13(2)\nr/w 13(1)(e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and within the\ncognizance of this Court.\n\nThe charges were denied by the accused persons. During the pendency of the\ntrial, the D.V. & A.C. was permitted further investigation under Section\n173(8) of Cr.P.C. and was granted letters rogatory by the Designated Court\nfor collecting evidence and materials relating to the alleged accumulation\nof disproportionate assets/wealth by A1 in conspiracy with A2 outside the\ncountry. On the basis of the evidence collected during further\ninvestigation, a separate FIR in Crime No.2/AC/2000 was filed by the\nprosecution on 2.9.2000 against A1 and A2 which culminated into a charge-\nsheet dated 23.3.2001 registered as Spl.C.C. No.2/2001.\n\nSubsequent thereto evidence was recorded from time to time. Thereafter,\nsteps were taken under Section 313 Cr.P.C. So far as A1 was concerned, she\nwas permitted to answer a questionnaire which was delivered to her with a\ndirection to answer it on 25.2.2003, which was adhered to by A1. A2 to A4\nwere also questioned as per Section 313 Cr.P.C. which was duly concluded on\n26.2.2003. Thereafter, defence witnesses were examined. Thereafter, by its\njudgment dated 18.11.2003 in Transfer Petition (Criminal) Nos.77-78/2003,\nthe Supreme Court transferred the said matter to the State of Karnataka and\nin terms of the said judgment, the Government of Karnataka by its order\ndated 27.12.2003 duly accorded sanction for establishment of the Special\nCurt at Bangalore and by Notification dated 19.02.2005, duly appointed Shri\nB.V. Acharya, Senior Advocate and former Advocate General of Karnataka as\nPublic Prosecutor to conduct the said matter.\n\nThereafter, the said matter bearing Spl.C.C. No.7/1997 was renumbered as\nSpl.C.C. No.208/2004 and Spl.C.C. No.2/2001 was renumbered as Spl.C.C.\nNo.209/2004 on the file of the Special Judge (i.e. 36th Addl. City Civil &\nSessions Judge at Bangalore. Subsequent thereto certain steps were taken on\nbehalf of the accused and the matter travelled up to this Court/Supreme\nCourt whereafter the trial was resumed before the Special Judge. The\naccused were called upon to examine their witnesses and subsequently 99\nwitnesses were produced before the Court and concluded their evidence.\nNarration of all eventful factual interventions has been avoided being not\ndecisively essential for the adjudication.\n\nIt appears that the Trial Court after hearing the parties culled out the\nfollowing points for determination:\n\nWhether the prosecution further proves beyond reasonable doubt that A1 to 4\nwere parties to a criminal conspiracy with the object of acquiring and\npossessing pecuniary resources and assets to the extent of Rs.66,65,20,395/-\nin the names of A1 and in the names of A2 to 4 and the 32 business\nenterprises floated in the names of A2 to 4 and thereby committed the\noffence punishable u/Sec. 120-B of Indian Penal Code R/w. Sec.13 (2) R/w. Sec. 13 (1) (e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988?\n\nWhether the prosecution further proves beyond all reasonable doubt that A2\nto A4 abetted the commission of the above offence by intentionally aiding\nA1 in the acquisition and possession of pecuniary resources and properties\ndisproportionate to her known source of income by holding substantial\nportion thereof in their names and in the names of 32 business enterprises\nfloated in the names of A2 to A4, rendering them liable for conviction for\nthe offence punishable u/Sec. 109 Indian Penal Code R/w. Sec. 13(2) R/w. Sec.13(1)(e) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988?\n\nWhat order ?\n\nThe Trial Court appraised the evidence adduced in respect of the points\nformulated by it and duly dealt with the charges framed against the\naccused. The Trial Court elaborately dealt with the matter after\nconsidering the evidence, facts as well as the judgments cited before it,\nthe contentions raised and after dealing with all aspects of the matter,\ninter alia held that:\n\nProsecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that A2 to A4 abetted the\ncommission of the above\noffence by intentionally aiding A1 in the acquisition\nand possession of pecuniary resources and properties disproportionate to\nher known source of income as above. Hence, A2, A3 and A4 are hereby\nconvicted for the offence punishable u/ Sec.109 of I.P.C. R/w. Sec. 13 (1)\n\n(e) R/w. Sec. 13 (2) of 1988 Act.”\n\nThe Trial Court after hearing the learned counsel appearing for the accused\nand the learned Public Prosecutor on sentence, awarded the following\nsentence against the accused:\n\nOut of the fine amount recovered as above, a sum of Rs.5 crores shall be\nmade over to the State of Karnataka towards reimbursement of the cost of\ntrial conducted in the State of Karnataka.\n\nFurnish a free copy of the full judgment to the accused forthwith.”\n\nBeing aggrieved, appeals were filed by the accused before the High Court of\nKarnataka at Bangalore challenging the order passed by the Court of 36th\nAddl. City Civil & Sessions Judge at Bangalore. The High Court on its\nanalysis came to the conclusion that the value of assets at the end of the\ncheck period in respect of accused Nos.1, 2, 3 & 4 together along with the\nfirms/companies involved was Rs.66,44,73,537/- and accepted the value of\nthe assets as indicated by the prosecution. The High Court, thereafter\napplying the principles laid down in Krishnanand Agnihotri Vs. The State of\nMadhya Pradesh, AIR 1977 SC 769 = (1977) 1 SCC 816, on a calculation of\ntotal assets, income & expenditure of accused Nos.1 to 4, their firms and\ncompanies, arrived at the percentage of disproportionate assets as under:\n\nIncome of Accused Nos.1 to 4, firms and companies:\n\nRs.37,59,02,466 - Rs.34,76,65,654 = Rs.2,82,36,812\n\nPercentage = Disproportionate assets x 100\nIncome\n\n= Rs.2,82,36,812 x 100\n_____________________\nRs.34,76,65,654\n\n= 8.12%\n\nThe High Court, following the principles laid down in Krishnanand\nAgnihotri (supra), held that when there is disproportionate asset to the\nextent of 10% or below, the accused are entitled to acquittal and\naccordingly the High Court passed the following order acquitting the\naccused:\n\n[i] Order of the Trial Court relating to confiscation of the properties\nboth movable and immovable, is hereby set aside.”\n\nAssailing the judgment and order dated 11.05.2015, passed by the High Court\nof Karnataka at Bengaluru, appeals, by special leave, have been filed\nbefore this Court by the State of Karnataka and Mr. K. Anbazhagan.\nAlthough the State of Tamil Nadu was arrayed as the sole respondent in the\nappeals before the High Court, these appeals have been filed by the State\nof Karnataka, in view of the decisions of this Court in K. Anbazhagan Vs.\nState of Karnataka and Ors. , reported in (2015) 6 SCC 86 and (2015) 6 SCC\n158, wherein it was held that it is only the State of Karnataka (being the\nTransferee State) which is the sole Prosecuting Agency and was competent to\nappoint the Public Prosecutor.\n\nWe have given a patient hearing to all the parties, including the\nintervenor, in the matter. We have been taken through various documents and\nthe evidence of the parties.\n\nMr. Dushyant Dave and Mr. B.V. Acharya, learned senior counsel appearing in\nsupport of the appeals first contended that the High Court has calculated\nthe disproportionate assets by adopting an incorrect method with wrong\nparticulars and our attention was drawn to Page 997 of the SLP Paper Book,\nwhere in the table consisting of assets and expenditure, the High Court has\nreduced the values therein but has inflated the income and thus\ninaccurately assessed the disproportionate assets to be Rs.2,82,36, 812/-.\nIt is pointed out before us that there are concurrent findings of the two\nCourts in respect of the fact that the accused did own disproportionate\nassets during the check period and the difference between the two Courts is\nonly with regard to the quantum. While the Trial Court held that it is\nRs.53,60,49,954/-, the High Court held it as Rs.2,83,36,812/-. It is also\nsubmitted that in calculating the disproportionate assets, value of assets,\nexpenditure and income of all the accused has been taken jointly along with\nthat of firms and companies (34 in number). Both the Courts, High Court as\nwell as Trial Court, have recorded concurrent findings and have taken all\nthe assets, income and expenditure of all the accused together. It is\nfurther pointed out that the sole source of inflow is of A1, although\nassets were standing in the names of other accused or the firms/companies\nowned by them. It is further submitted, as appears from the records, that\nboth the Courts did not accept the claim to consider the case of A1 and A2\nto A4 separately. Hence, it is submitted that now they cannot claim such a\ncourse to be adopted at this stage before this Court.\n\nIt is also submitted that both the Courts have rejected the claim of\nNamadhu MGR scheme which according to the accused worked out to more than\nRs.14 crores during the check period and that the finding of the Courts\nthat all properties purchased by the 6 companies actually belonged to\naccused has not been challenged by anybody and therefore it stands.\n\nMr. B.V. Acharya, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State\nof Karnataka contended that if the final figures arrived by the High Court\n(appearing at Pages 997-998 of its judgment) are accepted and apparent\nerrors therein including calculation and arithmetical errors as also error\napparent on the face of the record are corrected, the disproportionate\nassets will be more than Rs.35 crores and this alone is sufficient to\nsustain the conviction, according to him. Mr. Acharya has placed before us\na Chart which is as follows:\n\n|1. |CALCULATION ERROR |The method of calculating D.A. is wrong. If |\n| | |all the findings of the high court is |\n| | |accepted in toto then the amount of D.A. is |\n| | |Rs.14,38,93,645 i.e. 41.3% & not |\n| | |Rs.2,82,36,36,812 i.e. 8.12% as held by the |\n| | |High Court – (The previous two charts have |\n| | |details of the same) |\n|2. |ARITHMETIC ERROR |While totalling loans as income at (Pg.939 |\n| | |Vol IV), the High Court has committed an |\n| | |arithmetic error to the tune of 13.50 |\n| | |Crores. If this arithmetic error is alone |\n| | |corrected then the Disproportionate Asset |\n| | |come to Rs.16,32,36,812/- i.e. 76.7% |\n| | |This is fully covered in Pg 1028-1030 – SLP |\n| | |Vol.IV |\n|3. |ADMISION OF ACCUSED|Under Expenditure: |\n| | |Cost of Construction : The accused have |\n| | |admitted that the cost of construction |\n| | |incurred is Rs.8,60,59,261 – Pg 2350 Vol IX.|\n| | |However the High Court values the same at |\n| | |Rs.5,10,55,060 – Pg 979 Vol IV, which is |\n| | |Rs.3,50,05,210 lesser than the admitted |\n| | |amount. |\n| | |Under income: |\n| | |Business income of Jaya Publication: The |\n| | |accused have admitted that the income of |\n| | |Jaya Publication was Rs.1,15,94,849/- (As |\n| | |per written submission of A-2 –Extracted in |\n| | |Pg 1034 SLP Vol IV). The High Court |\n| | |calculated this at Rs.4 Crores – Pg 946-960 |\n| | |Vol IV, which is Rs.2,84,05,151/- more than |\n| | |the admitted amount. |\n|4. |GIFTS AS INCOME |Gifts as income is subject matter of SLP |\n| | |Nos.1163-1167 of 2012 – Pg 1032-1033 Present|\n| | |SLP Vol IV. Therefore although Trial Court |\n| | |has held that gifts received cannot be held |\n| | |to be a lawful source of income – Pg |\n| | |1283-1296 Vol V, the High Court has added |\n| | |1.5 Crores as income under this head, which |\n| | |is liable to be reduced. |\n\nTherefore if the above corrections are carried out, the disproportionate\nassets will be :\n\nRegarding the loan of Rs.50,00,000/- J. Farm House which is shown as item\nNo.2 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol. V, (Income list) and\nItem No.3 in Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of Vol. VI (Expenditure\nlist), it is submitted by the learned counsel that this loan has been\ndeposed to by PW-182 and marked as Exh.P-1211-1212 through him. He\nsubmitted that although the Bank had sanctioned Rs.50 lakhs, it had\nreleased only a sum of Rs.28 lakhs and the principal amount and interest\nhas not been paid back by the firm. The Trial Court has discussed this loan\nat Page 1234 of Vol. V while dealing with income and at Page 1416 of Vol.VI\nwhile dealing with expenditure. Therefore, Mr. Acharya submitted, this\nincome has been duly considered and the High Court could not have taken the\namount of Rs.50 lakhs under this head.\n\nRegarding the loan of Rs.25,00,000/- by Sasikala which is shown as item\nNo.1 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol. V, (Income list) and\nItem No.2 in Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of Vol. VI (Expenditure\nlist), it is submitted by the learned counsel that this amount has been\ndeposed to by PW-182 and marked as Exh.P-1260 through him. He submitted\nthat the principal amount due under this account was Rs.13,55,023 and the\nTrial Court has discussed this loan at Page 1234 of Vol. V while dealing\nwith income and at Page 1416 of Vol.VI while dealing with expenditure.\nTherefore, Mr. Acharya submitted that this income has been duly considered\nand the High Court could not have taken the amount of Rs.25 lakhs under\nthis head.\n\nRegarding the loan of Rs.1,57,00,000/- by Sudhakaran (A3) which is shown as\nitem No.7 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol. V, (Income list)\nand Item No.8 in Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of Vol. VI (Expenditure\nlist), it is submitted by Mr. Acharya that this loan has been taken by Lex\nProperty Development Ltd. and not by Sudhakaran. It has been deposed to by\nPW-182 and marked as Exh.P-1330 through him. He submitted that the\nprincipal amount due under this account was Rs.83,00,000 and the Trial\nCourt’s discussion on this loan is at Page 1234 of Vol. V while dealing\nwith income and at Page 1418 of Vol.VI while dealing with expenditure.\nTherefore, Mr. Acharya submitted, this income has been duly considered and\nthe High Court could not have taken a sum of Rs.1.57 lakhs under this head.\n\nRegarding the loan of Rs.1,65,00,000/- by Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd. it is\nsubmitted by the learned counsel that this loan is not shown as an item in\nAnnexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol. V, (Income list) or as an item\nin Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of Vol. VI (Expenditure list). It has\nbeen deposed to by PW-182 and marked as Exh.P-1349-1354 through him.\nExh.1354 is a statement of account of OCC-19 of Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd. PW-\n235 at 145 of Vol. 11 has stated of his knowledge about Rs.1.65 crores\nbeing sanctioned. However, there is no evidence of disbursement of this\nloan amount. Mr. Acharya submitted that the amount due to the Bank on this\naccount was Rs.39,10,781/-, hence, the High Court could not have taken a\nsum of Rs.1.65 crores under this head.\n\nRegarding the loan of Rs.17,85,274/- by Mahalakshmi Kalyanamandapa, which\nis shown as item No.6 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol. V,\n(Income list) and Item No.7 in Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of Vol. VI\n(Expenditure list), it is submitted by Mr. Acharya that this has been\ndeposed to by PW-182 and marked as Exh.P-1357 through him. He submitted\nthat the amount due in this account was Rs.19,81,802 and the Trial Court’s\ndiscussion on this loan is at Page 1234 of Vol. V while dealing with income\nand at Page 1417 of Vol.VI while dealing with expenditure. Therefore, Mr.\nAcharya submitted that this income has been duly considered and the High\nCourt could not have taken a sum of Rs.17.85 lakhs under this head.\n\nMr. Acharya thus submitted that the detailed discussion in the preceding\nparagraphs will clearly disclose that that the High Court considered these\n10 items against the weight of the evidence on record and the entire amount\nof Rs.24,17,31,274/- which after deduction of Rs.5,99,85,274/- comes to\nRs.18,17,46,000/- is liable to be set aside. He further contended that the\naccused have nowhere in their written statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C.,\ntheir Memorandum of Appeal or their written arguments before the Trial\nCourt and the High Court, taken any plea of any loan from nationalized\nbanks being left out of consideration while calculating the income and\nexpenditure and then arrived at the value of Rs.9,34,26,054/- (Page 1224,\nVo. V) and Rs.11,56,56,833/- (Page 1397, Vol. VI), respectively. Therefore,\nhe contended that 10 items valued at Rs.24,17,31,274/- taken by the High\nCourt at Page 939, has to be totally excluded since the same amounts to\nnothing but double credit. If this error is corrected, than the income has\nto be reduced by, according to him, Rs.18,17,46,000/-. Therefore, from the\nfinding of the total income of Rs.34,76,65,654/- of the High Court, an\namount of Rs.18,17,46,000/- is liable to be deducted and the total income\nwould be only Rs.16,59,19,654/- and not Rs.34,76,65,654/-. He further\ncontended that from this amount, if we deduct the income on the basis of\nadmission and gift treating it as income, then the income will be\nRs.16,59,19,654/- - Rs.2,84,05,151/- (admitted amount) + Rs.1,50,00,000/-\n(gifts) = Rs.12,25,14,503/-.\n\nMr. Acharya further contended that significantly the accused are not\npressing for remand of the case to the appellate Court (High Court).\nConsequently, the accused accept all the findings of the High Court. Of\ncourse, this Court will have to correct the calculation mistakes or\narithmetic errors and also errors apparent on the face of the record.\nReacting to the ingenious endeavour on the part of the respondents to\nmaintain their acquittal by only assailing the errors committed by the\nTrial Court, while abstaining from questioning any finding of the High\nCourt, the learned Public Prosecutor urged that the choice before the\nrespondents was two-fold:-\n\nIt is the case of the appellants that when A2 to A4 had jointed the\nhousehold of A1, they did not have any worthwhile property/asset in their\nnames. They did not have any independent source of income. Properties were\nacquired in the names of newly formed or acquired thirty two\nfirms/companies and two existing firms, i.e., Jaya Publications and Sasi\nEnterprises in which A1 and A2 were partners. Among these entities, only\nfew were registered as a company under the Companies Act, 1956 and all\nothers are firms. In the said firms or companies, A2 or A3 or A4 or all of\nthem are partners or directors. It is not in dispute that the said\nproperties were acquired during the check period. It is further submitted\nthat it is on record that six firms were registered on a single day, i.e.,\non 25.01.1994, where partners were A2, A3 and A4 and ten other firms were\nregistered on another single day, i.e., on 06.02.1995, where A2, A3 and A4\nwere the partners and further in Lex Proeprty Development (P) Ltd., A3 and\nA4 were the directors, which would be evident from the deposition of PW3\n(D. Thangavalu in Vol.2, Pg. 11-23). It was further pointed out that about\n50 bank accounts were opened in Indian Bank, Abiramapuram Branch and Canara\nBank, Mylapore in the names of accused and the firms/companies, which would\nbe evident from the deposition of PW-182 (A.R. Arunachalam in Vol.8 – Pages\n90-182) and PW-201 (C.K.R.K. Vidyasagar in Vol.9 – Pages 80-231). It is\nalso submitted that the accused shared common auditors, architects and\naccountants.\n\nOn the question of abetment and conspiracy, Mr. Acharya has duly taken us\nthrough the Paragraph Nos. 88 to 99 of the judgment and order of the Trial\nCourt appearing at Page Nos. 1838-2028 in Vol. 7 & 8 and submitted that\nthere was no source of income of A2 to A4 and further A2 to A4 were not\nrelated to A1. Moreover, A2 to A4 resided with A1.\n\nIt is submitted that the properties standing in the name of A3; formation\nof large number of firms in the names of A2 to A4; opening of 50 bank\naccounts and transfer of funds from one account to another and cash credits\ninto the banks shows that the origin of the resources is from A1. According\nto the prosecution, the other circumstances which disclose the conspiracy\nand abetment would appear from the following facts :-\n\nTo support his contention, he submitted that:\n\nBut having regard to the fact that in valuing the constructions, there are\nseveral imponderables and taking note of the possibility of marginal error,\nthe Trial Court has given a discount of 20% which in the circumstances, is\nreasonable. Having regard to the superior quality of marble and granite\nused as described in the valuation reports and having regard to the value\nof various special items, the ultimate finding of the Trial Court is\njustified, he urged.\n\nHe further submitted that even the accused have admitted valuation of\nbuildings at Rs.8,60,59,261/- excluding one building of Anjaneya Printers.\nIf the value of this construction of Rs.2,13,63,457/- is added to this sum,\nthe total will be Rs.10,74,22,718/-. As can be seen from Chart 10 as\nreproduced above, under other items of assets IV to XII, the Trial Court\nhas totally excluded the value of Sarees and footwear. Regarding Gold and\nDiamond jewellary also after detailed discussion at Pages 1756 to 1785,\nTrial Court has reduced the value from Rs.5,53,02,334/- to Rs.2,51,59,144/-\nand Silverwares from Rs.48,80,800/- to Rs.20,80,000/-. Regarding other\nitems such as Fixed Deposits and cash balance in bank account, there can be\nno dispute. Therefore, the conclusion of the Trial Court regarding value of\nother assets is fully justified as per the evidence on record, he\ncontended.\n\nSo far expenditure is concerned, the High Court has accepted the amount of\nexpenditure fixed by DVAC in respect of all items except the marriage. The\nHigh Court has reduced the marriage expenditure from Rs.6,45,04,222/- (as\nper prosecution) to Rs.28,68,000/-, i.e., a reduction of Rs.6,16,36,222.\nAccording to the prosecution, the total expenditure is Rs.11,56,56,833/-.\n\nHe submitted that the main dispute under caption expenditure is regarding\nmarriage. In support of the prosecution case as many as 21 witnesses have\nbeen examined as detailed in the chart. Though according to prosecution\nexpenditure incurred for marriage is Rs.6,45,04,222/-, the Trial Court on\ndetailed consideration has fixed the same at Rs.3 Crores. It is thus\ntotally erroneous to contend that the Trial Court has rejected the evidence\nof prosecution witnesses, he pleaded. In fact the Trial Court on a\nconsideration, not only of the prosecution evidence but also defence\nevidence of 23 witnesses, has rightly fixed the amount of expenditure to\nthe tune of Rs.3 Crores. It is even conceded that a total expenditure of\nRs.2 to 3 Crores has been spent for the marriage. According to him, the\nTrial Court has rightly disbelieved the evidence of DW’s who claimed that\nthe party workers have collected funds and have spent for expenses such as\nfaçade, decoration, food etc. It is unbelievable that a person of the\nstature of A1, would allow her party workers to spend on the marriage of\nher foster son. He elaborated that though A1 has, in her reply to the\nnotice to the Income Tax Department, claimed that A2 has spent amounts\nunder different heads, A2 has failed to account for the same.\n\nMr. Acharya submitted that according to the prosecution the total income of\nthe accused is Rs.9,34,26,054/- and according to the Trial Court, the\ntotal income is Rs.9,91,05,094.75/-. However, according to the High Court,\nthe total income is Rs.34,76,65,654/-. In coming to this conclusion, the\nHigh Court added to the income seven items such as :\n\nAccording to Mr. Acharya, there is no lawful source so far as the Gift is\nconcerned. He further submitted that the Trial Court has rightly disallowed\nthe claim. The High Court has erroneously fixed it at Rs.4 crores based on\nbelatedly filed Income Tax returns, which even if accepted, amounts to only\nRs.1.15 Crores.\n\nTherefore, he submitted that if the above is the correct position, the\nconclusion of the Trial Court is fully justified. According to him, the\nTrial Court has considered every contention raised by the accused and if\nsome of the contentions are not urged before the Trial Court, then the\nrespondent cannot complain before this Court about non-consideration\nthereof.\n\nHe further contended that if the contention of the appellants that in\ncalculating Disproportionate Assets, the value of the Assets, Expenditure\nand Income of all the Accused have to be taken jointly along with that of\nfirms and companies (34 in number), as done by both the courts below, then\nthe explanation offered in the individual chart of A1 and the combined\nchart given by A2 to A4 will be of no effect and the same do not deserve to\nbe taken note of. The accused have deliberately given their explanations\nseparately as they cannot give any satisfactory explanation if the assets\nare taken jointly.\n\nIn refutation, learned senior counsel appearing for A1 submitted that the\nTrial Court wrongly excluded from consideration the Income Tax Assessment\nOrders in favour of the accused by relying upon the judgment of High Court\nof Patna in State of Bihar Vs. Lalu Prasad & Anr. , (2008) Crl.L.J. 2433,\nwhich, according to him, is clearly inapplicable since the order passed by\nthe Patna High Court was in the nature of an interlocutory order. He\nfurther stated that while dealing with the assets of A1 under the head\n“Additional Construction”, the Trial Court by an arbitrary method deducted\n20% from the overall cost of construction. Similarly, in relation to\nmarriage expenditure, the Trial Court erroneously estimated the cost of\nconstruction of a thatched pandal and arbitrarily came to the conclusion\nthat the marriage expenditure was to the tune of Rs.3 crores, for which no\nbasis has been given, according to him. He further contended that with\nregard to the possession of gold and jewellery, although the Trial Court\naccepted that A1 had 7040 gms. in 1987-1988, as reflected in the Wealth Tax\nAssessment order, it overlooked the other Wealth Tax Assessment orders for\nthe subsequent years whereby there was an addition of Rs.2,51,59,144/- in\nthe holdings of A1, which is also contrary to the evidence on record. He\nfurther submitted that the Trial Court and the prosecution have failed to\ntake into account the income from Grape Garden, interest income, rental\nadvance, rental income, wealth tax refund, income from gifts, Partner’s\ndrawings of A1 from Jaya Publications and income from Namadhu MGR scheme,\netc.\n\nLearned senior counsel submitted that the Trial Court, contrary to the\nsettled law, has required the public servant to offer an explanation to the\nproperties held by A2 to A4 and the companies, without any foundational\nbasis or any evidence to show that those properties in the names of A2 to\nA4 or companies were acquired out of the resources of A1 or that there was\nany flow of fund from A1 to A2 to A4. The Trial Court has sought to\nattribute criminal conspiracy between A1 and A2 to A4 on the sole ground\nthat A1 to A4 were living in the same house under a common roof.\n\nHe further contended that in a disproportionate assets case, the\nprosecution has to discharge the initial burden to prove that the assets of\nthe accused were disproportionate to the known sources of income. The\nprosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt, the value of the assets\npossessed by the accused and it has a further burden to show that the\nproperties which were standing in the name of third parties, like A2 to A4\nand the companies, were being held benami for the public servant. Once the\nprosecution discharges this initial burden beyond reasonable doubt, the\nonus then shifts to the accused to satisfactorily account for the source of\nsuch income. He further contended that for the accused, the standard of\nproof is one based on preponderance of probabilities and it is sufficient\nfor the accused to provide a plausible explanation that is satisfactory to\nthe Court. In support of his contention, the learned senior counsel relied\nupon the following decisions:\n\nThe learned senior counsel, next dwelt upon the purport of “income received\nfrom any lawful source” and drew our attention to Section 13(1)(e) of the\n1988 Act, which reads as follows:\n\nExplanation.- For the purposes of this section, “known sources of income”\nmeans income received from any lawful source and such receipt has been\nintimated in accordance with the provisions of any law, rules or orders for\nthe time being applicable to a public servant.”\n\nHe further contended that the term “income” which has been used in Section\n13(1)(e) , would include all earnings, sources whereof are not prohibited by\nlaw and it is always open to the accused to prove those other sources of\nincome which have not been taken into account or brought into evidence by\nthe prosecution. The term “income”, according to him, would also include\nreceipts in the form of “gifts” and “loans” which have been disclosed to\nand accepted by the income tax authorities. He further pointed out that the\nconcept of ‘known sources of income’ is not confined only to the source\nknown to the prosecution but every other source of income which the\naccused is able to establish during the course of trial. In support of the\nsaid contention, he relied upon the following decisions of this Court:\n\nLearned senior counsel further submitted that the Court cannot set up a\nthird case which is not the basis of prosecution case or that of the\naccused. He further contended that without making a company an accused, its\nproperty cannot be forfeited. He further contended that A1’s income and\nexpenditure have been accepted by the Income Tax authorities for all the\nfive years of the check period. In none of the assessment years any income\nis assessed as from an unexplained source. Same is the position as regards\nJaya Publication and for A2 also, and those orders have been exhibited in\nevidence. He further submitted that A1 had no disproportionate assets but\nher likely savings were to the extent of Rs.67,72,128.54. The prosecution\nhas valued all the assets belonging to A1 to A4 and the 32 firms/companies,\nin a sum of Rs.66,65,20,395/-. The value of the assets held by them before\nthe check period was assessed at Rs.2,01,83,957/-. The assets acquired\nduring the check period is Rs.64,42,89,616/-. The value of the assets\nacquired by A1 alone as per DVAC is Rs.24,29,40,490/-.\n\nHowever, it is A1’s case that the assets acquired (including construction)\nby A1 during check period amounted to Rs.6,52,34,410.00 for which she had\nsatisfactorily explained out of her known sources of income. The major\nheads of assets and the errors committed by the Trial Court were\nhighlighted as hereunder:\n\nVis-à-vis new and additional constructions, Mr. L. Nageswara Rao, learned\nsenior counsel (as he then was) submitted that according to the prosecution\nthe total cost was Rs.13,65,31,901/- and according to the accused as\ndetermined by the Income Tax authorities it is Rs.3,62,47,700/-. Hence, he\nsubmitted that deduction of Rs.10,02,84,201/- is required. He further\npointed out that there are fundamental defects in the prosecution evidence\nin relation to the valuation of all the construction because measurement is\nnot verifiable, age of the building is not given, there is no basis for\ncalculating the price of non-scheduled items. As per prosecution’s\ncalculation the cost under the head new/additional construction in Grape\nGarden Farm House is Rs.6,40,33,901/- while as per A1 this cost is\nRs.1,39,62,300/-. Therefore, he submitted that an amount of Rs.5,00,71,601/-\nshould be deducted.\n\nAccording to the learned senior counsel, the prosecution has examined PW-98\nM. Velayudam, PWD Engineer (Vol.4 Page 148-179) and marked his Report Exh.P-\n645 (Vol.33 Page 86-112). He submitted that the evidence of PW-98 should\nbe rejected since there are three major defects in his evidence. He further\npointed out that his report is unreasoned and cannot be relied upon. The\nentire evaluation of electrical appliances by Mr. Udaya Suriyan, Asstt.\nElectrical Engineer, amounting to Rs.41,53,653/- (Exh.P-645) is\ninadmissible in evidence as this expert has not been examined as a witness.\nHe further submitted that the defence evidence has not been taken into\naccount by the Trial Court. He further contended that the calculation of\nthe prosecution under the head ‘New/Additional Construction at residential\nbuildings at 31-A and 36 Poes Garden’ is Rs.7,24,98,000/- (Trial Court\nJudgment – Page 1709 of Vol.VII), whereas the valuation as per A1 is\nRs.2,14,35,4000/-. Accordingly, he submitted that an amount of\nRs.5,10,62,600/- is to be deducted from the said amount.\n\nHe submitted that the prosecution has relied mainly on the evidence of PW-\n116 Jayapal, PWD Executive Engineer (appear at Vol.5 Page 41) and the\nreport prepared by him i.e. Exh.P-671 (Vol. 35 Page 16-47) to arrive at an\nerroneous calculation of Rs.7,24,98,000/-. According to the learned\ncounsel, there are several infirmities in the report Exh.P-671 as well as\ndeposition of PW-116. He also raised dispute with regard to the valuation\nof electrical lay outs being Exh.P-2152 submitted by PW-220. He also relied\non the evidence of DW-78 – R. Raviraj, Executive Engineer (Vol.91 Page\n\n212). He further contended that the total expenditure incurred by A1\ntowards construction was accepted by the Income Tax authorities after deep\nand pervasive scrutiny. He also submitted that the total expenditure\nincurred by A1 in the entire three constructions amount to only as under:\n\nHe further pointed out that A1 had succeeded in all the proceedings before\nthe Income Tax authorities and her case that the gold jewellery was already\npossessed by her earlier to the check period had been accepted by the\nauthorities. Hence, he submitted that the total jewellery to the extent of\n26,558.250 gms. has been accounted for and what remains is only a balance\nof around 343.830 gms. which is meager difference.\n\nThe learned senior counsel next pointed out that 416 Kgs. of silver was\nseized from A1 during the check period. The value of this silver has been\ntaken as Rs.20,80,000/- at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per Kg as described in\nItem No.291 of the DVAC Annexre-II (Vol.1 Page 112). The Trial Court’s\nfinding is that 416 Kgs of silver is the illegal acquisition of A1 during\nthe check period and the value of this at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per kg, is\nassessed at Rs.20,80,000/-.\n\nThe High Court has also accepted the said valuation. The Trial Court, in\nrespect of costly watches, has duly accepted and allowed the case of the\nprosecution while accepting the valuation report and oral evidence of PW-\n129 and PW-130. According to the learned senior counsel, PW-130 had been\nexamined to value 91 watches. His report is Exh.740. He had given the total\nvalue of 91 watches at Rs.6,87,350/-. However, it would be evident from the\ntestimony of these witnesses that they are not experts as they have no\nspecial proficiency on valuation of watches nor do they have experience in\nevaluating watches. He further submitted that A1 was not required to\ndisclose personal effects as it is exempted under Section 2(14) of the\nIncome Tax Act. Hence, the amount of Rs.15,90,350/- is liable to be\nexcluded from the computation of the assets of A1. He also submitted that\nthe entire amount with regard to footwear and sarees has to be excluded\nfrom the assets of A1 since the Trial Court has disbelieved the version of\nthe prosecution.\n\nThe learned senior counsel next turned to the expenditure. Annexure-III of\nDVAC shows that the valuation of expenditure attributable to A1 to A4 and\nthe companies during the check period is Rs.11,56,56,833/- and as per the\nprosecution the expenditure attributable to A1 is Rs.8,98,69,833/-. A1’s\ncase was that the expenditure incurred by her during the check period was\nRs.2,49,28,815/. As per the Trial Court’s judgment its value is\nRs.8,49,06,833/- (Page 1542 Vol.VI) and the findings of the High Court\nwhich has been placed before us is at Pages 889-831.\n\nHe drew the attention of this Court specifically to the following\nparticulars with regard to the Marriage of Tr. V.N. Sudhakaran:\n\nThe claim of A1 is that the amount of gifts received by her on the occasion\nof her 44th birthday was Rs.2,15,00,012/-(cash and drafts) and\nRs.77,52,059/- (foreign remittance) and this entire amount is to be allowed\nas income. He has submitted that the prosecution has admitted the receipt\nof the gift, it having been contemporaneously banked, but the amounts were\nnot taken into account as income or lawful resource available to A1. The\nTrial Court has disallowed it in entirety. However, the High Court accepted\nthe case of A1 and reduced the amount of Rs.1,50,00,000/- received from\ngift. It is submitted that the said income ought to have been taken into\nconsideration by the Trial Court.\n\nLearned senior counsel further submitted that gift has been recognized as\nvalid source of income by this Court in its judicial pronouncements and he\nrelied upon the case of M. Krishna Reddy (supra) and Kedari Lal (supra).\nIt is further pointed out that A1 had received an amount of Rs.6,28,569.00\nfrom Sasi Enterprises in her capacity as partner during the check period\nwhich was not repaid by A1 to M/s. Sasi Enterprises, thereby treating it as\nher drawings as a partner of the said firm.\n\nIt is further pointed out that A1 had received a loan of Rs.1,53,03,000.00\nfrom A2 and her proprietary firms. Jaya Publication was started in the\nyear 1988. At the relevant time, A1 and A2 were the only partners. It was\ncarrying on business of printing and was running a daily newspaper called\nNamadhu MGR. This daily newspaper used to carry all the announcements of\nthe General Secretary as also all the AIADMK Party’s news. Jaya\nPublication apart from its regular business income had also received money\nthrough subscribers deposit schemes. It is submitted that with a view to\nboost the circulation and the readership of the newspaper, the subscribers\nscheme was started one year earlier to the check period. Under the scheme\nany person could make a deposit of Rs.12,000/-, 15,000/- or 18,000/- and\nthe subscribers would receive 4, 5, or 6 copies daily free of cost,\naccording to the deposit he made. The deposit was refundable on 15 days\nnotice of demand.\n\nTo establish the receipt under the said deposit scheme, A1 produced Income\nTax returns and independent evidence from subscribers to probabilise and\nprove receipt of money. The money received under the scheme from 1990 to\n1996 was deposited in the bank account of Namadhu MGR or in the account of\nJaya Publication. It is submitted that the Income Tax authorities accepted\nthe said scheme of deposit. According to the learned senior counsel, there\nwas a scrutiny of the account of Jaya Publication and Namadhu MGR by an\ninternal auditor of the prosecution department and a report was filed. Yet\nthe auditor was not examined nor his report was marked in evidence. It is\nsubmitted that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the\nprosecution evidence on account of suppression of the material evidence.\nIt is submitted that the Trial Court committed glaring errors while dealing\nwith the scheme deposit claim of Jaya Publication. The learned counsel\nsubmitted that the accused had produced the order of the Income Tax\nauthorities relating to the scheme deposit covering the entire check period\nof 5 years which was overlooked by the Trial Court. According to him, the\ndrawing of A1 from Jaya Publication in her capacity as partner of Jaya\nPublication, to the extent of Rs.34,92,000/- is proper and lawful. It is\nfurther submitted that A1 received from Jaya Publication Rs.24,75,000/- and\nfurther amount spent by Jaya Publication on behalf of A1 for construction\nof residence at 36, Poes Garden, Chennai, at Rs.76,74,900/-. The evidence\nwas placed before the Court, being Exh.D-226 and the deposition of DW-88.\nTherefore, the total of the above two items in aggregate comes to\nRs.1,01,49,900/-. It is further submitted that the loan from Can Fin Homes\nis about Rs.75,00,000/- which was availed as loan from Can Fin Homes on\n29.9.1992. The loan was also repaid by Jaya Publication on behalf of A1 on\n27.3.1995 and the same was not repaid by A1 to Jaya Publication, thereby\ntreating it as her drawings as a partner of Jaya Publication. It is\nsubmitted that the entire amount of Rs.13,89,19,475.00 is also the resource\navailable to A1 and A2 for offering an explanation under the 1988 Act.\n\nReferring to the attribution of assets of A2 to A4, six companies and other\nfirms to A1, the learned senior counsel contended that the prosecution has\nincluded the properties acquired by the following companies to the account\nof A1 and the value of all the properties has been included in the total\nassets.\n\nThe properties held by all the above companies have been computed in\nAnnexure-II by the prosecution in a sum of Rs.4,70,24,439/-.\n\nAccording to the learned senior counsel, the companies assets required to\nbe excluded. He urged that A1 was neither a shareholder nor a director or\nassociate of these six companies. Therefore, it is submitted that there is\nno justification to attribute the properties of the companies to A1. For\nthese reasons, he submitted that the property of the company cannot be\nincluded in the holding of A1 requiring her to give an explanation. Hence,\nit is submitted that all the properties acquired by and constructed by the\nsaid companies are liable to be excluded totally from consideration and\nthus a total amount of Rs.4,70,24,439/- is liable to be excluded.\n\nThe learned senior counsel submitted that conspiracy, though can be\ninferred from circumstances, in this case, the mere fact that A1 to A4 were\nresiding in the house belonging to A1 cannot be a circumstance to prove\nconspiracy. According to him, A1 and A2 were partners in two partnership\nfirms and such partnership connection cannot be an incriminating\ncircumstance. According to him, A1 to A4 have purchased properties with\ntheir own efforts, with the money earned or mobilized by them. Accordingly,\nit is submitted that the prosecution has not established any circumstance\nfrom which an inference of conspiracy can be drawn. There is no\ncircumstance proved in this case by the prosecution from which a conclusion\ncan be drawn that there was meeting of minds of A1 to A4 with a view to\nenable A1 to commit an offence under Section 13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act. He\nfurther submitted that during the check period, starting of a firm by a non-\npublic servant could never be a circumstance by itself to infer conspiracy.\nHence, it is submitted that there is no direct or indirect evidence in the\nform of proved circumstance to infer conspiracy. Hence, it is submitted\nthat the judgment of the High Court should be affirmed.\n\nMr. Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of\nrespondent Nos.2 to 4 submitted that the abstract of Annexures-I to VII are\nassets relating to A2 to A4, firms & companies and he drew our attention to\nthe said Annexures. According to him, the properties acquired by A2 to A4,\nfirms & companies prior to the check period as per DVAC, would appear from\nthe following chart:\n\n|ANNEXURE -I |\n|Properties acquired by Accused No.2, Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises |\n|prior to check period |\n|according to DVAC which is not disputed |\n|TMT.

As mentioned hereinabove, though\nthe High Court had altered the value of five out of twelve items, in the\nultimate quantification, it did focus only on the item of new or additional\nconstruction of buildings and computed the worth thereof to be\nRs.5,10,54,060/- against Rs.22,53,92,344/- adjudged by the Trial Court.\nAccording to the prosecution, however, the investment on this count had\nbeen Rs.28,17,40,430/-. Significantly, the respondents had valued this\nitem of their assets at Rs.8,60,59,261/- which is about Rs.3.5 crores\nabove the valuation made by the High Court.\n\nBe that as it may, whereas the prosecution had listed out twenty one\nitems under the head new or additional construction of buildings, the Trial\nCourt took note of eighteen items and the High Court of seventeen items as\nwould be adverted to in details hereafter. The total construction area of\nthese twenty one items, according to the prosecution is 23,076.84 sq.\nmeters which is equivalent to 2483.97 squares. The area of four items left\nout by the High Court when deducted from the total area of 2483.97 squares\ncalculate to 2174.69 squares. However, the High Court computed the value by\nadopting the area of the 17 items selected by it to be 1668.39 squares\ninstead of 2174.69 squares and thus reduced the actual area under\nconsideration by 506.3 squares. Ergo, according to the prosecution, not\nonly did the High Court exclude four out of twenty one items in assessing\nthe value of the assets under examination, it erred as well on the\nresultant area corresponding to the seventeen items chosen by it. This did\nalso impact upon the value eventually arrived at.\n\nIn course of the arguments before this Court, emphasis has been laid on\nitem numbers 179, 180 and 181 of annexure II i.e. buildings/construction\non which investments had been made to sum up the total to the figure of\nRs.29,35,68,982/- according to the prosecution. According to the\nrespondent No. 1, as against the figure of Rs.24,29,40,490/- being the\nvalue of her assets during the check period, as computed by the\nprosecution, her assertion is of Rs.6,52,34,410/-. It has been urged on\nher behalf that she had acquired only one property during the entire check\nperiod i.e. the item at serial number 18 in anneuxre II worth Rs.10 lakhs\nand in addition thereto, she had made two constructions i.e. of a farm\nhouse at Jeedimetla Village near Hyderabad and at 31-A, Poes Garden,\nbesides renovating her residential building at 36, Poes Garden. Against\nitem numbers 179 and 181 referred to hereinabove, it has been asserted\nthat as against Rs.13,65,31,901/- assessed by the prosecution, the value of\nher assets corresponding thereto and as accepted by the income tax\nauthorities is Rs.3,62,47,700/- and thus an amount of Rs.10,02,84,201/-\nneeds to be deducted. The break up of expenditure on the relevant counts\ntowards these items has been provided as hereinbelow:\n\nWhile endeavouring to authenticate the above figure, the deficiencies in\nthe evidence of the prosecution relating to the valuation of the\nconstructions have been highlighted in quite some details. Broadly, the\ndenunciation qua the process related thereto, refers to the non-verifiable\nmeasurements in absence of essential datas and want of supporting\nparticulars in the reports rendering them sterile and worthless being of\nno probative worth, absence of any scientific or laboratory tests\nconvincingly demonstrating the age of the buildings to correctly appreciate\nthe value thereof, absence of any basis for calculating the price of non-\nscheduled items etc. Vis-a-vis the price of non-scheduled items in\nparticular, it has been asseverated that though the valuers had deposed\nthat with regard thereto, market enquires had been made and the inputs had\nbeen recorded in a paper or a note book, the same had not been retained but\ndestroyed and were not enclosed with the corresponding reports. The\nassessment of the price of the non-scheduled items has thus been dismissed\nto be not only as being bereft of any foundation but also as mere hearsay.\n\nThe oral evidence of the prosecution witnesses namely; PW-98, PW-116 and\nPW-220, amongst others, has been referred to and analysed apart from the\nreports submitted by the inspection team which as adverted to hereinabove,\nhave been repudiated to be lacking in indispensable datas. Other\ndocumentary evidence adduced by the prosecution has also been dealt with.\nEvidence of defence witnesses, amongst others of DW-64, S. Shanmugham,\nChartered Accountant of R1/A1, DW-76 who was a part of the inspection team\nand DW-78 who was one of the signatories to the report Ex. P-671 has been\nhighlighted. Considerable emphasis has also been laid on the orders of the\nincome tax authorities by way of corroboration of the quantum of\nexpenditure cited by the defence. This is more particularly as the income\ntax authorities had accepted the figure cited by the respondent No.1/A1 on\nthe basis of independent enquiries conducted by the department specifically\nin respect of the market rates/price of the marbles/granites during the\nrelevant period i.e. 1994-95 to 1996-97. The corresponding invoices have\nalso been referred to in the course of arguments. According to the\ndefence, the expenditure as shown by respondent No.1/A1 was supported by\nbank documents, bills, contemporaneous vouchers proved through defence\nwitnesses, which inter alia, establish that the price of the marble per\nsquare meter at the relevant time was between Rs.100 to Rs.180 per sq.\nmeter as against Rs.5000 per sq. meter to Rs.21000 per sq. meter cited by\nthe prosecution. While dismissing the valuation offered by the prosecution\nto be arbitrarily exaggerated and inflated, it has been asserted that\nthough the Trial Court was right in observing that the prosecution had\nnot been able to establish the cost of construction in respect of special\nitems like marble, it erred in accepting the valuation made by it after\ngranting only 20% deduction in the overall quantum. It was pointed out as\nwell that the Trial Court's rejection of the documents i.e.. D-210 series\npertaining to the price of marbles prevailing during 1995-96 by construing\nthe same erroneously to be of subsequent years, was patently flawed. It has\nbeen urged that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable\ndoubt, the expenditure towards the construction of the items under the\nhead, new or additional construction of buildings and thus no burden lay on\nthe defence to explain the amount spent towards the same. According to\nthe defence, the valuation made by the High Court of the expenditure on\nsuch construction is correct and does not merit any interference.\n\nPer contra, it has been insisted on behalf of the prosecution that though\nits computation of the expenditure against twenty one items comprising the\ninvestments in new or additional construction of buildings did sum up to\nRs.29,35,68,982/-, the Trial Court taking note of eighteen such items, did\nquantify the expenditure at Rs.22,53,92,344/-. As sample instances, the\nprosecution highlighted the expenditure towards item numbers 179,180 and\n181 of annexure II i.e. the list of items of assets acquired during the\ncheck period and referring to the oral testimony of PW-98,107 and 166 as\nwell as the reports prepared and submitted by the inspection team i.e. Ex.\nP-645, P-661 and P-671 maintained that the sum total of expenditure on the\nbasis thereof was Rs.19,05,84,199/-. Understandably, this figure was\nincluded in the total expenditure of Rs.29,35,68,982/- and had been\nhighlighted as these three items accounted for the major portion of the\ninvestments.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, the High Court not only limited its analysis\nto seventeen out of twenty one items, it also erred in the measurement of\nthe built up area of these items so much so that instead of 2174.69\nsquares, it proceeded to make the computation on the basis of an area of\n1668.39 squares i.e. yielding a short fall of 506.30 squares. In addition\nthereto, it has been urged on behalf of the prosecution that the High Court\nappraised the expenditure towards new and additional construction by taking\nonly the cost expended for a sentry shed by totally overlooking the\nadditional and highly expensive enhancements and fixtures of the main\nbuildings. According to the prosecution, whereas as per the evidence\nadduced by it, the cost of construction of the new/additional buildings was\nRs.4037 per sq. feet, the High Court on the basis of the cost of\nconstruction of the sentry shed III adopted the rate of Rs.680 per sq.\nfeet, as a result whereof the actual cost of construction of the\nnew/additional building stood reduced by 83%. The prosecution has thus\ninsisted that in quantifying the expenditure towards the construction of\nthe new/additional building, the High Court thus patently erred not only\non the actual built up area but also on the basic rate of cost by drawing\nan analogy of a sentry shed with the new/additional buildings, though\nthese two classes of structures with the inherent characteristics thereof\nwere not comparable by any means.\n\nAs referred to hereinabove, the Trial Court scrutinized the oral and\ndocumentary evidence of both sides relating to 18 items of new/additional\nconstructions out of 21 cited by the prosecution. It exhaustively\nevaluated the evidence item wise and weighed the merits and demerits\nthereof in details. It took note of the reports submitted by the\ninspection team qua every new/additional building involved and also took\ncognizance of the denunciation by the defence thereof primarily on the\nground that those lacked in details and further were not accompanied by\nsupporting documents. The Trial Court appreciated the evidence of the\nprosecution witnesses who were participants in the exercise of the\nvaluation of the buildings, the ancillary structures, accessories, fixtures\nand furnishings. The members of the inspection team, who were Civil\nEngineers drawn from the Public Works Department, in addition to Electrical\nEngineers from Electricity Department, as their evidence noticed by the\nTrial Court, would demonstrate did take into account all the essential\naspects of the subject matter of survey including the make and age of the\nstructures and also duly discounted the value thereof on depreciation. A\ncommon feature of the evidence is that the price of the electrical\nappliances mostly was assessed on the basis of their age and the expertise\nof the officers undertaking the inspection. Qua the non-scheduled items,\naccording to the prosecution witnesses, the price was ascertained from the\nmarket. The demur of the defence that such evaluation was not decisive in\nabsence of the notes of the relevant inputs was however noticed by the\nTrial Court. For the general items, the contemporaneous PWD schedule of\nrates prevailing in the districts involved were applied. The defence\nwitnesses who mostly were the members of the same team did not radically\ndiffer from the substance of the version of the prosecution witnesses. A\nmarked attribute of the prosecution witnesses, as noted by the Trial Court,\nwas that when examined on their first recall, they seemed to vacillate in\ntheir disclosures in the examination-in-chief but reaffirmed the same\nnarration on their second recall. The defence however noticing this\ndemeanour has endeavoured to discredit them as prevaricating and unfaithful\nwitnesses.\n\nAs had been elaborately appraised by the Trial Court, the evidence of the\nprosecution witnesses disclose that the members of the inspection team did\nminutely notice all the salient characteristics of the new/additional\nbuildings under surveillance together with their exquisite and expensive\nstructural attachments, trappings, fineries and adornments having\nformidable potential of enhancing their overall worth.\n\nThe Trial Court while taking note of the income tax returns disclosing\nthe expenditure statements and the orders accepting the same after the\ndepartmental inquiries however accepted the expenditure towards the\nnew/additional buildings to be Rs.22,53,92,344/- by discounting the figure\nfurnished by the prosecution by 20% as according to it, the prosecution had\nnot produced convincing evidence in support of the value fixed by the\nPublic Works Department engineers in respect of price of the special items\nand as there was some dispute regarding the payments of the architects’\nfees. In arriving at this conclusion, the Trial Court did take note of\nevery objection of the defence to the evaluation of the new/additional\nbuildings and rejected the same. In particular, the defence plea that the\nvaluation on plinth rate area ought not to have been adopted, was also\ndismissed. It took note of the evidence of DW-78 that building valuation\ncould be done on the basis of plinth area of the building or the detailed\nmethod. It was of the firm view that the engineers involved in the process\nof the evaluation of the new/additional buildings were competent for the\nassignment entrusted and that the defence had not disputed the measurement\nof the buildings and the nature of the constructions as well as the quality\nof the materials used. It however observed that the prosecution could not\nproduce any direct evidence in proof of the cost of the special items used\nand had relied on the oral testimony of its witnesses who had stated that\nthey had ascertained the price of marbles and other special items from the\nmarket.\n\nThe defence has tried to demonstrate that the rejection by the Trial Court\nof the invoices Ex.D210 series pertaining to marbles as proved by DW96\nconstruing the same to be the year 1999 was patently erroneous as the said\ndocument disclosed that those related to the period between 1994 and 1996.\nBe that as it may, the Trial Court however while rejecting the objections\nof the defence on the valuation of the new/additional buildings, effected a\nreduction of 20% of the total estimate furnished by the prosecution\nwitnesses for want of persuasive evidence in support of the recorded value\nfixed by the PWD Engineers in respect of the special items and the dispute\nregarding payments of architects fees and quantified the amount of\nexpenditure to be Rs.22,53,92,344/-.\n\nNoticeably, the exercise undertaken by the inspection team was a massive\none chancing minor shortcomings and from the Trial Court’s comprehensive\nnarrative of the evidence on record, in our view, its estimate on the basis\nthereof cannot be said to be perverse. As it is, having regard to the\nnature and size of the survey, insistence on proof beyond reasonable doubt\nwith mathematical exactitude would be both unwarranted, inexpedient and un-\npragmatic.\n\nIn our comprehension, the appreciation made by the Trial Court of the\nevidence on record and the final determination of the extent of expenditure\nincurred cannot be discarded as absurd or implausible.\n\nThe High Court on the other hand noted the reservations expressed by the\ndefence to the valuation made by the prosecution. It noted the\ndenouncement that the valuation made was highly inflated and that the cost\nof marbles and granites have been assessed on a very exorbitant measure.\nThe remonstrance that neither any sample of marble or granite had been\ntaken nor tenders had been called for to ascertain the rates thereof was\nrecorded. The objection that forests officers have not been examined to\nprice the cost of the wood and that nobody had certified that the teakwood\nhad been used, was accounted for. The High Court did take cognizance of\nthe reference to the inquiries made by the Income Tax Department to\nascertain the prevailing rates of marble and marble slabs during the\nrelevant period. Defence evidence to that effect was also marked.\n\nThe High Court in the ultimate analysis adopted the “per square foot\nmethod” in evaluating the value of the new/additional buildings. According\nto it, the Public Works Department rates were supposedly higher, taking\ninto consideration the delayed payment and other miscellaneous expenses.\nThe High Court accepted the cost of construction of the new/additional\nbuildings to be Rs.28,000/- per square basing on the rate of construction\nof the Sentry Shed-III. Referring to the estimate for construction of such\nsentry shed, the High Court deduced that, it was valued for one square at\nRs.31,580/- and therefrom as a measure of cost of construction for\nnew/additional building, it applied Rs.28,000/- per square for the said\npurpose. It accounted for the other investments towards super structures,\nwindows, doors, internal painting, electrification, flooring, water supply\netc. The total constructed area, according to the High Court, was\n1,66,839.68 sq.ft. i.e. 1668.39 squares. It accepted an area of 25662.22\nsq.ft. i.e. 256.62 squares as area on which granites had been used. It\nadded an amount of Rs.9,65,060/- towards expenditure for sanction of plan\nand architect fees.\n\nQua the prosecution evidence, the High Court observed that though reports\nhad been prepared by the inspection team for the new/additional buildings\ninvolved, all the members of inspection team did not subscribe their\nsignatures thereto. Further in course of the testimony, they did not speak\nanything about the measurement of the floor area where marbles and granites\nhad been used. It held the view that the valuation reports by themselves\ndid not prove the estimate of granites and marble stones and that the\nappreciation thereof was more or less on guess work. By adopting the\nvaluation on square feet method and by applying the rate of Rs.28,000/- per\nsquare, the High Court computed the value of new/additional building with\nall its accessories and furnishings to be Rs.5,10,54,060/-.\n\nPrima facie thus the plea of the prosecution that in assessing the\nexpenditure of new/additional buildings, the High Court had not only taken\na reduced constructed area of 1668.39 sqs. instead of 2174.69 sqs. (for the\n17 items considered by it), thereby introducing a shortfall of 506.3 sqs.,\nit also applied the rate of Rs.28,000/- per square based on the\nconstruction cost of a sentry shed, as the base value to work out the\namount of investments made towards the new/additional\nbuildings/constructions is borne out by the records.\n\nThe approach of the High Court on both counts in the face of the evidence\non record does not commend for acceptance. By no means, in our estimate,\nthe High Court could have applied the base value of Rs.28,000/- per square\nfor quantifying the expenditure incurred towards the new/additional\nbuildings/ constructions involved. The adoption of Rs.28,000/- per square\nas the base value, which is the cost of construction of a sentry shed, per\nse is erroneous, having regard to the fact that a sentry shed and the\nnew/additional constructions/buildings are incomparable on many counts.\nEven if it is assumed, as has been pleaded by the defence that the base\nvalue so applied was only for appreciating the expenditure towards the\nskeletal framework of the constructions, the method adopted by the High\nCourt in the final computation of the investments by making lump sum\nadditions towards cost of marbles, granites/interior decorations,\nstaircase, overhead tank and other furnishings, having regard to the\ndescription of the constructions/buildings does not appear to be either\nrealistic or rational and does not merit affirmation.\n\nIn any case however even assuming that the arithmetic undertaken by the\nHigh Court is correct, it having accepted the value of assets to be\nRs.66,44,73,573/-, the remainder would still value at Rs.43,75,38,688/-. In\nother words, in calculating the disproportionate assets, the amount of\nRs.43,75,38,688/- has to be applied even if there is a reduction in value\nof assets by Rs.22,69,34,885/ i.e. (Rs.29,82,71,254.32 – Rs.5,10,54,060).\n\nAccording to A2 to A4, the valuation of their assets at the beginning of\nthe check period as per the prosecution was Rs.59,29,168/- and according to\nthem Rs.63,64,790.60. At the end of the check period, the figure swelled,\nas per the prosecution to Rs.37,55,10,354.38, which in their computation\nbecame Rs.25,03,36,963.40/-. Thus, whereas the prosecution case is that\nthe valuation of their assets acquired by A2 to A4 during the check period\nwas Rs.36,95,81,186.38, it had been only Rs.24,39,72,172.80 as per the\nestimate of these respondents.\n\nA2 to A4 have not disputed the prosecution's figure of Rs.59,29,168/- and\nin fact had added Rs.4,35,622/- being the cash balance available with A2\nat that point of time making the tally according to the respondents at\nRs.63,64,790.60. While commenting on the prosecution's valuation of their\nassets at the end of the check period at Rs.37,55,10,354.38, A2 to A4 have\nasserted that the properties of six companies; Signora Business Enterprises\n(Private) Limited, Meadow Agro Farms (Private) Limited, Ram Raj Agro Mills\n(Private) Limited, Riverway Agro Products (Private) Limited, Lex Property\nDevelopment (P) Limited and Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Limited\nbeing separate legal entities and not arraigned as accused in the case\nought to have been excluded from the corpus of assets, more particularly\nin absence of any evidence that their acquisitions had been made with the\nfunds provided by the respondents.\n\nIn course of the arguments on their behalf, several disputed items of\nassets have been highlighted, accompanied by emphatic assertion that either\nthe value attached thereto ought to be excluded wholly or to the extent\nreduced on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence relied upon by\nthem.\n\nA plain perusal of the compilation to this effect reveals that broadly\nthese disputed items can be categorized as “land and building, shares,\nacquisition of Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Ltd., new/additional\nconstructions, renovation, vehicles, fixed deposits, jewellery and\nmachinery.\n\nAs has been hinted hereinabove, these assets had been classified under 12\ncomponents. The High Court, though had altered the valuations in five of\nthese items, it did ultimately limit its consideration to item No. III\n(i.e. new/additional construction of buildings) and reduced the cost\nthereof by Rs.22,69,34,885. As a corollary, for the purpose of the\neventual quantification of the disproportionate assets, the High Court did\nnot consider it essential to invoke its findings vis-a-vis the remaining\nfour items on which it had differed from the Trial Court. As would be\nevident from the chart adduced by the defence, out of Part-B containing the\ndisputed items in Annexure-II appended to the charge-sheet, ten items\nthereof i.e. item numbers 6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17 are claimed to have\nbeen acquired prior to the check period. Vis-a-vis the other disputed\nitems, to reiterate, referring to the oral and documentary evidence, it has\nbeen urged that either the full value as cited by the prosecution or to\nthe extent, highlighted by them, ought to have been excluded. Qua the\nitems pertaining to “new/additional constructions”, the eventual plea is\nthat the Trial Court though had concluded that the prosecution had failed\nto prove the cost of construction, as cited by it, it erroneously accepted\nthe valuation by granting 20% reduction in the overall cost. According to\nA2 to A4, in view of the failure of the prosecution to prove the cost of\nconstruction, the entire valuation made by it to this effect ought to have\nbeen discarded and the evidence adduced by it should have been rejected in\nits entirety.\n\nIn course of the elaboration of this salient feature of the disputation,\nit has been underlined that there has been non-application of mind by the\nTrial Court to the evidence on record in arriving at its findings. Apart\nfrom referring to the oral and documentary evidence adduced by both the\nparties, reliance has also been placed amongst others on the income tax\nreturns and the orders passed in connection therewith. The valuation\nreports of the buildings submitted by the inspection team, comprised of\ncivil engineers of the Public Works Department and others, have been\nseriously repudiated on the ground of being laconical, incredible,\ninchoate and deficient in material particulars. The respondents have\nbeen particularly critical about the valuation of electrical installations\nand other items as in their perception, those were wholly unfounded in\nabsence of standard rates and corroborative proof based on market survey.\nEven the expertise and competence of the members of the inspection team\noffered by the prosecution as witnesses of valuation has been questioned.\nThe respondents have sought to buttress this plea by examining as defence\nwitnesses, members of the same inspection team. It has been urged as well\nthat the prosecution could not prove that all new/additional constructions\nhad been built during the check period. It has been contended that the\nvaluation of the special items i.e. marbles, granites, sanitary ware,\ndecorative tiles, teakwood etc. in absence of any schedule of rates had\nbeen highly inflated without any contemporaneous documents or authenticated\nproof in support thereof. According to the respondents, the defence\nwitnesses who were members of the inspection team did not support the\nconclusions recorded in the reports rendering those wholly unacceptable.\nOn smaller items, like vehicles, fixed deposits, jewellery and machinery,\nthe respondents have dismissed the valuations made by the prosecution\neither on the ground that those had been wrongly exaggerated or had been\nacquired before the check period.\n\nApropos the above impeachment, the prosecution has reiterated its\nvaluation of the assets and has reconciled to the quantification made by\nthe Trial Court. It has reiterated that the valuation of the constructions\nhad been made by the qualified PWD engineers and that the findings are\nelaborately contained in the valuation reports, based on exhaustive\ninspection of all necessary components of the buildings surveyed. It has\nstoutly refuted the defence plea that the Trial Court had rejected the\nevidence adduced and has maintained that the discount of 20% accorded by\nthe Trial Court had been due to the several imponderables attendant on the\nmassive exercise undertaken. It has insisted that in view of the superior\nquality of marbles and granite used in the buildings as well as the\nprevalent price of the various special items availed by way of ornate\nenhancements, the cost appreciation made by the Trial Court was justified.\nThat the High Court had wrongly assessed the cost of new/additional\nbuildings at Rs.5,10,54,060 compared to the admitted computation by the\nrespondents at Rs.8,60,59,261 has been underscored as well.\n\nQua the other segments of the assets, the prosecution has underlined that\nthe Trial Court had totally excluded the valuation of sarees and footwear\nand that had effected considerable reduction in the value of the jewellery\nand silverwares. In all, according to the prosecution, though it had cited\nhigher value of the assets, it has accepted the determination thereof as\nmade by the Trial Court.\n\nThe prosecution has jettisoned the disclosures in the income tax returns\nand the orders/opinions expressed thereon by the departmental authorities\nas wholly inconsequential. It has been insisted that enquiries made by the\nincome tax authorities even if conducted, those had been ex-parte in which\nthe investigating agency had not been associated. In any view of the\nmatter, according to the prosecution, the findings of the income tax or\nwealth tax authorities on the valuation of the assets, neither bind the\nprosecution nor is of any conclusive relevance for the case and is far less\nfinal for the criminal court trying the same. The cavil of the respondents\nthat the civil engineers of the inspection team were incompetent to\nundertake the valuation work has been emphatically refuted by the\nprosecution. That the High Court in adopting the plinth area of the\nnew/additional buildings had erroneously reduced the same by 50,630 sq.\nfeet, has been reiterated. It has been asserted as well that the High\nCourt had erred in taking into account only five special items by excluding\nthe other expensive furnishings/attachments in computing the cost of\nconstruction. In specific terms, the prosecution has been critical of the\nvaluation of the Otis lift at Rs.15,000/- and the cost of construction of\nstaircase, pump and overhead tanks at Rs.40,000/- to be much on the lower\nside. That the untenable attempt of the defence to represent that ordinary\nmarble and granite had been issued against expensive versions thereof, has\nbeen highlighted as well.\n\nAs indicated hereinabove, the only item apart from the new or additional\nconstruction of buildings forming a major component of assets is immovable\nproperties which the prosecution valued at Rs.19,77,18,164.70 whereas the\nTrial Court assessed the same Rs.20,07,80,246/-. According to the High\nCourt, it computed the value to be Rs.6,24,09,120/-. Noticeably the\nrespondents had indicated the value of this item as Rs.16,19,03,301/-.\nSignificantly though in all, 146 sale deeds were involved qua the immovable\nproperties figuring therein, the High Court limited its attention only to\n97 such deeds and thus left out from its consideration, the remaining 49\nsale deeds, while arriving at its quantification of this item of the asset\nto be Rs.6,24,09,120/-.\n\nTo reiterate however the High Court though did accept the valuation of the\nassets for the purpose of computation to be Rs.66,44,73,573/- as valued by\nthe prosecution, for the purpose of ascertaining the disproportionate\nassets, it took into account only the cost of new or additional\nconstruction of buildings as assessed by it at Rs. 5,10,54,060/- thus\nreducing the value thereof as made by the prosecution by a sum of\nRs.22,69,34,885/-. The omission on the part of the High Court to exclude\nthe other four items of assets, on which as well it had scaled down the\nvalue, in working out the extent of disproportionate assets however had not\nbeen questioned by the respondents before this Court. The judgment of the\nTrial Court does not demonstrate as well, the alleged total non-\nconsideration of the evidence adduced on behalf of the respondents. On an\noverall appraisal of the materials on record, the reduction of the cost of\nnew or additional construction of buildings to Rs.5,10,54,060/- as effected\nby the High Court has to be held as patently erroneous. Consequently the\nquantification of the disproportionate assets is also visibly wrong.\n\nExpenditure\n\nAnnexure IV to the charge-sheet enumerates 244 items of expenditure cited\nby the prosecution. This sums up to Rs.11,56,56,833.41 out of which the\nmajor segment being Rs.6,45,04,222/- is towards the expenditure incurred in\nconnection with the marriage of Tr. V.N. Sudhakaran, (A3) on 07.09.1995.\nIncidentally, the High Court did accept the expenditure assessed by the\nprosecution in respect of all items except item nos. 2 to 6 i.e. the\nmarriage of A3 and reduced the sum of Rs.6,45,04,222/- as fixed by the DVAC\nto Rs.28,68,000/-, thus occasioning a drop of Rs.6,16,36,222/-. The Trial\nCourt however had also lessened the amount cited by the prosecution by\nRs.7,50,000/- against item No. 235 and also the marriage item by\nRs.3,45,04,222/-, thereby reducing the total expenditure incurred to\nRs.8,49,06,833/-. The Trial Court had assessed Rs.3,00,00,000/- towards\nmarriage expenses.\n\nIn this factual premise, it would thus be enough, for the present\nadjudication vis-à-vis this facet of the debate, to confine the appraisal\nof the evidence, oral and documentary pertaining only to the expenditure\ntowards the marriage of A3. As the Trial Court’s appreciation of the\nmaterials on record would reveal, it analyzed the evidence under the\nfollowing heads:\n\n2 b) Expenditure incurred towards the cost of food, mineral\nwater and tamboolam.\n\nc) Cost of 34 Titan watches - Rs.1,34,565/-\n\nd) Cost of stitching charges of wedding dress - Rs.1,26,000/-\n\ne) Cost of 100 silver plates - Rs.4,00,000/-\n\nf) Postal Expenses - Rs.2,24,000/-\n\nIn re the erection of marriage pandals, the Trial Court did assess the\noral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties. It took note,\namongst others, of the testimony of PW-181 Shri Thangarajan, who was the\nAssistant Engineer, PWD at the relevant point of time and to whom,\naccording to the witness, the work of estimating the expenses incurred\ntowards the pandals, both at the marriage and reception venues was\nentrusted. He referred to the measurements of these pandals including\namongst others those for VIPs with iron-sheet roof in his report Ex. P-1019\nmentioning the estimated cost towards the same and also with regard to the\nincidental decorative trappings and furnishings. He mentioned as well\nabout the air conditioners used and the chairs with the dining tables\narranged at the two venues and assessed the expenditure towards all these\nat Rs.5,91,00,000/-. The Trial Court did take note of the cross-\nexamination of this witness, branding him to be partisan and without any\npersonal knowledge or information about the event or the expenses in\nconnection therewith and alleged to have been set up by the prosecution\nwith a view to inflate the expenditure by creating the document Ex P-1019.\nThe said document in any case was denounced as not being contemporaneous,\nhaving been prepared after 2 ½ years of the marriage without any acceptable\nfoundation therefor.\n\nThe Trial Court to start with did not endorse this criticism of the\nwitness and instead proceeded to evaluate the merit of his testimony by co-\nrelating the same with the version of the other witnesses. In doing so, the\nTrial Court traversed the evidence of PW-200 Shri, K.P. Muthuswami, Chief\nEngineer, PWD, Tamil Nadu, who, as stated by this witness, had been\nentrusted to complete the pandals' work by A2 in a proper manner. This\nwitness testified to have consulted a plan given to him by the architect\ninvolved whereafter he amongst others levelled the land and put up the\npandals as specified. This witness affirmed that several pandals had been\nerected amongst others for serving food to the VIPs, kitchen and cooking\nsheds together with marriage platform, bathroom, rooms for the bride and\nbridegroom. He further stated that the expenses towards this construction\nwork were made on behalf of A1. This witness clarified that the pandal\nwork at the reception venue was undertaken by Kumarason Nader which too he\nhad to oversee on the instructions of the Assistant Secretary of the\nsecretariat of A1. According to this witness, an amount of Rs.14 lakhs in\nfour installments was also paid by the bride’s father Mr. Narayan Swamy.\nIncidentally PW-181 had also referred to the same architect and the\ncontractors as named by PW-200 in his evidence.\n\nThe Trial Court after taking note of the cross-examination of this\nwitness, accepted his version being satisfied that he had a first-hand\ninformation about the arrangements made at the marriage venue and\nconcluded that the same corroborated the testimony of PW-181 sufficiently.\n\nThe Trial Court assessed the evidence of PW-183 Mr. Ramesh, Managing\nDirector, Moulis Advertising Services (P) Ltd., who deposed to have\nprinted 65,000 cards for marriage invitation as instructed by Tr. Jawahar,\nAssistant Secretary to A1. This witness also claimed to have printed 5000\ncar passes for which on the basis of his bill submitted, he had received\npayment of Rs.11 lakhs through cheque issued by A1. Though this witness\nresiled from these statements in his cross-examination, when recalled and\nwas confronted with this inconsistency, he affirmed his version in the\nexamination-in-chief to be correct.\n\nPW-184 Mr. Vincent claimed to have lent out ten cars on hire and had\nreceived Rs.27,502/- through cheque signed by A1. This witness too\nrecoiled from this statement in his cross-examination but reverted thereto\nin his re-examination.\n\nPW-185 Prem Kumar did state to have, on the requisition of the Tamil Nadu\nGuest House lent six cars for rent for four days against which he was paid\nRs.19,211/- through cheque 23.09.1995 issued by A1.\n\nThe Trial Court next also took note of the evidence of PW-186 Chalapathy\nRao who had supplied chairs, tables, cooking wares, vessels etc. for the\nevent as ordered by A3 and Sachitnanandam, PRO of A1 and received payment\nof Rs 1,30,000/- by cheque as advance. He also received a further amount\nof Rs.57,250/- by cheque issued by A1 and according to him, Rs.2,65,000/-\nwas still outstanding. This witness too vacillated in his cross-\nexamination only to affirm the correctness of the statement in his\nexamination-in-chief after he was recalled for re-examination.\n\nThe endeavour on the part of the defence that the payment received by this\nwitness by way of cheque of Rs.1,30,000/- was in fact towards supply made\nto the AIADMK Party was dismissed by the Trial Court in absence of any\nevidence to that effect.\n\nThe Trial Court also examined the evidence of PW-188, Sundareshan, who was\nthe Senior Advertisement Manager of a local daily in which a thanks giving\nmessage of A1 had been published in its issue dated 10.09.1995. According\nto this witness, such an advertisement was published in all other editions\nof the daily on 11.09.1995 as well and that he had raised a bill of Rs.\n2,47,660/- therefor.\n\nThe evidence of PW-199 A.G. Krishnamurti of A.G.K. Travels, Chennai is\nthat he had arranged two Ambassador AC cars from 06.09.1995 to\n08.09.1995 on rent, raised bills in the name of A1 and received payment of\nRs.15,814/- through cheque issued by her.\n\nPW228 Shri Rajasekharan, Chartered Accountant claimed to have filed Income\nTax and Property Tax returns of A1 for year 1984-85 to 1996-97 and stated\nabout seizures amongst others of a file Ex. P-2218 containing the\nexpenditure bills, receipts etc. in connection with the marriage. This\nwitness was not cross-examined at the first instance on behalf of the\nrespondents and thereafter he failed to appear in spite of issuance of\nsummons. Though the defence raised a plea that in absence of cross-\nexamination of this witness, his untested testimony ought to be eschewed,\nthe Trial Court noted that neither the respondents-accused had cross-\nexamined this witness when the opportunity was available nor had\nthereafter, when as many as 145 witnesses have been recalled for cross-\nexamination, did they seek the assistance of the court to secure his\npresence, if necessary by applying coercive legal process. Even otherwise,\naccording to the Trial Court the testimony of this witness pertained mainly\nto the seizure of the documents from his office which included amongst\nothers, the file containing vouchers, receipts etc. relating to the\nexpenditure incurred in the marriage of A3. This is more so as some of\nthese documents had also been relied upon by the respondents-accused.\n\nVis-a-vis the expenditure incurred towards cost of food, mineral water and\nthamboolam, the Trial Court did assess the evidence of PW-237, Jawahar,\nwho at the relevant time, was working as Assistant Secretary to A1 and his\noffice functioned amongst others from her house at No.36, Poes Garden.\nThis witness stated about musical concerts presented by Mr. Srinivas and\nMr. A.R. Rahman whom he had met for such arrangement on the direction of\nA1. He deposed about the printing of invitation cards for the VIPs. He\nalso stated generally about the other features of the marriage including\nthe supervision of the pandal works by Mr. K.P. Muthuswamy, a retired\nEngineer. This witness too had resiled from the above, in his cross-\nexamination but reiterated, in his re-examination, his testimony in his\nexamination-in-chief.\n\nThe defence plea that the afore-mentioned witnesses in view of their\ncontradictory orientations ought to be discarded as a whole did not meet\nthe approval of the Trial Court. It recorded that not only the evidence of\nsuch witnesses does not deserve to be discredited as a whole and instead\ncan be acted upon on the same analogy as of a hostile witness, the\ncircumstances under which 76 prosecution witnesses were recalled by the\nrespondents/accused after A1 had assumed the office of the Chief Minister\nof the State and the way, 64 of them had casually resiled from their\nearlier version, could not be lightly brushed aside. The Trial Court\nobserved that as most of these witnesses who were in service in the\nGovernment Departments, were likely to be influenced by the status of A1,\nit being one of the considerations for which the trial of the case had\nbeen transferred out of Tamil Nadu to Karnataka, it concluded that the\ntemporary retraction of these witnesses in cross-examination from their\ntestimony in their examination-in-chief ipso facto did not warrant\nrejection of their version in toto.\n\nThe Trial Court noted the evidence of PW-192 Mr. Sanjay Jain, Proprietor\nof Titan Show Room, Chennai to the effect that he had delivered 34 watches\namounting to Rs.1,34,565/- for which he was paid the amount in cash.\n\nPW-196 Mr. Sayad Bawker, claimed to have done the stitching work of suits,\nshirts, sherwanis etc. for the bridegroom-A3 for which he received\nRs.1,41,025/- as the charges therefor. The witness conceded that the\npayment was made by Ram Kumar, the maternal uncle of the bride. The Trial\nCourt however disbelieved the statement that the uncle of the bride had\nmade the payment.\n\nOn the expenditure of 100 silver plates, the prosecution had examined PW-\n191, Mr. Srinivas and PW-214 Mr. A.R. Rehman who had conducted music\nconcerts. Both of them stated to have made the performances on the request\nmade on behalf of A1 and that they had not charged therefor. They however\nadmitted to have been offered silver plate, silk saree and a small kumkum\nbox at the time of their invitation for the event. They deposed that on\nbeing requisitioned by the investigating agency, those items had been\nhanded over to the concerned officers.\n\nActing on the evidence of these witnesses, the Trial Court concluded that\non the occasion of the marriage, silver plates, silk saree/dhoti and kumkum\nbox were presented to the VIPs.\n\nRegarding postal expenses, the prosecution relied on the evidence of PW-\n189 Office Administrator, Head Office of AIADMK who confirmed to have sent\n56,000 invitations, expending therefor, Rs.2,24,000/-. He stated to have\nreceived the said amount from Mr. Jawahar, Assistant/Joint Secretary of A1.\n\nIn response, the respondents had examined several witnesses with documents\nto butress and consolidate the oral testimony. DW1 Ram Kumar, the maternal\nuncle of the bride in his deposition claimed to have met the entire\nexpenses of the marriage and for that purpose, had opened an account in\nState Bank of India being Account No. 95071 in Gopal Puram Branch, State\nBank of India and had remitted a sum of Rs.92 lakhs which was spent on the\noccasion. He also proved Ex. D15, the photocopy of the pass book of the\nsaid account and stated that the deposit had been arranged through the\nbrides' family. In cross-examination, he disclosed that the account was\nopened on 14.8.1995 but did not disclose the details of the expenditure\ntherefrom. He also did not produce the counter-foils of the cheques\nissued in that account. His statement in cross-examination also revealed\nthat he had not produced a copy of the passbook earlier in course of the\ninvestigation. He however affirmed that the total expenditure in the\nmarriage did sum up to Rs.92 lakhs only.\n\nApart from this witness, the respondents examined a host of party workers\nwho, at the relevant time, held various positions at the district level and\nelsewhere. These witnesses, as the tenor of their testimony demonstrates,\nin essence asserted that they had collected various sums of money from the\nparty workers and others and had utilized the same for various purposes\nrelating to the marriage like decorating the pandals erected by the bride\nparty, crackers, music, food for the party workers, chairs in the\npandals, reception on the visit of A1 to areas in connection with the event\netc. All these witnesses, however, did admit that there was no\ninstruction from the party to raise such fund and incur the expenditure but\ninsisted that they had given their statements before the income tax\ndepartment in course of the enquiry made in this regard. The witnesses\nalso did concede that accounts/receipts in connection with the collection\nand expenditures had not been retained/maintained.\n\nIn addition to the above, the respondents examined DW64 S. Shanmugam,\nChartered Accountant who claimed to be the auditor of A1 from 1996 to 2000\nand had dealt with her accounts/assessment for the assessment years 1991-\n92 to 1997-98. He referred to the query made by the income tax department\nin the year 1995 about the amounts spent by her in the marriage and also\nthe reply given by A1 in response thereto. He also deposed that on\nnecessary enquries being made, the income tax authorities eventually did\nwrite off the expenditure of Rs.94 lakhs, which earlier, it had observed,\nhad been spent by A1 on the event. Reference was also made to the\nassessment made by the income tax authorities with regard to food expenses\nto the tune of Rs.3 lakhs which also stood deleted in appeal.\n\nDW24 T. Tharani, who was a painter and also Art Director of the films, was\nexamined to affirm that in connection with the marriage, people from AIADMK\nparty had approached him for designing the facade of the entrance of the\nmarriage hall and that he had entrusted the work to one of his assistants\nMr. Ramesh. He also added that he did not charge any remuneration for the\nwork.\n\nDW54 Gopi Kant, at the relevant time, was working as Cine Art Director and\nstated that on being requested by the bride's family, he met DW1 Ram Kumar,\nmaternal uncle of the bride who introduced him to PW 200, Muthu Swamy.\nThis witness stated that PW 200 asked him to prepare a pandal at the place\nof reception/public procession of the bride and the bridegroom and to erect\ntwo arches and sets at the designated locations. According to him, the\ncost of the work was Rs.12,98,000/- which was paid by cheque in the name\nof G.K. Arts by DW1 Ram Kumar. That a further cheque of Rs.4 lakhs was\nalso issued by DW1 towards some items of additional work, was also stated\nby this witness. The witness confirmed that he was the proprietor of G.K.\nArts.\n\nThe respondents also examined DW80, B. Vasudevan who, at the relevant\ntime, was working as Junior Engineer, PWD, Madras. The witness deposed\nthat the investigating officer of the case on 17.4.1997 had orally\ninstructed him to value the marriage pandal and other works. This witness\nidentified his signature in the report Ex. P1019 but maintained that the\ndrawings pertaining to the pandals and the stage had not been given by\nVijay Shankar, Architect and that he did not know where the said panals had\nbeen put up. He stated that the measurements mentioned in the report were\nbased on the instructions of the I.O. and that the said report had been\nprepared in the office without carrying out any inspection. He also\ndisputed the measurements mentioned in the report.\n\nIn cross-examination, however, this witness admitted that he along with PW\n181 Thangrajan were the members of the valuation team and also conceded\nthat the report contained the signatures of the Architect, Vijay Shankar.\n\nDW-85, as offered by the respondents, was the Manager (Administration &\nAccounts) in Super Duper TV Private Limited, who conducted the TV coverage\nof the wedding for which, according to this witness, a sum of Rs.2 lakhs\nwas paid by DW1. In cross-examination, this witness admitted that at that\ntime, the bridegroom- A3- Sudhakaran and A2- Sasikala were the directors of\nSuper Duper T.V. Pvt. Limited and that A3 was its Managing Director.\n\nDW-97 A. Vijay Kumar, Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Central\nCircle-II, Chennai produced documents containing 10 volumes and exhibited\nEx. D325 to D364, referred to by the other witnesses for the defence. This\nwitness however admitted that the assessment for the year 1993-94\npertaining to the concerned respondents was sub judice before the High\nCourt in appeal and that the assessment orders relating to them had not\nbeen finalised and were pending before various authorities.\n\nIt has been emphatically urged that the evidence of PW181 ought to have\nbeen summarily rejected being hearsay and besides speculative, arbitrary\nand based on no verifiable data and that this witness is wholly\nuntrustworthy even otherwise. It was insisted on behalf of the respondents\nthat the learned Trial Court had also rejected the evidence of PW181 to be\nhearsay in character and thus in absence of any other admissible evidence,\nits computation of the expenditure at Rs.3 crores is also without any\ntangible basis and is wholly inferential. The testimony of PW181 being\nclearly hearsay in nature, in terms of Section 60 of the Evidence Act, the\nsame could not have been accepted as substantive evidence and thus the\nTrial Court's approach of seeking corroboration thereto had also been\nflawed. According to the respondents, the version of PW200 supports the\ncase of the accused in view of his admission that Rs.16 lakhs was paid by\nthe bride’s father towards the expenses for the construction of the\npandals. It has been urged that his evidence as well is rejectable as\nhearsay in nature, as this witness did not personally know about the\nexpenses, if any made by A1 and that he had only been informed of the\ncontribution of A1 by some unnamed pandal contractors. In absence of any\nevidence to show that A1 had incurred the expenditure, as claimed by the\nprosecution, towards the construction of the marriage pandal or towards the\nactual cost thereof, the entire amount of Rs.5.21 crores, as cited by the\nprosecution, ought to be deducted. Qua the expenses on the other heads\nincluding food, mineral water, presentations, stitching charges, etc., it\nhas been argued that not only the Trial Court had wrongly accepted the\nevidence forthcoming from the prosecution that the expenditure on Titan\nwatches and stitching charges had been incurred by the respondents, it\ngrossly erred in holding that on a rough estimate, an amount of Rs.3\ncrores had been spent by the respondents on the event. It has been\ncanvassed that in doing so, the Trial Court left out of consideration\namongst others, the evidence adduced by the defence through DW1 Ram Kumar,\nthe maternal uncle of the bride, the party workers and most importantly the\nincome tax proceedings, which after thorough enquiries and scrutiny at\ndifferent levels did finally record that only an amount of Rs.29,66,552/-,\nas mentioned by A1 in her reply dated 19.09.2005, had been spent and that\ntoo by cheques except for a sum of Rs.3 lakhs. In all, having regard to\nthe entire gamut of the evidence, it has been argued that considering the\ndifferent segments of expenditures incurred by the bride’s family and the\nparty workers, the same is Rs.1,85,17,000/-, to which Rs.29,66,552/- only\ncould be added on account of A1. In this premise, the respondents have\nmaintained that the High Court’s computation of the expenses of\nRs.28,68,000/- only by A1 by way of expenditure incurred by the respondents\nis unassailably correct being based on a logical analysis of the materials\non record.\n\nThe High Court however readily discarded the testimony of PW181 and the\nreport Ex.P1019 primarily on the ground that this witness had no personal\nknowledge or idea of the structures raised at the venue of the marriage and\nof the reception and that his version with regard thereto was on the basis\nof derived inputs though it mentioned that the witness, as attested by him,\ndid consult the architect, the Art Director, the electrician etc. who\naccompanied him to the site and that he had been given as well a drawing\nof the wedding choultry and the measurements of the pandal along with the\nsketch of the decorative arches etc. It held the view that the witness had\nprepared the report on the basis of what the witness had heard and seen\nfrom the drawings and the sketches and was not personally aware of the\nauthenticity thereof and that he did not ask for quotations or confirm the\nsketches. That his report Ex.P1019 was deficient and scanty in essential\nparticulars to inspire confidence for its acceptance was recorded. On this\naspect, the High Court also referred to the evidence of PW200 K.P.\nMuthuswamy, who claimed to have been entrusted to oversee the works related\nto the pandals by A2. This witness, to reiterate had confirmed that he\nvisited both the venues and that a plan for the pandals as well as stage\narrangements, as prepared by architect Vijay Shankar had been handed over\nto him. He narrated in details about the specifications of the structures\nand the payments therefor. He also admitted to have received a sum of\nRs.16 lakhs from the father of the bride in this regard. The High Court,\nhowever observed that this witness, amongst others, did neither tell the\npolice about the expenses of leveling nor disclose the particulars about\nthe number of air conditioner machines used. The High Court further\ncommented that he did not supervise the work of Art Director Gopi Nath and\nthat this witness could not remember as to how much money was spent for the\nmarriage. The High Court touched upon the evidence of other witnesses and\nin particular elaborated on the testimony of PW228 R. Rajshekheran from\nwhom the file containing the original vouchers, bills, invoices in\nconnection with the marriage i.e. Ex. P2218 had been seized. It also\nanalyzed the queries made by the Income Tax Department and the reply given\nthereto by A1 by her letter dated 19.09.1995 wherein, she provided the\nbreakup of the expenditure incurred by her. The testimony of DW1 Ram\nKumar, the maternal uncle of the bride, more specifically to the effect\nthat the entire expenses had been borne by the bride’s family to the tune\nof Rs.92 lakhs by remittances through the bank account opened on 14.08.1995\nwas taken note of. The evidence of the party workers claiming their\ncontribution in the expenditure through collection was also recorded and\neventually the High Court accepted the statement of A1 furnished to the\nIncome Tax Department disclosing the expenditure by her of Rs.28,67,520/-\ntowards marriage and rounded up the said figure to Rs.28,68,000/- to be her\nshare of expenses.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, apart from rejecting the testimony of PW181\nbeing second hand in nature, the High Court seemingly accepted in\nsubstance the version of the defence witnesses observing that at the\nrelevant time A1 was the Chief Minister of the State and was incidentally\nthen the General Secretary of AIADMK party as well. It recorded further\nthat the bride was none else than the grand-daughter of famous cine actor\nShivaji Ganeshan. It observed that the prosecution for no reason\nforthcoming, had omitted to examine the bride’s father who would have been\nthe best person to state about the actual expenses on the marriage. The\nHigh Court as well seem to have accepted that it was the customary practice\nfor the bride’s family to bear the expenses of the marriage normally and\nthough it was of the view that such expenditure was comprised of verifiable\nand non-verifiable components, it was difficult to ascertain the non-\nverifiable segment while verifiable expenditure could be assessed through\ninvestigation. Et al, the High Court eventually accepted the figure of\nRs.28,67,520/-, as cited by the A1 to be the amount expended by her in the\nmarriage and limited the liability of the respondent- accused, as stated\nabove, to Rs.28,68,000/-. Thereby the High Court reduced the expenditure\nof Rs.6,45,04,222/- towards marriage expenditure by the R1/A1, as mentioned\nby the prosecution, to Rs.28,68,000/-.\n\nA2 to A4 also have positioned themselves to question the expenditure of\nRs.2,38,89,609/- attributed to them by the prosecution. This amount, as is\napparent from annexure IV to the charge sheet, includes sums expended not\nonly by A2, A3 and A4 but also by nine companies/firms as named therein.\nIn the compilation referred to in course of the arguments, the break up of\nthe expenditures incurred by A2, A3, A4 and the firms aforementioned have\nbeen provided. It is however the contention of A2 to A4 that an amount of\nRs.1,63,06,897.16 is liable to be deducted on the grounds as enumerated in\nthe compilation so much so that the total admitted expenditure by them and\ntheir firms as named by the prosecution was Rs.75,82,712.17. Qua the\ndisputed items, it has been urged on behalf of these respondents that the\nTrial Court had overlooked the defence evidence and instead had received\nthe version of the prosecution witnesses though on the face of the records,\nthe corresponding expenditures had not been proved. According to the\nrespondents, apart from these infirmities, the Trial Court also ignored,\namongst others, the aspect that on several items of expenditure by way of\npayment of interest, these respondents had been subjected to double\njeopardy inasmuch as though these sums had been accounted for in computing\ntheir net profits, these amounts were shown separately again as\nexpenditures. Not only sums not expended in fact had been deliberately\nshown to be so, the attempt on the part of the prosecution to make double\nand inflated additions in respect of purchase of machineries in some items\nhas been overlooked. It has been argued as well that the Trial Court\nerroneously also relied on the evidence of prevaricating prosecution\nwitnesses against the respondents.\n\nPer contra, the prosecution has insisted that the challenge to the so\ncalled flaws in the assessment of the evidence by Trial Court on items\nother than the one pertaining to marriage expenditure is wholly misplaced\nand unmerited as the High Court had also endorsed the amounts corresponding\nthereto. This is more so in absence of any challenge to the conclusions of\nthe High court in this regard by the respondents. According to the\nprosecution, the High Court scaled down the marriage expenditure from\nRs.6,45,04,222/-, as quantified by the prosecution to Rs.28,68,000/-,\nthough the Trial Court had computed the same to be Rs.3 crores.\nArithmetically thus, the High Court endorsed the total expenditure to be\nRs.5,40,20,611/- instead of Rs.11,56,56,833.41 quoted by the prosecution.\nIt has been argued that the analysis of the evidence on record as a whole\nby the Trial Court and its computation of the marriage expenditure of Rs.3\ncrores is correct and did not call for any interference. According to the\nprosecution, the Trial Court did not reject the evidence adduced by it, but\non a rational appraisal thereof, had moderated the marriage expenditure to\nbe Rs.3 crores. It has been urged as well that the Trial Court had rightly\ndisbelieved the evidence of the defence witnesses and more particularly the\nparty workers who claimed to have collected funds to spend the same on the\nevent. That A2 had failed to account for the expenditures, referred to by\nA1 in her reply to the notice to the Income Tax Department had been\nunderlined too.\n\nThe break-up of expenditure of Rs.6,45,04,222/- on the marriage has been\nfurnished by the prosecution as hereunder.\n\nIn our comprehension, though PW181 had neither visited the venues on the\ndates of the event nor was then in-charge of the construction of pandals\nand other arrangements auxiliary thereto, his evidence is not liable to be\nexcluded as a whole. On being entrusted with the responsibility of making\nan estimate of the expenses incurred in the construction of the pandals and\nother arrangements, it is discernible from his testimony that he did\nconsult the Architect Vijay Shankar, the Art Director Thotha Theerani and\nothers, who were in fact actually involved in the said works at the\nrelevant point of time. This witness visited the venues and stated on oath\nthat the Architect Vijay Shankar had given him the drawing of the choultry\nand the measurements of the pandals on the basis of which those had been\nconstructed. He also referred to the plans and sketches provided to him\nby the Art Director, based whereupon, the fixtures and ancillary\nstructures were raised. In the report Ex.P1019 prepared by PW181, he did\nmention, inter alia, the areas of the various pandals together with the\ndecorative attachments and after accounting for the cost thereof and the\nprice of the furniture used and the amenities provided, estimated the\nexpenditure to be Rs.5,91,00,000/- towards the pandals and other\narrangements to secure the intended facilities for the couple, guests and\nother participants. True it is, that PW181 was not an eye-witness to the\nmarriage arrangements and had not personally undertaken the works\npertaining to the pandals and other associated arrangements, yet as has\nbeen observed by the Trial Court, his findings as recorded in the report\nEx. P1019 could be construed to be of an expert witness and further could\nbe used as corroboration for the testimony of PW200 who indeed had\nsupervised the same works himself and as claimed by the prosecution on the\ninstructions/advise of A2. The evidence of PW181, that the Architect\nVijayshankar and the Art Director Thotha Tharani had provided him with the\nplan and the sketch map on which the pandals and other structures at the\nvenues had been constructed, cannot be discarded as hearsay. In this view\nof the matter, the approach of the Trial Court to weigh the probative worth\nof the testimony of PW181 in conjunction with PW200 cannot be repudiated\nto be impermissible in law or outrageously fallacious.\n\nPW200 K.P. Muttuswamy, Chief Engineer, Public Works Department, Tamil Nadu\ndid assert on oath that he was instructed by A2 to complete the pandal\nworks as early as possible. He also referred to a plan to that effect\nfurnished by the Architect Vijay Shankar in presence of the contractors\nentrusted for the execution thereof. The witness claimed to have arranged\nland at the identified sites to be levelled and also provided in details of\nthe number, size and specification of the pandals together with the\npurposes thereof. The witness was candid to state that the father of the\nbride had paid Rs.14 lakhs towards the expenditure and that therefrom, he\ndisbursed payments. He deposed as well that A1 and A2 had inspected the\nwork by visiting the site about a week prior to the marriage. He claimed\nto have signed the applications for securing temporary electric connections\nfor the pandals for which payments were made by cheques on behalf of A1.\nIn this patent premise, the conclusion of the Trial Court that the evidence\nof PW200 was direct and of first hand in nature with regard to the\narrangements at the pandals cannot be faulted with. Its finding that his\ntestimony thus lent sufficient corroboration to that of PW181 also cannot\nbe dismissed as preposterous.\n\nThe testimony of DW-80, who was also a signatory to the report Ex. P-1019,\nto the effect that the same had been prepared without any inspection and\nthat the measurements mentioned therein were not real had not been rightly\npreferred to the otherwise consistent versions of PW181 and PW200. The\nevaluation of the evidence of the other witnesses touching upon the\nremaining aspects of the expenditure incurred on the marriage, as conducted\nby the Trial Court, also does not merit rejection in toto. Noticeably, the\nTrial Court did not accept the expenditure quoted by the prosecution on\nthe cost of Titan watches as the evidence to that effect was construed to\nbe inadequate to lay the same in the account of the respondents. The\nrejection of the evidence of the party workers claiming collection of\nvarious amounts from its cadres and utilization thereof towards the\npurposes and arrangements mentioned by them also in absence of any\npersuasive corroborative evidence does not merit any repudiation. In the\nface of the evidence in particular of the elaborate arrangements at the\nvenues and the expenses incurred on other items associated with the event,\nwe are of the opinion that the Trial Court did not err in not accepting the\nfigure of Rs.28,68,000/-, as the expenditure incurred by A1 on the basis of\nher reply to the queries made by the Income Tax Department. Though it has\nbeen urged on behalf of the defence that this figure had been finally\naccepted after the necessary enquiries undertaken by the income tax\nauthorities, the result of such enquiries even if made, being not\nbinding on the Trial Court, it was not obliged to accept the same by\nignoring the evidence adduced before it. The treatment of the evidence by\nthe High Court, on the other hand, in our assessment, had been summary and\nsketchy and it in a way promptly accepted the expenditure mentioned by A1\nin her reply to the notice of the income tax department without\nindependently appraising the evidence adduced by the parties at the trial.\n\nThough it is not unknown, that very often the bride's family shares or\nbears the expenditure of marriage, dependent on the practice prevalent, it\nis not an invariable phenomenon and permits of exception in varying fact\nsituations and therefore no rigid assumption either way is tenable. In any\ncase, necessary deductions would have to be drawn on the basis of the\nevidence adduced. As the investigation into the expenditure on the\nmarriage had to be conducted more than two years after the event, it is\nlogical that the exercise involved was expected to be informed with some\nassumptions, which if realistic and logical, would not as such vitiate the\nassessment as incurably infirm or non-est.\n\nOn an overall consideration of the evidence adduced by the parties, we are\ninclined to hold that the computation of the expenditure incurred by A1 in\nthe marriage as made by the High Court is unacceptable in the teeth of the\nmaterials on record to the contrary. There being concurrent findings of\nthe two forums on the rest of the items of expenditure, we construe it to\nbe inessential to undertake a fresh exercise with regard thereto in the\npresent proceedings.\n\nCONSPIRACY AND ABETEMENT\n\nThe prosecution asserts that the respondents i.e. A1 to A4 had entered\ninto a conspiracy and in furtherance thereof, A1 who was a public servant,\nhad come to possess assets to the tune of Rs.66.65 crores, disproportionate\nto her known sources of income, during the period 1991 to 1996 when she\nheld the office of the Chief Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu. The\nprosecution has alleged as well that A2 to A4 had abetted her i.e. A1 in\nthe commission of offence. To reiterate, the check period is from 1.7.1991\nto 30.4.1996. To buttress this imputation, the prosecution has relied on\nthe fact that A1, who was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 24.6.1991\nto 13.5.1996 and A2 who was her close friend and associate, were amongst\nothers partners together in Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises from\nbefore the check period. A2, who was the wife of Tr. M. Natarajan, a\ngovernment servant with the Information and Public Relations Department,\ninitially was a occasional visitor to the residence of A1 till 1988\nwhereafter she was permanently assimilated in the household. The\nprosecution case as well is that A3 who is proclaimed to be the foster\nson of A1 is the biological son of A2's elder sister Tmt. Vanamani and T.\nVivekanandan. He too had come to reside in the residence of A1 during the\nyear 1992 while pursuing studies at Chennai and remained there till 1997.\nIt is in evidence that A1 had solemnized his marriage on 7.9.1995, claiming\nhim to be her foster son with noticeable pamp and grandeur. A4, according\nto the prosecution, is the wife of the elder brother of A2 and had been\nresiding in the house of A1 from the beginning of 1992.\n\nThe above noticeable integration of A1 to A4 and their joint residence has\nbeen highlighted by the prosecution as a formindable indicator to attest\nthe imputation of conspiracy and abetment. Apart from maintaining that A2,\nA3 and A4 at the time of joining the household of A1 were not possessed of\nproperties significant enough in their names nor did have any independent\nsource of income as such, it has insisted that the properties acquired\nduring the check period in the names of the 34 firms and companies were\nwith the unaccounted funds and resources of A1. It has been underlined that\nonly few of the companies/firms which were formed with A2, A3 and A4 and\nLex Property Development (Pvt). Ltd. in different combinations were\nregistered under the Companies Act . Noticeably, the properties of these\ncompanies/firms had been acquired during the check period and significantly\nabout 50 bank accounts were opened with the Indian Bank, Abhirampuram and\nCanara Bank, Mylapore in the names of the respondents and their\nfirms/companies during that time. The prosecution has also brought on\nrecord the fact that out of these firms/companies, six firms namely; Jay\nFarm House, J. Real Estate, Jaya Contractors and Builders, Green Farm\nHouse, J.J. Leasing and Maintenance and J.S. Housing Development had been\nregistered on the same day ie. 25.1.1994 and ten other firms namely;\nVigneshwara Builders, Lakshmi Constructions, Gopal Promoters, Namasivaya\nHousing Developments, Ayyappa Property Developments, Sea Enclave,\nNavasakthi Contractors and Builders, Oceanic Constructions, Green Garden\nApartments and A.P. Advertising Services on 15.2.1995. According to the\nprosecution, all the respondents availed of the services of common\nauditors, architects and accountants. It has referred to numerous inter-\naccount transfers involving the respondents and the above firms/companies\nso much so to unequivocally project that those represented cash flow from\ntheir accounts inter se for common purposes. Referring to the evidence of\nPW198 in particular, it has been contended on behalf of the prosecution\nthat huge unaccounted cash deposits had been made in the two accounts,\nmaintained in Canara Bank, Mylapore and Indian Bank, Abhirampuram\noriginating from 36, Poes Garden, Chennai, the residence/secretariat of A1\nwith A2 monitoring the account(s) in which such deposits were to be made.\nVis-a-vis the purchase of immovable properties, it has been alleged that\nabout 3000 acres of fertile lands, of which 900 acres comprised a tea\nestate, had been acquired in the names of individuals/companies through\nvarious transactions evidenced by 146 sale deeds. It has been underlined\nthat qua most of the sales, A2 had suggested the names of the\nfirms/individuals to figure in the deals. It has been imputed as well that\nin connection with such transactions, the vendors/owners were kept away\nfrom the purchasers and and the conveyances were made through attorneys\nfoisted upon them. The vendors were also subjected to duress to part with\nthe property and the officials entrusted with the duty of registration of\nsuch transactions, were subjected to instructions from higher authorities\nto oblige the purchasers and that the registrations did take place at the\nresidence of A1 on many occasions. The consideration price of such sale\ntransactions very often had been below the guidelines prescribed and the\namounts were paid from various accounts of the respondents as well as their\nfirms/companies and also by cash. According to the prosecution, all these\ncircumstances are borne out unmistakably by the evidence on record, oral\nand documentary do prove the charge of conspiracy and abetment and that in\nfurtherance of these criminal activities, each one of them had acted on\nbehalf of each other in capacities either as individuals, partners,\ndirectors, of their firms/companies and also collaborators.\n\nIn refutation on behalf of A1, it has been broadly urged that though\nconspiracy can be inferred from circumstances, the same has to be\nessentially proved and that the mere fact that A2 to A4 had been residing\nin the house of A1, per se cannot be a decisive circumstance to prove\nconspiracy. It has been argued that from much prior to the check period,\nA1 and A2 had been partners in the firms namely; M/s Jaya Publication and\nSasi Enterprises and their business connection ipso fact also cannot be\nconstrued to be an incriminating circumstance. It has been maintained that\nA2 to A4 have purchased properties with their own resources and efforts and\nthat the prosecution has failed to establish even a single instance to\ndemonstrate that the funds for such acquisitions had been doled out by A1.\nContending that starting of a firm by a non-public servant by itself\ncannot be an irrefutable determinant to assume conspiracy with a public\nservant more particularly when A1 had never been a partner in any of the\nfirms started during the check period, it has been pleaded that the finding\nof the Trial Court that the evidence available did prove issuance of\ncheques by A1 in favour of the co-accused and the applications by her for\navailing loan for the firms involved is factually incorrect. It has been\nargued that the prosecution has failed to cite even one instance where A1\nhad transferred any fund to A3 and A4 and for that matter to any of the six\ncompanies in particular which allegedly have acquired properties therewith.\nIt has been underlined as well that A1 had neither received any dividend\nfrom these companies nor been either a shareholder or a director thereof.\nIn this context, the finding of the Trial Court that A2 to A4 had acquired\ndefunct companies with a sinister motive has been dismissed as unfounded\nand patently erroneous. It has been maintained that a circumstance to admit\nany inference of an illegal act must be one incapable of any other\nreasonable explanation and the prosecution having failed to offer any, by\nfurnishing either direct or indirect evidence, the charge of conspiracy\nhas remained unproved.\n\nElaborating further the refutation of the imputation that the six\ncompanies namely; Meadow Agro Farms Pvt. Limited, Riverway Agro Products\nLimited, Lex Property Development (Pvt.) Limited, Signora Business\nEnterprises, Ramraj Agro Products Limited and Indo Doha Chemical and\nPharmaceutical Pvt. Limited had no resources of their own and that with\nthe induction of A2, A3 and A4 in particular, a tide of funds had flowed\ninto their accounts generated from the coffers of A1, it has been urged\nwith reference to the testimony of DW86 Vaidyanathan and DW87 Srikant as\nwell as the income tax returns for the period ending 31.3.1996 and 1996-97\nas well as the balance sheets of the companies that so far as Meadow Agro\nFarm Pvt. Limited, and Riverway Agro Products Limited are concerned, at the\nrelevant time, the respondents were not the shareholders thereof and their\nshare capital was formed of the contribution of the shareholders of these\nentities. According to the respondents, all these companies had sufficient\nfunds of their own where from acquisition of properties and expenditures\nwere made. That huge amount of loans were also advanced by these companies,\nto name in particular, Meadow Agro Farms Pvt. Limited, Riverway Agro\nProducts Limited and Lex Property Development (Pvt.) Limited have been\nhighlighted. The loans, noticeable were more prominently to A2, A3 and the\nfirms/companies formed by them in different combinations including Sasi\nEnterprises and Jaya Publications. The amount of loans range from Rs.2\nlakhs to Rs.62,52,000/-. Vis-a-vis Lex Property Development (Pvt.) Limited,\nit has been contended that from its balance sheet for the assessment year\n1996-97, it was patent that it had received share application money to the\ntune of Rs.46,00,000 and that it had borrowed a sum of Rs.84,07,172 from\nthe Indian Bank. Further, it had a receipt of Rs.2,04,98,350 from sundry\ncreditors. In addition to the above, it has been pleaded that the company\nalso received an inter-corporate deposit (ICD) from Kalyani Constructions\nPvt. Ltd. of an amount of Rs. 1,56,67,000 during the year ending\n31.3.1996 and Rs. 45,00,000 from Altaf Constructions Private Ltd. That this\ncompany did make an investment of Rs.2,63,49,857/- in immovable property\napart from granting loans to A3 and three other firms including Sasi\nEnterprises, has been mentioned. According to the respondents, thus the\ntotal expenditure of this company including advances did sum up to\nRs.3,03,48,357/- which was met from its own corpus, as had been accepted\nby the income tax authorities.\n\nIt has been insisted in particular that the properties acquired by Signora\nBusiness Enterprises Private Limited were prior to A3 and A4 becoming the\nadditional directors of the company and therefore the finding to the\ncontrary as recorded by the Trial Court was apparently erroneous.\n\nWith regard to Ram Raj Agro Products Limited, it has been argued that the\nbalance sheet of the company for the year 1994-95 disclosed that it had\nmade investment of Rs.14,39,446/- in the purchase of land. Referring to\nthe balance-sheet of this company for the assessment year 1995-96, it has\nbeen maintained that it had secured loans from banks to the tune of\nRs.1,43,87,336 and unsecured loans of Rs.75,30,561. It has been urged as\nwell that during the said period, this company had received a sum of\nRs.1 crore also from Mangutta Investment Pvt. Limited. That the company\nhad received back from the government a refund of Rs.40,00,000 has also\nbeen urged to contend that it thus had funds to the tune of Rs.2,59,17,897\nwherefrom it spent Rs.62,57,000 towards constructions at Thanjavour during\n1994-95 and 1995-96.\n\nVis-a-vis, Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Pvt. Limited, it has\nbeen asserted that on 31.3.1995, it had paid up share capital of\nRs.97,00,000/- as disclosed by its balance-sheet. Referring to the order\npassed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) in ITA No. 144/1999-\n2000, it is submitted that 9,69,400 shares of face value of Rs.10 each\nhad been purchased by A2 at Rs.6 per share and the remaining 600 shares had\nbeen purchased by six other persons. That the price of the 9,69,400 shares\n@ Rs.6 per share amounting to Rs.58,16,400/- and registered in the name of\nA2 had been paid by A3 is however admitted. Contending thus that the\nprosecution version that Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Pvt.\nLimited during the check period had a total income of Rs.30,40,000 to be\nwrong, it has been urged that after the purchase of the shares, the whole\nfactory was leased out to Southern Petrochemical Company Limited (SPIC), in\nreturn whereof the company received an amount of Rs.1,39,08,584/-. It has\nhowever been admitted that out of such receipt, Rs.25,00,000/- had been\nlent to Meadow Agro Farm (Private) Limited. Further, an amount of\nRs.20,00,000/- had been paid to James Frederic and Rs.72,00,000/- to\nS IPC OT by way of repayment of loan availed earlier leaving a balance of\nRs.57,08,584/- in deposit. This is to contradict the prosecution's claim\nthat the income of Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Private Limited\nduring the check period was Rs.30,40,000/-. It has thus been urged that all\nthe properties acquired and constructions raised by the six companies\nhave been from their own funds and therefore, the amount of\nRs.4,70,24,439/- towards the same is not liable to be integrated while\nadjudging the assets of A1 to A4.\n\nIn consolidation of the above, it has been urged on behalf of A2 to A4\nthat they along with the six companies whose assets, income and expenditure\nhave been combined by the prosecution to lay the charge, being not public\nservants, cannot, in law, be called upon to explain their source of income\nor the manner of acquisition of their assets or the mode and extent of\ntheir expenditures.\n\nReferring to Section 13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act, it has been asserted that\nthe same does not cast any obligation on a non-public servant even if\narraigned as a co-accused with the public servant, to furnish explanation\nas otherwise contemplated therein. It has been maintained that though the\nclear mandate of this legal provision is that for the charge to succeed,\nthe prosecution must establish that the public servant, had been during the\nterm of his/her office holding his/her assets through some other person or\nto put it differently, some other person had been holding the assets on\nbehalf of the public servant, the Trial Court had grossly erred in absence\nof any evidence to that effect, to proceed on the basis of surmises and\nconjectures to return a finding against A2 to A4 and the above referred\nsix companies. The prosecution having utterly failed to adduce any\nevidence to demonstrate that A2 to A4 or these companies had received any\nmoney from A1, her financial involvement in their affairs remained\nunproved, more particularly as she was neither a director nor a shareholder\nof these companies. Underlining the fact that no charge of benami\ntransaction had been framed against the respondents, it has been insisted\nthat even otherwise the prosecution has failed to discharge its burden to\nprove this fact. It has been argued that it having been established that A2\nto A4 and the six companies at all relevant times, had their independent\nsources of income and individual business, the 1988 Act did not cast any\nburden on them to prove that they did not hold any assets on behalf of A1.\nElaborating on this aspect, it has been contended that from much before\nthe commencement of the check period, A2 had been carrying on business in\nher own right as the proprietor of Vinod Vision and she had been filing her\nincome tax returns in connection therewith. Reference of the income tax\nreturns and wealth tax returns of A2 for the assessment years 1985-86 to\n1992-93 have been referred to. All these returns as the dates thereof\nwould indicate had been submitted much belatedly and noticeably on same\ndates i.e. 23.2.1993 and 25.2.1993 for income tax and wealth tax returns\nrespectively. No explanation for such delayed submission of returns had\nbeen furnished.\n\nThough A2 had been a partner in Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises\nwhich did exist as well from before the check period, it has been pleaded\nthat the Trial Court completely disregarded the evidence with regard to her\nincome and assets of these firms as disclosed more particularly in the\nincome tax returns and accepted by the income tax authorities, in holding\nthat the transactions involved were really of A1 catalysed by her\nfinances. Similarly the income tax returns of A3, A4 and the six companies\nhad also been left out of consideration by the Trial Court.\n\nReiterating that there is no evidence on record even to indicate that A1\nhad been the director or a shareholder of any of the six companies, it has\nbeen emphasized that these companies had been floated prior to the check\nperiod. Apart form contending that there is no evidence to suggest that A1\nhad either given loan to the six companies or had made any investment\ntherein, it has been urged as well that these companies not having been\narraigned as accused, their income and assets could not have been\nattributed to any of the respondents, being impermissible in law. In a\nway, thus it has been argued that the assimilation of the assets of these\ncompanies with those of the respondents and the eventual confiscation\nthereof amounts to condemning these entities unheard. The prosecution as\nwell has been severely criticized to be unfair in withholding the audit\nreport prepared by Mr. Chokkalingam in respect of Jaya Publications and\nNamadhu MGR. That several other documents seized in course of the\ninvestigation were also endeavoured to be withheld and that it was on the\nintervention of this Court that the respondents could secure an opportunity\nto traverse the same, has also been mentioned. In reiteration of their\nplea made with regard to the deficiencies in the assessment of the\nvaluation of the construction made by the engineers deputed by the\nprosecution, it has been insisted that they could by no means be accepted\nas experts, the appraisals and the reports based thereon being wholly\nincomplete, faulty and conjectural in absence of any contemporaneous\ndocument in support thereof. The approach of the Trial Court in accepting\nthe valuation furnished by the prosecution through such witnesses by\nallowing a discount of 20% has also been castigated as absurd and perverse.\nAccording to the respondents, the Trial Court readily accepted the evidence\nof the prosecution on many issues without analysing the same in the\ncorrect perspective which patently exhibits its non application of mind.\n\nAside impeaching the failure of the Trial Court in omitting to lay before\nthe A2, all the incriminating circumstances under Section 313 Cr.P.C., its\nacceptance of the charge of conspiracy and abetment on the consideration\nof the joint residence of A1 to A4, execution of general power of attorney\nby A1 in favour of A2, constitution of various firms and companies during\nthe check period and inference of cash flow from one account to another\nhas been branded as visibly flawed. It has been argued on behalf of the\nrespondents that the deed of power of attorney was executed by A 1 in\nfavour of A2 only for the purpose of bank transactions of Indian Bank and\nnot for all purposes as assumed by the Trial Court. Further, as A1 was\nneither a partner in any of the firms/companies constituted during the\ncheck period and as the six companies, the properties whereof had been\nconfiscated, had been incorporated prior to the check period with third\nparty promoters/directors, this factor also did not merit acceptance to\nreinforce the charge of conspiracy.\n\nIt has been assiduously pleaded that having regard to the fact that A1 is\na spinster and that she and A2 were partners in M/s Jaya Publications and\nM/s Sasi Enterprises from before the check period and thus did share a\nclose relationship, A2's accommodation with A1 per se cannot suggest\nconspiracy as alleged. Similarly, A3 being the nephew of A2 and A4, the\nwidowed sister-in-law of A2, their residence with A1 also ipso facto was\nnot an unmistakable circumstance to deduce conspiracy, in absence of any\nevidence direct or indirect or a single instance evidencing flow of cash or\nfinance either from any source of A1 or her account to that of the other\naccused persons or the six companies. Such a factor was really non est but\npresumed and acted upon by the Trial Court to infer conspiracy and\nabetment. It has been emphatically contended that the Trial Court ignored\nas well the fact that M/s Jaya Publications and M/s Sasi Enterprises along\nwith A2 to A4 and six companies had secured substantial amounts of loan\nfrom banks and other private sources which they rolled in their respective\nbusiness to assume their inter dependence and sustenance through\ncirculation of unaccounted reserves of A1 in their accounts.\n\nOn the aspects of abetment and conspiracy, the High Court dwelt upon the\nevidence in general without undertaking any minute analysis of the\ntestimony of the individual witnesses or the documents/ transactions\nrelated thereto. It in particular, while dealing with the charge of\naccumulation of unaccounted wealth by A1 and diversion thereof to A2 to A4\nto acquire immovable properties and administer the firms/companies\ninvolved, noted that the respondents along with the firms and companies had\nborrowed loans of Rs.24,17,31,274/- from banks. The High Court therefore\nconcluded that this amount having been utilised for the purchase of\nimmovable properties and administration of the firms and companies\ninvolved, there was no foundation for the charge of abetment. Qua the\nimputation of conspiracy, the High Court ruled that the joint residence of\nA2 to A4 did not warrant an inference thereof and though as this offence\ncontemplates an agreement between two or more persons to commit an unlawful\nact, a court to be satisfied with regard thereto ought to have at its\ndisposal prima facie evidence. It observed that where evidence is only\ncircumstantial, it must be complete, continuous and unimpeachable to be\nconsistent with the guilt of the accused so much so to exclude any possible\nhypothesis of his innocence. The High Court concluded that the evidence\ndisclosed that A2 to A4 had borrowed huge amounts from the banks and other\nsources and had therefrom acquired the immovable properties and the six\ncompanies. It thus ruled, that not only the source of income was lawful,\nthe object was also legal. The charges of abetment and conspiracy against\nthe respondents have thus been dismissed by the High Court on these\nconsiderations.\n\nThe Trial Court, while examining these charges, did address at the outset\nthe imputation of the prosecution that the pecuniary resources and the\nproperties of A2 to A4 as well as the six afore-named companies were\nreally held for and on behalf of A1, thus attracting the offence under Section 13(1)(e) of the Act. The Trial Court recounted in this context,\nthe plea of A2 to A4 that the cash deposits in their accounts and their\nassets had been acquired out of their own funds and that A1 had no\nassociation therewith or contribution therefor in any manner whatsoever.\nThis, is in the face of the accusation of the prosecution that the\nfinancial resources as well as the assets of A2 to A4 and the six companies\nwere in fact those of A1, as A2 to A4 and the said companies did not have,\nat all relevant times, any income, or wherewithal to acquire the same. The\nTrial Court was thus alive to the assertion of the prosecution that the\npecuniary resources and the properties of A2 to A4 and of the six companies\nas endeavoured to have been acquired from their funds were held in benami\nfor and on behalf of A1. It proceeded to analyse the evidence adduced by\nthe prosecution on the touchstone of the accepted legal formulation that\nbenami transactions admitted of direct or circumstantial evidence leading\nto such inference and embarked on the process of scrutinizing the facts and\ncircumstances attendant on the various transactions pertaining to\nacquisition of properties of the six companies of which A2 to A4, in\ndifferent combinations, were the directors, as well as the cash flow inter\nse in their bank accounts.\n\nAs the narration outlined by the Trial Court would reveal, it dealt with\nin minutest details the oral and documentary evidence available on record.\nWithout resorting to a dialectical appraisal of the evidence of the\nindividual witnesses and the documents brought on record, it would be\nsuffice in our comprehension to notice the salient features discernible\ntherefrom and strikingly common to the transactions.\n\nThe evidence on record demonstrates that these companies though were in\nexistence from before the commencement of the check period and of which A3\nand A4 were not the directors then, did neither have any significant\nbusiness activity nor transaction nor any profit earning pursuit to their\ncredit. This the Trial Court rightly noticed was apparent from the\nrelevant returns and balance sheets. The contemporaneous evidence also\nevinced that these companies were not possessed of sufficient resources to\nacquire properties to the extent amassed during the check period. Neither\ndid these companies have fixed assets nor did they avail or give loans to\nevince financial soundness or stability permitting acquisition of the\nassets and properties as made during the check period. In all, in these\nsix companies, A3 and A4 were nominated as additional directors/directors\nin the year 1994 and soon thereafter their registered office stood\nshifted to Shop No. 21, First Floor, Wellington Plaza No. 19, Annasalai,\nMadras. The original directors resigned leaving the reins of the companies\nwholly with A3 and A4 in particular. Noticeably, soon after A3 and A4 were\ninducted as additional directors/directors, bank accounts were opened.\nSimultaneously A2 to A4 formed several partnership firms with the principal\nplace of business thereof also at the above address. Co-incidentally the\ndates of registration of most of these firms were common in batches and\nthe duration of their existence were mentioned to be at will.\nSignificantly, A3 and A4 resigned from the above six companies markedly on\nthe eve of the expiry of the check period.\n\nThe Trial Court, in details, took notice of the testimony of the witnesses\nexamined as well as the documents on the aspect of acquisition of\nproperties by these six companies. The witnesses included erstwhile\ndirectors of these companies, bank officials who stated about the opening\nof their accounts as well as advancement of loans, the concerned sub-\nregistrars, who registered the sale deeds of lands purchased by these\ncompanies, officials from the office of the Company Registrar and Mr.\nShiva, Real Estate Agent, who acted as the agent/attorney of the vendors,\nwhose lands were purchased by these companies. The materials examined by\nthe Trial Court evidenced heavy deposits/withdrawals of cash and transfers\nthereof hitherto absent before A3, A4 had taken over the companies. The\namounts varied very often in the range of Rs.10 lakhs and above. The pay-\nin-slips for the deposits amongst others showed address of 36 Poes Garden,\nChennai. Transfers of heavy amounts to and from other accounts of A2 to A4\nand their firms also surfaced. The income-tax returns/balance sheets\nbelatedly filed also demonstrated exchanges of deposits inter se the\naccounts of A2 to A4 and their firms as well as these companies.\n\nIn respect of the acquisition of the immovable properties, the evidence\nattested that soon after A3 and A4 had become directors of these companies,\nthey got involved in the negotiations and survey of lands intended to be\npurchased. The sales were got executed through the attorneys of the owners\nof the lands for which deeds of power of attorney were obtained from such\nowners. Not only uneven bargains but also inadequate consideration/price\nby undervaluing the properties was noticeable in the transactions.\nEvidence on record disclosed that instructions were issued from the higher\nauthorities to the Registrars/Sub-Registrars to respond to the directions\nissued from the office of A1 for documentation and registration of the\ndeeds involving such purchases and as a matter of fact, on various\noccasions, such precepts did come and were readily complied with. Several\nregistrations were executed in the house of the vendors and at times, also\nin the concerned office of the Registrar/Sub-Registrar. The sale deeds\nexecuted, which are not disputed so far as those relate to these companies,\ndid not indicate that the purchases had been made from their assets\nexisting prior thereto. The evidence of the witnesses did suggest as well\nthat the registration norms were flexed and that resultant irregularities\nin the process were ignored and cast aside to oblige the respondents.\nEvidence of direct involvement of A3 and A4 in the purchase of shares and\nproperties on behalf of Ramraj Agro Mills (Private) Limited and that of A3\nin the purchase of property for Meadow Agro Farms (Private) Limited is\ndiscernible from the evidence adduced. In some cases, A2 was also present\nat the time of negotiations for such purchases. The active role of Mr.\nShiva, the attorney of the owners, is apparent on the face of the records.\n\nThe Trial Court also noticed the evidence that the companies had been\ntransferred to A3 and A4 at paltry sums. On a totality of the scrutiny of\nthe evidence on record which significantly is adequately exhaustive, the\nTrial Court held that at the relevant time of acquisition of the\nproperties, as above, all the six companies were exclusively in the control\nand management of A2 to A4. The statement of the erstwhile\ndirectors/promoters of the companies that they did not purchase any\nproperty in their names either before or after the formation of such\ncompanies was also taken note of. The Trial Court noted as well that A2 to\nA4 had taken over the management of the companies even without buying the\nrequisite shares and concluded that these entities in fact did not have\nthe trappings of a company. It was determined as well that none of these\ncompanies had any account in their names before A3 and A4 had taken over\nthe charge thereof and that there was no evidence to demonstrate that the\nfunds of these companies had been utilised to purchase properties in their\nnames. It recorded as well, that the funds were transferred to the\naccounts of these companies either from the accounts held in the names of\nNamadhu MGR, M/s Jaya Publications or other firms of the respondents which\nunassailably proved that the resources for the acquisition of the\nproperties of these companies had in fact been availed from A1 or the\naccounts maintained in the joint accounts of A1 and A2. That admittedly\nnone of the companies had filed returns either before the Registrar of the\nCompanies or before the income tax authorities declaring the funds for the\npurchase of properties or acquisitions made in the names of the companies\nwas noted. The Trial Court also recorded the non-compliance of the various\nprovisions namely, i.e. Sections 209 , 210 , 211 , 215 and 220 of the\nCompanies Act in particular to conclude that as required by these\nprovisions, no proper books of accounts had been maintained, no returns had\nbeen filed by these companies from the date of incorporation till the date\nof attachment of their properties pursuant to the notifications issued by\nthe Government of Tamil Nadu under the provisions of Section 3 of the\nCriminal Law Amendment Ordinance 1944 as per GOMS No. 120 dated 29.1.1997\nand GOMS No. 1183 dated 25.9.1997. That the balance sheet and profit and\nloss account of the companies were not maintained and processed as mandated\nby Sections 213 and 220 of the Companies Act was also underlined. It was of\nthe view as well that there was nothing on record to show that A2 to A4 had\nconvened any general meeting of the companies during the relevant time or\nthat regular returns were filed before the Registrar as required under the\nlaw. It also noted that the companies did not have their own auditors\nappointed under Section 234 of the Companies Act and that the auditors of\nA1 to A4 themselves submitted the returns after the properties of the\ncompanies were attached. The Trial Court thus deduced that all the\ncircumstances conjointly substantiated that the acquisition of these\ncompanies were never intended to be the assets thereof and were also not\ntreated to be their properties at any point of time. According to the\nTrial Court, it was only after the attachment of the properties that the\nrespondents raised the contention that the ownership thereof did vest in\nthe companies and thus could not be said to have been held benami for A1.\nThe Trial Court also, with reference to the certified copies of the\norders in Misc. Petition No. 768/2014 dated 18.6.2014 and Misc. Petition\n289/2014 dated 26.6.2004 passed under Section 5(3) of the Criminal Law\nAmendment Ordinance recorded that after the resignation of A3 and A4, there\nwas no appointment of directors and that seemingly for that reason, the\norder of attachment passed in 1997 was not assailed for nearly two years.\nIt thus rejected on a comprehensive analysis of the evidence on record, the\ncontention of the respondents that the properties acquired in the name of\nthe companies did belong to these entities and could not have been\nassimilated in the assets of A1.\n\nQua 'the respondents’ plea that the companies incorporated under the Companies Act cannot hold property benami for another person, it entered a\nfinding that none of the documents of title registered in the names of the\ncompanies did bear the seal thereof. That in 90% of the registered deeds,\nthe companies were not represented by their secretary or director and that\nthe address of the companies were not recorded in such deeds, was noted.\nThe Trial Court concluded that the registrar who registered these\nproperties and PW 181 who negotiated with the purchasers, distorted the\nrules to help A1 and they went out of his way to oblige her. That in some\nof the deeds, the names of the purchasers were not included and that the\nproperties were undervalued was reiterated. The admission of the District\nRegistrar that he proceeded with the registration solely because the\nproperties were purchased by A1 was taken cognizance of. It was thus of\nthe view that the intention of the respondents in taking over the\ncompanies was for acquiring large number of properties in their names for\ndiverting the funds unlawfully amassed by A1 during her tenure as Chief\nMinister of the State. It thus concluded that the properties registered\nin the names of these companies and which formed the subject matter of GOMs\nNo. 1183 dated 25.9.1997 and GOMs No. 120 dated 12.1.1997 issued by the\nState of Tamil Nadu were really the properties acquired and held by A2 to\nA4 for and on behalf of A1.\n\nThe evidence on record thus propel several conspicuous and singular\nfeatures as noted comprehensively by the Trial Court. Apart from the fact\nthat the properties aforementioned had been acquired during the check\nperiod, the general phenomenon decipherable is that the acquisitions had\nbeen made in the names of the newly formed or acquired firms/companies with\ntheir directorial composition, as noticed hereinabove and the two existing\nfirms i.e. M.s. Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises of which A1 and A2\nwere partners.\n\nEvidently about 50 banks accounts were opened with the Indian Bank,\nAbhaypuram and Carana Bank, Mylapore in the names of accused persons and\nthe firms/companies as has been stated by PW182 and PW201, details of\nwhich are as under:\n\nThe Trial Court noted that at the commencement of the check period, there\nwere hardly 10 to 12 bank accounts standing in the names of A1 and A2 but\nthereafter 50 accounts mushroomed during the check period as deposed by PWs\n182, 201, 207,209 and 239. The particulars of the bank accounts, the names\nof the banks, the dates of opening thereof, and the corresponding exhibits\nalong with the names of the account holders were marked in details.\n\nReferring to the evidence of PW-201 in particular, the remittances inter\nse the accounts of A1 to A4 and their firms also were set out which\nwould demonstrate that the exchanges during the check period were not\nonly noticeably frequent and numerous but also did sum up to figures\nfluctuating from Rs.12000/- to Rs.25,00,000/- as would be evident from\nthe particulars of such transfers involving the accounts of A1, A2, A3, A4,\nNamadhu MGR, Fax Universal, Anjaneya Printers, Green Farm House and Meadow\nAgro Farm.\n\nOral evidence in the form of testimony of M. Jayaraman (PW-198), Mani,\nRam Vijayan & Balakrishnan and the documents adduced by the prosecution\nthrough the witnesses prove that an amount of Rs.13,55,28,685.50 in all,\nhad been deposited by cash through pay-in-slips in the current accounts of\nA2 to A4 and the firms by these witnesses and others. These deposits\nsignificantly had been made during the check period and apart from heavy\namounts on every occasion, varying from above Rs.50,000/- to\nRs.33,70,000/-, there is a noticeable frequency thereof in close proximity\nwith each other. The pay-in-slips proved in support of such cash deposits\nand exhibited by the witnesses concerned even disclose deposits of various\namounts in different accounts on the very same date. As many as 184\ndeposits between 17.9.1992 and 8.3.1996 have been made in current account\nNo. 1952 of Namadhu MGR. As many as 267 deposits have been made by Ram\nVijayan himself only, totalling Rs.8,96,52,623.30 out of the total amount\nof Rs.13,55,28,685/- indicated hereinabove, apart from M. Jayaraman (PW-\n\n198), Mani, Ram Vijayan & Balakrishnan through whom deposits had been\nmade. A2 and A3 as well have through pay-in-slips made such deposits of a\nsum of Rs.28,74,000/-. The noteworthy feature of these deposits is that\nthe same had not been in the account of A1. Not only the cash deposits of\nsuch a huge amount is out of the ordinary, the mode thereof i.e. by pay-in-\nslips through a selected few and the frequency thereof render an\noverwhelming phenomenon, highly redolent and admitting of a logical and\npersuasive inference of laundering of gigantic unaccounted cash. The\nabsence of deposits in the account of A1 in the multitude of such\noperations admits of reasonable and unimpeachable conclusion that the\nwealth in circulation had its origin in her coffers. On a rational analysis\nof such mammoth inflow of cash in the accounts of A2 to A4 and the\nfirms/companies involved during the check period, the conclusion of the\nTrial Court that these resources were at all relevant times held by A2 to\nA4 and their firms/companies on behalf of A1 in order to veil her otherwise\nunexplained disproportionate assets is unassailable.\n\nThe Trial Court next probed into the credit entries of the relevant bank\naccounts of the respondents to seek the trail of the fund flow and thus\nexamined the deposits of cash into their bank accounts and also in those of\nthe firms/companies floated by them spanning from Rs.10,000/- to\nRs.33,70,000/. On an audit of the current and saving bank accounts of\nthe respondents and the firms involved, the Trial Court identified\nunexplained cash credits of huge sums therein varying from Rs.2684.90 to\nRs.1,26,00,000/- involving the respondents, Namadhu MGR, Sasi Enterprises,\nVinod Video Vision, Jaya Publications, J. Farm House, Maha Subalaxmi\nKalayana Mandapam, Anjaneya Printers Private Limited, Fresh Mushroom, Metal\nKing, Super Duper T.V. Private Limited, Lex Property Development Pvt.Ltd.,\nRiverway Agro Production Private Limited, Fax Universal, Meadow Agro Farm\nPvt. Limited, Namay Shivaya Housing Development, Vigneshwara Builders,\nLaxmi Constructions, Sea Enclave, Ayyappa Property Development Private\nLimited, Ocean Construction, Gopal Promoters, Green Garden Apartments,\nShakti Constructions, J. S. Housing Development, Ramraj Agro Mills Private\nLimited. Noticeably except Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises, A2 to\nA4 and Lex Property Development Private Limited were the partners of the\nother firms named above.\n\nIn this context, the Trial Court inter alia referred to the decision of\nthis Court in Kale Khan Mohammad Hanif Vs. C.I.T. , (1963) 50 ITR 1 (SC),\nwherein it was expounded that the onus was on the assessee to explain the\nnature and source of cash credits as to whether those stood in the\nassessee's account or in the account of a third party and that the assessee\nhad a legal obligation to explain the nature and source of such credit by\nproving prima facie the transaction(s) that had yielded such accruals in\nhis books of account.\n\nThe Trial Court held the view that the respondents in the case in hand had\nfailed to offer any satisfactory explanation with regard to the enormous\nunexplained credit/accumulations in their bank accounts. It rejected the\nconfirmatory letter offered by the respondents as false and bogus and\nfurther held that the identity of the person who disclosed the source, had\nalso not been proved. Further the transactions which generated such cash\ncredits were also not established. It rejected as well the balance sheet\nand the profit and loss statement claimed to have been filed before the\nincome tax authorities and on which the respondents primarily relied as\ntheir defence, as not proved in accordance with law besides being not in\nconformity with the statutory prescriptions. It discarded as well the\nevidence of the auditors examined by the respondents who, as the evidence\non record testified, were not conversant with the true facts and had not\nhandled their accounts during the check period. The Trial Court returned\nthe finding that the evidence on record cumulatively substantiated that the\nreturns, the balance sheet and the profit and loss accounts were framed\nand fashioned to offer an explanation to the otherwise titanic unexplained\ncredits in their respective bank accounts. The Trial Court thus held that\nthe respondents had failed to prove their defence, when tested on the\nevidence adduced even by the standard of preponderance of probability.\n\nWhile observing that mere declaration of property in the income tax\nreturns does not ipso facto connote that the same had been acquired from\nthe known lawful sources of income, the Trial Court held the view that the\nprosecution could successfully establish that the respondents and their\nfirms/companies, who posed to be income tax assessees, had no independent\nor real source of income and that it was the finance of A1 that was\nreally in circulation and thus it could prove beyond reasonable doubt that\nthe only source of money the acquisition of large assets was that of\nhers.\n\nThe evidence of PW198 M. Jayaraman, a member of staff with A1 in her house\nat Poes Garden, at the relevant point of time, admitting remittances into\nvarious bank accounts through Mr. Vijayan on the instructions of A2 was\nreferred to in particular. That this witness had stated that A2 used to\ninstruct him about the details of the bank to which the deposit ought to\nbe credited and that the amounts used to be dispatched in suit cases and\nbags through domestic servants was taken note of. The Trial Court took\ninto consideration his testimony that he used to fill the challans as\ndirected by A2 which he identified in the course of his examination. He\nidentified too, the signatures of Mr. Vijayan on the challans. The Trial\nCourt also took note of the evidence of PW 182 and PW 201, the bank\nofficers who identified/proved large numbers of pay-in-slips and also\naffirmed that those bore the name of Mr. Vijayan as the person remitting\nthe amounts mentioned. These witnesses had stated further, as noted by\nthe Trial Court, that the pay orders and the demand drafts issued by them\nfor the purpose of acquisition of the assets as involved were at the\ninstance of the respondents. That these demand drafts or the pay orders\ncould be directly related to the cheques or pay orders mentioned in the\nvarious sales deeds was recorded as well. This too, as held by the Trial\nCourt, did establish the nexus of the funds of A1 with the investments made\nfor the acquisition of such assets. The Trial Court thus sustained the\ncharge levelled by the prosecution that all the assets and pecuniary\nresources found to be possessed by A2 to A4 and in the names of various\nfirms/companies actually belonged to A1 and thus she in fact possessed\nthe assets and pecuniary resources of the total value of Rs.55,02,48,215\nin her name and in the names of A2 to A4 and of the firms/companies, thus\nestablishing the ingredients of the offence under Section 13(1)(e) of the\nP. C. Act. It held the view that A2 to A4 as the evidence substantiated\nhad conspired with A1 and had actively abetted in collaboration with each\nother with the sole object of acquiring and holding properties and assets\ndisproportionate to the known sources of income of A1.\n\nThis according to the Trial Court stood corroborated by the large\nnumber of accounts opened in the names of the respondents or of\nfirms/companies and the disbursements to these accounts only by the staff\nof A1 on the instructions of A2 who was in-charge of her financial affairs.\nThe Trial Court also took cognizance of the fact that the evidence on\nrecord established that except Super Duper T.V. Private Limited, neither\nthe respondents nor their firms did credit any amount to the various\naccounts standing in their names. Rather, all these firms had gained\ndeposits transferred to their accounts either from that of Namadhu MGR or\nJaya Publications. Reiterating the rejection of the plea of the\nrespondents, that large deposits collected from various subscribers of\nNamadhu MGR totalling Rs.15 crores had been credited in the accounts of\nNamadhu MGR and Jaya Publications, the Trial Court reaffirmed that these\ndeposits in fact represented the un-explained wealth accumulated by A1.\n\nThe Trial Court in the ultimate analysis summed up the circumstances\ngleaned from the evidence on record to conclusively hold that the\nprosecution could prove beyond reasonable doubt, the charges levelled\nagainst the respondents as framed. While enumerating finally the facets\nsubstantiating this determination, the Trial Court took note of the fact\nthat A1 had executed a general power of attorney (Ex. P-995) in favour of\nA2 in respect of Jaya Publications as A1, at all relevant time, was the\npartner of the said firm. That such a power of attorney was otherwise not\nnecessary and that this authority was thus endowed on A2 so as to lend her\na free hand in the management of Jaya Publications so as to facilitate the\ndefence of A1 that she used to be a dormant partner and was unaware of the\ntransactions carried on by A2 was recorded. The Trial Court however held\nthe view that by the execution of such power of attorney, in law, A1\nrendered herself liable for all acts and deeds of A2 pursuant to the powers\nso conferred. It correlated the flow of funds accumulated by A1 to the\naccount of Jaya Publications and thereafter to branch out the same to other\naccounts to be eventually appropriated for the acquisition of huge assets.\nThe Trial Court thus rejected the stand of A1 that she was unaware of the\nactivities of A2, her agent with regard to the transfer of the funds and\nthe mode of utilization thereof.\n\nThe constitution of various firms during the check period was cited as\nwell to be another circumstance to prove the conspiracy amongst the\nrespondents. The Trial Court re-counted that at the commencement of the\ncheck period, A1 and A2 were involved in the two concerns namely M/s Jaya\nPublication and M/s Sasi Enterprises but during the check period as many as\n18/21 firms did come into existence. The Trial Court reiterated that the\nevidence on record however proved that none of these firms either carried\non business during the check period or contributed any share capital to or\nreceive any profit from these firms. The fact that in a single day, ten of\nsuch firms have been constituted with identical features was reiterated.\nThe Trial Court did recall as well that not only A2 and A3 did start\nindependent concerns in their names, even defunct companies were\npurchased/taken over by the respondents. However, none of these firms or\ncompanies did actually carry on any business except acquiring huge\nproperties. Referring to the fact that at the time of opening of the bank\naccounts of these firms/companies, none of these entities had any\nindependent resources, the Trial Court deduced that these firms/companies\nwere nothing but extensions of Namadhu MGR and Jaya Publications and owed\ntheir existence to the benevolence of A1 and A2 for continued sustenance.\nIt reiterated that the proved fact that large amount of funds were diverted\nto these accounts was a clear attestation of the fact that these firms were\nconstituted to only siphon off the unlawful resources amassed by A1. The\nfact that these firms/companies did operate from the residence of A1 belied\nthe feigned ignorance of A1 about their activities, was noted. The joint\nresidence of all the accused persons also could not be ignored as a factor\ncontributing to the charge of conspiracy and abetment when assessed\ntogether with the attendant facts and circumstances reinforcing the said\nimputations. This also belied, according to the Trial Court, the specious\nplea of A2 to A4 that each one of them had independent business and own\nsource of income. The fact that A2 to A4 did combine to constitute the\nfirms to acquire huge tracts of land out of the funds provided by A1 also\nwas a clear index that their assemblage in the house of A1 was not\nengendered by any philanthropic urge for friends and their relations in\nneed, rather to frame and further the criminal conspiracy to hold the\nassets of A1. The fact that the materials on record did evince that A1 had\nnot only advanced Rs.1 crore to Shasi Enterprises as a contribution to its\nshare capital for which she availed loan, but also that she did issue\nseveral cheques in favour of other accused persons and filed application\nfor availing loan for the benefit of the firms involved, did buttress the\ncharge that she was wholly aware of the dealings of the co-accused and the\nfirms in their minutest details. The free flow of money from one account\nto the other of the respondents, the firms/companies also proved beyond\nreasonable doubt that all the accused persons had actively participated in\nthe conspiracy to launder the ill-gotten wealth of A1 for purchasing\nproperties in their names. The fact that the assets and properties of the\nsix companies were attached pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Law\nAmendment Ordinance and that the applications for vacating the attachments\nwere not filed for more than two years therefrom did make it apparent that\nno other person except the accused were interested therein. The Trial\nCourt rightly did mark as well, referring in particular to the evidence of\nPW159 Sub-Registrar, North Beach, Sub Registrar’s Office and PW71 Radha\nKrishnan, Horticulture Officer that they were called to Poes Garden and on\nthe instructions of higher officers, they did oblige A1 even by relaxing\nthe rules in the registration of large number of documents by taking\npersonal interest and even overlooking that the properties were undervalued\nto hold a deep seated involvement of A1 in these transactions. That the\nregistering authorities had gone to the extent of permitting registration\nof six documents even without incorporating the names of the purchasers,\nwas referred to. The Trial Court in its conclusion, on an exhaustive\nanalysis of the evidence as a whole, held the following facts to have been\nproved by the prosecution beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\nIn view of this, the Trial Court convicted A1 for the offences under Section 13(1)(e) r/w Section 13(2) of the PC Act. Further A1 to A4 were\nconvicted under Section 120-B IPC r/w Section 13(1)(e) r/w Section 13(2) of\nthe PC Act as well. A2 to A4 were additionally convicted under Sections\n109 IPC r/w 13(1)(e) r/w 13(2) of the PC Act and sentenced them\naccordingly as heretobefore mentioned.\n\nThe Trial Court further ordered that necessary directions be issued to the\nconcerned banks to remit the proceeds of the fixed deposits and the cash\nbalance standing to the credit of the respective accused persons in their\nbank accounts to be appropriated and adjusted towards the fine amounts.\nIt was directed as well that if even after such adjustment, the amount fell\nshort of the quantum of fine, the gold and diamond ornaments, seized and\nproduced before the court (after setting apart 7040 gms. of gold with\nproportionate diamond jewellery) be sold to RBI or SBI or by public auction\nso as to meet the deficit. The rest of the gold and diamond jewellery was\ndirected to be confiscated to the Government.\n\nIt further ordered that all immovable properties registered in the names\nof Lex Property Developments Pvt. Ltd., Meadow Agro Firms Pvt. Ltd., Rama\nRaj Agro Mills (P) Ltd., Signora Business Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., Riverway\nAgro Production (P) Ltd. and Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Ltd.\nwhich were under attachment pursuant to GO Nos. MS 120 and 1183, above\nreferred to be confiscated to the State Government. It ordered as well\nthat out of the fine amount recovered, a sum of Rs.5 crores be made over\nto the State of Karnataka towards reimbursement of expenses for the trial\nconducted thereat.\n\nAs many as 34 companies/firms fell for scrutiny in the course of\nadjudication. Out of these Jaya Publications, Sasi Enterprises, Signora\nBusiness Enterprises Private Limited, Lex Property Development Pvt.\nLimited, Riverway Agro Production Private Limited, Meadow Agro Firm Pvt.\nLimited, Indo Doha Chemical and Pharmaceutical Limited, Ram Raj Agro Mills\nLimited did exist from before the check period. The others were\nregistered during the check period and notably, the date of registration of\nsix of these had been 25.1.1994 and three bank accounts of five of them\nhad been opened on the same date i.e. 27.1.1994. Further ten of such firms\nhad been registered on 15.2.1995 and their bank accounts had been opened\non 23.3.1995. To say the least, in the context of the charge levelled,\nthis co-incidence also is conspicuously abnormal and irreconcilable.\nAnother note worthy feature is that in most of these firms, A2, A3 and A4\nare the partners with Lex Property Development Pvt. Limited, joining them\nin some. There are firms as well where either A2 or A3 is the proprietor\nand others are with the combination of A2, A3 and A4. As the evidence\nwith regard to the affairs of the six firms in whose names large tracts of\nproperties had been purchased and deposits made, has been dilated upon\nhereto before, the same does not warrant further elaboration.\n\nThe unimpeded, frequent and spontaneous inflow of funds from the account\nof A1 to those of the other co-accused and the firms/companies involved,\noverwhelmingly demonstrate the collective culpable involvement of the\nrespondents in the transactions in the face of their overall orientations\nso as to render the same to be masked banking exchanges though involving\nseveral accounts but mostly of the same bank. No other view is possible.\n\nApart from the above, the demurral of unfairness in investigation and\ntrial also cannot be sustained in the overall factual conspectus. True\nthat in course of the investigation, some documents had been seized which\nwere not adduced in evidence being construed to be irrelevant for\nsubstantiating the charge, but it did not certainly tantamount to\nsuppression thereof so as to afflict the trial with the vice of unfairness\nand non-transparency as alleged. Additionally, the courts did intervene as\npermissible in law wherever merited to ensure against any prejudice qua the\nparties. The fact that the documents seized but not brought on evidence\nby the prosecution had not been destroyed and were available to the\nrespondents for their inspection, at all relevant times, is, per se, an\nindex of fair and impartial trial. The defence as a matter of record did\nat some point of time close its side of evidence by examining only two\nwitnesses, whereafter following the inspection of the documents, as desired\nby the respondents, after A1 had returned to power, examined as many as 99\nwitnesses. Prior thereto, 76 prosecution witnesses were permitted to be\nrecalled for further cross-examination. The remonstrance that the Trial\nCourt did not take into consideration the defence evidence is also not\nborne out by the records. As would be evident from its judgment, the\ntestimony of several witnesses examined by the respondents received in-\ndepth appreciation by the Trial Court wherever relevant. The contention\nthat the Trial Court had conducted the trial in a manner prejudicial to the\nrespondents in the overall context, both factual and legal, thus cannot be\nsustained.\n\nThat the Trial Court was meticulous, sensitive, vigilant and judicious in\nappraisal, stands authenticated by the fact that in valuing the assets, as\nwarranted, it excluded a sum of Rs.32 lakhs towards the price of sarees\nand further reduced the value of gold and diamond to the extent of Rs.2\ncrores. It also allowed reduction in the marriage expenses by more than 50%\nand further discounted the value of constructions by permitting a\ndepreciation of 20%.\n\nApropos the off repeated grievance, of the defence that the Trial Court\nhad left out of consideration material pieces of evidence adduced by it,\nsuffice it to state that the decision rendered by it proclaim to the\ncontrary. In all the aspects amongst others income, expenditure and\nassets, the judgment of the Trial Court reveals on a plain reading that\nthe evidence adduced by the defence as construed to be relevant had not\nonly been taken note of but also analysed and applied for arriving at\nthe conclusions on the issues pertaining to the adjudication. Whereas\nqua income, reference of the testimony of the defence witnesses is\ndecipherable amongst others pertaining to the scrutiny involving\nNamadhu MGR, Super Duper T.V., gifts offered to A1, rental income and\nincome tax returns, the Trial Court did also assess the defence evidence\nwhile judging the case on the issues of marriage of A3, expenditure and\nas well as valuation of buildings. The cavil to the contrary thus cannot\nbe entertained. Further this plea though elaborated in details in course\nof the arguments in the present proceedings was not taken very\nspecifically before the High Court by the respondents while challenging\ntheir conviction. Significantly, such a grievance has also not been made\nby them by laying a formal challenge to such purported omissions on the\npart of the Trial Court, before this Court, as contemplated in law. In\nthis persuasive backdrop, we are thus disinclined to sustain this\ncontention. This is more so as in view of the appraisal of the relevant\nevidence as a whole, we are of the unhesitant opinion that the impugned\njudgment and order of the High Court suffers from manifest errors on the\nface of the record, both on facts and in law and is liable to be set-aside.\n\nThe Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944 (referred to as the “Ordinance”\nas well), which was enforced w.e.f. 23.8.1944 is an yield of the exercise\nof powers under Section 72 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and is\ndirected to prevent the disposal or concealment of property procured by\nmeans of the offences enlisted in the Schedule thereto. To iterate, for\nthe instant adjudication, paragraphs 4A and 5 of the Schedule are extracted\nhereinbelow for immediate reference:\n\nClause 3 of the Ordinance provides that where the State Government or as\nthe case may be, the Central Government has reason to believe that any\nperson has committed, whether after the commencement of the Ordinance or\nnot, any scheduled offence and whether or not any court has taken\ncognizance thereof, it may authorise the making of an application to the\nDistrict Judge within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, the said\nperson ordinarily resides or carries on business, for attachment of any\nmoney or other property, believed to have been procured by means of such\noffence. It also permits that if such money or property cannot for any\nreason be attached, the prayer in the application may be extended to\nother property of the said person of the value as nearly as may be\nequivalent thereto. The provisions did make applicable Order XXVII of\nthe First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 to the proceedings\nfor an order of attachment under the Ordinance as they did apply to the\nsuits by the Government.\n\nSection 4 contemplates ad interim attachment by the jurisdictional\nDistrict Judge, in the eventualities as mentioned therein and while doing\nso, he is required to issue to the person whose money or other property was\nbeing attached, a notice accompanied by copies of the order, the\napplication and affidavits and of the evidence, if recorded, asking him to\nshow cause on a date to be specified in the notice as to why the order of\nattachment should not be made absolute. Clause 5 empowers the District\nJudge to make the ad interim order of attachment absolute, if either no\nobjection is filed by the person affected or not varied after necessary\nenquiry on a consideration of the objection if filed, and the evidence is\nadduced. In terms of clause 10 of the Ordinance, an order of attachment\nof property made shall unless it is withdrawn, continue to be in force, in\na contingency where a court has taken cognizance of the alleged schedule\noffence whether, before or after the time when the order was applied for,\nuntil orders are passed by the District Judge in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Ordinance after the termination of the criminal\nproceedings. Clause 11 provides for appeals against the order(s) of the\nDistrict Judge, in the matter of attachment before the jurisdictional High\nCourt. Whereas clause 12 makes it incumbent on the court trying a\nscheduled offence, when apprised of an order of attachment of the property\ninvolved under the Ordinance, to record a finding, in case of conviction,\nas to the amount of money or value of other property procured by the\naccused by means of the offence, Clause 13 mandates the manner of disposal\nof such attached property upon termination of the criminal proceedings.\nThereunder, when the final judgment or order of the criminal court is one\nof conviction, the District Judge shall order that from the property of\nthe convicted person attached under the Ordinance or out of the security\ngiven in lieu of such attachment, there shall be forfeited to Government\nsuch amount or value as is found in the final judgment or order of the\ncriminal court, to have been procured by the convicted person, by means of\nthe offence together with the costs of attachment as determined by the\nDistrict Judge. Sub-clause 4 deals with a situation where the amounts\nordered to be forfeited or recovered exceed the value of the property of\nthe convicted person attached, thus permitting in that eventuality, the\nsteps to follow. Sub-clause (6) ordains that every sum ordered to be\nforfeited in connection with any scheduled offence other than one\nspecified in item 1 of the schedule, would after deduction of the cost of\nattachment as determined by the District Judge, be credited to the\nGovernment or the local authority to which the offence has caused loss or\nwhere there is more than one such government or local authority, to be\ndistributed amongst them in the proportion to the loss sustained by each.\n\nNoticeably “termination of criminal proceedings”, as per clause 2(2), as\nrelevant for our present purpose, would be where this Court would pass its\nfinal order in the present appeals.\n\nIn the appeals, filed by the State of Karnataka pertaining to the release\nof the properties recorded in the name of the six companies involved,\nconsequent upon the acquittal of the respondents, the parties are\nessentially at issue on the applicability or otherwise of Section 452 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 invoked by the Trial Court to order\nconfiscation/forfeiture of the properties otherwise attached under the\nOrdinance. The other facets of the competing assertions being largely\ncommon and already addressed, are inessential for a fresh scrutiny.\n\nWhereas it is urged on behalf of the State that having regard to the\nscheme of the Act and the mode of attachment of the property involved in a\nscheduled offence, the operation of Section 452 of the Code is not\nexcluded, the plea on behalf of the respondents is that the Ordinance being\na complete code by itself, the Trial Court was patently wrong in\nassuming to itself the power of disposal of the property under attachment\nby invoking the said provision of the Code. It has been urged in essence\non behalf of the respondents that at the most, the Trial Court could have\nvalued the property under attachment following its conclusion of guilt\nagainst them, leaving it thereafter to the forum under the Ordinance to\ncomply with the procedure prescribed therein and further the process to its\nlogical end. This is more so, as has been urged for the respondents, that\nthe appeals against the orders making the ad interim attachment absolute\nare pending before the High Court as permissible under the Ordinance.\nPrincipally, reliance, amongst others has been placed by the respondents\non the decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in State of West\nBengal Vs. S.K. Ghosh , AIR 1963 SC 255.\n\nIn our comprehension, the course adopted by the Trial Court cannot be\nfaulted with. To reiterate, in terms of Section 5(6) of the Act, it was\nauthorised to exercise all powers and functions exercisable by a District\nJudge under the Ordinance. The offences at the trial were under Sections\n13(1)(e) , 13(2) of the Act, Sections 109 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code\nencompassed within paragraphs 4A and 5 of the Schedule to the Ordinance.\nThese offences were unimpeachably within the contours of the Act and\ntriable by a special Judge thereunder. Having regard to the frame and\ncontent of the Act and the limited modifications to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure , in their applicability as occasioned thereby\nand the authorisation of the special Judge trying the offences thereunder\nto exercise all the powers and functions invocable by a District Judge\nunder the Ordinance, we are of the opinion that the order of\nconfiscation/forfeiture of the properties standing in the name of six\ncompanies, as involved, made by the Trial Court is unexceptionable. In any\nview of the matter, with the peremptory termination of the criminal\nproceedings resultant on this pronouncement, the direction of the Trial\nCourt towards confiscation/forfeiture of the attached property, as\nmentioned therein, is hereby restored and would be construed to be an order\nby this court as well. The decisions cited on behalf of the respondents\non this issue, are distinguishable on facts and are of no avail to them.\n\nIn Mirza Iqbal Hussain through Askari Begum Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh,\n(1982) 3 SCC 516, two fixed deposit receipts and the cash amount of\nRs.5200/- seized from the house of the appellant and proved to be the\nsubject-matter of charge under Section 5(1)(e) of the 1947 ACt, were\nordered to be confiscated to the State. Responding to the plea of want\nof jurisdiction of the Special Court to order confiscation, this Court\nreferring to Section 4(2) of Cr.P.C., held that in terms thereof, all\noffences under any law other than the Indian Penal Code have to be\ninvestigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to\nthe provisions contained in the Code but subject to any enactment for the\ntime being in force regulating the manner or place of investigation,\nenquiry, trial or otherwise dealing with such offences. It was observed\nthat none of the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act provided\nfor confiscation or prescribed the mode by which an order of confiscation\ncould be passed and thus, it was ruled that the order of confiscation in\nthe facts of the case could not be held to be de hors jurisdiction. The\ninvocation of Section 452 of the Code, in absence of any provision in the Prevention of Corruption Act , excluding its operations to effect\nconfiscation of the property involved in any offence thereunder, was thus\naffirmed.\n\nAfter analyzing the facts and circumstances of this case and after taking\ninto consideration all the evidence placed before us and the arguments put\nforward by all the parties, we are of the unhesitant opinion that the\nimpugned judgment and order rendered by the High Court is untenable and is\nthus set aside. We have considered the facts of this case and in our\nopinion, the percentage of disproportionate assets as 8.12% as computed by\nthe High Court is based on completely wrong reading of the evidence on\nrecord compounded by incorrect arithmetical calculations, as referred to\nherinabove. In view of the regnant evidence on record, unassailably proving\nthe disproportionateness of the assets, as contemplated in Section 13(1)(e) of 1988 Act, it is inessential as well to resort to any arithmetic to\ncompute the percentage thereof. In any view of this matter, the decision of\nthis Court in Krishnanand Agnihotri (supra) has no application in the facts\nof this case and therefore, the respondents cannot avail any benefit\ntherefrom.\n\nBoth the Courts have construed all the assets, income and expenditure of\nall the accused collectively. We see no convincing reason to adopt a\ndifferent course which even otherwise, having regard to the charge, is not\nwarranted.\n\nNoticeably, the respondents accused accepted all the findings of the High\nCourt. We have analyzed the evidence adduced by the parties and we come to\nthe conclusion that A1 to A4 have entered into a conspiracy and in\nfurtherance of the same, A1 who was a public servant at the relevant time\nhad come into possession of assets disproportionate to the known sources of\nher income during the check period and had got the same dispersed in the\nnames of A2 to A4 and the firms & companies involved to hold these on her\nbehalf with a masked front. Furthermore, the the charge of abetment laid\nagainst A2 to A4 in the commission of the offence by A1 also stands proved.\n\nWe have noticed that:\n\nFurthermore, the reasoning given by the Trial Court in respect of criminal\nconspiracy and abetment, after scrutinizing the evidence of this case, is\ncorrect in the face of the overwhelming evidence indicating the\ncircumstances of active abetment and conspiracy by A2 to A4 in the\ncommission of the above offences under Section 13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act.\nThis would be evident from the following circumstances:-\n\naggrandizement by the unscrupulous, taking unfair advantage of their power\nand authority and those in public office also, in breach of the\ninstitutional norms, mostly backed by minatory loyalists. Both the corrupt\nand the corrupter are indictable and answerable to the society and the\ncountry as a whole. This is more particularly in re the peoples’\nrepresentatives in public life committed by the oath of the office to\ndedicate oneself to the unqualified welfare of the laity, by faithfully and\nconscientiously discharging their duties attached thereto in accordance\nwith the Constitution, free from fear or favour or affection or ill-will.\nA self-serving conduct in defiance of such solemn undertaking in\ninfringement of the community’s confidence reposed in them is therefore a\nbetrayal of the promise of allegiance to the Constitution and a condemnable\nsacrilege. Not only such a character is an anathema to the preambulor\npromise of justice, liberty, equality, fraternal dignity, unity and\nintegrity of the country, which expectantly ought to animate the life and\nspirit of every citizen of this country, but also is an unpardonable\nonslaught on the constitutional religion that forms the bedrock of our\ndemocratic polity.\n\n6. This pernicious menace stemming from moral debasement of the\nculpables, apart from destroying the sinews of the nation’s structural and\nmoral set-up, forges an unfair advantage of the dishonest over the\nprincipled, widening as well the divide between the haves and have nots.\nNot only this has a demoralising bearing on those who are ethical, honest,\nupright and enterprising, it is visibly antithetical to the quintessential\nspirit of the fundamental duty of every citizen to strive towards\nexcellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity to raise\nthe nation to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. This virulent\naffliction triggers an imbalance in the society’s existential stratas and\nstalls constructive progress in the overall well-being of the nation,\nbesides disrupting its dynamics of fiscal governance. It encourages\ndefiance of the rule of law and the propensities for easy materialistic\nharvests, whereby the society’s soul stands defiled, devalued and\ndenigrated.\n\n7. Such is the militant dominance of this sprawling evil, that\nmajority of the sensible, rational and discreet constituents of the society\nimbued with moral values and groomed with disciplinal ethos find themselves\nin minority, besides estranged and resigned by practical compulsions and\nare left dejected and disillusioned. A collective, committed and\ncourageous turnaround is thus the present day imperative to free the civil\norder from the suffocative throttle of this deadly affliction.\n\n8. Every citizen has to be a partner in this sacrosanct mission,\nif we aspire for a stable, just and ideal social order as envisioned by our\nforefathers and fondly cherished by the numerous self-effacing crusaders of\na free and independent Bharat, pledging their countless sacrifices and\nselfless commitments for such cause.\n\n............................................J.\n(AMITAVA ROY)\n\nNEW DELHI;\n\nFEBRUARY 14, 2017\n\n-----------------------\n\n|PROPERTIES ACQUIRED BY ACCUSED NO.2 PRIOR TO CHECK PERIOD NOT |\n|TAKEN |\n|INTO ACCOUNT BY DVAC |\n|S|Description of property |Value |Exhibits and |\n|.| | |Evidence relied by|\n|N| | | |\n|o| | |Accused |\n|.| | | |\n|1|As per Balance Sheet for the |4,35,622|DW 88 (Vol No.92, |\n| |Assessment year 1991- 1992 ending | |Page 105-176) |\n| |on 31.3.1991 the Cash Balance | |Ex-D-287 |\n| |Available with Accused No.2 | |(VolNo.157, Page |\n| | | |1-5) |\n| | |\n| | |\n|The properties value of A2, Jaya | |\n|Publication, Sasi Enterprises in Annexure — | |\n|I, According to DVAC was | |\n|Cash balance available on hand as on | |\n|1.7.1991 and the advances paid lying pending| |\n|adjustment as on 1.7.1991 As per Ex.P-2191 | |\n|the amount available as on 31.3.1991 by A2 | |\n|is Rs.4,35,622/- which was not taken into | |\n|Account by DVAC | |\n|Hence the balance available on hand as on | |\n|1.7.1991 has to be treated as a | |\n|Source/Income available to A2 during check | |\n|period and considered in Annexure III | |\n| | |\n|Hence the Assets value of A2 prior to check | |\n|period should be taken into Account as | |\n| | |\n| |Rs. 59,29,168.00 |\n| | |\n| |Rs. 4,35,622.60 |\n| | |\n| | |\n| |Rs.4,35,622.60 |\n| | |\n| |Rs.63,64,790.60 |\n| | |\n\nGrand Total 37,55,10,354",
