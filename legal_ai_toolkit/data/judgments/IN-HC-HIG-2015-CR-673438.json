Respondents.\n\nCoram\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan, Judge.\n\nWhether approved for reporting?1No\nFor the Petitioners : Mr.Dheeraj K.Vashisht, Advocate.\n\nFor the Respondents : Mr.Virender Kumar Verma,\nMs.Meenakshi Sharma, Mr.Rupinder\nSingh, Additional Advocate Generals\n\nand Ms.Parul Negi, Deputy Advocate\nGeneral, for respondent No.1.\n\nMr. Devender K.Sharma, Advocate,\nfor respondents No.2 and 3.\n\nTarlok Singh Chauhan, Judge (Oral).\n\nThis petition under\nSection 482\nof the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure has been moved by the petitioners for quashing of FIR\n\nNo.51/13 dated 06.06.2013, registered at Police Station, Gagret, District\n\nUna, under\nSections 341\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, IPC and\n\nproceedings pending before the learned Judicial Magistrate, Court No.II,\n\nAmb, District Una.\n\n2. The facts in brief are that on 06.06.2013 Ravi Kumar Sharda\n\nson of Shri Ram Parkash lodged an FIR No.51/13 against the petitioners at\n\nPolice Station, Gagret, Tehsil Amb, District Una, under Sections\n\nWhether the reporters of the local papers may be allowed to see the Judgment?Yes\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:17:24 :::HCHP\n147,148,149, 205, 323, 341, 427, 506\nIPC\nand further the police forwarded\n\nthe challan to Court and the case is pending before Judicial Magistrate Ist\n\n.\n\nClass, Court No.II, Amb, District Una,H.P.\n\n3. Similarly, petitioners filed a complaint against respondents\n\nNo.2, 3 and others upon which FIR No.107/13 dated 06.08.2013 under\n\nSections 323\n,\n,\nIPC at Police Station, Gagret, District Una, was\n\nlodged and thereafter police forwarded the challan to Court and the case\n\ntitled 'State Versus Ravi Kumar and others' is pending before the Court of\n\nJudicial Magistrate Ist Class, Court No.II, Amb, District Una.\n\n4. It is stated in the compromise deeds that the parties are\n\ninhabitants of District Una and used to live in same area. Further it is\n\nstated that the parties have amicably settled the matter and now they do\n\nnot want to purse the cases against each other. The compromise deeds\n\nAnnexure P-3 and P-4 are placed on record to this effect.\n\n5. Today, the petitioner s and respondents No.2 and 3 are\n\npresent in the Court and identified as such by their respective counsels. It\n\nis stated by learned counsel for the parties that the parties have amicably\n\nsettled the matter and now they do not want to purse their cases against\n\neach others in order to have cordial relations between them. They have\n\nalso placed on record the compromise deed.\n\n6. The moot question is whether the Court in such like cases can\n\nquash the proceedings. The law on this subject has been summed up in a\n\nrecent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Narinder Singh & Ors.\n\nV. State of Punjab & Anr. JT 2014 (4) SC 573, wherein it was held as\n\nunder:\n\n\"(I) Power conferred under\nSection 482\nof the Code is to be\ndistinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound the\noffences under\nSection 320\nof the Code. No doubt, under\nSection 482\n\nof the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the criminal\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:17:24 :::HCHP\nproceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable, where\nthe parties have settled the matter between themselves. However,\n\n.\n\nthis power is t to be exercised sparingly and with caution.\n\n(II) When the parties have reached the settlement and on that\nbasis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the\nguiding factor in such cases would be to secure:\n\n(i) ends of justice, or\n\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.\n\nWhile exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on\n\neither of the aforesaid two objectives.\n\n(III) Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions which\ninvolve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences\nlike murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature\n\nand have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for offences alleged\n\nto have been committed under special statute like the\nPrevention of\nCorruption Act\nor the of offences committed by Public Servants while\nworking in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of\n\ncompromise between the victim and the offender.\n(IV) On the other, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and\npre--dominantly civil character, particularly those arising out of\n\ncommercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or\nfamily disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved\n\ntheir entire disputes among themselves.\n\n(V) While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as\n\nto whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to\nhim by not quashing the criminal cases.\n\n(VI) Offences under\nSection 307\nIPC would fall in the category of\nheinous and serious offences and therefore is to be generally treated\nas crime against the society and not against the individual alone.\nHowever, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because\nthere is a mention of\nSection 307\nIPC in the FIR or the charge is\nframed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to\nexamine as to whether incorporation of\nSection 307\nIPC is there for\nthe sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence,\nwhich if proved, would lead to proving the charge under\nSection 307\n\nIPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the\nnature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the\nvital/delegate parts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. Medical\nreport in respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the\nguiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High\nCourt can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:17:24 :::HCHP\nconviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the\nformer case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the\n\n.\n\ncriminal proceedings whereas in the later case it would be\n\npermissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding the\noffence based on complete settlement between the parties. At this\nstage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the settlement\n\nbetween the parties is going to result in harmony between them which\nmay improve their future relationship.\n\n(VII) While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section\n\n482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a crucial role.\nThose cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the\nalleged commission of offence and the matter is still under\ninvestigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the\n\nsettlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is\n\nbecause of the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on\nand even the charge sheet has not been filed. Likewise, those cases\nwhere the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the\n\nevidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court can show\nbenevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie\nassessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the\n\nother hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or\nafter the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at the stage of\n\nargument, normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its\npower under Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court\n\nwould be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to\ncome a conclusion as to whether the offence under\nSection 307\nIPC\nis committed or not. Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is\nalready recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the appellate\nstage before the High Court, mere compromise between the parties\nwould not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the\noffender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here\ncharge is proved under\nSection 307\nIPC and conviction is already\nrecorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of\nsparing a convict found guilty of such a crime.\"\n\n7. It would be seen that prior to Narinder Singh's case (supra),\n\na three Hon'ble Judges Bench had considered the relevant scope of\n\nSections 482\nand\nCr.P.C. in\nGian Singh versus State of Punjab and\n\nanother\n(2012) 10 SCC 303 wherein it was held that power of the High\n\nCourt in quashing of the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:17:24 :::HCHP\nexercise of its inherent power is distinct and different from the power of a\n\nCriminal Court for compounding offences under\nSection 320\nCr.P.C. While\n\n.\n\nexercising inherent power of quashment under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C., the\n\nCourt must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime and its\n\nsocial impact. It warned the Courts, the High Court for quashing\n\nproceedings in heinous and serious offences of mental depravity, murder,\n\nrape, dacoity etc. which principles have been reported and reaffirmed in\n\nNarinder Singh\n's case (supra).\n\n8. Now the further question remains whether this Court can\n\nquash proceedings where the petitioner s, on the one hand, have been\n\ncharged under\nSections 341\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, IPC, while\n\non the other hand, respondents No.2, 3 and others have been charged\n\nunder\nSections 323\n,\n,\nIPC. This question need not detain this Court\n\nany longer in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nDimpey Gujral, W/o\nVivek Gujral and others versus Union Territory\n\nthrough Administrator, UT, Chandigarh and others (2013) 11 SCC 497\n\nwhere the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case seeking quashment of FIR\n\nand its consequential proceedings involving\nSections 147\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nIPC after relying upon the judgment of Gian Singh's\n\ncase (supra) held as follows:-\n\n\"7. In certain decisions of this court in view of the settlement arrived at\nby the parties, this court quashed the FIRs though some of the\noffences were non-compoundable. A two Judges' Bench of this court\ndoubted the correctness of those decisions. Learned Judges felt that\nin those decisions, this court had permitted compounding of non-\ncompoundable offences. The said issue was, therefore, referred to a\nlarger bench.\n\nThe larger Bench in\nGian Singh v. State of Punjab\n(2012) 10 SCC\n303 considered the relevant provisions of the Code and the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:17:24 :::HCHP\njudgments of this court and concluded as under: (SCC pp.342-43,\npara 61)\n\n.\n\n\"61. The position that emerges from the above discussion can\nbe summarised thus: the power of the High Court in quashing\na criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its\n\ninherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\ngiven to a criminal court for compounding the offences under\nSection 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude\nwith no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\n\nwith the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure\nthe ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of\nany Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal\nr proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the\n\noffender and victim have settled their dispute would depend\non the facts and circumstances of each case and no category\ncan be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power,\nthe High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity\n\nof the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental\ndepravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be\n\nfittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's family and\nthe offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not\n\nprivate in nature and have serious impact on society.\nSimilarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in\nrelation to the offences under special statutes like\nPrevention\n\nof Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by public servants\nwhile working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis\nfor quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But\nthe criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-\ndominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the\npurposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from\ncommercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like\ntransactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating\nto dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is\nbasically private or personal in nature and the parties have\nresolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the\nHigh Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,\nbecause of the compromise between the offender and victim,\nthe possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal case would put accused to great\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be\ncaused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full\nand complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:17:24 :::HCHP\nother words, the High Court must consider whether it would be\nunfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the\n\n.\n\ncriminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding\n\nwould tantamount to abuse of process of law despite\nsettlement and compromise between the victim and\nwrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is\n\nappropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the\nanswer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High\nCourt shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal\n\nproceeding.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n8. In the light of the above observations of this court in Gian Singh,\n\nwe feel that this is a case where the continuation of criminal\nproceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of law because\nthe alleged offences are not heinous offences showing extreme\ndepravity nor are they against the society. They are offences of a\n\npersonal nature and burying them would bring about peace and amity\nbetween the two sides. In the circumstances of the case, FIR No.163\ndated 26/10/2006 registered under\nSection 147\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the IPC at Police Station Sector 3,Chandigarh and all\n\nconsequential proceedings arising there from including the final report\npresented under Section 173 of the Code and charges framed by the\ntrial court are hereby quashed.\"\n\n9. On the basis of the aforesaid exposition of law, this Court is of\n\nthe opinion that this is a case where the continuation of the criminal\n\nproceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of law because the\n\nalleged offences are not heinous offences showing extreme depravity nor\n\nare they strictly against the society. They are offences of personal nature\n\nand quashing the proceedings would bring about peace and amity\n\nbetween two sides.\n\n10. In these circumstances, FIR No.51/13 dated 06.06.2013,\n\nregistered at Police Station, Gagret, District Una, under\nSections 341\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, IPC at the instance of respondents No.2 and\n\n3 herein against the petitioners and proceedings pending before the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:17:24 :::HCHP\nlearned Judicial Magistrate, Court No.II, Amb, District Una, against the\n\npetitioners, are quashed.
