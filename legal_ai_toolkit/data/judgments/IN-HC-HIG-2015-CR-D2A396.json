By way of present Appeal, the appellant State challenge the\n\njudgment and order dated 24.6.2005 passed by the learned\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge and Fast Track Court No.6, Vadodara, in\n\nSessions Case No.13 of 2005, whereby the learned Sessions Judge\n\nhas convicted the respondents - accused persons for offences\n\nPage 1 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\npunishable under Section 498(A) read with\nSection 114\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo one year simple\n\nimprisonment and to pay fine amount of Rs.200/-, in default of\n\npayment of fine, further simple imprisonment of one month. The\n\nlearned Sessions Judge was pleased to convict the accused No.1\n\nfor the offence punishable under\nSection 323\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode, but no separate sentence was imposed upon him. Learned\n\nSessions Judge was pleased to give benefit of probation under\n\nSection 4\n,\n,\nof Probation of Offenders Act as well as\nSection 360\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure to the respondent No.2 and\n\nthereby suspended sentence for the offence punishable under\n\nSections 498(A) read with\nSection 114\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge was also pleased to acquit the accused\n\nNo.2 for the offence punishable under\nSection 504\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code and he was also pleased to acquit the accused Nos.1\n\nand 2 for the offence punishable under Sections 306 read with\n\nSection 114\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. Short facts of the case of the prosecution are such that the\n\ncomplainant Kamlaben, wife of the accused - respondent No.1 filed\n\ncomplaint before \"C\" Division Police Station at Vadodara against\n\nthe respondents for the offences punishable under\nSections 323\n,\n,\n498(A)\n,\nand\nof the Indian Penal Code. It is the case of\n\nthe prosecution that the complainant belonged to Marathi\n\nPage 2 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ncommunity and prior to 11 years from the date of incident, she\n\nwas married with the accused accused - respondent No.1 by way\n\nof love marriage. During her wedlock period, the complainant gave\n\nbirth two children i.e. son and daughter. The complainant and her\n\nmother-in-law were residing separately in the same premise. As\n\nper the case of the prosecution, on 23.10.2004, the respondents -\n\naccused were suspecting about the character of the complainant\n\nand she was beaten by the respondent No.1 and the respondent\n\nNo.2 gave filthy abuses to the complainant. The respondent No.2\n\nhad thrown away the the household materials and threatened the\n\ncomplainant to give divorce. As per the case of the prosecution,\n\nthe respondent No.1 was present at that relevant point of time, as\n\nhe was sleeping in the house. Thus, the accused persons with\n\nabetment of each other caused physical and mental torture to the\n\ncomplainant and therefore, the complainant by pouring kerosene\n\non her and setting her at fire and thereby committed suicide and\n\nduring the course of medical treatment, she died. Thereafter, said\n\naccused were also arrested. The statements of witnesses were\n\nrecorded and thereafter, charge-sheet was filed against the\n\naccused before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class,\n\nVadodara, who in turn committed the case to the Court of Sessions\n\nas the same was exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions. The\n\naccused pleaded not guilty for the charge and claimed to be tried.\n\nPage 3 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nThe main defence of the accused was that they were falsely\n\nimplicated in alleged offence.\n\n2.1 To prove the case against the accused, the prosecution\n\nexamined following witnesses :\n\nSr. Name of the witnesses Exhibit\nNo.\nP.W.1 Yogesh Bipinchandra Srivastava, Panch 10\n\nP.W.2 Pravinbhai Madhavbhai Parmar, Panch 12\n\nP.W.3 Miyamohmmad Ismailhai Lambawala, Panch 14\n\nP.W.4 Mustaq Gulamrasul Mansuri, Panch 16\n\nP.W.5 Dr. Vaishakhi Yashvantrai Shukla 17\n\nP.W.6 Rajubhai Laxmanrav Godse, witness 21\n\nP.W.7 Savitaben Lalmanrav, witness 22\n\nP.W.8 Narayanrav Babulal Agarwal, witness 23\n\nP.W.9 Mayuriben Shivprasad Babulal, witness 24\n\nP.W.10 Kalidas Chhotabhai Mali, witness 25\n\nP.W.11 Madhuben Vijaybhai, witness 26\n\nP.W.12 Hirabhai Ramsingbhai Rathva, A.S.I. 27\nP.W.13 Gurupritsinh Surendrasinh Swyan, P.S.I. 33\n\nP.W.14 Karamsinh Arjanbhai Desai, ACP 41\n\nP.W.15 Rohitkumar Saburbhai Variya, Ex.

After hearing at length and on perusal of the evidence\n\non record, the learned Sessions Judge observed that the\n\nprosecution has proved the case against the accused beyond\n\nreasonable doubt and therefore, learned Sessions Judge passed\n\nthe judgment and order as stated hereinabove.\n\n3. Heard learned APP Mrs. Punani appearing for the appellant -\n\nState and learned advocates Mr. Buddhbhatti along with Ms.\n\nPage 5 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nKrishna Mishra for the respondents.\n\n4. Learned APP submitted that present appeal is preferred by\n\nthe State against aforesaid impugned judgment and order and\n\nspecifically, the acquittal for the offences punishable under Section\n\n306 read with\nSection 114\nof the Indian Penal Code. She further\n\nsubmitted that here in this case, dying declaration of the deceased\n\nwas recorded by authorized person i.e. Executive Magistrate and\n\nthe complaint was given by the deceased herself, even though, the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge has not considered the said material\n\naspects i.e. complaint and dying declaration, while passing\n\nimpugned judgment and order. She read the complaint at Exhibit\n\n42 and submitted that said complaint was lodged by the deceased\n\nherself after the incident, on 25.10.2004, wherein she stated that\n\nthe respondents accused meted out cruelty upon her by keeping\n\nsuspicion over her character. The deceased also stated that the\n\nappellant No.1 beaten her with the wooden piece used for washing\n\nthe cloths. The respondent No.2 had thrown the household\n\nmaterials of the complainant outside the home and told the\n\ndeceased to give divorce. The complaint also reveals that the\n\nrespondents accused were harassing the deceased and therefore,\n\nthe deceased decided to commit suicide. Therefore, the deceased\n\npoured kerosene on her own and set her at fire. Learned APP\n\nPage 6 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ntherefore, submitted that the respondents accused were\n\nsuspecting about her character and they had also beaten her.\n\nTherefore, it can be said that the respondents accused were\n\nharassing and beating her and therefore, the deceased died by\n\ncommitting suicide. She read the evidence of P.W.6 Rajubhai\n\nGodse, P.W. 7 Savitaben, P.W. 8 Narayan Agarwal, P.W.9\n\nMayuriben, P.W.10 Kalidas Mali and P.W.11 Madhuben and\n\nsubmitted that all these witnesses in their respective evidence\n\nstated that due to stove burst, the deceased died, but, later on, all\n\nthese witnesses turned hostile. But, from the statement before the\n\npolice, these witnesses did not state about said accident. Learned\n\nAPP further submitted that looking to the panchnama, the stove\n\nwas found as it was and it was not burst and even it was empty i.e.\n\nwithout kerosene. She further submitted that looking to the\n\nevidence of Dr. Vaishakhi, it appears that the burning of deceased\n\nwas from first degree to third degree and looking to the P.M. note,\n\nit appears that the reason for death is not accident, but it appears\n\nthat the deceased on her own poured kerosene and fired her.\n\nLearned APP read the dying declaration of the deceased, which\n\nwas recorded by the Executive Magistrate, Rohitkumar Variya, who\n\nis P.W.15, wherein it was stated by the deceased that due to\n\nharassment caused by the accused, i.e. her mother-in-law and her\n\nhusband and even she was beaten by them, she poured kerosene\n\nPage 7 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\non her own. Learned APP further submitted that said P.W.15,\n\nRohitkumar also stated in his evidence that the respondents were\n\nsuspecting about the character of the deceased and therefore,\n\nquarrel took place between them. It also reveals from his evidence\n\nthat the respondents accused were harassing and beating the\n\ndeceased. This witness also stated that before recording dying\n\ndeclaration, he verified from the Doctor about consciousness of the\n\ndeceased and said Doctor endorsed same at Exhibit 35.\nLearned\n\nAPP read other evidence of the witnesses, but as per her\n\nsubmission, the complaint, dying declaration and evidence of\n\nP.W.15, Executive Magistrate, are sufficient to prove the case\n\nagainst the accused so far as abetting the deceased in committing\n\nsuicide. Therefore, she submitted that the ingredients of the\n\nalleged offence can be said to be proved against the respondents\n\naccused. But the learned Sessions Judge has not considered the\n\nmain material documents i.e. dying declaration and complaint of\n\nthe deceased during the course of medical treatment. Learned APP\n\nin this connection, relied upon the decision in the case of\nLaxman\n\nVs. State of Maharashtra\nreported in GLH 2003(1) Vol. XLIV (1),\n\nwherein Hon'ble Supreme Court held that \"where it is proved by\n\ntestimony of Magistrate that declarant was to fit to make the\n\nstatement even without examination by the Doctor the declaration\n\ncan be acted upon provided the Court ultimately holds the same to\n\nPage 8 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nbe voluntary and truthful.\" Learned APP, therefore, submitted that\n\nthe same dying declaration was required to be considered in true\n\nand right spirit by the learned Sessions Judge. Learned APP lastly\n\nprayed to allow present appeal by quashing and setting aside the\n\nimpugned judgment and order and the respondents are required\n\nto be convicted and sentenced for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 498(A) and 306 read with\nSection 114\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode.\n\n5. As against, learned advocate Mr. Buddhbhatti along with\n\nlearned advocate Ms. Mishra appearing for the respondents\n\nsubmitted that the witnesses i.e. P.W.6 Rajubhai Godse, P.W. 7\n\nSavitaben, P.W. 8 Narayan Agarwal, P.W.9 Mayuriben, P.W.10\n\nKalidas Mali and P.W.11 Madhuben examined by the prosecution,\n\nwho are relatives of the deceased and the said witnesses\n\nthemselves declared hostile, then there is no question of alleged\n\noffences against the accused and therefore, learned advocates\n\nsubmitted that learned Sessions Judge wrongly convicted and\n\nsentenced the respondent No.1 without there being any cogent\n\nevidence. So, the impugned judgment and order is required to be\n\nquashed and set aside and so far as respondent No.1 is required to\n\nbe acquitted for the offence punishable under\nSection 498-A\nof\n\nthe Indian Penal Code. Learned advocates submitted that even\n\nwhen the recording of the dying declaration, the deceased was not\n\nPage 9 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nin fit mind to give her statement. They also submitted that the\n\ndeceased sustained burn injuries on overall her body and\n\ntherefore, she was not in condition to give her statement in form of\n\ndying declaration. Learned advocates further submitted that the\n\ndeceased sustained injuries due to stove burst and therefore, she\n\ndied and hence, it is not a case of suicide. Learned advocates\n\nfurther submitted that the documents produced on record, are not\n\ncorroborating the evidence of the witnesses examined by the\n\nprosecution and there are so many contradictions. Learned\n\nadvocates further submitted that P.W. 15, Executive Magistrate,\n\nexamined by the prosecution, recorded the dying declaration of\n\nthe deceased, but the deceased was not in fit condition to give\n\nstatement and therefore, the evidence of this witness cannot be\n\nbelieved. Learned advocates further submitted that looking to\n\noverall evidence, it is not established that the accused abetted or\n\ninstigated the deceased to commit suicide and died or it is also not\n\nestablished that the respondents were harassing the deceased by\n\ntorturing or beating by suspecting about her character. They also\n\nsubmitted that looking to the dispute, the respondents were\n\nsuspecting over the character of the deceased, but what type of\n\nsuspicious on the part of the respondents accused is not proved by\n\nthe prosecution.\n\n6. Learned advocates for the respondents submitted that\n\nPage 10 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nlearned Sessions Judge has rightly acquitted the respondents\n\naccused for the charges levelled under\nSection 306\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code because the offence as alleged is not established by\n\nthe prosecution by any cogent evidence.\nIn support their\n\nsubmission, they relied upon the case of\nHans Raj. Vs. State of\n\nHaryana\nreported in AIR 2004 Supreme Court 2790 and\n\nsubmitted that presumption under\nSection 113A\nof the Evidence\n\nAct could not be invoked to find accused husband guilty of offence\n\nunder\nSection 306\nof the Indian Penal Code. Therefore, in the\n\ninstant case, when the offence under\nSection 306\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code is not proved against the accused, then here there is\n\nno question of convicting the accused for the said alleged offence.\n\nThe learned advocates further submitted that in the present case,\n\nthe alleged offence is not established against the accused by the\n\nprosecution and the witnesses were declared hostile and the\n\nversion of the witnesses for the cause for death is bursting of stove\n\ncome out from the oral evidence, the respondent No.1 is required\n\nto be acquitted for alleged offence under\nSection 498 A\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code. Lastly, the learned advocates submitted that\n\nthe appeal is required to be dismissed.\n\n7. Heard both the parties and perused the record of the case. I\n\nhave also minutely perused the impugned judgment and order of\n\nPage 11 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nconviction passed by the learned Sessions Judge.\n\n8. Now, here, looking to the complaint, it reveals that the\n\ndeceased was harassed by the respondents accused and she was\n\nbeaten by wooden piece used for washing cloth and the\n\nrespondent No.2 forced the deceased to give divorce. Therefore,\n\nthe deceased poured kerosene on her and set her at fire. Here the\n\nquestion is required to be considered such that the deceased gave\n\nbirth two children out of her wedlock and even though she\n\ncommitted suicide by leaving them on their position. Other aspect\n\nis the evidence of the witnesses i.e. P.W.6 Rajubhai Godse, P.W. 7\n\nSavitaben, P.W. 8 Narayan Agarwal, P.W.9 Mayuriben, P.W.10\n\nKalidas Mali and P.W.11 Madhuben are relatives of the deceased\n\nbut they turned hostile and they have not supported the\n\nprosecution case. Here the material aspect is such that the\n\ncomplaint which was lodged by the complainant herself before the\n\nAssistant Police Commissioner, \"C\" Division Police Station,\n\nVadodara, on 25.10.2004, wherein the deceased stated that the\n\naccused meted out cruelty on her and she was beaten and told her\n\nto give divorce to the appellant No.1. She also stated that the\n\nrespondents accused were suspecting about her character and\n\ntherefore, they were harassing her. Therefore, she poured\n\nkerosene on her and set her at fire. This complaint was given by\n\nthe deceased herself against the accused. Secondly, the dying\n\nPage 12 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndeclaration which was recorded by the P.W.15, Rohitkumar Variya,\n\nExecutive Magistrate, clearly states the aforesaid version given by\n\nthe deceased. It is also established fact that the cause of death is\n\nnot stove burst or accident, because the stove was not damaged\n\nby any side and if the same was burst, then it was not stated in the\n\nPanchnama. I have minutely perused the evidence of the\n\nwitnesses and documentary evidence produced on record. I have\n\nalso perused the yadi at Exhibit 35 which was addressed to the\n\nSub Divisional Magistrate, Vadodara City informing to record dying\n\ndeclaration of the deceased. From the evidence of P.W.15,\n\nRohitkumar Variya, Executive Magistrate, it appears that the\n\nDoctor endorsed that the deceased was in fit state of mind and\n\ncapable to give her dying declaration.\nTherefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat the deceased was not fit to give her statement at the relevant\n\npoint of time while recording her dying declaration before the\n\nExecutive Magistrate. Therefore, it clearly appears that the\n\ncomplaint, dying declaration and oral evidence of P.W.15 are\n\nleading to prove the offence against the accused. From the various\n\ndecisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as High Court,\n\ndying declaration can be considered as the base of the conviction.\n\nFor the said purpose, I have considered the\nratio\nlaid down in\nthe\n\ncase of\nPatel Hiralal Joitaram Vs. State of Gujarat\nreported in\n\nAIR 2001 SC 2944, wherein it is observed that :\n\nPage 13 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n\"Section 32(1) relates tot eh statement made by a\nperson before his death. Two categories of statement\nare made admissible in evidence and further made\nthem as substantive evidence. They are: (1) His\nstatement as to the cause of his death; (2) His\nstatement as to any of the circumstances of the\ntransaction which resulted in his death. The second\ncategory can envelope a far wider amplitude than the\nfirst category. The words statement as to any of the\ncircumstances are by themselves capable of expanding\nthe width and contours of the scope of admissibility.\nWhen the word circumstances is linked to transaction\nwhich resulted in his death the sub-section casts the\nnet in a very wide dimension. Anything which has a\nnexus with his death, proximate or distant, direct or\nindirect, can also fall within the purview of the\nsubsection. As the possibility of getting the maker of\nthe statements in flesh and blood has been closed once\nand for all the endeavour should be how to include the\nstatement of a dead person within the sweep of the\nsub-section and not how to exclude it therefrom.\nAdmissibility is the first step and once it is admitted the\ncourt has to consider how far it is reliable. Once that\ntest of reliability is found positive the court has to\nconsider the utility of that statement in the particular\ncase.\n\n9.\nIn another case of\nBhola Turha Vs. State of Bihar\nreported\n\nin AIR 1998 SC 1515, it observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nas under :\n\nPage 14 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n\"Dying declaration was made by the deceased within\nabout two hours from the incident and a few hours\nbefore his death. In his dying declaration, he has\nclearly explained how he came to be injured by the\nappellant.\n\nThe eye witness did not support the prosecution\nand were declared hostile. Courts below were fully\njustified in replying upon the dying declaration and\nconvicting the appellant.\"\n\n10. Now, here in this case, the complaint as well as dying\n\ndeclaration were given by the deceased herself and therefore, it\n\ncannot be discarded as it has evidentary value for deciding the\n\nmain factor of abetment, instigation in the case of committing the\n\nsuicide by the deceased.\n\n11. Another case of\nShanmugam Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n\nreported in AIR 2003 SC 209, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nobserved as under :\n\n\"That the dying declaration can form the sole basis for\nconviction is too well settled by a catena of decisions.\nThe dying declaration clearly implicates the accused.\nThe dying declaration in Ex. P. 16 contains the\nquestions and relevant details of the incident. There\nare no suspicious features which affect the credibility\nof the dying declaration. There is no apparent reason\nwhy the deceased should think of want only roping in\nhis brother in the murderous attack. The mere fact\nthat the victim did not make any reference to the\n\nPage 15 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ninjuries received by the accused is not a ground that\nmerits rejection of dying declaration. The Judicial\nMagistrate who was examined as P.W.11 categorically\nstated that he satisfied himself that the victim was\nconscious and was in a position to make the statement\nand he also made an endorsement on P. 16 about the\nconsciousness of the patient. There mere fact that the\nDoctor in whose presence Ex P. 16 was recoded was\nnot examined does not affect the evidentiary value to\nbe attached to the dying declaration. \"\n\n12.\nIn another case of\nRamavati Vs. State of Bihar\nreported in\n\nAIR 1983 SC 164, wherein it is observed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt as under :\n\n\"Dying declaration recorded by the Police Sub-\nInspector is admissible and can be relied for conviction.\nIt is significant to note that in the course of cross-\n\nexamination of the witness proving the dying\ndeclaration, no questions were put as to the state of\nhealth of the deceased and no suggestion was made\nthat the deceased was not in a fit state of health to\nmake any such statement. The doctor's evidence also\nclearly indicates that it was possible for the deceased\nto make the statement attributed to her in the dying\ndeclaration in which her thumb impression had also\nbeen affixed. In the instant case, it cannot also be said\nthat there is no corroborative evidence of the\nstatement contained in the dying declaration. The\nevidence of P. Ws. 1, 4, 5 and 8 clearly corroborates\nthe statement recorded in the dying declaration, we do\n\nPage 16 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nnot find any material on record on the basis of which\nthe testimony of these witnesses can be disbelieved. It\nmay also be noticed that none of these witnesses\nincluding the Police Officer who recorded the\nStatement could be attributed with any kind of ill-\nfeeling against the accused.\"\n\n13.\nIn the case of\nState of Assam Vs. Muhim Barkatari\n\nreported in AIR 1987 SC 98, it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt that \"the deceased had sense and he was speaking. There\n\nwas no cross-examination on this point. Meaning thereby, the\n\ndying declaration is relied upon for the base of conviction and\n\nsentence. Here, in this case, the deceased gave her dying\n\ndeclaration before the Executive Magistrate stating that due to\n\nharassment of the respondents accused, she committed suicide. In\n\nsupport of her said dying declaration, the complaint can be said as\n\nproved.\n\n14. Looking to the aforesaid all the decisions of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, it clearly appears that the dying declaration is\n\nmaterial and important document for holding the accused guilty.\n\nSo, I am of the opinion that in the present case, same can be\n\nconsidered as base for ascertaining the role on the part of the\n\naccused persons as stated by the deceased in her complaint as\n\nwell as in the dying declaration and same are said to be\n\nPage 17 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ntrustworthy and reliable as they are corroborating each other.\n\n15. From the perusal of the case, it appears that the marriage life\n\nof the accused No.1 and deceased was of 10 years. In the present\n\ncase, the deceased when she was neglected by her husband and\n\nher mother-in-law by saying to give divorce, means that the\n\naccused meted out cruelty and thereby abetted the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide. It is natural that a lady, who is having minor\n\nchildren, may not think to commit suicide. This behaviour of the\n\naccused shows that there was tremendous provocation on the part\n\nof the accused which led the deceased to commit suicide. Here in\n\nthis case, the accused had not committed only mental cruelty, but\n\nhe also meted out physical cruelty to the deceased and therefore,\n\nthe deceased took decision to end her life by committing suicide.\n\nSaid ingredients of provocation, instigation are covered by\nSection\nof the Indian Penal Code are proved by the prosecution\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. I have perused the provisions of Section\n\n306 and 498-A as well as\nSection 107\nand\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode as well as also perused provisions of\nSection 113-A\nof the\n\nEvidence Act and I have perused the difference of the provisions of\n\nlaws. Here in the present case, the willful conduct on the part of\n\nthe accused is proved, as the accused intentionally caused torture\n\nto the deceased, which was driven the wife to commit suicide. The\n\ncruelty is sufficiently proved against the accused as per the\n\nPage 18 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nprovisions of\nSection 498(A)\nof the Indian Penal Code. Therefore, it\n\ncan be said that cruelty on the part of the husband is proved by\n\nthe provisions of\nSection 113(A)\nof the Evidence Act, as abetment\n\non the part of the husband and his mother, accused led the wife to\n\ncommit suicide. Abetment means a person abets the doing of a\n\nthing who instigates a person to do that thing. Here in this case,\n\nthere is no any irregularity or ambiguity in the dying declaration,\n\nas the same was given by the deceased in her absolute conscious\n\nposition as stated by the P.W.15 Rohitkumar, Executive Magistrate,\n\nwho recorded dying declaration and she was fit to give the\n\nstatement before him and also she gave her complaint in very\n\nconscious position before the police. Therefore, there is no\n\nquestion to discard this evidence given by the deceased herself\n\nbefore dying in the hospital. Therefore, the alleged offence against\n\nthe accused is very well proved.\n\n16. In various decisions of Hon'ble Apex Court made observation\n\nthat punishment should not be so lenient that it shocks the\n\nconscience of the society being abhorrent to the basic principles of\n\nsentencing. Therefore, it is clear that the accused is required to be\n\npunished for his offence and for such purpose, the lenient view\n\nshould not be taken by the Court while sentencing the accused for\n\nthe alleged offence which is committed by him and same is proved\n\nagainst him.\n\nPage 19 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n17. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the accused\n\nabetted or provoked the deceased to commit suicide and died and\n\ntherefore, the accused are required to be convicted as they are not\n\ninnocent persons. The accused caused cruelty upon her by beating\n\nwith the wooden piece used for washing cloth and taunting her.\n\nThereafter, the incident was occurred and during the course of\n\nmedical treatment, the deceased narrated in her complaint as well\n\nas dying declaration about the cruelty meted out by the accused\n\nhusband and her mother-in-law. In these circumstances, the\n\naccused is liable to be convicted and sentenced for the alleged\n\noffence.\n\n18. I have taken into consideration the provisions of\nSection 306\n\nand\n498-A\nof the Indian Penal Code which are quoted as under :\n\n\"Section 306 :\n\nAbetment of Suicide - if any person commits suicide,\nwhoever, abets the commission of the suicide, shall be\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a\nterm which may extent to ten years and shall also be\nliable to fine.\n\n\"Section 498-A : Husband or relative of husband of a\nwoman subject her to cruelty - whoever, being the\nhusband or the relative of the husband of a woman,\nsubjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to three\nyears and shall also be liable to find.\"\n\nPage 20 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n19. From the bare reading of\nSection 498-A\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode, it is clear that if the husband or relative of the husband of a\n\nwoman subject such woman to cruelty, they shall be liable for\n\npunishment mentioned therein. Moreover, the Explanation to\n\nSection 498-A\nIndian Penal Code defines \"cruelty\" for the purpose\n\nof\nSection 498-A\nIPC to mean (a) any will conduct which is of such\n\na nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to\n\ncause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether\n\nmental or physical) of the woman or (b) harassment of the woman\n\nwhere such harassment, is with a view to concerning her or any\n\nperson related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any\n\nproperty or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or\n\nany person related to her to meet such demand. A reading of\n\nSection 113-A\nof the Evidence Act, 1872 will show that for the\n\npurpose of Section 113-A, the \"cruelty\" shall have the same\n\nmeaning as in\nSection 498A\nof Indian Penal Code. I have also\n\nperused the provisions of\nSection 107\nand\nof the Evidence Act\n\nin connection of the evidence produced by the prosecution.\n\n20. Here in present case, no doubt the learned Sessions Judge\n\nconvicted the accused persons for the offence punishable under\n\nSection 498-A\nof the Indian Penal Code and sentenced simple\n\nimprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.200/- each, in\n\nPage 21 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndefault, further S.I. for one month. Thereafter, the learned Sessions\n\nJudge acquitted the accused No.2 by considering the provisions of\n\nSection 360\nof the Indian Penal Code or gave the benefit of\n\nprobation under the provisions of\nSection 4\n,\n,\nof the Probation of\n\nOffenders Act. From the bare reading of the operative order\n\nportion, it appears that the learned Sessions Judge has held the\n\nrespondent No.1 guilty, but, not awarded sentence by ordering\n\nthat no separate sentence is required to be awarded to the\n\naccused No.1 for the offence punishable under\nSection 306\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code. Therefore, it is crystal clear that the both\n\naccused were held guilty for the alleged offence, no doubt, learned\n\nSessions Judge by considering age and responsibility of the\n\nchildren of the accused No.1, granted bail by suspending the\n\naforesaid sentence and under the provisions of\nSection 360\nof the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure or\nSections 4\n,\n,\nof the Probation of\n\nOffenders Act, and imposed some conditions.\n\n21. In view of the above operative portion of the impugned\n\njudgment and order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, it\n\nappears that the learned Sessions Judge has committed grave\n\nerror in imposing sentence to the accused persons, specifically,\n\nthe benefits was given to the accused No.2. Therefore, the\n\nimpugned judgment and order passed by the learned Sessions\n\nJudge is required to be quashed and set aside. Here, it is\n\nPage 22 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nestablished fact that the accused committed alleged offence,\n\nwhich is proved by the judgment and order of the learned Sessions\n\nJudge and therefore, the accused are required to be punished for\n\nthe alleged offence. Hence, this Court pass following order :\n\n(a) Present Appeal is allowed.\n\n(b) The judgment and order dated 24.6.2005 passed by the\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge and Fast Track Court No.6,\n\nVadodara, in Sessions Case No.13 of 2005, is hereby\n\nquashed and set aside.\n\n(c) The respondents - accused are convicted for the\n\noffence punishable under Section 306 of the Indian Penal\n\nCode, and to undergo sentence of 7 years R.I. and to pay fine\n\nof Rs.2,000/- each, in default, further one year R.I.\n\n(d) So far as sentence imposed upon the respondent No.1\n\nby the learned Sessions Judge for the offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 498(A)\nof the Indian Penal Code is concerned,\n\nsame shall remain unaltered.\n\n(e) The respondent No.2 is convicted for the offence\n\npunishable under Section 498(A) of the Indian Penal Code,\n\nand to undergo sentence of 1 years S.I. and to pay fine of\n\nRs.2,00/-, in default, further one month S.I.\n\n(f) The period during which the accused remained in\nprison, shall be given set off.\n\n(g) All the sentences shall run concurrently.\n\nPage 23 of 24\n\nR/CR.A/20/2006 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n(h) The respondents - accused are hereby ordered to\n\nsurrender before the concerned Jail Authority within a period\n\nof four weeks from today. Their bail bonds stand cancelled.\n\n(i) R & P to be sent back to the concerned trial court\n\nforthwith.\n\n(Z.K.SAIYED, J.)\nYNVYAS\n\nPage 24 of 24",
