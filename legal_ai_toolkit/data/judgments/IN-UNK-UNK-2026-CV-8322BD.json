Since both the applications are connected, parties being\n common so also the issue, they are being disposed of by this\n common oral judgment. Parties have been referred to as per their\n status in civil application no.3285 of 2024.\n\n 2. Mr Archit P. Jani, learned advocate appearing for the applicant,\n submitted that the applicant has Agreement to Sell dated\n 17.03.2022 in his favour, executed by the respondents, except\n respondent no.10. It is submitted that Special Civil Suit no.277 of\n 2022 was filed by the respondents against the respondent no.10,\n seeking cancellation of the alleged Agreement to Sell executed on\n 01.01.2013, only with a view to nullifying the rights of the applicant.\n Another Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2022 was filed by the respondent\n no.10 seeking specific performance of the said Agreement to Sell\n dated 01.01.2013 against the rest of the respondents.\n\n 2.1 It is submitted that it is surprising to note that the Special Civil\n Suit no.11 of 2023 was filed on 11.01.2023 and respondent no.9\n appeared on 13.01.2023 on his behalf and on behalf of the others\n and immediately within a span of 10 days i.e. on 21.01.2023, it was\n disposed of on the ground of settlement. Similarly, the Special Civil\n Suit no.277 of 2022 was disposed of on 11.02.2023. It is further\n submitted that the applicant was not made party in any of the suits\n filed by the respondents individually or jointly.\n\n 2.2 It is next submitted that respondent no.9 preferred a Special\n Civil Suit no.14 of 2023 seeking cancellation of the registered\n Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022; however, subsequently, on\n 14.07.2023 it came to be withdrawn simplicitor. It is submitted that\n the details of the suits and the Agreement to Sell were missing;\n however, the suit was withdrawn with an assurance that the sale\n\n Page 2 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n deed would be executed in favour of the applicant.\n\n 2.3 It is submitted that after the passing of the consent decree,\n Execution Petition was filed and as a result, on 08.04.2023, order\n has been passed by the learned Additional Senior Civil Judge\n appointing the Court Commissioner. It is thereafter, that the\n registered sale deeds have been executed by the Court\n Commissioner. It is submitted that the applicant having no option\n had to file a Special Civil Suit no.299 of 2023 seeking specific\n performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 and is\n pending. It is submitted that the applicant is severely prejudiced by\n the consent decree inasmuch as, it had paid consideration of Rs.50\n lacs and when there is a registered Agreement to Sell coupled with\n the consideration, the respondents i.e. original owners have no\n option but to execute sale deed in his favour.\n\n 2.4 It is submitted that it is also not in dispute that at the time of\n execution of the registered Agreement to Sell, there were no civil\n cases pending by the original owners or against the original owners.\n So far as the so called Agreement to Sell dated 01.01.2013 in favour\n of the respondent no.10 is concerned, the same also creates a\n doubt inasmuch as, for almost 10 years, no steps were taken and\n only in the years 2022 and 2023, the suit proceedings were\n initiated. It is submitted that the suits were filed only with a view to\n seeing that the rights of the applicant is prejudiced. Surreptitious\n filing of the suits by the respondents, inter se, was nothing but an\n abuse of process of law.\n\n \n2.5 Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of \nSakina\n Sultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors. vs. Shia Imami Ismaili Momin\n Jamat Samaj & Ors.\n reported in 2020 (1) GLR 586. It is submitted\n that it is by now well settled that a third party who was not a party\n\n Page 3 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n to the suit or compromise, but had an interest in the subject matter\n of compromise and is aggrieved by the decree passed by the Court\n under \nOrder 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908\n (hereinafter referred to as \"the Code\"), the remedy available to him\n is to either approach very same Court seeking review or to file an\n appeal with the leave of the Court under the provisions of sub-\n section (1) of \nSection 96\n of the Code. It is submitted that while\n summarizing, the Full Bench, has held and observed that if the\n aggrieved party was not the party to the suit, the remedy available\n to him, to challenge the decree passed by the Court on the basis of\n the compromise between the parties to the suit (consent decree),\n would be to file an appeal under sub-section (1) of \nSection 96\n of the\n Code with the leave of the appellate court or to file a review\n application before the Court which passed the decree, as may be\n permissible under \nSection 114\n read with Order 43 of the Code. It is\n therefore submitted that the remedy available to the applicant, is to\n challenge the compromise deed, after seeking the leave of this\n Court. It is submitted that the option to file suit, is not available.\n\nReliance is placed on the judgment in the case of \nPraash Robin\n Nayudu vs. Rev. Imanuel S. Kant\n reported in 2023 (2) GLR 1319.\n\n \n2.6 Further reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\n \nGulam Nabi Khanday and Others vs. Mushtaq Ahmad and Others\n\n reported in 2024 SCC OnLine J&K 107.\n \nReliance is also placed on the\n judgment of the Apex Court in the case of M/s. \nSree Surya\n Developers & Promoters vs. N. Shailesh Prasad\n reported in (2022) 5\n SCC 736, wherein, it has been held and observed that a party to a\n consent decree, to challenge the compromise decree on the ground\n that the decree was not lawful, has to approach the same Court\n which recorded the compromise and a separate suit challenging the\n consent decree, would not be maintainable.\n\n Page 4 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n 2.7 Further reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\n\n \nPushpa Devi Bhagat vs. Rajinder Singh and Others\n reported in\n (2006) 5 SCC 566. Specific reference is made to paragraph 17\n wherein, while referring to the amended provisions of Order 23 of\n the Code, inter alia, it has been held and observed that no appeal is\n maintainable against the consent decree having regard to the\n specific bar contained in sub-section (3) of \nSection 96\n of the Code.\n Besides, no independent suit can be filed for setting aside a\n compromise decree on the ground that the compromise was not\n lawful; in view of the bar contained in Rule 3-A of the Code.\n\n 2.8 While summing up, it is contended that there was a registered\n Agreement to Sell in favour of the applicant. Moreover, the applicant\n has paid an amount of Rs.50 lacs. It was only keeping in dark the\n applicant, that the suits were filed and settlements were arrived at.\n Respondent no.9 was fully aware about the Agreement to Sell and\n hence, the suits filed by the respondents were nothing but fraud\n played upon the Court. In the circumstances, the applicant be\n permitted a leave to file the appeal.\n\n 3. Per contra, Mr S. P. Majmudar, learned advocate appearing\n with Mr Hardik J. Karathiya, learned advocate for the respondent\n no.10, submitted that the application, suffers from vice of\n suppression of material fact inasmuch as, the applicant has chosen\n not to disclose the factum of filing of the suit by him seeking specific\n performance of the Agreement to Sell. Though reference is made of\n all other suit, the details of the suit filed by the applicant is missing\n and hence, the application deserves to be rejected only on the\n ground of suppression of material fact.\n\n 3.1 It is further submitted that clearly, the applicant, is mere\n holder of the Agreement to Sell and has no other interest in the\n property and therefore, appealable interest is not in favour of the\n\n Page 5 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n applicant owing to passing of the consent decree. It is further\n submitted that it is settled that under the provisions of the \nTransfer\n of Property Act, 1882\n (hereinafter referred to as \"\nTP Act\n\"),\n Agreement to Sell does not create any interest. As against this,\n there is a registered sale deed executed in favour of respondent\n no.10. Also, the applicant is neither a necessary nor a proper party.\n If at all, the applicant is aggrieved or has any grievance, it has to\n prove his case independently and on its own merits, without\n referring to the proceedings or the documents executed between\n the respondents.\n\n \n3.2 Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of \nPatel\n Vinodbhai Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai Kacharabhai\n reported in\n 2021 (3) GLR 2601. It is submitted that the issue stands fully\n covered by the principle \nlaid down in\n \nthe said judgment\n. Not only\n the principle but the facts, were also identical. This Court, has\n considered the aspect of aggrieved person so also the appealable\n interest of the aggrieved person. Coordinate Bench, after\n considering various judgments on the point so also the provisions of\n \nSection 96\n and Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code, has held and observed\n that in order to acquire the status of the aggrieved party, the person\n must have legal interest and enforceable right which would in turn\n allow him to question the decree or order by preferring appeal\n though, he may not be a party to the suit or the proceedings. It has\n also been held and observed that the applicants who claim their\n interest on the basis of the Agreement to Sell, could not be said to\n be holding any interest in the property to be within the definition of\n \"legally aggrieved or prejudiced persons\".\n\n \n3.3 For the proposition that Agreement to Sell does not confer any\n interest, reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of \nSuraj\n Lamp and Industries Pvt. Limited vs. State of Haryana\n reported in\n\n Page 6 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n (2012) 1 SCC 656. It has been held and observed that any\n agreement to sell which is not a registered deed of conveyance\n would fall short of the requirements of \nSections 54\n and \n55\n of the TP\n Act and will not confer any title or transfer any interest in\n immovable property. \nSection 54\n defines the term 'sale' and would\n mean a transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or\n promised or part-paid and part-promised. The provision also\n envisages that such transfer in the case of tangible immoveable\n property can be made only by a registered instrument.\n\n \n3.4 Reliance is also placed on the judgment in the case of\n \nVenigalla Koteswaramma vs. Malampati Suryamba\n reported in\n (2021) 4 SCC 246. It is submitted that law enunciated by the Apex\n Court, is that as per the provisions of \nSection 54\n of the TP Act, an\n agreement for sale of immoveable property does not, of itself,\n create any interest in or charge on such property; a person having\n an agreement for sale in his favour does not get any right in the\n property, except the right of obtaining sale deed on that basis.\n\n \n3.5 In support of the submission of suppression of material fact,\n reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of \nHMT Ltd. vs.\n Rukmini and Others\n reported in AIR 2024 SC 4677. The Apex Court,\n in no uncertain terms, stated that a person seeking equitable relief,\n must come with clean hands, put forward all facts before the Court\n without concealing or suppressing anything and seek appropriate\n relief. It is submitted that when a person does not disclose all the\n correct facts, he would be guilty of misleading the Court. In the\n present case, though the applicant has mentioned about all the\n suits, has chosen not to state about the suit filed by him against the\n respondent no.9 seeking specific performance. The applicant has\n already initiated the proceedings of specific performance and he has\n to prove his rights independently and on the strength of his own\n\n Page 7 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n case.\n\n 3.6 It is further submitted that the judgment of Full Bench will not\n apply to the applicant, as the applicant cannot be said to be\n aggrieved party. It is only the party who has the appealable interest,\n can be permitted to file the appeal. The applicant, has to satisfy that\n he has an appealable interest. In view of mere Agreement to Sell,\n the applicant, cannot claim that he has the appealable interest. It is\n therefore urged that the applications do not deserve to be\n entertained and may not be accepted.\n\n 4. In a brief rejoinder, Mr Archit P. Jani, learned advocate for the\n applicant, submitted that suppression, has to be of a material fact.\n In the present case, the filing of the suit would not be material or\n connected with the issue raised. Even otherwise, in the appeal\n memo, there is a specific reference of the suit filed by the applicant\n and hence, by no stretch of imagination, it can be construed that\n there was a suppression by the applicant. It is also submitted that\n Agreement to Sell does not confer any right but, the applicant can't\n wait until the order of consent decree is set aside. The applicant,\n would not get any relief unless the consent decree is challenged and\n is quashed and set aside. It is submitted that if the suit were to be\n allowed then there is nothing left to be executed in favour of the\n applicant and hence, consent decrees have to go.\n\n \n4.1 Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of \nR.\n Janakiammal vs. S. K. Kumarasamy (Deceased) Through Legal\n Representatives and Others\n reported in (2021) 9 SCC 114. It is\n submitted that the suit against the consent decree would not be\n maintainable is a clear ratio \nlaid down by\n the Apex Court in \nthe said\n judgment\n.\n \nFurther reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\n \nMooman Jafferali Aliji Maknojiya vs. Shia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat\n Samaj\n reported in 2021 (0) AIJEL-HC-243430. The said judgment has\n\n Page 8 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n been relied upon, for the proposition of aggrieved party.\n \nReliance is\n also placed on the judgment in the case of \nV. N. Krishna Murthy and\n Another vs. Ravikumar and Others\n reported in (2020) 9 SCC 501.\n\n 4.2 It is therefore urged that the applicant is very much aggrieved\n party and hence, be permitted the leave to challenge the order and\n consent decree, both dated 21.01.2023 as well as order and decree\n both dated 11.02.2023 passed by the Court below.\n\n 5. Heard the learned advocates appearing for the respective\n parties. Considered the facts, the law and the record made\n available.\n\n 6. Tersely stated are the facts. Discernibly, Special Civil Suit\n no.277 of 2022 was filed by the respondents except respondent\n no.10 seeking declaration that the Agreement to Sell dated\n 13.01.2022 as well as the possession receipt be declared as illegal\n and bad as the same has been executed without the knowledge of\n the plaintiffs. Subsequent thereto, the respondent no.10 filed\n Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2023, inter alia, seeking specific\n performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 01.01.2013 and for\n consequential relief of possession, pursuant to the possession\n receipt dated 22.01.2016.\n\n 7. Apparently, in the Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022, the\n parties have submitted compromise purshis - Exhibit 13 and the\n learned Judge, has passed an order dated 11.02.2023 in terms of\n the compromise purshis. Decree was drawn accordingly of the same\n date. On the other hand, in Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2023\n compromise purshis - Exhibit 8 was filed with the Court below and\n the order has been passed dated 21.01.2023, disposing of the suit\n in terms of the purshis. Decree was passed accordingly of the same\n date.\n\n Page 9 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n 8. Apropos the above referred two orders and decrees, that\n execution proceeding no.4 of 2023 was initiated. Order dated\n 08.04.2023 came to be passed below Exhibits 1, 6 and 8 appointing\n the Court Commissioner for the purpose of executing the sale deed\n and order dated 19.04.2023 below Exhibits 1, 6, 9 and 23 for\n appointing Court Commissioner and executing sale deed. After the\n proceeding, ultimately registered sale deeds have been executed by\n the Court Commissioner. It is the compromise deed; the orders\n passed thereon and the consequential order dated 08.04.2023 and\n sale deeds executed in the execution proceedings, which have\n given rise to the captioned application by the applicant seeking\n leave to challenge the order and consent decree both dated\n 11.02.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022 as well as\n order and decree both dated 21.01.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit\n no.11 of 2023.\n\n 9. While adverting to the facts touching the applicant, notably,\n Agreement to Sell was executed by the respondent nos.1 to 9 dated\n 17.03.2022. It is the case of the applicant that when there was an\n Agreement to Sell, the suits filed, could not have been settled\n between the parties, as the rights of the applicant have been\n prejudicely affected. The applicant has also filed Special Civil Suit\n no.299 of 2023 against the respondents seeking specific\n performance of the Agreement to Sell as well as challenging the\n registered sale deeds in favour of the respondent no.10. Clearly, it is\n the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022, on the basis whereof, the\n applicant is claiming his right so as to challenge the orders passed\n in the suits. Hence, one needs to ascertain as to whether any rights\n can be said to have been invested or conferred upon the applicant\n so as to take out the captioned proceedings. Thus, few judgments\n on the point are worth referring to.\n\n Page 10 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n 10. \nIn the case of \nSakina Sultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors. vs.\n Shia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj & Ors.\n (supra), the full\n bench, in paragraph 30 of the judgment has stated that when a\n person aggrieved is third party who was neither a party to suit nor a\n party to the compromise on the basis of which the decree was\n passed would not be bound by such decree. Such decree cannot be\n said to be consent decree qua such party and therefore, either the\n bar contained in sub-section (3) of \nSection 96\n or bar under Rule 3-A\n of the Order XXIII, would not be applicable to him. Such an\n aggrieved party with a leave of the Court can always file an appeal\n as per the provisions of the Code and can challenge the validity of\n the compromise decree on the grounds available to him. The full\n bench, while summing up its reasoning, in paragraph 40 (vii) has\n observed thus:\n\n \"(vii) If the aggrieved party was not the party to the suit, the\n remedy available to him to challenge the decree passed by the\n Court on the basis of compromise between the parties to the suit\n (consent decree), would be to file an appeal under \nSection 96(1)\n of\n C.P.C., with the leave of the appellate Court, or to file a review\n application before the Court, which passed the decree, as may be\n permissible under \nSection 114\n read with \nOrder XLVII of C.P.C\n.\"\n\n 11. Therefore, the aggrieved third party, who is not a party to the\n suit or compromise, the remedy available to him is to file an appeal\n with the leave of the Court, as neither the consent decree nor the\n orders would be binding upon him. The issue then would arises is as\n to who can be said to be an aggrieved party. A person aggrieved,\n must be a person who had suffered a legal grievance, against whom\n a decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him\n of something or wrongfully refused him something or wrongfully\n affected his title of something and it does not include a person who\n suffers from a psychological or an imaginary injury. A person\n aggrieved must therefore necessarily be one whose right or interest\n\n Page 11 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n has been adversely affected or jeopardized.\n\n 12. \nIn the case of \nMooman Jafferali Aliji Maknojiya vs. Shia Imami\n Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj\n (supra), the coordinate bench, while\n considering the application seeking leave to appeal has held and\n observed that a stranger cannot be permitted to file an appeal in\n any proceedings unless he satisfies the Court that he falls within the\n category of aggrieved person. It is only where the judgment and\n decree prejudicely affects the person, who is not a party to the\n proceedings, can prefer an appeal with the leave of the appellate\n Court. The expression, \"person aggrieved\" has been lucidly\n explained to mean that it does not include a person who suffers\n from a psychological or an imaginary injury; a person aggrieved\n must therefore, necessarily be one, whose right or interest has been\n adversely affected or jeopardized. Summarizing the principle, in\n paragraph 16, this Court, has observed thus:\n\n 16. The principles governing grant of leave to appeal may be\n summarised as under :\n\n (i) \nSections 96\n and \n100\n of the CPC provide for preferring an appeal\n from an original decree or decree in appeal respectively;\n\n (ii) the said provisions do not enumerate the categories of persons\n who can file an appeal;\n\n (iii) however it a settled legal proposition that a stranger cannot be\n permitted to file an appeal in any proceedings unless he satisfies the\n Court that he falls within the category of aggrieved person;\n\n (iv) it is only where a judgment and decree prejudicially affects a\n person who is not a party to the proceedings, he can prefer an\n appeal with the leave of the Court;\n\n (v) a person aggrieved, to file an appeal, must be one whose right is\n affected by reason of the judgment and decree sought to be\n impugned;\n\n (vi) the expression person aggrieved does not include a person who\n suffers from a psychological or an imaginary injury;\n\n (vii) it would be improper to grant leave to appeal to every person\n who may in some remote or indirect way be prejudicially affected by\n a decree or judgment; and\n\n Page 12 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n (viii) ordinarily leave to appeal should be granted to persons who,\n though not parties to the proceedings, would be bound by the\n decree or judgment in that proceeding and who would be precluded\n from attacking its correctness in other proceedings.\"\n\n 13. \nIn the case of \nR. Janakiammal vs. S. K. Kumarasamy\n (Deceased) Through Legal Representatives and Others\n (supra), the\n Apex Court, was dealing with the provisions of Order 23, Rule 3 and\n 3-A of the Code. The principle which can be deduced is, that the\n remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such\n consent decree is to approach the Court which recorded the\n compromise and made a decree in terms of it and establish that\n there was no compromise. In that event, the Court which recorded\n the compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to\n whether there was a valid compromise or not. It has been observed\n that this is so because a consent decree is nothing but a contract\n between parties superimposed with a seal of approval of the Court.\n The validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of\n the agreement or compromise on which it is made. Therefore, the\n compromise on the basis of which the consent decree is passed, is\n merely a contract. Consent decree is nothing but a contract\n between the parties superimposed with a seal of the approval of the\n Court.\n\n 14. The present applicant who is seeking leave to appeal to\n challenge the order and decree dated 21.01.2023 and order and\n decree both dated 11.02.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit no.11 of\n 2023 and Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022, respectively, whether\n can be said to be an aggrieved party and if yes, what would be the\n remedy available to the applicant as he was not a party to the suit\n proceedings. Therefore, the first and foremost threshold to be\n cleared is that third party should be an aggrieved person.\n\n 15. \nIn the case of \nSuraj Lamp and Industries Pvt. Limited vs. State\n of Haryana\n (supra), the Apex Court considered the provisions of\n\n Page 13 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n \nSections 5\n, \n53A\n, \n54\n of the TP Act as well as \nSection 17\n of the\n Registration Act, 1908. It has been held and observed that \nSection\n 54\n of the TP Act makes it clear that contract of sale, that is, an\n agreement of sale, does not, of itself, create any interest in or\n charge on such property. While discussing the provisions of \nSection\n 17\n i.e. requirement of registration of document, it has been held and\n observed that transfer of immovable property by way of sale can\n only be by a deed of conveyance and in absence of a deed of\n conveyance (duly stamped and registered as required by law), no\n right, title or interest in an immoveable property can be transferred.\n In paragraph 12, it has been further observed that any contract of\n sale (agreement to sell) which is not a registered deed of\n conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of the requirements of\n \nSections 54\n and \n55\n of TP Act and will not confer any title nor\n transfer any interest in an immovable property (except to the\n limited right granted under \nSection 53A\n of TP Act). According to TP\n Act, an agreement of sale, whether with possession or without\n possession, is not a conveyance as \nSection 54\n of TP Act provides\n that sale of immoveable property can be made only by a registered\n instrument. Paragraphs 11 and 12 are reproduced hereinbelow for\n ready reference.\n\n \n\"11. \nSection 54\n of TP Act makes it clear that a contract of sale,\n that is, an agreement of sale does not, of itself, create any interest\n in or charge on such property. This Court in \nNarandas Karsondas v.\n S.A. Kamtam and Anr.\n (1977) 3 SCC 247, observed:\n\n A contract of sale does not of itself create any interest in, or\n charge on, the property. This is expressly declared in \nSection 54\n of\n the Transfer of Property Act. See Rambaran Prosad V/s. Ram Mohit\n Hazra [1967]1 SCR 293. The fiduciary character of the personal\n obligation created by a contract for sale is recognised in \nSection 3\n\n of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and in \nSection 91\n of the Trusts Act.\n The personal obligation created by a contract of sale is described\n in \nSection 40\n of the Transfer of Property Act as an obligation\n arising out of contract and annexed to the ownership of property,\n but not amounting to an interest or easement therein.\"\n\n In India, the word `transfer' is defined with reference to the word\n `convey'. The word `conveys' in \nsection 5\n of Transfer of Property\n\n Page 14 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n Act is used in the wider sense of conveying ownership... ...that only\n on execution of conveyance ownership passes from one party to\n another....\"\n\n \nIn \nRambhau Namdeo Gajre v. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra\n [2004 (8) SCC\n 614] this Court held:\n\n \"Protection provided under \nSection 53A\n of the Act to the proposed\n transferee is a shield only against the transferor. It disentitles the\n transferor from disturbing the possession of the proposed\n transferee who is put in possession in pursuance to such an\n agreement. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the\n proposed transferor who remains full owner of the property till it is\n legally conveyed by executing a registered sale deed in favour of\n the transferee. Such a right to protect possession against the\n proposed vendor cannot be pressed in service against a third\n party.\"\n\n It is thus clear that a transfer of immoveable property by way of\n sale can only be by a deed of conveyance (sale deed). In the\n absence of a deed of conveyance (duly stamped and registered as\n required by law), no right, title or interest in an immoveable\n property can be transferred.\n\n 12. Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a\n registered deed of conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of\n the requirements of \nsections 54\n and \n55\n of TP Act and will not\n confer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable property\n (except to the limited right granted under \nsection 53A\n of TP Act).\n According to TP Act, an agreement of sale, whether with\n possession or without possession, is not a conveyance. \nSection 54\n\n of TP Act enacts that sale of immoveable property can be made\n only by a registered instrument and an agreement of sale does not\n create any interest or charge on its subject matter.\"\n\n \n16. Similarly, in the case of \nVenigalla Koteswaramma vs.\n Malampati Suryamba\n (supra), the Apex Court, has held and\n observed that as per \nSection 54\n of the TP Act, an agreement for sale\n of immovable property does not, of itself, create any interest in or\n charge on such property. A person having an agreement for sale in\n his favour does not have any right, except the right of obtaining sale\n deed on that basis. Paragraphs 39 and 39.1 of \nthe said judgment\n,\n read thus:\n\n \"39. Apart from the above, it is also fundamental, as per \nSection 54\n\n of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, agreement for sale of\n immoveable property does not, of itself, create any interest in or\n charge on such property, Bank of India v. Abhay D. Narottam and\n Ors.: (2005) 11 SCC 520. A person having an agreement for sale in\n his favour does not get any right in the property, except the right of\n\n Page 15 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n obtaining sale deed on that basis8. For ready reference, we may\n reproduce \nSection 54\n of the Transfer of Property Act that reads as\n under: -\n\n \"54. \"Sale\" defined.- \"Sale\" is a transfer of ownership in exchange for\n a price paid or promised or part-paid and partpromised. Sale how\n made.- Such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable property of\n the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a\n reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered\n instrument. In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value\n less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by\n a registered instrument or by delivery of the property. Delivery of\n tangible immoveable property takes place when the seller places the\n buyer, or such person as he directs, in possession of the property.\n\n Contract for sale.- A contract for the sale of immoveable property is\n a contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms\n settled between the parties. It does not, of itself, create any interest\n in or charge on such property.\"\n\n 39.1. It goes without saying that the alleged agreement for sale did\n not invest the vendee with title to, or any interest in, the property in\n question; and the alleged agreement for sale did not invest the\n vendee with any such right that the plaintiff could not have\n maintained her claim for partition in respect of the properties left by\n Annapurnamma without seeking declaration against the agreement.\n Therefore, this plea about non-maintainability of suit for want for\n relief of declaration against the said agreement for sale remains\n totally baseless and could only be rejected.\"\n\n 17. Therefore, it is well settled that the transfer of immovable\n property by way of sale can only be by a deed of conveyance and\n deed of conveyance, has to be duly stamped and registered as\n required by law and in absence thereof, no right, title or interest in\n an immovable property can be transferred. The law enunciated, is\n also that any contract of sale which is not registered deed of\n conveyance would fall short of the requirements of \nSections 54\n and\n \n55\n of the TP Act and will not confer any title or interest in an\n immovable property.\n\n 18. Concededly and not in dispute, the applicant is claiming right\n flowing from the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 executed by\n the respondents except respondent no.10. Concededly, there is no\n sale deed executed in favour of the applicant by the respondents.\n Therefore, the issue which arises for consideration of this Court, is\n\n Page 16 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n as to whether in absence of any registered sale deed, in tune with\n the provisions of \nSection 54\n of the TP Act read with \nSection 17\n of the\n Registration Act, 1908, can it be said that any right or interest has\n been invested in the applicant. Also, merely on the basis of the\n Agreement to Sell, whether the applicant can be said to be an\n aggrieved person. Clearly, answer to both the above referred issues\n has to be in negative in view of the above referred judgments and\n principle laid down therein.\n\n \n19. At this stage, the judgment of the coordinate bench directly\n on the point, is apt to be referred to. In the case of \nPatel Vinodbhai\n Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai Kacharabhai\n (supra), the question that\n fell for consideration and recorded in paragraph 2 was that whether\n the applicants, not a party to the suit, which resulted into\n compromise decree, can be said to be an aggrieved party to be\n entitled to be conferred right to appeal and to be consequently\n granted leave to appeal. The answer was given in negative by\n holding that the applicants do not qualify on facts and in law to be\n the aggrieved persons to be entitled to question the compromise\n decree between the parties to the suit in question by preferring\n appeal thereagainst. It has also been held that whatever rights the\n applicants can claim on the basis of agreement to sell in their\n favour, they have to establish such rights and the enforceability\n thereof in an independent proceedings by filing separate suit. The\n suit for specific performance was filed with respect to Agreement to\n Sell dated 29.06.2008 read with supplementary agreement dated\n 27.09.2011 executed by the defendants therein. Compromise\n purshis was filed and decree was passed in terms of the\n compromise. The applicants were aggrieved by the said\n compromise decree on the ground that the plaintiff had executed an\n agreement to sell dated 05.08.2008 in favour of five persons and\n those persons, executed an Agreement to Sell in favour of the\n\n Page 17 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n applicant, and the applicants claimed that they have acquired the\n interest in the subject property.\n \nReliance was placed on the\n judgment in the case of \nSakina Sultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors.\n vs. Shia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj & Ors.\n (supra). The\n coordinate bench, considered the provisions of \nSection 96\n, Order 23\n Rule 3 of the Code. The aspect of aggrieved person was considered\n in detail and this Court, held that as per the law enunciated, the\n person filing appeal must have a legal grievance against the\n decision which wrongfully deprived him of something or affected his\n title to something. This Court, after considering various judgments,\n provisions; held that in order to be entitled to prefer an appeal, a\n person must be one who can be said to be aggrieved against the\n judgment. The aggrievement has to be a legal aggrievement where\n the aggrieved person could be said to be prejudicially affected to\n permit him to prefer appeal even if he is not a party to the suit\n proceedings. He must have an appealable interest. A party who\n would be benefited because of the change in the judgment by\n redressal of the legal injuria is said to have an appealable interest.\n Paragraph 9 and connected paragraphs read thus:\n\n \"9.Having discussed the principles of law as above and particularly\n considering the concept of 'aggrieved person' to be entitled to enjoy\n the right to appeal, now the basic facts of the case may be\n recapitulated and reverted to. The plaintiff Patel Pravinbhai\n Kachrabhai of Special Civil Suit No.31 of 2012 had executed\n agreement to sell dated 05th August, 2008 in respect of the subject\n matter property involved in the above Special Civil Suit for specific\n performance between the plaintiff and the defendants in favour of\n one Patel Bharatkumar and three others. This Bharatkumar and three\n others, subsequently on 09th December, 2008 executed another\n document being agreement for sale in favour of the present\n applicants. When the suit was compromised between the parties to\n the suit, the applicants on the basis of the above agreements dated\n 05th August, 2008 followed by 09th December, 2008 claimed their\n interest to project themselves as the party aggrieved qua the\n compromise decree.\n\n 9.1 In other words, what is fundamental is that in order to be entitled\n to prefer an appeal, a person must be one who can be said to be\n aggrieved against the judgment. This aggrievement has to be a legal\n aggrievement where the aggrieved person could be said to be\n\n Page 18 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n prejudicially affected to permit him to prefer appeal even if he is not\n a party to the suit proceedings. He must have an appealable interest.\n A party who would be benefited because of the change in the\n judgment by redressal of legal injuria, is said to have an appealable\n interest. The change in the judgment prayed to be appealed against\n by the third party, when brings an immediate right or legal benefit,\n then the person can be said to be having appealable interest. This\n appealable interest should not be contingent, speculative or\n futurative. The appealable interest must be substantial and\n immediate.\n\n 9.2 In order to acquire the status of aggrieved party, the person must\n have legal interest and an enforceable right which would in turn\n allowing him to question the decree or order by preferring appeal,\n though he may not be a party to the suit or proceedings. The\n applicants who claim their interest on the basis of the agreements to\n sell as above could not be said to be holding any interest in the\n property to be within the definition of legally aggrieved or prejudiced\n persons. As the applicants are not 'aggrieved party' vis-a-vis the\n compromise decree having regard to their legal status, they could not\n be clothed with right to appeal. They do not have 'appelable interest'\n in connection with the compromise decree.\"\n\n \n20. The facts on hand are in close proximity to the facts available\n in the case of \nPatel Vinodbhai Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai\n Kacharabhai\n (supra) and \nthe said judgment\n, would directly apply so\n also the principle.\n\n \n21. Contention is also raised that the suit would not be\n maintainable against the consent decree, in view of the judgment in\n the case of \nPushpa Devi Bhagat vs. Rajinder Singh and Others\n\n (supra). Pertinently, the facts were that the suit was filed by the\n landlords against the appellant therein for recovery of the\n possession. Recording the submissions of the learned advocate,\n order was passed disposing of the suit as settled and parties were\n directed to be bound by the statements made. Subsequently, for\n some of the respondents appearance was filed. It is thereafter, a\n fresh decree was drawn in terms of the final order. It is at that point\n of time, that the appellant therein filed an application for setting\n aside the decree dated 18.07.2001 on the ground that she had not\n instructed her counsel to enter into any compromise on her behalf\n and in absence of any written compromise between the parties, duly\n\n Page 19 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n signed, there was no lawful agreement or compromise. Application\n for setting aside the consent decree was not pursued but appeal\n was filed before the learned District Judge. Consent decree came to\n be set aside on the ground that there was no agreement or\n compromise reduced in writing and signed by the parties. The\n matter was remanded to the trial court. The judgment was subject\n matter of challenge before the Delhi High Court under Order 43 Rule\n (1-u) of the Code and it allowed the landlord's appeal on the ground\n that consent decree did not fall under the first part of Order 23 Rule\n 3 requiring an agreement or compromise between the parties to be\n in writing and signed by the parties but fell under the second part of\n the said provisions.\n\n 22. It is this judgment of the High Court, which was challenged in\n appeal before the Apex Court and the issues were, (i) whether the\n appeal filed under \nSection 96\n of the Code against the consent\n decree was maintainable and (ii) whether the compromise resulting\n in a consent decree dated 18.07.2001 was not a valid compromise\n under Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code. With this background, the Apex\n Court, held that against consent decree no independent suit can be\n filed for setting aside the consent decree on the ground that\n compromise was not lawful in view of the bar contained in Rule 3-A\n of the Code. The Apex Court, in paragraph 17, has observed thus:\n\n \"17. The position that emerges from the amended provisions of\n Order 23, can be summed up thus :\n\n (i) No appeal is maintainable against a consent decree having regard\n to the specific bar contained in \nsection 96(3)\n CPC.\n\n (ii) No appeal is maintainable against the order of the court\n recording the compromise (or refusing to record a compromise) in\n view of the deletion of clause (m) Rule 1 Order 43.\n\n (iii) No independent suit can be filed for setting aside a compromise\n decree on the ground that the compromise was not lawful in view of\n the bar contained in Rule 3A.\n\n (iv) A consent decree operates as an estoppel and is valid and\n\n Page 20 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n binding unless it is set aside by the court which passed the consent\n decree, by an order on an application under the proviso to Rule 3 of\n Order 23.\n\n Therefore, the only remedy available to a party to a consent decree\n to avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which\n recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and\n establish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court\n which recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the\n question as to whether there was a valid compromise or not. This is\n so because a consent decree, is nothing but contract between\n parties superimposed with the seal of approval of the court. The\n validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the\n agreement or compromise on which it is made. The second\n defendant, who challenged the consent compromise decree was\n fully aware of this position as she filed an application for setting\n aside the consent decree on 21.8.2001 by alleging that there was no\n valid compromise in accordance with law. Significantly, none of the\n other defendants challenged the consent decree. For reasons best\n known to herself, the second defendant within a few days thereafter\n (that is on 27.8.2001), filed an appeal and chose not to pursue the\n application filed before the court which passed the consent decree.\n Such an appeal by second defendant was not maintainable, having\n regard to the express bar contained in \nsection 96 (3)\n of the Code.\"\n\n 23. It has been held that the only remedy available to a party to a\n consent decree to avoid such consent decree is to approach the\n Court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms\n of it and establish that there was no compromise. Therefore, the bar\n is to a party to a consent decree and the remedy available to the\n party is to approach the Court which recorded the compromise;\n however\n, \nthe said judgment\n, did not deal with the right of a third\n party who was neither a party to the agreement nor the suit nor the\n consent decree. The said judgment, therefore, would not apply to\n the facts of the present case.\n\n 24. It is noteworthy that it is not in dispute that there is an\n Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 in favour of the applicant\n which, as is by now well settled would not create or invest any right\n in favour of the applicant. When there is no right invested, simply\n because the order which has been passed as a result of the\n compromise decree, is not the liking of the applicant, would not\n make a person aggrieved, much less any appealable right in his\n\n Page 21 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n favour.\n\n 25. Besides, the applicant has also filed Special Civil Suit no.299\n of 2023 seeking specific performance and is pending.
