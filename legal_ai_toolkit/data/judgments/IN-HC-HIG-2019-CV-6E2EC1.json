Respondents\n======================================================\nAppearance :\nFor the Petitioner/s : Mr. Sanjay Kumar, Advocate\nMr. Jay Prakash Singh, Advocate\nFor the Respondents : Mr. Manish Kumar, Advocate.\n======================================================\nCORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SHIVAJI PANDEY\nORAL JUDGMENT\nDate : 27-02-2019\n\nHeard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n2. The petitioners are daily wage employees, making\n\na prayer for quashing the orders contained in memo nos. 569\n\ndated 28.01.2011, memo no.519 dated 19.01.2011, memo\n\nno.419 dated 26.10.2010, memo no.517 dated 19.01.2011 and\n\nmemo no.538 dated 22.01.2011, which have been passed in\n\npursuance of the order passed in different writ petition viz.\n\nC.W.J.C. No.17234 of 2011, 17474 of 2010, 11032 of 1998 and\n\nother analogous cases as well as C.W.J.C. No. 17315 of 2010,\n\n4171 of 1999 and other analogous cases, thereby the\n\nrepresentations of the petitioners have been rejected.\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n5/45\n\n3. The short facts of this case are that the petitioners\n\nwere appointed as daily wage employees in the Bihar School\n\nExamination Board and they have continued to discharge their\n\nduties, but a decision was taken vide Annexure-6 to terminate\n\nthe services of all daily wages employees and in pursuance\n\nthereof, the petitioners along with other daily wager employees\n\nwere terminated with effect from 21.07.1989. Whereafter, an\n\nadvertisement dated 14.09.1989 was published for recruitment\n\nand appointment of class-III and IV posts, which was\n\nchallenged by the petitioners in C.W.J.C. No.8440 of 1989, but\n\nthis Court had refused to grant the benefit and directed the\n\nBoard to accept their application provisionally with the\n\ncondition that the petitioners would produce their requisition\n\ncertificate within the employment exchange within a fortnight\n\nfrom the date of passing of the order. While disposing of the\n\nwrit petition, the Court had directed the respondents to grant\n\nrelaxation of age with respect to the eligibility of their\n\nappearance in the said examination. In pursuance thereof, the\n\nexamination was conducted, in which the petitioners and others\n\nhave appeared, they were declared successful along with others,\n\nbut the authority did not grant any appointment letter to Class-\n\nIII and IV employees, which compelled them to approach this\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n6/45\n\nCourt in C.W.J.C. No. 750 of 1999 and other analogous cases,\n\nin which they have taken a plea that though the advertisement\n\nwas published for appointment of Class-III and IV employees,\n\nat the same time, the selection process for appointment of\n\nDrivers and Stenos was also started. After the result, the Stenos\n\nand Drivers were appointed by the Board, but the petitioners\n\nwere not appointed. The Court has considered the matter in the\n\nlight of the report submitted by the Committee constituted by\n\nthe Court. The said Committee gave its finding that the work of\n\nthe Board has decreased as well as the Bihar Intermediate\n\nCouncil has already been abolished and their employees has to\n\nbe adjusted in the Board, additionally recorded that the Board is\n\nsuffering from over-staffs and as such, the question of granting\n\nthe appointment letter to the selected candidates of Class III and\n\nIV does not arise and finally the Court has refused to issue the\n\nmandamus. It will be useful to quote relevant paragraphs of the\n\nsaid judgment, which are as follows:-\n\n\"To put the record the record straight, it may\nbe pointed out here that this decision of the\nBoard has been termed as statutory in nature\nby one of the Counsels, but how, has not been\nexplained at all and fall out of this submission\nto the ultimate prayer made by the petitioners.\nAs observed earlier, the aforesaid decision of\nthe Board is not to make appointment but to\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n7/45\n\nprepare separate merit list for daily wages\ncandidates, which the Board later on changed\non consideration of the relevant facts. We do\nnot find any substance in the submission of the\nlearned counsel.\nIt has also been contended that once the Board\nhas published the advertisement, the same has\nto be taken to its logical end; meaning thereby\nthat it must culminate in appointment. In\nsupport of the aforesaid decision, reliance has\nbeen placed on a Bench decision of this Court\nin the case of Rajendra Sharma v. Bihar State\nElectricity Board [2008(1) PLJR 679] and our\nattention has been drawn to paragraph 6 of the\njudgment, which reads s follows:-\n\"6. Once an employment notice has\nbeen published, the same should be\npursued unless the same had been\nissued erroneously or in violation of any\nrule governing the same. If the notice is\nresponded by one, there is no just reason\nnot to proceed with the selection\npursuant to the notice, unless it is held\nthat the others have been prevented from\nresponding to the notice. Because others\ndid not have the qualification fixed in\nthe notice that is no ground for\ncancellation of the notice.\"\nWe do not find any substance in this submission\nand the decision relied on has no application in\nthe facts of the present case. Here in the\npresent case, after the advertisement was\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n8/45\n\nmade, respondent-Board proceeded with the\nselection process. Advertisement to fill up the\npost is in invitation to qualified persons to\napply for recruitment. Board later on for bona\nfide and appropriate reasons decided not to fill\nup the posts. It is well settled that an employer\non valid grounds can refuse to make\nappointment, even if the vacancy exists. Here,\nthe reasons assigned by the respondents for not\nfilling up the posts have been found to be bona\nfide and hence refusal to appoint the\npetitioners cannot be said to be illegal.\nIt has lastly been contended that when this\nCourt directed to publish the result of the\ncandidates, who have appeared in the\nexamination, it would mean that this Court\nintended to direct the respondent-Board to\nmake appointment. We cannot read in the order\nof this court what has not been stated while\ndisposing of the writ application. It is relevant\nto state here that this Court directed the\nrespondent-Board to publish the result of the\ntest as the Board instead of publishing the\nresult has come out with a fresh advertisement.\nIssuance of fresh advertisement implies that the\nBoard needed to fill up the posts. In the\nbackground of the fact that there was no\ncomplaint in regard to the conduct of the\nexamination and further in the face of fresh\nadvertisement having been published to fill up\nthe vacancies, this Court directed the\nrespondent-Board to publish the result. The\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n9/45\n\ndirection to publish the result, in our opinion,\nwould not mean that they have to be appointed.\nAccordingly, we reject this contention of the\npetitioners.\nTo put the record straight, it is worth\nmentioning here that many of the daily wages\nemployees of the Board, who have been\ndeclared successful in the examination, have\nfiled writ applications separately and also\nintervened in some of the writ applications,\ninter alia, contending that they have the first\npreference in the appointment. As we have\ndeclined to issue mandamus for appointment,\nwe do not consider it expedient to adjudicate\nthis inter se dispute between the daily wages\nemployees and the petitioners, who have been\nselected for appointment.\"\n\n4. This order of the Division Bench was tested before\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)\n\nNos-22913-22916 of 2008 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\n\nrefused to interfere with the order and the matter stands\n\nconcluded by the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\nWhereafter, the petitioners were appointed as daily wage\n\nemployees and after that on receipt of the order from the State\n\nGovernment, the services of the daily wage employees\n\nincluding the present petitioners have been dispensed with effect\n\nfrom 16.10.1996. In view of the memorandum issued by\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n10/45\n\nthe State Government dated 16.03.2006, the petitioners filed\n\nrepresentation for regularization, but the Board did not take\n\ncognizance, which compelled the petitioners to file different\n\nwrit petitions before this Court. The said writ petitions were\n\ndisposed of with a direction to the respondents to examine the\n\ncase of the petitioners and take decision in accordance with law.\n\nUltimately, by the impugned order, the representations of the\n\npetitioners having been rejected, which is under consideration\n\nbefore this Court.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n\nimpugned orders are suffering from illegality as while rejecting\n\nthe representations of the petitioners, two grounds have been\n\ntaken by the authority; first, while giving employment as daily\n\nwagers the Reservation Policy was not followed; Secondly, the\n\npersons named in the impugned order have already been\n\nterminated from the service 14 years earlier and the\n\nengagement of these petitioners right from the beginning was\n\nnot legal, hence, the claim of regularization having been\n\nrejected. He further submits that the application of Reservation\n\nPolicy for engagement as daily wagers does not apply as it was\n\nnot a regular employment, had there been a regular\n\nemployment, then the application of Reservation Policy would\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n11/45\n\nhave come into play.\n\n6. It has further been submitted by learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioners that in absence of any Rule and Regulations\n\nframed by the Bihar School Examination Board, the\n\nmemorandum dated 16.03.2006 would come into play and those\n\nwho have worked 240 days prior to 11.12.1990 are required to\n\nbe regularized in service. It has further been submitted that the\n\npetitioners had appeared in the examination and declared\n\nsuccessful, but they have not been appointed. It has further been\n\ncontended that the petitioners have continuously been\n\ndischarging their duties as daily wagers for a long period, which\n\nitself reflect that sufficient work is available for these\n\npetitioners, which was/is perennial in nature. Further submits\n\nthat if the impugned order suffers on a single ground, then the\n\nentire order would be bad.\n\n7. It has further been submitted that if the\n\nappointment is made without following the Reservation Policy,\n\nlater on, that appointment cannot be held to be illegal. In\n\nsupport of his submissions, learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nhas placed reliance on the decision of this Court rendered in the\n\ncase of Binay Kumar Singh & Anr. vs. State of Bihar and Ors.\n\nreported in 2001(4) PLJR 352.\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n12/45\n\n8. It has further been submitted that the averments\n\nmade by the Board in its counter affidavit that the Circular dated\n\n16.03.2006\n(Annexure-13) is not applicable, cannot be taken\n\ninto consideration in view of the fact that this is not the ground\n\nmentioned in the impugned order and further ground cannot be\n\nsupplemented through counter affidavit.\nIn support of his\n\nsubmissions, learned counsel for the petitioners has placed\n\nreliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered\n\nin the case of\nMohinder Singh Gill and Another vs. The Chief\n\nElection Commissioner, New Delhi and Ors.\nreported in A.I.R.\n\n1978 S.C. 851.\n\n9. It has further been submitted that the other\n\nsimilarly situated persons like Driver and Steno were appointed,\n\nso these petitioners should also be given the identical benefit,\n\nfor that, he has placed reliance on the decisions rendered in the\n\ncase of\nAmarkant Rai vs. State of Bihar and Others\nreported in\n\n(2015) 8 SCC 265 and in the case of\nPrem Ram vs. Managing\n\nDirector, Uttarakhand Pey Jal and Nirman Nigam, Dehradun\n\nand Others\nreported in (2015) 11 SCC 255.\n\n10. Learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn the\n\nattention of this Court to the order dated 30.03.2009 passed by\n\nthis Court in C.W.J.C. No.11032 of 1998, wherein the petitioner\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n13/45\n\nrelied upon a Government office order of the Human Resources\n\ndated 09.01.2009, in turn, the Court has held if the State\n\nGovernment has framed a Policy for regularization, quite\n\nnaturally which is required to be applied and as such, benefit of\n\nregularization should be extended to the petitioners. In\n\npursuance thereof, a Three Men Committee was constituted\n\n(Annexure-20), which itself reflects that the said Committee\n\ntook decision that if the Board will consider the issue of\n\nregularization in future then their matter will be considered also.\n\n11. Whereas, learned counsel for the Bihar School\n\nExamination Board has submitted the petitioners have already\n\nbeen terminated from the service in the year 1996 and\n\nwhereafter their services have never been taken by the Board in\n\nany manner, so the question of their regularization in service\n\ndoes not arise. He further submits that the question of\n\nregularization came for consideration in C.W.J.C. No.8440 of\n\n1989 [Bhavesh Jha vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.], but the Court\n\nhas out-rightly rejected the claim of the petitioner for\n\nregularization, but only granted certain benefits for the purposes\n\nof appearing in the recruitment test. It has further been\n\nsubmitted that after the repeal of the Intermediate Council, the\n\nemployees working in the Intermediate Council have been\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n14/45\n\nabsorbed in the Bihar School Examination Board, inasmuch,\n\nalready excess employees are working in the Board, so the\n\nquestion of regularization and appointment of these petitioners\n\nwas consciously decided and they have not been engaged.\n\n12. It has further been submitted that the petitioners\n\nhave already been terminated in the year 1996 and after long\n\nlapse of time, regularization cannot be offered to the petitioner.\n\nFurther submitted that the entry of the petitioners itself is\n\ncompletely illegal, so they have no right to claim for\n\nregularization.\nIn support of his submission, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioners has placed reliance on the decision rendered in\n\nthe case of\nRam Sevak Yadav & Anr. vs. State of Bihar and\n\nOrs.\nreported in 2013(1) PLJR 964 and in the case of\nNand\n\nKumar vs. State of Bihar and Ors.\nreported in (2014) 5 SCC\n\n300, wherein it has been held that regularization can only be\n\nclaimed when the employment is subsisting.\n\nHe further placed\n\nreliance on the decision rendered in the case of\nUpendra Singh\n\nvs. State of Bihar and Ors.\nreported in A.I.R. 2018 S.C. 1315,\n\nwherein the Court has decided that the regularization cannot be\n\ndone in the event of illegal appointment.\n\n13. Learned counsel for the Bihar School Examination\n\nBoard has further placed reliance on the decision rendered in the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n15/45\n\ncase of\nRita Mishra and Others vs. Director, Primary\n\nEducation, Bihar and Others\n, reported in AIR 1988 PATNA 26\n\nand submits that for issuance of writ of mandamus it is required\n\nthat there must be an existence of statutory or public duty\n\ndevolving upon the person or body against whom the said writ\n\npetition is directed. So, he submits that there is no public duty of\n\nthe Board to give regularization to these persons when their\n\nservices has already come to an end much earlier and at the\n\nsame time, the entry of the petitioners itself is bad and illegal,\n\nthey have to show that they have a corresponding right to get\n\nregularization in service. It has further been submitted that\n\nregularization is purely an executive function and the Court\n\ncannot give a direction for regularization of the employees\n\nworking therein.\n\nIn support of his submission, he placed\n\nreliance on\nUnion of India & Anr. vs. Ram Singh Thakur &\n\nOrs.\nreported in AIR 2012 SC (Supp) 436.\n\n14. After considering the argument of both the sides,\n\nthis Court has to decide whether these petitioners, who were\n\nearlier appointed as daily wagers, whereafter an advertisement\n\nwas published for recruitment of Class-IV employees\n\nsubstantively, which these petitioners challenged\n\nunsuccessfully, can be granted the relief of regularization or the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n16/45\n\nCourt should not interfere with the order of termination. The\n\nCourt had earlier granted the benefit of age relaxation, they\n\nappeared in the examination, declared successful, but\n\nultimately, the Board refused to appoint even a single person\n\nfrom his category, which has been approved by this Court in a\n\nwrit petition, in turn, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Later on,\n\nthe petitioners were engaged on daily wage basis, terminated\n\nfrom service in the year 1996. Now the question of\n\nregularization in service has come for consideration. Question\n\nof regularization in service can be considered when the person,\n\nwho is claiming regularization, is in service, when the person,\n\nwho is claiming regularization is no longer in service, has been\n\nterminated, unless the order of termination is set aside and the\n\nperson is declared in continuous in service, only in such a\n\nsituation, the relief for grant of regularization can be\n\nconsidered. So, first step, the entry of these petitioners as daily\n\nwagers must create some semblance of right to claim\n\nregularization in service, only in the next step the same may be\n\nconsidered. But, in the present case, subsequent engagement of\n\nthese petitioners does not satisfy the condition of proper\n\nprocedure followed for the selection and recruitment of class-\n\nIV employees. In the event of entry in service de hors to the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n17/45\n\nproper procedure does not create any right. Identical issue has\n\ncome for consideration from time to time, so it will be\n\nappropriate to deal with the judgments cited by the parties on\n\nthis point.\n\n15.\nIn the case of\nVinay Kumar Singh & Anr. vs.\n\nState of Bihar and Ors.\n(supra), the petitioners were appointed\n\nby the Divisional Establishment Committee after following the\n\nnormal procedure and their selection was made after due\n\nadvertisement and there was no allegation of plying fraud in the\n\nmatter of appointment nor there was any allegation of\n\nappointment on account of extraneous consideration. However,\n\nroster clearance was not observed and compliance of\n\nReservation Rules was also not observed and on that ground\n\nthe Court has arrived to a finding that the petitioners should not\n\nbe made to suffer after several years of appointment for the\n\nfault of the authorities in not observing these formalities and in\n\nany view of the matter, it cannot be a sufficient justification to\n\nterminate their services. So, in this case, it is very much clear\n\nthat the selection was made after due advertisement and all the\n\nformalities were followed save and except the Reservation\n\nPolicy, the Court has held that it will not be justify to terminate\n\ntheir services and accordingly, the Court interfered with the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n18/45\n\norder in favour of the petitioners.\n\n16. It will be relevant to quote paragraph no.7 of the\n\naforesaid judgment, which reads as under:-\n\n\"7. Prima facie, it appears that the petitioners were\nappointed by the Divisional Establishment Committee\nafter following the normal procedures and their\nselection was made after due advertisement. From the\nfacts enumerated in the writ applications and also in\nthe counter-affidavit, it appears that the petitioners\nare not alleged to have played any fraud in the matter\nof appointment nor it is alleged that appointments\nwere made on extraneous consideration. However, it\nappears that the roster clearances etc. are not said to\nhave been observed and compliance of reservation\nRules was also not observed. However, for these, the\npetitioners should not be made to suffer after several\nyears of appointment for the fault of the authorities in\nnot observing these formalities and in any view of the\nmatter, it cannot be a sufficient justification to\nterminate their services.\"\n\n17.\nIn the case of\nSatya Prakash and Ors. vs. State of\n\nBihar and Others\nreported in (2010) 4 SCC 179, daily-rated\n\nemployees of the Bihar Intermediate Education Council, had\n\napproached the Court taking plea that they had worked for\n\nmore than 10 years on daily-rated basis, claimed for\n\nregularization of their services. The Division Bench of this\n\nCourt has taken a view that mere because they had worked as\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n19/45\n\ndaily-wage employees with the Council would not confer any\n\nright for regularization as no public appointment is permissible\n\nde hors the recruitment rules, as such every person has equal\n\nright over the same as it is a public property.\n\nThe matter went\n\nto the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nhas considered several judgments especially the decision\n\nrendered in the case of\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\nreported\n\nin (2006) 4 SCC 1 and held that the employees are not entitled\n\nto get the benefit of regularization of their services since they\n\nwere never appointed on any sanctioned posts rather they were\n\nonly engaged as daily wage employees in the Bihar\n\nIntermediate Education Council. The Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nhas made a distinction between irregular and illegal\n\nappointment, illegal appointment does not confer any right of\n\nany nature to the Government servant and after considering the\n\ndifferent judgments it has been held that there is a clear\n\ndistinction between the illegal and irregular employment,\n\npersons who have been appointed wrongly in the sense non-\n\ncompliance of certain procedure, which does not go to the root\n\nof the selection process, is irregular and those does not fall in\n\nthat category rather failure of observe procedure goes to the\n\nroot of the matter will be treated to be an illegal appointment.\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n20/45\n\nThe illegal appointment cannot be regularized. The status of\n\nsuch appointment is nothing, but a back door entry, which\n\ncannot be in any manner said to be a valid appointment.\n\n18. It will be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 7 and 14\n\nof\nthe said judgment\n, which read as under:-\n\n\"7. We are of the view that the appellants are\nnot entitled to get the benefit of regularization\nof their services since they were never\nappointed in any sanctioned posts. The\nAppellants were only engaged on daily wages\nin the Bihar Intermediate Education Council.\n\n14. Allowing the appeal preferred by the\nCommercial Taxes Department, this Court set\naside the directions given by the High Court for\nregularization of services of those daily wage\nemployees who had more than 10 years of\nservice. The Court held as follows:-\n\n\"We are, therefore, of the view that, at\nbest, the Division Bench of the High\nCourt should have directed that wages\nequal to the salary that is being paid to\nregular employees be paid to these daily\nwage employees with effect from the date\nof its judgment. Hence, that part of the\ndirection of the Division Bench is\nmodified and it is directed that these\ndaily-wage earners be paid wages equal\nto the salary at the lowest grade of\nemployees of their cadre in the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n21/45\n\nCommercial Taxes Department in\nGovernment service, from the date of the\njudgment of the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court. Since, they are only daily\nwage earners, there would be no\nquestion of other allowances being paid\nto them. In view of our conclusion, that\nthe Courts are not expected to issue\ndirections for making such persons\npermanent in service, we set aside that\npart of the direction of the High Court\ndirecting the Government to consider\ntheir cases for regularization. We also\nnotice that the High Court has not\nadverted to the aspect as to whether it\nwas regularization or it was giving\npermanency that was being directed by\nthe High Court. In such a situation, the\ndirection in that regard will stand deleted\nand the appeals filed by the State would\nstand allowed to that extent. If\nsanctioned posts are vacant (they are\nsaid to be vacant) the State will take\nimmediate steps for filling those posts by\na regular process of selection. But when\nregular recruitment is undertaken, the\nrespondents in Civil Appeal No. 3595-\n612 and those in Commercial Tax\nDepartments similarly situated will be\nallowed to compete, waiving the age\nrestriction imposed for the recruitment\nand giving some weightage for their\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n22/45\n\nhaving been engaged for work in the\nDepartment for a significant period of\ntime. (Emphasis supplied)\n\n19. Same issue came for consideration before the Full\n\nBench of this Court in the case of\nRam Sevak Yadav & Anr. vs.\n\nState of Bihar and Ors.\n(supra), wherein the Full Bench after\n\nconsidering large number of judgments of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, conclusively arrived to a finding that\nUma\n\nDevi\ncase (supra) prohibits regularization of daily wage,\n\ncasual, adh-hoc and temporary appointments and the period of\n\nservice being irrelevant. An illegal appointment is void ab initio\n\nas made contrary to the mandate of\nArticle 14\nwithout open\n\ncompetitive selection cannot be regularized under any\n\ncircumstances. Irregular appointments can be regularized if the\n\nappointment was made by an authority competent to do so, it\n\nwas made on a vacant sanctioned post in accordance with\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India with equal opportunity\n\nfor participation of eligible candidates by competitive selection\n\nand the candidates must possess the eligibility qualifications for\n\na regular appointment to the post. The appointment must not\n\nhave been doled out to the appointee alone and the person must\n\nhave continued in service over ten years without intervention of\n\nany courts' order.\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n23/45\n\n20. It will be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 41 and\n\n43 of\nthe said judgment\n, which are as follows:-\n\n\"41. The public power to make appointment on\npublic posts is conferred for public good. The\npower is given to the officer concerned by the\nGovernment in trust, that it shall be used and\nnot abused. If the trust is belied, the protection\nconferred upon a Government servant stands\ndenuded. The answerability and accountability\nis then individual of the officer. The\nGovernment is duty bound to take appropriate\ncivil/ criminal action against the officer. The\nillegality in the appointment is not a one way\nstreet. If there was someone willing to pay a\nprice for the job, there was another waiting to\ntake advantage of the same by fixing a price. It\nis not without reason that majority of such\nappointments relate to class III and IV posts.\nThe standard by which the Government\nprofesses to act is the same standard by which\nits actions shall be judged. Therefore whenever\nthe Government terminates an appointment\nbeing illegal, it is the constitutional duty of the\nGovernment to simultaneously take action\nagainst the officials who belied the trust of the\ngovernment. Those who made hay while the\nsun shined must see the darker cloudy days\nalso.\nIn 1995(2) PLJR 573(DB) (\nBimal Kishore\nRai v. State of Bihar\n) it was directed :\n\n\"16. In cases where an appointment is\nfound to have been illegally made, the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n24/45\n\ncourts quash the appointment and,\ntherefore the appointee suffers the\nconsequence. However, the real guilty\nperson, namely, the appointing authority\ndoes scot free. The result is that even\nthough large number of such\nappointments have been quashed by the\ncourts, the appointing authorities have\nshowed total indifference to the orders\npassed by the courts, and they continue\nto make such appointments. It is a well-\nknown fact, so far as this state is\nconcerned, that appointment in majority\nof cases has to be bought. The ordinary\ncitizen who has concern for the law and\nmorality, must suffer, even if in terms of\ncapability and merit he is far superior to\nthe unscrupulous ones, who managed the\nappointments. We have, therefore, felt the\nneed to issue some directions in this\nregard, so that the appointing\nauthorities, who are primarily guilty in\nsuch matters, and who exploit the\njobseekers taking advantage of their\nhardship, are equally punished when\nsuch illegal appointments are brought to\nthe notice of the Government. I, therefore\ndirect that in each and every case where\nan appointment is said to have been\nillegally made, in the sense that the rules\ngoverning the appointment have not been\nfollowed, and the appointment is made\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n25/45\n\nby flouting the law in such a manner that\nthe motive of the appointing authority\nbecomes suspect, simultaneously with the\ncancellation of such illegal appointment,\naction must be initiated against the\nappointing authority, and in appropriate\ncases they should be immediately\nsuspended pending departmental\nproceedings. If such action is not taken,\ncourts will doubt the genuineness of the\nreason shown by the government for\ncancellation of such appointment. I direct\nthat this should be complied with by the\nGovernment in each and every case\nwhere an appointment is sought to be\ncancelled on the ground that it was\nillegally made in circumstances which\ngive rise to a suspicion that the\nappointment was made on extraneous\nconsideration, including money.\"\n\n43. We therefore sum up our conclusions and\nanswer the reference as follows :-\n\nA) Uma Devi\n(supra) prohibits regularisation of\ndaily wage, casual, ad-hoc and temporary\nappointments, the period of service being\nirrelevant;\n\nB) An illegal appointment void ab-initio made\ncontrary to the mandate of\nArticle 14\nwithout\nopen competitive selection cannot be\nregularised under any circumstances.\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n26/45\n\nC) Irregular appointments can be regularised if\nthe appointment was made by an authority\ncompetent to do so, it was made on a vacant\nsanctioned post, in accordance with\nArticle 14\n\nof the Constitution with equal opportunity for\nparticipation to others eligible by competitive\nselection and the candidate possessed the\neligibility qualifications for a regular\nappointment to the post.\n\nD) The appointment must not have been an\nindividual favour doled out to the appointee\nalone and the person must have continued in\nservice for over ten years without intervention\nof any court orders.\n\n21.\nIn the case of\nNand Kumar vs. State of Bihar and\n\nOthers\n. (supra) also the question of regularization of service of\n\ndaily wager or casual workers, who were not appointed through\n\nproper procedure, came for consideration before the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, wherein it has been held that they were not\n\nappointed properly in strict sense following the procedure of\n\nthe appointment and as such, cannot claim any right over the\n\npost. The appointment on daily wage basis is not a mode of\n\nappointment strictly in accordance with law and does not\n\nconfer any right to claim equivalence as that of the regular\n\nappointed Government employee. The status of daily wagers\n\nand the regular employees is not comparable and any\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n27/45\n\nappointment dehors to the procedure does not create any\n\nsemblance of right for regularization.\n\n22. It will be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 23 to 25\n\nof\nthe said judgment\n, which are as follows:-\n\n\"23. We have heard learned counsel for the\nparties. We have also perused the records\nplaced before us. We find that the status of the\nappellants was continuing to be as daily\nwagers. They cannot be treated as permanent\nGovernment employees. They all worked as\nemployees of the Board. We have also found\nthat no steps were followed by the Board to\nsafeguard the service of these appellants. We\nhave not been able to find out whether any\nadvertisement was issued by the Government to\nregularise them. In these circumstances, in\nview of the submission which has been\nadvanced on behalf of the appellants, we do\nnot find that there is any substance in the\nmatter/arguments put forwarded before us on\nbehalf of the appellants as we have been able\nto find out that the appellants have served as\ndaily wagers and we do find that Section 6(i)\nmakes it clear that after the repeal of the\nAgriculture Produce Act, 1960, all officers and\nemployees of the Board are to continue in\nemployment and they shall continue to be paid\nwhat they were getting earlier as salary and\nallowance till such time the State Government\ntakes an official decision as per the further\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n28/45\n\nprovisions of Section 6. Such provision\ncertainly allows continuance of the officers and\nemployees of the Board to continue in\nemployment in the same status. The status of\nthe daily wage employees and regular\nemployees of the Board is eminent from the\nsaid provision. It cannot be said that the status\nof the daily wage employees can enjoy or\nacquire the same status as that of the regular\nemployees. In these circumstances, we do not\nfind that there was any discrimination between\nthe daily wage employees and the regular\nemployees as is tried to be contended before us.\nTherefore, such submission has no substance,\nin our opinion, for the reason that the\ndifference continues and is recognised under\nthe said provision of the Repeal Act. So far as\nthe power of the Committee of Secretaries\nconstituted in terms of Section 6(ii) of the\nRepeal Act is concerned, it is to prepare a\nscheme of absorption as well as of retirement,\ncompulsory retirement or voluntary retirement\nand other service conditions of officers and\nemployees of the Board. In our opinion, the\nscheme which was prepared by the Committee\nof Secretaries is only in the nature of\nrecommendation and the State has the power\neither to accept, modify or amend the same\nbefore granting its official approval. Therefore,\nafter the sanction is granted by the\nGovernment in respect of the said scheme, it\nwould gain the status of statutory scheme\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n29/45\n\nframed under the said Act and would be\nenforced within the time to be indicated in\nsection 6(iii) of the Repeal Act, 2006.\n\n24. Therefore, in the light of the said provision,\nwe do not find that the Committee of Secretaries\ncan be faulted in treating the daily wage\nemployees on a different footing and deciding\nfor removal of their services.\n\n25. We have consciously noted the aforesaid\ndecisions of this Court. The principle as has\nbeen\nlaid down in\n\nUmadevi\n(supra) has also\nbeen applied in relation to the persons who\nwere working on daily wages. According to us,\nthe daily wagers are not appointees in the strict\nsense of the term 'appointment'. They do not\nhold a post. The scheme of alternative\nappointment framed for regular employees of\nabolished organisation cannot, therefore, confer\na similar entitlement on the daily wagers of\nabolished organisation to such alternative\nemployment.\n[See Avas Vikas Sansthan v.\n\nEngineers Assn.]. Their relevance in the context\nof appointment arose by reason of the concept\nof regularisation as a source of appointment.\n\nAfter Umadevi\n(supra), their position continued\nto be that of daily wagers. Appointment on daily\nwage basis is not an appointment to a post\naccording to the rules. Usually, the projects in\nwhich the daily wagers were engaged, having\ncome to an end, their appointment is necessarily\nterminated for want of work. Therefore, the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n30/45\n\nstatus and rights of daily wagers of a\nGovernment concern are not equivalent to that\nof a Government servant and his claim to\npermanency has to be adjudged differently.\"\n\n23.\nIn the case of\nAmarkant Rai vs. State of Bihar\n\nand Others\n(supra), the petitioner was appointed in Class-IV\n\npost by the Principal of the College, who was not competent\n\nauthority to make such appointment. The University took a\n\ndecision to regularize the person who had worked for 240 days\n\nand thereafter the Additional Commission-cum- Secretary,\n\nBihar, passed a settlement dated 11.07.1989 and forwarded a\n\ncopy of the same to the Vice Chancellors of the Universities,\n\nwherein it was stated that the services of employees working in\n\neducational institutions as per the staffing pattern, can be\n\nregularized, further imposing a condition that new\n\nappointments against the vacancies present and in future should\n\nnot at all be done. The Principal of the College wrote a letter to\n\nthe Registrar of the University to regularize the services of\n\nAmarkant Rai, an employee of the college, but the Registrar\n\nterminated the services of Amarkant Rai, which came for\n\nconsideration before this Court. As per direction of this Court,\n\nthe Registrar of the Universities allowed Amarkant Rai to join\n\nthe services. Accordingly, he joined his duty and whereafter\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n31/45\n\nrecommendation was given for absorption against the vacant\n\npost, but the same was rejected as the same was not as per\n\nrecruitment Rule. The action of University was challenged\n\nbefore this Court unsuccessfully, the matter went to the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court, the Hon'ble Supreme Court finally\n\nplacing reliance on several judgments has held that there is no\n\nmaterial to show that Amarkant Rai was lacking any\n\nqualification or bore any blemish record during his\n\nemployment for over two decades. Similarly situated person,\n\nwho was also appointed on daily wages on the post of clerk,\n\nwas regularized and there was no material to show that any\n\nother persons was working against the sanctioned post of Night\n\nGuard, accordingly, direction was given to regualarize the\n\nservice of Amarkkant Rai on the score of length of service of\n\nmore than 29 years.\n\n24. It will be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 13 and\n\n14 of\nthe said judgment\n, which read as under:-\n\n\"13. In our view, the exception carved out in\npara 53 of Umadevi (3) is applicable to the\nfacts of the present case. There is no material\nplaced on record by the respondents that the\nappellant has been lacking any qualification or\nbore any blemish record during his\nemployment for over two decades. It is\npertinent to note that services of similarly\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n32/45\n\nsituated persons on daily wages for\nregularization viz. one Yatindra Kumar Mishra\nwho was appointed on daily wages on the post\nof Clerk was regularized w.e.f. 1987. The\nappellant although initially working against\nunsanctioned post, the appellant was working\ncontinuously since 03.1.2002 against\nsanctioned post. Since there is no material\nplaced on record regarding the details whether\nany other night guard was appointed against\nthe sanctioned post, in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, we are inclined to\naward monetary benefits to be paid from\n01.01.2010.\n\n14. Considering the facts and circumstances of\nthe case that the appellant has served the\nUniversity for more than 29 years on the post of\nNight Guard and that he has served the College\non daily wages, in the interest of justice, the\nauthorities are directed to regularize the\nservices of the appellant retrospectively w.e.f.\n03.01.2002 (the date on which he rejoined the\npost as per direction of Registrar).\"\n\n25.\nIn the case of\nPrem Ram vs. Managing Director,\n\nUttarakhand Pey Jal and Nirman Nigam, Dehradun and\n\nOthers\n(supra), the juniors were regularized in service leaving\n\nthe seniors in high and dry and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\n\ngiven direction for regularization of service of Prem Ram from\n\nthe date the juniors to him were regularized in service and also\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n33/45\n\ndirected to pay all retiral benefits by treating him to be in\n\ncontinuous service till the date of his superannuation. It will be\n\nrelevant to quote paragraph nos. 9 and 10 of\nthe said judgment\n,\n\nwhich are as follows:-\n\n\"9. From the affidavits it is further evident that\nfive persons named by the appellant appearing\nat serials no.78 to 82 of the list of juniors have\nbeen regularized in service. It is not in dispute\nthat all these persons were appointed on dates\nsubsequent to the date of appointment of the\nappellant. The respondent, however, has\nattempted to justify the regularization of\njuniors mentioned above on the ground that\nthey had been appointed in work-charge\nestablishment whereas the appellant herein was\na daily-wager. We asked learned counsel for\nthe respondent as to whether daily-wagers on\nthe basis of their seniority or otherwise were\nbrought on to the work-charged establishment\nand if there was no such practice or procedure\nfollowed, what was the basis on which the\ndepartment would decide whether the person\nhas to be engaged on a work-charged\nestablishment or as a daily-wager. We\nmust regretfully say that we did not get a\nsatisfactory answer to that question nor do any\nof the several affidavits filed in these\nproceedings by the respondent- Jal Nigam\npoint out a qualitative difference between\ndaily-wager on the one hand and a temporary\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n34/45\n\nengagement on work-charged establishment on\nthe other. If engagement in a work- charged\nestablishment rest on a criterion, no better than\nthe absolute discretion of the authority\nengaging them or the fortuitous circumstances\nof a vacancy or need in a work-charged\nestablishment, then, there is indeed no\ndifference between a daily-wager on the one\nhand and work-charged employees on the\nother. No distinction can resultantly be made\nbetween these two categories of employees for\nin essence, the nature of their engagement\nremains the same except that in the case of\nwork-charged employees, the\nwages/emoluments appear to be borne from out\nof the allocation for the project in which they\nare employed while in the other case there is no\nsuch specific allocation of funds. The\nclassification of work- charged and other\nemployees to say the least remains wholly\nunsatisfactory at least for the purposes of the\ncase in hand leaving no option for us but to\ntreat the case of the daily-wagers and work-\ncharge employees on the same footing when it\ncomes to granting regularization to them.\n\n10. If that be so, there is no denying the fact\nthat the persons who were junior to the\nappellant, having been engaged much later than\nhim, steal a march over him in terms of\nregularization in service while the appellant\nremained embroiled in litigation over what was\neventually found to be an illegal termination of\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n35/45\n\nhis service. It is true that the appellant has\nalready superannuated. That does not, however,\nmake any difference. What is important is that\nthe appellant had been appointed as early as in\nthe year 1988 and had. by the time the decision\nof this Court in Umadevi's (3) case (supra)\npronounced, already completed more than 10\nyears service. Government has formulated rules\nfor regularization of such daily-wagers, no\nmatter the same are the subject matter of a\nchallenge before the High Court. What is\nnoteworthy is that neither the State Government\nnor the Jal Nigam has resented the idea of\nregularization of those who have served for over\na decade. The rules providing for regularization\nare a sufficient enough indication of that fact.\nWe do not, therefore, see any impediment in\ndirecting regularization of the services of the\nappellant on the analogy of his juniors with\neffect from the date his juniors were regularized\nand for the release of all retiral benefits in his\nfavour on that basis by treating him to be in\ncontinuous service till the date of his\nsuperannuation. We make it clear that this\ndirection will not entitle the appellant to claim\nany amount towards arrears of salary based on\nsuch regularization.\"\n\n26.\nIn the case of\nUpendra Singh vs. State of Bihar\n\nand Ors.\n(supra), the question of regularization came for\n\nconsideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, having found\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n36/45\n\nthat the appointment has been made by incompetent authority\n\nwithout advertisement not on the sanctioned post, accordingly,\n\nit has been held that Upendra Singh is not entitled to relief of\n\nregularization in service and approved the judgment of\nRam\n\nSevak Yadav\n(supra). It will be useful to quote paragraph no.7\n\nand relevant portion of paragraph no.8 of\nthe said judgment\n,\n\nwhich read as under:-\n\n\"7. After considering the respective arguments,\nwe are of the view that the impugned judgment\nis without any blemish and no interference is\ncalled for. In fact, whole premise on which the\ncase is founded by the appellant seems to be\nincorrect. We note that the cases of these\npersons, including the appellant, were duly\nconsidered by the University, on the basis of\nwhich order dated August 13, 2003 were\npassed refusing regularisation. This order\nspecifically states that the initial appointment\nof the appellant and others was not in\naccordance with law. It was made without\nadvertisement and there was no\nrecommendation of panel by the Selection\nCommittee. So much so, the appointments were\nnot made by the competent authority. We find\nthat the University, or for that matter, the\nGovernment had agreed to regularise the\nservices of those employees of the colleges,\nwhich had become the Constituent Colleges,\nonly on the condition that their initial\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n37/45\n\nappointment was after following the due\nprocedure and that too against the sanctioned\npost. A statement was made at the Bar by\nlearned counsel for the respondent that there\nwere no sanctioned posts even now.\n\n8. Law pertaining to regularisation has now\nbeen authoritatively determined by a\nConstitution Bench judgment of this Court in\n\nSecretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v.\nUmadevi & Ors.\n, (2006) 4 SCC 1: (AIR 2006\nS.C. 1806). On the application of law\nlaid down\nin\nthat case, it is clear that the question of\nregularisation of daily wager appointed\ncontrary to law does not arise. This ratio of the\njudgment could not be disputed by the learned\ncounsel for the appellant as well. That is why\nshe continued to plead that the appointment of\nthe appellant was made after following due\nprocedure and in accordance with law.\nHowever, that is not borne from the records.\nPertinently, order dated August 13, 2003, vide\nwhich the appellant was refused regularisation\non the aforesaid ground was not even assailed\nby the appellant at that time. It may be\nmentioned that in Uma Devi, the Court left a\nsmall window opened for those who were\nworking on ad hoc/ daily wage basis for more\nthan ten years, to regularise them as a one-time\nmeasure. However, that was also subject to the\ncondition that they should have been appointed\nin duly sanctioned post...\"\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n38/45\n\n27.\nIn the case of\nState of Bihar and Ors. Vs. Kirti\n\nNarayan Prasad\nreported in 2019 (1) PLJR 102 (S.C.), also\n\nthe question of proper entry in the service came for\n\nconsideration. The court has held that in case of illegal\n\nappointment, the question of regularization of service does not\n\narise. If the appointment is bad at the initial stage, cannot be\n\nsanctified at a later stage. It will be relevant to quote paragraph\n\nno.16 and 17 of\nthe said judgment\n, which read as under:-\n\n\"16.\nIn\nState of Orissa and Anr. v. Mamata\nMohanty\n, (2011) 3 SCC 436, this Court has\nheld that once an order of appointment itself\nhad been bad at the time of initial appointment,\nit cannot be sanctified at a later stage. It was\nheld thus: \"68(i) The procedure prescribed\nunder the 1974 Rules has not been followed in\nall the cases while making the appointment of\nthe respondents/ teachers at initial stage. Some\nof the persons had admittedly been appointed\nmerely by putting some note on the notice\nboard of the College. Some of these teachers\ndid not face the interview test before the\nSelection Board. Once an order of appointment\nitself had been bad at 15 the time of initial\nappointment, it cannot be sanctified at a later\nstage.\n\n17. In the instant cases the writ petitioners have\nfiled the petitions before the High Court with a\nspecific prayer to regularize their service and to\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n39/45\n\nset aside the order of termination of their\nservices. They have also challenged the report\nsubmitted by the State Committee. The real\ncontroversy is whether the writ petitioners were\nlegally and validly appointed. The finding of the\nState Committee is that many writ petitioners\nhad secured appointment by producing fake or\nforged appointment letter or had been inducted\nin Government service surreptitiously by\nconcerned Civil Surgeon-cum-Chief Medical\nOfficer by issuing a posting order. The writ\npetitioners are the beneficiaries of illegal orders\nmade by the Civil Surgeon-cum-Chief Medical\nOfficer. They were given notice to establish the\ngenuineness of their appointment and to show\ncause. None of them could establish the\ngenuineness or legality of their appointment\nbefore the State Committee. The State\nCommittee on appreciation of the materials on\nrecord has opined that their appointment was\nillegal and void ab initio. We do not find any\nground to disagree with the finding of the State\nCommittee.\nIn the circumstances, the question of\nregularisation of their services by invoking para\n53 of the judgment in\nUmadevi\n(supra) does not\narise. Since the appointment of the petitioners is\nab initio void, they cannot be said to be the civil\nservants of the State. Therefore, holding\ndisciplinary proceedings envisaged by\nArticle\nof the Constitution or under any other\ndisciplinary rules shall not arise.\"\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n40/45\n\n28.\nIn view of the aforesaid discussions, it is very\n\nmuch clear that the person, who is working as daily wager does\n\nnot hold a post that too in an event when the engagement has\n\nnot been made after following the proper procedure, hence, the\n\nquestion of regularization does not arise, inasmuch as, in the\n\ncase of\nUnion of India & Anr. vs. Ram Singh Thakur & Ors.\n\n(supra), it has been held that direction regarding regularization\n\nin service is a purely an executive function and such a direction\n\ncannot validly be given by the judiciary. It is also very much\n\nclear that mandamus can be issued when there is a public duty\n\ndevolving upon the person or the body against whom the said\n\nwrit is said to be directed and along with this there must co-\n\nexist a corresponding right in the persns who were entitled to\n\nclaim the enforcement of the said statutory public duty. Unless\n\nthese two pre-conditions are satisfied, the requisite foundation\n\nfor the issuance of a writ of mandamus can hardly be said to\n\nexist.\n\nReliance can be placed on the decision rendered in the\n\ncase of\nRita Mishra and Others vs. Director, Primary\n\nEducation, Bihar and Others\n(supra).\n\n29. It will be relevant to quote paragraph nos. 26 and\n\n27 of\nthe said judgment\n, which are as follows:-\n\n\"26. It is evident from the authoritative\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n41/45\n\nexposition of the law that the sine qua non for\nthe issuance of a writ of mandamus is the\nexistence of a statutory or a public duty\ndevolving upon the person or the body against\nwhom or which the said writ is directed.\nEqually settled it is that along with this must\nco-exist a corresponding right in the petitioners\nwho were entitled to claim the enforcement of\nthe said statutory public duty. Unless these two\npre-conditions are satisfied, the requisite\nfoundation for the issuance of a writ of\nmandamus can hardly be said to exist Applying\nthe twin test in the present context, I am of the\nview that neither one stands satisfied. The\nlearned counsel for the petitioners were wholly\nunable to pinpoint even a single statutory\nprovision which imposed upon the respondents\nany statutory public duty to pay the salary,\nwhere the very appointment of the petitioners\nmay well be forged, fraudulent or illegal\nEqually no provision can possibly be pointed\nout which would inhere in the petitioners an\nestablished enforceable right to the relief which\nthey seek to claim.\n\n27. I would refrain from enlarging the\nexamination of the issue on principle because it\nseems to me that the matter is equally well\ncovered by binding precedent. On the scope and\nnature of the jurisdiction in a writ of mandamus\nit would suffice to recall the following\nobservations of their Lordships in\nLekhraj\nSathramdas Lalvani v. Dy. Custodian-cum-\nPatna High\nCourt CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n42/45\n\nManaging Officer, Bombay, AIR 1966 SC334 :-\n\n\"But even on the assumption that the\norder of the Deputy Custodian\nterminating the management of the\nappellant is illegal, the appellant is not\nentitled to move the High Court for grant\nof a writ in the nature of mandamus\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution.\nThe reason is that a writ of mandamus\nmay be granted only in a case where\nthere is a statutory duty imposed upon\nthe officer concerned and there is a\nfailure on the part of that officer to\ndischarge that statutory obligation. The\nchief function of the writ is to compel the\nperformance of public duties, prescribed\nby statute and to keep the subordinate\ntribunals and officers exercising public\nfunctions within the limits of their\njurisdiction. In the present case, the\nappointment of the appellant as a\nManager by the Custodian by virtue of\nhis power under Section 10(2)(b) of the\n1950 Act is contractual in its nature and\nthere is no statutory obligation as\nbetween him and the appellant. In our\nopinion, any duty or obligation falling\nupon a public servant out of a contract\nentered into by him as such public\nservant cannot be enforced by the\nmachinery of a writ under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution.\"\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n43/45\n\nIt would be manifest from the aforesaid\nauthoritative enunciation that herein the two\nbasic conditions precedent for the issuance of a\nwrit of mandamus are, thus, nonexistent.\n\n30. Furthermore, the order of regularization may be\n\ndirected in the event the person is still in service and once it\n\ncomes to an end either by efflux of time or as per the terms of\n\nthe contract of employment or termination effected by the\n\nemployer, then in such event, the relationship of employee and\n\nemployer comes to an end, no longer subsists, except for the\n\nlimited purpose to examine the legality and correctness of\n\ntermination order. Reliance can be placed on the decision\n\nrendered in the case of\nOshiar Prasad and Others vs.\n\nEmployers\nin Relation to Management of Sudamdih Coal\n\nWashery of M/s. Bharat Coking Col Limited, Dhanbad,\n\nJharkhand reported in (2015) 4 SCC 71. It will be relevant to\n\nquote paragraph no.25 of\nthe said judgment\n, which is as\n\nfollows:-\n\n\"25. It is a settled principle of law that\nabsorption and regularization in the service\ncan be claimed or/and granted only when the\ncontract of employment subsists and is in force\ninter se employee and employer. Once it comes\nto an end either by efflux of time or as per the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n44/45\n\nterms of the Contract of employment or by its\ntermination by the employer, then in such\nevent, the relationship of employee and\nemployer comes to an end and no longer\nsubsists except for the limited purpose to\nexamine the legality and correctness of its\ntermination.\"\n\n31. This view has been followed in the case of\n\nManagement of the Barara Cooperative Marketing cum\n\nProcessing Society Ltd. v. Workman Pratap Singh\nreported in\n\n2019 (1) PLJR (S.C.) 353.\n\n32. In view of aforesaid discussions, it is very much\n\nclear that the effort of the petitioners for regularization in\n\nservice was not accepted by this Court, were asked to appear in\n\nthe regular recruitment process, they have successfully\n\nappeared in the test, but on account of Policy decision of the\n\nBihar School Examination Board in the background of fact that\n\nBihar Intermediate Education Council was abolished and their\n\nemployees were absorbed in the Bihar School Examination\n\nBoard, inasmuch, there were extra employees already working\n\nthe Bihar School Examination Board, which was recorded by\n\nthe Three Men Committee, accepted by this Court and remain\n\nun- altered upto the Apex Court, but they were engaged for\nPatna High Court CWJC No.5899 of 2011 dt.27-02-2019\n\n45/45\n\ncertain period as daily wagers and were terminated in the year\n\n1996, so after such a long period, there cannot be a direction\n\nfor regularization of their services, inasmuch as, their entry as\n\ndaily wagers was not in terms of\nArticle 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, cannot be said to be a legal or regular\n\nappointment, but out and out it is an illegal appointment, does\n\nnot confer any right to claim for regularization.\n\n33. For the foregoing reasons, this Court does not find\n\nany merit in this writ petition, accordingly, the same is\n\ndismissed.\n\n(Shivaji Pandey, J)\n\npawan/-\n\nAFR/NAFR N.A.F.R.\nCAV DATE N/A\nUploading Date 02.03.2019\nTransmission Date",
