Brief facts, as set out by the prosecution, is as follows:\n\n2.1. On 19th March, 2024, a PCR call, recorded vide DD No. 08A,\nreported the suspected suicide of a woman named Shivani Singh. The\nassigned ASI immediately reached Makkar Multi-Specialty Hospital,\nlocated in Priyadarshini Vihar, Delhi, where he obtained MLC No. 580/23-\n\n24, which recorded that Shivani Singh, aged 32, had been brought dead to\nthe emergency department.\n\n2.2. Upon inspection of the matrimonial home, where the incident\nallegedly occurred, it was found that the deceased had died by hanging\nherself during the late hours of 18th March, 2024. A ligature and a vegetable-\ncutting knife were recovered from the scene and seized.\n2.3. Investigation revealed that the deceased married the Applicant on 8 th\nNovember, 2019. Since the death occurred within seven years of the\nmarriage, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Gandhi Nagar, was informed\ntelephonically in compliance with\nSection 174\nof the CrPC. Statements of\nthe deceased's father, mother, and sister were recorded. They alleged that\nthe deceased had, during telephonic conversations, disclosed that the\nApplicant was having an extra-marital affair with his office colleague named\nSarita. When confronted, the Applicant allegedly began physically abusing\nthe deceased. It was further claimed that, in the year preceding her death,\nshe had been regularly subjected to domestic violence. They also alleged\nthat the Applicant, having purchased a car, repeatedly pressured the\ndeceased to secure EMI payments from her family, and that he had\nthreatened to kill her if the money was not arranged.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 2 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\n2.4 The Complainant (father of the deceased) stated that on 18th March,\n2024, at about 10:25 PM, he received a WhatsApp call from his daughter,\nduring which she said that her husband was pressuring her to arrange the car\nloan instalment payments. The call was traced on his mobile phone, which\nwas subsequently seized and forwarded to the FSL for data retrieval and\nexpert examination.\n\n2.5. During the investigation, the Complainant submitted photographs,\nchat transcripts, and two video recordings, allegedly showing the\nApplicant's relationship with Sarita. One of the videos also purportedly\ncaptures the Applicant verbally abusing and physically assaulting the\ndeceased. These materials were sent to the FSL for forensic authentication.\n2.6. The accused persons also submitted two video recordings in their\ndefence. On examination, these were found to relate to the retirement\ncelebration of the Applicant's father. In one of the recordings, the deceased\nis seen stating that she entered the family as a daughter-in-law and was\ntreated by her father-in-law as his own daughter. However, no reference to\nthe Applicant is made in the video.\n\n2.7. Following completion of investigation, a chargesheet was filed and by\norder dated 13th February, 2025 charges against the Applicant under\n\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\nof the IPC, and, in the alternative, under\nSection\nIPC, have been framed. The Applicant has pleaded not guilty and has\nsought to stand trial.\n\nApplicant's Case\n\n3. Mr. Ramesh Gupta, Senior Counsel for the Applicant, contends that\nthe Applicant has been falsely implicated and seeks bail on the following\ngrounds:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 3 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\n3.1. The case of prosecution, rests largely on uncorroborated allegations\nmade by the deceased's family. The FIR, in broad terms, implicates all\nfamily members and attributes the Applicant's role without any direct or\nsubstantive evidence. The core allegation, that the Applicant compelled the\ndeceased to seek financial assistance from her parents to pay instalments for\na car is wholly unsupported by the material on record.\n3.2 The marriage between the Applicant and the deceased was a love\nmarriage, solemnised after a period of mutual acquaintance during college,\nand with the consent of both families. At no point, it is urged, was there any\ndemand for dowry, either directly or indirectly, by the Applicant or his\nrelatives. Consequently, the essential ingredients for invoking\nSection 304B\n\nIPC are plainly absent.\n\n3.3. As per the chargesheet, in his statement recorded during investigation,\nthe Complainant himself admitted that no dowry was ever demanded by the\nApplicant's family members.\n\n3.4. As regards the car instalments, it is submitted that the EMI payments\nwere made by the Applicant himself, a fact verified and recorded by the\nInvestigating Officer. This conclusively discredits the allegation that the\ndeceased was pressurised to arrange funds from her parental home.\n3.5. The prosecution has relied upon a video, allegedly depicting an\nincident of abuse. However, according to the Applicant, the video is over a\nyear old and lacks contextual relevance. It is submitted that, in the said clip,\nthe deceased is seen provoking and verbally abusing the Applicant, and the\nincident cannot be treated as indicative of events \"soon before death,\" as\nrequired under\nSection 304B\nIPC.\n\n3.6. The Applicant had gifted a motorcycle worth INR 2,00,000/- to his\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 4 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\nfather-in-law and the vehicle remains in the possession of the Complainant.\n\nA copy of the Registration Certificate has been annexed with the bail\napplication.\n\n3.7. The FIR records that the deceased had called her father around 8:30\nPM on the night of the incident. However, the call detail records, examined\nand verified during investigation, show that the only WhatsApp calls made\nby the deceased to her father occurred at approximately 10:25 PM. This\ndiscrepancy, it is urged, raises doubts about the accuracy of the prosecution\nnarrative and is recorded in the chargesheet.\n\n3.8. On 03rd March, 2024, at retirement party of her father-in-law, the\ndeceased gave a speech where she stated that she was happy to be a part of\nthe family and grateful for his father-in-law, who had given his full support\nand treated as her own daughter. As per the sister of the deceased, she met\nthe deceased on 17th March, 2023 i.e., one day prior to her death, and she\nwas in very happy state of mind. Thus, she shared a civil and cordial\nrelationship with her in-laws and there is no indication that there was a\ndemand for dowry soon before her death or that she had been driven to\ncommit suicide by the Applicant or his family.\n\n3.9. On 12th March, 2024, the deceased had posted a story on WhatsApp\nwhere she mentioned \"I am proudly to announce that both Parthu and I\nhave decided to part ways with Anshul soon we will be legally separated\".\nThis message indicates that parties' decision to part ways was an amicable\none, and not driven by harassment or cruelty.\n\n3.10. As per the mortem report, the cause of death is asphyxia as a result of\nante mortem hanging and there were no external and internal injuries on the\nrest of the body. This negates any allegation of physical cruelty in the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 5 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\nimmediate lead-up to the incident.\n\n3.11. While the prosecution claims that the deceased had earlier disclosed\nacts of physical abuse to her mother, no contemporaneous complaint was\never lodged, either by the deceased or her family, during the course of the\nmarriage.\n\n3.12. Even if the Applicant is assumed to have maintained a relationship\nwith one Sarita, such a relationship, by itself, would not constitute cruelty\nunder\nSection 498A\nIPC. In the absence of any cogent evidence showing\nthat this alleged affair was pursued with the intent to torment the deceased or\ndrive her to suicide, the essential ingredient of mens rea is absent. As such,\ninvocation of\nSection 498A\nIPC, it is contended, is legally untenable.\nRespondents' Case\n\n4. On the other hand, Mr. Hemant Mehla, APP for the State, and Mr.\nSarvesh Kumar, counsel for the Complainant, oppose the request and\ncontend:\n\n4.1. The allegations levelled against the Applicant concern the grave\noffence of dowry death under\nSection 304B\nof the IPC, a charge that\ninvokes a reverse presumption of culpability under\nSection 113B\nof the\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872,4 where the death of a woman occurs under\nsuspicious circumstances within seven years of marriage.\n4.2. The material collected during investigation, including the statements\nof the deceased's parents and sister, video footage allegedly showing the\nApplicant physically assaulting the deceased, and digital communications\nindicating an extramarital affair, collectively suggest a pattern of sustained\nphysical and emotional cruelty. The prosecution maintains that the deceased\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 6 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\nwas subjected to persistent harassment, both on account of dowry demands\nand emotional neglect, which cumulatively led to her unnatural death.\n4.3. The testimonies of the deceased's family members, clearly point to\nepisodes of cruelty and coercion faced by the deceased in the period\nimmediately preceding her death, thereby fulfilling the legal threshold of\n\"soon before death\" under\nSection 304B\nIPC. In such circumstances, the\nstatutory presumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act is squarely\nattracted, shifting the burden on the Applicant to rebut the inference of\nculpability.\n\n4.4. In view of the seriousness of the charge, the nature of the evidence\ngathered, and the statutory presumption that now operates against the\nApplicant, no case for bail is made out at this stage, and the application\ndeserves to be rejected.\n\nAnalysis\n\n5. The Court has given careful consideration to the rival submissions and\nexamined the material available on record. The allegations pertain to the\nunnatural death of a married woman within seven years of her marriage,\nattracting the rigours of\nSection 304B\nof the IPC and the statutory\npresumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act. The combined\neffect of these provisions places a significant evidentiary burden on the\naccused in such cases, where the death is alleged to have occurred under\nsuspicious circumstances and is preceded by cruelty or harassment related to\na dowry demand.\n\n6. The Applicant has been charged under\nSections 498A\n/\n304-B\nIPC, and\nalternatively under\nSections 306\nIPC. The ingredients of the offence under\n\"\nEvidence Act\n\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 7 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\nSection 304B\nIPC, as elucidated by the Supreme Court in\nRajinder Singh v.\nState of Punjab\n, and consistently reaffirmed in a catena of judgments,5 are\nas follows:\n\n\"9. The ingredients of the offence under\nSection 304-B\nIPC have\nbeen stated and restated in many judgments. There are four such\ningredients and they are said to be:\n\n(a) death of a woman must have been caused by any\nburns or bodily injury or her death must have occurred\notherwise than under normal circumstances;\n\n(b) such death must have occurred within seven years\nof her marriage;\n\n(c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected\nto cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative\nof her husband; and\n\n(d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection\nwith the demand for dowry.\"\n\n7. These elements form the statutory threshold for invoking the\npresumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act. However, this\npresumption is not automatic. It is contingent upon the establishment of\nfoundational facts, particularly that the alleged cruelty was both linked to a\ndowry demand and temporally proximate to the death. At the stage of bail,\nthe Court is not to undertake a detailed evaluation of evidence or return\nconclusive findings. However, a prima facie assessment is warranted to\ndetermine whether continued incarceration is justified.\n\n8. In the present case, it cannot be disputed that the deceased died under\nunnatural circumstances within approximately five years of her marriage.\nThus, the first two limbs of\nSection 304B\nIPC are met. The question that\narises is whether the remaining ingredients, particularly dowry-related\nharassment or cruelty \"soon before her death\" are supported by credible\n(2015) 6 SCC 477\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 8 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\nmaterial, so as to deny bail to the Applicant.\n\n9. The prosecution case hinges largely on post-incident statements made\nby the deceased's parents and sister. The allegations of dowry harassment\nare specifically tied to the claim that the Applicant pressurised the deceased\nto arrange funds for the payment of car instalments. However, no complaint,\nappears to have been made by the deceased or her family, during her\nlifetime, regarding this alleged demand. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous grievance prima facie dilutes the immediacy and\nplausibility of the dowry-related harassment claim.\n\n10. Further, as per the chargesheet, the car was purchased on 8 th\nNovember, 2023, and the EMIs of the same have been paid by the\nApplicant. This has been verified by the Investigating Officer and\nacknowledged in the chargesheet. While the Complainant alleges that\ncertain bank transfers and cash payments were routed through the deceased\nto support the EMI payments, the evidence cited in this regard is prima facie\ninconclusive at this stage and will require substantiation during trial.\n\n11. As regards the video in which the Applicant is allegedly seen beating\nthe deceased, it must be emphasised that for\nsection 304B\nIPC to be\ninvoked, such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with the demand\nfor dowry. The video in question is said to be over a year old, and whether it\nindicates that the alleged harassment was indeed connected to a dowry\ndemand is also a matter that must be examined at trial.\n\n12. The prosecution also relies on materials to suggest that the Applicant\nwas involved in an extramarital relationship with a woman named Sarita.\nCertain videos and chat records have been cited in support. However, even\nassuming such a relationship existed, the law is settled that an extramarital\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 9 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\naffair, per se, does not amount to not, cruelty under\nSection 498A\nIPC or\nabetment under\nSection 306\nIPC, unless it is shown that the relationship was\npursued in a manner calculated to harass or torment the deceased.\n\n13.\nIn\nParul v. State (NCT of Delhi\n),6 this Court observed that an extra-\nmarital relationship cannot be a ground to implicate the accused under\n\nSection 304B\nIPC. The Court held that harassment or cruelty should be\nlinked to dowry demands or sustained mental cruelty that occurred \"soon\nbefore the death.\" In the present case, the deceased is said to have disclosed\nthe alleged affair nearly a year prior to her death. There is no\ncontemporaneous material or specific conduct cited that would prima facie\nestablish a nexus between the alleged relationship and the dowry demand.\n\n14. Similarly, with respect to the alternative charge under\nSection 306\n\nIPC, the law requires a clearly discernible act of instigation, provocation, or\nintentional omission. Mere suspicion of an affair or even strained relations,\nwithout more, does not meet this threshold. The Supreme Court has\nconsistently emphasized that, for a charge under\nSection 306\nIPC to be\nsustained, the accused must have instigated, provoked, or engaged in\nfacilitating or encouraging the commission of suicide.\nIn\nK.V. Prakash\nBabu v. State of Karnataka,7\nSupreme Court observed as follows:\n\n\"15. The concept of mental cruelty depends upon the milieu and the\nstrata from which the persons come from and definitely has an\nindividualistic perception regard being had to one's endurance and\nsensitivity. It is difficult to generalize but certainly it can be appreciated\nin a set of established facts. Extra-marital relationship, per se, or as such\nwould not come within the ambit of\nSection 498-A\nIPC. It would be an\nillegal or immoral act, but other ingredients are to be brought home so\nthat it would constitute a criminal offence. There is no denial of the fact\nthat the cruelty need not be physical but a mental torture or abnormal\n2023 SCC OnLine Del 5499\n(2017) 11 SCC 176, see also:\nPinakin Mahipatray Rawal v. State of Gujarat\n, (2013) 10 SCC 48.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 10 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\nbehaviour that amounts to cruelty or harassment in a given case. It will\ndepend upon the facts of the said case. To explicate, solely because the\nhusband is involved in an extra-marital relationship and there is some\nsuspicion in the mind of wife, that cannot be regarded as mental\ncruelty which would attract mental cruelty for satisfying the ingredients\nof\nSection 306\nIPC.\"\n\n15. Thus, the Supreme Court clarified that, an extra-marital relationship\nper se may not come within the ambit of\nSection 498-A\nIPC. In order to\ndetermine as to whether such a relationship amounts to cruelty to attract the\noffence under\nSection 306\nIPC, the other essential ingredients of the said\noffence will also need to be satisfied, which will depend upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each individual case.\n\n16. In the present case, prima facie, there is no indication of affirmative\nacts, whether by commission or omission, that drove the deceased to a state\nof desperation immediately preceding her death. Consequently, the statutory\nthreshold for invoking\nSection 306\nIPC prima facie remains unsatisfied. The\nexistence and fulfilment of such ingredients are issues to be adjudicated after\nconclusion of the trial.\n\n17. The Applicant has remained in custody since 20 th March, 2024. The\ninvestigation stands concluded, the chargesheet has been filed, and the case\nis currently at the stage of prosecution evidence. Given the volume of\nevidence and number of witnesses cited, the trial is not likely to conclude in\nthe near future. No risk of tampering with evidence or fleeing from justice\nhas been demonstrated. In these circumstances, continued incarceration of\nthe Applicant would serve no fruitful purpose.\n\n18. It is well-established that the object of granting bail is neither punitive\nnor preventative. The primary aim sought to be achieved by bail is to secure\nthe attendance of the accused person at the trial. Accordingly, in light of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NITIN KAIN BAIL APPLN. 482/2025 Page 11 of 13\n\nSigning Date:13.05.2025\n\n14:21:39\n\nforegoing facts and circumstances, the Applicant is directed to be released\non bail on furnishing a personal bond for a sum of INR 50,000/- with two\nsureties of the like amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court/Duty\nMM, on the following conditions:\n\na.
