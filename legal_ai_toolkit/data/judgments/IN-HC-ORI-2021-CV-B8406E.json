The factual matrix of the case, in a\n\nnutshell, is that the Government of Odisha in Revenue\n\nand Disaster Management Department vide letter dated\n\n24.11.2006 conveyed the sanction and creation of 600\n\nposts of Data Entry Operators-cum-Assistants to be\n\nengaged in different districts by the Collectors to render\n\nassistance for preparation and distribution of Land\n\nPass Books for a period of six months with a\n\nremuneration of Rs.4000/- per month as per the\n\neligibility criteria and the manner prescribed therein.\n\nSo far as the Cuttack district is concerned, the number\n\nof Data Entry Operators-cum-Assistants was prescribed\n\nas 48.\n\n2.1 In order to fill up such posts, an\n\nadvertisement was issued in newspaper and through\n\nnotice in District Office, Cuttack and request was made\n\nto the District Employment Exchange, Cuttack to\n\nsponsor the names of candidates having Graduation /\n\nPost Graduation with DCA /PGDCA qualification for the\n\nPage 3 of 50\n\npurpose of being shortlisted for being appointed as\n\nData Entry Operators-cum-Assistants in various\n\nTahasils of Cuttack district. Consequentially, the\n\npetitioners, along with 150 other candidates, were\n\nshortlisted and they were asked to appear in the written\n\ntest. Thereafter, a computer test was held on\n\n31.01.2008 in the Conference Hall of the Collectorate,\n\nCuttack by issuing call letters to the individual\n\ncandidates on 24.01.2008 by the ADM, Cuttack -cum-\n\nVice Chairman, District Level Selection Committee,\n\nCuttack. By following due procedure of selection, the\n\npetitioners were selected and also appointed as Data\n\nEntry Operators-cum-Assistants in various Tahasils of\n\nCuttack district. Though they were initially appointed\n\nfor a period of six months, but they were allowed to\n\ncontinue by extending the period from time to time and\n\nare continuing till date. As such, they have already\n\nbeen allowed grade pay of Rs.1900/- per month w.e.f.\n\n12.08.2014, vide letter dated 21.01.2015, and also\n\nPage 4 of 50\n\nallowed the enhanced consolidated remuneration by\n\nrevising the same to Rs.8,880/-, which was inclusive of\n\nESI/EPF dues of the employer share w.e.f. 01.09.2017.\n\n2.2 The opposite party no.1, vide letter dated\n\n03.05.2012, communicated the copy of the minutes of\n\nmeeting recording the decision taken by the Chief\n\nSecretary on 28.04.2012 on the issue of regularization\n\nof contractual Data Entry Operators engaged in\n\nTahasils, where the following decisions were taken.\n\n\"(i) Data Entry Operators engaged on\ncontractual basis in Tahasils should continue\nand should not be disengaged till a decision\nregarding regularization is finalized.\n\n(ii) Govt. is contemplating to frame policy on\nregularization of contractual Data Entry\nOperators in various Departments.\n\n(iii) The Policy so framed shall be applicable\nto those Data Entry Operators.\"\n\n2.3. Accordingly, the Government of Odisha\n\npromulgated a policy for regularization of services of\n\nexisting contractual Group-C and Group-D employees\n\nworking under the State Government vide GA\n\nDepartment Resolution dated 17.09.2013. It has been\n\nPage 5 of 50\n\nstated that for regular appointment, a gradation list of\n\nsuch contractual employees shall be prepared by the\n\nappointing authority on the basis of their date of\n\nappointment and regular appointment of those\n\ncategories of contractual employees shall be made on\n\nthe date of completion of six years of service or from the\n\ndate of publication of the said resolution, whichever is\n\nlater, in the order in which their names appear in the\n\ngradation list prepared under Para-1 of such policy. The\n\nperiod of six years shall be counted from the date of\n\ncontractual appointment prior to publication of the said\n\nresolution. In para-2 thereof, it was further provided\n\nthat on the date of satisfactory completion of six years\n\nof contractual service or from the date of publication of\n\nsuch resolution, whichever is later, they shall be\n\ndeemed to have been regularly appointed and a formal\n\norder of regular appointment shall be issued by the\n\nappointing authority. Consequently, upon regular\n\nappointment under the contractual post, if any, shall\n\nPage 6 of 50\n\nget re-converted to regular sanction post. In case the\n\nperson concerned has crossed the upper age limit, the\n\nappointing authority shall allow relaxation of upper age\n\nlimit. Subsequently, the Government of Odisha in G.A.\n\nDepartment issued another resolution on 16.01.2014\n\nexpressly clarifying resolution of the GA Department\n\ndated 17.09.2013 that proposal for regularization shall\n\nbe considered and approved by the High Power\n\nCommittee to be constituted under the chairmanship of\n\nthe concerned department.\n\n2.4 Basing upon such resolution dated\n\n17.09.2013, various other departments of the\n\nGovernment have already regularized Data Entry\n\nOperators in their respective posts in PB-I Rs.5200-\n\n20000/- with GP Rs.1900/- and/or Rs.2400/-. Such\n\nbenefit has been extended pursuant to order dated\n\n17.05.2017 passed by the Odisha Administrative\n\nTribunal in the case of\nJatin Kumar Das vs. State of\n\nOdisha\nin O.A. No. 2172 (C) of 2015 and batch, which\n\nPage 7 of 50\n\nhas been upheld by this Court on 10.05.2018 in WP(C)\n\nNo. 6661 of 2018 and also by the apex Court on\n\n06.08.2018 by dismissing SLP No. 18642 of 2018\n\npreferred by the State of Odisha. Consequent upon the\n\njudgment of the tribunal, the Data Entry Operators\n\nworking in the CT organization, Higher Education\n\nDepartment, Department of Tourism & Culture, Dean &\n\nPrincipal, SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack\n\nand office of the Collector, Cuttack have been\n\nregularized vide Annexure-11 series.\n\n2.5 In the meantime, though G.A.\n\nDepartment formulated Odisha Group-„C‟ and Group-\n\n„D‟ Posts (Contractual Appointment) Rules, 2013, but\n\nthe same have no application to the cases covered\n\nunder G.A. Department Resolution dated 17.09.2013.\n\nBut while granting extension to the contractual\n\nappointments of the petitioners for a further period of\n\nsix months, i.e. up to 28.02.2020, the opposite party\n\nno.1, vide letter dated 26.09.2019, made a stipulation\n\nPage 8 of 50\n\nthat \"or till completion of the process of recruitment and\n\nappointment against 692 posts of Junior Clerks created\n\nfor Tahasils and Sub-Division Officers, whichever is\n\nearlier.\"\n\n2.6 In the meantime, vide G.O. No. 6289 of\n\n24.02.2016 the opposite party no.1 had conveyed\n\nsanction for creation of 692 posts of Junior Clerks in\n\n317 Tahasils of the State in lieu of abolition of equal\n\nnumber of vacant posts in Survey & Settlement\n\norganization of Board of Revenue with clear indication\n\nthat the posts would be created and would be required\n\nfor regularization for DEOs engaged on contractual\n\nbasis in all the Tahasils of the State. All the petitioners\n\nhave completed six years of contractual services.\n\nTherefore, their services are deemed to be regularized\n\nby issuing formal letters of regularization. But the\n\nopposite parties having not taken any steps for\n\ncommunication of the formal letters of regularization,\n\nthe petitioners approached the Odisha Administrative\n\nPage 9 of 50\n\nTribunal by filing Original Applications and the\n\npetitioner no.1, who was also petitioner no.1 in O.A.\n\nNo.554 (C) of 2018 filed W.P.(C) No. 3678 of 2020,\n\nwhich was disposed of on 03.02.2020 stating inter alia\n\n\"considering the submissions made and looking into\n\nconsideration the development through Annexure-5 this\n\nCourt finds Annexure-7 should be processed to\n\naccommodate the persons for whom the vacancies have\n\nbeen arisen, vide Annexure-5.\" In view of such order of\n\nthis Court, the petitioner no.1 submitted representation\n\nbefore the Collector and District Magistrate, Cuttack\n\nwith a prayer for compliance of the direction of this\n\nCourt and for consideration of their cases for\n\nregularization by issuing a formal order of\n\nregularization as per GA Department Resolution dated\n\n17.09.2013 on completion of six years of contractual\n\nservice against the sanctioned posts they were\n\ncontinuing. By order dated 19.05.2020, the opposite\n\nparty no.1 allowed extension of term of contractual\n\nPage 10 of 50\n\nappointment of the 600 DEOs working in different\n\nTahsils in the State, including the present petitioners,\n\non the same terms and conditions as indicated earlier\n\nfor a further period of six months from 01.03.2020 to\n\n31.08.2020.\n\n2.7 Meanwhile, Finance Department took a\n\ndecision on austerity measure due to Covid-19 and\n\nissued office memorandum dated 07.07.2020 stating\n\nthat the persons who are engaged on outsourcing basis,\n\nare to be paid their entitlement as per the terms and\n\nconditions of the engagement till contract period ends.\n\nIf the contract period ends within the lock down period,\n\nthen the entitlement to be paid till the end of the\n\ncontract period. Thereby, instead of regularizing the\n\nservices by issuing a formal letter of regularization in\n\nterms of resolution dated 17.09.2013, extension was\n\ngiven to the petitioners, who are rendering service as\n\nData Entry Operators on contractual basis and have\n\nalready completed more than six years of service.\n\nPage 11 of 50\n\nTherefore, they approached this Court by filing this writ\n\npetition, which was disposed of, vide order dated\n\n20.08.2020, which runs as follows:\n\n\"This matter is taken up through Video\nConferencing.\n\nHeard Sri Tripathy, learned counsel for the\npetitioners and Sri Panda, learned Additional\nGovernment Advocate for the State-opposite\nparties.\n\nThe petitioners have filed this application\nseeking for a direction to the opposite parties to\nregularize their services taking into account their\ncontinuous service of more than 8 years, as has\nbeen done in favour of the other similarly\nsituated persons as per Government Circular\nand in terms of the principle decided in\n\nSecretary State of Karnataka and Others v.\nUmadevi\n(3) and Others (2006) 4 SCC 1 and in\nState of Karnataka & others Vrs. M.L.\nKesari & others involving SLP(C)\nNo.15774/2006.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners submits\nthat the petitioners were engaged on monthly\nremuneration basis. They have already\nrendered more than 8 years of service under the\nopposite parties and therefore, seeks for\nregularization of services in view of the\njudgment passed by the Hon‟ble apex Court in\n\nSecretary State of Karnataka and others v.\nUmadevi\n(3) and others (2006) 4 SCC 1 and in\nState of Karnataka & others Vrs. M.L.\nKesari & others involving SLP(C)\nNo.15774/2006.\n\nConsidering the contentions raised by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners and after\ngoing through the records, it appears that the\npetitioners have rendered service for more than\n8 years on monthly remuneration basis.\nTherefore, the case of the petitioners is squarely\ncovered by the ratio decided in the cases cited\n\nPage 12 of 50\n\nsupra.\nIn that view of the matter, this Court\ndisposes of this Writ Petition directing the\nopposite parties to consider the case of the\npetitioners and regularize their services keeping\nin view the judgment in the case of\nSecretary\nState of Karnataka and others v.

Parija, learned Advocate general\npoints out that the impugned order was passed\non the very first date of listing of the writ\npetition and was disposed of without notice\nbeing issued to the Appellants herein.\n\nAccordingly, there was no occasion for the\nAppellants to even file a counter affidavit after\nverifying the factual averments in the petition.\nMr. Parija points out that the writ petition was\ndisposed of by simply following an earlier order\nof the learned Single judge of similar nature\nwhich too was passed on the very first date. He\nfurther points out that in some of the petitions\neven the correct Department of the Government\nwas not impleaded as party.\n\n5. Mr.B.S.Tripathy, learned counsel for the\nRespondents appearing on caveat, does not\ndispute that the writ petition was disposed of on\nthe very first date of listing without notice to the\nAppellants and without any opportunity to them\nto file a counter affidavit.\n\n6. On the above short admitted ground, this\nCourt is of the view that the impugned order\nshould be set aside and the matter remanded to\nthe learned Single Judge for a fresh disposal on\nmerits after completion of pleadings.\n\n7. Accordingly, with the consent of learned\ncounsel for the Respondents, the impugned\norder dated 20th August, 2020 passed by the\nlearned Single Judge in W.P. (C) No.19951 of\n2020 is hereby set aside with the following\ndirections:\n\n(i) W.P.

The writ appeal is disposed of in the above\nterms.\n\n9. As the restrictions due to resurgence of\nCOVID-19 situation are continuing, learned\ncounsel for the parties may utilize a printout of\nthe order available in the High Court‟s website,\nat par with certified copy, subject to attestation\nby the concerned advocate, in the manner\nprescribed vide Court‟s Notice No.4798, dated\n15th April, 2021.\n\n(Dr. S. Muralidhar)\nChief Justice\n\n(Savitri Ratho)\nJudge\"\n\nIn view of the above quoted order of the Division Bench,\n\nthe order dated 20.08.2020 passed by the learned\n\nSingle Judge having been set aside, this writ petition\n\nwas assigned to this Court for its fresh disposal in\n\nPage 15 of 50\n\naccordance with the directions contained in para-7 of\n\nthe order passed by the Division Bench.\n\n3. Mr. B.S. Tripathy-1, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioners contended that the petitioners have been\n\nappointed against regular vacancies and/or sanctioned\n\nposts by following due procedure of selection and, as\n\nsuch, they have not entered into service through\n\nbackdoor method, and in the meantime, they have\n\ncompleted more than 6 years of service. In view of the\n\nG.A. Department resolution dated 17.09.2013, on\n\ncompletion of six years of service, they are deemed to be\n\nregularized and consequentially orders of regularization\n\nhave to be issued in their favour by the authorities.\n\nBut due to non-issuance of formal order of\n\nregularization, the petitioners are deprived of their\n\nlegitimate claim, even though they are continuing as\n\nData Entry Operators with the scale of pay admissible\n\nto the said post. It is further contended that the\n\npetitioners had been appointed in the year 2008 against\n\nPage 16 of 50\n\nsanctioned post. By the time the resolution came i.e.,\n\non 17.09.2013, although they had not completed six\n\nyears of service, but subsequently, they having fulfilled\n\nthe said criteria, as a matter of policy decision, they\n\nshould have been regularized as Data Entry Operators.\n\nIt is further contended that the resolution so passed,\n\nhaving been implemented in other departments, non-\n\nextension of benefits of such resolution to the\n\npetitioners amounts to discrimination. It is contended\n\nthat office memorandum dated 07.07.2000 is not\n\napplicable to the petitioners, and that by now since the\n\npetitioners have completed more than ten years of\n\nservice against sanctioned posts, their services have to\n\nbe regularized in terms of the judgments of the apex\n\nCourt in\nState of Karnataka vs. Umadevi\n(\n3), (2006)\n\n4 SCC 1, State of Karnataka vs. M.L. Keshari\n,\n\n(2010) 9 SCC 247;\nAmarkant Rai vs. State of Bihar\n,\n\n(2015) 8 SCC 265;\nSheo Narain Nagar & Ors. vs.\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.\n, AIR 2018 SC 233;\n\nPage 17 of 50\n\nRajnish Kumar Mishra vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n,\n\n2019 (17) SCC 648;\nJatin Kumar Das vs. State of\n\nOdisha and others\n(O.A. No. 2172 (C) of 2015 and\n\nbatch, disposed of on 17.05.2017), which has been\n\nupheld by this Court in W.P.(C) No. 6661 of 2018, vide\n\norder dated 10.05.2018 and also by the apex Court in\n\nSpecial Leave to Appeal (C) No. 18642 of 2018, disposed\n\nof on 06.08.2018; Biswamitra Parida & another vs.\n\nState of Odisha and another (W.P.(C) No. 22112 of\n\n2020 disposed of on 03.09.2020) which was confirmed\n\nin W.A. No. 822 of 2020 by the Division Bench of this\n\nCourt on 10.02.2021 and also in Special Leave to\n\nAppeal No. 6851 of 2021 by the apex Court on\n\n30.06.2021; and\nRajendra Kumar Nayak vs. Orissa\n\nMining Corporation Ltd. & Ors.\n2017 (II) ILR -CUT-\n\n912.\n\n4. Per contra, Mr. H.M. Dhal, learned Addl.\n\nGovernment Advocate argued with vehemence\n\ncontending that the petitioners, who are working as\n\nPage 18 of 50\n\nData Entry Operators, have filed this writ petition with\n\na prayer to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus to\n\nregularize their services. One of the pre conditions for\n\nexercising power under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\n\nof India for issuance of writ of mandamus is that the\n\nCourt must come to the conclusion that the aggrieved\n\nperson has a legal right which entitles him to any of the\n\nreliefs, and that such right has been infringed. It is\n\nfurther contended that the claim of the petitioners for\n\nregularization of their service in accordance with the\n\nG.A. Department Resolution dated 17.09.2013 on\n\ncompletion of 6 years of service is not automatic and\n\nsuch resolution has been clarified by subsequent\n\nresolution dated 16.01.2014, which provides that no\n\ncontractual appointee shall be eligible for regular\n\nappointment unless the mandatory eligibility conditions\n\nprescribed in the resolution dated 17.09.2013 are\n\nfulfilled. In paragraph-2 of the resolution dated\n\nPage 19 of 50\n\n16.01.2014, it has been specifically mentioned as\n\nfollows :-\n\n\"A part from the contractual employees fulfilling\nthe conditionalities elucidated in para 1 above,\nthere are other categories of contractual\nemployees engaged with or without creation of\nposts with the concurrence of Finance\nDepartment, without following the relevant\nrecruitment and reservation Rules. There are\nalso contractual employees engaged on out\nsourcing basis through service providing\nagencies. These contractual employees are not\neligible for regularization as per the aforesaid\nResolution.\"\n\nIt is further contended that in such cases the\n\nmechanism which is to be adopted is, a High Power\n\nCommittee has to be constituted under the\n\nchairmanship of the Secretary of the relevant\n\nDepartment in which the concerned Head of the\n\nDepartment and FA/AFA of the Department shall be\n\nthe members. Such High Power Committee by\n\nconsidering the cases of regularization should ensure\n\nthat the concerned appointees fulfill the mandatory\n\neligibility conditions as prescribed in the resolution\n\ndated 17.09.2013. The same having not been complied,\n\nthe petitioners cannot be regularized as claimed in this\n\nPage 20 of 50\n\nwrit petition. To the alternative argument advanced by\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioners, it is contended that\n\nthe completion of 10 years of services is in terms of\n\nUmadevi\n(supra) but by the time such judgment was\n\nrendered, the petitioners had not competed 10 years of\n\nservices, therefore, their service cannot be regularized.\n\nTo substantiate his contention, he has relied upon the\n\njudgment of the apex Court in\nUniversity of Delhi vs.\n\nDelhi University Contract Employees Union and\n\nothers\n, (2021) SCC OnLine SC 256.\n\n5. This Court heard Mr. B.S. Tripathy-1,\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. H.M. Dhal,\n\nlearned Addl. Government Advocate appearing for\n\nState-opposite parties by hybrid mode. Pleadings\n\nhaving been exchanged between the parties and with\n\nthe consent of the learned counsel for the parties, this\n\nwrit petition is being disposed of finally at the stage of\n\nadmission in compliance of order dated 17.06.2021\n\npassed in W.A. No. 298 of 2021.\n\nPage 21 of 50\n\n6. Before delving into the contentions raised\n\nby learned counsel for the parties, it is apposite to\n\nmention here that the apex Court in\nRoma Sonkar v.\n\nMadhya Pradesh State Public Service Commission\n,\n\n2018 (II) OLR (SC) 483 held that the Division Bench in\n\nappeal arising out of order passed under writ\n\njurisdiction exercises same jurisdiction, primarily and\n\nmostly to consider the correctness or otherwise of the\n\nview taken by the learned Single Judge. Therefore, the\n\nlearned Single Judge is not sub-ordinate to the Division\n\nBench. In such circumstance, the Division Bench is to\n\nconsider the writ appeal on merits instead of remitting\n\nthe matter back to the learned Single Judge. But, in\n\nthis case, the Division Bench, instead of deciding the\n\nwrit appeal on merit, has remitted the matter back to\n\nthe learned Single Judge with certain directions as\n\ncontained in para-7 of the order itself. Therefore,\n\nadhering to the judicial discipline, this Court, in\n\ncompliance of the order dated 17.06.2021 passed by\n\nPage 22 of 50\n\nthe Division Bench, heard this matter afresh in terms of\n\nthe directions contained in para-7 of the said order.\n\n7. On careful consideration of the rival\n\ncontentions and on perusal of materials available on\n\nrecord, this Court finds that the petitioners, having\n\nrequisite eligibility criteria and on being duly selected\n\nthrough a transparent written test conducted by the\n\nselection committee headed by ADM, had been\n\nappointed against the sanctioned vacant posts and\n\ncontinued to work for more than 6 years, without\n\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court,\n\nor tribunal. Therefore, they are deemed to be\n\nregularized in PB-1 Rs.5200-20000/- + GP Rs.1900/-\n\nwith usual allowances admissible from time to time, as\n\nper GA Department resolution dated 17.09.2013 by\n\nissuing a formal order of regularization in their favour,\n\nparticularly when such benefits have already been\n\nextended to similarly circumstanced employees of other\n\ndepartments vide Annexure-11 series. Non-extension of\n\nPage 23 of 50\n\nsuch benefits to the petitioners amounts to arbitrary\n\nand unreasonable exercise of power by the authority,\n\nwhich violates Article -14 of the Constitution of India. It\n\nis not in dispute that the petitioners were engaged in\n\nthe year 2008 and are continuing in service till date by\n\ngetting extension from spell to spell, and as such, a\n\nright has already been accrued in their favour on\n\ncompletion of six years of satisfactory service in terms\n\nof the resolution dated 17.09.2013.\n\n8. It is worthwhile to mention here that the\n\nCourt comes into picture only to ensure observance of\n\nfundamental rights, and to ensure the rule of law and\n\nto see that the executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal\n\nto its employees consistent with requirements of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, and that the\n\nauthority should not exploit its employees nor should it\n\nseek to take advantage of the helplessness and misery\n\nof either the unemployed persons or the employees, as\n\nthe case may be. For this very reason, it is held that a\n\nPage 24 of 50\n\nperson should not be kept in contractual, temporary or\n\nad hoc status for a long period. Where a contractual,\n\ntemporary or ad hoc appointment is continued for long,\n\nthe Court presumes that there is need of a regular post\n\nand accordingly directs for regularization. While issuing\n\ndirection for regularization, the Court must first\n\nascertain the relevant fact, and must be cognizant of\n\nthe several situations and eventualities that may arise\n\non account of such direction. If for any reason, a\n\ncontractual, ad hoc or temporary employee is continued\n\nfor a fairly long spell, the authorities must consider his\n\ncase for regularization, provided he is eligible and\n\nqualified according to rules and his service record is\n\nsatisfactory and his appointment does not run counter\n\nto the reservation policy of the State. Even though a\n\ncasual labourer is continued for a fairly long spell, say\n\ntwo or three years, a presumption may arise that there\n\nis regular need for his service. In such a situation, it\n\nbecomes obligatory for the concerned authority to\n\nPage 25 of 50\n\nexamine the feasibility of his regularization. While doing\n\nso, the authorities ought to adopt a positive approach\n\ncoupled with empathy for the person.\n\n9.\nIn\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra) the apex Court in\n\nparagraph-53 of the judgment held as follows:\n\n\"One aspect needs to be clarified. There may\nbe cases where irregular appointments (not\nillegal appointments) as explained in State of\nMysore v. S.V. Narayanappa, AIR 1967 SC\n1071; R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmaiah,\n(1972) 1 SCC 409 and B.N. Nagarajan v.\n\nState of Karnataka (1979) 4 SCC 507 and\nreferred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified\npersons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might\nhave been made and the employees have\ncontinued to work for ten years or more but\nwithout the intervention of orders of the courts\nor of tribunals. The question of regularisation\nof the services of such employees may have to\nbe considered on merits in the light of the\nprinciples settled by this Court in the cases\nabove referred to and in the light of this\njudgment. In that context, the Union of India,\nthe State Governments and their\ninstrumentalities should take steps to\nregularise as a one-time measure, the services\nof such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly\nsanctioned posts but not under cover of orders\nof the courts or of tribunals and should further\nensure that regular recruitments are\nundertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned\nposts that require to be filled up, in cases\nwhere temporary employees or daily wagers\nare being now employed. The process must be\nset in motion within six months from this date.\nWe also clarify that regularisation, if any\n\nPage 26 of 50\n\nalready made, but not sub judice, need not be\nreopened based on this judgment, but there\nshould be no further bypassing of the\nconstitutional requirement and regularising or\nmaking permanent, those not duly appointed\nas per the constitutional scheme.\"\n\n10. Further, in\nM.L. Kesari\n(supra), following\n\nthe ratio decided in\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra), the apex Court\n\nin paragraphs 9, 10 & 11 of the judgment held as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"9. The term \"one-time measure\" has to be\nunderstood in its proper perspective. This\nwould normally mean that after the decision\nin Umadevi (3), each department or each\ninstrumentality should undertake a one-time\nexercise and prepare a list of all casual, daily-\nwage or ad hoc employees who have been\nworking for more than ten years without the\nintervention of courts and tribunals and\nsubject them to a process verification as to\nwhether they are working against vacant\nposts and possess the requisite qualification\nfor the post and if so, regularise their services.\n\n10. At the end of six months from the date of\ndecision in Umadevi (3), cases of several\ndaily-wage/ad hoc/casual employees were\nstill pending before courts. Consequently,\nseveral departments and instrumentalities did\nnot commence the one-time regularisation\nprocess. On the other hand, some government\ndepartments or instrumentalities undertook\nthe one-time exercise excluding several\nemployees from consideration either on the\nground that their cases were pending in\ncourts or due to sheer oversight. In such\ncircumstances, the employees who were\nentitled to be considered in terms of para 53\n\nPage 27 of 50\n\nof the decision in Umadevi (3), will not lose\ntheir right to be considered for regularisation,\nmerely because the one-time exercise was\ncompleted without considering their cases, or\nbecause the six-month period mentioned in\npara 53 of Umadevi (3) has expired. The one-\ntime exercise should consider all daily-\nwage/ad hoc/casual employees who had put\nin 10 years of continuous service as on 10-4-\n2006 without availing the protection of any\ninterim orders of courts or tribunals. If any\nemployer had held the one-time exercise in\nterms of para 53 of Umadevi (3), but did not\nconsider the cases of some employees who\nwere entitled to the benefit of para 53 of\nUmadevi (3), the employer concerned should\nconsider their cases also, as a continuation of\nthe one-time exercise. The one-time exercise\nwill be concluded only when all the employees\nwho are entitled to be considered in terms of\npara 53 of Umadevi (3), are so considered.\n\n11. The object behind the said direction in\npara 53 of Umadevi (3) is twofold. First is to\nensure that those who have put in more than\nten years of continuous service without the\nprotection of any interim orders of courts or\ntribunals, before the date of decision\nin Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1] was rendered,\nare considered for regularisation in view of\ntheir long service. Second is to ensure that the\ndepartments/instrumentalities do not\nperpetuate the practice of employing persons\non daily-wage/ad hoc/casual basis for long\nperiods and then periodically regularise them\non the ground that they have served for more\nthan ten years, thereby defeating the\nconstitutional or statutory provisions relating\nto recruitment and appointment. The true\neffect of the direction is that all persons who\nhave worked for more than ten years as on\n10-4-2006 [the date of decision in Umadevi\n(3) without the protection of any interim order\nof any court or tribunal, in vacant posts,\npossessing the requisite qualification, are\n\nPage 28 of 50\n\nentitled to be considered for regularisation.\n\nThe fact that the employer has not undertaken\nsuch exercise of regularisation within six\nmonths of the decision in Umadevi (3) or that\nsuch exercise was undertaken only in regard\nto a limited few, will not disentitle such\nemployees, the right to be considered for\nregularisation in terms of the above directions\nin Umadevi (3) as a one-time measure.\"\n\n11. The purpose and intent of the decision\n\nin\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra) was therefore twofold, namely, to\n\nprevent irregular or illegal appointments in the future\n\nand secondly, to confer a benefit on those who had been\n\nirregularly appointed in the past.\n\nThe fact that the State\n\nof Jharkhand continued with the irregular\n\nappointments for almost a decade after the decision\n\nin\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra) is a clear indication that it\n\nbelieves that it was all right to continue with irregular\n\nappointments, and whenever required, terminate the\n\nservices of the irregularly appointed employees on the\n\nground that they were irregularly appointed. This is\n\nnothing but a form of exploitation of the employees by\n\nnot giving them the benefits of regularization and by\n\nplacing the sword of Damocles over their head.\n\nThis is\n\nPage 29 of 50\n\nprecisely what\nUmadevi (3) and M.L.Kesari\n(supra),\n\nsought to avoid.\n\n12. The laudable objective behind the\n\naforementioned judgments of the apex Court in\n\nUmadevi and M.L. Keshari is to prevent the employers\n\nto exploit employees by engaging them in different\n\ncategories of names, i.e., daily/casual/NMR and now\n\ncontractual one. Therefore, as an one time measure, the\n\napex Court observed that for the employees, who have\n\ncompleted ten years of service as on the judgment of\n\nUmadevi, the employers should take steps for\n\nregularization of their services so that the irregularly\n\nand illegally engaged employees, having rendered so\n\nmany years, will not be exploited any further. But the\n\navowed objective of the judgments of the apex Court in\n\nUmadevi and M.L. Keshari has not been adhered to by\n\nthe employer in letter and spirit. In contravention to\n\nsuch objective, the employers have gone on engaging\n\nthe employees in different names, more particularly,\n\nPage 30 of 50\n\nnow-a-days, as contractual engagement. Thereby, the\n\nemployers are overreaching the principle\nlaid down by\n\nthe apex Court in aforementioned judgments. For that,\n\nthe employees should not be denied the benefit of\n\nregularization, as they have been exploited by the\n\nemployers.\n\n13.\nIn\nMalathi Das (Retired) Now P.B.\n\nMahishy v. Suresh\n; (2014) 13 SCC 249, relying upon\n\nthe ratio decided in\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra), the apex Court\n\nheld that refusing regularization of service cannot be\n\ncountenanced to such decision and, therefore, clarified\n\nthat the appellants therein so also all other competent\n\nauthorities of the State would be obliged and duty\n\nbound to regularize the services of employees which will\n\nbe done forthwith.\n\n14.\nIn\nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra and\n\nothers v. State of Orissa\n, AIR 2014 SC 1716, the apex\n\nCourt clarified the ratio decided in\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra)\n\nat paragraphs 34 and 35 as follows:\n\nPage 31 of 50\n\n\"34. A Constitution Bench of this Court in\n\nSecretary, State of Karnataka and Ors. v.\nUmadevi\n(3) and Ors. (2006) 4 SCC 1 : (AIR\n2006 SC 1806 : 2006 AIR SCW 1991) ruled\nthat regularisation of illegal or irregularly\nappointed persons could never be an\nalternative mode of recruitment to public\nservice. Such recruitments were, in the opinion\nof this Court, in complete negation of the\nguarantees contained in\nArticles 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution. Having said so, this Court\ndid not upset the regularisations that had\nalready taken place, regardless of whether\nsuch regularisations related to illegal or\nirregular appointments. The ratio of the\ndecision in that sense was prospective in its\napplication, leaving untouched that which had\nalready happened before the pronouncement\nof that decision. This is evident from the\nfollowing passage appearing in the decision:\n\n\"We also clarify that regularization, if\nany already made, but not subjudice, need\nnot be reopened based on this judgment, but\nthere should be no further by-passing of the\nconstitutional requirement and regularizing or\nmaking permanent, those not duly appointed\nas per the constitutional scheme.\"\n\n35. The above is a significant feature of the\npronouncement of this Court in Umadevi's\ncase (supra). The second and equally\nsignificant feature is the exception which this\nCourt made in para 53 of the decision\npermitting a one-time exception for\nregularising services of such employees as\nhad been irregularly appointed and had\nserved for ten years or more. The State\nGovernment and its instrumentalities were\nrequired to formulate schemes within a period\nof six months from the date of the decision for\nregularisation of such employees. This is\nevident from a reading of para 53 (of SCC) :\n\nPage 32 of 50\n\n(Para 44 of AIR, AIR SCW) of the decision\nwhich is reproduced in extenso:\n\n\"One aspect needs to be clarified. There may\nbe cases where irregular appointments (not\nillegal appointments) as explained in S.V.\nNarayanappa (AIR 1967 SC 1071) (supra),\nR.N. Nanjundappa (AIR 1972 SC 1767)\n(supra), and\nB.N. Nagarajan (AIR 1979 SC\n\n1676) (supra), and referred to in paragraph 15\nabove, of duly qualified persons in duly\nsanctioned vacant posts might have been\nmade and the employees have continued to\nwork for ten years or more but without the\nintervention of orders of courts or of tribunals.\n\nThe question of regularization of the services\nof such employees may have to be considered\non merits in the light of the principles settled\nby this Court in the cases above referred to\nand in the light of this judgment. In that\ncontext, the Union of India, the State\nGovernments and their instrumentalities\nshould take steps to regularize as a one time\nmeasure, the services of such irregularly\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or\nmore in duly sanctioned posts but not under\ncover of orders of courts or of tribunals and\nshould further ensure that regular\nrecruitments are undertaken to fill those\nvacant sanctioned posts that require to be\nfilled up, in cases where temporary employees\nor daily wagers are being now employed. The\nprocess must be set in motion within six\nmonths from this date...\"\n\n15. So far as \"irregular appointment\" is\n\nconcerned, the same has also been clarified in\n\nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra\n(supra) at paragraph-\n\n43 as follows:\n\nPage 33 of 50\n\n\"43. As to what would constitute an irregular\nappointment is no longer res integra. The\ndecision of this Court in\nState of Karnataka\nv. M.L. Kesari and Ors.\n(2010) 9 SCC 247 :\n\n(AIR 2010 SC 2587 : 2010 AIR SCW 4577),\nhas examined that question and explained the\nprinciple regarding regularisation as\nenunciated in\nUmadevi\n's case (supra). The\ndecision\nin that case\nsummed up the following\nthree essentials for regularisation (1) the\nemployees worked for ten years or more, (2)\nthat they have so worked in a duly sanctioned\npost without the benefit or protection of the\ninterim order of any court or tribunal and (3)\nthey should have possessed the minimum\nqualification stipulated for the appointment.\nSubject to these three requirements being\nsatisfied, even if the appointment process did\nnot involve open competitive selection, the\nappointment would be treated irregular and\nnot illegal and thereby qualify for\nregularisation. Para 7 in this regard is\napposite and may be extracted at this stage:\n\n\"7. It is evident from the above that\nthere is an exception to the general\nprinciples against \"regularisation\"\n\nenunciated in Umadevi, if the following\nconditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should\nhave worked for 10 years or more in\nduly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim\norder of any court or tribunal. In other\nwords, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed\nthe employee and continued him in\nservice voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee\nshould not be illegal, even if irregular.\n\nWhere the appointments are not made\n\nPage 34 of 50\n\nor continued against sanctioned posts\nor where the persons appointed do not\npossess the prescribed minimum\nqualifications, the appointments will be\nconsidered to be illegal. But where the\nperson employed possessed the\nprescribed qualifications and was\nworking against sanctioned posts, but\nhad been selected without undergoing\nthe process of open competitive\nselection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.\"\n\n16. The apex Court in Amarkant Rai,\n\nmentioned supra, referring to\nNihal Singh v. State of\n\nPunjab\n, (2013) 14 SCC 65, in paragraphs 12 & 13 held\n\nas follows:\n\n\"12. Applying the ratio of Umadevi (3) case [(2006)\n4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , this Court in\nNihal\nSingh v. State of Punjab\n[(2013) 14 SCC 65 : (2013)\n3 SCC (L&S) 85] directed the absorption of the\nSpecial Police Officers in the services of the State of\nPunjab holding as under: (\nNihal Singh\ncase [(2013)\n14 SCC 65 : (2013) 3 SCC (L&S) 85] , SCC pp. 79-\n80, paras 35-36)\n\n\"35. Therefore, it is clear that the existence\nof the need for creation of the posts is a\nrelevant factor with reference to which the\nexecutive government is required to take\nrational decision based on relevant\nconsideration. In our opinion, when the facts\nsuch as the ones obtaining in the instant case\ndemonstrate that there is need for the\ncreation of posts, the failure of the executive\ngovernment to apply its mind and take a\ndecision to create posts or stop extracting\nwork from persons such as the appellants\nherein for decades together itself would be\n\nPage 35 of 50\n\narbitrary action (inaction) on the part of the\nState.\n\n36. The other factor which the State is\nrequired to keep in mind while creating or\nabolishing posts is the financial implications\ninvolved in such a decision. The creation of\nposts necessarily means additional financial\nburden on the exchequer of the State.\nDepending upon the priorities of the State, the\nallocation of the finances is no doubt\nexclusively within the domain of the\nlegislature. However in the instant case\ncreation of new posts would not create any\nadditional financial burden to the State as\nthe various banks at whose disposal the\nservices of each of the appellants is made\navailable have agreed to bear the burden. If\nabsorbing the appellants into the services of\nthe State and providing benefits on a par\nwith the police officers of similar rank\nemployed by the State results in further\nfinancial commitment it is always open for\nthe State to demand the banks to meet such\nadditional burden. Apparently no such\ndemand has ever been made by the State.\nThe result is--the various banks which avail\nthe services of these appellants enjoy the\nsupply of cheap labour over a period of\ndecades. It is also pertinent to notice that\nthese banks are public sector banks.\"\n\n13. In our view, the exception carved out in para 53\nof Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] is applicable to the facts of the present case.\nThere is no material placed on record by the\nrespondents that the appellant has been lacking\nany qualification or bore any blemish record during\nhis employment for over two decades.\n\n17. In Sheo Narain Nagar, mentioned\n\nsupra, the apex Court in paragraph-8 of the judgment\n\nheld as follows:\n\nPage 36 of 50\n\n\"8. When we consider the prevailing scenario, it is\npainful to note that the decision in\nUma Devi\n\n(Supra) has not been properly understood and\nrather wrongly applied by various State\nGovernments. We have called for the data in the\ninstant case to ensure as to how many employees\nwere working on contract basis or ad-hoc basis or\ndaily-wage basis in different State departments.\n\nWe can take judicial notice that widely aforesaid\npractice is being continued. Though this Court has\nemphasised that incumbents should be appointed\non regular basis as per rules but new devise of\nmaking appointment on contract basis has been\nadopted, employment is offered on daily wage\nbasis etc. in exploitative forms. This situation was\nnot envisaged by\nUma Devi\n(supra). The prime\nintendment of the decision was that the\nemployment process should be by fair means and\nnot by back door entry and in the available pay\nscale.\n\nThat spirit of the\nUma Devi\n(supra) has been\nignored and conveniently over looked by various\nState Governments/ authorities.\n\nWe regretfully\nmake the observation that\nUma Devi\n(supra) has\nnot be implemented in its true spirit and has not\nbeen followed in its pith and substance. It is being\nused only as a tool for not regularizing the services\nof incumbents.\n\nThey are being continued in service\nwithout payment of due salary for which they are\nentitled on the basis of\nArticle 14\n, 16\nread\nwith\nArticle 34 (1)(d)\nof the Constitution of India as\nif they have no constitutional protection as\nenvisaged in\nD.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n, AIR\n1983 SC 130 from cradle to grave. In heydays of\nlife they are serving on exploitative terms with no\nguarantee of livelihood to be continued and in old\nage they are going to be destituted, there being no\nprovision for pension, retiral benefits etc. There is\nclear contravention of constitutional provisions and\naspiration of down trodden class. They do have\nequal rights and to make them equals they require\nprotection and cannot be dealt with arbitrarily. The\nkind of treatment meted out is not only bad but\nequally unconstitutional and is denial of rights.\n\nWe\nhave to strike a balance to really implement the\n\nPage 37 of 50\n\nideology of\nUma Devi\n(supra).\n\nThus, the time has\ncome to stop the situation where\nUma Devi\n(supra)\ncan be permitted to be flouted, whereas, this Court\nhas interdicted such employment way back in the\nyear 2006.\n\nThe employment cannot be on\nexploitative terms, whereas\nUma Devi\n(supra) laid\ndown that there should not be back door entry and\nevery post should be filled by regular employment,\nbut a new device has been adopted for making\nappointment on payment of paltry system on\ncontract/adhoc basis or otherwise.\n\nThis kind of\naction is not permissible, when we consider the\npith and substance of true spirit in\nUma Devi\n\n(supra).\n\n18. In Rajnish Kumar Mishra, mentioned\n\nsupra, the three-Judge Bench of the apex Court in\n\nparagraphs-12 and 16 of the judgment held as follows:\n\n\"12. The learned counsel further submits, that this\nCourt in the case of\nSheo Narain Nagar & Ors. vs.\nState of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.1\n, after considering\nthe judgment of this Court in Secretary, State of\nKarnataka & Ors. vs. 1 (2018) 13 SCC 432 {Civil\nAppeal No.18510 of 2017 [@ SLP(C)\nNo.6183/2015]} Umadevi (3) & Ors.2 wherein it\nwas observed that as a onetime measure the\nemployer should take steps for regularisation of the\nservices of the employees who had put in service of\n10 years or more and had directed regularization of\nthe appellants therein. The learned counsel further\nsubmits, that the appeals deserve to be allowed\nand the impugned order deserves to be quashed\nand set aside.\n\n16. It is further to be noted that similarly\ncircumstanced employees in the employment of the\nState of Uttar Pradesh, who were appointed on\ndaily wages/contractual basis had approached the\nAllahabad High Court praying for regularization of\ntheir services. The Single Judge had dismissed the\n\nPage 38 of 50\n\nwrit petitions which orders were affirmed by the\nDivision Bench. The said employees therein had\napproached this Court by way of Civil Appeal\nNo.18510 of 2017 (arising out of Special Leave\nPetition (Civil) No.6183 of 2015) in the case of Sheo\nNarain Nagar cited supra. It will be relevant to refer\nto the following observations of this Court in the\ncase of\nSheo Narain Nagar\n(supra):\n\n\"The appellants were required to be\nappointed on regular basis as a onetime\nmeasure, as\nlaid down in\nparagraph 53 of\n\nUmadevi\n(supra). Since the appellants had\ncompleted 10 years of service and temporary\nstatus had been given by the respondents\nwith retrospective effect in the 02.10.2002,\nwe direct that the services of the appellants\nbe regularized from the said date i.e.\n02.10.2002, consequential benefits and the\narrears of pay also to be paid to the\nappellants within a period of three months\nfrom today.\"\n\n19. The apex Court in\nVice Chancellor\n\nAnand Agriculture University v. Kanubhai\n\nNanubhai Vaghela\n, (in Civil Appeal No. 4443 of 2021,\n\narising out of SLP (C) No. 12171 of 2019) was pleased to\n\nextend benefit to the daily wager for regularization on\n\nconfirming the judgment passed by the Gujarat High\n\nCourt.\n\n20. In view of the order passed by the\n\ntribunal in Jatin Kumar Das, mentioned supra, which\n\nPage 39 of 50\n\nwas confirmed by this Court, benefit has already been\n\nextended to the Data Entry Operators working in\n\ndifferent departments of the Government. Similarly,\n\npursuant to order passed by this Court in Surendra\n\nKumar Das vs. State of Odisha (W.P.(C) No. 21188 of\n\n2013) and Umesh Chandra Ghadei vs. State of\n\nOdisha (W.P.(C) No. 1666 of 2014) regularization has\n\nbeen made in their cases.\n\n21. In Biswamitra Parida, mentioned supra,\n\nthe order having been confirmed by the apex Court,\n\nbenefit has already been extended to the petitioners in\n\nthe said case.\n\n22. In Biswamitra Parida, mentioned supra,\n\nthe State had taken a stand in the apex Court to the\n\nfollowing effect:\n\n\"However, the Hon‟ble Court committed a manifest\nmiscarriage of justice by passing the impugned\norder dated 10.02.2021 failed to appreciate the\nmerit of the case and dismissed W.A. No. 822 of\n2020. Hence, the Petitioners herein have preferred\nto file the present Special Leave Petition on the\nfollowing grounds amongst others;\n\nPage 40 of 50\n\nFirstly, the Hon‟ble High Court committed gross\nmiscarriage of justice by ignoring that the\nregularization of the Respondents would be\nagainst the Resolution dated 17.09.2013 issued\nby the Government in General Administration\nDepartment and subsequent Resolution issued on\n16.01.2014 and Letter dated 14.03.2018 of the\nGovt. Circular dated 14.03.2018 of the\nGovernment as well as the Odisha Group-C and\nGroup-D posts (contractual appointment) Rules,\n2013.\n\nSecondly, The Hon‟ble High Court ignored what\nhas been held by this Hon‟ble Apex Court in the\ncase of\nState of Rajasthan and Ors. V. Dayalal\nand Ors. Reported\nin 2011 (2) SCC 429 wherein\nthis Hon‟ble Court observed as follows:\n\n\" We may at the outset: refer to the following\nwell settled principles relating to\nregularization and parity in pay, relevant in\ncontext of these appeals.\n\n(i) High Courts in exercising the power\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\nwill not issue directions for\nregularization, absorption or\npermanent continuance, unless the\nemployee claiming regularization had\nbeen appointed in pursuance of\nregular recruitment in accordance\nwith relevant Rules in an open\ncompetitive process, against\nsanctioned vacant post. The equality\nclause contained in\nArticle 14\n\n& 16\n\nshould be scrupulously followed and\ncourts should not Issue a direction for\nregularization of service of an\nemployee which would be violative of\nconstitutional scheme. While\nsomething that is irregular for want of\ncompliance with one of the elements\nin the process of selection which does\nnot go to the roof of the process, can\nbe regularized, back door entries,\n\nPage 41 of 50\n\nappointment contrary to the\nconstitutional scheme and/or\nappointment of ineligible candidates\ncannot be regularized.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by an\ntemporary or adhoc or daily wage\nemployee, under cover of some interim\norders of the Court would not confer\nupon him any right to be absorbed\ninto service as such service would be\n„litigious employment‟. Ever\ntemporary, adhoc or daily wage\nservice for a long number of years, let\nalone service for one or two years, will\nnot entitle such employee to claim\nregularization, if he is not working\nagainst a sanctioned post. Sympathy\nand sentiments cannot be grounds for\npassing any order of regularization in\nthe absence of a legal right.\"\n\nThirdly, that the Hon‟ble High Court failed to\nconsider the conditions reflected in the order of\nappointment of the Respondents wherein it was\nclearly stipulated that the appointment is on\ncontractual basis and no claim for regularization\nwill be entertained. Moreover, the Respondents\nherein accepted the said condition while joining as\nJr. Data Entry Operators and hence, they ought to\nhave been stopped from claiming regularization by\nthe Courts below when the Respondents herewith\nvoluntarily accepted the said condition. Therefore,\nthe impugned order passed by the Hon‟ble High\nCourt is non-est in the eyes of law. The submission\nfinds its strength from the decision of this Hon‟ble\nCourt in the\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC 1.\n\nFourthly, the Hon‟ble High Court exceeded their\njurisdiction in passing the order when the decision\nof regularization, absorption etc. was a decision\npurely in the hands of the Petitioners, i.e., the\nexecutive and the Courts had no right to encroach\nupon the same by passing a direction directing the\n\nPage 42 of 50\n\nregularization of the Respondents in contravention\nto the mandatory requirement of facing the\nselection process as provided for in the rules\nframed by the Petitioner No.1. The strength of this\nsubmission arises from the decision of this Hon‟ble\nCourt in the case of Indian Drugs &\nPharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Workmen, reported I\n(2007) 1 SCC 408 wherein it was held that :\n\n\" 37. Creation and abolition of posts and\nregularization are purely executive functions\nvide\nP.U. Joshi v. Accountant General\n[\n(2002) 2 SCC 632 : 2003 SCC ( L & S) 191].\n\nHence, the Court cannot create a post where\nnone exists. Also, we cannot issue any\ndirection to absorb the respondents or\ncontinue them in service, or pay them\nsalaries of regular employees, as these are\npurely executive functions. This Court\ncannot arrogate to itself the powers of the\nexecutive or legislature. There is broad\nseparation of powers under the Constitution,\nas the judiciary, too, must know its limits.\"\n\nThereby, the contentions, which are being raised now,\n\nhad been raised in Biswamitra Parida (supra) by the\n\nState before the apex Court. By dismissing such SLP,\n\nthe stand taken has been negatived. As such, benefit\n\nhas been extended to Biswamitra Parida. Thereby, the\n\nopposite parties cannot raise similar question before\n\nthis Court. In other words, the same cannot be taken\n\ninto consideration at this stage to deprive the legitimate\n\nclaim of the petitioners.\n\nPage 43 of 50\n\n23. In Rajendra Kumar Nayak, mentioned\n\nsupra, this Court directed the opposite parties to\n\nregularize the service of the petitioner in the said case\n\nand grant all consequential service benefits as due and\n\nadmissible to the post held by him. In compliance of the\n\nsaid direction, the service of the Rajendra Kumar Nayak\n\nhas already been regularized and he has already been\n\nextended with the benefits.\n\n24.\nIn\nSunil Barik v. State of Odisha\n, 2021\n\n(II) OLR-469, since the petitioner had been discharging\n\nthe duties against a sanctioned vacancy in the post of\n\nbarber with the knowledge of the employer on daily\n\nwage basis for a quite long time, and his engagement\n\nwas due to the emergent situation, this Court directed\n\nfor regularization of his service with all consequential\n\nbenefits.\n\n25. So far as applicability of the case of\n\nUniversity of Delhi, mentioned supra, as relied on by\n\nMr. H.M. Dhal, learned Additional Government\n\nPage 44 of 50\n\nAdvocate for the State opposite parties, to the present\n\ncase is concerned, factually the same is distinguishable.\n\nThe fact in the case of University of Delhi is that by\n\ncommunication dated 31.08.1999 the UGC imposed a\n\nban on filling up of non-teaching posts in all\n\ninstitutes/universities and affiliated colleges. On\n\n12.01.2011, the UGC sanctioned and allowed the\n\nUniversity to fill up 255 posts of Junior Assistants.\n\nAccordingly, by amending rules, an advertisement was\n\npublished on 06.11.2013 inviting applications for filling\n\nup 255 posts of Junior Assistants in the University.\n\nHowever, for the period from 2003 to 2013 various\n\nappointments were made by the University on contract\n\nbasis, as a result of which about 300 Junior Assistants\n\nare presently in the employment of the University on\n\ncontract basis, most of whom are members of the\n\nUnion.\n\nSoon after the advertisement dated\n\n06.11.2013, the Delhi University Contract Employees\n\nPage 45 of 50\n\nUnion and others filed Writ Petition (C) No.7929 of\n\n2013 before the Delhi High Court seeking regularization\n\nof services of members of the union. Learned Single\n\nJudge of Delhi High Court, vide order dated\n\n16.12.2013, rejected the said writ petition relying upon\n\nthe judgment of the apex Court in\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra).\n\nAgainst the said order, the Delhi University Contract\n\nEmployees Union preferred LPA No.989 of 2013 before\n\nthe Division Bench of the Delhi High Court.\n\nAccordingly, the Division Bench vide judgment dated\n\n22.11.2016 allowed the writ appeal and the University\n\nwas directed to design and hold an appropriate test for\n\nselection in terms of the notification dated 06.11.2013.\n\nChallenging the said order of Division\n\nBench, Delhi University filed Civil appeal No.1007 of\n\n2021 and the Union also preferred an appeal and the\n\nsame is numbered as Civil Appeal No. 1008 of 2021\n\narising out of SLP (C) No. 4906 of 2021. The apex Court\n\nconfirmed the judgment passed by the learned Single\n\nPage 46 of 50\n\nJudge holding as one time measure, the regularization\n\nhas to be made in terms of the judgment in\nUmadevi\n\n(3) (supra).\n\nBut by the time\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra) came\n\ninto effect, the employees had put in 3 to 4 years of\n\nservice on contract basis. Though benefit of\n\nregularization cannot be granted, a window of\n\nopportunity must be given to them to compete with the\n\navailable talent through public advertisement. But the\n\npetitioners in the instant case have been appointed\n\nthrough a process of selection and, as such, they are\n\ncontinuing for more than 6 years and their services\n\nhave to be regularized in terms of G.A. Department\n\nResolution dated 17.09.2013. Thereby, factually and\n\nlegally the judgment of Delhi University is\n\ndistinguishable and, as such, the same is not\n\napplicable to the present case.\n\n26. The decision taken by the Government on\n\n16.03.2020 in Annexure-17 as well as Finance\n\nDepartment memorandum dated 07.07.2020 in\n\nPage 47 of 50\n\nAnnexure-19 has no application to the present context,\n\nas the petitioners are governed by the Government\n\nresolution dated 17.09.2013 and they have completed\n\nsix years of service and continuing against the\n\nsanctioned post by following due process of selection,\n\nfor which they are entitled to formal order of\n\nregularization, as they are deemed to be regularized in\n\nservice.\n\n27. Considering from all angels, since the\n\npetitioners have already rendered more than 6 years of\n\nservice, they are deemed to be regularized. Thereby,\n\nonly formal order of regularization has to be issued in\n\nconsonance with the resolution dated 17.09.2013\n\npassed by the authority. Otherwise also they have\n\ncompleted ten years of service, having been appointed\n\nby the authorities against sanctioned posts by following\n\ndue process of selection, and continued by them\n\nvoluntarily, their services are to be regularized in terms\n\nof judgments of the apex Court, as discussed above.\n\nPage 48 of 50\n\nFurthermore, when services of similarly situated\n\npersons have been regularized in other departments,\n\nthe petitioners cannot be deprived of such benefit on\n\nthe caprice and whims of the authority concerned and\n\nsuch action of the State and its instrumentalities\n\ncannot sustain in the eye of law.\n\n28. In view of the factual and legal aspects, as\n\ndiscussed above, this Court is of the considered view\n\nthat the services of the petitioners should be regularized\n\nby issuing formal letters of regularization in terms of the\n\nG.A. Department letter dated 17.09.2013, as they have\n\nalready completed 6 years of service, on being appointed\n\nagainst sanctioned posts by following due procedure of\n\nselection. Otherwise also they having completed more\n\nthan ten years of service, on being employed and\n\ncontinued by the authorities, in terms of the judgments\n\nof the apex Court, as discussed above, their services are\n\nalso to be regularized. Accordingly, this Court directs\n\nthe opposite parties to regularize the services of the\n\nPage 49 of 50\n\npetitioners and grant them all consequential service and\n\nfinancial benefits in accordance with law as\n\nexpeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of\n\ntwo months from the date of communication of this\n\njudgment.\n\n29. In the result, the writ petition is allowed.\n\nBut, however, there shall be no order as to costs.\n\n..............................\n\nDR. B.R.
