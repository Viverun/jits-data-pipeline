A.I. Operating\ninternational flights and the I.A.C. Operating domestic\nflights within the country.\nAir Hostesses employed by Air India were governed by\nRegulations 46 and 47 of Air India Employees Service\nRegulations and the Air Hostesses employed by l.A.C. were\ngoverned by the Indian Airlines Service, Regulation No. 12.\nA.H. under A.I. was retired from service in the following\ncontingencies:\n(a) On attaining the age of 35 years;\n(b) On marriage if it took place within four years of the\nservice; and\n(c) On first pregnancy.\nThe age of retirement of AH could be extended upto ten\nyears by granting yearly extensions at the option of the\nManaging Director. If the Managing Director chose to\nexercise his discretion under Regulation 47 an AH could\nretire at the age of 45 years.\nA.H. under I.A.C. was governed by similar service\nconditions except that the age of retirement of permanent\nAHs could be extended upto 40 years.\nIn their transferred case and writ petitions, it was\ncontended on behalf of the A.H. that the Air Hostess\nemployed by one corporation or the other from the same class\nof service as the AFPs and other members of the cabin crew,\nperforming identical or similar duties and hence any\ndiscrimination made between these two employees who are\nsimilarly circumstanced was clearly violative of\nArt. 14\n,\n(2)\nThere was an inter sc discrimination between the AHs\nposted in the United Kingdom and those serving in the other\nAir India flights (3) the AHs have been particularly\nselected for hostile discrimination by the Corporation\nmainly on the ground of sex or disabilities arising from sex\nand, therefore, the regulations amount to a clear infraction\nof the provisions of\nArt. 15(1)\nand\nArt. 16(4).\nThe\ntermination of the services of AHs on the ground of\npregnancy or marriage within four years is manifestly\nunreasonable wholly arbitrary and violative of\nArt. 14 (5).\n\n(6) Apart from discrimination regarding the age of\nretirement, AHs have been completely deprived of promotional\nopportunities available to the male members of the cabin\ncrew.\nThe Management contested the petitions by contending:\n(1) Having regard to the nature of job functions, the mode\nof recruitment of AHs, their qualifications, their\npromotional avenues and the circumstances in which they\nretire, AHs fall within a category separate from the class\nto which the pursers belong and there can be no question of\ndiscrimination or contravention of\nArt. 14\nwhich would apply\nif there is discrimination between the members of the same\nclass inter se. (2) The recruitment of the AHs is actually\nsex based recruitment made not on the ground of sex alone\nbut swayed by a lot of other considerations and hence\nArt.\n15 (2)\nof the Constitution is not attracted. (3) Regulation\n46 of the A.I. Regulations and the IAC\nRegulation 12\nhave\nbeen upheld by the Khosla and Mahesh Awards. They have\nstatutory force and unless they are per se arbitrary or\ndiscriminatory the Court ought not to interfere with them\nparticularly when those two Awards are binding on the\nparties. (4) Having regard to the circumstances prevailing\nin India and the effects of marriage the bar of pregnancy\nand marriage is undoubtedly a reasonable restriction placed\nin public interest. (5) If the bar of marriage or pregnancy\nis removed it will lead to\nhuge practical difficulties as a result of which very heavy\nexpenditure would have to be incurred by the Corporations to\nmake arrangements.\nPartly allowing the petitions,\n^\nHELD: 1(i). The impugned provisions appear to be a\nclear case of official arbitrariness. As the impugned part\nof the regulation is severable from the rest of the\nregulation, it is not necessary to strike down the entire\nregulation. [491 A]\n(ii) That part of Regulation 47 which gives option to\nthe Managing Director to extend the service of an AH is\nstruck down. The effect of striking down this provision\nwould be that an AH, unless the provision is suitably\namended to bring it, in conformity with the provisions of\n\nArt. 14\nwould continue to retire at the age of 45 years and\nthe Managing Director would be bound to grant yearly\nextensions as a matter of course for a period of ten years\nif the AH is found to be medically fit. This will prevent\nthe Managing Director from discriminating between one AH and\nanother. [501 A-B]\n(iii). The last portion of regulation 46 (i) (c) struck\ndown. The provision 'or on first pregnancy whichever occurs\nearlier' is unconstitutional, void and violative of\nArticle\nof the Constitution and will, therefore, stand deleted.\nIt will, however, be open to the Corporation to make\nsuitable amendments. [491B]\n2. It is undisputed that what\nArt. 14\nprohibits is\nhostile discrimination and not reasonable classification. If\nequals and unequals are differently treated, there is no\ndiscrimination so as to amount to an infraction of\nArt. 14\n\nof the Constitution. A fortiori if equals or persons\nsimilarly circumstanced are differently treated,\ndiscrimination results so as to attract the provisions of\n\nArt. 14.\n\n[456 G-H, 457 A]\n3. If there are two separate and different classes\nhaving different conditions of service and different\nincidents the question of discrimination does not arise. On\nthe other hand, if among the members of the same class,\ndiscriminatory treatment is meted out to one against the\nother,\nArt. 14\nis doubtless attracted. [457 A-B]\n4. The following propositions emerge from an analysis\nand examination of cases decided by this Court:\n(1) In considering the fundamental right or equality of\nopportunity a technical, pedantic or doctrinaire approach\nshould not be made and the doctrine should not be invoked\neven if different scales of pay service terms, leave, etc.\nare introduced in different or dissimilar posts. [462 G-H,\n463 A]\nThus where the class or categories of service are\nessentially different in purport and spirit,\nArt. 14\ncannot\nbe attracted. [463 B]\n(2)\nArt. 14\nforbids hostile discrimination but not\nreasonable classification. Thus, where persons belonging to\na particular class in view of their special attributes,\nqualities, mode of recruitment and the like, are differently\ntreated in public interest to advance and boost members\nbelonging to backward classes,\nhaving a close nexus with the objects sought to be achieved\n\nArt. 14\nwill be A completely out of the way. [463 B-D]\n(3)\nArt. 14\ncertainly applies where equals are treated\ndifferently without any reasonable basis. [466 D]\n(4) Where equals and unequals are treated differently\n\nArt. 14\nwould have no application. [466 E]\n(5) Even if there be one class of service having\nseveral categories with different attributes and incidents,\nsuch a category becomes a separate class by itself and no\ndifference or discrimination between such category and the\ngeneral members of the other class would amount to any\ndiscrimination or to denial of equality of opportunity.\n[466 F-F]\n(6) In order to judge whether a separate category has\nbeen carved out of a class of service, the following\ncircumstances have generally to be examined:-\n(a) the nature, the mode and the manner of recruitment\nof a particular category from the very start.\n(b) the classifications of the particular category.\n(c) the terms and conditions of service of the members\nof the category;\n(d) the nature and character of the posts and\npromotional avenues;\n(e) the special attributes that the particular category\npossess which are not to be found in other classes, and the\nlike. [463 F-H, 464 A-B]\nIt is however difficult to lay down a rule of universal\napplication but the circumstances mentioned above may be\ntaken to be illustrative guidelines for determining the\nquestion.

James Griggs Raines, 4 L Ed 2d 524\nreferred to.\n5. A comparison of the mode of recruitment, the\nclassification, the promotional avenues and other matters\nindicate that the AHs form an absolutely separate category\nfrom AFPs in many respects having different service\nconditions. Finally, even though the AHs retire at the age\nof 35 (extendable to 45) they get retiral benefits quite\ndifferent from those available to the AFPs. [468 D-F]\n6. Having regard to the various circumstances,\nincidents, service conditions, promotional avenues, etc. of\nthe AFPs the members of the cabin crew are an entirely\nseparate class governed by different set of rules\nregulations and conditions of service. [471 B-C]\n7. The declaration made by the Central Government by\nits notification dated 15-6-79 is presumptive proof of\nservice and other types of remuneration, no discrimination\nhas been made on the ground of sex only. [475 C]\n8. What\nArticle 15(1)\nand\n16(2)\nlay down is that\ndiscrimination should not be made only and only on the\nground of sex. These Articles do not prohibit the State from\nmaking discrimination on the ground of sex coupled with\nother considerations. [475 D]\nYusuf Abdul Aziz v. The State of Bombay and Husseinbhoy\nLaljee [1954] SCR 930, Miss C.B. Muthamma v. U.O.I and Ors.\n[1979] 4 SCC 260 referred to.\n9. The argument on behalf of the AHs that the\nconditions of service with regard to retirement, etc. amount\nto discrimination on the ground of sex only is overruled.\nThe conditions of service indicated are not violative of\n\nArt. 16.\n\n[476 B-C]\n10. There is no unreasonableness or arbitrariness in\nthe provisions of the Regulations which necessitate that\nAlls should not marry within four years of the service\nfailing which their services will have to be terminated.\n[480G.H,481A]\n11. Having taken the AH in service and after having\nutilised her services for four years to terminate her\nservice by the Management if she becomes pregnant amounts to\ncompelling the poor AH not to have any children and thus\ninterfere with and divert the ordinary course of human\nnature. The termination of the services of an AH under such\ncircumstances is not only a callous and cruel act but an\nopen insult to Indian womanhood the most sacrosanct and\ncherished institution. Such a course of action is extremely\ndetestable and abhorrent to the notions of a civilised\nsociety. Apart from being grossly unethical, it smacks of a\ndeep rooted sense of utter selfishness at the cost of all\nhuman values. Such a provision is not only manifestly\nunreasonable and arbitrary but contains the quality of\nunfairness and exhibits naked depotism and is clearly\nviolative of\nArt. 14.\n[481 G-H, 482 A-C]\n13. The rule could be suitably amended so as to\nterminate the services of an AH on third pregnancy provided\ntwo children are alive which would be both salutary and\nreasonable for two reasons. In the first place, the\nprovision preventing third pregnancy with two existing\nchildren would be in the larger interest of the health of\nthe AH concerned as also for the good upbringing of the\nchildren. Secondly it will not only be desirable but\nabsolutely essential for every country to see that the\nfamily planning programme is not only whipped up but\nmaintained at sufficient levels.

[1954] SCR 803 & Maneka Gandhi v Union of\nIndia [1978] 2 SCR 621 referred to.\n13. Whether the woman after bearing children would\ncontinue in service or would find it difficult to look after\nthe children is her personal matter and a problem which\naffects the AH concerned and the Corporation has nothing to\ndo with the same. These are circumstances which happen in\nthe normal course of business and cannot be helped. In these\ncircumstances, the reasons given for imposing the bar are\nneither logical nor convincing. [489 C-E]\n14. The factors to be considered must be relevant and\nbear a close nexus to the nature of the organisation and the\nduties of the employees. Where the authority concerned takes\ninto account factors or circumstances which are inherently\nirrational or illogical or tainted, the decision fixing the\nage of retirement is open to serious scrutiny. [492 E-F]\n15. In the present times with advancing mechanical\ntechnology it may not be very correct to say that a woman\nloses her normal facilities or that her efficiency is\nimpaired at the age of 35, 40 or 45 years. It is difficult\nto generalise a proposition like this which will have to\nvary from individual to individual. On the other hand, there\nmay be cases where an AFP may be of so weak and unhealthy a\nconstitution that he may not be able to function upto the\nage of 58 which is the age of retirement of AFP according to\nthe Regulation. The distinction regarding the age of\nretirement made by Regulation between AGs and AFPs cannot be\nsaid to be discriminatory because AGs have been held to be a\nseparate class. [495 B-E]\n16. The fixation of the age of retirement of AHs who\nfall within a special class depends on various factors which\nhave to be taken into consideration by employers. [496 F]\nIn the instant case, the Corporations have placed good\nmaterial to show some justification for keeping the age of\nretirement at 35 years (extendable upto 45 years) but the\nregulation seems to arm the Managing Director with\nuncanalised and unguided discretion to extend the age of AHs\nat this option which appears to suffer from the vice of\nexcessive delegation of powers. A discretionary power may\nnot necessarily be a discriminatory power but where a\nstatute confers a power on an authority to decide matters of\nmoment without laying down any guidelines or principles or\nnorms the power has to be struck down as being violative of\nArt.

Mathur and Shri Narain for Respondent No. 1.\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAZAL ALI, J. Transferred Case No. 3 of 1981 and the\nwrit petitions filed by the petitioners raise common\nconstitutional and legal questions and we propose to decide\nall these cases by one\ncommon judgment. So far as Transferred Case No. 3/81 is\nconcerned, it arises out of writ petition No. 1186/1980\nfiled by Nergesh Meerza & ors. Respondent No. 1 (Air India)\nmoved this Court for transfer of the writ petition filed by\nthe petitioners, Nergesh Meerza & Ors. in the Bombay High\nCourt to this Court because the constitutional validity of\nRegulation 46(1) (c) of Air India Employees Service\nRegulations (hereinafter referred to as 'A.I. Regulations')\nand other questions of law were involved. Another ground\ntaken by the applicant-Air India in the transfer petition\nwas that other writ petitions filed by the Air Hostesses\nemployed by the Indian Airlines Corporation (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"I.A.C.\") which were pending hearing in this\nCourt involved almost identical reliefs. After hearing the\ntransfer petition this Court by its order dated 21.1.81\nallowed the petition and directed that the transfer petition\narising out of writ petition No. 1186/80 pending before the\nBombay High Court be transferred to this Court. By a later\norder dated 23.3.1981 this Court directed that the\nTransferred case may be heard alongwith other writ\npetitions. Hence, all these matters have been placed before\nus for hearing. For the purpose of brevity, the various\npetitions, orders, rules, etc. shall be referred to as\nfollows:-\n\n(1) Air India as \"A.I.\"\n\n(2) Indian Airlines Corporation as \"I.A.C.\"\n(3) Statutory regulations made under the Air India\nCorporation Act of 1953 or the Indian Airlines\nCorporation Act of 1953 would be referred to as\n'A.I. Regulation' and 'I.A.C. Regulation'\nrespectively.\n\n(4) Nergesh Meerza & Ors. as 'petitioners'.\n(5) Declaration by the Central Government under\nEqual\nRemuneration Act\nas \"Declaration\" and\nEqual\nRemuneration Act\n1976 as '1976 Act'.\n\n(6)\nAir Corporation Act\nof 1953 as '1953 Act.'\n(7) Justice Khosla Award as 'Khosla Award' and Justice\nMahesh Chandra Award as 'Mahesh Award'.\n(8) Assistant Flight Pursers as 'AFPs'\n(9) Air Hostess as 'A.H.'.and.Air Hostesses a 'AHs'.\n(10) Air India Cabin Crew. as 'A.I. Crew' and Indian\nAirlines Corporation Cabin Crew as 'IAC Crew'\n(11) Flight Steward as \"F.S.\"\n\nBefore dealing with the facts of the case and the\ncentral constitutional controversies and substantial points\nof law involved in these petitions, it may be necessary to\ngive a brief survey of the history which laid to the\nformation of the two Corporations, viz., A.I. and I.A.C.\nBy virtue of s. 3 of the 1953 Act, the Central\nGovernment by a notification published in the official\nGazette created two Corporations known as Indian Airlines\nand Air India International.\nSection 3(2)\nprovided that each\nof the two Corporations would be a body corporate having\nperpetual succession and a common seal subject to the\nprovisions of the Act to acquire and hold property.\nSection\nof the 1953 Act provides for the constitution of the\nCorporations and\nsection 5\ndeals with the conditions of\nservice of the Chairman and other Directors of the\nCorporations.\nSection 7\ndefines the various functions of the\nCorporations. Further details regarding the provisions of\ns.\nwould be dealt with later wherever necessary.\nSection 8\n\ndeals with the appointment of the officers and other\nemployees of the Corporations.\nSections 10\nto\ndeal with\nfinance, accounts and audit.\nSection 34\ndefines the control\nwhich. the Central Government may exercise over the\nperformance by the Corporation of its functions. The other\nprovisions of the 1953 Act are not germane for the purpose\nof this case.\n\nIt is manifest therefore from a perusal of the various\nprovisions of the 1953 Act that A.I. and I.A.C. were\nestablished as a single entity which was divided into two\nunits in view of the nature of the duties that each\nCorporation had to perform. We have mentioned this fact\nparticularly because one of the contentions of Mr. Nariman,\ncounsel for A.I., was that A.I. itself was a separate and\ndistinct entity and could not be equated with I.A.C. The\nprovisions of the Act completely nullify this argument and\nclearly show that the two Corporations formed one single\nunit to be controlled by the Central Government under the\n1953 Act. It may be that the two Corporations may have\ndifferent functions to perform-A.I. Operating international\nflights and the other (IAC) operating domestic\nflights within the country. This fact alone, however, would\nnot make the two Corporations absolutely separate entities.\nThe two Corporations were part of the same organisation set\nup by the 1953 Act. This fact is fortified by subsequent\nevents such as when disputes arose between the employees of\nthe two Corporations, the dispute with respect to A.I. was\nreferred to Justice Khosla and formed the basis of the\nKhosla Award. Similarly, dispute between the I.A.C. and its\nemployees was referred to Justice Mahesh Chandra where A.I.\nfiled an application on behalf of the Air Corporation\nEmployees Union (ACEU). The aforesaid Union represented both\nthe A.T. and I.A.C. A prayer of the ACEU was allowed by the\nTribunal by its order dated 1.3.1971 (vide p. 1191 of the\nGazette of India-\nSec. 3(ii)\ndated 25.3.72) for being\nimpleaded as a party to the Reference. As a result of the\nallowing of the application of the ACEU the scope of the\nReference was widened to include the demands of I.A.C. &\nA.I. This, therefore, clearly shows that the two\nCorporations formed one single entity and whenever any\ndispute arose they tried to get the dispute settled by a\ncommon agency. Thus, the two Corporations before the\nIndustrial Tribunals did not take any stand that they were\ndifferent entities having two separate individualities. The\ninitial argument of Mr. Nariman on this point is, therefore,\noverruled at the threshold. In fact, Mr. Nariman having\nindicated the point did not choose to pursue it further\nbecause the sheetanchor of his argument was that so far as\nAHs in the two organisations are concerned they constitute a\nsex-based recruitment and, therefore, a completely separate\nand different category from the class of AFPs, in that,\ntheir service conditions, the mode of recruitment, the\nemoluments, the age of retirement of these two classes were\nquite different and, therefore, the question of the\napplicability of\nArt. 14\ndid not arise. We may have to\ndilate on this part of the argument a little later when we\nexamine the respective contentions advanced before us by the\ncounsel for the parties. At the moment, we would like first\nto complete the history of the circumstances leading to the\npresent controversy between the parties. It appears that\nthere was a good deal of disparity between the pay-scales\nand the promotional avenues of the male cabin crew\nconsisting of AFPs, FPs and In-flight pursers on the one\nhand and the AHs, Check AH, Deputy Chief AH, Addl. Chief AH\nand Chief AH on the other. The case of the AHs was sponsored\nby the ACEU which made a demand for alteration of the\nservice regulations prejudicial to AHs. This was some time\nprior to 1964. The said dispute was ultimately referred to a\nNational Industrial Tribunal presided over by Mr. Justice\nG.D. Khosla\nwho gave his award on 28.7.1965 making some recommendations\nin order to improve the service conditions of AHs.\n\nIn fact, the main issue canvassed before the Khosla\nTribunal centered round the question of the age of\nretirement of the AHs and matters connected therewith. A\nperusal of the Khosla Award shows that the parties entered\ninto a settlement with respect to all other disputes\nexcepting the retirement benefits on which the Tribunal had\nto give its award. In para 252 of the Award the dispute\nregarding the retirement age is mentioned thus:\n\n\"252. At present, the retirement age of the Air\nIndia employees is governed by Service Regulations Nos.\n46 and 47. Service Regulation No. 46 is as follows:\n\n46. Retirement Age:\n\n... ... ... ...\n\n(C) An Air Hostess, upon attaining the age of 30 years\nor on marriage, whichever occurs earlier.\n\n... ... ... ...\n\n253. Regulation No. 47 provides for a further\nextension of the employee beyond the age of retirement\nfor an aggregate period not exceeding two years except\nin the case of Air Hostesses where the services can be\nextended upto a period of 5 years. The extension is\ngranted on the employee being found medically fit.\"\n\nThus, according to the Regulations prevalent in A.I. an\nAH had to retire at the age of 30 or on marriage whichever\nwas earlier subject to an extension being granted for a\nperiod of 5 years if the employee was found to be medically\nfit. While considering this demand, the Tribunal seems to\nhave upheld the view of the Corporation and found no reason\nto interfere with Regulation Nos. 46 and 47. In this\nconnection, the Tribunal observed as follows:-\n\n\"In my view, no case has been made out for raising\nthe age of retirement and in cases where the efficiency\nof the employee is not impaired, there is suitable\nprovision\nunder regulation 47 for extending his service upto the\nage of 60. As observed above, there have been no\ncomplaints of any employee being made to retire under\nthe provision of clause (ii) of regulation 46.\"\n\nGiving the reasons for its conclusion the Award in Para\n256 runs thus:-\n\n\"With regard to air hostesses, the contention of\nthe Management is that they are in a special class.\nThey have to deal with passengers of various\ntemperaments, and a young and attractive air hostess is\nable to cope with difficult or awkward situations more\ncompetently and more easily than an older person with\nless personal prepossessions. On this point there can\nbe no two opinions. It was also pointed out that air\nhostesses do not stay very long in the service of Air\nIndia, and young and attractive women are more inclined\nto look upon service in Air India as a temporary\noccupation than as a career. Most of them get married\nand leave the service. Counsel for the Corporation\nplaced before me a table (Exhibit M 14) which shows\nthat the average service of an air hostess for the 5\nyears between 1960 and 1965 was only two years. Only 2\nair hostesses reached the age of 30. None was retired\nat the age of 30 and in all, 70 air hostesses resigned\nbefore reaching the age of retirement. The total number\nof air hostesses at present is 87 and, therefore, it\nwill at once be seen that most of them chose to leave\nservice of their own free will.\"\n\nIt would thus be seen that one of the dominant factors\nwhich weighed with the Tribunal was that there were only 87\nAHs out of whom quite a large number retired even before\nreaching the age of 30 years. The Tribunal was also\nimpressed by the argument of the Corporation that AH had to\ndeal with passengers of various temperaments and a young\nattractive AH was more suitable for doing the job. With due\nrespect to Justice Khosla we may not agree with some of the\nreasons he had given, but the position has now completely\nchanged as more than 15 years have passed and at present AI\nemployees as many as 737 AHs. However, the matter rested\nthere and the AHs seem to have lost their first battle\nbefore the Khosla Tribunal.\nThereafter, it appears the same dispute arose between\nthe employees of I.A.C. which, as indicated above, had to be\nreferred to another Tribunal, viz. Mahesh Tribunal, before\nwhom a part of the dispute between several workmen was\nsettled but the dispute which was not settled including the\nquestion of the age of retirement of AHs was referred to\nthis Tribunal some time in November 1970 and the Award was\ngiven on 25th February 1972. Before this Tribunal also, the\nstand taken by the ACEU was that the age of retirement of AH\nshould be fixed at 45 instead of 30 or 35 and the bar of\nmarriage should be removed. The A.l., however, stuck to its\noriginal stand that having regard to the strenuous work to\nbe put in by an AH, the age of retirement should be kept at\n\n30. In this connection, the Mahesh Tribunal indicated the\nstand of the parties thus :\n\n\"The ACEU contends that age of retirement of air\nhostesses should be fixed at 45 instead of 30 or 35 as\nat present; that this demand for increase in the age of\nretirement is in accordance with Geneva Convention and\nthat the bar of marriage on air hostesses should be\nremoved.\n\nThe Air India's contention is that the nature and\nunderlying object of the job of an air hostess requires\nthat their age of retirement should be kept at 30 as at\npresent. It has also been pointed out that after 30,\nthe General Manager of the Corporation has the\ndiscretion to extend the age of retirement of an air\nhostess by one year at a time till she reaches the age\nof 40 years. As for the retirement on Marriage, the Air\nIndia's contention is that it is necessary and a\ndesirable provision as otherwise after marriage they\nwill not be able to fulfil adequately the main purpose\nof their employment.\n\nThe rule regarding extension of service in the\nSettlement between the ACEU and the Indian Airlines of\nJanuary 10, 1972 is better worded and it should be\nadopted by the Air India also in its entirety.\"\n\nThis appears to be the position upto the year 1972.\nSubsequent events, however, show that both A.I. and I.A.C.\nIater realised that the Rules regarding the age of\nretirement and termination of AHs\nwork serious injustice and made several amendments. We would\nA first take up the various amendments made by the l.A.C.\nThe previous regulation regarding the retirement age of\nI.A.C. AH was regulation No. 12 which may be extracted\nthus:-\n\n\"Flying Crew shall be retained in the service of\nthe Corporation only for so long as they remain\nmedically fit for flying duties.. Further, an Air\nhostess shall retire from the service of Corporation on\nher attaining the age of 30 years or when she gets\nmarried whichever is earlier. An unmarried Air Hostess\nmay, however, in the interest of the Corporation be\nretained in the service of the Corporation upto the age\nof 35 years with the approval of the General Manager.\"\n\n(Vide counter-affidavit of Wing Commander N.C.\nBharma)\nThis regulation was further amended on 13.7.68 which\nran thus:\n\n\"An Airhostess shall retire from the service of\nthe Corporation on her attaining the age of 30 years or\nwhen she gets married, whichever is earlier. The\nGeneral Manager, may, however, retain in service an\nunmarried Air Hostess upto the age of 35 years.\"\n\nThen followed the Settlement dated 1O.1.1972 between\nthe I.A.C. and ACEU under which AH was to retire at the age\nof 30 or on marriage. The General Manager, however, could\nretain an unmarried AH in service upto the age of 40 years.\nThus, the only difference that the Settlement made was that\nthe discretion to extend the age of retirement of AH was\nincreased by S years, i.e. from 35 years to 40 years.\nUltimately, however, the old Regulation underwent a further\nchange and by virtue of a Notification published in the\nGazette of India on 12.4.1980 in Part Hl,\nSection 4\n, para 3\nof the amended regulation 12 was further amended thus:\n\n\"An Air Hostess shall retire from services of the\nCorporation upon attaining the age of 35 years or on\nmarriage H if it takes place within four years of\nservice or on first pregnancy, whichever occurs\nearlier.\"\nThis amendment seems to have made a slight improvement\nin the condition of service of AHs inasmuch as the age of\nretirement was fixed at 35 years and the bar of marriage was\nrestricted only to a period of four years, that is to say,\nif an AH did not marry within a period of 4 years of her\nentry into service, she could retire at the age of 35. This\namendment was not in supersession of but supplemental to the\nACEU Settlement dated 1O.1.1972. In other words, the\nposition was that an AH if she did not marry within 4 years,\ncould go upto 35 years extendable to 40 years, if found\nmedically fit. This was the historical position so far as\nthe retirement age of AHs working with IAC is concerned. As\nregards AHs employed by AI the latest position is to be\nfound in Regulations 46 and 47, the relevant portions of\nwhich may be extracted thus :-\n\n\"46. Retiring Age:\n\nSubject to the provisions of sub-regulation (ii)\nhereof an employee shall retire from the service of the\nCorporation upon attaining the age of 58 years, except\nin the following cases when he/she shall retire\nearlier:\n\n(c) An Air Hostess, upon attaining the age of 35 years\nor on marriage if it takes place within four years\nof service or on first pregnancy, whichever occurs\nearlier.\n\n47. Extension of Service.\n\nNotwithstanding anything contained in Regulation\n46, the services of any employee, may, at the option of\nthe Managing Director but on the employee being found\nmedically fit, be extended by one year at a time beyond\nthe age of retirement for an aggregate period not\nexceeding two years, except in the case of Air\nHostesses and Receptionists where the period will be\nten years and five years respectively.\"\n\nThus, an AH under A.I. was retired from service in the\nfollowing contingencies:\n\n(1) on attaining the age of 35 years;\n\n(2) on marriage if it took place within 4 years of the\nservice, and\n(3) on first pregnancy.\n\nThe age of retirement of AH could be extended upto ten\nyears by granting yearly extensions at the option of the\nManaging Director. Thus, if the Managing Director chose to\nexercise his discretion under Regulation 47 an AH could\nretire at the age of 45 years.\n\nThus, the only difference regarding the service\nconditions pertaining to the age of retirement or\ntermination is that whereas the services of an I.A.C. AH\ncould be extended upto 4() years, those of the A.I. AH could\nbe extended upto 45 years, subject to the conditions\nindicated above. This appears to be the position regarding\nthe service conditions of the AHs belonging to both the\nCorporations which form the cornerstone of their grievances\nbefore us.\n\nHaving given a brief history of the dispute between the\nparties we would now indicate the contentions advanced\nbefore us by the petitioners (AHs) and the counsel for the\nCorporations and other respondents. As the service\nconditions of AHs employed by the two Corporations are\nalmost identical the arguments put forward by them also are\nalmost the same with slight variations which will be\nindicated by us when we deal with the arguments.\n\nMr. Atul Setalvad appearing for the AHs in Transfer\ncase No. 3 of 1981 has submitted some important and\ninteresting points of law which may to summarised as\nfollows:-\n\n(1) The AHs employed by one Corporation or the other\nform the same class of service as the AFPs and\nother members of the cabin crew. Both the male\npursers and the AHs are members of the same cabin\ncrew, per forming identical or similar duties and\nhence any discrimination made between these two\nmembers who are similarly circumstanced is clearly\nviolative of\nArt. 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n(2) Even if the AHs are a separate category or class,\nthere is an inter se discrimination between the\nAHs posted in the United Kingdom and those serving\nin the other Air India flights.\n\n(3) That the AHs have been particularly selected for\nhostile discrimination by the Corporation mainly\non\nthe ground of sex or disabilities arising from sex\nand therefore, the regulations amount to a clear\ninfraction of the provisions of\nArt. 15 (1)\nand\n\nArt. 16\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n(4) The termination of the services of AHs on the\nground pregnancy or marriage within four years is\nmanifestly unreasonable and wholly arbitrary and\nviolative of\nArt. 14\nof the Constitution and\nshould, therefore, be struck down.\n\n(5) The contention that a woman in view of strenuous\nwork that she is called upon to perform, becomes\ntired or incapable of doing the work of catering\nto the passengers is based on pure speculation and\nbeing against the well established facts and norms\nset up by the Geneva Convention is clearly\ninconsistent with the concept of emancipation of\nwomen. No material has been placed before the\nCourt to prove that the efficiency of the AHs is\nin any way impaired at the age of 40 or 45 years\nso as to make a gross discrimination between the\nmale pursers and AHs.\n\n(6) Apart from the discrimination regarding the age of\nretirement, the AHs have been completely deprived\nof promotional opportunities available to the male\nmembers of the cabin crew.\n\nFor the aforesaid reasons, it was contended that\nregulations 46 and 47 of Air-India Employee's Service\nRegulations and Regulation No. 12 of the Indian Airlines\n(Flying Crew) Service Regulations must be struck down as\nbeing discriminatory and ultra vires.\n\nThe counsel appearing for the petitioners in the writ\npetitions more or less adopted the arguments of Mr. Atul\nSetalvad in one form or the other.\n\nIn answer to the contentions raised by Mr. Setalvad and\nthe counsel who followed him, Mr. Nariman appearing for A.l.\nand Mr G.B. Pai for the l.A.C., adumbrated the following\npropositions:-\n\n(1) That having regard to the nature of job functions,\nthe mode of recruitment of AHs, their\nqualifications,\ntheir promotional avenues and the circumstances in\nA which they retire AHs fall within a category\nseparate from the class to which the pursers\nbelong and if AHs from a separate class or\ncategory by themselves, then there can be no\nquestion of discrimination or contravention of\nArt. 14 which would apply if there is\ndiscrimination between the members of the same,\nclass inter se.\n\n(2) The recruitment of the AHs is actually sex based\nrecruitment made not merely on the ground of sex\nalone but swayed by a lot of other considerations:\n\nhence\nArt. 15 (2)\nof the Constitution was not\nattracted. To buttress this argument reliance was\nplaced by Mr. Nariman on the Declaration made by\nthe Government under the 1976 Act.\n\n(3) As the conditions mentioned in Regulation 46 of\nA.I. Regulations and 12 of the IAC Regulations\nhave been upheld by the Khosla and Mahesh Awards,\nthey have statutory force and unless they are per\nse arbitrary or discriminatory, the court ought\nnot to interfere with them particularly when those\ntwo Awards are binding on the parties even though\ntheir period may have expired.\n\n(4) Having regard to the circumstances prevailing in\nIndia and the effects of marriage, the bar of\npregnancy and marriage is undoubtedly a reasonable\nrestriction placed in public interest.\n(5) If the bar of marriage or pregnancy is removed, it\nwill lead to huge practical difficulties as a\nresult of which very heavy expenditure would have\nto be incurred by the Corporations to make\narrangements for substitutes of the working AHs\nduring their absence for a long period\nnecessitated by pregnancy or domestic needs\nresulting from marriage.\n\n(6) The court should take into consideration the\npractical aspects of the matter which demonstrate\nthe fact that a large number of AHs do not stick\nto the service but leave the same well before the\nage of retirement fixed under the Regulation.\nFinally, as a very fair and conscientious counsel Mr.\nNariman placed a few proposals which might mitigate the\ninconvenience caused to the AHs and remove a large bulk of\ntheir grievances. It was submitted by Mr. Nariman that he\nwould in all probability persuade the management to accept\nthe proposals submitted by him which will be referred to\nwhen we deal with the contentions of the parties at length.\n\nWe shall now proceed to deal with the respective\ncontentions advanced before us indicating the reply of the\nrespondents to the arguments raised by the petitioners.\n\nIt was vehemently argued by Mr. Setalvad that having\nregard to the nature of the duties and functions performed\nduring the flight by AFPs and AHs both the groups constitute\nthe same class or category of service under the Corporation\nand hence any difference or discrimination between the\nmembers in the same class is clearly violative of\nArt. 14\nof\nthe Constitution. A second limb of the argument which flows\nfrom the first contention was that the AHs were selected for\nhostile discrimination by the Corporation in the matter of\nretirement, termination and promotional avenues which was\nmanifestly unreasonable so as to attract\nArt. ]4\nof the\nConstitution.\n\nThe counsel for the Corporation, however, countered the\narguments of the petitioners on two grounds :-\n\n(1) That in view of the mode of recruitment,\nqualifications, retiral benefits and various other\nfactors the AHs constitute a special category or\nclass of employees different from the AFPs and,\ntherefore, they could not be in any way equated\nwith them.\n\n(2) That in fact the recruitment of AHs was sex-based\nland swayed by a number of other considerations\nand not based on sex only.\n\nIn order to appreciate the arguments of the parties on\nthis point it may be necessary to refer to the law on the\nsubject which is now well settled by a long course of\ndecisions of this Court. It is undisputed that what\nArt. 14\n\nprohibits is hostile discrimination and not reasonable\nclassification. In other words, if equals and unequals are\ndifferently treated, no discrimination at all occurs so as\nto amount to an infraction of\nArt. 14\nof the Constitution. A\nfortiori\nif equals or persons similarly circumstanced are differently\ntreated, A discrimination results so as to attract the\nprovisions of\nArt. 14.\n\nIn our opinion, therefore, the inescapable conclusion\nthat follows is that if there are two separate and different\nclasses having different conditions of service and different\nincidents, the question of discrimination does not arise. On\nthe other hand, if among the members of the same class,\ndiscriminatory treatment is meted out to one against the\nother,\nArt. 14\nis doubtless attracted.\n\nIn\nKathi Raning Rawat v. The State of Saurashtra\n(1)\nSastri, C.J. observed thus:\n\n\"Though the differing procedures might involve\ndisparity in the treatment of the persons tried under\nthem, such disparity is not by itself sufficient, in my\nopinion, to outweigh the presumption and establish\ndiscrimination unless the degree of disparity goes\nbeyond what the reason for its existence demands as,\nfor instance, when it amounts to a denial of a fair and\nimpartial trial.\"\n\nFazal Ali J. as he then was, pithily observed as\nfollows :-\n\n\"I think that a distinction should be drawn\nbetween 'discrimination without reason' and\n'discrimination with reason'. The whole doctrine of\nclassification is based on this distinction and on the\nwell-known fact that the circumstances which govern one\nset of persons or objects may not necessarily be the\nsame as those governing another set of persons or\nobjects, so that the question of unequal treatment does\nnot really arise as between persons governed by\ndifferent conditions and different sets of\ncircumstances.\"\n\nSimilar observations were made by Mukherjee, J. who\nremarked thus :-\n\n\"The legislature is given the utmost latitude in\nmaking the classification and it is only when there is\na palpable abuse of power and the differences made have\nno rational relation to the objectives of the\nlegislation, that necessity of judicial interference\narises.\"\nThe most apposite decision on the subject is the case\nof All India Station Master's & Assistant Station Master's\nAssociation & Ors. v. General Manager, Central Railways &\nOrs.(l) where the law on the subject was succinctly stated\nby Das Gupta, J. who speaking for the Court as follows :-\n\n\"So multifarious are the activities of the State\nthat employment of men for the purpose of these\nactivities has by the very nature of things to be in\ndifferent departments of the State and inside each\ndepartment, in many different classes. For each such\nclass there are separate rules fixing the number of\npersonnel of each class, posts to which the men in that\nclass will be appointed, questions of seniority, pay of\ndifferent posts, the manner in which promotion will be\neffected from the lower grades of pay to the higher\ngrades, e.g., whether on the result of periodical\nexamination or by seniority, or by selection or on some\nother basis and other cognate matters. Each such class\ncan be reasonably considered to be a separate and in\nmany matters independent entity with its own rules of\nrecruitment, pay and prospects and other conditions of\nservice which may vary considerably between one class\nand another.\n\nIt is clear that as between the members of the\nsame class the question whether conditions of service\nare the same or not may well arise. If they are not,\nthe question of denial of equal opportunity will\nrequire serious consideration in such cases. Does the\nconcept of equal opportunity in matters of employment\napply, however, to variations in provisions as between\nmembers of different classes of employees under the\nState ? In our opinion, the answer must be in the\nnegative.\"\n\nThe same view was reiterated by another decision of\nthis Court in\nThe General Manager, Southern Railway v.\nRangachari\n(2) where Gajendragadkar, J. pointed out thus:\n\" Would it. for instance, be open to the State to\nprescribe different scales of salary for the same or\nsimilar posts, different terms of leave or\nsuperannuation for the same or similar post ? On the\nnarrow construction of\nArt. 16(1)\neven if such a\ndiscriminatory courses are adopted by the State in\nrespect of its employees that would not be violative of\nthe equality of opportunity guaranteed by\nArt. 16(1).\n\nSuch a result could not obviously have been intended by\nthe Constitution.. The three provisions form part of\nthe same constitutional code of guarantees and\nsupplement each other.\n\nIf that be so, there would be no difficulty in\nholding that the matters relating to employment must\ninclude all matters in relation to employment both\nprior, and subsequent, to the employment which are\nincidental to the employment and form part of the terms\nand conditions of such employment.\n\n... ... ...\n\nIt is common ground that\nArt. 16(4)\ndoes not cover\nthe entire field covered by\nArt. 16(1)\nand\n(2).\nSome of\nthe matters relating to employment in respect of which\nequality of opportunity has been guaranteed by\nArt.\n16(1)\nand\n(2)\ndo not fall within the mischief of non-\nobstante clause in Art. 16(4).\"\n\n(Emphasis ours)\nIn\nState of Punjab v. Joginder Singh\n(1) Ayyangar, J\nwhile delivering the majority judgment clearly elucidated\nthe various spheres where\nArt. 14\ncould operate and observed\nthus :-\n\n\"As we have stated already, the two Services\nstarted as independent services. The qualifications\nprescribed for entry into each were different, the\nmethod of recruitment and the machinery for the same\nwere also different and the general qualifications\npossessed by and large by the members of each class\nbeing different, they started as two distinct classes.\nIf the government order of September 27, 1957, did not\nintegrate them into a single service, it would follow\nthat\nthe two remained as they started as two distinct\nservices. If they were distinct services. There was no\nquestion of inter se seniority between members of the\ntwo services nor of any comparison between the two in\nthe matter of promotion for founding an argument based\nupon\nArt. 14\nor\nArt. 16(1).\nThey started dissimilarly\nand they continued dissimilarly and any dissimilarly in\ntheir treatment would not be a denial of equal\nopportunity for it is common ground that within each\ngroup there is no denial of that freedom guaranteed by\nthe two Articles. The foundation therefore, of the\njudgment of the learned Judges of tile High Court that\nthe impugned rules created two classes out of what was\nformerly a single class and introduced elements of\ndiscrimination between the two, has no factual basis\nif, as we hold, the order of September 27, 1957, did\nnot effectuate a complete integration of the two\nServices. On this view it would follow that the\nimpugned rules cannot be struck down as violative of\nthe constitution.'\n(Emphasis supplied)\nThe same dictum was followed by this Court in a later\ncase-Sham\nSunder v. Union of India\nand ors.(l)-where it was\npointed out that\nArt. 16(1)\nwould be attracted only if there\nis a breach of equality between members of the same class of\nemployees and\nArt. 14\ndid not contemplate equality between\nmembers of separate or independent classes. In this\nconnection Bachawat, J. held thus:\n\n\"For purposes of promotion, all the enquiry-cum-\nreservation clerks on the Northern Railway form one\nseparate unit. Between members of this class there is\nno discrimination and no denial of equal opportunity in\nthe matter of promotion.. Equality of opportunity in\nmatters of employment under\nArt. 16(1)\nmeans equality\nas between members of the same class of employees and\nnot equality between members of separate, independent\nclasses.\"\n\nThe same principle was reiterated by this Court in\n\nWestern U.P. Electric Power and Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of\nU.P. and Anr.\n(2) where Shah. J. observed thus:\n\"\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution ensures equality\namong A equals; its aim is to protect persons similarly\nplaced against discriminatory treatment. It does not\nhowever operate against rational classification. A\nperson setting up a grievance of denial of equal\ntreatment by law must establish that between persons\nsimilarly circumstanced, some were treated to their\nprejudice and the differential treatment had no\nreasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved\nby the law.\"\n\nIn a recent decision of this Court in\nRamesh Prasad\nSingh v. State of Bihar and Ors.\n(1) to which one of us\n(Fazal Ali, J.) was a party, the same principle was\nreiterated thus :-\n\n\"Equality is for equals, that is to say, those who\nare similarly circumstanced are entitled to an equal\ntreatment but the guarantee enshrined in\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution cannot be carried beyond the\npoint which is well settled by a catena of decisions of\nthe Court.\"\n\nSimilarly, in\nThe State of Gujarat and Anr. v. Shri\nAmbica Mills Ltd.\netc.. (Z) Mathew, J. speaking for the\nCourt pointed out that classification is inherent in\nlegislation and expounding the concept of equality contained\nin\nArt. 14\nobserved thus :-\n\n\"It may be remembered that\narticle 14\ndoes not\nrequire that every regulatory statute apply to all in\nthe same business; where size is an index to the evil\nat which the law is directed, discriminations between\nthe large and small are permissible, and it is also\npermissible for reform to take one step at a time,\naddressing itself to the phase of the problem which\nseems most acute to the legislative mind.\"\n\n... ... ... ...\n\n\"Classification is inherent in legislation. To\nrecognize marked differences that exist in fact is\nliving law: to disregard practical differences and\nconcentrate on some abstract . identities is lifeless\nlogic.\" (Morey v. Doud U.S. 457, 472)\nIn\nState of Jammu and Kashmir v. Triloki Nath\nKhosa and Ors..\n(3) it was clearly pointed out that\nequality is\nonly for equals and even in cases of promotion\nArt. 14\n\nwould apply only if promotional facility is denied to\nequals within the same class. tn this connection,\nChandrachud, J. (as he then was) pithily observed thus\n:-\n\n\"But the concept of equality has an inherent\nlimitation arising from the very nature of the\nconstitutional guarantee. Equality is for equals. That\nis to say that those who are similarly circumstanced\nare entitled to an equal treatment.\n\nSince the constitutional code of equality and\nequal opportunity is a charter for equals, equality of\nopportunity in matters of promotion means an equal\npromotional opportunity for persons who fall,\nsubstantially, within the same class.\"\n\nIn United States v. James Griggs Raines (1) it was\nheld that one to whom application of statute is\nconstitutional cannot be heard to attack the statute on\nthe ground that impliedly if it applied to other\npersons it might be unconstitutional. These\nobservations, in our opinion, furnish a complete answer\nto the argument of the petitioners that\nArticle 14\nis\nviolated in the instant ease.\n\nSimilar observations were made in Vol. 16 (PP. 236-237)\nof Corpus Juris Secundum which are extracted below :-\n\n\"A person ordinarily is precluded from challenging\nthe constitutionality of governmental action by\ninvoking the rights of others and it is not sufficient\nthat the statute or administrative regulation is\nunconstitutional as to other persons or classes of\npersons; it must affirmatively appear that the person\nattacking the statute comes within the class of persons\naffected by it.\"\n\nThus, from a detailed analysis and close examination of\nthe eases of this Court starting from 1952 till today, the\nfollowing propositions emerge :-\n\n(1) In considering the fundamental right of equality\nof Opportunity a technical, pedantic or\ndoctrinaire app-\nroach should not be made and the doctrine should\nnot A be invoked even if different scales of pay,\nservice terms, leave, etc., are introduced in\ndifferent or dissimilar posts.\n\nThus, where the class or categories of\nservice are essentially different in purport and\nspirit,\nArt. 14\ncan- not be attracted.\n\n(2)\nArt. 14\nforbids hostile discrimination but not\nreason able classification. Thus, where persons\nbelonging to a particular class in view of their\nspecial attributes, qualities, mode of recruitment\nand the like, are differently treated in public\ninterest to advance and boost members belonging to\nbackward classes, such a classification would not\namount to discrimination having a close nexus with\nthe objects sought to be achieved so that in such\ncases\nArt. 14\nwill be completely out of the way.\n(3)\nArt. 14\ncertainly applies where equals are treated\ndifferently without any reasonable basis.\n(4) Where equals and unequals are treated differently,\n\nArt. 14\nwould have no application.\n\n(5) Even if there be one class of service having\nseveral categories with different attributes and\nincidents, such a category becomes a separate\nclass by itself and no difference or\ndiscrimination between such category and the\ngeneral members of the other class would amount to\nany discrimination or to denial of equality of\nopportunity.\n\n(6) In order to judge whether a separate category has\nbeen carved out of a class of service, the\nfollowing circumstances have generally to be\nexamined:-\n\n(a) the nature, the mode and the manner of\nrecruitment of a particular category from the\nvery start,\n\n(b) the classifications of the particular\ncategory.\n(c) the terms and conditions of service of the\nmembers of the category,\n\n(d) the nature and character of the posts and\npromotional avenues,\n\n(e) the special attributes that the particular\ncategory possess which are not to be found in\nother classes, and the like.\n\nIt is difficult to lay down a rule of universal\napplication but the circumstances mentioned above may be\ntaken to be illustrative guidelines for determining the\nquestion.\n\nApplying these tests we now proceed to examine the\ncorrectness of the first contention advanced by Mr. Atul\nSetalvad and counsel for other petitioners and countered by\nthe Corporations.\n\nA very large number of affidavits and documents have\nbeen filed by the parties in support of their respective\ncases but in view of the arguments of the parties, the\nmatter falls, in our opinion, within a very narrow compass\nand we shall refer only to those affidavits and documents\nwhich are germane for deciding the case on the basis of\ncontentions advanced before us.\n\nIn order to test whether the category of AHs\nconstitutes the same class as AFPS or is a separate category\nby itself, we shall detail the materials placed before us by\nthe parties on this aspect of the matter. We shall first\ndeal with the case of AHs employed by A.I.\nTo begin with, it is not disputed that at the initial\nrecruitment a classification for appointment of AH and AFP\nis essentially different. For instance, while in the case of\nAFP the necessary qualifications are as follows:-\n\n(1) SCC or its equivalent\n(2) Minimum three years training experience in any\nAirline or three years Diploma in Catering from a\nrecognised Institute or a Graduate.\n\n(3) There is no requirement that AFP, should be\nunmarried .\n\n(4) The AFP has to appear for a written I.C. test.\nAs against these basic requirements for entry into\nservice for the class known as 'AFP', the requirements for\nAHs are as follows:-\n\n(1) SCC or its equivalent\n(2) AH must be unmarried B\n(3) No other requirement is needed for entry into\nservice so far as AH is concerned.\n\nMr. Setalvad however, argued that both AHs and AFPs\nbeing members of the same cabin crew must be taken to belong\nto the same class. This argument fails to take into\nconsideration the fact that if at the threshold the basic\nrequirements of the two classes, viz., AFP and AH, for entry\ninto service are absolutely different and poles apart even\nthough both the classes may during the flight work as cabin\ncrew, they would not become one class of service. D\nSecondly, while AFP starts with a grade of Rs. 385-535,\nthe AH starts her career with the grade of Rs. 485-25-560-\n40-770. This is also a very material difference which points\nto the AHs being a separate category both in respect\nqualifications at the entry into service and also in respect\nof starting salaries. E\nAnother important distinction between AFPs and AHs is\nthat whereas the total number of posts in A.I. Of AFPs are\n494, in the case of AHs is 737. Thus, to begin with, the two\nclasses differ in qualifications, in grades and also in the\nnumber of posts.\n\nThe matter does not rest there. Even the promotional\navenues or channels of the two categories of service are\nquite different and so is their seniority. So far as the\nAFPs are concerned, the hierarchy is as follows:-\n\n(1) A.F.P.\n(2) F.P. (Grade: Rs. 485-25-560-40-720-50-1020)\nThe total number of posts of FPs are 372. Thus, by and\nlarge AH starts almost in the same grade as F.P. which is a\nhigher post than AFP. The third higher category is Check\nF.P. which has the same emoluments as FPs with the\ndifference that the Check FPs get an additional allowance of\nRs. 200/- p.m. and the number\nof posts are 61. The next promotional avenue is the post of\nInflight Supervisor. The total posts are 69 and the Grade is\nRs. 1100-501600-60- 1780- 100- 1880\nNo. of Grade\nPosts\n(5) Dy. Manger 8 1400-50-1600-60-1780\n100-1880\n(6) Manager 7 1720-60-1780-100-2180\n(7) Manager, Cabin 1 1880- 100-2480\nCrew\nIt is asserted by the A.I. that it takes about 15 to 20\nyears for a F.P. to reach the promotional posts of Inflight\nSupervisor and 25 years to reach the post of Dy. Manager. As\nagainst this, n the hierarchy of AH is as follows:-\n\nNo. of Grade\nposts\n1. AH 737\n2. Check AH 72\n3. Dy. Chief AH 3 1100-50-1600-60-1780-\n100-1880\n4. Addl. Chief AH 3 1400-50-1600-60-1780-\n100-1980\n5. Chief AH 1 1720-60-1780-100-2180\n\nIt may be mentioned here that so far as the post of Dy.\n\nChief AH is concerned, by virtue of an agreement dated 30th\nMay 1977 between the male members of the cabin crew it was\ndecided to phase them out. A serious exception has been\ntaken against the Corporation for having acceded to the\ndemand for phasing out a post belonging to the category of\nAHs and that too without taking the consent of AHs. A\nserious protest on this account was lodged by the AHs which\nis to be found at page 166 of Vol. II of the Paperbook, the\nrelevant portion of which of may be extracted thus :\n\"We do not see how any Flight Purser or Assistant\nA Flight Purser could suggest a viable proposal\nregarding our promotion considering this matter is in\ndirect relation to Air Hostesses and their future.\nIn the past the Flight Pursers and the Assistant\nFlight Pursers took away our promotional avenue to\nDeputy Chief Air Hostess without even consulting us.\"\n\nAt page 148 of Vol. II of the Paper Book, the affidavit\ndetails the circumstances under which the post of Dy. Chief\nAH was agreed to be phased out. In this connection, the\nfollowing extracts are relevant :-\n\n\"The Association also went into the grades of\ndifferent categories of cabin crew and found that while\nthe Deputy Chief Air Hostesses functioned on board the\nflight only as Check Air Hostesses and/or Air Hostess\nher grade was much higher than that of a Flight Purser\nwho was in a higher status or cadre and had supervisory\nresponsibilities. The management therefore was\napproached by the association resulting in the said\nagreement of 30.5.1977 which is already annexed hereto\nand marked Exhibit V above by which the category of\nDeputy Chief Air Hostesses was made redundant.\" k.\nWe are also unable to understand how the Management\ncould phase out a post available to the AHs exclusively at\nthe instant of Pursers when they had absolutely no concern\nwith this particular post nor had the Pursers any right to\npersuade the Management to abolish a post which was not\nmeant for them. The AHs have rightly protested that the\nAgreement to phase out the post was unilaterally taken by\nthe Management without even consulting the AHs although they\nwere the only ones who were most adversely affected by this\ndecision. In para 25 of the Affidavit at P. 58 of the same\nvolume a statement is made regarding the circumstances under\nwhich the post of Dy. Chief AH was phased out, which is\nextracted below:\n\n\"On May 30, 1977, as a result of discussions with\nthe Air-India Cabin Crew Association representing the\nflight pursers, assistant night pursers and air\nhostesses, it was decided that the category of Deputy\nChief Air Hostess would be phased out, i.e., as and\nwhen the then existing\nDeputy Chief Air Hostesses retired or resigned the\nconsequent vacancies would not be filled. At present\nthe promotional avenues for Air Hostesses are the post\nof Additional Chief Air Hostess, Chief Air Hostess and\nDeputy Manager Air Hostesses.\"\n\nUnfortunately, however, as the decision was taken as\ntar back as 1977 and no grievance was made by the AHs before\nthe High Court and as this is not a matter which is covered\nby\nArt. 32\nof the Constitution, we are unable to give any\nrelief to the AHs on this score. We would, however, like to\nobserve that in view of the limited promotional channels\navailable to the AHs, the A.I. should seriously consider the\ndesirability of restoring the post of Dy. Chief AH and\nthereby remove the serious injustice which has been done to\nthe AHs in violation of the principles of natural justice.\n\nWe have touched this aspect of the matter only\nincidentally as it was mentioned in the Affidavit filed\nbefore us and appeared to us to be of some consequence.\n\nThus, from a comparison of the mode of recruitment the\nclassification, the promotional avenues and other matters\nwhich we have discussed above, we are satisfied that the AHs\nfrom an absolutely separate category from that of AFPs in\nmany respects having different grades, different promotional\navenues and different service conditions. Finally it may\nalso be noted that even though the AHs retire at the age of\n35 (extendable) to 45 they get retiral benefits quite\ndifferent from those available to the AFPs. For instance, at\npages 68-69 of Vol. II of the Paperbook the following\naverments may be specially noticed :-\n\n\"The benefits particularly the retirement benefits\nfor male cabin crew and female cabin crew in service\nhave been and are materially different and the\nexpectations raised on the basis of these benefits are\nalso viewed differently. Thus, for instance, an Air\nHostess, who is recruited between the age of 19 and 25\non a higher pay scale than that of an Assistant Flight\nPurser and who retires after service of 10 years, is\nentitled to the same quantum of free air passages,\nwhich she was entitled to in the 10th year of her\nservice, for a continuous period of five years\nthereafter. Similarly, an Air Hostess who has\ncompleted IS years of service and retires thereafter is\nentitled to free air passages\nfor a continuous period of 10 years thereafter on the\nbasis A of the total number of free air passages she\nwas entitled to in the IS years of her service. On the\nother hand, Assistant Flight Pursers who are recruited\nbetween the ages of 21 and 26 are entitled to\nretirement benefit of free air passage only if they\nvoluntarily retire after 25 years of continuous service\nor on attaining the age of superannuation, i.e., 58\nyears. If the retirement age of air hostess were\nextended to 58 years, they would be subjected to the\nsame discipline and reaction of many of the existing\nair hostesses in Air India is that the differentiation\nin retirement ages between men and women is fair and\nreasonable and to their advantage. In fact most of the\nair hostesses are anxious to complete 10 years of\nservice and retire to become eligible for these\nbenefits.\"\n\nThese benefits are further explained in a chart given\nin Ext. D which extracts the relevant portions of Air India\nEmployees Passage Regulations, 1960. The relevant portion of\nthe provisions may be extracted thus:\n\nCategory Scale of Period for\nconcession which conc-\nession\nwould be\nadmissible\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Employees retiring one free passage Till the\non reaching the every year or two of the\nage of 58 years or free passage every retired\n55 years, as the alternate year and employee.\n\ncase may be, pro- not more than\nvided they have two 90% rebated\nrendered conti- passages every\nnuous service for year.\na minimum period\nof 20 years.\n\n(b) Employees retiring Two free passage Till the\non reaching the every year and death of\nage of 58 years or not more than the retired\n55 years, as the two 90% rebated employee.\n\ncase may be, pro- passage every\nvided they have year.\nrendered continuous\nservice for a\nminimum of 25 years.\n(c) Employees permit- One free passage Till the\nted by Competent every year or death of\nauthority to retire two passage every the retired\nvoluntarily after alternate year employee.\n\ncompletion of a and not more\ncontinuous service than two 90%\nof not less than rebated passages\n25 years. every year.\n\n(d) Air Hostesses reti- one free passage For a\nring after render- every year or period not\ning continuous two free passa- exceeding\nservice for a mini- ges every alter- five years\nmum period of 10 nate year and from the\nyears, but less one 75% reba- or from\n15 years. ted passage April 1,\nevery year or 1974,\ntwo 75% rebated whichever\npassages every is later.\n\nalternative year.\n\n(e) Instructress, Air one free passage For a\nHosstess/Lady every year or not\nReceptionists two free passages exceeding\n\n-retiring after every alternate ten years\nrendering continu- year and one 75% from the\nous service for a rebated passage date of\nminimum period of every year or two retirement\n15 years. or two 75% rebated or from\npassages every April 1,\nalternate year. 1974\nwhichever\nis later.\n\n(f) Employees retiring\npermanently due to -do- -do-\nmedical unfitness\nprovided that they\nhave retired after\nrendering continu-\nous service for a\nminimum period of\n15 years.\nThus, although the AFPs also get retiral benefits which\ncontinue upto their death yet they get these benefits only\nafter having put in 20 years of service or reaching the age\nof superannuation which in their case is 55 or 58 years;\nwhereas; the AHs get almost the same concessions, though for\na lesser period, even after serving the Corporation for a\nmuch shorter period. This is yet another distinctive feature\nof the separate category of AHs.\n\nHaving regard, therefore, to the various circumstances,\nincidents, service conditions, promotional avenues, etc. of\nthe AFPs and AHs, the inference is irresistible that AHs\nthough members of the cabin crew are an entirely separate\nclass governed by different set of rules, regulations and\nconditions of service. Mr. Nariman submitted that job\nfunctions performed by the AFPs and AHs being entirely\ndifferent, is also an important circumstance to prove that\nAHs is a class completely separate from the class of AFPs.\nWe are, however, not impressed with this argument because a\nperusal of the job functions which have been detailed in the\naffidavit, clearly shows that the functions of the two,\nthough obviously different overlap on some points but the\ndifference, if any, is one of degree rather than of kind.\nMoreover, being members of the crew in the same flight, the\ntwo separate classes have to work as a team, helping and\nassisting each other particularly in case of emergency. This\naspect of the matter was highlighted by the Mahesh Award\nwhich observed thus:\n\n\"The management claims that there cannot be and\nshould not be, any inflexibility or rigidity regarding\nthe functions and duties of the different categories of\ncabin crew and the Management should have full\nauthority and discretion as regards the\ninterchangeability of job allocations and functions and\nduties of the different categories of cabin crew and\nfor effecting from time to time such interchanges of\njob allocations and of functions and duties as it might\nthink fit.\n\n... ... ...\n\nThere is not the slightest doubt that the Cabin Crew\nhave to work as a team as pointed out by Shri S.S. Hemmadi\n(AMW-5). Although there are different duties fixed for\ndifferent categories, it is necessary for each category to\ngive help and do the work of other categories for the smooth\nflight.\"\n\n(vide pp. l 259-60 of the Mahesh Award)\nWe entirely agree with the observations made in the\nMahesh Award and, therefore, do not attach much importance\nto this circumstance relied upon by the Corporation.\n\nIn the same token, an additional argument advanced by\nMr. Setalvad was that certain terms and conditions of AHs\nwere palpably discriminatory and violative of\nArt. 14.\nFor\ninstance, under the Regulations concerned, AHs suffered from\nthree important disabilities-(I) their services were\nterminated on first pregnancy, (2) they were not allowed to\nmarry within four years from the date of their entry into\nservice, and (3) the age of retirement of AHs was 35 years,\nextendable to 45 years at the option of the Managing\nDirector, as against the retirement age of AFPs who retired\nat the age of 55 or 58 years. There can be no doubt that\nthese peculiar conditions do form part of the Regulations\ngoverning AHs but once we have held that AHs from a separate\ncategory with different and separate incidents the\ncircumstances pointed out by the petitioners cannot amount\nto discrimination so as to violate\nArt. 14\nof the\nConstitution on this ground. There is no complaint by the\npetitioners that between the separate class of AHs inter se\nthere has been any discrimination regarding any matter. In\nfact, the only point raised on this aspect was that AHs\nemployed by A.I. in U.K. have different conditions of\nservice from AHs serving A.I. in countries other than U.K.\nDoubtless this distinction is there but this is really a\nfortuitous circumstance because A.I. was forced to comply\nwith the local laws of U.K. in order to increase the age of\nretirement of AHs posted in England. Surely we cannot expect\nA.I. to commit an offence by violating the laws of U.K. In\nNavy, Army and Air Force Institutes v. Varely(1) the\nvariation between the hours of work by female employees in\nNottingham and the hours of work by male employees in London\nwas held to be valid and did not violate the principle of\nEquality. Phillips, J.. made the following observations:\n\n\"An example which we gave the other day was of a\nCase where all the conditions are satisfied for the\noperation\nof an equality clause-because, for instance, there is a\nvariation in that a woman is paid less-but it is found\non investigation that the employers can establish (and\nthe burden of proof, which is a heavy burden, is always\non them) that the reason the man is paid more than the\nwoman has nothing whatever to do with sex but is due to\nthe fact that the employers have in force a system\nunder which a long-service employee is paid more so the\nvariation there is due, not to a difference of sex, but\nto that material difference. It is important to note\nthere that the women, if she remains sufficiently long\nin the company's employ, will of course one day herself\nqualify to receive a long-service increment.\nIt is common ground in this case that the\nvariation-that is to say, the difference in the hours\nworked in London and those worked in Nottingham-is not\ndue to a difference of sex.\"\n\nOn a parity of reasoning in the instant case,\ntherefore, the violation of\nArt. 14\nis not due to any fault\nof the Corporation which only seeks to abide by the local\nlaws of United Kingdom nor could it be said that the higher\nretirement age was fixed for AHs posted in U.K. Only on the\nground of sex.\n\nComing now to the next limb of the argument of Mr.\nSetalvad that even if there is no discrimination inter se\nbetween AHs, the conditions referred to above are so\nunreasonable and arbitrary that they violate\nArt. 14\nand\nmust, therefore, be struck down, we feel that the argument\nmerits serious consideration. Before, however, we deal with\nthe various aspects of this argument, we might mention an\nimportant argument put forward by the Corporation that the\nclass of AHs is a sex-based recruitment and, therefore, any,\ndiscrimination made in their service conditions has not been\nmade on the ground of sex only but due to a lot of other\nconsiderations also. Mr. Setalvad tried to rebut this\nargument by contending that the real discrimination is based\non the basis of sex which is sought to be smoke-screened by\ngiving a halo of circumstances other than sex. Both parties\nplaced reliance on the 1976 Act. It may be necessary to\nexamine the relevant section of the 1976 Act. Sub-sections\n(I) and (3) s. 4 of the 1976 Act may be extracted thus:-\n\n\"4. (l) No employer shall pay to any worker,\nemployed\nby him in an establishment or employment, remuneration,\nwhether payable in cash or in kind, at rates less\nfavourable than those at which remuneration is paid by\nhim to the works of the opposite sex in such\nestablishment or of a similar nature\n... ... ... ...\n\n(3) Where, in an establishment or employment, the\nrates of remuneration payable before the commencement\nof this Act for men and women workers for the same work\nor work of a similar nature are different only on the\nground of sex, then the higher (in cases where there\nare only two rates), or, as the case may be, the\nhighest (in cases where there are more than two rates),\nof such rates shall be the rate at which remuneration\nshall be payable, on and from such commencement. to\nsuch men and women workers :\"\n\nThere is no doubt that the statutory mandate prohibits\nany employer from making a distinction in wages between male\nand female. Had the matter rested here, there could have\nbeen no option but to accept the argument of Mr. Setalvad.\nIt would, however, appear that the benefit conferred on the\nfemales under the 1976 Act is not absolute and\nunconditional.\nSection 16\nclearly authorises restrictions\nregarding remuneration to be paid by the employer if a\ndeclaration under it is made by the appropriate Government,\nwhich may be extracted thus:\n\n\" 16. Where the appropriate Government is, on a\nconsideration of all the circumstances of the case,\nsatisfied that the differences in regard to the\nremuneration, or a particular species of remuneration,\nof men and women workers in any establishments or\nemployment is based on a factor other than sex, it may,\nby notification, make a r declaration to that effect,\nand any act of the employer attributable to such a\ndifference shall not be deemed to be a contravention of\nany provision of this Act.\"\n\nIn the instant case, the Central Government has made a\ndeclaration by virtue of a Notification dt. 15.6.79\npublished in the Gazette of India, Part II-\nSection 3\n, Sub-\nsection (ii) dated 30.6.79, which runs thus:-\n\n\"New Delhi, the I 5th June 1979.\nS.C. 2258-ln exercise of the powers conferred by A\n\nsection 16\nof the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 25 of\n1976) the Central Government having considered all the\ncircumstances relating to, and terms and conditions of\nemployment of Air Hostesses and Flight Stewards, are\nsatisfied that the difference in regard to pay, etc. Of\nthese categories of employees are based on different\nconditions of service and not on the difference of sex.\n\nThe Central Government, therefore, declares that any\nact of the employer attributable to such differences\nshall not be declared to be in contravention of any of\nthe provisions of the Act.\"\n\nThus, the declaration is presumptive proof of the fact\nthat in the matter of allowances, conditions of service and\nother types of remuneration, no discrimination has been made\non the ground of sex only. The declaration by the Central\nGovernment, therefore, completely concludes the matter.\n\nEven otherwise, what Articles IS (l) and 16 (2)\nprohibit is that discrimination should not be made only and\nonly on the ground of sex. These Articles of the\nConstitution do not prohibit the State from making\ndiscrimination on the ground of sex coupled with other\nconsiderations. On this point, the matter is no longer res\nintegra but is covered by several authorities of this Court.\n\nIn\nYusuf Abdul Aziz v. The State of Bombay and Husseinbhoy\nLaljee\n(l) sex was held to be a permissible classification.\nWhile dealing with this aspect of the matter this Court\nobserved thus:-\n\nArticle 14\nis general and must be read with the other\npro visions which set out the ambit of fundamental\nrights. Sex is a sound classification and although\nthere can be no discrimination in general on that\nground, the Constitution itself provides for special\nprovisions in the case OF women and children. The two\narticles read together validate the impugned clause in\n\nsection 497\nof the Indian Penal Code.\"\nThe same view was taken by this Court in a later\ndecision in\nMiss C.B. Muthamma v. U.O.I.\nand ors.(2) where\nKrishna Iyer, J. speaking for the Court made the following\nobservations:\n\n\"We do not mean to universalise or dogmatise that\nmen and women are equal in all occupations and all\nsituations and do not exclude the need to pragmatise\nwhere the requirements of particular employment, the\nsensitivities of . sex or the peculiarities of societal\nsectors or the handicaps of either sex may compel\nselectivity. But save where the differentiation is\ndemonstrable, the rule of equality must govern.\"\n\nFor these reasons, therefore, the argument of Mr.\nSetalvad that the conditions of service with regard to\nretirement, etc., amount to discrimination on the ground of\nsex only is overruled and it is held that the conditions of\nservice indicated above are not violative of\nArt. 16\non this\nground.\n\nThis brings us now to the next limb of the argument of\nMr. Setalvad which pertains to the question as to whether\nand not the conditions imposed on the AHs regarding their\nretirement and termination are manifestly unreasonable or\nabsolutely arbitrary. We might mention here that even though\nthe conditions mentioned above may not be violative of\nArt.\non the ground of discrimination but if it is proved to\nour satisfaction that the conditions laid down are entirely\nunreasonable and absolutely arbitrary, then the provisions\nwill have to be struck down.\n\nThis argument was sought to be rebutted by Mr. Nariman\non the ground that the conditions mentioned above formed the\nsubject matter of the two Awards which have upheld the\nconditions to be valid. It was also contended that even\nthough the period of the Award has expired, they continue to\nbe binding on the parties and as these matters pertain to\nindustrial dispute, this Court should not disturb the\nsettlement arrived at or the Awards given by the National\nTribunals and allow the disputes to be settled in the proper\nforum, viz., Industrial courts. To buttress this argument,\nreliance was placed on certain observations in the two\nAwards as also some authorities.\n\nIn this connection, while dealing with this particular\ndemand of the AHs, the Khosla Award observed thus:\n\n\"256. With regard to air hostesses, the contention\nof the Management is that they are in a special class.\nThey have to deal with passengers of various\ntemperaments, and a young and attractive air hostess is\nable to cope with difficult or awkward situations more\ncompetently and more easily than\nan older person with less personal prepossessions. On\nthis point there can be no two opinions. It was also\npointed out that air hostesses do not stay very long in\nthe service of Air India, and young and attractive\nwomen are more inclined to look upon service in Air\nIndia as a temporary occupation than as a career. Most\nof them get married and leave the service.\n\n... ... ... ...\n\n260. In my view, no case has been made out for\nraising the age of retirement and in cases where the\nefficiency of the employee is not impaired, there is\nsuitable provision under regulation 47 for extending\nhis service upto the age of 60. As observed above,\nthere have been no complaints of any employee being\nmade to retire under the provision of clause (ii) of\nregulation 46....\"\n\nSimilar demands were made before the Mahesh Tribunal\nwhich have been extracted earlier. The observations of the\nMahesh Tribunal may be extracted as follows:-\n\n\"There is no reason to have a different provision\nregarding the air hostesses in Air India. The social\nconditions in Europe and elsewhere are different from\nthe social conditions in India. The work of an air\nhostess involves running hither and thither and flying\nat the same time. In case of an air hostess, her\nappearance, glamour an weight are important. The\nworking hours are also odd. She has to walk up and down\nthe aisles and has to be away from home for a number of\ndays at a time. All this will not suit an Indian\nmarried woman and also places the category of an air\nhostess on an entirely different level from all those\nemployed in a pharmaceutical concern. The work of an\nair hostess is more arduous. lt seems, however,\nreasonable that the present practice of restricting the\nextension beyond 30 years to one year at a time need\nnot be a part of the rules. The rule regarding\nextension of service in the settlement between the ACEU\nand the Indian Airlines of January 10, 1972 is better\nworded and i; should be adopted by the Air India also\nin its entirety. rt enables the General Manager to give\nextension for periods longer than one year at a time,\nif he considers it proper. The bar of retirement on\nmarriage should remain.\"\nWith due respect to Justice Khosla, we find ourselves\nunable to agree with most of the observations that he has\nmade and we shall give detailed reasons for the same a\nlittle later when we deal with the validity of the impugned\nregulations.\n\nIt is true that even though the period of the Awards\nmay have expired yet it continues to be binding on the\nparties as an agreement.\nIn\nSouth Indian Bank Ltd. v. A.R.\nChacko\n(l) it was held that even if the Award has ceased to\nbe operative, it would continue to be binding on the parties\nas a contract. In this connection, Das Gupta, J. made the\nfollowing observations:-\n\n\"Quite apart from this, however, it appears to us\nthat even if an award has ceased to be in operation or\nin force and has ceased to be binding on the parties\nunder the provisions of s. 19 (6) it will continue to\nhave its effect as a contract between the parties that\nhas been made by industrial adjudication in place of\nthe old contract.\"\n\nThe same view was taken in\nMd. Qasim Larry, Factory\nManager, Sasamusa Sugar Works v. Muhammad Samsuddin and\nAnr.\n(2) and reiterated in\nLife Insurance Corporation of\nIndia v. D.J. Bahadur and Ors.\n(3) where the following\nobservations were made:-\n\n\"It is obvious from\nSection 18\nthat a settlement,\nlike an award, is also binding. What I emphasise is\nthat an award, adjudicatory or arbitral, and a\nsettlement during conciliation or by agreement shall be\nbinding because of statutory sanction.\nSection 19\n\nrelates to the period of operation of settlements and\nawards and here also it is clear that both settlements\nand awards, as is evident from a reading of\nSection 19\n(2)\nand (6), stand on the same footing.\n\n... ... ... ...\n\nThe power of reasoning, t he purpose of industrial\njurisprudence and the logic of the law presented with\nterse force in this pronouncement cannot be missed. The\nnew contract\nwhich is created by an award continues to govern the\nrelations between the parties till it is displaced by\nanother contract.\"\n\n... ... ... ...\n\nThe law is lucid and the justice manifest on\ntermination notice or notice of change the award or\nsettlement does not perish but survives to bind until\nreincarnation, in any modified form, in a fresh\nregulation of conditions of service by a settlement or\naward.\"\n\nIn view of the authorities indicated above assuming\nthat the two awards are binding on the petitioners, the\nserious question for consideration is whether the agreement,\nwhich may be binding on the parties, would estop them from\nchallenging the Regulations on the ground that the same are\nvoid as being violative of\nArticles 14\nor 19 of the\nConstitution. It is well settled that there can be no\nestoppel against a statute much less against constitutional\nprovisions. If, therefore, we hold in agreement with the\nargument of the petitioners that the provisions for\ntermination and retirement are violative of\nArt. 14\nas being\nunreasonable and arbitrary, the Awards or the agreements\nconfirmed by the Awards would be of no assistance to the\nCorporations.\n\nWe now proceed to determine the constitutional validity\nof the impugned Regulations. Taking the case of A.I. AHs. it\nwould appear that their conditions of service are governed\nby Regulations 46 and 47, the relevant portions of which are\nextracted below:\n\n\"46. Retiring Age:\n\n(i) Subject to the provision of sub-regulation (ii)\nhereof, an employee shall retire from the service\nof the Corporation upon attaining the age of 58\nyears, except in the following cases when/he/she\nshall retire earlier:\n\n... ... ... ...\n\n(c) An Air Hostess, upon attaining the age of 35 years\nor on marriage if it takes place within four years\nof service or on first pregnancy, whichever occurs\nearlier;\n\n... ... ... ...\n(47) Extension of Service:\n\nNotwithstanding anything contained in Regulation\n46, the services of any employee, may, at the option of\nthe Managing Director but on the employee being found\nmedically fit, be extended by one year at a time beyond\nthe age of retirement for an aggregate period not\nexceeding two years except in the case of Air Hostesses\nand Receptionists where the period will be ten years\nand five years respectively.\"\n\nA perusal of the Regulations shows that the normal age\nof retirement of an AH is 35 years or on marriage, if it\ntakes place within four years of service, or on first\npregnancy whichever occurs earlier. Leaving the age of\nretirement for the time being, let us examine the\nconstitutional validity of the other two conditions, viz.,\ntermination if marriage takes place within four years or on\nfirst pregnancy So far as the question of marriage within\nfour years is concerned, we do not think that the provisions\nsuffer from any constitutional infirmity. According to the\nregulations an AH starts her career between the age of 19 to\n26 years. Most of the AHs are not only SSC which is the\nminimum qualification but possess even higher qualifications\nand there are very few who decide to marry immediately after\nentering the service. Thus, the Regulation permits an AH to\nmarry at the age of 23 if she has joined the service at the\nage of 19 which is by all standards a very sound and\nsalutary provision. Apart from improving the health of the\nemployee, it helps a good in the promotion and boosing up of\nour family planning programme. Secondly, if a woman marries\nnear about the age of 20 to 23 years, she becomes fully\nmature and there is every chance of such a marriage proving\na success, all things being equal. Thirdly, it has been\nrightly pointed out to us by the Corporation that if the bar\nof marriage within four years of service is removed then the\nCorporation will have to incur huge expenditure in\nrecruiting additional AHs either on a temporary or on ad hoc\nbasis to replace the working AHs if they conceive and any\nperiod short of four years would be too little a time for\nthe Corporation to phase out such an ambitious plan.\n\nHaving regard to these circumstances, we are unable to\nfind any unreasonableness or arbitrariness in the provisions\nof . the Regulations which necessitate that the AHs should\nnot marry within four years of the service failing which\ntheir services will have to be\nterminated. Mr. Setalvad submitted that such a bar on\nmarriage is an outrage on the dignity of the fair sex and is\nper se unreasonable. Though the argument of Mr. Setalvad is\nextremely attractive but having taken into consideration an\noverall picture of the situat;on and the difficulties of\nboth the parties, we are unable to find any constitutional\ninfirmity or any element of arbitrariness in the aforesaid\nprovisions. The argument of Mr. Setalvad as also those who\nfollowed him on this point is, therefore, overruled.\n\nComing now to the second limb of the provisions\naccording to which the services of AHs would stand\nterminated on first pregnancy, we find ourselves in complete\nagreement with the argument of Mr. Setalvad that this is a\nmost unreasonable and arbitrary provision which shocks the\nconscience of the Court. The Regulation does not prohibit\nmarriage after four years and if an AH after having\nfulfilled the first condition becomes pregnant, there is no\nreason why pregnancy should stand in the way of her\ncontinuing in service. The Corporations represented to us\nthat pregnancy leads to a number of complications and to\nmedical disabilities which may stand in the efflcient\ndischarge of the duties by the AHs. It was said that even in\nthe early stage of pregnancy some ladies are prone to get\nsick due to air pressure, nausea in long flights and such\nother technical factors. This, however, appears to be purely\nan artificial argument because once a married woman is\nallowed to continue in service then under the provisions of\nthe\nMaternity Benefit Act, 1961\nand The Maharashtra\nMaternity Rules, 1965 (these apply to both the Corporations\nas their Head offices are at Bombay), she is entitled to\ncertain benefits including maternity leave. In case,\nhowever, the Corporations feel that pregnancy from the very\nbeginning may come in the way of the discharge of the duties\nby some of the AHs, they could be given maternity leave for\na period of 14 to 16 months and in the meanwhile there could\nbe no difflculty in the Management making arrangements on a\ntemporary or ad hoc basis by employing additional AHs. We\nare also unable to understand the argument of the\nCorporation that a woman after bearing children becomes weak\nin physique or in her constitution. There is neither any\nlegal nor medical authority for this bald proposition.\nHaving taken the AH in service and after having utilised her\nservices for four years, to terminate her service by the\nManagement if she becomes pregnant amounts to compelling the\npoor AH not to have any children and thus interfere with and\ndivert the ordinary course\nof human nature. It seems to us that the termination of the\nservices of an AH under such circumstances is not only a\ncallous and cruel act but an open insult to Indian womanhood\nthe most sacrosanct and cherised institution. We are\nconstrained to observe that such a course of action is\nextremely detestable and adhorrent to the notions of a\ncivilised society. Apart from being grossly unethical, it\nsmacks of a deep rooted sense of utter selfishness at the\ncost of all human vahles. Such a provision, therefore, is\nnot only manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary but contains\nthe quality of unfairness and exhibits naked despotism and\nis, therefore, clearly violative of\nArt. 14\nof the\nConstitution. In fact, as a very fair and conscienticus\ncounsel Mr. Nariman realised the inherent weakness and the\napparent absurdity of the aforesaid impugned provisions and\nin the course of his arguments he stated that he had been\nable to persuade the Management to amendthe Rules so as to\ndelete 'first pregnancy' as a ground for termination of the\nservice and would see that suitable amendments are made to\nRegulation 46 (i) (c) in the following manner:\n\n\"(a) Regulation 46 (i) (c) will be amended so as to\nsubstitute for the words \"or a first pregnancy\",\nthe words \"or on a third pregoancy\".\n\n(b) There will be a suitably framed Regulation to\nprovide for the above and for the following:\n\n(i) An air hostess having reason to believe that\nshe is pregnant will intimate this to Air\nIndia and will also elect in writing within a\nreasonable time whether or not to continue in\nservice.\n\n(ii) If such air hostess elects to continue in\nservice on pregnancy, she shall take leave\nfrom service for a period not later than that\ncommencing from 90 days after conception and\nwill be entitled to resume service only after\nconfinement (or premature termination of\npregnancy) and after she is certified by the\nMedical officer of AIR INDIA as being fit for\nresuming her duties as an air hostess after\ndelivery or confinement or prior termination\nof pregnancy. The said entire period will be\ntreated as leave without pay subject to the\nair hostess being entitled to maternity leave\nwith pay\nas in the case of other female employees and\nprivilege leave under the Regulations.\n\n(iii)Every such air hostess will submit to an\nannual medical examination by the Medical\nOfficer of AIR INDIA for certification of\ncontinued physical fitness or such other\nspecifications of health and physical\ncondition as may be prescribed by AIR INDIA\nin this behalf in the interest of maintenance\nof efficiency.\n\n(iv) It will be clarified that the provisions\nrelating to continuance in service on\npregnancy will only be available to married\nwomen-an unmarried woman on first pregnancy\nwill have to retire from service.\"\n\nThe proposed amendment seems to us to be quite\nreasonable but the decision of this case cannot await the\namendment which may or may not be made. We would therefore,\nhave to give our decision regarding the constitutional\nvalidity of the said provision. Moreover, clause (b) (iv)\nabove, which is the proposed amendment, also suffers from\nthe infirmity that if an unmarried woman conceives then her\nservice would be terminated on first pregnancy. This\nprovision also appears to us to be wholly unreasonable\nbecause apart from being revolting to all sacred human\nvalues, it fails to take into consideration cases where a\nwoman becomes a victim of rape or other circumstances\nresulting in pregnancy by force or fraud for reasons beyond\nthe control of the woman and having gone through such a\nharrowing experience she has to face tennination of service\nfor no fault of hers. Furthermore, the distinction of first\npregnancy of a married woman and that of an unmarried woman\ndoes not have any reasonable or rational basis and cannot be\nsupported.\n\nIn General Electric Company v. Martha V. Gilbert\nalthough the majority of the Judges of the U.S. Supreme\nCourt were of the opinion that exclusion of pregnancy did\nnot constitute any sex discrimination in violation of Title\nVII nor did it amount to gender based discrimination; three\njudges, namely Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ. dissented\nfrom this view and held that the pregnancy disability\nexlusion amounted to downgrading women's role in labour\nforce. The counsel for the Corporation relied on the\nmajority judgments of Rehnquist, Burger, Stewart, White and\nPowell, JJ. while the petitioners relied strongly on the\ndissenting opinion. We are inclined to accept the dissenting\nopinion which seems to take a more reasonable and rational\nview. Brennan, J. with whom Marshall, J. agreed, observed as\nfollows:\n\n\"(1) the record as to the history of the\nemployer's practices showed that the pregnancy\ndisability exclusion stemmed from a policy that\npurposefully downgraded women's role in the labour\nforce, rather than from gender neutral risk assignment\nconsiderations.\n\nStevens, J, while endorsing the view of Brennan, J.\nObserved thus :-\n\n\"The case presented only a question of statutory\nconstruction, and (2) the employers rule placed the\nrisk of absence caused by pregnancy in a class by\nitself, thus violating the statute as discriminating on\nthe basis of sex, since it was the capacity to become\npregnant which primarily differentiated the female from\nthe male.\"\n\nIn the instant case, if the Corporation has permitted\nthe AHs to marry after the expiry of four years then the\ndecision to terminate the services on first pregnancy seems\nto be wholly inconsistent and incongruous with the\nconcession given to the AHs by allowing them to marry.\nMoreover, the provision itself is so out rageous that it\nmakes a mockery of doing justice to the AHs on the\nimaginative plea that pregnancy will result in a number of\ncomplications which can easily be avoided as pointed out by\nus earlier. Mr. Setalvad cited a number of decisions of the\nU.S. Supreme Court on the question of sex but most of these\ndecisions may not be relevant because they are on the\nquestion of denial of equality of opportunity. In view of\nour finding, however, that AHs form a separate class from\nthe category consisting of AFPs, these authorities would\nhave no application particularly in view of the fact that\nthere is some difference between\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\nof\nour Constitution and the due-process-clause and the 14th\nAmendment of the American Constitution. This Court has held\nthat the provisions of the American Constitution cannot\nalways be applied to Indian conditions or to the provisions\nof our Constitution. While some of the principles adumbrated\nby the American\ndecisions may provide a useful guide yet this Court did not\nfavour a close adherence to those principles while applying\nthe same to the provisions of our Constitution, because the\nsocial conditions in this country are different.\nIn this\nconnection in the\nStare of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar,\nMukherjea, J\n, observed thus:-\n\n\"A number of American decisions have been cited\nbefore us on behalf of both parties in course of the\narguments; and while a too rigid adherenee to the views\nexpressed by the Judges of the Supreme Court of America\nwhile dealing with the equal protection clause in their\noWQ Constitution may not be necessary or desirable for\nthe purpose of determing the true meaning and scope of\n\narticle 14\nof the Indian Constitution, it cannot be\ndenied that the general principle enunciated in many of\nthese cases do afford considerable help and guidance in\nthe matter.\"\n\nSame view was taken in a later decision of this Court\nin\nA.S. Krishna v. State of Madras\nwhere it was held that\nthe due process clause in the American Constitution could\nnot apply to our Constitution. In this connection\nVenkatarama Ayyar, J. Observed thus:-\n\n\"The law would thus appear to be based on the due\nprocess clause, and it is extremely doubtful whether it\ncan have application under our Constitution.\"\n\nAt any rate, we shall refer only to those authorities\nwhich deal with pregnancy as amounting to per se\ndiscriminatory or arbitrary. In Clevel and Board of\nEducation v. Jo Caro1 La Flour the U.S. Supreme Court made\nthe following observations:-\n\n\"As long as the teachers are required to give\nsubstantial advance notice of their condition, the\nchoice of firm dates later in pregnancy would serve the\nboards objectives just as well, while imposing a far\nlesser burdern on the women's exercise of\nconstitutionally protected freedom.\n\n... ... ... ...\nWhile it might be easier for the school boards to\nconclusively presume that all pregnant women are unfit\nto teach past the fourth or firth month or even the\nfirst month, of pregnancy, administrative convenience\nalone is insufficient to make valid what otherwise is a\nviolation of due process of law. The Fourleenth\nAmendmeat requires the school boards to employ\nalternative administrative means, which do not so\nbroadly infringe upon basic contitutional liberty, in\nsupport of their legitimate goals.....\nWhile the regulations no doubt represent a good\nfaith attempt to acllieve a laudable goal, they cannnot\npass muster under the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, because they employ irrebuttable\npresumptions that unduly penalize a female teacher for\ndeciding to bear a child.\"\n\nThe observations made by the U.S. Supreme Court\nregarding the teachers fully apply to the case of the\npregnant AHs. In Sharron A. Frontiero v. L. Filliot L.\nRicharadson the following observations were made:\n\n\"Moreover, since sex, like race and national\norigin, is an immutable characteristic determined\nsolely by the accident of birth, the imposition of\nspecial disabilities upon the members of a particular\nsex because of their sex would seem to violate \"the\nbasic concept of our system that legal burdens should\nbear some relationship to individual responsibility.\"\n\nWhat is said about the fair sex by Judges fully applies\nto a pregnant woman because pregnancy also is not a\ndisability but one of the nlatural consequences of marriage\nand is an immutable charaeteristic of married life. Any\ndistinction therefore, made on the ground of pregnancy\ncannot but be held to be extremely arbitrary.\n\nln Mary Ann Turner v. Department of Employment Security\nthe U.S. Supreme Court severely criticised the maternity\nleave rules which required a teacher to quit her job several\nmonths before the expected child. In this connection the\ncourt observed as follows:\n\"The Court held that a school board's mandatory\nmaternity leave rule which required a teacher to quit\nher job several months before the expected birth of her\nchild and prohibited her return to work until three\nmonths after child birth violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment...the Constitution required a more\nindividualized approach to the question of the\nteacher's physical capacity to continue her employment\nduring pregnancy and resume her duties after childbirth\nsince \"the ability of any particular pregnant women to\ncontinue at work past any fixed time in her pregnancy\nis very much an individual matter.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that a substantial number of\nwomen are fully capable of working well into their last\ntrimester of pregnancy and of resuming employment\nshortly after childbirth.\n\nWe conclude that the Utah unemployment\ncompensation statute's incorporation of a conclusive\npresumption of incapacity during so long a period\nbefore and after childbirth is constitutionally invalid\nunder the principles of the La Fleur case \"\n\nWe fully endorse the observations made by the U.S.\nSupreme Court which, in our opinion, aptly apply to the\nfacts of the present case. By making pregnancy a bar to\ncontinuance in service of an AH the Corporation seems to\nhave made an individualised approach to a women's physical\ncapacity to continue her employment even after pregnancy\nwhich undoubtedly is a most unreasonable approach.\n\nSimilarly, very pregnant observations were made by the\nU.S. Supreme Court in City of Los Angeles, Department of\nWater and Power v. Marie Manhar thus:\n\n\"It is now well recognized that employment\ndecisions cannot be predicated on mere 'stereotyped'\nimpressions about the characteristics of males or\nfemales. Myths and purely habitual assumptions about a\nwoman's inability to perform certain kinds of work are\nno longer acceptable reasons for refusing to employ\nqualified individuals, or for paying them less....The\nquestion, therefore, is whether the existence or non-\nexistence of \"discrimination\" is to be deter-\nmined by comparison of class characteristics or\nindividual charcteristics. A 'stereotyped' answer to\nthat question may not be the same as the answer that\nthe language and purpose of the statute command.\n\n... ... ... ...\n\nEven if the statutory language were less clear,\nthe basic policy of the statute requires that we focus\non fairness to individuals rather than fairness to\nclasses. Practices that classify employees in terms of\nreligion, race, or sex tend to preserve traditional\nassumptions about groups rather than thoughtful\nscrutiny of individuals.\"\n\nThese observations also apply to the bar contained in\nthe impugned regulation against continuance of service after\npregnancy. In Bombay Labour Union Representing the Workmen\nof M/s. Inter national Pranchises Pvl. Ltd., v. M/s.\nInternational Pranchises Pvt. Ltd. this Court while dealing\nwith a rule barring married women from working in a\nparticular concern expressed views almost similar to the\nviews taken by the U.S. Supreme Court in the decisions\nreferred to above in that case a particular rule required\nthat unmarried women were to give up service on marriage-a\nrule which existed in the Regulations of the Corporation\nalso but appears to have been deleted now. In criticising\nthe validity of this rule this Court observed as follows :-\n\n\"We are not impressed by these reasons for\nretaining a rule of this kind. Nor do we think that\nbecause the work has to be done as a team it cannot be\ndone by married women. We also feel that there is\nnothing to show that married women would necessarily be\nmore likely to be absent than unmarried women or\nwidows. If it is the presence of children which may be\nsaid to account for greater absenteeism among married\nwomen, that would be so more or less in the case of\nwidows with children also. The fact that the work\nhas got to be done as a team and presence of all those\nworkmen is necessary, is in our opinion no\ndisqualification so far as married women are concerned.\nIt cannot be disputed that even unmarried\nwomen or widows are entitled to such leave as the\nrespondent's rules provide and they would be availing\nthemselves of these leave facilities.\"\n\nThese observations apply with equal force to the bar of\npregnancy contained in the impugned Regulation.\n\nIt was suggested by one of the Corporations that after\na woman becomes pregnant and bears children there may be lot\nof difficulties in her resuming service, the reason being\nthat her husband may not permit her to work as an AH. These\nreasons, however do not appeal to us because such\ncircumstances can also exist even without pregnancy in the\ncase of a married woman and if a married woman leaves the\njob, the Corporation will have to make arrangements for a\nsubstitute. Moreover, whether the woman after bearing\nchildren would continue in service or would find it\ndifficult to look after the children is her personal matter\nand a problem which affects the AH concerned and the\nCorporation has nothing to do with the same. These are\ncircumstances which happen in the normal course of business\nand cannot be helped. Suppose an AH dies or becomes\nincapacitated, it is manifest that the Corporation will have\nto make alternative arrangements for her substitute. In\nthese circumstances, therefore, we are satisfied that the\nreasons given for imposing the bar are neither logical nor\nconvincing.\n\nIn view of our recent decision explaining the scope of\n\nArt. 14\n, it has been held that any arbitrary or unreasonable\naction or provision made by the State cannot be upheld.\nIn\nM/s.\nDwarka Prasad Laxmi Naraian v. The State of Uttar\nPradesh & Ors.\nthis Court made the following observations:-\n\n\"Legislation, which arbitrarily or excessively\ninvades the right, cannot be said to contain the\nquality of reasonableness, and unless it strikes a\nproper balance between the freedom guaranteed under\n\narticle 19 (1) (g)\nand the social control permitted by\nclause (6) of\narticle 19\n, it must be held to be wanting\nin reasonableness.\"\n\nIn Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, Beg, C.J. Observed\nas follows:\n\"The view I have taken above proceeds on the\nassumption that there are inherent or natural human\nrights of the individual recognised by and embodied in\nour Constitution.. If either the reason sanctioned by\nthe law is absent, or the procedure followed in\narriving at the conclusion that such a reason exists is\nunreasonable, the order having the effect of\ndeprivation or restriction must be quashed.\"\n\nand Bhagwati, J. Observed thus:\n\n\"Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects\nand dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within\ntraditional and doctrinaire limits..\nArticle 14\nstrikes\nat arbitariness in State action and ensures fairness\nand equality of treatment. The principle of\nreasonableness, which legally as well as\nphilosophically, is an essential element of equality or\nnon-arbitrariness pervades\nArticle 14\nlike a brooding\nomnipresence.. It must be \"right and just and fair\" and\nnot arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive; otherwise, it\nwould be no procedure at all and the requirement of\n\nArticle 21\nwould not be satisfied.\"\n\nIn an earlier case in\nE.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil\nNadu and Anr. Similar\nobservations were made by this Court\nthus:\n\n\"In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn\nenemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic,\nwhile the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute\nmonarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in\nit that it is unequal both according to political logic\nand constitutional law and is therefore violative of\n\nArticle 14.\"\n\nIn\nState of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. v. Nalla Raja Reddy\nand Ors.\nthis Court made the following observations:\n\n\"Official arbitrariness is more subversive of the\ndoctrine of equality than statutory discrirnination. In\nrespect of a statutory discrimination one knows where\nhe stands, but the wand of official arbitrariness can\nbe waved in all directions indiscriminately.\"\nThe impugned provisions appear to us to be a clear case\nof official arbitrariness. As the impugned part of the\nregulation is severable from the rest of the regulation, it\nis not necessary for us to strike down the entire\nRegulation.\n\nFor the reasons given above, we strike down the last\nportion of regulation 46 (i) (c) and hold that the provision\n'or on first pregnancy whichever occurs earlier' is\nunconstitutional, void and is violative of\nArt. 14\nof the\nConstitution and will, therefore, stand deleted. It will,\nhowever, be open to the Corporation to make suitable\namendments in the light of our observations and on the lines\nindicated by Mr. Nariman in the form of draft proposals\nreferred to earlier so as to soften the rigours of the\nprovisions and make it just and reasonable. For instance,\nthe rule could be suitably amended so as to terminate the\nservices of an AH on third pregnancy provided two children\nare alive which would be both salutary and reasonable for\ntwo reasons. In the first place, the provision preventing\nthird pregnancy with two existing children would be in the\nlarger interest of the health of the AH concerned as also\nfor the good upbringing of the children. Secondly, as\nindicated above while dealing with the rule regarding\nprohibition of marriage within four years, same\nconsiderations would apply to a bar of third pregnancy where\ntwo children are already there because when the entire world\nis faced with the problem of population explosion it will\nnot only be desirable but absolutely essential for every\ncountry to see that the family planning programme is not\nonly whipped up but maintained at sufficient levels so as to\nmeet the danger of over population which, if not controlled,\nmay lead to serious social and economic problems throughout\nthe world. The next provision which has been the subject\nmatter of serious controversy between the parties, is the\none contained in regulation 46 (i) (c). According to this\nprovision, the normal age of retirement of an AH is 35 years\nwhich may at the option of the Managing Director be extended\nto 45 years subject to other conditions being satisfied. A\nsimilar regulation is to be found in the Rules made by the\nl.A.C. to which we shall refer hereafter. The question of\nfixation of retirement age of an AH is to be decided by the\nauthorities concerned after taking into consideration\nvarious factors such as the nature of the work, the\nprevailing conditions, the practice prevalent in other\nestablishments and the like.\nIn\nImperial Chemical Industries\n(India) Pvt. Ltd. v. The Workmen\n(1)\nthis Court pointed out that in fixing the age of retirement,\nchanging the terms and conditions of service, the\ndetermination of the age on industry-cum-region basis would\nundoubtedly be a relevant factor. In this connection,\nGajendragadkar, J. made the following further observations:\n\n\"There is no doubt that in fixing the age of\nretirement no hard and fast rule can be laid down. The\ndecision on the question would always depend on a\nproper assessment of the relevant factors and may\nconceivably vary from case\nSimilarly, in an earlier case in\nGuest, Keen, Williams\nPvt. Ltd. v. P. J. Sterling and Ors.\n(1) this Court made the\nfollowing observations:\n\n\"In fixing the age of superannuation industrial\ntribunals have to take into account several relevant\nfactors. What is the nature of the work assigned to the\nemployees in the course of their employment.. What is\ngenerally the practice prevailing in the industry in\nthe past in the matter of retiring its employees '?\nThese and other relevant facts have to be weighed by\nthe tribunal in every case when it is called upon to\nfix an age of superannuation in an industrial dispute.'\nIt is, therefore, manifest that the factors to be\nconsidered must be relevant and bear a close nexus to the\nnature of the organisation and the duties of the employees.\nWhere the authority concerned takes into account factors or\ncircumstances which are inherently irrational or illogical\nor tainted, the decision fixing the age of retirement is\nopen to serious scrutiny.\n\nThe stand taken by A.l. regarding this particular\nprovision is that there are several reasons which prompted\nthe Management to persuade the Government to make this\nRegulation. In the first place, it was contended that in\nview of the arduous and strenuous work that the AHs have to\nput in an early date of retirement is in the best interest\nof their efficiency and also in the interest of their\nhealth. Another reason advanced by A.l. is that several\nyears experience of the working of AHs shows\nthat quite a large number of them retire even before they A\nreach the age of 35; hence a lower age for retirement is\nfixed in their case under the Regulation with a provision\nfor extension in suitable cases. These reasons are no doubt\nunderstandable and prima facie appear to be somewhat sound.\nWe are, however, not quite sure if the premises on the basis\nof which these arguments have been put forward are really\ncorrect. In the present times with advancing medical\ntechnology it may not be very correct to say that a woman\nloses her normal faculties or that her efficiency is\nimpaired at the age of 35, 40 or 45, years. It is difficult\nto generalise a proposition like this which will have to\nvary from individual to individual. On the other hand, there\nmay be cases where an AFP may be of so weak and unhealthy a\nconstitution that he may not be able to function upto the\nage of 58, which is the age of retirement of AFP according\nto the Regulation. As, however, the distinction regarding\nthe age of retirement made by the Regulation between AHs and\nAFPs cannot be said to be discriminatory because AHs have\nbeen held by us to be a separate class yet we will have to\nexamine the provision from other points of view as well.\nAnother line of reasoning which has been placed before us\nand which smacks of a most perverse and morbid approach is\nto be found in para 9 of the counter-affidavit in vol. II of\nthe Paperbook where the following averments have been made:-\n\"With reference to paragraph 30 of the Affidavit,\nI repeat that Air Hostesses are recruited for providing\nattractive and pleasing service to passengers in a\nhighly competitive field and consequently stress is\nlaid on their appearance, youth, glamour and charm.\"\n\nWe are rather surprised that similar arguments made\nbefore the two Tribunals seem to have found favour with them\nbecause at page 204 (para 256) the Khosla Award having been\ncarried away by the arguments of the Corporation made the\nfollowing observations:\n\n\"They have to deal with passengers of various tem-\nperaments, and a young and attractive air hostess is\nable to cope with difficult or awkward situations more\ncompetently and more easily than an older person with\nless personal prepossession.\"\nWe fail to see how a young and attractive AH would be\nable to cope with difficult or awkward situations more\neffectively than others because smartness or beauty cannot\nbe the only hallmark of competency. Similar observations\nwere made by the Mahesh Tribunal in the following terms.\n\n\"The management claims this on the ground that the\ncabin crew service has to be attractive to passengers.\"\n\nThe argument that AHs should be young and attractive\nand should possess pleasing manners seems to suggest that\nAHs should by their sweet smiles and pleasant behaviour\nentertain and look after the passengers which cannot be done\nby women of older age. This argument seems to us to be based\non pure speculation and an artificial understanding of the\nqualities of the fair sex and, if we may say so, it amounts\nto an open insult to the institution of our sacred\nwomanhood. Such a morbid approach is totally against our\nancient culture and heritage as a woman in our country\noccupies a very high and respected position in the society\nas a mother, a wife, a companion and a social worker. It is\nidle to contend that young women with pleasing manners\nshould be employed so as to act as show pieces in order to\ncater to the varied tastes of the passengers when in fact\nolder women with greater experience and goodwill can look\nafter the comforts of the passengers much better than a\nyoung woman can. Even if the Corporation had been swayed or\ngoverned by these considerations, it must immediately banish\nor efface the same from its approach. More particularly such\nobservations coming from a prestigious Corporation like A.I.\nappear to be in bad taste and is proof positive of\ndenigration of the role of women and a demonstration of male\nchauvinism and verily involves nay discloses an element of\nunfavourable bias against the fair sex which is palpably\nunreasonable and smacks of pure official arbitrariness. The\nobservations of Sastri, C. J. in\nKathi Raning Rawat\n's case\n(supra) may be extracted thus:\n\n\"All legislative differentiation is not\nnecessarily discriminatory.. Discrimination this\ninvolves an element of unfavourable bias .. If such\nbias is disclosed.. it may well be that the statute\nwill, without more, incur condemnation as violating a\nspecific constitutional prohibition.\"\n\nAt any rate, it is not possible for us to entertain\nsuch an argument which must be rejected outright. In fact,\nthere is no\nsubstantial and weighty reason for upholding the impugned\nprovisions and this part of the line of reasoning adopted by\nthe respondent-Corporations cannot be countenanced.\n\nIn the same token it was contended by the counsel for\nthe petitioners that whereas the retirement age in a number\nof other international airlines is 50 to 55 years, there is\nno reasonable basis for keeping the retirement age of A.l.\nAHs at 35, extendable to 45 years. In proof of this argument\na chart was submitted before us of the various international\nairlines to show that the age of retirement of AHs of those\nairlines was much more than those of AHs employed by A.I.\nIn the first place, it is difficult to agree that the\nservice conditions which apply to foreign airlines, should\nprotanto apply to the employees of A.I. because the\nconditions of service including the age of retirement depend\non various geographical and economic factors. Sometimes a\nsmall country may be rich enough or in view of limited\nnumber of flights or small population, it can afford to keep\nthe AHs in service for a longer time. Local influences,\nsocial conditions and legal or political pressures may\naccount for the terms and conditions to be fixed in the case\nof the AHs employed by international airlines other than\nA.I. In view of these diverse factors, it is not possible to\neasily infer unfavourable treatment to the petitioners\nbecause certain more favourable conditions of service are\noffered by international airlines of other countries. For\ninstance, the retirement age of AHs in KLM (Royal Dutch) and\nGhana airlines is 50 years whereas in the case of Swiss\nairlines it is 57 and in the case of Malaysian airlines it\nis 45 years. In the case of Singapore airlines the\nretirement age of Check stewardess is 45 years. Similarly,\nin other airlines like Austrian, Germanair, Lufthansa and\nNigeria Airways the retirement age of female AHs is SS\nwhereas in the case of Air International, U.T.A. (France)\nand Air France it is SO. In case of Sudan Airways and\nBritish Airways the retirement age is 60 whereas in Nordair\n(Canada) and Transair (Canada) airlines the age is 65 years.\n\nA perusal of the scheme of retirement age given above\nwould clearly show that several considerations weigh with\nthe Governments or Corporations concerned in fixing the\nretirement age which would naturally differ from country to\ncountry having regard to the various factors mentioned\nabove. In fact, a similar grievance seems to have been made\nbefore the Mahesh Tribunal which also pointed\nout that the social conditions in Europe and other countries\nbeing different, the same rules could not apply to A.I. In\nthis connection, the Tribunal observed thus:\n\n\"There is no reason to have a different provision\nregarding the air hostesses in Air India. The social\nconditions in Europe and elsewhere are different from\nthe social conditions in India.\"\n\nIn this view of the matter the argument on this score\nmust be rejected. This Court has pointed out that there\ncannot be any cut and dried formula for determining the age\nof retirement which is to be linked with various\ncircumstances and a variety of factors.\n\nWe might further mention that even before the Mahesh\nTribunal, the stand taken by the AHs was merely that their\nage of retirement should be extended to 45 years and they\nnever put forward or suggested any claim to increase the\nretirement age to 58 which clearly shows that their present\nclaim is not merely belated but an afterthought particularly\nbecause the Mahesh Tribunal was dealing with this particular\ngrievance and if the AHs were really serious in getting\ntheir retirement age equated with that of the AFPs, i.e. 58,\nthey would not have failed to put forward this specific\nclaim before the Tribunal. This is yet another ground on\nwhich the claim of the AHs to be retired at the age of 58\ncannot be entertained because as we have already shown the\nAward binds the parties even though its period may have\nexpired.\n\nThis brings us now to the question as to whether or not\nthe impugned regulation suffers from any constitutional\ninfirmity as it stands. The fixation of the age of\nretirement of AHs who fall within a special class depends on\nvarious factors which have to be taken into consideration by\nthe employers. In the instant case, the Corporations have\nplaced good material before us to show some justification\nfor keeping the age of retirement at 35 years (extendable\nupto 45 years) but the regulation seems to us to arm the\nManaging Director with uncanalized and unguided discretion\nto extend the age of AHs at his option which appears to us\nto suffer from the vice of excessive delegation of powers.\nIt is true that a discretionary power may not necessarily be\na discriminatory power but where a statute confers a power\non an authority to decide matters of moment without laying\ndown any guidelines or principles\nor norms the power has to be struck down as being violative\nof\nArt. 14.\n\nThe doctrine of a provision suffering from the vice of\nexcessive delegation of power has been explained and\ndiscussed in several decisions of this Court.\nIn\nAnwar Ali\nSarkar\n's case (supra) which may justly be regarded as the\nlocus classicus on the subject, Fazal Ali, J. (as he then\nwas) clearly observed as follows:\n\n\"but the second criticism cannot be so easily met,\nsince an Act which gives uncontrolled authority to\ndiscriminate cannot but be hit by\narticle 14\nand it\nwill be no answer simply to say that the legislature\nhaving more or less the unlimited power to delegate has\nmerely exercised that power.\n\n... ... ... ...\n\nSecondly, the Act itself does not state that\npublic interest and administrative exigencies will\nprovide the occasion for its application. Lastly, the\ndiscrimination involved in the application of the Act\nis too evident to be explained away.\"\n\nand Mahajan, J. agreeing with the same expressed his views\nthus:\n\n\"The present statute suggests no reasonable basis\nor classification, either in respect of offences or in\nrespect of cases. It has laid down no yardstick or\nmeasure for the grouping either of persons or of cases\nor of offences by which measure these groups could be\ndistinguished from those who are outside the purview of\nthe\nSpecial Act\n.\nThe Act\nhas left this matter entirely\nto the unregulated discretion of the provincial\ngovernment.\"\n\nMukherjea, J. observed thus:\n\n\"In the case before us the language of\nsection\n5(1)\nis perfectly clear and free from any ambiguity. It\nvests an unrestricted discretion in the State\nGovernment to direct any cases or classes of cases to\nbe tried by the Special Court in accordance with the\nprocedure\nlaid down in\nthe Act.. l am definitely of\nopinion that the necessity of a speedier trial is too\nvague, uncertain and elusive a criterion\nto form a rational basis for the discriminations made\nBut the question is: how is this necessity of speedier\ntrial to be determined ? Not by reference to the nature\nof the offences or the circumstances under which or the\narea in which they are committed, nor even by reference\nto any peculiarities or antecedents of the offenders\nthemselves, but the selection is left to the absolute\nand unfettered discretion of the executive government\nwith nothing in the law to guide or control its action.\nThis is not a reasonable classification at all but an\narbitrary selection.\"\n\nand Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J. elucidated the law thus:\n\n\"\nIf the Act\ndoes not state what exactly are the\noffences which in its opinion need a speedier trial and\nwhy it is so considered, a mere statement in general\nwords of the object sought to be achieved, as we find\nin this case, is of no avail because the\nclassification, if any, is illusive or evasive. The\npolicy or idea behind the classification should at\nleast be adumbrated, if not staled, so that the Court\nwhich has to decide on the constitutionality might be\nseized of something on which it could base its view\nabout the propriety of the enactment from the\nstandpoint of discrimination or equal protection. Any\narbitrary division or ridge will render the equal\nprotection clause moribund or lifeless.\nApart from the absence of any reasonable or\nrational classification, we have in this case the\nadditional feature of a carte blanche being given to\nthe State Government to send any offences or cases for\ntrial by a Special Court.\"\n\nand Bose, J. held thus:\n\n\"It is the differentiation which matters; the\nsingling out of cases or groups of cases, or even of\noffences or classes of offences, of a kind fraught with\nthe most serious consequences to the individuals\nconcerned, for special, and what some would regard as\npeculiar, treatment.\"\n\nThe five Judges whose decisions we have extracted\nconstituted the majority decision of the Bench.\nIn\nLala Hari Chand Sard v. Mizo District Council and\nAnr.\nit was highlighted that where a Regulation does not\ncontain any principles or standard for the exercise of the\nexecutive power, it was a bad regulation as being violative\nof\nArt. 14.\nIn this connection, the Court observed as\nfollows:-\n\n\"A perusal of Regulation shows that it nowhere\nprovides any principles or standards on which the\nExecutive Committee has to act in granting or refusing,\nto grant the licence...There being no principles or\nstandards\nlaid down in\nthe Regulation there are\nobviously no restraints or limits within which the\npower of the Executive Committee to refuse to grant or\nrenew a licence is to be exercised.. The power of\nrefusal is thus left entirely unguided and untrammeled.\n\n... ... ... ...\n\nA provision which leaves an unbridled power to an\nauthority cannot in any sense be characterised as\nreasonable.\nSection 3\nof the Regulation is one such\nprovision and is therefore liable to be struck down as\nviolative of\nArt. 19 (1) (g).\"\n\nTo the same effect is another decision of this Court in\n\nState of Mysore v. S.R. Jayaram\nwhere the following\nobservations were made:\n\n\"The Rules are silent on the question as to how\nthe Government is to find out the suitability of a\ncandidate for a particular cadre... It follows that\nunder the latter part of r.9 (2) it is open to the\nGovernment to say at its sweet will that a candidate is\nmore suitable for a particular cadre and to deprive him\nof his opportunity to join the cadre for which he\nindicated his preference.\n\n... ... ... ...\n\nWe hold that the latter part of r. 9 (2) gives the\nGovernment an arbitrary power of ignoring the just\nclaims\nof successful candidates for recruitment to offices\nunder the State. It is violative of Arts. 14 and 16 (1)\nof the Constitution and must be struck down.\"\n\nHere also the Rules were struck down because no\nprinciple or guidelines were given by the statute to\ndetermine the suitability of a particular candidate.\n\nRegulation 46 (i) (c) provides that an AH would retire\non attaining the age of 35 years or on marriage if it takes\nplace within four years of service. The last limb of this\nprovision relating to first pregnancy in the case of AHs has\nalready been struck down by us and the remaining sub-clause\n\n(c) has to be read with Regulation 47 which provides that\nthe services of any employee may, at the option of the\nManaging Director, on the employee being found medically\nfit, be extended by one year beyond the age of retirement,\nthe aggregate period not exceeding two years. This provision\napplies to employees who retire at the age of 58. So far as\nthe AHs are concerned, under the Regulation the discretion\nis to be exercised by the Managing Director to extend the\nperiod upto ten years. In other words, the spirit of the\nRegulation is that an AH, if medically fit, is likely to\ncontinue upto the age of 45 by yearly extensions given by\nthe Managing Director. Unfortunately, however, the real\nintention of the makers of the Regulations has not been\ncarried out because the Managing Directors has been given an\nuncontrolled, unguided and absolute discretion to extend or\nnot to extend the period of retirement in the case of AHs\nafter 35 years. The words 'at the option' are wide enough to\nallow the Managing Director to exercise his discretion in\nfavour of one AH and not in favour of the other which may\nresult in discrimination. The Regulation does not provide\nany guidelines, rules, or principles which may govern the\nexercise of the discretion by the Managing Director.\nSimilarly, there is also no provision in the Regulation\nrequiring the authorities to give reason for refusing to\nextend the period of retirement of AHs. The provision does\nnot even give any right of appeal to higher authorities\nagainst the order passed by the Managing Director. Under the\nprovision, as it stands, the extension of the retirement of\nan AH is entirely at the mercy and sweet will of the\nManaging Director. The conferment of such a wide and\nuncontrolled power on the Managing Director is clearly\nviolative of\nArt. 14\n, as the provision suffers from the vice\nof excessive delegation of powers.\nFor these reasons, therefore, we have no alternative\nbut to strike down as invalid that part of Regulation 47\nwhich gives option to the Managing Director to extend the\nservice of an AH. The effect of striking down this provision\nwould be that an AH, unless the provision is suitably\namended to bring it in comformity with the provisions of\n\nArt. 14\nwould continue to retire at the age of 45 years and\nthe Managing Director would be bound to grant yearly\nextensions as a matter of course, for a period of ten years\nif the AH is found to be medically fit. This will prevent\nthe Managing Director from discriminating between one AH and\nanother.\n\nSo far as the case of the AHs employed by I.A.C. is\nconcerned, the same reasons which we have detailed in the\ncase of AHs employed by A.T. would apply with slight\nmodifications which we shall indicate hereafter. So far as\nthe organisation of AHs employed by T.A.C. is concerned, the\ncabin crew consisting of males are known as flight stewards\n(F.S.) and those consisting of females as AHs. There are 105\nposts of FSs and 517 of AHs. It is also not disputed that\njob functions of F.S. and the AHs are the same and in fact\nthere are some flights in which the cabin crew consists only\nof AHs. But like the A.I. AHs, the mode of recruitment,\nconditions of service, etc, are quite different in the case\nof F.S.s and AHs. The I.A.C. also contended that FSs and AHs\nare two different categories with different avenues of\npromotion. As in the case of A.I. AHs, a declaration under\nthe 1976 Act has also been made in the case of IAC, AHs.\n\nThe promotional avenues so far as the AHs are concerned\nare: AH, Dy. Chief AH, and Chief AH. It is also alleged by\nthe Management and not disputed by the petitioners, that FSs\nand AHs have got separate seniority and their promotion is\nmade according to the separate seniority of each Further,\nwhile the AHs have to do a minimum period of three years,\nFSs are required to serve for five years. Gratuity is\npayable to AHs after completion of S years' service whereas\nin the case of FSs it is payable after completion of 15\nyears of service. Similarly, retiral concessional passage is\ngiven to AHs after completion of four years of service\nwhereas to FSs it is given after completion of seven years\nof service. It may be specially noticed that while long\nservice memento is given to an AH after completion of ten\nyears of service, to a FS it is given after completion of 25\nyears of service. Retirement benefit is given to an AH on\ncompletion of 15 years of service whereas to an F.S. it is\ngiven after 30 years of service. Finally, retiral benefits\nare given to an AH after completion of 10 years of service\nbut\nin the case of F.S. after twenty years of Service. These\nretiral benefits are really meant to compensate the AHs\nbecause they have to retire at the age of 35, extendable up\nto 40, though the F.Ss retire at the age of 58 years.\n\nWe might stress at the risk of repetition that in\n\nState of Mysore v. M.N. Krishna Murthy and Ors.\nthis Court\nclearly held that where classes of service are different,\ninequality of promotional avenues was legally permissible.\nIn this connection, Beg, J. speaking for the Court observed\nas follows:\n\n\"If, on the facts of a particular case, the\nclasses to be considered are really different,\ninequality of opportunity in promotional chances may be\njustifiable.\"\n\nThus, there can be no doubt that the case of I.A.C. AHs\nis exactly similar to the case of A.I. AHs and hence the\ncomplaint of discrimination made by the petitioners has no\nsubstance.\n\nThe next argument is almost the same as in the case of\nA.I. AHs, namely, retirement on first pregnancy and on\nmarriage within four years and retirement at 35 years\nextendable to 40 years.\n\nSo far as the age of retirement and termination of\nservice on first pregnancy is concerned a short history of\nthe Rules made by the I.A.C. may be given.\nRegulation 12\nas\nit stood may be extracted thus:\n\n\"Flying Crew shall be retained in the service of\nthe Corporation only for so long as they remain\nmedically fit for flying duties.. Further, an Air\nHostess shall retire from the service of Corporation on\nher attaining the age of 30 years or when she gets\nmarried whichever is earlier. An unmarried Air Hostess\nmay, however, in the interest of the Corporation be\nretained in the service of the Corporation upto the age\nof 35 years with the approval of the General Manager.\"\n\nIt is obvious that under this Rule an AH had to retire\nat the age of 30 years or when she got married and an\nunmarried AH\ncould continue upto 35 years. The rule was obviously unjust\nand discriminatory and was therefore amended by a\nNotification published in the Gazette of India dated\n13.7.1968. The amended rule ran thus:\n\n\"An Air Hostess shall retire from the service of\nthe Corporation on her attaining the age of 30 years or\nwhen she gets married, whichever is earlier. The\nGeneral Manager, may however, retain in the service an\nunmarried Air Hostess upto the age of 35 years.\"\n\nThis amendment continued the bar of marriage but gave\ndiscretion to the General Manager to retain an unmarried AH\nupto 35 years. In order, however, to bring the provision in\nline with the A.I. Regulation, the I.A.C. Regulation was\nfurther amended by a Notification dated 12.4.80 published in\nPart III,\nSection 4\n, Gazette of India by which para 3 of\n\nRegulation 12\nwas substituted thus:-\n\n\"An Air Hostess shall retire from the service of\nthe Corporation upon attaining the age of 35 years or\non marriage if it takes place within four years of\nservice or on first pregnancy, whichever occurs\nearlier.\"\n\nIt appears that by a Settlement dated 10-1-1972, which\nwas accepted and relied upon by the Mahesh Tribunal the\nfollowing clause was incorporated in the Rule:\n\n\"An Air Hostess shall retire from the service of\nthe Corporation on her attaining the age of 30 years or\nwhen she gets married, whichever is earlier. The\nGeneral Manager may, however, retain in service an\nunmarried air hostess upto the age of 40 years.\"\n\nThe first part of this Regulation has become redundant\nin view of the Notification dated 12.4.80\n,\nreferred to\nabove\n, but the latter part which gives the General Manager a\nblanket power to retain an AH till the age of 40 years,\nstill remains. As, however, the bar of marriage is gone, the\nRules of 1972 which empower the General Manager to retain an\nAH in service will have to be read as a power to retain an\nAH upto the age of 40 years. Thus, the Notification as also\nthe Rules suffer from two serious constitutional infirmities\nwhich are present in the case of Regulation 46 framed by\nthe A.I. The clauses regarding retirement and pregnancy will\nhave to be held as unconstitutional and therefore struck\ndown. Secondly, for the reasons that we have given in the\ncase of A.I. AHs that Regulation 46 contains an unguided and\nuncontrolled power and therefore suffers from the vice of\nexcessive delegation of powers, on a parity of reasoning the\npower conferred on the General Manager to retain an AH upto\nthe age of 40 years will have to be struck down as invalid\nbecause it does not lay down any guidelines or principles.\nFurthermore, as the cases of A.I. AHs and I.A.C. AHs are\nidentical, an extension upto the age 45 in the case of one\nand 40 in the case of other, amounts to discrimination inter\nse in the same class of AHs and must be struck down on that\nground also.\n\nThe result of our striking down these provisions is\nthat like A.I. AHs, I.A.C. AHs also would be entitled to\ntheir period of retirement being extended upto 45 years\nuntil a suitable amendment is made by the Management in the\nlight of the observations made by us.\n\nFor the reasons given above, therefore, the writ\npetitions are allowed in part as indicated in the judgment\nand the Transfer case is disposed of accordingly. So long as\nthe Rule of I.A.C. is not amended the General Manager will\ncontinue to extend the age of retirement of I.A.C. AHs upto\n45 years subject to their being found medically fit. In the\ncircumstances of the case, there will be no order as to\ncosts.\n\nN.K.A. Petitions partly allowed.",
