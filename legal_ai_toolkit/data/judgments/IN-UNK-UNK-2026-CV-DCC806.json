No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 14/29\n imputed against her by the police and the recoveries were planted.\n\nShe stated that she does not know any Amit Saxena or Shah Nawaj at\n\nall. She stated that she does not know as to what was happening\n\naround her at that time. She was pregnant and was a diabetes patient\n\nand, therefore, she refused to take part in TIP. She did not make any\n\ndisclosure statement but was made to sign on blank papers. She also\n\nstated that police had arrested Anthony William Messy - her\n\ncolleague and brought him to her house in custody in early hours on\n\n22/23.09.2008 and thereafter she was falsely implicated in the present\n\ncase. Initially, she stated that she does not wish to lead any defence\n\ndefence but subsequently, an application under \nSection 315\n Cr.P.C\n\nwas filed by her to herself step in the witness box and in the interest\n\nof justice, the said application was allowed and the accused herself\n\ndeposed as DW-1. She stated that on 24.09.2008, she was in custody\n\nregarding a case of P.S. Dwarka. She does not know anything\n\nregarding Amit Saxena. She was told about this case when she was\n\nin judicial custody. She stated that she is a patient of diabetes and\n\nthere was no occasion for her to give any cold drink to him, which\n\ncontained intoxicants. She placed on record a medical certificate in\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 15/29\n this regard as Ex. DW1/A. She stated that she was also arrested in\n\nanother FIR No. 314/08 under \nSection 328\n/\n379\n/\n411\n IPC of P.S.\n\nDefence Colony, in which she was acquitted on 25.07.2011 and a\n\ncertified copy of that judgment was proved as Ex. DW1/B. She\n\nstated that she was convicted in FIR No. 541/08\n u/s 302\n/\n328\n/\n34\n IPC.\n\nShe stated that she is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this\n\ncase. In her cross-examination by the Ld. Addl. PP, she could not\n\ntell as to why and how she was identified in court by Ami Saxena and\n\nShah Nawaj. She admitted that she was arrested on 24.09.2008 by\n\nofficials of P.S. Dwarka from her house. She could not tell as to why\n\nshe was involved in cases of similar type of offences.\n\n6. Ld. Addl. PP argued that the prosecution has been able to prove\n\nits case beyond all reasonable doubts. It is stated that the victim/\n\ninformant Amit Kumar Saxena has identified the accused in the court\n\nand has supported the prosecution case. The poisoning of the\n\ninformant was duly proved by PW-4 Dr. Anil Mota. The stolen\n\narticles were recovered from the house of the accused when she was\n\narrested on 24.09.2008 in FIR No. 541/08 of P.S. Dwarka. The\n\ninformant/victim has identified the stolen articles in judicial TIP. The\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 16/29\n accused had refused to take part in judicial TIP. The accused had also\n\nstolen the mobile phone and purse of another victim PW-16 Shah\n\nNawaj, who has also identified the accused in the court. On these\n\ngrounds, the conviction under \nSection 328\n and \n379\n IPC has been\n\nprayed by the prosecution.\n\n7. Ld. Counsel for the accused has filed written arguments\n\nwithout addressing any oral arguments. It has been stated that the\n\nprosecution case of giving intoxicating substance by the accused to\n\nthe victim is highly improbable as both of them were strangers and\n\nnobody would accept that a stranger would give cold drink. It has\n\nbeen stated that the alleged incident took place on a busy road and it\n\nis not possible that the same would not be witnessed by anybody. It\n\nhas been stated that no receipt for purchase of mobile phone and\n\nother articles was with the complainant. There is a delay of six days\n\nin registration of case. Even the original discharge summary of the\n\ncomplainant from Max Balaji Hospital was not filed, which creates\n\ndoubt regarding his discharge. It is stated that the articles were\n\nrecovered by the IO of P.S. Dwarka but they were not sealed. There\n\nare no signatures of the complainant on the site plan which creates\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 17/29\n doubt about its preparation or his visit to the spot alongwith the IO.\n\nIt has been stated that the prosecution has failed to prove its case\n\nbeyond doubts and the benefit of doubt be given to the accused and\n\nshe be acquitted.\n\n8. I have heard both the sides and have perused the records of the\n\ncase. Accused has faced trial for the offences\n u/s 328\n/\n379\n/\n411\n IPC\n\nread with \nsection 120-B\n IPC. \nSection 328\n IPC deals with the offence\n\nof causing hurt by means of poison etc. with intent to commit an\n\noffence. The section inter-alia prescribes punishment for the person\n\nwho administers any intoxicating drug or other thing with intent to\n\ncause hurt to a person. In order to prove the offence\n u/s 328\n IPC\n\nprosecution is obliged to prove that accused administered poison with\n\nthe intention or knowledge that it is likely to cause hurt.\n\n9. The offence of theft is defined under \nsection 378\n IPC as\n\nwhoever intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of\n\npossession of any person without consent of that person, in order to\n\ntake such property, is said to commit theft. Hence, in order to prove\n\nthe offence of theft the article moved should be movable property; it\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 18/29\n should have been moved out of the possession of the person without\n\nhis consent; and that the accused should have done it with dishonest\n\nintention.\n\n10. Except for the victim himself, there is no other eye witness of\n\nthis case. PW-1 Amit Kumar Saxena is the victim, who deposed to\n\nhave met the accused on 18.09.2008 between 6:00-7:00 p.m at Saket\n\nMall and at the suggestion of the accused, they went to a grocery\n\nshop in the mall, from where the accused picked up two drinks and\n\nhe paid for the same. Then, they came out of the mall and the\n\naccused suggested that she knows a place outside the mall where they\n\ncould talk. He took the car behind the mall where she asked him to\n\npark the car in front of a pan shop and asked him to get her a bottle of\n\nwater from the pan shop. When he came back with the water bottle,\n\nshe had already opened the coffee drink and offered it to him. He sat\n\nin the car, drank the coffee and within seconds, he lost his\n\nconsciousness. Next morning, he found his purse, lap-top, car stereo\n\nand other belongings to be missing and he was taken to hospital. He\n\nidentified the accused in the court. He also stated to have identified\n\nhis lap-top, car stereo, one credit card, DL and mobile phone on\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 19/29\n 04.10.2008 in TIP at Patiala House Courts. He stated that he also\n\nwent to Tihar Jail on 10.10.2008 for the purpose of identification of\n\naccused but he was told that she does not want to take part in the\n\nidentification proceedings.\n\n11. PW-4 Dr. Anil Mota proved the discharge summary of the\n\nvictim as Ex.PW4/A, according to which, he was admitted on\n\n19.09.2008 and was discharged on 21.09.2008 and he was diagnosed\n\nfor 'unknown poisoning'.\n\n12. Accused Eva was arrested on 24.9.2008 by PW 15 Inspector\n\nSudhir Singh and she got recovered laptop, mobile, wrist watch, car\n\nstereo mouth, ID cards etc. from her house. These articles were\n\nidentified by the victim in TIP carried out by PW-13 Sh. Sameer\n\nBajpai, Ld. MM. PW-5 Ct. Sheela and PW-8 HC Ramesh Chand\n\nalso deposed about recoveries and arrest of the accused on 24.9.2008.\n\n13. Apart from the victim of this case, yet another victim namely\n\nPW-16 Shahnawaj also deposed regarding his experience with the\n\naccused when he was given some substance in tea whereafter he\n\nbecame unconscious and lost his mobile phone and purse. He also\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 20/29\n identified the accused in the court as the girl who had given him the\n\ntea, and after drinking the tea he had become unconscious.\n\n14. PW-17 SI Praveen Kumar proved disclosure statements and\n\nseizure memos of FIR No. 541/08\n u/s 302\n/\n328\n/\n341\n IPC PS Dwarka in\n\nwhich she was arrested. In her disclosure she had stated that she used\n\nto have Ativan 2 mg tablets which had intoxicating effect. She also\n\ndisclosed to have administered intoxicating tablets to one Amit in the\n\nmonth of August and thereafter to have robbed him of his mobile\n\nphones, car stereo mouth etc. and thereafter to have left him in car\n\nnear AIIMS area. In one of the seizure memos, 20 pills of Ativan 2\n\nmg were recovered from the handbag of the accused.\n\n15. There is yet another circumstance which is against the accused.\n\nSuggestions were given to the victim that taking advantage of the\n\ndarkness, he tried to molest the accused and she left the spot for\n\ngoing to police station and out of fear, he implicated her in a false\n\ncase. The victim denied this suggestion. Another suggestion was put\n\nto him that he had himself taken stupefying pills to stress out and\n\nmade false complaint to police. However, the victim denied this\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 21/29\n suggestion as well.\n\n16. In the statement of the accused recorded u/s 313 Cr PC, no\n\nsuch thing was stated by the accused. Nor she stated such a thing\n\nwhen she herself entered the witness box. All this show that the\n\nhollowness of defence of the accused and thus strengthens the\n\nprosecution case.\n\n17. She admitted as DW-1 that she was earlier convicted in FIR\n\nNo. 541/08\n u/s 302\n/\n328\n/\n34\n IPC of PS Dwarka but was acquitted in\n\nanother FIR No. 314/08\n u/s 328\n/\n379\n/\n411\n IPC of PS Defence Colony.\n\nIn her cross examination she could not give any reply as to why she\n\nwas involved in similar type of offences nor she could give any reply\n\nas to why she was identified by Amit Saxena and Shahnawaj.\n\n18. The accused did not take part in TIP. No reasonable\n\nexplanation was offered by her for not participating in TIP. She only\n\nstated that she did not know what was happening around her at that\n\ntime. She was pregnant and was a patient of diabetes and therefore\n\nshe refused to take part in TIP. However, this stand is contrary to the\n\nstand taken by her earlier at the time of TIP. At that time, she refused\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 22/29\n to take part in TIP on the ground that she had already been shown to\n\nthe witness. In view of the contradictory stands taken by the accused\n\nfor not taking part in the judicial TIP, adverse inference is to be\n\ndrawn against the accused.\n\n19. The arguments of the defence were that the accused and the\n\nvictim were not known to each other and it was improbable that one\n\nwould accept drink from a stranger. The argument made is meritless.\n\nFirst of all there is no improbability in such an offer and secondly, the\n\nvictim was admitted in hospital with unknown poisoning which\n\nconfirms that the coffee drink consumed by the victim was laced with\n\nsedative. The accused in her examination u/s 313 Cr PC stated that\n\nshe herself was diabetic and hence there was no occasion for her to\n\noffer such a drink to the victim is contrary to record. This\n\nexplanation given by the accused is not worth while and does not\n\nappeal to reason. There is no reason as to why the accused would\n\nimplicate the accused in this case.\n\n20. An argument was made that the original discharge summary\n\nwas not produced and hence the very creation of the discharge\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 23/29\n summary is doubtful. The argument lacks merit. A copy of the\n\ndischarge summary was filed alongwith the charge sheet. In her\n\nreply to the question put to her in her SA, that the discharge summary\n\nwas proved according to which the victim was diagnosed to be\n\nsuffering from 'unknown poisoning', she replied 'I do not know'.\n\nThen she herself entered the witness box and stated that she herself\n\nbeing a diabetic, she had no occasion for giving drink to him which\n\ncontained intoxicants. These stands taken by the accused show the\n\nhollowness of her claims.\n\n21. Another argument made was with respect to there being no\n\nwitness of the incident. The victim was given intoxicating substance\n\nin the car whereafter he became unconscious and thereafter theft was\n\ncommitted. As such, there was no occasion for the independent\n\npersons to witness the offence. In case there are public persons who\n\nhad witnessed the offence, then it becomes incumbent upon the\n\nprosecution to examine them, but if the incident was not witnessed by\n\nany independent person, no defect can be attached to non\n\nexamination of such independent witnesses. There is thus no\n\nsubstance in the argument in this regard.\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 24/29\n\n 22. Next objection raised was that no receipt of mobile phone etc.\n\nwas brought on record. In the cross examination of the victim, he\n\nhad replied that he had purchased the mobile etc. from UK. A\n\nsuggestion was put to him that he did not purchase them from UK but\n\nhe denied the suggestion. Moreover, the witness had identified his\n\narticles in judicial TIP. As such, no benefit can be drawn from this\n\ncircumstance.\n\n23. Yet another objection was that there was a delay of 6 days in\n\nregistration of case. The incident in question took place on\n\n18.9.2008. The victim was admitted in hospital on 19.9.2008 and he\n\nremained there till 21.9.2008. The victim was cross examined in\n\ndetail but no question was put to him regarding delay. FIR was\n\nregistered at 2 Pm whereas the accused was arrested on 24.9.2008 at\n\n5.45 PM. So, in any case, the FIR had been registered before arrest\n\nof the accused in other FIR No. 541/08 of PS Dwarka. Thus, delay\n\nin registration of case is not fatal.\n\n24. Similarly, non sealing of case property at the time of recovery\n\nis not fatal as the recoveries were not case property of FIR 541/08.\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 25/29\n And when the case properties of the present FIR were seized by the\n\nIO thereafter he deposited the same in maalkhana. Likewise, non-\n\ntaking of signatures of victim of the site plan is not that serious.\n\nThese lapses on the part of investigating agency cannot make the\n\nprosecution case wholly unreliable. In Dharmendra Singh vs. State\n\nof Gujarat 2002 Cr LJ 2631, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n\ndefective or doubtful investigation does not necessarily lead to\n\ndiscredit the main prosecution case if prosecution evidence inspires\n\nand circumstances lead to such a conclusion and the prosecution\n\nstory rings truth.\n\n25. It is not the law that whenever there is a discrepancy, invari-\n\nably its benefit has to go to the accused. Only in the case of major\n\ndiscrepancies, which make the prosecution case absolutely unaccept-\n\nable, that such a benefit can go to an accused but if the discrepancy is\n\nonly minor in nature, no fatality can be attached to it. In \nA. Shankar\nvs. State of Karnataka\n 2011 (6) SCC 279, Hon'ble Supreme Court made\n\nfollowing observations in this regard:\n\n 17. In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur\n in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation,\n namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental\n disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence.\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 26/29\n Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating a serious\n doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also\n make material improvement while deposing in the court, such\n evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. However, minor\n contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on\n trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case,\n should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be\n rejected in its entirety. The court has to form its opinion about the\n credibility of the witness and record a finding as to whether his\n deposition inspires confidence. \"Exaggerations per se do not render\n the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the factors to test credibility\n of the prosecution version, when the entire evidence is put in a\n crucible for being tested on the touchstone of credibility.\" Therefore,\n mere marginal variations in the statements of a witness cannot be\n dubbed as improvements as the same may be elaborations of the\n statement made by the witness earlier. \"Irrelevant details which do\n not in any way corrode the credibility of a witness cannot be labelled\n as omissions or contradictions.\" The omissions which amount to\n contradictions in material particulars, i.e., materially affect the trial or\n core of the prosecution's case, render the testimony of the witness\n liable to be discredited. \n[Vide: State Represented by Inspector of\n Police v. Saravanan & Anr., AIR 2009 SC 152; \nArumugam v. State\n,\n AIR 2009 SC 331; \nMahendra Pratap Singh v. State of Uttar\n Pradesh\n, (2009) 11 SCC 334; Dr. Sunil Kumar Sambhudayal Gupta\n & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, JT 2010 (12) SC 287; \nVijay @\n Chinee v. State of M.P.\n, (2010) 8 SCC 191; \nState of U.P. v. Naresh\n & Ors.\n, (2011) 4 SCC 324; and \nBrahm Swaroop & Anr. v. State of\n U.P.\n, AIR 2011 SC 280].\n\n26. Similarly, in the case of \nSucha Singh & Anr. v. State of Punjab\n\n[(2003) 7 SCC 643] Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:\n\n \n\"20. Exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt must\n not nurture fanciful doubts or lingering suspicion and thereby\n destroy social defence. Justice cannot be made sterile on the\n plea that it is better to let hundred guilty escape than punish an\n innocent. Letting guilty escape is not doing justice according to\n law. (See \nGurbachan Singh v. Satpal Singh & Ors.\n (AIR 1990\n SC 209).\n \nProsecution is not required to meet any and every\n hypothesis put forward by the accused (See \nState of U.P. v.\n Ashok Kumar Srivastava\n (AIR 1992 SC 840). A reasonable\n doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or merely possible doubt, but a\n fair doubt based upon reason and common sense.\n It must grow\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 27/29\n out of the evidence in the case. If a case is proved perfectly, it is\n argued that it is artificial; if a case has some flaws inevitable\n because human beings are prone to err, it is argued that it is too\n imperfect. One wonders whether in the meticulous\n hypersensitivity to eliminate a rare innocent from being\n punished, many guilty persons must be allowed to escape. Proof\n beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a fetish. \n(See \nInder\n Singh and another v. State (Delhi Admn\n.) (AIR 1978 SC 1091.\n Vague hunches cannot take place of judicial evaluation. 'A\n Judge does not preside over a criminal trial, merely to see that\n no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see that\n a guilty man, does not escape. Both are public duties.'\n \n(Per\n Viscount Simen in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutor\n 91944 AC (PC 315) quoted in \nState of U.P. v. Anil Singh\n (AIR\n 1988 SC 1998). Doubts would be called reasonable if they are\n free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any\n favourite other than truth.\"\n\n27. So far as \nSection 411\n IPC is concerned, this Section penalize\n\ndishonest receiving of stolen property. \nIn \nTrimbak vs. State\n AIR\n\n1954 SC 39 it was laid down that in order to bring home the guilt of a\n\nperson under this section, prosecution must prove, amongst other\n\nthings, that some person other than the accused, had possession of the\n\nproperty before the accused got possession thereof. In other words,\n\naccused must have got possession of the stolen articles from other\n\nperson and he should have retained them knowing that those are\n\nstolen articles. It thus postulates that there should be a thief and\n\nanother person to retain the goods.\n One who commits theft and keeps\n\nthe stolen articles himself will thus only be liable to conviction u/s\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 28/29\n 379 and not\n u/s 411\n IPC. Accused is thus acquitted\n u/s 411\n IPC.\n\n28. If the deposition of all these witnesses is read together, it is\n\nfound that the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond\n\ndoubt. Statement of victim has its own sanctity. Nothing has come\n\non record as to why the accused would be falsely implicated by the\n\nvictim. Accused refused to take part in TIP for no plausible reason.\n\nHe identified the accused in Court. His stolen articles were\n\nrecovered from the accused. Sedative tablets were recovered from\n\nthe accused from her handbag. The articles were identified by the\n\nvictim in judicial TIP. There is thus no reason to disbelieve these\n\ncircumstances. Prosecution has been able to prove that accused\n\nadministered some sedative to the victim and thereafter she caused\n\ntheft of his belongings. All the ingredients of the offences\n u/s 328\n\nand \n379\n IPC are fulfilled. The accused is thus convicted for the\n\noffences\n u/s 328\n and \n379\n IPC.\n\nAnnounced in the open Court. (Rajeev Bansal)\nDated:12.03.2014 ASJ-3/South District\n Saket Courts, New Delhi\n\nS.C.

Ld. Counsel has stated that the convict lost her father when\nshe was eighteen years of age. Her second husband John has also\nabandoned her. It is also stated that the convict is facing problems in\njail due to her pregnancy and is presently in MI Room of jail. Further,\nit has been stated that the convict has already undergone custody of\nabout three and half years during the trial of this case and hence a\nlenient view may be taken against her and she may be awarded the\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 30/29\n sentence of the period already undergone by her.\n\n Ld. Addl. PP, on the other hand, has prayed for\nmaximum sentence.\n\n I have heard both the sides and have perused the records\nof the case. \nSection 328\n IPC prescribes for a punishment of either\ndescription for a term upto ten years and with fine. \nSection 379\n IPC\nprescribes a punishment of either description for a term upto three\nyears or with fine or with both.\n\n Records show that the convict was arrested on\n25.09.2008 and she was released from jail on 15.02.2012 on bail.\nShe has thus already undergone custody of more than 40 months\nduring the course of trial. The convict is in family way and is\nexpected to deliver on 15.08.2014. Although, the offence of the\nconvict does not deserve any lenient view but purely taking into\nconsideration the circumstance that the convict is already in family\nway and her daughter is only five years of age and that she has\nalready undergone a custody of about 40 months during the course of\ntrial of the present case, the convict is awarded the sentence of the\nperiod already undergone by her for the offences under \nSection\n328\n and \n379\n IPC. The convict shall, however, pay fine of Rs.\n10,000/- for the offence under \nSection 328\n IPC and in default of\npayment of fine, she shall suffer simple imprisonment for a\nperiod of three months.\n\n At this stage, fine amount of Rs. 10,000/- has been\ndeposited in the court.\n\n Convict be released from jail, if not required in any other\n\nS.C. No. 45/10 FIR No. 698/08 Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State 31/29\n case.\n\n A copy of the judgment and sentence has been supplied\nto the convict, free of cost.\n\n File be consigned to the Record Room.\n\nAnnounced in the open Court.
