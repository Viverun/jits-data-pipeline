Ramaswamy\n\nCASE NO.:\nAppeal (civil) 2769 of 1996\n\nPETITIONER:\nV.P. SHRIVASTAVA AND ORS.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nSTATE OF M.P. AND ORS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 02/02/1996\n\nBENCH:\nK. RAMASWAMY & G.B. PATTANAIK\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nJUDGMENT\n\n1996 (2) SCR 59\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATTANAIK, J.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nThis appeal is directed against the Judgment of the Madhya Pradesh\nAdministrative Tribunal dated 24th July, 1992 in Original Application No.\n894 of 1988. The appellants are the direct recruits as Assistant Director\nof Industries, they having been appointed on 29.09.1980 through the process\nof selection conducted by the Public Service Commission. The respondents\nare the ad hoc promotees to the post of Assistant Director, they having\nbeen promoted on 27.09.1980. The inter se seniority between these two\ngroups of appointees is the subject matter of controversy in this appeal.\n\nThe State of Madhya Pradesh had framed a set of Rules called Madhya Pradesh\nState Industries (gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1965 (hereinafter\nreferred to as 'the recruitment Rules of 1965'). Under the said rules, 50\nper cent posts of Assistant Director of Industries were to be filed by\ndirect recruitment and balance 50 per cent by promotion. The aforesaid Rule\nwas replaced by a new set of Rules called Madhya Pradesh State Industries\n(gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as 'the\nrecruitment Rules of 1985'). Both these Rules though provide for the mode\nof recruitment to the post of Assistant Director of Industries as well as\nthe procedure therefore, but do not contain any provision for determination\nof inter se seniority between a direct recruit and a promotee. Therefore\nthe said seniority had to be determined in accordance with the general\nprinciple.\n\nThough the principle has been authoritatively laid down by Constitution\nBench of this Court in the case of Direct Recruit Class II Engineering\nOfficers Association and On. v. Stale of Maharashtra and Ors. reported in\n[1990] 2 SCR 900, commonly called the Direct Recruits Case, but yet very\noften the High Courts and the Administrative Tribunals have been committing\nthe mistake in applying ratio of this case. In the case in hand the\nAdministrative Tribunal has failed to apply the ratio laid down in Direct\nRecruits Case and as such has committed an error.\n\nUnder the Recruitment Rules, 1965 no appointment to the service could be\nmade except after selection by one of the methods of recruitment specified\nin Rule 6. So far as the direct recruitment is concerned the selection has\nto be made by the Public Service Commission after interviewing the\ncandidates as provided under Rule 11 and then Commission forwards a list to\nthe Government arranging the persons in order of merit as provided in Rule\n12 and finally the Government makes the appointments from the said list. So\nfar as the appointment to the service by promotion is concerned, under Rule\n13 a preliminary selection committee is constituted which committee\nconsiders the cases of all eligible persons as provided under Rule 14 and\nfinally a list of suitable persons is prepared by the said committee under\nRule 15, The selection is made on the basis of merit and suitability in all\nrespects with due regard to seniority and thereafter the names of the\nofficers included in the list are arranged in order of seniority. The list\nthus prepared is forwarded to the Public Service Commission as provided\nunder Rule 16 and only after approval of the Commission under Rule 17, it\nforms the selection list for promotion. The State Government then makes\nappointments from the select list as provided in Rule 18. Admittedly the\nappellants who are direct recruits had been appointed in accordance with\nthe prescribed procedure under the Recruitment Rules. whereas the promotee\nrespondents had not been ap-pointed in accordance with the procedure\nprescribed for promotion under the Recruitment Rules. A bare look at the\nletter of appointments of the respondents dated 27.9.1980 clearly indicate\nthat the appointments had been made in anticipation of the approval of the\nPublic Service Commission and the appointments were until further orders.\nThus the appointment of the respondents on 27.9.1980 was de-hors the rules\nand though the said respondents being continued since September 1980, Mr.\nRao, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the\nPublic Service Commission has not yet granted approval to the appointments\nof the respondents which fact is not disputed by the learned counsel\nappearing for the private respondents as well as by the counsel appearing\nfor the State. In the year 1983 a provisional seniority list of the\nAdditional Directors was drawn up by the State Government wherein ad hoc\npromotees were shown senior to the regularly appointees like the\nappellants. The appellants filed objections to the said provisional list.\nWithout taking any decision on the same the State Government issued another\nprovisional selection list in the year 1986 but continued the mistake which\nwas there in the 1983 list. The appellants put forward their grievances\nagain on 18.9.1987. The seniority list prepared in 1983 and 1986 were\nwithdrawn. Then on 19.9.1988 another provisional list was brought out\nwherein the appellants were against shown junior to the ad-hoc promotees\nsome of whom are the private respondents. The appellants against filed the\nrepresentation and finally on 23.12.1988 the State Government brought out\nthe final selection list wherein the appellants were again shown junior to\nthe said ad-hoc promotees. The appellants therefore approached the Slate\nAdministrative Tribunal. The Tribunal by the impugned order dismissed the\napplication essentially on two grounds namely, in an earlier case while\ndeciding the inter se seniority of 1974 recruits the Tribunal has decided\nto take ad-hoc appointment of the promotees into consideration and\ntherefore that decision should govern the present case. The Tribunal also\ncame to the conclusion that since the promotion in favour of the\nrespondents in the year 1980 cannot be challenged at this length of time,\nthe said promotees would be entitled to count their entire service for the\npurpose of determining of seniority. The Tribunal also is of the view that\neven though respondents 3 and 4 who are promotees successfully safeguarded\nthe interest of all promotees yet since all the promotees have not been\narrayed as party respondents no relief can be granted to the appellants.\n\nMr. P.P. Rao, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants\nraises two contentions in assailing the legality of the order of the\nTribunal:\n\n(1) In view of the admitted position that the appellants - direct recruits\nwere appointed in accordance with the Recruitment Rules, 1965 I and the\nrespondents promotees were appointed on promotion on ad hoc basis not in\naccordance with the procedure prescribed for promotion under 1965\nRecruitment Rules, the Tribunal erred in law in declaring the promotees to\nbe senior to the direct recruits solely on the ground that the promotees\nwere appointed on 27.9.1980 whereas the direct recruits were appointed on\n29.9.1980.\n\n(2) Since the very principle of determination of inter se seniority adopted\nby the State Government was challenged, the only necessary party is the\nState itself and not the affected party and therefore non inclusion of\naffected party will not be fatal to the case. At any rate when some of the\npromotee appointees have been impleaded as parties and the Tribunal itself\ncame to the conclusion that they successfully safeguarded the interest of\nthe promotees the appellants could not have been refused relief on that\nscore. On the question of delay and laches, Mr. Rao contends that the\nappellants do not challenged the so called ad-hoc appointments of\nrespondents by way of promotion but they merely challenge the position\nassigned to them in the selection list and the selection list having been\nfinalised only in the year 1988, on 23.12.1988, the appellants' application\nbefore the Tribunal in 1989 by no stretch of imagination can be held to be\nbarred on the principle of delay and laches.\n\nLearned counsel appearing for the respondents while could not refute the\ncontention of Mr. Rao with regard to erroneous application of the\nprinciples of determination of inter se seniority by the Tribunal, but\nmerely contended that the respondents have served this length of time and\nmany of them have been retired in the meantime, and therefore, alternation\nof the seniority need not be made by this Court.\n\nWe are unable to accept the request made by the learned counsel appearing\nfor the respondents and in our considered opinion all the contentions\nraised by Mr. Rao, learned counsel appearing for the appellants must\nsucceed.\n\nIn the Direct Recruits case the Constitution Bench of this Court summarised\nthe legal position in paragraph 44 as follows :\n\n\"(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his\nseniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment and not\naccording to the date of his confirmation.\n\nThe Corollary of the above rule is that were the initial appointment is\nonly ad-hoc and not according to rules and made as a stop-gap arrangement,\nthe officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for considering\nthe seniority.\n\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure laid\ndown by the rules but the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly\ntill the regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules, the\nperiod of officiating service will be counted.\"\n\nWe are not concerned with the other propositions laid down by this Court in\nthe present case. In the case in hand the initial appointment of the\nrespondents on promotion not having been made following the procedure laid\ndown by the Recruitment rules of 1965 and even though they are continuing\nin the post uninterruptedly but the Public Service Commission having not\napproved their appointments as yet, proposition B above will have no\napplication. Consequently applying proposition A above, the appellants\ndirect recruits must be held senior to the respondents - private\nrespondents - ad-hoc promotees. The Tribunal obviously erred in law in not\nfollowing the aforesaid authoritative pronouncement of this Court for\ndetermination of the inter se seniority between direct recruits and the\npromotees.\n\nIn the three Judge Bench decision this Court in the case of\nState of W.B.\nand Others v. Aghore Nath Day and others\n, [1993] 3 S.C.C. 371, this Court\nheld :\n\nthat to enable his seniority to be counted from the date of initial\nappointment the incumbent of the post has to be initially appointed\n'according to rules'. Thus 'where initial appointment is only ad-hoc and\nnot according to rules and made as a stop gap arrangement, the officiation\nin such posts cannot be taken into account for considering the seniority'.\n\nIt was thus held that conclusions A and B of the Constitution Bench in\nDirect Recruits case have to be read harmoneously and conclusion B cannot\ncover cases which are expressly excluded by conclusion A.\n\nIn a more recent case of\nV, Sreenivasa Reddy and Others v. Govt. of A.P,\nand others\n, [1995] Suppl. (1) S.C.C. P. 572, where one of us (brother\nRamaswamy, J.) was a member, all the decisions of this Court on the point\nhave been considered and it has been laid down the temporary or ad-hoc\nappointments are not appointments in accordance with the rules and the\ntemporary service cannot be counted towards the seniority.\n\nThe conclusion of the Tribunal that non inclusion of the affected parties\nis fatal to the appellants case is also unsustainable in law. It is to be\nstated that the appellants do not challenge the so called ad-hoc\nappointments of the promotee respondents but they do challenge the position\nof the said ad-hoc promotee respondents over the appellants in the\nseniority list. In other words the very principle of 'determination of\nseniority' made by the State Government is under challenge and for such a\ncase State is the necessary party who has been impleaded. It has been held\nby this Court in the case of General Manger, South Central Railway\nSecundrabad and Anr. Etc. v. A.V.R. Siddhanti and Ors. Etc., [1974] 3\nS.C.R. 207 :\n\n\"As regards the second objection, it is to be noted that the decision of\nthe Railway Board impugned in the writ petition contain administrative\nrules of general application, regulating absorption in permanent\ndepartments, fixation of seniority, pay etc. of the employees of the\nerstwhile Grain Shop departments. The Respondents-petitioners are\nimpeaching the validity of those policy decisions on the ground of their\nbeing violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The proceedings\nare analogous to those in which the constitutionality of a statutory rule\nregulating seniority of government servants is assailed. In such\nproceedings the necessary parties to be impleaded are those against whom\nthe relief is sought, and in whose absence no effective decision can be\nrendered by the Court. In the present case, the relief is claimed only\nagainst the Railway which has been impleaded through its representative. No\nlist or order fixing seniority of the petitioners vis-a-vis particular\nindividuals pursuant to the impugned decisions, is being challenged. The\nemployees who were likely to be affected as a result of the re-adjustment\nof the petitioner's seniority in accordance with the principles\nlaid down\nin\nthe Board's decision of October 16, 1952 were, at the most, proper\nparties and not necessary parties, and their non-joinder could not be fatal\nto the writ petition.\"\n\nIn the case of\nA. Janardhana v. Union of India and others\n, [1983] 2 S.C.R.\n936, a similar contention was also repelled by this Court in the following\nwords :\n\n\"In this case, appellant does not claim seniority over particular\nindividual in the background of any particular fact controverted by that\nperson against whom the claim is made. The contention is that criteria\nadopted by the Union Government in drawing-up the impugned seniority list\nare invalid and illegal and the relief is claimed against the Union\nGovernment restraining it from upset-ting or quashing the already drawn up\nvalid list and for quashing the impugned seniority list. Thus the relief is\nclaimed against the Union Government and not against any particular\nindividual. In this background, we consider it unnecessary to have all\ndirect recruits to be impleaded as respondents.\"\n\nFurther in view of finding of the Tribunal that respondents 3 and 4\nsuccessfully safeguarded the interest of the promotees. The Tribunal erred\nin law in holding that non-inclusion of the affected parties is fatal to\nthe proceeding. It has been held by this Court in the case of Prabodh Verma\nand Others, Etc. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, Etc., [1985] 1 SCR\n216, that:\n\n\"A High Court ought not to hear and dispose of a writ petition under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution without the persons who would be vitally\naffected by its judgment being before it as respondents or at least some of\nthem being before it as respondents in a representative capacity if their\nnumber is too large to join them as respondents individually.\"\n\nEven in\nJanardhana\ncase referred to supra this Court also rejected a\nsimilar objection on the ground that 9 of the direct recruits having been\nimpleaded as party, therefore the case of direct recruits has not gone\nunrepresented and therefore the non-inclusion of all the 400 and odd direct\nrecruits is not fatal to the proceedings.\n\nIn the aforesaid circumstances we have no hesitation to come to the\nconclusion that the Tribunal was wholly in error in coming to the\nconclusion that the appellants application becomes unsustainable in the\nabsence of all the promotees being impleaded as party.\n\nSo far as question of delay and laches is concerned, as we have noticed\nearlier the final gradation list was prepared only on 23.12.1988 and the\nappellants had approached the Tribunal in 1989 and therefore, the question\nof delay does not arise. In the aforesaid premises the impugned order of\nthe Tribunal is set aside and this appeal is allowed. The appellants are\nentitled to get their seniority over the ad-hoc promotees who were\nappointed as Assistant Director on 27.9.1980. The respondent-State is\ndirected to re-draw the seniority. The appellants' application before the\nTribunal stand allowed. There will be no order as to costs. The seniority\nlist may be re-drawn up within 4 months from the date of the receipt of\nthis order and consequential benefits may be given.",

PATTANAIK  JUDGMENT:  JUDGMENT  1996 (2) SCR 59  THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT WAS DELIVERED BY PATTANAIK, J.  LEAVE GRANTED.  THIS APPEAL IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE JUDGMENT OF THE MADHYA PRADESH ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL DATED 24TH JULY, 1992 IN ORIGINAL APPLICATION NO. 894 OF 1988. THE APPELLANTS ARE THE DIRECT RECRUITS AS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF INDUSTRIES, THEY HAVING BEEN APPOINTED ON 29.09.1980 THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SELECTION CONDUCTED BY THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION. THE RESPONDENTS ARE THE AD HOC PROMOTEES TO THE POST OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, THEY HAVING BEEN PROMOTED ON 27.09.1980. THE INTER SE SENIORITY BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS OF APPOINTEES IS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF CONTROVERSY IN THIS APPEAL.  THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH HAD FRAMED A SET OF RULES CALLED MADHYA PRADESH STATE INDUSTRIES (GAZETTED) SERVICE RECRUITMENT RULES, 1965 (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS 'THE RECRUITMENT RULES OF 1965'). UNDER THE SAID RULES, 50 PER CENT POSTS OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF INDUSTRIES WERE TO BE FILED BY DIRECT RECRUITMENT AND BALANCE 50 PER CENT BY PROMOTION. THE AFORESAID RULE WAS REPLACED BY A NEW SET OF RULES CALLED MADHYA PRADESH STATE INDUSTRIES (GAZETTED) SERVICE RECRUITMENT RULES, 1985 (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS 'THE RECRUITMENT RULES OF 1985'). BOTH THESE RULES THOUGH PROVIDE FOR THE MODE OF RECRUITMENT TO THE POST OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS THE PROCEDURE THEREFORE, BUT DO NOT CONTAIN ANY PROVISION FOR DETERMINATION OF INTER SE SENIORITY BETWEEN A DIRECT RECRUIT AND A PROMOTEE. THEREFORE THE SAID SENIORITY HAD TO BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE.  THOUGH THE PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN AUTHORITATIVELY LAID DOWN BY CONSTITUTION BENCH OF THIS COURT IN THE CASE OF DIRECT RECRUIT CLASS II ENGINEERING OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND ON. V. STALE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ORS. REPORTED IN [1990] 2 SCR 900, COMMONLY CALLED THE DIRECT RECRUITS CASE, BUT YET VERY OFTEN THE HIGH COURTS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS HAVE BEEN COMMITTING THE MISTAKE IN APPLYING RATIO OF THIS CASE. IN THE CASE IN HAND THE ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL HAS FAILED TO APPLY THE RATIO LAID DOWN IN DIRECT RECRUITS CASE AND AS SUCH HAS COMMITTED AN ERROR.  UNDER THE RECRUITMENT RULES, 1965 NO APPOINTMENT TO THE SERVICE COULD BE MADE EXCEPT AFTER SELECTION BY ONE OF THE METHODS OF RECRUITMENT SPECIFIED IN RULE 6. SO FAR AS THE DIRECT RECRUITMENT IS CONCERNED THE SELECTION HAS TO BE MADE BY THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AFTER INTERVIEWING THE CANDIDATES AS PROVIDED UNDER RULE 11 AND THEN COMMISSION FORWARDS A LIST TO THE GOVERNMENT ARRANGING THE PERSONS IN ORDER OF MERIT AS PROVIDED IN RULE 12 AND FINALLY THE GOVERNMENT MAKES THE APPOINTMENTS FROM THE SAID LIST. SO FAR AS THE APPOINTMENT TO THE SERVICE BY PROMOTION IS CONCERNED, UNDER RULE 13 A PRELIMINARY SELECTION COMMITTEE IS CONSTITUTED WHICH COMMITTEE CONSIDERS THE CASES OF ALL ELIGIBLE PERSONS AS PROVIDED UNDER RULE 14 AND FINALLY A LIST OF SUITABLE PERSONS IS PREPARED BY THE SAID COMMITTEE UNDER RULE 15, THE SELECTION IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF MERIT AND SUITABILITY IN ALL RESPECTS WITH DUE REGARD TO SENIORITY AND THEREAFTER THE NAMES OF THE OFFICERS INCLUDED IN THE LIST ARE ARRANGED IN ORDER OF SENIORITY. THE LIST THUS PREPARED IS FORWARDED TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AS PROVIDED UNDER RULE 16 AND ONLY AFTER APPROVAL OF THE COMMISSION UNDER RULE 17, IT FORMS THE SELECTION LIST FOR PROMOTION. THE STATE GOVERNMENT THEN MAKES APPOINTMENTS FROM THE SELECT LIST AS PROVIDED IN RULE 18. ADMITTEDLY THE APPELLANTS WHO ARE DIRECT RECRUITS HAD BEEN APPOINTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESCRIBED PROCEDURE UNDER THE RECRUITMENT RULES. WHEREAS THE PROMOTEE RESPONDENTS HAD NOT BEEN AP-POINTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED FOR PROMOTION UNDER THE RECRUITMENT RULES. A BARE LOOK AT THE LETTER OF APPOINTMENTS OF THE RESPONDENTS DATED 27.9.1980 CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE APPOINTMENTS HAD BEEN MADE IN ANTICIPATION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND THE APPOINTMENTS WERE UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS. THUS THE APPOINTMENT OF THE RESPONDENTS ON 27.9.1980 WAS DE-HORS THE RULES AND THOUGH THE SAID RESPONDENTS BEING CONTINUED SINCE SEPTEMBER 1980, MR. RAO, LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL APPEARING FOR THE APPELLANTS SUBMITTED THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION HAS NOT YET GRANTED APPROVAL TO THE APPOINTMENTS OF THE RESPONDENTS WHICH FACT IS NOT DISPUTED BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL APPEARING FOR THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS AS WELL AS BY THE COUNSEL APPEARING FOR THE STATE. IN THE YEAR 1983 A PROVISIONAL SENIORITY LIST OF THE ADDITIONAL DIRECTORS WAS DRAWN UP BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHEREIN AD HOC PROMOTEES WERE SHOWN SENIOR TO THE REGULARLY APPOINTEES LIKE THE"
