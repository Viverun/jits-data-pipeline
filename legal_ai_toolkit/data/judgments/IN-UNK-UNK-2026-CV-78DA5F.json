Promotion from Grade 'D'\nto 'C' was on the basis of seniority-cum-suitability. In\nOctober 1965 the Railway Board issued a notification by\nwhich it was provided that eighty per cent of the vacancies\nin Grade 'C' were to be filled up from apprentice train\nexaminers-recruited on and after April 1, 1966 and the\nremaining twenty per cent by train examiners from Grade 'D'.\nThe notification further provided that apprentice train\nexaminers who had already been absorbed in Grade D before\nApril 1966 should en bloc be accommodated in Grade 'C' in\nthe eighty per cent of the vacancies without undergoing any\nselection and with regard to twenty per cent of the\nvacancies, reserved for the other class promotion was to be\non selection basis and not on the basis of seniority-cum-\nsuitability.\nThe petitioner who entered Railway service in 1954 as a\nskilled artisan and was selected and confirmed in Grade 'D'\nfiled a Writ Petition in this Court challenging that part of\nthe notification which gave favourable treatment to\napprentice train examiners who had already been absorbed in\nGrade 14 'D' as arbitrary and discriminatory and violative\nof Articles t4 and 16 of the Constitution. It was also\ncontended that the earlier order laying down that promotion\nto grade 'C' was to be based on seniority-cum-suitability\nhad become a contractual condition of service and could not\nbe altered to the prejudice of the petitioner.\nHELD: (i) The impugned part of the notification violated\nthe guarantee under \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\nOnce the direct recruits and promotees were absorbed in one\ncadre, they formed one class and they could not be\ndiscriminated against for the purpose of further promotion\nto the higher grade 'C'. Before the impugned notification\nwas issued there was only one rule of promotion applicable\nto both direct recruits and promotees. By the impugned\nnotification a discriminatory treatment was made in favour\nof the existing apprentice Train Examiners who had already\nbeen absorbed in grade 'D' because, the notification\nprovided that this group of apprentice train examiners\nshould first be accommodated en bloc in grade 'C' up to\neighty per cent of the vacancies reserved for them without\nundergoing any selection; whereas in the twenty per cent of\nthe vacancies available to the category of Train Examiners\nto which the petitioner belonged the basis of recruitment\nwas selection on merit and the previous test of seniority-\ncum-suitability was abandoned. [192 D-G].\n186\nMervyn v. Collector, [1966] 3 S.C.R. 600: relied on.\n(ii) The petitioner had no vested contractual right in\nregard to the terms of his service. The legal position of a\nGovernment servant is more one of status than of contract.\nOnce appointed to his post or office a Government servant\nacquires a status and his rights and obligations are no\nlonger determined by consent of parties, but by statute or\nstatutory rules which may be framed and altered unilaterally\nby the Government.

No. 203 of\n1966).\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nWrit petition No. 154 of 1966.\n\nRamaswami, J.-In this case the petitioner, Roshan La1 Tandon\nhas obtained a rule from this Court calling upon the\nrespondents to show cause why a writ in the nature of\nmandamus under \nArt. 32\n of the Constitution of India should\nnot be issued commanding the respondents not to carry out\nthe directives contained in the notification of the Railway\nBoard No. E(NG)65 PMI-26 dated the 27 the October, 1965,\nAnnexure 'D' to the Writ Petition, in so far as it grants\nprotection to the existing Apprentice Train Examiners and\nlays down the procedure to fill upgraded vacancies. Cause\nhas been shown by, the respondents to whom notice of the\nrule was ordered to be given.\n\nThere were originally two scales for Train Examiners Rs.\n100-185 ('D' Grade) and Rs. 150-225 ('C' Grade). These\nscales were later revised as a result of the recommendations\nof the Second Pay Commission and the scale of 'D' Grade was\nincreased to Rs. 180-240 and that of 'C' Grade to Rs. 205-\n\n280. On February 18, 1961 the Railway Board issued a letter\nNo. PC-60/PS5/ TP-8, Annexure 'A' to the Writ Petition to\nthe General Managers\n\n 187\n\nof all Indian Railways conveying its decision that vacancies\nin the Entry Grade of Train Examiners (in the scale Rs. 180-\n\n240) with effect from February 18, 1961 should be filled as\nfollows:\n\n (i) 50% of the vacancies should be filled\n from Apprentice Train Examiners who\n successfully have completed the prescribed (4\n years) apprenticeship, the remaining 50% of\n the vacancies being filled by promotion of\n skilled artisans.\n\n (ii) 20 /1/O of the annual requirements of\n Apprentice Train Examiners should be drawn\n from skilled artisans who are not more than 35\n years old on 1st July of the year in which the\n apprenticeship is likely to commence.\"\n\nPromotion to Grade 'C' of Train Examiners used to take place\non the basis of seniority-cum-suitability without any\ndistinction whether the employee entered Grade 'D' of the\nTrain Examiners directly or was selected out of the category\nof skilled artisans. This rule was laid down by the Railway\nBoard in its letter No. E(S) 1-57-TRS/41, dated January 25,\n1958 which states:\n\n \"Ref : Para 2 of Board's letter No. E(R) 49-\n JAC / 13 dated 23-2-50 laying down that 20% of\n the posts in the TXR grade Rs. 150-225 should\n be reserved and the TXR in the grade of Rs.\n 80-160 (since revised Rs. 100-185) promoted\n from skilled and semi-skilled ranks. The\n Board have reviewed the position and have\n decided that promotion to the TXR grade of Rs.\n 150-225 should hereafter be made solely on the\n basis of seniority-cum-suitability and the\n reservation of only 20% as mentioned above\n will no longer be operative.\"\n\n (Annexure 'B' to the Writ Petition).\n\nOn the basis of this rule the Divisional Personnel Officer,\nNew Delhi, prepared a seniority list for the Train Examiners\nof Grade 'D' of Delhi Division as on December 31, 1964\n(Annexure 'C' to the Writ Petition).'On October 27, 1965 the\nRailway Board issued the impugned notification (Annexure 'D'\nto the Writ Petition). The notification states in the first\nplace that on and from April 1, 1966 vacancies in the Entry\nGrade of Train Examiners scale Rs. 120-240 should not be\nfilled from Apprentice Train Examiners upto 50% as hitherto,\nbut should exclusively be filled by promotion from amongst\nartisan staff With regard to the next higher grade i.e.,\nGrade 'C', it was provided that 80% vacancies should be\nfilled by Apprentice Train Examiners who had successfully\ncompleted the prescribed training of 5 years (three years in\ncase of Diploma Holders and three years in case of Artisan\nrecruited as Apprentice Train Examiner). Twenty per cent of\nthe vacancies were to be filled by the Train Examiners from\nGrade 'D'. It was\n\n188\n\nfurther provided that the Train Examiners Grade 'D' who\nbegan as Apprentice Train Examiners and who were to be\nabsorbed in the 'C' Grade against 80% vacancies reserved for\nthem should not be required to undergo selection before\nbeing absorbed in that grade. As regards 20% vacancies\nreserved for the other class of Train Examiners the\npromotion was to be on selection basis. The materials\nportion of the notification of the Railway Board dated\nOctober 27, 1965 is reproduced below:\n\n \"RECRUITMENT:\n\n (i) Vacancies in the entry grade of Train\n Examiners in the authorised scale Rs. 180-240\n should not be filled from apprentice TX Rs.\n\n upto 50% as hitherto, but should exclusively\n be filled by promotion from amongst artisan\n staff.\n\n (ii) (a) Vacancies in the next higher grade\n Rs. 205-280 (AS) should be filled from amongst\n X X\nthe TXRs in grade Rs. 180-240 (AS) to the\n extent of 2O%.\n\n (b) The remaining 80% vacancies should be\n filled by Apprentice TX Rs. who have\n successfuly completed prescribed\n apprenticepship mentioned in para 2 below.\n\n (c) 25% of the annual requirements of\n apprentice TXRS. should be drawn from skilled\n artisans who are not more than 35 years old on\n 1st July of the year in which apprenticeship\n is likely to commence.\n\n The instructions contained in Board's letter\n No. 2(NG)-61MI/101 dated 6-6-62 should be kept\n in view.\n\n Training\n\n 2.

As regards the apprentice TXRS. who\n are undergoing training at present, and will\n not be brought on to the work working\n posts before 1-4-66, it has been decided that\n from the date of this letter, they should be\n allowed stipend in scale Rs. 180-6-210 during\n the remaining period of their training. Their\n period of training should also be increased to\n 5 years, on completion of which they should be\n put on to the working posts in scale Rs. 205-\n 280 (AS). The Apprentice TXRS. who have\n already been or will be absorbed in scale Rs.\n 180-240 upto 31-3-66 should first be\n accommodated in scale Rs. 205-280 against the\n quota of 80% vacancies reserved for them.\n Such staff should not be required to undergo a\n 'Selection' before being absorbed in that\n grade. The upgraded vacancies in scale Rs.\n 205-280 left over after earmarking those for\n the apprentices under training on 2-4-66\n should be filled by promotion of TXRS. in\n scale Rs. 180-240 on a selection basis. While\n computing the number of posts available for\n promotion of TXRS. in scale Rs. 180-240 the\n vacancies likely to occur during the period\n\n 190\n\n of apprenticeship of the apprentices under\n training as on 1-4-66 should also be taken\n into account. In other words, it would be\n necessary to keep in reserve only the number\n of posts equal to the number of apprentices\n under training as on 1-4-66, who cannot be\n absorbed in the anticipated vacancies which\n will arise by the time they qualify.\"\n\nThe petitioner, Roshan Lal Tandon entered railway service on\nMarch 6, 1954 as skilled fitter on the Northern Railway. He\nwas selected for the training for the post of Train Examiner\nGrade 'D' on June 5, 1958 and was confirmed in that grade on\nOctober 25, 1959. The case of the petitioner is that he\nalongwith the direct recruits formed one class in Entry\ngrade 'D' and their condition of service was that seniority\nwas to be reckoned from the date of appointment as Train\nExaminer in Grade 'D' and promotion to Grade 'C' was on the\nbasis of seniority-cum-suitability test irrespective of the\nsource of recruitment. It was alleged that there was no\ndifference between the apprentices and those selected out of\nthe skilled artisans when they entered Grade 'D' and that\nportion of the impugned notification which gave a favourable\ntreatment to the direct recruits in Grade 'D' with regard to\npromotion to Grade 'C' was arbitrary and discriminatory and\nviolated the guarantee under Arts. 14 and 16 of the\nConstitution. It was contended that the petitioner having\nbeen brought to grade 'D' by undergoing the necessary\nselection and training and having been integrated with the\nothers who had been brought in through direct recruitment in\ngrade 'D' could not be differentiated for the purpose of\npromotion to the senior Grade 'C'. The petitioner has\ntherefore moved this Court for the grant of a writ under\n\nArt. 32\n of the Constitution to quash the notification of the\nRailway Board dated October 27, 1965.\n\nIn the counter-affidavit respondent No. 1 has denied that\nthere was any violation of the guarantee under Arts. 14 and\n16 of the Constitution. It was conceded that prior to April\n1, 1966 promotion to the post of Grade 'C' Train Examiner\nwas on the basis of seniority-cum-suitability but the\nimpugned notification was issued by the first respondent\nbecause it Was decided that the posts of senior Train\nExaminers in Grade 'C' should be filled by men possessin\nadequate technical knowledge and so the period of training\nof senior Train Examiners was increased and it was decided\nthat in future 80 per cent of the vacancies in 'C' grade\nshould be filled directly by Apprentice Train Examiners and\nthe remaining 20 per cent was to be made available for\nrecruitment from the category of Train Examiners to which\nthe petitioner belonged. This recruitment of 20 per cent\nvacancies was to be made on the basis of merit. It was said\nthat the reorganisation of the Service was made with a view\nto obtain a better and more technically trained class of\nTrain Examiners. The reason was that\n\n 191\n\nthere were more complicated designs. of Carriages and\nWagons, acquisition of modern type of Rolling Stock and\ngreater speed of trains under dieselisation and\nelectrification programmes. It was. considered that there\nshould be a better calibre of technically trained and\ntechnically qualified personnel for proper maintenance and\nsafety of the Rolling Stock. In view of the decision to\nrecruit Apprentice Train Examiners directly in 'C' Grade\nwith effect from April 1, 1966 those who were Apprentice\nTrain Examiners in Grade 'D' before that date had to be\nupgraded in the scale of Rs. 205-280. It was therefore\nthought that these posts should be upgraded \"so that there\nshould be parity of treatment with the Apprentice Train\nExaminers who were to join after April 1, 1966\". The first\nrespondent has also controverted the allegation of the\npetitioner that the procedure outlined in the impugned\nnotification dated October 27, 1965 in regard to the\nupgraded vacancies was discriminatory.\nThe main question to be considered in this case is whether\nthe notification by the first respondent dated October 27,\n1965 is violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution in\nso far as it makes a discrimination against the petitioner\nfor promotion to Grade 'C'. According to the impugned\nnotification the existing Apprentice Train Examiners who had\nalready been absorbed in grade 'D' by March 31. 1966 should\nfirst be accommodated in grade 'C' in 80% of the vacancies\nreserved for them without undergoing any selection. With\nregard to 20% of the vacancies there is a reservation in\nfavour of the departmental Train Examiners, but the\npromotion is by selection and not by the test of seniority-\ncum-suitability which prevailed before the date of the\nimpugned notification. It was not disputed by Mr. Mehta on\nbehalf of the petitioner that the Railway Board was\ncompetent to say that with effect from April 1, 1966\nvacancies in the Entry grade posts of Train Examiners should\nnot be filled from Apprentice Train Examiners upto 50% but\nshould be exclusively filled by promotion from amongst\nartisan staff. As regards the recruitment to grade 'C', the\nimpugned notification states that with effect from April 1,\n1966 all the Apprentice. Train Examiners on successful\ncompletion of their training should be straightaway brought\non to the scale Rs. 205-280 instead of being first absorbed\nin scale Rs. 180-6-240 as at present. The period of\ntraining was also increased to 5 years on completion of\nwhich they should be put on to the working posts in scale\nRs. 205-280. So far as this portion of the notification is\nconcerned, Counsel for the petitioner did not raise any\nconstitutional objection. But the contention of the\npetitioner is that the following portion of the notification\nwas. constitutionally invalid:\n\n \"The Apprentice TXRS. who have already been or\n will be absorbed in scale Rs. 180-240 upto 31-\n 3-66 should first be accommodated in scale Rs.\n 205-280\n\n 192\n\n against the quota 80% vacancies reserved for\n them. Such staff should not be required to\n undergo a 'Selection' before being absorbed in\n that grade. The upgraded vacancies in scale\n Rs. 205-280 left over after earmarking those\n for the apprentices under training on 2-4-66\n should be filled by promotion of TXRs in scale\n Rs. 180-240 on a selection basis.\"\n\nIn our opinion, the constitutional objection taken by the\npetitioner to this part of the notification is well-founded\nand must be accepted as correct. At the time when the\npetitioner and the direct recruits were appointed to Grade\n'D', there was one class in Grade 'D' formed of direct\nrecruits and the promotees from the grade of artisans. The\nrecruits from both the sources to Grade 'D' were integrated\ninto one class and no discrimination could thereafter be\nmade in favour of recruits from one source as against the\nrecruits from the other source in the matter of promotion to\nGrade 'C'. To put it differently, once the direct recruits\nand promotees are absorbed in one cadre, they form one class\nand they cannot be discriminated for the purpose of further\npromotion to the higher grade 'C'. In the present case, it\nis not disputed on behalf of the first respondent that\nbefore the impugned notification was issued there was only\none rule of promotion for both the departmental promotees\nand the direct recruits and that rule was seniority-cum-\nsuitability, and there was no rule of promotion separately\nmade for application to the direct recruits. As a\nconsequence of the impugned notification a discriminatory\ntreatment is made in favour of the existing Apprentice Train\nExaminers who have already been absorbed in Grade 'D' by\nMarch 31, 1966, because the notification provides that this\ngroup of Apprentice Train Examiners should first be\naccommodated en bloc in grade 'C' upto 80 per cent of\nvacancies reserved for them without undergoing any selec-\ntion. As regards the 20 per cent of the vacancies made\navailable for the category of Train Examiners to which the\npetitioner belongs the basis of recruitment was selection on\nmerit and the previous test of seniority-cum-suitability was\nabandoned. \nIn our opinion, the present case falls within\nthe principle of the recent decision of this Court in \nMervyn\nv. Collector\n(1). In that case, the petitioners who were\nAppraisers in the Customs Department filed a writ petition\nunder \nArt. 32\n, challenging the validity of the \"rotational\"\nsystem as applied in fixing the seniority of Appraisers and\nPrincipal Appraisers. The system, as \nlaid down in\n the\nrelevant departmental circulars was that vacancies occurring\nin the cadre of Appraisers were to go alternatively to\n'promotees' and 'direct recruits'. According to the\npetitioners of that case this resulted in inequality,\nespecially in view of the fact that the number of direct\nrecruits over the years was very low. Promotion to the\n(1) [1966] 3 S.C.R. 600.\n\n193\n\ngrade of Principal Appraisers was from the cadre of\nAppraisers; only those who had served as Appraisers for five\nyears were entitled to be promoted to the higher grade.\nSince the direct recruits had to wait for five years before\nthey could become Principal Appraiser the promotees below\nthem who had put in five years as Appraisers became\nPrincipal Appraisers. In order to restore the seniority of\nthe direct recruits thus lost, the rotational system was\napplied to the cadre of Principal Appraisers also i.e., one\nvacancy was to go to a promotee and the other to a direct\nrecruit. The plea of inequality in violation of \nArt. 16(1)\n\nof the Constitution was raised by the petitioners in respect\nof this also. It was held by this Court, in the first\nplace, that there was no inherent vice in the principle of\nfixing seniority by rotation in a case when a service is\ncomposed in fixed proportion of direct recruits and\npromotees. It was held in the second place that the same\ncould not be said when the rotational system was applied to\nthe recruitment of Principal Appraisers. The source of\nrecruitment for these was one only, namely, the grade of\nAppraisers. There was no question of any quota being\nreserved from two sources in their case. In so far\ntherefore as the Government was doing what it called res-\ntoration of seniority of direct recruits in Appraisers grade\non their promotion to the higher grade it was clearly\ndenying equality of opportunity under \nArt. 16\n of the\nConstitution. At page 606 of the Report Wanchoo, J., as he\nthen was, speaking for the Court observed as follows:\n\n \"This brings us to the question of Principles\n Appraisers. We are of opinion that the\n petitioners have a legitimate grievance in\n this respect. The source of recruitment of\n Principal Appraisers is one, namely, from the\n grade of Appraisers. There is therefore no\n question of any quota being reserved from two\n sources in their cases. The rotational system\n cannot therefore apply when there is only one\n source of recruitment and not two sources of\n recruitment. In a case therefore where there\n is only one source of recruitment, the normal\n rule will apply, namely, that a person\n promoted to a higher grade gets his seniority\n in that grade according to the date of\n promotion subject always to his being found\n fit and being confirmed in the higher grade\n after the period of probation is over. In\n such a case it is continuous appointment in\n the higher grade which determines seniority\n for the source of recruitment is one. There\n is no question in such a case of reflecting in\n the higher grade the seniority of the grade\n from which promotion is made to the higher\n grade. In so far therefore as the respondent\n is doing what it calls restoration of\n seniority of direct recruits in Appraisers'\n grade when they are promoted to the Principal\n Appraisers' grade, it is clearly denying\n equality of opportunity LP(N)ISCI-14\n\n 194\n\n to Apprasiers which is the only source of\n recruitment to the Principal Appraisers'\n grade. There is only one source from which\n the Principal Appraisers are drawn, namely,\n Appraisers, the promotion being by selection\n and five, years' experience as Appraiser is\n the minimum qualification. Subject to the\n above all Appraisers selected for the post of\n Principal Appraisers must be treated equally.\n That means they will rank in seniority from\n the date of their continuous acting in the\n Principal Appraisers' grade subject of course\n to the right of government to revert any of\n them who have not been found fit during the\n period of probation. But if they are found\n fit after the period of probation they rank in\n seniority from the date they have acted\n continuously as Principal Appraisers whether\n they are promotees or direct recruits. The\n present method by which the respondent puts a\n direct recruit from the grade of Appraiser,\n though he is promoted later, above a promotee\n who is promoted to the grade of Principal\n Appraiser on an earlier date clearly denies\n equality of opportunity where the grade of\n Principal Appraiser has only one source of\n recruitment, namely from the grade of\n Appraisers. In such a case the seniority in\n the grade of Principal Appraisers must be\n determined according to the date of continuous\n appointment in that grade irrespective of\n whether the person promoted to that grade from\n the Appraisers' grade is a direct recruit or a\n promotee. This will as we have already said\n be subject to the government's right to revert\n any one promoted as a Princivil Appraiser if\n he is not found fit for the post during the\n period of probation. The petition therefore\n will have to be allowed with respect to the\n method by which seniority is fixed, in the\n grade of Principal Appraisers. That method\n denies equality of opportunity of employment\n to the Appraisers who are the only source of\n recruitment to the grade of Principal\n Appraisers. What the impugned method seeks to\n do is to introduce a kind of reservation in\n respect of the two categories of Appraisers\n from which the promotions are made, and that\n cannot be done when the source of promotion is\n one.\"\n\nWe pass on to consider the next contention of the petitioner\nthat there- was a contractual right as regards the condition\nof service applicable to the petitioner at the time he\nentered Grage 'D and the condition of service could not be\naltered to his disadvantage afterwards by the notification\nissued by the Railway Board. It was said that the order of\nthe Railway Board dated January 25, 1958, Annexure 'B', laid\ndown that promotion to Grade 'C' from Grade 'D' was to be\nbased on seniority-cum-suitability and this condition of\nservice was contractual and could not be altered thereafter\nto the prejudice of the petitioner. In our opinion, there,,\n\n195\n\nis no warrant for this argument. It is 'true that the\norigin of Government service is contractual. There is an\noffer and acceptance in every case. But once appointed to\nhis post or office the Government servant acquires a status\nand his rights and obligations are no longer determined by\nconsent of both parties, but by statute or statutory rules\nwhich may be framed and altered unilaterally by the\nGovernment. In other words, the legal position of a\nGovernment servant is more one of status than of contract.\nThe hall-mark of status is the attachment to a legal\nrelationship of rights and duties imposed by the public 'law\nand not by mere agreement of the parties. The emolument of\nthe Government servant and his terms of service are governed\nby statute or statutory rules which may be unilaterally\naltered by the Government without the consent of the\nemployee. It is true that \nArt. 311\n imposes constitutional\nrestrictions upon the power of removal granted to the\nPresident and the Governor under \nArt. 310.\n But it is\nobvious that the relationship between the Government and its\nservant is not like an ordinary contract of service between\na master and servant. The legal relationship is something\nentirely different, something in the nature of status. It\nis much more than a purely contractual relationship\nvoluntarily entered into between the parties. The duties of\nstatus are 'fixed by the law and in the enforcement of these\nduties society has an interest. In the language of juris-\nprudence status is a condition of membership of a group of\nwhich powers and duties are exclusively determined by law\nand not by agreement between the parties concerned. The\nmatter is clearly stated by Salmond and Williams on\nContracts as follows:\n\n \"So we may find both contractual and status-\n obligations produced by the same transaction.\n the one transaction may result in the creation\n not only of obligations defined by the parties\n and so pertaining to the sphere of contract\n but also and concurrently of obligations de-\n fined by the law,itself, and so pertaining to\n the sphere of status. A contract of service\n between employer and employee, while for the\n most part pertaining exclusively to the sphere\n of contract, pertains also to that of status\n so far as the law itself has seen fit to\n attach to this relation compulsory incidents,\n such as liability to pay compensation for\n accidents. The extent to Which the law is\n content to leave matters within the domain of\n contract to be determined by the exercise of\n the autonomous authority of the parties\n themselves, or thinks fit to bring the matter\n within the sphere of status by mining for\n itself the contents of the relationship, is a\n matter depending on considerations of public\n policy. In such contracts as those of service\n the tendency in modem times is to withdraw the\n matter more and more from the domain of\n contract into that of status.\" .lm0\n (Salmond and Williams on Contracts, 2nd\n edition p. 12).\n\n 196\n\n We are therefore of the opinion that the\n petitioner has no vested contractual right in\n regard to the terms of his service and that\n Counsel for the petitioner has been unable to\n make good his submission on this aspect of the\n case.\n\n But for the reasons already expressed we hold\n that the impugned part of the notification\n violates the guarantee under Arts. 14 and 16\n of the Constitution and a writ in the nature\n of mandamus should be issued commanding the\n first respondent not to give effect to the\n impugned part of the notification, viz.,:\n\n \"The Apprentice T.X.Rs. who have already been\n or will be absorbed in scale Rs. 180-240 upto\n 31-3-66 should first be accommodated in scale\n Rs. 205-280 against the quota of 80% vacancies\n reserved for them. Such staff should not be\n required to undergo a 'Selection' before being\n absorbed in that grade. The upgraded\n vacancies in scale Rs. 205-280 left over after\n earmarking those for the apprentices under\n training on 2-4-66 should be filled by\n promotion of T.X.Rs. in scale Rs. 180-240 on a\n selection basis. While computing the number\n of posts available for promotion of T.X.Rs. in\n scale Rs. 180-240 the vacancies likely to\n occur during the period of apprenticeship of\n the apprentices under training as on 1-4-66\n should also be taken into account. In other\n words, it would be necessary to keep in\n reserve only the number of posts equal to the\n number of apprentices under training as on\n 1-4-66, who cannot be absorbed in the anti-\n cipated vacancies which will arise by the time\n they qualify.\"\n\nThe application is accordingly allowed, but there will be no\n,order with regard to costs in this case.\n\nWrit Petition No. 203 of 1966\n\nThe material facts of this case are parallel to those in\nWrit Petition No. 154 of 1966 and for the reasons already\ngiven we hold that the petitioner is entitled to the grant\nof a writ in the nature of mandamus commanding the\nrespondents not to give effect to the impugned part of the\nnotification dated October 27, 1965, Annexure 'D' to the\nWrit Petition. The application is accordingly allowed, but\nthere will be no order as to costs in this case.\nPetitions allowed. Y. P.\n\n197",

Promotion from Grade 'D'\nto 'C' was on the basis of seniority-cum-suitability. In\nOctober 1965 the Railway Board issued a notification by\nwhich it was provided that eighty per cent of the vacancies\nin Grade 'C' were to be filled up from apprentice train\nexaminers-recruited on and after April 1, 1966 and the\nremaining twenty per cent by train examiners from Grade 'D'.\nThe notification further provided that apprentice train\nexaminers who had already been absorbed in Grade D before\nApril 1966 should en bloc be accommodated in Grade 'C' in\nthe eighty per cent of the vacancies without undergoing any\nselection and with regard to twenty per cent of the\nvacancies, reserved for the other class promotion was to be\non selection basis and not on the basis of seniority-cum-\nsuitability.\nThe petitioner who entered Railway service in 1954 as a\nskilled artisan and was selected and confirmed in Grade 'D'\nfiled a Writ Petition in this Court challenging that part of\nthe notification which gave favourable treatment to\napprentice train examiners who had already been absorbed in\nGrade 14 'D' as arbitrary and discriminatory and violative\nof Articles t4 and 16 of the Constitution. It was also\ncontended that the earlier order laying down that promotion\nto grade 'C' was to be based on seniority-cum-suitability\nhad become a contractual condition of service and could not\nbe altered to the prejudice of the petitioner.\nHELD: (i) The impugned part of the notification violated\nthe guarantee under \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\nOnce the direct recruits and promotees were absorbed in one\ncadre, they formed one class and they could not be\ndiscriminated against for the purpose of further promotion\nto the higher grade 'C'. Before the impugned notification\nwas issued there was only one rule of promotion applicable\nto both direct recruits and promotees. By the impugned\nnotification a discriminatory treatment was made in favour\nof the existing apprentice Train Examiners who had already\nbeen absorbed in grade 'D' because, the notification\nprovided that this group of apprentice train examiners\nshould first be accommodated en bloc in grade 'C' up to\neighty per cent of the vacancies reserved for them without\nundergoing any selection; whereas in the twenty per cent of\nthe vacancies available to the category of Train Examiners\nto which the petitioner belonged the basis of recruitment\nwas selection on merit and the previous test of seniority-\ncum-suitability was abandoned. [192 D-G].\n186\nMervyn v. Collector, [1966] 3 S.C.R. 600: relied on.\n(ii) The petitioner had no vested contractual right in\nregard to the terms of his service. The legal position of a\nGovernment servant is more one of status than of contract.\nOnce appointed to his post or office a Government servant\nacquires a status and his rights and obligations are no\nlonger determined by consent of parties, but by statute or\nstatutory rules which may be framed and altered unilaterally\nby the Government.

The case of the petitioner is that he\nalongwith the direct recruits formed one class in Entry\ngrade 'D' and their condition of service was that seniority\nwas to be reckoned from the date of appointment as Train\nExaminer in Grade 'D' and promotion to Grade 'C' was on the\nbasis of seniority-cum-suitability test irrespective of the\nsource of recruitment. It was alleged that there was no\ndifference between the apprentices and those selected out of\nthe skilled artisans when they entered Grade 'D' and that\nportion of the impugned notification which gave a favourable\ntreatment to the direct recruits in Grade 'D' with regard to\npromotion to Grade 'C' was arbitrary and discriminatory and\nviolated the guarantee under Arts. 14 and 16 of the\nConstitution.

It was. considered that there\nshould be a better calibre of technically trained and\ntechnically qualified personnel for proper maintenance and\nsafety of the Rolling Stock. In view of the decision to\nrecruit Apprentice Train Examiners directly in 'C' Grade\nwith effect from April 1, 1966 those who were Apprentice\nTrain Examiners in Grade 'D' before that date had to be\nupgraded in the scale of Rs. 205-280. It was therefore\nthought that these posts should be upgraded \"so that there\nshould be parity of treatment with the Apprentice Train\nExaminers who were to join after April 1, 1966\". The first\nrespondent has also controverted the allegation of the\npetitioner that the procedure outlined in the impugned\nnotification dated October 27, 1965 in regard to the\nupgraded vacancies was discriminatory.\nThe main question to be considered in this case is whether\nthe notification by the first respondent dated October 27,\n1965 is violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution in\nso far as it makes a discrimination against the petitioner\nfor promotion to Grade 'C'. According to the impugned\nnotification the existing Apprentice Train Examiners who had\nalready been absorbed in grade 'D' by March 31. 1966 should\nfirst be accommodated in grade 'C' in 80% of the vacancies\nreserved for them without undergoing any selection. With\nregard to 20% of the vacancies there is a reservation in\nfavour of the departmental Train Examiners, but the\npromotion is by selection and not by the test of seniority-\ncum-suitability which prevailed before the date of the\nimpugned notification. It was not disputed by Mr. Mehta on\nbehalf of the petitioner that the Railway Board was\ncompetent to say that with effect from April 1, 1966\nvacancies in the Entry grade posts of Train Examiners should\nnot be filled from Apprentice Train Examiners upto 50% but\nshould be exclusively filled by promotion from amongst\nartisan staff. As regards the recruitment to grade 'C', the\nimpugned notification states that with effect from April 1,\n1966 all the Apprentice. Train Examiners on successful\ncompletion of their training should be straightaway brought\non to the scale Rs. 205-280 instead of being first absorbed\nin scale Rs. 180-6-240 as at present. The period of\ntraining was also increased to 5 years on completion of\nwhich they should be put on to the working posts in scale\nRs. 205-280. So far as this portion of the notification is\nconcerned, Counsel for the petitioner did not raise any\nconstitutional objection. But the contention of the\npetitioner is that the following portion of the notification\nwas. constitutionally invalid:"

At the time when the\npetitioner and the direct recruits were appointed to Grade\n'D', there was one class in Grade 'D' formed of direct\nrecruits and the promotees from the grade of artisans. The\nrecruits from both the sources to Grade 'D' were integrated\ninto one class and no discrimination could thereafter be\nmade in favour of recruits from one source as against the\nrecruits from the other source in the matter of promotion to\nGrade 'C'. To put it differently, once the direct recruits\nand promotees are absorbed in one cadre, they form one class\nand they cannot be discriminated for the purpose of further\npromotion to the higher grade 'C'. In the present case, it\nis not disputed on behalf of the first respondent that\nbefore the impugned notification was issued there was only\none rule of promotion for both the departmental promotees\nand the direct recruits and that rule was seniority-cum-\nsuitability, and there was no rule of promotion separately\nmade for application to the direct recruits. As a\nconsequence of the impugned notification a discriminatory\ntreatment is made in favour of the existing Apprentice Train\nExaminers who have already been absorbed in Grade 'D' by\nMarch 31, 1966, because the notification provides that this\ngroup of Apprentice Train Examiners should first be\naccommodated en bloc in grade 'C' upto 80 per cent of\nvacancies reserved for them without undergoing any selec-\ntion. As regards the 20 per cent of the vacancies made\navailable for the category of Train Examiners to which the\npetitioner belongs the basis of recruitment was selection on\nmerit and the previous test of seniority-cum-suitability was\nabandoned. \nIn our opinion, the present case falls within\nthe principle of the recent decision of this Court in \nMervyn\nv. Collector\n(1). In that case, the petitioners who were\nAppraisers in the Customs Department filed a writ petition\nunder \nArt. 32\n, challenging the validity of the \"rotational\"\nsystem as applied in fixing the seniority of Appraisers and\nPrincipal Appraisers. The system, as \nlaid down in\n the\nrelevant departmental circulars was that vacancies occurring\nin the cadre of Appraisers were to go alternatively to\n'promotees' and 'direct recruits'. According to the\npetitioners of that case this resulted in inequality,\nespecially in view of the fact that the number of direct\nrecruits over the years was very low.
