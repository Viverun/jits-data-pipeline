Smt. Uma Kushwah, learned Counsel appearing for\n complainant is permitted to assist the prosecution in the matter.\n\n This first bail application has been filed by applicant under \nSection 439\n\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for grant of bail in connection with\n Crime No.1155 of 2023, registered at Police Station Dabra, District Gwalior\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: MAHENDRA\n\nBARIK\n\nSigning time: 27-02-2024\n\n10:10:25 PM\n\n 2\n\n (M.P.) for offence punishable under \nSection 376\n, \n450\n, \n323\n of IPC. Applicant is\n in judicial custody since 29-12-2023.\n\n As per the case of prosecution, victim aged around 19 years, submitted a\n typed complaint on 29-12-2023 at 10:15 am with SHO, PS Dabra, District\n Gwalior alleging rape against Hemant Parihar (applicant). It is stated in\n complaint that she and Hemant Parihar used to communicate on mobile phone.\n Some days before, she had stopped conversation with Hemant but Hemant\n used to call her. On 28-12-2023 around 10:00 in the night, she was at her home\n along with her younger brothers and uncle. Her brother went outside with pet\n dog. Hemant entered her room and closed door. Hemant committed rape on\n\n her. Hemant pushed her. She sustained injury near her left eye. Hemant also\n slapped her. Hearing her shouts, her uncle and younger brothers came there,\n then Hemant left her. She opened the door, Hemant fled away. Her uncle\n informed her father on phone. Her parents had gone to Gwalior, therefore, she\n could not report in the night. On such allegations, PS Dabra registered FIR at\n Crime No.1155 of 2023 for offence punishable under \nSections 376\n, \n450\n, \n323\n of\n IPC against applicant. Victim was forwarded for medico-legal examination.\n Victim informed the history of sexual violence to the Medical Officer that\n accused had come to her room around 10:00 pm. Accused forced her for\n having sexual relation. When she denied, accused forcefully had sexual\n intercourse with her. Suddenly, her relative came there and saw them in\n uncomfortable condition and caught them. No external injury was found on the\n person of the victim. Statements of the victim under \nSections 161\n and \n164\n of\n CrPC were recorded. Statements of other witnesses have also been recorded.\n Applicant was arrested on 29-12-2023, he is in custody ever since.

Applicant has been falsely implicated in the matter\n under the pressure of family members of the victim. Leaned Counsel further\n referring to the site map and narration of history by the victim to Medical\n Officer, submits that the allegation of forceful sexual assault is highly\n improbable as younger brothers and uncle of the victim were present in the\n same house although in different room. Learned Counsel further submits that\n the applicant is aged 19 years. He is pursuing studies. He is a student of BA\n first year. There is no likelihood of his absconsion leaving his family, home and\n studies. No further custodial interrogation of applicant is needed. There is no\n likelihood of tampering with evidence as both the parties belong to same socio-\n economic status. Trial would take time to conclude. Therefore, applicant may\n be extended the benefit of bail.\n\n P e r contra, learned counsel for the State ably assisted by learned\n Counsel for the complainant opposes the bail application on the ground of\n gravity of alleged offence and submits that statements of victim on record make\n out a case of sexual assault against applicant. Learned Counsel for State further\n cites criminal history of two cases against the applicant.\n\n In reply, learned Counsel for the applicant submits that other two cases\n relate to minor offence.Applicant has been granted bail in two cases which are\n pending for trial and he has never been convicted.\n\n Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.\n Considering the arguments advanced by both the parties and overall\n circumstances of the case, regard being had to the young age of the applicant,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: MAHENDRA\n\nBARIK\n\nSigning time: 27-02-2024\n\n10:10:25 PM\n\n 4\n\n but without commenting on merits of the case, this Court is inclined to release\n the applicant on bail. Thus, the application is allowed.\n\n Accordingly, it is directed that applicant- Hemant Parihar s hall be\n released on bail in relation to Crime No.1155 of 2023, registered at Police\n Station Dabra, District Gwalior (M.P.) for offence punishable under \nSection\n 376\n, \n450\n, \n323\n of I P C upon furnishing a personal bond in the sum of\n Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lac only) with one solvent surety to the\n satisfaction of the Trial Court, for compliance with the following conditions,:\n\n (For the sake of convenience of understanding by accused and surety, the\n conditions of bail are also reproduced in Hindi as under):-\n\n (1) Applicant shall remain present on every date of hearing as may be\n directed by the concerned court;\n\n (1) vkosnd lacaf/kr U;k;ky; ds funZs'kkuqlkj lquokbZ dh izR;sd frfFk ij mifLFkr jgsxkA\n\n (2) Applicant shall not commit or get involved in any offence of similar\n nature;\n\n (2) vkosnd leku izd`fr dk dksbZ vijk/k ugha djsxk ;k mlesa lfEefyr ugha gksxkA\n\n (3) Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat\n or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to\n dissuade them/him/her from disclosing such facts to the Court or to the police\n officer;\n\n (3) vkosnd izdzj.k ds rF;ksa ls ifjfpr fdlh O;fDr dks izR;{k ;k vizR;{k :i ls\n izyksHku] /kedh ;k opu ugha nsxk] ftlls ,slk O;fDr ,sls rF;ksa dks U;k;ky; ;k iqfyl vf/kdkjh\n dks izdV djus ls fuokfjr gksA\n\n (4) Applicant shall not directly or indirectly attempt to tamper with the\n evidence or allure, pressurize or threaten the witness;\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: MAHENDRA\n\nBARIK\n\nSigning time: 27-02-2024\n\n10:10:25 PM\n\n 5\n\n (4) vkosnd izR;{k ;k vizR;{k :i ls lk{; ds lkFk NsMNkM djus dk ;k lk{kh ;k\n lkf{k;ksa dks cgykus&Qqlykus] ncko Mkyus ;k /kedkus dk iz;kl ugha djsxkA\n\n (5) During trial, the applicant shall ensure due compliance of provisions of\n \nSection 309\n of Cr.P.C. regarding examination of witnesses in attendance;\n\n (5) fopkj.k ds nkSjku] mifLFkr xokgksa ls ijh{k.k ds laca/k esa vkosnd /kkjk 309 na-iz-la- ds\n izko/kkuksa dk mfpr vuqikyu lqfuf'pr djsxkA\n\n This order shall be effective till the end of trial.
