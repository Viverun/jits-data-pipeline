Respondent\n Through: Mr. Ajay Vikram Singh, APP for\n State with Insp. G. R. Meena, PS\n Swaroop Nagar.\n CORAM:\n HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SAURABH BANERJEE\n ORDER\n\n % 21.12.2023\n\n 1. The applicant, vide the present application under \nSection 439\n of the\n Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [\nCrPC\n] seeks regular bail in FIR\n No.0043/2018 dated 01.02.2018 registered under Section(s) 498A/304B/\n 34 of the \nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860 [\nIPC\n] at PS.: Swaroop Nagar, North\n West District, Delhi.\n\n 2. As per FIR, the deceased person namely Babita and the applicant\n got married on 08.12.2016. Sometime in the evening of 31.01.2018, the\n parents of the deceased person were informed by the parents of the\n applicant that the deceased person had committed suicide by hanging\n herself from the ceiling fan. Thereafter, on the statement of the mother of\n the deceased person, the present FIR came to be registered on the very\n next day and the applicant was arrested on 01.02.2018.\n\n BAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 1 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\n\n 3. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant has\n been falsely implicated in the present FIR; and that the testimonies of the\n parents of the deceased person have already been recorded, which reflect\n that the applicant was not at all involved in the death of the deceased\n person and further that their statements recorded before the SDM as well\n as before the learned Trial Court reflect only vague allegations as regards\n demand of dowry and cruelty meted out to the deceased person; and that\n there is no suicide note or any other documentary evidence other than the\n uncorroborated testimony of the mother of the deceased person; and that\n there is no proximate link with the cruelty, if any, meted out to the\n deceased person, as such, the offence under \nSection 304B\n of the IPC is not\n made out against the applicant; and that the applicant satisfies the triple\n test for grant of bail; and that as per the SDM Report, the applicant was\n not even present at the place of the incident and lastly that since at least 12\n out of the 15 witnesses have already been examined before the learned\n Trial Court and since the trial is likely to take a considerable time to\n conclude, therefore, in the interest of justice, the applicant ought to be\n released on bail.\n\n 4. This Court, vide its order dated 22.11.2021, issued Notice and\n called for the Status Report. Additionally, Nominal Roll was also\n requisitioned from the concerned Jail Superintendant. Further, vide order\n dated 27.04.2023, the latest Nominal Roll was requisitioned from the\n concerned Jail Superintendant.\n\n 5. Learned APP for the State, while opposing grant of bail submits that\n the offence(s) as alleged in the FIR are serious in nature; and that the time\n gap between the date of marriage and the date of death of the deceased\n\n BAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 2 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\n person is just over a year and the same raises a serious suspicion upon the\n role of the applicant; and that the complainant in her statement before the\n SDM had raised the allegations as regards demand of dowry and cruelty\n meted out to the deceased person; and that the parents of the deceased\n person have supported the case of the prosecution; and lastly that since\n there are only 2 more formal witnesses left to be examined, therefore, the\n trial is likely to conclude soon, as such, the applicant, ought not to be\n granted bail in the present application.\n\n 6. As per Nominal Roll, as on 26.05.2023, the applicant has been in\n judicial custody for a total period of 2 years, 9 months and 5 days. Further,\n the overall jail conduct of the applicant has been „Satisfactory‟.\n\n 7. This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties and also\n perused the documents on record.\n\n 8. An offence under \nSection 304B\n of the IPC, involved in the present\n proceedings, has to have the basic ingredients as laid out therein. Firstly, it\n is presupposed that \"cruelty\" has been meted out to the deceased person.\n Secondly, the said cruelty is to be coupled with a \"demand of dowry\". In\n essence thereof, any demand of dowry has to be the reason for such\n cruelty. Thus, for drawing any such presumption under \nSection 304B\n IPC,\n it is necessary that the deceased person was subjected to such cruelty or\n harassment in connection with any demand of dowry soon prior to his/ her\n death.\n\n 9. In the present proceedings, there are no allegations of that kind.\n Thus, there are no elements regarding demand of dowry by the applicant\n during the time period when he was married to the deceased person. There\n was never anything, much less any formal complaint, made as regards to\n\n BAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 3 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\n any cruelty or demand of dowry at any point of time during the time\n period when the deceased person was married to the applicant and was\n indeed residing with him. The same holds much significance while this\n Court is considering grant of bail to the applicant.\n\n 10. Furthermore, it is also a matter of fact that the present is not a case\n involving a suicide note.\n\n 11. In the present proceedings, the applicant has already been behind\n bars for a period of almost 3 years and since the trial is likely to take some\n time to conclude, therefore, it shall be in the interest of justice, if the\n applicant is released on bail.\n\n \n12. No doubt, though the applicant has been named in the FIR as an\n accused, however, till the final outcome of the proceedings emanating\n therefrom, the status of the applicant is merely that of a suspect. The\n applicant is innocent till proven guilty. As such, keeping the applicant\n languishing behind bars during such time, would serve no fruitful purpose.\n Also, the same shall be a violation of \nArticle 21\n of The Constitution of\n India [Re.: \nHussainara Khatoon & Ors vs Home Secretary, State Of\n Bihar\n (1980) 1 SCC 81; \nSatender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of\n Investigation\n (2022) 10 SCC 51].\n\n 13. Thus, considering the aforesaid factual scenario coupled with the\n legal position at hand, in the interest of justice, this is a fit case to release\n the applicant on bail.\n\n 14. Accordingly, the applicant is released on bail in FIR No.0043/2018\n dated 01.02.2018 registered under Section(s) 498A/304B/34 of the \nIPC\n at\n PS.: Swaroop Nagar, North West District, Delhi, subject to him furnishing\n a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand Only)\n\n BAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 4 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\n along with one surety of the like amount by a family member/ friend\n having no criminal case pending against them and subject to the\n satisfaction of the learned Trial Court, and further subject to the following\n conditions:\n\n i. Applicant shall not leave the National Capital Territory of\n Delhi without prior permission of this Court and shall ordinarily\n resideat the address as per prison records. If he wishes to change is\n residential address he shall immediately intimate about the same to\n the Jail Superintendent by way of an affidavit.\n\n ii.

If he does not possess the same, he shall\n filean affidavit before the Investigating Officer to that effect within\n the stipulated time.\n\n iii. Applicant shall appear before the Court as and when the\n matter is taken up for hearing.\n\n iv. Applicant shall join investigation as and when called by the\n Investigating Officer concerned. He shall not obstruct or hamper\n with the police investigation and shall not play mischief with the\n evidence collected oryet to be collected by the Police.\n\n v.

Applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity and\n shall not communicate with or come in contact with any of the\n prosecution witnesses, the victim or any member of the victim's\n family or tamper with the evidence of the case or try to dissuade\n them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police\n officials.\n\n 15. Accordingly, the present application is allowed and disposed of\n alongwith the pending application, if any, in the above terms.\n\n 16.
