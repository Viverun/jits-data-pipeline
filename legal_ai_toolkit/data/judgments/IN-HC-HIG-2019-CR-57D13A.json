Reveals that there were allegations of dowry demand against\n\nall the accused including the petitioner but the specific allegations of\n2 M.Cr.C. No.43060/19\n\ndowry demand related cruelty inflicted soon before death is reflected\n\nfrom the SMS sent on 23/07/2019 by the deceased to her brother that\n\nmother-in-law (Guddi Bai), sister-in-law (Rani) & Husband\n\n(Gajendra) are inflicting physical cruelty upon the deceased.
