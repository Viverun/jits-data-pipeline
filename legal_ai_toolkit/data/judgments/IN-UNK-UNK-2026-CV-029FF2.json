Gavai\n, \nVikram Nath\n, \nSanjay Karol\n\n 1\n\n REPORTABLE\n\n IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\n CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1741 OF 2010\n\n UDAYAKUMAR … APPELLANT\n\n VERSUS\n\n STATE OF TAMIL NADU … RESPONDENT\n\n JUDGEMENT\n\n SANJAY KAROL, J.\n\n \n1. The Appellant Udayakumar (A-2) stands convicted by both\n\n the courts below for murdering one Purushothaman, thus\n\n having committed an offence punishable under \nSection 302\n\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Consequently he is\n\n sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life. However, in\n\n relation to an offence under \nSection 120-B\n of the Indian\n\n Penal Code, 1860 he stands acquitted vide impugned\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\n judgement delivered by High Court dated 15.03.2010 in\n\nNarendra Prasad\n\nDate: 2023.03.17\n\n16:35:12 IST\n\nReason:\n\n\f 2\n\n Criminal Appeal No. 17, 22 and 24 of 2010 titled as\n\n \nUdayakumar & Ors. v. The State of Tamil Nadu\n.\n\n2. Significantly, in terms of the very same impugned\n\n judgement, the other two co-accused persons namely\n\n Panneer Dass (A-1) and Periyasamy (A-3) stand acquitted in\n\n the relation to both the offences i.e. \nSection 302\n and \nSection\n\n 120-B\n of the Penal Code.\n\n3. As a result, the present appeal filed by convict, Udayakumar\n\n (A-2).\n\n4. Prosecution through the testimonies of 23 witnesses has\n\n tried to establish complicity of all the three accused on the\n\n prognosis that Panneer Das (A-1) was having business\n\n relationship with the deceased (Purushothaman). Since\n\n certain disputes and business rivalry emerged between the\n\n two, the former harboured a grudge against the latter.\n\n Resultantly, he along with A-3 hatched a conspiracy to\n\n murder the deceased and for achieving such a design\n\n services of A-2 were engaged. On 22.10.2008, at about\n\n 8:30PM, A-2 killed the victim with a sickle by giving blows\n\n\f 3\n\n on the side of the neck. Immediately thereafter, A-1 and A-3\n\n came in a vehicle, in which A-2 fled away from the spot of\n\n the crime which was an open public road. The incident was\n\n witnessed by Venkatesan (PW-1) who was known to the\n\n deceased. With the matter being reported to the police, FIR\n\n No. 2261 / 2008 dated 22.10.2008 was registered at Police\n\n Station, Theynampet. The investigation was conducted by\n\n Police Officer Kuppusamy (PW-23) and after recovering the\n\n body of the deceased, the post-mortem was conducted by\n\n Dr. K.Mathiharan (PW-21). Initial investigation revealed\n\n complicity of A-1 and A-3. As such, the latter was arrested\n\n on 16.12.2009, who disclosed the cause and the manner of\n\n commission of crime.\n\n5. With the completion of investigation, challan was presented\n\n before the Court for Trial. Vide judgment dated 04.12.2009\n\n in S.C. No. 113 of 2009 titled as State v. Panneerdass & Ors.\n\n the Ld. Trial Court, convicted all the accused in relation to\n\n the offences charged for and sentenced them to a term of life\n\n imprisonment.\n\n\f 4\n\n6. Significantly, the High Court, by disbelieving the testimonies\n\n of the prosecution witnesses, repelling the case of\n\n conspiracy, acquitted A-1 and A-3 on all counts and only on\n\n the basis of identification of A-2 by PW-1, upheld the\n\n conviction and sentence with respect to the offence\n\n punishable under \nSection 302\n of the Indian Penal Code. It is\n\n a matter of record that no appeal against the judgement of\n\n acquittal of A-1 and A-3 stands preferred by the prosecution\n\n / State. Hence, this Court has been called upon only to\n\n examine the guilt or innocence of A-2.\n\n7. We may reiterate that other than the identification of A-2\n\n being the assailant as witnessed by PW-1, there is no\n\n material on record, be it of whatsoever nature, linking the\n\n Appellant to the crime. There is no material to indicate that\n\n A-1 or A-3 hired the services of A-2 for murdering deceased\n\n Purushotaman. Further, there is no material indicating the\n\n accused to have murdered the victim with a sickle, the\n\n alleged weapon of offence. No tell-tale signs or evidence, be it\n\n of any nature, scientific or otherwise, is on record, even\n\n remotely linking the convict to the crime.\n\n\f 5\n\n8. Examining the testimony of PW-1, we notice him to have\n\n firstly reported the matter to the police and in the FIR there\n\n is no description of the assailant, much less identity of A-2\n\n to have been disclosed. Yet, the High Court, even while\n\n discarding the disclosure statement of A-3, convicted A-2,\n\n which in our considered view has resulted into travesty of\n\n justice.\n\n9. This Court in the case of \nAnil Phukan v. State of Assam\n,\n\n (1993) 3 SCC 282 has held that:\n\n \n“ 3. … So long as the single eyewitness is a wholly\n reliable witness the courts have no difficulty in basing\n conviction on his testimony alone. However, where the\n single eyewitness is not found to be a wholly reliable\n witness, in the sense that there are some\n circumstances which may show that he could have an\n interest in the prosecution, then the courts generally\n insist upon some independent corroboration of his\n testimony, in material particulars, before recording\n conviction. It is only when the courts find that the\n single eyewitness is a wholly unreliable witness that\n his testimony is discarded in toto and no amount of\n corroboration can cure that defect…”\n\n Examining the testimony of PW-1, we find him to be\n\n materially contradicted and his version belied through the\n\n testimony of the Investigation Officer, (PW-23). This is with\n\n regard to the identification of the accused. Whereas the\n\n\f 6\n\nformer states that he identified the accused in front of the\n\njudge, pursuant to the summons issued to him for making\n\nhimself available at Pulhal Jail, Chennai for the purpose of\n\nidentifying the accused, but the latter, in unequivocal terms\n\nstates that, “… it is correct to say that PW-1 would give the\n\nstatement that they came to know that the second accused\n\nUdayakumar had murdered Purushothaman” and that “it is\n\ncorrect to say that only after identifying the accused at the\n\nPolice Station, they had identified the accused at the\n\nidentification parade.” Now, if the identity of the accused\n\nwas already in the knowledge of the police or the witnesses,\n\nthen we only wonder, where would the question of\n\nconducting the identification parade arise? We reiterate that\n\nthe entire necessity for holding an investigation parade can\n\narise only when the accused are not previously known to the\n\nwitnesses. The whole idea of a test identification parade is that\n\nwitnesses who claim to have seen the culprits at the time of\n\noccurrence are to identify them from the midst of other persons\n\nwithout any aid or any other source. [\nHeera v State of\n\nRajasthan\n (2007) 10 SC 175]. We may also state that the\n\ninvestigation parade does not hold much value when the identity\n\n\f 7\n\nof the accused is already known to the witness.\n \n[\nSheikh Sintha\n\nMadhar v. State\n, (2016) 11 SCC 265].\n This Court has\n\nelaborately stated the purpose of conducting the\n\nidentification parade in the case of State of Maharashtra v.\n\nSuresh, (2000) 1 SCC 471 as:\n\n \n“22. … We remind ourselves that identification\n parades are not primarily meant for the court. They\n are meant for investigation purposes. The object of\n conducting a test identification parade is twofold. First\n is to enable the witnesses to satisfy themselves that\n the prisoner whom they suspect is really the one who\n was seen by them in connection with the commission\n of the crime. Second is to satisfy the investigating\n authorities that the suspect is the real person whom\n the witnesses had seen in connection with the said\n occurrence. So the officer conducting the test\n identification parade should ensure that the said\n object of the parade is achieved. If he permits dilution\n of the modality to be followed in a parade, he should\n see to it that such relaxation would not impair the\n purpose for which the parade is held [vide \nBudhsen v.\n State of U.P.\n (1970) 2 SCC 128; \nRamanathan v. State\n of T.N.\n (1978) 3 SCC 86].”\n\nFurther in \nGireesan Nair & Others v. State of Kerala\n\n(2023) 1 SCC 180, the Court observed that:\n\n “44.…this Court has categorically held that where the\n accused has been shown to the witness or even his\n photograph has been shown by the investigating\n officer prior to a TIP, holding an identification parade\n in such facts and circumstances remains\n inconsequential.\n\n \n45. Another crucial decision was rendered by this\n Court in \nSk. Umar Ahmed Shaikh v. State of\n Maharashtra\n (1998) 5 SCC 103, where it was held:\n\n\f 8\n\n 8. … But, the question arises : what value\n could be attached to the evidence of identity of\n accused by the witnesses in the Court when\n the accused were possibly shown to the\n witnesses before the identification parade in\n the police station. The Designated Court has\n already recorded a finding that there was\n strong possibility that the suspects were shown\n to the witnesses. Under such circumstances,\n when the accused were already shown to the\n witnesses, their identification in the Court by\n the witnesses was meaningless. The statement\n of witnesses in the Court identifying the\n accused in the Court lost all its value and could\n not be made the basis for recording conviction\n against the accused….”\n\n10. If the theory of conspiracy was disbelieved by the High\n\n Court then in our considered view, there was no basis or\n\n reason to have upheld the conviction of A-2, more so, when\n\n on the basis of the very same set of evidence led by the\n\n prosecution, the principle conspirators involved in the crime\n\n were acquitted.\n\n11. Unfortunately in the impugned judgement, there is neither\n\n any reasoning, nor any appreciation of evidence on record.\n\n We cannot convict the accused on the basis of the principles\n\n of preponderance of probability. It is our duty to make sure\n\n that miscarriage of justice is avoided at all costs and the\n\n benefit of doubt, if any, given to the accused. [\nSujit Biswas\n\n\f 9\n\n v. State of Assam\n, (2013) 12 SCC 406, Hanumant\n\n Govind Nargundkar v. State of M.P. (AIR 1952 SC 343)\n\n and State v. Mahender Singh Dahiya, (2011) 3 SCC 109].\n\n12. We may also record that in the impugned judgment running\n\n into 21 pages, the High Court has extensively dealt with the\n\n theory of conspiracy and guilt of A-1 and A-3 and only in\n\n the penultimate part, that is, paragraphs 26 and 27,\n\n casually, dealt with the guilt of the A-3.\n\n13. In our considered view, prosecution has failed to establish\n\n the guilt of the accused much less meeting the requirement\n\n of the same having been established beyond reasonable\n\n doubt.\n\n14. In the present case before us, we find neither the chain of\n\n evidence to have been completely established nor the\n\n circumstances, conclusively pointing towards the guilt of\n\n commission of crime by the Appellant. The prosecution has\n\n failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. This Court\n\n has stated essential conditions that must be fulfilled before\n\n an accused can be convicted in a case revolving around\n\n\f 10\n\n circumstantial evidence in the landmark case of Sharad\n\n Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Mahrashtra, (1984) 4 SCC\n\n 116.\n\n15. In the normal course of adjudication followed by this Court,\n\n when there is a concurrent findings of fact by the Courts\n\n below, this Court interferes only in exceptional cases or\n\n where gross errors have been committed which overlook\n\n crying circumstances and well established principles of\n\n criminal jurisprudence. [\nRamaphupala Reddy v. State of\n\n Andhra Pradesh\n, (1970) 3 SCC 474, Balak Ram v. State\n\n of U.P., (\n1975) 3 SCC 219, Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State\n\n of Gujarat\n, (1983) 3 SCC 217]. Hence in the attending\n\n circumstances, it becomes our bounden duty to correct\n\n such findings.\n\n16. To conclude, we state that the judgments of conviction and\n\n sentence in respect to the appellant present before us,\n\n Udayakumar (A-2), passed by the Ld. Trial Court in S.C. No.\n\n 113 of 2009 dated 04.12.2009 as affirmed by the High\n\n Court in Criminal Appeals No. 17, 22 and 24 of 2010 dated\n\n\f 11\n\n 15.03.2010 titled as \nUdayakumar & Ors. v. The State of\n\n Tamil Nadu\n are quashed and set aside.\n\n17. Appeal stands allowed.\n\n18. Since the appellant is already on bail, his bail bond shall\n\n stand discharged.\n\n ………………J.\n (B.R.
