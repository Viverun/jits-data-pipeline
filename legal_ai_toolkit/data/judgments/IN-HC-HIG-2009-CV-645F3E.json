Under\n\nthe State policy, the millers are given the paddy for custom milling on year\n\nto year basis. The present dispute relates to the year 2002-2003. The millers\n\nand the Governor of Haryana entered into agreements regarding the custom\n\nmilling of the paddy. In FAO No.4855 of 2007, an agreement came to be\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 3\n\nexecuted on 16.10.2002 between the Govenor of Haryana through District\n\nFood and Supplies Controller and M/s Sain Dass Rice Mill, Mathana Distt.\n\nKurukshetra for milling the quantity specified in the agreement. In FAO\n\nNo.4898 of 2007, an agreement came to be executed on 1.10.2002 between\n\nthe Govenor of Haryana through District Food and Supplies Controller and\n\nM/s Bharat Rice Mill, Gamri Road, Kurukshetra for milling the quantity\n\nspecified therein. Similarly, in FAO No.4897 of 2007, an agreement came to\n\nbe executed on 16.10.2002 between the Govenor of Haryana through\n\nDistrict Food and Supplies Controller and M/s Nagpal Rice Mills, GT\n\nRoad, Umri, Distt. Kurukshetra for milling the quantity specified therein.\n\nOn behalf of the State of Haryana, it is alleged that the millers failed\n\nto mill the quantity in time and also did not return the paddy/rice which\n\ncaused huge loss to the Government. The millers also raised certain\n\ndefences which gave rise to disputes between the parties. Clause 23 of the\n\nagreement(s) executed between the parties requires the settlement of\n\ndisputes between the parties through arbitration. The Director Food and\n\nSupplies or any person appointed by him can act as the Arbiter Tribunal for\n\nadjudication of the disputes between the parties. It may be useful to\n\nconsider Clause 23 of the agreement(s) which reads as under:-\n\n\"23.All the disputes and different arising out of or in any\n\nmanner touching or concerning this agreement\n\nwhatsoever (except as to any matter the decision of\n\nwhich is expressly provided for in the contract) shall be\n\nreferred to the sole arbitration of the Director or any\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 4\n\nperson appointed by him in this behalf. There will be no\n\nobjection to any such appointment that the person\n\nappointed is or was an employee of Food & Supplies\n\nDeptt. Haryana and he had expressed views on all or any\n\nof the matter in dispute or difference. The award of such\n\narbitration shall be final and binding on the parties to\n\nthis contract. It is a term of this contract that in the event\n\nof transfer, vacation of office, or being unable to act for\n\nany reason of a person appointed as an arbitrator by the\n\nDirector at the time of such transfer, vacation of office,\n\ndeath or inability shall appoint another person to act as\n\nan arbitrator such a person shall be entitled to proceed\n\nwith reference from the stage where is was left by his\n\npredecessor.....\"\n\nThis arbitration clause takes into its sweep all kinds of disputes. The\n\nDistrict Food and Supplies Controller, Kurukshetra approached the Director\n\nFood and Supplies, Haryana for appropriate instructions, in view of the\n\ndefault committed by the three millers named above, vide his request letter\n\ndated April, 2003. This request was accompanied with a letter from the\n\nconcerned miller for extension of time for completing the job of milling as\n\nalso a separate letter of the even date wherein the miller undertook to\n\ndeliver the rice by the extended time and on failure to do so to deposit the\n\nentire amount of the rice, as per rules. A representative of the miller also\n\nfiled an affidavit in support of the request. Separate affidavits dated\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 5\n\n18.12.2003 were also filed requesting the authorities to grant extension in\n\ntime and failing which the matter may be taken up before the arbitrator as\n\nper agreement Clause. On the aforesaid request of the District Food and\n\nSupplies Controller, a Junior Legal Remembrance (JLR) advised to proceed\n\nin accordance with the terms of the contract and action under Clauses 14\n\nand 23 of the agreement may be taken by the Government. A note was\n\nprepared by one Naresh Kumar, Deputy Director (Procurement) and\n\ninitiator of the note namely Naresh Kumar Sharma, Deputy Director\n\n(Procurement) was appointed as the Arbitrator by the Director Food and\n\nSupplies Haryana vide his order dated 2.7.2004. The said Aribter Tribunal\n\nentered upon the reference and passed an order dated 1.10.2004 whereby the\n\nclaims made by the District Food and Supplies Controller, Kurukshetra\n\nagainst the millers were dismissed as withdrawn in view of the extension in\n\nthe period for delivery of the CMR by the Government upto 5.12.2004. The\n\nclaim was accordingly dismissed as withdrawn being premature with liberty\n\nto file a fresh claim.\n\nIt appears that the millers failed to deliver the CMR even by the\n\nextended period and thus Baljit Singh Kularia was appointed as the sole\n\nArbitrator to consider the claims lodged by the District Food and Supplies\n\nController, Kurukshetra. The said Arbitrator entered upon the reference.\n\nDuring the proceedings before him, the millers made an applications under\n\nSections 12\n,\nand\nof the Arbitration Act to challenge his appointment.\n\nHowever, the said application was dismissed vide order dated 28.1.2005.\n\nThe millers besides filing their reply also filed their counter claims against\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 6\n\nthe claimant in all the cases. The Arbitrator vide his separate awards\n\nmentioned here-in-above allowed the claims and also awarded interest at the\n\nrate of 11.55% per annum in favour of the claimant, namely, District Food\n\nand Supplies Controller, Kurukshetra.\n\nThese awards were challenged in the Court of District Judge,\n\nKurukshetra by filing applications under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act\n\non variety of grounds . These applications have been rejected by the\n\nDistrict Judge vide his detailed judgments which are under challenge in\n\nthese appeals before this Court.\n\nThe millers-appellants have accordingly filed these appeals questing\n\nthe judgments/orders passed by the District Judge, Kurukshetra under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act and also the validity of the awards passed\n\nby the Arbitrator.\n\nThe grounds of challenge urged in applications under\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Arbitration Act have been reiterated in the present appeals. The validity\n\nof the awards has been challenged on the following grounds:-\n\ni) The Agreement signed by District Food and Supplies Controller,\n\nKurukshetra on behalf of the Governor of the State is nullity as the\n\nsaid Officer was not competent to execute the agreement/contract\n\non behalf of the Governor of Haryana in terms of\nArticle 299 (1)\n\nof the Constitution of India;\n\nii) The award passed by the Arbitrator is against public policy as\n\nthe claim preferred by the Department before Sh.Naresh Kumar\n\nSharma, Deputy Director (Procurement), the earlier appointed\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 7\n\nArbitrator had been withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh claim;\n\niii)The Arbitrator has failed to decide the counter claims filed by\n\nthe appellants herein vitiating the entire award;\n\niv)The Arbitrator has awarded interest which was not within his\n\ndomain as the question of interest could only be decided by the\n\nDirector Food and Supplies Haryana in terms of Clause 9 of the\n\nagreement, thus not arbitrable.\n\nv)Since the period of delivery was extended by the Government\n\nof India from 1.3.2003 to 31.8.2005, no interest was payable for\n\nthe said period and the award allowing interest for the aforesaid\n\nperiod is illegal and without any basis;\n\nvi)Under the agreement only simple interest is awardable whereas\n\nthe Arbitrator has awarded compound interest\n\nvii)The agreement executed by only one of the partners is void ab\n\ninitio in so far as the enforceability of the arbitration clause is\n\nconcerned in terms of\nSection 19 (2)\nof the Indian Partnership\n\nAct;\n\nviii)The reference itself is bad as State of Haryana has not filed\n\nany claim or sought reference of dispute to the Arbitrator;\n\nix)The Arbitrator has been appointed by the Director Food and\n\nSupplies Controller, Kurukshetra without any request by either of\n\nthe parties to the dispute; and\n\nx)No notice was issued to the appellants before making\n\nappointment of the Arbitrator.\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 8\n\nGround No. i)\n\nThis ground relates to the validity of the arbitration agreement. It is\n\nalleged that the District Food and Supplies Controller who has executed the\n\nagreement on behalf of the Governor is not the competent authority having\n\nbeen not authorized in accordance with the provisions of\nArticle 299\nof the\n\nConstitution of India nor he had any specific or genuine authority to execute\n\nsuch agreement.\nArticle 299\nof the Constitution of India reads as under:-\n\n\"299.Contracts.- (1) All contracts made in the exercise of the\nexecutive power of the Union or of a State shall be expressed\nto be made by the President, or by the Governor of the State,\nas the case may be, and all such contracts and all assurances of\nproperty made in the exercise of that power shall be executed\non behalf of President or the Governor by such persons and in\nsuch manner as he may direct or authorize.\n\n(2) Neither the President nor the Governor shall be personally\nliable in respect of any contract or assurance made or executed\nfor the purposes of this Constitution, or for the purposes of any\nenactment relating to the Government of India heretofore in\nforce, nor shall any person making or executing any such\ncontract or assurance on behalf of any of them be personally\nliable in respect thereof.\"\n\nThis Article provides that Contracts made in exercise of executive\n\npower of the Union or the State should be expressed to be made by the\n\nPresident or by the Governor of the State, as the case may be and all such\n\ncontracts are to be executed on behalf of the President or the Governor by\n\nsuch person(s) or in such manner as he may direct or authorize. The word\n\n\"he\" is significant. This clearly prescribes that the Contracts are to be\n\nexecuted by such person(s) as may be authorized by the Governor or under\n\nhis direction. Mr. Bansal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 9\n\nrespondents has referred to and relied upon Annexure O-2 forming part of\n\nthe record of the Arbitrator which is a policy letter for purchase of paddy\n\nduring the kharif 2002-03. In the aforesaid letter, it has been mentioned in\n\nparagraph 2 that the instructions earlier issued by the Head Office on\n\n5.10.2000 and 8.10.2001 are applicable. Clause (b) of the aforesaid policy\n\ndecision, however, directs all District Food and Supplies Controllers in the\n\nState to execute the agreements with rice millers. Based upon the aforesaid\n\npolicy decision, it is contended that there was specific delegation of power\n\nand authority by the Government to execute the agreements on behalf of the\n\nGovernor/State. To the contrary, counsel for the appellants has vehemently\n\nargued that there is no specific authority under the business rules framed by\n\nthe Governor under\nArticle 166\nof the Constitution of India authorizing the\n\nDistrict Food and Supplies Controller to execute the agreement on behalf of\n\nthe Governor. I have perused\nArticle 166\nof the Constitution of India. From\n\nthe perusal thereof, it appears that it has no application to the issue involved\n\nand sought to be argued.\nArticle 166\nis quoted here under:-\n\n\"166. Conduct of business of the Government of a\n\nState.- (1) All executive action of the Government\n\nof a State shall be expressed to be taken in the\n\nname of the Governor.\n\n(2)Orders and other instruments made and\n\nexecuted in the name of the Governor shall be\n\nauthenticated in such manner as may be specified\n\nin rules to be made by the Governor, and the\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 10\n\nvalidity of an order or instrument which is so\n\nauthenticated shall not be called in question on the\n\nground that it is not an order or instrument made or\n\nexecuted by the Governor.\n\n(3)The Governor shall make rules for the more\n\nconvenient transaction of the business of the\n\nGovernment of the State, and for the allocation\n\namong Ministers of the said business in so far as it\n\nis not business with respect to which the Governor\n\nis by or under this Constitution required to act in\n\nhis discretion.\"\n\nThis only provides that all executive actions of the Government of the\n\nState are to be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor and all\n\norders and instruments made and executed are to be authenticated in the\n\nmanner specified in the rules. This Article does not deal with the execution\n\nof the Contracts and agreements, but only deals with the authentication of\n\nthe orders and instruments made on behalf of the Governor. It is only\n\nArticle 299\nwhich specifically deals with the execution of the agreements.\n\nIn case of elected Government, the Governor has to act on the aid and\n\nadvice of the Council of Ministers and once an action is approved by the\n\nGovernment i.e. the Council of Ministers, it is deemed to be valid for the\n\npurpose of\nArticle 299\nand thus, there is no infirmity in the execution of the\n\nagreement. Arbitration agreement has been defined under\nSection 7\nof the\n\nArbitration Act and reads as under:-\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 11\n\n\"7. Arbitration agreement\n(1) In this part \"arbitration agreement\" means an\nagreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or\ncertain disputes which have arisen or which may arise\nbetween them in respect of a defined legal relationship,\nwhether contractual or not.\n\n(2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an\narbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate\nagreement.\n\n(3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.\n(4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained\nin-\n\n(a) a document signed by the parties;\n\n(b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means\nof telecommunication which provide a record of the\nagreement; or\n\n(c) an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which\nthe existence of the agreement is alleged by one party and\nnot denied by the other.\n\n(5) The reference in a contract to a document containing an\narbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if\nthe contract is in writing and the reference is such as to\nmake that arbitration clause part of the contract.\"\n\nFrom the reading of the aforesaid Section, it appears that an arrangement to\n\nsubmit to arbitrational all or certain disputes between the parties itself constitutes an\n\narbitration agreement. It may be a Clause or contract or may be a separate agreement\n\nbetween them. The only requirement is that it should be in writing and signed by the\n\nparties. An arbitration agreement can be created even by separate documents. The validity\n\nof the arbitration agreement can be challenged under\nSection 16\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nbefore the Arbiter Tribunal. The appellants did challenge the validity of the arbitration\n\nagreement before the arbiter Tribunal who decided the same during the arbitration\n\nproceedings by order dated 28.1.2005. Otherwise also for the purpose of\nArbitration Act\n,\n\neven if the contract is nullified, it does not affect the validity of the arbitration clause as\n\nis specifically provided under\nSection 16 (b)\nof the Arbitration Act. An order passed by\n\nthe Arbitrator rejecting the plea of the objector regarding the existence or validity of the\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 12\n\narbitration agreement is not appealable under\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration Act. It is only\n\nwhen such a plea is accepted, then an appeal is maintainable. The issue is no more res\n\nintegra.\nIn the case of\nNational Agricultural Coop. Marketing Federation India Ltd.\n\nvs. Gains Trading Ltd.\n, (2007) 5 Supreme Court Cases, 692 while considering the\n\nscope of\nSection 16 (b)\nof the Arbitration Act, Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nobserved as under:-\n\n\"6. Respondent contends that the contract was abrogated\n\nby mutual agreement; and when the contract came to an\n\nend, the arbitration agreement which forms part of the\n\ncontract, also came to an end. Such a contention has\n\nnever been accepted in law. An arbitration clause is a\n\ncollateral term in the contract, which relates to resolution\n\ndisputes, and not performance. Even if the performance\n\nof the contract comes to an end on account of\n\nrepudiation, frustration or breach of contract, the\n\narbitration agreement would survive for the purpose of\n\nresolution of disputes arising under or in connection with\n\nthe contract. [Vide : Heymen vs. Darwins Ltd,\nUnion of\n\nIndia vs. Kishori Lal Gupta & Bros\n.\n\nand\nThe Naihati Jute\n\nMills Ltd. vs. Khyaliram Jagannath\n. This position is now\n\nstatutorily recognized. Sub-section (1) of\nsection 16\nof\n\nthe Act makes it clear that while considering any\n\nobjection with respect to the existence or validity of the\n\narbitration agreement, an arbitration clause which forms\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 13\n\npart of the contract, has to be treated as an agreement\n\nindependent of the other terms of the contract; and a\n\ndecision that the contract is null and void shall not entail\n\nipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. The first\n\ncontention is, therefore, liable to be rejected.\"\n\nIn view of the above legal position, the validity of the arbitration\n\nagreement on any ground is unassailable.\n\nGround No. ii)\n\nIt is admitted case of the parties that Naresh Kumar Sharma, Deputy\n\nDirector (Procurement) was appointed as Abitrator vide order dated\n\n2.7.2004. The Arbitrator entered upon the reference. However, during the\n\npendency of reference, the period for delivery of CMR was extended by\n\nthe Government of India and on that basis, the Arbitrator vide his order\n\ndated 1.10.2004 allowed the Department to withdraw the claim with liberty\n\nto file a fresh one. It is contended on behalf of the appellants that once the\n\nclaims were withdrawn and liberty was granted to file fresh claims,\n\nproceedings before the Arbitrator, namely, Naresh Kumar Sharma only\n\nremained suspended and thus the fresh claims can only be filed before the\n\nsame Arbitrator and the Director was not competent to appoint a new\n\nArbitrator. The relevant part of the order dated 1.10.2004 reads as under:-\n\n\"2.On dated 1.10.2004, I heard both the parties and during\n\narguments, the representative of the claimant admitted the fact\n\nthat the department/government extended the period for\n\ndelivery of the CMR, therefore, they may be allowed to\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 14\n\nwithdraw the claim dated 12.7.2004 at this stage, with liberty\n\nto file fresh. Since the delivery period of CMR was extended\n\nby the Director Food and Supplies, Haryana on dated 13.7.2004\n\nupto 5.9.2004, therefore the claim of the claimant was\n\npremature. According, the claim dated 12.7.2004 is hereby\n\ndismissed as withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh claim.\"\n\nFrom the perusal of the aforesaid order, it is evident that on\n\nwithdrawal of the claims, the proceedings before the appointed Arbitrator\n\nstood terminated, though liberty was granted to file a fresh claim. Obviously\n\nwhen the fresh claims were to be filed, it has to be based upon a new cause\n\nof action i.e. on failure of the millers to deliver CMR within the extended\n\nperiod. It was thus open to the appointing authority to appoint same or a\n\nnew Arbitrator. There is no substance in the contention which is rejected.\n\nGROUND NO. iii)\n\nIt is vehemently argued on behalf of the appellants that millers had\n\nraised counter claims before the Arbitrator, but the same have not been\n\ndecided. I have perused the awards passed by the Arbitrator. In all the\n\nawards, the counter claims have been raised by the millers and reference is\n\nmade in the arbitration award itself wherein it is also mentioned that the\n\ncounter claims are available at pages 165-449 of the record of the\n\nArbitrator. Even while referring to the discussion, reference is made to the\n\ncounter claim to the extent of Rs.63,16,428/- in case of M/s Sain Dass Rice\n\nMill. Similarly, reference is made to the counter claim available at pages\n\n100-131 of the record of the Arbitrator to the extent of Rs.10,89,442 in the\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 15\n\ncase of M/s Bharat Rice Mill, Gamri Road, Kurukshetra and to the\n\ncounter claim available at pages 114-165 of the record of the Arbitrator to\n\nthe extent of Rs.48,65,609.80 in the case of M/s Nagpal Rice Mills, GT\n\nRoad, Umri. From the reading of all the three awards, it appears that the\n\ncounter claims, though made by all the millers/appellants have not been\n\ndecided or even considered. The Arbitrator has not given any finding\n\nwhether the counter claims in each case are sustainable or not. This is\n\nsufficient to vitiate the awards. This is the contention of appellants.\n\nIn the case of\nK.V.George v. The Secretary to Govt. Water and\n\nPower Dept., Trivandrum and another\n, AIR 1990 Supreme Court 53, it\n\nhas been observed as under:-\n\n\"13.is not disputed that the Arbitrator did not at all consider\nthe counter claims and kept the same for consideration\nsubsequently while making award in respect of the claims\nfiled byt he appellant. Undoubtedly, this award made by the\nArbitrator is not sustainable in law and the Arbitrator has mis-\nconducted himself and in the proceedings by making such an\naward. It is the duty of the Arbitrator while considering the\nclaims of the appellant to consider also the counter claims\nmade on behalf of the respondents and to make the award after\nconsidering both the claims and counter claims. This\nhas not been done and the Arbitrator did not at all\nconsider the counter claims of the respondents in making the\naward. As such the first award dated January 22, 1981 made by\nthe Arbitrator in Arbitration Case No.132 of 1980 is wholly\nillegal and unwarranted and the High Court was right in\nholding that the Arbitrator mis-conducted himself and the\nproceedings in making such an award and in setting aside\nthe same and directing the Arbitrator to dispose of the\nreference in accordance with law considering the claim of the\ncontractor and the counter claim of the respondents.\"\n\nMr.Bansal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent\n\nhas, however, argued that the Government is willing to undertake not to\n\nexecute the award to the extent of the counter claims till such time the\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 16\n\ncounter claims are adjudicated upon afresh by the Arbitrator. His further\n\ncontention is that the award can still be upheld leaving the Arbitrator to\n\ndecide the counter claims of the appellants herein. It is contended that since\n\ncounter claims are separable from claims of the respondents, the rest of the\n\nawards is still valid. With a view to support his contention, he has relied\n\nupon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nJ.C.Budhraja v. Chairman, Orissa Mining Corporation Ltd. & Anr., JT\n\n2008 (1) SC 514 wherein following observations have been made:-\n\n\"25. The award of the arbitrator in respect of time\nbarred claim of Rs.67,64,488 is an error apparent on the\nface of the award. Award of amounts in excess of claim\n(referred to in paras 22, 23 and 24) clearly amount to\nexceeding the jurisdiction. All these, that is awarding\namount towards time barred part of the claim of\nRs.67,64,488, and awarding amounts of Rs.29,86,871,\nRs.670,285 and escalation in cost at a rate more than\nwhat is claimed, are all legal misconducts and the award\nin regard to those amounts are null and void. There is\nhowever some overlapping of the aforesaid amounts.\n\n26. Does it mean that the entire award should be set\naside? The answer is no. That part of the award which is\nvalid and separable can be upheld......\"\n\nIn view of the undertaking given before this Court on behalf of the\n\nState that the part of the award to the extent of counter claims will not be\n\nput to execution, the question of adjudication of counter claims and the\n\nvalidity of the award shall be considered here-in-below after other grounds\n\nare examined.\n\nGrounds Nos. iv, v,vi\n\nThe appellants have challenged the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to\n\naward interest as a whole including for the period from 1.3.2003 to\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 17\n\n31.8.2005 when the period for delivery of CMR was extended charging\n\ncompound interest. In the present case, the Arbitrator has awarded interest\n\nat the rate of 11.55%. Clause 9 of the agreement deals with the question of\n\npayment of interest under certain circumstances indicated therein. It is\n\nrelevant to notice the relevant part of the said Clause which reads as under:-\n\n\"9.....The stocks of rice not conforming to the specifications so\n\nlaid down, shall be liable to be rejected in respect of such\n\nquantity of rice which is not found to be within the\n\nspecifications and the miller shall be liable to pay to the\n\nGovernment for the quantity of rice short supplied, as penalty\n\nat the custom milling rate fixed by the Govt. of India plus\n\nReserve Bank of India CCL rate of interest from the date it\n\nbecomes payable till the date of actual realization of converted\n\nvariety of rice. The decision of the Director, Food & Supplies,\n\nHaryana hereinafter referred to as the \"Director\" in this behalf\n\nshall be final.....\n\nIn the event of his failure to supply rice within the\n\nstipulated period he shall be liable for interest @ CCL of\n\nReserve Bank of India prevailing interest for the period of\n\ndefault on the custom milled price fixed by Government of\n\nIndia from the date it becomes payable till the date of actual\n\nrealization towards the left over quantity/stocks of paddy. The\n\ndecision of the Director, Food & Supplies, Haryana (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the \"Director\", in this behalf shall be final.\"\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 18\n\nUnder the aforesaid Clause, interest is payable for short supply of the\n\nrice as also left over quantity of stocks of paddy as may be realizable from\n\nthe miller. The rate of interest is as being charged by the Reserve Bank of\n\nIndia CCL rate and the decision of the Director Food and Supplies, Haryana\n\non the question of interest is final. There is no other clause in the\n\ncontract/agreement which provides for payment of interest. Under this\n\nClause, it is Director who is to take decision regarding the payment of\n\ninterest. The Arbitrator has, however, awarded the interest. It is nobody's\n\ncase that the Director was approached for taking decision on the question\n\nof payment of interest and he has declined the request for interest raising\n\nanother dispute to be adjudicated upon the Arbitrator. Where stipulation in\n\na contract requires a decision to be taken by any specified authority under\n\nthe agreement, the Arbitrator ceases to have the jurisdiction to adjudicate\n\nupon such issues as it does not fall within the domain of the Arbitrator to\n\ntake decision on such issues.\nIn the case of\nRajasthan State Mines and\n\nMinerals Ltd. v. Eastern Engineering Enterprises and another\n, AIR\n\n1999 Supreme Court 3627 wherein it has been observed as under:-\n\n\"20.Despite the admission by the contractor, it is apparent\nthat arbitrator has ignored the aforesaid stipulations in\nthe contract. In the award, the arbitrator has specifically\nmentioned that he has given due weightage to all the\ndocuments placed before him and has also considered the\nadmissibility of each claim. However, while passing the\naward basic and fundamental terms of the agreement between\nthe parties are ignored. By doing so, it is apparent that he has\nexceeded his jurisdiction.\"\n\nIn the case of\nAssociated Engineering Co. v. Government of\n\nAndhra Pradesh and another\n, AIR 1992 Supreme Court 232, it has been\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 19\n\nheld as under:-\n\n\"26.The Arbitrator cannot act arbitrarily irrationally,\ncapriciously or independently of the contract. His sole\nfunction is to arbitrate in terms of the contract. He has no\npower apart from what the parties have given him under\nthe contract. If he has traveled outside the bounds of the\ncontract, he has acted without jurisdiction. But if he has\nremained inside the parameters of the contract and has\nconstrued the provisions of the contract, his award\ncannot be interfered with unless he has given reasons for\nthe award disclosing an error apparent on the face of it.\"\n\nThe law is settled that where the condition of contract confers\n\njurisdiction upon an authority other than the arbitrator to decide an issue\n\nsuch issue can only be decided by such authority and not by the Arbitrator.\n\nThere can be situations where the authority under the agreement\n\nrefuses to decide the issue and dispute in this regard is created, the\n\nArbitrator may in such an eventuality consider the question, subject to the\n\nreference made to it. In the present case, the Arbitrator has simply awarded\n\nthe interest at the asking of the claimants even though the decision was to be\n\ntaken by the Director Food and Supplies, Haryana and he was never\n\napproached by the claimants to decide the question of interest. I am of the\n\nopinion that Arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding the interest\n\nde hors Clause No.9 of the agreement and thus, the award to the extent it\n\ncontains awarding of interest is liable to be set aside.\n\nGround No.vii)\n\nIt has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the agreement for\n\nreference to Arbitrator is violative of\nSection 19 (2)\nof the Indian\n\nPartnership Act, 1932. The said Section, inter-alia, deals with the implied\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 20\n\nauthority of partner as agent of the firm. Sub-Section (2) of\nSection 19\n\nexcludes certain acts of partners from the purview of the implied authority.\n\nHowever, such exclusion is again subject to usage or custom of trade. The\n\nrelevant provisions of\nSection 19\nof the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 read\n\nas under:-\n\n\"19.Implied authority of partner as agent of the firm.-\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of\nSection 22\n, the act of a\n\npartner which is done to carry on, in the usual way,\n\nbusiness of the kind carried on by the firm, binds the\n\nfirm.\n\nXXX XXX XXX\n\n(2) In the absence of any usage or custom of trade to the\n\ncontrary, the implied authority of a partner does not\n\nempower him to--\n\n(a) submit a dispute relating to the business of the firm to\n\narbitration,\n\nXXX XXX XXX\n\nFrom the construction of the aforesaid provisions, it appears that the\n\nimplied authority of partner does not extend for reference to the arbitration.\n\nThis is, however, subject to usage or practice of any trade. In the instant\n\ncase, all agreements with Government have been signed by only one\n\npartner of each firm of Millers. Arbitration Clause is part of the contract\n\nand is inseparable. No other partner has come forward at any stage of\n\ndispute to challenge the authority of the partner who has signed the contract\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 21\n\n(arbitration agreement). This very partner appeared before the Arbitrator,\n\ncontested the case, challenged the awards before the District Judge and filed\n\nthe present appeals. It appears that it is the normal routine, usage and\n\npractice in the trade of milling that one partner enters into contract on\n\nbehalf of the firm. Hence the present case does not fall within the mischief\n\nof Sub Section (2) (a) of\nSection 19\nof the Indian Partnership Act.\n\nGrounds No. viii, ix & x)\n\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellants that Haryana Government\n\nnever made any request for appointment of Arbitrator nor the award has\n\nbeen passed in favour of the Haryana Government. It is further contended\n\nthat the Arbitrator has been appointed without request being made by any of\n\nthe parties to the dispute nor the appellants were heard before appointment\n\nof Arbitrator. From the record produced before me which is said to be part\n\nof the record of the Arbitrator and noticed here-in-above, it appears that the\n\nrequest was made by the District Food and Supplies Controller to the\n\nDirector Food and Supplies for taking action against the three firms named\n\nabove for breach of the contract and causing loss. The said request was\n\naccompanied with the letters and affidavits of the representatives of the\n\nfirms. Each firm had filed an affidavit dated 18.12.2003 that on their failure\n\nto complete the CMR within the extended time, the matter may be taken\n\nbefore the Arbitrator as per agreement clause. Not only this, the\n\nrepresentatives of the firms also undertook to pay the amount. Hence the\n\nargument of the appellants is not acceptable that the arbitrator has been\n\nappointed without any request from either of the parties. It is true that no\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 22\n\nformal notice was issued to the appellants before appointment of the\n\nArbitrator, but fact remains that the appellants appeared before the\n\nArbitrator on being summoned, participated in the proceedings by filing\n\ntheir detailed replies and also led evidence. All their actions were voluntary\n\nand without any reservation. It is only after the passing of the award that all\n\nthese pleas are being raised. As a matter of fact, the appellants are estopped\n\nfrom raising such pleas after the passing of the awards. They objected to\n\nthe arbitration proceedings only by challenging the validity of the\n\nagreement and on no other ground. Thus, their contentions are totally\n\ndevoid of any merit and are rejected.\n\nThere is added reason to disagree with the contention of the\n\nappellants. The respondents in their reply before the Arbitrator virtually\n\nadmitted the breach of the contract and their liability by making a detailed\n\nproposal before the Arbitrator which has been reproduced by the Arbitrator\n\nin the award and reads as under:-\n\n\"The respondent gave the following proposal for\n\nsettlement of the dispute:-\n\ni)That the respondent is ready to pay the amount\n\nwhich would be finally adjudicated by the\n\nArbitrator within a period of 5 years in half yearly\n\nequal instalments.\n\nii)That the respondent in order to secure the\n\ninterest of the respondent will mortgage the Sain\n\nDass Rice Mills, Ladhwa Road, Kurukshetra worth\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 23\n\nRs.2,01,50,300/- as valued by the Valuer against\n\nthe liability of Rs.153 lacs. Even after excluding\n\nthe liability of the value of property being\n\nmortgaged. Relevant document in respect of the\n\nproperty are attached.\n\niii)That the claimant should not charge any future\n\ninterest on the deferred payment. Because of the\n\nreasons as explained in the reply dated 19.1.2005\n\nand the present reply. However, in case of default\n\nin making payment of intalment, then the\n\ndepartment would be entitled to charge interest @\n\n6% till its payment.\n\niv)That in case the respondent make default in\n\nmaking payment of half yearly three instalment\n\ncontinuously then the claimant be fully competent\n\nto take over the mortgaged property and take\n\naction in accordance with law.\n\nv)The payment of first instalment will commence\n\nafter six months from the date of award.\n\nvi)The stock of the rice lying in the Mill be\n\ntransferred in the name of firm so that after giving\n\ntreatment it could be disposed of and loss could be\n\navoided.\"\n\nThough this proposal was not accepted by the claimants, however, the\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 24\n\nfact remains that the appellants therein have by and large admitted their\n\nliability.\n\nIn the totality of the circumstances, these appeals partly succeed. The\n\nawards to the extent of awarding of interest are set aside. In so far as the\n\ncounter claims are concerned, the matter is remitted back to the Arbitrator to\n\nconsider the counter claims of the appellants and take decision thereon in\n\naccordance with law. The awards minus the component of interest are\n\nupheld. However, the awards to the extent of counter claims raised in each\n\ncase shall not be executed till the Arbitrator takes decision on the counter\n\nclaims and executability of the awards in respect to amount equivalent to\n\ncounter claims shall be subject to decision on counter claims. The resultant\n\naward upheld here under shall carry interest at the rate of 12% per annum\n\nfrom the date of the judgment till the amount is actually realized.\n\nDisposed of.\n\nA copy of this judgment be placed on record on each concerned file.\n\n(PERMOD KOHLI)\nJUDGE\n\n14 .7.2009\nMFK\n\nNOTE:Whether to be referred to Reporter or not:YES\n\nFAO NO.4855 OF 2007 25",
