No. 20936 (W) of 2014\n\n Swapan Kumar Sardar & Ors.\n -Versus-\n The State of West Bengal & Ors.\n\n For the petitioners: Mr. Sardar Amjad Ali, Sr. Advocate,\n Ms. Sucharita Roy.\n\n For the KMDA: Mr. Partha Sarathi Bose,\n Mr. Satyajit Talukdar.\n\n For the State: Mr. Tapan Kumar Mukherjee, ld.A.G.P.\n Mr. Somnath Naskar.\n\n Heard on: November 18, 2019.\n\n Judgment on: November 18, 2019.\n\n Rajasekhar Mantha, J.:\n\n \nThe principal challenge in the instant writ petition by the employees of\n\n the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (in short KMDA) is to an order\n\n dated 22nd January, 2014 passed by the KMDA pursuant to a direction of this\n\n Court in W.P. No. 842 of 2011 (\nSwapan Kumar Sardar & Ors. - Vs. - The State of\n\n West Bengal & Ors.\n).\n\n The fact leading to the claims of the writ petitioners is that they were\n\n originally granted a Career Advancement Scheme (CAS), for the purpose of\n\n improving the administration and service benefits to the direct employees of the\n State Government and State controlled bodies. The said Career Advancement\n\nScheme was allowed in or about the year 1995 on the recommendation of the\n\nconcerned Pay Commission not only to the employees of the State Government\n\nbut also to employees of the statutory bodies under it.\n\n Subsequently, when the 4th Pay Commission was implemented in or\n\nabout the year 2002 an improved benefit of a Modified Career Advancement\n\nScheme (MCAS) was allowed exclusively to the State Government employees.\n\n It is submitted by the Counsel for the State that although the Pay\n\nCommission was requested to consider the case of employees of statutory bodies\n\nunder the control of the State Government, the same was declined.\n\n Before proceeding further with this order, it is necessary to explain the\n\ndifference between the original CAS and subsequently introduced MCAS. The\n\nbenefit under the original CAS was in the form of an automatic increment and/or\n\nclimbing on to the next pay scale available to those employees, who were\n\nstagnating in their existing pay scale could not otherwise progress in their careers\n\nin two intervals i.e. after the completion of ten years of service (first\n\nadvancement/jump to the next higher pay scale) and after completion of 20 years\n\n(second advancement).\n\n Pursuant to the recommendation of the 4th Pay Commission, the same\n\nbenefit of career advancement (hereinafter called the Modified Career\n\nAdvancement Scheme) was given to the employees at three stages, i.e., after eight\n\nyears (first movement), after sixteen years (second advancement) and after twenty\n one years (third advancement) of completion of their services. This was in\n\nreplacement of the original Career Advancement Scheme.\n\n It will not be out of place to mention that both the CAS and MCAS were\n\nallowed based on the similar Schemes allowed to the Central Government\n\nemployees.\n\n The arguments of the employees of KMDA are as follows:\n\n (a) There is discrimination on the part of the State in allowing the\n\n benefits of the MCAS to the State Government employees while\n\n denying the same to the employees of statutory bodies under the\n\n State;\n\n (b) A large number of other statutory bodies like Howrah Municipal\n\n Corporation, Shanti Niketan and Sriniketan Development Authority,\n\n Haldia Development Authority and West Bengal Pollution Control\n\n Board etc., have been allowed such benefits. These two of such\n\n organizations are similarly situated as the KMDA and therefore there\n\n is a class between the class and or class legislation created by the\n\n State.\n\n (c) There is apparent contradictions and mindless fallacy in the\n\n impugned order where the Principal Secretary, Urban Development\n\n Department, Government of West Bengal and the Principal Secretary,\n\n Finance Department, Government of West Bengal on one hand said\n\n that they could not grant the MCAS to the KMDA employees in view of\n\n the bar under the 4th Pay Commission but in the same breath\n contended that if the funds of the KMDA permitted such benefits, the\n\n same could be availed by the employees of KMDA.\n\n KMDA similar to the Haldia Development Authority and the Shanti\n\nNiketan and Sriniketan Development Authority are constituted and function\n\nunder the provisions of the \"\nWest Bengal Town and Country (Planning and\n\nDevelopment) Act, 1979\n\". \nSection 19\n of the said Act stipulates that the following\n\npersons shall comprise of the governing body of the KMDA -\n\n \"19. Composition of the 1[Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\n Authority\n (1) The 1[Kolkata] Metropolitan Development Authority shall\n consist of the following members:--\n\n (a) the Chief Minister of the State of West Bengal or any\n person nominated by him shall be the Chairman, and a\n Minister of the State of West Bengal to be nominated by the\n Chief Minister shall be the Vice-Chairman:\n\n Provided that when there is no Council of Ministers\n functioning in the State of West Bengal, the State\n Government shall nominate such persons, as it may think\n fit, to be the two members and the Chairman and Vice-\n Chairman respectively of the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan\n Development Authority;\n\n (b) the Chief Executive Officer of the 1[Kolkata] Metropolitan\n Development Authority, ex officio;\n\n (c) not more than three officers of the rank of Secretary to the\n State Government to be nominated by the State Government;\n and 2\n\n (d) not more than five persons to be nominated by the State\n Government of whom--\n\n (i) two shall be Councillors or Aldermen of the 1[Kolkata]\n Municipal Corporation;\n\n (ii) one shall be a Councillor or Alderman of the Howrah\n Municipal Corporation;\n\n (iii) two shall be Commissioners of any municipality within\n the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Area:\n\n Provided that when an order of supersession of the 1\n [Kolkata] Municipal Corporation or the Howrah Municipal\n Corporation or the municipality, as the case may be, has\n been made and is in force, it shall be competent for the State\n Government to nominate, in place of the Councillors or\n Aldermen or Commissioners, as the case may be, such\n persons as have experience in or knowledge of\n administration of local self-government to be members of the\n 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development Authority:\n\n Provided further that on the revocation of the order of\n supersession as aforesaid, the members nominated under\n the first proviso shall, notwithstanding that the term of office\n of such members has not expired, cease to hold office and\n the vacancies shall be filled up in accordance with the\n provisions of clause (d).\n\n (2) The Vice-Chairman shall discharge such functions and\n exercise such powers as may be delegated to him by the\n Chairman and shall, during the absence of the Chairman,\n perform the functions and exercise the powers of the\n Chairman.\n\n (3) The members referred to in clause (d) of sub-section (1)\n shall hold office for a term of three years from the date of\n their nomination by the State Government and shall receive\n such allowances for attending the meetings of the 1 [Kolkata]\n Metropolitan Development Authority or any committee\n thereof, as may be prescribed: 3\n [Provided that every such member, on ceasing to be a\n Councillor or Alderman of the 1 [Kolkata] Municipal\n Corporation or the Howrah Municipal Corporation or\n Commissioner of a municipality within the 1 [Kolkata]\n Metropolitan Area, as the case may be, shall,\n notwithstanding that the term of office of such member has\n not expired, cease to hold office and the vacancy shall be\n filled up in accordance with the provisions of clause (d) of\n sub-section (1).]\n (4) No act or proceeding of the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan\n Development Authority shall be deemed to be invalid merely\n by reason of any vacancy in, or defect, initial or subsequent,\n in the constitution of that Authority\"\n\n The finance, accounts and audit of the KMDA are required to be governed\n\nby \nSections 107\n to \n114\n of the aforesaid Act of 1979. \nSection 107\n, \n108\n & \n109\n\nstipulates as follows:\n\n \"107. (1) Every Planning Authority or Development Authority\n (other than the [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\n Authority) shall have and maintain its own fund to which\nshall be credited-\n\n (a) all moneys received by the said Authority from the\nState Government by way of grants, loans, advances or\notherwise;\n\n (b) all development charges or other charges or fees\nreceived by the said Authority under this Act or rules or\nregulations made thereunder : and\n\n (c) all moneys received by the said Authority from any\nother source.\n\n(2) Every such Authority may keep in current account in any\nbranch of the State Bank of India or any other Bank\napproved by the State Government in this behalf, such\nportion of its fund as may be prescribed and any money in\nexcess of the said sum shall be invested in such manner as\nmay be approved by the State Government.\n\n108. Fund of the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\nAuthority\n (1) There shall be a fund for the 1[Kolkata]\nMetropolitan Development Authority to which shall be\ncredited--\n\n (a) such moneys as may be paid to it by the State\nGovernment under the Taxes on Entry of Goods into 1\n[Kolkata] Metropolitan Area Act, 1972;\n\n (b) all moneys borrowed by it;\n\n (c) such other moneys as may be received by it from\nthe State Government or from any other authority or source.\n\n (2) The 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development Authority\nshall maintain a sinking fund for the repayment of money\nborrowed by it, and shall every year deposit into the said\nfund such moneys as may be paid to it by the State\nGovernment under the Taxes on Entry of Goods into 1\n[Kolkata] Metropolitan Area Act, 1972.\n\n (3) The money paid into the sinking fund shall be\ninvested in such manner and in such securities as may be\nprescribed.\n\n (4) The sinking fund or any part thereof shall be\napplied in, or towards, the discharge of the loan or part\nthereof for which such fund was created, and until such loan\nor part thereof is wholly discharged, the money standing to\nthe credit of the fund shall be applied for no other purpose.\n\n109 - Grants and advances by State Government\nThe State Government may make such grants, advances and\nloans to any Planning Authority or Development Authority\n (including the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\n Authority) as it may deem necessary for the performance of\n the functions under this Act and all such grants, loans and\n advances made shall be on such terms and conditions as the\n State Government may determine.\"\n\n The sources of fund of KMDA are set out in \nSection 108\n. In addition\n\nthereto, \nSection 109\n of the Act of 1979 stipulates that the State Government\n\nmay make such grants and advances and loans to any planning authority or\n\ndevelopment authority including the KMDA as it may deem necessary for the\n\nperformance of the functions under the Act. It is further stipulated that all such\n\ngrants, loans and advances made, shall be on such terms and conditions as the\n\nState Government may determined.\n\n To address the first argument raised on behalf of the petitioners that\n\nthere is discrimination between the facilities granted to the direct employees of\n\nthe State Government and those employees of statutory bodies, it is now well\n\nsettled that the same do not stand on the similar footing. Employees of statutory\n\nbodies are governed not only by the act under which they are constituted but\n\nalso have independent bye-laws, Rules and Regulations not only governing their\n\nfunctions but also the terms and conditions of the service of their employees.\n\n The first argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners, therefore, has\n\nto be answered in negative.\n\n The second argument raised is that the employees of the some\n\ndevelopment authorities similarly situated like KMDA is also governed under the\n\naforesaid Act of 1979 yet have been granted such benefits and the employees of\n\nKMDA have been denied the benefits of MCAS.\n\n The impugned order addresses this issue by first contending that such\n\nauthorities and other organizations like Haldia Development Authority, West\n\nBengal Pollution Control Board and Howrah Improvement Trust and West\n\nBengal Housing Board have granted the benefits of MCAS since they have funds\n\nof their own in this regard and the KMDA does not.\n\n \nArticle 14\n permits reasonable classification but does not permit class\n\nlegislation. The equal protection of laws guaranteed by \nArticle 14\n does not mean\n\nthat all laws must be general in character. It does not mean that the same laws\n\nshould apply to all persons. It does not attainment or circumstances in the same\n\nposition. The varying needs of different classes of persons often requires\n\nseparate treatment. From the very nature of society there should be different\n\nlaws in different places and the legitimate controls the policy and enacts laws in\n\nthe best interest of the safety and security of the state. In fact identical\n\ntreatment in unequal circumstances would amount to inequality. So a\n\nreasonable classification is only not permitted but is necessary if society is to\n\nprogress.\n\n Thus what \nArticle 14\n forbids is class-legislation but it does not forbid\n\nreasonable classification. The classification however must not be \"arbitrary\n\n,artificial or evasive\" but must be based on some real and substantial bearing a\n\njust and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the\n\nlegislation. \nArticle 14\n applies where equals are treated differently without any\n\nreasonable basis. But where equals and unequals are treated differently, \nArticle\n\n14\n does not apply. Class legislation is that which makes an improper\n discrimination by conferring particular privileges upon a class of persons\n\narbitrarily selected from a large number of persons all of whom stand in the\n\nsame relation to the privilege granted that between whom and the persons not so\n\nfavored no reasonable distinction or substantial difference can be found\n\njustifying the inclusion of one and the exclusion of the other from such privilege.\n\nReference may be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the following\n\ncases.\n\n \nIn the case of \nD.S. Nakara v. Union Of India\n reported in 1983 AIR 130,\n\n1983 SCR (2) 165, the Supreme Court contended as follows:\n\n \"The Government issued an office memorandum announcing a\n liberalized pension scheme for retired government servants but\n made it applicable to those who had retired after 31 March 1979.\n The Supreme Court held that the fixing of the cut off date to be\n discriminatory as violating \nArticle 14.\n The division of pensioners\n into two classes on the basis of the date of retirement was not\n based on any rational principle because a difference of two days in\n the matter of retirement could have a traumatic effect on the\n pensioner. Such a classification held to be arbitrary and\n unprincipled as there was no acceptable or persuasive reason in its\n favour. The said classification had no rational nexus with the\n object sought to achieve.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nMadhu Limaye v. Supdt. Tihar Jail Delhi\n, reported in\n\n1975 AIR 1505, 1975 SCR (3) 582, the Supreme Court contended as follows:\n\n \"There were Indian and Europian Prisoners. Both were treated\n differently. Europian gets better diet. Court held that difference\n between Indian and Europian prisoners in the matter of treatment\n and diet violates right to equality under \nArticle 14\n of Indian\n prisoners. They all are prisoners they must treat equally.\"\n\n It was also contended that no prior permission of the State Government\n\nwas taken before extending such benefit in view of the denial of MCAS to non\n\nState Government employees under the 4th Pay Commission.\n\n While the argument has made in the impugned order by two responsible\n\nPrincipal Secretaries of State Government, who are the Senior IAS Officers,\n\nappears to be ex facie contradictory and self-defeating, Counsel for the State\n\nwould rely upon the fact that merely because an error is committed in the case\n\nof certain bodies, this similar erroneous benefit cannot be derived by the\n\nemployees of the KMDA.\n\n This Court refers to the doctrine of negative equality evolved in the\n\nfollowing cases.\n\n \nIn the case of \nUnion of India v. International Trading Co.\n, reported in\n\n (2003) 5 SCC 437 at page 444, Para 13, the Supreme Court held as\n\n follows:\n\n \"13. What remains now to be considered, is the effect of\n permission granted to the thirty two vessels. As highlighted by\n learned counsel for the appellants, even if it is accepted that there\n was any improper permission, that may render such permissions\n vulnerable so far as the thirty two vessels are concerned, but it\n cannot come to the aid of the respondents. It is not necessary to\n deal with that aspect because two wrongs do not make one right. A\n party cannot claim that since something wrong has been done in\n another case direction should be given for doing another wrong. It\n would not be setting a wrong right, but would be perpetuating\n another wrong. In such matters there is no discrimination involved.\n The concept of equal treatment on the logic of \nArticle 14\n of the\n Constitution of India (in short \"the Constitution\") cannot be\n pressed into service in such cases. What the concept of equal\n treatment presupposes is existence of similar legal foothold. It does\n not countenance repetition of a wrong action to bring both wrongs\n on a par. Even if hypothetically it is accepted that a wrong has\n been committed in some other cases by introducing a concept of\n negative equality the respondents cannot strengthen their case.\n They have to establish strength of their case on some other basis\n and not by claiming negative equality.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n In the case of M/S Vedanta Aluminium Limited vs Union of India\n\n (RVWPET No.218 of 2011) at Paragraph 17, the Orissa High Court held\n\n as follows:\n\n \"17. Even assuming for the sake of argument that any benefit was\n extended to a similarly situated Company, namely, Jindal Power\n Limited under the Office Memorandum dated 16.11.2010, the\n petitioner has no legal right to claim similar benefit for the reason\n that there is no concept of negative equality.\n\n A party cannot claim that if something wrong has been done in any\n case, similar direction should be given for doing the wrong again.\n No illegality should be allowed to perpetuate under the shelter\n of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. \nArticle 14\n does not envisage\n for negative equality, and no one can be permitted to take benefit\n of negative equality.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n It is now well settled that the negative equality is not permitted under\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India. The doctrine of negative equality has\n\nalready explained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the above cited\n\ncases is that no body can claim benefit from a wrongful gain made by similarly\n\nsituated persons.\n\n While this Court may have sympathy for the writ petitioners in this\n\nregard, the conduct of the State Government in failing to monitor the activities\n\nand functions of those other statutory bodies cannot be but deprecated. It is\n\nexpected that remedial measures shall be taken by the State in respect of the\n Statutory bodies. This Court is not free from doubt that they are more favorite\n\nstatutory body/employees in the State than the employees of the KMDA\n\n The only argument advanced on behalf of the State that needs to be dealt\n\nwith by this Court is in terms of \nSection 139\n of the aforesaid 1972 Act. \nSection\n\n139\n of the aforesaid Act of 1979 stipulates as follows:\n\n \"\nSection 139\n - Power to make regulations\n Any Planning Authority or Development Authority may, with the\n previous approval of the State Government, make regulations\n consistent with this Act and the rules made thereunder, to\n carry out the purposes of this Act and without prejudice to the\n generality of this power such regulations may provide for,--\n\n (a) the time and place of holding and procedure to be followed\n in meetings of the Planning Authority, Development Authority\n and Advisory Committee, and the number of members\n necessary to form a quorum therein;\n\n (b) the powers and duties of the officers and employees of the\n Planning Authority and Development Authority;\n\n (c) the salaries, allowances and conditions of service of its\n officers and employees;\n\n (d) the terms and conditions for the continuance of use of any\n land used otherwise than in conformity with a development\n plan; and\n\n (e) any other matter which has to be or may be prescribed by\n rules.\"\n\n Sub-Section (C) of \nSection 139\n clearly indicates that the power to frame\n\nregulations for the purpose of governing the salaries, allowances and conditions\n\nof service of its officers and employees is vested in the KMDA but the same has to\n\nbe made in consultation with the State Government.\n\n Mr. Ali, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the writ petitioners, relies\n\nupon \nSection 29\n by saying that when the State Government is already in majority\n\nin the governing body of KMDA the consent of the State Government is to an idle\n\nformality and that once the Board of KMDA passes a salary that is empowered to\n frame regulation governing the salaries and emoluments to its employee, and if\n\nthe same including the MCAS such regulations and/or rules must have deemed\n\napproval of the State Government.\n\n This Court seizes some force in such argument but is reminded of the\n\nwell settled principle that there is no estoppel against the law. The aforesaid\n\nprinciple applies not only in the context of \nSection 139(6)\n read with \nSection 29\n of\n\nthe aforesaid 1972 Act but also in the context of the denial by the 4th Pay\n\nCommission Authorities of MCAS to the persons similarly placed like the\n\npetitioner, i.e., employees of the statutory bodies albeit under the control of the\n\nState Government.\n\n The following Supreme Court ruling resonate the principle of \"no estoppel\n\nagainst the law\":\n\n \nIn the case of \nDunlop India Ltd vs Union Of India And Ors\n, reported in\n\n1977 AIR 597, 1976 SCR (2) 98, the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n \"At one stage Mr. Sanghi pointed out that in certain Bills of Entry\n of Dunlop India Limited, their Agents, Messrs Mackinnon.\n Mackenzie & Co., Private Ltd., gave the I.T.C. item No. 87 with\n regard to the imported V.P. Latex. This according to Mr. Sanghi\n clearly shows how the appellants themselves have understood the\n matter. There is, however, no estoppel in law against a party in a\n taxation matter. In order to clear the goods for the customs, the\n appellants' Agents may have given the classification in accordance\n with the wishes of the authorities or they may even be under some\n misapprehension. But when law allows them the right to ask for\n refund on a proper appraisement and which they actually applied\n for, we do not attach any significance to this aspect of the matter\n pointed out by counsel. The question is of General importance and\n must be decided on its merits.\"\n\n \n(emphasis added)\n In the case of \nJalandhar Improvement Trust vs Sampuran\n\nSingh\n, reported in 1347, JT 1999 (2) SC 598, (1999) 122 PLR 295,\n\n1999 (2) SCALE 415, (1999) 3 SCC 494, the Supreme Court held as\n\nfollows:\n\n \"13. The High Court as well as the lower appellate court also relied\n upon the fact that the Trust had made similar preferential\n allotments as local displaced person in favour of other persons.\n Therefore, the courts below came to the conclusion that even the\n plaintiffs-respondents were entitled to such allotment. In our\n opinion, before coming to this conclusion the courts below should\n have first decided the question whether the allotment in favour of\n those persons was within the scope of the Rules applicable. If it\n was not within the scope of the Rules then even those allotments in\n favour of other persons will not create a right in the respondents to\n claim equality with them; may be, if the allotments were made\n wrongly in favour of those persons, the same may become liable for\n cancellation, if permissible in law, but that will not create an\n enforceable right on the respondents to claim similar wrongful\n allotments in their favour. In our opinion, even this ground relied\n upon by the High Court as well as the lower appellate court is\n unsustainable. The courts below next relied upon the fact that in\n regard to some of the respondents, the Trust itself at a point of\n time made allotments and accepted initial deposits towards the\n consideration of the plot which was subsequently cancelled. Based\n on those facts, the courts below held that the Trust having once\n allotted the plots and having collected part of the consideration, it\n could not have cancelled the allotments, probably basing the\n respondents' case on the principle of promissory estoppel. Here the\n courts below have failed to notice the legal principle that there is\n no estoppel against law. The allotment of plots by the Trust is\n controlled by the statutory Rules. Any allotment contrary to those\n Rules will be against the law. Since the allotments made in favour\n of some of the respondents was based on wrong application of the\n reservation made for \"local displaced person\" those allotments were\n contrary to law. Hence, the principle of\n promissory/equitable estoppel cannot be invoked to protect such\n illegal allotments. In the said view of the matter, we are unable to\n sustain the judgments and decrees impugned in these appeals.\"\n\n \n(emphasis added)\n In the case of \nBennett Coleman & Co. (P) Ltd vs Punya Priya Das\n\nGupta\n, reported in 1970 AIR 426, 1970 SCR (1) 181, the Supreme\n\nCourt held as follows:\n\n \"The respondent thereafter applied to the Delhi Administration and\n the latter, as aforesaid, referred his claim to the Labour Court for\n adjudication. In his statement of claim before the Labour Court, the\n respondent claimed that the monthly wages payable to him were Rs.\n 700 basic, Rs. 497 as dearness allowance, Rs. 200 conveyance\n allowance and Rs. 50 being the estimated value of the benefit of a\n free telephone and newspapers, aggregating Rs. 1,447 per month.\n He claimed gratuity computable on the basis of Rs. 1,447 as being\n his monthly wages, Rs. 1,447 as compensation for the month's\n leave, in all, Rs. 6,000.34 P. He did not deduct from the said claim\n the said amount of Rs. 2,810.47 P. as he had not encashed the\n cheque given to him against the receipt dated November 21, 1963.\n The company in its written statement denied the claim relying on the\n said receipt and further denied that the car allowance and the\n monetary value for the free telephone and newspapers could be\n included in the wages payable to the respondent either as due to\n him or for calculating gratuity. Before the Labour Court the\n company did not dispute the value of the benefit of the free\n telephone and newspapers estimated by the respondent, but it\n raised the question whether the said value and the car allowance\n formed part of the respondent's wages and whether the amount of\n gratuity payable to him could be ascertained on the footing of their\n being part of his wages. The Labour Court held that there was no\n evidence that the car allowance was not payable to the respondent\n while he was on leave as was the case in respect of another working\n journalist, C. V. Vishwanath, whose claim also the Labour Court\n was trying along with that of the respondent. The Labour Court\n found this difference a significant one and held that the car\n allowance had to be taken as part of the wages. The Labour Court\n also held that the car allowance and the free telephone and\n newspapers were an allowance and an amenity respectively falling\n under the definition L 12 Sup CI/69-13 of\n s. 2 (rr)\n of the Industrial\n Disputes Act, 1947, both forming the component parts of monthly\n wages payable to the respondent,. As regards the leave, the\n respondent was undoubtedly entitled to 30 days leave. But the\n company's plea was, firstly, that its rules did not permit\n compensation for such leave and secondly, that it was set off against\n the period of notice which the respondent was required to give. No\n rules, however, were produced to show that they contained any\n provision disallowing such compensation. As regards the notice\n period of one month, the Labour Court held that as the resignation\n dated October 8, 1963 was accepted with effect from October 21,\n 1963 there was compliance of 13 days only and therefore the\n management was not liable to pay for the balance of 17 days leave.\n The Labour Court rejected the company's plea that the receipt given\n by the respondent in full settlement of all his claims estopped him\n from making these claims on the ground that as these items were\n claimable under the Act there could be no estoppel against law. In\n the result, the Labour Court held that the respondent was entitled to\n claim car allowance at Rs. 200 per month, Rs. 50 per month for\n telephone and news- papers and compensation for 13 days leave,\n that the first two were parts of his wages, that his monthly\n remuneration was, therefore, Rs. 1,447 and gratuity equivalent to 51\n months wages would have to be calculated on the basis of Rs. 1,447\n being his wages per month and directed the company to pay on the\n aforesaid calculations Rs. 2,002 over and above Rs. 2,810.47 P. for\n which the company had issued the said cheque.\"\n\n \n(emphasis added)\n\n In the case of \nC. Beepathumma And Ors. vs V.S.\n\nKadambolithaya And Ors.\n, reported in AIR 1965 SC 241, 1964 5 SCR\n\n836, the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n \n\"18. Mr. S. T. Desai learned counsel for the appellants admits that\n the mortgagors had not lost their right to the properties comprised\n in Ex. P-2 and that Ex. P-2 incorporated Ex. P-1. Exs. P-63 and P-\n 63(a) were filed to establish the connection which, in view of the\n admission, it is not necessary to set forth here. He also admits that\n he cannot make out case under \nArt. 134\n of the \nIndian Limitation\n Act\n. He contends that the doctrine of election is but a species of\n estoppel and there can be no estoppel against law especially\n against the \nLimitation Act\n, because of\n s. 3\n of that Act. He relies\n upon a decision of the Madras High Court reported in \nSitarama\n Chetty and Anr. v. Krishnaswami Chetty\n [(1915) I.L.R. Mad., 38,\n\n \n374.] where White C.J. quoting a passage from Mr. Mitra's book on\n the Law of Limitation, observes that an agreement by a person\n against whom a cause of action has arisen, that he would not take\n advantage of the statute, cannot affect its operation on the original\n cause of action, unless such agreement amounts to an\n acknowledgment of liability which the statute recognises as an\n exception to the rule. Mr. Desai also relies upon \nGovardhan Das v.\n Dau Dayal\n [(1932) I.L.R. 54 All. 573.] for the proposition that no\n one can contract himself out of the statute of limitation, nor can\n estoppel be pleaded against a statutory bar of limitation. Some\n other cases cited by him are not in point and need not be\n mentioned. On the basis of these cases, Mr. Desai contends that\n unless Exs. P-2 and P-2(a) can be pleaded as an acknowledgment\n limitation cannot be saved in respect of Kunhi Pakki's share and\n the suit itself must be dismissed under\n s. 3\n of the Limitation Act.\n He contends that the equitable doctrine of election does not apply\n to the present case, because the documents on which reliance is\n placed refer not to the 1/4th share of Kunhi Pakki but to the\n 3/16th share of Cheriamma which Kunhi Pakki subsequently\n obtained. He states that the latter conclusion is inescapable if Exs.\n P-59, P-60 and P-61 are read together. He submits that in these\n documents Kunhi Pakki no doubt connected the 3/16th share with\n Exs. P-2 and P-2(a) but treated his own 1/4th share separately.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nState Of Rajasthan And Anr vs Surendra Mohnot\n\nAnd Ors\n (Civil Appeal Nos. 5860-5861 of 2014) reported in (2014) 14\n\nSCC 77 at Paragraph 17 the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n \"17. It is well settled in law that there can be\n no estoppel against law. Consent given in a court that a\n controversy is covered by a judgment which has no applicability\n whatsoever and pertains to a different field, cannot estopp the\n party from raising the point that the same was erroneously\n cited.\"\n\n \n(emphasis added)\n\n In the case of \nRajendra Jha vs Presiding Officer, Labour\n Court,\n\n reported in 1984 AIR 1696, 1985 SCR (1) 544, the Supreme Court held\n\n as follows:\n\n \"In order to get over these difficulties, it is urged by the appellant\n that there can be no estoppel against law and therefore, it is open\n to him to argue even at this stage that the Labour Court ought not\n to have passed the particular order. In support of this contention\n reliance is placed by the appellant on two judgments of this Court.\n\n \nIn \nChitturi Subbanna v. Kudapapa Subbanna\n, it was held by the\n majority that pure questions of law, not dependent on the\n determination of any questions of fact, should be allowed to be\n raised for the first time even at later stages of a litigation.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n It is, however, made clear that in the event the petitioners or the KMDA\n\nAuthorities duly represented by the State Government, approach the next\n\navailable Pay Commission for granting of MCAS benefits to employees of\n\nstatutory corporation and other authorities similarly situated like the petitioners,\n\nthe MCAS Authorities will do so in accordance with law and bearing in mind the\n\nprinciples enshrined in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n In view of the aforesaid, this Court is unable to grant any benefit to the\n\npetitioners and hence the writ petition does not succeed and is disposed of\n\nwithout any order.\n\n There will be, however, no order as to costs.\n\n Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the\n\nparties upon compliance of all formalities.\n\n (Rajasekhar Mantha, J.)",

The High Court as well as the lower appellate court also relied\n upon the fact that the Trust had made similar preferential\n allotments as local displaced person in favour of other persons.\n Therefore, the courts below came to the conclusion that even the\n plaintiffs-respondents were entitled to such allotment. In our\n opinion, before coming to this conclusion the courts below should\n have first decided the question whether the allotment in favour of\n those persons was within the scope of the Rules applicable. If it\n was not within the scope of the Rules then even those allotments in\n favour of other persons will not create a right in the respondents to\n claim equality with them; may be, if the allotments were made\n wrongly in favour of those persons, the same may become liable for\n cancellation, if permissible in law, but that will not create an\n enforceable right on the respondents to claim similar wrongful\n allotments in their favour. In our opinion, even this ground relied\n upon by the High Court as well as the lower appellate court is\n unsustainable. The courts below next relied upon the fact that in\n regard to some of the respondents, the Trust itself at a point of\n time made allotments and accepted initial deposits towards the\n consideration of the plot which was subsequently cancelled. Based\n on those facts, the courts below held that the Trust having once\n allotted the plots and having collected part of the consideration, it\n could not have cancelled the allotments, probably basing the\n respondents' case on the principle of promissory estoppel. Here the\n courts below have failed to notice the legal principle that there is\n no estoppel against law. The allotment of plots by the Trust is\n controlled by the statutory Rules. Any allotment contrary to those\n Rules will be against the law. Since the allotments made in favour\n of some of the respondents was based on wrong application of the\n reservation made for \"local displaced person\" those allotments were\n contrary to law. Hence, the principle of\n promissory/equitable estoppel cannot be invoked to protect such\n illegal allotments. In the said view of the matter, we are unable to\n sustain the judgments and decrees impugned in these appeals.\""

In his statement of claim before the Labour Court, the\n respondent claimed that the monthly wages payable to him were Rs.\n 700 basic, Rs. 497 as dearness allowance, Rs. 200 conveyance\n allowance and Rs. 50 being the estimated value of the benefit of a\n free telephone and newspapers, aggregating Rs. 1,447 per month.\n He claimed gratuity computable on the basis of Rs. 1,447 as being\n his monthly wages, Rs. 1,447 as compensation for the month's\n leave, in all, Rs. 6,000.34 P. He did not deduct from the said claim\n the said amount of Rs. 2,810.47 P. as he had not encashed the\n cheque given to him against the receipt dated November 21, 1963.\n The company in its written statement denied the claim relying on the\n said receipt and further denied that the car allowance and the\n monetary value for the free telephone and newspapers could be\n included in the wages payable to the respondent either as due to\n him or for calculating gratuity. Before the Labour Court the\n company did not dispute the value of the benefit of the free\n telephone and newspapers estimated by the respondent, but it\n raised the question whether the said value and the car allowance\n formed part of the respondent's wages and whether the amount of\n gratuity payable to him could be ascertained on the footing of their\n being part of his wages. The Labour Court held that there was no\n evidence that the car allowance was not payable to the respondent\n while he was on leave as was the case in respect of another working\n journalist, C. V. Vishwanath, whose claim also the Labour Court\n was trying along with that of the respondent. The Labour Court\n found this difference a significant one and held that the car\n allowance had to be taken as part of the wages. The Labour Court\n also held that the car allowance and the free telephone and\n newspapers were an allowance and an amenity respectively falling\n under the definition L 12 Sup CI/69-13 of\n s. 2 (rr)\n of the Industrial\n Disputes Act, 1947, both forming the component parts of monthly\n wages payable to the respondent,. As regards the leave, the\n respondent was undoubtedly entitled to 30 days leave. But the\n company's plea was, firstly, that its rules did not permit\n compensation for such leave and secondly, that it was set off against\n the period of notice which the respondent was required to give. No\n rules, however, were produced to show that they contained any\n provision disallowing such compensation. As regards the notice\n period of one month, the Labour Court held that as the resignation\n dated October 8, 1963 was accepted with effect from October 21,\n 1963 there was compliance of 13 days only and therefore the\n management was not liable to pay for the balance of 17 days leave.\n The Labour Court rejected the company's plea that the receipt given\n by the respondent in full settlement of all his claims estopped him\n from making these claims on the ground that as these items were\n claimable under the Act there could be no estoppel against law. In\n the result, the Labour Court held that the respondent was entitled to\n claim car allowance at Rs. 200 per month, Rs. 50 per month for\n telephone and news- papers and compensation for 13 days leave,\n that the first two were parts of his wages, that his monthly\n remuneration was, therefore, Rs. 1,447 and gratuity equivalent to 51\n months wages would have to be calculated on the basis of Rs. 1,447\n being his wages per month and directed the company to pay on the\n aforesaid calculations Rs. 2,002 over and above Rs. 2,810.47 P. for\n which the company had issued the said cheque.\""

Mr. Desai also relies upon \nGovardhan Das v.\n Dau Dayal\n [(1932) I.L.R. 54 All. 573.] for the proposition that no\n one can contract himself out of the statute of limitation, nor can\n estoppel be pleaded against a statutory bar of limitation. Some\n other cases cited by him are not in point and need not be\n mentioned. On the basis of these cases, Mr. Desai contends that\n unless Exs. P-2 and P-2(a) can be pleaded as an acknowledgment\n limitation cannot be saved in respect of Kunhi Pakki's share and\n the suit itself must be dismissed under\n s. 3\n of the Limitation Act.\n He contends that the equitable doctrine of election does not apply\n to the present case, because the documents on which reliance is\n placed refer not to the 1/4th share of Kunhi Pakki but to the\n 3/16th share of Cheriamma which Kunhi Pakki subsequently\n obtained. He states that the latter conclusion is inescapable if Exs.\n P-59, P-60 and P-61 are read together. He submits that in these\n documents Kunhi Pakki no doubt connected the 3/16th share with\n Exs. P-2 and P-2(a) but treated his own 1/4th share separately.\""
