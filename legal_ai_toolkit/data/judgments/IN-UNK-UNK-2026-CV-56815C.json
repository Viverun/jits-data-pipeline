Lakshmanan, J.\n\nDelay condoned.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nThese appeals were filed against the final judgment and \norder dated 12.4.2004 passed by the High Court of Judicature \nat Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow in Writ Petition No. \n366(S/B) of 2002 whereby the High Court allowed the writ \npetition filed by Shri C.B. Chhimwal, respondent No.5 herein \nin S.L.P.(c) No. 7375 of 2005 and against the final judgment \nand order dated 26.11.2001 in W.P.(C) No. 610(S/B) of 1996 \nwhereby the High Court allowed the writ petition filed by Shri \nSuresh Chandra Sharma and Shri Vijay Kumar Mishra, \nrespondent Nos. 5 & 6 herein in S.L.P.(c) No. 1860/2006. \nThe appellants in these matters are direct recruits to the \npost of Forest Rangers in the State of U.P, now Uttaranchal. \nThe respondents are the State of U.P, State of Uttarnchal and \nOrs.\n\nThe brief facts are as follows:\n\nIn the state of U.P, during the period 1969-1979, there \nwas no direct appointment to the post of Forest Rangers. The \nGovernment kept promoting Deputy Forest Rangers on ad hoc \nbasis to the post of Forest Rangers if any vacancy arose.\nOn 30.11.1989, by a Government Resolution, 124 \npersons who were promoted on ad hoc basis to the post of \nForest Rangers were regularized in 1972 -1979. However, as of \n30.11.1989, there were not enough vacancies in the promotee \nquota to accommodate all the regularized Forest Rangers. \n\nHence, some of the regularized 124 Forest Rangers were \npushed down and accommodated in 1990 and 1991. By the \nyear 1991, all the 124 regularised Forest Rangers were \naccommodated. In 1991, there was only one vacancy in the \npromotee quota. \n\nLater in 1989-1990, the members of the appellants \nAssociation were appointed in the year 1990 as Forest Rangers \non the basis of competitive exam held by the U.P. Public \nService Commission in 1989. They were substantively \nappointed on the post of Forest Rangers by direct recruitment \non various dates in 1990 e.g. the President of the Appellants \nAssociation was appointed on 01.03.1990. Appellant No.3 was \nappointed on 01.11.1990. The appointments were within the \ndirect recruitment quota.\n\nOn 30.01.1991, without realizing that there was no \nvacancy in the promotee quota of Forest Rangers the State of \nU.P. sent a requisition to the Public Service Commission to \nrecommend 410 persons for promotion to the post of Deputy \nForest Rangers. This mistake has been admitted by the State \nof U.P. in their counter affidavit before the High Court as also \nin this Court.\n\nOn 06.07.1991, the State PSC vide its letter dated \n06.07.1991 sent the names of Forest Rangers as if there were \nvacancies from the period 1979 to 1989 in the promotee \nquota. The UPPSC allotted the officers on the basis of the \nselection year. Needless to mention there is no provision in the \nService Rules for allocation on the basis of year of selection. In \nany event, there were no vacancies and, therefore, the basis of \nthis recommendation was incorrect.\n\nOn the basis of this recommendation on 17.07.1991, 356 \nDeputy Forest Rangers were promoted to the post of Forest \nRangers 'from the date of taking charge'. They were not given \nany back-dated promotion. The respondents have not \nchallenged their promotion order which promoted them w.e.f. \nthe day they took charge.\n\nOn 31.05.1996, when the State of U.P. was preparing the \nseniority list of Forest Rangers, it went strictly by the Seniority \nRules. Since the appellants were substantively appointed \nwithin their quota in the year 1990, they were placed senior to \nthe respondents. However, as of 17.07.1991, since there was \nonly one vacancy in the promotee quota of Forest Rangers, the \nrespondents herein were notionally pushed down for the \npurposes of the seniority alone and were adjusted till 1996. \nNeedless to mention the respondents get all the benefits of a \nForest Ranger though there was no vacancy when they were \npromoted, except seniority. Since, there was no direct \nrecruitment after 1990; the respondents do not suffer at all. \nIn July 1996, two of the Promotee Forest Rangers \nnamely, Shri Suresh Chandra Sharma and Shri Vijay Kumar \nMishra figuring at Sl. Nos. 286 and 277 in the promotion order \nof 17.07.1991 challenged the seniority list dated 31.05.1996 \nby way of a Writ Petition No.610 of 1996 in the High Court of \nAllahabad, claiming seniority. \n\nThe State of Uttaranchal came into being on 8th of \nNovember, 2000.\n\nOn 30.04.2001, the respondent Suresh Chandra Sharma \nopted for the State of Uttaranchal and started working in the \nState of Uttaranchal w.e.f. 30.04.2001. However, he did not \nimplead the state of Uttaranchal or the present appellants as a \nparty to the writ petition.\n\nIn 20.07.2001, the pending Writ petition was allowed by \nthe High Court and the High Court directed that the seniority \nlist on challenge be corrected by showing the promotees as \nsenior to the direct recruits by an order dated 26.11.2001. \nOn 12.06.2002, the new State of Uttaranchal notified in \nits own seniority list of Forest Rangers in which the appellants \nwere shown as seniors to the promotees.\n\nAnother promotee Shri C.B. Chhimwal respondent no.5 \nfiled a writ petition challenging the seniority list in the High \nCourt of Allahabad. The High Court by an order dated \n12.04.2004 allowed Chhimwal's claim following its previous \norder in the case of Suresh Chandra Sharma.\nThe appellants were unaware of the said order of the \nAllahabad High Court at Lucknow. It was only when the said \norder was produced before the officers of the State of \nUttaranchal, by respondent no.5, the appellants came to know \nabout the order which was passed by the High Court without \nmaking them a party. \n\nFollowing the Chhimwal case, 44 others moved the \nAllahabad High Court challenging the said seniority list. The \nHigh Court of Allahabad disposed off all the writ petitions and \nallowed the claim of all the writ petitioners and ordered \nretrospective application of the order.\n\nBy an order dated 18.01.2005, the State of U.P. issued \nan amended promotion order by which 45 persons have been \ngranted retrospective seniority, some from 01.01.1979 i.e. \nfrom a period of 12 years prior to their actual date of \npromotion, even though, admittedly, there was no vacancy in \nthe promotee quota, the effect of this order would be in the \nstate of Uttaranchal as well. \n\nThe appellants thereafter approached this Court on \n20.02.2005 seeking a stay on the application of the order of \nthe High Court of Allahabad. This Court ordered stay of the \noperation of the order of the High Court on 04.04.2005.\nThe issue now before us is whether the seniority list \npublished in 1996 is to be interfered with due to the order of \nthe High Court of Allahabad dated 12.11.2001.\nWe heard Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel \nappearing for the appellants and Mr. N.N. Goswami, learned \nsenior counsel, Dr. R.G. Padia, learned senior counsel, Mr. \nA.S. Rawat, learned Additional Advocate General and Mr. \nGaurav Agrawal, learned counsel for the respondents.\nMr. Jaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing for \nthe appellants submitted that:\n\n? That there were no vacancies in the promotee quota \nprior to 1991 and hence the High Court should not \nhave directed the State to grant retrospective \npromotion and seniority. \n\n? That the vacancies arose in the promotee quota of \nForest Rangers for the first time in 1987-88. \nHowever, against the said vacancies, 124 Forest \nRangers, who had been promoted to the post of \nForest Rangers on an ad hoc basis between 1973-77 \nwere regularized and adjusted on 30th November, \n1989. Therefore, 124 vacancies arising between \n1987 and 1990 in the promotee quota had been \nfilled up on a regular basis by the order dated \n30.11.1989. Therefore, it is only in the year 1991 \nthat a clear vacancy arose in the promotee quota. \n\nAs a result of this, even the persons who are \npromoted in1991 could not be given seniority from \n1991, but had to be pushed down and received their \nseniority on different dates between 1991 and 1996 \nas and when the vacancy arose. Further it was \nsubmitted that, if the High Court orders are given \neffect to, then 356 Deputy Forest Rangers would \nbecome entitled to promotion ahead of the direct \nrecruits far in excess of the quota.\n\n? That no retrospective promotion or seniority can be \ngranted from a date when an employee has not even \nbeen borne in the cadre so as to be adversely \nappointed validly in the meantime, as decided by \nthis court in the case of \nK.C. Joshi vs. Union of \nIndia\n, 1992 Suppl (1) SCC 227.\n\n? That the Seniority Rules of 1991 were not taken into \nconsideration by the High Court. Rule 8 of the \nSeniority Rules, states that, \n\"Section 8 \u0016 Where appointments from any source fall \nshort of the prescribed quota and appointment against \nsuch unfilled vacancies are made in subsequent year \nor years, the persons so appointed shall not get \nseniority of any earlier year, but shall get the seniority \nof the year in which their appointments are made.\"\nThe above stated Rules have overriding effect and hence \nseniority has to be consistent with the Rules\n? That the High Court has proceeded on the basis \nthat vacancies arose in 1987-88 and therefore, the \npromotion should be given retrospective effect. It \nwas submitted that the date on which vacancies \narises cannot, without more, be made a basis of \ngiving retrospective promotion and seniority. Also \nthe High Court did not give deserved amount of \nimportance to the recommendations of the Public \nService Commission and the Rules laid down under \nthe Public Service Commission (Procedure) Rules, \n1970.\n\n? That even if the High Court was of the opinion that \nthe seniority and promotion should be reworked, \nthe same should have referred back to the Public \nService Commission to ascertain who would be the \nrelevant person(s) entitled to promotion. More \ncrucially, in the second impugned order dated \n12.04.2004, 45 persons were directed to be \npromoted without taking into consideration their \nrelative position in the list prepared by the Public \nService Commission. By not referring the matter to \nthe PSC, incorrect persons were chosen by the High \nCourt for the purpose of promotion.\n\n? Concluding his submissions, the learned senior \ncounsel submitted that the seniority list under \nchallenge in the second writ petition was the \nseniority list of the Uttaranchal State Government of \n2002. Such challenge could not have been made \nbefore the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High \nCourt. He further submitted that none of the direct \nrecruits, who would be directly affected by an order, \nwere made parties to the writ petition. Therefore, \nthe High Court did not have the benefit of \ncompeting arguments in the matter. Even though \nthe Principal Secretary of the State of Uttaranchal \nwas made a party, and that the said party was \nnever served. \n\nLearned senior counsel, Dr. Padiya, appearing for respondent \nNos. 1 & 2 submitted as under:\n\n? That in the State of U.P. promotion from the post of Dy. \nForest Ranger to the post of Forest Ranger was held up \nbetween 1976-77 to 1987-88 on regular basis. 124 \nDy.Forest Rangers were promoted to the post of Forest \nRanger in the years 1973,1974,1975,1976,1977 & 1979 \non ad hoc basis beyond the prescribed limit for \npromotion.\n\n? That these ad hoc Forest Rangers were regularised in the \nyear 30.11.1988 and a requisition was sent for regular \npromotion to the post of Forest Range Officer through \nPublic Service Commission, U.P., Allahabad vide letter \nno.E-1851/1-2-4 dated 30.01.1991 for 410 vacancies. \nThe Forest Department issued the promotion order vide \nF.O. No.E-23/2-2-4 dated 17.07.1991 for 356 posts and \nsubsequently for 3 posts again.\n\n? That all the promotion orders were made prospective to \nthe date of joining. It was further submitted that \npromoted Range Officers were given their due seniority \nunder quota fixed for promotion, as is evident from para-\n2 of Order No.E-3211/10 \u001672, dated 08.06.1995. It was \nfurther submitted that when the said seniority list dated \n08.06.1995 was under preparation a mistake was \ndiscovered that there was no vacancy of Rangers in \npromotion quota and that there was no direct \nrecruitment of Forest Rangers from 1969-70 to 1976-77 \nand these vacancies were utilized in favour of promotees \nthus adjusting the promotees against the vacancies of \nquota of Direct Recruit, in excess of the quota available \nfor promotees under Rules. While preparing the final \nseniority list in question the promotees occupying \nvacancies in excess of their quota has been pushed down \nand the year wise vacancies of Direct Recruits have been \ncarried forward and upon the availability of Direct \nRecruit they have been placed en bloc in the vacancies \navailable in the quota for Direct Recruits.\n\n? That U.P. Govt. Servant Seniority Rules 1991 was in force \nwhen the promotion order of above 359 Dy. Forest \nRanger to the post of Forest Ranger was passed on \n17.07.1991. The rule 8(3) proviso allows vacancies of \nback years to be counted in the promotion but \nspecifically does not permit any promotion from back \nyear. Consequently the order dated 17.07.1991 was from \nthe prospective date of joining.\n\n? That an inadvertent error, oversight, made in the year \n1991 came into the notice of department on 03.12.1994 \nand the same was referred to the State Govt. for \ndirections. The State Govt. gave guidelines vide letter no. \n715/14-3-95-700 (236)/94 dated 11.09.1995 to give \npromotees the benefit for seniority after following the \nrespective quota for promotion strictly. \n? That accordingly a final seniority list was published in \n1995 and it was updated in 1996 by deleting the name of \nretired/promoted persons only. The original seniority list \nwas published in 1995 and it was maintained in other \nrespects as it is.\n\n? That the appointing authority of the petitioner in the Writ \npetition is PCCF, U.P., Lucknow who was served with the \njudgment dated 26.11.2001 which found it fit to comply \nwith the judgment as it was passed with the respect to \npetitioners of the writ petition. Only the judgment was \ncomplied with vide E-120/2-2-4(1) dated 30.01.2002 by \nthe PCCF, U.P., Lucknow.\n\n? That after the compliance of the judgment a set of new \nwrit petitions and some pending writ petition were \nclubbed by the High Court, Lucknow under Case No.366 \n(SB) 2002 and was decided on 12.04.2004 on the same \nline.\n\n? That a set of contempt petition was moved by the \npetitioners of the above bunch case specifically Contempt \nPetition No 1617 (C) of 2004 C.B. Chhimwal Vs. Smt. \nSurjit Kaur Sandhu & Ors. And Contempt Petition No. \n1897 (C) of 2004 Chandra Shekhar Kargeti Vs. \nK.Prasad and the date of personal appearance of officials \nwas fixed. Under these circumstances Principal chief \nConservator of Forest, U.P. Lucknow passed F.O. No. E-\n114/2-2-4 dated 18.01.2005 and judgment dated \n12.04.2004 was complied with under pressure of Court \norder; giving notional promotions to the appellants. \nThereafter, a report was produced before the High Court \nin Contempt Case No. 1617/C/2004 C.B. Chhimwal vs. \nSmt. Surjit Kaur Sandhu by an affidavit dated \n19.01.2005. The High Court was not satisfied with the \ncompliance and passed further direction on 28.02.2005 \nin the aforesaid contempt petition. The operative part of \nthe order dated 28.02.2005 is reproduced below:-\n\n\"The apprehension genuinely appears to be \nsustainable as the consequential benefit may be kept \nconfined to the seniority alone. It is also not \nunderstood as to why the phrase, 'notional promotion' \nhas been used by Chief Conservator Officer in his \norder of January 18, 2005 in the circumstances of \nthere being uncertainty on both the counts, the \nPrincipal Chief Conservator of Forests is directed to \nissue a corrigendum of the aforesaid order giving \ndetails of the benefit that would be extended to the \npetitioner in compliance of the judgment referred to \nabove.\"\n\n\"Accordingly, he is directed to file his \nsupplementary counter affidavit and a copy of the \nmodified order within fifteen days, list on 21.04.2005 \nfor orders. In case the uncertainty still remains, the \ncourt would consider the petitioners request for \npresence of the Principal Chief Conservator Officer \nbefore this Court.\"\n\n? That Dy. Rangers who were promoted to the post of \nRange Officers vide F.O. No.E-23/2-2-4 dated 17.07.1991 \ncannot be promoted with retrospective effect from a date \nwhen they were not borne in the cadre. Although in \ncompliance of the judgment and order passed by the \nHigh Court on 12.04.2004 the respondent no.6 along \nwith other 44 Dy. Rangers has been notionally promoted \nwith effect from 01.07.1987. A copy of the above \npromotion order was produced before the High Court in \nContempt Case No. 1617/C/2004 C.B. Chhimwal vs. \nSmt. Surjit Kaur Sandhu and Another. But the Court \nwas not satisfied with the above compliance made by the \ndepartment and on 28.02.2005 passed the above orders \nas mentioned above.\n\n? That the High Court granted the benefit of seniority to \nrespondent No.5 and other similarly situated persons \nthrough connected writ petition with effect from \nretrospective year 1979 to 1988 as the case may be, \nwhile their actual promotions have been done in the year \n1991 to the post of Forest Rangers. It is further stated \nthat service rules do not provide any time bound period \nfor such promotion.\n\n? That the Commission might have selected the \nrespondent No.5 along with other similarly situated \npersons against the vacancy of a particular year but \nfixation of seniority has to be made in accordance with \nthe statutory provision of U.P. Govt. Servant Seniority \nRules 1991 framed under proviso to Art 309 of the \nConstitution which strictly prohibits giving back year \nseniority.\n\n? That no direct recruitment between the year 1969-70 to \n1976-77, the then existing vacancies of Forest Rangers \nwere filled up by promotees of the department. As the \nvacancies belonging to the direct recruit was occupied by \npromotees between this period, the required number of \npost of promotees exceeded. Out of certain oversight the \nnumber of vacancies shown as year wise vacancies sent \nto the Public Service Commission against the vacancies \nof earlier years was wrongly indicated. At a later date at \nthe time of preparation of seniority list this inadvertent \nmistake was noticed at the time of preparation of list on \n08.06.1995 and immediately exercise was carried out to \ncheck the inadvertent mistake/oversight. The excess \nnumber of promotees against the Forest Rangers was \nlater adjusted and carried forward as per provisions. As \nper the above facts it is crystal clear that there was no \nvacancy existing for the promotees after the year 1973-74 \ntill 1986-87. In the year 1987-88, 9 vacancies were \navailable after a long gap. Similarly, the vacancies \navailable during the year 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91 \nare 31, 54 & 84 respectively. It was out of these \nvacancies, the adjustment of 124 Forest Rangers \nregularized on 30.11.1989 were adjusted. The name of \nrespondent no. 5 namely C.B. Chhimwal is much below \nand therefore he was not included in the above list. \n? That in view of the facts and circumstances stated above \nand as per provisions of Law the respondent no.5 along \nwith other similarly situated 353 persons are not entitled \nfor back date seniority as well as consequential benefit as \nthey have not actually worked on the post of Range \nOfficer, therefore this Court may very kindly be pleased \nto quash the judgment and order dated 12.04.2004 \npassed by the High Court of Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, \nLucknow in Writ Petition 366/SB/2002. \n\nLearned AAG, (State of Uttaranchal) appeared for the state of \nUttaranchal, and submitted as under:-\n\n? Rule 8(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Government Servant \nSeniority Rules, 1991 provides conferment of \nseniority to an employee from a pervious date \nprovided that the date of such conferment along \nwith substantive appointment is mentioned in the \norder of substantive appointment. Similar \nprovision also exists in the Uttaranchal \nGovernment Servant Seniority Rules, 2002. Hence \nit is clear that a person can be promoted with \nretrospective effect. It is also obvious that a person \ncannot be borne in a cadre till he is promoted to \nthat cadre.\n\n? A vacancy to any source of appointment can be \nascertained only when that source of appointment \nhas a well defined share of posts in ratio with other \nsources of appointment. In the present case, as per \nRule 5(a) of Uttaranchal Subordinate Services \nRules, 1951, it is quite clear that there is no \nfixed/well defined quota for the promoted source of \nappointment. Hence, allocation of year-wise \nvacancies against promotion quota is not possible. \nConsequently, the question raised by the appellant \nthat the seniority is reckoned from the date when \nappointment was done to the post in substantive \ncapacity or from the date when the vacancy accrued \nfor the post in the cadre is irrelevant.\n\n? Though the State of Uttaranchal came into \nexistence on 9.11.2000 but the final \nallotment/distribution of Forest Rangers' between \nUttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal was done in \nFebruary, 2004 with effect from 9.11.2004 by the \nGovernment of India under \nSection 73(1)\n of U.P. \nReorganisation Act, 2000 till the stage of this final \nallotment, any dispute pertaining to their seniority \nwas obviously the matter of jurisdiction of the State \nof Uttar Pradesh. \n\n? Rule 8(3) of the Rules is not applicable in this case \nbecause the appointments were not made by both \nthe direct and promoted sources of recruitment as a \nresult of one selection. Moreover, definite quota is \nnot prescribed for the two sources of appointment. \n? As per Rule 8 of the Seniority Rules, there is a \nprovision that if the appointment order specifies a \nparticular back date with effect from which a \nperson is substantively appointed, that date will be \ndeemed to be the date of order of substantive \nappointment and in other cases, it will mean the \ndate of issuance of the order. This implies that \nthere is a provision of vacancies of being carried \nover. Moreover, it is also in the interest of natural \njustice that employees are promoted from the date \nthey become eligible and the vacancy exits. \nOtherwise, it would result in denying promotion to \nthem for no fault of theirs and only because of not \nholding selection procedure on time for which they \ncannot be held responsible. As far as Rule 8(3) is \nconcerned, it applies to one selection made both for \npromotion and direct recruitment, which is not the \ncase under consideration. \n\nMr. N.N. Goswami, learned senior Counsel appearing for \nrespondent no.5, Chhimwal, largely adopted the arguments of \nthe state counsel. It was submitted that, this is a simple case \nof promotion of permanent Deputy Rangers against the \nvacancies as and when it occurred and the respondent was \nentitled for promotion. The High Court has correctly decided \nthe issue in question in W.P No. 610 (S/B) of 1996, which the \npetitioners have accepted and did not prefer a petition for \nSpecial Leave to appeal then, and the same issue cannot be \nagitated after four years and after compliance has already \nbeen done. The present petition against impugned order was \nnot decided on merit but was decided on the basis of parity. \nThe learned counsel submitted further that, the present case \nsquarely is covered by the judgment of this court in the case of \n\nP.N. Premachandran v. State of Kerala & Ors\n (2004) 1 \nSCC 245, where it was held that, \n\"\u0005.we do not find any irregularity in the matter of grant to \npromote the respondents with effect from 1964 onwards\u0005. \nin view, of the administrative lapse, the Departmental \nPromotion Committee did not hold a sitting from 1964 to \n1980. The respondents cannot suffer owing to such \nadministrative lapse on the part of the State of Kerala for no \nfault on their, part. It is also not disputed, that in ordinary \ncourse they were entitled to be promoted to the post of \nAssistant Director, in the event, a Departmental Promotion \nCommittee had been constituted in due time. In that view of \nthe matter, it must be held that the State of Kerala took a \nconscious decision to the effect that those who have been \nacting in a higher post for a long time although on a \ntemporary basis, but were qualified at the time when they \nwere so promoted and found to be eligible by the \nDepartmental Promotion Committee at a later date, should \nbe promoted with retrospective effect. Such exercise of power \non the part of the State is not unknown in service \njurisprudence. Even assuming that such a power did not \nexist in Rule 31 of the Rules the same can be traced to Rule \n39 of the Rules, as noted hereinbefore\u0005.\"\n\nHe further relied on \nA. Janardhana v. Union of India\n, (1983) \n3 SCC 601, where it was held as under:\n\n\"But avoiding any humanitarian approach to the problem, \nwe shall strictly go by the relevant rules and precedents and \nthe impact of the Rules on the members of the service and \ndetermine whether the impugned seniority lists is valid or \nnot. But, having done that we do propose to examine and \nexpose an extremely undesirable, unjust and inequitable \nsituation emerging in service jurisprudence from the \nprecedents namely, that a person already rendering service \nas a promotee has to go down below a person who comes \ninto service decades after the promotee enters the service \nand who may be a schoolian, if not in embryo, when the \npromotee on being promoted on account of the exigencies of \nservice as required by the Government started rendering \nservice. A time has come to recast, service jurisprudence on \nmore just and equitable foundation by examining all \nprecedents on the subject to retrieve this situation.\"\n\n We heard all the parties in detail and we have also perused \nthrough all the materials on record before us. We feel that, the \nappellants herein have a case and their arguments merit \nfavourable consideration.\n\nWe feel that the impugned judgment dated 26.11.2001 of \nthe High Court has correctly appreciated that vacancies arose \nin the year 1987-88, but have failed to appreciate that these \nvacancies were filled by regularizing 124 persons who were \ncarrying on as Forest Rangers on an ad hoc basis. We also are \nof the view that, if the orders of the High Court are to be given \neffect to, then 356 Deputy Forest Rangers would become \nentitled to promotion in excess of the quota. It is well settled \nthat promotion in excess of quota makes an employee an \nad hoc employee and seniority cannot be given to such \nemployees on the basis of ad hoc promotion. This was \nobserved by this court in a series of cases. \nIn the case of \n\nKeshav Chandra Joshi & Ors v. Union of India & Ors\n, \n1992 Supp.1 SCC 272, this Court observed that, \n\"It is notorious that confirmation of an employee in a \nsubstantive post would take place long years after the \nretirement. An employee is entitled to be considered for \npromotion on regular basis to a higher post if he/she is an \napproved probationer in the substantive lower post. An \nofficer appointed by promotion in accordance with Rules and \nwithin quota and on declaration of probation is entitled to \nreckon his seniority from the date of promotion and the \nentire length of service, though initially temporary, shall be \ncounted for seniority. Ad-hoc or fortuitous appointments on \na temporary or stop gap basis cannot be taken into account \nfor the purpose of seniority, even if the appointee was \nsubsequently qualified to hold the post on a regular basis. To \ngive benefit of such service would be contrary to equality \nenshrined in \nArticle 14\n read with \nArticle 16(1)\n of the \nConstitution as unequals would be treated as equals. When \npromotion is out side the quota, the seniority would be \nreckoned from the date of the vacancy within the quota, \nrendering the previous service fortuitous. The previous \npromotion would be regular only from the date of the \nvacancy within the quota and seniority shall be counted from \nthat date and not from the date of his earlier promotion or \nsub-sequent confirmation. In order to do justice to the \npromotees it would not be proper to do injustice to the direct \nrecruits. The rule of quota being a statutory one it must be \nstrictly implemented and it is impermissible for the \nauthorities concerned to deviate from the rule due to \nadministrative exigencies or expediency. The result of \npushing down the promotees appointed in excess of the \nquota may work out hardship but it is unavoidable and any \nconstruction otherwise would be illegal, nullifying the force \nof statutory rules and would offend \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1).\n \nTherefore, the rules must be carefully applied in such a \nmanner as not to violate the rules or equality assured under \n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. This Court interpreted that \nequity is an integral part of \nArticle 14.\n So every attempt \nwould be made to minimise, as far as possible, inequity, \nDisparity is inherent in the system of working out integration \nof the employees drawn from different sources, who have \nlegitimate aspiration to reach higher echelons of service. A \nfeeling of hardship to one, or heart burning to either would \nbe avoided. At the same time equality is accorded to all the \nemployees.\"\n\nIn \nSanjay Kumar Sinha & Ors v. State of Bihar & \nOrs\n, (2004) 10 SCC 734, this court observed that, \n\"6. In our view the first point regarding alleged non-\navailability of posts of ACFs for appointment of promotees at \nthe relevant time is sufficient to decide this appeal. On the \nquestion of availability of posts the case of the appellants is \nthat posts were not available and in the absence of the posts \nno appointments could be made. Still the respondents had \ngone ahead with the appointments of the promotees. Such \nappointments are mere fortuitous and cannot confer the \nbenefit of seniority from the date of appointment. The first \ndocument relied upon in support of this contention is a letter \ndated 23rd September, 1985 from the Chief Conservator, \nForests and Environment Department, Government of Bihar, \nPatna. The letter directly deals with the question of \npromotion of Forest Range Officer (FRO) to the post of \nAssistant Conservator of Forests (ACF). The letter notes that \nunder Rule 3 of the Bihar Forest Service Rules, at least 50% \nof the total existing vacancies have to be filled by promotion. \nIt goes on to add: \"Presently there are 125 officers in the \ncadre in the Bihar Forest Service, out of which 105 have \nbeen promoted from the post of Range Officer and rest are \nappointed by way of direct recruitment.\" According to this \nletter as per the cadre strength of the posts of ACF in Bihar \nState Forest Service, the promoted officers constituted 84%. \nThe Chief Conservator of Forests expressed his view in the \nsaid letter that filling such large number of posts by way of \npromotions affects the quality of service. The Chief \nConservator of Forests also notes that the State Service \nCommission had already issued advertisement for filling 40 \nposts of ACFs by direct recruitment. He has opined that in \nthese circumstances it would not be proper to fill up the \nposts of ACF by promotion. This letter highlights the \nimbalance already existing in the service qua the posts of \nACF so far as appointments of direct recruitment and \npromotees are concerned.\"\n\n\"12. It is clear from the admissions made on behalf of the \nrespondents by way of affidavits filed in judicial proceedings \nthat sanctioned number of posts were not available in the \nyear 1987 when the respondents were promoted as ACFs, \nrather the promotions were made against non-existing posts. \nCan such promotions confer any right on the officers \nconcerned particularly over and above the other duly \nappointed officers in the service like the appellants? In this \nconnection we have to note that Rule 35 of the Bihar Forest \nService Rules provides that seniority of officers appointed to \nthe service is to be determined with reference to the date of \ntheir substantive appointment. In order to become a member \nof the service the person concerned has to satisfy at least \ntwo conditions - first, appointment must be in substantive \ncapacity and (2) the appointment has to be to the post in the \nservice according to the Rules and within the quota to a \nsubstantive vacancy.\"\n\nFurther in the case of \nD.Ganesh Rao Patnaik & Ors v. \nState of Jharkhand & Ors\n, (2005) 8 SCC 454, this court \nopined that, \n\"\u0005. that the appointment of the contesting respondents was \nnot only contrary to Rules but was fortuitous in nature and \nthey can get no advantage of such fortuitous appointment \nuntil a substantive vacancy was available in their quota, \nwhich in fact became available much later some time in the \nyear 1993-94, which is long after the appointment of the \nappellants.\n \nWhat is a fortuitous appointment has been \nexplained in a Constitution Bench decision of this Court in \n\nRudra Kumar Sain v. Union of India\n (2000) 8 SCC 25. After \nobserving that the Rules in question did not define the terms \n'ad hoc', 'stopgap' and 'fortuitous', which are in frequent use \nin service jurisprudence, the Court referred to several \ndictionaries. The meaning given to the expression 'fortuitous' \nin Stroud's Judicial Dictionary is 'accident or fortuitous \ncasualty'. This should obviously connote that if an \nappointment is made accidentally, because of a particular \nemergent situation, such appointment obviously would not \ncontinue for a reasonably long period. In Black's Law \nDictionary the expression 'fortuitous' means 'occurring by \nchance', 'a fortuitous event may be highly unfortunate'. It \nthus indicates that it occurs only by chance or accident, \nwhich could not have been reasonably foreseen. In Oxford \ndictionary the meaning given to the word 'fortuitous' is - \nhappening by accident or chance rather than design. In our \nopinion it will not be proper to hold that the promotion of the \ncontesting respondents was fortuitous as contended by \nlearned counsel for the appellants. It cannot be said that the \ncontesting respondents were promoted by accident or by \nchance. Their promotion order was passed as there were \nvacancies to the posts of Additional District and Sessions \nJudges, though in the quota or direct recruits, but as no \nrecruitment from the said channel had been made for a long \ntime and sufficient number of candidates were not available, \nthe vacancies were filled in by giving promotion to members \nof Bihar Civil Service (Judicial Branch). If promotion orders \nhad not been passed and the posts had not been filled in, the \njudicial work in the districts would have suffered. However, it \nis clear that having regard to the various orders passed on \nthe judicial side by the Patna High Court and the legal \nposition being well settled that the temporary posts have also \nto be counted for determining the one-third quota of direct \nrecruits, the promotion given to the contesting respondents \nwas not in accordance with law. Instead of taking the harsh \nstep of rescinding their order of promotion the Patna High \nCourt, on the administrative side, took the decision to treat \nthem promoted against subsequent quota of promotees. \nTherefore, the contesting respondents can under no \ncircumstances claim seniority over the appellants and the \nview to the contrary taken by the Jharkhand High Court on \n29th August, 2002 on administrative side and also in the \njudgment and order dated 1st April, 2003, which is the \nsubject-matter of challenge in the present appeal, is wholly \nerroneous in law.\"\n\nWe also observe that, the High Court has granted \nseniority without even reference to Seniority Rules of 8, and in \nparticular the proviso thereto, has not been taken into \nconsideration. The said rules have overriding effect and hence \nseniority has to be consistent with the Rules. By virtue of Rule \n8, Seniority can be given only from 'the date of substantive \nappointment'. In this case, the promotees were appointed on \n17.07.1991 and therefore cannot be given seniority over the \nappellants who were substantively appointed prior in point of \ntime i.e. in 1990. It is specifically indicated in proviso to Rule 8 \nthat, \"Where appointments from any source fall short of the \nprescribed quota and appointment against such unfilled \nvacancies are made in subsequent year or years, the persons so \nappointed shall not get seniority of any earlier year, but shall \nget seniority of the year in which their appointments are made.\" \nThese rules were in force in 1991 when the Deputy \nForest Rangers were promoted to the post of Forest Rangers \non 17.07.1991. Also it is well settled that seniority has to be \ndecided on the basis of Rules in force on the date of \nappointment. It was observed by this court in the case of \n\nState of Karnataka & Ors v. C. Lalitha\n, (2006) 2 SCC 747, \nthat, \n\"Service jurisprudence evolved by this Court from time to \ntime postulates that all persons similarly situated should be \ntreated similarly. Only because one person has approached \nthe court that would not mean that persons similarly \nsituated should be treated differently. It is furthermore well-\nsettled that the question of seniority should be governed by \nthe rules. It may be true that this Court took notice of the \nsubsequent events, namely, that in the meantime she had \nalso been promoted as Assistant Commissioner which was a \nCategory I Post but the direction to create a supernumerary \npost to adjust her must be held to have been issued only \nwith a view to accommodate her therein as otherwise she \nmight have been reverted and not for the purpose of \nconferring a benefit to which she was not otherwise entitled \nto.\"\n\nIt was also observed in the case of \nUnion of India v. \nS.S.Uppal & Anr.\n, (1996) 2 SCC 168 that, \n\"12. We are of the view that the question of seniority of \nUppal, the respondent No. 1, has to be determined by the \nrules in force on the date of his appointment to IAS. The \nfixation of seniority in the IAS follows appointment to the \nservice. The Year of Allotment in the IAS will have to be \ndetermined according to the provisions of seniority rules \nwhich are in force at the time of his appointment. The date of \noccurrence of vacancy has really no relevance for the \npurpose of fixation of seniority in the IAS. The fixation of \nseniority is done only after an officer is appointed to IAS. The \nCentral Government is competent to amend the seniority \nrules from time to time keeping in view the exigencies of \nadministration.\"\n\nThus we feel that the High Court order granting \npromotees seniority from 1987-88 suffers from infirmity and is \nliable to be set aside.\n\nWe are also of the view that no retrospective promotion or \nseniority can be granted from a date when an employee has \nnot even been borne in the cadre so as to be adversely \nappointed validly in the meantime, as decided by this court in \nthe case of \nK.C. Joshi & others vs. Union of India\n, 1992 \nSuppl (1) SCC 272 held that when promotion is outside the \nquota, seniority would be reckoned from the date of the \nvacancy within the quota rendering the previous service \nfortuitous. The previous promotion would be regular only \nfrom the date of the vacancy within the quota and seniority \nshall be counted from that date and not from the date of his \nearlier promotion or subsequent confirmation. In order to do \njustice to the promotees, it would not be proper to do injustice \nto the direct recruits. The rule of quota being a statutory one, \nit must be strictly implemented and it is impermissible for the \nauthorities concerned to deviate from the rule due to \nadministrative exigencies or expediency. The result of pushing \ndown the promotees appointed in excess of the quota may \nwork out hardship, but it is unavoidable and any construction \notherwise would be illegal, nullifying the force of statutory \nrules and would offend \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n of the \nConstitution.\n\nThis Court has consistently held that no retrospective \npromotion can be granted nor any seniority can be given on \nretrospective basis from a date when an employee has not \neven borne in the cadre particularly when this would adversely \naffect the direct recruits who have been appointed validly in \nthe meantime. \nIn, \nState of Bihar & Ors v. Akhouri \nSachidananda Nath & Ors\n, 1991 Suppl. (1) SCC 334, this \ncourt observed that,\n\"12. In the instant case, the promotee respondents 6 to 23 \nwere not born in the cadre of Assistant Engineer in the Bihar \nEngineering Service, Class II at the time when the \nrespondents 1 to 5 were directly recruited to the post of \nAssistant Engineer and as such they cannot be given \nseniority in the service of Assistant Engineers over the \nrespondents 1 to 5. It is well settled that no person can be \npromoted with retrospective effect from a date when he was \nnot born in the cadre so as to adversely affect others. It is \nwell settled by several decisions of this Court that amongst \nmembers of the same grade seniority is reckoned from the \ndate of their initial entry into the service. In other words, \nseniority inter-se amongst the Assistant Engineers in Bihar \nEngineering Service, Class II will be considered from the date \nof the length of service rendered as Assistant Engineers. This \nbeing the position in law the respondents 6 to 23 can not be \nmade senior to the respondents 1 to 5 by the impugned \nGovernment orders as they entered into the said Service by \npromotion after the respondents 1 to 5 were directly \nrecruited in the quota of direct recruits. The judgment of the \nHigh Court quashing the impugned Government orders \nmade in annexures, 8, 9 and 10 is unexceptionable.\"\n\nThis court in Vinodanand Yadav & Ors v. State of Bihar & \nOrs, 1994 Suppl. (2) SCC 44, held:\n\n\"On an issue regarding the interse seniority among the direct \nrecruits and promotees the Court applying the ratio of \nState \nof Bihar v. Akhouri Sachindranath\n held that the \nappellants who were direct recruits shall be considered \nsenior over the promotees not borne on the cadre when the \ndirect recruits were appointed in service. Hence the \ngradation list drawn under which promotees where given \nseniority over direct recruits could not be sustained and was \nthereby set aside\".\n\n The High Court, in the impugned judgment dated \n26.11.2001 has proceeded on the basis that vacancies arose in \n1987-88 and, therefore, should be given retrospective effect. \nThe said submission, in our opinion, has no force and import. \nIn our view, the date on which vacancies arose cannot without \nmore be made a basis of giving retrospective promotion and \nseniority. \nIn \nJagdish Ch. Patnaik & Ors v. State of Orissa \n& Ors\n, 1998(4) SCC 456, this Court observed:\n\n32. The next question for consideration is whether the year \nin which the vacancy accrues can have any relevance for the \npurpose of determining the seniority irrespective of the fact \nwhen the persons are recruited? Mr. Banerjee's contention \non this score is that since the appellant was recruited to the \ncadre of Assistant Engineer in respect of the vacancies that \narose in the year 1978 though in fact the letter of \nappointment was issued only in March 1980, he should be \ntreated to be a recruit of the year 1978 and as such would be \nsenior to the promotees of the years 1979 and 1980 and \nwould be junior to the promotees of the year 1978. According \nto the learned Counsel since the process of recruitment \ntakes a fairly long period as the Public Service Commission \ninvites application, interviews and finally selects them \nwhereupon the Government takes the final decison, it would \nbe illogical to ignore the year in which the vacancy arose and \nagainst which the recruitment has been made. There is no \ndispute that there will be some time lag between the year \nwhen the vacancy accrues and the year when the final \nrecruitment is made for complying with the procedure \nprescribed but that would not give a handle to the Court to \ninclude something which is not there in the Rules of \nSeniority under Rule 26. Under Rule 26 the year in which \nvacancy arose and against which vacancy the recruitment \nhas been made is not at all to be looked into for \ndetermination of the inter se seniority between direct recruits \nand the promotees. It merely states that during the calendar \nyear direct recruits to the cadre of Assistant Engineer would \nbe junior to the promotee recruits to the said cadre. It is not \npossible for the Court to import something which is not there \nin Rule 26 and thereby legislate a new Rule of Seniority. We \nare, therefore, not in a position to agree with the submission \nof Mr. Banerjee, the learned senior counsel appearing for the \nappellants on this score.\n\n In the instant case, the High Court has relied upon the \nletter of the Public Service Commission dated 06.07.1991 to \ncome to the conclusion that the PSC recommended the \nappointments to be given to the promotees from the date on \nwhich the vacancy arose. Even apart from the fact that it has \nnow been conclusively established that the vacancy position \nindicated to the PSC was not correct, there is nothing in the \nsaid letter of the PSC which would lead to the conclusion that \nit had recommended that appointment should date back to the \ndate of vacancies. All that the letter indicates is that the \nCommission had considered the fitness and suitability of the \ncandidates year by year taking into consideration the \nvacancies that had allegedly arisen in the concerned year. \nThis is only an exercise for the purpose of arriving at the name \nof the employees to be recommended which had nothing to do \nwith the date on which the appointment was to be given. The \nreliance placed by the High Court on the U.P. promotion by \nselection in consultation with the Public Service Commission \n(Procedure) Rules, 1970 and, in particular, Rules 13 and 21 \nalso does not mandate that the appointment has to be made \non the date on which the vacancy arose. It confirms that while \nselecting the persons the Government has to send requisition \nyear-wise and the PSC to make its recommendation year-wise. \nAgain this does not lead to a conclusion as to the date on \nwhich appointment should take effect. \n\n An alternative argument was made by Mr. Gupta to the \neffect that even if the High Court was of the opinion that the \nseniority and promotion should be re-worked the same should \nhave referred back to the PSC to ascertain who would be the \nrelevant persons entitled to promotion. The High Court did \nnot accept that PSC's recommendation in its entirety since in \nits view vacancies only arose in 1987-88 and not in 1979-80 \nas indicated by the PSC. \n\n Likewise, in the second impugned order dated \n12.04.2004, 45 persons were directed to be promoted without \ntaking into consideration their relative position in the list \nprepared by the PSC. By not referring the matter to the PSC, \nincorrect persons were chosen by the High Court for the \npurpose of promotion. This submission was, however, made \nby learned senior counsel without prejudice to the submission \nthat the entire basis for directing retrospective promotion and \nseniority was erroneous and there were no vacancies at all. \n The second impugned order dated 12.04.2004 is further \nvitiated for the following reasons:-\n\na) Forum: The seniority list under challenge in the \nsecond writ petition was the seniority list of the Uttaranchal \nState Government of 2002 and such challenge could not have \nbeen made before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High \nCourt. \n\nb) Parties: None of the direct recruits who would be \ndirectly affected by order cannot were made parties to the writ \npetition. Therefore the High Court did not have the benefit of \ncompeting arguments in the matter. Even though, the \nPrincipal Secretary of the State of Uttaranchal was made a \nparty, the said party was never served. The only respondent \nwhich was heard was the State of U.P. which had no stake in \nthe matter at all since all of the writ petitioners before the \nLucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court where employees \nof the State of Uttaranchal on the relevant date. It is, \ntherefore, evident that the relevant material was not placed \nbefore the Allahabad High Court for the purpose of deciding \nthe writ petition. Accordingly, the permission had to be taken \nfrom this Court by the present appellants to prefer the SLPs. \n\n We, therefore, have no hesitation in setting aside the final \njudgment and order dated 12.04.2004 passed by the High \nCourt of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench in Writ \nPetition No. 366 SB of 2002 whereby the High Court allowed \nthe writ petition filed by C.B. Chhimwal and allow the Civil \nAppeal No. of 2006 arising out of SLP (C) No. 7375 of \n2005. \n\n Likewise, we allow the Civil Appeal No. of 2006 \narising out of SLP (C) No. 1860 of 2006 and set aside the \nimpugned judgment and order dated 26.11.2001 passed in \nWrit Petition No. 610(S/B) of 1996 by the High Court of \nAllahabad at Lucknow Bench. \n\n However, we are making it clear that this judgment of \nours will not adversely affect the benefits of the order which \nhave been enjoyed by any of the promotees who have retired \nfrom service. The division of seniority list, however, has \nserious and lasting consequences insofar as the appellants are \nconcerned which of crucial importance as far as the \npromotional prospects of the appellants are concerned. \n We, therefore, direct the State of Uttaranchal through its \nPrincipal Secretary (Forest) Dehradun, Uttaranchal to revise \nthe seniority list of direct recruits in line with the observations \nand conclusions made in this judgment by us within 2 months \nfrom the date of receipt of this judgment. No costs.",

In our view the first point regarding alleged non-\navailability of posts of ACFs for appointment of promotees at \nthe relevant time is sufficient to decide this appeal. On the \nquestion of availability of posts the case of the appellants is \nthat posts were not available and in the absence of the posts \nno appointments could be made. Still the respondents had \ngone ahead with the appointments of the promotees. Such \nappointments are mere fortuitous and cannot confer the \nbenefit of seniority from the date of appointment. The first \ndocument relied upon in support of this contention is a letter \ndated 23rd September, 1985 from the Chief Conservator, \nForests and Environment Department, Government of Bihar, \nPatna. The letter directly deals with the question of \npromotion of Forest Range Officer (FRO) to the post of \nAssistant Conservator of Forests (ACF). The letter notes that \nunder Rule 3 of the Bihar Forest Service Rules, at least 50% \nof the total existing vacancies have to be filled by promotion. \nIt goes on to add: \"Presently there are 125 officers in the \ncadre in the Bihar Forest Service, out of which 105 have \nbeen promoted from the post of Range Officer and rest are \nappointed by way of direct recruitment.\" According to this \nletter as per the cadre strength of the posts of ACF in Bihar \nState Forest Service, the promoted officers constituted 84%. \nThe Chief Conservator of Forests expressed his view in the \nsaid letter that filling such large number of posts by way of \npromotions affects the quality of service. The Chief \nConservator of Forests also notes that the State Service \nCommission had already issued advertisement for filling 40 \nposts of ACFs by direct recruitment. He has opined that in \nthese circumstances it would not be proper to fill up the \nposts of ACF by promotion.

After \nobserving that the Rules in question did not define the terms \n'ad hoc', 'stopgap' and 'fortuitous', which are in frequent use \nin service jurisprudence, the Court referred to several \ndictionaries. The meaning given to the expression 'fortuitous' \nin Stroud's Judicial Dictionary is 'accident or fortuitous \ncasualty'. This should obviously connote that if an \nappointment is made accidentally, because of a particular \nemergent situation, such appointment obviously would not \ncontinue for a reasonably long period. In Black's Law \nDictionary the expression 'fortuitous' means 'occurring by \nchance', 'a fortuitous event may be highly unfortunate'. It \nthus indicates that it occurs only by chance or accident, \nwhich could not have been reasonably foreseen. In Oxford \ndictionary the meaning given to the word 'fortuitous' is - \nhappening by accident or chance rather than design. In our \nopinion it will not be proper to hold that the promotion of the \ncontesting respondents was fortuitous as contended by \nlearned counsel for the appellants. It cannot be said that the \ncontesting respondents were promoted by accident or by \nchance. Their promotion order was passed as there were \nvacancies to the posts of Additional District and Sessions \nJudges, though in the quota or direct recruits, but as no \nrecruitment from the said channel had been made for a long \ntime and sufficient number of candidates were not available, \nthe vacancies were filled in by giving promotion to members \nof Bihar Civil Service (Judicial Branch). If promotion orders \nhad not been passed and the posts had not been filled in, the \njudicial work in the districts would have suffered. However, it \nis clear that having regard to the various orders passed on \nthe judicial side by the Patna High Court and the legal \nposition being well settled that the temporary posts have also \nto be counted for determining the one-third quota of direct \nrecruits, the promotion given to the contesting respondents \nwas not in accordance with law. Instead of taking the harsh \nstep of rescinding their order of promotion the Patna High \nCourt, on the administrative side, took the decision to treat \nthem promoted against subsequent quota of promotees. \nTherefore, the contesting respondents can under no \ncircumstances claim seniority over the appellants and the \nview to the contrary taken by the Jharkhand High Court on \n29th August, 2002 on administrative side and also in the \njudgment and order dated 1st April, 2003, which is the \nsubject-matter of challenge in the present appeal, is wholly \nerroneous in law.\""
