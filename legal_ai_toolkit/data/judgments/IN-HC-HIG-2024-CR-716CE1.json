JUSTICE MOHD. YOUSUF WANI, JUDGE\n,\n\nJUDGMENT\n\n01. The instant bail application has been filed under the\n\nprovisions of Section 483 of Bharatiya Nagraik Suraksha\n\nSanhita, 2023, [hereinafter referred to as „BNSS, for short],\n\ncorresponding to Section 438 of the repealed\nCode of Criminal\n\nProcedure\n, 1973, [hereinafter referred to as „ Code‟ for short],\n\nfor grant of bail in favour of the petitioner/accused in case FIR\n\nNo. 116/2022 of Police Station, Katra, the investigation\n\nwherein has already culminated into the filing of final police\n\nreport/challan filed before the court of learned Principal\n\nSessions Judge, Reasi [hereinafter referred to as „the Trial\n\nCourt‟] in terms of the provisions of\nSection 193\nof the BNSS,\n\ncorresponding to\nSection 173\nof the Code under\nsections 376\n,\nIPC and 3/4 of\nProtection of Children from Sexual\n\nOffences Act\n2012, [herein referred to as „\nPOCSO Act\n‟]\npursuant to the dismissal of his earlier bail application by the\n\nTrial Court.\n\n02. The bail has been sought on the grounds that\n\npetitioner/accused has been falsely and frivolously involved in\n\nthe case FIR No. 116/2022 of Police Station, Katra, registered\n\nunder\nSections, 376\n,\nIPC and 3/4 of POSCO Act, which has\n\nculminated in the filing of final report/challan pending before\n\nthe learned Trial Court. That an earlier bail application filed for\n\nand on behalf of the petitioner/accused before the learned Trial\n\nCourt on 14th February, 2024, came to be dismissed by the\n\nlearned Trial Court vide Order dated 8th June, 2024 as being\n\nnon-maintainable on the ground that this Court in a criminal\n\npetition filed under Section 482 of the Code, corresponding to\n\nSection 528 of the BNSS, stayed the process of taking\n\ncognizance on the final report/challan while allowing the\n\npresentation of the same vide Order dated 8th May, 2024. That\n\naggrieved by the Order dated 8th June, 2024, passed by the\n\nlearned Trial Court while dismissing the bail application, the\n\npetitioner/accused approached this Court with a bail application\n\nbearing No. 133/2024 and this Court, vide Order, dated 21st\n\nJune, 2024, set-aside the Order dated 8th June, 2024, of the\n\nlearned Trial Court, directing for adjudication of the bail\n\napplication on merits. That the learned Trial Court pursuant to\n\nthe Order dated 21st June, 2024, of this Court heard the bail\n\napplication afresh and disposed of the same on merits while\n\ndismissing the same vide Order dated 10th July, 2024, which\n\nnecessitated the filing of instant bail application. That the\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nmedical evidence, FSL opinion and more especially, the DNA\n\nAnalysis Report have ruled out the involvement of the\n\npetitioner/accused in the commission of alleged crime. That\n\nbasically a couple, namely, \"X\" [husband] and \"Y\" [wife]\n\nresidents of Panjar District Udhampur along with their minor\n\nchildren came to Katra in the year 2011 in search of their\n\nemployment as labourers/private workers on account of their\n\nextreme poverty. That the mother of the petitioner/accused\n\ngave them shelter and in lieu of the same, Mrs. \"Y\" used to\n\nattend the house hold works of the mother of the accused when\n\n\"X\" used to go for begging at Railway Track, out of which\n\namount the major portion was used to be taken by the mother of\n\nthe accused. That \"Y\" while giving birth to her 5th child in the\n\nyear 2015 expired and later on her husband \"X\" also died in the\n\nyear 2018. That the children of the deceased couple consisting\n\nof four daughters and one son continued to live with mother of\n\nthe accused even after the death of their parents as none of\n\ntheir relatives came forward to own them. That in February,\n\n2021, two daughters of the deceased couple including the\n\nprosecutrix ran away from Katra on the pretext of seeing their\n\nland at their parental village Panjar, Udhampur, as they came to\n\nbe informed by some villagers that their parental uncles are\n\ngoing to sell out their share in the land also. That while going to\n\ntheir native village Panjar, Udhampur, they met their step\n\nmaternal grandfather and thereafter both the girls stayed at his\n\nresidence for 15 to 20 days. That as per the version of one of\n\ngirls, i.e., sister of the prosecutrix, she narrowly escaped an\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nattempt of sexual assault of her said maternal step grandfather\n\non which night she ran away from his home and slept on the\n\nroad side and reached Katra next morning. That the other girl\n\ni.e., complaint/victim preferred to stay at her step maternal\n\ngrandfather‟s house despite, the insistence by her sister for\n\ncoming back to Katra. That the respondent no. 2/victim\n\ncontinued to live at maternal grandfather‟s house till February,\n\n2022, where she reportedly gave birth to a baby girl who is now\n\nabout more than one month old. That the parental uncle‟s son\n\nof the respondent no. 2/victim, upon hearing about the matter\n\napproached the concerned police station in Panjar, Udhampur\n\nfor taking action against the maternal grandfather of the\n\nprosecutrix for committing forcible repeated rape upon her,\n\nmaking her pregnant and even managing her delivery in a\n\nJungle (Forest). That the step maternal grandfather of the\n\nrespondent no. 2/prosecutrix, by use of his influence succeeded\n\nin shifting the blame upon the petitioner/accused. That on 23 rd\n\nApril, 2022, the said person brought the respondent no. 2 to\n\nPolice Station, Katra, under his influence and succeeded in\n\nlodging a complaint written in Urdu before the SHO, Police\n\nStation, Katra, involving the petitioner/accused in commission\n\nof the crime.\nThat it was alleged in the said complaint lodged\n\nby the respondent no. 2 at the behest of her said step maternal\n\ngrandfather that the petitioner/accused allured her and forcibly\n\ncommitted rape on her, whereafter he threatened her of dire\n\nconsequences in case she made a revelation of the same, who\n\nlastly took the prosecutrix to her step maternal grandfather‟s\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nplace at Panjar, where, after one month, she gave birth to a\n\nbaby girl. That the respondent no. 1, i.e., SHO, Police Station,\n\nKatra, without looking to the genuineness of the highly\n\nmotivated complaint prepared and filed by said step maternal\n\ngrandfather of the victim through her, registered the FIR No.\n\n116/2022 against the petitioner/accused for commission of\n\noffences under\nSections 376\n,\nIPC and 3/4 of POSCO Act.\n\nThat the registration of the FIR against the petitioner/accused is\n\nalso backed by the persons who have committed the murder of\n\nthe brother of the petitioner/accused and were acquitted by the\n\nTrial Court, but regarding which acquittal, the mother of the\n\npetitioner/accused has filed a criminal revision which is\n\npending before this Court alongside the acquittal appeal filed\n\nby the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. That the\n\nregistration of the FIR against the petitioner, was assailed by\n\nhim through the medium of a criminal petition filed under\n\nSection 482 of the Code bearing No. CRM(M) No. 368/2022\n\ntitled\nPawan Kumar vs. UT of Jammu and Kashmir and Anr.\n, in\n\nwhich, this Court in the first instance directed that while\n\nproceeding with the investigation of the case, the respondent\n\nno. 1 shall await the orders of this Court for filing charge sheet,\n\nif any, contemplated. That this Court subsequently vide Order\n\ndated 8th May, 2024, passed on the said petition directed the\n\nprosecution to file the challan before the Trial Court, but barred\n\nthe taking of cognizance in the criminal case till further orders\n\nof this Court. That it is the case of the prosecution as mentioned\n\nin the challan that the DNA Analysis has ruled out the\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\npetitioner/accused as being the biological father of the child\n\nwho was born from the respondent no. 2 out of the alleged\n\noffence of rape. That the learned Trial Court, while rejecting\n\nthe bail vide Order dated 10th July, 2024 has committed an\n\nerror as the Court has failed to appreciate that the allegations\n\nagainst the petitioner/accused as per the prosecution are full of\n\ninherent contradictions and based on no overwhelming\n\nevidence. That the learned Trial Court has overlooked the very\n\nimportant aspect i.e., DNA Analysis Report while rejecting the\n\nbail application. That the petitioner/accused in his petition\n\nearlier filed before this Court under Section 482 of the Code\n\nhas averred that he has been falsely implicated in the case as he\n\nhad no physical contact with the alleged prosecutrix. That the\n\npetitioner/accused voluntarily opted for his DNA profiling for\n\nallowing the State to ascertain his involvement. That the\n\nincarceration of the petitioner in the case despite his non-\n\ninvolvement as per the DNA Report is unjustified under law.\n\nThat the learned Trial Court has rejected the bail application of\n\nthe petitioner only on the basis of statement of respondent no. 2\n\nrecorded during investigation under Section 164 of the Code,\n\nwhich, inter alia, is to the effect that petitioner raped her for\n\nthree to four years and when she revealed the matter to her\n\nmother, she did not pay any heed to the same and instead\n\nturned her out from her residence, which version could not be\n\nbelieved as being without any clear dates and being belated.\n\nThat had the respondent no. 2 been subjected to the rape by the\n\npetitioner continuously for years, then she ought to have raised\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nan alarm earlier. That the respondent no. 2 was residing for\n\nmore than one and a half year at Panjar in her step maternal\n\ngrandfather‟s house, who, in fact, subjected her to repeated rape\n\nand made her pregnant where after he by use of his influence\n\nand by exerting undue influence on the respondent no. 2\n\nsucceeded in filing a false complaint before the SHO, Katra, for\n\nregistration of FIR. That the petitioner will not jump over the\n\nconcession of the bail and shall abide any conditions that may\n\nbe imposed by the Court.\n\nThat the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in a criminal appeal No. 537/2020 titled\nJayanat\n\nChatterjee vs. The State of West Bengal\nenlarged the\n\nappellant/accused to bail on the ground that DNA Report did\n\nnot show him as the biological father of the child born.\n\n03. The respondent no. 1 i.e., Union Territory of Jammu and\n\nKashmir through SHO, Police Station Katra Reasi resisted the\n\nbail petition on the grounds, inter alia; that the\n\npetitioner/accused is involved in commission of offences\n\npunishable under\nSections 376\n,\nIPC and 3/4 of POSCO\n\nAct arising out of case FIR No. 116/2022 registered with Police\n\nStation, Katra Reasi; that the statements of the witnesses\n\nespecially that of the respondent no. 2/prosecutrix recorded\n\nunder Sections 161 and 164-A of the Code, the medical\n\nexamination of the respondent no. 2 and her age determination\n\nhave corroborated the commission of offences by the\n\npetitioner/accused during investigation of the case and the final\n\nreport/challan stands also filed before the competent court\n\nwhich is pending trial; that the DNA profiling of the new born\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nbaby who has subsequently died due to dehydration at SMGS\n\nHospital, Jammu, respondent no. 2/prosecutrix and also of the\n\npetitioner/accused has been done and that the learned Trial\n\nCourt has rightly dismissed the earlier bail application of the\n\npetitioner on merits as the offences committed by the petitioner\n\nare heinous and antisocial.\n\n04. The bail petition has been resisted on behalf of the respondent\n\nno. 2 i.e., prosecutirix on the grounds that the\n\npetitioner/accused does not deserve the concession of bail as he\n\nhas committed serious, non-bailable and antisocial offences in\n\nrelation to a minor orphan girl by taking advantage of her\n\norphanage and helplessness. That the nature of the crime\n\ncommitted by the petitioner/accused is of utmost seriousness.\n\nThe petitioner/accused not only forcibly raped the victim\n\nresulting in her pregnancy and the birth of a baby at the age of\n\n14 years, but coerced her with a false promise of marriage to\n\nensure her silence. That both the petitioner and his mother\n\nfurther threatened to kill the victim in case she discloses the\n\ncrime. That fearing her life, the respondent no. 2 was\n\ncompelled to flee to her maternal grandfather‟s residence where\n\nshe gave birth in isolation in March, 2022. That the release of\n\nthe petitioner/accused on bail is likely to pose a significant\n\nthreat to the safety and wellbeing of the victim who has already\n\nsuffered immense trauma. That the accused in order to flee\n\nfrom the clutches of law absconded since 23rd February, 2022\n\nand was only apprehended on 11th February, 2024. That in view\n\nof the severity of the charges and potential consequences on the\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nvictim‟s health and wellbeing, there is high likelihood that the\n\npetitioner may attempt to evade the judicial process and cause\n\nharm to the victim if granted bail. That mention of the maternal\n\ngrandfather of the victim as an offender is an attempt on the\n\npart of the petitioner to create confusion and to shift the blame.\n\nThat the statement of the victim clearly reveals that the\n\noffences have been committed by the petitioner and not by the\n\nsaid person. That the police concerned during investigation of\n\nthe case did not find any evidence regarding involvement of the\n\nBalak Ram. That the re-examination of the DNA samples is\n\nnecessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings.\n\nThat the initial DNA test results may have been influenced by\n\nfactors, such as, sample contamination or procedural errors.\n\nFurthermore, the doctors, who conducted the original DNA\n\ntest, be examined as witnesses during the trial to ensure that\n\nthere was no tampering whatsoever. That the petitioner‟s\n\ncontinuous attempt to question the DNA Analysis Report is an\n\neffort to divert attention from the core issue of sexual assault,\n\nwhich the victim‟s statement clearly establishes. That granting\n\nof bail in this case would set a dangerous precedent,\n\nparticularly, as the crime involves heinous acts against a minor.\n\nSuch an act is not only a grave violation of victim‟s rights but\n\nalso an affront to societal morals and the rule of law. That the\n\nallegations in the FIR and the criminal challan against the\n\npetitioner cannot be dismissed as false, frivolous, or baseless\n\nsolely on the basis of delay in reporting. The delay in reporting\n\nsuch traumatic events is not unusual and should not be used to\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nundermine the seriousness of the allegations. The victim, who\n\nwas a mere child and an orphan, of 14-15 years old at the time\n\nof the alleged incidents, is likely to have experienced\n\nsignificant psychological trauma, fear and coercion, which\n\ncould have impeded her ability to report the crime immediately.\n\nThe fact that the victim did not raise an alarm immediately or\n\nthat the accused is not the biological father the child does not\n\nnegate the occurrence of the crime or the credibility of the\n\nvictim‟s account. The respondent no. 2 has given the detailed\n\npara-wise response to the bail application also.\n\n05. Learned counsel for the respondent no. 2/prosecutrix in support\n\nof the memo of his objections has placed reliance on the\n\nAuthoritative Judgments cited as\nRahul Kumar vs. Union\n\nTerritory of Jammu and Kashmir\nthrough SHO Police\n\nStation Miran Sahib Jammu and Ors, reported in (2023) SCC\n\nOnline J&K 323, State of Bihar vs. Bajballav Parasad,\n\nreported in (2017) 2 SCC 178 and Y vs. State of Rajasthan\n\nand Anr, reported in (2022) 9 SCC 269. It has been laid down\n\nin the relied upon cases that seriousness of the crime committed\n\nby the accused, the age of the prosecutrix and the statutory\n\npresumptions under\nSections 29\nand\nof the POCSO Act are\n\nneeded to be considered while dealing with the bail application\n\nof an accused involved in serious offences of sexual assault in\n\nrelation to a minor victim. It has also been laid down in the\n\nrelied upon cases that the court cannot conduct a mini trial\n\nwhile considering a bail application as the same is likely to\n\nprejudice the merits of the main case.\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n06. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, who almost\n\nreiterated their respective stands taken in the bail application\n\nand the objections respectively.\n\n07. I have perused the instant bail application and objections filed\n\nin rebuttal by the respondents. Considered the rival\n\nsubmissions.\n\n08. The final report/challan in terms of the provisions of Section\n\n193 of BNSS is reported to have been already filed before the\n\nTrial Court, in which, the taking of cognizance stands barred\n\npending further orders by this Court as per its order dated 8 th\n\nMay, 2024, passed on a petition filed under Section 482 of the\n\nCode by the petitioner/accused.\n\n09. The petitioner/accused, as per the police report/challan, a copy\n\nwhereof is enclosed with the instant bail application, is alleged\n\nto have committed the offences punishable under\nSections\n,\nIPC and 3/4 of POSCO Act arising out of case FIR\n\nNo. 116/2022 of Police Station Katra, Reasi.\n\n10. Admittedly, in case of non-bailable offences which do not\n\ncarry a sentence of death or imprisonment for life in alternative,\n\nbail is a rule and its denial an exception especially in cases\n\nwhere firstly the custodial questioning of an accused is not\n\nimperative for the logical and scientific conclusion of the\n\ninvestigation and secondly where there is nothing on record to\n\nshow that the accused, if admitted to bail, will misuse the\n\nconcession by tampering with the prosecution evidence, by\n\nnon-cooperation and association with the investigating agency\n\nand also by absconding at the trial.\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n11. Apart from the statutory bar, if any, two paramount\n\nconsiderations viz. likelihood of accused fleeing from justice\n\nand tampering with the prosecution evidence relate to the\n\nensuring of a fair trial of the case in a court of law. It is\n\nessential that due and proper appreciation and weightage should\n\nbe bestowed on these factors apart from others. The grant of\n\nbail or the denial of the same falls within the purview of the\n\njudicial discretion meant to be exercised on sound legal\n\nprinciples upon the logical interpretation and application of the\n\nsame in the given facts and circumstances of the case. The\n\nnecessary arrests subject to the law of bails as provided under\n\nthe Code, BNSS and the provisions of different special\n\nLegislations are permissible under the Constitution of our\n\nCountry by way of a reasonable exception to the fundamental\n\nright to liberty guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution\n\nand the mandate of the provisions of\nArticle 22\nof the\n\nConstitution is meant to be followed upon making any such\n\nnecessary arrests.\n\n12.\nIn\nState of Rajasthan Jaipur Vs. Balchand\nAIR 1977 S.C.\n\n2447. The Hon‟ble Apex Court has held, \"basic rule may\n\nperhaps be tersely put as bail not jail, except where there are\n\ncircumstances of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of\n\njustice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating\n\noffences or intimidating the witnesses and the like, by the\n\npetitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the court.\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n13. It is also well settled that the bar imposed under section 480 of\n\nBNSS on the exercise of the discretion in the matters of bail\n\nsubject to proviso contained in the section, is confined to the\n\noffences carrying a sentence of death or imprisonment for life\n\nin alternative and the offences carrying a sentence of\n\nimprisonment for life disjunctive of death sentence are\n\nexempted from the embargo.\n\n14. No single rule or a golden litmus test is applicable for\n\nconsideration of a bail application and instead some material\n\nprinciples/guidelines are needed to be kept in mind by the\n\nCourts and the Magistrates for consideration of a bail\n\napplication especially including:-\n\ni. The judicial discretion must be exercised with the\nutmost care and circumspection;\n\nii. That the Court must duly consider the nature and the\ncircumstances of the case;\n\niii. Reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being\ntampered;\n\niv. Investigation being hampered or\nv. The judicial process being impeded or subverted.\nvi. The liberty of an individual must be balanced against the\nlarger interests of the society and the State.\nvii. The court must weigh in the judicial scales, pros and\ncons varying from case to case.\n\nviii. Grant of bail quo an offence punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life is an exception and not the rule;\nix. The court at this stage is not conducting a preliminary\ntrial but only seeking whether there is a case to go for\ntrial;\n\nx. The nature of the charge is the vital factor, the nature of\nevidence is also pertinent, the punishment to which the\nparty may be liable also bears upon the matter and the\nlikelihood of the applicant interfering with the witnesses\nor otherwise polluting the course or justice, has also a\nbearing on the matter.\n\nxi. The facts and circumstances of the case play a predominant\nrole.\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n15. The Hon‟ble Apex Court in Gur Bakash Singh Sibbia Vs.\n\nState of Punjab AIR 1980 S.C. 1632, referred to the following\n\nextract from the American Jurisprudence having bearing on the\n\nsubject of bail,\n\n\"where the grant of bail lies within discretion of the\ncourt, granting or denial is regulated to a large extent, by the\nfacts and circumstances of each particular case. Since the object\nof detention order/imprisonment of the accused is to secure his\nappearance and submission to jurisdiction and the judgment of\nthe court, the preliminary enquiry is whether a recognizance or\nbond would yeild that end. It is thus clear that the question\nwhether to grant bail or not, depends for its answer upon a\nVariety of circumstances, the cumulative effect of which must\nenter into the judicial verdict. Any one single circumstance\ncannot be treated as of universal validity for justifying the grant\nor refusal of bail\".\n\n16. It has been laid down by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nSanjay\n\nChandra vs. Central Bureau of Investigation\nAIR 20012 SC\n\n830 at Para 14 of its Judgment as under:-\n\n14) In bail applications, generally, it has been laid\ndown from the earliest times that the object of bail is\nto secure the appearance of the accused person at his\ntrial by reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail\nis neither punitive nor preventive. Deprivation of\nliberty must be considered a punishment, unless it can\nbe required to ensure that an accused person will\nstand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more\nthan verbal respect to the principle that punishment\nbeings after conviction, and that every man is\ndeemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly\nfound guilty. From the earliest times, it was\nappreciated that detention in custody pending\ncompletion of trial could be a cause of great hardship.\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nFrom time to time, necessity demands that some un-\nconvicted persons should be held in custody pending\ntrial to secure their attendance at the trial but in\nsuch cases, necessity is the operative test. In this\ncountry, it would be quite contrary to the concept of\npersonal liberty enshrined in the Constitution that any\nperson should be punished in respect of any matter,\nupon which, he has not been convicted or that in any\ncircumstances, he should be deprived of his liberty\nupon only the belief that he will tamper with the\nwitnesses if left at liberty, save in the most\nextraordinary circumstances. Apart from the question\nof prevention being the object of a refusal of bail,\none must not lose sight of the fact that any\nimprisonment before conviction has a substantial\npunitive content and it would be improper for any\ncourt to refuse bail as a mark of disapproval of\nformer conduct whether the accused has been\nconvicted for it or not or to refuse bail to an un-\nconvicted person for the purpose of giving him a\ntaste of imprisonment as a lesson.\"\n\n17. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nDataram Singh vs State of UP and\n\nAnr.\n2018 3 SCC 22 has held that even if grant or refusal of bail is\n\nentirely the discretion of a Judge, such discretion must be exercised\n\nin a judicious manner and in a humane way observing as follows:\n\n\"2. There is no doubt that the grant or denial of bail is entirely\nthe discretion of the judge considering a case but even so, the\nexercise of judicial discretion has been circumscribed by a\nlarge number of decisions rendered by this court and by every\nHigh Court in the country. Yet, occasionally there is a necessity\nto introspect whether denying bail to an accused person is the\nright thing to do on the facts and in the circumstance of a case.\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n3. While so introspecting, among the factors that need to be\n\nconsidered is whether the accused was arrested during\ninvestigations when that person perhaps has the best\nopportunity to tamper with the evidence or influence\nwitnesses. If the investigating officer does not find it necessary\nto arrest an accused person during investigations, a strong\ncase should be made out for placing that person in judicial\ncustody after a charge-sheet is filed. Similarly, it is important\nto ascertain whether the accused was participating in the\ninvestigations to the satisfaction of the investigating officer\nand was not absconding or not appearing when required by\nthe investigating officer. Surely, if an accused is not hiding\nfrom the investigating officer or is hiding due to some genuine\nand expressed fear of being victimized, it would be a factor that\na judge would need to consider in an appropriate case. It is\nalso necessary for the judge to consider whether the accused is\na first time offender or has been accused of other offences and\nif so, the nature of such offences and his or her general\nconduct. The poverty or the deemed indigent status of an\naccused is also an extremely important factor and even\nParliament has taken notice of it by incorporating an\nExplanation to\nSection 436\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973. An equally soft approach to incarceration has been taken\nby Parliament by inserting Section 436A in the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n1973.\"\n\n18.\nIn\nPankaj Jain vs Union of India and Anr.\n2018 5 SCC 743 the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has held that the grant of bail has to be\n\nexercised compassionately. Heinousness of crime by itself cannot be\n\nthe ground to out rightly deny the benefit of bail if there are other\n\noverwhelming circumstances justifying grant of bail.\nThe Hon‟ble\n\nApex Court in its Judgments cited as Siddharam Satlingappa\n\nMhetre Vs. State of Maharastra AIR 2011 SC 312 and Sushila\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nAggarwal and Ors. Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) and Anr 2020 SC\n\nonline 98, has interpreted law even on the subject of anticipatory\n\nbail with a very wide outlook and while interpreting concept of\n\nliberty guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of our\n\nCountry in a flexible and broader sense.\n\n19. This Court is conscious of the legal position that offences under\n\nSections 376\nIPC and 4 of\nPOCSO Act\ncharged against the\n\npetitioner/accused carry a sentence of life imprisonment owing to\n\nwhich fact attraction or otherwise of the bar under Section 480 of\n\nBNSS, corresponding to Section 437 of the Code is to be addressed\n\nto. As hereinbefore mentioned, the bar imposed under Section 480\n\nof BNSS is not confined to the cases where the imprisonment for\n\nlife is provided as an alternative punishment disjunctive of death\n\npenalty. I deem it proper to reproduce the relevant extracts of the\n\npronouncements of the Hon‟ble Apex Court and also of this Court\n\nto the clarification of the issue:-\n\nGurcharan Singh & Ors. V/s State (Delhi\nAdministration) AIR 1978 SC179\n\"If a police officer arrests a person on a reasonable suspicion\nof commission of an offence punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life and forwards him to a Magistrate, the\nMagistrate at that stage will have no reason s to hold that\nthere are no reasonable grounds for believing that he has not\nbeen guilty of such an offence. At that stage, unless the\nMagistrate is able to act under the proviso to section 437 (1),\nbail appears to be out of the question. The only limited inquiry\nmay then relate to the materials for the suspicion. The position\nwill naturally change as investigation progresses and more\nfacts and circumstances come to light section 439 (1) on the\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nother hand, confers special powers on the High Court or the\ncourt of Sessions in respect of bail. Unlike under section 437\n(1) there is no ban imposed under section 439 (1) against\ngranting of bail by the High court or the Court of Sessions to\npersons accused of an offence punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life. It is, however, legitimate to suppose that\nthe High Court or the court of Sessions will be approached by\nan accused only after he has failed before the Magistrate and\nafter the investigation has progressed throwing light on the\nevidence and circumstances implicating the accused. Even the\nCourt of Sessions will have to exercise its judicial discretion in\nconsidering the question of granting of bail under section 439\n(1) The overriding considerations in granting bail which are\ncommon both in the case of section 437 (1) and section 439 (1)\nare the nature and gravity of the circumstances in which the\noffence is committed, the position and the status of the accused\nwith reference to the victim and the witnesses, the likelihood of\nthe accused fleeing from justice of repeating the offence of\njeopardizing his own life being faced with a grim prospect of\npossible conviction in the case, of tampering with witnesses,\nthe history of the case as well as of is investigation and other\nrelevant grounds which in view of so many variable factors,\ncannot be exhaustively set out. The two paramount\nconsiderations viz likelihood of the accused fleeing from\njustice and his tampering with prosecution evidence relate to\nensuring a fair trial of the case in a court of justice. It is\nessential that due and proper weight should be bestowed on\nthese two factors apart from others.\"\n\nJawahar Barwa Vs. State of J&K, 1973 JKLR 74.\n\n\"Cases are conceivable in which a person is accused of an\noffence punishable with imprisonment for life or in the\nalternative with imprisonment for a lesser term. To quote some\ninstances take for example the offences under\nsection 371\n,\nand\nIPC all of which are punishable with imprisonment\nfor life or imprisonment of either description for ten years and\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nfine. The question arises, as in fact it was raised by Mr. Beg,\nappearing for the petitioner, whether the restriction imposed\nin\nsection 497 (1)\nCr.P.C. providing that no bail should be\ngranted where there are reasonable grounds for believing that\nthe accused is guilty of an offence punishable with\nimprisonment for life, applies equally to such cases. The object\nof the law in providing an alternate punishment seems to be to\nleave room for the court to impose a lesser punishment than\nimprisonment for life where, in its opinion, there are some\nextenuating circumstances which lessen the gravity of the\noffence. As a corollary it must follow that the restriction\nimposed by section 497 (1) is not intended to cover a case\ninvolving an offence punishable with imprisonment for life and\nin the alternative imprisonment for a lesser term if there are\nextenuating circumstances which lessen the gravity of the\noffence. Even so the court may decline to enlarge the accused\non bail in such case as in other cases involving non-bailable\noffences where larger interests of the state or of the public so\ndemand or because there is reasonable possibility of the\naccused absconding or tampering with the witnesses or for\nsimilar other consideration.....\"\n\nAssadullah Khan and ors v/s State, SLJ 1980 J&K 31\n\"The very fact that an offence u/s 376 RPC was punishable\n\"with imprisonment for life or ten years\" amply makes out the\ndistinction between the categories of cases of this class and\nthose which fall within the category where punishment\nprovided is death or life imprisonment. It could not be correct\nto equate offences punishable with imprisonment for life or 10\nyears in their gravity and seriousness and in matter of bail\nwith those as are punishable either with death or\nimprisonment for life. The bar for setting out on bail was\ncomplete in respect of offences which are punishable either\nwith death or imprisonment for life. That bar in law could not\nbe extended to any other offence.\"\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nMohinder Singh v/s State, KLJ 1987 237\n\"Therefore the rule of caution for granting bail is in respect of\nany non-bailable offences which carry punishment of either\ndeath or life. The proviso, therefore, classifies the offences on\nthe basis of punishment as there are huge number of offences\nwhich are non-bailable some of them defined heinous. First\ncategory comes murder u/s 302 RPC while under section\n371,372,376,377 RPC etc. Comes later. Thus latter portion of\nclause (1)\nsection 497\nCr.P.C excludes the offences which\ncarry sentences for life or 10 years which we are concerned\nhere. The gravity of the charge under Murder is definitely\ngrave. Therefore, punishment provided iis death or life with no\nother alternative, the forceful portion of the clause 1st of\nsection 497 Cr.P.c. is, therefore, to be read in isolation while\nthe first portion of the clause (1) of\nsection 497\nCr.P.C. which\ngives a clear command as in section 498 Cr.p.c. for granting\nthe bail. But even\nu/s 498\nCr.P.C. the latter portion of the 1 st\nproviso has its play and it should be deemed a ride while\ngranting bail\nu/s 489\nCr.P.C. in non-bailable offences\ncarrying death penalty or life imprisonment. Therefore, there\nis clear distinction between offences which carry punishment\nof death or life and offense which carry life and 10 years. This\ndemarcation is very much embedded in clause (1) of\nsection\nCr.P.C. In this view of the matter. I am not at all in\nagreement with the counsel for the complainant that the life\nimprisonment provided as punishment u/s 377 RPC should be\nregarded with equal force with offences which carries the\npunishment of death penalty or life. In my opinion the offences\nu/s 371,372, 376 and 377 RPC and other carrying similar\npunishment are out of the clutches of last clause of (1) of\n\nsection 497\nCr.P.C. The bail in this case is, therefore, to be\nconsidered on its own merit without applying the rider\nindicated in clause (1) of\nsection 497\nCr.P.C.\"\n\nSatyan, Petitioner Vs State, Respondent Cr.L.J. 1981 1313\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n\"The Magistrate is not justified in holding that he has no\npower to grant bail to a person accused on the sole ground\nthat the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life.\nThe prohibition against granting bail is confined to cases\nwhere the sentence is either death or alternatively\nimprisonment for life. The expression \"offence punishable with\ndeath or imprisonment for life\" in section 437 (1) does not\nextend to offences punishable with imprisonment for life only\n(1926 27 Cr.L.J. 401 (Rang) and 1926 27 Cr.LJ 1063 (Nag)\nRe1.\n\nThe legislature has made a liberal approach in the matter of\ngranting bail and has shown its disapproval in the matter of\nkeeping an accused person in custody in cases where he is\nordinarily entitled to bail. The purpose of keeping a person in\ncustody is to ensure his appearance in court at the time of trial\nand that he is also made available for the purpose of execution\nof the sentence. The purpose is not penal in character\"\n\n20. This Court is also conscious of the fact that provisions of\nSections 29\n\nof the POCSO Act presume commission, abetment or attempt of\n\noffences defined under\nSections 3\n,\n,\nand\nof the said Act, in any\n\nprosecution against an accused for commission, abetment and\n\nattempt of said offences. The provisions of\nSection 30\nof the\n\nPOCSO Act, also presume existence of the culpable mental state of\n\nthe accused in any prosecution for any offence under the said Act,\n\nwhich requires a culpable mental state on the part of the accused.\n\nHowever, the accused‟s right in defense to prove that he had no\n\nsuch mental state with respect to the act charged as an offence is\n\nbeing protected under the provisions of the aforementioned\nSection\nof the POCSO Act.\n\n21. It is also true that as per the\nSection 31\nof the POCSO Act, the\n\nprovisions of the Code including the provisions as to bail and bonds\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nare applicable in the proceedings before a Special Court under the\n\nPOCSO Act\n.\n\n22. The presumptions under\nSections 29\nand\nof the POCSO Act are\n\nnot absolute but are rebuttable presumptions. Such provisions of the\n\nAct are to be considered at the conclusion of the trial and they do\n\nnot operate as a bar for grant of bail if there are other conditions and\n\ncircumstances which even before recording the evidence during the\n\ntrial make out a prima facie case for not relying upon and\n\nconsidering such presumptions. Such presumptions are in the form\n\nof an additional advantage to the prosecution and do not absolve the\n\nprosecution from proving the foundational facts of its case. No\n\ndoubt it is for the accused to prove his innocence after the\n\nprosecution establishes its case in terms of the foundational facts.\n\n23. The offence under\nSection 376\nIPC charged against the\n\npetitioner/accused carries a rigorous imprisonment of not less than\n\n10 years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life and with\n\nfine. The offence punishable under 4 of the\nPOCSO Act\nalso\n\ncharged against the petitioner/accused carries a maximum\n\npunishment of life imprisonment.\n\n24. So in view of the punishments provided for the offence of rape under\n\nSection 376\nIPC and for the offence of penetrative sexual assault\n\nunder\nSection 4\nof the POCSO Act, the bar created under Section\n\n480 of BNSS is not attracted.\n\n25. Admittedly, the offences charged against the petitioner/accused are\n\nheinous in nature and highly antisocial. A murderer destroys the\n\nphysical body of a victim, but a rapist destroys the very soul of the\n\nvictim. Society looks with great apathy and hatred an unchaste girl\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nand it is immaterial whether she becomes so by a voluntary act or\n\nunder force or compulsion.\n\n26. It is the admitted case of the prosecution that DNA Analysis of the\n\nvictim, the baby and the petitioner/accused has ruled out the later,\n\ni.e., petitioner as being the biological father of the baby.\n\n27. The learned counsel for the petitioner/accused, during his arguments,\n\nsubmitted that the Hon‟ble Apex Court in a Criminal Appeal No.\n\n537/2020 tiled\nJayanat Chatterjee vs. The State of West Bengal\n\nadmitted the appellant/accused therein to bail taking into\n\nconsideration the DNA Analysis report which did not show him as\n\nfather of the child born.\n\n28. The learned counsel for the respondent no. 2, in support of his\n\narguments, also relied upon the case law holding that DNA evidence\n\nshowing a lack of biological connection does not invalidate the\n\nseriousness of rape allegations or justify bail based on such evidence\n\nalone. He also submitted during his arguments that a Court has to\n\nconsider the other evidence on the record of the file and shall not\n\ndecide only on the basis of DNA Analysis report, which is never\n\n100% accurate.\n\n29. A DNA test has to be lent credibility especially after the\n\nincorporation of Section 53-A in the Code w.e.f. 23rd June, 2006,\n\nwhich has made it necessary for the prosecution to go for DNA test,\n\nin rape cases, facilitating the prosecution to prove its case against\n\nthe accused prior to 2006, the prosecution could have still resorted\n\nto this procedure of getting DNA test for making its case foolproof.\n\nThe Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nMukesh and Anr. vs. State\nfor NCT\n\nof Delhi and Ors. AIR2017 SC 2061 decided on 5th May, 2017, has\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nlaid much emphasis on the DNA Analysis being accurate as a\n\ntechnique outcome of recent scientific development. The Apex\n\nCourt in the said case has, inter alia, held at para-87 of the\n\nJudgment that DNA evidence is now a predominant forensic\n\ntechnique for identifying criminals when biological issues are left at\n\nthe scene of crime. It is profitable to reproduce the para-88 of the\n\nJudgment.\n\n88. Observing that DNA is scientifically accurate and\nexact science and that the trial court was not justified\nin rejecting DNA report, in\nSantosh Kumar Singh v.\nState\nthrough CBI (2010) 9 SCC 747, the Court held\nas under:-\n\n\"65. We now come to the circumstance with\nregard to the comparison of the semen stains with the\nblood taken from the appellant. The trial court had\nfound against the prosecution on this aspect. In this\nconnection, we must emphasis that the court cannot\nsubstitute its own opinion for that of an expert, more\nparticularly in a science such as DNA profiling which\nis a recent development.\"\n\n30. It is also true that prosecution and the complainant have right under\n\nlaw to lead evidence as against the accuracy of the DNA Analysis\n\nreport during trial of the case. However, during investigation stage\n\nor the initial trial stage, ahead of recording evidence, such analysis\n\nreport can be considered for consideration of a bail petition.\n\n31. As hereinbefore, mentioned at para-14, a series of guiding\n\nfactors/underlying principles are needed to be kept in mind while\n\nconsidering a bail application of an accused involved in non-\n\nbailable offences, regarding which there is no immediate statutory\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nbar, as in case of an offence punishable U/s 103 of BNS\n\ncorresponding to\nSection 302\nIPC or in offences punishable U/ss 19,\n\n24, 27-A and offences in relation to commercial quantities under\n\nNDPS Act\nor, in case of offences mentioned under Chapter-IV and\n\nVI, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act of 1967 etc. etc., for\n\nexercise of judicial discretion among which the factor,\n\n\"circumstances under which, offence is committed,\" also finds its\n\nplace which needs to be given due weightage.\n\n32. In the facts and circumstances of the case, especially, while\n\nconsidering the DNA Profiling report, which does not connect the\n\npetitioner with the alleged crime, and the circumstances under\n\nwhich the crime is alleged to have been committed, this Court is of\n\nthe opinion that it may meet the ends of justice in case the petitioner\n\nis admitted to bail subject to reasonable terms and conditions.\n\n33. It is very needful to mention that petitioner/accused during\n\ninvestigation of the case FIR against him preferred a petition under\n\nSection 482 of the Code being CRM (M) No. 368/2022 for\n\nquashment of the FIR mainly on the ground that he has been falsely\n\nimplicated in the case which is evident from the DNA Analysis\n\nreport which does not connect him with the alleged crime. As per\n\nthe Order dated 8th May, 2024 of this Court passed in the said\n\npetition, the Police concerned was permitted to file police\n\nreport/challan before the competent Court, but the taking of\n\ncognizance on the same has been stayed, pending further orders\n\nfrom this Court. The trial on the main criminal case/challan is\n\nneeded to be started and to be proceeded expeditiously. After all the\n\noutcome of the petition filed under Section 482 of the Code\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\npending before this Court shall have a direct bearing on the trial of\n\nthe criminal case.\n\n34. For the foregoing reasons and discussion, the instant application is\n\nallowed and the petitioner/accused is admitted to bail subject to his\n\nfurnishing personal and surety bonds each in the amount of Rs.\n\n50,000/- for complying with the conditions of this order. The\n\nsurety/bail bond shall be furnished to the satisfaction of the learned\n\nTrial Court. The bail order shall, however, be subject to the\n\nfollowing conditions:-\n\na) The petitioner/accused shall remain punctual at the\n\ntrial of the case.\n\nb) The petitioner/accused shall not directly or indirectly,\n\nmake any inducement, threat or promise to the\n\nprosecution witnesses especially the prosecutrix so as\n\nto dissuade them from making their statements at the\n\ntrial of the case.\n\nc) The petitioner/accused shall not leave the limits of the\n\nJammu, Division of the Union Territory of J&K\n\nwithout the prior permission of the learned Trial\n\nCourt and shall not repeat the commission of crime.\n\n35. In case the requisite surety/bail bond is furnished and attested, the\n\nlearned trial court shall issue a formal release order directing the\n\nSuperintendent of the concerned Jail, where the petitioner is lodged,\n\nto release him from the custody in the instant case subject to the\n\nfurnishing of his requisite personal bond to the satisfaction of\n\nSuperintendent of the concerned jail.\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n36. The observations in this order have been so made for the limited\n\npurposes of disposal of this bail application filed under Section 483\n\nof BNSS [439 of the Code] and shall not be construed as any\n\ninterference or prejudging of the merits of the case, to be decided at\n\nthe conclusion of the trial.\n\n37. The learned Registrar Judicial, Jammu, shall take necessary steps for\n\ngetting the pending petition under Section 482 of the Code being\n\nCRM(M) No. 368/2022 titled\nPawan Kumar Vs. UT of JK and\n\nAnr\n, specially assigned expeditious speedy disposal thereof to an\n\nappropriate Bench of this Court under the orders of Hon‟ble the\n\nChief Justice, provided the same is not already disposed of. The\n\npendency of the said petition has halted the trial of the criminal case\n\nagainst the petitioner/accused, who is alleged to have committed the\n\nserious offences punishable under\nSections 376\nIPC, 4 of\nPOCSO\n\nAct\n, being against the society. The petitioner/accused may not be\n\ninterested in the speedy disposal of the said petition, which has\n\nhalted the trial of the main criminal case.\n\n38. The learned Trial Court shall, notwithstanding the pendency of the\n\naforesaid petition under Section 482 of the Code before this Court,\n\nin which, by Order dated 8th May, 2024, the cognizance on the\n\ncriminal case has been barred till further orders of this Court,\n\ncontinue to list the same [criminal case/challan] without any\n\neffective proceedings till and subject to disposal of the petition\n\n(refer to order dated 8th May, 2024 passed therein) with short\n\nadjournments, not exceeding 15 days and ensure the presence of the\n\npetitioner/accused at the trial with liberty to proceed under the\n\nprovisions of Sections 491,492 of BNSS, corresponding to Sections\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\n446, 446-A of the Code, in case of t he absconding at the trial of the\n\npetitioner/accused.\n\n39. Before parting, it is felt needful to observe that sometimes self\n\ninduced environment, life situation, opportunity, fear, helplessness\n\nand undue influence compels a girl child to fall an easy prey to the\n\nsexual assault.\n\n40. The prosecutrix alongwith her sisters and brother was putting up in\n\nthe house of the petitioner/accused since the time her parents were\n\nalive. After the death of the parents of the prosecutrix, none of her\n\nrelatives came forward to own her and her other sisters. The\n\npetitioner/accused had an opportunity to do the illegal act. The\n\nprosecutrix being a minor child is supposed to be an unaware of the\n\nconsequences of the act allegedly committed in relation to her. The\n\nsituations are different where the illegal acts are being committed\n\nby persons having an entrustment or custody of females in their\n\nresponsible capacities as public servants.\n\n41. Some bare minimum preventive measures in aid of law need to be\n\ntaken by the prudent parents and guardians in respect of their\n\nchildren/wards to save them from exploitation on account of their\n\nvulnerability based on infancy, immaturity, bonafide belief, fear,\n\nreputation etc. etc. Sometimes children are thrown voluntarily by\n\ntheir parents and guardians in exploitation prone environment\n\nunmindful of the consequences. No doubt the law enforcing\n\nagencies are always at high alert but the criminal minded always\n\nfind an opportunity to commit crime. The chastity of a girl is of\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\npredominating factor in the matter of her marriage. The society\n\nlooks up with apathy, abhorrence and hatred to an unchaste girl\n\nand this includes the girl ravished by force or under compulsion.\n\nMost of the incidents relating to sex offences are not at all reported\n\nto the police. The court cannot loose sight of the fact that in sexual\n\noffences, the failure to report the incident to the police can be due\n\nto a variety of reasons particularly due to reluctance of the\n\nprosecutrix and her family members go to the police and complain\n\nabout incident which concerns the reputation of the prosecutrix and\n\nthe honour of the family members. It is only upon a cool thought\n\nthat a complaint of sex offences is generally lodged. In the present\n\nsociety and more particularly in conservative villages, the chastity\n\nof a girl is of a great importance for her matrimonial relations.\n\n42. A little bit reasonable care and precaution in aid of law is sure to\n\nprevent an unfortunate incident of exploitation and save honour and\n\nreputation of a child. The long penal provisions containing Proviso\n\nupon Proviso cannot repair and restore the loss in terms of honour\n\nand reputation. No doubt our Parliament upon taking a serious note\n\nof the incidents of rape and gang-rape of women under the age 16\n\nyears and 12 years, has made suitable amendments in the Penal\n\nLaws and also legislated special Acts for protection of children from\n\nsexual offences so as to generate an environment of deterrence by\n\nproviding stringent punishments.\nArticle 15\nof our Constitution\n\ninter alia confers upon the State powers to make special provisions\n\nfor children. Further\nArticle 39\ninter alia provides that the State\n\nshall in particular direct its policy towards securing that tender age\n\nof the children is not abused and their childhood and youth is\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\nprotected against an exploitation and they are given facilities to\n\ndevelop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and\n\ndignity.\n\n43. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Children,\n\nratified by India on 11th Dec. 1992, requires the State Parties to\n\nundertake all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral\n\nmeasures to prevent the inducement or coercion of a child to\n\nengage in any unlawful sexual activity.\n\n44. The prosecutrix and her other minor sisters being orphans were\n\nliving in the home of petitioner/accused even after death of their\n\nparents and their relatives did not bother to come to their rescue.\n\nEven the authorities under the\nJuvenile Justice (Care and\n\nProtection of Children) Act\n2015 (hereinafter for short referred to\n\nas the Act) fail to act in respect of the said children in accordance\n\nwith the provisions of Chapter-VI and VII of the aforesaid Act and\n\nthe rules framed there under. Guilty are liable for penalty U/s 34 of\n\nthe Act for non reporting. Concerned Child Welfare Committee(s)\n\nshall in a discreet manner swing into action, verify the present\n\nposition of the prosecutrix/respondent No.2 and her minor sisters\n\nand brother and press into the service the measures for their\n\nrehabilitation and social re-integration if needed in consultation\n\nwith their relatives.\n\n45. The learned Trial Court shall verify as to whether an application by\n\nor on behalf of the prosecutrix/respondent no. 2 for award of\n\ncompensation under Victim Compensation Scheme in force stands\n\nfiled and processed. In case such an application is not found to have\n\nbeen filed, the learned Trial Court shall take necessary steps in\n\nBail App. No. 150/2024\ncoordination with the District Legal Service Authority, Jammu, so\n\nthat the entitlement of the prosecutrix to compensation under Victim\n\nCompensation Scheme is addressed to at an earliest.\n\n46.
