She never complaint to her \n\nagainst her inlaws. She had not seen accused Jatin at her parents \n\nhouse. She had delivered a baby about 5/6 months back. \n\n34. In the overall analysis of the testimonies of all the PWS, \n\nit is revealed that PW5 Sushila is the mother, PW6 Maya Devi is \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 18 of 75\n\n the dadi, PW7 Satbir Singh is the father of the deceased \n\nSucheta@Jyoti and PW14 Ravi Jain is the neighbourer/public \n\nwitness, PW16 S.M. Sehgal is the witness who sold scooter to \n\nSatbir. These witnesses including PW19, Sh Surender Singh, the \n\nthen SDM are the main star witnesses of the prosecution. PW5,6& \n\n7 the near relatives of deceased Sucheta @ Jyoti. Before \n\ndiscussing their deposition made in the court and to bring home the \n\nguilt of the accused persons\n u/s 498A\n/\n304B\n IPC it is necessary to \n\ndiscuss the relevant provisions. \nSection 304B\n relates to dowry \n\ndeath. The same was introduced in the \nIndian Penal Code\n and it \n\nreads as under:­\n\nSec.304 B (1)\n\n Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily \n injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances \n within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon \n before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by \n her husband or any relative of her husband for or in connection \n with any demands for dowry such death shall be called dowry \n death and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have \n caused her death. \n\n For the purpose of this sub section dowry shall have the same \n meaning as in \nsection 2\n of the dowry prohibition Act 1961. \n\n 'Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with \n imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 7 years but \n which may extend to imprisonment for life'. \n\n And if the ingredients of \nsection 304B\n have been completed then \n the presumption u/s 113 B in the Indian Evidence Act is \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 19 of 75\n\n required.\n\nSection 113 B\n\n Presumption as to dowry death ­ when the question whether a \n person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is \n shown that soon before her death such woman had been \n subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for or in \n connection with any demand for dowry, the court shall presume \n that such person had caused the dowry death. \n\n In a case of dowry death cruelty on part of husband towards his \n wife by prosecution has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt \n and \nsection 113 B \nof Evidence Act does not alter this \n requirement of stick proof.\n\nSection 498 A \nIPC reads as under:­\n\n 'Husband or relatives of husband of a woman subjecting her to \n cruelty - Whoever being the husband or the relative of the \n husband or a woman subjects such woman to cruelty shall be \n punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to \n three years and shall be liable to fine'. \n\n There is explanation for the purpose of this section \n\ncruelty means:­\n\n (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to \n drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or \n danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical ) of \n the woman or \n\n (b) Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a \n view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any \n unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on \n account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet \n such demand.\n\n35. From the conjoint reading of \nsection 304B\n of the IPC and \nSec. \n\n113B\n of the Indian Evidence Act, it is apparent that a presumption arising \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 20 of 75\n\n thereunder will operate if the prosecution is able to establish the circumstances \n\nas set out in \nSec.304B\n of IPC. The ingredients of the aforementioned \n\nprovisions are :­\n\n 1. That the death of the woman caused by any burns or bodily injury or in \n some circumstances which is not normal;\n\n 2. Such death occurs within 7 years from the date of her marriage\n\n 3. That the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband \n or any relative of her husband\n\n 4. Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with demand \n of dowry and \n\n 5. Such cruelty and harassment was made soon before her death.\n \n\n36. In the normal circumstances though cruelty at any time \n\nafter marriage may cause depression in the mind of the victim, the \n\ncruelty and harassment envisaged in section 304B is to be seen \n\nbefore the death of a woman and it is the duty of the court to \n\nscrutinize the evidence carefully because cases are not rare in \n\nwhich occasionally there is demand and then the atmosphere \n\nbecomes calm and quiet and then again there is demand. Where a \n\nwife dies in the house of the husband within the short span of seven \n\nyears of her marriage, it is of considerable difficulty to assess the \n\nprecise circumstances in which the incident occurred because \n\nordinarily independent witnesses are not available as the torture \n\nand harassment is confined within the four walls of the house. \n\nHowever, the courts are to be vigilant to scrutinize the evidence \n\nregarding the harassment and torture carefully if the witnesses are \n\nrelatives of the deceased and relations between them and her in \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 21 of 75\n\n laws are strained for any reason whatsoever it might be. \n\n37. Urge for living is a natural phenomenon in mankind. A \n\nperson would not embrace death unless there is some psychological \n\ntrouble or mental agony or such circumstances that the person \n\ncommitting suicide may think that the life he or she is living is \n\nmore miserable than the pangs and agony of death. The power of \n\ntolerance would vary from person to person. Some persons try to \n\nmake the life easy by tolerance while others even on petty points \n\nbring an end to their life. \n\n38. Reverting back to the testimonies of witnesses, firstly I \n\nwould consider the testimonies of the witnesses adduced by the \n\nprosecution who are related to deceased Sucheta @Jyoti. PW1 \n\nSmt. Sushila who is the mother of deceased and complainant in \n\nthis case has deposed that Sucheta was married to Bhagat Singh on \n\n18.05.2008. Five/Six months before marriage accused Bhagat Singh \n\nhad allured her daughter and took her away and case was \n\nregistered. Thereafter they solemnized the marriage with the \n\nintervention of members of the society and they had given various \n\nhousehold articles, gold and Rs.21,000/­. After ¾ days of marriage \n\nher daughter came to her house and told that her inlaws were \n\nexpecting more dowry.

She has further stated that \n\nafter about one month a sum of Rs.1.00 lac was withdrawn from the \n\naccount of her husband which she alongwith her husband had given \n\nto accused Bhagat Singh at his house. She has further stated that \n\nafter about 2 months, her daughter told her on telephone that her \n\nsister in law Jatin had come from her matrimonial house and she \n\nalong with her mother in law were harassing her by saying that her \n\nfather was having two vehicles and they could not afford to give a \n\nscooter to them. Her husband arranged for an old scooter from an \n\nacquittance of his in office and gave the same to Bhagat Singh after \n\ntwo/two and half months of marriage. After ¾ months of marriage \n\ndeceased came to their house and she was quite disturbed and when \n\nshe insisted she told her that her sister in law had delivered a son \n\nand that her mother in law, brother in law Birju @ Brij Mohan and \n\nher husband had been harassing her since morning and told her to \n\nbring RS.20,000/­ from her parents for giving chhuchak to her \n\nsister in law. At that time they gave Rs.12,000/­ to Jyoti and Bhagat \n\nSingh who had come to their house in the evening again said the \n\nsaid amount was given to Bhagat Singh. Whenever Jyoti \n\ncomplained, she tried to make Bhagat Singh understand and also \n\ntold him that it was is duty to make her happy.

Deceased further told her that \n\nJitin had threatened her that she would not be allowed to live \n\npeacefully till the aforesaid demand is fulfilled. She told that they \n\nwill see to fulfill this demand. She has stated that before 6.12.08 \n\nshe alongwith her husband visited the house of accused and told \n\nthat they should not harass their daughter and everything would be \n\nfine in due course of time. After 6.12.08 when her daughter went \n\nback, she had no talk with her.

She also did not make any call to \n\nhim thereafter. On the intervening night of 9/10.12.08 around 2 a.m \n\none Jain Sweet maker who runs his shop near the matrimonial \n\nhouse of her daughter came alongwith one person on motorcycle to \n\ntheir house and informed them that their daughter is in serious \n\ncondition and he did not disclose what had happened.

There was no demand \n\nfrom the side of accused persons at the time of marriage of his \n\ndaughter with accused and whatever he had given, was given out of \n\nhis own free will. He had not informed any member of society, \n\nmediator/members of biradari or his relatives except his mother that \n\nhis daughter was being harassed by accused persons for demand of \n\ndowry. She does not know if his daughter has stated before the \n\ncourt that she was happily living with accused. He admitted that she \n\nand his wife had stated before the court that their daughter was \n\nmarried to accused and was living happily with him. He came back \n\nto the matrimonial home of Sucheta at about 4 a.m on 10.12.08 \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 35 of 75\n\n from the hospital and stayed for 10­15 minutes. Again he went on \n\n10.12.2008 and reached at about 9.30­10 a.m. He admitted that the \n\nshop of Jain Sweets is situated near the house of Bhagat Singh. He \n\nhad not narrated the entire facts in his statement to SDM vol. he had \n\nonly given his statement in brief. He admitted that account number \n\n10469779033 of SBI is in the name of his company Kapil \n\nFurnitures. He had never informed the police nor the SDM that he \n\nhad withdrawn Rs.2.50 lacs from his account on 18.6.08. He does \n\nnot recollect that the amount of Rs.1.00 lac, 1.50 lac withdrawn by \n\nhim on different dates as shown in the statement Ex.PW7/A were \n\nwithdrawn for what purpose. Accused Bhagat Singh was not \n\npossessing any driving licence. Accused Bhagat Singh had \n\npurchased goods for his cycle shop for RS.50,000/­ to Rs.60,000/­ \n\napprox. He had not stated in his statement recorded by the police or \n\nby Sh Surender Singh that accused used to sell cycles at his shop. A \n\nson was born to accused Jatin before Dusshera in the year 2008. He \n\ndoes not know as to after how many days, accused Jain came to her \n\nparental home after the birth of her son. He had not gone to the \n\nhouse of accused Jatin when a son was born to her. None from her \n\nfamily had gone to meet Jatin when she came to her parental home \n\nafter birth of her son. The chhuchhak was given to accused Jatin by \n\nher parents after the birth of her son in Sept. 2008. He did not state \n\nin his statement that his daughter called him on phone regarding \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 36 of 75\n\n demand of Rs.20000/­ for chhuchhak. He made various \n\nimprovements in his statement. He know that on the night of \n\n9/10.12.2008 accused persons alongwith her daughter had gone to \n\nattend some marriage and he was told by his daughter that they \n\nwere to attend the said marriage which was in their relation. He was \n\ntold by Bhagat Singh that his daughter had gone to pick up the dry \n\nclothes from the roof and she had fallen from there. He denied the \n\nsuggestion that his daughter was never harassed or tortured by \n\naccused for demand of dowry and no demand as alleged has been \n\nraised He admitted that Ex.PW16/A and B were filled in his \n\nhandwriting. He admitted that some of the contents of Ex.PW16/B \n\nand his signatures on it are in different ink. He denied the \n\nsuggestion and Ex.PW16/A &B are false and fabricated documents. \n\nAt the time of the sale/purchase of the scooter no receipt of \n\npayment was executed. \n\n41. It is noted from the statements of all these three main \n\nstar witnesses that they were declared hostile by the prosecution on \n\nsome material points and cross examined by the Ld. APP for the \n\nState and then they admitted the suggestions put in affirmative by \n\nthe Ld. APP for the State. However, PW19 Sh Surender Singh the \n\nthen Executive Magistrate has recorded the statements of PW5 \n\nSmt. Sushila (Complainant) and PW7 Satbir Singh and on the basis \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 37 of 75\n\n of statement of PW5, the present case was registered. I have given \n\nmy thoughtful consideration on the statement of complainant PW5 \n\nSushila (mother of deceased) and PW7 Satbir Singh (Father of \n\ndeceased). It is necessary to reproduce the same.\n\n Statement/Vyan \n\n 'mai Sushila w/o Sh Satbir Singh r/o RZF 905/8 Raj \n Nagar Part­II, Palam Colony, New Delhi vyan deti \n hu ki mai divangat Sucheta @ Jyoti ki maa hu. \n\n Maine apni Ladki ki shadi Bhagat Singh s/o Late Sh. \n Lal Chand ke saath dinak 18.5.08 ko Hindu riti se \n yathashakti daan dahej se ki thi.

Both the above statements were recorded by SDM on \n\n11.12.08. These were the first/initial statements of the parents of \n\nthe deceased. Considering these statements, it is manifest that there \n\nare contradictory versions of the parents of deceased. Sushila has \n\nstated that she had given Rs.1.50 lacs while Satbir has not stated \n\nanything in this respect. He only stated that he provided material \n\nfor shop worth Rs. 1.00 lac. He has not stated about giving of Rs.\n\n50,000/­ by his wife. Satbir has stated that his daughter told him \n\nthat they are under debt of Rs.1.00 lac while his wife Sushila has \n\ngiven different version. Sushila did not corroborate the version of \n\nSatbir that only once there was difference between Bhagat Singh \n\nand Sucheta. The statements were the first/initial statements. It is on \n\nrecord in the statement of PW19 Sh Surender Singh that he had \n\nrequested them to give their statements however they refused and \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 40 of 75\n\n stated that they were disturbed due to the death of their daughter \n\nand would give their statements next day. Further PW22 ASI \n\nKhajan Singh in cross examination voluntarily stated that the \n\nrelatives of parents of Sucheta who had also accompanied them \n\nwere not willing for taking of any legal action against the in­laws of \n\nSucheta. PW17 IO/SI Rajender S Gurjar has stated in cross \n\nexamination that the parents of deceased Sucheta were called in the \n\nPS by him but they refused to give any statement. He and the \n\nExecutive Magistrate did not reduce this fact in writing that the \n\nparents of deceased were not willing to give statement on that day. \n\n43. However, firstly I have considered the evidence for the \n\ncharge framed\n u/s 498A\n/\n304B\n/\n34\n IPC. Taking into consideration \n\nthe deposition made in the court and above initial statements of \n\nPW5&7, it is revealed that PW5 Sushila who is the mother of \n\ndeceased Sucheta has stated that they gave double bed, almirah, \n\ndressing table, utensil, jewellery,clothes, watch and Rs.21000/­ in \n\nthe marriage. PW7 Satbir has also stated about giving dowry \n\narticles in marriage. The said articles were given by them to their \n\ndaughter in marriage as per their own wish.\n\n44. PW5 has further stated that after ¾ days of marriage, \n\ndeceased came and told that her in laws were expecting more \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 41 of 75\n\n dowry and PW7 has also stated that after 2/3 days of marriage of \n\nhis daughter, she came to his house in disturbed condition and told \n\nthat she was being harassed by her husband and in­laws and they \n\nwere expecting more dowry. It is admitted fact that the marriage \n\nbetween accused Bhagat Singh and Sucheta was a love marriage. It \n\nis also admitted fact that before marriage they both eloped and case \n\nFIR no.913/07 was registered in which later on accused Bhagat \n\nSingh was acquitted. In the said case deceased as well as PW Satbir \n\nand PW Sushila were also examined and they have stated that \n\nSucheta is living happily with accused Bhagat Singh. The said FIR \n\nwas decided on 31.05.08. Further PW6 Maya, dadi (grand mother) \n\nof Sucheta has stated that she again came to Delhi at the time of \n\nmarriage of Sucheta with accused Bhagat and stayed for 2/3 days. \n\nShe had not visited the matrimonial house of her grand daughter \n\nduring this period. During the said period Sucheta had not visited \n\nher parents house. Therefore, the said allegation cannot sustain. \n\n45. PW5 has further stated in continuation to her statement \n\nthat when Sucheta came after ¾ days of marriage she told her that \n\naccused Bhagat Singh had asked her to bring Rs.1.00 - Rs.1.50 lac \n\nfrom them so that he could put some articles in his cycle shop to \n\nearn better livelihood. PW7 Satbir Singh has stated that after one \n\nmonth of her visit, she made call to his wife and asked that Bhagat \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 42 of 75\n\n Singh is demanding Rs.1.00 lac for business. Firstly PW5 Sushila \n\nhas stated that she asked for the said amount after ¾ days of \n\nmarriage while PW7 has stated that it was asked after about one \n\nmonth. Secondly, if it is presumed that the said amount was asked, \n\nit was not as dowry but as admitted by PW7, it was for business \n\npurpose. PW5 has stated that her daughter told that Bhagat Singh \n\nasked for Rs.1.00 /1.50 lac while PW7 has stated that Rs.1.00 lac \n\nwas asked. \n\n46. PW5 Sushila has further stated that after about one \n\nmonth a sum of Rs.1.00 lac was withdrawn from the account of her \n\nhusband which she alongwith her husband had given to accused \n\nBhagat Singh at his house in the presence of his mother and \n\nthereafter they lived peacefully for sometime. PW7 Satbir has \n\nstated that on 18.6.08 he withdraw Rs.1.00 lac and paid the same to \n\nBhagat Singh. He again said after seeing the entry of bank record, \n\nRs.2,50,000/­ was withdrawn by him out of which Rs.1.00 lac were \n\ngiven to Bhagat Singh and Rs.1,50,000/­ were kept for business. \n\nPW5 has herself given contradictory version as in her initial \n\nstatement she has stated that Rs.1.00 lac was given by her husband \n\nand Rs.50,000/­ was given by her. Further PW7 has never stated \n\nthis fact before SDM that he had given Rs.1.00 lac after \n\nwithdrawing from his bank but to the contrary he has stated that he \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 43 of 75\n\n provided articles for shop worth Rs.1.00 lac. The prosecution has \n\nalso examined PW3 Sh Vipin Adlakha from SBI where account of \n\nM/s Kapil Furniture is maintained as the money of Rs.2,50,000/­ \n\nwas withdrawn from the said account on 18.6.2008. I have perused \n\nthe statement Ex.PW3/A. It is admitted fact that this is a current \n\naccount maintained for business purpose. On perusal of the entries, \n\nit is revealed that an amount of Rs.1,50,000/­ was withdrawn on \n\n3.6.08, Rs.1.00 lac each were withdrawn on 7.6.08 and 9.6.08, Rs, \n\n2,50,000/­ was withdrawn on 18.6.2008 and Rs.1,00,000/­ was \n\nwithdrawn on 30.6.08. There is no mention that an amount of Rs.\n\n1.00 lac was given to accused Bhagat Singh out of Rs.2,50,000/­ on \n\nany document. PW5 in cross examination has stated that her \n\nhusband had handed over Rs.2.00 lac to her after withdrawal of the \n\nmoney from the bank, however she is not aware about the exact \n\namount withdrawn by him on that day. PW20 IO Insp.SS Rathi has \n\nstated that he had not verified about the various payments made \n\nfrom the account of Satbir Singh to various parties. A question was \n\nput to PW5 Sushila during cross examination which is as under:\n\nQuestion: I put it to you that in your statement recorded on \n8.11.2010 in the court, you had stated that after about one month of \nmarriage a sum of Rs.one lac was withdrawn from the account of \nyour husband which you alongwith your husband had given to \naccused Bhagat Singh and today you have stated that your husband \nhad given to you Rs.Two lac after withdrawing the said amount \nfrom the bank and out of which Rs.1.00 had been given to accused \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 44 of 75\n\n Bhagat Singh. Which of your two statements is correct.\n\nAnswer: My statement recorded today is correct.\n\n47. The witness has made contradictory statement regarding \n\ngiving of Rs.1.00 lac to accused Bhagat Singh. It seems that the \n\nplea for giving a sum of Rs.1.00 lac was taken after thought just for \n\nthe sake of plea as PW7 has stated in his initial statement that he \n\nprovided goods to accused for shop and never stated that he had \n\never given Rs.1.00 lac in cash. \n\n48. PW5 has further stated that after two months her daughter \n\ntold her that her mother in law and nanad Jeetin were harassing her \n\nby saying that her father was having two vehicles and they could \n\nnot afford to given even a scooter to them and at this her husband \n\narranged a scooter and gave to Bhagat Singh. Admittedly they did \n\nnot demand scooter. PW7 Satbir Singh has stated that after about \n\n2/3 months, accused Bhagat Singh had made a call to him and told \n\nher to talk to his daughter Sucheta. He was told by Jyoti that \n\naccused Bhagat was quarreling with her for demand of some more \n\nmoney and she further told him that Bhagat Singh was telling that \n\nthey had two cars and motorcycle and that they should give a new \n\nscooter or motorcycle to him. PW7 has not specified as to how \n\nmuch more money was demanded by accused Bhagat Singh. He has \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 45 of 75\n\n further stated that he purchased a old scooter form SM Sehgal and \n\ngave it to Bhagat Singh. The prosecution has examined PW16 S.M \n\nSehgal who has stated that he sold his scooter for Rs.10,000/­ to \n\nSatbir Singh in the month of August and a sale letter was executed. \n\nIt was observed by the court that there is no document on record \n\nand there is no evidence that any such document was seized during \n\ninvestigation. During the examination of this witness, original \n\ndocuments i.e. form no.29 & 30 were produced by PW Satbir to \n\nwhich Ld. Defence counsel raised objection regarding authenticity \n\nof documents and manipulation during investigation and it was to \n\nbe decided at final stage. The photocopy of form no.29 and form \n\nno.30 are Ex.PW16/A and B. RC of the scooter is Ex.PW7/C and \n\nwitness identified the scooter Ex.P3. His statement was not \n\nrecorded by the police. He was also declared hostile by the \n\nprosecution and he denied the suggestion of Ld. APP that he has \n\nstated to the police that in the month of July/August 2008 Satbir \n\nSingh came and told him that he wanted to give a 2nd hand scooter \n\nto his son in law and further told if any 2nd hand scooter for sale is \n\nin his knowledge to which he replied that he would given his own \n\nscooter to him. Pw16 has specifically denied that Satbir Singh came \n\nto him for purchase of scooter for his son inlaw. In cross \n\nexamination he has stated that he had not issued receipt regarding \n\nthe payment which he had received from Satbir Singh against the \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 46 of 75\n\n scooter. The letter of sale Ex.PW16/A was brought by Satbir Singh \n\nand it was already filled by him. He never had any document to \n\nshow that he had sold the scooter to Satbir Singh. I have perused \n\nthe documents for which the Ld. Defence counsel raised objection \n\nduring examination of PW16. It is on record that these documents \n\nwere not seized by the police during the investigation of this case. \n\nThe same were never produced by PW7 to the police during \n\ninvestigation. PW20 IO/Insp. SS Rathi has stated that on 26.2.09 he \n\nseized the photocopy of RC of scooter no. DL L9SF 4618 already \n\nEx.PW7/C from Satbir Singh vide memo Ex.PW7/D. Admittedly \n\nthe RC of scooter was recovered from PW7 Satbir which clearly \n\nindicate that the scooter would also have been in his possession. \n\nFurther, seizure memo Ex.PW20/D shows that the scooter \n\nalongwith other articles were recovered by PW20 alleging that \n\nthese are dowry articles. Copy of RC shows that the scooter is in \n\nthe name of PW16 S.M.Sehgal. Had the scooter in question was \n\ngiven to accused Bhagat Singh, the RC of the same should also \n\nhave been recovered from him. But to the contrary, it was \n\nrecovered from PW7 Satbir. As admitted by PW7, Bhagat Singh \n\nwas not possessing any driving licence. The form no.29&30 were \n\nnever produced during investigation by PW Satbir to the Police. \n\nPW16 has denied the suggestion of Ld. APP for the State that \n\nSatbir told him that he took scooter to be given to his son­in­law. \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 47 of 75\n\n Even had no document to show that he had sold the said scooter. \n\nTherefore the authenticity of these documents are doubtful and it \n\ncould not be established that the scooter in question was given by \n\nPW7 Satbir Singh to accused Bhagat Singh.\n\n49. Another allegation levelled by PW5 in her statement \n\nrecorded before the court is that after ¾ months her daughter came \n\nin disturbed condition and told that her mother in law, brother in \n\nlaw, husband are harassing and told her to bring Rs.20,000/­for \n\ngiving chhuchhak to Jeetin. They gave Rs.12,000/­ to Jyoti and \n\nBhagat Singh who had come to their house in the evening. PW7 \n\nSatbir has stated that his daughter had called him and his wife that \n\nChuchak is to be given to Jeetin and Bhagat Singh demanded Rs.\n\n20,000/­ and when his daughter called him on his mobile phone \n\nregarding this demand he told her to talk to his wife. His wife called \n\nhim up on the same day and informed about demand of Rs.20,000/­. \n\nPW5 has not stated that her daughter (since deceased) talked on \n\nphone on that day and demanded the said amount. PW7 has stated \n\nthat an amount of Rs.12,000/­ was given by his wife from her cloth \n\nshop to Bhagat Singh while PW5 has stated that it was given by \n\nthem. Further as per the deposition of PWs, this amount was given \n\nfor chuchak which cannot be termed as demand of dowry. \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 48 of 75\n\n 50. PW7 Satbir has further alleged that his daughter called \n\nhim up on phone and told him that Jatin used to tell his daughter \n\nthat they had two cars and at atleast they should arrange one car for \n\naccused Bhagat Singh for his livelihood. He was told about this fact \n\nby his wife. On perusal of the testimony of PW5 Sushila, wife of \n\nPW7, it is revealed that she did not state about arranging of car by \n\naccused Jatin for accused Bhagat Singh. Further, this fact is also not \n\nfound mention in initial statement recorded by Executive \n\nMagistrate.\n\n51. PW5 Sushila has stated that on 6.12.08, Jyoti came in \n\ndisturbed condition and on enquiry she told to her and her husband \n\nthat her in laws are harassing her since morning and given beating \n\nand asked to bring Rs.1.00/1.50 lac to clear the debt of Bhagat \n\nSingh so that the creditor do not visit their house. She has further \n\nstated that Jatin extended threatening that if the demand is not \n\nfulfilled she would not be allowed to live peacefully and after \n\n6.12.08 when her daughter went back to her matrimonial house she \n\nhad not talk with her. PW7 Satbir has stated that on 6.12.2008 in \n\nthe morning his daughter alone came in rickshaw to his house and \n\ntold that she was being harassed by her mother in law and husband \n\nand she was sent back after she was pacified. In answer to court \n\nquestion he has stated that she had only told them that she was \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 49 of 75\n\n being harassed by her mother in law and husband but did not \n\ndisclose as to how she was being harassed. Both the PWs have \n\nmade contradictory version regarding the allegations as PW5 has \n\nstated that her daughter told that since morning she is being given \n\nbeating and asked to bring Rs.1.00/1.50 lac while PW7 Satbir who \n\nis her father has not alleged any such demand in his statement. As \n\nfar as the allegation for beating since morning is concerned, this \n\ndoes not inspire confidence as no parents will send back the \n\ndaughter after pacifying has she been given beatings since morning. \n\nFurther, there is no MLC on record showing that such beatings \n\nwere given. Had the beatings were given since morning, she would \n\ndefinitely have injury/marks on her body which would have been \n\nclear from MLC. But in this case no MLC is on record. Further, \n\nthere is no allegation made by PW5&7 that deceased Sucheta was \n\never given beatings before 6.12.08. There is also no complaint filed \n\non record regarding harassment meted to Sucheta. PW7 has clearly \n\nstated that Sucheta did not disclosed as to how she was being \n\nharassed on 6.12.08. PW5 has stated that before 6.12.08 she \n\nalongwith her husband had visited the house of accused and had \n\ntold them that they should not harass Sucheta and after 6.12.08 \n\nwhen her daughter went back she had no talk with her. Had the \n\ndeceased stated about the treatment meted to Sucheta on 6.12.08 as \n\nalleged by PW5, she would have definitely talked to her after \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 50 of 75\n\n 6.12.08 but there is no evidence on record that she had ever talked \n\nto her in between 6.12.08 to 09.12.2008. There is also nothing on \n\nrecord that the deceased had given a call to her parents on \n\n09.12.2008. It is admitted fact that on the night of incident accused \n\nalongwith deceased had gone to attend a marriage and after \n\nreturning from there, the present case incident had taken place. \n\nFurther the house of PW5&7 and matrimonial house of Sucheta is \n\nat the distance of about one km as admitted by PW7 even that \n\nneither PW5 nor PW7 had tried to visit the house of deceased \n\nSucheta after 6.12.08 as to why she was being given maltreatment. \n\nBoth the PW have alleged that the deceased was being harassed \n\nfrom the day of her marriage for more dowry. But they did not take \n\nany step to lodge complaint with the police or settle the matter by \n\nthe intervention of respectables. As per version of PW5, the amount \n\nof Rs.1.00/1.50 lac was demanded to clear the debit of Bhagat \n\nSingh so that creditors do not visit their house. It is manifest that it \n\nwas not a demand for dowry but it was to clear the debt. A \n\nquestion was put by the Ld. APP after declaring him hostile which \n\nis as under:­\n\nQuestion: I put it to you that in your examination dated 22.1.2011 \nyou had stated that on 6.12.2008 in the morning your daughter \nalone came to your house in rickshaw and told you that she was \nbeing harassed by her husband and mother in law and that she was \nsent back after she was pacified and that you also could not explain \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 51 of 75\n\n to the court as to how she was being harassed by her mother in law \nand husband and that the said statement of your is incorrect?\n\nAnswer: It is correct that my above statement referred above in my \nexamination in chief is incorrect. My statement recored today \nregarding the incident dated 6.12.2008 is correct. Due to tension, I \ncould not give correct statement on 22.1.2011. \n\n52. It seems that this question was put by the Ld. APP, \n\nonly just to fill up lacunae while the witness has clearly admitted \n\nthat on 22.1.2011 when his examination in chief was recorded he \n\ndid not depose correctly. There is no evidence for any demand of \n\ndowry between 6.12.08 to 9.12.2008 and no maltreatment was \n\nreport by deceased to her parents during this period. Had there been \n\nany such demand or maltreatment, she would have also faced the \n\nsame during these days and consequently she would have reported \n\nthe same to her parents. But this aspect is missing. The version of \n\nPW5 Sushila and PW7 Satbir regarding the incident of 6.12.2008 \n\nis also an improved version as it does not find mention in the \n\ninitial statement recorded by the Executive Magistrate. \n\n53. The prosecution has also examined PW6 Maya Devi \n\nwho is the dadi of deceased. She has stated that after marriage \n\nwhenever her grand daughter met her she told her that she was \n\nbeing harassed for want of dowry by her husband and inlaws and \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 52 of 75\n\n that she was harassed after one and half month of her marriage. In \n\ncross examination she admitted that she is residing in Rewari with \n\nher husband. She had not visited the matrimonial house of her \n\ngrand daughter and Sucheta never met her when she came to Delhi. \n\nShe has clearly admitted that she never met the deceased after \n\nmarriage. She has further stated that she was informed by Jyoti on \n\ntelephone. This witness has not levelled any allegation as to what \n\ndemand was raised by accused which was told to her by deceased \n\nSucheta @ Jyoti. She has stated that Sushila told her that they had \n\ngiven Rs.1.00 lac and scooter to Bhagat Singh. But she admitted \n\nthat it was not given in her presence. She was also put a question \n\nduring cross examination which is as under:­\n\nQuestion: Were you happy when Jyoti got married to accused \nBhagat Singh?\n\nAnswer: Khush to hona hi padda aur kya karte.\n\n54. The answer to above question clearly suggest that PW6 \n\nwas not happy with this wedlock since earlier accused Bhagat \n\nSingh and Sucheta had eloped and thereafter case was registered \n\nand thereafter Sucheta got married with Bhagat Singh. She clearly \n\nadmitted in cross examination that she never met Jyoti after her \n\nmarriage till she died, though she had been coming to Delhi but she \n\ncame in the morning and left in the evening. She admitted that her \n\nstatement recorded by the police was not read over to her. In view \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 53 of 75\n\n of the statement of PW6, she has not stated as to what demand was \n\nraised by the accused persons as told to her by Jyoti. \n\n55. The prosecution has also examined PW14 Ravi Jain \n\nwho is the neighbourer of accused and who had seen Deceased \n\nfalling from the balcony. He has stated that he did not see any other \n\nperson from the matrimonial house of deceased present there. He \n\nknocked the door on which Bhagat Singh and his mother came out. \n\nHe also knocked the house of other neighbourer. He has stated that \n\nwhen the lady had fallen on the ground she was holding some \n\nclothes in her hand, the same was consisting of sarees, pant, shirt \n\nand some such like clothes which were kept aside when they \n\nremoved her to his vehicle. He was declared hostile by the \n\nprosecution wherein he has stated that on that night he was present \n\nat his shop namely Jain Sweet and preparing sweets for next day \n\norders. In cross examination he has stated that Bhagat Singh is \n\nrunning a puncture cycle shop and he does not used to sell cycle on \n\nhis shop. At that time parents of deceased did not make any \n\ncomplaint to the SDM or to the police against the accused person. \n\nThis witness has turned hostile and did not support the version of \n\nthe prosecution. \n\n56. It would be necessary to mention the relevant part of \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 54 of 75\n\n cross examination of PW5 & 7. PW5 has stated in cross \n\nexamination that Jyoti was in class 11th when she was taken away \n\nby Bhagat Singh and that Bhagat Singh was acquitted by the court \n\nas she had deposed in the court that she had gone with him on her \n\nfree will. She admitted that at the time when her daughter had \n\neloped with accused, she and her husband were against their \n\nrelationship. She was not aware about the marriage of her daughter \n\nwith Bhagat Singh after they had eloped. She had enquired from \n\nher daughter if she was happy with this marriage at the time of \n\ndiscussion with accused Bhagat to which she replied in affirmative. \n\nWhen her daughter returned to her house she told her that she \n\nwould marry Bhagat Singh and nobody else. She admitted that \n\nthere was no demand of dowry at the time of settlement of marriage \n\nand when accused Bhagat Singh was on bail in FIR no.913/07. Her \n\nstatement was recorded by the police on the intervening night of \n\n10/12/08 and 11/12/08. However, on perusal of the file it is \n\nrevealed that the statement on which the present case was \n\nregistered was recorded by the Executive Magistrate on 11.12.2008. \n\nShe made various improvements in her statement recorded\n u/s 161\n \n\nCr.PC. PW7 has also made various improvements in his statement. \n\nHe know that on the night of 9/10.12.2008 accused persons with his \n\ndaughter Sucheta had gone to attend the marriage which in their \n\nnear relation. He was told by Bhagat Singh that his daughter had \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 55 of 75\n\n gone to pick up the dry cloths from the roof and she had fallen from \n\nthere. \n\n57. It is admitted fact that accused Bhagat Singh and \n\ndeceased Sucheta had eloped together and case FIR no. 913/12 was \n\nregistered. The marriage between them was solemnized on \n\n18.5.2008 and thereafter deceased as well as her parents PW5 & \n\nPW7 made statement before the court that they are residing happily. \n\nThey have also admitted that there was no demand for dowry at the \n\ntime of marriage and till accused was on bail. Therefore the \n\nallegation that after 2/3 days or ¾ days deceased told them about \n\ndemand of more dowry/ Rs.1.00 lac/1.50 lac cannot sustain. It has \n\nfurther come in evidence that PW5 & 7(mother and father) both \n\nwere against the relationship of accused Bhagat Singh and Sucheta \n\nand even PW6 Maya Devi was also against this marriage. But it \n\nwas solemnized due to intervention of the respectables of the family \n\nas they both had eloped together and deceased had also stated that \n\nshe would marry only to Bhagat Singh and none else. Considering \n\nthe fact that both the parents and grand mother of deceased were \n\nagainst marriage, their false implication cannot be ruled out. \n\n58. In view of the deposition of star witnesses of the \n\nprosecution, I have also considered some case law and would like \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 56 of 75\n\n to mention the same for just decision of the case. \nIn case law \nSunil \n\nBajaj Vs. State of MP\n, 2001 (2) JCC (SC) 262 it is stated in head \n\nnote:­\n 'Section 304B­ It is pleaded that last letter of deceased did not \n mention any allegation of dowry demand - The letter of \n deceased does not speak of any demand of dowry and there is \n totally absence of demand of dowry and so \nsec.498A\n of IPC \n is not at all attracted - Thus the necessary ingredients of the \n offence of \nsec.304B\n of IPC is absent and so the conviction \n and sentence of the appellant cannot sustain and so the \n appellant is acquitted of the conviction\n u/s 304B\n IPC. It is \n further stated that : Both the courts below concurrently \n committed the appellant - But out of so many witnesses of \n the neighbour none could say that there was a dowry death \n and the deceased was soon before her death was subjected to \n demand of dowry which was necessary ingredient of the \n offence\n u/s 498A\n of IPC committed by the husband or by any \n of the family members or near relatives'.\n\nIn case law \nBaljeet Singh & Anr Vs. State of Haryana\n, 2004(1) \n\nJCC 627 it is stated in headnote that :\n\n '\nEvidence Act\n. 1872 - Sec.113B­ Presumption­ Dowry \n death - Against accused persons to be drawn provided the \n prosecution establishes that soon before her death if the \n woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment within 7 \n years of marriage'.\n\n 'Dowry death - Onus of proof­ Preliminary facts - Proof of \n\n - Onus lies upon the prosecution - High Court erroneously \n shifted the burden upon the accused - About the date of \n marriage - Prosecution is required to prove that death \n occurred within 7 days of marriage - PW4 father of the \n deceased was not creditworthy - So were other related PW5 \n\n - Prosecution failed to discharge its initial onus of proof - \n PW5 the mother stated that the deceased was depressed - \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 57 of 75\n\n This indicated that woman committed suicide in a state of \n depression - Hence conviction is set aside and appeal is \n allowed'. \n\nIn case Law Raman Kumar Vs. State of Punjab, 2009(3) JCC \n\n1840 it is stated in head note that :\n\n 'Sec. 304B - \nEvidence Act, 1872\n - Sec. 113B - Dowry \n Death - No incidence of demand of dowry or cruelty or \n harassment 'soon before death' - Letter relied on shows \n demand of articles by her parents by her own and not on the \n behalf of appellant - Improvements in the statements of \n prosecution witnesses - Prosecution squarely failed to \n establish accusations against appellant - Appeal allowed - \n Conviction set aside'. \n\nIn case law \nHarjit Singh Vs. State of Punjab\n, (2006) 1 SCC 463 it \n\nis stated in head note that :\n\n 'Sec. 304B - Dowry death - soon before the death, deceased \n was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband for \n or in connection with demand of dowry - Once this is \n established, a legal fiction is created under \nsection 304B\n \n IPC whereby such death would be called dowry death - On \n facts held, ingredients of \nSec.304B\n IPC r/ sec. 113 B \n Evidnce Act not satisfied'. \n\nIn case law Tarsen Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 2009 (1) JCC 372 \n\nit is stated in head note that:­\n 'One of the essential ingredients amongst others, is that the \n woman must have been 'soon before her death' subjected to \n cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with the demand \n for dowry - Nothing on record to show that any demand of \n dowry was made soon before her death­ The cause of action \n appears to be an ego problem on the part of the appellant, \n namely the deceased had not been coming to her \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 58 of 75\n\n matrimonial home - Conviction u/s 304B not proved'. \n\nIn case Law Durga Prasad & Anr Vs. State of M.P, 2010 (3) JCC 1852 it is \n\nstated in head note that:­\n\n 'Sec. 304B - Dowry death­ In order to hold an accused \n guilty of an offence of dowry death - it has to be shown \n that apart from the fact that the woman died on account of \n burn or bodily injury, otherwise than under normal \n circumstances, within 7 years of marriage - It has also to \n be shown that soon before her death she was subjected to \n cruelty and harassment by her husband or any relative of \n her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for \n dowry'. \n\n 'Sec. 304B - In order to bring home a conviction u/s 304B, \n it will not be sufficient to only lead evidence showing that \n cruelty or harassment had been meted out to the victim - \n But that such treatment was in connection with the demand \n for dowry'.\n\n59. Considering the above discussion, to prove the case \n\nu/s 304B \nIPC\n these ingredients have to be proved (i) unnatural \n\ndeath (ii) within 7 years of marriage and (iii) soon before death she \n\nwas subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or relative \n\nof her husband (iv) such cruelty must be in connection with demand \n\nof dowry (v) such cruelty is shown to have been meted to the \n\nwoman soon before her death. In this case the death occurred due to \n\nfall from height. She was taken to the hospital by accused Bhagat \n\nSingh. The death of deceased Sucheta took place within 7 years of \n\nmarriage and it was unnatural death. So, two ingredients have been \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 59 of 75\n\n proved by the prosecution. Now it is necessary to find out as to \n\nwhether the deceased was being harassed soon before her death by \n\nsubjecting her to cruelty and demand of dowry. It is now well \n\nsettled in view of a catena of decisions of Hon'ble Apex Court that \n\nwhat would constitute 'soon before her death' depends upon the \n\nfacts and circumstances of the case. In this case PW5 Sushila, and \n\nPW7 Satbir have not made any allegations against the accused \n\npersons in their initial statements recorded by the Executive \n\nMagistrate. Whatever allegations they have made in those \n\nstatements, that were also contradictory as PW5 had allegedly given \n\nRs.1.50 lacs while Satbir has not stated anything in this respect. He \n\nonly stated that he provided material for shop worth Rs. 1.00 lac. \n\nHe has not stated about giving of Rs.50,000/­ by his wife. Satbir has \n\nstated that his daughter told him that they are under debt of Rs.1.00 \n\nlac while his wife Sushila has given different version. Sushila did \n\nnot corroborate the version of Satbir that only once there was \n\ndifference between Bhagat Singh and Sucheta. The statements were \n\nthe first/initial statements. It is on record in the statement of PW19 \n\nSh Surender Singh that he had requested them to give their \n\nstatements however they refused and stated that they were disturbed \n\ndue to the death of their daughter and would give their statements \n\nnext day. Further PW22 ASI Khajan Singh in cross examination \n\nvoluntarily stated that the relatives of parents of Sucheta who had \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 60 of 75\n\n also accompanied them were not willing for taking of any legal \n\naction against the in­laws of Sucheta. PW17 IO/SI Rajender S \n\nGurjar has stated in cross examination that the parents of deceased \n\nSucheta were called in the PS by him but they refused to give any \n\nstatement. He and the Executive Magistrate did not reduce this fact \n\nin writing that the parents of deceased were not willing to give \n\nstatement on that day. PW5 has stated that her statement was \n\nrecorded by police on 10/11.12.2008 while the statement recorded \n\nby the SDM was recorded on 11.12.2008. There is no explanation \n\nas to what prevented PW5 & PW7 to make the allegations as \n\nalleged by them in their statements recorded u/s 161 \nCr.PC\n. \n\nFurther, the marriage between accused Bhagat Singh and deceased \n\nSucheta was a love marriage and PW5 & 7 were against it. The \n\nincident had taken place on the intervening night of 9/10.12.2008. \n\nExecutive Magistrate met the parents on 10.12.2008 in the morning \n\nbut on perusal of their statements it is revealed that they were \n\nrecorded on 11.12.2008. It is on record that the parents of deceased \n\nhad refused to give their statements. Therefore false implication of \n\naccused persons cannot be ruled out. PW5&7 have not deposed that \n\nthey had received any call from Sucheta @Jyoti soon before her \n\ndeath alleging demand for dowry. The version of above PWS \n\ncannot be termed as harassment for demand of dowry. The \n\nchargesheet revealed that on 6.12.208 Sucheta came to the house of \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 61 of 75\n\n her parents and told that they are under debt of RS.1.00 lac - Rs.\n\n1­1/4 lac and if they give the money, they (she and her husband) \n\nwould be debt free. These lines does not constitute harassment for \n\ndemand of dowry and it was a mere request made by deceased \n\nSucheta. So, there is no evidence for harassment on account of \n\ndemand of dowry soon before death in this case. In my view there \n\nis no evidence available on file in this case that deceased Sucheta \n\nwas subjected to cruelty or harassment on account of demand of \n\ndowry. There is no indication that there was any cruelty or \n\nharassment meted out soon before the death of Sucheta. Hence, \n\ningredients of \nSec.498A\n/\n304B\n IPC are not complete in this case. \n\n60. I have also considered the statements of other PWS. \n\nPW1 L/Ct.Urmila is the witness for arrest of accused Veena, PW4 \n\nASI Jagdish is the FIR recorder, PW8 SI Balram informed about \n\nincident vide DD no.4A, PW11 HC Satish is the MHCM, PW13 \n\nHC Rajeev took the photographs of the spot, PW15 HC Ram \n\nChander has stated about admission of deceased in the hospital, \n\nPW17 SI Rajender is the first IO, PW20 Insp.SS Rathi is the second \n\nIO, PW21 HC Karambir Singh took pullands to FSL, PW22 ASI \n\nKhajan Singh is from Mobile crime team and PW23 SI Mahesh has \n\nprepared the scaled site plan. \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 62 of 75\n\n 61. In this case alternative charge has also been framed \n\nagainst the accused persons for the commission of offence \n\npunishable\n u/s 302\n IPC. I have also perused the testimonies of other \n\nofficial witnesses as well as relatives of deceased again. It is \n\nrevealed that in this case no one had seen the accused persons \n\nkilling the deceased. Therefore this case depends on circumstantial \n\nevidence. It is well settled law that observed by the Apex court in \n\nTanviben Pankaj Kumar Devtia Vs. State of Gujarat, 1997(2) \n\nCC cases SC 98 that court has to be watchful and avoid the danger \n\nof allowing the suspicion to make the place of legal proof for some \n\ntime unconsciously it may happen to be a short step between moral \n\ncertainty and legal proof ­it has been indicated by this court that \n\nthere is a long mental distance between may be true and must be \n\ntrue and the same divides conjectures from sure conclusions. \nOur \n\nHon'ble High court of Delhi in \nRaj Mani Vs. State\n has held that \n\nwhere the evidence of last seen together specially considering the \n\nevidence of the PWS cannot be said to prove with reasonable \n\ncertainty that the circumstances of last seen together has been \n\nestablished beyond a shadow of doubt by the prosecution, the state \n\nof circumstances of last seen together being not free from \n\nsuspicion. No finding with regard to the proof of circumstances of \n\nlast seen together can be recorded. It is stated in Padala Veera \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 63 of 75\n\nReddy Vs. State of A.P.\n (SCC pp.710­11, Para 10) and in other \n\ncatena of Judgments that when a case rests upon circumstantial \n\nevidence, such evidence must satisfy the following tests:­\n\n'10. (1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilty is sought to \n be drawn, must be cogently and firmly established.\n (2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly \n pointing towards guilty of the accused\n (3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain so\n complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all\n human probability the crime was committed by the accused and \n none else; and\n (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be\n complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis\n than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not\n only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent \n with his innocence.\n\n62. In the present case in hand, deceased Sucheta had \n\nallegedly fallen from second floor balcony in the night time. The \n\naccused persons have not taken any defence that they were not \n\npresent at the house there. So, it is crystal clear that they are \n\npresent at the house at the time of incident. PW5 & 7 were \n\ninformed about the incident by PW14 Ravi Jain. It is stated by PW5 \n\n& 7 that when they reached they saw crowd collected outside their \n\nhouse and there was pool of blood and when they enquired it was \n\ntold that their daughter has been taken to DDU Hospital. PW2 Dr. \n\nKomal Singh had conducted the post mortem examination of \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 64 of 75\n\n Sucheta. The PM report is Ex.PW2/A. I have perused the same. The \n\nfollowing injuries are mentioned in the PM report:\n\n1. CLW 2cm x 0.25 cm on left fronto parietal regions having clotted blood\n\n2. Bruise on left shoulder joint 2x4 cm\n\n3. Bruise on right elbow (O/s) 4 cmx0.5 cm.\n\n63. The cause of death was opined due to craniocerebral \n\ninjury subsequent to the fall from height. PW2 Dr.Kamal has not \n\nstated that there was any sign of struggle on the body of deceased \n\ndetected by him. Had the deceased been murdered and then thrown \n\nfrom the balcony, there must have been other medical evidence on \n\nthat aspect but that is missing in this case. \n\n64. Ld. Defence counsel has submitted that no recovery has \n\nbeen effected on the disclosure statements of accused Bhagat Singh. \n\nI have perused the said disclosure statements Ex.PW17/F. No \n\nrecovery of any weapon was effected on the basis of disclosure \n\nstatement. Further the disclosure statement is clear that Jyoti herself \n\nhas jumped from the roof. It also does not disclose that she had \n\nbeen given beatings on the alleged day of incident by accused.\n\n65. The IO of this case has stated that he recovered the \n\nexhibits from the spot. The same were sent to FSL. I have perused \n\nthe result of FSL which is Ex.PW18/A & B. On Ex.S1& S2 \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 65 of 75\n\n Cemented material, Ex.4 Concrete material, Ex.S­6a jeans pant, \n\nEx.S7 gauze cloth piece, Ex.S8 blood stained gauze, Ex.S­9a lady's \n\nshirt, Ex.S­9c&9d underwears human blood of B group was \n\ndetected. It is the case of the prosecution that accused Bhagat Singh \n\nhad removed the deceased to hospital. Therefore it is crystal clear \n\nthat blood must have come on his wearing clothes. \n\n66. As far as the injury sustained by accused Bhagat Singh \n\nis concerned, the prosecution has examined PW12 Dr.Avnish who \n\nappeared on behalf of Dr. Rajesh Saha who examined accused \n\nBhagat Singh. He has stated that there were multiple/three healed \n\nabrasions over ulnar aspect of right hand of reddish violet colour \n\nwith crusting. There were 9 other healed abrasions. The MLC is \n\nEx.PW12/A. He has stated that the injuries on the person of patient \n\nwas of duration of about one week and it may be from 2 to 7 days. \n\nThe prosecution could not examine the doctor who prepared the \n\nMLC of accused Bhagat Singh in this case. PW9 Dr.Yogendra Nath \n\nMaurya who examined accused on 13.12.2008 with alleged history \n\nof assault on 10.12.2008 has also noticed heeled wounds. AS per \n\nPW2 Dr. Komal Singh, the injuries were of 72 hours old. \n\nConsidering the duration, no doubt that the injuries sustained by \n\naccused Bhagat Singh seems to have been sustained by him on the \n\nday of incident. But there is no evidence that scuffle took place \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 66 of 75\n\n between him and deceased on that day due to which he murdered \n\nthe deceased. \n\n67. \nIn case law 186(2012) Delhi Law Times 411 titled \n\nJasvinder Saini & Ors.

State of Andhra \n\nPradesh\n, 1989 Supp (2) S.C.C 706 it is stated in head note that :­\n\n 'Criminal Trial - Circumstantial evidence - Held, on facts, \n circumstantial evidence not sufficient to conclusively \n establish guilty of accused persons - Conduct of the accused \n must be seen in its entirety - Mere suspicion not enough - \n Penal Code, 1860, Secs. 302/34 and Sec. 498A - \nEvidence \n Act, 1972\n, \nSec. 8\n.\n\n '\nEvidence Act\n. 1972 - \nSec.3\n - 'Proved' - Conviction cannot be \n based on suspicion, however, strong it may be'. \n\nIt is stated in Ramreddy Rajesh Khanna Reddy Vs. State of A.P \n\n(SCC P.181 para 26­27) that :­\n\n 'It is now well settled that with a view to base a conviction on \n circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish all the \n pieces of incriminating circumstances by reliable and \n clinching evidence and the circumstances so proved must \n form such a chain of events as would permit no conclusion \n other than one of guilt of the accused. The circumstances \n cannot be on any other hypothesis. It is also well settled that \n suspicion, however, grave it may, cannot be a substitute for a \n proof and the courts shall take utmost precaution in finding an \n accused guilty only on the basis of the circumstantial \n evidence. The story of last seen theory, furthermore, comes \n into play where the time gap between the point of time when \n the accused and the deceased were last seen alive and the \n deceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any \n person other than the accused being the author of the crime \n becomes impossible. Even in such a case the courts should \n look for some corroboration'. \n\n70. The most important aspect of the present case or for \n\nthat matter of any criminal case is a motive. Undoubtedly, motive \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 68 of 75\n\n is an important aspect of every criminal trial. Sometimes motive \n\nplays an important role and becomes a compelling force to commit \n\na crime and, therefore, motive behind the crime is a relevant factor \n\nfor which evidence must be adduced. A motive is something which \n\nprompts a person to form an opinion or intention to do certain \n\nillegal act or even a legal act but with illegal means with a view of \n\nachieve that intention. In a case where there is clear proof of \n\nmotive for the commission of the crime, it affords added support to \n\nthe finding of the court that the accused was guilty of the offence \n\ncharged with, though at the same time the absence of proof of \n\nmotive does not render the evidence bearing on the guilt of the \n\naccused nonetheless untrustworthy or unreliable. From the \n\nevidence on record as well as facts and circumstances of the case, \n\nthe prosecution has failed to establish any motive to kill deceased \n\nSucheta. It is stated in Yogi Choudhary etc. Vs. State of Bihar, \n\n2005 CRI. L.J. 2285 that :­\n\n 'Penal Code (45 of 1860) Ss.300, 34 - Murder - Absence of \n eyewitnesses - Motive of accused to commit murder found \n not convincing - Even otherwise, motive alone could not be \n made basis of his conviction - No evidence that he was present \n at place of occurrence when murder was committed - As far as \n second accused was concerned, informant stated in Fardbeyan \n that he recognized voice of that accused - Complete go­by \n given to this statement by informant in his examination in court \n\n - Stating that he named that accused on suspicion - There was \n absolutely no evidence against both accused - entitled to \n acquittal'. \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 69 of 75\n\nIn case law titled \nPandra Khadia Vs. State of Orissa\n , \n\n1992 CRI L.J 762 it is stated in headnote :­\n\n '\nEvidence Act\n. 1872, Ss. 3,8 - Penal Code (1860), Ss.299, 300, \n 302 - Murder - Proof of - Case based on circumstantial \n evidence - Motive of accused not proved by prosecution - Held, \n that since important circumstantial evidence had been \n disbelieved absence of proof of motive would weigh in favour of \n accused'.\n\n71. The onus to prove case u/s 302 \nIPC\n is on the \n\nprosecution. But in the present case prosecution could not \n\ndischarge its onus by leading cogent and reliable evidence. Suicide \n\ncommitted by living human beings for various reasons. There is no \n\npresumption that every suicide committed by married woman in her \n\nin law's house or at her parents, house has to be because she was \n\nsuffering harassment at the hands of her husband or her in­laws. \n\nSome commits suicide because of frustration of not achieving the \n\ndesired goals. In this case the defence of the accused is that she had \n\ngone to bring clothes from balcony. This version has also been \n\nstated by PW14 Ravi Jain who has stated that when Sucheta had \n\nfallen, she was holding some clothes in her hand and same were \n\nconsisting of sarees, pant, shirt and some such like clothes which \n\nwere kept aside when they removed her to his vehicle. PW17 SI \n\nRajender IO of this case has stated in cross examination that he did \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 70 of 75\n\n not notice any clothes lying on the road near the house of the \n\naccused. I have perused the photographs Ex.pw13/16. In the said \n\nphotographs some clothes are shown to be lying. Though there is no \n\nevidence as to where these clothes are lying but the plea taken by \n\naccused seems to be true.\n\n72. In view of the above overall analysis of the testimonies \n\nof the witnesses and in brief whatever allegations have been \n\nlevelled by PW5&7 regarding demand of dowry does not inspire \n\nconfidence. The important ingredient of 'soon before death' is \n\nmissing. The circumstances also does not connect the accused \n\npersons with the present case incident. So, in this case ingredients \n\nof \nsection 304B\n IPC are absent and there is no allegation for soon \n\nbefore death of harassing deceased Sucheta @ Jyoti for demand of \n\ndowry because whatever allegations have been made in the \n\nstatements recorded before the court and recorded by the SDM does \n\nnot inspire confidence. So, I am of the opinion that Sucheta @ \n\nJyoti was not maltreated soon before her death or even at any time \n\nafter marriage by the accused persons. \n\n73. In view of my above discussions and considering the \n\ncase laws discussed above, this case does not fall under the \n\ncategory of \nsection 304B\n IPC and no presumption can be taken \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 71 of 75\n\n against the accused persons\n u/s 113 B \nof Indian Evidence Act. The \n\nprosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of the accused u/s \n\n498A/304B/34 \nIPC\n.\n\n74. Realities of truth apart, the fundamental and basic \n\npresumption in the administration of criminal law and justice \n\ndelivery system is the innocence of the alleged accused and till the \n\ncharges are proved beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of clear, \n\ncogent, credible or unimpeachable evidence, the question of \n\nindicting or punishing an accused does not arise, merely carried \n\naway by heinous nature of the crime or the gruesome manner in \n\nwhich it was found to have been committed. Mere suspicion, \n\nhowever, strong or probable it may be is no effective substitute for \n\nthe legal proof required to substantiate the charge of commission of \n\na crime and grave the charge is greater should be the standard of \n\nproof required. There is a long mental distance between 'may be \n\ntrue' and 'must be true' and this basic and this golden rule only helps \n\nto maintain the vital distinction between 'conjectures' and 'sure \n\nconclusions' to be arrived at on the touch stone of a dispassionate \n\njudicial scrutiny, based upon a complete and comprehensive \n\nappreciation of all features of the case as well as quality and \n\ncredibility of the evidence brought on record.\n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 72 of 75\n\n 75. As far as charge\n u/s 302\n IPC is concerned, no one had \n\nseen accused killing deceased Sucheta. The circumstances of the \n\ncase do no link the accused with the present case crime. The death \n\nin this case was not a homicidal death. So, the prosecution could \n\nnot form a chain of circumstances while it is well settled law that in \n\na case of circumstantial evidence each and every chain of \n\ncircumstances has to be established by the prosecution by leading \n\ncogent and reliable evidence pointing the guilt of accused. But in \n\nthe present case the prosecution could not form a chain of \n\ncircumstances. \n\n76. It is well settled principle of law in AIR 2003 SC 3609, \n\nState of Punjab Vs.Karnail Singh that :­\n\n \"Golden thread which runs through the web of \n administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two \n views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, \n one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to \n his innocence, the views which is favourable to the \n accused should be adopted.The paramount consideration \n of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is \n prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise \n from the acquittal of the guilty is not less than from the \n conviction of an innocent\".\n\n77. In over all analysis of the testimonies of the witnesses, \n\nthis case does not fall under the category of 304B \nIPC\n and I also did \n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 73 of 75\n\n not find any evidence against the accused persons for the \n\ncommission of offence punishable\n u/s 498A\n IPC. The prosecution \n\nalso could not form the chain of circumstances to establish the \n\ncharge u/s 302 \nIPC\n. So, I am of the considered view that the \n\nprosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused persons. \n\nIn such circumstances, the accused persons are entitled to be given \n\nthe benefit of doubt. I, therefore give the benefit of doubt to \n\naccused persons and I therefore, hereby acquit accused Bhagat \n\nSingh Sharma, Bijender Sharma and Smt. Beena for the \n\ncommission of offence punishable u/s 498A/304B/34 \nIPC\n and \n\naccused Jatin is also acquitted\n u/s 498A\n/\n34\n IPC. All the accused are \n\nalso acquitted from alternative charge u/s 302/34 \nIPC\n. Accused \n\nBhagat Singh Sharma, Beena and Jitin are on bail. Their BB/SB are \n\ncancelled and sureties are discharged. Accused Vijender is in JC. \n\nHe be released from the jail forthwith if not required in any other \n\ncase. File be consigned to record room.\n\nAnnounced in the open Court \non 31.08.2012\n\n (SURESH CHAND RAJAN)\n ADDL.SESSIONS JUDGE/\n SPECIAL JUDGE(NDPS)\n NEW DELHI\n\nState Vs.Bhagat Singh Sharma etc.\n\nFIR no.121/08 Page No. 74 of 75",
