Respondents\n\n (By Advocate: Mr. Amit Yadav with Ms Monika Bhargava)\n 4\nItem No. 21/C-II\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n ORDER\n\n Hon'ble Mr. Rajinder Kashyap, Member (A): -\n\n By way of the present O.A., filed under \nSection 19\n of the\n Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, the applicants (13 in\n number), in Para 8 of the O.A., have prayed for the following\n reliefs: -\n\n \"a) Quashing and setting aside of OIC-Estt. Branch-PHQ\n upload memo no. F.18(26)/Estt./PHQ/2025/CDNo.\n\n 3799530/2947 dated 25.04.2025 with annexed thereto\n advertisement notice-2025 [Annexure A-1];\n\n b) As usual continuation of the contractual employments of the\n Applicants with all consequential reliefs and benefits,\n including pay and allowances for the intermittent period i.e.\n 01.04.2025 to till rejoining of the Applicants;\n\n Any other or further order or direction to grant complete relief\n to the applicants.\"\n\n 2. Pursuant to notice, the respondents have filed their\n counter affidavit opposing the claim of the applicant and have\n prayed for dismissal of the present Original Application.\n\n FACTS OF THE CASE\n\n 3. The Delhi Prisons/Respondent No. 2 presently comprises\n 16 Central Jails situated across three Prison Complexes, namely\n Tihar, Rohini, and Mandoli. \nSection 6\n of the Delhi Prisons Act,\n 2000 mandates that every Central Jail shall have, inter alia, a\n Law Officer. The relevant statutory provision reads as under:\n\n \"6. For every prison there shall be a Superintendent, a Deputy\n Prisons Superintendent, a Medical Officer, a Law Officer, a Welfare\n Officer, and such other officers as the Government thinks it\n necessary.\"\n\n \n3.1 It is submitted that although the statute requires a Law Officer\n for each prison, there has been only one sanctioned post of Law\n Officer in Delhi Prisons since its creation in 1993. With the\n number of Central Jails having increased to 16, this statutory\n\n 5\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n mandate remained unfulfilled. Consequently, a Public Interest\n Litigation (W.P. (C) No. 4173/2019, \nAmit Sahni Vs.\n Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr.\n) was filed. By order\n dated 27.09.2019, the Hon‟ble Delhi High Court, noting the\n submissions of the Respondents therein (i.e., GNCTD through its\n Home Department and Delhi Prisons) that the \"steps for creation\n of posts of Law Officers for each Jail are under process\",\n disposed of the petition. The matter was released from monitoring\n with a direction to the Respondents to complete the appointment\n process at the earliest, preferably within 12 weeks from receipt of\n the order.\n\n 3.2 Pursuant thereto, Respondent No. 2 sought permission to\n engage Law Officers on a contractual basis, making it clear that\n such contractual appointments were to be purely temporary,\n initially for one year, and extendable only until the posts were\n created and filled on a regular basis, so as to comply with the\n directions of the Hon‟ble High Court. In compliance, 14 posts of\n Law Officer (Contractual) were publicly advertised, carrying\n emoluments of ₹35,400 + Dearness Allowance. A Selection Board\n was constituted, and after following due process, including\n interview, recommendation, offer of appointment, medical\n examination, police verification, and issuance of appointment\n orders, the applicants herein, along with one other candidate,\n were appointed as Law Officers (Contractual) for an initial period\n of one year.\n\n 6\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n 3.3 Details of the applicants‟ contractual engagement are provided\n herein below for the ready reference of this Tribunal:\n\n S.N Name [Mr./Ms.] Professional Date of Initial\n Qualification appointment/s\n ince working\n\n 1.

Amit Goswami B.A. LL.B. [2013] 29.12.2020\n\n 3.4 It is further stated that since there was no compliance\n within the stipulated time, a Contempt Petition [Cont. Cas. (C)\n No. 5/2020] came to be filed. During its pendency, the aforesaid\n contractual appointments were made. Thereafter, by order dated\n 21.12.2021, the Hon‟ble Delhi High Court disposed of the\n contempt petition after recording the compliance/submissions\n made by the Respondents. The Applicant Law Officers\n (Contractual), upon their appointment, started serving\n individually in different Central Jails under Delhi Prisons.\n\n 3.5 Subsequently, upon perusal of the proposal dated\n 16.12.2021 filed by the Respondents along with their status report\n dated 20.12.2021 in the aforesaid contempt case, it transpired that\n pending creation of the required 15 posts of Law Officer, the\n applicants‟ contractual appointments as Law Officers were\n actually made against one sanctioned post of Assistant Law\n Officer and thirteen sanctioned posts of Legal Assistant, both\n carrying identical pay scales. Consequently, the applicants\n were/are being paid only the minimum of Level-6 (₹35,400 +\n static DA) instead of their lawful entitlement as Law Officers i.e.\n\n 7\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n the minimum of Level-7 (₹44,900 + applicable DA) under the 7th\n \nCPC\n. Furthermore, though admissible, no other allowances or\n service-related facilities have been extended to them. The\n applicants repeatedly took up the issue with the Respondents,\n pointing out the anomaly/illegality and invoking the settled\n principle of \"Equal Pay for Equal Work\", i.e., entitlement to the\n pay of the post on which they were appointed/working. However,\n except for plain assurances that the matter would be resolved\n upon creation of posts and arrears would then be paid, no relief\n was granted. Despite the lapse of nearly five years, and even\n though 3,241 new posts of different designations were created in\n Delhi Prisons on 06.09.2024, no new post of Law Officer was\n sanctioned.\n\n 3.6 On 09.07.2024, the applicants submitted a joint\n representation highlighting the aforesaid anomaly and illegality,\n and specifically seeking: (i) equal pay for equal work, (ii) salary of\n the post of Law Officer on which they were appointed/working,\n and (iii) clarification regarding leave entitlement. No action was\n taken thereon. It is relevant to submit that under law and rules,\n the applicants are entitled to the same facilities and benefits as\n other contractual employees working in different\n Departments/Establishments under the Government of NCT of\n Delhi. However, for reasons best known to the respondents, they\n are being denied such entitlements. It is further submitted that\n from the very beginning, the contractual appointments of the\n applicants were extended from time to time, including through ex\n post facto extensions, and for that purpose their work and conduct\n reports were regularly sought from the concerned controlling\n officers. However, for the tenure expiring on 31.03.2025, no such\n work and conduct reports were called. Instead, the applicants\n were orally informed that since they had raised the demand for\n equal pay for equal work and proper salary of the post of Law\n Officer, their contractual services were not likely to be continued.\n\n 8\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n Having no other remedy, the applicants submitted a detailed joint\n representation dated 17.03.2025, requesting the respondents to\n seek their work and conduct reports from the controlling officers\n for extension of service, and also to address non-compliance with\n the law governing contractual employment with respect to\n benefits such as Earned Leave Accumulation and Encashment,\n LTC, HRA, DA, Children Education Allowance, DGHS Medical\n Card, EPF, Gratuity, and other admissible facilities. The said\n representation was not replied to.\n\n \n3.7 The applicants were, therefore, constrained to approach\n this Tribunal by filing O.A. No. 1100/2025 titled \nSourabh\n Luthra & Ors. Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors.\n, wherein,\n by order dated 26.03.2025, this Tribunal, with the consent of\n learned counsel for the parties, disposed of the O.A. directing the\n competent authority to consider and dispose of the applicants‟\n representation by passing a reasoned and speaking order within\n six weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of the\n Tribunal‟s order. Despite the said directions, the Respondents did\n not extend the applicants‟ services, and their last extended\n contractual tenure expired on 31.03.2025. Thereafter, the\n Respondents issued an advisory to their officers not to permit the\n applicants‟ entry into the prison premises.\n\n 3.8 It is submitted that the respondents, acting in a vindictive\n manner and with the intent to defeat the rights and interests of\n the applicants, instead of extending their contractual\n appointments, issued an advertisement notice in 2025 inviting\n applications for 14 posts of Law Officers (Contractual) for a period\n up to 31.03.2026, within 15 days of its publication in the\n newspapers, i.e., on 26.04.2025. The said advertisement and\n conduct of the Respondents constitute a colourable exercise of\n power and are in direct violation of the well-settled legal principle\n that \"a contractual employee cannot be replaced by another\n\n 9\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n contractual employee.\" The attempt of the respondents is\n evidently to replace the applicants with another set of contractual\n Law Officers, which is impermissible in law.\n\n CONTENTION OF THE APPLICANTS:-\n\n 4. Advancing their case, the applicants submit that:-\n\n i. Government of N.C.T. Delhi vide its office order\n dated29.11.2000 did permit to its contractual Para-\n medics/Nursing Officers leave including earned leave, half\n pay leave, casual leave, maternity, paternity, abortion leave\n and day offs at par with regular employees. Likewise,\n contractual employees in other Departments of\n Government of N.C.T. Delhi too are getting leaves at par\n with regular employees. Further, under the provisions of\n applicable Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and\n Pension (Department of Personnel &Training)\n Government of India O.M. No. 12016\\2\\99-Estt.(L) dated\n 12.07.1999, past completion of 2 years of contractual\n service contractual employees are very much entitled for\n leave encashment up to 300 days at par with regular\n employees dependent upon the tenure of their contractual\n service. As such, though the applicants too are fully entitled\n but are being denied leave, leave accumulation at par with\n other contractual employees working in other Departments\n of Government of N.C.T. Delhi;\n\n ii. Under the provisions of Rule „1‟ (3)(i) (iii) read with rule\n 2(1 )(2)of Central Civil Services [Leave Travel Concession]\n Rules,1988, a contractual employee upon completion of 1\n [One] year of service is very much entitled for Leave Travel\n Concession, the rules being very much followed/applicable\n upon contractual employees of Government of N.C.T. Delhi\n still Leave Travel Concession, leave encashment attached\n\n 10\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n thereto for no rhyme and reason is not being allowed to the\n applicants;\n\n iii. Health Department, Government of NCT Delhi vide its\n orderno.F.1 (550)/TRC/H&FW/2012/12026-12061 dated\n 19.11.2012,did permit its contractual employees salary at\n the minimum of the pay band of the\n respective/corresponding post including Dearness\n Allowance, House Rent Allowance, Transport Allowance,\n Patient Care Allowance, Uniform Allowance, Washing\n Allowance, Nursing Allowance etc. Further, following legal\n recourse, the Craft Instructors [Contractual] in Training\n and Technical Education Department, Government of\n N.C.T. Delhi too are being granted pay, allowances at par\n with regular Craft Instructors following the principle of\n equal pay for equal work without increment, as such,\n though the applicant herein too are fully entitled but are\n being denied the pay, allowances with arrears of the post\n they have been appointed/working i.e. Law Officer at par\n with regular Law Officer except the distinction been drawn\n i.e. increment;\n\n iv. Vide order dated 19.03.2021 followed by Department of\n Health and Family Welfare, Government of N.C.T. Delhi\n circular no. F.8(218)/Nursing/H&FW/2019-596-599\n dated21.06.2022 Medical Card facility [Health Card\n Benefits] are admissible to the contractual\n Nursing/Paramedical employees and their families at par\n with their regular counter parts as ordered by the Hon'ble\n Delhi High Court order dated 06.11.2013 as passed in Writ\n Petition (Civil) no. 6798/2002,on payment of subscription,\n as such, the applicants too are entitled for the Delhi\n Government Employees Health Scheme, on payment of\n subscription, but aren't being allowed to avail the facility;\n\n 11\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n v. That as per the \nEmployees Provident Funds and\n Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952\n, every establishment\n having 20 or more employees on any day in preceding year\n is to mandatorily adopt and the employees are entitled to\n subscribe towards, avail benefits of Employees Provident\n Fund Scheme and as per \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n\n each and every establishment having 10 or more employees\n on any day in preceding year is mandatorily liable to pay to\n its employees and the employees are entitled to receive\n Gratuity from its employer. Despite that been the statutory\n position, the applicants are not being allowed the benefits\n of the aforesaid beneficial legislation. The State been a\n model employer, there's no reason as to why the benefits of\n said Acts shouldn't apply to its contractual employees\n including the Applicants. \nWorthwhile to add that\n Directorate of Education, „GNCTD‟ complying with the\n judgment dated 03.08.2021 as passed by this Hon'ble High\n Court in Writ Petition (Civil) no. 11154/2019 titled\n \nJanardan Sharma Vs. Government of N.C.T.\n Delhi\n, vide its order dated 13.12.2022 has allowed\n payment of gratuity to its Part Time Vocational Teachers\n engaged on consolidated salary.\n\n \n4.2 It is well settled principle of law that one set of contract\n employees cannot be replaced by another set of contract\n employees in view of the order/judgment dated 12.08.1992 of\n Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of \nState of Haryana & Ors.\n Vs. Piara Singh & Others\n, reported in (1992) 2 SCC 118, and\n therefore, the inviting the applications from fresh appointment on\n contract basis for the same post on which the applicant was\n working only to replace the applicant is totally illegal, arbitrary\n and discriminatory in the eyes of law.\n\n 12\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n 4.3 Learned counsel for the applicant places reliance on the\n following orders/judgments namely; (i) Judgment dated\n 07.11.2003 of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.\n 8745/2003 in the matter of \nHargurpratap Singh Vs. State\n of Punjab & Ors.\n, reported in (2007) 13 SCC 292;(ii) Judgment\n dated 06.12.2000 of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal\n No. 11785/1996 in the matter of Commissioner, Kendriya\n Vidyalaya Sangathan & Ors.

No.\n 1184/2009 with O.A. No. 1461/2009 in the matter of \nMrs.\n Praveen Khan & Ors. Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors.\n;\n\n REPLY OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\n 5. By drawing our attention to the counter reply filed by\n respondents on 05.08.2025 wherein they have submitted that\n\n 13\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n Delhi Prisons vide its letter dated26.09.2019 requested Home\n Department, GNCTD to grant permission for engagement of 16\n Law Officers on contract basis, as per appropriate rules and\n regulations, initially for a period of one year extendable for the\n period till these posts are filled on regular basis after post creation\n so as to enable Delhi Prisons to comply the direction of Hon'ble\n High Court at Delhi at the earliest. However, Hon'ble Lieutenant\n General granted approval for filling up the 14 vacant post of Law\n Officer on contract basis against the 13 sanctioned vacant posts of\n Legal Assistant and 01 post of Assistant Law Officer initially for a\n period of01 year. This tenure was later extended by Hon'ble\n Lieutenant General upto 31.03.2025. The details of extensions are\n as below:-\n\n Sl. Period for which tenure Authority/Order vide\n No. extended which tenure was\n extended\n\n 1. 01.09.2021 to 31.08.2022 Letter dated 25.11.2021\n\n 2. 01.09.2022 to 31.03.2023 Letter dated 29.12.2022\n\n 3. 01.04.2023 to 31.03.2024 Letter dated 21.04.2023\n\n 4. 01.04.2024 to 31.03.2025 Letter dated 02.04.2024\n\n 5.2 It is further submitted that the scope of duties of Law\n Officers (contract) is not similar with the duties of Law Officers\n mentioned in Delhi Prisons Rules 2018. A mere nomenclature\n designating a person as Law Officer is not enough to come to\n conclusion that he is doing the some work as any Law Officer in\n regular service. Therefore, the principle of „Equal pay for equal\n work‟ does not apply in this case. It is submitted that there\n presentations of the Law Officers (Contractual) were disposed off\n by issuing a speaking order dated 15.05.2025.\n\n \n5.3 It is submitted that the ruling of Hon‟ble Apex court in\n \nState of Haryana & Ors. Vs Piara Singh & Ors.\n, reported\n in 1992 AIR 1230, was in case of adhoc or temporary\n appointments and not in case of contractual employees. The\n statement in verbatim is as under:-\n\n 14\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n \"an ad hoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by\n another ad hoc or temporary employee.\"\n\n \n5.4 The Apex court has observed in \nYogesh Mahajan Vs.\n Prof. R. C. Deka, Director and All India Institute of\n Medical Sciences\n and \nPunjab State Electricity Board Vs.\n Jagjiwan Ram\n that adhoc service is often viewed as a\n substantive vacancy that can lead to regularization, whereas\n contract service is typically temporary and does not guarantee\n renewal or extension. Contractual employees do not have an\n inherent right to have their contracts renewed.\n\n 5.5 As a matter of fact, no equality before the law is being\n denied to the applicants. However, \nArticle 16 (1)\n of the\n Constitution of India envisages:\n\n \"Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.-(1) There\n shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to\n employment or appointment to any office under the State.\"\n\n 5.6 Delhi Prisons has published the advertisement for filling up of\n these posts in newspaper of four languages i.e. English, Hindi,\n Punjabi and Urdu inviting applications from eligible candidates.\n The applicants who have worked upto 31.03.2025as per contract\n were not bared from applying and they could also apply for these\n posts subject to satisfying eligibility criteria. In addition, \nArticle\n 311\n of the Constitution of India lays down the procedure and\n safeguards to be followed before a government employee\n (member of a civil service of the Union or an all India service or a\n civil service of a State or holds a civil post under the Union or a\n State).\n\n \n5.7 Learned counsel for the respondents places reliance on the\n order/judgment dated 28.08.2020 of the Hon‟ble High Court of\n Delhi in W.P. (C) 2935/2020 in the matter of \nMs. Sonalika\n Bhargava Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors\n.\n\n 6. We have perused the pleadings available on record and\n considered the submissions made by the learned counsels for the\n\n 15\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n parties and have also gone through the Orders/Judgments\n referred to and relied upon by the learned counsels for the\n respective parties carefully.\n\n 7. Office order dated 25.04.2025 (Annexure-A/1) reads as under:-\n\n \"Sub: Uploading the Advertisement Notice-2025 for the\n post of LAW OFFICER on Contractual Basis in Delhi\n Prison Department, GNCTD.\n\n With reference to the aforementioned subject, it is to inform that the\n Delhi Prisons Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi invites\n applications for filling up the 01 vacant post of Law Officer purely\n on Contractual basis initially for period upto 31.03.2026.\n\n In this context, please find enclosed herewith the Advertisement\n Notice-2025 alongwith terms and conditions and\n application performa (Annexure-I) with the request to\n upload the same on Department Website.\"\n\n \n8. On replacement of contractual employees, the law \nlaid down in\n\nPiara Singh\n (supra) is clear that while ad-hoc employees do not\n have a right to regularization, they cannot be arbitrarily replaced\n by another set of ad-hoc employees, except through a process of\n regular recruitment.\n \nThis principle has been followed in\n subsequent decisions including \nParveen Khan\n (supra).In the\n present case, the respondents seek to fill the same posts by\n engaging another set of contractual Law Officers, without\n initiating any process of regular recruitment.\n \nSuch action, in our\n considered view, is in violation to the ratio in \nPiara Singh\n\n (supra) and is arbitrary.\n\n \n9. The reliance placed by the applicant on \nPiara Singh\n (supra) is\n well-founded as the Hon‟ble Supreme Court therein held that\n adhoc or temporary employees cannot be replaced by another set\n of adhoc or temporary employees, and such replacement is\n deemed arbitrary unless justified by exceptional circumstances.\n For facility of reference, the relevant portion of \nthe said judgment\n\n reads as under:-\n\n 16\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n \"25. Before parting with this case, we think it appropriate to\n say a few words concerning the issue of regularisation of\n adhoc/temporary employees in government service.\n\n The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through\n the prescribed agency but exigencies of administration may\n sometimes call for an adhoc or temporary appointment to\n be made. In such a situation, effort should always be to\n replace such an adhoc/temporary employee by a regularly\n selected employee as early as possible. Such a temporary\n employee may also compete along with others for such\n regular selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and\n good, but if he does not, he must give way to the regularly\n selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly\n selected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance\n for the sake of such an adhoc/temporary employee.\n\n Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be\n replaced by another adhoc or temporary employee; he must\n be replaced only by a regularly selected employee. This is\n necessary to avoid arbitrary action on the part of the\n appointing authority.\n\n Thirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment is\n necessitated on account of the exigencies of administration,\n he should ordinarily be drawn from the employment\n exchange unless it cannot brook delay in which case the\n pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no candidate is\n available or is not sponsored by the employment exchange,\n some appropriate method consistent with the requirements\n of \nArticle 16\n should be followed. In other words, there must\n be a notice published in the appropriate manner calling for\n applications and all those who apply in response thereto\n should be considered fairly.\n\n An unqualified person ought to be appointed only when\n qualified persons are not available through the above\n processes.\n\n If for any reason, an adhoc or temporary employee is\n continued for a fairly long spell, the authorities must\n consider his case for regularisation provided he is eligible\n and qualified according to rules and his service record is\n satisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to the\n reservation policy of the State.\n\n The proper course would be that each States prepares a\n scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation of\n such employees consistent with its reservation policy and if\n a scheme is already framed, the same way be made\n consistent with our observations herein so as to reduce\n\n 17\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n avoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such person\n is regularised he should be placed immediately below the\n last regularly appointed employee in that category, class or\n service, as the case may be.\n\n So far as the work-charged employees and casual labour\n are concerned, the effort must be to regularise them as far\n as possible and as early as possible subject to their fulfilling\n the qualifications, if any, prescribed for the post and subject\n also to availability of work. If a casual labourer is continued\n for a fairly long spell - say two or three years - a\n presumption may arise that there is regular need for his\n services. In such a situation, it becomes obligatory for the\n concerned authority to examine the feasibility of his\n regularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought to\n adopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the\n person. As has been repeatedly stressed by this court,\n security of tenure is necessary for an employee to give his\n best to the job. In this behalf, we do commend the orders of\n the Government of Haryana (contained in its letter dated\n 6.4.90 referred to hereinbefore) both in relation to work-\n charged employees as well as casual labour.\n\n We must also say that the orders issued by the Governments\n of Punjab and Haryana providing for regularisation of\n adhoc/temporary employees who have put in two years/one\n year of service are quite generous and leave no room for\n any legitimate grievance by any one.\n\n These are but a few observations which we thought it\n necessary to make, impelled by the facts of this case, and the\n spate of litigation by such employees. They are not\n exhaustive nor can they be understood as immutable. Each\n Government or authority has to devise its own criteria or\n principles for regularisation having regard to all the\n relevant circumstances, but while doing so, it should bear in\n mind the observations made herein.\n\n 26. So far as the employees and workmen employed by\n Statutory/Public Corporations are concerned, it may be\n noted that they have not issued any orders akin to those\n issued by the Punjab and Haryana Government. Even so, it\n is but appropriate that they adopt as far as possible,\n keeping the exigencies and requirements of their\n administration in view, the criteria and principles\n underlying the orders issued by their Government in the\n matter of regularisation and pass appropriate orders. In\n short, the Statutory/Public Corporations in Haryana will\n follow the orders contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990\n \nreferred to above\n, as supplemented by the orders in the\n Notification dated 28.2.1991, where as the Statutory/Public\n\n 18\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n Corporations in Punjab shall follow the criteria and\n principles stated in the affidavit of Sri G.K.Bansal, Under\n Secretary to the Government of Punjab, Department of\n Personnel referred to in para 22 above. These directions\n shall not, however, apply to these Statutory/Public\n Corporations functioning within these States as are under\n the control of the Government of India. These Corporations\n will do well to evolve an appropriate policy of\n regularisation, in the light of this judgment, if they have not\n already evolved one, or make their existing policy consistent\n with this judgment to avoid litigation.\n\n 27. For the above reasons, all the appeals are allowed and\n the orders under appeal are set aside. The directions given\n by the High Court in the judgment in W.P.(C) No.72/88\n namely direction Nos. 1,2,3,4,6 and 8 are set aside. The only\n direction given herewith is the one contained in para 19. The\n writ petitions seeking the benefits given in the judgment\n under appeal are dismissed.\n\n No costs.\n\n H N.P.V. Appeals disposed of.\"\n\n 10. It is profitable to refer to the judgments on the issue involved\n\n in this case which are as follows:\n\n \n10.1 Judgment of the Hon‟ble High Court of Delhi dated\n\n 21.03.2023 in WP(C) No. 6014/2021 in the matter of \nMs.\n\n Neeru Kalher & ors Vs Delhi Skill and\n\n Entrepreneurship University\n & ors. In paras- 2, 8, 9, 11,\n\n 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24 of the judgment, the Hon‟ble\n\n High Court has held under:\n\n \"2.

CONTENTIONS ON BEAHLF OF THE PETITIONERS:-\n\n (A) The advertisement along with General Instructions dated\n 08.06.2021 is per se illegal and has been published with an intent\n to oust the Petitioners. Petitioners were appointed on contract\n basis and from time to time their contracts were renewed.\n\n Petitioners fulfill all requisite criteria and qualifications under\n the RRs of posts and were appointed against sanctioned posts,\n after following the due process of selection and not de hors the\n RRs.\n\n \n(B) It is a settled law that a contractual employee cannot be\n replaced by another contractual employee. This law was\n propounded by the Supreme Court in \nState of Haryana and\n Others v. Piara Singh and Others\n, (1992) 4 SCC 118, and has been\n consistently followed in several judgments.\n \nThe Division Bench of\n this Court in \nNarender Singh Ahuja and Ors. v. The Secretary,\n Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ors.\n, 2014 SCC\n OnLine Del 2243, has held that employer cannot discontinue the\n services of contractual, employee by replacing existing\n employees with another set of contractual employees. This\n position has been consistently reiterated in a number of\n judgments by the Supreme Court, this Court and the Central\n Administrative Tribunal, wherein contractual appointees have\n been protected.\n \nIt is urged that the action of replacing\n contractual employees with contractual employees like the\n\n 20\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n Petitioners, who have continuously worked for long periods, is\n prohibited by the binding dictum of the Supreme Court in\n \nSecretary, State of Karnataka and Others v. Uma Devi\n (3) and\n Others, (2006) 4 SCC 1 and Kamlesh Kumar Vyas and Anr. v.\n State of Rajasthan and Ors.\n\n (C) Contracts of the Petitioners have been renewed from time to\n time and Petitioners cannot be removed without any plausible or\n just reason or without any cause for complaint, at the whims and\n fancies of the University, oblivious of the fact that Petitioners will\n lose their only source of livelihood. In Commissioner, Kendriya\n Vidyalaya Sangathan and Others v. Anil Kumar Singh and\n Others, (2003) 10 SCC 284, the Supreme Court ruled that\n contractual employees can only be replaced with regular\n employees, as and when the regular process of recruitment starts\n and culminates. It is an undisputed position in the present case\n that the impugned advertisement is for employing a fresh set of\n employees on contract basis and is not for regular appointments.\n Petitioners have clearly stated in the writ petition that they are\n not seeking regularization and their contracts be renewed till\n they are replaced with regular appointees. It is an obligation of\n the State under \nArticle 39-A\n of the Constitution of India to ensure\n that all citizens have equal rights to adequate needs of livelihood.\n Constitution guarantees social justice to all individuals and the\n impugned action of the University/DTTE will inevitably result in\n the Petitioners being replaced by contractual employees and loss\n of their livelihood at this stage of life, where they have no\n alternate source of income.\n\n 9. CONTENTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY:-\n\n (A) The impugned Notification does not not in in any any\n manner prevent or preclude the Petitioners from applying to\n secure appointment as Master Trainers and in fact, pursuant to\n the liberty granted by the Court on 25.06.2021, they have applied\n and their results have been kept in a sealed cover.\n\n (B) Contention of the Petitioners that they are being replaced by\n another set of contractual employees, is factually incorrect and a\n misconception. University has invited applications from the\n public at large and every application will be considered on its\n own merit to select most suitable persons and there is no intent\n to oust the Petitioners, who will be given an equal chance to\n compete with other applicants. \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution\n demands that there is an open advertisement giving equal\n chance to all those who apply and participate in a selection\n process and this would enable the University to get the best\n talent as Master Trainers.\n\n (C) There cannot be any debate on the proposition that one set of\n contractual employees cannot be replaced by another set of\n\n 21\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n contractual employees, but this is not the situation in the present\n case as contracts of Petitioners have expired and in between, the\n University was incorporated in the year 2019. \nInsofar as\n reliance on the judgment in \nNarender Singh Ahuja\n (supra) is\n concerned, no doubt, the Special Leave Petition filed against \nthe\n said judgment\n was dismissed on 26.03.2015, however, question\n of law was kept open. It is a settled law that wherein a lis the\n question of law is kept open by the Supreme Court, the\n underlying judgment losses its precedential value.\n The judgment\n in Kamlesh Kumar Vyas (supra) has been wrongly relied upon\n by the Petitioners as the said judgment was passed on a\n statement/concession by the counsel for the Respondent therein\n and cannot be considered as a binding judgment under \nArticle\n 141\n of the Constitution of India. \nInsofar as reliance on \nUma Devi\n\n (supra) is concerned, the same is misplaced, since far from\n helping the case of the Petitioners, it is an authority for the\n proposition that when a person enters a temporary employment\n or gets engagement as a contractual or casual worker, he is\n aware of the consequences of the nature of appointment and\n cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for\n confirmation in the post. It was further observed that in such a\n case, it cannot be held that State has held out any promise while\n engaging these persons, either to continue them or make them\n permanent. None of the other judgments also help the Petitioners\n for the same reason.\n\n \n(D) While the petition is drafted in a manner that it gives an\n impression that Petitioners are not seeking regularization but\n only renewal of the contracts, but the real motivation is to seek\n regularization and it is a settled law that law does not permit a\n person, to do indirectly something that cannot be done directly.\n The contractual appointments of the Petitioners have come to an\n end by afflux of time and any further direction to renew the\n contracts by the Court would be to enforce the contract of\n service, which cannot be be done by a writ Court and/or would\n amount to granting regularization, which would be in the teeth\n of the several judgments of the of the Supreme Court, including\n the celebrated judgment of \nUma Devi\n (supra).\n\n \n(E) Reliance is placed by the Petitioners on the judgment of the\n Supreme Court in \nPiara Singh\n (supra), overlooking the fact that\n in the judgment itself, the Supreme Court has observed that each\n Government and Authority has to devise its own criteria or\n principle for regularization having regard to all relevant\n circumstances and no case can be the same.\n \nIn \nState of\n Jharkhand and Another v. Harihar Yadav and Others\n, (2014) 2\n SCC 114, the obiter observations of the Supreme Court are not\n dispositive of the questions of law arising in the present writ\n petition. The present case is a different case on facts as, here the\n contractual employees are not being replaced nor were the\n Petitioners appointed for a project, which is continuing as are the\n\n 22\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n facts in the cases where the Courts have passed directions not to\n replace one contractual employee with the other.\n\n \n(F) Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in \nShri Bhoop\n Singh & Ors. v. Chairman-cum-Managing Director North\n Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd. & Anr., W.P. (C) Nos\n.\n 6483/2014 and 4484/2014, decided on 19.05.2015, wherein this\n Court declined to grant relief to the Petitioners who were\n appointed as security guards by North Eastern Electric Power\n Corporation Limited, for taking them back into service and for\n quashing the orders of the Respondent declining to extend their\n contractual employments. Court declined relief on the ground\n that Petitioners were not employed against a project and they\n were employed under a fixed term, which contracts had come to\n an end by afflux of time Court held that this was not the case\n where one set of contractual employees were being replaced by\n another set of employees and neither was it the case where it was\n an appointment for a project and the project was continuing.\n\nJudgment in the case of \nNarender Singh Ahuja\n (supra) is sought\n to be distinguished on the same argument.\n\n \n(G) Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the Division Bench\n of this Court in \nUnion of India & Anr. v. Satish Joshi\n, 2013 SCC\n OnLine Del 3161, for the proposition that no employee has a\n vested right to continue in employment, if the contract of\n employment has come to an end by afflux of time and cannot\n urge that his services are liable to be continued de hors the\n contract which he had voluntarily signed.\n\n 11. I have heard learned counsels for the parties and examined\n their rival contentions.\n\n 12. It is an undisputed fact between the parties that the\n Petitioners were appointed as Master Trainers on contractual\n basis between 2015 to 2018 and their contracts were renewed\n from time to time, without any break. The appointments were on\n consolidated remuneration at the WCSCs. It is equally\n undisputed that 20.19 Act came to be notified on 26.05.2020 and\n DTTE vide Notification dated 20.09.2021 published the approval\n granted by the GNETD for integration of 6 WCSCs into the\n University for academic and certification purposes. Petitioners\n have also put forth that the said Notification categorically\n provided that 58 posts existing in the 6 WCSCs were en-masse\n shifted to the University and significantly this, Notification was\n published by DTTE under the aegis of which the University\n functions, both administratively and financially This fact is also\n fortified by the Notice dated 28.01.2021 issued by DEFE notifying\n the integration of WCSCs into the University including that of the\n movable assets as also the 58 sanctioned posts, on existing terms\n and conditions and at the initial stages, all members of WCSCs\n including the Petitioners were invited to a joint meeting.\n\n 23\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n Relevant paras of the Notification dated 20.01.2021 and the\n Notice dated 28.01.2021 are as follows:-\n\n \"NOTIFICATION\n 20TH JANURARY 2021\n\n F.1(235)/Inclusion of WCSC/DSEU/SB/DTTE/2020/104: In\n exercise of powers conferred under Clause (xix) of \nSection 6\n of\n the Delhi Skill Entrepreneurship University Act, 2019 \n(Delhi Act\n\n 04 of 2020), the Government of NCT of Delhi vide Cabinet\n decision No. 2899 dated 13/11/2020 has approved the proposal\n for integration of six World Class Skill Centres as per list I and\n all upcoming World Class Skill Centers (excluding those which\n are being constructed on the campus of other Universities) as per\n list 2 into Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University for all\n academic and certification purposes.

Indisputably, the impugned advertisement dated 08.06.2021\n was published for inviting applications, for contractual\n employments in various disciplines in the post of Masters\n Trainers. It is not the case of the Respondents that the\n advertisement is for making regular appointments. Therefore, by\n virtue of this advertisement, the Respondents are seeking to fill\n the post of Master Trainers on 'contract' basis. The law on this\n issue is far too well-settled to even call for a discussion or debate\n In \nPiara Singh\n (supra), the Supreme Court held as follows:-\n\n \"45. The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through\n the prescribed agency but exigencies of administration may\n sometimes call for an ad hoc or temporary appointment to be\n made. In such a situation, effort should always be to replace\n such an ad hoc/temporary employee by a regularly selected\n employee as early as possible such a temporary employee may\n also compete along with others for such regular\n selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good, but if\n he does not, he must give way to the regularly selected\n candidate. The appointment of the regularly selected\n candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance for the sake\n of such an ad hoc/temporary employee.\n\n 46. Secondly, an ad hoc or temporary employee should not be\n replaced by another ad hoc or temporary employee; he must\n be replaced only by a regularly selected employee. This is\n necessary to avoid arbitrary action on the part of the\n appointing authority.\n\n xxxx\n\n 50. The proper course would be that each State prepares a\n scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation of\n such employees consistent with its reservation policy and if a\n scheme is already framed, the same may be made consistent\n with our observations herein so as to reduce avoidable\n litigation in this behalf. If and when such person is regularised\n he should be placed immediately below the last regularly\n appointed employee in that category, class or service as the\n case may be.\n\n 16. In Hargurpratap Singh v. State of Punjab and Another,\n (2007) 13 SCC 292, the Supreme Court held as follows:-\n\n \"3. We have carefully looked into the judgment of the High\n Court and other pleadings that have been put forth before this\n Court. It is clear that though the appellants may not be entitled\n to regular appointment as such it cannot be said that they will\n not be entitled to the minimum of the pay scale nor that they\n should not be continued till regular incumbents are appointed.\n\n 25\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n The course adopted by the High Court is to displace one ad hoc\n arrangement by another ad hoc arrangement which is not at\n all appropriate for these persons who have gained experience\n which will be more beneficial and useful to the colleges\n concerned rather than to appoint persons afresh on ad hoc\n basis. Therefore, we set aside the orders made by the High\n Court to the extent the same deny the claim of the appellants of\n minimum pay scale and continuation in service till regular\n incumbents are appointed. We direct that they shall be\n continued in service till regular appointments are made on\n minimum of the pay scale. The appeals shall stand allowed in\n part accordingly.\"\n\n 17. In Mohd. Abdul Kadir and Another'. Director General of\n Police, Assam and Others, (2009) 6-SCC 611, the Supreme Court\n held as follows:-\n\n \"17. When the ad hoc appointment is under a scheme and is in\n accordance with the selection process prescribed by the\n scheme, there is no reason why those appointed under the\n scheme should not be continued as long as the scheme\n continues. Ad hoc appointments under schemes are normally\n coterminous with the scheme (subject of course to earlier\n termination either on medical or disciplinary grounds, or for\n unsatisfactory service or on attainment of normal age of\n retirement). Irrespective of the length of their ad hoc service or\n the scheme, they will not be entitled to regularisation nor to\n the security of tenure and service benefits available to the\n regular employees. In this background, particularly in view of\n the continuing Scheme, the ex-serviceman emplayed after\n undergoing the selection process, need not be subjected to the\n agony, anxiety, humiliation and vicissitudes of annual\n termination and re-engagement, merely because their\n appointment is termed as ad hoc appointments.\n\n 18. We are therefore of the view that the learned Single Judge\n was justified in observing that the process of termination and\n reappointment every year should be avoided and the\n appellants should be continued as long as the Scheme\n continues, but purely on ad hoc and temporary basis,\n coterminous with the Scheme. The Circular dated 17-3-1995\n directing artificial breaks by annual terminations followed by\n fresh appointment, being contrary to the PIF Additional\n Scheme and contrary to the principles of service jurisprudence,\n is liable to be quashed.\"\n\n \n18. A similar issue came up before the Punjab and Haryana High\n Court in \nMalwinder Singh Mali v. Punjabi University, Patiala\n\n (through its Registrar), 1999 SCC OnLine P&H 1181, where the\n Petitioner was appointed as a Public Relations Officer on ad-hoc\n basis for six months or till the filling up of the post on regular\n\n 26\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n basis, whichever was earlier. Subsequently, an advertisement\n was issued for the post of Public Relations Officer along with\n other posts for filling up the post on regular basis. Petitioner also\n applied for the post and in the meantime, the terms of ad-hoc\n appointment of the Petitioner was extended by a period of six\n months. Petitioner had some grievance with the advertisement\n regarding the qualifications, which according to him, were tailor\n made to suit certain candidates. Petitioner also urged that his\n ad-hoc appointment should continue till regular appointment\n was made and the order by which his services were terminated\n be quashed. The High Court allowed the writ petition partly and\n the action of the University in curtailing the extension of the term\n was set aside with a direction to allow the Petitioner to continue\n on ad-hoc/temporary basis till the regular selection was made to\n the post of Public Relations Officer. Relevant part is as under:-\n\n \n\"6. The other prayer made in the writ petition is for quashing the\n order by which the services of the petitioner were terminated and\n the term of his extension curtailed till 31 December 1998. We find\n merit in this grievance of the petitioner. It has time and again\n been \nlaid down by\n this Court that the services of an\n adhoc/temporary employee can be terminated only on account\n of unsatisfactory work or if the post is not available or when a\n regularly selected candidate becomes available for appointment.\n The services of an ad hoc employee cannot be terminated without\n any reason when the post continues to exist and the University\n itself has readvertised the same to fill it up on regular basis. An\n ad hoc employee cannot be allowed to be replaced by another ad\n hoc employee or by some one on officiating basis as that would\n smack of arbitrariness. Some good reason has to be stated for\n terminating the services of ad hoc temporary employee The\n University being a statutory body is a \"State\" for purposes of \nArt.\n 12\n of the Constitution and every action of it should be guided by\n public interest and if it is shown that the exercise of power\n arbitrary, unhurt or unfair, the some will have to be struck\n down. We see no reason why the service of the petitioner should\n have been terminated when the post war available and the\n University having granted extension to hit tenure had to curtail\n the same when the Syndicate decided in the same very meeting\n that the post be filled up and it constituted a selection committee\n for the purpose. In the circumstances, the petitioner has a right\n to continue as a Public Relations Officer on ad hoc temporary\n basis till the University makes a regular selection Since the\n services of the petitioner were terminated without assigning any\n valid reason the same is held to be illegal and arbitrary and is\n hereby quashed.\n \nThe view that we have taken finds support from\n the judgments of this Court in the Rajni Bala case (\nvide supra),\n and Balwan Singh\n case (vide supra).\"\n\n 19. \nIn \nPradeep Navinbhai Patel and Ors. v. State of Gujarat and\n Ors.\n, 2014 SCC OnLine Guj 15846, the High Court was ceased of\n\n 27\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n a controversy raised by the Petitioners that they were appointed\n for a period of 11 months on contractual/ad-hoc-basis and\n therefore, till such time the regularly selected candidates are\n available, their services ought not to be terminated by other\n Assistant Professors/Lecturers on contractual/ad-hoc basis on\n the same terms and conditions. Challenge was also made to a\n Wesh advertisement issued by the State for appointment of ad\n hoc Assistant Professors/Lecturers for a period of 11 months. It is\n also urged that Petitioners were holding requisite qualifications\n and there was no justification for the State Government to issue\n fresh advertisement for recruiting ad-hoc or contractual\n appointees against the posts occupied by the Petitioners.\n Relevant paras of the judgment are as follows:-\n\n \n\"33. This Court has carefully perused the judgments in the case of\n \nSecretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (2) (Supra.)\n \nand\n \nSecretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3) (Supra.)\n as well as\n the judgment in Official Liquidator v Dayanand (Supra.) \nand\n \nMaharashtra State Road Transport Corporation v. Casterihe\n Rajya Parivahan Karmchari Sanghatana (Supra.\n).\n \nIn the case of\n \nSecretary, State of Karnataku v. Umadevi\n (2) (Supra), a\n reference was made se a Larger Bench of the Supreme Court\n regarding the issue whether employees appointed by the State or\n as Instrumentalities on temporary or casual bosis, or on daily\n wage, have a right to approach the High Court for issuance of a\n Writ of Mandamus directing that they may be made pernement\n or absorbed in the ports on which they are working.\n \nIn\n paragraph 26 of \nSecretary, State of Karnataka v Umadevi\n (3)\n (Spa), the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court did not\n approve of the principles of law \nlaid down in\n paragraph 50 of\n \nState of Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra\n), to the extent that\n direction send to the States to prepare a scheme for\n regularization of the temporary or casual or daily wage\n workers.\n \nThe reference to the Constitution Bench wax regarding\n regularisation of such employees and to that extent the principles\n of law \nlaid down in\n \nState of Haryana v Piara Singh (Supra\n),\n have been overruled by \nSecretary, State of Karnataka v Umadevi\n\n (3) (Supra).\n \nIn paragraph 50 regarding touching upon the\n regularization of temporary/casual workers and daily wagers\n have been averruled However, the principle of law enunciated in\n the judgment of \nState of Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra\n.), that\n adhoc employees should not be replaced by another adhoc\n employees has not been overruled. The judgment of State of\n Haryana.\n \nPiara Singh\n (Supra), as a whole, has not been\n overruled and the principles of law laid down to the effect that\n adhoc employees should not be replaced by other adhoc\n employees still holds good.\n\n xxxx xxxx xxx\n\n \n36. The principles settled in the decision of \nSecretary, State of\n Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3) (Supra), are those pertaining to\n regularization of temporary/casual/daily wage workers.\n\n 28\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n Having regard to the above, this Court is inclined to agree with\n the submissions advanced by learned Senior Counsel for the\n petitioners that ime principle of law \nlaid down in\n \nState of\n Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra\n), that adhoc employees ought not\n to be replaced by another set of adhoc employees, but only by\n regularly selected candidates, has not been diluted and still holds\n good.\n\n xxxx xxxx xxx\n\n \n38. It appears from the submissions made on behalf of the GPSC\n that the requisition for filling up regular posts has come from the\n State Government on 07.08.2013. The procedure for regular\n recruitment is still underway and, as per the submissions made\n by Mr. D. G. Shukla, learned Advocate for the GPSC, it may take\n another 10 to 12 months to complete the same. It may be true\n that the petitioners do not have any permanent right to the posts\n that they are occupying on adhoc basis; however, it is difficult to\n understand what rational purpose would be served in\n terminating the services of the petitioners and engaging fresh\n adhoc persons for eleven months. Such action would be in\n contradiction to the principle of law \nlaid down in\n the case of\n \nState of Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra\n.)\n \nas quoted in the\n judgment of \nSecretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3)\n (Supra). Moreover, it would lead to multifarious litigation, as is\n already the case.\n\n 39. As has been submitted on behalf of the petitioners, the\n challenge in the present petitions is limited only to the extent of\n the termination of the services of the petitioner to make way for\n another set of adhoc employees. It does not extend to those\n Assistant Professors/Lecturers, who may have been appointed in\n the Government Engineering Colleges and Government\n Polytechnics, pursuant to the advertisement dated 15.08.2013, or\n to any other vacant posts.\n\n 40. Accordingly, as a cumulative effect of the above discussion\n and for reasons stated hereinabove, and in view of the judgment\n of the Division Bench dated 07.09.2011 passed in Letters Patent\n Appeal No. 2986/2010 and connected matters, the petitions are\n partly allowed to the extent that the services of the petitioners as\n Assistant Professors/Lecturers on temporary/contractual basis\n in Government Engineering Colleges and Government\n Polytechnics shall not be terminated, till regularly selected\n candidates by the GPSC are available. It is clarified that this\n judgment shall not confer any right upon the petitioners to the\n posts on which they are working, after the regularly selected\n candidates through the GPSC are available.\"\n\n \n21. Counsel for the Petitioner has relied on several judgments, of\n this Court and the Central Administrative Tribunals, wherein\n reliefs have been granted to contractual employees, following the\n principle elucidated by the Supreme Court in \nPiara Singh\n\n (supra), however, this Court does not find the necessity to refer\n\n 29\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n to all of them and burden this judgment as the principle is well\n settled in \nPiara Singh\n (supra).\n \nRelevant would it be to refer to the\n judgment judgment in \nHarihar Yadav\n (supra), wherein the\n Supreme Court held that both States and Corporations have\n conveniently ostracized the concept of 'model employer' and that\n it would not be wrong to say that they have done so with pacific\n calmness, sans vision, shorn of responsibility and oblivious of\n their role in such a situation. Neither have the States nor the\n Corporations thought even for a moment of the livelihood of\n these employees. It is imperative for justice that a contractual\n employee be not replaced by another contractual employee\n leading the former in a despicable and abandoned state.\n\n 22. The crucial fact that needs to be highlighted in the present\n case is that at the time when the Petitioners came to be\n appointed, no regularly selected candidates were available\n and/or appointed to the post of Master Trainer and additionally,\n even today the advertisement impugned herein is not for\n appointment on regular basis and significantly, Respondents\n through the impugned advertisement seek appointment of\n Master Trainers only on contract basis. Therefore, it is not the\n case where Respondents have decided to replace the Petitioners\n with regular set of employees and the advertisement clearly\n reflects that it is to replace Petitioners with another set of\n contractual employees on the same terms and conditions as the\n Petitioners and concerned posts have been transferred en-masse\n from the WCSCs to the University. While there cannot be a\n quarrel with the proposition that being contractual employees,\n Petitioners cannot claim a permanent right to the posts and as\n and when regular appointment process is initiated, at best, they\n would be entitled to a right to apply and consideration as per\n law, given that they are otherwise eligible. Petitioners have\n averred at several places in the writ petition that they are not\n seeking regularization but only seek to continue till they are\n replaced by regular appointees and this position was reiterated\n by counsel for the Petitioners during the course of hearing. The\n scope of the present writ petition is, therefore, in a narrow\n compass as noted above, as to whether their services can be\n replaced by another set of contract employees, which the\n Respondents seek to do through the impugned advertisement and\n the answer can only be an emphatic 'No'. \nIn view of the binding\n dictum of the Supreme ctum of the Supreme Court in \nPiara Singh\n\n (supra), in my view, the action of the Respondents to replace the\n Petitioners is totally untenable and unsustainable in law.\n\n \n23. Much was argued by counsel for the Respondents that the\n judgment in \nUma Devi\n (supra) supports the case of the\n Respondents and rules against the contentions of the Petitioners.\n This contention, in my view, merits rejection.\n \nThe principle\n settled in the decision of \nUma Devi\n (supra) was primarily with\n respect to regularization of temporary/casual/daily wager\n employees and does not deal with the principle of law settled by\n\n 30\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n the Supreme Court in \nPiara Singh\n (supra) i.e. contract/ad-hoc\n employees cannot be replaced by another set of contract/ad-hoc\n employees but only by regularly selected candidates and this\n principle has not been diluted in \nUma Devi\n (supra) or thus far by\n any other judgment of the Supreme Court or a Bench of equal or\n larger strength and still holds good.\n \nCounsel for the Respondents\n has tried to distinguish the judgment in the \nNarender Singh\n Ahuja\n (supra) of the Division Bench of this Court by urging that\n the judgment was carried in appeal to the Supreme Court and\n while the SLP was dismissed in limine, the question of law was\n left open and therefore, it is no longer open for the Petitioners to\n rely on the judgment which has lost its precedential välue.\n \nThe\n argument does not any way inure to the advantage of the\n Respondents since the case of the Petitioners is based on the\n binding dictum of the Supreme Court in \nPiara Singh\n (supra) and\n therefore, even if the question of law is kept open, Respondents\n have been unable to show any judgment of the Supreme Court\n which lays the law contrary to the one propounded in \nPiara\n Singh\n (supra) In Vidyavardhaka Sangha (supra), the Supreme\n Court has held that appointments made for a specified period of\n time come to an end by afflux of time and persons holding the\n posts cannot have any right to continue. The question that arises\n in the present petition of replacement of a contract employee\n with another contract employee was not the issue arising for\n consideration in the said case and the judgment is thus\n distinguishable on the facts.\n \nThe judgment in \nShri Bhoop Singh\n\n (supra) was on a different conspectus of facts. In the said case,\n the Petitioners were sought to be replaced by outsourcing the\n work of security to an outside agency and the Court held that\n while there is no dispute to the proposition of law that one set of\n contract employees cannot be replaced by another set of contract\n employees, however, it is different where the employer changes\n the method of security by giving the responsibility to a security\n agency specialized in the field and where the terms of\n engagement of the new employees are wholly different.\n \nA bare\n reading of the facts in \nSatish Jeshi\n (supra) shows that the\n question for consideration before the Division Bench of this Court\n was whether the Respondent therein had a vested right in\n continuing with his employment once the contract came to an\n end by afflux of time and the issue that arises in the present case\n was not even remotely the question before the Division Bench i.e.\n replacement of a contract employee by another contract\n employee.\n\n 24. Accordingly, it is directed that the Petitioners shall be re-\n engaged by the Respondents by renewing their contracts and\n their services shall not be dispensed with till regularly selected\n candidates join the posts in question. It is made clear that this\n judgment does not confer any rights upon the Petitioners to\n continue after the regularly selected candidates are appointed\n and nor should the observations of the Court be construed to\n\n 31\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n mean or connote that the Court has conferred the status of\n regular employees on the Petitioners.\"\n\n \n10.2 Judgment of the Hon‟ble High Court in Punjab and Haryana\n\n in Civil Writ Petition No. 12126 of 2014 in the matter of \nRanjeet\n\n Singh and others Vs.

The petitioners except petitioners No.4 and 7 are\n admittedly working with respondent-Institute. It is undisputed\n that work is available and petitioners are working on contract\n basis.

Govt. of NCT of Delhi\n\n Paras\n 07, 13, 15 to 17 of the judgment reads as under:\n\n \n\"7. Shri Luthra, further submits that replacement of one set of\n contractual employees with another set of 5 OA No-2112 of\n 2020 such employees is against the settled principles of law, as\n a contractual employee can only be replaced/substituted by\n regularly selected candidate and the respondents can\n disengage the services of the applicants only when there is no\n work available against which the applicants have been\n engaged and have been continuing for around six years\n and/or when the posts against which the applicants have been\n\n 32\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n engaged are filled by the respondents by regular selection in\n accordance with the relevant rules. To strengthen his\n submissions, learned counsel for the applicants has \nplaced\n reliance upon\n the Judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court\n dated 3.11.2014 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.1741/2014, titled\n \nNarinder Singh Ahuja and others vs. The Secretary, Ministry\n of Health and Family Welfare and others\n (Annexure A/6). He\n further submits that the aforesaid Judgment of the Hon'ble\n Delhi High Court has been upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n as much as SLP (Civil) No.8706/2015 filed by the Union of\n India against the same has been rejected by the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court vide Judgment dated 27.3.2015 (Annexure\n A/7).\n \nHe has 6 OA No-2112 of 2020 further \nplaced reliance\n upon\n the Order/Judgment of a coordinate Bench of this\n Tribunal dated 12.8.2016 in OA No.2149/2016, titled \nMs.\n Shikha Jain and others vs. Union of India and another\n\n (Annexure A/8). The said Order/Judgment of this Tribunal\n has also been upheld by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide\n Judgment dated 27.7.2017 in Writ Petition (Civil)\n No.5073/2017 (Annexure A/9).\n \nFurther reliance has been\n placed by the learned counsel for the applicants on the law \nlaid\n down by\n the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nState of\n Haryana and others vs. Piara Singh and others\n, reported in\n 1992 (4) SCC 118, (Annexure A/10). Learned counsel for the\n applicants further submits that the applicants have been\n performing their duties to the entire satisfaction of the\n authorities concerned.\n\n \n13. The said judgment dated 3.11.2014 of the Hon'ble High\n Court of Delhi in \nNarinder Singh Ahuja\n's case (supra) was\n challenged by the Union of India before the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court has dismissed the Special\n Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8706/2018 vide Order/Judgment\n dated 27.3.2015 (Annexure A/7).\n \nIn \nShikha Jain\n's case (supra),\n the applicants, eight in numbers, who had been working as\n Programme Assistant on contract basis in the National Aids\n Control Organization of Ministry of Health and Family\n Welfare, Govt. of India, have approached this Tribunal vide\n OA No.2149/2016. The grievance of the applicants therein was\n that the respondents have not been extending their respective\n contract beyond 30.6.2016 mainly on the ground that the\n respondents 16 OA No-2112 of 2020 have decided to hire the\n support staff from the domestic budgetary support through an\n outsource agency.\n \nAfter considering various decisions of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as the judgement of the Hon'ble\n Delhi High Court in \nNarinder Singh Ahuja\n's case (supra), this\n Tribunal held in paragraphs 9 and 12 of the Order/judgment\n dated 12.8.2016 (Annexure A/8) as under:-\n\n \"9. Admittedly, it is not the case of the respondents that\n there is no work available after 30.06.2016. On the\n\n 33\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n other hand, it is specifically stated that they will hire the\n support staff through an outsourced agency. That\n means that the respondents are intending to replace the\n applicants, who are working on contract basis, for the\n last few years, with another set of contract employees,\n may be, through outsourced agencies. The said action of\n replacing one set of contract employees with another set\n of contract employees is clearly against to the settled\n principles of law. Even the aforesaid decision of the\n Hon'ble High Court is to the same effect.\"\n\n \"12. In the circumstances and for the aforesaid reasons\n the OA is partly allowed and accordingly, the\n respondents are directed to continue the applicants on\n the same terms and conditions as long as there is work\n or till the vacancies are filled up on regular basis. No\n order as to costs.\"\n\n \n15. From the law \nlaid down by\n the Hon ble Apex Court in \nPiara\n Singh\n's case (supra) and that by the Hon ble High Court of\n Delhi in Narinder Singh Ahuja's 19 OA No-2112 of 2020 case\n (\nsupra) and Shikha Jain\n's case (supra), it is evident that\n replacement of a contract employee(s) by fresher(s), junior(s)\n or even a staff from an outsource agency is prohibited. No\n statutory provision has been brought to our notice by the\n respondents, which takes away the right of preferential\n treatment to the daily wager or contractual employees, who\n are already engaged and are working for continuation on\n contract to junior(s), fresher(s) or the person(s) to be engaged\n through outsourcing agency to be taken away.\n\n 16. \nIn view of the facts as noted hereinabove and law as \nlaid\n down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and Hon'ble High\n Court of Delhi, referred to hereinabove, we are of the\n considered view that action of the respondents of not\n continuing the engagement of the applicants as Driver on\n contract basis and their action of replacing them by another\n set of contractual employees through outsourcing is not\n tenable in the eyes of law.\n\n 17. In the result, for the foregoing reasons, the present OA is\n partly allowed and the respondents are 20 OA No-2112 of\n 2020 directed to continue the applicants on the same terms\n and conditions of on contract basis as long as there is work\n available with the respondents and/or till the vacancies are\n filled up on regular basis.

From the facts and circumstances of the case, it is clear\n that though the applicants were engaged as per the offer of\n appointment letters under the alleged scheme and policy\n \nreferred to above\n, on part time hourly basis and though the\n respondents have submitted that the applicants can work in\n the remaining time after 32 hours per week anywhere else, but\n however, in view of the monthly biometric attendance sheet\n shown to us, it is clear that the applicants are actually working\n regularly for 7 to 9 hours a day and moreover as per paras 6 &\n\n \n11 of the terms and condition of offer of appointment extracted\n above, their original certificates were kept with the\n respondents as such practically they are not allowed to work\n for any other employer, we are of the view that engagements\n of the applicants are nothing but a new device of engagement\n to deprive the applicants the status of contract engagement so\n as to deny them the benefit of even continuity of engagement,\n in accordance with the law \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in catena of cases right from 1992 in the above said\n \nPiara Singh\n's case (supra) and in \nUma Devi\n's case (supra)\n which has been emphatically stated in the above extracted\n portion of the judgment in Sheo Narain case (supra), until\n regular appointments are made to the said posts and,\n therefore, the action of the respondents including the above\n extracted scheme and policy are against the principles of law\n laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above referred\n cases and also against the principles underlying \nArticle 14\n, 16\n\n of the Constitution of India as stated in the above said case of\n Sheo Narain and are in contravention of the duty enjoined on\n the respondent-state under \nArticle 37\n read with \nArticle 39 (d)\n\n and (e) of the Constitution of India and also in view of the\n experience gained by the applicants for having worked with\n the respondents from the academic year 2017-2018, the\n respondents are bound by the law laid down by the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court referred to and extracted above to continue the\n applicants until the respondents make regular appointments\n as per Recruitment Rules.\n\n 15. Accordingly the OA is partly allowed with a direction to the\n respondents to continue the engagement of applicants in the\n posts kept vacant in view of the interim order dated 22.11.2019\n until the making of regular appointments as per Recruitment\n Rules. No order as to costs.\"\n\n 35\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n 10.5 Judgment of the Hon‟ble High Court of Delhi dated\n\n 03.11.2014 in WP(C) No. 1741/2014 in the matter of Narinder\n\n Singh Ahuja and ors. Vs. The Secretary, Ministry of\n\n Health. Paras 15 to 17 of the judgment reads as under:\n\n \"15. In the opinion of this Court, since the respondents nowhere\n dispute that there is need for the performance of the work that\n the petitioners were discharging all along and there is also no\n dispute that the project and funding (for the project) would\n continue till 2017, the decision to discontinue the petitioners'\n engagement is based only on the policy to outsource the\n contractual employment to a third party. The petitioners are\n not insisting on regularization, given the nature of the\n employment or engagement, which is project based. However\n apart from the decision to \"outsource\" engagement, of contract\n employment to a third agency, there is no rationale to\n discontinue the petitioners contracts. The justification that the\n employees engaged through the contractor are paid lower\n wages is arbitrary, because the \"outsourced\" or outsourcing\n agency would have to be paid its service charges. The lower\n wages paid, therefore, is, in effect, because of the charges/fees\n paid to the contractor/outsourced agency. The facts of this\n case clearly reveal that even though the work is to be\n performed by contractual employees, the reason for\n discontinuance of the petitioners' employment is not their\n replacement with regular appointees, but instead, with\n another set of contractual employees. The state/respondents\n cannot, in the circumstances of this case, say that\n discontinuance of such employment cannot be gone into by the\n Court because the petitioners were aware that their contracts\n ended.\n\n W.P.(C) 1741/2014 Page 15\n\n 16. For the above reasons, this court is of opinion that the CAT\n erred in law, in holding that the petitioners could not complain\n against the discontinuance of their contractual employment.\n Accordingly, a direction is issued to the respondents to\n continue the petitioners in contractual employment on annual\n renewal basis, till the currency of the RNTCP scheme/project\n in 2017. An appropriate consequential order shall be issued by\n the respondents within eight weeks from today.\n\n 17. The impugned order of the CAT is accordingly set aside, the\n writ petition is allowed in terms of the above directions.\"\n\n 36\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n 10.6 Judgment of this Tribunal dated 25.03.2010 in OA No. 1184\n\n of 2009 in the matter of \nPraveen Khan Vs. Govt. of NCT\n .\n\n Para 5 of the judgment reads as under:\n\n \n\"5. The issue is thus well settled on the basis of the judicial\n precedents cited above that a set a contractual employees shall\n not be replaced by another set of contractual employees except\n if the contractual employees are not working satisfactorily.\n The reference is thus answered. The judgement in \nRuchi Singh\n\n (supra) is overruled to this extent.\n \nThe Original Applications\n are remitted to the DB for further adjudication\n\n 10.7 Judgment of this Tribunal dated 15.09.2009 in OA No. 1184\n\n of 2009 in the matter of \nPraveen Khan Vs. Govt. of NCT\n\n Paras\n 23 and 24 of the judgment reads as under:\n\n \n\"23. Similarly in the case of \nAmit Kumar Sharma and Others\n Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi\n also, the question whether one set of\n contractual employees could have been replaced by another set\n of contractual employees has not been dealt with, therefore,\n that judgment is distinguishable.\n\n 24. In view of above, let this matter be placed before the\n Hon'ble Chairman on administrative side for constituting a\n Full Bench to decide the issue authoritatively whether one set\n of contractual employees can be replaced by others when\n process for regular selection has already been initiated.\"\n\n \n10.8 Judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court dated 07.09.2003\n\n in the matter of \nHargurpratap Singh Vs. State of Punjab\n\n and others\n in Civil Appeal No. 8745/2003. Para 3 of the\n\n judgment reads as under:\n\n \"3. We have carefully looked into the judgment of the High Court\n and other pleadings that have been put forth before this Court. It is\n clear that though the appellants may not be entitled to regular\n appointment as such it cannot be said that they will not be entitled\n to the minimum of the pay scale nor that they should not be\n continued till regular incumbents are appointed. The course\n adopted by the High Court is to displace one ad hoc arrangement\n by another ad hoc arrangement which is not at all appropriate for\n these persons who have gained experience which will be more\n\n 37\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n beneficial and useful to the colleges concerned rather than to\n appoint persons afresh on ad hoc basis. Therefore, we set aside the\n orders made by the High Court to the extent the same deny the\n claim of the appellants of minimum pay scale and continuation in\n service till regular incumbents are appointed. We direct that they\n shall be continued in service till regular appointments are made on\n minimum of the pay scale. The appeals shall stand allowed in part\n accordingly.\"\n\n 10.9 Judgment of the the Hon‟ble Supreme Court decided on\n\n 06.12.2000 in the matter of Commissioner, Kendriya\n\n Vidyalya Sangathan & ors. Vs. Anil Kumar Singh &\n\n Ors. in Civil Appeal No. 11785/1996. Paras 1 and 2 of the\n\n judgment reads as under:\n\n \"1. The employer Commissioner, Kendriya Vidyalaya\n Sangathan is in appeal against the judgment of the Madhya\n Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 782 of 1995 which\n was upheld in appeal by the Division Bench. The respondents\n had been appointed on contractual basis and just before the\n expiry of the contractual period, they approached the High\n Court with the prayer that their services should not be\n terminated until the posts are filled up by a process of regular\n recruitment. The learned Single Judge by his order dated 6-4-\n 1995 disposed of the writ petition following an earlier\n judgment of be allowed to continue till the posts are filled up\n by process of regular recruitment, and those petitioners should\n be allowed to compete with other candidates if they apply for\n selection and if they are otherwise not disqualified. The High\n Court also took additional care by indicating that the writ\n petitioners cannot claim any additional advantage by virtue of\n their experience by working for the contractual period. \nIn the\n aforesaid premises, we do not find any infirmity with \nthe said\n judgment\n of the High Court to be interfered with by this Court.\n The expression \"if they are otherwise not disqualified\" would\n obviously mean they must have the necessary qualifications,\n as required, under the relevant rules for being appointed as a\n teacher and then they have to compete along with others for\n adjudication of their merit for being appointed. The\n apprehension of the employer that the impugned judgment\n directs condonation of the age is wholly unfounded.\n\n 2. In the aforesaid premises, we do not find any justification\n for interference with the direction given by the High Court.\n Civil appeals are accordingly dismissed.\"\n\n 38\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n \n11. On equal pay for equal work, the applicants are discharging\n duties similar to those of regular Law Officers. The Hon‟ble\n Supreme Court in \nJagjit Singh\n (supra) held that temporary\n employees performing the same duties as regular employees\n cannot be paid less than the minimum of the pay scale of regular\n employees, subject to differences in qualifications and recruitment\n process.\n\n \n12. Keeping in view the law \nlaid down by\n the Hon‟ble Courts and\n this Tribunal in the judgments \nreferred above\n, we hold that the\n applicants are entitled to wages at least equivalent to the\n minimum of the pay scale attached to the post of Law Officer in\n Delhi Prisons. However, parity in allowances such as LTC,\n gratuity, etc., which are service benefits attached to regular\n employment, cannot be extended in absence of statutory rules or\n scheme.\n\n 13. On claim for service benefits, while applicants‟ grievance about\n denial of leave, HRA, EPF etc. is understandable, grant of such\n benefits is a matter of policy. \nIn \nSecretary, State of\n Karnataka & Ors. Vs. Umadevi & Ors.\n, (2006) 4 SCC 1, the\n Hon‟bleSupreme Court cautioned against judicial directions\n amounting to creation of service conditions for contractual staff.\n Therefore, beyond wages at par with regulars, applicants cannot\n claim parity in other allowances. However, statutory benefits like\n EPF and ESI, if applicable under law, must be extended.\n\n 14. On legality of recruitment notice, in view of our finding, the\n advertisement seeking to engage another set of contractual Law\n Officers to replace the applicants cannot be sustained and is liable\n to be quashed. The respondents, however, remain at liberty to\n initiate a process for regular recruitment under applicable rules.\n\n 15. For the foregoing reasons, the O.A. is partly allowed with the\n following directions:-\n\n 39\n\nItem No. 21/C-II\n\n OA No. 1549/2025\n\n i. The recruitment notice issued by the respondents of OIC-\n\n Estt. Branch-PHQ upload memo no. F.18\n (26)/Estt./PHQ/2025/ CD No. 3799530/2947 dated\n\n 25.04.2025 (Annexure A-1) proposing to engage fresh\n contractual Law Officers is quashed.\n\n ii. The applicants shall not be replaced by another set of\n contractual appointees. However, respondents are at liberty\n to initiate regular recruitment, in which case applicants\n shall also be free to apply subject to eligibility.\n iii. The applicants shall be entitled to wages equivalent to the\n minimum of the pay scale of regular Law Officers from the\n date of joining the services of the respondents, but shall not\n be entitled to parity in allowances such as LTC, gratuity,\n etc., except statutory benefits like EPF/ESI wherever\n applicable.\n\n iv. The respondents shall comply with these directions within a\n period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of\n this order.\n\n 16. Pending MA (s), if any, shall also stand disposed of\n accordingly.\n\n 17. No order as to costs.\n\n (Rajinder Kashyap) (R.N. Singh)\n Member (A) Member (J)\n\n /neetu/ks",

It has time and again\n been \nlaid down by\n this Court that the services of an\n adhoc/temporary employee can be terminated only on account\n of unsatisfactory work or if the post is not available or when a\n regularly selected candidate becomes available for appointment.\n The services of an ad hoc employee cannot be terminated without\n any reason when the post continues to exist and the University\n itself has readvertised the same to fill it up on regular basis. An\n ad hoc employee cannot be allowed to be replaced by another ad\n hoc employee or by some one on officiating basis as that would\n smack of arbitrariness.

The petitioners are\n not insisting on regularization, given the nature of the\n employment or engagement, which is project based. However\n apart from the decision to \"outsource\" engagement, of contract\n employment to a third agency, there is no rationale to\n discontinue the petitioners contracts. The justification that the\n employees engaged through the contractor are paid lower\n wages is arbitrary, because the \"outsourced\" or outsourcing\n agency would have to be paid its service charges. The lower\n wages paid, therefore, is, in effect, because of the charges/fees\n paid to the contractor/outsourced agency. The facts of this\n case clearly reveal that even though the work is to be\n performed by contractual employees, the reason for\n discontinuance of the petitioners' employment is not their\n replacement with regular appointees, but instead, with\n another set of contractual employees. The state/respondents\n cannot, in the circumstances of this case, say that\n discontinuance of such employment cannot be gone into by the\n Court because the petitioners were aware that their contracts\n ended."

The High\n Court also took additional care by indicating that the writ\n petitioners cannot claim any additional advantage by virtue of\n their experience by working for the contractual period. \nIn the\n aforesaid premises, we do not find any infirmity with \nthe said\n judgment\n of the High Court to be interfered with by this Court.\n The expression \"if they are otherwise not disqualified\" would\n obviously mean they must have the necessary qualifications,\n as required, under the relevant rules for being appointed as a\n teacher and then they have to compete along with others for\n adjudication of their merit for being appointed. The\n apprehension of the employer that the impugned judgment\n directs condonation of the age is wholly unfounded."
