Kalyani (India) Private Ltd. has filed an application under\nOrder I\nRule 10 Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as \"\nCPC\n\")\nto be impleaded as a party in the present Suit for Specific performance of an\nAgreement to Sell dated 26.03.2012 between the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\n2. The facts in brief as narrated in the application are that the\nresidential property consisting of Basement, Ground Floor and First Floor\nbuilt on Plot No.38, Block-B, Masjid Moth, Panchsheel Enclave, Chirag\nDelhi-110017 measuring 216 Sq. Metres (hereinafter referred to as \"suit\nproperty\"), of which the defendant was the owner, had been mortgaged with\nPunjab National Bank by the original owners/ allottees. On account of their\nfailure to pay the bank dues, the proceedings were initiated by the Bank\nunder the\nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\nEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002\n(hereinafter referred to as\n\"\nSARFAESI Act\n\"). Punjab National Bank, Mayur Vihar, Phase-II, Delhi\nheld an auction of suit property under the provisions of the SARFESI Act,\n2002 on 31st December, 2018. The applicant was declared as the highest\nbidder in the auction. The sale in favour of the applicant was confirmed by\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 2 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nthe Bank vide letter dated 01st January, 2019 and the Sale Certificate dated\n15th February, 2019 was executed in its favour on 12th June, 2019, and\nregistered on 14th June, 2019 in the Office of Sub-Registrar, 5-A, Hauz\nKhas, New Delhi.\n\n3. The applicant has asserted that the entire sale consideration of Rs.\n4,90,25,000/- has already been paid by him to the Punjab National Bank and\nthe sale transaction has been concluded, despite which the Bank has failed\nto hand over the possession of the property for the reasons and causes\nattributable to the plaintiff in the present suit.\n\n4. On 20th March, 2020 the applicant became aware of the present Suit\nas well as the Order 16th July, 2013. An application was filed before the\nlearned CMM, Saket Courts, New Delhi and a Receiver was appointed vide\nOrder dated 20th March, 2016 with the direction to take physical possession\nof the suit property.\n\n5.\nIn the interim, Shri Mayank Sharma who is the family member of the\nborrower had filed a suit for Partition bearing CS (OS) 664/2018 titled\n\nMayank Sharma vs. Santosh Sharma\nand obtained interim protection in his\nfavour on 21st December, 2018 by concealing the true facts before the High\nCourt of Delhi. The Receiver was unable to take physical possession due to\nthe interim Order dated 21st December, 2018. The applicant on becoming\naware of the Order dated 21st December, 2018 moved an application under\nOrder I rule 10\nCPC\nfor impleadment in the said proceedings. Likewise,\nPunjab National Bank also filed an application under\nOrder I Rule 10 of the\nCPC\nand also an application under\nOrder XXXIX Rule 4 of the CPC\nfor\nvacating the interim stay. This Court after hearing the parties vacated the\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 3 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nstay dated 21st December, 2018 and disposed of the respective applications\nof the applicant as well as the Bank.\n\n6. Thereafter, fresh directions were obtained by the Bank from the\nlearned CMM vide Order dated 28th February, 2020 and the respondent\nissued a Notice for taking physical possession of the mortgaged property in\nquestion.\nIn the mean while, plaintiff also filed an application for early\nhearing in case titled\nSA/NDN/243/2019 Subhash Arora vs. PNB\nwhich is\npending before the DRT-I, New Delhi. After hearing arguments on the\napplication, the directions were issued by the learned Tribunal to the\nplaintiff to make payment but the plaintiff failed to make payment to the\nBank in terms of Order dated 20th March, 2020. It is asserted that the\nplaintiff is trying to get the benefit of the interim protection granted by this\nCourt on 16th July, 2013 and 06th April, 2014. It is apparent that the original\nborrower as well as the plaintiff are in collusion with each other and have\nfiled vague litigations merely to misguide the Court by concealing real facts.\n\n7. It is asserted that the applicant being the directly affected party, whose\npresence is not only necessary but also inevitable, may be permitted to be\nimpleaded as a party to the present proceedings. The application for\nimpleadment is accordingly filed on behalf of the applicant.\n\n8. The plaintiff in its reply to the application has asserted that the\nalleged transaction in favour of Punjab National Bank was entered into\neither to defeat the Orders of the Court or to violate it and it confers no right,\ntitle or interest in favour of transferee. This Court vide Order dated 16th July,\n2013 which had been finally confirmed on 04th August, 2014 had restrained\nthe defendants, their legal heirs, agents, assignees from Selling, transferring,\nalienating or creating the third party interest in the Suit Property. In utter\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 4 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\ndisregard to the said Order, defendants created a mortgage in favour of\nPunjab National Bank on 02nd August, 2014. The contempt has therefore,\nbeen committed of the Order dated 16th July, 2013 intentionally and\ndeliberately. It is asserted that the mortgage and the securitization action\ninitiated by the Bank qua the suit property is void ab initio and consequent\nauction/ sale confers no right, title or interest in the suit property in favour of\nthe applicant. The plaintiff has claimed that on becoming aware of the\nproceedings before the DRT-I and about the securitization proceedings, it\nsought a declaration of the entire auction/ proceedings to be declared a\nnullity, illegal and void ab initio. The said application is pending\nadjudication before the Tribunal.\n\n9. In March, 2020, the plaintiff filed an I.A 539/2020 for restraining the\nBank/ Court Receiver from taking action against the suit property. The\nstatus quo was directed to be maintained by DRT-III in terms of Order dated\n20th March, 2020 and restrained further proceedings under\nSARFAESI Act\n\nsubject to deposit of balance consideration by the plaintiff. This Order was\nchallenged by the plaintiff before the DRAT and after hearing the matter, it\nhas been reserved for judgment.\n\n10. It is asserted that the applicant had preferred an application seeking\nimpleadment before DRAT but the application was dismissed vide Order\ndated 19th August, 2020 by holding that since it was not a party before the\nDRT, it cannot be permitted to intervene in the Appeal.\n\n11. The plaintiff had preferred an S.A. before DRT in February, 2019\nchallenging the SARFAESI action despite which the applicant has\napproached this Court only now and the applicant, even if for the sake of\narguments is held to be a proper party, it cannot be permitted to join the\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 5 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nproceedings at this belated stage. For this reliance has been placed on\nVidur\nImpex and Traders (P) Ltd. vs. Tosh Apartments (P) Ltd.\n(2012) 8 SCC 384.\nMoreover, this case is at the stage of defendant's evidence and addition of\nany new party at this stage would unnecessarily delay the proceedings.\n\n12. The plaintiff has further claimed that the jurisdiction of this Court to\nentertain any proceedings in respect of the matter before the Debt Recovery\nTribunal or Appellate Tribunal is ousted under\nSection 34\nof the SARFAESI\nAct, 2002. This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the application under\nreply of the auction purchaser/applicant. The mortgage and the securitization\naction initiated by the Bank in respect of the suit property is void ab initio\nand this issue is pending adjudication before the DRT. It is claimed that the\napplication is therefore, liable to dismissed.\n\n13. The plaintiff has further asserted that it is dominus litus of the suit and\ncannot be forced to add parties against whom he does not want to fight\nunless it is a compulsion of law. Present is a suit for Specific Performance\nof Agreement to Sell entered between the plaintiff and the defendant. The\napplicants are not deriving their alleged title from the defendants but are\nclaiming an independent title. The scope of a suit for specific performance is\nlimited and it cannot be permitted to be converted into a Title suit.\nMoreover, presence of applicant is not required for effective adjudication of\nthe present suit. It is, therefore, submitted that the present application is\nwithout merit, and is liable to be dismissed.\n\n14. Submissions heard.\n\n15. The plaintiff in the present suit had originally filed a suit for\nPermanent and Mandatory injunction in respect of the suit premises.\nSubsequently, the plaint was amended to include a suit for Specific\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 6 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nPerformance of the Agreement to Sell dated 26.03.2012. Vide Order dated\n16.07.2013, while considering I.A. No. 8884/2013, filed by the plaintiff\nunder Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 read with\nSection 151\nof the CPC interim\nrestraint Order was made, relevant part of which is reproduced as under:\n\n\"7. Till the next date of hearing, the Defendants,\ntheir legal heirs, agents, assignees are restrained\nfrom Selling, transferring, alienating or creating any\ncharge or third party interest on the suit property i.e.\nthe basement, ground floor, first floor and terrace\nover third floor of the property at No. D-38,\nPanchsheel Enclave, Panchsheel Marg, New Delhi-\nl10017 built up on a plot of land admeasuring 265 sq.\nyards.\"\n\n\"8. Plaintiff to comply with the provisions of Order\nXXXIX Rule 3 within one week from today.\"\n\n16. It is significant to note that as per the averments made in the plaint\nwhile entering into an Agreement to Sell, the plaintiff had been informed by\nthe defendant No.1 that their Company, Dimension Architecture Pvt. Ltd\n(defendant no. 4) had a dispute with United Bank of India from which it had\navailed financial assistance and the defendant nos. 1 to 3 were the\nGuarantors and the suit property had been given by them to the Bank as\ncollateral security towards the financial assistance.\n\n17. The plaint further states that Defendant nos. 1 and 2 had assured that\nthey would get the property converted to freehold and from the part\npayments paid by the plaintiff towards the sale consideration of the suit\nproperty, they would resolve the issues and get the collateral security\nreleased and discharged from the Bank. The plaintiff was thus, well aware at\nthe time of entering into the Agreement to Sell itself about the charge which\nhad been created and that the suit property was encumbered.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 7 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\n18. The defendant had also duly disclosed in its Written Statement that a\ncash credit limit of Rs. 500 lakhs was sanctioned in favour of the defendants\nby United Bank of India on 18.12.2009 and for the purpose of this credit\nfacility extended by the Bank, the collateral security was created by way of\nequitable mortgage of the suit property in favour of the Bank in addition to\nhypothecation of the plant and machinery and the personal guarantee of the\nDirectors. A sum of Rs. 252 lakhs out of the Cash Credit Facility was paid\nby the Bank and it assured the disbursement of balance cash facility of Rs.\n248 lakhs as and when required. From the balance amount, the defendants\nwere allowed to avail and utilize the limit of Rs. 90 lakhs besides Rs. 252\nlakhs that was disbursed to it.\n\n19. The Defendants made a payment of Rs. 20 lakhs till March, 2010 to\nthe Bank. Thereafter, on account of false representations by the Bank to\ndisburse the balance amount, the defendants undertook a huge project of\napproximately Rs. 4.5 crores. However, the Bank unilaterally stopped the\ncredit facility severely affecting the business prospects of the defendants\nwho suffered heavy financial losses.\n\n20. The defendants has further disclosed that the Bank issued a Notice\ndated 24.06.2010 under\nSection 13 (2)\nread with\nSection 13 (13)\nof the\nSARFAESI Act, wherein a sum of Rs. 3,43,52,727.00/- was claimed. The\nplaintiff while entering into the Agreement to Sell was in the knowledge of\nthe property being encumbered with the Bank.\n\n21. The present application for impleadment has been filed by the\napplicant who is a purchaser of the suit property in an auction purchase\nconducted by the Bank with whom the property was encumbered. The short\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 8 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nissue is whether the applicant can be allowed to be impleaded in the present\nproceedings for specific performance of Agreement to Sell.\n\n22. Order I Rule 10 (2)\nof the CPC\nempowers the Court to strike out the\nname of the name of any person improperly joined as plaintiff or defendant\nand also to add the name of the plaintiff or defendant who should be joined\nor whose presence before the Court may be necessary to enable the Court to\neffectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all the issues involved\nin the suit.\n\n23. In Kasturi v. Iyyamperumal and Others (2005) 6 SCC 733, the\nSupreme Court observed that the parties necessary in a suit for specific\nperformance are those who are party to the contract or their legal\nrepresentatives in case they are death and a person who had purchased the\ncontracted property from the vendor. A subsequent purchaser is a necessary\nparty as he would be affected if he had purchased with or without notice of\nthe Contract, but a person who claims adversely to the claim of a vendor is\nhowever not a necessary party. For deciding the question who is the proper\nparty in a suit for specific performance, the guiding principle is that the\npresence of such party is necessary to adjudicate the controversies involved\nin the suit for specific performance of the Contract for sale. The twin test to\nbe satisfied for determining the question who is a necessary party are: (1)\nThere must be a right to some relief against such party in respect of the\ncontroversies involved in the proceedings; and (2) no effective decree can be\npassed in the absence of such party.\n\n24. It was further observed in Kasturi(Supra) that\nSection 19\nSub-sections\n\n(a) to (e) of the\nSpecific Relief Act\nmake it absolutely clear that a person\nseeking addition in the suit for specific performance of the Contract for sale\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 9 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nwho are not claiming under the vendor but are claiming adverse to the title\nof the vendor do not fall in any of the category enumerated in\nSection 19\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act.\nSection 19\nis exhaustive on the question as to who\nare the parties against whom a Contract for specific performance may be\nenforced. Thus, the question is to be decided keeping in mind the scope of\nthe suit. If on the addition of the person, the scope of the suit for specific\nperformance would be enlarged and would be converted to a suit for title,\npresence of such parties cannot be said to be necessary at all.\n\n25. In Kasturi (supra) it was further explained that in a suit for Specific\nPerformance in respect of contracted party, the Court has to first decide the\nlis about enforceability of the Contract entered into between the parties to\nthe suit and not the question as to who is in possession of the contracted\nproperty. If a third person asserting his independent right and possession in\nregard to the contracted property is added in the suit then this process may\ncontinue without a final decision of the suit.\n\n26. In the case of Kasturi (Supra), it was found that the proposed\nrespondents had not purchased the contracted property from the vendor after\nthe Contract was entered into. It was observed that the proposed respondents\ndid not seek their addition in the suit on the strength of the contract in\nrespect of which the suit for specific performance of the contract for sale had\nbeen filed. Admittedly, they based their claim on the independent title and\npossession of the contracted property. In such circumstances, it was held that\nthe proposed respondents would not be entitled to be impleaded as a party in\nsuch a suit. They were held to be not a necessary party as they would not\naffect the Contract entered into between the appellant and the other\nrespondents.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 10 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\n27. Sub Rule 2 of\nOrder I Rule 10 CPC\nuses the expression \"all the\nquestions involved in the suit\", from which it is abundantly clear that the\nlegislature intended that the controversies raised between the parties to the\nlitigation alone must be gone into that is to say the controversies with regard\nto the right which is set up and the relief claimed on one side and denied on\nthe other side and not the controversies which may arise between the parties\nto the suit and the third party. This would only lead to complicated\nlitigations by going into the trial to decide issues which are totally outside\nthe scope of the suit, the decree of Specific Performance for contact of sale\nwould not affect the rights of the third parties claiming any independent title.\n\n28. In Amol vs. Rasheed Tuck and Sons Ltd. 1956 (1) All Eng.R 273 it\nwas held that a person is legally interested in the answers to controversy\nonly if he can satisfy the Court that it may lead to the result which will affect\nhim legally.\n\n29. Similar view was taken by the Supreme Court in\nVijay Pratap Vs.\nSambhu Saran Sinha\n4 (1996) 10 SCC 53. It may thus be concluded that a\nthird party or a stranger to a contract cannot be added so as to convert a suit\nof one character into a suit for another character. The collateral matters\ncannot be included and adjudicated for it would complicate the suit for\nspecific performance into that to title between the plaintiff and the proposed\nrespondents.\n\n30.\nIn\nVidur Impex and Traders Private Limited and Others vs. Tosh\nAppartments Private Limited and Others\n(2012) 8 SCC 384, in a suit for\nspecific performance of the Sale Agreement, this Court had granted\ninjunction restraining respondents no. 2 from alienating the suit property or\ncreating third party interest and in violation thereof, the defendant executed\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 11 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nsale Agreements in favour of third party. The third party sought their\nimpleadment under\nOrder I Rule 10 of CPC\n, their application was rejected\non the ground that the Agreement for sale had been executed by the\ndefendant in favour of third party in a clandestine manner and in violation of\ninjunction of the Court and no valid interest or title could have been\ntransferred to the third party. Further, suppression of material facts took\nthem out of the category of bona fide purchaser and thus their presence was\nheld to be neither necessary nor proper for deciding the suit for specific\nperformance.\n\n31. It was further held that the Court may order impleadment of a\npurchaser whose conduct is above board, and who makes an application for\nbeing joined as party within reasonable time of his acquiring knowledge\nabout the pending litigation. An applicant guilty of contumacious conduct or\nis beneficiary of a clandestine transaction or a transaction made in violation\nof the restraint order of the Court, is not entitled to be impleaded as a party.\n\n32.\nIn the case of\nAnil Kumar Singh vs. Shivnath Mishra Alias Gadasa\nGuru\n(1995) 3 SCC 147 it was held that since the applicant was not a party\nto the Agreement to Sale, it cannot be said that in his absence the dispute as\nto Specific Performance cannot be decided.\n\nIn\nVijay Pratap\n(supra) the\nApex Court held that to decide the right, title and interest in a suit property\nof a stranger to a Contract is beyond the scope of suit for Specific\nPerformance of the Contract and the same cannot be turned into a regular\ntitle suit\n\n33. From the above mentioned decisions the relevant consideration for\nimpleadment of a person as a party under\nOrder I Rule 10 of the CPC\nin a\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 12 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nsuit for Specific Performance for Agreement to Sell may be delineated as\nunder :\n\n(i) Whether in the absence of the applicant, no\ndecree can be passed;\n(ii) Whether the applicant has some right to claim a\nrelief against either party; and\n\n(iii) Whether it would be necessary in order to enable\nthe Court to effectively and completely adjudicate\nand settle all the questions involving in the suit\neven though no relief is claimed against such\napplicant.\n\n34. In the present case the applicant is a third party who has purchased the\nproperty in the auction held under the\nSARFAESI Act\nand his rights are\nneither flowing from the Agreement to Sell which is the subject matter of the\npresent suit nor do they flow from the defendant who was the owner of the\nsuit property. His rights, if any, have arisen from independent proceedings\nwhich are in no way connected with the present suit. In case the applicant is\nallowed to be made a party, the essential nature of the dispute would be\ncompletely displaced as an ancillary controversy in regard to the right of the\napplicant, who has purchased the property in an auction purchase, to\ncontinue in possession would ensue. In fact, as explained in the case of\nKasturi (supra) even if a suit for specific performance is decreed, the\nplaintiff would necessarily be required to undertake the execution\nproceedings if the possession is to be redeemed from the third party. The\nrights and the title of the third party can thus, be very well agitated by him in\nthe execution proceedings, since the decree passed in the suit shall not bind\nhim.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 13 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\n35. Likewise, in\nGurmit Singh Bhatia Vs. Kiran Kant Robinson and\nOthers\n(2020) 13 SCC 773, it was observed that merely in order to find out\nwho is in possession of the contracted property, a third party or a stranger to\nthe contract cannot be added in a suit for specific performance of the\ncontract because they are not necessary party as they have no semblance of\nlife to some relief against the party to the contract. It was further observed\nthat even if a decree for specific performance was made against the\ndefendants, the persons who are not parties in the Court would be at liberty\neither to obstruct the execution or to protect their possession and take legal\nrecourse as they were not a party to contract or Agreement to Sell.\n\n36. Furthermore, the plaintiff herein is dominus litis and cannot be forced\nto add a party against whom he does not want to file, unless it is compulsion\nof law, as held in\nGurmit Singh Bhatia Vs. Kiran Kant Robinson and Others\n\n(2020) 13 SCC 773. It was observed by the Apex Court that the plaintiff is a\ndominus litis over his litigation and the subsequent transferee of the suit\nproperty cannot be allowed against wishes of plaintiff who has filed the suit\nfor specific performance. If the plaintiff despite receiving the notice of claim\nof title and possession of other persons who are not party to the suit does not\nwant them to join in the pending suit, it is always done at the risk of the\nplaintiff as he cannot be forced to join a third party as a defendant in the said\nsuit.\n\n37. Here in the present case, the plaintiff who is claiming a decree for\nexecution of Sale Deed in his favour, had already applied before DRT where\nSARFAESI proceedings are pending wherein he was directed to pay the due\namount in order to forestall the sale of the property. However, the plaintiff\nherein has chosen not to protect the property or to pay the sale consideration\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 1033/2013 Page 14 of 15\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:09.01.2023\n\n15:30:19\n\n2023/DHC/000114\n\nin regard to the subject property as directed by DRT. He being the Dominus\nLitus, has also resisted the impleadment of the applicant.\n\n38. The applicant is shown to be neither necessary nor a proper party to\nthe suit having derived a title through independent auction and not through\nvendor and his presence is neither necessary nor proper for effective\nadjudication of the present suit. The application under\nOrder I Rule 10 of the\nCPC\nis hereby dismissed.\n\nCS(OS) 1033/2013\n\n39.
