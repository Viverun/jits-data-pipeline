Consequent upon the\namendment caused to the said rules on July 17, 1987, they\nfelt that the amendment had affected their further\npromotional chances. They therefore filed writ petitions\nbefore the High court challenging the vires of the\namendment dated 17.7.1987 contending that the creation of\nSuper time scale did not have the automatic effect of\ncreating highest post/posts to be filled by merit alone,\nand that the posts to which Super Time Scale was attracted\nremained `higher posts' in contrast to `highest posts'\navailable to the members of the Rajasthan Administrative\nService on the prescribed percentage of 50 per cent on merit\nand the remaining fifty per cent on seniority-cum-merit.\nTheir case was that section to the highest posts made under\nthe amended rule solely on the basis of the merit was bad in\nlaw. Before the High Court challenge to the vires of the\namendment was abandoned and the High Court considered the\nquestion (i) whether the Super time scale is/are the highest\npost/posts in the service and\n(ii) if it is so, whether the post/posts is/are to be\nfilled on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\nproportion of 50:50 or on merit alone in accordance with\nsub-rule (7) of /Rule 28-B of the Rules:\nThe High Court rejected the writ petitions opening that\nthe Super Time Scale post/posts was/were the highest\npost/posts in the service and those are required to be\nfilled on merit alone and not in the proportion of 50:50 on\nthe basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit. Hence these\nappeals by the appellants.\nDismissing the appeals this Court\nHELD: The terms `higher post' and `highest post'\noccurring in\nRules 28-B and 32 by all means are relative ones expected to\nbe created in singular or plural terms under rule 6\nwhereunder the strength of posts in each grade was\ndeterminable by the government from time to time. Sub-rule\n(7) even before the amendment of 17.7.1987 postulated a\nhighest post/post capable of being filled on the basis of\nmerit alone. [590 G-H]\nSuper Time Scale posts are the highest posts in the\nservice and selection for promotion and appointment on that\nbasis in the service has to be made on the basis of merit\nalone and not on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\nproportion of 50:50.[591 G]\nJ.K.

No.\n4033 of 1989.\n\nAruneshwar Gupta for the Respondents in both the\nappeals.\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPUNCHHI, J. The identification of the highest\npost/posts in the Rajasthan Administrative Service, capable\nof being filled by merit alone, under sub-rule (7) of 28-B\nof the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules, 1954\n(hereafter referred to as the `Rules'), is the search\nundertaken in these two connected appeals by special leave.\n\nThe respective appellants herein are Ajeet Singh\nSinghvi, who appeared in person, and Jagbir Singh who\nappeared through learned counsel. Both the appellants, at\nthe time they moved the Rajasthan High Court by means of\ntheir respective writ petitions, were high ranked officers\nin the Rajasthan Administrative Service but found their\nfurther chances to promotion obstacled on account of the\namendments caused in the said Rules with effect from July\n17, 1987. Broadly stated, on such amendments a Super Time\nscale was created which statedly was to remove stagnation in\nservice. The contention of\nthe appellants before the High Court was, and is, that the\ncreation of Super Time scale did not have the automatic\neffect of creating highest post/posts to be filled by merit\nalone, and that the posts which Super Time scale was\nattractive remained `higher posts' in contrast to `highest\npost' available to the members of the Rajasthan\nAdministrative Service on the prescribed percentage of 50\npercent on merit and the remaining fifty percent on\nseniority-cum-merit. The appellants challenged the vires of\nthe amendments dated 17-7-1987 for confining the selection\nto the highest posts made thereafter solely on the basis of\nmerit. Before the High Court, however, the question of vires\nof the amendments was given up and thus the High Court\ninvited its attention to the following two questions:\n\n(i) whether the Super Time scale is/are the highest\npost/posts in the service; and\n\n(ii) if it is so, whether that post/posts is/are to be\nfilled on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the proportion\nof 50:50 or on merit alone in accordance with sub-rule (7)\nof Rule 28-B of the Rules?\n\nThe High Court by a long and an elaborate judgment,\ndated 30.4.1988 traced the history of the Rules and the\namendments made to rules 28-B and 32 from time to time\nexpressed the opinion that Super Time scale post/posts\nwas/were the highest post/posts in the service and those\nrequired to be filled on merit alone and not in the\nproportion of 50:50 on the basis of merit and seniority-cum-\nmerit. It is to challenge that view that these matters are\nhere before us and we have had the opportunity of hearing\nthe party in person and learned counsel on both sides.\n\nWe begin by taking note that the word `highest' has not\nbeen given a definitive meaning in the Rules, and has to be\nunderstood and employed in the context in its ordinary\nmeaning and diction. Rule 6 prescribes the strength of the\nservice. It mandates that the strength of post in each grade\nof the service shall be such as may be determined by the\ngovernment from time to time. The proviso thereto leaves all\nthe possible flexibility with the government in the creation\nof any post of any kind and nature and for its abolition.\nThe latest notification in that regard, as was placed before\nus, is Notification No. F1(2) Karmik/ Ka-IV/79 dated January\n12, 1988 issued from the Department of Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms, Government of Rajasthan specifying\nthat as per Rule 6 of the Service Rules, the strength of\nposts\nin each grade of Rajasthan Administrative Service is\ndetermined therein. The said notification is found in a\ncompilation prepared by the Rajasthan Administrative Service\nAssociation, amended upto June, 19,1988. It demonstrates\nposts with their titles divided into seven categories. The\nfirst category is of Super Time Scale posts in the grade of\nRs. 3900-125-4400-150-5300. The second category is of\nselection scale post in the grade of 2978-75-3050-100-3650-\n125-4400-150-4700. Thereafter there are lesser pay-scale\ngiven in the third category of senior scale posts and in the\nfourth category, junior scale posts followed by special ex-\ncadre posts, training reserve and leave reserve posts. The\nSuper Time Scale posts are 25 in number and those posts are\nnamed and numbered as follows:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nS. NO. Name of the Post No. of Posts\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Director of Agriculture Marketing & Ex- 1\nOfficio Dy. Secy. to Govt.\n\n2. Director, Local Bodies 1\n\n3. Commissioner, Devasthan Deptt. 1\n\n4. Revenue Appellate Authority 10\n\n5. Principal, A.P.R.T.S., TONK 1\n\n6. Addl. Divisional Commissioners 6\n\n7. Addl. Director, HCM RIPA, Udaipur 1\n\n8. Addl. Commissioner, Co,. Cum-R. A. A., Bikaner1\n\n9. Addl. Commissioner, TAD 1\n\n10. Addl. Commissioner, Desert Dav. 1\n\n11. Addl. Commissioner, Transport 1\n\n-----\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow whether these posts are the highest posts in the\nRajasthan Administrative Service or are just higher posts,\nso as to identify the criteria applicable for promoting to\nthese posts their personnel.\n\n`Service' has been defined in Rule 4-L to mean the\nRajasthan Administrative Service. Sub-rule (7) of Rule 28-B\nprescribes that\nselection for promotion to the highest post/posts in the\nState Service shall always be made on the basis of merit\nalone. As said before, `highest posts' has nowhere been\ndefined. Prior to the amendment of July 17, 1987, sub-rule\n(7) read as follows:\n\n\"Selection for promotion to the highest post or highest\ncategory of posts in the State Service shall always be made\non the basis of merit alone.\"\n\nAccording to the appellants, prior to July 17, 1987 the\nhighest post was never identified and equally the highest\ncategory of posts were nowhere visible. The posts now\nfalling in the Super Time Scale, tabulation of which stands\nincorporated above, were always considered as higher posts\nand in terms of sub-rule (6) of rule 28-B,Selection for\npromotion to all other higher posts/higher category of posts\nin the State Service were required to be made on the basis\nof merit and seniority-cum-merit in the proportion of 50:50.\nThe proviso, however, to sub-rule (6) provided that if the\nCommittee (appointed under Rule 28) was satisfied that\nsuitable persons are not available for selection by\npromotion strictly on the basis of merit in a particular\nyear, selection by promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit may be made in the same manner as specified in these\nRules. The two appellants maintained that before the\nintroduction of the Super Time scale vide amendment dated\nJuly 17, 1987 there were only three categories, namely,\nordinary scale posts (alternatively known as junior scale),\nsenior scale posts and selection scale posts in the Service\nand these continued as such despite the amendments. Before\nthe High Court the exercise to identify the Super Time\nselection posts would have been easy had the government\nnotification dated 12th January,1988 been brought to its\nnotice. In any event after the issuance of the Government\nnotification dated 12th January, 1988, those very posts in\nthe Service have now been designated as junior scale, senior\nscale, selection scale and super time scale posts and for\nvalid administrative reason have Super Time Scale posts been\ntreated as highest posts even though they may have hitherto\nbelonged to the category of higher posts; the State Service\nremaining the same.\n\nRule 15 prescribes eligibility for consideration for\npromotion on the basis of qualifying service for promotion.\nRule 28 prescribes the procedure for promotion and\npostulates the Constitution of a Commitee. Rule 28-B, so far\nas is relevant for our purpose, is called out below:\n\n\"28-B REVISED CRITERIA, ELIGIBILITY AND\nPROCEDURE FOR PROMOTION TO JUNIOR, SENIOR AND OTHER\nPOSTS ENCADRED IN THE SERVICE-\n\n(i) As soon as the appointing authority\ndetermines the number of vacancies (under rule 9 of\nthese Rules) and decides that a certain number of\nposts are required to be filled in by promotion, it\nshall, subject to provisions of sub-rule (9),\nprepare a correct and complete list of senior-most\npersons who are eligible and qualified under these\nRules for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit or on the basis of merit to the class of\nposts concerned.\n\n(2) For appointment to the Service by\npromotion, the eligible persons included in the\nlist mentioned in rule 28 shall be considered.\n\n(3) xxxxxxxxxxx\n(4) Selection for promotion in the reguler\nline of promotion from the post/posts not included\nin Service to the lowest post or category of post\nin the Service shall be made strictly on the basis\nof merit and on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in\nthe proportion of 50:50.\n\nPROVIDED that if the Committee is satisfied\nthat suitable persons are not available for\nselection by promotion strictly on the basis of\nmerit in a particular year, selection by promotion\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit may be made in\nthe manner as specified in these Rules.\n\n(5) Subject to the provisions of sub-rule\n(7),selection for promotion from the lowest post or\ncategory of post in the State Service to the next\nhigher post or category of post in the State\nService and for all posts in the Subordinate\nServices and in the Ministerial Services shall be\nmade strictly on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\nfrom amongst the persons who have passed the\nqualifying examination, if any, prescribed under\nthese Rules, and have put in at least five years\nservice, unless a different period is prescribed\nelsewhere in these Rules, on the first day of the\nmonth of April of the year of selection on the post\nor category of post from which selection is made:\nPROVIDED that in the event of non-availability\nof the persons with the requisite period of Service\nof five years, the Committee may consider the\npersons having less than the prescribed period of\nService, if they fulfill the qualifications and\nother conditions for promotion prescribed elsewhere\nin these Rules, and are found otherwise suitable\nfor promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\n(6) Selection for promotion to all other\nhigher posts or higher categories of posts in the\nStates Service shall be made on the basis of merit\nand on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\nproportion of 50:50.\n\nPROVIDED that if the Committee is satisfied\nthat suitable persons are not available for\nselection by promotion strictly on the basis of\nmerit in a particular year, selection by promotion\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit may be made in\nthe same manner as specified in these Rules.\n\nEXPLANATION: If in a Service, in any category\nof post, number of posts available for promotion is\nan odd number then for purpose of determining the\nvacancies for selection by promotion on the basis\nof seniority-cum-merit and merit in the proportion\nof 50:50, the following cyclic order shall be\nfollowed:\n\nThe first vacancy by seniority-cum-merit; The\nsubsequent vacancy by merit; The cycle to be\nrepeated.\n\n(7) Selection for promotion to the highest\npost/posts in the State Service shall always be\nmade on the basis of merit alone:\n\nPROVIDED that-\n\n(a) in a Service or Groups or Sections\nthereunder, where there are only two scales e.g.\njunior scale or senior scale and there is only one\npromotion then promotion shall be made on the basis\nof seniority-cum-merit alone;\n\n(b) in a Service or Groups or Section\nthereunder, where there are three scales e.g.\njunior scale, and selection scale and there are two\npromotions then promotion shall be as under:\n(i) first promotion on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit.\n\n(ii) second promotion on the basis of\nseniority-cum-merit and merit in the proportion of\n50:50;\n\n(c) in Services or Groups or Sections\nthereunder, where there are more than two\npromotions then first promotion shall be made on\nthe basis or seniority-cum-merit alone and\npromotions to subsequent higher posts shall be made\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit and merit in\nthe proportion of 50:50 except to the highest post.\n\nPROVIDED further that if the Committee is\nsatisfied that suitable persons are not available\nfor selection by promotion to highest post/posts,\nstrictly on the basis of merit in a particular\nyear, selection by promotion to highest post/posts\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit may be made in\nthe same manner as specified in these rules.\n\n(8) The persons having been selected and\nappointed by promotion to a post or category of\npost on the basis of merit, shall be eligible for\npromotion to the next higher post or category of\npost, which is to be filled in by merit, only when\nthey have put in after regular selection, at least\nfive years' service, unless a higher period of\nService is prescribed elsewhere in these Rules, on\nthe first day of the month of April of the year of\nselection on the post or category of post from\nwhich selection is to be made:\n\nPROVIDED that the condition of five years'service\nshall not be applicable to a person, if any\nperson junior to him is eligible for consideration\nfor promotion on the basis of merit.\n\nPROVIDED further that in the event of non-\navailability of persons equal to the number of\nvacancies to be filled in, eligible for promotion\nin the category of post next lower from which\npromotion is made, the Committee may consider the\npersons having less than five years' service, if\nthey are found otherwise suitable for promotion on\nthe basis of merit alone.\nEXPLANATION: If any doubt arises about the\ncategoriesation of the post as the lowest, next\nhigher or highest post in the Service, the matter\nshall be referred to the Government in the\nDepartment of Personnel and Administrative Reforms\nwhose decision thereon shall be final.\n\n(9) The zone of consideration of persons\neligible for promotion shall be as under:\n\ni) no. of vacancies no. of eligible\npersons to be\nconsidered\n\na) for one vacancy Five eligible\npersons\n\nb) for two vacancies Eight eligible\npersons\n\nc) for three vacancies Ten eligible\npersons\n\nd) for four or more vacancies Three times the\nnumber of vacancies.\n\nii) Where, the number of eligible persons for\npromotion to higher post is less than the number\nspecified above, all the persons so eligible shall\nbe considered.\n\niii) Where,adequate number of candidates belonging\nto the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, as\nthe cases may be, are not available within the zone\nof consideration specified above, the zone of\nconsideration may be extended to five times the\nnumber of vacancies and the candidates belonging to\nthe Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, as\nthe case may be, (and not any other) coming within\nthe extended zone of consideration shall also be\nconsidered against the vacancies reserved for them.\n\niv) For the highest post in a State Service\n\na) if promotion is from one category of post,\neligible persons upto five in number shall be\nconsidered for promotion;\n\nb) if promotion is from different categories of the\npost in the same pay scale, eligible persons upto\ntwo in number from each category of posts in the\nsame pay scale shall be considered for promotion;\nc) if promotion is from different categories of\nposts carrying different pay scales, eligible\npersons in the higher paying scale shall be\nconsidered for promotion first and if no suitable\nperson is available for promotion on the basis of\nmerit in the higher pay scale then only the\neligible persons of other categories of posts in\nlower pay scales shall be considered for promotion\nand so on and so forth.

XXXXXX\n\n14. XXXXXX\n\n15. XXXXXX\n\n16. XXXXXX\nRule 32 after the amendment reads as follows:\n\n\"32. APPOINTMENT TO SENIOR POST-(1) [In\naccordance with vacancies determined according to\nthe provisions laid down in rule 9] appointment to\n[senior scale, selection scale and super-time\nscale] post shall be made by Government from\namongst the members of the Service in accordance\nwith the selection having been made on the basis of\nmerit and seniority-cum- merit on the\nrecommendations of a Committee which shall consist\nof following:\n\n1. Chairman, Rajasthan Public Service Commission\n...Chairman\n\n2. Chairman, Board of Revenue ...Member\n\n3. Secretary to Government in\nSuper-time scale of the\nIndian Administrative\nService, as may be nominated\nby the State Government ....Member\n\n4. Special Secretary to Govt.\n\nin the Department of Personnel ...Member\nSecretary\nPROVIDED that in case any Member or Member\nSecretary, as the case may be constituting the\nCommittee has not been appointed to the post\nconcerned the officer holding charge of the post\nfor the time being shall be the Member or Member-\nSecretary, as the case may be of the Committee.\n\n(2) Except as provided in this rule, the\nprocedure and the principles for selection by merit\nshall, in so far it may apply, be the same as\nprovided in rule 28-B. For selection by seniority-\ncum-merit, the Committee shall consider the cases\nof all the persons eligible for promotion by\nexamining their Confidential Rolls and Personal\nFiles and interviewing such of them as they may\ndeem necessary, and shall select a number of\ncandidates equal to the number of vacancies likely\nto be filled by promotion by seniority-cum-merit.\n\nPROVIDED (1) that appointment to the senior or\nselection grade post [or super-time scale] post may\nbe made by Government by appointing thereto\ntemporarily a person eligible for appointment by\nthe promotion to the Service under the provisions\nof these Rules.\n\n(2) No appointment made under [proviso (1)]\nabove shall be continued beyond a period of one\nyear without referring it to the Commission for\ntheir concurrence and shall be terminated\nimmediately on their refusal to concur\".\nArgument was sought to be built that in Rule 32, Super\nTime scale was introduced with effect from 17-7-1987\nwhereunder the Government was required to make an\nappointment on the basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit on\n50:50 basis in accordance with subrule 6 of rule 28-B in the\nabsence of identification of posts. The argument looses its\nthrust in entirety when viewed on the basis of sub-rule (2)\nwhereunder the procedure and principles for selection by\nmerit\nshall, in so far it may apply, is the same as provided in\nrule 28-B. which embodies sub-rule (7) as well. We have in\nthe context to apply the Rule of harmonious construction.\nIn\n\nThe J. K. Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. The\nState of Uttar Pradesh & Others\n; [1961] 3 SCR 185 this Court\napplied the rule of harmonious construction even to\nsubordinate legislation and laid down as follows:\n\n\"In applying the rule however we have to remember\nthat to harmonise is not to destroy. In the\ninterpretation of statutes the courts always\npresume that the legislature inserted every part\nthereof for a purpose and the legislative intention\nis that every part of the statute should have\neffect. These presumption will have to be made in\nthe case of rule making authority also.\"\n\nThen again in Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi etc. v.\nUnion of India & Others, [1983] 1 SCR 393 at pages 404-05 it\nwas observed as follows:\n\n\"The dominant purpose in construing a statute is to\nascertain the intention of the Parliament. One of\nthe well recognised canons of construction is that\nthe legislature speaks its mind by use of correct\nexpression and unless there is any ambiguity in the\nlanguage of the provision the Court should adopt\nliteral construction if it does not lead to an\nabsurdity. The first question to the posed is\nwhether there is any ambiguity in the language used\nin rule 40. If there is none, it would mean the\nlanguage used, speaks the mind of Parliament and\nthere is no need to look somewhere else discover\nthe intention or meaning. If the literal\nconstruction leads to an absurdity, external aids\nto construction can be resorted to. To ascertain\nthe literal meaning it is equally necessary first\nto ascertain the juxtaposition in which the rule is\nplaced, the purpose for which it is enacted and\nthe object which it is required to subserve and the\nauthority by which the rule is framed. This\nnecessitates examination of the broad features of\nthe Act.\"\n\nOn the application of above principles, it is\nnoticeable that the terms `higher post' and `highest post'\noccuring in Rules 28-B and 32 by all means are relative ones\nexpected to be created in singular or plural terms under\nRule 6 whereunder the strength of posts in each grade was\ndeterminable by the government from time to time. Sub-rule\n(7) even before the amendment of 17-7-1987 postulated a\nhighest post/posts capable of being filled on the basis of\nmerit alone. The fact\nthat they\nremained un-identified gives no basis to the plea that the\nState was incapacitated to identify at a later stage the\nhighest posts in the State Service required to be filled on\nthe basis of merit alone. It seems to us, on a close\nanalysis,and on the language employed in Rules 28-B and 32\nthat the highest post/posts conceptually were part of the\nRules but their effectuation and identification has surfaced\nonly by means of the amendments of July 17, 1987 and the\nnotification of January 12, 1988.\n\nAnother significant factor which leans towards such an\ninterpretation is the stance of the State which militates\nagainst the views canvassed on behalf of the appellants.\nThere is an inbuilt safety kept in the explanation added to\nsub-rule (8) of Rule 28-B which prescribes that if any doubt\narises, amongst others, about the categorisation of the\nposts as the highest posts in the Service, the matter shall\nbe referred to the government in the Department of Personnel\nand Administrative Reforms, whose decision there on shall be\nfinal. The appellants could easily have raked up and got\nreferred the matter to the government to have a decision\nthereon. The view of the government in maintaining that the\nSuper Time scale posts are highest posts is not only a bare\nand literal interpretation given by it to the Rules but also\nis reflective of its policy in this regard and no decision\nneeds to be given by the Court in normal circumstances to\namend or alter such policy. In such a realm even\ncontemporaneous exposition of a similar rule in an other set\nof rules cannot play their part to influence either the\nCourt or the Government to give the same interpretation or\nexposition to the rules requiring interpretation herein.\nBesides the government being the author of the rule, has\nkept to itself, as a matter of prudence; the right to remove\nany ambiguity about the identification of any post including\nthe highest post/posts. The stance of the government in this\nregard should have clinched the matter but since the same\nhad been put forth as a defence in the High Court, its view\nnonetheless are entitled to great weight and the burden of\nthe appellants to lift that weight, an uphill task by all\nmeans, has remained unfulfilled.\n\nTo sum up, our interpretation of the rules is in accord\nwith the interpretation of the rules as put by the High\nCourt holding that the Super Time scale posts are the\nhighest posts in the Service and selection for promotion and\nappointment on that basis in the Service has to be made on\nthe basis of merit alone and not on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit and merit in the proportion of 50:50. In the facts\nand circumstances of the case, however, we pass no order as\nto costs, while dismissing the appeals.\n\nY.L. Appeals dismissed",
