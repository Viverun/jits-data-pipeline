Appellant\n Versus\n\nSTATE NCT OF DELHI …. Respondent (s)\n\n JUDGMENT\n\nL. NAGESWARA RAO, J.\n\n Leave granted.\n\n1. On receipt of information on 27.10.2015 about a\n\nsuicide, PW-23 Sub-Inspector Bijender Dahia attached to\n\nPolice Station Aman Vihar rushed to Nithari village, Delhi.\n\nBy the time he reached, the body of the deceased i.e.\n\nMoniya had already been brought down from hanging\n\nposition. Ashwani (PW-12), the brother of the deceased was\n\nfound sitting besides the body of the deceased. The elder\n\nbrother of the Appellant was also present. A suicide note\n\nwas seized. PW-23 sent the body of the deceased for post-\n\nmortem. The statement of Ashwani was recorded by PW-23.\n\nInquest was conducted by the Executive Magistrate on the\n\n 1\n\n\fnext day. According to the post-mortem, the cause of death\n\nof Moniya was due to asphyxia as a result of ante mortem\n\nhanding.\n\n2. FIR was registered on the statement of Sunita (PW-11),\n\nthe mother of the deceased on 04.11.2015. A charge sheet\n\nwas filed on 05.02.2016. Later, charges were framed\n\nagainst the Appellant under \nSection 498A\n/\n304B\n of the\n\nIndian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter ‘ \nIPC\n’). 23 witnesses\n\nwere examined by the prosecution and several documents\n\nrelied upon to prove the guilt of the Appellant. The Trial\n\nCourt convicted the Appellant under \nSection 498A\n and \n306\n\nIPC. Sentence of three years’ simple imprisonment for the\n\noffence under \nSection 498A\n IPC and four years simple\n\nimprisonment for the offence under \nSection 306\n IPC was\n\nimposed on the Appellant. The appeal filed by the Appellant\n\nwas partly allowed by the High Court. The Appellant was\n\nacquitted for the offence under \nSection 306\n IPC. The\n\nconviction and sentence under \nSection 498A\n IPC was upheld\n\nby the High Court. Hence, this appeal.\n\n3. The deceased Moniya who was working as a teacher\n\nwas married to the Appellant on 02.05.2015. PW-11 Sunita\n\ndeposed that her daughter Moniya was being harassed by\n\nthe Appellant by demanding dowry. She testified in the\n\n 2\n\n\fCourt that on two occasions she gave Rs.40,000/- and\n\nRs.50,000/- to the deceased for handing over the same to\n\nthe Appellant to meet his demands of dowry. She stated\n\nthat the same was not informed either to her husband or\n\nher son and that she made the payments from her savings.\n\nShe also spoke about the demand for a bigger car. The\n\nAppellant was working in Nagercoil District, Tamil Nadu and\n\nhe was demanding for air fare to travel to the place of his\n\nwork. PW-11 further stated that she was informed by the\n\ndeceased that the Appellant had extra marital relations with\n\none Poonam and he informed the deceased that he\n\nintended to marry Poonam after leaving the deceased.\n\n4. The statement of PW-12 Ashwani was recorded on the\n\nday of the incident in which he did not mention about the\n\ndemand of dowry by the Appellant. He stated that the\n\ndeceased was depressed by the behavior of the Appellant.\n\nPW-10 Sukhbir, the father of the deceased, who reached the\n\nplace of incident also did not accuse the Appellant of any\n\ndemand of dowry. The suicide note which was seized from\n\nthe place of incident was proved on a comparison of the\n\nadmitted hand writing of the deceased from the school\n\nrecords with the suicide note. The suicide note also did not\n\ncontain any allegation of demand of dowry by the Appellant.\n\n 3\n\n\fThe suicide note which was reproduced in the judgment of\n\nthe Trial Court is as follows:\n\n “Relations have come heavy on dreams”\n Always lived with head ups and never did nay work\n by which I have to down my neck.\n\n I love a lot to my dad and brother. Today they have\n tears in their eyes\n I have broken from inside. I love a lot to my\n profession and education.\n\n I have done nothing that is why I cannot tolerate\n I want to live my life with Master Ji, He also\n manipulated. I do not have any complaint to\n anyone.\n\n5. After examining the evidence on record, the Trial Court\n\nheld that the demand of dowry was not proved. However,\n\nthe Trial Court was convinced that the prosecution proved\n\nthe extra marital relationship of the Appellant with Poonam.\n\nThe oral evidence relating to the Appellant informing the\n\ndeceased about such extra marital relations to the\n\ndeceased was accepted by the Trial Court. Having found\n\nthat the Appellant was guilty of mental cruelty, the Trial\n\nCourt convicted the Appellant under \nSection 498A\n, IPC.\n\nThough, there was no charge under \nSection 306\n IPC, relying\n\nupon the judgments of this Court, the Trial Court was of the\n\nopinion that the conviction under \nSection 306\n IPC was\n\n 4\n\n\fpermissible. The Trial Court found that the offence under\n\nSection 306\n IPC was made out against the Appellant and\n\nconvicted him.\n\n6. The main issue that was considered by the High Court\n\nin the appeal against the judgment of the Trial Court was\n\nthe correctness of the conviction under \nSection 306\n IPC\n\nwithout a charge being framed. The Appellant contended\n\nbefore the High Court that the charge that was framed\n\nagainst him was under \nSection 304B\n, IPC and that he could\n\nnot have been convicted under \nSection 306\n IPC. Placing\n\nreliance on the judgments of this Court, it was held that a\n\nconviction under \nSection 306\n IPC is permissible even\n\nwithout a charge being framed in a case where the accused\n\nis charged under \nSection 304 B \nIPC. The High Court held\n\nthat such conviction would not amount to failure of justice.\n\nHowever, the High Court found no convincing evidence to\n\nhold that the Appellant abetted the commission of suicide\n\nby the deceased. The Appellant was acquitted for the\n\noffence under \nSection 306\n IPC on the basis that there was\n\nno evidence to show that the deceased was subjected to\n\nmental or physical cruelty before her death. The High\n\nCourt affirmed the conviction of the Appellant under \nSection\n\n 5\n\n498A\n IPC by holding that there was sufficient evidence on\n\nrecord regarding the demand of dowry.\n\n7. The acquittal of the Appellant under \nSection 306\n IPC\n\nhas become final as no appeal is preferred by the State\n\nagainst the judgment of the High Court. Ms. Aishwarya\n\nBhati, learned Senior Counsel on instructions submitted that\n\na decision was taken not to file the appeal in view of the\n\nfact that the Appellant has already undergone the sentence\n\nunder \nSection 498A\n IPC. The learned counsel for the\n\nAppellant submitted that his conviction under \nSection 498A\n\nis impermissible after he was acquitted for the offence\n\nunder \nSection 306\n IPC. He relied upon the reasons given by\n\nthe Trial Court regarding the non availability of any evidence\n\npertaining to demand of dowry.\n\n8. Ms. Bhati, learned Senior Counsel for the State\n\nsubmitted that it is clear from the evidence of the family\n\nmembers of the deceased that there was demand of dowry\n\nby the Appellant and the High Court was justified in holding\n\nthat the Appellant is guilty of committing an offence under\n\nSection 498A\n.\n\n9. The conviction of the Appellant by the Trial Court\n\nunder \nSection 498A\n was not for demand of dowry. The\n\nconviction under \nSection 498A\n was on account of mental\n\n 6\n\n\fcruelty by the Appellant in having an extra marital relation\n\nand the threats held out by him to the deceased that he\n\nwould leave her and marry Poonam.\n\n10. The High Court acquitted the Appellant under \nSection\n\n306\n IPC by reaching a conclusion on the basis of evidence\n\nthat the charge of abetment of suicide on part of the\n\nAppellant was not proved. Without any discussion of the\n\nevidence pertaining to demand of dowry and without\n\ndealing with the findings recorded by the Trial Court\n\nregarding the demand of dowry, the High Court held that\n\nthe offence under \nSection 498A\n was made out.\n\n11. Cruelty is dealt with in the Explanation to \nSection 498A\n\nas follows:\n\n [498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman\n subjecting her to cruelty.—Whoever, being the\n husband or the relative of the husband of a woman,\n subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished\n with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\n three years and shall also be liable to fine.\n Explanation.—For the purpose of this section,\n “cruelty” means—\n\n (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is\n likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to\n cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health\n (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or\n\n (b) harassment of the woman where such\n harassment is with a view to coercing her or any\n\n 7\n\n\f person related to her to meet any unlawful demand\n for any property or valuable security or is on\n account of failure by her or any person related to\n her to meet such demand.]\n\n12. Conviction under \nSection 498A\n IPC is for subjecting a\n\nwoman to cruelty. Cruelty is explained as any wilful conduct\n\nwhich is likely to drive a woman to commit suicide or to\n\ncause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health.\n\nHarassment of a woman by unlawful demand of dowry also\n\npartakes the character of ‘Cruelty’. It is clear from a plain\n\nreading of \nSection 498A\n that conviction for an offence under\n\nSection 498A\n IPC can be for wilful conduct which is likely to\n\ndrive a woman to commit suicide OR for dowry demand.\n\nHaving held that there is no evidence of dowry demand, the\n\nTrial Court convicted the Appellant under \nSection 498A\n IPC\n\nfor his wilful conduct which drove the deceased to commit\n\nsuicide. The Appellant was also convicted under \nSection\n\n306\n IPC as the Trial Court found him to have abetted the\n\nsuicide by the deceased.\n\n13. \nSection 306\n IPC provides for punishment with\n\nimprisonment that may extend to ten years. There should\n\nbe clear mens rea to commit the offence for conviction\n\nunder \nSection 306\n IPC. It also requires an active act or\n\n 8\n\n\fdirect act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing\n\nno option and this act must have been intended to push the\n\ndeceased into such a position that he/she committed\n\nsuicide – See \nM. Mohan vs. State1\n.\n To attract the ingredients\n\nof abetment, the intention of the accused to aid or instigate\n\nor abet the deceased to commit suicide is necessary – See\n\nPallem Deniel Victoralions Victor Manter vs. State of Andhra\n\nPradesh2. Whereas, any wilful conduct which is likely to\n\ndrive the woman to commit suicide is sufficient for\n\nconviction under \nSection 498A\n IPC. In this case, the High\n\nCourt recorded a categorical finding that neither mental nor\n\nphysical cruelty on the part of the Appellant was proved.\n\nTherefore, the conviction under \nSection 498A\n IPC is not for\n\nwilful conduct that drove the deceased to commit suicide.\n\nThe High Court held that though there was no demand of\n\ndowry soon before the death, the prosecution proved dowry\n\ndemand by the Appellant immediately after the marriage.\n\n14. The High Court ought not to have convicted the\n\nAppellant under \nSection 498A\n for demand of dowry without\n\na detailed discussion of the evidence on record, especially\n\nwhen the Trial Court found that there is no material on\n\nrecord to show that there was any demand of dowry. The\n\n1 (2011) 3 SCC 626\n2 (1997) 1 Crimes 499 (AP)\n\n 9\n\n\fHigh Court did not refer to such findings of the Trial Court\n\nand record reasons for its disapproval.\n\n15. For the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the\n\nHigh Court is set aside. The appeal is allowed.\n\n …................................J\n [L.
