Marriage took place on 09.03.2015 as\n\nagainst date of incident dated 28.07.2020.\n\nReading of statement of father of the deceased does not reveal\n\nspecific allegation of dowry demand related cruelty inflicted soon before\n2 Mcrc.31755.2020\n\ndeath.\n\nConsidering the above and the age of both the petitioners and that\n\nthe material placed on record does not disclose the possibility of\n\npetitioners fleeing from justice, this Court is inclined to extend the\n\nbenefit of bail to the petitioners.\n\nAccordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the case,\n\nI deem fit appropriate to allow this application\nu/S. 438\nof Cr.P.C. in the\n\nfollowing terms.\n\nIt is hereby directed that in the event of arrest, the petitioners shall\n\nbe released on bail on each of them furnishing a personal bond in the\n\nsum of Rs. 25,000/- (Rs.Twenty Five Thousand only) with one solvent\n\nsurety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Arresting Authority.\n\nThis order will remain operative subject to compliance of the\n\nfollowing conditions :-\n\n1. The petitioners will comply with all the terms\nand conditions of the bond executed by them;\n\n2. The petitioners will cooperate in the\ninvestigation/trial, as the case may be;\n\n3. The petitioners will not indulge themselves in\nextending inducement, threat or promise to any person\nacquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade\nhim/her from disclosing such facts to the Court or to\nthe Police Officer, as the case may be;\n\n4. The petitioners shall not commit an offence\n\n3 Mcrc.31755.2020\n\nsimilar to the offence of which they are accused;\n\n5. The petitioners will not seek unnecessary\nadjournments during the trial;\n\n6. The petitioners will not leave India without\nprevious permission of the trial Court/Investigating\nOfficer, as the case may be;\n\n7. Both the petitioners jointly have gracefully\nvolunteered to donate Rs.5,000/-(Rs. Five Thousand\nOnly) in the account of the High Court Bar\nAssociation, Gwalior for the purpose of assistance and\nrehabilitation of those members of the Bar, who are\nfacing financial distress due to Lockdown and\nrestrictive functioning of the courts owing to ongoing\nCovid-19 pandemic. This Court has no manner of\ndoubt that the office bearers and the Senior members\nof the Bar shall ensure that the donation reaches the\nrightful and deserving claimants. Let the donation be\ndeposited within seven (7) working days from the date\nof furnishing bail.\n\n8. The petitioners as a Shiksha Swayamsevak shall\nrender physical and financial assistance to government\nprimary school situated nearest to residence of\npetitioner for ensuring hygiene and sanitation and for\nremoving deficiencies of infrastructural amenities in\nthe said school from the skill/resources of the\npetitioners.
