The\n\ngrievance of the petitioners is regarding non-\n\nupdation of their pension in consonance with the\n\nincrease in pay band arising out of bi-partite\n\nsettlements between the management of the Bank\n\nand the employees union from time to time. The\n\nwrit petitions are hence filed seeking the\n\nfollowing reliefs;\n\nWP(C)29890/2018\n\n\"(a) To issue a writ of mandamus or any\nother writ order or direction directing the\nrespondents to update the pension of petitioner\nas mandated by regulation 35(1) and 56 of the\nPension Regulations and to pay arrears of\npension with interest at the rate of 12 percent\nper annum yearly compounding as the amounts\ndetained has been earning similar interest to\nthe Pension Fund.\n\nb) To issue such other writ, order or\ndirection which this Hon'ble Court find fit and\nproper in the interest of justice and in the\ncircumstances of this case.\"\n\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-4-\n\nW.P.(C) No.41327/2018\n\n\"a.To issue a writ of mandamus or any other\nwrit or order directing the second respondent\nto update the pension of the petitioner in tune\nwith the revised pay scale arising out of the\nBipartite Settlements in compliance with\nregulation 35(1) and 56 and to pay the same to\nthe petitioner.\"\n\n2. The essential facts are as under;\n\nPrior to 1985, the employees of the second\n\nrespondent were covered by the Contributory\n\nProvident Fund Scheme under the\nEmployees\n\nProvident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act,\n. While so, based on a memorandum of\n\nsettlement arrived at between the managements of\n\n58 banks represented by the Indian Banks\n\nAssociation and workmen represented by the All\n\nIndia Bank Employees Association, it was decided\n\nto introduce a pension scheme for the workmen in\n\nlieu of employers contribution to the provident\n\nfund. Accordingly, the first respondent\n\nformulated and notified the Union Bank of India\n\n(Employees) Pension Regulations, 1995 ('the\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-5-\n\nRegulations') and constituted a pension fund\n\ncalled 'the Union Bank of India (Employees)\n\nPension Fund' under an irrevocable trust. The\n\npetitioners opted for pension under the\n\nRegulations and authorised the bank to transfer\n\nthe entire contribution with interest thereon\n\nto the newly created pension fund. Transfer was\n\neffected accordingly and from then onwards,\n\ncontributions to the employees provident fund,\n\nwhich was part of the petitioners' wages, was\n\npaid to the pension fund. The petitioners rely\n\non Regulation 35(1), as amended on 18.05.2002, to\n\ncontend that their basic pension is bound to be\n\nupdated in consonance with the increase in the\n\npay band. Reliance is also placed on Regulation\n\n56 which provides that, in case of doubt as\n\nregards application of the Regulations,\n\ncorresponding provisions of the Central Civil\n\nService Rules, 1972 or Central Civil Services\n\n(Commutation of Pension) Rules, 1981, applicable\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-6-\n\nfor Central Government Employees, can be adverted\n\nto. The petitioners therefore contend that their\n\nbasic pension is liable to be revised in the same\n\nmanner as that of retired Central Government\n\nEmployees whenever pay band is revised.\n\n3. Adv. George Cherian, learned Senior\n\nCounsel appearing for the petitioners contended\n\nthat Pension Regulations is the outcome of a\n\nMemorandum of Settlement entered between the\n\nmanagements and employees unions on 29.10.1993.\n\nAs per the recital in the Memorandum of\n\nSettlement, the bank was to introduce a pension\n\nscheme for workmen employees in lieu of\n\nemployers' contribution to the provident fund.\n\nThe pension scheme is to be in tandem with the\n\nCentral Government/Reserve Bank of India pattern.\n\nThe rate of basic pension was decided to be 50%\n\nof the average pay as defined in the pension\n\nscheme, subject to a minimum of Rs.375 per\n\nmensem. Clause 12 of the Settlement contemplated\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-7-\n\nthe making of provisions prescribing qualifying\n\nservice, amounts of pension, payment of pension,\n\ncommutation of pension, family pension, updating\n\nand other general conditions on the same lines\n\nas is in force in the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nAttention is drawn to Ext.P9 in W.P.(C) No.29890\n\nof 2018, issued by the Government of India,\n\ndeclining the recommendation for updating the\n\npension of Reserve Bank employees on the premise\n\nthat any change in the manner of calculating\n\npension is likely to result in similar demands\n\nfrom employees of public sector banks and\n\nfinancial institutions, most of which are facing\n\nfinancial difficulties. It is pointed out that,\n\nin spite of its earlier stand that any change in\n\nthe mode of calculation of pension of the Reserve\n\nBank employees will result in a contagion effect,\n\nthe Government, by Ext.P10, approved the\n\nrecommendation for increase in the pension and DA\n\nof RBI employees. It is hence contended that the\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-8-\n\nbenefit of such increase ought to have been\n\nextended to the employees of Public Sector Banks\n\nlike the second respondent also.\n\n4. Referring to Regulation 35(1), it is\n\nsubmitted that the Regulation, as originally\n\nnotified, was to the effect that, 'in respect of\n\nemployees who retired between first day of\n\nJanuary 1986, but before 31st day of October\n\n1987, basic pension and additional pension will\n\nbe updated as per the formula given in Appendix-\n\nI'. The Regulation, as amended on 18.05.2002,\n\nreads as under;\n\n'Basic pension and additional\npension, wherever applicable, shall be\nupdated as per the formula given in\nAppendix-I'.\n\nThe words 'will be' in the original text having\n\nbeen replaced with 'shall be', by way of\n\namendment, it is unambiguous that basic pension\n\nis bound to be updated in accordance with the\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-9-\n\nincrease in pay bands. That apart, Regulation 56\n\nalso makes it abundantly clear that the pension\n\nscheme is in tandem with the Central Civil\n\nServices Pension Rules.\n\n5. Another forceful contention urged by the\n\nSenior Counsel is that, pension fund of the\n\nsecond respondent has grown manifold over a\n\nperiod of time and as on 31.03.2017, Rs.11,032.28\n\nCrores is available in the fund. Relying on\n\nRegulation 5(2)\n, it is contended that the pension\n\nfund can be utilised only for payment of pension\n\nor family pension in accordance with the\n\nRegulations. It is pointed out that the average\n\npayment made towards pension/family pension is a\n\nmeager 23.91% of the annual growth. Moreover, the\n\nemployees who joined service after 31.03.2010 are\n\ncovered under the PFRDA Scheme of pension of the\n\nfirst respondent. As such, the pension liability\n\nof the second respondent will get extinguished\n\nover a period of time. It is alleged that, the\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-10-\n\nsecond respondent is withholding the pension\n\nlegitimately due to retired employees like the\n\npetitioners, with the evil design of utilising it\n\nfor payment of dividend and other purposes.\n\nReference is made to the decisions of the Apex\n\nCourt to contend that pension is no longer a\n\nbounty to be disbursed according to the whims of\n\nthe employer and has acquired the status of\n\nproperty under\nArticle 300A\nof the Constitution\n\nof India.\n\n6. Learned Standing Counsel for the Bank\n\nargued that the contentions urged on behalf of\n\nthe petitioners have no legal backing and the\n\nonly question to be considered is whether pension\n\nis being disbursed in accordance with the\n\nstipulations in the Regulations. It is submitted\n\nthat Regulation 35(1) clearly states that the\n\nbasic pension shall be updated as per the formula\n\ngiven in Appendix I. The petitioners have no case\n\nthat the periodical updation of pension is not in\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-11-\n\naccordance with Appendix I. The contention that\n\nthe updation ought to be in accordance with the\n\nCentral Civil Service Pension Rules or at least\n\nin tandem with revision of pension of RBI\n\nemployees, is too far fetched to be accepted.\n\nFinally, it is submitted that the same issue was\n\nconsidered and rejected by the Punjab and Haryana\n\nHigh Court in\nM.C.Singla v Union of India\n[2012\n\nSCC OnLine P&H 7136].\n\n7. In the Memorandum of Settlement dated\n\n29.10.1993 between the managements of banks and\n\nthe employees association, the precursor to the\n\nRegulations, the understanding was to introduce a\n\npension scheme broadly on Central\n\nGovernment/Reserve Bank of India pattern. The\n\nPension Regulations does not contain any such\n\nprovision, except Regulation 56, which stipulates\n\nthat, in case of doubt in the matter of\n\napplication of the Regulations, regard can be had\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-12-\n\nto the corresponding provisions of Central Civil\n\nService Rules, 1972 or Central Civil Services\n\n(Commutation of Pension) Rules, 1981 applicable\n\nfor Central Government employees. The contention\n\nof the respondent Bank is that there is no scope\n\nfor doubt in the application of the Regulations,\n\nsince Regulation 35(1) is categoric to the effect\n\nthat basic pension and additional pension,\n\nwherever applicable, shall be updated as per the\n\nformulae given in Appendix-I. The further\n\ncontention is that even the petitioners have no\n\ncase that the basic pension is not being updated\n\nin accordance with the formulae in Appendix-I.\n\nTo buttress this argument, reliance is placed on\n\nthe decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court\n\nin\nM.C.Singla\n(supra).\n\n8. In my considered opinion the judgment in\n\nM.C.Singla was rendered by considering Regulation\n\n56 in isolation. In the instant case, the\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-13-\n\npetitioners contend that there cannot be any\n\nconsideration distinct from the purpose behind\n\nconstitution of the pension fund. I find the\n\nsubmission to be well founded.\nRegulation 5(2)\n\nmakes it abundantly clear that the sole purpose\n\nof the fund is payment of pension or family\n\npension to the employee or his family in\n\naccordance with the Regulations. Going by the\n\nundisputed figures, only 23.91% of the fund is\n\nbeing utilised for payment of pension and family\n\npension. Another crucial aspect is that the\n\nemployees who have after 2010 are covered by\n\nanother scheme. Therefore, the beneficiaries of\n\nthe Pension Regulations are a vanishing class.\n\nThis will definitely result in the trust being\n\nleft with a huge some of money after the death of\n\nthe last beneficiary.\n\nIt is also to be noted that the employer's\n\ncontribution towards pension is also an\n\nentitlement of the employee, earned by reason of\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-14-\n\nthe service rendered by him.\nIn this context, it\n\nis pertinent to take into account the position of\n\nlaw emanating from the judgments in\nD.S Nakara\n\nand others v. Union of India\n[(\n1983) 1 SCC 305]\n\nand Sudhir Chandra Sarkar v. Tata Iron and Steel\n\nCo. Ltd and others\n[(\n1984) 3 SCC 369] and State\n\nof Jharkhand v. Jitendra Kumar Srivastava and\n\nanother\n[(2013) 12 SCC 210].\n\n9.\nIn\nD.S.Nakara\n(supra), after detailed\n\nconsideration of this aspect, the Apex Court held\n\nas under;\n\n\"31. From the discussion three things\nemerge: (i) that pension is neither a bounty\nnor a matter of grace depending upon the\nsweet will of the employer and that it\ncreates a vested right subject to 1972 Rules\nwhich are statutory in character because they\nare enacted in exercise of powers conferred\nby the proviso to\nArticle 309\nand clause (5)\nof\nArticle 148\nof the Constitution; (ii) that\nthe pension is not an ex gratia payment but\nit is a payment for the past service\nrendered; and (iii) it is a social welfare\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-15-\n\nmeasure rendering socio-economic justice to\nthose who in the hey-day of their life\nceaselessly toiled for the employer on an\nassurance that in their old age they would\nnot be left in lurch. It must also be noticed\nthat the quantum of pension is a certain\npercentage correlated to the average\nemoluments drawn during last three years of\nservice reduced to 10 months under\nliberalised pension scheme. Its payment is\ndependent upon an additional condition of\nimpeccable behaviour even subsequent to\nretirement, that is, since the cessation of\nthe contract of service and that it can be\nreduced or withdrawn as a disciplinary\nmeasure.\n\n10.\nIn\nSudhir Chandra Sarkar\n(supra), it was\n\nreiterated that pension is a right, the payment\n\nof which does not depend upon the discretion of\n\nthe employer. The contextually relevant portion\n\nof the judgment is extracted hereunder;\n\n\"18. For centuries the courts swung in\nfavour of the view that pension is either a\nbounty or a gratuitous payment for loyal service\nrendered depending upon the sweet will or grace\nof the employer not claimable as a right and\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-16-\n\ntherefore, no right to pension can be enforced\nthrough court. This view held the field and a\nsuit to recover pension was held not\nmaintainable. With the modern notions of social\njustice and social security, concept of pension\nunderwent a radical change and it is now well-\nsettled that pension is a right and payment of\nit does not depend upon the discretion of the\nemployer, nor can it be denied at the sweet will\nor fancy of the employer.\nDeokinandan Prasad v.\nState of Bihar\n[(1971) 2 SCC 330 : AIR 1971 SC\n1409 : 1971 Supp SCR 634 : (\n1971) 1 LLJ 557] ,\nState of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n[(1976) 2 SCC 1 :\n\n1976 SCC (L&S) 172 : AIR 1976 SC 667 : (\n1976) 3\nSCR 360] and D.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n\n[(1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145 : (1983)\n2 SCR 165 : (1983) UPSC 263 : (1983) 1 LLJ\n104] . If pension which is the retiral benefit\nas a measure of social security can be recovered\nthrough civil suit, we see no justification in\ntreating gratuity on a different footing.\n\nPension and gratuity in the matter of retiral\nbenefits and for recovering the same must be put\non par.\"\n\n11. It is pertinent to note that in\nState of\n\nJharkhand and others v. Jitendra Kumar Srivastava\n\nand another\n[(2013) 12 SCC 210], the Apex Court\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-17-\n\ndeclared the right to receive pension as akin to\n\na right in property. The contextually relevant\n\nportion of that judgment reads as under;\n\n\"The fact remains that there is an\nimprimatur to the legal principle that the\nright to receive pension is recognised as a\nright in \"property\".\nArticle 300-A\nof the\nConstitution of India reads as under:\n\n300-A.Persons not to be deprived of\nproperty save by authority of law.--No person\nshall be deprived of his property save by\nauthority of law.\n\nOnce we proceed on that premise, the\nanswer to the question posed by us in the\nbeginning of this judgment becomes too\nobvious. A person cannot be deprived of this\npension without the authority of law, which\nis the constitutional mandate enshrined in\n\nArticle 300-A\nof the Constitution. It\nfollows that the attempt of the appellant to\ntake away a part of pension or gratuity or\neven leave encashment without any statutory\nprovision and under the umbrage of\nadministrative instruction cannot be\ncountenanced.\"\n\nThe legal position being as above, I find\n\nsubstantial force in the contention that the\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-18-\n\naccumulated surplus ought to be utilised by\n\nrevising the pension periodically. In matters of\n\npension, there has to be a holistic approach and\n\nnot constricted interpretation of certain\n\nprovisions.\n\nIn view of the above findings, the writ\n\npetitions are disposed of permitting the\n\npetitioners to file a detailed representation\n\nhighlighting their grievances. Thereupon, the\n\nsecond respondent shall consider the\n\nrepresentation and pass appropriate orders\n\nthereon within two months. For effective\n\nconsideration of the representation, the\n\npetitioners shall make available copy of the writ\n\npetitions along with certified copy of the\n\njudgment.\n\nSd/-\n\nV.G.ARUN\nJUDGE\nScl/\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-19-\n\nAPPENDIX OF WP(C) 29890/2018\n\nPETITIONER EXHIBITS\nEXHIBIT P1 TRUE COPY APPENDIX-I TO PENSION\nREGULATIONS.\n\nEXHIBIT P2 THE DETAILS OF PENSION FUND OF THE\nSECOND RESPONDENT FOR LAST SEVEN YEARS\nFROM 2010-11 TO 2016-17 PREPARED IN A\nTABULAR FORM\nEXHIBIT P3 THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n01.07.2015 OF THE HONOURABLE SUPREME\nCOURT IN CIVIL APPEAL NO.1123/15.\nEXHIBIT P4 THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n13.02.2018 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO.5525/12.\nEXHIBIT P5 TRUE COPY OF THE REPRESENTATION DATED\n16.6.2018 MADE BY THE PETITIONER TO\nTHE SECOND RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P6 TRUE COPY OF THE STAFF CIRCULAR\nNO.4904 DATED 08.10.2002 (WHICH HAS\nDISAPPEARED FROM THE WEBSITE OF THE\nBANK) SHOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF\nTHE AMENDMENT AS 1ST SEPTEMBER, 2000.\nEXHIBIT P7 TRUE COPY OF THE EXTRACT OF REGULATION\n28 SOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE AS 1ST\nNOVEMBER, 2000 AND THE EXTRACT OF\nREGULATION 29 ON \"PENSION ON VOLUNTARY\nRETIREMENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P8 TRUE COPY OF THE EXCERPTS OF THE\nNOTIFICATION DATED 06.11.2017 IN THE\nGAZETTE OF INDIA CONTAINING THE FALSE\nAVERMENT OF THE BANK.\n\nEXHIBIT P9 TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER F\nNO.11/5/2001-IR DATED 26.02.2018 OF\nTHE FIRST RESPONDENT TO RESERVE BANK\nOF INDIA\nEXHIBIT P10 TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER F\nNO.11/5/2001-IR DATED 05.03.2019 OF\nTHE FIRST RESPONDENT TO RESERVE BANK\nOF INDIA\nW.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018\n\n-20-\n\nAPPENDIX OF WP(C) 41327/2018\n\nPETITIONER EXHIBITS\nEXHIBIT P1 THE TRUE COPY APPENDIX-I TO PENSION\nREGULATIONS.\n\nEXHIBIT P2 THE DETAILS OF PENSION FUND OF THE\nSECOND RESPONDENT FOR THE PERIOD FROM\n2010-11 TO 2016-17\nEXHIBIT P3 THE TRUE COPY OF THE UNSTARRED\nQUESTION NO. 2444 IN THE RAJYA SABHA\nAND THE ANSWER TO IT BY MOS, FINANCE.\nEXHIBIT P4 THE TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER DATED\n15/09/2018 OF THE PETITIONER TO THE\nSECOND RESPONDENT.",
