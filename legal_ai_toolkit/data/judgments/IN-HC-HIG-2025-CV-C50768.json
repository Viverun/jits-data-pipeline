This petition has been filed by the petitioners, challenging the\nOrder dated 17.12.2024 passed by the learned Central Administrative\nTribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as, the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 1 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\n„Tribunal‟) in O.A. No. 2835/2024, titled\nSameer Dnyandev\nWankhede vs. Union of India and Ors.\n, allowing the said OA filed by\nthe respondent herein with following directions:\n\n\"8. In light of the above, we allow this OA\nwith following directions:\n\n(a) Respondent nos. 1 to 3 are directed to\nopen the sealed cover pertaining to\napplicant's promotion and in the event his\nname is recommended by UPSC, he shall be\ngranted promotion to the post of Additional\nCommissioner w.e.f. 01 .01.2021.\n\n(b) Respondent nos. 1 to 3 are further\ndirected to place applicant's name at\nappropriate position in the final seniority\nlist dated 28.03.2024 of Joint\nCommissioners of Customs and Indirect\nTaxes.\n\nThe aforesaid directions shall be complied\nwithin a period of four weeks from the date of\nreceipt of copy of this order.\"\n\n2. The respondent had filed the above OA, contending therein that\nthe Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) held on 18.03.2024,\nwhich had been constituted for considering the case of the eligible ad-\nhoc officers for regular promotion to the post of Joint Commissioner,\nhad kept the case of the respondent in a sealed cover contrary to the\nJudgment of the Supreme Court in\nUnion of India & Ors. v.\nK.V.Jankiraman & Ors.\n, (1991) 4 SCC 109. The learned Tribunal, by\nthe Impugned Order, has accepted the said challenge of the\nrespondent, and has passed the above quoted directions.\n\nSubmissions of the learned counsel for the petitioners:\n\n3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the learned\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 2 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\nTribunal has failed to appreciate that in the present case, an FIR has\nbeen registered by the CBI against the respondent on 11.05.2023. An\nECIR bearing No.36/2023 has also been registered by the\nEnforcement Directorate (ED) against the respondent under the\nprovisions of the\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002\n(in\nshort, „PMLA‟). He submits that a Draft Charge-sheet for invocation\nof major penalty was issued on 27.09.2022 and another one, on\n27.12.2022. He submits that there was also a complaint received\nagainst the respondent that the respondent had submitted a forged\nCaste Certificate for obtaining employment. The same had also been\nreferred to the CBI for investigation. He submits that a complaint\ndated 28.07.2023 was also received from the Departmental Legal\nAdvisor, that the respondent had sought confidential information in\nrelation to the pending investigation, and same is also being\ninvestigated further by the department.\n\n4. He submits that in view of the above facts, the exception carved\nout by the Supreme Court in the\nJudgment of K.V.Jankiraman\n\n(supra), while dealing with Civil Appeal No.51-55/1990, was squarely\napplicable.\n\nHe also placed reliance on the Judgments of the Supreme\nCourt in\nUnion of India v. Kewal Kumar\n, (\n1993) 3 SCC 204, and\nState of M.P. & Anr. v. Syed Naseem Zahir & Ors.\n, 1993 Supp (2)\nSCC 225, to submit that as the FIR has been registered by the CBI on\nserious allegations, the decision of the DPC to resort to the sealed\ncover procedure was justified.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 3 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\nSubmissions of the learned senior counsels for the respondent:\n\n5. On the other hand, the learned senior counsels appearing for the\nrespondent, on advance notice of this petition, submit that three\nlimited circumstances in which the sealed cover procedure can be\nfollowed, as\nlaid down by\n\nK.V.Jankiraman\n(supra) and adopted by\nthe Government of India vide its Office Memorandums dated\n14.09.1992 and 25.10.2004, were not made out in the present case,\ninasmuch as there was neither a charge-sheet, or a disciplinary\nproceeding pending, nor a criminal case registered against the\nrespondent.\n\nThey place reliance on the Judgments of this Court in\n\nA.V. Prem Nath v. Union of India & Ors.\n, 2023 SCC OnLine Del\n3215;\nSanjay Yadav v. Union of India & Anr.\n, 2025 SCC OnLine Del\n2553; and Neeraj Kumar pandey v. Union of India & Ors. 2025 SCC\nOnLine Del 604, to submit that the Impugned Order passed by the\nlearned Tribunal is in accordance with the law as declared by these\njudgments.\n\n6. Further, drawing the attention of this Court to the reply filed by\nthe petitioners before the learned Tribunal, they submit that it was the\nown case of the petitioners, that pursuant to the Order dated\n12.03.2024 of this Court in WP(C) 3404/2024, titled\nSameer\nDnyandev Wankhede v. Union of India & Ors.\n, it had apprised the\nCVC vide letter dated 26.07.2024, that the issuance of charge memo to\nthe respondent, in pursuance of the first stage advise given by the\nCVC, cannot be carried out as of now and shall be kept in abeyance.\nThey submit that even the further course of action that had been\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 4 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\nmentioned by the petitioners in its reply before the learned Tribunal,\ndoes not fit into the limited parameter wherein the sealed cover\nprocedure can be followed.\n\n7. As far as the FIR registered by the CBI is concerned, placing\nreliance on the Order dated 08.07.2025 passed by the High Court of\nBombay in a Criminal Writ Petition No.1910/2023, titled\nSameer\nDnyandev Wankhede v. Union of India & Ors.\n, they submit that\ntherein, the CBI had sought three months further time to complete the\ninvestigation. Therefore, the said FIR is still at the stage of\ninvestigation and the stage of filing of the charge-sheet is far away,\nagain not resulting in the limited circumstances in which the sealed\ncover procedure can be adopted.\n\nAnalysis and findings:\n\n8. We have considered the submissions made by the learned\ncounsels for the parties.\n\n9. From the above narration of facts, it would be evident that as on\ntoday, there is no Departmental Proceedings pending against the\nrespondent wherein any charge-sheet had been issued against him. In\nfact, the petitioners in its reply-affidavit filed before the learned\nTribunal, has admitted as under:\n\n\"It may be submitted herein that attention is\ninvited to Hon'ble High Court of Delhi Order\ndated 12.03.2024 in W.P (C) No. 3404/2024\nfiled by the applicant wherein it has been held:\n\n\"4. In the light of the aforesaid, the writ\npetition along with all accompanying\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 5 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\napplications is disposed of as not pressed\nby clarifying that the evidence recorded in\nthe SET will not be relied upon in the\ndepartmental enquiry which may be\nheld against the petitioner as per law.\"\n\nSubsequently, the applicant forwarded copy of\nanother Order dated 22.03.2024 of the\nHon'ble CAT, New Delhi in O.A. No.\n1033/2024, whereby the Honble CAT disposed\noff this OA strictly in terms of the direction of\nthe Hon'ble High Court's aforesaid Order\ndated 12.03.2024 by directing that the\nevidences recorded during the course of the\npreliminary inquiry, conducted by the SET,\nwill not be relied upon in any further\ndepartmental inquiry/ disciplinary\nproceedings, if they were to be held in\naccordance with the rules governing\ndisciplinary proceedings.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid order of Hon'ble High\nCourt of New Delhi and Hon'ble CAT (PB),\nNew Delhi, it has been apprised to CVC vide\nletter dated 27.06.2024 that the issuance of\nCharge Memos to the applicant, in pursuance\nof the First Stage Advices given by CVC, may\nnot be carried out as of now in the light of the\naforesaid Order dated 12.03.2024 of the\nHon'ble High Court of Delhi.\n\nThe CVC vide OM dated 07.08.2024 has noted\nthe above position as intimated by CBIC.\n\nAccordingly, after taking approval of the\ncompetent authorities following agencies were\nrequested to take appropriate action afresh:\n\ni. NCB vide letter dated 27.06.2024 was\nrequested to take needful action/ decision\nabout conducting fresh enquiry in relation to\nNCB case Cr. No. 94/2021 (Cordelia Cruise\nCase), in the light of the Order dated\n12.03.2024 of the Hon'ble High Court of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 6 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\nDelhi;\n\nii. DGoV, Zonal Unit, Mumbai vide letter\ndated 21.06.2024 was requested to conduct\nvigilance investigation on the alleged violation\nof CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964 by the applicant\nwith regard to alleged mis-declaration/\nconcealment of details in respect of his private\nvisits to foreign countries and expenses during\nhis Maldives travel and the same is underway;\n\niii. CBI vide letter F. No. V.584/05/2022/\n11820 dated 27.06.2024 was requested to\nconduct investigation in relation to allegations\npertaining to sale/ purchase of expensive\nwatches by the applicant in addition to two\ncomplaints forwarded by this office received\nfrom Sh.Nawab Mallick and Shri Ratnakar\nGedam against the applicant.\"\n\n10. The respondent has also neither been placed under suspension\nnor any charge-sheet in a criminal prosecution has been filed against\nhim.\n\n11. The three conditions for placing the case of the respondent in a\nsealed cover, as set out in the Office Memorandum dated 14.09.1992\nwhich has been issued in compliance with the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in\nK.V. Jankiraman\n(supra), are therefore not met.\n\n12. Though the learned counsel for the petitioners has vehemently\nsubmitted that there are grave allegations against the respondent for\nwhich an FIR and an ECIR have been registered, and CVC on earlier\noccasion has also advised initiation of disciplinary proceedings, the\nfact remains that neither a charge-sheet in the criminal cases has been\nfiled, nor disciplinary proceedings by issuance of a charge sheet have\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 7 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\nbeen initiated so far. This Court is not to examine the reasons for the\nsame. However, we may herein also note that the CBI itself took time\nto complete the investigation, as recorded in the Order dated\n08.07.2025 passed by the Bombay High Court and referred herein\nabove, and the petitioners itself advised the CVC not to proceed\nfurther with the Departmental Inquiry.\n\n13.\nIn\nK.V. Jankiraman\n(supra), the Supreme Court negated the\nplea of the Department that a sealed cover procedure can be allowed\nto be followed merely because the allegations against the employee\nare serious in nature and it may take time to collect necessary\nevidence to prepare and issue charge memo and charge-sheet. The\nSupreme Court observed that if the allegations are so serious and the\nAuthorities are so keen in investigating them, ordinarily, it should not\ntake time to collect the relevant evidence and finalize the charges;\nthere is also a power vested with the Authority to suspend the\nemployee under the relevant Rules, which itself will permit the\nAuthority to resort to the sealed cover procedure and in absence of any\nof the above, resorting to the sealed cover procedure will not be\npermissible. We quote from the judgment as under:\n\n\"16. On the first question, viz., as to when for\nthe purposes of the sealed cover procedure the\ndisciplinary/criminal proceedings can be said\nto have commenced, the Full Bench of the\nTribunal has held that it is only when a\ncharge-memo in a disciplinary proceedings or\na chargesheet in a criminal prosecution is\nissued to the employee that it can be said that\nthe departmental proceedings/criminal\nprosecution is initiated against the employee.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 8 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\nThe sealed cover procedure is to be resorted\nto only after the charge-memo/charge-sheet\nis issued. The pendency of preliminary\ninvestigation prior to that stage will not be\nsufficient to enable the authorities to adopt\nthe sealed cover procedure. We are in\nagreement with the Tribunal on this point.\nThe contention advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the appellant-authorities that\nwhen there are serious allegations and it\ntakes time to collect necessary evidence to\nprepare and issue charge-memo/charge-\nsheet, it would not be in the interest of the\npurity of administration to reward the\nemployee with a promotion, increment etc.\ndoes not impress us. The acceptance of this\ncontention would result in injustice to the\nemployees in many-cases. As has been the\nexperience so far, the preliminary\ninvestigations take an inordinately long time\nand particularly when they are initiated at the\ninstance of the interested persons, they are\nkept pending deliberately. Many times they\nnever result in the issue of any charge-\nmemo/chargesheet. If the allegations are\nserious and the authorities are keen in\ninvestigating them, ordinarily it should not\ntake much time to collect the relevant evidence\nand finalise the charges. What is further, if the\ncharges are that serious, the authorities have\nthe power to suspend the employee under the\nrelevant rules, and the suspension by itself\npermits a resort to the sealed cover procedure.\nThe authorities thus are not without a remedy.\nIt was then contended on behalf of the\nauthorities that conclusions nos. 1 and 4 of the\nFull Bench of the Tribunal are inconsistent\nwith each other. Those conclusions are as\nfollows:\n\n\"(1) consideration for promotion,\nselection grade, crossing the efficiency\nbar or higher scale of pay cannot be\nwithheld merely on the ground of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 9 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\npendency of a disciplinary or criminal\nproceedings against an official;\n(2)*****\n(3)*****\n(4) the sealed cover procedure can be\nresorted only after a charge memo is\nserved on the concerned official or the\ncharge sheet filed before the criminal\ncourt and not before.\"\n\n17. There is no doubt that there is a seeming\ncontradiction between the two conclusions.\nBut read harmoniously, and that is what the\nFull Bench has intended, the two conclusions\ncan be reconciled with each other. The\nconclusion no. 1 should be read to mean that\nthe promotion etc. cannot be withheld merely\nbecause some disciplinary/criminal\nproceedings are pending against the employee.\nTo deny the said benefit, they must be at the\nrelevant time pending at the stage when\ncharge-memo/charge-sheet has already been\nissued to the employee. Thus read, there is no\ninconsistency in the two conclusions.\"\n\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n14. As far as the reliance of the petitioners on the observations and\nfinding of the Supreme Court in\nK.V. Jankiraman\n(supra), as far as\nthe Civil Appeal No.51-55/1990 is concerned, it may only be noted\nthat the employees therein had admitted to their guilt and were\nsuspended, and had in fact even deposited the amount drawn by them\nby submitting alleged false Leave Travel Concessions claims using\nforged documents. Based thereon, though the Department had taken a\nlenient view and the criminal prosecution against the employees was\ndropped, however, it had been done without prejudice to the\nDepartmental Proceedings which were subsequently initiated, and the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 10 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\nformal charge-sheet was also issued to the employees. It was in those\npeculiar facts that the Supreme Court held that such employee will not\nbe entitled to claim the benefit of promotion.\n\n15. As noted hereinabove, in the present case, there is no admission\nof guilt on part of the respondent, and it is not the case of the\npetitioners that investigation has been completed by the CBI or the\nED, resulting in a charge-sheet being filed against the respondent. As\nfar as the Departmental Proceedings are concerned, the petitioners\nitself has advised CVC not to proceed further with the same.\n\n16. Equally, reliance placed by the petitioners on the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in\nSyed Naseem Zahir\n(supra) cannot also be\naccepted. In\nthe said judgment\n, the Supreme Court found that though\nthe DPC was not justified in keeping the recommendation pertaining\nto the respondent therein in a sealed cover, however, due to the\nsubsequent development that the Departmental Inquiry had been\ncompleted and the charges against the respondent therein had been\nfound to be proved, it would not be justified for directing the sealed\ncover to be opened without a decision on the Departmental\nProceedings, which was likely to come in \"matter of days\". In the\npresent case, as noted herein above, the Disciplinary Proceedings are\nyet to start against the respondent leave alone being concluded in\n\"matter of days\".\n\n17.\nIn\nKewal Kumar\n(supra), the Supreme Court was considering a\ncase where, based on an FIR registered against the respondent therein\nby the CBI, a decision to initiate Departmental Proceedings had been\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 11 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43\n\ntaken prior to the meeting of the DPC and, in fact, the charge sheet\nhad been issued almost immediately following the DPC. In such\npeculiar facts, the Supreme Court held that a direction to open the\nsealed cover was not justified. It needs only a reiteration that no such\nfact exists in the present case.\n\nConclusion:\n\n18. For the reasons stated hereinabove, we find no infirmity in the\nImpugned Order passed by the learned Tribunal.\n\n19. The petition is, accordingly, dismissed. Pending application is\nalso disposed of being infructuous.\n\n20. The directions given by the learned Tribunal in the Impugned\nOrder shall be complied with, within 4 weeks from the date of present\nJudgment.\n\nNAVIN CHAWLA, J\n\nMADHU JAIN, J\nAUGUST 28, 2025/Arya/VS\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed W.P.(C) 10271/2025 Page 12 of 12\n\nBy:REYMON VASHIST\n\nSigning Date:28.08.2025\n\n18:55:43",
