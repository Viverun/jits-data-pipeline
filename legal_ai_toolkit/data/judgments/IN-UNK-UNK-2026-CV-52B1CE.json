This criminal petition under section 482 of the BNSS is\nfiled by the petitioner/accused to grant anticipatory bail in\nconnection with Crime No.270 of 2023 of Indrapalem Police\nStation of Kakinada District for the offences punishable under\nSections 376(2)(n), 354(c), 420, 506, 306 read with 116 of the\n\nIPC\n.\n\n2. Heard arguments of Sri B.V.Rama Rao, the learned\ncounsel for petitioner and learned Assistant Public Prosecutor for\nrespondent/State.\n\n3. The following facts are required to be noticed:\n\n A lady aged 22 years lodged written information dated\n19.11.2023 upon which, a FIR.No.270 of 2023 was registered for\nthe offences under \nsections 417\n, \n420\n and \n306\n read with 116 of\nthe \nIPC\n. The allegations do show that since the year 2021, she\nwas learning tailoring work and during that phase, acquaintance\ndeveloped between her and the accused. The accused used to\nbefriend her and promised to marry her and this love continued\nfor about 3 years. It is alleged that the accused wanted to do\nbusiness in iron scrapping and required money and in that regard,\nhe obtained Rs.5 lakhs cash and 8 sovereigns of gold from the\nvictim lady. Sometime thereafter, when she demanded to marry\nher, he refused to marry her and she informed to his father and\n\n 2\n\nthat was not fruitful. On 19.11.2023 she intended to lodge a police\ncase but felt that her reputation may get damaged and she\nthought of committing suicide and then she swallowed her own\nsilver ring. That was noticed by her father and she was admitted\nin the hospital and she survived. Then she lodged the written\ninformation with police. Investigation commenced and 10\nwitnesses were examined. The accused was arrested on\n31.01.2024 and was produced before learned V Additional\nJudicial Magistrate of the First Class, Kakinada seeking his\nremand for 15 days to complete the investigation. The learned\nMagistrate entertained the prayer and considered the rival\nsubmissions and took the view that the material on record did not\nmake out a case for \nsection 306\n read with 116 \nIPC\n. What\nremained was the offences under \nsections 417\n and \n420\n IPC and\nthere was compliance of \nSection 41A\n CrPC notice. It was in such\ncircumstances, it directed the release of the accused on his\npersonal bond for Rs.10,000/- with a direction to comply with the\nconditions mentioned in \nSection 41A\n CrPC notice. Thereafter, he\nmade his appearance before the court and was directed to\nappear on receipt of summons and such order was made on\n19.03.2024. This is the first phase of the case.\n\n4. During the course of investigation, the investigating officer\nthought it fit to have the statement of the victim lady recorded\nunder \nsection 164\n CrPC by the learned Magistrate. Accordingly,\nnecessary applications were filed. On 23.03.2024, the learned\nJudicial Magistrate of the First Class - cum - VI Additional Civil\nJudge's (Junior Divison) Court, Kakinada recorded the victim's\n\n 3\n\nstatement under \nsection 164\n CrPC. Subsequently, the\ninvestigating officer felt that the facts that were gathered so far\nincluding the statement of the victim lady recorded by the learned\nMagistrate contained material that the accused under the promise\nof marriage had sexual intercourse on multiple occasions with the\nvictim lady and failed to marry and they do attract the offence of\nrape and therefore additional penal provisions were added and\nthey are \nsections 376(2)(n)\n, \n354-C\n, \n506\n IPC.\n\n5. Then, the prosecution filed a petition under \nsection 437(5)\n\nCrPC seeking cancellation of bail and that was registered as\nCrl.M.P.No.3140 of 2024. Notice was served on the accused. He\nput in his attendance and filed a counter opposing the prayer\nmade in the petition. After due hearing and enquiry, by an order\ndated 27.08.2024, the learned V Additional Judicial Magistrate of\nthe First Class, Kakinada allowed the prayer of the prosecution\nand considered the rulings of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nand passed the following order.\n\n \"On perusal of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court as above, it is clear that when further cognizable and\n non-bailable offences are added, the court can direct the\n accused to be taken into custody after cancellation of his\n bail. In the present case on hand, the prosecution has\n altered the section of law basing on the statement of the\n victim, and the \nsection 376 (2)(n)\n of IPC is triable by the\n Hon'ble Sessions Court. The accused has not surrendered\n or applied for bail for newly added offences. Therefore, in\n view of the above circumstances, this court is of the opinion\n that the accused has to be arrested for the offences under\n \nsection 376 (2) (n)\n, \n354 C \nand \n506\n of IPC and the Inspector\n of Police, Kakinada Rural Circle, is permitted to arrest the\n accused for the said offences.\n\n 4\n\n In the result, this petition is allowed, the Inspector of\n Police, Kakinada Rural Circle is permitted to arrest the\n accused for the offences under \nsections 376 (2) (n)\n and\n \n354\n C, 506 of \nIPC\n.\"\n\n6. It is thereafter, the accused has come up with this petition\nwith the prayer which reads as mentioned below\"\n\n \"This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to enlarge the\n petitioner/accused on bail in the event of his arrest in\n Cr.No.270 of 2023 of Indrapalem Police Station of\n Kakinada District, and to pass such other order or orders as\n this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the\n circumstances of the case.\"\n\n7. Learned counsel for petitioner urges that this has never\nbeen the case of the prosecution that this petitioner either\nthreatened the witnesses or tampered with the evidence or\ninterfered with the investigation. That there is collusion between\nthe victim lady and local political parties and that resulted in\naddition of penal provisions. The allegations do not indicate any\nprima facie case against the petitioner. The petitioner is\npermanent resident of Atchutapuratrayam Village and would\ncooperate with the police for all purposes of investigation and will\nalways be available for that purpose. That the contentions raised\nby the petitioner were not properly considered by the court below.\nIt is for these reasons, he seeks pre arrest bail.\n\n8. Learned APP representing the State stoutly objected\nstating that the petition is not maintainable either on facts or law\nand the reasoned order of the learned Magistrate was never\nchallenged by recourse of any appropriate remedy and without\n\n 5\n\ndoing so, the petitioner is not entitled for seeking bail in\nanticipation and requested the court to dismiss the petition.\n\n9. In the light of the facts narrated above and the rival\nsubmissions the following points fall for consideration:\n\n 1. In a criminal case where an accused has been arrested\n and bailed out for certain non bailable offences and\n was subsequently found to have been involved with\n more serious offences in the same case whether he is\n entitled to apply for anticipatory bail?\n\n 2. Whether anticipatory bail application can be\n maintained without assailing the order of the court\n directing the arrest of accused?\n\nPOINT Nos.1 and 2: -\n\n10. As could be noticed from the record, by the time the\npetitioner was arrested on 31.01.2024, there were no allegations\nof sexual atrocity and he was produced before the learned\nMagistrate for the offences under \nsections 417\n, \n420\n and \n306\n read\nwith 116 \nIPC\n. Learned Magistrate considered the material on\nrecord and duly released him on bail by obtaining a personal\nbond. Investigation continued and the victim lady disclosed how\nshe was ravished on multiple occasions under the guise of\npromise of marriage. Whether those allegations are true and\nbelievable or whether they are false allegations are matters for\ninvestigation and matters for trial. The fact remains now that the\n\n 6\n\ninvestigating officer found from the material on record that for the\nfacts offences under \nsections 376(2)(n)\n, \n354 C \nand \n506\n IPC do\nattract. What should happen under law in such circumstances\nwas dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in \nHamida\nV. Rashid1\n.\n \nThe principles laid down therein and other rulings\nwere elaborately considered by the Hon'ble supreme court of\nIndia in \nPradeep Ram V. State of Jharkhand2\n. Their Lordships\nstated that where after grant of bail to an accused, further\ncognizable and non bailable offences are added, the following\nprinciples apply.\n\n 1. The accused can surrender and apply for bail for newly\n added cognizable and non bailable offences. In the event of\n refusal of bail, the accused can certainly be arrested.\n\n 2. The investigating agency can seek order from the court\n under \nsection 437(5)\n or 439(2) of the \nCrPC\n for arrest of the\n accused and his custody.\n\n 3. The court, in exercise of power under \nsection 437(5)\n and\n \n439(2)\n of the CrPC, can direct for taking into custody, the\n accused who was already granted bail after cancellation of\n his bail. The court in exercise of power under \nsection\n 437(5)\n as well as 439(2) \nCrPC\n can direct the person who\n has already been granted bail to be arrested and commit\n him into custody on addition of non bailable offences which\n\n1\n\n (2008) 1 SCC 474\n\n2\n\n (2019) 17 SCC 356\n\n 7\n\n may not be necessary always with order of cancellation of\n earlier bail.\n\n 4. In a case where an accused has already been granted bail,\n the investigating authority on addition of an offense or\n offences may not proceed to arrest the accused, for\n arresting the accused on such addition of offence or\n offences, it needs to obtain order to arrest the accused\n from the court which had granted bail.\n\n11. In the present case, Crl.M.P.No.3140 of 2024 was filed by\nthe prosecution under \nsection 437(5)\n CrPC with the following\nprayer:\n\n \"Petitioner/police humbly prays the Hon'ble court\n may be pleased to cancel the self-bond/ bail which was\n executed by the respondent/accused and permit to arrest\n the accused for the purpose of remand of the accused for\n judicial custody since he is involved in offence of rape\n which is grave in nature, else great prejudice will be caused\n to the de facto complaint in this case.\n\n After due hearing on both sides by an order dated\n27.08.2024, the learned Magistrate stated that \nsection 376(2)(n)\n\nof IPC is triable exclusively by the Hon'ble Court of sessions and\nthat the accused despite adding the new penal provisions did not\nchoose to surrender and did not choose to apply for bail for the\nnewly added penal provisions. In view of those circumstances, it\ndirected the accused to be arrested for the offences under\n\nsections 376(2)(n)\n, \n354-C\n and \n506\n IPC. Thus, it is at the direction\nof the court, the prosecution intended to arrest the accused.\n\n 8\n\nThus, there is warrant/ justification for the police to arrest. The\nratio of the \nPradeep Ram\n's case permitted several alternatives\nand the accused did not pursue any of those alternatives. The\noffences alleged against him are very grave. In such\ncircumstances, pre-arrest bail cannot be granted.\n\n12. Seeing from the facts of the case it has to be stated that the\naccused is a person who was released on regular bail for some of\nthe penal provisions and he now seeks anticipatory bail for the\nnewly added penal provisions. It is difficult to comprehend that in\nthe same crime, one could avail a regular bail in part and\nanticipatory bail in part. At any rate taking a case as a case when\nonce the accused was arrested in the case, his right to seek pre\narrest bail ceases.\n\n13. The contents of the present petition and the submissions of\nlearned counsel for petitioner have not addressed any illegality in\nthe order of the learned Magistrate. Without challenging the order\nof the learned Magistrate by way of revision or other appropriate\npetition, the prayer of the petitioner for pre arrest bail is not\nmaintainable. Hence all the points are answered against the\npetitioner.\n\n14. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Respondent/ state is\ndirected to proceed further in accordance with the directions\ngiven by the learned V Additional Judicial Magistrate of the First\nClass, Kakinada in Crl.M.P.No.3140 of 2024 in Cr.No.270 of 2023\ndated 27.08.2024.\n\n ________________________\n Dr. V.R.K.KRUPA SAGAR, J\nDate:15.10.2024 Dvs\n\n 9\n\n THE HON'BLE JUSTICE Dr. V.R.K.KRUPA SAGAR\n\n CRIMINAL PETITION No.6628 of 2024\n\n Date: 15.10.2024\n\nDvs",
