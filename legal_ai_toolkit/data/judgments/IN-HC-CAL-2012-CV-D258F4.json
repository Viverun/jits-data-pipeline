  "text": "Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side)\n\nAbsorption Of Casual Workers vs Unknown on 19 June, 2012\n\nAuthor:\nPratap Kumar Ray\n\nBench:\nPratap Kumar Ray\n19.6.2012\nF.M.A. 722 of 2011\n\nMr. Sumitro Dasgupta\n... for the appellant\n\nMr. Debabrata Saha Roy\nMr. Indranath Mitra\n... for the State.\n\n-------------------\n\nPratap Kumar Ray,J.\n\nHeard the learned advocates appearing for the parties.\n\nAssailing the judgment and order dated 2nd February, 2011 passed by the\nlearned trial Judge in W.P. 23370 (W) of 2010, this appeal has been preferred.\nImpugned order reads such:\n\n\"By this writ petition, the petitioner has challenged the order dated 3rd\nSeptember, 2010.\n\nThe case of the petitioner is that he was appointed as Panchayat Karmee on 5th\nJuly, 1992 on casual basis in view of the Circular dated 8th October, 2003. Therefore, he\nis entitled to be regularized and for such purpose, a representation was made. As such\nrepresentation was not considered, a writ petition was filed and an order was passed for\nconsidering the petitioner's representation. Such representation has been considered\nand order passed on 3rd September, 2010. The said order dated 3rd September, 2010 is\nbad as it has failed to appreciate that in 1992 the petitioner was appointed as a Job\nAssistant and after the 2007 Rules, the petitioner has been working as Panchayat\nKarmee. Therefore, as a Panchayat Karmee, he is entitled to be regularized. The finding\nof the hearing authority is otherwise and therefore, is liable to be set aside.\n\nCounsel for the State respondent submits that no interference is called for with\nthe order dated 3rd September, 2010 as the findings of the hearing authority are in\naccordance with Rules of 1995 and 2007.\n\nHaving considered the submissions of the parties, there is no doubt that the\npetitioner was appointed on 5th July, 1992 although in paragraph-2 of the writ petition,\nit has been averred that the petitioner was appointed as Panchayat Karmee, the said\ncannot be accepted as the West Bengal Panchayat (Recruitment and Conditions of\nService of Gram Panchayat Karmee) Rules, 1995 was promulgated in 1995. Therefore,\nthe petitioner prior to 1995 could not have been appointed as a Gram Panchayat\nKarmee.\n\nFrom the order dated 3rd September, 2010, it appears that by resolution of\n1992, the petitioner was appointed as a Job Worker. Such post of Job Worker is\ncontinuing even today as will evident from the West Bengal Panchayat (Recruitment of\nGram Panchayat Employees) Rules, 2007. The Recruitment Rules of 2007 also dealt\nwith recruitment of Panchayat Karmee. As the petitioner was appointed as a Job Worker\nand not as a Panchayat Karmee the representation made in this respect has been rightly\nrejected and no interference is called for with the order dated 3rd September, 2010.\nAnother reason for not passing any order on this writ petition is that nowhere in the writ\npetition has it been averred that the post of Job Assistant has been abolished and in its\nplace, Panchayat Karmees are appointed.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid, no order is passed on this writ petition and the writ\npetition is dismissed.\n\nAs no affidavit-in-opposition has been filed, the allegation contained in the\npetition is not admitted.\n\nUrgent certified Photostat copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the\nparties subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.\"\n\nLearned trial Judge dismissed the writ application by assigning reason\nthat there was no scope for regularization as writ petitioner admittedly was not\nan appointee to the post of Panchayat Karmee, since the post was created\nfollowing the West Bengal Panchayat (Recruitment and Conditions of Service of\nGram Panchayat Karmee) Rules, 1995, long after casual appointment of the writ\npetitioner in the year 1992 by resolution of the Gram Panchayat in the post of\nJob Worker or other job. The circular letter dated 8th October, 2003 as relied\nupon by the writ petitioner for relief in the regularization of service was not\napplied by the learned trial Judge.\n\nIt is the grievance of the appellant before us that since by an unanimous\nresolution of Sandeskhali Gram Panchayat, the writ petitioner/appellant was\nappointed in the post to work as Job Worker or Karmee Sahayak temporarily on\npayment of nominal salary where he is continuing as casual appointee, the\nappellant in terms of the notification no. 3598/PN/O/I/3S-114/2003 dated 8th\nOctober, 2003, has accrued right for regularization of his service in a permanent\npost. The notification as relied upon reads such:\n\n\"Government of West Bengal\nDepartment of Panchayats & R.D.\nPanchayat Wing\nJessop Building\n63, Netaji Subhas Road, Kolkata-700001\n\nNo. 3398/PN/O/I/3S-114/2003 Dated: 08.10.2003\n\nNOTIFICATION\n\nWhereas Panchayat bodies that is Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samities and\nGram Panchayats have been allowed to absorb casual workers, in some cases, who have\nbeen engaged in perennial type of work for a continuous period of more than three years\nin the concerned Panchayat bodies and orders in this behalf were issued by this\nDepartment, from time to time, in accordance with the principles prescribed by the\nLabour Department of the State Government in their Memo No. 100-EMP dated\n13.03.1996 read with Memo No. 1700-EMP dated 03.08.1997 and Memo No. 1650-EMP\ndated 28.08.1980 in the matter of absorption of casual workers.\n\nAnd whereas Hon'ble High Court at Calcutta in\nW.P. No. 766 (W) of 2002\nSudhir Chandra Mahato vs. State of West Bengal\npassed an order dated 2.12.2002\ndirecting State Government to issue an appropriate well considered circular by way of\nnotification to regularize the irregular appointments, if any, given by the respective\nGram Panchayats, Panchayat Samities and Zilla Parishads in different occasions.\nIt has\nalso been directed that the due consideration will be made in respect of the best parts of\nthe existing circulars and the scheme will be formulated as far as practicable with the\nguidelines given in the paragraph 25 of the judgment reported in AIR 1992 SC 2130\n(supra).\n\nNow, therefore, in exercise of the power conferred by\nsection 212\nof the West\nBengal Panchayat Act, 1973 (West Bengal XLI of 1973), as subsequently amended, and\nin supersession of all earlier orders issued in this behalf, I am directed to say that the\nGovernor is pleased hereby to direct that for the purpose of regularizing the irregular\nappointments, if any, given by the respective Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samities and\nZilla Parishads, as the case may be, the concerned recruiting/appointing authority shall\nconsider the following guiding principles:\n\n(i) the following casual and such other categories like contingent, work-\n\ncharged, seasonal, etc. of eligible workers, only shall be considered who have been\nengaged in a perennial nature of work on the strength of a resolution in a meeting of the\nconcerned Panchayat bodies in favour of such engagement and has rendered services for\na continuous period of more than three years (for at least two hundred and forty days of\nwork in each such calendar year for three consecutive years) within the last five years\nbefore 13.03.1996 and has commenced his work at an age within the maximum age\nlimit prescribed for such recruitment. Such period of works shall be five years or more in\ncase of seasonal workers and they have been continuing as such till the date of their\nregularizations.\n\n(ii) Such workers must possess the requisite qualification prescribed for the\nposts in the respective recruitment rules. Requirement of minimum fifty percent marks\nin aggregate in the Madhyamik or equivalent examination is not, however, necessary for\nregularization of casual and such other categories of workers in a Group 'C' post in the\nconcerned Panchayat bodies.\n\n(iii) Such irregular appointments can only be regularized on availability of\nsuitable vacancies in the regular establishments of the concerned Panchayat bodies.\n\n(iv) at the time of engagement of casual and such other categories of workers\ntheir age should be within the age limit prescribed for the post in the respective\nrecruitment rules. Over age of such workers, if any, at the time of their regularization\nshall be condoned by the respective appointing authorities themselves.\n\n(v) wages of casual and such other categories of workers must have been paid\nout of the own fund of the concerned Panchayat bodies and not out of scheme\ncontingencies.\n\n(vi) the service records of casual and such other categories of workers must be\nsatisfactory.\n\n(vii) priority amongst the casual and each other categories of workers for\nregularization in the establishment shall be given only on the basis of the length of\nservices rendered by them.\n\n(viii) verification of attendents and medical fitness of casual and such other\ncategories of workers are required before regularization.\n\n(ix) regularization of casual and such other categories of workers does not run\ncounter to the prevailing reservation policy of the State Government. If, however, in case\nof necessity, the order in respect of de-reservation of the post shall be obtained from the\ncompetent authority in terms of section 6 of the West Bengal Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes (Reservation of Vacancies in Service and Posts) Act, 1973 read with\nguidelines for initiation of proposals for de-reservation as forwarded under Memo No.\n98(91)-BCW/MRD-156/99 dated 07.01.2000 of the Backward Classes Welfare\nDepartment of the State Government.\n\n(x) All vacancies, inter alia, in the post in the Panchayat bodies shall normally\nbe filled up by such candidates as may be sponsored by an employment exchange in\naccordance with the relevant recruitment rules. If in exigencies of administration and\nadhoc or temporary employment are made by the Panchayat bodies after 13.03.1996,\nefforts shall be given always to replace such an adhoc temporary employee by a regularly\nselected employee as early as possible. Employees appointed on adhoc or temporary\nbasis after 13.03.1996 who are otherwise eligible and have worked for at least three\nyears shall, however, be allowed to compete along with other candidates sponsored by\nan employment exchange in the selection tests to be held by the selection committee for\nregular selection or appointment to the post. If such an adhoc or temporary employee\ndoes not qualify himself in the selection test for the purpose, he must give way to the\nregular selected candidate. The concerned recruiting/appointing authority shall not\nwithhold or keep in abeyance of appointment of the regularly selected candidate for the\nsake of adhoc or temporary employee.\n\n(xi) an adhoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by another adhoc\nor temporary employee, such employee must be replaced only by a regularly selected\ncandidate. Prior to the replacement of Casual workers orders contained in this\nDepartment Notification No. 3597-EN dated 08.10.2003 shall, however, be kept in mind\nof the recruiting/appointing authority.\n\n(xii) if an when casual and such other categories of worker as regularized\nhe/she should be placed immediately below the last regularly appointed employees that\ncategory class or service as the case may be of the concerned establishments.\n\n(xiii) after due observance of all principles laid down hereinabove, the\nrecruitment/appointing authority of the concerned Panchayat bodies, shall forward its\nrecommendation to the respective Panchayat bodies for taking immediate resolution for\nconsideration and the effect of regularization, if any, of such worker shall take place\nfrom the date on which the resolution of the concerned Panchayat bodies has been\nadopted.\n\nBy order of the Governor,\nM. N. Ray\nSecretary to the Govt. of West Bengal\"\n\nThis appeal has been opposed by the State-respondents relying upon the\nWest Bengal (Gram Panchayat Administration) Rules, 1981 (hereinafter referred\nto as 'said Rules, 1981'). It is the contention of the State-respondents that under\nRule 36, Gram Panchayat was entitled to appoint any person only in a\nsanctioned post and there was no scope for appointment of any person in a post\nnot sanctioned and approved by the Director of Panchayats and Rural\nDevelopment. It is further contended that under sub-rule (5) proviso of said Rule\n36, which became effective by notification no. 3536/PN/O/I/3R-I/2000 dated\n30th August, 2001, there is no scope for regularization of appointment, which was\nmade illegally, on breach of recruitment rule. Rule 36 sub-rule (1) including its\nproviso and sub-rule (5) with its proviso reads such:\n\n\"36. Appointment of officers and employees by Gram Panchayat and\nconditions of service of such officers and employees.-(1) A Gram Panchayat may,\nwith the prior approval of the [Director of Panchayats and Rural Development,] create\nsuch posts of officers and employees as may be necessary for carrying out the work of\nthe Gram Panchayat, and may make appointments to such posts:\n\nProvided that no post shall be abolished or no revision of the scale of pay of\nshall be made by the Gram Panchayat without the prior approval of the Director of\nPanchayats and Rural Development:\n\nProvided further that if any Gram Panchayat or the Pradhan creates any post\nwithout prior approval of the Director of Panchayats and Rural Development, the Gram\nPanchayat or any other person appointed by the Gram Panchayat against such post,\nshall not make any claim for contribution of the State Government for payment of salary\nor wages or any part of it against that post and that on such creation of post by the\nGram Panchayat without prior approval of the Director of Panchayats and Rural\nDevelopment, the State Government may consider discontinuation of any contribution\nor grant towards establishment cost relating to the said Gram Panchayat.\n\n(2) ...................\n\n(5) Any appointment of an officer or employee under sub-rule (1) shall be made\nin accordance with the policy laid down by the State Government from time to time.\n\nProvided that if any Gram Panchayat or the Pradhan on behalf of the Gram\nPanchayat makes any appointment in violation of the policy or rules or orders for\nrecruitment in pursuance of that policy, such appointment shall be void ab initio and\nthe Gram Panchayat or the person so appointed by the Gram Panchayat in violation or\nthe policy, rules or orders, shall not have any claim for regularization of such\nappointment or for any fund for salary against such appointment.\"\n\nOn a bare reading of said provisions it appears that without any\nsanctioned post there was no scope for appointment of any candidate by the\nGram Panchayat. Gram Panchayat is a body corporate framed and constituted in\nterms of the statute and not a private body. As such, limitation of exercise of\nstatutory power in terms of its principle is squarely applicable. It is a settled legal\nproposition of law that a private body may act as per his wish all things as are\nnot prohibited by any statute but a statutory body always have to act within the\nframework and parameters of the statutes relating to its action identified and it\ncannot travel beyond that. Reliance is placed to the judgments passed in the\ncases\nManiruddin Bepari vs. The Chairman of the Municipal Commissioners,\nDacca\n, reported in 40\nCWN 17, K. Ramadas Shenoy vs. Chief Officers, Town\nMunicipal Council, Udipi\n, reported in (\n1974) 2 SCC 506, Bhavnagar University\nvs. Palitana Sugar Mill Private Limited\n, reported in (\n2003) 2 SCC 111,\nRamchandra Keshav Adke vs. Govind Joti Chavare\n, reported in (\n1975) 1 SCC\n559, J.N. Ganatra vs. Morvi Muncipality, Morvi\n, reported in (\n1996) 9 SCC 495,\nMeera Sahni vs. Lt. Governor of Delhi\n, reported in (\n2008) 9 SCC 177, Union of\nIndia vs. International Trading Company\n, reported in (2003) 5 SCC 437 and\nRamdeen Mayurya vs. State of UP, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 735.\n\nIn all those\ncases the principle as formulated and settled by the Court of Chancery Division\nin the case Taylor vs. Taylor, reported in (1875) 1 Ch. D. 426, which\nsubsequently followed by the Privy Council in the case\nNazir Ahmed vs. King\nEmperor\n, reported in 1936 Privy Council 253. In the book of Statutory\nInterpretation by Crawford, wherein at page 334, this principle has been\ndiscussed under the heading \"Express Mention and Implied Exclusion (Expressio\nUnius Est Exclusio Alterius\", which reads such:\n\n\"Express Mention and Implied Exclusion (Expressio Unius Est Exclusio\nAlterius.- ........................if a statute enumerates the things upon which it is to operate,\neverything else must necessarily, and by implication, be excluded from its operation and\neffect. ......................if the statute directs that certain acts shall be done in a specified\nmanner, or by certain person, their performance in any other manner than that\nspecified, or by any other person than one of those named, is impliedly prohibited.\"\n\nHence, a Gram Panchayat created under statute, namely,\nWest Bengal\nPanchayat Act, 1973\n(hereinafter referred to as 'said Act') had no\njurisdiction/power to take resolution on 5th July, 1992, appointing the writ\npetitioner in a post, which was not sanctioned and approved and not created\nfollowing the said Rules, 1981.\n\nHaving regard to the breach committed by different Panchayats,\nultimately, said Rules, 1981, got incorporation of a proviso under sub-rule (5) of\nRule 36 not only restraining such type of appointment but declaring that such\nappointments would be void ab initio and there would be no regularization of\nappointment or release of any fund for salary from Government exchequer. The\nsecond proviso under sub-rule (1) of Rule 36 also was incorporated by\nnotification dated 30th August, 2001 putting total embargo that if without prior\napproval of the Director of Panchayats and Rural Development any post is\ncreated and anybody is appointed thereto, he would not be entitled to claim\ncontribution of State Government for payment of salary and wages against that\npost.\n\nThe West Bengal Panchayat (Gram Panchayat Administration) Rules,\n1981 was framed in exercise of the power conferred by\nSection 224\nof the said\nAct. On reflection of the said Rules, 1981, particularly, proviso of sub-rule (5) of\nRule 36, a question involves whether notification dated 8th October, 2003 as\nrelied upon by the learned advocate for the appellant has any legal force. It\nappears that said notification was issued under\nSection 212\nof the said Act,\nwhich reads such:\n\n\"212. Directions by State Government.-In the discharge of their functions\nthe Gram Panchayat, the Panchayat Samiti and the Zilla Parishad shall be guided by\nsuch instructions or directions as may be given to them by the State Government from\ntime to time in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\"\n\nThe said Rules, 1981 stipulating the rules for appointment of any\nemployee and its restriction thereof, was promulgated in exercise of power\nconferred by\nSection 224\nof the said Act, which reads such:\n\n\"224. Power to make rules.-(1) The State Government may, after previous\npublication, make rules for carrying out the purposes of this Act.\n\n(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power,\nsuch rules may provide for all or any of the matters which under any provision of this\nAct, are required to be prescribed or to be provided for by rules.\n\n(3) All rules made under this Act shall be published in the Official Gazette, and\nshall, unless some later date is appointed by the State Government, come into force on\nthe date of such publication.\n\n(4) All rules made under this Act shall be laid for not less than fourteen days\nbefore the State Legislature as soon as possible after they are made and shall be subject\nto such modification as the State Legislature may make during the session in which\nthey are so laid. Any modification of the said rules made by the State Legislature shall\nbe published in the Official Gazette, and shall, unless some later date is appointed by\nthe State Government, come into force on the date of such publication.\"\n\nOn a comparative reading of\nSection 212\nand\nSection 224\nas quoted\nabove it appears that those sections have their activity field in different areas.\n\nSection 224\nis the power to make rules for carrying out the purpose of said Act,\nwhich is inclusive of giving appointment to the employees to perform the duties\nand responsibilities of the Panchayat, whereas\nSection 212\ndeals with the\ndirection of the State Government with reference to discharge of function of Gram\nPanchayat or Panchayat Samiti and/or Zilla Parishad.\n\nWhen a rule making authority being empowered under the statute has\nframed a rule with categorical restriction of giving appointment to a post not\nsanctioned/approved by the Director of Panchayats and Rural Development and\nwhen there is a total embargo of regularization specifically stipulated in that\nprovision, namely, proviso of sub-rule (5) of Rule 36 under the said Rules, 1981,\nwe are of the view that there was no scope to modify the said rule by\nadministrative instruction as purportedly intended to be done in exercise of\npower under\nSection 212\nof the said Act for the reason that even by exercising\nconstitutional power to issue executive/administrative instruction taking resort\nof\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution of India, there was no scope to vary or modify\nany rules framed in terms of the provision of a statute by the competent\nlegislatures.\n\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution of India is exercisable in a field where\nthere is no legislation but once there legislation, in that area by administrative\norder or executive instruction under\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution of India\ncontrary to such legislation if anything is done same becomes absolutely void ab\ninitio. This point has been answered by the Apex Court dealing with said specific\nquestion, which is applicable in disposing of this appeal, by a Bench constituted\nby three Members of the Apex Court in the case\nB.N. Nagarajan vs. State of\nKarnataka\n, reported in AIR 1979 SC 1676, wherein in para 5 the Court held\n\"when rules framed under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India are in force, no\nregularization is permissible under exercise of the executive powers of the\nGovernment under\nArticle 162\nthereof in contravention of the rules\".\n\nIn the case\nPunjab State Warehousing Corpn., Chandigarh vs.\nManmohan Singh & Anr.\n, reported in (2007) 9 SCC 337, the Court answered the\nquestion whether any statutory rule could be modified or altered by an executive\ninstruction far less by way of a circular letter. Paragraph 12 of the said report\nreads such:\n\"Furthermore, when the terms and conditions of the services of an employee\nare governed by the rules made under a statute or the proviso appended to\nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution of India laying down the mode and manner in which the recruitment\nwould be given effect to, even no order under\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution of India can\nbe made by way of alterations or amendments of the said rules. A fortiori if the\nrecruitment rules could not be amended even by issuing a notification under\nArticle 162\n\nof the Constitution of India the same cannot be done by way of a circular letter.\"\n\nB.N. Nagarajan\n(supra) was relied in the Constitution Bench judgment\npassed in the case\nSecretary, State of Karnataka vs. Umadevi\n, reported in (2006)\n4 SCC 1.\n\nSimilar view expressed by the Apex Court in the case\nA. Umarani vs.\nRegistrar, Cooperative Societies & Ors.\n, reported in (2004) 7 SCC 112, a\njudgment of three Judges' Bench. Para 45 of the said report reads such:\n\n\"No regularization is, thus, permissible in exercise of the statutory power\nconferred under\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution if the appointments have been made in\ncontravention of the statutory rules.\"\n\nHaving regard to the aforesaid legal position, hence, when under the said\nRules, 1981, when there is a specific provision being proviso under sub-rule (5) of\nRule 36 by declaring such type of appointment in a non-sanctioned post and\nwithout following recruitment rules as void ab initio and mandating by using\nnegative term that there should not be any regularization of service, we are of the\nview that circular letter/notification dated 8th October, 2003 as relied upon,\nbeing a notification issued by the Hon'ble Governor in exercise of power under\n\nSection 212\nof the said Act, has no legal sanction of its applicability. The same\nbeing contrary to the aforesaid proviso of sub-rule (5) of Rule 36 of the said\nRules, 1981, accordingly, has no effective force to regularize illegal appointment\nof present writ petitioner.\n\nConsidering the aforesaid legal position the writ petitioner/appellant\naccordingly accrued no right for regularization of his service in a permanent post.\nBesides such, we are relying upon the judgment of\nUmadevi\n(supra) to hold that\nthere is no scope to regularize any illegal appointment on breach of the rule. In\nthe instant case, admittedly appointment was illegal per se as the concerned\nGram Panchayat had no power and jurisdiction to appoint any candidate in a\npost neither created nor sanctioned and approved by the competent authority i.e.\nthe State Government.\n\nHaving regard to the aforesaid findings and observations there is no merit\nin the appeal.\n\nAppeal, accordingly, stands dismissed.\n\nThere will, however, be no order as to costs.\n\n(Pratap Kumar Ray,J.)\nI agree,\nab\n(Subal Baidya,J.)",

FOR THE STATE.  -------------------  PRATAP KUMAR RAY,J.  HEARD THE LEARNED ADVOCATES APPEARING FOR THE PARTIES.  ASSAILING THE JUDGMENT AND ORDER DATED 2ND FEBRUARY, 2011 PASSED BY THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE IN W.P. 23370 (W) OF 2010, THIS APPEAL HAS BEEN PREFERRED. IMPUGNED ORDER READS SUCH:  \"BY THIS WRIT PETITION, THE PETITIONER HAS CHALLENGED THE ORDER DATED 3RD SEPTEMBER, 2010.  THE CASE OF THE PETITIONER IS THAT HE WAS APPOINTED AS PANCHAYAT KARMEE ON 5TH JULY, 1992 ON CASUAL BASIS IN VIEW OF THE CIRCULAR DATED 8TH OCTOBER, 2003. THEREFORE, HE IS ENTITLED TO BE REGULARIZED AND FOR SUCH PURPOSE, A REPRESENTATION WAS MADE. AS SUCH REPRESENTATION WAS NOT CONSIDERED, A WRIT PETITION WAS FILED AND AN ORDER WAS PASSED FOR CONSIDERING THE PETITIONER'S REPRESENTATION. SUCH REPRESENTATION HAS BEEN CONSIDERED AND ORDER PASSED ON 3RD SEPTEMBER, 2010. THE SAID ORDER DATED 3RD SEPTEMBER, 2010 IS BAD AS IT HAS FAILED TO APPRECIATE THAT IN 1992 THE PETITIONER WAS APPOINTED AS A JOB ASSISTANT AND AFTER THE 2007 RULES, THE PETITIONER HAS BEEN WORKING AS PANCHAYAT KARMEE. THEREFORE, AS A PANCHAYAT KARMEE, HE IS ENTITLED TO BE REGULARIZED. THE FINDING OF THE HEARING AUTHORITY IS OTHERWISE AND THEREFORE, IS LIABLE TO BE SET ASIDE.  COUNSEL FOR THE STATE RESPONDENT SUBMITS THAT NO INTERFERENCE IS CALLED FOR WITH THE ORDER DATED 3RD SEPTEMBER, 2010 AS THE FINDINGS OF THE HEARING AUTHORITY ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULES OF 1995 AND 2007.  HAVING CONSIDERED THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE PETITIONER WAS APPOINTED ON 5TH JULY, 1992 ALTHOUGH IN PARAGRAPH-2 OF THE WRIT PETITION, IT HAS BEEN AVERRED THAT THE PETITIONER WAS APPOINTED AS PANCHAYAT KARMEE, THE SAID CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS THE WEST BENGAL PANCHAYAT (RECRUITMENT AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF GRAM PANCHAYAT KARMEE) RULES, 1995 WAS PROMULGATED IN 1995. THEREFORE, THE PETITIONER PRIOR TO 1995 COULD NOT HAVE BEEN APPOINTED AS A GRAM PANCHAYAT KARMEE.  FROM THE ORDER DATED 3RD SEPTEMBER, 2010, IT APPEARS THAT BY RESOLUTION OF 1992, THE PETITIONER WAS APPOINTED AS A JOB WORKER. SUCH POST OF JOB WORKER IS CONTINUING EVEN TODAY AS WILL EVIDENT FROM THE WEST BENGAL PANCHAYAT (RECRUITMENT OF GRAM PANCHAYAT EMPLOYEES) RULES, 2007. THE RECRUITMENT RULES OF 2007 ALSO DEALT WITH RECRUITMENT OF PANCHAYAT KARMEE. AS THE PETITIONER WAS APPOINTED AS A JOB WORKER AND NOT AS A PANCHAYAT KARMEE THE REPRESENTATION MADE IN THIS RESPECT HAS BEEN RIGHTLY REJECTED AND NO INTERFERENCE IS CALLED FOR WITH THE ORDER DATED 3RD SEPTEMBER, 2010. ANOTHER REASON FOR NOT PASSING ANY ORDER ON THIS WRIT PETITION IS THAT NOWHERE IN THE WRIT PETITION HAS IT BEEN AVERRED THAT THE POST OF JOB ASSISTANT HAS BEEN ABOLISHED AND IN ITS PLACE, PANCHAYAT KARMEES ARE APPOINTED.  IN VIEW OF THE AFORESAID, NO ORDER IS PASSED ON THIS WRIT PETITION AND THE WRIT PETITION IS DISMISSED.  AS NO AFFIDAVIT-IN-OPPOSITION HAS BEEN FILED, THE ALLEGATION CONTAINED IN THE PETITION IS NOT ADMITTED.  URGENT CERTIFIED PHOTOSTAT COPY OF THIS ORDER, IF APPLIED FOR, BE GIVEN TO THE PARTIES SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REQUISITE FORMALITIES.\"  LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE DISMISSED THE WRIT APPLICATION BY ASSIGNING REASON THAT THERE WAS NO SCOPE FOR REGULARIZATION AS WRIT PETITIONER ADMITTEDLY WAS NOT AN APPOINTEE TO THE POST OF PANCHAYAT KARMEE, SINCE THE POST WAS CREATED FOLLOWING THE WEST BENGAL PANCHAYAT (RECRUITMENT AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF GRAM PANCHAYAT KARMEE) RULES, 1995, LONG AFTER CASUAL APPOINTMENT OF THE WRIT PETITIONER IN THE YEAR 1992 BY RESOLUTION OF THE GRAM PANCHAYAT IN THE POST OF JOB WORKER OR OTHER JOB. THE CIRCULAR LETTER DATED 8TH OCTOBER, 2003 AS RELIED UPON BY THE WRIT PETITIONER FOR RELIEF IN THE REGULARIZATION OF SERVICE WAS NOT APPLIED BY THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE.  IT IS THE GRIEVANCE OF THE APPELLANT BEFORE US THAT SINCE BY AN UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION OF SANDESKHALI GRAM PANCHAYAT, THE WRIT PETITIONER/APPELLANT WAS APPOINTED IN THE POST TO WORK AS JOB WORKER OR KARMEE SAHAYAK TEMPORARILY ON PAYMENT OF NOMINAL SALARY WHERE HE IS CONTINUING AS CASUAL APPOINTEE, THE APPELLANT IN TERMS OF THE NOTIFICATION NO. 3598/PN/O/I/3S-114/2003 DATED 8TH OCTOBER, 2003, HAS ACCRUED RIGHT FOR REGULARIZATION OF HIS SERVICE IN A PERMANENT POST. THE NOTIFICATION AS RELIED UPON READS SUCH:  \"GOVERNMENT OF WEST BENGAL DEPARTMENT OF PANCHAYATS & R.D.
