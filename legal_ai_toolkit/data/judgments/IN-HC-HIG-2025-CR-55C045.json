This is an Application moved by the State, seeking recall\n\nof the order dated 24th February 2025 passed by the\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge at Dindoshi (Borivali Division),\n\nGoregaon, Mumbai in Criminal Bail Application No.119 of\n\n2025 in C.R. No.1309 of 2024 registered with D.N. Nagar\n\nPolice Station. Vide the said order, the Sessions Court,\n\nMumbai has enlarged the Respondent-Accused on bail subject\n\nto the conditions mentioned therein. By way of the present\n\nApplication, the State seeks cancellation of the said bail order\n\non several grounds. The Respondent-Accused, along with 2\n\nother accused, is alleged to have committed offences\n\npunishable under Sections 70(1), 115(2), 351(2), 123, 3(5)\n\nof the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.\n\n2. There is also an Intervention Application (St) No.19317\n\nof 2025 made on behalf of the Victim-Complainant seeking to\n\nintervene in the present Application and advance submissions.\n\nThe said Intervention Application is allowed.\n\nPage 2 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\n3. As per the prosecution, the offending part of the\n\nImpugned Order is contained in paragraph nos.5, 6 and 7\n\nwhich read as thus:\n\n\"5. The learned Advocate for accused drawn\nattention to the medical papers filed alongwith charge-\nsheet and submitted that medical examination of the\nvictim was immediately conducted and no fresh injury\nwas found, which prima facie show that there was no\nsuch incident happened as alleged by the informant.\n\n6. From the story narrated in first information\nreport prima facie it appears that relations between\ninformant and accused Shabbir Rangunwala were since\nlong Informant was knowing him since ten years. She\nwent to him on his call voluntarily. In the history no\nprevious incident from him is narrated. On the basis of\nmedical evidence though there are external injuries\nfound on person of informant, then also on\nexamination of private parts of the informant no fresh\ninjuries was seen. Informant was examined by medical\nofficer immediately on 10.12.2024. It is within 24\nhours of the alleged incident.\n\nPage 3 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\n7. Investigation of the case is now completed.\nTrial would take its own time. In such circumstances. I\nam of the opinion that basis allegations are against\naccused Mustafa Rangunwala of assault and forceful\nsexual intercourse with informant. In such\ncircumstances indefinite detention of the applicant is\nnot required. Taking into consideration the grounds\nthat marriage of the applicant is scheduled on 01.03.\n2025, I am of the opinion that by imposing stringent\nconditions applicant may be released on bail. Hence, I\nproceed to pass the following order:\"\n\n4. Ms. Megha Bajoria, learned APP representing the State,\n\nsubmits that there are several infirmities in the said bail order,\n\nwhich are as follows:\n\n(i) According to her, the Trial Court has not appreciated the\n\nmedical evidence in respect of the Victim-Complainant in its\n\nproper perspective inasmuch as that the Trial Court has held\n\nthat although, there are external injuries found on the person\n\nof the Victim-Complainant, no fresh injuries are seen on her\n\nprivate parts;\n\nPage 4 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\n(ii) The Trial Court failed to appreciate the statement of the\n\nVictim-Complainant recorded under\nSection 164\nof the Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973 ('\nCr.P.C\n.' for short);\n\n(iii) That the marriage of the Respondent-Accused is\n\nscheduled on 1st March 2025 cannot be the basis for grant of\n\nbail to the Respondent-Accused;\n\n(iv) The premises in which the alleged act/offence took\n\nplace, were rented premises of the Respondent-Accused;\n\n(v) A Mobile phone containing indecent photos of the\n\nVictim-Complainant, was recovered from Accused no.1. The\n\nsaid photographs were part of the supplementary charge-\n\nsheet, yet the Trial Court failed to consider them;\n\n(vi) The statement of the uncle of the Victim-Complainant\n\nspecifically stating that the Victim-Complainant tried to\n\ncontact him for help, lending credibility to the story of the\n\nvictim, has not been considered at all by the Trial Court;\n\nPage 5 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\n(vii) Medical report of the Victim-Complainant clearly shows,\n\ninjuries on her head. The final opinion of the Doctor also\n\nrecords evidence of physical violence in terms of the head\n\ninjury, scratch marks, etc., on her person, which has been\n\ntotally overlooked by the Trial Court;\n\n5. In support of her submissions, Ms. Bajoria has tendered\n\nthe entire charge-sheet including the supplementary charge-\n\nsheet. The same are taken on record. She thus, submits that\n\ndespite all the aforesaid aspects being part of the charge-\n\nsheet/supplementary charge-sheet and despite the fact that\n\nminimum punishment for the said offence is 20 years, the\n\nTrial Court allowed the Bail Application. She submits that the\n\nTrial Court thus, erred in granting bail to the Respondent-\n\nAccused.\n\n6. Mr. Shivamsinh Deshmukh, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the Intervenor, supports the contentions of Ms. Bajoria.\n\nAdditionally, he submits that common intention of committing\n\nthe offence of gang rape is implicit, right from the beginning\n\nPage 6 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\nas seen from the conduct of all three Accused. He drew my\n\nattention to the spot panchanama, which reveals that there\n\nwas a ladies undergarment, found at the spot of the incident.\n\nHe also drew my attention to the statement of the owner of\n\nthe flat, who states that the flat was rented out to the\n\nRespondent No. 1- Accused. He placed on record several\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, in support of his arguments.\n\nHe thus, prays that the bail granted to the Respondent-\n\nAccused, be cancelled.\n\n7. Per contra, Mr. Shlok Saraogi, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the Respondent-Accused defended the impugned order. He\n\nsubmits that there are discrepancies in the FIR and the\n\nstatement of the Victim-Complainant recorded under\nSection\nof the Cr.P.C. inasmuch as the victim has improved her\n\nstory in her 164 statement. He also submits that the Victim-\n\nComplainant is said to have telephoned her brother before\n\n11.30 p.m. but in the CCTV footage, she was seen entering the\n\nPage 7 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\nbuilding at 11.31 p.m. He thus, supports the order passed by\n\nthe Trial Court and prays that the Application be rejected.\n\n8. Heard all the counsels for the parties and perused the\n\nrecord with their assistance. Upon taking into account the\n\nentirety of the case, it appears that the impugned order\n\nrequires intercession. A plain reading of the order reveals that\n\nthe Respondent-Accused was enlarged on bail, without\n\nexamining all material aspects placed by the prosecution\n\nbefore the Trial Court by way of filing the charge-sheet and\n\nthe supplementary charge-sheet.\n\n9. Recently, the Supreme Court in the case of\nShabeen\n\nAhmad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.1\nwhile placing\n\nreliance upon the case of\nAjwar v. Waseem2\n, cancelled the bail\n\ngranted to the accused in a dowry death case, observing as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"15...... A superficial application of bail parameters\nnot only undermines the gravity of the offence itself\nbut also risks weakening public faith in the judiciary's\n\n1 2025 INSC 307\n2 (2024) 10 SCC 768\n\nPage 8 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\nresolve to combat the menace of dowry deaths. It is\nthis very perception of justice, both within and outside\nthe courtroom, that courts must safeguard, lest we\nrisk normalizing a crime that continues to claim\nnumerous innocent lives. These observations\nregarding grant of bail in grievous crimes were\nthoroughly dealt with by this Court in\nAjwar v.\nWaseem\nin the following paras:\n\n\"26. While considering as to whether bail ought to\nbe granted in a matter involving a serious criminal\noffence, the Court must consider relevant factors\nlike the nature of the accusations made against the\naccused, the manner in which the crime is alleged\nto have been committed, the gravity of the offence,\nthe role attributed to the accused, the criminal\nantecedents of the accused, the probability of\ntampering of the witnesses and repeating the\noffence, if the accused are released on bail, the\nlikelihood of the accused being unavailable in the\nevent bail is granted, the possibility of obstructing\nthe proceedings and evading the courts of justice\nand the overall desirability of releasing the accused\non bail. [Refer :\nChaman Lal v. State of U.P.\n[Chaman Lal\nv. State of U.P., [(2004) 7 SCC 525];\n\nKalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan\n[(2004) 7\nSCC 528];\nMasroor v. State of U.P.\n[(2009) 14 SCC\n286];\nPrasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee\n\n[(2010) 14 SCC 496];\nNeeru Yadav v. State of U.P.\n\n[(2014) 16 SCC 508];\nAnil Kumar Yadav v. State\n(NCT of Delhi\n) [(2018) 12 SCC 129];\nMahipal v.\nRajesh Kumar\n[(2020) 2 SCC 118].\n\n27. It is equally well settled that bail once granted,\nought not to be cancelled in a mechanical manner.\n\nPage 9 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\nHowever, an unreasoned or perverse order of bail\nis always open to interference by the superior\ncourt. If there are serious allegations against the\naccused, even if he has not misused the bail\ngranted to him, such an order can be cancelled by\nthe same Court that has granted the bail. Bail can\nalso be revoked by a superior court if it transpires\nthat the courts below have ignored the relevant\nmaterial available on record or not looked into the\ngravity of the offence or the impact on the society\nresulting in such an order.\nIn\nP v. State of M.P.\n\n[(2022) 15 SCC 211] decided by a three-Judge\nBench of this Court [authored by one of us (Hima\nKohli, J.)] has spelt out the considerations that\nmust weigh with the Court for interfering in an\norder granting bail to an accused under\nSection\n439(1)\nCrPC in the following words : (SCC p. 224,\npara 24)\n\"24.\n\nAs can be discerned from the above\ndecisions, for cancelling bail once granted, the\ncourt must consider whether any supervening\ncircumstances have arisen or the conduct of the\naccused post grant of bail demonstrates that it\nis no longer conducive to a fair trial to permit\nhim to retain his freedom by enjoying the\nconcession of bail during trial [\nDolat Ram v.\nState of Haryana\n, (1995) 1 SCC 349] . To put it\ndifferently, in ordinary circumstances, this Court\nwould be loathe to interfere with an order\npassed by the court below granting bail but if\nsuch an order is found to be illegal or perverse\nor premised on material that is irrelevant, then\nsuch an order is susceptible to scrutiny and\n\nPage 10 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\ninterference by the appellate court. (emphasis\nsupplied)\"\n\nConsiderations for setting aside bail orders\n\n28. The considerations that weigh with the\nappellate court for setting aside the bail order on\nan application being moved by the aggrieved party\ninclude any supervening circumstances that may\nhave occurred after granting relief to the accused,\nthe conduct of the accused while on bail, any\nattempt on the part of the accused to\nprocrastinate, resulting in delaying the trial, any\ninstance of threats being extended to the witnesses\nwhile on bail, any attempt on the part of the\naccused to tamper with the evidence in any\nmanner. We may add that this list is only\nillustrative and not exhaustive. However, the court\nmust be cautious that at the stage of granting bail,\nonly a prima facie case needs to be examined and\ndetailed reasons relating to the merits of the case\nthat may cause prejudice to the accused, ought to\nbe avoided. Suffice it is to state that the bail order\nshould reveal the factors that have been\nconsidered by the Court for granting relief to the\naccused.\" (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n10. I have gone through the FIR as well as the statement of\n\nthe Victim-Complainant recorded under\nSection 164\nof the\n\nCr.P.C. The Victim-Complainant has narrated the entire sordid\n\nordeal faced by her at the hands of the three accused in the\n\nPage 11 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\ncriminal case. A plain reading of the FIR as well as the\n\nstatement of the Victim-Complainant recorded under\nSection\nof the Cr.P.C. clearly reveal that although she went to the\n\nsaid flat voluntarily with Accused no.1, being her friend,\n\naccompanied by the Respondent-Accused, she was given a\n\nspiked drink, after which she was taken to the bathroom and\n\nbeaten up by accused no.1. She fell and banged her head on\n\nthe commode. Thereafter, she was disrobed, brought on the\n\nbed, her hands were tied, her mobile phone was taken away\n\nand she was brutally raped by all the three accused. The 164\n\nstatement is consistent with the averments in the FIR. The\n\nmedical report shown to me by Ms. Bajoria also indicates an\n\ninjury on left side of her head. Findings of the doctor also\n\ndemonstrate evidence of physical violence in terms of a head\n\ninjury along with other scratches and other injuries found on\n\nher person. The statement of the Victim-Complainant's uncle\n\nalso corroborates that of the Victim-Complainant. The spot\n\npanchanama of the incident also records the items found lying\n\nin the house, which include a pink colour ladies underwear\n\nPage 12 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\nalong with an old monk bottle, some cigarrette buds, a hair\n\nscrunchy, bed-sheet, etc. Statement of the landlord of the flat\n\nalso makes it clear that the said flat was rented out to the\n\nRespondent-Accused.\n\n11. I have also perused the decisions of the Supreme Court\n\nrelied upon by the Intervenor.\n\n12. What bothers me the most is the considerations which\n\nare weighed by the Trial Court while writing the impugned\n\norder. The Trial Court has considered only two aspects;\n\nFirstly, that there are no injuries on the private part of the\n\nVictim-Complainant albeit, the Trial Judge does record\n\ninjuries on the person of the Victim-Complainant as\n\nappearing in the medical report; Secondly, the Trial Court\n\nappears to have been swayed by the fact that the marriage\n\nof the Respondent-Accused is scheduled in the near future.\n\nMs. Bajoria insists, even if that ground is considered as\n\ntenable, it was a misleading statement as till date, no\n\nmarriage of the Respondent-Accused is solemnized.\n\nPage 13 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\nHowever, the fact that the Trial Court has considered this as\n\na parameter for grant of bail itself, is somewhat troubling.\n\nThe Respondent-Accused was arrested on 9 th December\n\n2024 and was released on bail on 24 th February 2025, i.e.,\n\nwithin a period of 2 and half months from the date of his\n\narrest on the ground that his marriage was scheduled in\n\nMarch 2025, despite all the material on record prima facie\n\nindicting the Respondent-Accused. Furthermore, the offence\n\nis that of gang rape. The alleged acts attributed to the\n\nRespondent-Accused are heinous. Considering the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, I am satisfied that the Trial Court has\n\nignored the relevant material available on record and failed\n\nto consider the gravity of the offence.\n\n13. The statute as well as a series of decision of the apex\n\ncourt and various high court have well settled the\n\nparameters for the grant of bail to an under trial.\n\nImpending marriage of an accused is not one of them.\n\nPage 14 of 15\n\nth\n30 September 2025\n\n::: Uploaded on - 30/09/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 30/09/2025 21:47:43 :::\n\nShivgan 903-Appln-367-2025.doc\n\n14. Accordingly, for the reasons as stated aforesaid, the\n\nimpugned order is set aside and the order granting bail to\n\nthe Respondent-Accused is cancelled.\n\n15. The Respondent-Accused is directed to surrender\n\nbefore the Investigating Officer latest within two days from\n\nthe date of uploading of this order.\n\n16. Application is accordingly disposed of.\n\n17. All parties to act on an authenticated copy of this\n\norder.\n\n(DR.
