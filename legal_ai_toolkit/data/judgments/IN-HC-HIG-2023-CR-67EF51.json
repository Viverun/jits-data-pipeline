Heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n3. On the complaint of Shobha wife of Manjunath, on\n\n23.06.2023 FIR in Crime No.82/2023 was registered by the\n\nChickballapura Police Station, Chickballapura against one Lohith\n\nBabu and three others. Petitioner is arrayed as accused No.2 in\n\nthe FIR. In the complaint, it is averred that the complainant's\n\ndaughter - Thejaswini was married to accused No.1 - Lohith\n\nBabu on 07.02.2022. The complainant has stated that at the\n\ntime of marriage they had paid dowry to the accused persons\n\nas per their demand. Inspite of the same, the accused persons\n\nwere torturing, harassing her daughter. In this regard,\n\npanchayath was held and inspite of the same, the accused\n\npersons continued to harass and torture the complainant's\n\n-3-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:32722\n\nCRL.P No. 7063 of 2023\n\ndaughter. About 20 days prior to the complaint, complainant's\n\ndaughter - Thejaswini had suffered from typhoid fever, inspite\n\nof that the accused persons did not take her to the hospital.\n\n4. Thereafter, the complainant and her husband\n\nbrought their daughter to their home and got treated and on\n\n21.06.2023 they had left her in her matrimonial home. On\n\n23.06.2023 at about 10.00 A.M., the complainant was informed\n\nby her son that the complainant's daughter - Thejaswini was\n\nnot receiving the phone. She immediately telephoned the\n\naccused and he informed her that her daughter - Thejaswini\n\nhad committed suicide by hanging herself to a fan in a room.\n\nImmediately, the complainant and her family members went to\n\nthe house of Lohith Babu and thereafter, had approached the\n\npolice and filed the compliant, which has resulted in registration\n\nof FIR in Crime No.82/2023.\n\n5. Apprehending arrest in the said case, petitioner had\n\nfiled Crl.Misc.No.387/2023 before the I Addl. District & Sessions\n\nJudge, Chikkaballapura, which was dismissed as against her.\n\nTherefore, the petitioner is before this Court.\n\n-4-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:32722\n\nCRL.P No. 7063 of 2023\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\n\npetitioner is a lady aged about 42 years and she is residing\n\nseparately with her husband, who is the elder brother of\n\naccused No.1. It is submitted that even though the entire\n\nprosecution material is presumed to be proved, no case against\n\nthe petitioner for the offence under\nSection 304B\ncan be made\n\nout.\n\n7. Per contra, learned HCGP has opposed the bail\n\napplication and submits that having regard to the seriousness\n\nof charges against the petitioner, custodial interrogation of the\n\npetitioner is required.\n\n8. The complainant is the mother of the deceased -\n\nThejaswini. Thejaswini and her husband - Lohith Babu, who is\n\naccused No.1 in the FIR are stated to be residents of Ward\n\nNo.19 of the Chickballapur District, whereas the material\n\nproduced by the petitioner along the criminal petition would go\n\nto show that she along with her husband - Gopinath were\n\nresiding in a premises at Ward No.24 of Chickballapur District.\n\nThe inquest mahazar would go to show that the body of\n\nThejaswini was found hanging in a room in her husband's\n\n-5-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:32722\n\nCRL.P No. 7063 of 2023\n\nhouse and the door of the room in which Thejaswini had\n\nhanged herself was broke open and thereafter, the body was\n\nbrought down and the post-mortem report of the Thejaswini\n\nwould go to show that death was due to asphyxia as a result of\n\nsuspension by the neck (antimortem hanging).\n\n9. This material prima-facie would go to show that\n\nThejaswini had died by committing suicide and she had left a\n\ndeath note before committing suicide. In the said note it is\n\nstated that the accused persons have tortured her and there is\n\nno mention of any demand for payment of dowry either\n\nimmediately prior to she committing suicide or even earlier to\n\nthe same. For the purpose of attracting offence under\nSection\n\n304B\nof IPC there should be some material to show that the\n\naccused persons had harassed or tortured the deceased\n\nimmediately prior to she committing the act of suicide and such\n\nharassment or torture should be in respect of demand for\n\ndowry. Such material is not present in the death note of the\n\ndeceased. Petitioner is a lady aged about 42 years. Accused\n\nNo.1 and his brother accused No.3 have been arrested in the\n\ncase and they are in custody.\n\n-6-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:32722\n\nCRL.P No. 7063 of 2023\n\n10. Under these circumstances, I am of the view that\n\nthe petitioner's prayer for grant of anticipatory bail is required\n\nto be answered in the affirmative.\n\n11. Accordingly, petition is allowed. The respondent -\n\nPolice or any other police in the State of Karnataka are directed\n\nto release the petitioner in the event of his arrest in Crime\n\nNo.82/2023 registered by the Chickballapura police station for\n\nthe offences punishable under Sections\nSections 498A\n,\n,\n\n304B\n,\nof IPC and\nSections 3\nand\nof the Dowry Prohibition\n\nAct, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(i) The Petitioner shall appear before the\nInvestigating Officer within 15 days from the date of\nreceipt of the copy of this order and shall execute a\npersonal bond for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-(One lakh\nonly) with two sureties for the likesum to the\nsatisfaction of the investigating officer.\n\n(ii) Petitioner shall regularly appear before\nthe Trial Court without fail unless exempted by the\nTrial Court for valid reasons.\n\n(iii) Petitioner shall not tamper with the\nprosecution witness and she shall co-operate with\nthe police for investigation and appear before them\nwhenever called upon.\n\n-7-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:32722\n\nCRL.P No. 7063 of 2023\n\n(iv) The petitioner shall not involve in similar\noffences in future.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nSV\n\nList No.: 1 Sl No.: 70",
