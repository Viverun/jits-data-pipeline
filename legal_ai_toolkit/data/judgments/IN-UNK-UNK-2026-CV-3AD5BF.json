Thakkar,\n\n learned Assistant Government Pleader waives service\n\n Page 1 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n of notice of Rule for the respondents.\n\n2. With the consent of the learned advocates appearing\n\n for the respective parties, the petitions were taken up\n\n for its final disposal on 5.1.2022.\n\n3. In all these petitions, under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\n Constitution of India, the petitioners who were\n\n erstwhile employees of the State Government and\n\n ultimately on retirement there-from were absorbed\n\n with the Food and Civil Supplies Department, a Public\n\n Sector undertaking, initially, prayed for a relief of\n\n granting the benefit of medical allowance in their\n\n monthly pension as well as family pension to the\n\n heirs. When the petitions have come up for hearing,\n\n the learned counsels for the respective parties have\n\n made a statement that as far as their grievance of\n\n family pension is concerned, the same has been\n\n resolved, inasmuch as, family pension is now being\n\n paid to them by virtue of the GR dated 10.7.2019. The\n\n only controversy therefore that remains is that of\n\n granting of the benefit of the medical allowance in\n\n Page 2 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n their monthly pension.\n\n4. For the purposes of this judgment, facts of Special\n\n Civil Application No.3180 of 2019 are seen.\n\n 4.1. The petitioners are senior citizens and they\n\n have approached this Court inasmuch as, it is their\n\n case that the State is not implementing the verdict\n\n given by this Court in cases of similarly situated\n\n pensioners who are co-employees of the present\n\n employers in respect of grant of medical allowance\n\n in their monthly pensions. The petitioners had joined\n\n the Food and Civil Supplies department on different\n\n dates and, thereafter upon creation of the Gujarat\n\n State Civil Supplies Corporation on 2.10.1980, the\n\n petitioners are the employees of Civil Services\n\n Department and were sent on deputation to the\n\n Corporation. In the year 1986, the State Government\n\n decided to absorb the employees sent on deputation\n\n to the Corporation and other employees like the\n\n petitioners were permanently absorbed. All those\n\n employees had been treated to have retired from\n\n Page 3 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n government service with effect from 4.12.1998 and\n\n were sanctioned pension from the State\n\n Government. Their pension is also commuted.\n\n Thereafter, 1/3rd of commuted pension was restored\n\n on completion of fifteen years and such pension\n\n payment orders are placed on record. The\n\n petitioners are also granted 50% of DA merger.\n\n5. Ms. Harshal Pandya, learned counsel for the\n\n petitioners would submit that the petitioners are not\n\n being paid medical allowance which other pensioners\n\n are being receiving as monthly pension. A\n\n representation was made, which, however has\n\n remained unanswered. Ms. Pandya for the petitioners\n\n would place reliance on the decision of this Court\n\n rendered in SCA No.12918 / 2010 with SCA No.12929\n\n / 2010 dated 5.4.2019, wherein, an identical issue of\n\n the retired employees of the Gujarat State Civil\n\n Supplies Corporation in context of prayer to direct\n\n them to pay medical allowance with the pension was\n\n considered. She would submit that following the\n\n earlier decision rendered in SCA No.16209 of 2013\n\n Page 4 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n the Court allowed the petition with a direction to see\n\n that the medical allowance is sanctioned to the\n\n petitioners and paid alongwith family pension. She\n\n would therefore submit that the petitioners being\n\n similarly situated are entitled to the benefits of\n\n medical allowance as it forms part of components of\n\n pension as decided by this Court. The aforesaid\n\n decision was even confirmed in appeal as the LPA\n\n against the said judgments have not been\n\n entertained.\n\n6. Learned AGP Mr. Thakkar appearing for the\n\n respondent - State would draw the attention of the\n\n Court to the affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent-\n\n State and submit that the case of the petitioners does\n\n not fall within the parameters of Rule 9(55) of the\n\n Gujarat Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 2002 and,\n\n therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to seek the\n\n benefits of medical allowance as a part of their\n\n pension. Reliance is also placed on Rule 51(2)(c) of\n\n the Rules which provides for retirement benefits and\n\n the submission is made that the medical allowance\n\n Page 5 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n and medical reimbursement would not form part of\n\n the retirement benefits and, therefore, the petitioners\n\n accordingly are not entitled to the benefits of medical\n\n allowance. The pension defined in Rule 9(55) is\n\n referred to for the purposes of this submission.\n\n 6.1. Reading the affidavit-in-reply, learned AGP\n\n would further submit that the petition is barred by\n\n delay and latches inasmuch as the petitioners have\n\n been fence-sitters. They have not approached this\n\n Court within time and they have slept over their\n\n rights and chosen not to come to this Court. Fence-\n\n \nsitters cannot be given the benefit of identical order\n\n of the Court, merely, because such an order is\n\n passed in the case of other co-employees. Reliance is\n\n placed on the decision in the case of \nState of Uttar\n\n Pradesh v. Arvind Kumar Shrivastava\n reported\n\n in 2015(1) SCC 237. The relevant paragraphs of\n\n that judgment are read before this Court to submit\n\n that fence-sitters who have acquiescence cannot be\n\n given the benefit of a subsequent decision of the\n\n Court.\n\n Page 6 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n7. Ms. Pandya on the other hand would rely on the\n\n following decisions:\n\n (1) Vipulkumar Atmaram Parekh v. State\n of Gujarat reported in 2009(5) GLR 3914 -\n\n \nPara 9 and 10\n\n (2) Union of India v. Tarsem Singh\n\n 2008(8) SCC 648 - Para 4 to 8\n\n (3) Lajja Ram & Others v. Union Territory\n reported in 2013(\n11) SCC 235 - Para 9 and\n 11 &\n\n (4) Union of India v. Krishna Rao\n reported\n in 2018(18) SCC 107 - Para 12\n\n8. Considering the above submissions made by the\n\n learned advocates for the respective parties, the issue\n\n need not detain us for long.\n\n9. In an extensive consideration made by this Court in\n\n SCA No.16209 of 2013, a judgment which was\n\n rendered by this Court on 20.10.2015 which was\n\n subsequently followed in the decision dated 5.4.2016\n\n in SCA No.12918 of 2010, the Court extensively\n\n considered the provisions in context of the prayer of\n\n payment of medical allowance to the petitioners who\n\n were employees of the Industrial Research\n\n Page 7 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n Laboratory and the Court has in the decision dated\n\n 5.4.2016 rendered in SCA No.12918 of 2010 in the\n\n context of the State Civil Supply Corporation, which\n\n were the co-employees of the petitioners, held as\n\n under extensively reproducing the decision. The\n\n Court observed in para Nos.7 and 8 as under:\n\n \"7. In my view, this issue is no longer\n res-integra, after the pronouncement of the\n judgment and order of this Court dated\n 30th October, 2015 passed in the Special Civil\n Application No.16209 of 2013. The order reads\n thus:\n\n \"1 By this writ application under \nArticle 226\n of\n the Constitution of India, the petitioners\n retired Government employees, have\n prayed for the following reliefs:\n\n 7. The petitioners respectfully pray that, on the\n basis of the facts and circumstances as\n mentioned hereinabove and which may be\n urged at the time of hearing, the Honourable\n Court may be pleased to issue a writ of\n mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order\n or direction to the respondent authorities and\n may be pleased to:\n\n (A) declare and hold that the petitioners are\n entitled and eligible for the benefit of medical\n allowance in monthly pension and the family\n pension, and\n\n (B) direct the respondent authorities to\n extend the benefit of medical allowance\n in their monthly pension and the benefit\n of family pension to the petitioners, and\n\n Page 8 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n (C) award the cost of present petition, and\n\n (D) pension admissible and final disposal\n of this petition, this Honourable Court may\n be pleased to direct the GIRDA, Res. No.4 to\n sent the proposal to the State Government in\n respect of grant of benefit of medical allowance\n and family pension to the petitioners so as to\n enable the authorities of the State Government\n to consider the same, and\n\n (E) pending admissible and final disposal\n of this petition, this Honourable Court\n may be pleased to direct the respondent\n authorities to start paying medical allowance to\n the petitioners in their monthly pension as\n being paid to other pensioners, and/or\n\n (F) grant any other relief or pass any\n other order which the Honourable Court\n may consider as just and proper in the facts\n and circumstances of the case.\n\n 2 The case of the petitioners may be\n summarized as under;\n\n 2.1 The petitioners joined the services of the\n State Government and were posted in the\n Industrial Research Laboratory (I.R.L., for\n short) under the Administrative Control of\n the Commissioner of Industries. All the\n petitioners were holding the technical post.\n\n 2.2 On 06.04.1981, the Gujarat Industrial\n Research and Development Agency (GIRDA,\n for short) was established.\n\n 2.3 On 30.06.1982, the State\n Government accorded approval to the GIRDA\n to take over the Industrial Research Laboratory\n with effect from 01.04.1982, and accordingly,\n\n Page 9 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n the same was taken over by the GIRDA. All the\n employees working in the I.R.L. were sent on\n deputation in the GIRDA. In the year 1982, the\n question of permanent absorption of the\n employees working in the I.R.L. cropped up in\n view of the merger of the I.R.L. with the\n GIRDA, In such circumstances, the State\n Government decided to call for an option from\n the employees of the I.R.L. whether they\n desired to be absorbed permanently in the\n GIRDA or not. While calling for such option, it\n was made clear to the employees working on\n the technical side that as everything was being\n taken over by the GIRDA, no technical post\n would continue, and therefore, upon giving\n option for being continued in the parent\n department, their services would be\n terminated.\n\n 2.4 In such circumstances \nreferred to above\n,\n the petitioners were left with no other option,\n except being absorbed in the GIRDA, and\n accordingly, they were absorbed with effect\n from 01.10.1985 on permanent basis.\n\n 2.5 After being absorbed in the GIRDA, all the\n petitioners were treated to have retired from\n the services of the Government. The\n pension was sanctioned in favour of the\n petitioners with effect from 01.10.1985 for that\n period and were permitted to commute full\n pension. In the year 19981999, the State\n Government decided to grant the benefit of the\n commuted portion of pension to all the\n Government employees who had been\n absorbed in the Public Sector Undertaking /\n Autonomous Body. Since the authority delayed\n the process, the petitioners Nos.1 and 2 herein\n filed two Special Civil Applications\n Nos.12436 and 12437 of 2009 respectively.\n\n Both the writ applications were disposed of in\n\n Page 10 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n the following terms:\n\n 1. During the course of hearing, Mr.J.K.\n Shah, learned Assistant Government Pleader,\n has tendered the affidavit filed by Mr.Ramsing\n R. Parmar, whereby it is categorically stated\n that his office has received the letter from the\n office of the Pension and Provident Fund,\n Gandinagar, and the same is under\n consideration by his office. In pursuance of\n the same, learned Assistant Government\n Pleader has submitted that the grievance of the\n petitioners will be redressed by the respondent-\n\n authority within the stipulated time.\n\n 2. Mr.Paresh Upadhyay, learned advocate for\n the petitioners, states that in view of the\n averments made in the said affidavit as well as\n the statement made by the learned Assistant\n Government Pleader, he does not press both\n the petitions.\n\n 3. In view of aforesaid, both the petitions stand\n disposed of as not pressed. It is made clear that\n the respondentauthority will redress the\n grievance of the petitioners within a period of\n six weeks from today. Notice is discharged with\n no order as to costs. Liberty to revive in case of\n difficulty.\n\n 2.6 The authorities, thereafter, started\n processing the pension cases by asking the\n petitioners to provide the necessary\n details in a prescribed format. In the year\n 201011, the sanction letters of restoration of\n pension\n were issued in favour of the petitioners with\n revision pertaining to the 6th Pay Commission.\n Since the authorities did not sanction the\n pension, after merging 50% D.A. in view\n of the policy of the State Government\n of granting the benefit of merger of D.A.\n\n Page 11 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n in pension with effect from 01.04.2004,\n several representations were made in\n that regard. On 11.05.2011, the Finance\n Department clarified that since all the benefits\n were granted to the absorbed employees at par\n with the other pensioners, the benefit of\n merger of 50% D.A. would be also\n payable to such employees.\n\n 2.7 On 28.07.2011, the District Treasury Office\n was instructed to pay pension after merging\n 50% D.A.\n\n 2.8 It is the case of the petitioners that in the\n pension, which is being paid to them, the\n medical allowance is not being paid. The other\n pensioners are being paid the medical\n allowance. The two widows of the Government\n employees also preferred representations for\n grant of the family pension upon death of their\n respective husbands who were absorbed and\n treated as retired from the Government\n services along with the present petitioners.\n However, the request was declined. On\n 09.05.2012, the District Treasury Office,\n Vadodara replied that as there was no clear\n direction for payment of medical allowance, the\n same was not being paid. On the issue of family\n pension and medical allowance, the\n GIRDA informed the State Government that\n such benefits are not being paid to the\n employees of the GIRDA and appropriate\n instructions were sought in that regard by the\n GIRDA from the Government. The grievance of\n the petitioners is that they have all retired\n and although are entitled for the benefit\n of medical allowance in their monthly pension,\n yet the same has been wrongly denied without\n there being any legal basis for the same.\n\n 3 Ms. Harshal Pandya, the learned advocate\n appearing for the petitioners submitted that\n\n Page 12 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n although the Commissioner of Industries\n has issued appropriate directions as regards\n the payment of medical allowance, the\n authorities of GIRDA for some reasons or the\n other are not forwarding the proposal for the\n grant of medical allowance and family pension.\n\n 4 Ms. Pandya submitted that it is not proper on\n the part of the State Government to harass\n helpless widows. According to Ms.\n Pandya, the benefit of family pension is\n available to a widow / widower of a pensioner\n under the statutory rules of the Gujarat Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules, but the same has\n been denied despite the fact that the\n employees absorbed in other Boards /\n Corporations are being paid the same.\n\n 5 Ms. Pandya submitted that her clients are all\n retired employees of the State Government and\n are claiming pension for the service rendered\n with the State Government. For the service\n rendered with the GIRDA, benefits have\n already been paid which do not include\n pension. Her clients are not claiming any\n benefit from the GIRDA.\n\n 6 In such circumstances \nreferred to above\n, Ms.\n Pandya submitted that there being merit in this\n application, the same be allowed and\n appropriate Mandamus be issued.\n\n 7 On the other hand, this writ application has\n been vehemently opposed by Mr. Swapneshwar\n Gautam, the learned Assistant Government\n Pleader appearing for the State respondent.\n Mr. Gautam placed reliance on the following\n averments made in the affidavitreply filed on\n behalf of the respondents Nos.1, 3 and 4:\n\n 5.

Pensioner\n means a retired Government employee who\n has been granted pension\n\n 10.1 Rule 51 of the Gujarat Civil Service\n (Pension) Rules, 2002 provides benefit of family\n pension to the families of absorbed employees,\n which reads as under:\n\n Rule 51: Pension on absorption in or\n under Public Sector undertaking:\n\n (2)(b)(i) The benefit of family pension under\n ChapterX of these rules shall be admissible\n only to the families of those who are actually\n in receipt of pension from the State\n Government, after their absorption in the\n Public Sector undertaking referred to in this\n rule. This benefit shall not be admissible to the\n families of those who got only the service\n gratuity.\n\n (ii) Family Pension shall not be admissible from\n only one source either from the State\n Government or the public sector undertaking\n referred to in this rule in case such public\n sector undertaking has a similar scheme for\n payment of family pension. The beneficiary\n shall be given option to choose either of the\n two scheme.\n\n (iii) Grant of family pension shall be subject to\n other conditions specified in Chapter X of these\n\n Page 20 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n rules.\n\n (iv) It shall be responsibility of pension\n sanctioning authority to process the claim of\n family pension. He shall forward the claim of\n family pension after verifying that there exists\n no scheme for grant of family pension to the\n families of the Government employees\n already absorbed in the public sector\n undertaking.\n\n 11 It appears from the stance of the GIRDA\n that the grant of benefit of restoration of\n pension, merger of D.A. and three increments,\n disentitle the pensioners to claim the family\n pension and medical allowance, as they cannot\n be treated as employees of the State\n Government. It also appears that the GIRDA\n proposes to rely upon a Government\n Resolution dated 19.02.1974, by which, the\n State Government had declined to take the\n responsibility of paying the family pension.\n\n 12 However, it appears that the State\n Government, thereafter, issued another\n resolution dated 01.04.1989 modifying the\n earlier resolution/policy for bringing\n uniformity in the mater of pensionery\n benefits. The relevant part of the resolution\n dated 01.04.1989 reads thus:\n\n At present the cases of Government employees,\n on deputation to Public Sector Undertaking\n of the State Government, who are\n absorbed in the PSUs in public interest\n permanently, are regulated as per the\n provisions contained in the G.Rs. F. D. referred\n to in the preamble. The question of\n establishing parity in the matter of,\n pensionary benefit to such State Government\n employees, with the provisions in force in\n\n Page 21 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n Government of India had been under\n consideration of Government. After careful\n consideration, Government has decided\n that in partial modification to the\n provisions contained in the GRs referred to in\n the preamble, the cases of the Government\n employees who select to be absorbed in the\n Autonomous body/Public Sector Undertaking\n will be regulated as under:\n\n (1) A Government employee on\n absorption to Public Sector\n\n Undertaking/Autonomous body is eligible for\n prorata pension and DCRG based on the length\n of his qualifying services till the date of his\n absorption in the PSU/Autonomous Body. The\n pension will be calculated on the average\n emoluments for 3 years preceding the date of\n absorption and DCRG will be calculated on the\n basis of the emoluments immediately before\n absorption.\n\n (2) Within 6 months of absorption, every\n such of Government employees, absorbed\n in PSUs/Autonomous bodies will exercise\n option for either of the two alternatives\n indicated below:\n\n (a) Receiving monthly pension and DCRG as\n per the rules or\n\n (b) Receiving DCTG and a lumpsum amount in\n lieu of pension worked out with reference to\n the commutation table. Were no option is\n exercised, the absorbed employee will\n automatically be governed under the option (b)\n above. The option once exercised will be\n final. The person who chooses the alternative\n mentioned in Para1 and 2(b) above, 1/3 of the\n lumpsum amount will be treated as\n commutation of pension and 2/3 of the\n amount will be treated as retirement\n\n Page 22 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n benefits.\n\n (3) In case the Government employee,\n absorbed in PSU/Autonomous Bodies,\n resigns after receiving pensionery benefits,\n the resignation will be treated as\n resignation from Government service and\n as a consequence of resignation, pensionary\n benefits received under these orders will be\n forfeited.\n\n (4) The absorbed Government employee will\n receive all the benefits admissible to other\n corresponding employees of PSUs/Autonomous\n bodies. But in respect of gratuity the sum total\n of the gratuity received from Government at\n the time of absorption and the gratuity\n received from the PSU/Autonomous body\n for service rendered there should not exceed\n the amount of gratuity that would have been\n received had he been continued in Government\n service and retired on the same pay which be\n drew on retirement from PSUs/Autonomous\n bodies.\n\n (5) Any further liberalisation of pension\n rule after permanent absorption will not be\n extended. However, if such liberalisation\n comes into effect retrospectively i.e., with\n effect from the date prior to the date of\n absorption, the benefit will be admissible.\n\n (6) In the case where the absorbed\n employee elects to receive recurring pension\n and DCRG in terms of 1(2)(a) above, and\n wishes to commute some portion of his pension\n as per the rules, the same will be admissible.\n\n (7) These benefits will be admissible only if the\n absorption is in public interest.\n\n (8) A permanent Government employee who\n\n Page 23 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n has been appointed in an Autonomous Body/\n PSU wholly on substantially financed by\n Government, on his own application in\n response to a press advertisement etc.,\n on his permanent absorption in such\n organisation will be entitled to get benefits of\n these orders except carry forward of leave.\n\n (9) All the cases to be regulated under this\n order will have to be decided by the\n concerned Administrative Departments in\n Sachivalaya, who in turn will have to seek\n approval of Finance Department.\n\n (10) The pay of the Government\n employee absorbed in PSUs/Autonomous\n\n bodies will be regulated as per the provisions of\n the G.R.F.D. No.NVT3286GOI95P dated 178-\n\n 1988 as amended from time time.\n\n (11) (i) The benefit of family pension will be\n admissible to those who are in receipt of\n pension after absorption in PSUs.\n\n (ii) The benefit is not admissible to those who\n have not rendered requisite number of\n qualifying service to earn them pension.\n Accordingly the benefit of family, pension will\n not be admissible to the families of those\n Government servants absorbed in PSUs, who\n have not completed 10 years qualifying service.\n\n (iii) The family pension will also be\n admissible to those Government servants\n absorbed in PSUs who die before receiving\n pensionery benefits admissible under these\n orders subject to the fulfillment of conditions\n mentioned in para 1(11)(ii) above.\n\n (iv) The family pension will This benefit will be\n admissible to the Government servant who\n is appointed to PSUs in the manner\n\n Page 24 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n indicated in para 1(8) above and has been\n granted retirement benefits under these\n orders.\n\n (v) The family pension to the eligible\n members of the PSU absorbed, Government\n servants will be given from one source only,\n i.e., either from the Government or from\n the Public Sector Undertakings/ Autonomous\n bodies if such organization has any scheme for\n grant of family pension. The eligible member\n may be allowed to choose either of the two\n scheme.\n\n (vi) It will be responsibility of the pension\n sanctioning authority to process the claim for\n family pension. He should forward the claim for\n family pension after verifying that there exists\n no scheme for grant of family pension to\n the families of Government servant already\n absorbed in the PSUs/Autonomous bodies.\n\n (12) For actual payment of retired benefits as a\n consequence of absorption, the procedure\n prescribed for a retired employee should be\n followed.\n\n 13 The materials on record would\n indicate that the widows of the\n\n respective employees, who were absorbed in\n the Gujarat Water Resources Development\n Corporation and were receiving the pension\n from the State Government, are being\n granted the benefit of family pension.\n The G.W.R.D.C. is also a Public Sector\n Undertaking of the State Government. I see no\n good reason for the respondents to deny the\n benefit so far as the petitioners are concerned,\n including the widows. I also take notice of the\n Government resolution dated 03.10.2012\n sanctioning the medical allowance to the\n Government / Panchayat employees, etc, which\n\n Page 25 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n reads as under:\n\n RESOLUTION:\n\n Under the Government Resolution Dated :\n 22/01/98, mentioned in the preamble, the state\n Government has decided to grant Medical\n Allowance of Rs.100/ per month to\n employees as well as pensioners of the\n State Government and Panchayat. The revision\n of the existing rate of Medical Allowance was\n under consideration of the Government.\n After careful consideration the\n Government is pleased to revise the existing\n rate of Medical Allowance Rs.100/ per month to\n Rs.300/ per month with following conditions.\n\n 1) These orders shall be applicable to\n employees and pensioners of the State\n Government, employees and pensioners of\n panchayat and Primary and Secondary School\n teachers as well as Work Charged employees\n (who have completed the service of one full\n year without any break).\n\n (2) These orders shall be implemented with\n effect from dated 01102012.\n\n (3) Other provisions of the G.R.F,D.\n Dated 22011998 shall continue to be\n applicable.\n\n (4) Accounting system and conditions\n regarding option shall be as it is.\n\n 14 I also take notice of the Government\n resolution dated 09.03.1999 as regards the\n absorption of the Government employees in the\n Public Sector Undertaking / Autonomous Body\n of the State Government. The same reads as\n under:\n\n Page 26 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n In the Government Resolution Finance\n Department No.NVT1196 GOI10P, dated:\n\n 23.4.1998, Para 3 of the said Resolution\n is substituted as follow:\n\n 3. The Government, after careful\n considerations, has decided to grant benefit\n of restoration of one third commuted\n portion of pension of pension after 15 years\n from the date of commutation or 1.4.1985,\n whichever is later notwithstanding the\n fact that having commuted the full pension\n they were not in receipt of any monthly\n pension.\n\n 15 I find merit in the submissions of Ms.\n Pandya that the confusion has been created by\n the Treasury Office, Vadodara, so far as the\n grant of family pension to the two widows is\n concerned. Ms. Pandya is right in submitting\n that the Treasury Office has no authority to\n take any decision in the absence of any\n direction or decision taken by the highest\n authority i.e. the Finance Department. I find\n substance in the submissions of Ms. Pandya\n that the petitioners are claiming the two\n benefits in their capacity as retired employees\n of the State Government i.e. for the services\n rendered with the State Government and not\n for the services rendered with the GIRDA. In\n fact, the GIRDA has nothing to do with this\n issue.\n\n 16 In the result, this application is allowed. The\n State Government as well as the respondent\n No.3 herein are directed to see that\n the medical allowance is sanctioned and paid\n to the pensioners along with the monthly\n pension as they are receiving, and at the same\n time, the two widows are paid the family\n pensions in accordance with the rules\n governing the same. This exercise shall be\n\n Page 27 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n completed within a period of two months from\n today and the payment should be made with\n arrears from the date of filing of this petition.\"\n\n 8 In the result, both the writ applications are\n allowed. The State Government as well as the\n respondents Nos.1 and 2 are directed to see\n that the medical allowance is sanctioned and\n paid to the petitioners along with a monthly\n pension as they are receiving. If any of\n the petitioners have passed away, then the\n widows shall be paid family pension in\n accordance with the rules governing the\n same with the necessary benefits. Let this\n exercise be completed within a period of two\n months from today and the payment should be\n made with the arrears from the date of filing of\n these petitions. Direct service is permitted.\"\n\n10. Accordingly, the case of the present petitioners is\n\n squarely covered by \nthe above decision\n.\n\n11. To the submission made by learned AGP that the\n\n petitioners being fence-sitters and, therefore, the\n\n decision of \nState of Uttar Pradesh\n (Supra) should\n\n be made applicable, it is needless to say that by the\n\n decision in the case of Vipul Aatmaram Parekh\n\n (Supra), this Court observing as under (paragraph 9\n\n thereof) has held that if at any particular of point,\n\n there is decision of this Court every authority of the\n\n State Government is bound to follow the same and\n\n Page 28 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n apply its mind and extended them to the employees\n\n rather than compel them to come to Court.\n\n \"9. At the outset, it is required to be noted that\n the objection raised by the respondent No.3\n that while granting the benefit of higher pay\n scale on completion of 9 years service/seniority\n prior to the request transfer is not required to\n be counted is not sustainable in view of the\n many decisions of the Division Bench as well as\n learned Single Judges of this Court. Even, the\n controversy in question is now not res integra\n in view of the the decision of the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in the case of Uttam Vishun\n Pawar (supra). All the decisions have been\n considered by this Court in the recent decision\n of this Court in the case of Naynaben Manubhai\n Vyas & Others(supra) dated 12.3.2009 in\n Special Civil Application No. 1446 of 1994 and\n other allied matters. In spite of the above\n decisions of this Court, since long the office of\n the respondent No.3 is raising same and similar\n objection driving the employee to the Court and\n to obtain the similar order. If, on a particular\n point there is a decision of this Court every\n authority of the State Government is bound to\n follow the same unless it is upset by the higher\n forum. The authority has to apply its mind\n before raising objection and grant the benefit\n accordingly and shall not compel the employee\n to obtain similar order from the Court. To raise\n the objections again and again which are\n overruled by the Court by decision would not\n only compelling the employee to incur the\n expenditure towards the legal proceedings but\n it will also increase the litigation and burden to\n the Courts, which are otherwise today heavy\n burdened due to backlog of cases and Courts\n are trying their best to get out of the backlog.\n In the case of (Smt) Dhanlakshmiben Liladhar\n\n Page 29 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n Suchak (supra) the learned Single Judge of this\n Court as far as back in the year 1992 has\n observed that the Government should be model\n employer. The model employer is one who\n would not deny just claim of his employee and\n employees on any technical ground. Such\n model employer would not wait for any\n direction to be given to accept just claim of the\n employee/employees. It is further observed that\n once it is found that an employee is similarly\n situated the benefits flowing from a judgment\n in a case of other similarly situated employee,\n it should be given to other similarly situated\n employee and employee should not be driven to\n the Court for addressing just grievances. Even\n in the case of Secretary, Labour, Social Welfare\n & Tribunal Development Department & Anr.\n (Supra), the Full Bench of this Court in para 9\n and 10 has observed and held as under:\n\n \"9. The legal position regarding the\n binding nature of judgments delivered by\n High Courts was clearly explained as far\n back as 1962 by the Supreme Court. \nIn\n \nEast India Commercial Co. Ltd. V.\n Collector of Customs, Calcuttam A.I.R.\n\n 1962 S.C. 1893, Subba Rao.\n J. (as he then\n was) speaking for himself and Mudholkar\n J., has explained though A.K. Sarkar J.\n\n who was the legal position, the legal\n position in paragraph 29 of the report as\n follows:\n\n This raises the question whether an\n administrative tribunal can ignore\n the law declared by the highest court\n in the State and initiate proceedings\n in direct violation of the law so\n declared. Under \nArt. 215\n, every High\n Court shall be a court of record and\n shall have all the powers of such a\n court including the power to punish\n for contempt of itself. Under Art:\n\n Page 30 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n 226, it has a plenary power to issue\n orders or writs for the enforcement\n of the fundamental rights and for any\n other purpose to any person or\n authority, including in appropriate\n cases any Government, within its\n territorial jurisdiction. Under \nArt.\n 227\n it has jurisdiction over all courts\n and tribunals throughout the\n territories in relation to which it\n exercises jurisdiction. It would be\n anomalous to suggest that a tribunal\n over which the High Court has\n superintendence can ignore the law\n declared by that court and start\n proceedings in direct violation of it. If\n a tribunal can do so, all the\n subordinate courts can equally do so,\n for there is no specific provision, just\n like in the case of Supreme Court,\n making the law declared by the High\n Court binding on subordinate courts.\n\n It is implicit in the power of\n supervision conferred on a superior\n tribunal that all the tribunals subject\n to its supervision should conform to\n the law \nlaid down by\n it. Such\n obedience would also be conducive to\n their smooth working: otherwise,\n there would be confusion in the\n administration of law and respect for\n law would irretrievably suffer, We,\n therefore, hold that the law declared\n by the highest court in the State is\n binding on authorities or tribunals\n under its superintendence, and that\n they cannot ignore it either in\n initiating a proceeding or deciding on\n the rights involved in such a\n proceeding. If that be so, the notice\n issued by the authority, signifying the\n launching of proceedings contrary to\n\n Page 31 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n the law \nlaid down by\n the High Court\n would be invalid and the proceedings\n themselves would be without\n jurisdiction.\"\n\n \nThe position was reiterated in \nMakhan Lal\n Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir, A.I.R.\n\n 1971 S.C. 2206. It was the context of the\n law declared by the Supreme Court that\n the decision laid down to that effect so far\n as \nArticle 141\n of the Constitution was\n concerned, but what has been observed in\n paragraph 5 at page 2209 by Grover J.\n speaking for the Supreme Court has equal\n application so far as pronouncements by\n the High Courts are concerned. Grover J.\n observed at page 2209:\n\n \n\"The Judgment which was delivered\n did not merely declare the\n promotions granted to the\n respondents in the writ petition filed\n at the previous stage as\n unconstitutional but also \nlaid down in\n\n clear and unequivocal terms that the\n distribution of appointments, posts or\n promotions made in implementation\n of the communal policy was contrary\n to the constitutional guarantee of\n \nArticle 16.\n The law so declared by\n this court was binding on the\n respondent State and its officers and\n they were bound to follow it whether\n a majority of the present respondents\n were parties or not to the previous\n petition.\"\n\n \nIt cannot, therefore, be contended by\n anyone, that since Acharya, the\n petitioner in Special Civil Application\n No. 2215 of 1979, was not a party to\n Special Civil Application No. 806 of\n 1975, that the law \nlaid down by\n D.A.\n\n Page 32 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n Desai, J. in his judgment \nin that case\n\n on August 7, 1975 was not applicable\n to the case of Acharya.\n Whether the\n law is declared by the Supreme Court\n or whether the law is declared by the\n High Court, the legal position as\n regards authorities and tribunals\n subordinate to the Supreme Court\n and High Courts respectively is the\n same as pointed out by Subba Rao J.\n\n \nin \nEast India Commercial Co.s\n case\n (supra).\n\n 10. \nIn \nShri Baradakanta Mishtra V.\n Shri Bhimsen Dixit, A.I.R.\n 1972 S.C.\n 2466, the legal position regarding\n binding nature of the High Court's\n decision was once again reiterated by\n the Supreme Court and after quoting\n the above passage which we have\n extracted from the judgment of\n Subba Rao J. in East India\n Commercial Co. s case (supra) in\n paragraphs 15 and 16 of the\n judgment, Dwiveid J. speaking for the\n Supreme Court observed at page\n 2169:\n\n \n\"The conduct of the appellant in\n following the previous decision of the\n High Court is calculated to create\n confusion in the administration of\n law. It will undermine respect for law\n \nlaid down by\n the High Court and\n impair the constitutional authority of\n the High Court. His conduct is\n therefore comprehended by the\n principles underlying the law of\n contempt. The analogy of the inferior\n court's disobedience to the specific\n order of a superior court also\n suggests that his conduct falls within\n the purview of the law of contempt.\n\n Page 33 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n \nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n Just as the disobedience to a specific\n order of the Court undermines the\n authority and dignity of the court in a\n particular case, similarly any\n deliberate and mala fide conduct of\n not following the law \nlaid down in\n the\n previous decision undermines the\n constitutional authority and respect\n of the High Court. Indeed, while the\n former conduct has repercussions on\n an individual case and on a limited\n number of persons, the later conduct\n has a much wider and more\n disastrous impact. It is calculated not\n only to undermine the constitutional\n authority and respect of the High\n Court generally, but is also likely to\n subvert the Rule of law and engender\n harassing uncertainty and confusion\n in the administration of law.\"\n\n \nIn \nHashmukhlal C. Shah V. State of\n Gujarat\n, 19 G.L.R. 378, a Division\n Bench of this High Court consisting\n of J.B. Mehta and P.D. Desai JJ. after\n examining several decisions on the\n point, observed: \"... in a Government\n which is ruled by laws, there must be\n complete awareness to carry out\n faithfully and honestly lawful orders\n passed by a Court of law after\n impartial adjudication. Then only will\n private individuals, organizations and\n institutions learn to respect the\n decisions of Court. In absence of\n such attitude on the part of all\n concerned, chaotic conditions might\n arise and the function assigned to the\n Courts of law under the Constitution\n might be rendered a futile exercise.\"\n\n From these four decisions, the\n following propositions emerges:\n\n Page 34 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n \nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n (1).It is immaterial that in a previous\n litigation the particular petitioner\n before the Court was or was not a\n party, but if law on a particular point\n has been \nlaid down by\n the High\n Court, it must be followed by all\n authorities and tribunals in the State.\n\n \n(2).The law \nlaid down by\n the High\n Court must be followed by all\n authorities and subordinate tribunals\n when it has been declared by the\n highest Court in the State and they\n cannot ignore it either in initiating\n proceeding of deciding on the rights\n involved in such a proceeding.\n\n \n(3).If in spite of the earlier exposition\n of law by the High Court having been\n pointed out and attention being\n pointedly drawn to that legal position\n in utter disregard of that position\n proceedings are initiated, it must be\n held to be a wilful disregard of the\n law \nlaid down by\n the High Court and\n would amount to civil contempt as\n defined in \nsection 2(b)\n of the\n Contempt Courts Act, 1971.\"\n\n \nThus, even the Division Bench has held\n that not following the law \nlaid down by\n the\n High Court and disregarding the same\n would amount to Civil Contempt as\n defined in \nSection 2(b)\n of the of the\n Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. However,\n in view of the unconditional apology\n tendered by the concerned officer, which\n is accepted, no further order is passed.\"\n\n12. Even in the case of \nTarsem Singh\n (Supra), the\n\n Page 35 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n Supreme Court in paragraph Nos.4 to 8 has observed\n\n as under:\n\n \"4. The principles underlying continuing\n wrongs and recurring/ successive wrongs have\n been applied to service law disputes. A\n `continuing wrong' refers to a single wrongful\n act which causes a continuing injury.\n `Recurring/successive wrongs' are those which\n occur periodically, each wrong giving rise to a\n distinct and separate cause of action. This\n Court in Balakrishna S.P. Waghmare vs. Shree\n Dhyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan - [AIR 1959 SC\n 798], explained the concept of continuing\n wrong (in the context of Section 23 of\n Limitation Act, 1908 corresponding to \nSection 22\n\n of Limitation Act, 1963) :\n\n \"31. It is the very essence of a continuing\n wrong that it is an act which creates a\n continuing source of injury and renders the\n doer of the act responsible and liable for the\n continuance of the said injury. If the wrongful\n act causes an injury which is complete, there is\n no continuing wrong even though the damage\n resulting from the act may continue. If,\n however, a wrongful act is of such a character\n that the injury caused by it itself continues,\n then the act constitutes a continuing wrong. In\n this connection, it is necessary to draw a\n distinction between the injury caused by the\n wrongful act and what may be described as the\n effect of the said injury.\"\n\n 5. \nIn \nM. R. Gupta vs. Union of India\n [1995 (5)\n SCC 628], the appellant approached the High\n Court in 1989 with a grievance in regard to his\n initial pay fixation with effect from 1.8.1978.\n The claim was rejected as it was raised after 11\n years. This Court applied the principles of\n\n Page 36 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n continuing wrong and recurring wrongs and\n reversed the decision. This Court held :\n\n \"5. ...The appellant's grievance that his\n pay fixation was not in accordance with\n the rules, was the assertion of a\n continuing wrong against him which gave\n rise to a recurring cause of action each\n time he was paid a salary which was not\n computed in accordance with the rules. So\n long as the appellant is in service, a fresh\n cause of action arises every month when\n he is paid his monthly salary on the basis\n of a wrong computation made contrary to\n rules. It is no doubt true that if the\n appellant's claim is found correct on\n merits, he would be entitled to be paid\n according to the properly fixed pay scale\n in the future and the question of limitation\n would arise for recovery of the arrears for\n the past period. In other words, the\n appellant's claim, if any, for recovery of\n arrears calculated on the basis of\n difference in the pay which has become\n time barred would not be recoverable, but\n he would be entitled to proper fixation of\n his pay in accordance with rules and to\n cessation of a continuing wrong if on\n merits his claim is justified. Similarly, any\n other consequential relief claimed by him,\n such as, promotion etc., would also be\n subject to the defence of latches etc. to\n dis-entitle him to those reliefs. The pay\n fixation can be made only on the basis of\n the situation existing on 1.8.1978 without\n taking into account any other\n consequential relief which may be barred\n by his latches and the bar of limitation. It\n is to this limited extent of proper pay\n fixation, the application cannot be treated\n as time barred.........\"\n\n Page 37 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n 6. \nIn \nShiv Dass vs. Union of India\n - 2007 (9)\n SCC 277 Paras 8 & 10), this Court held:\n\n \"8... The High Court does not ordinarily\n permit a belated resort to the\n extraordinary remedy because it is likely\n to cause confusion and public\n inconvenience and bring in its train new\n injustices, and if writ jurisdiction is\n exercised after unreasonable delay, it may\n have the effect of inflicting not only\n hardship and inconvenience but also\n injustice on third parties. It was pointed\n out that when writ jurisdiction is invoked,\n unexplained delay coupled with the\n creation of third party rights in the\n meantime is an important factor which\n also weighs with the High Court in\n deciding whether or not to exercise such\n jurisdiction.\n\n 10. In the case of pension the cause of\n action actually continues from month to\n month. That, however, cannot be a ground\n to overlook delay in filing the\n petition.......... If petition is filed beyond a\n reasonable period say three years\n normally the Court would reject the same\n or restrict the relief which could be\n granted to a reasonable period of about\n three years.\"\n\n 7. To summarise, normally, a belated service\n related claim will be rejected on the ground of\n delay and latches (where remedy is sought by\n filing a writ petition) or limitation (where\n remedy is sought by an application to the\n Administrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions\n to the said rule is cases relating to a continuing\n wrong. Where a service related claim is based\n on a continuing wrong, relief can be granted\n even if there is a long delay in seeking remedy,\n\n Page 38 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n with reference to the date on which the\n continuing wrong commenced, if such\n continuing wrong creates a continuing source\n of injury. But there is an exception to the\n exception. If the grievance is in respect of any\n order or administrative decision which related\n to or affected several others also, and if the re-\n opening of the issue would affect the settled\n rights of third parties, then the claim will not\n be entertained. For example, if the issue relates\n to payment or re-fixation of pay or pension,\n relief may be granted in spite of delay as it\n does not affect the rights of third parties. But if\n the claim involved issues relating to seniority\n or promotion etc., affecting others, delay would\n render the claim stale and doctrine of\n laches/limitation will be applied. In so far as\n the consequential relief of recovery of arrears\n for a past period, the principles relating to\n recurring/successive wrongs will apply. As a\n consequence, High Courts will restrict the\n consequential relief relating to arrears\n normally to a period of three years prior to the\n date of filing of the writ petition.\n\n 8. In this case, the delay of 16 years would\n affect the consequential claim for arrears. The\n High Court was not justified in directing\n payment of arrears relating to 16 years, and\n that too with interest. It ought to have\n restricted the relief relating to arrears to only\n three years before the date of writ petition, or\n from the date of demand to date of writ\n petition, whichever was lesser. It ought not to\n have granted interest on arrears in such\n circumstances.\"\n\n13. For the aforesaid reasons, all these petitions are\n\n allowed. The respondents are directed to see that the\n\n Page 39 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\n C/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n petitioners are sanctioned medical allowance and the\n\n same is paid to the petitioners alongwith monthly\n\n pension in accordance with the directions issued by\n\n this Court in the case of Special Civil Application\n\n No.12918/2010. That exercise shall be completed\n\n within a period of two months from the date of receipt\n\n of copy of the order and the payment should be made\n\n with arrears from the date of filing of the petition.\n\n Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent. Direct\n\n Service is permitted.\n\n (BIREN VAISHNAV, J)\nVATSAL S. KOTECHA\n\n Page 40 of 40\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022",

In other words, the\n appellant's claim, if any, for recovery of\n arrears calculated on the basis of\n difference in the pay which has become\n time barred would not be recoverable, but\n he would be entitled to proper fixation of\n his pay in accordance with rules and to\n cessation of a continuing wrong if on\n merits his claim is justified. Similarly, any\n other consequential relief claimed by him,\n such as, promotion etc., would also be\n subject to the defence of latches etc. to\n dis-entitle him to those reliefs.
