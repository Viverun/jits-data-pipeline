The petitioners in C.W.P. No. 2190 of 1988\nwere working on the posts of Superintendent Grade I,\nSuperintendent Grade II and Assistant, in Punjab Civil\nSecretariat, Chandigarh. They were members of the cadre of\nPunjab Civil Secretariat. The petitioners in C.W.P.No.7860\nof 1987 were working on the posts of Under-\n\nSecretaries/Superintendent Grade I, in the Punjab Civil\nSecretariat, Chandigarh, and were members of the cadre of\nPunjab Civil Secretariat. The petitioners in C.W.P.No. 7861\nof 1987 were working against the posts of Deputy\nSecretaries/Under Secretaries in the Punjab Civil\nSecretariat and were members of State Service Class-I. The\nprimary grievance made in all these writ petitions on behalf\nof the different petitioners, was that the policy for\nreservation in respect of candidates belonging to Scheduled\nCastes and Backward Classes, was being implemented by the\nState Government in a manner, because of which the members\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes were\nholding posts in excess to their reservation quota. This was\nnot only prejudicial but detrimental to the right of the\npetitioners for being considered for promotion to higher\ngrade. Several other similar writ petitions had also been\nfiled on behalf of others which were heard together and were\ndismissed by the common impugned Judgment.\n\nThe State has been issuing from time to time Government\nOrders in respect of reservations for members of Scheduled\nCastes and Backward Classes. One such order was issued on\n19.10.1949, making 15% reservation of posts in favour of\nScheduled Castes to be filled up from amongst candidates who\nheld minimum qualification for the posts. By another order\ndated 19.8.1952, the percentage of 15% was increased to 19%.\nBy yet another order, dated 29.1.1959 roster system was\nintroduced for implementing the policy of reservation. By an\norder dated 14.1.1964 reservation was fixed in all classes\nof posts i.e. I, II, III and IV. However, by an order dated\n23.8.1966, the State withdrew reservation for Class I and II\nposts but the reservation in respect of Class III and IV\nposts were increased to 20%. On 19.7.1968 a clarification\nwas issued by the State Government saying that in direct\nrecruitment the roster points shall be taken as seniority\npoints for Scheduled Castes. By an order dated 4.5.1974,\nreservation was reimposed even in respect of Class I and II\nposts and it was fixed at 16% (14% for Scheduled Castes and\n2% for Backward Classes). This reservation was to be\nprovided by applying the roster system. The reservation of\n14% posts for Scheduled Castes was the substantive provision\nand the roster was a machinery provision. By an Order dated\n6.6.1974, the quota of reservation was increased to 25% for\nscheduled Castes and 5% for Backward Classes w.e.f.6.3.1974.\nOn 7.1.1980 the State issued an order, the relevant part\nwhereof says:\n\n\"....it is made clear that\nthose scheduled castes/Backward\nclasses employees who get\nappointed/promoted against reserve\npoints on the basis of their\nmerit/seniority should not be\ncounted for the purpose of\nreservation but that reserve point\nshould be carried over to the next\npoint on the roster and filled by a\ncandidate/employee belong to\nScheduled Castes/Backward Classes\nso that the deficiency of\nrepresentation in service is made\nup\".\n\nThe aforesaid Government Order dated 7.1.1980 was considered\nby the High Court in the case of\nJoginder Singh Sethi vs.\nPunjab Government\n, (1982 (2) SLR 307).\nThe operative part of\nthe Judgment of the High Court is:\n\n\"For working out this percentage\nthe promotees/appointees in this\ncadre whether on the basis of\nreservation or otherwise, have to\nbe taken notice. In the light of\nthis conclusion of ours we hold\nthat any promotions of the members\nof the scheduled Castes and\nBackward the basis of above noted\ninstructions of the Government are\nvoid and honest\".\n\nCivil Appeal Nos.3326-27 of 1982, which have been heard\nalong with the present appeals is against the aforesaid\njudgment of the High Court in the case of\nJoginder Singh\nSethi\n(supra). This Court in those appeals on 8.2.1983\npassed an order of stay saying:\n\n\"We made it clear by our order\ndated 19.10.82 that there will be\nan interim order of stay against\nreversion of any of the person\nalready appointed on the basis of\ninstructions issued by the Govt of\nPunjab which have been held to be\ninvalid by the Judgment of the High\nCourt impugned in these appeals and\nwrit petition. We do not think that\nthere is any doubt in regard to\nwhat we said, namely that no\nscheduled castes and scheduled\nTribes employees who has already\nbeen appointed or promoted pursuant\nto the instructions of the\nGovernment of Punjab will not be\nreverted but so far as the future\nappointments/promotions are\nconcerned these shall be made\naccording to the judgment of the\nHigh Court and these will be\nultimately subject to the result of\nthe writ petition and appeals. If\nthe Govt. makes any\nappointment/promotions in\naccordance with the judgment of the\nHigh Court the State Govt. will\nmake it clear in the letter of\nappointment/promotion that the\nappointment/promotion is subject to\nthe result of the writ petition and\nappeal so that there is no\ndifficulty in future in case the\nHigh Court judgment is reversed by\nthis Court...........\"\n\nSo far the appellants are concerned, they took a stand\nbefore the High Court in writ petitions filed on their\nbehalf that when the reservation quota was completes the\nScheduled Castes candidates should not further be\nappointed/promoted. It was said on their behalf that\nScheduled Castes and Backward Class candidates who compete\non merit, should also be adjusted against the quota reserved\nfor them, otherwise there shall be increase in the\npercentage of the quota reserved for them. The writ\npetitions were referred to a Full Bench of the said High\nCourt. Before Full Bench it was also submitted that\nScheduled Castes and Backward Class candidates cannot be\nconsidered for appointment/promotion against general\ncategory posts in a cadre. The Full Bench however said in\nthe case of\nJaswant Singh vs. The Secretary to Govt. of\nPunjab\n, (1989) 4 SLR 257 that non-consideration of Scheduled\nCastes candidates against general category posts for purpose\nof appointment or promotion will be hit by\nArticles 14\n, 15\n\nand\nof the Constitution. It also observed that there was\nno bar to the appointment/promotion of larger number of\nmembers of Scheduled Castes. The members of the Scheduled\nCastes, appointed on merit or promoted on seniority-cum-\nfitness basis shall not be taken into consideration for\nworking out the reserved percentage. The High Court also\nsaid that roster points were seniority points.\n\nIn result the\nFull Bench over-ruled the view taken by the same High Court\nin the aforesaid\nJoginder Singh Sethi\n's case.\nThe conclusion\nof the Full Bench is:\n\n\"Thus, while non-Scheduled\nCaste candidates are not eligible\nfor appointment or promotion to the\nreserved posts at the reserved\npoint,the Scheduled Castes\ncandidate are eligible to compete\nwith the general category candidate\nin respect of the posts which are\nnot reserved and also claim\npromotion to the same if they are\notherwise eligible by virtue of\nseniority and merit and merely\nbecause they happen to be members\nof the Scheduled Caste, they cannot\nbe deprived of their right to\ncompete for appointment or\npromotion on the basis of seniority\nand merit that is constitutionally\nprotected under\nArticles 14\nand\n\n16(1)(2)\nof the Constitution even\nwhen the total number of Scheduled\nCastes members in that cadre\nholding posts are more than the\nprescribed percentage. Secondly,\nwhere Scheduled Caste/Backward\nClass secure an appointment against\n'a reserved point\" on the basis of\nhis own merit and seniority and not\non the basis of only his being\nScheduled Caste/Backward Class,\nsuch candidate should not be\ncounted while calculating the\npercentage of reservation meant for\nScheduled Caste/Backward Class, but\nthat reserved point should be\ncarried over to the next point on\nthe roster and filled by candidates\nbelonging to Scheduled\nCastes/Backward Classes. Thirdly,\nScheduled Castes/Backward Classes\ncandidates who are appointed or\npromoted on the basis of\nappropriate reservation under the\nprescribed roster point shall be\nassigned seniority as per the point\nreserved for them in the relevant\nroster irrespective of their\nposition in the general merit list\n(in case of direct recruitment in\nClass I, II, III and IV services.\n\nIn other words, roster points are\nthe seniority points in respect of\nScheduled Castes Backward Classes.\n\nIn the case of Scheduled\nCastes/Backward Classes candidate\ngetting selected or promoted on his\nown merit/seniority, he will retain\nhis original higher seniority\nposition secured by him. The\nseniority cannot be ambivalent and\nfluctuating.\n\nIt was further said:\n\n\"We have already held that\nreservation does not mean that the\nScheduled Castes candidates are\ndeprived from being considered for\npromotion to the general category\nseats on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit or on the basis of\nselection on merit. It also not\npossible to invoke the principle of\nreservation not exceeding 60 per\ncent on the total strength as\nreaching above 50 per cent is not\nby reason of any such reservation\nas such it so happened that the\ncandidates who competed for the\nselection belonged to a particular\ncategory in the counter statements\nthat on a number of occasions\npreviously all these posts were\nheld by non-Scheduled Castes. But\nif two Schedule Castes had already\ncome purely on merit it is, to be\ntaken as a matter gratifying and\nnot to be frowned upon. It is only\nif reservation in effect amounted\nto an unreasonable percentage that\ncould if at all be questioned. The\npercentage of reserved candidates\nin this case is only 14 and if the\nScheduled Castes candidates have\ncome and occupied that position in\nthat cadre on account of their own\nmerit and ability, the reservation\nitself could not be questioned and\nthey could not be deprived of their\nright to be considered for\nselection on the basis of merit and\nability. We are, therefore, unable\nto accept the contention of the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners\nthat the Scheduled Castes\ncandidates cannot be considered for\nthe vacant post\".\n\nOn the aforesaid findings the different writ petitions were\ndismissed by a common judgment as already\nreferred to above\n.\n\nIt may be mentioned that some of the questions raised\nin the cases of\nJoginder Singh Sethi\n(supra) and\nJaswant\nSingh\n(supra) came up for consideration before a\nConstitution Bench in the case of\nR.K.Sabharwal vs. State of\nPunjab\n, (1995) 2 SCC 745, on a writ petition filed by\nmembers of the Punjab Service of Engineers (Class I) in\nIrrigation Department, belonging to the general category\nchallenging the policy of reservation in connection with\npromotion to higher posts. The respondents to the said writ\npetition were members of the Scheduled Caste. On behalf of\nthe petitioners\nin that case\na stand was taken that the (i)\nobject of reservation was to provide adequate representation\nto the Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Backward Classes in\nservice and if more than 14% of Scheduled Castes candidates\nare appointed/promoted in a cadre on their own\nmerit/seniority by competing with general category\ncandidates then the purpose of reservation in the said cadre\nhaving been achieved the Government instructions in respect\nof reservation would become inoperative and (ii) once the\nposts earmarked for Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Backward\nClasses on the roster are filled, the reservation is\ncomplete and the roster cannot operate any further and has\nto be stopped. Any post falling vacant, in the cadre\nthereafter is to be filled from category reserved or general\n\n- due to retirement etc., of whose members the post fell\nvacant. In respect of the first question mentioned above, it\nwas said:\n\n\"When a percentage of reservation\nis fixed in respect of a particular\ncadre and the roster indicates the\nreserve points, it has to be taken\nthat the posts shown at the reserve\npoints are to be filled from\namongst the members of reserve\ncategories and the candidates\nbelonging to the general category\nare not entitled to be considered\nfor the reserved posts. On the\nother hand the reserve category\ncandidates can compete for the non-\nreserve posts and in the event of\ntheir appointment to the said posts\ntheir number cannot be added and\ntaken into consideration for\nworking out the percentage of\nreservation.\"\n\nIt was further said:\n\n\"The fact that considerable\nnumber of members of a Backward\nClass have been appointed/promoted\nagainst general seats in the State\nServices may be a relevant factor\nfor the State Government to review\nthe question of continuing\nreservation for the said class but\nso long as the instructions/rules\nproviding certain percentage of\nreservations for the Backward\nclasses are operative the same have\nto be followed.Despite any number\nof appointees/promotees belonging\nto the Backward Classes against the\ngeneral category posts the given\npercentage has to be provided in\naddition.\n\nIn respect of the second question as to whether once the\nposts earmarked for Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Backward\nClasses on the roster are filled and the reservation is\ncomplete the roster can operate any further the constitution\nBench said:\n\n\"We see considerable force in\nthe second contention raised by the\nlearned counsel for the\npetitioners. The reservation\nprovided are to be operative in\naccordance with the roster to be\nmaintained in each Department. The\nroster is implemented in the form\nof running account from year to\nyear. The purpose of \"running\naccount\" is to make sure that the\nScheduled Castes/Schedule Tribes\nand Backward Classes get their\npercentage of reserved posts. The\nconcept of \"running account\" in the\nimpugned instructions has to be so\ninterpreted that it does not result\nin excessive reservation. \"16% of\nthe posts....\" are reserved for\nmembers of the Scheduled castes and\nBackward Classes. In a lot of 100\nposts those falling at Serial\nNumbers 1, 7, 15, 22, 30, 37, 44,\n51, 58, 65, 72, 80, 87, and 91 have\nbeen reserved and earmarked in the\nroster for the Scheduled Castes.\n\nRoster points 26 and 76 are\nreserved for the members of\nBackward Classes. It is thus\nobvious that when recruitment to a\ncadre starts then 14 posts\nearmarked in the roster are to be\nfilled from amongst the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes. To\nillustrate, first post in a cadre\nmust go to the Scheduled Caste and\nthereafter the said class is\nentitled to 7th,15th,22nd and\nonwards up to 91st post. When the\ntotal number of posts in a cadre\nare filled by the operation of the\nroster then the result envisaged by\nimpugned instructions is achieved.\nIn other words, in a cadre of 100\nposts when the posts earmarked in\nthe roster for the Scheduled Castes\nand the Backward Classes are filled\nthe percentage of reservation\nprovided for the reserved\ncategories is achieved. We see no\njustification to operate the roster\nthereafter. The \"running account\"\n\nis to operate only till the quota\nprovided under the impugned\ninstruction is reached and not\nthereafter. Once the prescribed\ntest of adequacy is satisfied and\nthereafter the roster does not\nsurvive.\n\nIt was said thereafter that vacancies arising in the cadre\nafter the operation of the roster and the \"running account\"\n\ncomes to an end, they have to be filled up from amongst\ncategory to which posts belonged in the roster. It was\nillustrated by saying:\n\n\"For example the Scheduled Caste\npersons holding the posts at roster\npoints 1, 7, 15 retire then these\nslots are to be filled from amongst\nthe persons belonging to the\nScheduled Castes. Similarly, if the\npersons holding the post at points\n8 to 14 or 23 to 29 retire then\nthese slots are to be filled from\namong the general category. By\nfollowing this procedure there\nshall neither be shortfall nor\nexcess in the percentage of\nreservation\".\n\nIt was also said that the operation of a roster for filling\nthe cadre strength by itself ensures that reservation\nremains within 15% limit. It was demonstrated by an\nillustration as to what shall be the consequences if the\nroster is permitted to operate in respect of the vacancies\narising after the total posts in a cadre are filled by\nsaying:\n\n\"We may examine the likely result\nif the roster is permitted to\noperate in respect of the vacancies\narising after the total posts in a\ncadre are filled. In a 100-point\nroster, 14 posts at various roster\npoint are filled from amongst the\nScheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe\ncandidates, 2 posts are filled from\namongst the Backward Classes and\nthe remaining 84 posts are filled\nfrom amongst the general category.\nSuppose all the posts in a cadre\nconsisting of 100 posts are filled\nin accordance with roster by\n31.12.1994. Thereafter in the year\n1995, 25 general category persons\n(out of 84) retire. Again in the\nyear 1996, 25 more persons\nbelonging to the general category\nretire. The position which would\nemerge would be that the Scheduled\nCastes and Backward Classes would\nclaim 16% share out of the 50\nvacancies. If 8 vacancies are given\nto them then in the cadre of 100\nposts the reserve categories would\nbe holding 24 posts thereby\nincreasing the reservation from 16%\nto 24%. On the contrary if the\nroster is permitted to operate till\nthe total posts in a cadre are\nfilled and thereafter the vacancies\nfalling in the cadre are to be\nfilled by the same category of\nparsons whose retirement etc.\ncaused the vacancies then the\nbalance between the reserve\ncategory and the general category\nshall always be maintained.\"\n\nReliance was also placed on the judgment of nine Judges\nBench in the case of\nIndra Sawhney vs. Union of India\n, 1992\nSupp.(3) SCC 217 at page 737 para 814 where it was said:\n\n\"Take a unit/service/cadre\ncomprising 1000 posts. The\nreservation in favour of Scheduled\nTribes, Scheduled Castes and Other\nBackward Classes is 50% which means\nthat out of the 1000 posts 500 must\nbe held by the members of these\nclasses i.e. 270 by Other Backward\nClasses, 150 by Scheduled Castes\nand 80 by Scheduled Tribes. At a\ngiven point of time, let us say,\nthe number of members of OBCs in\nthe unit/service/category is only\n50, a shortfall of 220. Similarly\nthe number of members of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes is only\n20 and 5 respectively, shortfall of\n130 and 75. If the entire\nservice/cadre is taken as a unit\nand the backlog is sought to be\nmade up, then the open competition\nchannel has to be choked altogether\nfor a number of years until the\nnumber of members of all Backward\nClasses reaches 500, i.e., till\nthe quota meant for each of them is\nfilled up. This may take quite a\nnumber of years because the number\nof vacancies arising each year are\ncompetition category would become\nage-barred and ineligible. Equality\nof opportunity in their case would\nbecome a mere mirage. It must be\nremembered that the equality of\nopportunity guaranteed by class (1)\nis to each individual citizen of\nthe country while clause (4)\ncontemplates special provision\nbeing made in favour of socially\ndisadvantaged classes. Both must be\nbalanced against each other.\n\nNeither should be allowed to\neclipse the other. For the above\nreason, we hold that for the\npurpose of applying the rule of 50%\na year should be taken as the unit\nand not the entire strength of the\ncadre, service or the unit as the\ncase may be\".\n\nThe controversy which has been raised in the present appeals\nis: whether, after the members of Scheduled Castes/Tribes or\nBackward Classes for whom specific percentage of posts have\nbeen reserved and roster has been provided having been\npromoted against those posts on the basis of 'accelerated\npromotion' because of reservation of posts and applicability\nof the roster system, can claim promotion against general\ncategory posts in still higher grade on the basis of their\nseniority which itself is the result of accelerated\npromotion on basis of reservation and roster? The learned\ncounsel, appearing for the appellants, took a clear and\ndefinite stand that they have no grievance or objection if\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes or Backward Classes, for\nwhom reservation has been made and roster has been\nprescribed even in the promotional posts, get accelerated\npromotions against those Posts. But the question is:\n\nwhether, on this basis such 'accelerated promotees' from\nlower grade to higher grade in service can claim promotion\nagainst the general category posts in still higher grade of\nservice merely because they had been promoted before the\ngeneral category candidates, who were senior to them in the\nlower grade and have been promoted later in their turn? In\nother words, is the benefit of extra seniority obtained by a\nreserved category candidate by earlier promotion under the\nreservation policy to the reserved post, also available to\nhim for competing with his otherwise senior general category\ncandidate, who got promoted to the same cadre later only\nbecause of the reservation policy, for promotion to a\ngeneral category post also in the next higher grade.\n\nThe High Court has relied on circulars dated 19.7.1969\nand 8.9.1969 for purpose of holding that even after the\nPercentage reserved in a cadre is filled and the roster is\ncomplete, the members of the Scheduled Castes and Backward\nClasses can be promoted against general category posts on\nbasis of seniority. It may be mentioned that the aforesaid\ncirculars do not refer anything about reservation in\npromotional posts or in respect of roster to be maintained\nin the form of a \"running account\". It appears that it was\nby oversight that for purpose of coming to the conclusion\naforesaid reference has bean made to those circulars.\nHowever, the circular which is relevant in this connection\nis No.1494-SWI-74/8105 dated 4.5.1974, which had been\nchallenged by the appellants before the High Court. The\nrelevant part whereof is as follows:-\n\n\"I am directed to refer to the\nsubject noted above and to say that\nat present reservation for\nScheduled Castes and Backward\nClasses is applicable in promotions\nto and within class III and IV\nonly. Since these Castes/Classes\nare poorly represented in various\nhigher services in the State\nGovernment, it has been under the\nactive consideration of the State\nGovernment that some reservation in\npromotions within higher services\nas well should be made for them. It\nhas now been decided that except in\nthe case of All India Services, 16%\nof the posts to be filed by\npromotion to or within Class I and\nII services under the State\nGovernment should be reserved for\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and\nBackward Classes (14% for members\nof Scheduled Casts and 2% for\nmembers of Backward Classes)\nsubject to the following\nconditions:\n\n(a) the persons to be\nconsidered must possess the minimum\nnecessary qualifications, and\n\n(b) they should have a\nsatisfactory record of service.\n(2). In a lot of 100 vacancies\noccurring from time to time, those\nfalling at serial numbers mentioned\nbelow should be treated as reserved\nfor the members of Scheduled\nCastes:\n\n1, 7, 15, 22, 30, 37, 44, 51, 58,\n65, 72, 80, 87, 94 and so on.\n\nVacancies falling at serial numbers\n26 and 76 should be treated as\nreserved for the members of\nBackward Classes.\n\n(3) The reservation prescribed\nshall be given effect to in\naccordance with a roster to be\nmaintained in each Department. The\nroster will be implemented in the\nform of a running account from year\nto Year........... \"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nBefore we examine the grievance of the appellants regarding\nthe members of Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes, who\nhave been given 'accelerated promotions' because of the\npolicy of reservation and applicability of the roster\nsystem, being considered against general category posts\nin still higher grade, it will be proper to point out that\nthe aforesaid circular dated 4.5.1974 shall be deemed to be\ninvalid, so far it says that the reservation prescribed\nshall be given effect to in accordance with a roster to be\nmaintained which will be 'implemented in the form of a\nrunning account from year to year' because of the judgment\nof the aforesaid Constitution Bench of this Court in the\ncase of\nR.K.Sabharwal.\n(supra). the Constitution Bench has\nclearly and categorically said that the \"running account\" is\nto operate only till the quota provided under the\ninstruction is reached and not thereafter. Once the\nprescribed percentage of posts is filled thereafter the\nroster does not survive. As such there is no question of\nimplementing the roster in the form of 'running account'\nfrom year to year as provided in the circular dated\n4.5.1974.\n\nIn view of the judgment of this Court in the case of\n\nR.K.Sabharwal\n(supra) that a member of Scheduled Castes or\nBackward Classes who enters in service by process of direct\nrecruitment and is appointed on his own merit belongs to a\nclass different from the class who are appointed at the\ninitial stage or are promoted thereafter, applying the\nprinciple of reservation and system of roster, the\nappellants now cannot make any grievance if a member of\nScheduled Castes or Backward Class, who has entered into\nservice on his own merit having competed with the general\ncategory candidates, is considered and promoted in the\nhigher grade on the posts which are in the general category\nbecause of his seniority and merit. The rub is as to whether\nthe members of the Scheduled Castes or Backward Class who\nhave been appointed/promoted on basis of the Policy of\nreservation and system of roster can also claim to be\npromoted against general category posts in higher grade on\nbasis of their 'accelerated promotions'.\n\nThe appellants have\nalso no objection if accelerated promotions in still higher\ngrade posts are given to such appointees/promotees applying\nthe roster system i.e. against the posts reserved for them\ntill the period of five years fixed by this Court in the\ncase of\nIndra Sawhney\n(supra) expires. But whether such\nappointees/promotees can claim promotion against general\ncategory posts in the higher grade, on basis of their\nseniority in the lower grade having been achieved because of\nthe accelerated promotion or appointment by applying the\nroster.\n\nIn R.K.Sabharwal's case, this Court has treated the\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes in two\ncategories i.e. those who are appointed or promoted having\ncompeted with general category candidates on merit and those\nwho are appointed/promoted on basis of reservation and\nroster. For those who have competed on merit it has been\nheld that their number is not to be taken into consideration\nwhile working out the percentage of reservation. In respect\nof those members of Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes,\nwho have been appointed/promoted on the basis of reservation\nand roster, it has been said in clear and unequivocal terms\nthat the \"running account\" shall stop after the quota\nprovided under the instructions is reached and the roster\ncannot be operated thereafter. In other words, there is no\nquestion of promoting further number of such candidates, who\nhave been appointed/promoted on the basis of reservation and\nroster.\n\nIf the contention of the respondents is accepted as has\nbeen done by the High Court that such appointees/promotees\ncan be considered against posts meant for general category\ncandidates merely because they have become senior on basis\nof accelerated promotions then, according to us, that\nexercise shall amount to circumventing the judgment of the\nConstitution Bench of this Court in the\nSabharwal\n's case,\nbecause for all practical purposes the promotions of such\ncandidates are being continued like a running account\nalthough the percentage of reservation provided for them has\nbeen reached and achieved. Once such reserved percentage has\nbeen achieved and even the operation of the roster has\nstopped, then how it will be permissible to consider such\ncandidates for being promoted against the general category\nposts on the basis of their accelerated promotion, which has\nbeen achieved by reservation and roster.\n\nRecently, this Court in the case of\nUnion of India vs.\nVirpal Singh Chauhan, J.T.\n(1995) 7 SC 231 = (1995) 6 SCC\n684, Mr.Justice B.P.Jeevan Reddy, speaking for the Court,\nhas said:\n\n\"Hence, the seniority between the\nreserved category candidates and\ngeneral candidates in the promoted\ncategory shall continue to be\ngoverned by their panel position.\nWe have discussed hereinbefore the\nmeaning of the expression \"panel\"\n\nand held that in case of non-\n\nselection posts, no \"panel\" is\nprepared or is necessary to be\nprepared. If so, the question\narises, what did the\ncircular/letter dated August 31,\n1982 mean when it spoke of\nseniority being governed by the\npanel position? In our opinion, it\nshould mean the panel prepared by\nthe selecting authority at the time\nof selection for Grade 'C'. It is\nthe seniority in this panel which\nmust be reflected in each of the\nhigher grades. This means that\nwhile the rule of reservation gives\naccelerated promotion, it does not\ngive the accelerated - or what may\nbe called, the consequential -\n\nseniority.\"\n\nIt has been further said:\n\n\"In other words, even if a\nScheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe\ncandidate is promoted earlier by\nvirtue of rule of\nreservation/roster than his senior\ngeneral candidate and the senior\ngeneral candidate is promoted later\nto the said higher grade, the\ngeneral candidate regains his\nseniority over such earlier\npromoted, Scheduled Caste/Scheduled\nTribe candidate. The earlier\npromotion of the Scheduled\nCaste/Scheduled Tribe candidate in\nsuch a situation does not confer\nupon him seniority over the general\ncandidate even though the general\ncandidate is promoted later to that\ncategory.\"\n\nIt was also said:\n\n\"It is true that this case presents\na rather poignant turn of events of\nthe thirty three candidates being\nconsidered for eleven vacancies,\nall are Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\nTribes candidates. Not a single\ncandidate among them belongs to\ngeneral category. The learned\ncounsel for the respondent is\njustified in complaining that\nappellants have failed to explain\nhow such a situation has come\nabout. Not only the juniors are\nstealing a march over their seniors\nbut the march is so rapid that not\nonly erstwhile compatriots are left\nfar behind but even the persons who\nwere in the higher categories at\nthe time of entry of Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates\nin the service have also been left\nbehind. Such a configuration could\nnot certainly have been intended by\nthe framers of the Constitution or\nthe framers of the rules of\nreservation. In the absence of any\nexplanation from the authorities,\nthe best we can do is to ascribe it\nas faulty implementation of the\nrule of reservation. In other\nwords, not only have the Railways\nnot observed the principle that the\nreservation must be vis-a-vis posts\nand not vis-a-vis vacancies but\nthey had also not kept in mind the\nrule of seniority in the promotion\nposts enunciated in the Railway\nBoard's circulars referred to\nsupra. Yet another principle which\nthe authorities appeared to have\nnot observed in practice is that\nonce the percentage reserved for a\nparticular reserved category is\nsatisfied in that service category\nor grade (unit of appointment) the\nrule of reservation and the roster\nshould no longer be followed.\n\nBecause of the breach of these\nthree rules, it appears the unusual\nsituation complained of by the\ngeneral candidates has come to\npass. The learned counsel for\ngeneral candidates to right that\nsuch a situation is bound to lead\nto acute heart-burning among the\ngeneral candidates which is not\nconducive to the efficiency of\nadministration.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nOnce the quota is full and roster has stopped for\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes in\nrespect of whom reservation has been made and roster has\nbeen prescribed then their case for promotion to still\nhigher grade against general category Posts have to be\nconsidered not treating them as members of the Scheduled\nCastes or Backward Classes \"on any crutch\". They cannot be\npromoted only on basis of their 'accelerated seniority'\nagainst the general category posts.\nIn\nR.K.Sabharwal\n's case\nit was said that the candidates belonging to Scheduled\nCastes who compete on their own merit along with general\ncategory candidates then they are not to be counted within\nthe percentage of reservation made for such candidates in\nthe service, because they have competed with the general\ncategory candidates on their own merit. The same principle\nwhich has been enunciated by the Constitution Bench in the\naforesaid case shall be applicable whenever a member of\nScheduled Castes or Backward Classes has got accelerated\npromotion to a higher grade and is to be considered for\nfurther promotion to still higher grade against general\ncategory posts. The accelerated promotions are to be made\nonly against the posts reserved or roster prescribed. There\nis no question of that benefit being available when a member\nof Scheduled Castes or Backward Classes claims promotion\nagainst general category posts in the higher grade. It need\nhardly be pointed out that such candidates who are members\nof the Scheduled Castes or Backward Classes and have got\npromotion on basis of reservation and application of roster\nbefore their seniors in the lower grade belonging to general\ncategory, in this process have not superseded them, because\nthere was no inter se comparison of merit between them. As\nsuch when such seniors who belong to general category, are\npromoted later it cannot be said that they have been\nsuperseded by such members of Scheduled Castes or Backward\nClass who have been promoted earlier.\n\nWhile considering them\nfor further promotion against general category posts if the\nonly fact that they have been promoted earlier being members\nof Scheduled Castes or Backward Class is taken into\nconsideration, then it shall violate the equality clause and\nbe against the view expressed not only in the case of\nR.K.\nSabharwal\n(supra) by the Constitution Bench, but also by\nthe 9 Judges Bench in the case of\nIndra Sawhney\n(supra)\nwhere it has been held that in any cadra reservation should\nnot exceed beyond 50%.\n\nThe 50% posts already being reserved\nagainst which promotions have been made then any promotion\nagainst general category posts taking into consideration\nthat they are members of the Scheduled Castes or Backward\nClasses, shall amount to exceeding the limit fixed in the\ncase of\nIndra Sawhney\n(supra).\n\nIn the\nIndra Sawhney\n's case in respect of the question\nregarding providing reservation in promotion, it was said by\nB.P. Jeevan Reddy, J with whom it appears seven out of nine\nJudges constituting the Bench have agreed while one Hon'ble\nJudge did not express any opinion on that question:\n\n\"We see no justification to\nmultiply 'the risk', which would be\nthe consequence of holding that\nreservation can he provided even\nin the matter of promotion. While\nit is certainly just to say that a\nhandicap should be given to\nbackward class of citizens at the\nstage of initial appointment, it\nwould be a serious and unacceptable\ninroad into the rule of equality of\nopportunity to say that such a\nhandicap should be provided at\nevery stage of promotion throughout\ntheir career. That would mean\ncreation of a permanent separate\ncategory apart from the mainstream\n\n- a vertical division of the\nadministrative apparatus. The\nmembers of reserved categories need\nnot have to compete with others but\nonly among themselves. There would\nbe no will to work, compete and\nexcel among them. Whether they work\nor not, they tend to think, their\nto promotion is assured. This in\nturn is bound to generate a feeling\nof despondence and 'heart-burning'\namong open competition members. All\nthis is bound to affect the\nefficiency of administration.\n\nPutting the members of backward\nclasses on a fast-track would\nnecessarily result in leapfrogging\nand the deleterious effects of\n\"leapfrogging\" need no illustration\nat our hands. At the initial stage\nof recruitment reservation can be\nmade in favour of backward class of\ncitizens but once they enter the\nservice, efficiency of\nadministration demands that these\nmembers too compete with others and\nearn promotion like all others; no\nfurther distinction can be made\nthereafter with reference to their\n\"birth-mark\", as one of the learned\nJudges of this Court has said in\nanother connection. They are\nexpected to operate on equal\nfooting with others. Crutches\ncannot be provided throughout one's\ncareer. That would not be in the\ninterest of efficiency of\nadministration nor in the larger\ninterest of the nation. It is wrong\nto think that by holding so, we are\nconfining the backward class of\ncitizens to the lowest cadres. It\nis well-known that direct\nrecruitment takes place at several\nhigher levels of administration and\nnot merely at the level of Class IV\nand Class III . Direct recruitment\nis provided even at the level of\nAll India Services. Direct\nrecruitment is provided at the\nlevel of District Judges, to give\nan example nearer home. It may also\nbe noted that during the debates in\nthe Constituent assembly, one\nreferred to reservation in\npromotions; it does not appear to\nhave been within their\ncontemplation.\"\n\nIt cannot be disputed that the first promotion to such\ncandidates was given without judging him on principle either\nseniority-cum-merit or merit-cum-seniority in the lower\ngrade. It was given by applying principle of reservation and\nroster. The impugned circular dated 4.5.1974 quoted above\nitself says that it had been decided that the 16% of the\nposts are to be filled up by promotion to Class-I and Class-\nII services under the State Government, have been reserved\nfor members of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes\nsubject to the conditions (a) the persons to be considered\nmust possess the minimum necessary qualifications, and (b)\nthey should have a satisfactory record of service.\nThereafter the roster has been fixed in different grades for\ntheir accelerated promotions. In this background, while\nconsidering them for promotion to general category posts in\nstill higher grade posts, the fact that they had been\npromoted earlier on basis of the policy of reservation and\napplying the roster system cannot be overlooked. It also\ncannot be overlooked that at the first promotion from the\nbasic grade, there was no occasion to examine their merit\nand suitability for purpose of their promotion. The only\nrequirement prescribed is that they should possess the\nminimum necessary qualifications and they should have\nsatisfactory record of service. In actual working, it can be\ndemonstrated by an example. In grade 'C' which is the grade\nof initial entry in the service, there are 10 Posts. On\nbasis of roster the reserved category candidates are at\nSerial Nos.2, 6 and 10 whereas general category candidates\nare at Serial Nos. 1,3,4,5,7,8 and 9. On basis of\nreservation and roster system, the reserved category\ncandidates at Sl.Nos. 2 and 6 are promoted to grade\n'B' first. Thereafter Sl.Nos. 1,3 and 4 are promoted who\nbelong to general category. In grade 'A' which is still the\nhigher grade, there are only 3 posts, out of which one is\nreserved for members of the Scheduled Castes. The candidate\nwho had been promoted on basis of reservation to post at\nSl.No.2 will be promoted before general category candidates\nat Sl.Nos.1,3 and 4 to one of the 3 posts on basis of\nreservation. Now so far the two remaining posts in grade `A'\nare concerned, are meant for general category candidates.\nBut if the principle of \"running account\" is applied and\nonly the earlier promotion of the candidate who was at\nSl.No.6 is taken into consideration, then he shall be\npromoted to grade `A' against the second, out of there posts\nalthough the quota of reservation and roster is complete\nwith the reservation of the reserved category candidate at\nSl.No.2 against one of the three posts. So out of the three\nposts in grade `A'two shall be filled up by reserved\ncategory candidates beyond the limit of reservation and\nwithout any roster being available. In this process the\nmerit of the reserved category candidate at Sl.No.6 has not\nbeen considered. It need not be pointed out that but for\nprinciple of reservation and roster, he could not have been\npromoted earlier than candidates at Sl.Nos. 1,3 and 4 in\ngrade `C'. IN this background, can it not be said that he\nhas been promoted to the second post in grade A because he\nis a member of Scheduled Caste, as though the post was to be\nfilled up from amongst general category candidates?\n\nThe Constitution Bench in R.K Sabharwal has said in\nclear and unambiguous terms that after the quota is over and\nroster points are full, then the \"running account\" of roster\nshall stop and there is no question of promoting beyond the\nposts which had been reserved. In\nthe said judgment\nit has\nbeen said in respect of members of Scheduled Castes that if\nthey are appointed/promoted on their own merit, then such\ncandidates shall not be counted towards the percentage of\nreservation fixed for them. On the basis of the same logic,\nwhenever members of the Scheduled Castes are to be\nconsidered for promotion against posts which are not\nreserved for them, then they have to be selected on merit\nonly. They cannot claim that as they had been promoted\nearlier from grade 'C' to grade 'B' on basis of reservation\nand roster in this process they have superseded the\ncandidates belonging to the general category and even for\npromotion against general category posts in grade 'A' only\nrequirement shall be satisfactory record of service.\n\nOn behalf of the respondents, reliance was placed on\nthe judgment of\nP.S. Ghalaut v. State of Haryana and Others\n,\n(1995) 5 SCC 625,in support of contention that while\napplying the roster point the merit list prepared for\ncandidates by process of direct recruitment can be disturbed\nfor placement of the candidates belonging to reserved\ncategory, at the relevant roster point and it shall not be\nviolative of\narticle 14\nor 16 of the Constitution. That\njudgment has no bearing, so far the present case is\nconcerned. In that case roster was being applied in respect\nof posts reserved under the relevant Rules, which were being\nfilled up by process of direct recruitment. That case\nrelated to process of direct recruitment to the initial\ncadre of service on basis of principle of reservation and\nroster.\n\nOn behalf of the respondents it was urged that in the\ncase of\nUnion of India vs. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n(supra) the\nview expressed by this Court in respect of inter se\nseniority between the reserved category candidates who had\nbeen promoted on basis of reservation and roster earlier\nthan the general category candidates who were senior in the\nlower grade, and who have been promoted later, has not to be\napplied in all services. According to the respondents that\nview was expressed on basis of the circular which was under\n\nconsideration\n,\nin that case\nwhere it had been provided that\nthe seniority of the general category candidate was to be\nrestored vis-a-vis the reserved category candidate after the\ngeneral category candidate was promoted later, According to\nus, this question cannot be examined only on basis of any\ncircular, order or rule issued or framed by any State\nGovernment or the Union of India. This has to be tested on\nbasis of our constitutional scheme of\nArticles 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution.\n\nOn behalf of the respondents, a stand was also taken\nthat in view of the Constitution Bench Judgment in the case\nof\nDirect Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association\nv. State of Maharashtra & Ors.\n, 1990 (2) SCC 715, the date\nof entry in the service determines the seniority of the\nofficer concerned. As the reserved category candidates in\nthe aforesaid illustration had been promoted from grade 'C'\nto grade 'B' before the general category candidates who were\nsenior to them in the lower grade 'C', the seniority of the\nreserved category candidates is fixed and determined with\nreference to the dates of promotion in grade 'B' and they\nshall rank senior to the general category candidates who\nwere promoted later although they were senior to them in the\ngrade 'C'.\n\nThis Court in the case of\nDirect Recruit Class II\nEngineering Officers' Association vs. State of Maharashtra &\nOrs.\n(supra) was not considering the question of inter se\nseniority of categories, who have been promoted on basis of\nreservation and roster and those who have been promoted from\nlower grade to higher grade on consideration of seniority-\ncum-merit or merit-cum-seniority. There the question under\nconsideration, was as to how to fix the seniority of persons\nentering n service from different sources i.e. by process of\ndirect recruitment and promotion. The policy of reservation\ncannot be implemented in a manner to block the merit channel\nand to make it dry. It is so heartening to note that for\nwhom the founding fathers introduced the provision for\nreservation to protect and encourage entry in service, now\nare able to enter service on their own merit by competing\nwith candidates of general category. For promotion or\nappointment of a member of Scheduled Caste against the post\nreserved for him the primary question to be considered is as\nto whether be belongs to a class for whom reservation has\nbeen made. But for being considered for appointment or\npromotion against a general category post, merit is the\nprimary consideration because the applicant is to enter into\nthe service or grade of service through merit channel.\n\nWhen framers of the Constitution by\nArticle 16\n\nguaranteed equality of opportunity in mattes of public\nemployment, they armed at combining democratization with\nefficiency. In the process of democratization\nArticle 16(4)\n\nenabled the State to make provisions for reservation of\nappointments or posts in favour of any backward class of\ncitizens which, in the opinion of the State is not\nadequately represented in the services under the State. As\nhas been pointed out by this Court that at the same time\n\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution enjoins to take into\nconsideration the claims of the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes \"consistently with the\nmaintenance of efficiency of the administration\" while the\nmaking of appointments to services and posts in connection\nwith the affairs of the union or of a State. Thus it has\nbeen conceived by our Constitution that a process should be\nadopted while making appointments through direct recruitment\nor promotion in which the merit is not ignored. For\nattracting meritorious and talented persons to the public\nservices, a balance has to be struck, while making\nprovisions for reservation in respect of a section of the\nsociety. This Court from time to time has been issuing\ndirections to maintain that balance in the public services\nso that there should not be discontentment, heart-burning\nand frustration, which can never be held to be in the larger\ninterest of the society. It has been pointed out in the case\nof\nIndra Sawhney\n(supra) that reservation in promotions at\nvarious stages has resulted in considerable discontentment\nbecause many senior persons inspite of their efficiency and\ndedicated work find themselves superseded by their juniors\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes or Tribes for that reason\nalone. In many cases seniors to their horror find themselves\nmade junior to even those who actually worked as their\nsubordinates due to this factor alone. All concerned who are\ninvolved and interested in the uplift and growth of the\nnation have to work out a system by which the injustice done\nto a section of people in our society at certain period of\nhistory can be rectified by providing protections to their\ndescendants, but we have to be conscious, at the same time\nthat the efficiency of the administration of the country is\nnot harmed and there is no reverse discrimination. Promotion\nis an important incident of service. It covers both\nadvancement between srades within the same class and between\ndifferent classes. Seniority in service is one of the\nimportant factors in making promotion. Even where process of\npromotion by selection is adopted, seniority has an\nimportance in case of equal merit. The principal object of a\npromotion system is to secure the best possible incumbents\nfor the higher position while maintaining the morale of the\nwhole organization. The best public interest is served when\nequal opportunities for promotion exists for all qualified\nemployees. Civil servants are able to move up 'the promotion\nladder' as the merit deserves and the vacancies occur. Right\nto equality enshrined in the Constitution is to be reserved\nby preventing reverse discrimination as well. The guarantee\nof equality requires maintenance of original or panel inter\nse seniority between the general category candidate and the\nearlier promoted reserved category candidate under the\nreservation policy, for promotion to the higher general\nvacancy. The equality principle requires exclusion of the\nfactor of extra weightage of earlier promotion to a reserved\ncategory candidate because of reservation alone, when he\ncompetes for further promotion to a general category with a\ngeneral category candidate, senior to him in the panel. Any\nother view would amount to reverse discrimination and\nviolative of the guarantee of equality in\nArticles 14\nto 16.\n\nWe respectfully concur with the view in\nUnion of India\nvs. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n, (supra) that seniority between the\nreserved category candidates and general candidates in the\npromoted category shall continue to be governed by their\npanel position i.e. with reference to their inter se\nseniority in the lower grade. The rule of reservation gives\naccelerated promotion, but it does not give the accelerated\nconsequential seniority'. If a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled\nTribe candidate is promoted earlier because of the rule of\nreservation/roster and his senior belonging to the general\ncategory candidate is promoted later to that higher grade\nthe general category candidate shall regain his seniority\nover such earlier promoted scheduled caste/tribe candidate.\nAs already pointed out above that when a scheduled\ncaste/tribe candidate is promoted earlier by applying the\nrule of reservation/roster against a post reserved for such\nscheduled caste/tribe candidate, in this process he does not\nsupersede his seniors belonging to the general category. In\nthis process there was no occasion to examine the merit of\nsuch scheduled caste/tribe candidate vis-a-vis his seniors\nbelonging to the general category. As such it will be only\nrational, just and proper to hold that when the general\ncategory candidate is promoted later from the lower grade to\nthe higher grade, he will be considered senior to a\ncandidate belonging to the scheduled caste/tribe who had\nbeen given accelerated promotion against the post reserved\nfor him. Whenever a question arises for filling up a post\nreserved for scheduled caste/tribe candidate in still higher\ngrade then such candidate belonging to scheduled caste/tribe\nshall be promoted first but when the consideration is in\nrespect of promotion against the general category post in\nstill higher grade then the general category candidate who\nhas been promoted later shall be considered senior and his\ncase shall be considered first for promotion applying either\nprinciple of seniority cum merit or merit cum seniority. If\nthis rule and procedure is not applied then result will be\nthat majority of the posts in the higher grade shall be held\nat one stage by persons who have not only entered in service\non basis of reservation and roster but have excluded the\ngeneral category candidates from being promoted to the posts\nreserved for general category candidates merely on the\nground of their initial accelerated promotions. This will\nnot be consistent with the requirement or the spirit of\n\nArticle 16(4)\nor\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution.\n\nAccording to us, the Full Bench was not justified in\nsaying in the case of\nJaswant Singh vs. The Secretary to\nGovt. of Punjab\n(supra) that non consideration of Scheduled\nCastes candidates against general category posts on basis of\ntheir prior promotion will be hit by\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\nThat view shall be deemed to be against\nthe pronouncement of this Court by the nine Judges Bench in\nthe case of\nIndra Sawhney\n(supra) as well as the view\nexpressed by the Constitution Bench in the case of\n\nR.K.Sabharwal\n(supra).\n\nAccordingly, the appeals are allowed\nand that part of the judgment of the Full Bench in the case\nof\nJaswant Singh vs. The Secretary to Govt. of Punjab\n\n(supra) is reversed. Now the case of the appellants and\nothers similarly situated should be considered in the light\nof this judgment. We are not inclined to examine individual\ngrievances and to work out the effect of the views expressed\nby us. That shall be done by the State Government. In the\nfacts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no\norders as to cost.",

THE PETITIONERS IN C.W.P. NO. 2190 OF 1988 WERE WORKING ON THE POSTS OF SUPERINTENDENT GRADE I, SUPERINTENDENT GRADE II AND ASSISTANT, IN PUNJAB CIVIL SECRETARIAT, CHANDIGARH. THEY WERE MEMBERS OF THE CADRE OF PUNJAB CIVIL SECRETARIAT. THE PETITIONERS IN C.W.P.NO.7860 OF 1987 WERE WORKING ON THE POSTS OF UNDER-  SECRETARIES/SUPERINTENDENT GRADE I, IN THE PUNJAB CIVIL SECRETARIAT, CHANDIGARH, AND WERE MEMBERS OF THE CADRE OF PUNJAB CIVIL SECRETARIAT. THE PETITIONERS IN C.W.P.NO. 7861 OF 1987 WERE WORKING AGAINST THE POSTS OF DEPUTY SECRETARIES/UNDER SECRETARIES IN THE PUNJAB CIVIL SECRETARIAT AND WERE MEMBERS OF STATE SERVICE CLASS-I. THE PRIMARY GRIEVANCE MADE IN ALL THESE WRIT PETITIONS ON BEHALF OF THE DIFFERENT PETITIONERS, WAS THAT THE POLICY FOR RESERVATION IN RESPECT OF CANDIDATES BELONGING TO SCHEDULED CASTES AND BACKWARD CLASSES, WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT IN A MANNER, BECAUSE OF WHICH THE MEMBERS BELONGING TO THE SCHEDULED CASTES AND BACKWARD CLASSES WERE HOLDING POSTS IN EXCESS TO THEIR RESERVATION QUOTA. THIS WAS NOT ONLY PREJUDICIAL BUT DETRIMENTAL TO THE RIGHT OF THE PETITIONERS FOR BEING CONSIDERED FOR PROMOTION TO HIGHER GRADE. SEVERAL OTHER SIMILAR WRIT PETITIONS HAD ALSO BEEN FILED ON BEHALF OF OTHERS WHICH WERE HEARD TOGETHER AND WERE DISMISSED BY THE COMMON IMPUGNED JUDGMENT.  THE STATE HAS BEEN ISSUING FROM TIME TO TIME GOVERNMENT ORDERS IN RESPECT OF RESERVATIONS FOR MEMBERS OF SCHEDULED CASTES AND BACKWARD CLASSES. ONE SUCH ORDER WAS ISSUED ON 19.10.1949, MAKING 15% RESERVATION OF POSTS IN FAVOUR OF SCHEDULED CASTES TO BE FILLED UP FROM AMONGST CANDIDATES WHO HELD MINIMUM QUALIFICATION FOR THE POSTS. BY ANOTHER ORDER DATED 19.8.1952, THE PERCENTAGE OF 15% WAS INCREASED TO 19%. BY YET ANOTHER ORDER, DATED 29.1.1959 ROSTER SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED FOR IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY OF RESERVATION. BY AN ORDER DATED 14.1.1964 RESERVATION WAS FIXED IN ALL CLASSES OF POSTS I.E. I, II, III AND IV. HOWEVER, BY AN ORDER DATED 23.8.1966, THE STATE WITHDREW RESERVATION FOR CLASS I AND II POSTS BUT THE RESERVATION IN RESPECT OF CLASS III AND IV POSTS WERE INCREASED TO 20%. ON 19.7.1968 A CLARIFICATION WAS ISSUED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT SAYING THAT IN DIRECT RECRUITMENT THE ROSTER POINTS SHALL BE TAKEN AS SENIORITY POINTS FOR SCHEDULED CASTES. BY AN ORDER DATED 4.5.1974, RESERVATION WAS REIMPOSED EVEN IN RESPECT OF CLASS I AND II POSTS AND IT WAS FIXED AT 16% (14% FOR SCHEDULED CASTES AND 2% FOR BACKWARD CLASSES). THIS RESERVATION WAS TO BE PROVIDED BY APPLYING THE ROSTER SYSTEM. THE RESERVATION OF 14% POSTS FOR SCHEDULED CASTES WAS THE SUBSTANTIVE PROVISION AND THE ROSTER WAS A MACHINERY PROVISION. BY AN ORDER DATED 6.6.1974, THE QUOTA OF RESERVATION WAS INCREASED TO 25% FOR SCHEDULED CASTES AND 5% FOR BACKWARD CLASSES W.E.F.6.3.1974."
