The essential facts of the cases that are required for the disposal of\n\n the writ petitions are deliberated as follows:-\n\n 3.1. Petitioner in W.P.No.24381 of 2025 belongs to Konda Reddis\n\n (ST) community, which falls under the category of 'Schedules Tribes' as per\n\n the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950. He was issued with such\n\n __________\n\n Page No.4 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n community certificate on 01.03.1972 by the Tahsildar. Thereafter, the\n\n petitioner got appointed in Vijaya Bank (now Bank of Baroda) in the year\n\n 1984. After completing 37 years of service, he reached superannuation on\n\n 30.06.2021 and the petitioner was sanctioned with his own contribution of\n\n Provident Fund amounts and provisional pension alone. Other retirement\n\n benefits such as sanctioned gratuity, earned leave encashment and full\n\n pension/commutation, are yet to be received by the petitioner and the\n\n petitioner has initiated separate legal proceedings to secure those retirement\n\n benefits.\n\n 3.2. On 16.05.2025, nearly after four years from the date of retirement\n\n of the petitioner, the second respondent has issued a notice calling upon the\n\n petitioner to appear for enquiry on 20.05.2025 for verification of his\n\n community certificate, which was issued 53 years ago. Based on the same,\n\n the first respondent has issued a show cause notice to the petitioner on\n\n 03.06.2025. Aggrieved against the same, the petitioner has filed the present\n\n writ petition.\n\n __________\n\n Page No.5 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n 3.3. Meanwhile, in W.P.No.24387 of 2025, the petitioner therein also\n\n belongs to Konda Reddis (ST) community, which falls under the category of\n\n 'Schedules Tribes' as per the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950.\n\n Issued with a community certificate on 02.02.1980 by the Tahsildar, the\n\n petitioner was appointed in the year 1981 in the office of the third\n\n respondent herein/ Southern Railways. After completing 37 years of service,\n\n the petitioner attained superannuation on 30.12.2018. Likewise in this matter\n\n also, the petitioner was sanctioned with provisional pension alone and other\n\n retirement benefits such as full pension, gratuity, earned leave encashment,\n\n etc., have not been granted, for which, the petitioner has given\n\n representation to the third respondent and the same is pending. While that\n\n being so, on 17.06.2025, the second respondent issued a notice calling the\n\n petitioner to appear for enquiry on 26.02.2025 for verification of his\n\n community certificate, issued 45 years ago. Aggrieved against the same, the\n\n petitioner has preferred the present writ petition.\n\n 4. Mr.V.Vijay Shankar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners\n\n in both the writ petitions, submitted that this Court in a series of judgments\n\n has consistently taken a view that after retirement of an employee, the\n\n __________\n\n Page No.6 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n process of verification will be academic and has restrained the\n\n committee/verifying authority from proceeding further. The petitioners have\n\n not been summoned for more than 40 years for verification of certificate and\n\n in the interregnum reached superannuation. Therefore, he would submit that\n\n respondents may be refrained from conducting verification of the petitioners'\n\n caste status, since they have retired from service. The petitioners have also\n\n filed affidavits of undertaking, respectively, stating that they will not make\n\n any claim or concession based on their community certificates.\n\n 5. Per contra, the learned Additional Government Pleader appearing\n\n for the respondents would submit that the impugned summons and show\n\n cause notice have been issued to the petitioners only to appear before the\n\n first respondent to submit their explanation along with proof of documents,\n\n if any, and no adverse orders would be passed and the authorities concerned\n\n are taking steps to verify the community certificates in the light of the\n\n direction issued by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide orders dated 25.02.2025\n\n and 02.06.2025 in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.27890 of 2019.\n\n 6. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the\n\n __________\n\n Page No.7 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the official\n\n respondents and perused the materials placed before this Court.\n\n 7. The extract of the observations and directions issued by the Hon'ble\n\n Apex Court vide orders dated 25.02.2025 in Special Leave to Appeal (C)\n\n No.27890 of 2019 is as follows:-\n\n “4. This litigation has something to do with Caste\n Certificate. It is the case of the respondent herein that she\n belongs to Hindu Konda Reddis Community (Scheduled\n Tribe).\n\n 5. She applied for a caste certificate for her son. The\n same was declined after an inquiry undertaken by Revenue\n Divisional Officer (for short the “RDO”). In such\n circumstances, the respondent preferred a writ petition in\n the High Court. The High court disposed of the writ petition\n observing the following in para 7:-\n\n “7. Be that as it may. As on date, the\n Community Certificates issued to the Petitioner, her\n sister, her brother and also of her close relatives,\n were not cancelled and when they were not\n cancelled, there cannot be any impediment in issuing\n the Community Certificate to the Petitioner's son.\n Accordingly, the Respondent RDO Mettur Dam,\n Salem District, is directed to issue a Community\n Certificate to the Petitioner's son S.P. Yesvanth,\n\n __________\n\n Page No.8 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt\n of a copy of this order. Thereafter, the Respondent-\n RDO, Mettur Dam, Salem District is directed to refer\n the said Community Certificate of the Petitioner,\n Petitioner's brother, Petitioner's sister and also her\n close relatives and .also of her son to be issued as\n directed above, to the State Level Scrutiny Committee\n for verification of the genuineness of the same. The\n State Level Scrutiny Committee shall verify the\n genuineness of the community. Certificates of the\n Petitioner, Petitioner's brother, Petitioner's sister\n and also of her close relatives, as also her son to be\n issued as directed above, and pass appropriate\n orders on or before 31.10.2019.”\n\n 6. Para 7 is in two parts. The first part of the para 7\n says that the necessary certificate be issued in favour of the\n son of the respondent herein and the second part says that\n after the same is issued let there be a thorough inquiry at\n the end of the State Level Scrutiny Committee whether the\n entire family belongs to the Hindu Konda Reddis\n Community (ST) or not.\n\n 7. Caste Certificate seems to be a big big problem in\n the State of Tamil Nadu. It appears that thousands of such\n certificates have been issued certifying people to be\n members of the Hindu Konda Reddis Community falling\n within Scheduled Tribe.\n\n 8. It is a different thing to say whether RDO could\n have inquired into the genuineness of the claim or not. We\n do not propose to get into this controversy for the present.\n\n __________\n\n Page No.9 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n 9. However, we would like to ensure whether these\n certificates are genuine or not. We would also like to know\n in what manner such caste certificates have been procured\n by thousands of people in the area.\n\n 10. For the present, we do not level any allegations\n but prima facie it appears to be a huge racket. This is\n something extremely dangerous.\n\n 11. In such circumstances, we propose to pass an\n interim order today.\n\n 12. We are conscious of the fact that the State has\n been able to obtain an interim order by which the operation\n of the impugned judgment has been stayed. However, we\n modify the order to the extent that let the State Level\n Scrutiny Committee undertake an extensive inquiry into this\n issue at the earliest and file its report before us to enable us\n to proceed further in the matter. We direct the State Level\n Scrutiny Committee to undertake this exercise at the earliest\n and file its appropriate report within six weeks from today\n without fail. The Report should be exhaustive supported by\n some contemporaneous record and it should be in correct\n english.\n\n 13. Once the report comes on record, we shall\n thereafter proceed to look into each of the petitions\n independently and decide them on their own merits.\n\n __________\n\n Page No.10 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n 14. It goes without saying that in the course of the\n inquiry all stake holders in other words all those who claim\n to be members of this Hindu Konda Reddis Community shall\n be heard.\n\n 15. The Committee shall undertake a fair, transparent\n and impartial inquiry without being influenced in any\n manner by any of the observations made in the impugned\n order or by any other extraneous consideration including\n any observation made by this Court on merits in the present\n order.\n\n 16. We expect the State level Scrutiny Committee to\n assist us in the right direction.\n\n 17. Rest of the interim order shall continue to\n operate.\n\n 18. The impugned order of the High Court is modified\n to the extent indicated above.\n\n 19. List the matter(s) after the report of the State\n Level Scrutiny Committee is received. ”.\n\n 8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, while hearing Appeal (C) No.27890 of\n\n 2019, arising out of the impugned final judgment and order passed by this\n\n Court, dated 22.04.2019 in W.P.No.11336 of 2019, wherein the writ\n\n petitioner has approached this Court for a direction to the official\n\n respondents to issue community certificate to her son S.P.Yesvanth to the\n\n __________\n\n Page No.11 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n effect that he belongs to the Hindu Konda Reddis Community (ST) in the\n\n light of the Community Certificate issued in favour of the petitioner on\n\n 30.06.1986. She has sought for a similar certificate for her son on\n\n 20.10.2016, by enclosing necessary documents including Community\n\n Certificates of herself, her sister, her brother and other close relatives, which\n\n came to be rejected by the official respondent therein. The counsel for the\n\n petitioner therein has submitted that a common impugned order was passed\n\n in respect of several individuals who applied along with the petitioner by\n\n assigning stereo-typed reasons and the respondent has summarily rejected\n\n the petitioner's request. Considering the same, this Court, vide its order dated\n\n 22.04.2019, has directed the respondents to issue community certificate to\n\n the petitioner's son, which shall be sent to the State Level Scrutiny\n\n Committee for verification of the genuineness of the community certificate\n\n along with the community certificates of the petitioner, her sister, her\n\n brother and other close relatives. The facts of the present writ petitions are\n\n totally different to that of the writ petition cited by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court in Appeal (C) No.27890 of 2019. In the present case on hand, the\n\n petitioners have rendered 37 years of service to the Government, and after\n\n __________\n\n Page No.12 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n attaining superannuation, the genuineness of the community certificates of\n\n the petitioners have been questioned by the respondents, which this Court\n\n feels is purely academic.\n\n 9. A similar issue was considered by this Bench in W.P.No.31452 of\n\n 2022, in which I was one of the parties to the said order. I allowed the claim\n\n made by the petitioner therein, holding that the action of the respondent in\n\n initiating a vigilance enquiry after the petitioner’s superannuation, and in\n\n passing the impugned order after an unexplained and inordinate delay of\n\n seven years, was not sustainable. It was observed that such delay could not\n\n be construed as falling within a reasonable time and was therefore\n\n unjustifiable. However, the other learned Judge constituting the Division\n\n Bench rendered a divergent view and dismissed the petitioner’s claim. In\n\n view of the difference of opinion, the writ petition was placed before a Third\n\n Judge for resolution of the point of divergence. The learned This Judge of\n\n this Court, vide its order dated 20.09.2024, concurred with the views\n\n expressed by me.\n\n __________\n\n Page No.13 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n \n10. It is also pertinent to note that in the decision rendered by the\n\n Hon'ble Apex Court in \nUnion of India vs. S.Renuka (S.L.P.(C)\n\n No.24458/2019\n) vide order dated 03.03.2023, the Hon'ble Apex Court has\n\n recorded the submissions made by the learned senior counsel for the first\n\n respondent, held that the respondent No.1, who served in the Railways has\n\n superannuated on 28.02.2022 and therefore, the exercise in this case would\n\n largely be academic on the aspect of whether she belonged to the claimed\n\n Scheduled Tribe category, and considering the above, closed the\n\n proceedings.\n\n 11. It is seen from the records that the petitioners in W.P.Nos.24381 &\n\n 24387 of 2025 have rendered nearly 37 years of service to the Government\n\n and attained superannuation in their service on 30.06.2021 and 31.12.2018\n\n respectively. Therefore, questioning the genuineness of their community\n\n certificates, after a long time, that too, after a lapse of more than nearly 4\n\n years and 7 years respectively, after their retirement, is definitely uncalled\n\n for.\n\n __________\n\n Page No.14 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n \n12. The Apex Court in the case of \nR.Sundaram vs. The Tamil Nadu\n\n State Level Scrutiny Committee and Others\n dated 17.03.2023, in Paragraph\n\n No.16 held as follows:-\n\n “16. It has been explicitly stated by this court that the\n exercise of verification of community certificate must be\n completed expeditiously. In the present case, however, as has\n been mentioned above, there has been an inordinate and\n unexplained delay of 19 years, an amount of time which cannot\n be fathomed, within the ambit of 'reasonable time'.”\n In the present cases on hand, it can be seen that the petitioner in\n\n W.P.No.24381 of 2025 has entered government service in the 1984 and\n\n retired on 30.06.2021, after rendering 37 years of service. Likewise, the\n\n petitioner in W.P.No.24387 of 2025 has entered government service in the\n\n 1981 and retired on 31.12.2018, also after rendering 37 years of service. The\n\n inordinate delay on the part of the respondents in initiating any enquiry into\n\n the genuineness of the community certificates of the petitioners from the\n\n dates of their initial appointment until their respective dates of\n\n superannuation is highly unreasonable and cannot be justified under any\n\n acceptable standard of prompt administrative action.\n\n 13. In yet another case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\n __________\n\n Page No.15 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n SLP(C) No.24458/2019 dated 03.03.2023, was pleased to hold as under:\n\n “It is submitted that the respondent No.1 who served in\n the Railways has superannuated on 28.02.2022 and therefore,\n the exercise in this case would largely be academic on the\n aspect of whether she belonged to the claimed Scheduled Tribe\n category. Considering the above, we deem it is appropriate to\n order for closure of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Special\n leave Petition stands disposed of.”\n\n \n14. The decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case\n\n of \nKumari Madhuri Patil vs. Additional Commissioner\n, reported in 1995\n\n AIR 94 weighs much importance in the cases on hand, had elaborately dealt\n\n with the issue of community certificate and observed that as per \nArticle\n\n 15(4)\n of the Constitution of India, it is for the State to make special\n\n provisions for advancement of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\n \nFurther, it was observed that in the light of \nArticle 16(1)\n, equality of\n\n opportunity to all citizens in matters of appointments to an office or a post\n\n under the Union or a State Government or public undertakings etc., should\n\n be ensured. For that purpose, \nArticle 16(4)\n empowers the State to make\n\n provisions for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of classes of\n\n citizens not adequately represented in the services under the State. The\n\n __________\n\n Page No.16 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court, in \nthe said judgment\n while issuing certain\n\n guidelines, insisted that the community certificate in respect of SC/ST\n\n should be scrutinised at the earliest. For the sake of convenience, relevant\n\n paragraphs of the judgment are reproduced below:\n\n “It is, therefore, necessary that the certificates issued are\n scrutinised at the earliest and with utmost expedition and\n promptitude. For that purpose, it is necessary to streamline the\n procedure for the issuance of social status certificates, their\n scrutiny and their approval, which may be the following:\n\n 1. The application for grant of social status\n certificate shall be made to the Revenue Sub-\n\n Divisional Officer and Deputy Collector or Deputy\n Commissioner and the certificate shall be issued by\n such officer rather than at the Officer, Taluk or\n Mandal level.\n\n 2. The parent, guardian or the candidate, as the\n case may be, shall file an affidavit duly sworn and\n attested by a competent gazetted officer or non-\n gazetted officer with particulars of castes and sub-\n castes, tribe, tribal community, parts or groups of\n tribes or tribal communities, the place from which he\n originally hails from and other particulars as may be\n prescribed by the Directorate concerned.\n\n 3. Application for verification of the caste\n certificate by the Scrutiny Committee shall be filed at\n least six months in advance before seeking admission\n into educational institution or an appointment to a\n post.\n\n 4.

Each Directorate should constitute a vigilance cell\n consisting of Senior Deputy Superintendent of Police in over-\n all charge and such number of Police Inspectors to investigate\n into the social status claims. The Inspector would go to the\n local place of residence and original place from which the\n candidate hails and usually resides or in case of migration to\n the town or city, the place from which he originally hailed\n from. The vigilance officer should personally verify and collect\n all the facts of the social status claimed by the candidate or the\n parent or guardian, as the case may be. He should also examine\n the school records, birth registration, if any. He should also\n examine the parent, guardian or the candidate in relation to\n their caste etc. or such other persons who have knowledge of\n the social status of the candidate and then submit a report to the\n Directorate together with all particulars as envisaged in the pro\n forma, in particular, of the Scheduled Tribes relating to their\n peculiar anthropological and ethnological traits, deity, rituals,\n customs, mode of marriage, death ceremonies, method of burial\n of dead bodies etc. by the castes or tribes or tribal communities\n concerned etc.\n\n 6. The Director concerned, on receipt of the report from\n the vigilance officer if he found the claim for social status to be\n \"not genuine\" or 'doubtful' or spurious or falsely or wrongly\n claimed, the Director concerned should issue show-cause\n notice supplying a copy of the report of the vigilance officer to\n\n __________\n\n Page No.18 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n the candidate by a registered post with acknowledgement due\n or through the head of the educational institution concerned in\n which the candidate is studying or employed. The notice should\n indicate that the representation or reply, if any, would be made\n within two weeks from the date of the receipt of the notice and\n in no case on request not more than 30 days from the date of\n the receipt of the notice.”\n\n 15. Keeping in mind the above judgment of the Apex Court, an Office\n\n Memorandum was issued on 24.12.2020 by the Joint Secretary, Lok Sabha\n\n Secretariat. The relevant portions of the Office Memorandum are extracted\n\n hereunder:\n\n \n“...It is pertinent to mention that the\n Departments/Banks/PSUs have not adhered to the above\n mentioned guidelines of DoP&T and CVC and also it is not in\n conformity with the Hon'ble Supreme Court judgment\n delivered vide \nKumari Madhuri Patil Vs. Addl\n. Commissioner\n in 1995 AIR 94, 1994 SSC (6) 241 Order dated 02.09.1994\n since this judgment can only be implemented in prospective.\n\n 2. Here, it is pertinent to bring to your notice DoP&T\n OM no.230/08/2005-AVD II dated 25.05.2005, which clearly\n states the following:-\n\n “Government has, therefore decided that a\n detailed verification of all such certificates produced\n before various appointing authorities since 1995 be\n carried. The CVOs are requested to initiate this task by\n collecting the details of all those who had been\n appointed in the Ministries/Departments or agencies\n including CPSUs with which they are concerned, since\n\n __________\n\n Page No.19 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n 1995 on the strength of ST certificates.\n\n 2. Keeping in view the above mentioned facts, it is\n requested that the concerned State Level Scrutiny Committee\n be directed to verify the ST caste certificates of only those\n employees who were appointed after the year 1995 and the\n process of verification should be completed within two\n months. The Action Taken Report in this regard may be please\n be forwarded to this Secretariat at the earliest but not later than\n 18.02.2021 so that the same may be placed before the\n Committee.”\n\n 16. The above referred Office Memorandum makes it very clear that\n\n community certificates of employees, who were inducted into Government\n\n Service after 1995 can alone be subjected for scrutiny / verification. To be\n\n more precise, it is incumbent on the employers / authorities to conduct\n\n verifications ideally at the time of an employee's entry into service, so as to\n\n ensure the accuracy and integrity of personnel records.\n\n 17. In furtherance thereof, the Government of India, Ministry of\n\n Personnel, PG & Pensions, Department of Personnel and Training issued\n\n instructions dated 21.10.2022 to all State / UT Governments, insisting upon\n\n the need for timely verification of Caste / Community certificates, indicating\n\n as follows:\n\n \n__________\n\n Page No.20 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n “3. In this regard, it is reiterated that the responsibility\n for the issue and verification of Caste Certificate lies with the\n concerned State / UT Government. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court, vide its order dated 02.09.1994 in the matter of \nKumari\n Madhuri Patil vs. Addl\n. Commissioner, has laid down the\n detailed guidelines for effective verification of the Caste\n Certificates of the employees by the State Government, so that\n no person, on the basis of fake caste certificate, may secure\n employment wrongfully in the Government.”\n\n 18. On a reading of the aforesaid instructions, it is apparent that the\n\n Government of India is very keen in curbing the wrongful entry of an\n\n employee in the Government Service based on the fake community\n\n certificate and issued instructions to all State / UT Governments for\n\n verification of the community certificates at the earliest point of time.\n\n 19. In an another Office Memorandum dated 30.11.2021, issued by\n\n the Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, PG & Pensions,\n\n Department of Pension & Pensioner's Welfare strictly instructed concerned\n\n Departments that unless departmental or judicial proceedings are pending\n\n against a retired employee, the pensionary / retirement benefits due to the\n\n retiring employee should not be withheld or delay on the ground of\n\n pendency of verification of caste certificate.\n\n __________\n\n Page No.21 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n 20. Learned counsel for the petitioners drew our attention to the\n\n Government Order dated 15.10.2012 issued by the Government of Tamil\n\n Nadu, constituting a District Level Vigilance Committee and State Level\n\n Scrutiny Committee to verify the genuineness of the community certificates.\n\n Vigilance Cells at Chennai, Salem, Trichy and Madurai were also formed to\n\n verify the community status and submit a report to the Committee. In the\n\n Government Order, the functions of the Vigilance Cells have been\n\n enumerated and a time frame has also been fixed for completion of enquiry,\n\n which reads as follows:\n\n “vii) The inquiry should be completed as expeditiously\n as possible preferably by day to day proceedings within such\n period not exceeding two months. If after inquiry, the\n competent committee finds the claim to be false or spurious,\n they should pass an order cancelling the certificate issued and\n confiscate the same. It should communicate within one month\n from the date of the conclusion of the proceedings the result of\n enquiry to the parent / guardian and the applicant.”\n\n 21. In the light of various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\n and also the guidelines / instructions / GO issued by both Government of\n\n India and State Government, from time to time, we are of the view that the\n\n __________\n\n Page No.22 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n respondents cannot keep the matter pending for months / years together in\n\n the garb of verification of community certificates, especially when there is a\n\n specific time frame fixed for completion of such verification.\n\n 22. In the present cases, the petitioners have entered Government\n\n service and subsequently, got retired, after rendering nearly 37 years of\n\n service. Therefore, the verification of the community certificates at this\n\n belated stage will be a futile exercise and is not in consonance with the\n\n various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the guidelines issued\n\n by the Government. Hence, we have no other option, but to set aside the\n\n impugned proceedings.\n\n 23. Learned counsel for the petitioners would state that the petitioners,\n\n at this age are finding difficult to appear for enquiry before the officials and\n\n therefore, the petitioners would state that they are willing to surrender their\n\n community certificates and they will not claim concessions to their children\n\n on the basis of their community certificate, which is given solely to avoid\n\n further harassment at the hands of the respondents under the pretext of\n\n __________\n\n Page No.23 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n verification proceedings initiated after superannuation.\n\n 24. It is relevant to extract the relevant paragraphs of the affidavits of\n\n undertaking dated 30.06.2025 submitted by the petitioners, which read as\n\n follows:\n\n W.P.No.24381 of 2025:\n\n \"2) 1 submit that I belong to the Konda reddis\n community (ST) Based on the community certificate in the\n year 1972 issued in my favour, I was appointed in the\n Vijaya Bank in the year 1984. 1 reached superannuation\n after completing 37 years of service on 30.06.2021.

Once a government servant has retired and completed all service\n\n verifications during his tenure, reopening of the community certificate issue\n\n amounts to re-litigation. It is pertinent to note that the employer accepted the\n\n community certificates at the time of appointment of the petitioners and did\n\n not raise any issue during the long years of service of the petitioners. A\n\n retired employee has a legitimate expectation that benefits earned during\n\n service will not be taken away arbitrarily after retirement. When a\n\n community certificate is issued and accepted for decades, and no concerns\n\n are raised, then there is a presumption that such certificates are valid and the\n\n information contained within it are accurate. Post-retirement verification of a\n\n community certificate is inherently burdensome, as it involves practical\n\n difficulties such as loss of records, fading memories, and changed\n\n circumstances, making it unjustly onerous for the individual to establish the\n\n certificate’s authenticity.\n\n __________\n\n Page No.26 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n 26.

The points for consideration of legal issues arises in these\n\n petitions are:\n\n 1.Whether the verification of community status of Government\n\n employee can be continued even after the retirement of employee and\n whether an enquiry as to the genuineness of Community Certificate\n would be purely academic?\n\n 2.Whether a time limit should be prescribed for initiating\n\n __________\n\n Page No.40 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n proceedings for verification of community status or communicate\n certificate of an employee?\n\n 12. It is to be noted that the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court\n\n has already been dealt with the above legal issues in W.P.No.9995 of 2021\n\n & 12700 of 2022 and passed an order dated 12.04.2024. The relevant\n\n paragraphs are extracted hereunder:\n\n ''9.While hearing the lengthy arguments of not only\n the learned counsels appearing for the petitioners in these three\n cases, but also several other counsels who have raised same legal\n issues in the writ petitions, the learned counsel appearing for the\n employers in all these three cases, and Mr.P.Kumaresan, learned\n Additional Advocate General, appearing for the official\n respondents, this Court was requested to consider the following\n legal issues :\n\n (A)Whether the verification of community status of\n Government employee can be continued even after the retirement\n of employee and whether an enquiry as to the genuineness of\n Community Certificate would be purely academic as observed by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India and another v.\n\n S.Renuka and others [SLP (C) No.24458/2019 dated\n 03.03.2023] ?\n\n (B)Whether the verification of Community Certificate or\n community status of any individual who secured employment\n\n __________\n\n Page No.41 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n under SC or ST quota before 1995, can be permitted/directed ?\n\n (C)Whether a time limit should be prescribed for initiating\n proceedings for verification of community status or Community\n Certificate of an employee ?\n\n (D)Whether terminal benefits of employees can be\n withheld on account of pendency of proceedings for verification\n as to the genuineness of Community Certificate or community\n status of an employee who secure employment under SC or ST\n quota ?\n\n \nIssue No.(A): Whether the verification of community\n status of Government employee can be continued even after the\n retirement of employee and whether an enquiry as to the\n genuineness of Community Certificate would be purely\n academic as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nUnion\n of India and another v. S.Renuka and others\n [SLP (C)\n No.24458/2019 dated 03.03.2023] ?\n\n \n20.Therefore, we are unable to follow the three\n judgments relied upon by the learned counsels appearing for the\n petitioners, viz., \nUnion of India and another v. S.Renuka and\n others\n [SLP (C) No.24458/2019 dated 03.03.2023],\n V.Vallinayagam v. The Chairman, State Level Scrutiny\n Committee-II, Secretariat, Chennai [W.P.No.27823 of 2023,\n dated 25.09.2023] and V.Shanmugaraj v. The Chairman, State\n Level Scrutiny Committee-II, Secretariat, Chennai\n [W.P.No.29976 of 2023, dated 03.11.2023], in view of the\n categorical pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n judgments above referred to, on principles. Ratio of judgment\n\n __________\n\n Page No.42 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n alone is binding. It is only the reason assigned in the ratio\n decidendi of a judgment.\n \nThe judgment of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in \nS.Renuka\n's case without considering the spirit of\n several judgments including larger Bench of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court, need not be followed.\n \nTherefore, we have no hesitation to\n hold that those three judgments may not be binding precedents as\n they were rendered without noticing the binding precedents on\n principles reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of\n \nKumari Madhuri Patil, R.Vishwanatha Pillai, and Food\n Corporation of India\n (supra). Verification once started shall\n continue till its logical end and retirement of an employee during\n enquiry as to his community status does not affect the\n proceedings.\n\n Issue No.(B): Whether the verification of Community\n Certificate or community status of any individual who secured\n employment under SC or ST quota before 1995, can be\n permitted/directed ?\n\n 32.When the Hon'ble Supreme Court has rendered a\n judgment which is reiterated in several judgments of the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court, there cannot be an Office Memorandum which\n would whittle down the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n which is binding as a law declared in terms of \nArticle 141\n of the\n Constitution. When the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is\n binding not only as a precedent, but as a law declared, there\n cannot be an official instruction on the interpretation of the\n judgment so as to limit its operation. This is the mischief that was\n\n __________\n\n Page No.43 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n done by way of the Office Memorandum dated 24.12.2020.\n\n 33.Therefore, this Court is unable to agree with the\n submission of the learned counsels appearing for the petitioners\n that there cannot be verification of Community Certificates which\n were obtained prior to 1995. Equally, merely because\n appointment was before 1995, it cannot be said that verification\n in those cases cannot be done, as rightly pointed out by Hon'ble\n Mrs. Justice N.Mala while expressing dissenting view that this\n Court cannot declare or legitimise fraud committed by a person\n merely because he obtained the false certificate or got\n employment based on a false claim before 1995. It is settled that\n fraud vitiates every solemn transaction and there cannot be a\n legal sanction to condone fraud if it is committed before 1995.\n Therefore, irrespective of date of Community Certificate or date\n of appointment before or after 1995, verification as to the\n genuineness of Community Certificate or claim as to one's\n community status shall continue to its logical end.\n\n Issue No.(C): Whether a time limit should be prescribed\n for initiating proceedings for verification of community status\n or Community Certificate of an employee ?\n\n \n37.As it was pointed out by the Constitution Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nState of Maharashtra v. Milind\n\n reported in (2001) 1 SCC 4, which is clarified by later judgments,\n no person can take advantage of the Scheduled Tribes Order for\n any other purpose, merely because he has been shown indulgence\n to complete his course or has secured an appointment by\n\n __________\n\n Page No.44 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n producing false certificate. Mere delay in making a reference\n does not invalidate the order on scrutiny by competent authority.\n Since we have held that verification can continue even after\n retirement of an employee, this Court finds no logic to accept the\n arguments of learned counsels appearing for the petitioners that\n there must be time limit or limitation to be prescribed.\n\n Issue No.(D): Whether terminal benefits of employees\n can be withheld on account of pendency of proceedings for\n verification as to the genuineness of Community Certificate or\n community status of an employee who secure employment\n under SC or ST quota ?\n\n 38.This Court, in several cases, finds that the delay is\n caused mainly due to the recalcitrant and non-cooperative\n attitude of the employees who refuse to cooperate with the\n enquiry under some pretext or the other. Despite the Government\n spending huge money for establishing a machinery to verify the\n genuineness of the certificates or the claims as to one's\n community status, the manner in which the employees adopt\n delaying tactics, precludes us from holding that the employee\n should be given benefit of his employment or terminal benefits\n even during the pendency of verification of community status.\n\n 39.In a case where the verification was initiated just\n before retirement on the basis of a stale claim or a complaint\n without any verifiable material, the terminal benefits of an\n employee cannot be withheld merely because the enquiry has\n been commenced. In all other cases, where delay is attributable to\n\n __________\n\n Page No.45 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n the conduct of employee, there must be some protection to the\n employer in the matter of disbursement of retirement benefits.\n Depending upon the individual cases, this Court can direct\n provisional pension to be disbursed to the employee subject to the\n outcome of verification process either by State Level Scrutiny\n Committee or by the District Level Vigilance Committee. Once a\n person is retired, the verification process cannot be delayed\n beyond three months. If the employee seeks unnecessary\n adjournment or refuses to appear for an enquiry, he need not be\n given provisional pension or retirement benefits without giving\n him a clean chit as to the genuineness of his claim.''\n\n 13. It is apposite to mention that with regard to the legal issues as\n\n to whether the Office Memorandum dated 24.12.2020 prohibits the scrutiny\n\n of caste certificate issued prior to 1995 and there can be any limitation for\n\n reviewing the act of fraud on constitution, the Hon'ble Division Bench of\n\n this Court in W.P.No.4484 of 2021 vide order dated 24.08.2023, has\n\n delivered a split verdict. In view of the same, the case was placed before the\n\n learned third Judge to decide the legal issues. The learned third Judge vide\n\n order dated 16.11.2023, had formulated the following points for\n\n consideration:\n\n ''(i) Whether the O.M., dated 24.12.2020 prohibits\n\n __________\n\n Page No.46 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n scrutiny of caste certificate issued prior to 1995?\n\n \n(ii) Whether the observation in the said O.M., that the\n decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nKumari Madhuri\n Patel Vs. Additional Commissioner\n can be implemented only\n prospectively is legally sustainable?\n\n (iii) Can there be any limitation for reviewing act of\n fraud on constitution?''\n\n 14. The relevant paragraphs of the aforesaid order, in which\n\n answers to the above questions are given, are extracted hereunder:\n\n ''35. In the light of the above discussion and\n reasoning, the questions framed for consideration are\n answered as below:-\n\n (i) Whether the O.M., dated 24.12.2020 prohibits\n scrutiny of caste certificate issued prior to 1995?\n\n NO. The observations made in the said OM is\n misconception of the earlier OM dated 25/05/2005 and the\n CVC circular is general in nature. There can be no\n executive order prohibiting enquiry of fake or false caste\n certificate which is not only a misconduct in the parlance of\n service jurisprudence but a crime under penal law.\n\n (ii) Whether the observation in the said O.M., that\n the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kumari\n\n __________\n\n Page No.47 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n Madhuri Patel Vs. Additional Commissioner can be\n implemented only prospectively is legally sustainable?\n\n No. Any interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment\n contrary to the spirit of the judgment is non est in law as per\n the decision of the constitutional Bench of the Supreme\n Court in its judgement rendered in Commissioner of Central\n Exercise -vs- Rathan Melting and wire Industries ( 2008\n (13) SCC 1).\n\n (iii) Can there be any limitation for reviewing act of\n fraud on constitution? Fraud vitiates every solemn Act. By\n executive orders limitation cannot be prescribed by acts of\n fraud committed against constitution and laws. The\n petitioner herein whose birth register entry made in the year\n 1958 show he belong to Hindu Man Ottan community. He\n had obtained community certificate from Tahsildar, Attur at\n Salem District as if he belongs to Kattunaiyakan community\n which is a Schedule Tribe. His ST certificate cancelled by\n the District Collector after enquiry as early as 1992 (i.e)\n even before Maduri Patil judgment. However the petitioner\n was able to manover, by filing writ petitions in sequences.\n He had not cooperated for enquiry conducted by State Level\n Scrutiny Committee. Enquiry by a senior police officer of\n the rank of DSP attached to the special vigilance cell for\n SC/ST had unravelled several truth about the dishonest act\n of the petitioner which independently requires prosecution\n apart from confiscation of his false community certificate\n\n __________\n\n Page No.48 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n besides departmental proceedings.\n\n 36. As a result, the judgement of the Hon'ble Mrs.\n Justice N.Mala is confirmed. The Writ Petition stands\n dismissed.\n\n 37. Since the petitioner has prevented the valuable\n right of public office of a Schedule Tribe Member, it is open\n to the State to take necessary penal action against the\n petitioner for offences under \nIPC\n and also under \nSection 3\n (1)\nza (E) of SC /ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The\n second respondent/Employer is permitted to proceed\n against the petitioner for necessary action for recovery in\n accordance with law. No costs. Consequently, connected\n Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.''\n\n 15. Feeling aggrieved by the above order dated 16.11.2023 in\n\n W.P.No.4484 of 2021, the writ petitioner therein has preferred the Special\n\n Leave Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP. (CIVIL) Diary\n\n No. 50747/2023, in which, the Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated\n\n 15.12.2023, has passed the following order:\n\n ''Delay condoned.\n\n Issue notice to the respondents, returnable in six\n weeks.

It is pertinent to mention that with regard to the issuance of\n\n community certificate based of the community certificate already issued to\n\n the parents and relatives has already been dealt with by the Hon'ble Division\n\n Bench of this Court in W.P.No.11336 of 2019 vide order dated 22.04.2019.\n\n Aggrieved over the same, the State has also preferred an appeal before the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.27890 of\n\n 2019 .\n\n __________\n\n Page No.50 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n 18. It is most relevant to cite that the Hon'ble Division Bench of\n\n this Court in W.P.No.11336 of 2019 vide order dated 22.04.2019 had issued\n\n direction to provide community certificate based on the father's and\n\n relatives' community certificates to the writ petitioner's minor son therein\n\n (Hindu Konda Reddis (ST) Community). The relevant portion of the said\n\n order is extracted hereunder:\n\n ''2. It is the case of the petitioner that her family belongs to\n Konda Reddis Community, which is classified as a Scheduled Tribe\n Community. The petitioner was issued with Community Certificate\n on 30.06.1986 by the Tahsildar, Mettur Dam. The petitioner's own\n brother B.Vinothkumar was also issued with a Community\n Certificate in the year 1989 by the Tahsildar. All of them, including\n the petitioner, had been described as belonging to the Konda Reddis\n Community in their educational and land records. It is also stated\n that the petitioner's close relatives possess Community Certificates\n describing them as belonging to Konda Reddis Community.\n\n 3. On 20.10.2016, the petitioner applied to the respondent for\n issuance of Community Certificate for her minor child, viz.,\n S.P.Yesvanth, by enclosing necessary documents including\n Community Certificates of herself, her sister, her brother and other\n close relatives. By the impugned order dated 23.03.2018, the\n petitioner's application stated above, was rejected.

When the Writ Petition is taken up for hearing, the learned\n counsel for the petitioner made his submissions adverting to the\n averments made in the affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition.\n\n 5. This Court also heard the submissions of the learned\n Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondent on the\n above aspects.\n\n 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that by the\n impugned order, a common order has been passed in respect of\n several individuals who applied along with the petitioner by\n assigning stereo-typed reasons and the respondent has summarily\n rejected the petitioner's request. However, learned counsel for the\n petitioner submitted that the respondent/RDO has made discreet\n enquiry behind the back of the petitioner and placed reliance on such\n materials. Learned counsel for the petitioner further stated that the\n impugned order was passed by the RDO, Sankagiri, who was holding\n the additional charge of the post of RDO, Mettur Dam.\n\n 7. Be that as it may. As on date, the Community Certificates\n issued to the petitioner, her sister, her brother and also of her close\n relatives, were not cancelled and when they were not cancelled,\n there cannot be any impediment in issuing the Community\n Certificate to the petitioner's son.

It appears that thousands of such certificates have\n been issued certifying people to be members of the Hindu Konda\n Reddis Community falling within Scheduled Tribe.\n\n 8. It is a different thing to say whether RDO could have\n inquired into the genuineness of the claim or not. We do not propose\n to get into this controversy for the present.\n\n 9. However, we would like to ensure whether these\n certificates are genuine or not. We would also like to know in what\n manner such caste certificates have been procured by thousands of\n people in the area.\n\n 10. For the present, we do not level any allegations but\n prima facie it appears to be a huge racket. This is something\n extremely dangerous.\n\n 11. In such circumstances, we propose to pass an interim\n order today.\n\n 12. We are conscious of the fact that the State has been able\n to obtain an interim order by which the operation of the impugned\n judgment has been stayed. However, we modify the order to the\n extent that let the State Level Scrutiny Committee undertake an\n\n __________\n\n Page No.55 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n extensive inquiry into this issue at the earliest and file its report\n before us to enable us to proceed further in the matter.

The facts of\n\n that case are that the petitioner therein was issued with the community\n\n certificate by the Tahsildar, Mettur, on 14.09.1978, based on which, he was\n\n appointed as Time Scale Clerk in the Department of Telecommunication on\n\n 07.09.1979 and he was terminated from service vide order dated 01.06.1984\n\n on the basis of the letter of the Collector and thereafter, the petitioner therein\n\n challenged the same before this Court and the same was transferred to the\n\n Central Administrative Tribunal in T.A.No.6 of 1992, which was allowed on\n\n 16.03.1994. When the District Level Vigilance Committee attempted to\n\n verify the petitioner's community certificate, he had challenged the same in\n\n W.P.No.6404 of 2004 on the ground that the District Level Vigilance\n\n Committee did not have jurisdiction to verify the community certificate. The\n\n said writ petition came to be allowed stating that the competent authority\n\n was the State Level Scrutiny Committee. Meanwhile, the petitioner therein\n\n superannuated from service on 30.11.2014.

In the instant case on hand, after retiring from their\n\n service, the second respondent has issued summons for appearance of the\n\n petitioners to conduct enquiry with regard to the genuineness of their\n\n community certificates. The facts of the present case is entirely different\n\n from the facts of the case involved in the aforesaid writ petition in\n\n W.P.No.31452 of 2022.\n\n 23. It is to be noted that the State Government of Tamil Nadu has\n\n constituted the District Level Vigilance Committee and State Level Scrutiny\n\n Committee and also issued guidelines to verify the genuineness of the\n\n community certificate issued to the persons belonging to the SC & ST vide\n\n Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.106 dated 15.10.2012 (Adi Dravidar and\n\n Tribal Welfare (CV- I) Department), the relevant portion of which, reads as\n\n follows:\n\n \n“In order to protect the welfare of the genuine Scheduled\n Castes/Scheduled Tribes people from the false claimants, the\n Government have been examining the matter to frame suitable\n guidelines based on the guidelines issued by Supreme Court of India\n\n __________\n\n Page No.59 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\n\f W.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n in \nMadhuri Patil and another Vs Additional Commissioner, Tribal\n Development and others\n to suit the conditions prevailing in Tamil\n Nadu, so that they could work out in a systematic manner without\n facing any difficulty in its implementation.

However, as per the Supreme Court direction, the\n Vigilance Cells have not been constituted to verify the community\n status of the persons belonging to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\n Tribes and to submit its report to the District Level Vigilance\n Committee/State Level Scrutiny Committee. Hence the District Level\n Vigilance Committees/State Level Scrutiny Committee utilizes the\n services of the Revenue Officials such as Tahsildars/Revenue\n Divisional Officers for making spot enquiry about the individual’s\n Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes community status going to their\n place and submits the reports to the competent Committee.\n\n 3.
