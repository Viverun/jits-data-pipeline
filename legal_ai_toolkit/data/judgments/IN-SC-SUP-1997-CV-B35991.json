But as Deputy Superintendents,\nRespondent Nos. 1 and 2 were promoted respectively on May\n26, 1982 and October 27 1983, while the appellants were\npromoted on different dates, viz., October 27, 1987, January\n16, 1989 and February 2, 1996. Sixth respondent, Sant Lal\nwas promoted on November 4, 1987, that is, prior to the\npromotion of Surinderjit Kapil. Equally, respondent No.7\nAjmer Singh also was promoted earlier to Ram Dayal and\nSurinderjit Kapil on October 31, 1988. While working as\nDeputy Superintendent, Ram Asra was promoted to the post of\nSuperintendent on September 4, 1987; H.S. Hira was promoted\nas Superintendent on May 27, 1988 while the first appellant,\nJagdish Lal was promoted on April 1, 1990 and Ram Dayal,\nappellant No.2 was promoted on August 9, 1991; Sant Lal,\nrespondent No.6 was promoted on February 8, 1990, that is,\nprior to the promotion of Jagdish Lal as Superintendent.\nEqually, Ajmer Singh, 7th respondent was promoted as\nSuperintendent on July 1, 1990, that is, prior to the\npromotion of second appellant, Ram Dayal on August 9 1991.\nWhile all of them were working as Superintendents, H.S. Hira\nwas further promoted on ad hoc basis w.e.f. February 2,\n1996 for a period of 4 months and from May 31, 1996 on\nregular basis, in his own right, as Registrar (Education)\nwhich post is now classified as Class I post. On June 4,\n1996, the appellants filed a writ petition claiming that\nright from the post of Clerk upto the post of\nSuperintendent, the Class III Service of the Education\nDepartment, they were senior to the reserved candidates.\nThough they were promoted on the basis of rule of\nreservation applying the 100 point roster maintained by the\nGovernment, they stole a march over the appellants who were\nbeing members of the same Class III Service. They further\nclaimed that though the reserved candidates has got\npromotion to the different posts earlier to them, the\nappellants still were entitled to be senior to them for the\npurpose of promotion to Class I posts. As a consequence,\nthey were entitled to be considered for promotion before\nconsideration of the reserved candidates including H.S.\nHira, the fifth respondent as Registrar (Education). The\nsheet anchor of their case was the decision of this Court in\nAjit Singh Januja & Ors. v. State of Punjab [JT 1996(2) SC\n727]. The High Court dismissed the writ petition inter alia\non the ground of abnormal delay in challenging the promotion\nof the reserved candidate to the post of Asstt./Dy.\nSuperintendents and Superintendents. It observed that though\nthe reserved candidates were promoted on different dates as\nSuperintendents etc. earlier to the appellants, they having\nbecome members of the Service in the lower cadres earlier to\nthe appellant, were entitled to be considered for further\npromotion to the higher ladders of the Service; their\npromotions are not vitiated by an error of law. The Haryana\nEduction Deptt. (State Service Class II) are governed by the\nHaryana Education Deptt. (State Service Group B) Rules, 1980\n(For short, the `Rules') Rule 11 of the Rules deals with\nseniority. By operation thereof the reserved candidates\nbecame senior to the appellants in the respective cadres.\nFifth respondent, H.S. Hira was promoted to Group `B' Class-\nI Service in his own right as a general candidate as there\nwas no reservation. Therefore, their promotion is valid in\nlaw. It was also held that even otherwise, since the\npromotions of the reserved candidates came to be made prior\nto the decision in Sabharwal's case, they could not be\ndeclared invalid. The High Court has pointed out that \"Here\nit is important to mention that as on the date of promotion\nof respondent No.4 on the post of Superintendent, the\npetitioners has not been promoted even as Deputy\nSuperintendents. Similarly, as on the date of promotion of\nrespondent Nos. 4 and 5 , the petitioner No.2 has not been\npromoted as Deputy Superintendent and so far as petitioner\nNo.3 is concerned, he came to be promoted as Deputy\nSuperintended after almost 8 years and 6 months of the\npromotion of respondent No.4; after 7 years and 9 months of\nthe promotion of respondent No.5; and after almost 4 and 5\nyears and 6 months of the promotion of respondent Nos.6 and\n7 as Superintendents. Thus the petitioners cannot have any\nclaim to be assigned seniority over and above respondent\nNos. 4 to 7 as Superintendents.\" The High Court negatived\nthe contention that the appellants were denied of right to\nequality on account of the application of rule of\nreservation and roster point violating\nArticles 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution. The High Court further pointed out thus:\n\n\"A careful reading of the various\ndecisions of the Apex Court and the\ndecision of this Court, shows that\nin R.K. Sabharwal's case, their\nLordships were primarily concerned\nwith the interpretation of the\npolicy circulars issued by the\nGovernment of Punjab regarding\nreservation in favour of the\nScheduled Castes and Backward\nClasses and operation of the roster\nsystem. In Court was dealing with\ncirculars issued by the Railway\nBoard with particular reference to\nthe letter dated 31st Aug., 1982\nand held that the word \"Panel\" used\nin that circular meant the panel\nprepared by the recruiting\nauthority at the time of initial\nentry in the service and that the\nseniority of the employees in the\nhigher grades must also be\ndetermined with reference to their\npanel position. This very principle\nhas been reiterated in Ajit Singh's\ncase in which circular issued by\nthe Government of Punjab and the\njudgment of the Full Bench case in\nJaswant Singh's case (supra) came\nup for consideration. The Division\nBench which decided Madan Lal's\ncase simply applied the\nobservations made in the three\ndecisions of the Supreme Court and\nheld that reserved categories\nemployees have no right to be\nassigned seniority on the promoted\nposts over and above the general\ncategory employees who were senior\nin the lower cadre and who got\npromotion in the next higher post\non a later date. However, in Akhil\nBhartiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh's\ncase (supra) their Lordships\nclarified that the principle laid\ndown in R.K. Sabharwal's case and\nVirpal Singh Chauhan's case (supra)\nwill operate prospectively and not\nretrospectively.\n\nIn our opinion, none of these\ndecisions is of any help for\ninterpreting rules relating to\nseniority which have been extracted\nabove. In none of the decisions,\ntheir Lordships of the Supreme\nCourt interpreted a rule like the\none which is under consideration\nbefore us. No doubt in Madan Lal's\ncase a similar rules has been\nreferred to but instead of\ninterpreting that rules the\nDivision Bench has limited its\nconsiderations made by the Supreme\nCourt in Ajit Singh's case (supra).\nWe are of the opinion that in\nview of the clear language used in\nthe substantive part of Rule 11 and\nits first proviso, seniority will\nhave to be determined in different\ncadres and categories of posts\nbecause the services governed by\nthe Rules of 1974 and 1980 consist\nof different cadres. Posts of\nRegistrar, Assistant Registrar\n(Examinations), Budget Officer and\nSuperintendents constitute\ndifferent cadres and, therefore,\nseniority will have to be\ndetermined in each cadre\nseparately. Similarly, the post of\nDeputy Superintendents, Assistants\nand Clerks, recruitment to which is\ngoverned by `1974 Rules' constitute\ndifferent cadres and seniority will\nhave to be determined separately in\neach of these cadres and the\ngeneral principle laid down in Ajit\nSingh's case cannot be applied for\nthe purpose of determination of\nseniority in a case like the\npresent one.\n\nOn the basis of above\ndiscussion, we hold that:-\n\n(i) the writ petition deserves to\nbe dismissed on the ground of delay\nand laches in so far as challenge\nto the promotion of the\nrespondents as\nSuperintendents/Registrar is\nconcerned;\n\n(ii) the principles laid down in\nVirpal Singh Chauhan's case (supra)\nand Ajit Singh's case (supra) will\noperate prospectively and will not\naffect promotions of reserved\ncategory candidates which were made\nprior to the decision in R.K.\nSabharwal's case (supra) or Virpal\nSingh Chauhan's case (supra);\n\n(iii) the decision in Virpal Singh\nChauhan's case and Ajit Singh's\ncase cannot be applied in a case\nlike the present one where the\nseniority is required to be\ndetermined in different cadres and\ncategories of posts. In the absence\nof any challenge to the vires of\nRule 11 the petitioners cannot\nclaim fixation of their seniority\n\nabove the Respondent Nos. 4 to 7\n\nwho were promoted as Deputy\nSuperintendents earlier than the\npetitioner.\"\n\nShri Rohtagi, learned counsel for the appellant,\ncontended that in all the posts/grades starting from that of\nClerk to Superintendents in Class III Service and the posts\nof Budget Officer, Assistant Registrar and Registrar in\nGroup `B' Class I Service by operation of ratio of Ajit\nSingh's case and Union of India v. Vir Pal Singh Chauhan\n[(1995) 6 SCC 684], seniority is required to be determined\nkeeping the seniority of the general and reserved candidates\nin the lower grade/cadre in fact as all the posts are of the\nsame Service. As soon as the general candidates get promoted\nto the higher cadre, the inter se seniority of the general\ncandidates and the reserved candidates is required to be\nredetermined on the basis of their inter se seniority in the\nfeeder grade/cadre. That was the view taken by this Court in\nVeer Pal Singh Chauhan case. Even though the reserved\ncandidates were promoted earlier to the general candidates,\nthe inter se merit between the general candidates and the\nreserved candidates in Group `B' Class I Service should be\nredetermined. The promotion is required to be given to Class\nI Service on that basis. Promotion at various levels in\nClass II Service is also, accordingly, required to be given\nand the seniority determined. As soon as the general\ncandidates get promoted, even though later to the reserved\ncandidates, they have right to have their seniority\nrestored. As a consequence, the general candidates are\neligible to be considered for promotion in higher posts\nbefore consideration of the reserved candidates since for\nthe first time the inter se rights are being considered in\nClass-I Group `B' Service. This interpretation in Chauhan's\ncase and Ajit Singh's case is consistent with the principle\nlaid down in\nArticles 14\nand\n16 (1)\nof the Constitution\ngranting equality of opportunity to both the general as well\nas the reserved candidates. The absence thereof would negate\nthe right to equality to general candidates violating\n\nArticle 14\nand\n16 (1)\nof the Constitution. The mere delay in\nfiling the writ petitions cannot made the base to deny the\nrelief to the general candidates. The right to equality\nbeing a constitutional mandate, as and when the right is\nrequired to be determined, the Court has to consider the\nfacts of each case and decide it on merits. The High Court,\ntherefore, is wrong in law. Shri Prem Malhotra, learned\ncounsel for the State, contended that whatever be the\nearlier legal position, after the judgment in Ajit Singh's\ncase, the Government re-examined the matter and issued\nproceedings restoring the seniority of the general candidate\nin their respective feeder post/cadres from which reserved\ncandidates came to be promoted. The direction, it is\ncontend, is consistent with and is in implementation of the\nlaw laid down by this Court. The High Court, therefore, is\nnot right in refusing to grant the relief to the appellants.\nShri K.S. Chauhan, learned counsel for the reserved\ncandidates, contended that under Rule 11 of the Haryana\nEducation Department Class III Service Rules, 1974 [for\nshort, the \"1974 Rules\"] and Rule 11 of the Rules provide\nfor determination of seniority of the employees in the said\nService. The Service as per 1974 Rules consists of various\ncadres, starting from Clerk to Superintendents in the Class\nIII Service. Under 1980 Rules, the Gazetted Cadre consist of\nBudget Officers, Assistant Registrar (Education) and\nRegistrar (Education) all of which constitute Class I\nService. Rule 11 of the respective Rules is a substantive\nrules creating right to seniority. The moment the officer is\nappointed to the service/cadre on putting probation, on\nsuccessful completion of the probation period and on being\nduly declared, they cease to be the members of the feeder\ncadre from which they came to be promoted, As and when the\nvacancies arise in the posts in the respective cadres as per\nthe roster point, the candidates, whether general or\nreserved, are required to be considered for promotion and\nduly promoted in accordance with the existing Rules. They\nbecame members of the service in the respective cadres of\nClass III or Group B Class I Service. The moment they\nstarted discharging the duties of the posts and on\ndeclaration of the successful and satisfactory probation\nperiod, they became fullfledged members of that Service.\nThey also ceased to be members of the feeding cadre.\nTherefore, the moment, the termination of probation was\ndeclared, they ceased to be members of the Service of the\nlower feeder cadres at various levels as cadre officers. The\nsubsequent promotions to the general candidates do not have\nthe effect of denying the seniority secured by the reserved\ncandidates due to their early promotion. Even if promotions\nto Group `B' Class I service are to be made without\napplying the rule of reservation, the reserved candidates\nhaving become senior to general candidates, are entitled to\nbe considered for promotion as per Rules in their own merit.\nAccordingly, the 5th respondent came to be promoted to the\npost of Registrar (Education) in his own right. The\nappellants have no right to claim seniority over the\nrespondent-reserved candidates. He also contended that\npromotion to the reserved candidates is as member of the\nDalits and Tribes as a Class. Constitutional right to\nequality enshrined under\nArticle 14\n, the genus, and\nArticle\n16 (1)\n, the species thereof, provide for protective\ndiscrimination in favour of the Dalit and Tribe. Appointment\nby promotion to a post or Service under the State is a\nconstitutional right given by\nArticle 16(1)\nor (4A) of the\nConstitution. Therefore, when the reserved candidates are\npromoted in accordance with the Rules, applying rules of\nreservation, and are promoted to posts as per the roster and\nare appointed to the posts reserved for reserved candidates\nas per the roster, no unconstitutionality result and it is\nnot discriminatory or arbitrary, violating\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution. He also contended that the reserved candidates\nwere promoted long prior the general candidates in Class III\nand Group B Class I Service. The writ petition came to be\nfiled after Ajit Singh's case. The High Court, therefore, is\nright in dismissing the writ petitions on the ground of\ndelay as well.\n\nIn view of the diverse contentions, the questions that\narise for consideration are: from what date seniority of\nreserved or general candidates should be determined? Whether\nthe accelerated promotions given to the reserved candidates\nto various cadres, applying the rule of reservation, will\nnot enure to them the seniority from the date of respective\npromotion? Conversely, whether on the promotions given to\nthe general candidates as per the roster point, the\npromotions will have the effect of giving them the seniority\nover the reserved candidates in the respective\nfeeder/promoted cadres? Whether the view taken by the High\nCourt is correct in law? In order to appreciate the\ncontention, it is necessary to refer to Rule 11 of the 1974\nRules and Rule 11 of the 1980 Rules. They read as under:\n\n\"1974 Rules : Rule 11 : The\nseniority, inter-se seniority of\nmembers of service shall be\ndetermined by the length of\ncontinuous service on a post in the\nservice;\n\nProvided that where there are\ndifferent Cadres of categories of\nthe post in service, the seniority\nwill be determined separately for\neach cadre or category of posts;\n\nProvided further that in the\ncase of members appointed by direct\nrecruitment, the order of merit\ndetermined by the commission shall\nnot be disturbed in fixing the\nseniority and candidates\nrecommended earlier shall be senior\nto the candidate recommended later;\nProvide further that in the\ncase of two or more members\nappointed on the same date, their\nseniority shall be determined as\nfollows:\n\n(a) a member appointed by direct\nrecruitment shall be senior to\na member appointed by\npromotion or by transfer;\n\n(b) a member appointed by\npromotion shall be senior to a\nmember appointed by transfer;\n\n(c) in the case of members\nappointed by promotion or by\ntransfer, seniority shall be\ndetermined according to the\nseniority of such members in\nthe appointments from which\nthey were promoted or\ntransferred; and\n\n(d) in the case members appointed\nby transfer from different\ncadres their seniority shall\nbe determined according to\npay, preference being given to\na member, who was drawing a\nhigher rate of pay in his\nprevious appointment and if\nthe rates of pay drawn are\nalso the same, then by the\nlength of their service in the\nappointments, and if the\nlength of such service is also\nthe same, the older member\nshall be senior to the younger\nmember.\n\n`1980 Rules' : Rules 11 : Seniority\nof members of the service : The\nseniority, inter se, of members of\nthe Service shall be determined by\nthe length of continuous service on\na post in the service;\n\nProvided that where there are\ndifferent cadres or categories of\nposts in the service, the seniority\nshall be determined separately for\neach cadre or category of posts;\n\nProvided further that in the\ncase of members appointed by direct\nrecruitment, the order of merit\ndetermined by the Commission shall\nnot be disturbed in fixing the\nseniority and candidates\nrecommended earlier shall be senior\nto the candidates recommended\nlater;\n\nProvided further that in the\ncase of two or more members\nappointed on the same date, their\nseniority shall be determined as\nfollows:\n\n(a) a member appointed by direct\nrecruitment shall be senior to\na member appointed by\npromotion or by transfer;\n\n(b) a member appointed by\npromotion shall be senior to a\nmember appointed by transfer;\n\n(c) in the case of members\nappointed by promotion or by\ntransfer, seniority shall be\ndetermined according to the\nseniority of such member in\nthe appointment from which\nthey were promoted or\ntransferred; and\n\n(d) in the case of members\nappointed by transfer from\ndifferent cadres, their\nseniority shall be determined\naccording to pay, preference\nbeing given to a member, who\nwas drawing a higher rate of\npay in his previous\nappointment and if the rates\nof pay drawn are also the\nsame, the y by the length of\ntheir service in the\nappointments, and if the\nlength of such service is also\nthe same, the older member\nshall be senior to the younger\nmember.\"\n\n1974 Rules and 1980 Rules mutatis mutatis are the same.\n\nRule 2 (g) of 1980 Rules defines \"Service\" to mean Haraya\nEducation Department (State Service, Group B). Under Rule 3,\nthe Service shall comprise the posts shown in Appendix A to\nthe Rules. Rule 4 prescribes the general eligibility\ncriteria and Rule 5 prescribes age requirement. Rule 6\nprescribes educational qualifications as per Appendix B.\nRule 8 enumerates certain grounds for disqualification for\nappointment to any post in the service. Relevant part of\nRule 9 with which we are concerned reads as under :\n\n\"9. (1) Recruitment to the Service\nshall be made,\n\n(a) in the case of Registrar, -\n\n(i) from amongst the Assistant\nRegistrar (Examinations),\nBudget Officer in the Service\nor by promotion from amongst\nthe Superintendents in the\nService;\"\n\nIn other words, all feeder posts enumerated constitute\nsource of recruitment to the post of Registrar.\n\n\"or\n\n(c) in the case of Budget Officer,-\n\n(i) by promotion from amonst the\nSuperintendents; or\n\n(ii) by transfer or deputation of\nan officer of equivalent\ngrade/experience, already in\nthe service of Government of\nIndia or any State Government.\n\n(d) in the case of\nSuperintendent,-\n\n(i) by promotion from amonst the\nDeputy Superintendents, or\nAssistants in the Haryana\nEducation Department (State\nService, Group C) Services; or\n\n(ii) by transfer or deputation of\nan officer of equivalent grade\nalready in the service of\nGovernment of India or of any\nState Government; or\n\n(iii) by direct recruitment.\"\n\n(2) Whenever any vacancy occur or\nis about to occur in the Service,\nthe appointing authority shall\ndetermine in what manner such\nvacancy shall be filled.\n\n(3) All promotions, whether from\none grade to another or from one\nclass of service to another class\nof service, shall be made by\nselection based on merit and taking\ninto consideration seniority but\nseniority alone shall not given any\nright to such promotions.\n\nOn appointment so made, by operation of Rule 10, person\nappointed to nay post in the Service shall remain on\nprobation for a period of two years, if appointed by direct\nrecruitment and one year if he is appointed otherwise\n(promotion). However, under proviso thereto, among others,\nany period before such appointment, spent on deputation on a\ncorresponding post or a higher post shall count towards the\nperiod of probation of one year. Under sub-rule (2) of Rule\n10, if in the opinion of the appointing authority the work\nor conduct of a person during the period of probation is not\nsatisfactory, it may, (a) if such person is appointed by\ndirect recruitment, dispense with his services; and (b) if\nsuch person is appointed otherwise then by direct\nrecruitment (promotion) or transfer, (i) revert him to his\nformer post; or (ii) deal with him in such other manner as\nthe terms and conditions of his previous appointment permit.\n\nOn completion of the period of probation by a person, under\nsub-rule (3), the appointing authority may, (a) if his work\nor conduct has in its opinion, been satisfactory - (i)\nconfirm such person from the date of his appointment, if\nappointed against a permanent vacancy; or (ii) confirm such\nperson from the date from which a permanent vacancy occurs,\nif appointed against a temporary vacancy; or in case of non-\navailability of permanent vacancy (iii) declare that he has\ncompleted his probation satisfactorily and awaits\nappointment to permanent vacancy; or (b) If his work or\nconduct has, in its opinion, not been satisfactory, - (i)\ndispense with his services, if appointed by direct\nrecruitment or if appointed otherwise, revert him to his\nformer post or deal with him in such other manner as the\nterms and conditions of his previous appointment permits; or\n\n(ii) extend his period of probation and thereafter pass such\norder, as it could have passed on the expiry of the period\nof probation. Under proviso, however, the total period of\nprobation, including extension, if any, shall not exceed\nthree years. It would thus in the Service, either by direct\nrecruitment or by promotion/transfer, the incumbent officer\nis required to be put on probation and on completion of the\nprobation or extended probation period, upto a maximum of\nthree years, the authority is enjoined to declare completion\nof his probation. In other words, he stands confirmed to the\nService. He gets appointed to a permanent vacancy subject to\navailability and thereafter he becomes full-fledged member\nof the Service. It is settled legal position that\nconfirmation is an inglorious uncertainty. Continuous length\nof service; if appointed according to the Rules on\nconsideration of claims of eligible persons as on that date\nas per rules accords seniority and gets counted from the\ndate of initial appointment by direct recruitment/promotion/\ntransfer to the cadre/post.\n\nThe question then arises : as to from what date the\nseniority is required to be determined? As seen, under Rule\n11, the inter se seniority of the member of the Service\nshall be determined by the length of continuos service is a\npost in the Service. However, exception are carved out to\nthe said general rule. Under the first proviso, where there\nare different cadres or categories of posts in the Service,\nthe seniority shall be determined separately for each cadre\nor category of posts. The second proviso being not relevant\nfor our purpose, is omitted. Under the third proviso, in\ncase of two or more members are appointed on the same date,\ntheir seniority shall be determined in the following manner:\n\n\"(a) a member appointed by direct\nrecruitment shall be senior to\na member appointed by\npromotion or by transfer;\n\n(b) a member appointed by\npromotion shall be senior to a\nmember appointed by transfer;\n\n(c) in the case of members\nappointed by promotion or by\ntransfer, seniority shall be\ndetermined according to the\nseniority of such members in\nthe appointments from which\nthey were promoted or\ntransferred;\"\n\n[Class (d) being irrelevant\nfor the present purpose, is\nomitted]\nConjoint reading of the provisions referred to\nhereinabove would indicate that according to 1974 Rules,\nthere exist in the Service cadre/grades consisting of\nClerks, Assistants, Deputy Superintendents and\nSuperintendents in the Service. Similarly, under 1980 Rules,\nthere exist cadre/grade of Budget Officer, Assistant\nRegistrar and Registrar. It is also seen that under the\nRules, appointment by promotion to Grade B-Class-I, i.e.,\nGazetted cadre, is to be made from amongst the Budget\nOfficers or Superintendents. Therefore, promotion to the\npost of Registrar (Education) one of the feeder posts is\nSuperintendent. It is seen that as soon as a person is\nappointed to a cadre/grade, he starts discharging the duties\nof appointment to the post and his seniority is determined\non the basis of that date unless he is appointed only as a\nstop-gap arrangement or on ad hoc basis and de hors the\nRules. In case of regular appointment, the appointing\nauthority is enjoined to put him on probation and on\nsuccessful completion of the probation period of one year\nincluding the period spent on the higher post (s), unless\nthe probation is extended upto a maximum of three year, he\nstand confirmed in the promoted post. Thus, his confirmation\ndates back to his initial dated of appointment by promotion\nand by operation of Rule 11 and the proviso referred to\nhereinabove, the seniority stands determined from the date\nof his appointment to the cadre/grade. It would thus be\nmanifest that as soon as the candidate, whether general or\nreserved, gets promoted from one cadre, e.g., a Clerk is\npromoted as Assistant on his completion of probation and on\ndeclaration thereof, he gets confirmed as Assistant and\nbecomes a member of the Service from the initial date of\nappointment by promotion. Equally, when an Assistant become\nDeputy Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent becomes\nSuperintendent, the method of computation of seniority would\nbe the same, viz., as soon as his probation is declared, he\nbecomes a member of the Service. On availability of\npermanent post, he gets appointed to the post and thereafter\nceases to be a member of the feeder/lower cadre. In this\nregard, under Fundamental Rule 14-A(a) a Government\nServant's lien on a post may, in no circumstance, be\nterminated, even with his consent, if the result will be to\nleave him without a lien or a suspended lien upon a\npermanent post. Under Fundamental Rules 14-A(d) a Government\nservant's lien on a post shall stand terminated on his\nacquiring a lien on a permanent post (whether under the\nCentral Government or a State Government) outside the cadre\non which he is borne. A conjoint reading, thus, would\nestablish that a Government servant shall always have a lien\non the post and simultaneously, he shall not have right to\nhold any lien on more than one post. In other word, the\narticulated be a member of two post/service/grade/cadre nor\nis he eligible to hold lien on two posts. On promotion from\nthe post of Clerk as Assistant, on successful and\nsatisfactory completion of probation and declaration\nthereof, he becomes a member of the Service in the cadre of\nAssistant and so on till the cycle is complete. Vice versa,\nthere are various stages of promotion to the higher echelons\nof Service and the same resultant consequence follow. The\nsame principle equally applies in Group B Service under 1980\nRules. This principle is applicable equally to the general\nas well as reserved candidates. On this principle, there is\nand there should be no dichotomy and this is the settled\nservice jurisprudence. In the case of appointment by\npromotion of Dalits and Tribes, no different yardstick\nshould be applied. This is the normal/common phenomenon is\nservice jurisprudence in Service under, either the Union\nGovernment or the State Government, or for that matter,\nsemi-Government authorities/corporations/undertakings.\n\nThe question then is : whether such a rule becomes\narbitrary or violative of equality enshrined under\nArticle\nread with\nArticle 16 (1)\nof the Constitution, when\napplied to Dalits and Tribes? It would be appropriate at\nthis stage to have the benefit of case law on the subject.\nIn the All India Administrative Service (SAS) Association &\nOrs. V/s. Union of India [(1993) Supp 1 SCC 730], in paras\n14 and 15, a Bench of three Judges, to which one of us, K.\nRamaswamy, J., was a member, has held that no one has vested\nright to promotion or seniority but an officer has an\ninterest in seniority acquired by working out the rules. In\nT.R. Kapoor V/s. Stat of Haryana [(1986) Supp. SCC 584 at\n595], this Court observed that \"unless it is specifically\nprovided in the rules, the employees who are already\npromoted before the Amendment of the Rules, cannot be\nreverted and their promotions cannot be recalled\". In State\nof Maharashtra V/s. Chandrakant Anant Kulkarni [(1981) 4 SCC\n130], another Bench of three Judges in paragraph 16 at page\n141 had held that \"(M)ere chances of promotion are not\nconditions of service, and the fact that there was reduction\nin the chances of promotion did not tantanmount to a change\nin the conditions of service.\"\nIn\nK. Jagadeesan vs. Union of\nIndia & Ors.\n[(1990) 2 SCC 228 at 230], in para 6, it was\nheld that \"a right to be considered for promotion is a term\nof service, but mere chances of promotion are not\"; so also\nthe eligibility for promotion. Passing of the departmental\nexamination is nothing but a mere chance of promotion. In\nAshok Kumar Gupta V/s Stat of U.P. [1997 (3) SCALE 289 at\n299, para 22] this Court comprising all the three of us, had\nheld that \"in service jurisprudence, a distinction between a\nright and interest has always been maintained. Seniority is\na facet of interest. When the Rules prescribed the method of\nselection/recruitment, seniority is given as per the ranking\ngiven and governed by such as was laid in the rules\".\nSimilar view taken in A.K. Bhatnagar V/s. Union of India\n[(1991) 1 SCC 544] was upheld by this Court. In Akhil\nBhartiya Soshit KarmchariSangh V/s. Union of India [(1996) 6\nSCC 65] to which tow of us, K. Ramaswamy and G.B. Pattanaik,\nwere members, this Court has held that no member of the\nservice has a vested right to promotion or seniority but an\nofficer has an interest in seniority acquired by working out\nthe rules. In Md. Shujat Ali & Ors. etc. v. Union of India &\nOrs. etc. [(1975) 1 SCR 449] a Constitution Bench had held\nthat a rule which confers a right of actual promotion or a\nright to be considered for promotion is a rule prescribing\nconditions of service.\nIn Mohd. Bhakar vs. Krishna Reddy\n[1970 SLR 268], a Bench of three Judges had held that any\nrule which affects the promotion of a person, relates to\nconditions of service.\nIn\nState of Mysore v. G.B.\n[1967\nS.L.R. 753] a Bench of two Judges had held that rule which\nmerely affects chances of promotion cannot be regarded as\nvarying the condition of service. Chances of promotion are\nnot conditions of service.\n\nIn\nSyed Khalid Rizvi & Ors. v.\nUnion of India & Ors.\n[1993 supp. (3) SCC 575] to which one\nof us K.R.S., J. was a members, it was held in para 31 that\nno employer has a right to promotion; the only right is that\nhe is entitled to be considered for promotion according to\nrules. Chances of promotion are not conditions of service\nwhich defeasible in accordance with the rules. Thus, it is\nsettled principle in the service jurisprudence that mere\nchances of promotion are not conditions of service and a\ncandidate appointed in accordance with the rule and steal a\nmarch over his erstwhile seniors in the feeder/lower cadre.\nOn his having satisfactorily completed probation and\ndeclaration thereof, he is given seniority in the higher\ncadre. He become a member of the higher cadre from the date\nof starting discharging duty of the post to which he is\npromoted unless otherwise determined in accordance with the\nrules. From that date, he ceases to be a Member of the\nfeeder cadre/grade from which he was promoted. The\nhierarichal promotions to various cadres mentioned\nhereinabove operate in the same manner and thereby on\nsuccessive promotion to various cadres/grades, though in the\nsame service, on would steal a march over other, by they\ngeneral or reserved candidates.\n\nOn promotion to the higher cadre, the reserved\ncandidate steals a march over general candidates and becomes\na member of the service in the higher cadre or grade earlier\nto the general candidates. Continuous length of service\ngives him the seniority cannot get re-opened, after the\ngeneral candidate gets promoted to the higher cadre/grade,\nthough he was erstwhile senior in the feeder cadre/grade.\nWould a dual principle of seniority of Dalits and Tribes and\ngeneral candidates is valid and constitutionally\npermissible? If a positive finding in that behalf is\nrecorded, it would run contrary to the bed role of judicial\nprecedents and it would be fraught with irreconcilable\nincongruities in matter of integrating employees drawn from\ndifferent streams to forge into common seniority or promoted\naccording to rule which hitherto is well-trenched in service\njurisprudence.\nIn\nState of U.P. v. Dr. Dina Nath Shukla &\nAnr. [JT\n1997 (2) SC 467 para 8] it was held that the\ncraving for equality generates clash of interest and\ncompeting claims amongst the people, for emancipation of\nthe Dalits and Tribes from the pangs of absolute prohibition\nof legal equality under\nArticles 15(1)\nand\n16(1).\nUnder\n\nArticle 15(2)\nto (4) and\nArticle 16(4)\nand\n4(a)\nread with\nthe Directive Principles, protective discrimination has\npoured forth practical content, softened the rigour of legal\nequality and given practical content of equality in\nopportunity in favour of unequals to hold an office or post\nunder the State in the democratic governance. In paragraph\n9, it is further stated that in a democracy governed by rule\nof law every segment of the society is entitled to a share\nin the governance of the country. Permanent bureaucray is a\nfacet of our democratic governance and an integral scheme of\nthe Constitution. Recruitment to a post or an office under\nState is governed by the Constitution, law and the rules\nmade under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution or\nadministrative instructions in the absence of statutory\nrules. Protective discrimination has been upheld by this\nCourt which connotes mitigation of absolute equality in\norder to achieve equality in result in favour of the\ndisadvantaged segments of the society. Appointment to an\noffice or post gives an opportunity to have equality of\nstatus and dignity of person. The object, thereby, is to\nprovide economic equality, Social equality gets realised\nthrough facilities and opportunities given to the Dalits and\nTribes to live with dignity and with equal status in the\nsociety. Economic equality also gives socio economic\nempowerment, a measure to improve excellence in every walk\nof life. Equal opportunity of appointment to a post or\noffice is available to all citizens and legitimately and\nconstitutionally entitles them to consider their claims for\nemployment/appointment to an office or post in accordance\nwith rules.\nArticle 335\nmandates the State that in the field\nof competition the claims of Dalits and Tribes shall be\ntaken into consideration consistently with the maintenance\nin appointment of promotion in favour of Dalit and Tribes is\na constitutional right under\nArticle 16(1)\nand\n16(4A)\nread\nwith\nArticle 46\nand other related Articles.\n\nReservation in\npromotion was upheld by this Court in\nR.K. Sabarwal & Ors.\nv. State of Punjab & Ors.\n[(1995) 2 SCC 745]. It is well\nsettled constitutional principal that reservation in favour\nof Dalits and Tribes is in favour of the community but not\nto the individuals belonging to that community, although\nother ultimate beneficiaries are individuals.\n\nIn\nDr. Jagdish\nSaran & Ors v. Union of India\n[(1980) 2 SCC 768], it was\nheld that Dalits and Tribes for the purpose of admission\nunder\nArticle 15(4)\nstand as a class. \"The Constitution has\nassigned a special place for that factum and the problems of\ninherited injustice demanding social surgery which, if\napplied thoughtlessly in other situation, may by a remedy\nwhich extenuates their malody.\" In other words, in social\nsurgery of effectuating actuality in results, reservation in\nfavour of Dalits Tribes is a resultant surgical remedy to\nthe malody.\n\nIn\nDr. Pradeep Jain & Ors. v. Union of India &\nOrs.\n[(1984) 3 SCC 654] which was approved in Indira\nSawhney's case, discrimination. Now the concept which takes\nin its sweep every process of equalisation under the canopy\nof protective discrimination.\n\nEquality must not remain mere idle incantation but must\nbecome a vibrant living reality for the large masses of\npeople. In a hierarchical society with an indelible feudal\nstamp and incurable actual inequality, it is absurd to\nsuggest that progressive measures to eliminate group\ndisabilities and promote collective equality are\nantagonistic to and anathima of equality on the ground that\nevery individual is entitled to equality of opportunity\nbased purely on merit mantra judged by the marks obtained by\nhim. We cannot countenance such a suggestion, for to do so\nwould make the equality clause becomes sterile and\nperpetuate existing inequalities. Equality of opportunity is\nnot simply a matter of legal equality. Its existence depends\nnot merely on the absence of disabilities but on the\npresence of abilities and opportunity for excellence in each\ncadre/grade. Where, therefore, there is inequality, in fact,\nlegal equality always tends to accentuate inequality. It is,\ntherefore, necessary to take into account de facto\ninequalities which exist in the society and in order to\nbring about real equality, affirmative action fills the bill\nand allows to give preference to the socially and\neconomically disadvantaged persons by inflicting handicaps\non those more advantageously placed. Such affirmative\naction though apparently discriminatory, is calculated to\nproduce equality in result on a broader basis by eliminating\nde facto inequalities and placing the weaker section of the\ncommunity on a footing of equality with the stronger and\nmore powerful and a disadvantaged section so that each\nmember of the community, whatever is by his birth,\noccupation or social position, may enjoy equal opportunity\nof using to the full, his natural endowments of physique, of\ncharacter and of intelligence. This principle was approved\nand reiterated by the Constitution Bench in\nMarri Chandra\nShekhar Rao v. Dean, Seth G.S. Medical College & Ors.\n\n[(1990) 3 SCC 130]. It would, thus, i.e. , a settled\nconstitutional principle that facilities and opportunities\nshould be given to the Dalits and Tribes for promotion to\nhigher cadre or grade, gain accelerated seniority by the\nDalit and Tribes and delimit the seniority of the erstwhile\ngeneral candidates in the lower cadre or grade in accordance\nwith the roster point. Thereby, the Dalits and Tribes are\ngetting and accelerated placement in the higher echelons of\ncadre or grade. It is constitutionally a permissible\nclassification bearing reasonable nexus to the object of\nequality in result as component of economic and social\nempowerment. It is just and reasonable procedure prescribed\nto achieve the constitutional objectives of equality in\nresult, of status and opportunity and dignity of person to\nintegrate them in the mainstream of the national life, as\nper the arch of the Constitution, i.e., the Preamble,\n\nArticle 14\n, 15\n, 16\nand\nand all other related Articles of\nthe Constitution consistent with the efficiency of\nadministration envisaged under\nArticle 335\nof the\nConstitution.\n\nIn A.K. Gupta & Anr. v. State of U.P. & Ors. [1997 (3)\nSCALE 289 at 302 para 28] we have held that as regards the\ncompeting claims between Dalits and Tribes on the one hand\nand the general candidates on the other,\nArticle 14\nand\n\n16(1)\nrender an balancing right to equality in result\nadjusting the competing rights of all sections.\nIn\nAhmedabad\nSt. Xaviers College Society & Anr. v. State of Gujarat &\nAnr.\n[(1975) 1 SCR 173 at 252] a larger Bench of nine Judges\nhad held that to establish equality, if it would require\nabsolute identical treatment of both the minority and\nmajority, that would result only in equality in law but\ninequality in fact. Equality in law precludes discrimination\nof any kind whereas equality in fact may involve the\nnecessity of differential treatment in order to attain a\nresult which establishes an equilibrium between different\nsituations. This Court held that the fundamental rights are\nto be construed broadly so as to enable the citizen to enjoy\nthe fundamental right by succeeding generations.\nIn A.K.\nGupta's case, therefore, it was held that \"to give adequate\nrepresentation to the Dalits and Tribes in all posts or\nclasses of posts of services to make it a reality and\ntruism, facilities and opportunities are required to be\nprovided to the Dalits as enjoined in\nArticle 38\nfor the\npurpose of achieving equality of representation as a real\ncontent. In para 30, it was observed that in abstract\napplication of equality under\nArticle 14\n, every citizen is\ntreated alike without there being any discrimination.\nThereby, the equality, in fact, subsists. Equality prohibits\nthe State from making discrimination among citizen on any\nground. However, inequality in fact without differential\ntreatment between the advantaged and disadvantaged subsists.\nIn order to bridge the gap between inequality in results and\nequality in fact, protective discrimination provides\nequality of opportunity . Those who are unequals cannot be\ntreated by identical standards. Equality in law certainly\nwould not be real equality. In the circumstances, equality\nof opportunity depends not merely on the absence of\ndisparities but on the presence of abilities and\nopportunities. De jure equality must ultimately finds its\nraison d'etre in de facto equality. The State must,\ntherefore, resort to protective discrimination of the\npurpose of making people, who are factually unequally, equal\nin specific areas. It would, therefore, be necessary to take\ninto account de facto inequality in which exists the society\nand to take affirmative action by giving preference and\nmaking reservation in promotion in favour of the Dalits and\nTribes or by inflicting handicaps on those more\nadvantageously placed, in order to bring about equality.\nSuch affirmative action, though apparently discriminatory,\nis calculated to produce equality in result on a broader\nbasis by eliminating de facto inequality and placing Dalits\nand Tribes on the footing of equality with non-tribal, non-\nDalit employees so as to enable them to enjoy equal\nopportunity in order to unfold their full potentially.\nProtective discrimination envisaged in\nArticle 16(4)\nand\n\n16(4-A)\nis the armour to establish the said equilibrium\nbetween equality in law and equality in results as a fact to\nthe disadvantaged. The principle of reservation in promotion\nprovides equality in results.\n\nIt is true that Indra Sawhney's ratio on reservation in\npromotion became a torch bearer to the general candidates\nbut before it could become path-finder, the Parliament\nenacted 77th Constitution (Amendment) Act and brought on the\nConstitution\nArticle 16(4A)\nas a part of the Constitutional\nScheme of reservation in promotion to a post. The\nlegislative judgment put off the stream generated by Indra\nSawhney's case. It is constitutionally a valid principle\nwhich was declared to be so in several judgments referred to\nand followed and ultimately held as valid in A.K. Gupta's\ncase.\n\nVir Pal Singh Chauhan's case followed by Ajit Singh's\ncase created euphoria among general candidates that\nreservation in promotion, though till then had by the Dalits\nand Tribes, slided back in the seniority scale to the bottom\nas and when the general candidates in their own turn had got\npromotion to higher echelons of service. The question is :\n\nwhether it is really so and whether it interjected the\nnormal service jurisprudence of continuous officiation in a\npost or a cadre, unless promotion is not in accordance with\nrule?\nIn\nDirect Recruit Class II Engineering Officers'\nAssociation v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.\n[(1990) 2 SCC\n715], the Constitution Bench had held in respect of\npreposition No.1 in paragraph 47 that once an incumbent is\nappointed to a post according to rule, his seniority has to\nbe counted from the date of his confirmation. The corrolary\nof the above rules is that where the initial appointment is\nonly ad hoc and not according to rules and is made as a\nstop-gap arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be\ntaken into account for purpose of determination of the\nseniority. to appreciate the effect and the real impact of\nthe above two decision, it is necessary to look into the\nfacts therein.\nIn Vir Pal Singh Chauhan's case the principle\nconsideration for promotion was seniority under the rules\nmade by the Railway Establishment Code. The Railway Board\nissued circular letter dated August 31, 1982 which referred\nthe word `Panel'. It was a case of pure seniority rule.\nExplaining the meaning of the word `panel prepared by the\nrecruiting authority and in the absence of any specific\nrules as regards the nature of the effect of seniority in\nthe higher cadre/grade, the Bench of two Judges considered\nits effect and held that the word `panel' used in that\ncircular meant the panel prepared by the recruiting\nauthority at the time of initial entry into service and that\nthe seniority of the employees in the higher grades was also\nheld to be determine with reference to the placement in the\ninitial appointment. It is settled legal position that the\nratio decidendi is based upon the facts actually decided. It\nis an authority of those facts. In the light of the factual\nposition culled out by this Court on the panel position in\nthe lower cadre of the general as well as reserved\ncandidates, this Court in Vir Pal Chauhan's case, had held\nthat though the Dalit and Tribes were promoted earlier to\nthe general candidates to a higher cadre/grade, in the\nabsence of such a panel prepared in the promoted\ncadre/grade, the panel prepared in the lower cadre remained\nto be operative. Consequent, on promotion of the general\ncandidates, the inter se seniority vis-a-vis reserved\ncandidates remained the same as was found in the lower\ncadre. That was the real ratio in that case, on the basis of\nthe circular letter referred to hereinbefore. Accordingly,\nthe said ratio, as pointed out by the High Court, does not\nhelp the appellants-general candidates for the reason that\nRule 11 of 1974 Rules or 1980 Rules expressly occupies the\nfield and determines their inter se seniority in each\ncadre/grade with reference to the date on which the\ncandidates, be it reserved or general, entered into the\nservice in the promoted cadre/grade. Vir Pal Chauhan's case,\ntherefore, is a class of its own and of no assistance when\nthe rules occupy the field governing the seniority position\nin a particular manner. The Rules alone are required to be\nlooked into and seniority determined in accordance\ntherewith. In fact, this Court in Vir Pal Chauhan's case\nfurther pointed out that when reserved candidates were\npromoted from the initial stage to further stage, circular\nletter has no application and the seniority of the reserved\ncandidates was required to be determined on the basis of\nseniority position occupied by him in the promoted post.\nThis clearly explains that this Court did not intend to\ndepart from the normal service jurisprudence; nor did it\nintend to lay down any separate rule of interpretation in\ndetermining inter se seniority of the reserved candidates\nand the general candidates and their fusion into common\nseniority in the higher echelons over the erstwhile junior\nreserved candidates. Equally, the ratio in Ajit Singh's\ncase, as rightly pointed out by the High Court, is\ninapplicable. It did not lay down any separate rule in that\nbehalf. In that case it was not brought to the notice of\nthis Court the existence of operation of the service\nconditions and seniority rule like Rule 11 of the Rule in\nthis case in each grade/cadre or services in Punjab &\nHaryana Secretariat service or Civil Services. On the other\nhand, this Court was invited to deal with the circular\nletter issued by the Punjab & Haryana Government, on the\nsubject of reservation rules.\nThe primary question before\nthe Full Bench of Punjab & Haryana High Court in\nJaswant\nSingh v. Secretary, Govt. of Punjab & Haryana\n[1990 (4) SLR\n257] was whether the reserved candidates were eligible for\nconsideration for promotion to the general vacancies? It was\nheld that they were entitled. The further question was :\n\nwhether their placement should be in the roster point\nreserved for Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes, or they\nare required to be adjusted in the general vacancies\nspecified in the roster? In Sabharwal's case, the\nConstitution Bench upheld that the reserved candidates are\nentitled to compete with the general candidates for\npromotion to the general post in their own right. On their\nselection, they are to be adjusted in the general post as\nper the roster and the reserved candidates should be\nadjusted in the points ear-marked in the roster to the\nreserved candidates. Since a slight deviation to that\nprinciple was required to be considered in other cases, Ajit\nSingh case and other cases were delinked. These cases were\ndealt with in Ajit Singh's case. Therein the question was as\nto the effect of the consideration of inter se claims of\nreserved candidates and general candidate to the\npost/vacancy available to the general candidates. In that\nbackground, this Court considered in Ajit Singh's case that\nsince the reserved candidates promoted accordingly to the\nprincipal of reservation earlier to the general candidates\nwere not considered, the general candidates and reserved\ncandidates are required to the considered for promotion to\nthe general vacancies on the basis of erstwhile seniority.\nthe inter se seniority in the lower cadre is required to be\nconsidered and to that extend the advantage had by the\nreserved candidates of earlier promotion was not relevant.\nIt is also to be noted that the criteria for promotion in\nAjit Singh's case was seniority-cum-merit or merit-cum-\nseniority in which event the principle of seniority also\ngains relevancy and is one of the factors to be taken into\nconsideration. It is settled legal position that if the\nselection is to be made for promotion on the principle of\nmerit and ability, the more meritorious, though junior,\nsteals a march over the less meritorious senior candidate,\nbe it general or reserved candidate. In this case H.S. Hira\nhas stolen a march over his senior Dalits. Where merit and\nability are approximately equal, only the seniority in the\nlower cadre becomes relevant. When the merit-cum-seniority\nor seniority-cum-merit principle is to be applied, as stated\nearlier, the seniority being a relevant factor, this Court\nin Ajit Singh's case has held that the advantage of prior\npromotion to the reserved candidates is not material\ncircumstance when the general and reserved candidates\ntogether are considered for promotion to a higher\ncadre/grade. The ration in Ajit Singh's case should be\nunderstood in the above backdrop and perspective. If so\nunderstood, this Court in Ajit Singh's case has not laid\ndown any contra principle to the settled legal service\njurisprudence; nor it intended to cut down the effect of the\nRule in vogue for determination of the inter se seniority\nin each cadre/grade in accordance with the Rules. Therefore,\nit is a simplistic euphoria to think that at all events the\nearlier promotions had by the reserved candidates have been\nslide down and put back in the vanguard of the erstwhile\nseniority position in the feeder cadre/grade. If this\nclarity of though is kept in fore-front, there is no\noccasion to adopt a mistaken application of the principle to\nall facts in all circumstance. In Ajit Singh's case, this\nCourt did not, therefore, intend to lay down any principle\ncontra to the settled legal principle that continuous\nofficiation to a promoted post in accordance with the rules\ngives right to seniority. The observation of this Court in\nAjit Singh's case that any other rule of construction would\nbe arbitrary violating\nArticle 14\nis required to be\nunderstood in that backdrop and context. As stated in A.K.\nGupta's case, it was held that both general and reserved\ncandidates being citizen of India are entitled to equality\nof opportunity assured under\nArticle 14\nand\n16(1).\n\nAs held\nin\nThomas v. State of Kerala\n[1976 (1) SCR 906] and approved\nin Indra Sawhney's case, the right to equality to the\nreserved candidates is a fundamental right under\nArticle\n16(1)\nread with\nArticle 14\nwhich itself guarantees a\nfundamental right. After the Constitution (77th Amendment)\nAct,\nArticle 16(4-A)\ngives fundamental rights to the Dalits\nand Tribes to promotion to a post or a service in the State,\nThe protective discrimination is a contour to bring about\nequality in results to the Dalits and Tribes. It is a facet\nof equality under\nArticle 14\n, 15\nand\nof the Constitution.\nTherefore, when competing rights between general and\nreserved candidates require adjudication and adjustment with\nthe right of general candidates, the doctrine of violation\nof\nArticle 14\nhas no role to play since protective\ndiscrimination itself is a facet of\nArticle 14\nand it does\nnot again deny equality to the reserved candidates.\n\nTherefore, in Ajit Singh's case when this Court had held\nthat such a rule of reservation would be violative of\n\nArticle 14\nand arbitrary, it does not appear to have meant\nto destroy the protective discrimination which is a\nconsistent thread running through all situations when\nreservation was applied in favour of the reserved candidates\nand the equality in results in achieved. Thus, we hod that\nthe euphoria had by the general candidates from the ratios\nin Vir Pal Chauhan's and Ajit Singh's cases is short lived;\nit does not help in so realising the correct implications\narising from the aforesaid ratios. It is settled law that\nadministrative instructions supplement the law but do not\nsupplant the law. It fills only yawning gaps. The\nadministrative instructions issued by the Haryana Government\nafter Ajit Singh's case flies in the facet of statutory Rule\n11 of the rules. Therefore, it crushes itself with the\ngrinding teeth of the above statutory Rule 11 and the\nprinciple. Thus considered, we hold that the view taken by\nthe High Court in that behalf is correct in law and is not\nvitiated by any infirmity in law. We further hold that the\nreserved candidates became senior to the general candidates\nin each successive cadre/grade from Assistant to\nSuperintendent in Class III Service and 5th respondent in\nClass I Service. Their seniority is not and cannot have the\neffect of getting wiped out after the promotion of general\ncandidates from their respective dates of promotion. The\ngeneral candidates remain junior in higher echelons to the\nreserved candidates as was held by the High Court.\n\nThat apart, as this Court has repeatedly held, the\ndelay disentitles the party to the discretionary relief\nunder\nArticle 226\nor 32 of the Constitution. It is not\nnecessary to reiterate all catena of precedents in this\nbehalf. Suffice it to state that the appellant kept sleeping\nover their rights for long and elected to wake up when they\nhad the impetus from Vir Pal Chauhan and Ajit Singh's\nratios. But Vir Pal Chauhan and Sabharwal's cases, kept at\nrest the promotion already made by that date, and declared\nthem as valid; they were limited to the question of future\npromotions given by applying the rule of reservation, to all\nthe persons prior to the dated of judgment in Sabharwal's\ncase, which required to examined in the light of law laid in\n\nSabharwal\n's case. Thus earlier promotions cannot be\nreopened?\nOnly those cases arising after that date would be\nexamined in the light of the law\nlaid down in\nSabharwal's\ncase Vir Pal Chauhan's case and equally Ajit Singh's case.\nIf the candidate has already been further promoted to the\nhigher echelons of service, his seniority is not open to be\nreviewed.\nIn\nA.B.S. Karamchari Sangh\n's case, Bench of two\nJudge to which two of us, K. Ramaswamy and G.B. Pattanik,\nJJ. were members, had reiterated the above view and it was\nalso held that all the prior promotions are not open\njudicial review.\nIn Chander Pal & Ors. v. State of Haryana\n[W.P. (C) Nos. 4715-18/93 dated December 4, 1996] a Bench of\ntwo judges consisting of S.C. Agrawal and G.T. Nanavati, JJ.\nconsidered the effect of Vir Pal Chauhan's, Ajit Singh,\nSabharwal and A.B.S Karmachari Sangh's cases and held that\nthe seniority of those respondents who had already retired\nor promoted to higher posts could not be disturbed. The\nseniority of the petitioner therein and the respondent who\nwere holding the post in the same level or in the same cadre\nwould be adjusted keeping in view the ratio in Vir Pal\nChauhan and Ajit Singh's cases; but promotion, if any, had\nbeen given to any of them during the pendency of this writ\npetition, was directed not to be disturbed. Therein, the\ncandidates appointed on the basis of economic backwardness,\nsocial status or occupation etc. were eligible for\nappointment against the post reserved for backward classes\nif their income did not exceed Rs. 18,000/- per annum and\nthey were given accelerated promotion on the basis of\nreservation. In that backdrop, the above directions came to\nbe issued. In fact, it did not touch upon\nArticle 16(4)\nor\n16(4-A). Therefore, desperate attempts of the appellants to\nre-do the seniority had by them in various cadres/grades\nthough in the same services according to 1974 Rules or 1980\nRule, are not amenable to judicial review at this belated\nstage. The High Court, therefore, has rightly dismissed the\nwrit petition on the ground of delay as well.\n\nThus we hold that the decision of the High Court is not\nvitiated by any error of application of wrong principle of\nlaw warranting interference.\n\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed but, in the\ncircumstance, without costs.",
