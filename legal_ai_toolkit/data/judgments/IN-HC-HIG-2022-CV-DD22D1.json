The order dated 27.04.2022 passed in\nthe Letters Patent Appeal reads as under:\n\n\"Heard learned Assistant Government Pleader\nMr.Sahil Trivedi for the appellant- applicant,\nlearned advocate Mr.Vaibhav Vyas for the\nrespondent No.1 and learned advocate\nMs.Trusha Patel for the respondent No.2.\n\n2. This Letters Patent Appeal under Clause 15\nof the Letters Patent Act, is directed against\norder dated 11.8.2021 of learned Single Judge\nwhereby the Special Civil Application filed by\nthe petitioner- respondent No.1 herein came to\nbe allowed. The respondents were directed to\ngrant benefit of one increment to the petitioner\nand accordingly revise his pension.\n\n2.1 The petitioner prayed in his petition to set\naside communication dated 6.1.2021. By the\nsaid communication the petitioner was refused\nto benefit of notional increment falling due on\n1.7.2020 on the ground that the petitioner had\nretired with effect from 30.6.2020. It was stated\nin the said order that since the petitioner\nceased to remain in employment he could not\nbe considered as employee from 1st July, with\neffect from having retired a day prior, he\nacquires the status of pensioner and\nconsequentially would not be entitled to the\nincrement. The said communication dated\n1.6.2021 was addressed to the Registrar\nGeneral of the respondent No.1 by the under\nSecretary of the Legal Department of the State\nGovernment.\n\n3. The relevant facts to be noticed are that the\n\nPage 3 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\npetitioner joined his services under respondent\nNo.2 as Chowpdar cum Driver on 19.2.1983.\nHe was appointed as Driver with effect from\n1.4.1987. As the date of birth of the petitioner\nwas 10.6.1960, he retired on 30.6.2020, upon\nattaining the age of superannuation. The\npetitioner had rendered one full year of service\nfrom 1.7.2019 to 30.6.2020 in the said last\nyear. It is his case that he was entitled to get\nbenefit of annual increment for the said period\nof service. The increment for the said period of\nservice, it was stated, falls due on 1.7.2\n\n3.1 The petitioner made representation dated\n31.7.2020 to respondent No.1 State requesting\nto release the increment, alongwith\nrepresentation also produced by the petitioner\nwere the instances where increment was\ngranted to the similarly situated employees\nretiring on 30th June. It is the averment of the\npetitioner that pursuant to the said\nrepresentation, respondent No.2 made proposal\nto respondent No.1, however at the end of\ncorrespondence the benefit was denied as per\nthe decision reflected in the impugned\ncommunication dated 6.1.2021.\n\n3.2 Learned Single Judge referred to Rule 39 of\nthe Gujarat Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 2002\nwhich provides for services which may be\ncounted for increment. Rule 39(1) provides for\nrelease of increment on the first date of every\nmonth. The relevant part of Rule 39 is as under,\n\"39. Service which counts for increment:\nThe following provisions prescribe the\nconditions subject to which service\ncounts for increments in a time-scale;-\n(I) Subject to the provisions of\nrules11,13,15,16,19,23,30 and 44 all\nperiods of duty discharged in a post on a\ntime-scale shall count for increments in\n\nPage 4 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\nthat time-scale. For the purpose of\narriving at the date of next increment in\nthat timescale, the total of all such\nperiods as to do not count for increment\nin that time-scale shall be added to the\nnormal dates of increment. Provided that\nthe increment shall be admissible from\nthe 1st of the month in which it accrues.\"\n\n3.3 Learned Single Judge held noticing the\nfacts of the case and the aforesaid Rule, held\nthat the Rule was misread and misinterpreted in\ndenying the increment to the petitioner, to\nobserve, (Para 8)\n\n\"The proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 39\nstipulatesthat the increment shall be\nadmissible from the 1st of the month, in\nwhich, it accrues. The petitioner has\nbeen denied the benefits of the increment\nfor the services which he rendered prior\nto his retirement i.e. from 01.07.2019 to\n30.06.2020 on the ground that the same\naccrued on 01.07.2020. The respondents\nhave indubitably misread and\nmisinterpreted the rule since it is not the\ncase of the petitioner that he is claiming\nincrement of one year after the date of\nretirement. The petitioner has become\nentitled for one increment during one\nyear of service in the time pay-scale\nprior to his retirement and only because\nthe same has accrued on 1st of every\nmonth, such benefits could not be denied\nby applying the rule prospectively\nresulting into wiping out the entire\nservice of one year, which he has\nrendered in a particular time-scale. \"\n\n3.4. While holding as above, learned Single\nJudge relied on the decision of the Madras\n\nPage 5 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\nHigh Court in\nP.Ayyamperumal Vs. The\nRegistrar and Others\nbeing Writ Petition\nNo.15732 of 2017 decided on 15.9.2017. The\nMadras High Court dealt with and interpreted\nRule 10 of the Central Civil Services (Revised\nPay) Rules, 2008 which is similar. In that case,\nthe petitioner had retired as Additional\nDirector General, Chennai on 30.6.2013 on\nattaining the age of superannuation. After the\nSixth Pay Commission the Central Government\nfixed 1st July to be the date of increment for all\nemployees by amending Rule 10 of the Rules.\n\nThis amendment resulted into denial of the\nbenefit of the last increment. Though petitioner\nhas completed full year of service on 1.7.2012\nto 30.6.2013 and had retired on 30.6.2013, in\nview of the provisions and rules, that increment\nwould be given only on 1.7.2013, the petitioner\nwas treated not eligible to earn the increment.\n\n3.4.1 The Madras High Court considered it to\nbe a decisive circumstance that employee had\ncompleted full year of service for which the\nincrement had become due, observing as under,\n(para 7)\n\n\"The petitioner herein had completed\none full year service as on 30.06.2013,\nbut the increment fell due on\n01.07.2013, on which date he was not in\nservice. In view of the above judgment of\nthis Court, naturally he has to be treated\nas having completed one full year of\nservice, though the date of increment\nfalls on the next day of his retirement.\nApplying\nthe said judgment\nto the present\ncase, the writ petition is allowed and the\nimpugned order passed by the first\nrespondent Tribunal dated 21.03.2017 is\nquashed. The petitioner shall be given\none notional increment for the period\n\nPage 6 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\nfrom 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2013, as he has\ncompleted one full year of service,\nthough his increment fell on 01.07.2013,\nfor the purpose of pensionary benefits\nand not for any other purpose. No costs.\"\n\n4. Learned Assistant Government Pleader\nrelied on the decision of the Himachal Pradesh\nHigh Court in\nHari Prakash and Others Vs.\nState of Himachal Pradesh and Others\nbeing\nCivil Writ Petition No.2503 of 2016 decided on\n6.11.2020, further on the decision of the\nRajasthan High Court in\nSafi Mohammad and\nOthers Vs. State of Rajasthan and Others\n\ndecided on 1.12.2021 and next also of the\nRajasthan High Court in\nRamji Lal Kulhari and\nOthers Vs. State of Rajasthan and Others\nbeing\nCivil Writ Petition No.85 of 2020 and group of\npetitions decided on 10.1.2022 to submit that in\nthe said decisions, the High Courts had taken a\ncontrary view holding that there would occur\nno entitlement to get the increment.\n\n4.1 On the other hand, learned advocate for the\nrespondent relied on the decisions in\nGopal\nSingh Vs. Union of India and Others\nbeing Writ\nPetition No.10509 of 2019 decided by Delhi\nHigh Court on 23.1.2020, in\nNand Vijay Singh\nand Others Vs. Union of India and Others\n\nbeing Writ Petition No.13299 of 2020 of\nAllahabad High Court decided on 29.6.2021, in\nYogendra Singh Bhadauria and Others Vs.\nState of Madhya Pradesh of High Court of\nMadhya Pradesh decided on 22.9.2020, in\nAFR\nArun Kumar Biswal Vs. State of Odisha and\nAnother\nbeing Writ Petition No.17715 of 2020\ndecided on 30.7.2021.\n\nIn all the above\ndecisions\nP.Ayyamperumal\n(supra) has been\nconsidered and relied on to hold that the\nemployee would be entitled to the benefit of\nincrement on 1st July even though he had\n\nPage 7 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\nretired on 30th June. 5.\n\nThe Delhi High Court\nin\nGopal Singh\n(supra) taking same view as\nthat of Madras High Court in\nP.Ayyamperumal\n\n(supra) explained that the entitlement of\ngovernment servant to receive the increment,\nthough may not be a matter of course, but is\ndependent upon good conduct of the central\ngovernment servant and that he earns\nincrement on the basis of his good conduct for\nspecified period. (Para 20)\n\n\"Payment of salary and increment to a\ncentral government servant is regulated\nby the provisions of F.R., CSR and\nCentral Civil Services (Pension) Rules.\nPay defined in F.R. 9(21) means the\namount drawn monthly by a central\ngovernment servant and includes the\nincrement. A plain composite reading of\napplicable provisions leaves no\nambiguity that annual increment is given\nto a government servant to enable him to\ndischarge duties of the post and that pay\nand allowances are also attached to the\npost.\nArticle 43\nof the CSR defines\nprogressive appointment to mean an\nappointment wherein the pay is\nprogressive, subject to good behaviour of\nan officer. It connotes that pay rises, by\nperiodical increments from a minimum to\na maximum. The increment in case of\nprogressive appointment is specified in\n\nArticle 151\nof the CSR to mean that\nincrement accrues from the date\nfollowing that on which it is earned. The\nscheme, taken cumulatively, clearly\nsuggests that appointment of a central\ngovernment servant is a progressive\nappointment and periodical increment in\npay from a minimum to maximum is part\nof the pay structure.\nArticle 151\nof CSR\n\nPage 8 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\ncontemplates that increment accrues\nfrom the day following which it is\nearned. This increment is not a matter of\ncourse but is dependent upon good\nconduct of the central government\nservant. It is, therefore, apparent that\ncentral government employee earns\nincrement on the basis of his good\nconduct for specified period i.e. a year in\ncase of annual increment. Increment in\npay is thus an integral part of\nprogressive appointment and accrues\nfrom the day following which it is\nearned. \"\n\n5.1 It was stated that where a government\nservant observes good conduct for entire year\nbefore increment accrues, it is logical and\nnormal that he earns the increment. Dealing\nwith the situation where the government servant\nhas retired on 30th June and the increment is\npayable on 1st July, the High Court stated thus,\n(Para 23)\n\n\"Annual increment though is attached to\nthe post & becomes payable on a day\nfollowing which it is earned but the day\non which increment accrues or becomes\npayable is not conclusive or\ndeterminative. In the statutory scheme\ngoverning progressive appointment\nincrement becomes due for the services\nrendered over a year by the government\nservant subject to his good behaviour.\nThe pay of a central government servant\nrises, by periodical increments, from a\nminimum to the maximum in the\nprescribed scale. The entitlement to\nreceive increment therefore crystallises\nwhen the government servant completes\nrequisite length of service with good\n\nPage 9 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\nconduct and becomes payable on the\nsucceeding day. \"\n\n5.1.1 It was further observed by the Delhi High\nCourt that denial of the entitlement to receive\nbenefit when is crystallized in law could be\narbitrary if it is denied unless there is valid\nreason. Though the increment was earned for\npast period it is denied on the ground that on\nthe date when the increment becoming payable\nthe government servant was not holding the\npost as he had retired, such has to be viewed to\nbe not the valid ground to deny the increment.\nThe High Court observed that 'the concept of\nday following which the increment is earned\nhas otherwise no purpose to achieve'. It was\nstated, (Para 24)\n\n\"In isolation of the purpose it serves the\nfixation of day succeeding the date of\nentitlement has no intelligible differentia\nnor any object is to be achieved by it.\nThe central government servant retiring\non 30th June has already completed a\nyear of service and the increment has\nbeen earned provided his conduct was\ngood. It would thus be wholly arbitrary if\nthe increment earned by the central\ngovernment employee on the basis of his\ngood conduct for a year is denied only on\nthe ground that he was not in\nemployment on the succeeding day when\nincrement became payable. \"\n\n5.1.2 The retirement of the government servant\non the day prior to the increment becoming\npayable is only fortuitous circumstance, it was\nrightly expressed, (Para 24)\n\n\"In the case of a government servant\nretiring on 30th of June the next day on\n\nPage 10 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\nwhich increment falls due/becomes\npayable looses significance and must\ngive way to the right of the government\nservant to receive increment due to\nsatisfactory services of a year so that the\nscheme is not construed in a manner that\nif offends the spirit of reasonableness\nenshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution of India. The scheme for\npayment of increment would have to be\nread as whole and one part of\nArticle\nof CSR cannot be read in isolation\nso as to frustrate the other part\nparticularly when the other part creates\nright in the central government servant\nto receive increment. This would ensure\nthat scheme of progressive appointment\nremains intact and the rights earned by a\ngovernment servant remains protected\nand are not denied due to a fortuitous\ncircumstance. \"\n\n5.2 The view taken by the Madras High Court\nin\nP.Ayyamperumal\n(supra) and by Delhi High\nCourt in\nGopal Singh\n(supra) and other High\nCourts as above, holding that the government\nservant is entitled to increment becoming\npayable on 1st July, even though he has retired\non 30th June, is required to be accepted. This\ncourt is in concurrence with the view taken in\nthe aforesaid decisions by the Madras High\nCourt and the Delhi High Court and the\nreasons supplied therein. This court is unable\nto subscribe to the converse view taken by High\nCourts of Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan.\n\n5.3 Furthermore the Supreme Court has\ndismissed the Special Leave Petition (Civil)\nDairy No.22283 of 2018 against the decision of\nthe Madras High Court in\nP.Ayyamperumal\n\n(supra) as per the order dated 23.7.2018.\n\nPage 11 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\n5.4 Besides above, the Division Bench of this\ncourt in\nUnion of India Vs. Laxmanbhai\nKalabhai Chavda\nbeing Special Civil\nApplication No.10751 of 2020 decided on\n27.1.2021, dealing with the same issue\naccepted the interpretation of the Rule 10 made\nby the High Court of Madras High Court in\n\nP.Ayyamperumal\n(supra). The Division Bench\nof this court dealt with the legality of the order\nof the Central Administrative Tribunal which\nhad granted the benefit.\n\nIn that learned\nstanding counsel could not dispute the\njudgment of the Madras High Court in\n\nP.Ayyamperumal\n(supra) confirmed by the\nApex Court in the Special Leave Petition as\nabove.\n\n5.4.1 In\nLaxmanbhai Chavda\n(supra), the\nDivision Bench of this court observed that\nreading of Rule 10 of the Rules would make it\nclear that the government servant is entitled to\nthe increment becoming payable on 1st July.\n(Para 5)\n\n\"...Rule 10 of the Rules, which speaks of\nuniform date of annual increment, which\nis 1st July of every year. It says that the\nemployees completing six months and\nabove in the revised pay structure as on\n1st July, will be eligible to be granted the\nincrement. The first increment, after\nfixation of pay as per the said Rules is on\n1.1.2006 in the revised pay structure\nwhich shall need to be granted on\n1.7.2006 for those employees for whom\nthe date of next increment was between\n1.7.2006 to 1.1.2007.\"\n\n5.4.2 It was further stated, (Para 6)\n\nPage 12 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\n\"...the interpretation of Rule 10 of the\nRules made by High Court of Madras in\nW.P. No.15372/2017, where the Court\nheld from the factual details that the\nemployee before it since had completed\none full year service as on 30.6.2013, i.e.\nthe date of which he was superannuated,\nbut the increment fell due on 1.7.2013,\non which date he was not in services and\ntherefore, it interpreted that he shall\nhave to be treated as having completed\none full year of service, though the date\nof increment fell on the next day of his\nretirement. Accordingly, the court had\nallowed the petition and directed that the\npetitioner before the High Court of\nMadras be given one notional increment\nfor the period from 1.7.2012 to\n30.6.2013, on his having completed one\nfull year of service.\"\n\n5.5 As a Co-ordinate Bench, we are bound by\nthe aforesaid view taken in\nLaxmanbhai\nChavda\n(supra), and stand in agreement with\nthe same.\n\n6. For the aforesaid reasons and the discussion,\nthe present challenge to the order of the\nlearned Single Judge in this Letters Patent\nAppeal stands meritless.\n\n7. The present Letters Patent Appeal is\ndismissed. Notice is discharged. Interim orders\nstand vacated. The directions issued in\nparagraph No.12 of the order of learned Single\nJudge regarding grant of benefits to the\npetitioner- respondent herein, the same shall be\ngranted within six weeks from today and the\ndirection shall be complied with.\n\nIn view of disposal of the main appeal,\nthe Civil Application will not survive.\n\nPage 13 of 14\n\nDownloaded on : Thu Aug 18 20:43:24 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/13955/2022 ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022\n\nAccordingly, it is disposed of. \"\n\n4. In view of the above, the petitioners shall be entitled\nto the benefit of one increment falling due on the 1 st of July\nof their respective dates of retirement and consequential\nbenefits on the revision of pay that would accrue to the\npetitioners and the pension and arrears thereof accordingly\nbe calculated and paid to the petitioners within a period of\nsix weeks from the date of receipt of the writ of the order of\nthis court.
