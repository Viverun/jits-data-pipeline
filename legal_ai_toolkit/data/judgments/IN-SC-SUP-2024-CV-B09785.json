Therefore, in the binding agreement you can put\nnecessary points covering both the properties and till it is not\nresolved we can work out some alternate solution so that\nboth the groups are covered properly….”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n• A joint meeting was arranged by Mr. Kalpesh Parmar and attended by Mr.\n\nAshit Patel of the AMP Group and Respondent No.9 of the SRG Group.\n\n• Vide email dated 25.01.2020 sent to the AMP Group, Mr. Kalpesh Parmar\n\nsuggested that the valuation of Millenium be finalized in consultation with\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 9 of 67\n\nthe Respondent No.9 of the SRG Group.

For Chandan Sanjaybhai, Jagdishbhai & AMP\ncan sit and decide the value within __ days from execution of\nFAA, Similarly for Millenium Sanjaybhai, Samarjitsinh &\nAMP can sit and close it along with issue of residential flats.\nThis can also be done within __ days from execution of FAA.\nIn the meantime, whatever valuation/s so far JRS has given\non Chandan & Millenium will stand withdrawn, so nothing\nis there on table from JRS side on the value of Chandan &\nMillenium. Therefore, we can proceed to close on FAA &\nEscrow agreement on Monday. If you can flip this suggestion\nwith AMP, I can try to convince Sanjaybhai too…”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n11.

SRG is\nclear that Millenium can give POA to AMP and his\nimmediate family and as agreed in FAA draft, PL can work\non language without disturbing the construct / concept. SRG\nis not going to honour any POA which is beyond what is\nstated in the draft of POA shared with him even though you\nfind any logical point in AMP’s arguments. As per him AMP\nis neither trustworthy nor a reliable person, so he is not\ninterested in dealing any further with him. He already had a\nvery bad experience of similar nature when he had sealed a\ndeal with TATAs, that time also after signing the minutes,\nAMP took extreme U-turn just for SRG to become a laughing\nstock not only in front of all partners and HDFC Realty but\nalso in front of TATAs. That’s enough for him.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 15 of 67\n\nPlease appreciate, though SRG is not a signatory to FAA, he\nis ready to honour what was agreed with him over phone call\nbut on other side there is a person though has signed a\ndocument is now not ready to stick to it. Real mockery.\n\nI would suggest that seriously you should take this with\nSanjaybhai & Shaju before approaching PI.

Clause 7.1.2\n\nis reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“7.1.1 The Parties agree to use all reasonable efforts to\nresolve any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement of\nany kind whatsoever between or amongst any of the Parties\nin connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the\nTransaction Document/s executed in connection with the\ntransaction contemplated under or in connection with this\nAgreement, including any question regarding its existence,\nvalidity or termination (\"Dispute\"), expediently and\namicably to achieve timely and full performance of the terms\nof this Agreement or the Transaction Document/s.\n\n7.1.2 Any Party which claims that a Dispute has arisen must\ngive notice thereof to the other Parties as soon as practicable\nafter the occurrence of the event, matter or thing which is the\nsubject of such Dispute and in such notice, such Party shall\nprovide particulars of the circumstances and nature of such\nDispute and of its claim(s) in relation thereto and shall\ndesignate a Person as its representative for negotiations\nrelating to the Dispute, which Person shall have authority to\nsettle the Dispute. The other Parties shall, within 7 (seven)\ndays of such notice, each specify in writing its position in\nrelation to the Dispute and designate as their representative\nin negotiations relating to the Dispute, a Person with similar\nauthority.”\n\n17. The first round of mediation was held between the representatives of the\n\nAMP and JRS Groups on 19.01.2022. However, the discussions on the\n\nissues did not lead to any conclusion. While the minutes of the same were\n\nshared with Mr. Kalpesh Parmar, he denied its contents and stated that the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 19 of 67\n\ndraft minutes do not correctly record the events which occurred at the\n\nmeeting.\n\n18. For the purpose of initiating the second round of mediation, an email dated\n\n06.05.2022 was sent by the JRS Group to the AMP Group invoking Clause\n\n7.1.2 and they nominated Mr. Anuj Trivedi or Mr. Kalpesh Parmar to act as\n\ntheir representatives. In response to the same, on 23.05.2022, the AMP\n\nGroup nominated Mr. Keyur Gandhi and/or Mr. Upen Shah and/or Mr.\n\nNihar Mehta as their representatives. The first mediation meeting was\n\nconvened on 13.06.2022. The second mediation meeting was convened on\n\n23.07.2022 wherein it was stated by the petitioners that the AMP and JRS\n\nGroups were agreeable to hold a joint meeting with SRG for the purpose of\n\nresolving the major issues pertaining to Millenium and Deegee.\n\n19. In the midst of mediation, on 17.10.2022, the JRS Group sent a WhatsApp\n\nmessage to the AMP Group stating that (a) the JRS Group had a meeting\n\nwith the SRG Group, (b) SRG and Millenium were ready to purchase the\n\nstake of AMP Group in Millenium at the price agreed in the FAA, (c) SRG\n\nwould exit from Deegee subject to a payment of Rs. 25 crore as\n\ncompensation considering its contribution to the growth of Deegee. The\n\ncontents of the message are reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“ Dear Keyurbhai.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 20 of 67\n\nMy clients had a meeting with SRG and the following points\nhave been suggested by SRG:\n\n(1) Millennium:\n\n(a) SRG and Millennium would be ready to purchase the\nstake of AMP in Millennium at the price already agreed AMP\nand JRS\n\n(b) The said purchase would be made from the compensation\nthat SRG receives from AMP for handling, taking care of and\nmaking Deegee prosperous over the last 20 years. The said\ncompensation would be used for purchasing 11% of the 36%\nstake of AMP in Millennium.\n\n(c) The balance 25% would be \"buy back\" by Millennium of\nAMP shares. This would be subject to the receipt of loan and\ninterest by Millennium & SRG from Degee\n\n(2) Amendment to AoA: Millennium and SRG are of the\nopinion that AoA does not need to be amended\n\n(3) Aurosagar Lease Deed: the lease of Millennium and\nAurosagar is as per the plans sanctioned by the Municipal\nCorporation. The draft lease deed provided is in\ncontradiction to the said sanctioned plans.\n\n(4) Aurosagar Special Power of Attorney: Millennium and\nSRG are of the opinion that there is no required of a Special\nPower of Attorney.\n\n(5) Deegee\n\n(a) SRG will exit from Deegee, however, the same has been\nformed and promoted by SRG, SRG has also given its name\nin order to avoid the conflict of interest of AMP with\nFirmenich. SRG has taken care of the company for the last\n\n20 years and has provided services without any\nrenumeration. In view thereof, for exiting Deegee, SRG is\nexpecting compensation of Rs.25 crores\n\n(b) Millennium and SRG are also expecting interest 14.50%\ntill repayment of the amount lent to AMP\n\nJRS Group has suggested that we may have another meeting\nand try to take it forward”.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 21 of 67\n\n20. Further on 21.11.2022, the JRS Group sent another WhatsApp message to\n\nthe AMP Group stating that it had spoken to the SRG Group and that if the\n\nAMP Group was not ready to recognise SRG’s contribution in the growth\n\nof Deegee, it would be difficult for them to agree with the AMP Group on\n\nany point. The contents of the message are reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“Talked with SRG and here is the response-\n\nAs he understands from me that AMP group is looking\nforward for meeting with SRG to discuss the points\nforwarded by SRG, however AMP Grp would not like to give\nany compensation for Deegee to SRG. As per SRG, if AMP\nGrp is not even ready to recognize his contribution in growth\nof Deegee, then it would be difficult for him to meet AMP\nGrp for any point and thereby the points sent by SRG shall\nbe considered as non existent and should not be referred any\ntime in future.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n21. Vide email dated 16.05.2023 sent to the AMP Group, Mr. Kalpesh Parmar\n\nconveyed that he would discuss with SRG and try to resolve all matters\n\npertaining to Deegee and would also intimate the outcome of his discussion.\n\nIt was also conveyed that Millenium can be simultaneously worked out\n\nonce Deegee is settled. The contents of the email are reproduced\n\nhereinbelow:\n\n“Dear Nihar,\n\nBased on my discussions with JRSG, following are the\ncomments:\n\n[…]\n\n4. All Deegee points we will discuss and try to resolve with\nSRG and Jabalpur Group. The outcome, we will update you.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 22 of 67\n\nHowever, we expect to complete other companies/entities as\nper excel chart, which is concerning only JRSG & AMPG,\nsubject to the comments herein without putting any deadlines\nfor Deegee.\n\n5. About Millenium, once Deegee is settled. Millenium can\nbe simultaneously worked out.\n\n6. Escrow should be released along with the signing of\nconsent terms of Aurosagar.\n\n7. As informed earlier Aurosagar's SPOA & Lease Deed\npoints can be directly dealt with SRG.\n\nYou may consider above comments and discuss. You may\nthereafter make necessary changes in your comments in the\nexcel file and resend it”.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n22. Since mediation between the parties yielded no result, the JRS Group sent\n\nan Arbitration Notice dated 11.12.2023 to the AMP Group invoking\n\nClauses 7.2 and 7.3 respectively contained in the FAA dated 28.02.2020\n\nread with the Amendment to the FAA dated 15.05.2020. The JRS Group,\n\nin the said notice, alleged, inter alia, that while the JRS Group had fulfilled\n\nits obligations under the FAA, the AMP Group had failed to discharge and\n\ntake appropriate steps in compliance of its obligations. On account of such\n\nfailure, the JRS Group was unable to fulfil its corresponding obligations\n\nand hence, disputes had arisen between the parties. They nominated Justice\n\nKalpesh S. Jhaveri (Former Chief Justice, High Court of Orissa) to act as\n\nthe sole arbitrator to resolve and adjudicate the disputes only between the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 23 of 67\n\nAMP Group and JRS Group, in accordance with the FAA. The arbitration\n\nclause contained in the FAA is reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“7.2 Any Dispute, if not resolved in accordance with Clause\n7.1, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration\nin accordance with the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act,\nread with the rules framed thereunder (\"\nArbitration\nAct\n\"). Subject to any interim reliefs/orders granted, this\nAgreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties\ncontained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and\neffect pending issuance of the award in such arbitration\nproceedings, which award, if appropriate, shall determine\nwhether and when any termination shall become effective.\n\n7.3 The arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator\nmutually agreed upon and appointed by the Parties. Failing\nsuch agreement, either Party shall be at liberty to seek\nappointment of a sole arbitrator by preferring an\nappropriate application in accordance with the\nArbitration\nAct\nbefore the jurisdictional Court or arbitral institution, as\nthe case may be, at Ahmedabad.”\n\n23. On 12.01.2024, the AMP Group gave its reply to the aforesaid notice and\n\nsent it to both the JRS and SRG Groups. The AMP Group, while denying\n\nthe contents of the Arbitration Notice, alleged, inter alia, that, it is the JRS\n\nGroup that had failed to perform their part of the obligations under various\n\npretext despite the AMP Group pursuing the same. It stated that the\n\nassertion on the part of the JRS Group that SRG Group was not bound by\n\nthe terms of the FAA since it is not a signatory to the said document was\n\ncompletely contrary to what had been represented to AMP during the\n\nnegotiations and at the time of execution of the FAA and further the same\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 24 of 67\n\nwas made only for the purpose of raising an extra monetary demand of Rs.\n\n25 crore which was never contemplated under the FAA. It was further stated\n\nthat Mr. Kalpesh Parmar and the JRS Group had represented the SRG\n\nGroup at all stages including the mediation process. The appointment of\n\nJustice Akil Kureshi (Former Chief Justice, High Court of Rajasthan) was\n\nsuggested as an arbitrator for adjudication of all disputes arising under the\n\nFAA between the AMP, JRS and SRG Groups.\n\n24. On 09.02.2024 and 10.02.2024 respectively, the JRS Group and SRG\n\nGroup responded to the reply to the Arbitration Notice sent by the AMP\n\nGroup.\n\n25. Upon failure to reach an agreement on the appointment of the Sole\n\nArbitrator within 30 days, the Petitioner AMP Group has filed the present\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 before this Court.\n\nB. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER (AMP\n\nGROUP)\n\n26. Mr. Darius Khambata, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe petitioners submitted that although the SRG Group is not a signatory to\n\nthe FAA dated 28.02.2020 which contains the arbitration clause, yet it is a\n\nveritable party to the arbitration agreement since they participated in the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 25 of 67\n\nnegotiations leading up to the FAA and continued to talk with the parties\n\non the issues pertaining to the implementation of the FAA.\n\n27. It was submitted that the successful implementation of the FAA was\n\ncontingent on the involvement and action of the SRG Group and it was the\n\nintention and understanding of all the parties, including the SRG Group,\n\nthat they would adhere to, and act on the terms of the FAA. The same was\n\nsubmitted to be evident through the following:\n\n• The email dated 14.01.2020 by which Mr. Kalpesh Parmar stated that\n\nthe valuation of Respondent Nos. 7 and 8 respectively can be finalized\n\nonly in consultation with the SRG Group;\n\n• A joint meeting that took place between Mr. Kalpesh Parmar, Mr. Ashit\n\nPatel and Respondent No.9 during which Respondent No.9 represented\n\nthat Mr. Kalpesh Parmar was also representing the interest of the SRG\n\nGroup in the negotiations and that SRG would be bound by the final\n\nterms agreed with Mr. Kalpesh Parmar and JRS Group;\n\n• The email dated 08.05.2020 by which Mr. Kalpesh Parmar asserts that\n\nSRG is ready to honour what was agreed in the FAA and that he has to\n\nsafeguard the interest of SRG in the implementation of the FAA.\n\n• Even after the execution of the FAA, important emails dated\n\n13.03.2020, 27.11.2020, 26.03.2021 and 03.04.2021 respectively were\n\nsent by the JRS Group/Kalpesh Parmar wherein SRG (Respondent\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 26 of 67\n\nNo.9) was marked and has not objected to the contents thereof or raised\n\nany grievance.\n\n• During the mediation process, the SRG Group had communicated\n\nthrough a JRS Group representative that it is ready and willing to\n\nperform its obligations under the FAA if its demand for an additional\n\nconsideration of Rs. 25 Crore for exit from Respondent No. 8 company\n\nis accepted by the AMP Group.\n\n28. The Counsel submitted that the execution of the terms of the FAA required\n\nthe involvement and action of the SRG Group while also benefitting them.\n\nIt was submitted that a perusal of the following clauses and schedules of the\n\nFAA would indicate that the transaction was one of separation of\n\nshareholding and businesses of the three groups viz AMP, JRS and SRG:\n\n• Clause 2.1.4 read with Schedule 7 provides that AMP Group would exit\n\nfrom Respondent No. 7 Company i.e. Millenium (where the SRG Group\n\nalready holds 40%) and that out of the 36% shares held by the AMP\n\nGroup, 11% will be purchased by the SRG Group and the remaining\n\n25% will be bought back by Respondent No. 7 Company. The valuation\n\nof Respondent No. 7 Company is provided as Rs. 130 crore.\n\n• Clause 2.1.6 read with Schedule 8 provides that the JRS and SRG\n\nGroups shall exit the Respondent No. 8 Company i.e. Deegee by selling\n\ntheir shares to the AMP Group. Sale proceeds received by the AMP\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 27 of 67\n\nGroup on its exit from the Respondent No. 7 company will be brought\n\ninto the Respondent No. 8 Company. The valuation of Respondent No.\n\n8 Company is provided as Rs. 141 Crore.\n\n• Clause 2.1.7 read with Item 10 of Schedule 3 provides that the AMP\n\nGroup shall withdraw CP 383/2017 filed against the Respondent No. 8\n\nCompany where Respondent No.9 is also a party.\n\n29. The counsel submitted that the Share Purchase Agreements (SPAs) were to\n\nbe executed to facilitate the implementation of Clauses 2.1.4 and 2.1.6\n\nrespectively of the FAA and the SRG Group would have been a party to the\n\nSPAs. This is evident from the draft SPAs and the same were forwarded\n\nspecifically to the respondent No.9 vide email dated 27.11.2020. That\n\naccording to the dispute resolution clause contained in Clauses 7.1 and 7.2\n\nrespectively, disputes between or amongst any of the parties in connection\n\nwith or arising out of the Transaction Documents can be amicably resolved\n\nand upon its failure, be resolved by arbitration. The term “Transaction\n\nDocuments” is defined as “means this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement\n\nand any and every document executed in connection with the transaction\n\ncontemplated under or in connection with this Agreement” and also\n\nincludes the SPAs to be executed inter alia the SRG Group, the drafts of\n\nwhich were forwarded to the SRG Group on 27.11.2020.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 28 of 67\n\n30. It was submitted that the AMP Group has conducted the due diligence of\n\nthe Respondent No.8 Company i.e., Deegee as contemplated in Clause\n\n2.1.6(b) of the FAA with the full knowledge and consent of the SRG Group.\n\nThe same is evident vide emails dated 01.07.2020, 23.10.2020, 10.04.2021\n\nand 15.04.2021 respectively. This demonstrated that the FAA had also been\n\npartly implemented qua the SRG Group which is in management of the said\n\ncompany.\n\n31. One another submission made by the counsel was that the nomenclature of\n\nthe agreement i.e., “Family Arrangement Agreement” is irrelevant. In\n\naddition to that, the description and obligation of the parties under the FAA\n\nis also irrelevant since most cases of non-signatory parties will involve\n\nagreements, the terms of which do not expressly include the non-signatory.\n\nIn support of the aforesaid, the counsel placed reliance on the decision of\n\nthis Court in\nSasan Power Ltd. v. North American Coal Corporation\n\n(India) Private Ltd.\nreported in (2016) 10 SCC 813 where it was settled\n\nthat the nomenclature of an agreement is not determinative of its character.\n\n32. The counsel submitted that while on many occasions the representatives of\n\nJRS Group were there to take care of the interests, suggestions and\n\ncomments of the SRG Group, it was understood by all the parties that the\n\nSRG Group although not a signatory to the FAA yet would be a part of the\n\nexecution of and compliance of the terms and conditions thereof. Therefore,\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 29 of 67\n\nthere was commonality of subject matter and composite transactions, in\n\nview of which SRG is a veritable party liable to be referred to arbitration.\n\n33. By placing a strong reliance on the decision of this Court in\nCox and Kings\n\nLtd. v. SAP India Pvt. Ltd.\nreported in (2024) 4 SCC 1, the counsel\n\nsubmitted that the settled position is that the referral court should leave it\n\nfor the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory party is indeed\n\na party to the arbitration agreement on the basis of factual evidence and\n\napplication of legal doctrine.\n\nHe submitted that the Delhi and Bombay High\n\nCourts have consistently taken a view to refer the parties, including the non-\n\nsignatories to arbitration in\nDLF Ltd. v. PNB Housing Finance Ltd.\n\nreported in (\n2024) SCC OnLine Del 2165, Moneywise Financial Services\n\n(P) Ltd. v. Dilip Jain\nreported in (2024) SCC OnLine Del 1896 and\n\nCardinal Energy and Infra Structure Pvt. Ltd. v. Subramanya\n\nConstruction & Development Co. Ltd. reported in (2024) SCC OnLine\n\nBom 964 by relying on this Court’s decision in\nCox and Kings\n(supra).\n\n34. The counsel finally submitted that it is critical to refer even the non-\n\nsignatory to arbitration since otherwise there is a risk that the non-signatory\n\nmay not appear before the Arbitral Tribunal and disregard its award as\n\nbeyond jurisdiction. In any event, the arbitrability of disputes qua the SRG\n\nGroup can always be considered by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 30 of 67\n\nC. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT (JRS\n\nGROUP)\n\n35. Ms. Anushree Prashit Kapadia the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe Respondent JRS Group submitted that while the JRS Group has no\n\nobjection to the adjudication of disputes with the AMP Group by arbitral\n\nproceedings presided by the Sole arbitrator nominated by the AMP Group,\n\nthe SRG Group cannot be a part of the arbitration proceedings as they are\n\nnot party to the FAA. It was also submitted that the FAA contained the\n\ndefinition of “Parties” and the SRG Group is not defined in the FAA. The\n\nAMP Group and JRS Group are family members, whereas, the SRG Group\n\nis not part of the family.\n\n36. The counsel submitted that the various clauses of the FAA indicate that the\n\nFAA binds only the AMP and JRS Groups. Clauses 2.1.4 and 2.1.6\n\nrespectively wherein the SRG Group is mentioned do not cast any\n\nobligations on the SRG Group since it merely states that “Parties shall\n\nexecute…” & “Parties shall ensure...”. There is also no exchange of\n\nconsideration with the SRG Group in the FAA.\n\n37. The counsel submitted that neither the JRS Group nor the chartered\n\naccountant, Mr. Kalpesh Parmar have ever represented the SRG Group,\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 31 of 67\n\nacted on their behalf or received any authority or power from the SRG\n\nGroup. There is no evidence on record or otherwise to the contrary.\n\n38. The counsel submitted that Clause 8.1 of the FAA on “Entire Agreement”\n\ncategorically states that the FAA superseded any and all prior oral and\n\nwritten agreements. Therefore, the case of the AMP Group that SRG Group\n\nwas effectively a part of the negotiations and is privy to the transactions is\n\ninconsequential.\n\n39. The counsel finally submitted that the AMP Group and JRS Group have\n\nfulfilled part of their respective obligations under the FAA and are in a\n\nposition to fully execute the FAA without the presence or role of the SRG\n\nGroup. Clause 8.7 dealing with Partial Validity empowers the severance of\n\ninvalid or unenforceable provisions of the FAA.\n\nD. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT (SRG\n\nGROUP)\n\n40. Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nRespondent SRG Group submitted that the present petition is merely a\n\ndevice to embroil strangers into an agreement entered into between two\n\ngroups of the same family since the SRG Group is admittedly neither a party\n\nnor signatory or confirming party to the FAA or the alleged arbitration\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 32 of 67\n\nagreement contained therein. The AMP and JRS Groups who are\n\nsignatories thereto are ad idem about the terms of the FAA, including their\n\nmutual intention to refer the disputes arising from it to arbitration. Had the\n\nSRG Group been involved in the negotiations leading to the signing of the\n\nFAA, or participated therein, or expressed its inclination to be bound by the\n\narbitration agreement, the same would have been recorded in the FAA.\n\n41. The counsel submitted that the fact that the FAA had always been intended\n\nto operate inter se the AMP and JRS Groups is borne from a bare perusal\n\nof the clauses of the FAA itself which only confers rights or fastens\n\nobligations upon the said Groups.\n\n• Recital F specifically records that the AMP and JRS Groups “after mutual\n\ndiscussions and negotiations have agreed to settle all disputes/issues that\n\nhave arisen amongst the parties over last several years …. on the terms\n\nand conditions as mutually agreed to”.\n\n• Clauses 2.1.4 and 2.1.6 read with Schedules 7 and 8 which relate to the exit\n\nof AMP Group from Millenium and the exit of JRS and SRG Groups from\n\nDeegee contain a mere reference to the SRG Group wherein the foremost\n\nwords used read as “In connection with the … Exit, the Parties agree…” –\n\nthereby placing the obligation to exit and/or ensure such exit solely upon\n\nthe AMP or JRS Groups, as the case may be. None of these clauses indicate\n\neither the consent or agreement of the SRG Group in this regard.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 33 of 67\n\n• Further, in Clause 2.1.7, the FAA places an obligation to unconditionally\n\nwithdraw all litigations solely on the AMP and JRS Groups.\n\n42. The counsel submitted that the arbitration clause contained in the FAA by\n\nitself makes a reference only to the parties to the FAA inasmuch as it sets\n\nout the negotiation or dispute resolution mechanism or appointment\n\nprocedure to be followed by the parties alone, and importantly, the factum\n\nthat the AMP and JRS Groups shall continue to perform their respective\n\nobligations under the FAA, subject to the termination of the FAA. At no\n\npoint does the arbitration agreement make any reference to the SRG Group\n\nnor does it fasten any obligations to be performed by it.\n\n43. It was further submitted that there is no defined legal relationship between\n\nthe SRG Group and the petitioners to justify the application of\nSection 7(1)\n\nof the Act, 1996. In other words, there is no ‘arbitration agreement’ between\n\nthem either in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form\n\nof a separate agreement in terms of sub-sections (2) to (5) of\nsection 7\nof\n\nthe Act, 1996. In fact, there is no contract at all between them and\n\nconsequently, there is no privity of contract between the Petitioners and\n\nSRG Group in any manner whatsoever.\n\n44. It was also submitted that bringing non-signatories within the scope of the\n\narbitration agreement is an exception and not the rule.\nIn support of this, the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 34 of 67\n\ncounsel relied on the decision of this Court in\nCox & Kings\n(supra).\n\nFurther, it was submitted that a dual test has to be satisfied to compel the\n\nSRG Group to be a party to the present arbitration proceedings i.e., (a) SRG\n\nGroup should be shown to have agreed to the underlying contract and (b)\n\nSRG Group should also be shown to have agreed to be bound by the\n\narbitration agreement. Both the conditions are not satisfied. A vague\n\nawareness of the JRS and AMP Groups being in negotiations or the mere\n\nmarking of emails relating thereto to a member of the SRG Group cannot\n\nimply consent. It was submitted that the SRG Group is neither a consensual\n\nor non-consensual participant in the arbitration proceedings arising out of\n\nthe FAA nor have any of the aforementioned consensual or non-consensual\n\ntheories been invoked by the petitioners. To compel a party to arbitration in\n\nrespect of a family arrangement despite the fact that they are not a member\n\nof the family would sound the death knell to the concept of party autonomy\n\nand freedom of contract.\n\n45. The counsel submitted that apart from co-ownership or common\n\nshareholding in Millenium and Deegee, the SRG Group has no business\n\nrelationship or dealings or common interest with either of the other groups.\n\nSince the subject-matter in question is with respect to the implementation\n\nof the FAA, there is no doubt that the same can be effectively implemented\n\nwithout the participation of the SRG Group in the arbitration proceedings.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 35 of 67\n\nWithout prejudice to the above, the counsel submitted that severing the only\n\ntwo sub-clauses that merely make a reference to the SRG Group, without\n\nplacing any obligation thereupon i.e., Clauses 2.1.4 and 2.1.6 would in no\n\nway impact the implementation of the FAA.\n\n46. It was submitted that the negotiations leading to the signing of the FAA\n\nwere initiated at the behest of one Premji Group in the BVC deal that took\n\nplace between the Premji Group, the JRS Group and other shareholders.\n\nSurprisingly, despite disputes having arisen regarding a similar exit of the\n\nJRS Group from BVC, neither BVC nor the Premji Group have been roped\n\nin as participants in the FAA. However, the AMP Group, for reasons best\n\nknown to itself, has sought participation of the SRG Group on the feeble\n\npretext of ensuring exits from Millenium and Deegee.\n\n47. The counsel also submitted that the SRG Group was not a party to the\n\nmediation proceedings since vide email dated 20.12.2021, the AMP Group\n\ninvoked mediation as per clause 7.1.2 of the FAA only against the JRS\n\nGroup for resolving disputes between themselves. It has been admitted in\n\nthe same email that the AMP Group had no contact with the SRG Group\n\nregarding any SPAs for Millenium and Deegee or otherwise and the AMP\n\nGroup even castigated the JRS Group for pushing pending obligations inter\n\nse the parties on the SRG Group when “the SRG group is not even a party\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 36 of 67\n\nto the FAA”. The minutes of the 1st mediation meeting dated 19.01.2022\n\nalso reflect that the same was not attended by the members or\n\nrepresentatives of the SRG Group. The counsel further submitted that when\n\nthe negotiations were resumed for the second time vide email dated\n\n23.05.2022, the SRG Group neither attended nor was represented in the\n\nsame.\n\n48. The counsel submitted that the SRG Group at no point of time, appointed,\n\nengaged or authorised, either the JRS Group or Mr. Kalpesh Parmar to\n\nundertake any actions or make any representations on its behalf or bind it\n\nto any agreement that has been entered into by and between the AMP and\n\nJRS Groups either expressly or impliedly. It was submitted that even as per\n\nthe petitioners’ own case, the so called joint meeting dated 14.01.2020 that\n\nwas arranged by Mr. Kalpesh Parmar was done so by him representing the\n\nJRS Group and “was attended by Mr. Ashit Patel for AMP Group and\n\nRespondent No.9 of the SRG Group”. Therefore, the petitioners cannot blow\n\nhot and cold and allege that Mr. Parmar also attended in the capacity of a\n\nrepresentative of the SRG Group. Further, the JRS Group itself nominated\n\nMr. Kalpesh Parmar as its representative for mediation vide email dated\n\n26.12.2021 and therefore, it is not proper for the petitioners to contend that\n\nthe SRG Group was represented by Mr. Kalpesh Parmar or the JRS Group.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 37 of 67\n\n49. The counsel submitted that the Notice invoking arbitration sent by the JRS\n\nGroup on 11.12.2023 was not addressed to the SRG Group. Only in the\n\nReply to the Arbitration Notice issued by the AMP Group on 12.01.2024,\n\nthe SRG Group was marked and this is the first instance that the AMP\n\nGroup alluded to the SRG Group as a participant in the FAA and that to\n\nafter a span of almost 4 years. This, according to him, was clearly an\n\nafterthought.\n\n50. The counsel in the last submitted that, in the facts of the present case, even\n\nthe prima facie threshold required to be met to warrant joinder of non-\n\nparties to arbitral proceedings, either by the referral court or by an arbitral\n\ntribunal, has not been met.\n\nE. ANALYSIS\n\n51. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone\n\nthrough the materials on record, the only question that falls for our\n\nconsideration is whether the SRG Group, being a non-signatory to the FAA,\n\nshould also be referred to arbitration along with the AMP and JRS Groups?\n\ni. Scope of jurisdiction of the referral court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\n\nAct, 1996\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 38 of 67\n\n52. A plethora of decisions have deliberated upon the scope of the Court’s\n\njurisdiction and the role to be played by the referral court in the appointment\n\nof an arbitrator. The position on this question was starkly different prior to\n\nand post the 2015 Amendment to the 1996, Act.\n\n53. A seven-Judge Bench of this Court in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.\n\nreported in (2005) 8 SCC 618, held that the power under\nSection 11\nof the\n\nAct, 1996 was not an administrative but a judicial power. Therefore, it was\n\nopined that the Chief Justice or his designate under Section 11(6) had the\n\nright to decide preliminary issues including his own jurisdiction, to\n\nentertain the request, the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the\n\nexistence or otherwise of a live claim, the existence of the condition for the\n\nexercise of his power and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or\n\narbitrators. The relevant observations are reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“47. We, therefore, sum up our conclusions as follows:\n\n(i) The power exercised by the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt or the Chief Justice of India under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nAct is not an administrative power. It is a judicial power.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(iv) The Chief Justice or the designated Judge will have the\nright to decide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the\nearlier part of this judgment. These will be his own\njurisdiction to entertain the request, the existence of a valid\narbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise of a live\nclaim, the existence of the condition for the exercise of his\npower and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 39 of 67\n\narbitrators. The Chief Justice or the designated Judge would\nbe entitled to seek the opinion of an institution in the matter\nof nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of\nSection\n11(8)\nof the Act if the need arises but the order appointing\nthe arbitrator could only be that of the Chief Justice or the\ndesignated Judge.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(ix) In a case where an Arbitral Tribunal has been\nconstituted by the parties without having recourse to\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act, the Arbitral Tribunal will have the\njurisdiction to decide all matters as contemplated by\nSection\nof the Act.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(xii) … The decision in Konkan Rly.\nCorpn. Ltd. v. Rani\nConstruction (P) Ltd.\n[(2002) 2 SCC 388] is overruled.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n54. While further reinforcing the view taken in SBP & Co. (supra), this Court\n\nin\nNational Insurance Company Limited v. Boghara Polyfab Private Ltd\n\nreported in (2009) 1 SCC 267 identified and segregated the three categories\n\nof preliminary issues that may arise for consideration in an application\n\nunder Section 11 as follows:\n\n“22. Where the intervention of the court is sought for\nappointment of an Arbitral Tribunal under Section 11, the\nduty of the Chief Justice or his designate is defined in SBP &\nCo. [(2005) 8 SCC 618] This Court identified and\nsegregated the preliminary issues that may arise for\nconsideration in an application under\nSection 11\nof the Act\ninto three categories, that is, (i) issues which the Chief\nJustice or his designate is bound to decide; (ii) issues which\nhe can also decide, that is, issues which he may choose to\ndecide; and (iii) issues which should be left to the Arbitral\nTribunal to decide.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 40 of 67\n\n22.1. The issues (first category) which the Chief Justice/his\ndesignate will have to decide are:\n\n(a) Whether the party making the application has\napproached the appropriate High Court.\n\n(b) Whether there is an arbitration agreement and whether\nthe party who has applied under\nSection 11\nof the Act, is a\nparty to such an agreement.\n\n22.2. The issues (second category) which the Chief\nJustice/his designate may choose to decide (or leave them to\nthe decision of the Arbitral Tribunal) are:\n\n(a) Whether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or a live\nclaim.\n\n(b) Whether the parties have concluded the\ncontract/transaction by recording satisfaction of their\nmutual rights and obligation or by receiving the final\npayment without objection.\n\n22.3. The issues (third category) which the Chief Justice/his\ndesignate should leave exclusively to the Arbitral Tribunal\nare:\n\n(i) Whether a claim made falls within the arbitration clause\n(as for example, a matter which is reserved for final decision\nof a departmental authority and excepted or excluded from\narbitration).\n\n(ii) Merits or any claim involved in the arbitration.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n55. On a closer look at the categories delineated in the aforesaid decision, it can\n\nbe seen that the issues in the first category have to be mandatorily decided\n\nby the Chief Justice or his designate under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996. This\n\nincluded the question whether there is an arbitration agreement and whether\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 41 of 67\n\nthe party that has applied under Section 11 is also a party to such an\n\nagreement.\n\n56. Later, on the suggestion of the 246th Report of the Law Commission of\n\nIndia, Section 11(6A) was inserted through the 2015 Amendment to the\n\nAct, 1996. The wide jurisdiction afforded to the referral courts by the\n\ndecisions in SBP & Co (supra) and\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra) was\n\nlegislatively overruled by virtue of the non-obstante clause incorporated in\n\nSection 11(6A). Although the 2019 Amendment to the Act, 1996 omitted\n\nSection 11(6A), such an omission was not notified and therefore Section\n\n11(6A) still remains in force and reads thus:\n\n“(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the\nHigh Court, while considering any application Under\nSub-section (4) or Sub-section (5) or Sub-section (6),\nshall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of\nany Court, confine to the examination of the existence of\nan arbitration agreement.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n57. The crucial question that arose for consideration by this Court in\nDuro\n\nFelguera S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Limited\nreported in (2017) 9 SCC 729\n\nwas the effect of the change introduced by the 2015 Amendment to the Act,\n\n1996 which inserted Section 11(6A). The Court held that all that needs to\n\nbe looked into is whether the agreement contained a Clause which provides\n\nfor arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the\n\nparties to the agreement i.e., the existence of the arbitration agreement,\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 42 of 67\n\nnothing more, nothing less. The relevant observations are extracted\n\nhereinbelow:\n\n“48[…] From a reading of Section 11(6-A), the intention of\nthe legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should and need\nonly look into one aspect—the existence of an arbitration\nagreement. What are the factors for deciding as to whether\nthere is an arbitration agreement is the next question. The\nresolution to that is simple—it needs to be seen if the\nagreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration\npertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the\nparties to the agreement.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n59. The scope of the power under Section 11(6) of the 1996\nAct was considerably wide in view of the decisions in SBP\nand Co. [SBP and Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC\n618] and Boghara Polyfab [National Insurance Co.\nLtd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009)\n1 SCC (Civ) 117] . This position continued till the\namendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all\nthat the courts need to see is whether an arbitration\nagreement exists—nothing more, nothing less. The\nlegislative policy and purpose is essentially to minimise the\nCourt's intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator\nand this intention as incorporated in Section 11(6-A) ought\nto be respected.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n58. A two Judge-Bench of this Court in\nGarware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal\n\nMarine Constructions & Engineering Ltd.\nreported in (2019) 9 SCC 209\n\nconsidered the effect of Section 11(6A) which confined the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Court to examine the “existence of an arbitration agreement” on an\n\narbitration agreement contained in an unstamped document or contract. The\n\nCourt was of the opinion that its enquiry as to whether a compulsorily\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 43 of 67\n\nstampable document, which contains the arbitration clause, is duly stamped\n\nor not, is only an enquiry into whether such an arbitration agreement exists\n\nin law and this does not in any manner amount to deciding “preliminary\n\nquestion(s)” that arise between the parties. However, in deciding so, the\n\nCourt maintained that a referral court must confine itself to the question of\n\nexistence of the arbitration agreement and observed as thus:\n\n“14. A reading of the Law Commission Report, together with\nthe Statement of Objects and Reasons, shows that the Law\nCommission felt that the judgments in SBP & Co. [SBP &\nCo. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara\nPolyfab [National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab\n(P) Ltd., (2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 117]\nrequired a relook, as a result of which, so far as Section 11\nis concerned, the Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the\nHigh Court, while considering any application under\nSections 11(4) to 11(6) is to confine itself to the examination\nof the existence of an arbitration agreement and leave all\nother preliminary issues to be decided by the\narbitrator. […]”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n59. Once again, a three-judge bench of this Court in\nVidya Drolia and Ors. v.\n\nDurga Trading Corporation\nreported in (2021) 2 SCC 1 held that Sections\n\n8 and 11 respectively must be read as laying down a similar standard on the\n\nscope of the referral court’s powers. It was stated that the questions as\n\nregards the existence and validity being intertwined, an arbitration\n\nagreement does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy mandatory legal\n\nrequirements. The decision endorsed the application of a prima facie test in\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 44 of 67\n\nexamining the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement both under\n\nSections 8 and 11. This prima facie examination was not a full review but\n\na primary first review to weed out manifest and ex-facie non-existent and\n\ninvalid arbitration agreements and non-arbitrable disputes. However, it was\n\nclarified that the Court should not get lost in thickets and decide debatable\n\nquestions of fact. The relevant extract is reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“153. Accordingly, we hold that the expression “existence of\nan arbitration agreement” in\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration\nAct, would include aspect of validity of an arbitration\nagreement, albeit the court at the referral stage would apply\nthe prima facie test on the basis of principles set out in this\njudgment. In cases of debatable and disputable facts, and\ngood reasonable arguable case, etc., the court would force\nthe parties to abide by the arbitration agreement as the\nArbitral Tribunal has primary jurisdiction and authority to\ndecide the disputes including the question of jurisdiction and\nnon-arbitrability.”\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n60.\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) while speaking in the context of Section 8 also pointed\n\nout that jurisdictional issues like whether certain parties are bound by the\n\narbitration agreement must be left to the arbitral tribunal since they involve\n\ncomplicated factual questions and observed as thus:\n\n“239. […] Jurisdictional issues concerning whether certain\nparties are bound by a particular arbitration, under group-\ncompany doctrine or good faith, etc., in a multi-party\narbitration raises complicated factual questions, which are\nbest left for the tribunal to handle.[…]”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 45 of 67\n\n61. A Constitution Bench of this Court in In Re: Interplay Between Arbitration\n\nAgreements under\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nand\nStamp Act,\nreported in (2024) 6 SCC 1, stated that an arbitration agreement\n\ncontained in an unstamped or insufficiently stamped contract would not be\n\nnon-existent in law as stated in\nGarware Wall Ropes\n(supra).\n\nIt also\n\nclarified the position taken in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) and stated that the\n\nparameters for judicial review under Sections 8 and 11 respectively were\n\ndifferent. The scope of examination under Section 11(6) should be confined\n\nto the “existence of the arbitration agreement” under\nSection 7\nof the Act,\n\n1996. Similarly, the “validity of an arbitration agreement” must be\n\nrestricted to the requirement of formal validity such as the requirement that\n\nthe agreement be in writing. Substantive objections pertaining to existence\n\nand validity on the basis of evidence must therefore be left to the arbitral\n\ntribunal. Moreover, it was stated that the expression “examination” under\n\nSection 11 does not connote or imply a laborious or contested inquiry. On\n\nthe other hand, Section 16 provides that the arbitral tribunal can “rule” on\n\nits jurisdiction, including the existence and validity of an arbitration\n\nagreement. It was also stated that any prima facie opinion rendered by the\n\nCourt under Section 11 need not bind the arbitral tribunal. The relevant\n\nobservations are extracted hereinbelow:\n\n“164. The 2015 Amendment Act has laid down different\nparameters for judicial review under Section 8 and Section\n\n11. Where Section 8 requires the Referral Court to look into\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 46 of 67\n\nthe prima facie existence of a valid arbitration agreement,\nSection 11 confines the Court's jurisdiction to the\nexamination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.\nAlthough the object and purpose behind both Sections 8 and\n11 is to compel parties to abide by their contractual\nunderstanding, the scope of power of the Referral Courts\nunder the said provisions is intended to be different. The\nsame is also evident from the fact that\nSection 37\nof the\nArbitration Act allows an appeal from the order of an\nArbitral Tribunal refusing to refer the parties to arbitration\nunder Section 8, but not from Section 11. Thus, the 2015\nAmendment Act has legislatively overruled the dictum\nof Patel Engg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC\n618] where it was held that Section 8 and Section 11 are\ncomplementary in nature. Accordingly, the two provisions\ncannot be read as laying down a similar standard.\n\n165. The legislature confined the scope of reference under\nSection 11(6-A) to the examination of the existence of an\narbitration agreement. The use of the term “examination” in\nitself connotes that the scope of the power is limited to a\nprima facie determination. Since the Arbitration Act is a self-\n\ncontained code, the requirement of “existence” of an\narbitration agreement draws effect from\nSection 7\nof the\nArbitration Act.\nIn\nDuro Felguera [Duro Felguera,\nS.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4\nSCC (Civ) 764] , this Court held that the Referral Courts\nonly need to consider one aspect to determine the existence\nof an arbitration agreement — whether the underlying\ncontract contains an arbitration agreement which provides\nfor arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen\nbetween the parties to the agreement. Therefore, the scope of\nexamination under Section 11(6-A) should be confined to the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of Section\n\n7. Similarly, the validity of an arbitration agreement, in view\nof Section 7, should be restricted to the requirement of\nformal validity such as the requirement that the agreement\nbe in writing. This interpretation also gives true effect to the\ndoctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of\nsubstantive existence and validity of an arbitration\nagreement to be decided by Arbitral Tribunal under Section\n\n16. We accordingly clarify the position of law\nlaid down\nin\n\nVidya Drolia [Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n,\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 47 of 67\n\n(2021) 2 SCC 1 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 549] in the context of\nSection 8 and\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n166. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration\nagreement generally lies on the party seeking to rely on such\nagreement. In jurisdictions such as India, which accept the\ndoctrine of competence-competence, only prima facie proof\nof the existence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced\nbefore the Referral Court. The Referral Court is not the\nappropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial by allowing the\nparties to adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement. The determination of\nthe existence and validity of an arbitration agreement on the\nbasis of evidence ought to be left to the Arbitral Tribunal.\nThis position of law can also be gauged from the plain\nlanguage of the statute.\n\n167. Section 11(6-A) uses the expression “examination of the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement”. The purport of using\nthe word “examination” connotes that the legislature\nintends that the Referral Court has to inspect or scrutinise\nthe dealings between the parties for the existence of an\narbitration agreement. Moreover, the expression\n“examination” does not connote or imply a laborious or\ncontested inquiry. [ P. Ramanatha Aiyar, The Law\nLexicon (2nd Edn., 1997) 666.] On the other hand, Section\n16 provides that the Arbitral Tribunal can “rule” on its\njurisdiction, including the existence and validity of an\narbitration agreement. A “ruling” connotes adjudication of\ndisputes after admitting evidence from the parties.\nTherefore, it is evident that the Referral Court is only\nrequired to examine the existence of arbitration agreements,\nwhereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its\njurisdiction, including the issues pertaining to the existence\nand validity of an arbitration agreement.[…]\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n169. When the Referral Court renders a prima facie opinion,\nneither the Arbitral Tribunal, nor the Court enforcing the\narbitral award will be bound by such a prima facie view. If\na prima facie view as to the existence of an arbitration\nagreement is taken by the Referral Court, it still allows the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 48 of 67\n\nArbitral Tribunal to examine the issue in depth. Such a legal\napproach will help the Referral Court in weeding out prima\nfacie non-existent arbitration agreements. It will also protect\nthe jurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunals to\ndecide on issues pertaining to the existence and validity of\nan arbitration agreement.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n62. This very Bench in SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish Spinning\n\nreported in (2024) SCC OnLine SC 1754 dealt with the scope and standard\n\nof judicial scrutiny in an application made under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act,\n\n1996 specifically when a plea of “accord and satisfaction” is taken by the\n\ndefendant. It was observed that in a scenario where the Courts delve into\n\nthe domain of the arbitral tribunal at the Section 11 stage and reject the\n\napplication, there is a risk of leaving the claimant forum-less for the\n\nadjudication of its claims. It was stated that a detailed examination at this\n\nstage would also be counterproductive to the objective of expediency in\n\ndeciding a Section 11 application and simplification of pleadings. It was\n\nalso stated that even if ex-facie frivolity is made out by the referral court,\n\nthe arbitral tribunal has the benefit of extensive pleadings and evidentiary\n\nmaterial and therefore, it would be incorrect to doubt that the arbitral\n\ntribunal would not be able to arrive at a similar conclusion. The relevant\n\nobservations are reproduced hereinbelow:\n\n“123. The power available to the referral courts has to be\nconstrued in the light of the fact that no right to appeal is\navailable against any order passed by the referral court\nunder Section 11 for either appointing or refusing to appoint\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 49 of 67\n\nan arbitrator. Thus, by delving into the domain of the arbitral\ntribunal at the nascent stage of Section 11, the referral courts\nalso run the risk of leaving the claimant in a situation\nwherein it does not have any forum to approach for the\nadjudication of its claims, if it Section 11 application is\nrejected.\n\n124. Section 11 also envisages a time-bound and expeditious\ndisposal of the application for appointment of arbitrator.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is also the fact that unlike Section\n8, once an application under Section 11 is filed, arbitration\ncannot commence until the arbitral tribunal is constituted by\nthe referral court. This Court, on various occasions, has\ngiven directions to the High Courts for expeditious disposal\nof pending Section 11 applications. It has also directed the\nlitigating parties to refrain from filing bulky pleadings in\nmatters pertaining to Section 11. Seen thus, if the referral\ncourts go into the details of issues pertaining to “accord and\nsatisfaction” and the like, then it would become rather\ndifficult to achieve the objective of expediency and\nsimplification of pleadings.\n\n125. We are also of the view that ex-facie frivolity and\ndishonesty in litigation is an aspect which the arbitral\ntribunal is equally, if not more, capable to decide upon the\nappreciation of the evidence adduced by the parties. We say\nso because the arbitral tribunal has the benefit of going\nthrough all the relevant evidence and pleadings in much\nmore detail than the referral court. If the referral court is\nable to see the frivolity in the litigation on the basis of bare\nminimum pleadings, then it would be incorrect to doubt that\nthe arbitral tribunal would not be able to arrive at the same\ninference, most likely in the first few hearings itself, with the\nbenefit of extensive pleadings and evidentiary material.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n63. The recent Constitution Bench decision of this Court in\nCox and Kings\n\nLimited v. SAP India Private Limited and Another\nreported in (2024) 4\n\nSCC 1, specifically dealt with the question of impleading a non-signatory\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 50 of 67\n\nas a party in the arbitration proceedings and the corresponding scope of\n\nenquiry at the referral stage. It was held therein that Section 16 is an\n\ninclusive provision which comprehends all preliminary issues touching\n\nupon the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and the issue of determining\n\nparties to an arbitration agreement goes to the very root of the jurisdictional\n\ncompetence of the arbitral tribunal. The relevant observations are\n\nreproduced hereinbelow:\n\n163.\nSection 16\nof the Arbitration Act enshrines the principle\nof competence-competence in Indian arbitration law. The\nprovision empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own\njurisdiction, including any ruling on any objections with\nrespect to the existence or validity of arbitration agreement.\n\nSection 16 is an inclusive provision which comprehends all\npreliminary issues touching upon the jurisdiction of the\nArbitral Tribunal. [\nUttarakhand Purv Sainik Kalyan Nigam\nLtd. v. Northern Coal Field Ltd.\n, (2020) 2 SCC 455 : (2020)\n1 SCC (Civ) 570] The doctrine of competence-competence is\nintended to minimise judicial intervention at the threshold\nstage. The issue of determining parties to an arbitration\nagreement goes to the very root of the jurisdictional\ncompetence of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n169. In case of joinder of non-signatory parties to an\narbitration agreement, the following two scenarios will\nprominently emerge : first, where a signatory party to an\narbitration agreement seeks joinder of a non-signatory party\nto the arbitration agreement; and second, where a non-\nsignatory party itself seeks invocation of an arbitration\nagreement. In both the scenarios, the referral court will be\nrequired to prima facie rule on the existence of the\narbitration agreement and whether the non-signatory is a\nveritable party to the arbitration agreement. In view of the\ncomplexity of such a determination, the referral court should\nleave it for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the non-\nsignatory party is indeed a party to the arbitration agreement\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 51 of 67\n\non the basis of the factual evidence and application of legal\ndoctrine. The Tribunal can delve into the factual,\ncircumstantial, and legal aspects of the matter to decide\nwhether its jurisdiction extends to the non-signatory party. In\nthe process, the Tribunal should comply with the\nrequirements of principles of natural justice such as giving\nopportunity to the non-signatory to raise objections with\nregard to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. This\ninterpretation also gives true effect to the doctrine of\ncompetence-competence by leaving the issue of\ndetermination of true parties to an arbitration agreement to\nbe decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 16.\n\n170. In view of the discussion above, we arrive at the\nfollowing conclusions:\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n(170.12) At the referral stage, the referral court should leave\nit for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the non-\nsignatory is bound by the arbitration agreement […]”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n64. Therefore, on the pivotal issue whether the non-signatories can be referred\n\nto arbitration, this Court took the view that the referral court is required to\n\nprima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration agreement and whether\n\nthe non-signatory party is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement.\n\nHowever, recognising the complexity of such a determination, the arbitral\n\ntribunal was considered the proper forum since it can decide whether the\n\nnon-signatory is a party to the arbitration agreement on the basis of factual\n\nevidence and application of legal doctrine. In this process, the non-\n\nsignatory must also be given an opportunity to raise objections regarding\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 52 of 67\n\nthe jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal in accordance with the principles of\n\nnatural justice.\n\n65. The position of law that emerges from the aforesaid discussion can be\n\nsummarized as follows;\n\n• SBP & Co. (supra) expanded the scope of the Court’s power under\n\nSection 11 while empowering the referral courts to decide several\n\npreliminary issues.\nBoghara Polyfab\n(supra) went to the extent of\n\nidentifying three categories of preliminary issues that may arise for\n\nconsideration in an application under Section 11. Of these, in the first\n\ncategory which had to be mandatorily decided by the referral Court, the\n\nquestion whether there was an arbitration agreement and whether the\n\nparty who has applied under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 is a party to such\n\nan agreement, was also included.\n\n• The insertion of Section 11(6A) through the 2015 Amendment to the Act,\n\n1996 stipulated that the Courts under Section 11 shall confine their\n\nexamination to the ‘existence’ of an arbitration agreement. It legislatively\n\noverruled the decisions in SBP & Co. (supra) and\nBoghara Polyfab\n\n(supra) by virtue of its non-obstante clause.\n\n•\nDuro Felguera\n(supra), in clear terms, clarified the effect of the change\n\nbrought in by Section 11(6A) and stated that all that the Courts need to\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 53 of 67\n\nsee is whether an arbitration agreement exists - nothing more, nothing\n\nless.\n\n•\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) endorsed the prima facie test in examining the\n\nexistence and validity of an arbitration agreement both under Sections 8\n\nand 11 respectively. However, it was clarified that in cases of debatable\n\nand disputable facts and reasonably good arguable case, etc. the Court\n\nmay refer the parties to arbitration since the arbitral tribunal has the\n\nauthority to decide disputes including the question of jurisdiction. It was\n\nfurther stated that jurisdictional issues concerning whether certain parties\n\nare bound by a particular arbitration under the group-company doctrine\n\netc. in a multi-party arbitration raise complicated questions of fact which\n\nare best left to the tribunal to decide.\n\n• In In Re: Interplay (supra) the position taken in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra)\n\nwas clarified to state that the scope of examination under Section 11(6)\n\nshould be confined to the “existence of the arbitration agreement” under\n\nSection 7\nof the Act, 1996 and the “validity of an arbitration agreement”\n\nmust be restricted to the requirement of formal validity such as the\n\nrequirement that the agreement be in writing. Therefore, substantive\n\nobjections pertaining to existence and validity on the basis of evidence\n\nmust be left to the arbitral tribunal since it can “rule” on its own\n\njurisdiction.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 54 of 67\n\n• Krish Spinning (supra) cautioned that the Courts delving into the\n\ndomain of the arbitral tribunal at the Section 11 stage run the risk of\n\nleaving the claimant remediless if the Section 11 application is rejected.\n\nFurther, it was stated that a detailed examination by the courts at the\n\nSection 11 stage would be counterproductive to the objective of\n\nexpeditious disposal of Section 11 application and simplification of\n\npleadings at that stage.\n\n•\nCox and Kings\n(supra) specifically dealt with the scope of inquiry under\n\nSection 11 when it comes to impleading the non-signatories in the\n\narbitration proceedings. While saying that the referral court would be\n\nrequired to prima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration agreement\n\nand whether the non-signatory party is a veritable party to the arbitration\n\nagreement, it also said that in view of the complexity in such a\n\ndetermination, the arbitral tribunal would be the proper forum. It was\n\nfurther stated that the issue of determining parties to an arbitration\n\nagreement goes to the very root of the jurisdictional competence of the\n\narbitral tribunal and can be decided under its jurisdiction under Section\n\n16.\n\nii. Whether on a prima facie view, the SRG Group being a non-\n\nsignatory to the FAA, can be referred to arbitration?\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 55 of 67\n\n66. It is well settled that an arbitration agreement, in order to qualify as a valid\n\nagreement, has to satisfy the requirements stipulated under\nSection 7\nof the\n\nAct, 1996 along with the principles of law under the\nIndian Contract Act,\n. Having regard to the submissions of both the Respondent Groups i.e.,\n\nJRS and SRG, it can be said that they have raised manifold objections to\n\nthe present petition, however, none of those objections question or deny the\n\nexistence of the arbitration agreement under which the arbitration has been\n\ninvoked by the Petitioner AMP Group. In fact, the JRS Group has no\n\nobjection to resolve the disputes with the AMP Group by way of arbitration.\n\nTheir primary objection is only that the SRG Group cannot be a part of the\n\narbitration proceedings. Therefore, the requirement of prima facie existence\n\nof an arbitration agreement, as stated under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996 is\n\nsatisfied.\n\n67. However, the core issue that falls for our consideration is whether the SRG\n\nGroup, being a non-signatory to the FAA can also be referred to arbitration\n\nand whether they are “veritable” parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\n68. This Court in\nCox and Kings\n(supra) held that the definition of “parties”\n\nunder\nSection 2(1)(h)\nread with\nSection 7\nof the Act, 1996 includes both\n\nthe signatory as well as non-signatory parties. Persons or entities who have\n\nnot formally signed the arbitration agreement or the underlying contract\n\ncontaining the arbitration agreement may also intend to be bound by the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 56 of 67\n\nterms of the agreement. Further, the requirement of a written agreement\n\nunder\nSection 7\nof the Act, 1996 does not exclude the possibility of binding\n\nnon-signatory parties if there is a defined legal relationship between the\n\nsignatory and non-signatory parties. Therefore, the issue as to who is a\n\n“party” to an arbitration agreement is primarily an issue of consent. Actions\n\nor conduct could be an indicator of the consent of a party to be bound by\n\nthe arbitration agreement. This aspect is also evident from a reading of\n\nSection 7(4)(b) which emphasises on the manifestation of the consent of\n\npersons or entities through actions of exchanging documents.\n\nThe relevant\n\nobservations made in\nCox and Kings\n(supra) are extracted hereinbelow:\n\n“83. Reading\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act in view of the\nabove discussion gives rise to the following conclusions\n: first, arbitration agreements arise out of a legal\nrelationship between or among persons or entities which\nmay be contractual or otherwise; second, in situations where\nthe legal relationship is contractual in nature, the nature of\nrelationship can be determined on the basis of general\ncontract law principles; third, it is not necessary for the\npersons or entities to be signatories to the arbitration\nagreement to be bound by it; fourth, in case of non-signatory\nparties, the important determination for the Courts is\nwhether the persons or entities intended or consented to be\nbound by the arbitration agreement or the underlying\ncontract containing the arbitration agreement through their\nacts or conduct; fifth, the requirement of a written\narbitration agreement has to be adhered to strictly, but the\nform in which such agreement is recorded is\nirrelevant; sixth, the requirement of a written arbitration\nagreement does not exclude the possibility of binding non-\nsignatory parties if there is a defined legal relationship\nbetween the signatory and non-signatory parties;\nand seventh, once the validity of an arbitration agreement is\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 57 of 67\n\nestablished, the Court or tribunal can determine the issue of\nwhich parties are bound by such agreement.”\n\n84. It is presumed that the formal signatories to an\narbitration agreement are parties who will be bound by it.\n\nHowever, in exceptional cases persons or entities who have\nnot signed or formally assented to a written arbitration\nagreement or the underlying contract containing the\narbitration agreement may be held to be bound by such\nagreement. As mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the\ndoctrine of privity limits the imposition of rights and\nliabilities on third parties to a contract. Generally, only the\nparties to an arbitration agreement can be subject to the full\neffects of the agreement in terms of the reliefs and remedies\nbecause they consented to be bound by the arbitration\nagreement. Therefore, the decisive question before the\nCourts or tribunals is whether a non-signatory consented to\nbe bound by the arbitration agreement. To determine\nwhether a non-signatory is bound by an arbitration\nagreement, the Courts and tribunals apply typical principles\nof contract law and corporate law. The legal doctrines\nprovide a framework for evaluating the specific contractual\nlanguage and the factual settings to determine the intentions\nof the parties to be bound by the arbitration agreement. [\nGary Born, International Arbitration Law and Practice, (3rd\nEdn., 2021) at p. 1531.]\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n170. In view of the discussion above, we arrive at the\nfollowing conclusions:\n\n170.1. The definition of “parties” under\nSection 2(1)(h)\nread\nwith\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act includes both the\nsignatory as well as non-signatory parties;\n\n170.2. Conduct of the non-signatory parties could be an\nindicator of their consent to be bound by the arbitration\nagreement;\n\n170.3. The requirement of a written arbitration agreement\nunder Section 7 does not exclude the possibility of binding\nnon-signatory parties;[…]”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 58 of 67\n\n69. The fact that a non-signatory did not put pen to paper may be an indicator\n\nof its intention to not assume any rights, responsibilities or obligations\n\nunder the arbitration agreement. However, the courts and tribunals should\n\nnot adopt a conservative approach to exclude all persons or entities who\n\nintended to be bound by the underlying contract containing the arbitration\n\nagreement through their conduct and their relationship with the signatory\n\nparties. The mutual intent of the parties, relationship of a non-signatory with\n\na signatory, commonality of the subject matter, composite nature of the\n\ntransactions and performance of the contract are all factors that signify the\n\nintention of the non-signatory to be bound by the arbitration agreement.\n\n70. An important factor to be considered by the Courts and Tribunals is the\n\nparticipation of the non-signatory in the performance of the underlying\n\ncontract.\nIn this regard, it was observed in\nCox and Kings\n(supra) as\n\nfollows:\n\n“123. […] The intention of the parties to be bound by an\narbitration agreement can be gauged from the circumstances\nthat surround the participation of the non-signatory party in\nthe negotiation, performance, and termination of the\nunderlying contract containing such agreement.\nThe UNIDROIT Principle of International Commercial\nContract, 2016 [UNIDROIT Principles of International\nCommercial Contracts, 2016,\nArticle 4.3.]\nprovides that the\nsubjective intention of the parties could be ascertained by\nhaving regard to the following circumstances:\n\n(a) preliminary negotiations between the parties;\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 59 of 67\n\n(b) practices which the parties have established between\nthemselves;\n\n(c) the conduct of the parties subsequent to the conclusion of\nthe contract;\n\n(d) the nature and purpose of the contract;\n\n(e) the meaning commonly given to terms and expressions in\nthe trade concerned; and\n\n(f) usages.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n126. Evaluating the involvement of the non-signatory party\nin the negotiation, performance, or termination of a contract\nis an important factor for a number of reasons. First, by\nbeing actively involved in the performance of a contract, a\nnon-signatory may create an appearance that it is a veritable\nparty to the contract containing the arbitration agreement;\n\nsecond, the conduct of the non-signatory may be in harmony\nwith the conduct of the other members of the group, leading\nthe other party to legitimately believe that the non-signatory\nwas a veritable party to the contract; and third, the other\nparty has legitimate reasons to rely on the appearance\ncreated by the non-signatory party so as to bind it to the\narbitration agreement.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n127. […] The nature or standard of involvement of the non-\nsignatory in the performance of the contract should be such\nthat the non-signatory has actively assumed obligations or\nperformance upon itself under the contract. In other words,\nthe test is to determine whether the non-signatory has a\npositive, direct, and substantial involvement in the\nnegotiation, performance, or termination of the contract.\nMere incidental involvement in the negotiation or\nperformance of the contract is not sufficient to infer the\nconsent of the non-signatory to be bound by the underlying\ncontract or its arbitration agreement. The burden is on the\nparty seeking joinder of the non-signatory to the arbitration\nagreement to prove a conscious and deliberate conduct of\ninvolvement of the non-signatory based on objective\nevidence.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 60 of 67\n\n71. It is evident that the intention of the parties to be bound by an arbitration\n\nagreement can be gauged from the circumstances that surround the\n\nparticipation of the non-signatory party in the negotiation, performance, and\n\ntermination of the underlying contract containing such an agreement.\n\nFurther, when the conduct of the non-signatory is in harmony with the\n\nconduct of the others, it might lead the other party or parties to legitimately\n\nbelieve that the non-signatory was a veritable party to the contract\n\ncontaining the arbitration agreement. However, in order to infer consent of\n\nthe non-signatory party, their involvement in the negotiation or\n\nperformance of the contract must be positive, direct and substantial and not\n\nbe merely incidental. Thus, the conduct of the non-signatory party along\n\nwith the other attending circumstances may lead the referral court to draw\n\na legitimate inference that it is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement.\n\n72. Of the several entities pertaining to which settlement is contemplated under\n\nthe FAA dated 28.02.2020 executed between the AMP Group and JRS\n\nGroup, clauses 2.1.4 and 2.1.6 relate to Millenium and Deegee which are\n\nRespondent Nos. 7 and 8 companies respectively. It is an undisputed fact\n\nthat Respondent Nos. 7 and 8 companies are themselves a part of the SRG\n\nGroup. Therefore, prima facie without the joinder of the SRG Group, which\n\nincludes Millenium and Deegee, there may not be a complete and effective\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 61 of 67\n\nresolution of the disputes arising out of the FAA between the AMP and JRS\n\nGroups.\n\n73. Clause 2.1.4 read with Schedule 7 of the FAA prima facie indicates that the\n\npetitioners i.e., the AMP Group has to exit from the Respondent No.7\n\ncompany i.e. Millenium where they hold Class A equity shares amounting\n\nto 36%. According to the procedure contemplated therein, during Phase 1\n\nof the Millenium exit, the SRG Group (which already holds 40% shares in\n\nMillenium) is supposed to additionally purchase approx. 11% of the shares\n\nin Millenium held by the AMP Group. It is stated therein that the JRS Group\n\nwould provide the necessary funding to SRG Group to purchase the\n\naforementioned shares. In Phase 2, Millenium would buy back the balance\n\nshares of the AMP Group i.e., approx. 25% from the funds to be received\n\nfrom Respondent No. 8 company i.e. Deegee.\n\n74. Clause 2.1.6 read with Schedule 8 prima facie indicates that the JRS Group\n\nand SRG Group would completely exit from the Respondent No. 8\n\nCompany i.e., Deegee. The proceeds received by the AMP Group from the\n\nsale of its shares in Millenium as per Phase 1 of the Millenium exit would\n\nbe brought into Deegee by the AMP Group. AMP Group is also required to\n\nbring further funds into Deegee to pay off the entire loan provided by\n\nMillenium to Deegee along with interest at the rate of 14.5% compounded\n\nannually. Simultaneously with the repayment of loans to Millenium as\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 62 of 67\n\naforesaid, Deegee is also required to pay off the entire loan provided by the\n\nJRS Group and SRG Group with interest at the rate of 14.5% compounded\n\nannually. Subsequently, the shares of Deegee held by the JRS Group and\n\nSRG Group would be transferred completely to the AMP Group.\n\n75. In short, while the AMP Group is supposed to exit from Millenium and\n\nacquire shares in Deegee, the JRS and SRG Groups are supposed to exit\n\nfrom Deegee and, the SRG Group would acquire shares in Millenium. It is\n\nalso provided that agreements are to be executed with or by the SRG Group\n\nto record and finalize the understanding with respect to the exit of AMP\n\nGroup from Millenium and the exit of JRS and SRG Groups from Deegee.\n\nRecognising the interdependent nature of the transactions contemplated\n\nwith respect to Millenium and Deegee, clause 2.1.4(a) also states that the\n\nexit of Millenium and Deegee should be endeavoured to be undertaken\n\nsimultaneously on the same day.\n\n76. Further Clause 2.1.7 requires the AMP Group to irrevocably and\n\nunconditionally withdraw all litigations including CP/383/2017 filed in\n\nconnection with Deegee by the AMP Group before the NCLT at Mumbai\n\nwherein Respondent No.9 of the SRG Group is one of the respondents.\n\n77. All that has been stated aforesaid gives an impression, though prima facie,\n\nthat the SRG Group may be connected to the FAA and forms part of the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 63 of 67\n\nsettlement contemplated therein. However, this aspect should be looked\n\ninto more closely by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n78. Moreover, on the question whether the non-signatory party i.e., the SRG\n\nGroup intended or consented to be bound by the arbitration agreement or\n\nthe underlying contract containing the arbitration agreement through their\n\nacts or conduct, elaborate submissions have been made on behalf of all three\n\ngroups, by placing reliance on the terms of the agreement, several email\n\nexchanges etc. On bare perusal of the email exchanges produced by the\n\npetitioner, it appears prima facie that several contested questions of fact,\n\nincluding but not limited to those hereinbelow, need to be first resolved:\n\n• Whether Mr. Kalpesh Parmar or the JRS Group can be said to have\n\nrepresented the interests of the SRG Group during the negotiations\n\nleading up to the FAA, its implementation and during the mediation\n\nprocess;\n\n• Whether the marking of several emails to the Respondent No.9 of the\n\nSRG Group and the absence of any protest on his part can imply consent\n\nof the SRG Group to be bound by the underlying contract and/or the\n\narbitration agreement;\n\n• Whether the documents required for the valuation and due diligence of\n\nMillenium and Deegee could have been shared by an employee of\n\nDeegee without the knowledge or consent of the SRG Group; and\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 64 of 67\n\n• Whether the demand of an additional Rs. 25 crore made by the SRG\n\nGroup through the JRS Group as a condition for exit from Deegee\n\nindicates their intention to be bound by the underlying contract and/or\n\nthe arbitration agreement?\n\n79. A detailed examination of numerous disputed questions of fact are\n\nimperative in deciding whether the SRG Group participated in the\n\nnegotiation and performance of the underlying contract and can be bound\n\nby the arbitration agreement. At the cost of repetition, we may state that\n\nunder our limited jurisdiction afforded under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996\n\nwe should not conduct a mini trial and delve into contested or disputed\n\nquestions of fact. This has been categorically\nlaid down in\nseveral decisions\n\nof this Court including\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) and Krish Spinning (supra).\n\nFurther, it is also the case of the SRG Group that a dual test needs to be\n\nsatisfied before it is compelled to be a party to the present arbitration\n\nproceedings i.e., (a) SRG Group should be shown to have agreed to the\n\nunderlying contract and (b) SRG Group should also be shown to have\n\nagreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement. We are of the considered\n\nview that the same requires a much more detailed examination of the\n\nevidence that may be adduced by the parties which can only be gone into\n\nby the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 65 of 67\n\n80. Therefore, considering the complexity involved in the determination of the\n\nquestion whether the SRG Group is a veritable party to the arbitration\n\nagreement or not, we are of the view that it would be appropriate for the\n\narbitral tribunal to take a call on the question after taking into consideration\n\nthe evidence that may be adduced by the parties before it and the application\n\nof the legal doctrine as elaborated in the decision in\nCox and Kings\n(supra).\n\n81. We also prima facie find force in the contention of the petitioner AMP\n\nGroup that the nomenclature of the agreement is not determinative of its\n\ncharacter as held by this Court in\nSasan Power Ltd.\n(supra). Therefore, the\n\nfact that the underlying contract is called the “Family Arrangement\n\nAgreement” by itself may not preclude the impleadment of the SRG Group\n\nin arbitration.\n\n82. Once the arbitral tribunal is constituted, it shall be open for the respondents\n\nto raise all the available objections in law, and it is only after (and if) the\n\npreliminary objections are rejected that the tribunal shall proceed to\n\nadjudicate the claims of the Petitioners.\n\nF. CONCLUSION\n\n83. In view of the aforesaid, the present petition is allowed. We appoint Mr.\n\nAkil Kureshi (Former Chief Justice, High Court of Rajasthan) to act as the\n\nArbitration Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 66 of 67\n\nsole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator including other modalities shall be\n\nfixed in consultation with the parties.\n\n84. It is made clear that all the rights and contentions of the parties are left open\n\nfor adjudication by the learned arbitrator.\n\n85. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.\n\n…………………………………….CJI.\n\n(Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud)\n\n………………………………………J.\n(J.B.
