As she\n tried to shout, Aman gagged her mouth and committed rape on her. Hearing the\n sound, her mother and sister knocked the door. Meanwhile, her father also\n came. His father pushed the door to open. Aman Sikarwar started scuffling with\n her parents and threatened to kill her brother. Meanwhile, police also arrived on\n spot. Aman was handed over to the police. On such allegation, PS- Jaura\n registered FIR at Crime No.201/2024 for offence punishable under \nSections\n 376\n, \n450\n and \n506\n of IPC.
