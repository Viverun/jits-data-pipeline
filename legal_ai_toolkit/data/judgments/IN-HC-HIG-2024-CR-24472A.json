Jitender Kumar, accused Harswroop was\n\ncontinuously with police after he was found in the fish\n\nmarket near Govind Temple [Ext. A-15 (paper No.\n3Ka/20)]. The recovery of the dead body was made\n\nwhen accused Harswroop was in the custody of the\n\npolice under\nSection 27\nof the Indian Evidence Act and\n\nafter the recovery he has to be taken in the custody by\n\nthe police officer.\n\n25) The lower court made reference to the\n\njudgment rendered by the Supreme Court in\nState of\n\nU.P. Vs Deoman Upadhayaya\n, AIR 1960 SC 1125, and\n\nAghno Nagesia Vs State of Bihar, AIR 1966 SC 119,\n\nwhere the Supreme Court has held that where the FIR\n\nis given by the accused to the police officer that he had\n\ncommitted the murder then\nSection 27\nof the Act\n\nserves as an exception to\nSection 25\nof the Indian\n\nEvidence Act and assumes that the accused to be in\n\nconstructive custody of the police and has admitted the\n\ninformation relating to the recovery of bodies and the\n\nweapon. Under\nSection 27\nof the Indian Evidence Act,\n\ncustody does not mean formal custody but includes any\n\nsurveillance or restriction by police which is more\n\nrelaxing in the present case as the accused has himself\n\nwillingly stated about his involvement in taking of the\n\nvictim to his room, doing unnatural act with him and\n\ncommitting murder.\nFurther accused Pappu and Roopwati were\n\nalso arrested after the dead body of deceased was\n\nrecovered at 11.45 hours, and accused Roopwati was\n\narrested after a lady Sub Inspector was called.\n\nHence, the proceedings have been correctly followed\n\nwhile recovering the dead body, taking accused\n\nHarswroop into custody, and arresting Pappu and\n\nRoopwati. Finally, the final opinion taken by the lower\n\ncourt was that since the recovery of deceased victim's\n\ndead body (Ext. A-14) and the clothes (Ext. A-18) was\n\nmade fulfilling all the legal provisions and requirements\n\nof\nSection 27\nof the Indian Evidence Act, as per the\n\njudgment of\nAnter Singh Vs State of Rajasthan\n(2004)\n\n10 SCC 657, the same is relevant and admissible in\n\nevidence.\n\n26) P.W.8 had deposed that the dead body of\n\nvictim was taken out of the jute bag and P.W.1, father\n\nof the deceased child, started crying. The prosecution\n\nhas led all evidence with respect to the identification\n\nand description of the recovered body, and how the\n\nbody was recovered, sealed and sent for postmortem\n\nexamination, and panchnama (Ext. A-5) of the\n\ndeceased was prepared by P.W.6 S.I. Harvinder in the\npresence of the Panches, which is paper No. 3Ka/36 to\n\n3Ka/38 on record.\n\nKidnapping under\nSection 364\nof IPC\n\n27) As per the deposition given by P.W.1 , P.W.2\n\nand P.W.3 in the court the deceased victim was playing\n\non the roof and subsequently recovery (memo Ext. A-\n\n14) of the body of the victim from the room of the\n\naccused Harswroop was identified by the witnesses at\n\nthe time of preparation of inquest report (Ext. A-5).\n\nHence, the offence punishable under\nSection 364\nIPC\n\nwas made out against accused Harswroop.\n\nOffence under\nSection 377\nIPC and 5/6 of POCSO Act\n\n28) As far as kidnapping is concerned, the\n\noffence was made out against accused Harswroop as\n\ndiscussed above. With respect to the offence under\n\nSection 377\nIPC, the panel of doctors prepared the\n\nswab collected during postmortem and sent it to F.S.L.,\n\nDehradun. P.W.11 Dr. Rajeev Kumar has also\n\nexamined the accused on 21.02.2019, who in his cross-\n\nexamination stated that there was redness on the penis\n\nwhich appears within 24-48 hours. There were no\n\nscratch marks. There was no smegma present on the\n\npenis. When there is redness there is no smegma\n\npresent. P.W. 11 further deposed in his examination-\nin-chief that the penis glans is reddish when it is used\n\nto do some work forcefully.\n\n29) Apart from the evidence adduced by P.W.5\n\nDr. Nagender Singh and P.W.11 Dr. Rajeev Kumar with\n\nrespect to the offence of unnatural act, the FSL report\n\nNo. FSL-571(Bio)-914 (DNA) dated 10.06.2019 (Ext. A-\n\n28) reveals that the following exhibits were prepared\n\nby P.W.6 S.I. Harvinder Kumar at the time of sending\n\nthe same to F.S.L. for examination :\n\nParcel No. Description of Exhibits\n1 Exhibit-1 Anal Swab of deceased\nExhibit-2 Hair of deceased\n2 Exhibit-3 Hair of accused\n3 Exhibit-4 Blood sample of accused on FTA card\n(reference DNA sample)\n\nResult of the examination for examination of the semen\nand blood\n\n1. Semen could not be detected on Exhibit-1 and 2\n\n2. Human blood could not be detected on Exhibit-2\n\nResult of DNA Examination\n\n1. The DNA test was performed for Exhibit -1 and 4\n\n2. The alleles were amplified at each loci to obtain the\nDNA profiles of the sources of Exhibits -1 & 4\n\n3. The DNA profile obtained from the Exhibit-1 (anal\nswab of deceased) is from a single male human\nsource and not matching with the DNA profile\nobtained from the Exhibit-4 (blood sample of\naccused)\nCONCLUSION\nThe DNA test performed on the exhibits provided is\nsufficient to conclude that, the DNA obtained from the\nExhibit-1 (anal swab of the deceased) is from a single\nmale human source and not matching with the DNA\nobtained from the exhibit-4 (blood sample of the\naccused).\n\n30) Nothing material has come in the FSL report\n\nto show that accused had sodomized the deceased\n\nvictim, but\nSection 377\nof IPC stipulates there must be\n\npenetration to constitute the carnal intercourse. The\n\npostmortem report (Ext. A-3), paper No. 3Ka/43 was\n\nsilent with respect to any injury caused in or around\n\nthe anal region of the deceased victim. Reference was\n\nmade to the Modi's Medical Jurisprudence where it has\n\nbeen observed that there can be less or no injury when\n\nfor the offence of 377 of\nIPC\none is consenting or\n\nmajor.\n\nThe deceased, in the present case, was\n\nneither a major nor consenting. However, as per the\n\ndeposition of P.W.5 the outer area of anal passage was\n\n4 cm and the anal canal depth was 6 cm and\n\nbroadened, it was visible easily. Hence the court\n\nproceeded to discuss what can be the reason of\n\nbroadening of the anal canal. Hence the court\n\nobserved that it was difficult to recourse to the fact that\nsuch an observation made at the time of medical\n\nexamination and the deposition of P.W.5 was a\n\nconsequence of the act done by the accused\n\nHarswroop. Again, reference was made to the evidence\n\nadduced by P.W.11 Dr. Rajeev Kumar, who had\n\nexamined the accused Harswroop. As per P.W.11,\n\nthere was redness found on the private part of accused\n\nHarswroop during medical examination, after his arrest.\n\nIt transpires that the reason for the absence of\n\nsmegma was due to some forceful action. Since\n\nredness was found on the private part of accused\n\nHarswroop during medical examination, it could be a\n\nclinching evidence as per the deposition made by this\n\nwitness. As per this witness the reason probably would\n\nbe that accused Harswroop could have exercised force\n\nat some time other than when he was with the\n\ndeceased child. The victim was missing from\n\n19.02.2019, the accused Harswroop was medically\n\nexamined on 21.02.2019 at 2.10 hours in the afternoon\n\nwhich is soon after the commission of crime. As per,\n\nP.W.11 the redness caused due to the force used by\n\nthe accused was soon after the commission of crime.\n\nThis was a probability that such a force caused the\n\nredness and absence of smegma from the private part\nof accused Harswroop. The accused failed to give any\n\nevidence that how this redness came after missing of\n\nthe child and no evidence was led to prove his\n\navailability at some other place. Failure to lead any\n\nsuch evidence that he was elsewhere when the child\n\nwas went missing, the case of the prosecution has to\n\nbe taken more favourably.\n\n31) Another fact which the lower court took into\n\naccount was that the body of the deceased was found\n\nin a naked condition in the jute bag, and the body was\n\nrecovered from the room of the accused Harswroop.\n\nThe clothes of the victim were also recovered from the\n\nroom of the accused Harswroop (Ext. no. 18). This fact\n\nwas further stated by accused Pappu and Roopwati in\n\ntheir statement recorded under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C.,\n\nand with respect to the recovery of the dead body in\n\nnaked condition and the clothes of the deceased\n\nrecovered from the room of accused Harswroop, a\n\nstrong presumption about the occurrence of offence\n\nunder\nSection 377\nIPC was made out. Harswroop used\n\nless force due to which noticeable injury was not found\n\nduring postmortem. Hence the lower court came to the\n\nconclusion that Harswroop used less force and due to\n\nwhich no injury was found during postmortem.\nThe victim was only 07 years of age, and the\n\nmarks of injury Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 found on the body of\n\nthe deceased during postmortem examination was a\n\nliving example of the situation in front of the eyes that\n\nsome resistance was offered when the accused was\n\ntrying to make victim his prey. It is unusual for the\n\naccused to grasp in his hand the neck of the deceased\n\nvictim while committing sodomy.\n\n32) Apart from the above evidence which clinches\n\nthat the body of the deceased victim was found in a\n\nnaked condition from the room of Harswroop, and the\n\ninjury marks found during postmortem also confirms\n\nthat the deceased had offered resistance while the\n\naccused was committing crime under\nSection 377\nIPC.\n\nIn the above background, the statement given by the\n\naccused under\nSection 164\nCr.P.C. before the\n\nMagistrate confessing his crime, and statement under\n\nSection 161\nCr.P.C., and as per the photograph Mat.\n\nExt. 12 (paper No. 3Ka/60) of the deceased victim, the\n\nstool coming out was visible. All these facts show that\n\nthe unnatural act was committed with the victim before\n\nhis death. Since the age of the victim was below 12\n\nyears, the offence under\nSection 5\nof POCSO Act which\n\ndefines aggravated penetrative sexual assault is also\nmade out, keeping in view the fact that the offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 377\nIPC is proved beyond\n\nreasonable doubt against the accused Harswroop.\n\n33) After the amendment in the\nPOCSO Act\n, even\n\nif body of the victim is touched it amounts to\n\npenetrative sexual assault, when the victim is under 12\n\nyears of age\nSection 5(m)\nof the POCSO Act is\n\nattracted. Since the body of the deceased victim was\n\nfound in a naked condition, a presumption under\n\nSections 29\nand\nof the POCSO Act, of existence of\n\nculpable mind and offence to have occurred is also\n\nmade out.\n\nOffence under\nSection 302\nof IPC\n\n34) As discussed in the preceding paragraphs of\n\nthe judgment that accused Harswroop in his confession\n\nstatement made under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. stated that\n\nhe did unnatural act and thereafter committed murder\n\nof the victim by pressing his neck through his right\n\nhand when the victim started crying and insisted to go\n\noutside. Accused committed the murder of the victim\n\nwith a fear of being caught. In his confession\n\nstatement under\nSection 164\nCr.P.C. also, accused\n\nHarswroop reiterated the story of committing murder of\n\nthe victim and the fact of committing rape on him again\nafter his death. Accused also stated that he moved the\n\nclothes of the victim kept them aside, covered the body\n\nwith a blanket and went to sleep. He admitted his\n\noffence. Accused even hid the dead body of the victim\n\nin a jute bag in order to dispose it off at an appropriate\n\ntime. It was the fear in his mind which does not allow\n\nhim to move out and cooperate in the ongoing search\n\nof the missing victim. The confessional statement\n\ngiven by Harswroop under\nSections 161\nand\nCr.P.C., and thereafter recovery of the dead body at\n\nhis instance was evidence sufficient enough to hold that\n\nthese statements of the accused to the police is barred\n\nby limitation of\nSection 25\nof the Indian Evidence Act,\n\nwhile it does not apply on\nSection 27\nof the Act.\n\nBased on these confessional statements inference can\n\nsafely be drawn that the accused had every intention to\n\nentice away the victim to his room for fulfilling his\n\nsexual desire. This is further corroborated by the fact\n\nthat both the families had no enmity and they were\n\nneighbours, as had come in the statement of all the\n\naccused persons recorded under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C.\n\nAccused Harswroop did not adduce any evidence to\n\ncontradict the prosecution evidence, apart from making\n\na statement that it was a false case against him. The\nstatement recorded under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. can not\n\nbe relied upon to shake the credibility of the\n\nprosecution story.\n\nFinally, the evidence adduced by P.W.5 are\n\nfully corroborated by the postmortem report (Ext. A-3)\n\nthat cause of death of the victim was due to asphyxia\n\nas a result of ante mortem strangulation, and the death\n\nhad occurred 30-40 hours before the postmortem.\n\nHence, the cause of death after the dead body was\n\nrecovered was due to asphyxia as a result of ante\n\nmortem strangulation, and strong presumption can be\n\ndrawn that the death of the victim was not natural, but\n\nit was a homicidal death. Keeping in view the above\n\nfacts, the court below rightly came to the conclusion\n\nthat offence punishable under\nSection 302\nIPC was\n\nclearly made out against accused Harswroop.\n\nOffence\nu/s 201\nof IPC against all the accused\n\n35) The dead body of the deceased was\n\nrecovered from the room of accused Harswroop hidden\n\nin a jute bag, and said fact is in the knowledge of his\n\nparents viz. accused Pappu and Roopwati, which amply\n\nindicates that he and his family members were in an\n\nopportunity to dispose off the dead body in order to\n\ncause disappearance of the evidence. The recovery of\nthe dead body, seizure memo (Ext. A-14), photographs\n\nfiled as Mat. Exts. 11 & 12, and the clothes recovered\n\n(Ext. A-18) from the room of accused Harswroop which\n\nwas in his possession proves the case of the\n\nprosecution beyond reasonable doubt under\nSection\nIPC against the accused Harswroop.\n\nOther accused persons Pappu and Roopwati\n\nin their statement under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. stated\n\nthat clothes of the deceased victim were recovered\n\nfrom the room of Harswroop. They admitted it since\n\nboth the accused Pappu and Roopwati were living with\n\naccused Harswroop in the same house, and there was\n\nno specific denial about the commission of the offence.\n\nBoth of them expressed their consent in words\n\nregarding investigation done against accused\n\nHarswroop to be correct.\n\nWith respect to the offence punishable under\n\nSection 201\nIPC, it has come on record that both the\n\naccused Pappu and Roopwati were labourers and they\n\nused to go for work everyday in the morning and used\n\nto return back in the late evening. They knew nothing\n\nabout the offence. They did not aid the accused\n\nHarswroop in any way, but they played a role in order\n\nto save their son Harswroop and helped him in\ndisappearance of the evidence. Hence, the case of the\n\nprosecution on this count against accused persons\n\nPappu and Roopwati is also proved beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\nHowever, prosecution led no evidence to\n\nprove the case under\nSection 16\n/\nof POCSO Act\n\nagainst accused Pappu and Roopwati and, hence the\n\ncharge under\nSection 16\n/\nof POCSO Act was not\n\nproved against them.\n\n36) Thus, the court below after hearing counsel\n\nfor the parties, came to the conclusion that the\n\nprosecution was successful to prove its case beyond\n\nreasonable doubt against accused Harswroop in respect\n\nof offences punishable under\nSection 364\n,\n,\nof\n\nIPC, and the one under\nSection 5\n/\nof POCSO Act, and\n\nafter conviction, sentenced him accordingly. Similarly,\n\nthe court below also came to the conclusion that\n\nprosecution has successfully proved charge for the\n\noffence punishable under\nSection 201\nof IPC against\n\nthe accused persons namely, Pappu and Roopwati, and\n\nafter convection, sentenced them accordingly.\n)\nThe present case\nis based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, and reference can be made to the case of\n\nSharad Birdhichand Sarda Vs State of Maharastra,\nAIR 1984 SC 1622, wherein the Supreme Court has\n\nlaid down the following tests which have to be\n\nfollowed before conviction has to be recorded in cases\n\nwhich are based on circumstantial evidence. The\n\nsame read as under :\n\n(a) the circumstances from which the conclusion of\nguilt is to be drawn should be fully established.\n\nThe circumstances concerned 'must or should'\nand not 'may be' established;\n\n(b) The facts so established should be consistent\nonly with the hypothesis of the guilt of the\naccused, that is to say, they should not be\nexplainable on any other hypothesis except\nthat the accused is guilty;\n\n(c) tendency; The circumstances should be of\nconclusive nature and\n\n(d) They should exclude every possible hypothesis\nexcept the one to be proved; and\n\n(e) There must be a chain of evidence so complete\nas not to leave any reasonable ground for the\nconclusion consistent with the innocence of the\naccused and must show that in all human\nprobability the act must have been done by the\naccused.\n\n38) As per evidence collected by the\n\nprosecution the following facts came to light. The\n\nsame are enumerated as under:\n\n(1) the house of the complainant and that of the\naccused persons is adjacent to each other as\nper the site plan (Ext. A-26). Accused\nHarswroop in his statement recorded under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. also stated that P.W.1\n(complainant) was his neighbour. In the site\nplan the house of the complainant was shown\nas the house of Roshan Lal (landlord), in which\nthe complainant was staying, and the same\nwas shown adjacent to the house of the\naccused.\n\n(2) On 21.02.2019, at about 09.05 hours, an\napplication (Ext. A-2) was given by P.W.1 in\nthe police station alleging the role of accused\nHarswroop, Pappu, Roopwati and Pawan\n(declared juvenile). It was stated by P.W.1\nthat in the night, he heard some noise on the\nroof, when he reached there along with his\nfamily members, he saw accused Harswroop\ntrying to open the lid of the water tank. When\nP.W.1 shouted, Harswroop rushed to his house\nthrough the staircase and this raised a\nsuspicion in the mind of P.W.1 and he\nimmediately made a complaint (Ext. A-2) with\nthe police station doubting the role of accused\nHarswroop with respect to his child went\nmissing. This complaint was made by P.W.1\nsubsequent to the tehrir dated 21.02.2019\n(Ext. A-1).\n\nOn the basis of this application (Ext. A-2),\nthe investigation was carried out and the police\nalong with P.W.1 / complainant went in search\nof the accused Harswroop, and he was found in\nthe fish market near Govind Temple. Accused\nwas taken into custody and at his instance the\ndead body of deceased was recovered from his\nroom in his house. Harswroop was never\narrested, he was merely taken on the basis of\ninformation (Ext. A-2).\n(3) As per evidence given by P.W.8 S.I. Jitender\nKumar when search was being made for\naccused Harswroop, they met P.W.1 at the P.S.\nTransit Camp, who told them that accused was\nin the fish market. Thereafter, when\nHarswroop was confronted in the fist market\nnear Govind Temple, he informed the police\nthat he lured the victim by offering toffee and\ncommitted bad act (unnatural act) with him,\nand after 1-2 hours, he again committed\nunnatural act with the victim, and when the\nvictim started crying for going outside with the\nfear of being caught, accused throttled his neck\nwith his right hand due to which victim died.\nThere is no occasion to doubt the complaint\n(Ext. A-2) made by P.W.1. The investigation\nwas thereafter carried out, and Harswroop was\napprehended in the fish market from where he\nwas taken to the police station, where he\nadmitted his crime. There are entries in the\nGeneral Diary that police had taken him there.\n\nHarswroop took them to his house, and\nthen to his room, where the naked dead body\nof the victim was recovered from a jute bag,\nand clothes of the deceased victim were also\nrecovered from his room. Harswroop was\narrested vide arrest memo (Ext. A-15) at 13.30\nhours from his residence. The arrest was\nmade after recovery of the dead body of the\nvictim as per the information given by\nHarswroop to the police and the recovery of\ndead body under\nSection 27\nof the Indian\nEvidence Act is crucial evidence connecting\nwith the chain of circumstances which started\nwith the complaint (Ext. A-2) made by P.W.1.\nThe sustainable evidence that it was Harswroop\nwho had kept the naked dead body of the\nvictim in his room in a jute bag and had taken\nout the clothes and kept in the room as well,\nwhich were soiled with stool. The clothes of\nthe victim, as well as the dead body of the\nvictim, were identified by P.W.1.\n\n(4) Apart from the above, the statement given by\nparents of Harswroop under\nSection 313\n\nCr.P.C. also supports the case of the\nprosecution. Both the accused Pappu and\nRoopwati in their statement recorded under\n\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. stated that the clothes of\nthe victim were recovered from the room of\nHarswroop. Roopwati further stated that the\nmother of Harswroop had died and she is the\nstepmother of Harswroop, who had brought\nhim up when he was four and a half years old.\nNo other evidence was led by the defence to\nshow that they had doubted anybody else of\ncommitting the murder of deceased victim.\nThey admitted that the clothes have been\nrecovered from the room of their son\nHarswroop.\n\nHence the whole chain of events as per\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court in Sharad\nBirdhichand Sarda's case (supra) is complete\nand does not leave any reasonable doubt for\nthe conclusion with respect to the innocence of\nthe accused. The whole chain of event does\nnot leave any doubt that it was Harswroop who\nhad enticed the child from the roof top to his\nroom, committed unnatural act, and murdered\nhim.\n(5) The postmortem report and the evidence given\nby the doctors further require to be assessed\nwhether an unnatural act was done by\nHarswroop or not?\n\nAs per the evidence given by P.W.5 Dr.\nNagender Singh, who was one of the panel\ndoctors, during postmortem after examining\nthe anal portion of the dead body it was found\nthat the outer area of anal passage was 4 cm.\nand the anal canal dept was 6 cm. and\nbroadened. It was visible easily. The stool\nwas present on the outer area of the anal canal\nand outside the anal some hairs were present.\nThe colour of nails, face, mouth and the ears\n(lower soft part) colour was bluish. The tongue\nwas protruding outside the mouth.\n\n39) Whether this medical examination and the\n\ninjuries would reflect the commission of offence under\n\nSection 377\nIPC and\nSection 5\n/\nof POCSO Act is to be\n\nexamined now.\n\n40)\nSection 6\nof the POCSO Act provides for\n\nrigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be\n\nless than twenty years, but which may extend to\n\nimprisonment for life, and also liable to fine. As far as\n\naggravated penetrative sexual assault on a child below\n\ntwelve years is concerned, the same is defined in\n\nSection 5(m)\nof the POCSO Act. The same reads as\n\nunder :\n\"5. Aggravated penetrative sexual assault\n\n(m) whoever commits penetrative sexual\nassault on a child below twelve years\"\n\n41) Since the victim in the present case was\n\nbelow twelve years of age then for the purpose of\n\npunishment committed of an offence of aggravated\n\npenetrative sexual assault even an assault can be\n\nconsidered to be covered under the provision of\nSection\n\n5(m)\nand the same will be applicable, and the\n\npunishment as per\nSection 6\nwould be as under :\n\n\"6. Punishment for aggravated penetrative\nsexual assault. -(1) Whoever commits aggravated\npenetrative sexual assault shall be punished with\nrigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be\nless than twenty years, but which may extend to\nimprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment\nfor the remainder of natural life of that person, and\nshall also be liable to fine, or with death.\"\n\n42) Now with respect to the offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 377\nIPC, the medical opinion given by\n\nthe panel of doctors in their report, while conducting\n\nthe postmortem of the deceased victim, is an under :\n\n\"From the examination of the anal portion of the\ndead body by the panel of doctors it was found that\nthe outer area of anal passage was 4 cm. and the anal\ncanal depth was 6 cm. and broadened. It was visible\neasily. The stool was present on the outer area of the\nanal canal and outside the anal some hairs were\npresent. The colour of nails, face, mouth and the ears\n(lower soft part) colour was bluish. The tongue was\nprotruding outside the mouth.\"\n\nHence, even if there is such injury or no\n\ninjury, the offence punishable under\nSection 6\nof the\n\nPOCSO Act is made out. In the present case, as per\n\nthe evidence adduced by P.W.5 Dr. Nagender Singh,\n\nthe court below had rightly observed the reason of\n\nbroadening of the anal canal.\n\n43) In the present case, as per evidence adduced\n\nby P.W.5 Dr. Nagender Singh, on examination of the\n\nanal portion of the dead body it was found that the\n\nouter area of anal passage was 4 cm and the anal canal\n\ndepth was 6 cm and broadened, it was visible easily.\n\nThe above said evidence as per\nSection 6\nread with\n\nSection 5(m)\nof POCSO Act would amount to sexual\n\nassault. Even if the offence punishable under\nSection\nIPC per se would not be made out, the offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 6\nof the POCSO Act is made\n\nout.\n\n44) Another finding recorded by the lower court\n\nwas that on account of presence of stool on the outer\n\narea of the anal canal the possibility of committing the\n\ncrime for sexual assault before the stool came out was\nmore probable. Apart from the postmortem report of\n\nthe deceased and the opinion given by P.W.5, the\n\nopinion given by P.W.11 Dr. Rajeev Kumar, Orthopedic\n\nsurgeon of L.D. Bhatt, Hospital, Kashipur, who\n\nconducted the medical examination of the accused\n\nHarswroop on 21.02.2019, at about 2.10 hours, would\n\nalso be relevant. P.W.11 stated that on medical\n\nexamination of the accused it was found that the colour\n\nof the glans penis was reddish especially base of glans\n\npenis was red, pubic hair present. In the opinion of\n\nP.W.11 the penis glans will be reddish when some\n\nforceful act is done. The said medical examination\n\nreport is marked as (Ext. A-29). Further, on cross-\n\nexamination, P.W.11 deposed that the redness on the\n\npenis of the accused could have been 24 to 48 hours.\n\nThere was no scratch mark. There was no smegma\n\npresent on the penis. When there is redness there is\n\nno smegma.\n\n45) As per the evidence given by P.W.11, the\n\nreason for absence of smegma was due to some\n\nforceful action and redness may occur within 24 to 48\n\nhours. When there is redness smegma is not present,\n\nand as per P.W.11, if redness was found during medical\n\nexamination of accused Harswroop, this would be a\nclinching evidence that accused Harswroop could have\n\nexercised force at some time other than when he was\n\nwith deceased victim, but this does not completely rule\n\nout the possibility that the accused could have also\n\nexercised force through the small anal aperture of the\n\ndeceased victim due to which the smegma was absent.\n\n46) The medical examination of accused\n\nHarswroop was conducted on 21.02.2019 afternoon,\n\nand the crime was committed on 19.02.2019, and as\n\nper P.W.11, the redness caused was due to force used\n\nby the accused soon after the commission of crime.\n\nSince there was no delay in conducting medical\n\nexamination of accused Harswroop, and the dead body\n\nwas recovered from his room, under\nSection 106\nof the\n\nIndian Evidence Act, the burden was on the accused to\n\nprove how the body came in his room, and where was\n\nhe after 19.02.2019 till 21.02.2019, when the child\n\nwent missing in order to prove his non-involvement in\n\nthe crime. No evidence has been led by the defence to\n\nshow that Harswroop was not in his house on\n\n19.02.2019. The marks of ante mortem injuries found\n\non the dead body of the victim during postmortem, i.e.,\n\ninjury Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were also living example of\n\nthe situation in front of the eyes that some resistance\nwas offered when the accused was trying to make\n\ndeceased victim his prey. The Doctor further stated\n\nthat it was not unusual for the accused to grasp in his\n\nhand the neck of the deceased victim while committing\n\nsodomy.\n\n47) Apart from the postmortem examination, and\n\nmedical examination of accused, proved by Medical\n\nOfficers P.W.5 and P.W.11, the accused in his\n\nstatements recorded under\nSection 164\nCr.P.C. and\nCr.P.C\n. had admitted that this act was done with\n\nthe victim before or after his death. The accused\n\ncommitted the crime with the victim which is evident\n\nfrom Mat. Ext. 12 (Paper No. 3Ka/60) which is the\n\nphotograph of the deceased victim, in which stool was\n\nseen coming out of anal canal and it means the act was\n\ndone before the death of the victim.\n\n48) The lower court after going through the\n\nabove said medical evidence given by P.W.5 and\n\nP.W.11; statement of the accused recorded under\n\nSection 164\nand\nCr.P.C.; and photograph of the\n\ndeceased victim Mat. Ext. 12, has rightly come to a\n\nconclusion that the offence punishable under\nSection\nIPC was made out. The best evidence could have\nbeen given by the victim, and since he had died, hence\n\nthe prosecution case has been weighed. The trial court\n\nobserved that the anal swab (Ext. A-28) collected and\n\nsend to the FSL, even if does not give any findings\n\nsuggesting the offence of sodomy, it does not\n\nneutralize the prosecution case with respect to the\n\noffence under\nSection 377\nIPC, and the same has to be\n\nappreciated in the light of other evidence available.\n\n49) Reliance has been placed on the judgment of\n\nthe Supreme Court in\nState of Uttarakhand Vs\n\nDarshan Singh\n, 2019 SCC Online SC 1431, wherein it\n\nhas been held that the ocular evidence is primary to\n\nthe expert evidence. In the present case, even if the\n\nbody of the victim is touched it amounts to penetrative\n\nsexual assault with the victim, who is twelve years of\n\nage, under\nSection 5(m)\nof POCSO Act. The trial court\n\nin para 124 of its judgment observed as under :\n\n\"Here it is very important to mention that\npenetrative sexual assault means not only to\npenetrate once penis into the vagina of the victim\nchild as earlier the situation was, but now after the\namendment under the relevant sections of the\nIPC\n\nand creation of this\nPOCSO Act\nmakes this clear that\nrape / sexual assault includes penetration of penis or\nanything into the vagina or anus etc., using of mouth\non the vagina, anus etc. or making her to use her\nmouth on his penis, anus etc. or to manipulate her\nbody in such a way that the act is done in furtherance\nto commit rape upon her that is the act shows that he\nis about to penetrate. In the POCSO cases even if the\nbody of the victim is touched it amounts to\npenetrative sexual assault and when the victim is\nunder twelve years of age,\nSection 5(m)\nof the POCSO\nAct is attracted.\"\n\n50) For the purpose of convicting the accused,\n\nreference was made to\nSections 29\nand\nof the\n\nPOCSO Act, which relates to existence of culpable mind\n\nand offence to have occurred, and also holds a\n\npresumption for an offence of the murder. The same\n\nread as under :\n\nSection 29\nPOCSO Act - where a person is\nprosecuted for committing or abetting or attempting\nto commit any offence under\nSection 3\n,\n,\nand\n\nsection 9\nof this Act, the Special Court shall presume,\nthat such person has committed or abetted or\nattempted to commit the offence, as the case may be,\nunless the contrary is proved.\n\nSection 30\nPOCSO Act - In any prosecution for\nany offence under this Act which requires a culpable\nmental state on the part of the accused, the Special\nCourt shall presume the existence of such mental\nstate but it shall be a defence for the accused to prove\nthe fact that he had no such mental state with respect\nto the act charged as an offence in that prosecution.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section, a fact is\nsaid to be proved only when the Special Court believes\nit to exist beyond reasonable doubt and not merely\nwhen its existence is established by a preponderance\nof probability.\n\nExplanation. -In this section, \"culpable mental\nstate\" includes intention, motive, knowledge of a fact\nand the belief in, or reason to believe, a fact.\n\nAs per the above said provisions if an\n\naccused is charged under the section of penetrative\n\nsexual assault in\nPOCSO Act\n, then the court must\n\nbelieve and shall presume that the charge and\nexistence of such mental state is true against the\n\naccused unless he himself proves it otherwise.\n\n51) In the facts of the present case, as per the\n\nstatements of accused persons Pappu and Roopwati\n\nrecorded under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C., they admitted that\n\nthe clothes of the deceased victim were recovered from\n\nthe room of accused Harswroop, and even naked dead\n\nbody of the victim was recovered from a jute bag from\n\nhis room, and as per\nSections 29\nand\nof POCSO Act,\n\nit was accused Harswroop who had to led evidence to\n\nshow that the offence has not been committed by him.\n\nHe led no evidence in defence. Moreover, as per the\n\nevidence given by P.W.5, the cause of death was\n\nasphyxia as a result of ante mortem injuries. There\n\nwere ante mortem injuries found on the body of the\n\ndeceased, stool was found present, which is one of the\n\nsymptom of death caused due to pressing of the neck.\n\nThe death had occurred 36-48 hours before, and the\n\ntime of the death related back to 19.02.2019. Hence,\n\nthe postmortem report also reflected that the victim\n\nhad died on 19.02.2019 and the dead body was\n\nrecovered on 21.02.2019 from the room of accused\n\nHarswroop. Thus, the offence punishable under\nSection\nIPC was made out against accused Harswroop, and\n\nhe was convicted on said charge.\n\n52) The dead body was recovered at the\n\ninstance of accused Harswroop, and as per P.W.8 S.I.\n\nJitender Kumar, it was identified by P.W.1, father of the\n\ndeceased. The recovery was made in the presence of\n\npanch witnesses, a panchnama (Ext. A-5) was also\n\nprepared, and further as per the confessional\n\nstatement, postmortem report, evidence adduced by\n\nP.W.5, and statement recorded under\nSection 313\n\nCr.P.C., the accused Harswroop was convicted under\n\nSection 302\nIPC.\n\n53) Hence, the prosecution has proved the case\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt that accused Harswroop has\n\nkilled the deceased victim with a motive to commit\n\nsodomy with him. However, other accused persons\n\nPappu and Roopwati helped the main accused\n\nHarswroop for causing disappearance of the evidence,\n\nas it has come on record that they knew that dead\n\nbody was in Harswroop's room and did not inform the\n\npolice. Hence, they have been rightly convicted under\n\nSection 201\nIPC.\n54) Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\naccused-appellant Harswroop argued that there is\n\ninconsistency in the evidence given by P.W.1, P.W.2\n\nand P.W.3 with respect to the time when they went to\n\nthe house of accused Harswroop in the morning on\n\n21.02.2019. One of the witnesses had stated 11:00 to\n\n11:30, P.W.1 had stated 11:00 to 11:30, P.W.3 had\n\nstated 1 o'clock, P.W.4 stated 11:30 to 12:00, and as\n\nper P.W.2 the body was recovered at night and the\n\npolice did not take the body at night. These are the\n\nminor discrepancies in the statements of witnesses\n\nP.W.1, P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.4. However, in the\n\npresent case, the evidence given by prosecution and\n\nthe investigating agency is consistent. These minor\n\ndiscrepancies in giving the date and time wrongly\n\ncannot dent the prosecution evidence. Evidence\n\ncollected by the I.O. after thorough investigation\n\nespecially keeping in view the fact that the incident\n\ntook place on 19.02.2019, at night when the child went\n\nmissing, and on 21.02.2019 the police team went to\n\nthe fish market and found accused Harswroop there,\n\nwho accompanied the police to the police station and\n\nthen he gave his confessional statement under\nSection\nCr.P.C. that he had done unnatural act with the\nvictim and had committed his murder. Accused took\n\nthe police to his house and opened his room and\n\nshowed them the naked dead body of the victim under\n\nthe cover of a blanket in a jute bag. Further, the\n\npostmortem report also reflected that as per the\n\nmedical report of accused Harswroop (Ext. A-29)\n\nproved by P.W.11 Dr. Rajeev Kumar, the redness on\n\nthe private part of the accused Harswroop could have\n\noccurred 36 to 48 hours before, and that was the exact\n\ntime when the murder took place, i.e., 19.02.2019.\n\nWith respect to the mentioning wrong timing by P.W.1,\n\nP.W.2 P.W.3 and P.W.4, the finding recorded by the\n\nlower court can not be interfered.\n\n55) Learned Senior Counsel further referred to\n\nthe judgment of Supreme Court in Dhan Raj alias\n\nDhand Vs State of Haryana\n, (2014) 6 SCC 745, where\n\nwhile examining a case of circumstantial evidence some\n\nextra-judicial confession was made and on the basis of\n\nextra-judicial confession some recoveries of robbed\n\narticles were made. In that case there were material\n\ndiscrepancies between the two extra-judicial\n\nconfessions and even with respect to the recovery of\n\nrobbed articles, it was doubtful. This judgment cannot\n\nbe applied to the facts of the present case, as in the\npresent case recovery of the naked body of the victim\n\nwas made from the room of accused Harswroop where\n\nhe himself accompanied the police and the\n\ncomplainant. Even if the confession made under\n\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. and under\nSection 164\nCr.P.C., it\n\nmust be taken into account that the recovery of the\n\nnaked dead body of the victim from his own room casts\n\nonus on accused Harswroop under\nSection 106\nof the\n\nIndian Evidence Act to lead evidence to show how this\n\ndead body came in his room. Moreover, the clothes\n\nand naked dead body of the victim were recovered\n\nfrom the room of accused Harswroop, and even this\n\nfact was stated by other accused persons Pappu and\n\nRoopwati, while giving statements under\nSection 313\n\nCr.P.C.\n\n56) In the same backdrop, learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the appellant referred to the judgments of\n\nSupreme Court in\nState of Karnataka Vs\n\nMahabaleshwar Gourya Naik\n, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 179\n\nand Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit Vs State of\n\nMaharashtra, (1981) 2 SCC 35. He has referred these\n\njudgments on the proposition that in a case of offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 376\nIPC, as per medical\n\njurisprudence smegma would require 24 hours to re-\naccumulate after intercourse and presence of smegma\n\nperhaps exclude the possibility of recent sexual\n\nintercourse but its absence will not necessarily establish\n\nthat the person has had a recent intercourse.\n\n57) Even the ratio of the above two judgments\n\nwill not be applicable to the facts of the present case,\n\nas in the present case, after medical examination of the\n\naccused Harswroop, as per the opinion given by P.W.11\n\nRajeev Kumar it was found that the colour of the glans\n\npenis was reddish especially base of glans penis was\n\nred, pubic hair present. In the opinion of P.W.11 the\n\npenis glans will be reddish when some forceful act is\n\ndone.\n\nApart from the opinion given by P.W.11, the\n\noffence punishable under\nSection 5\n/\nof POCSO Act,\n\nwhich is similar in nature to an offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 377\nof IPC makes it clear that rape,\n\nsexual assault includes penetration of penis or anything\n\ninto vagina or anus, using of mouth on vagina, anus\n\netc. or making her use of mouth on penis etc. or to\n\nmanipulates her body in such a way that the act is\n\ndone in furtherance to commit rape.\nIn the POCSO Act\n\ncases, even if body of a victim is touched it amounts to\n\npenetrative sexual assault, and when the victim is\nunder twelve years of age under\nSection 5(m)\nof\n\nPOCSO Act, said Act is attracted. The medical evidence\n\nwas sufficient to prove that confession of the accused\n\nHarswroop while making his statement under\nSection\nCr.P.C. and 164\nCr.P.C\n. were correct, and not\n\nfalse.\n\n58) Reference can now be made to a recent\n\njudgment of Supreme Court in Perumal Raja @\n\nPerumal Vs State, Rep. by Inspector of Police, 2024\n\n0 AIR(SC) 460, where the Supreme Court while\n\nexamining a case of circumstantial evidence has held\n\nthat distinction has to be drawn between incomplete\n\nchain of circumstances and a circumstance after a\n\nchain is complete and defence or explanation given by\n\naccused is found to be false in which event said\n\nfalsehood is added to reinforce conclusion of court. If\n\ndefence case is false it would constitute an additional\n\nlink for the case of prosecution. While dealing with\n\nthe confessional statements, the Supreme Court\n\nobserved that the bar under\nSection 25\nof Evidence\n\nAct would apply. The expression \"accused person\" in\n\nSection 24\n, and expression \"a person accused of any\n\noffence\" in\nSections 26\nand\nhave some\n\nconnotation, and describe the person against whom\nevidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding.\n\nThe term \"accused of any offence\" is descriptive of\n\nperson against whom a confessional statement made\n\nby him is declared not provable and does not\n\npredicate a condition of that person at the time of\n\nmaking statement. Confession includes not only\n\nadmission of offence but all other admissions of\n\nincriminating facts related to offence, except to the\n\nextent that the ban is lifted by\nSection 27\nof the\n\nEvidence Act. Relevant paragraphs of above said\n\njudgment of the Supreme Court are reproduced as\n\nunder :\n\n\"32.\nIn\nState of Maharashtra Vs Suresh\n,\n(2000) 1 SCC 471, this Court in the facts therein\nheld that recovery of a dead body, which was from\nthe place pointed out by the accused, was a\nformidable incriminating circumstances. This would,\nthe Court held, reveal that the dead body was\nconcealed by the accused unless there is material\nand evidence to show that somebody else had\nconcealed it and this fact came to the knowledge of\nthe accused either because he had seen that person\nconcealing the dead body or was told by someone\nelse that the dead body was concealed at the said\nlocation. Here, if the accused declines and does not\ntell the criminal court that his knowledge of the\nconcealment was on the basis of the possibilities\nthat absolve him, the court can presume that the\ndead body (or physical object, as the case may be)\nwas concealed by the accused himself. This is\nbecause the person who can offer the explanation as\nto how he came to know of such concealment is the\naccused. If the accused chooses to refrain from\ntelling the court as to how else he came to know of\nit, the presumption is that the concealment was by\nthe accused himself.\n\n40. The appellant - Perumal Raja @ Perumal\nin his statement under\nSection 313\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 plainly denied all\naccusations without furnishing any explanation\nregarding his knowledge of the places from which\nthe dead body was recovered. In this circumstance,\nthe failure of the appellant - Perumal Raja @\nPerumal to present evidence on his behalf or to offer\nany cogent explanation regarding the recovery of\nthe dead body by virtue of his special knowledge\nmust lead to a reasonable adverse inference, by\napplication of the principle under\nSection 106\nof the\nEvidence Act, thus forming an additional link in the\nchain of circumstances. The additional link further\naffirms the conclusion of guilt as indicated by the\nprosecution evidence.\n\n41. The whereabouts of Rajini @ Rajinikanth\nwere unknown. The perpetrator(s) were also\nunknown. It is only consequent to the disclosure\nstatement by the appellant - Perumal Raja @\nPermual, that the police came to know that Rajini @\nRajinikanth had been murdered and his body was\nfirst dumped in the sump tank and after some\nmonths, it was retrieved, cut into two parts, put in\nsack bags, and thrown in the river/canal. The\npolice, accordingly, proceeded on the leads and\nrecovered the parts of the dead body from the sump\ntank and sack bags from the river/canal. It has\nbeen also established that Rajini @ Rajinikanth was\nmurdered. In addition, there have been recoveries\nof the motorcycle and other belongings at the behest\nof the appellant - Perumal Raja @ Perumal. These\nfacts, in the absence of any other material to doubt\nthem, establish indubitable conclusion that the\nappellant - Perumal Raja @ Perumal is guilty of\nhaving committed murder of Rajini @ Rajinikanth.\nThe presence of motive reinforces the above\nconclusion.\"\n\n59) The ratio of the above said judgment is\n\ndirectly applicable to the facts of the present case.\n\nThe recovery was made on the statement given by\n\naccused Harswroop while he accompanied the police\n\nfrom fish market to police station, and thereafter to\n\nhis house. The naked dead body of the deceased\n\nvictim was recovered from the room of the accused\n\nhidden in a jute bag, and clothes worn by the\n\ndeceased victim along with slippers were also\n\nrecovered from the same room. Hence, as per\n\nSection 27\nof the Evidence Act, accused failed to give\n\nany explanation as to how these things came in his\n\nroom, and in this backdrop, the recovery of naked\n\ndead body in itself from his own room, whose\n\npresence was not explained by the accused\n\nHarswroop, completes the chain of circumstantial\n\nevidence.\n60) Another important fact is that the\n\ncomplainant's family and family of the accused were\n\nneighbours and there were known to each other. It is\n\nthe case of the prosecution that on 19.02.2019,\n\naccused Harswroop came to his house in a drunkard\n\nstate and he himself has stated that he had lured the\n\nchild from the roof to his room by offering toffee. Ante\n\nmortem injuries were found on the dead body of victim\n\nduring postmortem. As per the postmortem report\n\nproved by P.W.5 Dr. Nagender Singh there were\n\nscratch marks on the neck, forearm and two scratch\n\nmarks on left and right side of stomach just above the\n\nhip bone. On examination of the anal portion of the\n\ndead body it was found that outer area of anal passage\n\nwas 4 cm. and the anal canal depth was 6 cm. and\n\nbroadened. It was visible easily. The stool was\n\npresent on the out area of the anal canal. The tongue\n\nwas protruding outside the mouth. The death of the\n\nvictim was due to asphyxia as a result of ante mortem\n\nstrangulation. The prosecution was successful to prove\n\nits case beyond reasonable doubt that accused\n\nHarswroop had kidnapped the deceased victim with a\n\nmotive to sodomize him. After the act of sodomy /\n\naggravated penetrative assault, accused murdered the\nvictim and hide the dead body in a jute bag in his room\n\nto cause disappearance of the evidence. Hence,\n\naccused Harswaroop has rightly been convicted for the\n\noffences punishable under\nSections 364\n,\n,\n,\nof IPC. Also, keeping in view the fact that the victim\n\nwas 07 years old dumb child, and below 12 years, the\n\naccused Harswroop was rightly convicted and\n\nsentenced for the offence punishable under\nSection 6\n\nPOCSO Act. Hence, no interference is called for in the\n\njudgment of the trial court recording the conviction\n\nagainst the accused Harswroop on above said counts.\n\nThe appeal filed by accused-appellant Harswroop is\n\nliable to be dismissed.\n\n61) With respect to the appeals filed by other\n\naccused persons Pappu and Roopwati since the appeal\n\nof convict Harswroop has been dismissed keeping in\n\nview the statements recorded by them under\nSection\nCr.P.C., even these two accused persons did not\n\nlead any evidence in defence to show that Harswroop\n\nhad not committed the crime, rather they had stated\n\nthat the clothes of the naked deceased victim were\n\nrecovered from the room of convict Harswroop, hence\n\ntheir conviction under\nSection 201\nIPC is also proved\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt, and they have been rightly\nconvicted and sentenced by the court below on said\n\ncount. Thus, the appeals filed by convicts Pappu and\n\nRoopwati are also liable to be dismissed.\n\nQuantum of sentence :\n\n62) The lower court has referred to the\n\njudgments of the Supreme Court in\nShankar Kisanrao\n\nKhade Vs State of Maharashtra\n, (2013) 5 SCC 546;\n\nKamta Tiwari Vs State of M.P.\n, decided on\n\n04.09.1996;\nState of Karnataka Vs Krishnappa\n,\n\n(2004) 4 SCC 75; and\nGurvail Singh @ Gala and\n\nanother Vs State of Punjab\n, AIR 2013 SC 1177.\n\nIn\n\nKamta Tiwari\n(supra) death penalty was awarded to\n\nan accused, who has committed rape on a seven year\n\nold girl, and he was in a position of trust.\n\n63) In the case in hand, lower court observed\n\nthat the victim at the time of the incident was a\n\nyoung boy about 7 years of age. He must have\n\nundergone severe pain and found himself helpless.\n\nThe inability of the victim to speak properly which has\n\ncome in evidence of the witnesses P.W.1, P.W.2,\n\nP.W.3 and P.W.4, and said fact has also been\n\nadmitted by convict Harswroop in his statement\n\nrecorded under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. Further the court\n\nbelow observed that Harswroop was not seen in pain\nor no remorse on his face, and he kept smiling whole\n\ntime when his statements were recorded. He did not\n\neven plead for his innocence in front of the court. He\n\ndid not adduce any defence evidence and even his\n\nparents held him responsible for the entire case, and\n\nfinally the court below held that Harswroop had\n\nintentionally and knowingly committed the murder of\n\nthe victim aged 7 years, and in this backdrop, the\n\nconvict Harswroop was awarded the death penalty\n\nunder\nSection 302\nIPC.\n\n64) In the facts of the present case, convict-\n\nappellant Harswroop is 24 years old poor person, and\n\nhad no previous criminal history. He had lost his\n\nmother when he was only four and a half years old.\n\nHe was brought up by his stepmother. Convict-\n\nappellant was an alcoholic, and as per the evidence\n\nbrought on record, he used to do only daily wage\n\nwork. His mental status could not be of a satisfied\n\nperson being a daily wager.\n\n65) Reference can now be made to the judgments\n\nof the Supreme Court where the sentence of capital\n\npunishment was committed to life imprisonment.\n66) In 1973, the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nJagmohan Singh Vs State of U.P.\n(1973) 1 SCC 20,\n\nexamined the question whether death sentence awarded\n\nby a court under\nSection 302\nof Indian Penal Code, 1880\n\nwas violative of sub-clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nof the\n\nConstitution. As per Sub-Section (5) of\nSection 367\nof\n\nCriminal Procedure Code, there was a discretion with the\n\ncourt either to award capital sentence or life\n\nimprisonment. The Supreme Court held that\nArticle 19\n\nof the Constitution does not directly deal with the\n\nfreedom to live. It is not included in the seven freedoms\n\nmentioned in that Article. As far as India is concerned,\n\ncapital punishment cannot be described as unusual\n\nbecause that kind of punishment has been with us from\n\nancient times right up to the present day though the\n\nnumber of offences for which it can be imposed has\n\ncontinuously changed. The framers of our Constitution\n\nwere well aware of the existence of capital punishment\n\nas a permissible punishment under the law. The other\n\nArticles in the Constitution, viz., Section 72(1)(c), 72(3),\nand 134 and\nSections 401\nand\nof the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure and the Entries 1 and 2 in List III of\n\nthe Seventh Schedule, all indicate that capital sentence\nhas not been regarded per se as unreasonable or not in\n\nthe public interest.\n\n67) After the amendment by Act 26 of 1955, it\n\nwas left to the judicial discretion of the court whether\n\nthe death sentence or the lesser sentence should be\n\nimposed.\nArticle 14\ncannot be invoked in matters of\n\njudicial discretion. If the law has given to the Judges\n\nwide discretion in matter of sentence to be exercised by\n\nhim after balancing all the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances of the crime, it will be impossible to say\n\nthat there would be at all any discrimination, since facts\n\nand circumstances of one case can hardly be the same\n\nas the facts and circumstances of another. In a criminal\n\ntrial, the accused who is charged for murder knows that\n\nhe is liable to sentence of death in the committing court\n\nitself. The accused has a right to examine himself as a\n\nwitness, and thereafter, give evidence on the material\n\nfacts. He and his counsel are at liberty to address the\n\ncourt not merely on the question of guilt but also on the\n\nquestion of sentence, and so on. After the prosecution\n\nand the accused have had their full say, the court is\n\nprincipally concerned with the facts and circumstances,\n\nwhether aggravating or mitigating, which are connected\n\nwith the particular crime under inquiry. In this\nbackdrop, the procedure established by law cannot be\n\nsaid to be unconstitutional under\nArticle 21.\n\n68) The Supreme Court also examined several\n\nstudies made by Western Scholars to show the\n\nineffectiveness of capital punishment either as a\n\ndeterrent or as an appropriate retribution. The Supreme\n\nCourt Judges in the above study observed that social\n\nconditions are different and also the general intellectual\n\nlevel. The only authoritative study in India is that of the\n\nLaw Commission of India published in the year 1967.\n\nOne the basis of its conclusions it is difficult to hold that\n\ncapital punishment as such is unreasonable or not\n\nrequired in public interest. The policy of the law in\n\ngiving a very wide discretion in the matter of\n\npunishment to the Judge has its origin and impossibility\n\nof laying down standards.\n\n69) The impossibility of laying down standards is\n\nat the very core of the Criminal Law as administered in\n\nIndia which invests the Judges with a very wide\n\ndiscretion in the matter of fixing the degree of\n\npunishment. This discretion in the matter of sentence is\n\nliable to be corrected by superior courts. Laying down of\n\nstandards to the limited extent possible as was done in\nthe Mode Judicial Code would not serve the purpose.\n\nThe exercise of judicial discretion of well-recognised\n\nprinciples is, in the final analysis, the safest possible\n\nsafeguards for the accused. The\nCode of Criminal\n\nProcedure\nlays down a detailed procedure and this\n\nprocedure is limited to the finding of the guilt. The\n\nSupreme Court finally held that it was necessary to\n\nemphasize that the court was principally concerned with\n\nthe facts and circumstances, whether aggravating or\n\nmitigating, which are connected with the particular crime\n\nunder inquiry.\n\n70) In paragraph 29 of the\nJagmohan\n's case\n\n(supra), the Supreme Court observed as under :\n\n\"However, it is necessary to emphasize that the\ncourt is principally concerned with the facts and\ncircumstances, whether aggravating or mitigating,\nwhich are connected with the particular crime under\ninquiry. All such facts and circumstances are capable of\nbeing proved in accordance with the provisions of the\n\nIndian Evidence Act\nin a trial regulated by the\nCr.P.C\n.\nThe trial does not come to an end until all the relevant\nfacts are proved and the counsel on both sides have an\nopportunity to address the court. The only thing that\nremains is for the judge to decide on the guilt and\npunishment and that is what\nSections 306(2)\nand\n\n309(2)\n, Cr.P.C. purport to provide for. These\nprovisions are part of the procedure established by law\nand, unless it is shown that they are invalid for any\nother reasons, they must be regarded as valid. No\nreasons are offered to show that they are\nconstitutionally invalid, and, hence, the death sentence\nimposed after trial in accordance with the procedure\nestablished by law is not unconstitutional under Article\n\n21.\"\n\n71) Thereafter, in\nBachan Singh Vs State of\n\nPunjab\n(1980) 2 SCC 684, a larger bench of Supreme\n\nCourt consisting of five judges has affirmed the view\n\ntaken in\nJagmohan\n's case (supra), and has affirmed the\n\nproposition that the provisions of death penalty for an\n\noffence punishable under\nSection 302\nIPC, and the\n\nsentencing procedure\nlaid down in\nsub-section (3) of\n\nSection 354 of Criminal procedure Code, requires that\n\nspecial reasons have to be recorded for awarding a\n\ndeath penalty, and these provisions are not violative of\n\nArticle 14\n, 19\nand\n21.\n\n72) While approving the judgment in Jagmohan's\n\ncase (supra), the Supreme Court also referred to the\n\nnew provision in sub-section (3) of\nSection 354\nof the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, that award of death\n\nsentence was an exception to be made for \"exceptional\n\nreasons\" founded on grave circumstances of the\n\nparticular case relating to the crime and the criminal.\n73) In Paragraphs 160, 161 & 162 of the Supreme\n\nCourt judgment rendered in\nBachan Singh\n's case\n\n(supra), it has been observed as under :\n\n\"160.\nIn the light of the above conspectus, we\nwill now consider the effect of the aforesaid\nlegislative changes on the authority and efficacy of\nthe propositions\nlaid down by\nthis Court in\n\nJagmohan\n's case. These propositions may be\nsummed up as under:\n\n(i) The general legislative policy that underlies\nthe structure of our criminal law, principally\ncontained in the\nIndian Penal Code\nand the\nCriminal\nProcedure Code\n, is to define an offence with\nsufficient clarity and to prescribe only the maximum\npunishment therefor, and to allow a very wide\ndiscretion to the Judge in the matter of fixing the\ndegree of punishment.\n\nWith the solitary exception of Section 303, the\nsame policy permeates Section 302 and some other\nsections of the Penal Code, where the maximum\npunishment is the death penalty.\n\n(ii)(a) No exhaustive enumeration of\naggravating or mitigating circumstances which\nshould be considered when sentencing an offender,\nis possible. \"The infinite variety of cases and facets\nto each case would make general standards either\nmeaningless 'boiler plate' or a statement of the\nobvious that no Jury (Judge) would need.\" (Referred\nto McGoutha v. California, (1971) 402 US 183.\n\n(b) The impossibility of laying down standards\nis at the very core of the criminal law as\nadministered in India which invests the Judges with\na very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the\ndegree of punishment.\n\n(iii) The view taken by the plurality in Furman\nv. Georgia, 408 US 238 (1972), decided by the\nSupreme Court of the United States, to the effect,\nthat a law which gives uncontrolled and un-guided\ndiscretion to the Jury (or the Judge) to choose\narbitrarily between a sentence of death and\nimprisonment for a capital offence, violates the\nEighth Amendment, is not applicable in India. We do\nnot have in out Constitution any provision like the\nEighth Amendment, nor are we at liberty to apply\nthe test of reasonableness with the freedom with\nwhich the Judges of the Supreme Court of America\nare accustomed to apply \"the due process\" clause.\nThere are grave doubts about the expediency of\ntransplanting western experience in our country.\nSocial conditions are different and so also the\ngeneral intellectual level. Arguments which would be\nvalid in respect of one area of the world may not\nhold good in respect of another area.\n\n(iv)(a) This discretion in the matter of sentence\nis to be exercised by the Judge judicially, after\nbalancing all the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances of the crime.\n\n(b) The discretion is liable to be corrected by\nsuperior courts. The exercise of judicial discretion on\nwell-recognised principles is, in the final analysis,\nthe safest possible safeguard for the accused.\n\nIn view of the above, it will be impossible to\nsay that there would be at all any discrimination,\nsince crime as crime may appear to be superficially\nthe same but the facts and circumstances of a crime\nare widely different. Thus considered, the provision\nin Section 302, Penal Code is not violative of\nArticle\nof the Constitution on the ground that it confers\non the Judges an unguided and uncontrolled\ndiscretion in the matter of awarding capital\npunishment or imprisonment for life.\n\n(v)(a) Relevant facto and circumstances\nimpinging on the nature and circumstances of the\ncrime can be brought before the Court at the pre-\nconviction stage, notwithstanding the fact that no\nformal procedure for producing evidence regarding\nsuch facts and circumstances had been specifically\nprovided. Where counsel addresses the Court with\nregard to the character and standing of the accused,\nthey are duly considered by the Court unless there is\nsomething in the evidence itself which belies him or\nthe Public Prosecutor challenges the facts.\n\n(b) It is to be emphasised that in exercising its\ndiscretion to choose either of the two alternative\nsentences provided in Section 302, Penal Code, \"the\nCourt is principally concerned with the facts and\ncircumstances whether aggravating or mitigating,\nwhich are connected with the particular crime under\ninquiry. All such facts and circumstances are capable\nof being proved in accordance With the provisions of\nthe\nIndian Evidence Act\nin a trial regulated by the\n\nCr.P.C\n. The trial does not come to an end until all\nthe relevant facts are proved and the counsel on\nboth sides have an opportunity to address the Court.\nThe only thing that remains is for the Judge to\ndecide on the guilt and punishment and that is what\nSections 306(2)\nand\n309(2)\n, Cr.P.C. purport to\nprovide for. These provisions are part of the\nprocedure established by law and unless it is shown\nthat they are invalid for any other reasons they must\nbe regarded as valid. No reasons are offered to show\nthat they are constitutionally invalid and hence the\ndeath sentence imposed after trial in accordance\nwith the procedure established by law is not tin-\nconstitutional under\nArticle 21.\n(emphasis added).\n\n161. A study of the propositions set out above,\nwill show that, in substance, the authority of none of\nthem has been affected by the legislative changes\nsince the decision in\nJagmohan\n's case. Of course,\ntwo of them require to be adjusted and attuned to\nthe shift in the legislative policy. The first of those\npropositions is No. (iv)(a) which postulates, that\naccording to the then extant\nCrPC\nboth the\nalternative sentences provided in Section 302, Penal\nCode are normal sentences, and the court can,\ntherefore, after weighing the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances of the particular case, in its\ndiscretion, impose either of those sentences. This\npostulate has now been modified by Section 354(3)\nwhich mandates the Court convicting a person for an\noffence punishable with death or, in the alternative\nwith imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a\nterm of years, not to impose the sentence of death\non that person unless there are \"special reasons\" -\nto be recorded - for such sentence. The expression\n\"special reasons\" in the context of this provision,\nobviously means \"exceptional reasons\" founded on\nthe exceptionally grave circumstances of the\nparticular case relating to the crime as well as the\ncriminal. Thus, the legislative policy now writ large\nand clear on the face of Section 354(3) is that on\nconviction for murder and other capital offences\npunishable in the alternative with death under the\nPenal Code, the extreme penalty should be imposed\nonly in extreme cases.\n\n162.\nIn this view we are in accord with the\ndictum of this Court in\nBalwant Singh v. State of\nPunjab\n, 1976 SCC (Cri) 43, wherein the\ninterpretation of Section 354(3) first came up for\nconsideration. After surveying the legislative\nbackground, one of us (Untwalia, J.) speaking for\nthe court, summed up the scope and implications of\nSection 354(3), thus:\n\nUnder this provision the Court is required\nto state the reasons for the sentence awarded\nand in the case of sentence of death, special\nreasons are required to be stated. It would\nthus be noticed that awarding of the sentence\nother than the sentence of death is the general\nrule now and only special reasons, that is to\nsay, special facts and circumstances in a given\ncase, will warrant the passing of the death\nsentence. It is unnecessary nor is it possible to\nmake a catalogue of the special reasons which\nmay justify the passing of the death sentence\nin a case.\n\nWhile applying proposition (iv)(a), therefore,\nthe Court has to bear in mind this fundamental\nprinciple of policy embodied in Section 354(3).\"\n\n74) The Supreme Court further observed that\n\nthere could be no rigid standards which can be\nlaid down\n\nin\nthe form of guidelines with respect to area of\n\nimposition of death penalty. The purpose of \"laying\n\ndown standards\" meant that 'murder' should be\n\ncategorised beforehand according to the degrees of its\n\nculpability and all aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances should be exhaustively and rigidly\n\nenumerated so as to exclude all free play of discretion.\n\nSuch standardisation was not possible. Firstly, the\n\ndegree of culpability cannot be measured in each case;\n\nsecondly, criminal cases cannot be categorized where\n\nthere are infinite, unpredictable and unforeseeable\n\nvariations; thirdly, on such categorisation the sentencing\n\nprocess will cease to be judicial; and, fourthly, such\n\nstandardization or sentencing discretion is a policy\nmatter belonging to legislation beyond the court's\n\nfunction. In this backdrop, no rigid standard in this area\n\ncan be laid down. Some broad guidelines consistent\n\nwith the policy indicated by the legislature in Section\n\n354(3) can be taken. The Court finally has to pay due\n\nregard both to the crime and the criminal. What is\n\nrelative weight to be given to the aggravating and\n\nmitigating factors, depends on the facts and\n\ncircumstances of a particular case. In many cases, the\n\nextremely cruel or beastly manner of the commission of\n\nmurder is itself a demonstrated index of the depraved\n\ncharacter of the perpetrator. Hence, it is not desirable\n\nto consider the circumstances of the crime and the\n\ncircumstances of the criminal in two separate watertight\n\ncompartments. The Judges should never be\n\nbloodthirsty. Hence, courts aided by the broad\n\nillustrative guidelines will discharge the onerous function\n\nwith evermore scrupulous care and humane concern. As\n\nper the legislative policy guidelines in sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 354, i.e., for the person convicted of murder, life\n\nimprisonment is the rule and death sentence an\n\nexception. A real and abiding concern for the dignity of\n\nhuman life postulates resistance to taking a life through\n\nlaw's instrumentality. That ought not to be done save in\nthe rarest of rare cases when the alternative option is\n\nunquestionably foreclosed.\n\n75) The Supreme Court, thereafter, in\nMachhi\n\nSingh and others Vs State of Punjab\n, (1983) 3 SCC\n\n470, followed the guidelines\nlaid down by\nit in\nBachan\n\nSingh\n's case (supra), and examined the case of a death\n\nsentence imposed on Machhi Singh, Kashmir Singh,\n\nJagir Singh by the Sessions Court as confirmed by the\n\nHigh Court. They confirmed the death sentence awarded\n\nto the above said three accused. While, affirming the\n\ndeath sentence, in paragraph 32 of said judgment, the\n\nSupreme Court observed as under :\n\n\"32. The reasons why the community as a whole\ndoes not endorse the humanistic approach reflected in\n'death sentence-in-no-case' doctrine are not far to\nseek. In the first place, the very humanistic edifice is\nconstructed on the foundation of 'reverence for life'\nprinciple. When a member of the community violates\nthis very principle by killing another member, the\nsociety may not feel itself bound by the shackles of this\ndoctrine. Secondly, it has to be realized that every\nmember of the community is able to live with safety\nwithout his or her own life being endangered because of\nthe protective arm of the community and on account of\nthe rule of law enforced by it. The every existence of\nthe rule of law and the fear of being brought to book\noperates as a deterrent of those who have no scruples\nin killing others if it suits their ends. Every member of\nthe community owes a debt to the community for this\nprotection. When ingratitude is shown instead of\ngratitude by 'killing' a member of the community which\nprotects the murderer himself from being killed, or\nwhen the community feels that for the sake of self-\npreservation the killer has to be killed, the community\nmay well withdraw the protection by sanctioning the\ndeath penalty. But the community will not do so in\nevery case. It may do so 'in rarest of rare cases' when\nits collective conscience is so shocked that it will expect\nthe holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death\npenalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards\ndesirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty. The\ncommunity may entertain such a sentiment when the\ncrime is viewed from the platform of the motive for, or\nthe manner of commission of the crime, or the anti-\nsocial or abhorrent nature of the crime.\"\n\n76) All the three accused had murdered two\n\ninnocent and helpless women named Ghamo Bai and\n\nRajo Bai in a helpless and defenceless state in their own\n\nhouse. A couple namely Bishan Singh and his wife Paro\n\nBai were killed in similar circumstances. Sahib Singh,\n\nMukhtiar Singh, Manto Bai, Palo Bai and Jita Singh were\n\nkilled by five men including Machhi Singh and Jagir\n\nSingh. They put to death a young newly married couple\n\nand rendered a young woman a widow. The appeal filed\n\nby above accused was dismissed by the Supreme Court\n\nfollowing the guidelines indicated in\nBachan Singh\n's case\n\n(supra).\n\n77) Recently, the Supreme court in the case of\n\nDigambar Vs The State of Maharashta, 2023 2 CriCC\n\n647, had an occasion to examine whether death penalty\n\ncould be awarded in case of an honour killing. In that\n\ncase, the Supreme Court observed that the appellant\n\nDigambar was a young boy of 25 years at the time of\n\nincident and had not acted in a brutal manner as there\nwas one single injury inflicted on both deceased. As far\n\nas offence punishable under Section 302 is concerned,\n\nthe Supreme Court held that the prosecution had\n\nestablished that the deceased and accused persons left\n\nthe house together and soon thereafter the death of\n\ndeceased person had occurred. The accused were held\n\nguilty of the offence punishable under\nSection 302\nIPC.\n\nHowever, keeping in view the fact that appellant\n\nDigambar was 25 years of age, it was not considered to\n\nbe a 'rarest of rare' case. He was held to be not a\n\nperson with criminal mindset and criminal records, and\n\nin this backdrop, the sentence of capital punishment was\n\ncommitted to life imprisonment. The Supreme Court\n\nhad also taken into account the report of the Probation\n\nOfficer. As per said report, the Sarpanch and people of\n\nthe village had stated that inter-caste marriage of\n\ndeceased friend Govind and deceased sister Pooja was\n\nputting social pressure and being angry about it, the\n\nincident took place in sudden provocation by Digambar.\n\nHowever, overall behaviour of Digamber was found to be\n\ngood.\n\n78) The Supreme Court also referred to the case\n\nof Gandi Doddabasappa alias\nGandhi Basavaraj Vs\n\nState of Karnataka\n, (2017) 5 SCC 415, wherein the\naccused had committed murder of his daughter, who\n\nwas in the advanced stage of pregnancy. The Supreme\n\nCourt had upheld the conviction of the accused in\n\nrespect of offence punishable under\nSection 302\nIPC, but\n\ncommuted the sentence from capital punishment to\n\nimprisonment for life.\n\n79) Similarly, in the case of\nPrakash Dhawal\n\nKhairnar (Patil) Vs State of Maharashtra\n, (2002) 2 SCC\n\n35, the appellant was a Senior Scientific Assistant. He\n\nwiped out his brother's entire family. The Supreme\n\nCourt found that this was done by him on account of\n\nfrustration as his brother was not partitioning the alleged\n\njoint property. The Supreme Court held that the crime\n\nwas heinous and brutal, but the same could not be\n\nconsidered to be 'rarest of rare' case. It is, however,\n\nheld that it was difficult to hold that the accused was a\n\nmenace to the society, and that there was no reason to\n\nbelieve that he could not be reformed or rehabilitated.\n\n80) Also, Mohinder Singh Vs State of Punjab,\n\n(2013) 3 SCC 294, was a case where the accused had\n\ncommitted murder of his wife and daughter, and the\n\nSupreme Court had held that it could not be considered\nto be 'rarest of rare' case to inflict the capital\n\npunishment.\n\n81) The Supreme Court also referred to the case\n\nof Sundar @ Sundarrajan Vs State by Inspector of\n\nPolice [Review Petition (Criminal) Nos. 159-160 of\n\n2013, in Criminal Appeal Nos. 300-301 of 2011, dated\n\n21.03.2023], wherein it was held that 'rarest of rare'\n\ndoctrine does not require that in such a case only death\n\nsentence has to be imposed. The Court has to consider\n\nnot only the grave nature of crime, but also as to\n\nwhether there is possibility of reformation of a criminal.\n\n82) Supreme Court in the case of\nB.A. Umesh Vs\n\nUnion of India and others\n, Criminal Appeal No. 1892 of\n\n2022 (arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 890 of 2022,\n\ndecided on 04.11.2022, has also examined the issue\n\nwhether delay in execution of death sentence could be a\n\nsufficient ground for substituting death sentence by\n\nimprisonment for life.\n\n83) In the above matter, the Supreme Court was\n\nexamining the case where the execution of death\n\nsentence was due to the delay which took place in\n\nexecution of the death sentence due to pendency of\n\nmercy petition and reference was made to a judgment of\nAjay Kumar Pal Vs Union of India and another\n, 2015\n\n(2) SCC 478. In that case there was a delay of 03 years\n\nand 10 months, which was found to be inordinate and\n\nthe delay was not attributed to the accused / petitioner\n\nbut the delay was found on account of functionaries and\n\nauthorities in question.\n\n84) In paragraph 14 of the above said judgment,\n\nthe Supreme Court observed as under :\n\n\"Paras 44 and 48 of the decisions of this Court in\n\nShatrughan Chauhan and another Vs Union of India\n\nand others\n, (2014) 3 SCC 1, which were quoted in\nAjay\n\nKumar Pal\n(supra), had laid down that undue long\n\ndelay in execution of death sentence would entitle the\n\ncondemned prisoner to pray for commuting the death\n\nsentence to that of life imprisonment.\n\nThe individual\n\ncases were thereafter dealt with in\nShatrughan\n\nChauhan\n(supra) and paragraph 105 onwards of said\n\ndecision show that in cases where there was a delay of\n\n12 years (para 118), 9½ years (para 137), 9½ years\n\n(para 147), 7 years and 8 months (para 161), 5 years\n\nand 8 months (para 175) and 7 years and 5 months\n\n(para 209), the benefit of commutation was extended\n\nby this Court.\"\n85) In the case before the Supreme Court the\n\nmercy petition was received by the Central Government\n\non 03.03.2011, and it was disposed of on 15.05.2013.\n\nIn between, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of\n\nIndia, forwarded the mercy petition to the Principal\n\nSecretary, Home Department, Karnataka so that the\n\nGovernor, Karnataka could consider the mercy petition.\n\nThereafter, in the meantime, on 09.03.2011 in Writ\n\nPetition No. 52 of 2011, preferred by the accused-\n\nappellant, Supreme Court granted stay of execution of\n\ndeath sentence. Before the Central Government\n\nauthorities, the State Cabinet on 07.05.2012, decided to\n\napprove the note prepared by the Home Department\n\nrecommending rejection of mercy petition. The\n\nGovernor also rejected the mercy petition on\n\n06.06.2012, and subsequently, the matter was referred\n\nto the Central Government on 30.08.2012, and finally,\n\nthe Hon'ble President after considering the mercy\n\npetition, rejected the mercy petition on 12.05.2013.\n\nHence, a period of 02 years and 03 months was taken to\n\ndispose of the mercy petition.\n\n86) In\nA.G. Perarivalan Vs State\nthrough\n\nSuperintendent of Police and another, 2022 SCC Online\n\nSC 635, a bench of three Judges of Supreme Court had\ncommuted the sentence of death to life in a petition filed\n\nunder\nArticle 161\nof the Constitution keeping in view the\n\nfact that the petition remained pending for 2½ years\n\nwith the Hon'ble Governor, despite recommendation of\n\nthe State Cabinet for remission of the sentence.\n\n87) In the present case, the judgment was passed\n\non 06.03.2021, and the Reference is now being decided\n\nafter a gap of almost more than three years. If there is\n\na delay in deciding the Reference that is one of the\n\nreasons this Court can take into account for commuting\n\nthe death penalty.\n\n88) It must also be borne in mind that imposition\n\nof death penalty is exception rather than a rule, and\n\nfurther special reasons must be given. The extreme\n\npenalty of death is to be awarded to a convict only in\n\nthose discerning few cases where the murder committed\n\nby him is shocking, brutal diabolical and revolting and\n\nthe tremors of which are felt far and wide. In the\n\npresent case, the convict is 24 years of age and did not\n\nhave the criminal background. There is scope for\n\nreformation of the convict. There is every hope that by\n\nassociating him with counselors, his mindset could be\n\nreformed while in custody and even while he is in\ncustody, he can be given training to lead a good life by\n\ngiving him technical skills to make a good livelihood so\n\nthat he can be reformed. Hence, it will be in the interest\n\nof justice that the death sentence awarded to convict\n\nHarswroop be commuted to imprisonment for life.\n\n89) In view of the foregoing discussion, Criminal\n\nReference No. 01 of 2021 in respect of convict-appellant\n\nHarswroop made by the trial court so far as the\n\nconfirmation of sentence of death to him is concerned is\n\nanswered in negative.\n\n90) Instead of confirming the sentence of death\n\nawarded by the trial court, (in exercise of powers\n\nconferred under\nSection 368(a)\nCr.P.C.) the sentence\n\nof death is commuted to imprisonment for life against\n\nconvict Harswroop.\n\n91) The conviction recorded by the trial court in\n\nS.S.T. No. 104 of 2019, under\nSection 364\n,\n,\nIPC, and the one under\nSection 6\nof POCSO Act,\n\nagainst accused-appellant Harswroop is affirmed.\n\nConvict Harswroop is sentenced to undergo\n\nimprisonment for life with the stipulation that he shall\n\nnot be entitled to premature release or remission\nbefore undergoing actual imprisonment for a period of\n\n20 years.\n\n92) The conviction recorded by the trial court in\n\nS.S.T. No. 104 of 2019, under\nSection 201\nIPC\n\nagainst accused-appellants persons Pappu and\n\nRoopwati is affirmed.\n\n93) The other terms of sentences awarded to all\n\nthe convicts including fine amount and default\n\nstipulations also stand confirmed. All the substantive\n\nsentences awarded to the convict Harswroop shall run\n\nconcurrently.\n\n94) The Criminal Jail Appeal filed by the\n\naccused-appellant Harswroop against the conviction\n\nand sentences awarded by the trial court in S.S.T. No.\n\n104 of 2019 in respect of offences punishable under\n\nSection 364\n,\n,\nIPC, and one under Section 6\n\nof the PCSO Act stands dismissed.\n\n95) The Criminal Jail appeals filed by accused-\n\nappellants Pappu and Roopwati against their\n\nconviction and sentence awarded by the trial court in\n\nS.S.T. No. 104 of 2019 in respect of offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 201\nIPC also stand\n\ndismissed.\n96) The Criminal Jail Appeal filed by accused-\n\nappellant Harswroop in respect of offences punishable\n\nunder\nSection 364\n,\nand\nIPC, and one under\n\nSection 6\nof the POCSO Act, having been dismissed,\n\nhis sentence is modified as directed in Paras 91 and\n\n93 above.\n\n97) Let a copy of this Judgment be sent to the trial\n\ncourt with reference to its letter dated 08.03.2021, in\n\nS.S.T. No. 104 of 2019. A copy of this judgment be also\n\nsent to the Superintendents of Jail concerned where the\n\nconvicts are presently serving out their sentences, for\n\nensuring compliance of this order. Lower court record\n\nbe sent back.\n\n______________\nRITU BAHRI, C.J.\n\n_________________\nALOK KUMAR VERMA, J.\n\nDt: 21ST MAY, 2024\nNegi",
