JUSTICE RAJESH SEKHRI, JUDGE\nJUDGEMENT\n\nPer Wasim Sadiq Nargal, J\n\nPRAYER\n\nThe instant writ petition has been filed on behalf of the petitioner, praying\nfor the following reliefs:-\n\n2|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\ni) Writ, order or direction including one in the nature of Certiorari :-\n\na) quashing the impugned order- Annexure-l so far as the same\npertains to the promotion of respondents 5 and 6 over the head of\nthe petitioner in the post of the Head Assistant;\n\nb) quashing the impugned order Annexure-ll rejecting the\npetitioner's representation by a non-speaking order;\n\nc) quashing the impugned entry of \"below average\" in the annual\nconfidential report of the petitioner for the year 2020, as conveyed\nto her vide communications dated 4-12-2022 and 17-1-2023\n(Annexures -III and IV).\n\nii) Writ, order or direction including one in the nature of Mandamus,\ncommanding upon the respondents not to give any effect to the\nimpugned orders and with a further direction upon them to accord\nconsideration to the claim of the petitioner for her promotion to\nthe post of Head Assistant w.e.f 24-11-2022, without taking into\nconsideration the adverse uncommunicated ACR of the year 2020\nand grant her all the benefits of seniority, pay and grade alongwith\narrears.\n\nFACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE\n\n1. The petitioner, a Senior Assistant in the High Court of J&K and\n\nLadakh, challenges the order dated 24.11.2022, whereby she was\n\ndenied promotion to the post of the Head Assistant and superseded by\n\nher juniors. The respondents justified the denial on the ground that\n\nthe petitioner secured only 54% (19 points) in the assessment of her\n\nAnnual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the period 2017-2021,\n\nfalling short of the mandatory 65% aggregate marks prescribed under\n\nOrder No. 415 dated 05.10.2020. The petitioner contends that the\n\n3|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\nadverse ACRs recorded for 2019-2021 were never communicated to\n\nher, violating her right to make representations against them. She\n\nfurther contends that the guidelines applied for her assessment were\n\noriginally framed for the post of Gazetted staff and could not be\n\nextended to her post without publication by way of a notification,\n\nrendering them inapplicable and unenforceable. The petitioner seeks\n\ndirections for her promotion with retrospective effect from the date\n\nher juniors were promoted.\n\n2. The respondents, on the other hand, admit that there is no record of\n\ncommunication of adverse ACRs but submitted that the petitioner's\n\nfailure to achieve the 65% aggregate marks, disqualified her from\n\npromotion. The further stand of the respondents 2 to 4 is that the\n\npetitioner did not challenge the validity of Order No. 415 in her writ\n\npetition, and as such, no relief can be granted on this ground. They\n\nfurther contend that publication of the executive order by way of a\n\nnotification was not required in the absence of any statutory mandate\n\nand that the order operates both retrospectively and prospectively for\n\nassessing promotions. Even if Order No. 415 is excluded, the\n\nrespondents submit that promotions to the post of Head Assistant are\n\nbased on seniority-cum-merit, and evaluation of ACRs remains an\n\nintegral part of the process. Accordingly, they pray for dismissal of\n\nthe writ petition while assuring that the petitioner's case for\n\npromotion will be considered in future as per the applicable rules and\n\npractices.\n\n4|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON THE BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n3. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that\n\nthe impugned orders denying promotion to the petitioner are illegal,\n\narbitrary, and contrary to settled principles of law, and are liable to be\n\nquashed. The said orders are based on an adverse Annual\n\nConfidential Report (ACR) for the year 2020, which was not\n\ncommunicated to the petitioner at the relevant time. The failure to\n\ncommunicate the adverse ACR deprives the petitioner of an\n\nopportunity to represent against the same, which is a fundamental\n\nviolation of law.\n\n4. It is the specific case of the petitioner that the respondents, while\n\nconsidering her case for promotion, were not aware of the fact that\n\nthe petitioner had rendered unblemished service for over fifteen\n\nyears, except for the alleged adverse ACR for 2020. This aspect of\n\nthe matter was deliberately concealed and suppressed by the\n\nauthorities in their decision-making process. The respondents failed\n\nto appreciate that the petitioner was on sanctioned medical leave for a\n\nsubstantial period in 2020 and that the entire year was severely\n\naffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the petitioner was\n\nnot engaged in any misconduct that could justify a \"below average\"\n\nrating in her ACR.\n\n5. The learned senior counsel, Mr. Haqani, further submits that the non-\n\ncommunication of the adverse ACR to the petitioner goes to the root\n\nof the case and renders the denial of promotion legally unsustainable.\n\n5|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\n6. Learned senior counsel also submits that the respondents have\n\ncommitted a grave illegality by rejecting the petitioner's\n\nrepresentation vide a non-speaking order dated 16.12.2022. Such an\n\norder, passed without assigning reasons, reflects complete non-\n\napplication of mind and violates the settled principle that reasons are\n\nthe soul of administrative and quasi-judicial decisions.\n\n7. The learned counsel highlights that the petitioner was senior to\n\nrespondents No. 5 and 6 in the seniority list and was otherwise fully\n\neligible for promotion. Denial of promotion to the petitioner, while\n\npromoting her juniors, is a clear case of supersession and violates the\n\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit applicable in such cases.\n\n8. It is further submitted that the respondents have mechanically applied\n\nguidelines for assessment and promotion which were neither\n\napplicable to the post of the petitioner nor duly published or notified.\n\nThis lack of proper procedure reflects arbitrariness and renders the\n\nimpugned orders legally unsustainable.\n\n9. Learned Counsel lastly submits that the petitioner has been subjected\n\nto serious prejudice as a result of the impugned orders and prays that\n\nthe impugned orders be quashed. It is further prayed that the\n\nrespondents be directed to consider the petitioner's claim for\n\npromotion to the post of Head Assistant w.e.f. 24.11.2022, with all\n\nconsequential benefits, without taking into account the\n\nuncommunicated and unjustified ACR for the year 2020.\n\n6|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\n10. Per Contra, The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondents submits that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is\n\ndevoid of merit, misconceived, and liable to be dismissed. The denial\n\nof promotion to the petitioner is neither arbitrary nor illegal but is\n\nbased on objective criteria and service records duly considered by the\n\ncompetent authority.\n\n11. It is submitted that the petitioner failed to secure the mandatory\n\naggregate of 65% marks in her Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs)\n\nfor the preceding five years, as required under Order No. 415 dated\n\n05.10.2020. This order, issued with the approval of the Hon'ble Chief\n\nJustice and Administrative Committee of the High Court, lays down a\n\nuniform standard for evaluating merit in promotions and has been\n\nconsistently applied for all non-gazetted posts in the High Court over\n\nthe last several years.\n\n12. The learned counsel further submits that the petitioner has not\n\nchallenged the validity or legality of Order No. 415 in her writ\n\npetition, and no relief has been sought against it in the prayer clause.\n\nIn the absence of such a challenge, the petitioner cannot now contend\n\nthat the said order is inapplicable to her case. Reliance is placed on\n\nMukesh Singh Kushwah v. State of MP, 2002 (1) SCC 598, wherein\n\nit was held that a relief not claimed, cannot be granted by the Court.\n\n13. It is the specific case of the respondents that the petitioner's adverse\n\nACR for the year 2020, though not formally communicated, was duly\n\nrecorded in the service records and formed part of the assessment\n\n7|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\nprocess for promotions. The absence of formal communication does\n\nnot by itself vitiate the assessment, especially when the evaluation is\n\nbased on cumulative service records.\n\n14. Learned counsel, Mr. M.I. Qadari, Senior Advocate, submits that the\n\nstand of the petitioner, requiring publication of executive orders in\n\nthe Gazette is misplaced. There is no statutory mandate under the\n\napplicable service rules requiring publication of Order No. 415 in the\n\nofficial Gazette. The order was issued as an administrative instruction\n\nto streamline promotions and ensure merit-based advancement.\n\n15. It is further submitted that even if Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 is\n\nexcluded, the principle of seniority-cum-merit as envisaged under\n\nOrder No. 517 dated 24.10.2008 requires consideration of both\n\nseniority and merit. The petitioner's merit was duly assessed on the\n\nbasis of her ACRs for the preceding five years, and she did not meet\n\nthe required standard for promotion.\n\n16. Learned senior counsel further emphasizes that the petitioner's\n\nsupersession does not violate any of her rights, as promotion is not a\n\nmatter of right but is subject to availability of posts and suitability of\n\nthe candidate. The respondents acted in accordance with established\n\npractice and procedure while denying promotion to the petitioner.\n\n17. In view of the above, the learned counsel for the respondents submits\n\nthat the impugned orders are legal, justified, and passed after due\n\nconsideration of the petitioner's service record. The writ petition is\n\nwithout merit and liable to be dismissed.\n\n8|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\nISSUES TAKEN UP FOR DETERMINATION\n\n18. Heard learned counsel for both the parties at length and carefully\n\nperused the material on record. The following issues arise for\n\ndetermination:\n\nIssue no. i: Whether the non-communication of adverse entries\nin the petitioner's Annual Confidential Reports\n(ACRs) renders the respondent's decision to deny\npromotion legally unsustainable.\n\nIssue no. ii: Whether Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,\noriginally applicable to gazetted staff, could have\nbeen extended and applied to non-gazetted staff\nwithout proper notification highlighting the revised\nbenchmark for promotion?\n\nIssue no. iii: Whether Executive Order No. 415 operates\nretrospectively so as to govern the consideration of\npromotions pertaining to a period prior to its\nissuance.\n\nIssue no. iv: Whether the recording of the petitioner's Annual\nConfidential Report (ACR) for the year 2020 during\nthe period of her sanctioned medical leave due to\nCOVID-19, without due communication of the\nrecorded remarks irrespective of whether they were\nfavourable, average, or adverse vitiates the\nprocedural fairness required under service\njurisprudence.\n\nLEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n19. The issues framed above are now taken up for determination by us.\n\nEach issue is examined individually in the following paragraphs,\n\nupon a careful consideration of the pleadings, the evidence placed on\n\nrecord, and the applicable legal principles as expounded in judicial\n\nprecedents.\n\n20. ISSUE No. I: Whether the non-communication of adverse\nAnnual Confidential Reports (ACRs) vitiates the respondent's\ndecision to deny promotion to the petitioner.\n\nAt the very core of the petitioner's grievance lies the allegation that\n\nher promotion was denied on the basis of adverse entries in her\n\n9|Page WP(C)323/2023\n\nAnnual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the years 2019-2020 and\n\n2021, which were admittedly never communicated to her. This Court\n\nconsiders it essential to first address this issue, as it strikes at the\n\nfoundation of fairness, transparency, and adherence to the principles\n\nof natural justice in service jurisprudence. We find it imperative to\n\nfirst address the issue of non-communication of adverse ACRs, as it\n\nstrikes at the heart of fairness and natural justice in public service\n\nlaw.\n\n21. Before deciding the above issue, we deem it proper to refer to the\n\njudgment rendered by The Apex Court in,\nDev Dutt v. Union of\n\nIndia\n, (2008) 8 SCC 725, the Hon'ble Supreme Court unequivocally\n\nheld that:\n\n\"17. In our opinion, every entry in the ACR of a public servant\nmust be communicated to him within a reasonable period,\nwhether it is a poor, fair, average, good or very good entry. This\nis because non-communication of such an entry may adversely\naffect the employee in two ways: (1) had the entry been\ncommunicated to him he would know about the assessment of his\nwork and conduct by his superiors, which would enable him to\nimprove his work in future: (2) he would have an opportunity of\nmaking a representation against the entry if he feels it is\nunjustified, and pray for its upgradation. Hence, non-\ncommunication of an entry is arbitrary, and it has been held by\nthe Constitution Bench decision of this Court in\nManeka Gandhi\nv. Union of India\n? that arbitrariness violates\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution.\"\n\n22. The Court reasoned that the right of an employee to be informed of\n\nany adverse material recorded in their service dossier is a\n\nfundamental facet of fairness, accountability, and transparency in\n\nservice jurisprudence. This right assumes greater significance where\n\nsuch adverse material is proposed to be relied upon to deny\n\npromotional benefits or career advancement. The principles of audi\n10 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nalteram partem, which mandate that no individual shall be\n\ncondemned unheard, apply with full force to service matters where\n\nadverse entries in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) have a direct\n\nbearing on the employee's rights and legitimate expectations. Denial\n\nof such an opportunity not only violates natural justice but also\n\nrenders any decision based on uncommunicated material, legally\n\nunsustainable.\n\n23. The law\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in\nDev Dutt v. Union of India\n,\n\n(2008) has been reiterated in\nSukhdev Singh vs. Union Of India and\n\nothers\n, 2013 (9) SCC 566 as under:\n\n\"5. In paras 37 and 41 of the Report this Court then observed as\nfollows: (Dev Dutt case-, SCC pp. 737-38)\n\"37. We further hold that when the entry is communicated to\nhim the public servant should have a right to make a\nrepresentation against the entry to the authority concerned, and\nthe authority concerned must decide the representation in a fair\nmanner and within a reasonable period. We also hold that the\nrepresentation must be decided by an authority higher than the\none who gave the entry, otherwise the likelihood is that the\nrepresentation will be summarily rejected without adequate\nconsideration as it would be an appeal from Caesar to Caesar.\nAll this would be conducive to fairness and transparency in\npublic administration, and would result in fairness to public\nservants. The State must be a model employer, and must act\nfairly towards its employees. Only then would good governance\nbe possible\n\n41. In our opinion, non-communication of entries in the\nannual confidential report of a public servant, whether he is in\ncivil, judicial, police or any other service (other than the\nmilitary), certainly has civil consequences because it may affect\nhis chances for promotion or get other benefits (as already\ndiscussed above). Hence, such non-communication would be\narbitrary, and as such violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\"\n\n24. It is a well-established principle in service jurisprudence that any\n\nadverse entry in the Annual Confidential Report (ACR) must be\n\ncommunicated to the concerned employee in a timely manner,\n11 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nparticularly when such entry is likely to affect the employee's service\n\nprospects, including promotion.\n\n25. Keeping in view the above, we find that lowering down of ACRs\n\nfrom \"very good\" to \"below average\" would require the respondents\n\nto give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner after conveying the\n\nsaid remarks.\n\n26. In the present case, the respondents have admitted that the adverse\n\nAnnual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the years 2019-2020 and\n\n2021 were not communicated to the petitioner, thereby depriving her\n\nof the opportunity to make a representation or seek their review in\n\naccordance with law. The consideration of such uncommunicated\n\nentries while denying her promotion is in violation of the principles\n\nof natural justice, particularly the rule of audi alteram partem, and is\n\nmanifestly arbitrary, thus offending\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. As\n\nlaid down in\n\nDev Dutt v. Union of India\nand consistently reiterated\n\nin subsequent judgments, the reliance on uncommunicated adverse\n\nremarks in ACRs vitiates the entire promotion process, rendering the\n\nconsequential decision invalid and unsustainable in law. The\n\nrespondents' failure to adhere to the mandatory requirement of\n\ncommunication has, therefore, not only infringed the petitioner's\n\nstatutory and constitutional rights but has also tainted the selection\n\nprocess with illegality.\n\n27. Therefore, we hold that the non-communication of the relevant ACRs\n\nis the most fundamental flaw and strikes at the very root of the\n\ndecision-making process adopted by the respondents. It constitutes a\n12 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\ngrave violation of the principles of natural justice and renders the\n\nentire exercise manifestly arbitrary and procedurally unfair. Such a\n\nfundamental defect cannot be cured or overlooked and decision taken\n\nby the respondents by virtue of orders impugned, cannot sustain the\n\ntest of law and is liable to be rejected.\n\nIssue no. I, is decided accordingly.\n\n28. ISSUE No.II: Whether Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,\noriginally applicable to gazetted staff, could have been extended\nand applied to non-gazetted staff without proper notification\nhighlighting the revised benchmark for promotion?\n\n29. Upon a careful examination of the material on record and in light of\n\nthe settled legal principles, this Court is of the considered view that\n\nExecutive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020, which prescribed a revised\n\nbenchmark of 65% aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports\n\n(ACRs) for promotion, was originally intended to apply to gazetted\n\nstaff only, and its subsequent extension to non-gazetted staff without\n\nany formal notification or publication, amounts to a procedural\n\nillegality.\n\n30. The records reveal that there was no contemporaneous notification,\n\noffice memorandum, or circular issued by the Registrar General or\n\nthe Administrative Department that expressly made the said executive\n\norder applicable to non-gazetted employees. No attempt was made to\n\nnotify or circulate the revised benchmark among non-gazetted\n\nemployees, nor was any opportunity afforded to them to acquaint\n13 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nthemselves with or prepare for the application of such an elevated\n\nstandard.\n\n31. In the absence of any such formal notification, the affected category\n\nof non-gazetted staff had no reasonable means of knowing that the\n\neligibility criteria for promotion had been altered. The fundamental\n\nprinciples of natural justice demand that rules or standards that\n\nimpose new obligations or alter existing service conditions, must be\n\nduly published and communicated to those affected.\n\n32. With a view to fortify this principle, we deem it proper to refer to the\n\njudgement passed by the Apex Court in\nHarla v. State of Rajasthan\n,\n\nAIR 1951 SC 467, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nauthoritatively held:\n\n9. Natural justice requires that before a law can become\noperative it must be promulgated or published. It must be\nbroadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know\nwhat it is; or, at the very least, there must be some special rule or\nregulation or customary channel by or through which such\nknowledge can be acquired with the exercise of due and\nreasonable diligence. The thought that a decision reached in the\nsecret recesses of a chamber to which the public have no access\nand to which even their accredited representatives have no access\nand of which they can normally know nothing, can nevertheless\naffect their lives, liberty and property by the mere passing of a\nresolution without anything more is abhorrent to civilised man. It\nshocks his conscience. In the absence therefore of any law, rule,\nregulation or custom, we hold that a law cannot come into being\nin this way. Promulgation or publication of some reasonable sort\nis essential.\n\n33. This principle flows from the broader doctrine of audi alteram\n\npartem and the right to natural justice, as individuals cannot be\n\nexpected to comply with unknown norms or be penalised for their\n\nbreach.\n\n34. Similarly, in\nB.K. Srinivasan v. State of Karnataka\n, (1987) 1 SCC\n\n658, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated:\n\n14 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\n15. There can be no doubt about the proposition that where a\nlaw, whether parliamentary or subordinate, demands\ncompliance, those that are governed must be notified directly and\nreliably of the law and all changes and additions made to it by\nvarious processes. Whether law is viewed from the standpoint of\nthe \"conscientious good man\" seeking to abide by the law or\nfrom the standpoint of justice Holmes's \"unconscientious bad\nman\" seeking to avoid the law, law must be known, that is to say,\nit must be so made that it can be known. We know that delegated\nor subordinate legislation is all-pervasive and that there is hardly\nany field of activity where governance by delegated or\nsubordinate legislative powers is not as important if not more\nimportant, than governance by parliamentary legislation. But\nunlike parliamentary legislation which is publicly made,\ndelegated or subordinate legislation is often made unobtrusively\nin the chambers of a Minister, a Secretary to the Government or\nother official dignitary. It is, therefore, necessary that\nsubordinate legislation, in order to take effect, must be published\nor promulgated in some suitable manner, whether such\npublication or promulgation is prescribed by the parent statute or\nnot. It will then take effect from the date of such publication or\npromulgation. Where the parent statute prescribes the mode of\npublication or promulgation that mode must be followed. Where\nthe parent statute is silent, but the subordinate legislation itself\nprescribes the manner of publication, such a mode of publication\nmay be sufficient, if reasonable. If the subordinate legislation\ndoes not prescribe the mode of publication or if the subordinate\nlegislation prescribes a plainly unreasonable mode of\npublication, it will take effect only when it is published through\nthe customarily recognised official channel, namely, the Official\nGazette or some other reasonable mode of publication. There\nmay be subordinate legislation which is concerned with a few\nindividuals or is confined to small local areas. In such cases\npublication or promulgation by other means may be sufficient.\n\nThe court further observed that administrative instructions, even if\n\nvalidly issued, must be publicised effectively if they alter existing\n\nrights or impose new burdens.\n\n35. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as\nR.Ranjith Singh & Ors\n\nv State Of Tamil Nadu & Ors.\nreported as 2025 SCC Online SC\n\n1009, has made it clear that:\n\n21. This Court in case of Jaiveer Singh v State of\nUtrakhand 2023INSC 1204 has held as under:\n\n34. It can thus be seen that it is a trite law that the\nGovernment cannot amend or supersede statutory\nrules by administrative instructions, but if the rules\nare silent on any particular point, it can fill up the\ngaps and supplement the rules and issue\n15 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\ninstructions not inconsistent with the rules already\nframed. It is a settled proposition of law that an\nauthority cannot issue orders/office memorandum/\nexecutive instructions in contravention of the\nstatutory rules. However, instructions can be issued\nonly to supplement the statutory rules but not to\nsupplant it. This Court has again held in the\naforesaid case that the Government cannot issue\nexecutive instructions in contravention of the\nstatutory rule.\n\nIn the present case, Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,\n\nwhich introduced a new benchmark for promotion eligibility, was\n\nneither traceable to any statutory rule nor duly notified or\n\ncommunicated to the affected employees. Its retrospective\n\napplication, therefore, not only offends the principle of administrative\n\nfairness and transparency but also violates the doctrine of legitimate\n\nexpectation. The attempt to apply the benchmark fixed under\n\nExecutive Order No. 415, originally confined to gazetted staff, to\n\nnon-gazetted employees without any formal notification or\n\npublication is wholly arbitrary and violates the doctrine of legitimate\n\nexpectation and administrative fairness.\n\n36. Moreover, nothing has been placed on record to show that the\n\nRegistrar General, after obtaining approval from the Hon'ble Chief\n\nJustice as the competent authority, ever took steps to formally notify\n\nthis change or to make it applicable to the cadre of non-gazetted\n\nemployees. This constitutes a serious administrative omission,\n\nparticularly when the order was used to deny promotion to the\n\npetitioner.\n\n16 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\n37. In light of the above, this Court holds that Executive Order No. 415\n\ncould not have been extended to non-gazetted employees without\n\nformal notification and communication, especially when it introduced\n\na substantive change in promotion criteria. The failure to notify the\n\nsame has resulted in denial of due opportunity to the petitioner,\n\nrendering the action arbitrary and violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India.\n\n38. ISSUE NO. III: Whether Executive Order No. 415 operates\nretrospectively so as to govern the consideration of promotions\npertaining to a period prior to its issuance.\n\nIt is now trite in law that executive orders or administrative\n\ninstructions altering service conditions cannot operate retrospectively\n\nunless the language of the order expressly provides for such an effect.\n\nRetrospective application is generally frowned upon\n\nas it offends the principles of fairness and violates vested rights.\n\n39. This principle was reiterated in\nState of Punjab v. Bhajan Kaur\n,\n\n(2008) 12 SCC 112, where the Apex Court observed:\n\n\"9. A statute is presumed to be prospective unless held to be\nretrospective, either expressly or by necessary implication. A\nsubstantive law is presumed to be prospective. It is one of the\nfacets of the rule of law.\"\n\n40. Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled\nMadishetti Bala\n\nRamul v. Land Acquisition Officer\nreported in (2007) 9 SCC 650\n\nhas held as under:\n\n19.\nIn\nLand Acquisition Officer-cum-SWO v. B.V. Reddy and\nSons\nthis Court opined that Section 25 being not a\nprocedural provision will have no retrospective effect, holding :\n\n(SCC p. 471, para 6)\n\"6. Coming to the second question, it is a well-settled principle of\nconstruction that a substantive provision cannot be retrospective\nin nature unless the provision itself indicates the same. The\namended provision of Section 25 nowhere indicates that the same\n17 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nwould have any retrospective effect. Consequently, therefore, it\nwould apply to all acquisitions made subsequent to 24-9-1984,\nthe date on which Act 68 of 1984 came into force. The Land\nAcquisition (Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in\nParliament on 30-4-1982 and came into operation with effect\nfrom 24-9-1984.\n\n41. In the present case, Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 introduced a\n\nnew criterion of securing 65% aggregate marks in Annual\n\nConfidential Reports (ACRs) as a precondition for promotion. The\n\npetitioner's case for promotion was under consideration for the period\n\n2017-2021, a substantial portion of which precedes the issuance of\n\nthe impugned order.\n\n42. The application of the newly introduced ACR criterion of securing\n\n65% aggregate marks to the period in question effectively alter the\n\nservice conditions of the petitioner in a retrospective manner. Such\n\napplication prejudices her vested right to be considered for promotion\n\nunder the previously existing criteria, which did not prescribe any\n\nminimum aggregate threshold for ACRs.\n\n43. In the present case, the application of Order No. 415 introduces a new\n\nobligation requiring employees to secure a minimum of 65%\n\naggregate marks in their Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for\n\neligibility to promotion. This requirement is sought to be enforced in\n\nrespect of past years for which the petitioner's ACRs had already\n\nbeen recorded without any prior knowledge of such a threshold.\n\nImposing this condition retrospectively, squarely falls within the\n\nmischief of retrospective operation and is legally impermissible.\n18 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\n44. The Honble Apex court in case titled as\nLand Acquisition Officer\n\nCum DSWO, A.P v. B.V. Reddy & Sons\n, reported in (2002) 3 SCC\n\n463 has consistently held that:\n\n\"6. Coming to the second question, it is a well-settled principle of\nconstruction that a substantive provision cannot be retrospective\nin nature unless the provision itself indicates the same. The\namended provision of Section 25 nowhere indicates that the same\nwould have any retrospective effect. Consequently, therefore, it\nwould apply to all acquisitions made subsequent to 24-9-1984,\nthe date on which Act 68 of 1984 came into force. The Land\nAcquisition (Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in\nParliament on 30-4-1982 and came into operation with effect\nfrom 24-9-1984. Under the amendment in question, the\nprovisions of Section 23(2) dealing with solatium were amended\nand Section 30(2) of the amended Act provided that the\nprovisions of subsection (2) of Section 23 of the principal Act as\namended by clause (b) of Section 15 shall apply and shall be\ndeemed to have applied, also to and in relation to any award\nmade by the Collector or court or to any order passed by the High\nCourt or the Supreme Court in appeal against any such award\nunder the provisions of the principal Act, after 30-4-1982 and\nbefore the commencement of the Act. It is because of the\naforesaid provision, the question cropped up as to whether in\nrespect of an award passed by the Collector between the two\ndates, the amended provision will have an application or not and\nthat question has been answered by this Court in the Constitution\nBench decision in\nUnion of India v. Raghubir Singh\n. Sub-section\n(2) of Section 30 has at all no reference to the provisions of\nSection 25 of the Act. In that view of the matter, question of\napplicability of the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act to\nan award of the Collector made earlier to the amendment and the\nmatter was pending in appeal, does not arise. In our considered\nopinion, the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act, not\nbeing retrospective in nature, the case in hand would be\ngoverned by the unamended provisions of Section 25 of the Act.\"\n\n19 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\n45. We are firmly of the view that the retrospective application of\n\nExecutive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 to promotion processes\n\ncovering the period from 2017 to 2021 is neither justified nor legally\n\nsustainable. The said order introduced a new eligibility condition\n\nrequiring 65% aggregate marks in the ACRs which was neither\n\nnotified nor communicated to the employees concerned at the\n\nrelevant time. As such, the petitioner and similarly placed employees\n\nwere deprived of an fair opportunity to comply with or address this\n\nnew requirement. Imposing such a standard retrospectively not only\n\nunsettles vested rights but also causes serious prejudice and\n\nadministrative uncertainty. Revisiting settled promotions after several\n\nyears disturbs the finality of service matters, generates avoidable\n\nlitigation, and undermines institutional fairness. In our view,\n\nenforcing an unpublished and uncommunicated executive instruction\n\nwith retrospective effect is arbitrary, unreasonable, and impermissible\n\nboth in law and in equity.\n\n46. Accordingly, the respondents' attempt to apply the new standard\n\nintroduced under Executive Order No. 415 requiring a minimum of\n\n65% aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) to the\n\npetitioner's case is legally unsustainable. Such retrospective\n\napplication of a criterion that was neither in existence nor\n\ncommunicated during the relevant assessment years directly offends\n\nthe well-settled principle of non- retrospectivity in service law. It also\n\nviolates the guarantee of fairness and equality enshrined under\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution, as administrative authorities are\n20 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nrequired to act in a just, transparent, and non-arbitrary manner.\n\nMoreover, this action undermines the doctrine of legitimate\n\nexpectation, which protects employees from arbitrary alterations of\n\nservice conditions and ensures that they are not prejudiced by\n\nchanges introduced without adequate prior notice or opportunity to\n\nadjust their conduct.\n\n47. Order No. 415, having been issued on 05.10.2020, cannot lawfully be\n\napplied to the petitioner's case retrospectively. Thus, we hold that, its\n\napplication to a period prior to its issuance is legally unsustainable,\n\narbitrary, and violative of the petitioner's rights.\n\nIssue no. III is decided, accordingly.\n\n48. ISSUE NO. IV: Whether the recording of the petitioner's Annual\nConfidential Report (ACR) for the year 2020 during the period of\nher sanctioned medical leave due to COVID-19, without due\ncommunication of the recorded remarks irrespective of whether\nthey were favourable, average, or adverse vitiates the procedural\nfairness required under service jurisprudence?\n\n49. An ACR is meant to be an objective assessment of an employee's\n\nperformance, conduct, and work output during a defined reporting\n\nperiod. When an employee is on sanctioned leave particularly for\n\nmedical reasons such as COVID-19, he or she is not actively\n\ndischarging duties and therefore cannot be evaluated on performance\n\nmetrics during that time. Recording adverse remarks under such\n\ncircumstances can be inherently unfair and arbitrary, as it is not based\n\non active service or observable conduct during the period in question.\n\nFurther, the principles of natural justice demand that any evaluation\n\nwhich may adversely affect an employee's rights such as eligibility\n21 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nfor promotion or career advancement must be transparent, fair, and\n\nobjectively grounded. An adverse ACR recorded while the employee\n\nwas legitimately absent from duty violates this principle, as the\n\nemployee has no opportunity to demonstrate performance or defend\n\nagainst subjective assessments.\n\n50. Moreover, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dev Dutt v.\n\nUnion of India [(2008) 8 SCC 725], even non-adverse or 'average'\n\nentries must be communicated if they can impact promotional\n\nprospects. It logically follows that adverse remarks recorded during a\n\nperiod of sanctioned leave, without any valid basis tied to actual\n\nperformance, must be communicated with reasons and an opportunity\n\nfor the employee to represent against them. Failing to do so renders\n\nsuch entries procedurally and substantively defective. In addition,\n\ndepartmental rules, executive instructions, and settled judicial\n\nprecedent all underscore that recording of ACRs must reflect actual\n\nwork and conduct not presumptions or administrative convenience.\n\n51. In light of the above, recording an adverse ACR during sanctioned\n\nleave especially without due communication cannot withstand legal\n\nscrutiny. It is not only administratively improper, but also vitiates the\n\nevaluation process, thereby compromising the employee's right to\n\nfair consideration in matters of promotion, postings, and other\n\nservice benefits.\n\n22 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\n52. It is the specific stand of the petitioner that she was on duly\n\nsanctioned medical leave for a substantial period in 2020 owing to\n\nCOVID-19 and related complications. Despite this, her performance\n\nfor that year was assessed as \"below average.\" Recording an adverse\n\nAnnual Confidential Report (ACR) during a period of sanctioned\n\nleave raises serious questions about the fairness, legality, and\n\npropriety of such an evaluation.\n\n53. The law is clear that no adverse remark can be made in an ACR\n\nunless it is based on concrete material reflecting actual work or\n\nmisconduct during the reporting period.\n\n54. In the present case, there is no material on record to show that the\n\npetitioner was either engaged in any work or guilty of any misconduct\n\nduring her sanctioned leave. Rather, the respondents appear to have\n\nmechanically recorded a \"below average\" rating without assessing\n\nwhether she had an opportunity to demonstrate her performance. Such\n\naction fails the test of fairness, non-arbitrariness, and application of\n\nmind, which are cornerstones of service jurisprudence.\n\n55. This Court also takes judicial notice of the fact that the COVID-19\n\npandemic constituted an extraordinary public health emergency,\n\nwherein employees across the spectrum were affected physically and\n\npsychologically. Many were absent from work not by choice, but due\n\nto circumstances beyond their control. To penalise an employee for\n\nabsence during such a period, particularly when the leave was duly\n23 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nsanctioned, is not only legally untenable but also violates the\n\nprinciples of equity and humane administration.\n\n56. In light of the above, recording an adverse ACR during sanctioned\n\nleave especially without due communication cannot withstand legal\n\nscrutiny. It is not only administratively improper, but also vitiates the\n\nevaluation process, thereby compromising the employee's right to\n\nfair consideration in matters of promotion, postings, and other service\n\nbenefits.\n\n57. Therefore, we hold that recording a \"below average\" ACR for the\n\npetitioner during her period of sanctioned medical leave for COVID-\n\n19, is patently unjustified, arbitrary, and legally unsustainable. The\n\nsaid adverse entry is liable to be set aside, and any reliance on it for\n\ndenying her promotion, is illegal and vitiates the entire process of\n\nconsideration.\n\nIssue no. IV, is decided accordingly.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n58. In light of the foregoing analysis, we find that the denial of\n\npromotion to the petitioner on the basis of uncommunicated adverse\n\nAnnual Confidential Reports (ACRs), amounts to a gross violation of\n\nthe principles of natural justice. It is a settled position in law that any\n\nmaterial adverse to the interest of an employee, if relied upon to deny\n\npromotion or other career advancement must be duly communicated\n\nso as to enable the employee to make an effective representation. The\n\nfailure of the respondents to communicate such ACRs deprived the\n24 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\npetitioner of this vital procedural safeguard and renders the entire\n\nprocess unsustainable in law.\n\n59. Further, we hold that Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,\n\nwhich imposes conditions materially affecting the service rights and\n\nlegitimate expectations of employees, required proper publication,\n\neither in the Official Gazette or through another effective mode of\n\ncommunication. In the absence of such publication or\n\ncommunication, the said order cannot be enforced against the\n\npetitioner. Administrative instructions that remain un-notified, cannot\n\nbe used to alter the service conditions of employees to their\n\ndetriment.\n\n60. The retrospective application of Executive Order No. 415, dated\n\n05.10.2020, to govern promotions for a period predating its issuance,\n\nis wholly untenable in law. It is a settled principle in service\n\njurisprudence that administrative orders or executive instructions\n\naltering service conditions cannot operate retrospectively unless there\n\nis clear and express statutory sanction authorising such retrospective\n\neffect. In the present case, the respondents have sought to apply the\n\nnewly introduced criterion of securing a minimum of 65% aggregate\n\nmarks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) to the petitioner's\n\npromotion assessment for the period 2017-2021. This approach is\n\nlegally impermissible, as it imposes an additional eligibility condition\n\nfor a period during which the petitioner had no notice or opportunity\n\nto meet such a requirement. The respondents' reliance on this\n\nuncommunicated and un-notified order to retrospectively deny the\n25 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\npetitioner her due consideration for promotion, not only contravenes\n\nthe principles of fairness and non-arbitrariness under\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution but also prejudices her vested right to be assessed under\n\nthe criteria that was in force during the relevant time.\n\n61. Further, the stand taken by the respondents that the criteria prescribed\n\nunder executive order no.415 are intended to apply to non-gazetted\n\nstaff, does not absolve them of their obligation to ensure wide\n\npublicity and due notification of the said order. The respondents were\n\nduty bound to notify all employees, including those to whom the\n\nrules would apply, so that they could be made aware of the\n\napplicability of the benchmark criteria. Mere internal application or\n\nselective enforcement cannot suffice to meet the requirement of\n\ntransparency and procedural fairness.\n\n62. If the intention was to extend the applicability of the 65%\n\nbenchmark, which was originally framed for gazetted officers, to\n\nnon-gazetted staff as well, then the respondents ought to have either\n\namended the relevant rules or issued a formal corrigendum clarifying\n\nthe same. Only upon such due notification could employees be\n\nexpected to make a conscious and informed effort to achieve the\n\nprescribed benchmark. Failure to do so renders the application of the\n\ncriteria arbitrary and unsustainable in law.\n\n63. In the absence of any published notification or formal communication\n\nextending the applicability of the benchmark to non-gazetted\n\nemployees, it is unreasonable to expect them to anticipate such\n\nstandards or orient their performance accordingly. The retrospective\n26 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\napplication of the rule that was neither made known nor duly\n\nenforced is plainly contrary to law. It violates the principle of legal\n\ncertainty, non-arbitrariness and\narticle 14\nof the constitution.\n\n64. We are of the considered view that the respondents were legally\n\nbound to give vide publicity to the order if they intended to apply it to\n\nthe non-gazetted employees. They cannot rely on internal decisions\n\nor informal practices when the consequences affect the service rights\n\nof individuals. Without proper publication, affected employees cannot\n\nbe expected to follow or comply with such criteria.\n\n65. Critically, the recording of an adverse ACR for the year 2020 when\n\nthe petitioner was on sanctioned medical leave due to COVID-19\n\npandemic, is patently arbitrary and unsupported by any material.\n\nPenalising an employee for a period of illness beyond her control,\n\nparticularly during a global pandemic, violates not only established\n\nlegal principles but also the broader tenets of fairness and equity in\n\npublic employment.\n\n66. Judicial precedents lend unequivocal support to the petitioner's case.\n\nCourts have consistently held that uncommunicated adverse entries\n\nand unpublished administrative instructions cannot form the basis for\n\nadverse decisions affecting employees' service rights. The\n\npetitioner's claim for promotion with retrospective effect from the\n\ndate on which her juniors were promoted is, therefore, well founded\n\nand deserves to be upheld.\n\n67. In weighing the equities of the case, we are persuaded that the\n\npetitioner has suffered substantial prejudice due to administrative\n27 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nlapses, entirely beyond her control. Granting the relief sought would\n\nnot only vindicate her individual rights but also affirm constitutional\n\nvalues of fairness, equality, and accountability in public service. It\n\nwould serve as a necessary reminder to the executive of the\n\nimportance of maintaining transparent and just administrative\n\npractices.\n\n68. Before parting, we direct the Registrar General of the High Court of\n\nJ&K and Ladakh that if executive order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 is\n\nto be applied to the non-gazetted staff of the High Court, it shall be\n\nduly communicated, notified, and published through appropriate\n\nmode to ensure that all affected employees are given proper notice of\n\nits contents and implications and issue a formal notification applying\n\nexecutive order No. 415 to non-gazetted employees only after\n\nobtaining approval from Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court.\n\nThe notification shall specifically mention the benchmark criteria and\n\nits effective date.\n\n69. Any attempt to enforce the said order without adherence to these\n\nprocedural safeguards, shall render its application vulnerable to legal\n\nchallenge.\n\n70. In view of the above findings, the writ petition is allowed and\n\ndisposed of in the following manner :\n\ni) Quashing the impugned order Annexure-ll rejecting\n\nthe petitioner's representation without assigning\n\nany cogent reasons for such rejection.\n\n28 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023\n\nii) Quashing the impugned entry of \"below average\" in\n\nthe annual confidential report of the petitioner for\n\nthe year 2020.\n\n71. We further hold that the impugned action denying the petitioner's\n\npromotion cannot be sustained in law. Accordingly, the respondents\n\nare directed to accord consideration to the claim of petitioner for\n\npromotion to the post of Head Assistant with retrospective effect\n\nfrom the date her juniors were promoted i.e. 24.11.2022 as Head\n\nAssistant, and to grant her all consequential benefits of seniority and\n\nmonetary in accordance with law without taking into consideration\n\nthe adverse ACR of the year 2020.\n\n72.
