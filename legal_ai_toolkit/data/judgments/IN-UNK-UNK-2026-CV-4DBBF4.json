CONCLUSION ........................................................................................... 81\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 2 of 84\n\n\f1. Two judicial officers of the rank of Civil Judge (Senior Division) governed\n\nby the Gujarat State Judicial Service Rules, 2005 (for short, the “2005 Rules”)\n\nhave invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution.\n\nTheir grievance against the High Court of Gujarat is that it erroneously applied\n\nthe principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ in the recruitment undertaken by it in the\n\nyear 2022 for promotion of Civil Judges (Senior Division) to the post of\n\nAdditional District Judge against 65% quota, though Rule 5(1) of the 2005 Rules\n\nstipulates that the promotion shall be based on the principle of ‘Merit-cum-\n\nSeniority’. In other words, it is contended that the High Court wrongly subjected\n\nall eligible candidates in the feeder cadre i.e., Civil Judge (Senior Division) to a\n\nprocess of assessment of a specified level of minimum merit and then proceeded\n\nto prepare the final Select List strictly in accordance with the seniority of the\n\ncandidates. This according to the petitioners is nothing but ‘Seniority-cum-\n\nMerit’.\n\nA. FACTUAL MATRIX\n\n2. The High Court of Gujarat issued an advertisement/recruitment notice\n\ndated 12.04.2022 notifying a total of 68 vacancies in the cadre of District Judges\n\nfor promotion of Civil Judges (Senior Division) against the 65% quota on the\n\nbasis of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and passing a Suitability Test as envisaged under\n\nRule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules.

Assessment of Average Disposal of last five 20\n years of the Judicial Officer concerned.\n\n 4. Evaluation of Judgments delivered by the 60\n Judicial Officer concerned during the\n period of last one year. *\n\n * Due to unprecedented time of COVID-19 pandemic in\n Year 2020 & 2021, the Subordinate Courts in the state\n were not functioning regularly. Hence, this time round,\n the Hon’ble Committee has decided for the instant\n Promotion Process to call upon the requisite Four\n Judgments rendered by the Officer concerned during the\n period between 01/01/2020 to 31/12/2021. However, this\n should not be treated as a precedent in upcoming\n Promotion Process.\n\n 3. Written Test (Objective Type - MCQs) :\n\n (i) The Written Test (Objective Type - MCQs) shall consist of 01\n (One) Paper of 100 Marks of duration of 02 Hours consisting\n of Objective Type Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) each of\n 01 Mark. There will be no Negative marking system. The\n subject would be as under:\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 5 of 84\n\n\f Sr. Subject Marks\n No\n\n 1.

Nonetheless mere passing of Written Test\n (Objective Type - MCQs) by the Judicial Officers would not give\n him/her right of having secured the position in the Select List.\n It will be subject to passing of other 03 (Three) components as\n well.\n\n (v) ACR, Disposal and Judgments of only those Judicial Officers\n who will secure minimum 40% Marks in Written Test (Objective\n Type - MCQs), will be called for after the declaration of the\n result of Written Test (Objective Type - MCQs).\n\n 4.

The High Court along with the aforesaid advertisement/recruitment notice,\n\nalso issued a list of 205 judicial officers in the cadre of Civil Judge (Senior\n\nDivision) i.e., the feeder cadre, falling under the ‘Zone of Consideration’ for the\n\naforesaid purpose of filling up the vacancies in the cadre of District Judges as\n\nagainst 65% quota.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 8 of 84\n\n\f4. The High Court prepared the list of 205 candidates falling within the zone\n\nof consideration by including the senior-most Civil Judges (Senior Division) not\n\nexceeding three-times the notified vacancies. In other words, the zone of\n\nconsideration only included the 205 senior-most Civil Judges (Senior Division).\n\n5. As per the advertisement/recruitment notice dated 12.04.2022, the\n\nsuitability of the aforesaid 205 candidates falling within the zone of\n\nconsideration, for the purpose of promotion, was to be assessed on the basis of\n\nfour components which are being reproduced hereunder: -\n\n Sr. No. Components of Suitability Test Marks\n\n 1. Written Test (Objective Type – MCQs) 100\n\n 2. Examination and Evaluation of Annual 20\n\n Confidential Reports for last five years.\n\n 3. Assessment of Average Disposal of last five years 20\n of the Judicial Officer concerned.\n\n 4. Evaluation of Judgments delivered by the Judicial 60\n Officer concerned during the period of last one\n year.\n\n6. The aforesaid advertisement/recruitment notice dated 12.04.2022 further\n\nstipulated that all those judicial officers who obtain a minimum 40% marks in\n\neach of the abovementioned component and a minimum aggregate of 50% marks\n\nin all four components shall be eligible for being included in the Select List for\n\npromotion.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 9 of 84\n\n\f7. Pursuant to the aforesaid, the Written Test (Objective Type – MCQs) was\n\nconducted by the High Court and out of 205 candidates, a total of 175 judicial\n\nofficers cleared the written test i.e., all those who were able to secure a minimum\n\nof 40% marks. Thereafter, the High Court called for the month-wise list of the\n\njudgments disposed of and the annual confidential reports (ACRs) of all 175\n\ncandidates who qualified.\n\n8. After the evaluation of the ACRs, judgments and disposal rates, a total of\n\n149 judicial officers were found to be eligible for promotion as they had secured\n\na minimum 40% marks in each of the abovementioned component and a\n\nminimum aggregate of 50% marks in all the four components of the suitability\n\ntest.\n\n9. The High Court thereafter proceeded to prepare the final Select List dated\n\n10.03.2023 wherein the seniormost 68 candidates amongst the aforementioned\n\n149 eligible candidates were given promotion to the post of District Judge.\n\n10. In such circumstances \nreferred to above\n, the petitioners are here before this\n\nCourt with the present petition under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution.\n\ni. Method of Promotion followed by the High Court of Gujarat.\n\n11. For the better adjudication of the issues involved in the case at hand, it\n\nwould be necessary to delineate the step-wise process of promotion undertaken\n\nby the High Court of Gujarat for the purpose of preparing the final Select List.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 10 of 84\n\n\f12. The process, as explained by the High Court in its counter affidavit and\n\nadditional affidavit is as under: -\n\n 1. Total number of Civil Judges (Senior Division) in\n\n 444\n\n Gujarat.\n\n 2. Civil Judges (Senior Division) who fulfilled the\n\n eligibility criteria of a minimum of two-years of 417\n\n qualifying service.\n\n 3. Senior-most of the Civil Judges (Senior Division)\n\n 205\n\n falling under the zone of consideration as per 1:3\n\n ratio.\n\n 4. Civil Judges (Senior Division) who appeared for the\n\n Suitability Test (MCQ’s with no negative marking). 198\n\n (Seven candidates chose not to appear for the\n\n suitability test)\n\n 5. Civil Judges (Senior Division) who secured 40%\n\n marks in the Suitability Test (MCQs with no 175\n\n negative marking).\n\n 6. Total number of Civil Judges (Senior Division) who\n\n secured total of 50% marks and a minimum 40% 149\n\n marks in all four components being the Written Test,\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 11 of 84\n\n\f evaluation of ACRs, assessment of average disposal\n\n and evaluation of Judgments.\n\n 7. Select List as per the notified vacancy prepared on\n\n 68\n\n the basis of seniority.\n\nB. REFERENCE ORDER\n\n13. The present writ petition was earlier heard by a two-Judge Bench of this\n\nCourt wherein it was prima facie observed that in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n\n(3) v. Union of India & Ors.\n reported in (2002) 4 SCC 247 while emphasizing\n\non the need for merit-based criteria for promotion in the cadre of Higher Judicial\n\nService, this Court had held that the promotion to the post of District Judge shall\n\nbe on the basis of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’.\n\n14. This Court further observed that the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’\n\nlays greater emphasis on merit, and seniority plays a less significant role.\n\nTherefore, seniority should be considered only when merit and ability are equal.\n\n15. This Court prima facie opined that the final Select List dated 10.03.2023\n\ncould be said to be in contravention of the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ as\n\nenvisaged in the rules and the decision in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3)\n\n(supra).\n \nHowever, in view of the importance of the matter and the observations\n\nmade in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra), the matter was referred to the\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 12 of 84\n\n\fBench of Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India. The relevant observations read as\n\nunder: -\n\n \n“8.1 It is also required to be noted that even as per the Recruitment\n Notice – District Judge (65%), the promotion to the cadre of District\n Judge (65%) from amongst the Senior Civil Judges shall be on the\n basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority and passing a suitability\n test. The suitability of a judicial officer for promotion is also provided\n in the Recruitment Notice, which consists of four components\n reproduced hereinabove. Thus, as per the statutory Rules and even\n as per the Recruitment Notice, the promotion to the cadre of District\n Judge (65%) shall be on the basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority\n and passing a suitability test. At this stage, it is required to be noted\n that the Rules, 2005 further amended in the year 2011, have been\n framed by the High Court pursuant to the directions issued by this\n Court in the case of \nAll India Judges’ Association and Ors.\n (supra).\n\nIt is required to be noted that prior to the decision of this Court in the\n case of \nAll India Judges’ Association and Ors.\n (supra), the promotion\n in the cadre of Higher Judicial Service, i.e., District Judges and\n Additional District Judges were given on the basis of principle of\n seniority-cum-merit. Emphasising the need for merit-based criteria\n for promotion in the cadre of Higher Judicial Service, i.e., District\n Judges and Additional District Judges [...]\n xxx xxx xxx\n 8.8 The law on the principle of “merit-cum-seniority is by now, settled\n by this Court in a catena of decisions. As observed, while applying\n the principle of “merit-cum-seniority”, greater emphasis is given on\n merit and ability and seniority plays a less significant role. As\n observed, while applying the principle of “merit-cum-seniority”, the\n seniority is to be given weight only when merit and ability are\n approximately equal.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n \n9. Thus, we are more than satisfied that the impugned Select List\n dated 10.03.2023 issued by the High Court and the subsequent\n Notification dated 18.04.2023 issued by the State Government\n granting promotion to the cadre of District Judge are illegal and\n contrary to the relevant Rules and Regulations and even to the\n decision of this Court in the case of \nAll India Judges’ Association and\n Ors.\n (supra). Therefore, we are more than prima facie satisfied that\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 13 of 84\n\n\f the same as such are not sustainable. Though, we were inclined to\n dispose of the writ petition finally, however, as Shri Dushyant Dave,\n learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of some of the\n respondents - promotees has prayed not to dispose of the writ petition\n finally and, therefore, may consider the question of interim relief, we\n are not disposing of the writ petition finally. […]\n\n \n10. Looking to the importance of the matter and the observations\n made by this Court in the case of \nAll India Judges’ Association and\n Ors.\n (supra), pursuant to which the High Court has amended the\n Rules and the Regulations, we are of the opinion that let the matter\n be heard by the Bench headed by Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India,\n however, subject to and after obtaining appropriate orders from the\n Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India on the administrative side. The\n Registry is directed to notify the present writ petition for final hearing\n on 08.08.2023.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n16. Accordingly, the present writ petition came to be referred to this Bench and\n\nwas accordingly taken up for hearing.\n\nC. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\n\n17. Mr. P.S. Patwalia, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners\n\nsubmitted that the statutory rules as well as the decision in \nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation\n (3) (supra) stipulate that promotion to the cadre of District Judges\n\nagainst the 65% quota has to be on the basis of the principle of ‘Merit-cum-\n\nSeniority’. Although the High Court has used the nomenclature ‘Merit-cum-\n\nSeniority’ yet the method ultimately followed for the purpose of promotion to the\n\ncadre of District Judge is nothing but ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 14 of 84\n\n\f18. He further submitted that the High Court in its methodology subjected all\n\neligible candidates in the feeder cadre to a process of assessment of a specified\n\nminimum necessary merit and then proceeded to promote the candidates found\n\npossessing the minimum requisite merit strictly in the order of seniority. He\n\nsubmitted that the said method is nothing but ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’.\n\n19. Finally, Mr. Patwalia submitted that where promotion is on the basis of\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’, seniority has to be considered only in the event merit is\n\nequal in all respects. In other words, seniority should be considered only if there\n\nis a tie between the candidates on their individual merit.\n\n20. Mr. R. Basant, learned Senior Counsel submitted that in the procedure that\n\ncame to be followed by the High Court for promotion, seniority has been applied\n\nand given effect twice - once at the stage of preparation of the zone of\n\nconsideration and then again at the stage of preparing the final Select List.\n\n21. He further submitted that by applying seniority at the last stage of preparing\n\nthe final Select List, the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ has been given a go-\n\nby and instead ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ has been applied.\n\n22. He also submitted that in cases of promotion on the principle of ‘Merit-\n\ncum-Seniority’, there is always an element of comparative merit and the\n\npromotion must be as per the inter-se merit of the persons who obtained the\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 15 of 84\n\n\fminimum marks. \nIn this regard, strong reliance has been placed on the decisions\n\nof this Court in \nRupa Rani Rakshit & Ors. v. Jharkhand Gramin Bank\n reported\n\nin (2010) 1 SCC 345 and in \nDr. Kavita Kamboj v. High\n Court of Punjab and\n\nHaryana & Ors. reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 254.\n\n23. He further submitted that ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ is not a vague literary\n\nterm, but carries a specific meaning in service jurisprudence. He submitted that\n\nthe decision in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra) consciously substituted\n\nthe earlier criteria of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ with ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’.\n\n24. In the last, Mr R. Basant submitted that this Court in a plethora of its\n\ndecisions has consistently held that where a minimum benchmark is laid down\n\nand candidates having secured the minimum required marks are promoted on the\n\nbasis of the seniority irrespective of the individual marks secured by them, it is\n\nan instance of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’.\n\nD. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE HIGH COURT\n\n25. Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the High Court of\n\nGujarat submitted that ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ should not be conflated with Merit\n\nand that there is a clear distinction between the two concepts. He submitted that\n\nwhilst merit is concerned only with the grade/credit of the candidate, the former\n\nnot only checks the merit but also lays emphasis on seniority.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 16 of 84\n\n\f26. He submitted that if the interpretation of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ as\n\ncanvassed by the petitioners is accepted, then the entire process of promotion\n\nwould become solely based on merit and the aspect of seniority would be\n\ncompletely obliterated from the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’.\n\n27. He further submitted that doing so would have a far-reaching effect. The\n\nsame would result in an amalgamation of the promotion process against 65%\n\nposts on the basis of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and the process against 10% posts on\n\nthe basis of strict merit in the cadre of District Judges and would completely do\n\naway with the fine distinction between the two modes of promotion.\n\n28. Finally, Mr. Giri submitted that the High Court has been following the\n\nsame methodology since 2011.\n\nE. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PROMOTED CANDIDATES\n\n29. Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Counsel appearing for judicial officers\n\nwho found place in the final Select List submitted that the writ petition under\n\nArticle 32\n ought not to be entertained as the petitioners have an alternative\n\nefficacious remedy of filing a writ petition under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n\nbefore the High Court.\n\n30. He submitted that in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra) the\n\nprinciple of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and Suitability Test was provided only to\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 17 of 84\n\n\fobjectively ascertain a minimum standard of merit for the purpose of promotion\n\nto the Higher Judicial Services in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge.\n\n31. Mr. Dave submitted that merely having scored a few marks more than the\n\nother candidates is neither an indication of being tangibly more meritorious nor a\n\ncogent reason to completely negate the length of service of the senior candidates.\n\nHe submitted that if the interpretation as canvassed by the petitioners is accepted,\n\nit would cause undue hardship and result in unjust treatment to his clients whose\n\nnames were included in the final Select List, as they would end up losing their\n\nprecious years of seniority in service only on account of having obtained a few\n\nmarks lesser compared to the petitioners.\n\n32. Ms. Mayuri Raghuvanshi, learned Counsel appearing for some of the\n\nrespondents submitted that the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ does not mean\n\nthat the length of service or seniority has no relevance. She submitted that the\n\nmarks secured in the written examination and other tests are not indicative of\n\nmerit as the marks may be obtained even without possessing other important\n\nqualities such as practical experience or by cramming.\n\n33. She further submitted that the various decisions on the principle of ‘Merit-\n\ncum-Seniority’ as relied upon by the petitioners do not deal with judicial services\n\nand have not been delivered in the context of promotion of Civil Judges (Senior\n\nDivision) to the cadre of District Judge. It was submitted that ‘Merit-cum-\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 18 of 84\n\n\fSeniority’, as stipulated in the 2005 Rules, should be read in line with the\n\nobservations in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n\n34. Learned counsel further submitted that the reliance placed by the\n\npetitioners on the process of promotion followed by the High Court of Jharkhand\n\nand High Court of Calcutta is absolutely misplaced, as the statutory rules therein\n\nare not pari-materia to the 2005 Rules.\n\n35. Finally, Ms. Raghuvanshi submitted that her clients whose names have\n\nbeen included in the final Select List, had also participated in the promotion\n\nprocess undertaken in the year 2020. Although her clients had scored higher\n\nmarks compared to the other candidates in the 2020 recruitment process, yet they\n\nwere not promoted as they were comparatively junior to the other officers. She\n\nsubmitted that the process which was followed by the High Court applying the\n\nprinciple of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ has been followed consistently since 2011.\n\nShe submitted that deviating from the process as followed by the High Court will\n\nresult in inequitable and unjust repercussions, as her clients who lost out on\n\npromotions in the previous recruitment process because of being relatively junior\n\nwould again end up losing out on their promotions in this process despite being\n\nrelatively senior.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 19 of 84\n\n\fF. POINTS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n36. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the parties and having\n\ngone through the materials on record, the two pivotal questions that fall for our\n\nconsideration are as under: -\n\nI. What is the scope of principle of the ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ in service\n\n jurisprudence; and\n\nII. Whether promotion of Civil Judges (Senior Division) to the cadre of\n\n District Judges in accordance with Rule 5(1) of the 2005 Rules and the\n\n Recruitment Notice dated 12.04.2022 issued by the High Court of Gujarat\n\n is contrary to the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ as \nlaid down in\n \nAll\n\n India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n\nG. ANALYSIS\n\ni. Maintainability of the present Writ Petition under \nArticle 32.\n\n37. At the outset, a preliminary objection was raised as regards the\n\nmaintainability of the writ petition under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution, on the\n\nground that the petitioners have an efficacious alternative remedy available to\n\nthem under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution.\n\n38. \nIn \nMohammed Ishaq v. S. Kazam Pasha & Anr.\n reported in (2009) 12\n\nSCC 748 this Court held that where \nArticle 32\n has been invoked, even where an\n\nalternative remedy exists, relegating the parties to avail the same is discretionary\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 20 of 84\n\n\fand a matter of convenience, and the same by no stretch restrains this Court to\n\nentertain the same. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “23. On the preliminary issue of maintainability of the present writ\n petition, it is well-settled position of law that simply because a remedy\n exists in the form of \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution for filing a writ in the\n High Court concerned, it does not prevent or place any bar on an\n aggrieved person to directly approach the Supreme Court under \nArticle 32\n\n of the Constitution. It is true that the Court has imposed a self-restraint in\n its own wisdom on the exercise of jurisdiction under \nArticle 32\n where the\n party invoking the jurisdiction has an effective, adequate alternative\n remedy in the form of \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution. However, this rule\n which requires the exhaustion of alternative remedies is a rule of\n convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law. At any rate it does\n not oust the jurisdiction of this Court to exercise its writ jurisdiction under\n \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution. We, therefore, reject the preliminary\n objection raised and proceed to examine the contentions raised in the writ\n petition on merits.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n39. \nIn \nMaharashtra State Judicial Service Assn. & Ors. v. High\n Court of\n\nJudicature at Bombay & Ors. reported in (2002) 3 SCC 244 this Court held that\n\nwhere the issue pertained only to the interpretation of the relevant rules and there\n\nwas no dispute as regards the facts of the case by either side, the same could be\n\nentertained under \nArticle 32\n even though the alternative remedy under \nArticle\n\n226\n was available. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “1. [...] On behalf of the direct recruit respondents, a preliminary\n objection had been taken by Shri M.L. Verma that the dispute being one of\n inter se seniority within a cadre, the Court ought not to entertain a petition\n under \nArticle 32\n, as the parties were entitled to approach the High Court\n under \nArticle 226\n against the administrative decision of the Bombay High\n Court. We have no doubt in our mind that an administrative decision of the\n Court could be assailed by filing a writ petition under \nArticle 226\n in the\n High Court itself, but this Court having entertained the petition under\n \nArticle 32\n by issuing rule on 8-12-2000 and the dispute being one which\n centres around interpretation of the relevant Rules and both the direct\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 21 of 84\n\n\f recruits and the promotees having made their stand known, and further,\n no disputed question on facts having arisen, we do not think it appropriate\n to direct the promotees to approach the High Court in the first instance.\n We, therefore, heard the parties at length on the merits of the matter.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n40. From the aforesaid, it is clear that the availability of an alternative remedy\n\ndoes not in any manner affect the maintainability of the writ petition under \nArticle\n\n32\n of the Constitution. The rule behind relegating a party to first avail the\n\nalternative remedy before knocking the doors of this Court is a rule of self-\n\nrestraint that is exercised by this Court as a matter of convenience.\n\n41. Further, wherever the facts of the case are not in dispute, and the issue\n\ninvolves the interpretation of rules which are of significant importance having a\n\nfar-reaching effect, it would be a fit case for this Court to exercise its discretion\n\nand entertain the writ petition under \nArticle 32\n even if there is an alternative\n\nremedy available.\n\n42. It is contended by the petitioners that they had to come before this Court\n\ninvoking \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution instead of \nArticle 226\n because the\n\nimpugned final Select List dated 10.03.2023 which is the subject matter of\n\nchallenge had been ratified by the High Court in its Full Court meeting. We are\n\nnot impressed with such a submission as the High Court on its judicial side can\n\nalways review any decision or action taken by it on its administrative side. It\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 22 of 84\n\n\fwould be erroneous to say that if any decision taken by the High Court on its\n\nadministrative side is ultimately challenged on any legal ground on its judicial\n\nside, then the High Court may not undertake judicial review of such\n\nadministrative decision dispassionately.\n\n43. In the present case, the facts are not in dispute either at the end of the\n\npetitioners herein or at the end of the High Court or the respondents. Moreover,\n\nsince the issues involve not just the interpretation of Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005\n\nRules but also the decision of this Court in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3)\n\n(supra), we are of the considered opinion that the petition under \nArticle 32\n\ndeserves to be entertained.\n\nii. The Legislative History and Scheme of the Gujarat State Judicial\n Service Rules, 2005.\n\na. Shetty Commission on Judicial Reforms and the Decision of this Court\n in All India Judges’ Association (3).\n\n44. The subject matter of the controversy with which we are concerned in the\n\npresent litigation is with regard to the scheme and policy for promotions in the\n\nHigher Judicial Services, particularly to the cadre of Additional District &\n\nSessions Judge. The genesis of the same can be traced back to the decision of this\n\nCourt in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 23 of 84\n\n\f45. The First Law Commission of India under the Chairmanship of Shri M.C.\n\nSetalvad in its 14th Report in the year 1958 expressed concerns over the growing\n\nproblem of finding capable and competent judicial officers for the District\n\nJudiciary. It reported that most of the difficulties brought to the notice of the\n\nCommission had their origin in the inefficiency or inexperience of the judicial\n\npersonnel on account of the falling standards in their recruitment. The relevant\n\nobservations read as under: -\n\n “2.Subordinate Judiciary\n Personnel\n\n 2. As has been said repeatedly elsewhere, the problem of efficient\n judicial administration, whether at the level of the superior courts or\n the subordinate courts, is largely the problem of finding capable and\n competent judges and judicial officers. Delays in the disposal of cases\n and the accumulation of arrears are in a great measure due to the\n inability of the judicial officers to arrange their work methodically\n and to appreciate and apply the provisions of the Procedural Codes.\n\n […]\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 4. As we shall point out later, the problem has since grown in\n dimensions, because there is unmistakable testimony that the\n standards of the judicial officers recruited from the bar and other\n sources have, during recent years, fallen in a substantial degree for\n various reasons. That has been almost the unanimous view expressed\n by the witnesses before us. It is thus obvious that no scheme of reform\n of judicial administration will be effective or worth-while, unless the\n basic problem of providing trained and capable judicial personnel is\n satisfactorily solved. Before we can suggest adequate measures for\n raising the level of judiciary, we have to examine the causes which\n have led to the decline in its efficiency.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n46. Accordingly, the Law Commission made a slew of recommendations in\n\norder to deal with the afore-stated problems. The Law Commission, inter-alia,\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 24 of 84\n\n\frecommended devising a more robust mechanism for recruitment and in-service\n\ntraining of judicial officers with a view to improve their calibre. It further\n\nrecommended that a third source of recruitment to the Higher Judiciary i.e., the\n\ncadre of District & Sessions Judge, should be created. It stated that this third\n\ncategory should be recruited purely by way of a competitive examination, and\n\nrecruitment through the existing two categories i.e., by promotion and from the\n\nBar should continue as per the existing process. The Law Commission was of the\n\nview that the new avenue as recommended would enlarge the field of selection\n\nand bring in Judicial Officers of high calibre and brilliance. The relevant\n\nobservations read as under: -\n\n “10. If we are to improve the personnel of the subordinate judiciary,\n we must first take measures to extend or widen our field of selection\n so that we can draw from it really capable persons. A radical measure\n suggested to us was to recruit the judicial service entirely by a\n competitive test or examination. It was suggested that the higher\n judiciary could be drawn from such competitive tests at the all-India\n level and the lower judiciary can be recruited by similar tests held at\n State level. Those eligible for these tests would be graduates who\n have taken a law degree and the requirement of practice at there Bar\n should be done away with.\n\n Such a scheme, it was urged, would result in bringing into the\n subordinate judiciary capable young men who now prefer to obtain\n immediate remunerative employment in the executive branch of\n Government and in private commercial firms. The scheme, it was\n pointed out, would bring to the higher subordinate judiciary the best\n talent available in the country as a whole, whereas the lower\n subordinate judiciary would be drawn from the best talent available\n in the State.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 25 of 84\n\n\f47. \nIn \nAll India Judges’ Association (1) v. Union of India\n reported in (1992)\n\n1 SCC 119, the issues pertaining to the working conditions of the District\n\nJudiciary throughout the country came up for consideration, including the issues\n\npertaining to uniformity in the judicial cadres in different States and Union\n\nTerritories, and for adequate provisions for in-service training and promotion.\n\n48. This Court took notice of the aforesaid recommendations that were made\n\nby the First Law Commission of India in its Fourteenth Report in 1958,\n\nparticularly with respect to improving the standard of the District Judiciary and\n\nwidening the field of selection and promotion to the Higher Judiciary in a\n\nbalanced manner so as to induct capable and efficient persons as Judicial Officers\n\nin the District Judiciary.\n\n49. While this Court acknowledged that the creation of an All-India Judicial\n\nService as proposed by the Law Commission may undermine the control of the\n\nHigh Courts over the District Judiciary, yet at the same time this Court suggested\n\nto the Union of India to undertake appropriate steps towards the implementation\n\nof the recommendations made by the Law Commission, as far as feasible, at the\n\nearliest, and directed the Central Government to consider setting up an All-India\n\nJudicial Service. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “11. [...] We are of the view that the Law Commission's\n recommendation should not have been dropped lightly. There is\n considerable force and merit in the view expressed by the Law\n Commission. An All India Judicial Service essentially for manning\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 26 of 84\n\n\f the higher services in the subordinate judiciary is very much\n necessary. The reasons advanced by the Law Commission for\n recommending the setting up of an All India Judicial Service appeal\n to us.\n\n 12. Since the setting up of such a service might require amendment\n of the relevant articles of the Constitution and might even require\n alteration of the Service Rules operating in the different States and\n Union territories, we do not intend to give any particular direction\n on this score particularly when the point was not seriously pressed\n but we would commend to the Union of India to undertake\n appropriate exercise quickly so that the feasibility of implementation\n of the recommendations of the Law Commission may be examined\n expeditiously and implemented as early as possible. It is in the\n interest of the health of the judiciary throughout the country that this\n should be done.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 63. We would now briefly indicate the directions we have given in the\n judgment:\n\n (i) An All India Judicial Service should be set up and the Union of\n India should take appropriate steps in this regard. [...]”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n50. Thereafter, review petitions came to be filed against the decision in \nAll\n\nIndia Judges’ Association\n (1) (supra) seeking certain modifications and\n\nclarifications in respect of the directions that were issued by this Court.\n \nThe\n\nreview petitions came to be disposed in \nAll India Judges’ Association (2) v.\n\nUnion of India\n reported in (1993) 4 SCC 288, wherein inter-alia it was clarified\n\nthat although the direction for setting up an All-India Judicial Service was only\n\nrecommendatory, yet in view of the necessary and expedient nature of the\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 27 of 84\n\n\frecommendations made by the Law Commission, the Central Government should\n\ntake an earnest initiative in realizing the same.\n\n51. Pursuant to the directions issued by this Court in \nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation\n (1) (supra) and \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (2) (supra), the First\n\nNational Judicial Pay Commission under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Mr.\n\nJustice K.J. Shetty (Former Judge of this Court), more popularly known as the\n\n“Shetty Commission on Judicial Reforms” came to be constituted. After due\n\ndeliberations, the Shetty Commission submitted its report on 11.11.1999, and\n\nresponses to the same were filed by the States and Union Territories.\n\n52. The recommendations made in the Shetty Commission’s report along with\n\nthe responses of the States/Union Territories were taken into consideration and\n\nthe same ultimately culminated into the decision of this Court in \nAll India\n\nJudges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n\n(1) In \nthe said decision\n, this Court, inter-alia, accepted the recommendation of\n\n the Shetty Commission that 75% of the posts in the cadre of District &\n\n Sessions Judge shall be filled by promotion from Civil Judge (Senior\n\n Division) and 25% of the posts shall be filled by direct recruitment from\n\n the Bar by way of a competitive examination encompassing a written\n\n examination and viva.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 28 of 84\n\n\f(2) At the same time, this Court was of the view that when it comes to\n\n appointment by promotion to the cadre of District & Sessions Judge,\n\n (i) some incentive for improving must exist for the judicial officers and (ii)\n\n a certain minimum standard ought to be maintained in the cadre of District\n\n & Sessions Judge and further, there must be an objective method for testing\n\n the suitability of a Judicial Officer for promotion.\n\n(3) Accordingly, this Court held that even within the quota of 75% there should\n\n be two methods of appointment by way of promotion. It held that\n\n 50% of the total posts shall be filled by promotion based on the principle\n\n of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ through a test for assessing the continued\n\n efficiency and adequate knowledge of case-law of the Judicial Officers and\n\n the remaining 25% of the posts shall be filled by promotion strictly on the\n\n basis of merit through a limited departmental competitive examination\n\n (LDCC) with an eligibility requirement of five-years of qualifying service\n\n as a Civil Judge (Senior Division).\n\n(4) Thus, this Court directed that recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service\n\n i.e., in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge shall be through three\n\n different avenues, namely: -\n\n (i) 50% by promotion of Civil Judges (Senior Division) on the\n\n basis of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and passing a Suitability Test.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 29 of 84\n\n\f (ii) 25% by promotion strictly based on merit through a limited\n\n departmental competitive examination of Civil Judges (Senior\n\n Division) not having less than five-years qualifying service; and\n\n (iii) 25% by direct recruitment from amongst the eligible advocates\n\n based on written and viva voce test.\n\n(5) Accordingly, all the High Courts were directed to frame appropriate\n\n rules in terms of the aforesaid directions. The relevant observations read as\n\n under: -\n\n “27. Another question which falls for consideration is the method of\n recruitment to the posts in the cadre of Higher Judicial Service i.e.\n District Judges and Additional District Judges. At the present\n moment, there are two sources for recruitment to the Higher Judicial\n Service, namely, by promotion from amongst the members of the\n Subordinate Judicial Service and by direct recruitment. The\n subordinate judiciary is the foundation of the edifice of the judicial\n system. It is, therefore, imperative, like any other foundation, that it\n should become as strong as possible. The weight on the judicial\n system essentially rests on the subordinate judiciary. While we have\n accepted the recommendation of the Shetty Commission which will\n result in the increase in the pay scales of the subordinate judiciary,\n it is at the same time necessary that the judicial officers, hard-\n working as they are, become more efficient. It is imperative that they\n keep abreast of knowledge of law and the latest pronouncements, and\n it is for this reason that the Shetty Commission has recommended the\n establishment of a Judicial Academy, which is very necessary. At the\n same time, we are of the opinion that there has to be certain minimum\n standard, objectively adjudged, for officers who are to enter the\n Higher Judicial Service as Additional District Judges and District\n Judges. While we agree with the Shetty Commission that the\n recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service i.e. the District Judge\n cadre from amongst the advocates should be 25 per cent and the\n process of recruitment is to be by a competitive examination, both\n written and viva voce, we are of the opinion that there should be an\n objective method of testing the suitability of the subordinate judicial\n officers for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service. Furthermore,\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 30 of 84\n\n\f there should also be an incentive amongst the relatively junior and\n other officers to improve and to compete with each other so as to\n excel and get quicker promotion. In this way, we expect that the\n calibre of the members of the Higher Judicial Service will further\n improve. In order to achieve this, while the ratio of 75 per cent\n appointment by promotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to\n the Higher Judicial Service is maintained, we are, however, of the\n opinion that there should be two methods as far as appointment by\n promotion is concerned : 50 per cent of the total posts in the Higher\n Judicial Service must be filled by promotion on the basis of principle\n of merit-cum-seniority. For this purpose, the High Courts should\n devise and evolve a test in order to ascertain and examine the legal\n knowledge of those candidates and to assess their continued\n efficiency with adequate knowledge of case-law. The remaining 25\n per cent of the posts in the service shall be filled by promotion strictly\n on the basis of merit through the limited departmental competitive\n examination for which the qualifying service as a Civil Judge (Senior\n Division) should be not less than five years. The High Courts will\n have to frame a rule in this regard.\n\n 28. As a result of the aforesaid, to recapitulate, we direct that\n recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service i.e. the cadre of District\n Judges will be:\n\n (1)\n\n (a) 50 per cent by promotion from amongst the Civil Judges\n (Senior Division) on the basis of principle of merit-cum-\n seniority and passing a suitability test;\n\n (b) 25 per cent by promotion strictly on the basis of merit\n through limited competitive examination of Civil Judges\n (Senior Division) having not less than five years' qualifying\n service; and\n\n (c) 25 per cent of the posts shall be filled by direct recruitment\n from amongst the eligible advocates on the basis of the\n written and viva voce test conducted by respective High\n Courts.\n\n (2) Appropriate rules shall be framed as above by the High Courts\n as early as possible.\n\n 29. [...] As a result of the decision today, there will, in a way, be three\n ways of recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service. The quota for\n promotion which we have prescribed is 50 per cent by following the\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 31 of 84\n\n\f principle “merit-cum-seniority”, 25 per cent strictly on merit by\n limited departmental competitive examination and 25 per cent by\n direct recruitment. [...]”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n53. Thereafter, in \nMalik Mazhar Sultan & Anr. (1) v. U.P. Public Service\n\nCommission\n reported in (2006) 9 SCC 507, this Court underscored the\n\nimportance for filling up judicial vacancies on time and directed the High Courts\n\nto undertake necessary steps towards fixing a timeline for determining vacancies,\n\nissuing advertisements, conducting examinations, interviews and declaring\n\nresults for final appointment. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “23. It is absolutely necessary to evolve a mechanism to speedily\n determine and fill vacancies of judges at all levels. For this purpose,\n timely steps are required to be taken for determination of vacancies,\n issue of advertisement, conducting examinations, interviews,\n declaration of the final results and issue of orders of appointments.\n For all these and other steps, if any, it is necessary to provide for\n fixed time schedule so that the system works automatically and there\n is no delay in filling up of vacancies. [...]”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n54. The aforesaid was followed by the decision in \nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation (4) v. Union of India\n reported in (2010) 15 SCC 170, wherein this\n\nCourt took note of the fact that various posts of the cadre of District & Sessions\n\nJudge earmarked for the 25% promotional quota strictly on the basis of merit\n\nwere lying vacant on account of insufficiency of candidates or their inability to\n\nclear the competitive exam. In such circumstances, it was directed that the 25%\n\npromotional quota, to be filled on the basis of Merit, shall be reduced to 10% of\n\nthe cadre strength, and the 50% promotional quota to be filled by ‘Merit-cum-\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 32 of 84\n\n\fSeniority’ shall be increased to 65% of the total seats. The relevant observations\n\nread as under: -\n\n “6. Having regard to various strategies available, we are of the\n considered view that suitable amendment is to be made for this 25%\n quota of limited departmental competitive examination. We are also\n of the view, with the past experience, that it is desirable that 25%\n quota be reduced to 10%. We feel so as the required result, which\n was sought to be achieved by this process could not be achieved, thus\n it calls for modification.\n\n 7. Thus, we direct that henceforth only 10% of the cadre strength of\n District Judges be filled up by limited departmental competitive\n examination with those candidates who have qualified service of five\n years as Civil Judge (Senior Division). Every year vacancies are to\n be ascertained and the process of selection shall be taken care of by\n the High Courts. If any of the post is not filled up under 10% quota,\n the same shall be filled up by regular promotion. In some of the High\n Courts, process of selection of these 25% quota by holding limited\n departmental competitive examination is in progress, such process\n can be continued and the unfilled seats, if meritorious candidates are\n available, should be filled up. But if for some reason the seats are not\n filled up, they may be filled up by regular promotion and apply the\n usual mode of promotion process. Thus we pass the following order.\n\n 8. Hereinafter, there shall be 25% of seats for direct recruitment\n from the Bar, 65% of seats are to be filled up by regular promotion\n of Civil Judge (Senior Division) and 10% seats are to be filled up by\n limited departmental competitive examination. If candidates are not\n available for 10% seats, or are not able to qualify in the examination\n then vacant posts are to be filled up by regular promotion in\n accordance with the Service Rules applicable.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n55. \nIn \nMalik Mazhar Sultan & Anr. (3) v. U.P. Public Service Commission\n\n& Ors.\n reported in (2009) 17 SCC 530 this Court, in view of the large number of\n\nvacancies in the promotional quota in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge,\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 33 of 84\n\n\fdirected the High Courts to be practical in the matters of promotion and ensure\n\ntimely filling up of the vacancies on the basis of the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-\n\nMerit’, deviating from the observations in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3)\n\n(supra) mandating promotion by ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’. It further observed that\n\nseniority should have a predominant role in giving promotions to the Civil Judges\n\n(Senior Division) and that the High Court may decline promotion only in case the\n\nJudicial Officer is not suitable for being promoted. The relevant observations read\n\nas under: -\n\n “3.

Relevant Statutory Provisions of the Gujarat State Judicial Service\n Rules, 2005.\n\n56. At this stage, it would be necessary to look into the statutory scheme and\n\nrefer to the relevant provisions governing the promotion of Civil Judges (Senior\n\nDivision) to the cadre of District & Sessions Judge in the State of Gujarat.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 34 of 84\n\n\f57. The 2005 Rules provide for the service conditions and policies pertaining\n\nto the Judicial Officers and the service framework of the District Judiciary in the\n\nState of Gujarat.\n\n58. Rule 5 sub-rule (1) of the 2005 Rules provides for the various modes or\n\nmethods of appointment to the cadre of District & Sessions Judge. Rule 5(1) of\n\nthe 2005 Rules framed in accordance with the directions issued in \nAll India\n\nJudges’ Association\n (3) (supra), lays down three distinct modes of recruitment\n\nto the cadre of District & Sessions Judge. The said Rule reads as under: -\n\n “5. Method of recruitment, qualification and age limit.\n\n (1) Recruitment to the cadre of District Judges shall be as under, -\n (I) 50 per cent by promotion from amongst the Senior Civil\n Judges on the basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority\n and passing a suitability test.\n\n (II) 25 per cent by promotion strictly on the basis of merit\n through limited competitive examination of Senior Civil\n Judges having not less than five years qualifying service,\n and\n (III) 25 per cent of the posts shall be filled by direct\n recruitment from amongst the eligible advocates on the\n basis of the written and viva voce test conducted by the\n High Court.”\n\n59. Rule 5(1) sub-clause (I) of the 2005 Rules provides that appointment to\n\n50% of the posts in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge shall be by promotion\n\nfrom the cadre of Civil Judges (Senior Division) i.e., the feeder cadre, on the basis\n\nof the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and upon passing a Suitability Test. In\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 35 of 84\n\n\fother words, 50% of the posts of District & Sessions Judge shall be filled by\n\npromotions on the basis of the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’.\n\n60. Rule 5(2) sub-clause (II) of the 2005 Rules provides that 25% of the posts\n\nin the cadre of District & Sessions Judge shall be filled by promotions on the\n\nbasis of merit through a limited departmental competitive examination.\n\n61. Rule 5(2) sub-clause (III) provides the third method of recruitment, by\n\nwhich the remaining 25% of the posts in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge\n\nshall be filled by direct recruitment of the eligible advocates on the basis of a\n\nwritten exam and viva-voce.\n\n62. Pursuant to the directions of this Court in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n\n(4) (supra), Rule 5 \nreferred to above\n was amended by the Gujarat State Judicial\n\nService (Amendment) Rules, 2011, whereby, the second category of posts being\n\nthe 25% promotional quota to be strictly filled on the basis of merit, was reduced\n\nto 10% and the 50% promotional quota, to be filled on the basis of principle of\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and passing a Suitability Test, was increased to 65%.\n\n63. In other words, the aforesaid 2011 amendment reduced the posts for\n\npromotion on the basis of merit from 25% to 10% and increased the posts for\n\npromotion on the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ from 50% to 65% in the\n\ncadre of District & Sessions Judge.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 36 of 84\n\n\f64. Rule 5 sub-rule (3) further prescribes the eligibility criteria for the aforesaid\n\ntwo modes of promotion provided in Rule 5(1) of the 2005 Rules, as amended in\n\n2011. The said rule reads as under: -\n\n “5. Method of recruitment, qualification and age limit.\n (3) (I) For being eligible for promotion against 65% of the total posts\n in the cadre of District Judges required to be filled by promotion on\n the basis of the principle of merit-cum-seniority, the qualifying\n service as Senior Civil Judge shall not be less than two years service\n in the cadre.\n\n (II) For eligibility for promotion against the remaining 10% posts\n required to be filled in by promotion strictly on the basis of merit\n through limited departmental competitive examination, the qualifying\n service as Senior Civil Judge shall not be less than five years.”\n\n65. Rule 5 sub-rule (3)(I) of the 2005 Rules stipulates that a minimum of two-\n\nyears of qualifying service in the feeder cadre i.e., as a Civil Judge (Senior\n\nDivision) is required in order to be eligible to participate in the promotion process\n\nfor the 65% posts in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge on the basis of the\n\nprinciple of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ as envisaged under Rule 5(1)(I). In other\n\nwords, all Civil Judges (Senior Division), having a minimum of two-years of\n\nservice, are eligible to be promoted to the 65% posts in the cadre of District &\n\nSessions Judge on the basis of the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’.\n\n66. On the other hand, Rule 5 sub-rule (3)(II) provides for the requirement of\n\na minimum of five-years of qualifying service in the feeder cadre i.e., as a Civil\n\nJudge (Senior Division), for participating in the promotion process for the 10%\n\nposts in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge on the basis of strict merit as\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 37 of 84\n\n\fprovided under Rule 5(1)(ii) of the 2005 Rules. In other words, all Civil Judges\n\n(Senior Division) who have completed a minimum of five-years of service are\n\neligible to be promoted to the 10% posts in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge\n\non the basis of Merit through the competitive examination.\n\n67. In other words, a combined reading of the aforesaid Rule 5(1) with Rule\n\n5(3) of the 2005 Rules makes it clear that there are three distinct modes of\n\nrecruitment to the cadre of District & Sessions Judge which are as follows: -\n\n(I) 65% posts by promotion from the eligible Civil Judges (Senior Division)\n having a minimum of two-years of service on the basis of ‘Merit-cum-\n Seniority’;\n\n(II) 10% posts by promotion from eligible Civil Judges (Senior Division) with\n a minimum of five-years of service on basis of merit through a competitive\n examination and;\n\n(III) 25% posts by direct recruitment from the eligible members of the Bar on\n the basis of a written exam and viva voce.\n\niii. Evolution of the Principles of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-\n\n cum-Merit’ in Service Jurisprudence.\n\na. Concept of Promotion: The meaning and origin of seniority and merit\n as parameters.\n\n68. Promotion is an integral part of any formal sector employment. The\n\nprincipal object of a promotion system is to secure the best possible incumbents\n\nfor higher positions while maintaining the morale of the whole organization.1 In\n\n1\n\n High Court of \nCalcutta v. Amal Kumar Roy\n, (1963) 1 SCR 437.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 38 of 84\n\n\fthe matter of formulation of a policy for promotion to a higher post, the two\n\ncompeting principles which are taken into account are inter-se seniority and\n\ncomparative merit of employees who are eligible for promotion.\n\nUnderstanding the meaning of Seniority and Merit\n\n69. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines ‘seniority’ as follows2: -\n\n “Represents in the highest degree the right to work, and by seniority\n the oldest man in point of service, ability and fitness for the job being\n sufficient, is given choice of jobs, is first promoted within range of\n jobs subject to seniority, and is the last laid off, proceeding so on\n down the line to the youngest in point of service.”\n\n70. Weber, the sociologist, described “promotion according to seniority or to\n\nachievement” as an important component of an efficient bureaucracy. 3\n\nEstablishing a promotion system based on seniority is fundamental to modern\n\nmanagement, which ensures that individuals joining an organization have\n\nopportunities for career advancement. Further, promotions based on seniority is\n\ntried and tested method because those who have been engaged at the employment\n\nfor longer have had more time to refine the skills necessary for the higher posts.\n\nWhat constitutes ‘Merit’\n\n71. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, merit is defined as the quality of\n\nbeing good and deserving. In the context of employment, it is the sum total of\n\nvarious qualities which are relevant for fulfilling the requirements of the\n\n2\n\n Henry Campbell Black, Black’s Law Dictionary, p. 1528 (6th Edn., 1968).\n\n3\n\n H. Gerth and C.W. Mills, From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, 199, 202 (Oxford University Press,\nNew York, 1958).\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 39 of 84\n\n\femployment.4 There are multiple attributes of merit which must be taken into\n\nconsideration such as character, integrity, and devotion to the assigned official\n\nduties. The manner in which the candidate discharges their final duties would also\n\nbe a relevant factor.\n\n72. Further, past performance is a relevant factor to judge the merit of the\n\ncandidate, particularly in promotional posts, since it would indicate the capability\n\nof the candidate to discharge their duties effectively. Merely because any person\n\npossesses higher qualifications or higher marks in an examination does not mean\n\nthat they are meritorious than others.5\n\n73. In the United States, the Federal Civil Services Act of 1871, provides for\n\nfilling of vacancies in higher positions by competitive promotion tests, wherever\n\npracticable. H. Eliot Kaplan, General Counsel of the New York Bar, in his “Law\n\nof Civil Services” writes that in some jurisdictions promotions may be made on\n\na wider basis, the field of promotion being left to the discretion of the personnel\n\nagency.6 He also notes that the eligibility requirements for promotion are usually\n\nnot specified in the statutes but are usually left to be determined by rules of the\n\npersonnel agency. Personnel agencies fix educational and experience\n\nrequirements for eligibility to compete for promotion. A hint of the ‘Merit-cum-\n\n4\n\nK.K. Parmar v. High\n Court of Gujarat, (2006) 5 SCC 789.\n\n5\n\nKartar Kaur v. State\n, (1967) SLR 34.\n\n6\n\n , H. Eliot Kaplan, The Law of Civil Services (New York University Press, Mathew Bender & Company,\nNew York, 1958).\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 40 of 84\n\n\fSeniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ principle can be traced in his words where\n\nhe states that where the law requires that promotions be made from among those\n\nserving in the next lower grade, the incumbents of such lower positions would be\n\ndeemed to be presumably qualified for promotion. For ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’,\n\nparticularly, the competitive test/qualification criteria would serve to determine\n\nthe relative excellence among those presumably qualified for promotion7, so that\n\nthose demonstrating superior merit and fitness would be available to fill the\n\nvacancies.8\n\n74. In Britain, the 1854 Northcote-Trevelyan Report founded a public service\n\nsystem based on merit, where open competitive examinations were practiced\n\nunder the principle of promotion by merit but also held that seniority and\n\nexperience counted in some respects.9\n\n75. Similarly, in France, the 19th century saw the introduction of the doctrine\n\nof the “Concours” or competitive examination to support the merit system in the\n\ncivil service, yet giving seniority and experience due regard in promotion to\n\nhigher ranks.10\n\n7\n\n Id.\n\n8\n\n Elman, B.A., Political, social, and cultural reproduction via civil service examinations in late imperial China,\n50(1) Journal of Asian Studies, pp.7-28 (1991).\n\n9\n\n Jenifer Hart, The genesis of the Northcote–Trevelyan report, in Studies in the growth of nineteenth\ncentury government pp. 63-81 (Ed.

During the British Raj, the East India Company adopted the principle of\n\nseniority for promotions. This principle was officially recognized in the Charter\n\nAct, 1793 and continued until the enactment of the Indian Civil Service Act, 1861.\n\nApart from the seniority principle, considerations of merit, integrity, competence,\n\nand ability were also taken into account for promotions. This ‘Seniority-cum-\n\nMerit’ formula remained in practice until 1947.\n\n77. The Indian Civil Service (hereinafter referred as the “ICS”) system,\n\ninitiated in the 19th century, encapsulated aspects of recruitment based on\n\ncompetitive examinations and seniority. For entry into the ICS, competitive\n\nexaminations were conducted and for promotions to higher positions, seniority\n\nand experience were considered as important factors.\n\n78. Under the Charter Act, 1833, following Lord Macaulay’s Report of the\n\nSelect Committee of British Parliament11, the concept of competitive\n\nexaminations in modern Civil Services in India was introduced in 1854. The\n\nReport recommended that the patronage-based system of East India Company\n\nshould be replaced by a permanent Civil Service where candidates are recruited\n\nthrough competitive examinations.12 As stated, competitive examinations were\n\n“designed to protect career employees against improper political influences or\n\n11\n\n The Macaulay Committee’s Report on the Indian Civil Service 1854.\n\n12\n\n History of the Commission, Union Public Service Commission.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 42 of 84\n\n\fpersonal favouritism in the recruiting, hiring, promotion, or dismissal processes,\n\nto ensure that personnel management is conducted without discrimination”.13\n\n79. The First Pay Commission in 1947 recommended a blend of direct\n\nrecruitment and promotion, suggesting that seniority be emphasized for roles\n\nrequiring familiarity with office work, while merit be the basis for higher-level\n\npositions. Subsequent commissions, such as the Second Pay Commission in 1959\n\nand the First Administrative Reforms Commission in 1969, echoed the\n\nimportance of merit-based promotions alongside seniority.\n\n80. The principle of seniority as a parameter of selection for promotion was\n\nfound to be derived from the belief that competence is related to experience and\n\nthat it limits the scope of discretion and favouritism. There is always an additional\n\nassumption that long-serving employees have demonstrated loyalty to the\n\nemploying organization and so are entitled to reciprocal treatment.\n\n81. However, in India, no government servant can claim promotion as their\n\nright because the Constitution does not prescribe criteria for filling seats in\n\npromotional posts. The Legislature or the executive may decide the method for\n\nfilling vacancies to promotional posts based on the nature of employment and the\n\nfunctions that the candidate will be expected to discharge. The courts cannot sit\n\nin review to decide whether the policy adopted for promotion is suited to select\n\n13\n\n S. REP.

Principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ in\n Service Jurisprudence.\n\n82. This Court in its decision in \nState of Kerala & Anr. v. N.M. Thomas &\n\nOrs.\n reported in (1976) 2 SCC 310 held that policies pertaining to promotions\n\ncan be said to broadly fall within two distinct categories being: (i) promotions\n\nwhich are based on the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and, (ii) promotions\n\nwhich are based on the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’. It further held that\n\nwhen it comes to promotions based on principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, a\n\nsenior who has the minimum requisite merit shall be entitled to promotion even\n\nthough there might be others who are more meritorious. The relevant\n\nobservations read as under: -\n\n “38. The principle of equality is applicable to employment at all\n stages and in all respects, namely, initial recruitment promotion,\n retirement, payment of pension and gratuity. With regard to\n promotion the normal principles are either merit-cum-seniority or\n seniority-cum-merit, Seniority-cum-merit means that given the\n minimum necessary merit requisite for efficiency of administration,\n the senior though the less meritorious shall have priority. This will\n not violate \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n and \n16(2).\n A rule which provides that\n given the necessary requisite merit, a member of the backward class\n shall get priority to ensure adequate representation will not similarly\n violate \nArticle 14\n or \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n [...]”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 44 of 84\n\n \n83. This Court in \nState of Mysore v. Syed Mahmood\n reported in (1968) 3\n\nS.C.R. 363, on the criterion of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ observed that any rule that\n\nmandates selection based on the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, such rule\n\nmandates that the promotions must be determined through a selection process that\n\nevaluates “seniority, subject to the fitness of the candidate, to discharge the duties\n\nof the post from among persons eligible for promotion”. In consequence, where\n\npromotion is based on the ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ principle, the candidate cannot\n\nclaim promotion as a matter of right on the grounds of his seniority alone. Further,\n\nif the officer fails to discharge his duties of the higher post, he may be passed\n\nover by a junior officer.\n\n84. \nIn \nJagathigowda, C.N. & Ors. v. Chairman, Cauvery Gramina Bank &\n\nOrs\n, reported in (1996) 9 SCC 677, while moving a step ahead, it was held that\n\nwhere promotion is based on the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, it would still\n\nbe open for the selection committee to take into consideration the performance\n\nappraisal forms to first ascertain the suitability of the candidates being considered\n\nfor promotion. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “8. [...] It is settled proposition of law that even while making\n promotions on the basis of seniority-cum-merit the totality of the\n service record of the officer concerned has to be taken into\n consideration. The performance appraisal forms are maintained\n primarily for the purpose that the same are taken into consideration\n when the person concerned is considered for promotion to the higher\n rank. The High Court, with respect, was not justified in holding that\n the performance appraisal could not be taken into consideration by\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 45 of 84\n\n\f the Director's Committee while considering the officers for\n promotion to the higher rank.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n85. This Court in \nRajendra Kumar Srivastava & Ors. v. Samyut Kshetriya\n\nGramin Bank & Ors.\n reported in (2010) 1 SCC 335 held that where promotion\n\nis on the basis of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, the standard method is to first ascertain\n\nthe candidates who possess the minimum required merit and thereafter making\n\npromotions strictly on the basis of seniority from among those who are found to\n\npossess the minimum necessary merit. It further held that the minimum requisite\n\nmerit may be ascertained from either one or a combination of multiple processes\n\nof assessment. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “11. It is also well settled that the principle of seniority-cum-merit,\n for promotion, is different from the principle of “seniority” and the\n principle of “merit-cum-seniority”. Where promotion is on the basis\n of seniority alone, merit will not play any part at all. But where\n promotion is on the principle of seniority-cum-merit, promotion is not\n automatic with reference to seniority alone. Merit will also play a\n significant role. The standard method of seniority-cum-merit is to\n subject all the eligible candidates in the feeder grade (possessing the\n prescribed educational qualification and period of service) to a\n process of assessment of a specified minimum necessary merit and\n then promote the candidates who are found to possess the minimum\n necessary merit strictly in the order of seniority. The minimum merit\n necessary for the post may be assessed either by subjecting the\n candidates to a written examination or an interview or by assessment\n of their work performance during the previous years, or by a\n combination of either two or all the three of the aforesaid methods.\n There is no hard-and-fast rule as to how the minimum merit is to be\n ascertained. So long as the ultimate promotions are based on\n seniority, any process for ascertaining the minimum necessary merit,\n as a basic requirement, will not militate against the principle of\n seniority-cum-merit.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 46 of 84\n\n\f 13. Thus it is clear that a process whereby eligible candidates\n possessing the minimum necessary merit in the feeder posts is first\n ascertained and thereafter, promotions are made strictly in\n accordance with seniority, from among those who possess the\n minimum necessary merit is recognised and accepted as complying\n with the principle of “seniority-cum-merit”. What would offend the\n rule of seniority-cum-merit is a process where after assessing the\n minimum necessary merit, promotions are made on the basis of merit\n (instead of seniority) from among the candidates possessing the\n minimum necessary merit. If the criteria adopted for assessment of\n minimum necessary merit is bona fide and not unreasonable, it is not\n open to challenge, as being opposed to the principle of seniority-cum-\n\n merit. We accordingly hold that prescribing minimum qualifying\n marks to ascertain the minimum merit necessary for discharging the\n functions of the higher post, is not violative of the concept of\n promotion by seniority-cum-merit.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n86. \nIn \nDr. Kavita Kamboj\n (supra), this Court speaking eruditely through one\n\nof us, Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, CJI., observed that the principle of ‘Merit-cum-\n\nSeniority’ is an approved method of selection where the emphasis is primarily on\n\nthe comparative merit of the judicial officers being considered for promotion\n\nwhereby even a junior who demonstrates greater merit than the senior can be\n\nconsidered for promotion. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n \n“45. [...] The principle of merit-cum seniority is an approved method\n of selection where merit is the determinative factor and seniority\n plays a less significant role. Where the principle of ‘merit-cum\n seniority’ is the basis, the emphasis is primarily on the comparative\n merit of the judicial officers being considered for promotion.\n Resultantly, even a junior officer who demonstrates greater merit\n than a senior officer will be considered for promotion.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n[Also see Central Council for Research in \nAyurveda and Siddha and Anr. v.\nDr. K. Santhakumari\n reported in (2001) 5 SCC 60]\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 47 of 84\n\n \n87. This Court in \nB.V. Sivaiah & Ors. v. K. Addankl Babu & Ors.\n reported in\n\n(1998) 6 SCC 720 whilst explaining the difference between the principle of\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ vis-à-vis the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, held as\n\nfollows: -\n\n(i) First, where promotion is based on the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ a\n\n greater emphasis is laid on merit & the ability of the candidate and seniority\n\n is to be given weight where merit and ability are approximately equal.\n\n Whereas, when it comes to the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, the\n\n promotion is to be made on the basis of seniority alone subject to having the\n\n minimum requisite merit and suitability of the candidate amongst the eligible\n\n persons. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “9. The principle of 'merit-cum-seniority lays greater\n emphasis on merit and ability and seniority plays a less\n significant role. Seniority is to be given weight only where\n merit and ability are approximately equal. [...]\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 18. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the criterion of\n 'seniority-cum-merit' in the matter of promotion postulates\n that given the minimum necessary merit requisite for\n efficiency of administration the senior, even though less\n meritorious, shall have priority and a comparative\n assessment of merit is not required to be made. For assessing\n the minimum necessary merit the competent authority can lay\n down the minimum standard that is required and also\n prescribe the mode of assessment of merit of the employee\n who is eligible for consideration for promotion. Such\n assessment can be made by assigning marks on the basis of\n appraisal of performance on the basis of service record and\n interview and prescribing the minimum marks which would\n entitle a person to be promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\n merit.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 48 of 84\n\n\f(ii) Secondly, the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ postulates the\n\n requirement of making a comparative assessment of merit, whereas no\n\n such comparative assessment is required where the criterion for promotion\n\n is based on the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’. Even if the candidates\n\n have the same length of service, it is only to be determined whether the\n\n candidates possess the minimum required threshold of merit or not. The\n\n relevant observations read as under: -\n\n \n“15. [...] Since comparation assessment of merit is required\n to made while applying the criterion of 'merit cum-seniority'\n and for 'seniority-cum merit' no such comparative assessment\n is required, the aforementioned observations in the case of\n \nC.R. Seshadri\n (supra) on which reliance has been placed\n cannot be regarded as correctly reflecting as what is meant\n by the criterion of 'seniority-cum-merit'.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 17. [...] We are unable to agree. While applying the principle\n of seniority-cum-merit for the purpose of promotion what is\n required to be considered is inter se seniority of the\n employees who are eligible for consideration. Such seniority\n is normally determined on the basis of length of service, but\n as between employees appointed on the same date and having\n the same length of service, it is generally determined on the\n basis of placement in the select list for appointment. Such\n determination of seniority confers certain rights and the\n principle of seniority-cum-merit gives effect to the such rights\n flowing from seniority. It cannot, therefore, be said that in the\n matter of promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\n seniority has no role where the employees eligible for\n promotion were appointed on the same date and have the\n same length of service.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 49 of 84\n\n\f(iii) Thirdly, the Court concluded by observing that where the criterion of\n\n promotion is principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, marks can only be\n\n prescribed as a ‘minimum qualifying requirement’ and as such where\n\n promotion was being given to the eligible seniormost candidates on the\n\n basis of their individual marks, such promotion would be contrary to the\n\n principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’. The relevant observations read as\n\n under: -\n\n “26. It is not a case where minimum qualifying marks are\n prescribed for assessment of performance and merit and\n those who secure the prescribed minimum qualifying marks\n are selected for promotion on the basis of seniority. \nIn the\n circumstances, it must be held that the High Court has rightly\n come to the conclusion that the mode of selection that was in\n fact employed was contrary to the principle of 'seniority-cum-\n merit\n' \nlaid down in\n the Rules.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n88.

Ramaseshaiah & Ors.\n\nreported in (2017) 5 SCC 783 reiterated the distinction between the principles of\n\n‘Seniority-cum-merit’ and ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’. As far as promotion by\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 50 of 84\n\n\f‘seniority-cum-merit’ or seniority per se, the eligible senior cannot be\n\nsuperseded. Other things being equal, the senior automatically get promoted. But\n\nin the case of selection based on ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’, the senior candidate can\n\nbe superseded if the candidate who is senior is not otherwise eligible to be\n\nconsidered according to the applicable service rules.\n\n90. This Court in its decision in \nK. Samantaray v. National Insurance Co.\n\nLtd.\n reported in (2004) 9 SCC 286 reaffirmed that when it comes to promotion,\n\napart from the two guiding principles that have come to be accepted namely;\n\n‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ and ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’, a third model has also now\n\ncome to be recognized as a mode of promotion known as the ‘Hybrid Mode of\n\nPromotion’. This Court while explaining the ‘Hybrid Mode of Promotion’\n\nobserved that the requirement is that seniority is to be duly respected and merit is\n\nto be appropriately recognized. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “10. [...] The third mode (apart from seniority-cum-merit and merit-\n cum-seniority modes) has been recognized. It has been described as\n a “hybrid mode of promotion”. In other words, there is a third\n category of cases where seniority is duly respected and merit is\n appropriately recognized.\n\n \n11. While laying down the promotion policy or rule, it is always open\n to the employer to specify area and parameter of weightage to be\n given in respect of merit and seniority separately so long as policy is\n not colourable exercise of power, nor has the effect of violating of\n any statutory scope of interference and other relatable matters. The\n decision in \nB. V. Sivaiah\n case (supra) is clearly distinguishable on\n facts and in law. That was a case where statutory rules governed the\n field. This Court, inter alia, held that fixing terms which are at\n variance with the statutory rules is impermissible. In the case at hand,\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 51 of 84\n\n\f prior to the formulation of policy in February, 1990, there were no\n codified prescriptions. It was the stand of the respondent-employer\n that prior to the formulation of the policy, certain guidelines existed\n and the objectives of the policy were to rationalize and codify the\n existing guidelines relating to promotions within officers cadre.\n\n There is no statutory rule operating. It is for the employer to stipulate\n the criteria for promotion, the same pertaining really to the area of\n policy making. It was, therefore, permissible for the respondent to\n have their own criteria for adjudging claims on the principle of\n seniority-cum-merit giving primacy to merit as well, depending upon\n the class, category and nature of posts in the hierarchy of\n administration and the requirements of efficiency for such posts.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n91. \nIn \nBhagwandas Tiwari & Ors. v. Dewas Shajapur Kshetriya Gramin\n\nBank & Ors.\n reported in (2006) 12 SCC 574, this Court observed that although\n\nthe requirement of minimum marks for assessing merit can be prescribed for the\n\npurpose of promotion on the basis of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, yet where a very\n\nhigh requirement of minimum marks has been prescribed, the same would\n\namount to laying greater emphasis on merit and thereby departing from the\n\nprinciple of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ and shifting towards to the principle of ‘Merit-\n\ncum-Seniority’ where merit and ability play a predominant role. The relevant\n\nobservations read as under: -\n\n “11. The principle of “merit-cum-seniority” lays greater emphasis\n on merit and ability and seniority plays a less significant role.\n Seniority is to be given weight only when merit and ability are\n approximately equal.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 20. There is no basis, in the instant case, for the stand that for\n assessing merit a minimum number of marks has been prescribed.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 52 of 84\n\n\f The contention that minimum marks were 45 out of 60, means that an\n employee is to secure 75% of marks. Such a high percentage cannot\n be a measure for prescribing minimum marks to assess merit. It\n obviously would be a case of shifting the focus to merit-cum-seniority\n principle. \nIn para 37 of \nSivaiah\n case this Court noted that minimum\n marks prescribed for assessing merit do not depart from the\n seniority-cum-merit principle. But the factual position is different\n here. There is no mention that 45 marks out of 60 relate to the\n prescription of minimum marks for assessing the merit.\n \nIn \nJalal\n Uddin\n case it was noted that in seniority-cum-merit greater emphasis\n is on seniority though it is not the determinative factor. In the case of\n merit-cum-seniority, merit becomes a determinative factor.\n \nIn fact,\n the position noted by this Court in paras 19, 20, 24 and 25 of \nSivaiah\n\n case dealt with almost identical fact situation, apart from para 16 of\n the judgment.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n92. \nIn \nShriram Tomar & Anr. v. Praveen Kumar Jaggi & Ors.\n reported in\n\n(2019) 5 SCC 736, for the purpose of promotion on the basis of ‘Seniority-cum-\n\nMerit’ it was stipulated that the assessment would be on the basis of a written test,\n\ninterview and performance appraisal for a grand total of 100 marks out of which\n\nrequirement of a minimum aggregate of 40% marks was prescribed. In addition\n\nto the above, a further requirement of minimum 12 marks in one of the\n\ncomponents i.e., the interview had also been prescribed.\n\n93.1 This Court held that the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ postulates only\n\none requirement i.e., once the minimum required merit is assessed, thereafter the\n\npromotion must be strictly in accordance with the seniority of the candidates\n\nhaving the requisite merit. How the minimum merit ought to be assessed is\n\nimmaterial.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 53 of 84\n\n\f93.2 As such, prescribing of an additional requirement of minimum marks in\n\nany one component of assessment such as interview in addition to the requirement\n\nof aggregate minimum marks in the overall assessment process was permissible\n\nunder the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ provided that the ultimate promotion\n\nis taking place as per seniority. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “13. [...] As the promotion to the post of Junior Management Scale II\n shall be made on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, the only\n requirement would be that after it is found that the candidates have\n possessed the minimum necessary merit, namely, minimum 40%\n qualifying marks in the written test and minimum 12 marks each out\n of 20 marks each in interview and the performance appraisal reports\n respectively, thereafter the candidates are required to be promoted in\n the order of seniority, irrespective of anyone among them having\n obtained more marks.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n93. \nIn \nSujata Kohli v. Registrar General, High\n Court of Delhi and Ors.\n\nreported in (2020) 14 SCC 58, this Court observed that since both the channels\n\nof promotion to the cadre of District & Sessions Judge being (i) 65% promotion\n\non basis of principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and (ii) 10% promotion strictly on\n\nmerit through competitive examination postulate the criterion of merit, it\n\nnecessarily meant that: -\n\n(i) First, for the purposes of any promotion through the above two channels,\n\n merit would have to play a major role in promotion through these channels\n\n and will acquire primacy and that seniority alone cannot be given primacy.\n\n(ii) Secondly, the requirement of merit in such promotions cannot be less than\n\n the merit which is required at the entry level i.e., in the lower cadres.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 54 of 84\n\n\f(iii) Thirdly, that comparative assessment of merit is crucial, such as through\n\n the evaluation of the respective ACRs of the candidates.\n\nThus, this Court was of the view that the minimum requirement of grade ‘A’ in\n\nACRs was in consonance with the policy envisaged by the abovementioned two\n\nchannels of promotion and the relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “14.3 [...] As noticed, two channels of recruitment to the posts in the\n cadre of District Judge have been provided: one by promotion from\n amongst the Civil Judges (Senior Division) and another by direct\n recruitment from the eligible persons. As regards promotion, the\n bifurcation is provided in the manner that 65% are to be recruited by\n way of promotion on the basis of merit-cum-seniority and 10% by\n promotion strictly on the basis of merit through limited competitive\n examination (vide Rule 7 and 7A). [...]\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 15. Keeping the principles aforesaid in view, when we revert to the\n scheme of the Rules of 1970, the striking feature is that even at the\n entry level, the promotions are to be made either on merit-cum-\n\n seniority basis or on merit basis. Further, grant of Selection Grade\n and Super Time Scale is also on assessment of merit-cum-seniority10.\n In the given scheme of the Rules of 1970, it is difficult to countenance\n any suggestion that in DHJS, merit could be forsaken at any level or\n only seniority be given primacy in the matter relating to upward\n progression to the higher posts of District and Sessions Judge or\n Principal Judge, Family Court. Rather, looking to the nature of posts,\n in every higher progression, merit would play a major role and\n would, perforce, acquire primacy.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 19.1. [...] Viewed in the light of such requirements, it goes without\n saying that any upward progression in DHJS could only be on the\n higher requirements of merit and in any case, such requirements\n cannot be lesser than the requirements at entry level. In this view of\n the matter too, the Appellant was conscious of the fact that for upward\n movement in DHJS, merit would acquire primacy; and that seniority\n alone was not going to be decisive for promotion to the higher posts\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 55 of 84\n\n\f of District and Sessions Judge and the Principal Judge, Family\n Court. Although there is no requirement in law that criteria for\n promotion based on ACR alone be also notified but, in any case, in\n the scheme of the Rules and the requirements of the posts in question,\n the Appellant cannot contend that she was not aware of the position\n that comparative merit of the incumbents shall be a crucial factor for\n any upward progression in the cadre.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nc. ‘Hybrid-Dynamic Mode of Promotion’ in Service Jurisprudence.\n\n94. What can be discerned from the aforenoted decisions is that this Court over\n\nthe years has consistently held that where promotion is on the basis of the\n\nprinciple of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ a greater emphasis is placed on merit,\n\nwhereas, when the promotion is on the basis of the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-\n\nMerit’, a greater emphasis is laid on seniority.\n\n95. One must be mindful that the terms ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ or ‘Seniority-\n\ncum-Merit’ are not statutorily defined by the legislature.\n\n96. These principles are judicial connotations that have been evolved over a\n\nperiod of years through various decisions of this Court and the High Courts whilst\n\ndealing with matters of promotion pertaining to different statutes and service\n\nconditions.\n\n97. This Court in \nB.V. Sivaiah\n (supra), \nRajendra Kumar Srivastava\n (supra),\n\nShriram Tomar\n (supra), \nSujata Kohli\n (supra) and a catena of other decisions has\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 56 of 84\n\n\fheld that the principles of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ are\n\nconceptually different. Whilst explaining the difference between these two\n\nprinciples, this Court has only gone to the extent of laying down what these\n\nprinciples postulate for the purpose of promotion. In other words, this Court has\n\nonly gone so far as to lay down what is permissible within the four corners of\n\nthese principles and by no stretch of imagination has this Court in any manner\n\nheld that such postulations are stricto-sensu required to be complied with.\n\n98. The various decisions of this Court have only developed upon the\n\nprinciples of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ by explaining the\n\ncriterions that may be postulated within the framework of these principles for the\n\npurpose of promotion. The scope of the aforesaid principles is summarized\n\nbelow: -\n\n I) The principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ postulates that: -\n\n i. Minimum requirement of merit and suitability which is\n necessary for the higher post can be prescribed for the\n purpose of promotion.\n\n ii. Comparative Assessment amongst the candidates is not\n required.\n\n iii. Seniority of a candidate is not a determinative factor for\n promotion but has a predominant role.\n\n iv. Upon fulfilling the minimum qualifications, promotions must\n be based on inter-se seniority.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 57 of 84\n\n\f II) The principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ postulates that: -\n\n i. Merit plays a predominant role in and seniority alone cannot\n be given primacy.\n\n ii. Comparative Assessment of Merit is a crucial, though not a\n mandatory, factor.\n\n iii. Only where merit is equal in all respects can inter-se seniority\n be considered. Meaning that a junior candidate can be\n promoted over the senior if the junior is more meritorious.\n\n99. The underlying reason why the afore-stated postulations ought not be\n\nunderstood as mandatory stems from the very fact that they are not a result of a\n\nlegislative creation, but rather one of judicial interpretation whilst dealing with\n\ndifferent promotion policies, different service conditions, the varied nature and\n\nrequirement of posts and more importantly different sets of rules. Since, these\n\npostulations have been \nlaid down in\n different context and varied facts, it would\n\nbe preposterous to say that such postulations will apply uniformly to all services\n\nand matters of promotion including the judicial services.\n\n100. The principles of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ should\n\nby no means be regarded as rigid or inflexible in nature, otherwise, these judicial\n\nconnotations would effectively assume the character of statutory stipulation laid\n\ndown through various judicial pronouncements and would become applicable to\n\nall types of services, posts and promotions. This would lead to the transgression\n\nby the judiciary into the realms of policy making.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 58 of 84\n\n \n101. This Court in \nLt. Gen. Rajendra Singh Kadyan\n (supra) whilst explaining\n\nthe intricacies between the principles of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-\n\ncum-Merit’ made a pertinent observation that selection for promotion is based on\n\ndifferent criteria depending upon the nature of the post and requirements of\n\nservice, and that such criteria could be said to fall into three categories which\n\ninclude ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’.\n\n102. \nIn \nPalure Bhaskar Rao\n (supra) and \nKavita Kamboj\n (supra) this Court\n\nequated the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ as\n\nmodes or methods of promotion. However, modes of promotion should not be\n\nconflated with modalities of promotion. The expressions ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’\n\nand ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ in service jurisprudence are nothing but principles\n\nwhich are used to broadly categorize policies pertaining to promotions. They only\n\nlay down the broad framework within which specific policies of promotion can\n\nbe elaborately laid down.\n\n103. \nIn \nBhagwandas Tiwari\n (supra) this Court held that where for the purpose\n\nof promotion a high threshold of minimum required marks has been prescribed,\n\nthe same would be an instance of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’, even in the absence of\n\na comparative assessment of merit, thus clearly indicating that these postulations\n\nare not mandatory. As even without an element of comparative merit, the\n\npromotion could be based on ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’, provided that merit is given\n\nprominence over seniority in the promotion process. Therefore, the only factor\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 59 of 84\n\n\fthat sets apart ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ from ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ is whether\n\nemphasis is laid on merit or seniority. All other ancillary factors or postulations\n\nsuch as comparative merit or a minimum specified benchmark may or may not\n\nbe material to these principles.\n\n104. The fluid nature of the principles of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-\n\ncum-Merit’ is further evinced by the decision of this Court in \nK. Samantaray\n\n(supra) wherein although the policy stipulated that promotion would be on the\n\nbasis of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’, yet this Court after going through the elaborate\n\npromotion policy held that a third mode of promotion known as the “Hybrid\n\nMode of Promotion” has come to be recognized by this Court, wherein it is open\n\nfor the employer to specify the area and parameter of weight required to be given\n\nto merit and seniority for the purpose of promotion. It was further held that it is\n\nalways open for the employer or the selection body to decide and stipulate their\n\nown criteria for adjudging the claims on the principles of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’\n\nor ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ depending upon the class, category and nature of post\n\nand the requirements of efficiency.\n\n105. What can be discerned from the aforesaid is that, wherever the expression\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ or ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ has been supplemented by an\n\nelaborate promotion policy or statutory rules clearly indicating the parameters on\n\nwhich promotions are to be made, the mode of promotion assumes the character\n\nof a Hybrid or Dynamic Mode of Promotion as held in \nK. Samantaray\n (supra).\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 60 of 84\n\n\f106. In such scenario, these principles serve as a beacon for the selection body\n\nwhich, in exercise of its delegated legislative powers, can formulate policies and\n\nlay down different criteria and conditions of assessment for the purposes of\n\npromotion. It does so by providing the selection body with the tools for\n\nformulating the promotion policy in the form of the aforementioned postulations\n\nor criteria which are permissible under these principles. Thereafter, the selection\n\nbody can, as a conscious choice, decide the criteria it deems necessary or most\n\nsuitable for the purpose of promotion keeping in mind the nature of the post, the\n\nrequirements of service, etc.\n\n107. For instance, where the promotion is based on ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’, the\n\nselection body may opt for a comparative assessment of merit, more particularly,\n\nin cases where the promotions are competitive in nature or it may say that\n\nseniority should only be considered where merit is equal in all respect if the post\n\nis of such nature that it requires significant knowledge and ability.\n\n108. However, at the same time, this flexibility should not be understood as a\n\ncomplete autonomy. While the statutory rules or, in the absence of the same, the\n\npromotion policy formulated must be followed, they must at the same time have\n\nsome nexus or bearing with the nature of the post and the requirements of service.\n\nFor instance, where the promotion is based on ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and the\n\nnature of promotion allows for superseding a senior, the selection body whilst\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 61 of 84\n\n\fformulating the promotion policy cannot simpliciter as a matter of choice refuse\n\nto provide for assessment of comparative merit, as the promotion herein is by its\n\nnature an accelerated form of promotion and as such comparative assessment\n\nbecomes crucial.\n\n109. The principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ are a\n\nflexible and a fluid concept akin to broad principles within which the actual\n\npromotion policy may be formulated. They are not strict rules or requirements\n\nand by no means can supplant or take the place of statutory rules or policies that\n\nhave been formulated, if any. These principles are dynamic in nature very much\n\nlike a spectrum and their application and ambit depends upon the rules, the policy,\n\nthe nature of the post and the requirements of service. The sketch below illustrates\n\nthe broad spectrum in which these principles operate: -\n\n110. Thus, the principles applicable to promotion such as the principle of\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ can best be described as two\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 62 of 84\n\n\fends of a spectrum. They are broad categories or frameworks for promotion and\n\ndo represent the actual modalities by which promotions are to take place. It is the\n\nrules and the promotion policy, along with the intention of the legislature or the\n\nselection board, as the case may be, that supplements these principles and\n\ndelineates the actual modality of how promotion is to take place. Through these\n\nrules and promotion policy, the legislature or the selection body specifies the area\n\nand the parameters or the weightage which is to be given to the aspect of “Merit”\n\nand “Seniority” on the said spectrum.\n\n111. No doubt while construing the rule of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ or ‘Merit-\n\ncum-Seniority’, some of the observations of the decided cases are not uniform. \nIn\n\nState of Mysore v. C. R. Seshadri & Ors.\n reported in AIR 1974 SC 460, Krishna\n\nIyer, J., held that if the criterion for promotion is one of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’,\n\ncomparative merit may have to be assessed, if length of service is equal or an\n\noutstanding junior is available for promotion.\n\n112. The decision of this Court in \nSujata Kohli\n (supra) has been strongly relied\n\nupon on behalf of the petitioner herein, however the same is of no avail to them,\n\nas in the said case this Court had no occasion to examine the meaning of the\n\nexpression ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ in reference to \nAll India Judges’ Association\n\n(3) (supra).\n \nThis Court in \nSujata Kohli\n (supra) only went so far as to say that\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ means that neither merit can be forsaken nor seniority\n\nalone can be given primacy. ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ only stipulates that a balance\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 63 of 84\n\n\fmust be maintained between ‘Merit’ and ‘Seniority’ with ‘Merit’ playing a more\n\npredominant role in the selection process.\n\n113. Similarly, the decision in \nDr. Kavita Kamboj\n (supra) has also been strongly\n\nrelied upon by the petitioners, but it is of no avail to them, as the limited question\n\nthat was involved in the said case was whether minimum marks could be specified\n\nfor the written exam and the viva voce separately.\n\n114. While laying down the promotion policy or rule, it is always open to the\n\nemployer to specify the area and parameter or the weightage to be given in respect\n\nof merit and seniority separately, so long as the policy is not a colourable exercise\n\nof power, nor has the effect of violating any statutory scope of interference and\n\nother relatable matters. [See \nK. Samantaray\n (supra)]\n\nd. High Court as a custodian of the District Judiciary under \nArticle 235\n\n of the Constitution.\n\n115. We should be mindful of the fact that the High Court by virtue of its power\n\nunder \nArticle 235\n of the Constitution undertook the recruitment process for the\n\npurpose of promotion. The High Court followed the procedure which it had been\n\nfollowing without any departure since 2011. In such circumstances, had the High\n\nCourt departed from the method of promotion which it had been following since\n\n2011, it could have been argued on behalf of the respondents that they had\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 64 of 84\n\n\flegitimate expectation that the High Court would not deviate from the method or\n\nprocess they had been adopting since 2011.\n\n116. \nIn the aforesaid context we may make a reference to \nR. v. Inland Revenue\n\nCommissioners\n, ex parte M.F.K Underwriting Agents Ltd. reported in [1990] 1\n\nW.L.R. 1545 where Lord Justice of Appeal, Thomas Bingham, while invoking\n\nfairness as a rationale for protecting legitimate expectations, expressed the\n\nfollowing: -\n\n “If a public authority so conducts itself as to create a legitimate\n expectation that a certain course will be followed it would often be\n unfair if the authority were permitted to follow a different course to\n the detriment of one who entertained the expectation, particularly if\n he acted on it [...] The doctrine of legitimate expectation is rooted in\n fairness.”\n\n117. \nIn \nMadan Mohan Choudhary v. State of Bihar\n reported in (1999) 3 SCC\n\n396 this Court held that the High Court’s control over the District Judiciary under\n\nArticle 235\n of the Constitution is comprehensive and extends to a variety of\n\nmatters including promotion. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “22. In order to ensure their independence, the control over the\n subordinate courts has been vested in the High Court under \nArticle\n 235 [...]\n\n 23. Under this Article, the High Court's control over the subordinate\n judiciary is comprehensive and extends over a variety of matters,\n including posting, promotion and grant of leave. The three words,\n namely, “posting”, “promotion” and “grant of leave” used in this\n article are only illustrative in character and do not limit the extent of\n control exercised by the High Court over the officers of the\n subordinate judiciary.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 65 of 84\n\n\f xxx xxx xxx\n\n 26. From the scheme of the Constitution, as set out above, it will be\n seen that though the officers of the subordinate judiciary are\n basically and essentially government servants, their whole service is\n placed under the control of the High Court and the Governor cannot\n make any appointment or take any disciplinary action including\n action for removal or compulsory retirement unless the High Court\n is “consulted” as required by the constitutional impact of both the\n \nArticles 233\n and \n234\n and the “control” of the High Court indicated\n in Article 235.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n118. \nIn High Court of Judicature for \nRajasthan v. P.P. Singh & Anr.\n reported\n\nin (2003) 4 SCC 239, it was held that laying down merit criteria for appointment\n\nto selection grade was well within the domain of the High Court under \nArticle\n\n235\n of the Constitution. The relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “18. It is beyond any pale of controversy that the control over the\n subordinate courts within the meaning of \nArticle 235\n of the\n Constitution of India is that of the High Court. Such control of the\n High Court includes general superintendence of the working of the\n subordinate courts, disciplinary control over the presiding officers,\n disciplinary proceedings, transfer, confirmation and promotion and\n appointment etc. Such control vested in the High Court is complete.\n\n [...]\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 24. The submission on behalf of the respondents to the effect that in\n the matter relating to fixation of criteria for the purpose of\n appointment to the selection grade, the two-Judge Committee could\n not be made without consulting all the Judges is stated to be rejected.\n\n The said submission is based on a total misconception. Laying down\n the merit criteria for appointment to the selection grade also was\n within the domain of the High Court. It could not only lay down such\n criteria but also amend or modify the same from time to time. [...]”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 66 of 84\n\n \n119. From the aforesaid discussion, it is clear that when it comes to promotion\n\nof judicial officers of the District Judiciary, the control vests with the High Court\n\nunder \nArticle 235\n of the Constitution. The High Court being the sole authority in\n\nthis regard can clearly lay down rules and policies pertaining to promotions which\n\nincludes the power to specify the criteria and parameters it deems most suitable\n\nand appropriate for the purpose of promotion and the manner in which promotion\n\nis to be made as long as it is within the contours of what has been \nlaid down in\n\nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n \nThus, now the only question that\n\nremains to be considered is, what is the meaning assigned to “Merit-cum-\n\nSeniority” by All India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n\niv. What is ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ for the purpose of Promotion to the\n cadre of District & Sessions Judges?\n\na. Intention behind the decision in All India Judges’ Association (3).\n\n120. The entire controversy revolves around the interpretation of Rule 5(1) of\n\nthe 2005 Rules which provides that 65% of the total posts in the cadre of District\n\n& Sessions Judge shall be filled by promotion on the basis of the principle of\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’.\n\n121. As discussed in the foregoing parts of this judgment, the decision of this\n\nCourt in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra) has laid down the method of\n\nrecruitment to the posts in the Higher Judicial Service, i.e., District Judges and\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 67 of 84\n\n\fAdditional District Judges. Prior to \nthe said decision\n, there were only two sources\n\nfor recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service – first, by promotion from amongst\n\nthe members of the District Judicial Service; and secondly, by direct recruitment\n\nfrom among the members of the Bar.\n\n122. This Court in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra), with a view to\n\nenhance the efficiency of the District judiciary and to create an avenue of\n\naccelerated promotions for the relatively junior members of the service,\n\nintroduced two methods of appointment, one by way of promotion, wherein 50%\n\nof the total posts were to be filled by promotion on the basis of the principle of\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ through a test assessing the continued efficiency and\n\nadequate knowledge of case-law of the judicial officers, and the remaining 25%\n\nof the posts were to be filled up by promotions strictly on the basis of merit\n\nthrough the limited departmental competitive examination. At the cost of\n\nrepetition, the relevant observations read as under: -\n\n “27. At the same time, we are of the opinion that there has to be\n certain minimum standard, objectively adjudged, for officers who are\n to enter the Higher Judicial Service as Additional District Judges and\n District Judges. While we agree with the Shetty Commission that the\n recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service i.e. the District Judge\n cadre from amongst the advocates should be 25 per cent and the\n process of recruitment is to be by a competitive examination, both\n written and viva voce, we are of the opinion that there should be an\n objective method of testing the suitability of the subordinate judicial\n officers for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service. Furthermore,\n there should also be an incentive amongst the relatively junior and\n other officers to improve and to compete with each other so as to\n excel and get quicker promotion. In this way, we expect that the\n calibre of the members of the Higher Judicial Service will further\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 68 of 84\n\n\f improve. In order to achieve this, while the ratio of 75 per cent\n appointment by promotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to\n the Higher Judicial Service is maintained, we are, however, of the\n opinion that there should be two methods as far as appointment by\n promotion is concerned : 50 per cent of the total posts in the Higher\n Judicial Service must be filled by promotion on the basis of principle\n of merit-cum-seniority. For this purpose, the High Courts should\n devise and evolve a test in order to ascertain and examine the legal\n knowledge of those candidates and to assess their continued\n efficiency with adequate knowledge of case-law. The remaining 25\n per cent of the posts in the service shall be filled by promotion strictly\n on the basis of merit through the limited departmental competitive\n examination for which the qualifying service as a Civil Judge (Senior\n Division) should be not less than five years. The High Courts will\n have to frame a rule in this regard.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n123. The expressions \"certain minimum standard, objectively adjudged\" and \"in\n\norder to ascertain the legal knowledge of those candidates and to assess their\n\ncontinued efficiency with adequate knowledge of case law\" in \nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation\n (3) (supra) clearly indicate that the intention was to test each\n\ncandidate on their own merit as this Court never mandated that a comparative\n\nassessment of merit was also required. In other words, what is stipulated is the\n\ndetermination of suitability of the candidates and assessment of their efficiency\n\nbased on whether they possess adequate knowledge of case law. It goes without\n\nsaying that some standards of suitability and efficiency for continued service is\n\nrequired. The High Court may deny promotion to a Civil Judge (Senior Division)\n\nonly in case the candidate is not suitable for being promoted to the post of District\n\n& Sessions Judge. It was never the intention of this Court that after taking the\n\nsuitability test, a list should be prepared based on inter-se merit and the judicial\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 69 of 84\n\n\fofficers should be promoted only if they fall in the said merit list. It cannot be\n\nsaid to be a competitive exam. Only the suitability of the judicial officer is to be\n\nassessed and once it is found that the candidate has secured the requisite marks\n\nin the suitability test, they cannot be thereafter ignored for promotion.\n\n124. The first change brought around was the introduction of a mandatory\n\nassessment of the suitability of the members of the District Judicial Service before\n\npromoting them to the Higher Judicial Service. The concept of assessment of\n\nsuitability was introduced to ensure that a certain minimum standard is\n\nmaintained in the Higher Judicial Service. The method of devising a suitability\n\ntest for this purpose was left to the respective High Courts. However, broad\n\nguiding principles were \nlaid down by\n this Court on the contours of the suitability\n\ntest. It was directed that the suitability test must objectively test the following: -\n\n a. Whether the candidate possesses legal knowledge?\n\n b. Whether the candidate has displayed continued efficiency during\n\n his tenure in the feeder cadre?\n\n c. Whether the candidate possesses adequate knowledge of case law?\n\n125. The second change introduced by the aforesaid decision was the creation\n\nof a third category of recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service. While the\n\nallocation of seats for direct recruitment from the members of the Bar was kept\n\nat 25% of the total posts in the Higher Judicial Service, the erstwhile promotional\n\ncategory was split up into two categories – firstly, 50% of the posts in the Higher\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 70 of 84\n\n\fJudicial Service were directed to be filled by promotion on the basis of ‘Merit-\n\ncum-Seniority’; and secondly, the remaining 25% of the seats were directed to be\n\nfilled by promotion strictly on the basis of merit, through a limited departmental\n\ncompetitive examination.\n\n126. We are of the view that the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ stipulated\n\nin Rule 5(1) of the 2005 Rules should be understood in accordance with what has\n\nbeen observed by this Court in paragraphs 27 & 28 respectively of \nAll India\n\nJudges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n\n127. It is amply clear from the aforesaid decision that this Court intended to\n\nachieve two-fold objectives –\n\n(i) First, to ensure that unlike the traditional promotion policy under which\n\n seniority alone was considered for promotion, a new policy should be\n\n devised under which seniority would be considered for promotion, but only\n\n for those candidates who possessed the minimum necessary standard of\n\n suitability for the post, and;\n\n(ii) Secondly, to prevent loss of motivation amongst the relatively junior\n\n members of the service, a third category for promotion to the Higher\n\n Judicial Service should be created, wherein promotions would be given\n\n strictly on the basis merit, to be ascertained through a limited departmental\n\n competitive examination.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 71 of 84\n\n\f128. Thus, while the comparison of inter-se merit to determine the most\n\nmeritorious candidates was the procedure to be adopted for filling up the seats\n\nunder the newly created category, it was never the intention of this Court in the\n\naforesaid decision to mandate the comparative assessment of merit in the category\n\nof regular promotions based on seniority. The only additional requirement which\n\nwas provided for by the aforesaid decision for this category of candidates was the\n\npossession of certain minimum objectively determinable standard of suitability.\n\nAs long as a candidate possesses this standard of suitability, it cannot be said that\n\nthis Court intended, by the aforesaid decision, to subject such a candidate to a\n\nmandatory comparative merit assessment akin to the limited departmental\n\ncompetitive examination and disregard the seniority of such a candidate to prefer\n\nthose candidates who may have scored a few marks more than him in the\n\nsuitability test.\n\n129. The objective sought to be achieved by the introduction of a suitability test\n\nin the regular promotional category was limited to the assessment of a minimum\n\nstandard of suitability. It would be incorrect to say that the marks scored by a\n\ncandidate in the suitability test are proportional to the merit of the candidate. This\n\ncan be understood with the aid of an illustration – take a case wherein the\n\nminimum marks required to be obtained in the suitability test is ‘x’; then for the\n\npurpose of 65% promotional quota, as soon as a candidate obtains ‘x’ marks in\n\nthe suitability test, such a candidate becomes eligible for being considered for\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 72 of 84\n\n\fpromotion in that category subject to their seniority vis-à-vis the other suitable\n\ncandidates. It cannot be said that a candidate who obtains (x + 10) marks is more\n\nmeritorious or more suitable than those candidates who obtain ‘x’ or (x + 5) marks\n\nin the suitability test. Every candidate who scores higher than or equal to ‘x’\n\nmarks in the suitability test is considered equally suitable and equally meritorious\n\nfor the purpose of 65% promotional category.\n\n130. We have discussed in detail in the foregoing paragraphs that the concepts\n\nof ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ or ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’ are flexible in nature and do\n\nnot prescribe any fixed or strait-jacket definitions. These definitions take\n\ncharacter and substance from the context in which they are employed. Their full\n\nimport and nuances only become visible when they are exposed to the guiding\n\nlight of the overall promotional policy of the organisation. The concept of\n\npromotions in the District Judiciary is a peculiar one, and one that must be\n\nanalysed in its own unique context. Unlike most cases on promotions decided by\n\nthis Court where the interpretation or incorrect implementation of the promotion\n\npolicy contained in a statute have been in question, the present case of promotions\n\nto the Higher Judicial Service is one in which the statutory framework itself was\n\ncreated after the decision in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra). Thus, any\n\ndispute arising out of the respective rules of promotions of different States/Union\n\nTerritories as devised by their respective High Courts must be construed in the\n\ncontext of various decisions which have ultimately shaped such rules.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 73 of 84\n\n \n131. How ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ will apply to promotions within an\n\norganization will ultimately depend on the statutory rules, if any, or the\n\npromotional policy of such an organisation. We have discussed in detail in the\n\npreceding paragraphs that the objective of this Court in \nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation\n (3) (supra) was to create a new category for accelerated promotions\n\nand to introduce a test to ascertain the suitability of candidates in the regular\n\npromotional category. While the newly created category was strictly based on\n\nmerit, the due weightage on seniority in the regular promotional category was not\n\ndiluted in any manner except for the introduction of the suitability test. We are\n\naware that in a number of decisions of this Court, the term ‘merit’ has been\n\ninfused with a competitive and comparative character, however, we are of the\n\nopinion that whether the term ‘merit’ includes a comparative element can only be\n\nascertained from the context in which it is employed and not in isolation from it.\n\nMerit only indicates an assessment of qualities which are relevant for the post. It\n\nis not synonymous to scores in the competitive examination. Competitive\n\nexaminations are merely one of the many ways in which the merit of the candidate\n\nis determined.\n \nThis Court in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra) notes that\n\nmerit must be determined based on a limited competitive examination with\n\nrespect to the 25% (now 10%) of the seats which are to be filled by merit. Thus,\n\nthis Court clarifies that merit in the context of the 25% (now 10%) of the seats\n\nmust be determined through the competitive examination while for the 50% (now\n\n65%) of the seats must be determined based on an assessment of specific\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 74 of 84\n\n\fsuitability parameters. Whether the idea of a ‘minimum threshold merit’ would\n\nbe antithetical to the concept of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ would again depend on\n\nthe context and the manner in which the minimum threshold is applied.\n\n132. The term ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ in context of 2005 Rules implies that both\n\nmerit and seniority would be considered in the promotion of a candidate, with\n\nmerit being determined on the basis of a suitability test. The exact modalities of\n\nhow merit and seniority are to be apportioned is a legislative function and is to be\n\nperformed keeping in mind the unique requirements and circumstances of the\n\norganization. \nIn the present case, the merit of a candidate is assessed by means of\n\na suitability test, as prescribed under paragraph 27 of the decision in \nAll India\n\nJudges’ Association\n (3) (supra).\n\n133. The contours of the words ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ are drawn by this Court\n\nin the lines immediately following these words. The phrase “for this purpose”, as\n\nit appears in paragraph 27 of the aforesaid decision, acts as a bridge between the\n\nwords – “Merit-cum-Seniority” – their substance. For the purpose of 65%\n\npromotional quota, this Court, in the said paragraph, has defined “merit” as the\n\npossession of a minimum standard, or suitability. This Court deliberately did not\n\nimpart any competitive or comparative character to the term and such intention\n\nshould be kept in mind while interpreting the term ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ for the\n\npurpose of the 65% promotional quota.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 75 of 84\n\n\f134. The suitability test assesses multiple aspects of a candidate’s merit like\n\nknowledge of law, quality of judgments, ACRs, etc. along with the efficiency of\n\nthe candidate exhibited during the tenure already served. The suitability test is\n\ndevised in such a manner that all candidates who clear the test can be said to\n\npossess more or less the same level of merit. Once a list of all similarly\n\nmeritorious candidates is prepared, seniority is applied to select the candidates\n\nfor promotion. Although seniority is applied at the last stage of the selection\n\nprocess, yet merit still plays the pre-dominant role as a candidate who does not\n\npossess the necessary suitability becomes ineligible for promotion irrespective of\n\ntheir seniority.\n\n135. We are of the view that it would be incorrect to hold that merely because\n\nthe test was not one of comparative merit and as seniority was applied at the final\n\nstage of the selection process, the process cannot be said to be one not adhering\n\nto the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’. As long as ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ is\n\napplied in the manner it has been explained in the decision in \nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation\n (3) (supra), wherein both merit and seniority are considered, and\n\nmerit plays the dominant role, the process of promotion cannot be said to be\n\nviolative of the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’. The expressions used in the\n\nrules should be interpreted bearing in mind the principles enunciated in the\n\naforesaid decision, and not on the basis of the various decisions of this Court that\n\nhave been decided in entirely different factual situations. Further, if the principle\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 76 of 84\n\n\fof ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ is applied as argued by the petitioners, there would\n\nnecessarily be no difference between the categories of ‘merit’ (10%) and ‘Merit-\n\ncum-Seniority’ (65%). It must be noted that the minimum qualifying service for\n\nthe 65% category according to the 2005 Rules is two-years while that for the 10%\n\ncategory is five-years. Thus, appointment to the former category given the lesser\n\nyears of minimum service allows relatively junior candidates to supersede the\n\nsenior candidates based on the suitability test. Thus, while candidates who have\n\ntwo to five years of service will not be eligible to apply for promotion for the 10%\n\npromotional quota, they may still have the opportunity to apply and be considered\n\nfor the 65% quota based on securing a minimum of 40% (and 50% aggregate) in\n\neach of the following indicators which measures the merit of the candidate:\n\nsuitability test, evaluation of ACR, assessment of average disposal and evaluation\n\nof judgments. Thus, it is beyond any doubt that the criteria prescribed for\n\npromotion of candidates to the 65% promotional quota complies with the\n\nprinciple of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’.\n\n136. Words used in a judgment are not to be read as words of a statute, but\n\nshould be understood in the context of the facts of a given case. (See \nAmbica\n\nQuarry Works v. State of Gujarat\n, (1987) 1 SCC 213; \nBharat Petroleum\n\nCorporation Ltd. v. NR Vairamani\n, (\n2004) 8 SCC 579, Municipal Corporation\n\nDelhi v. Mohd Yasin\n, (1983) 3 SCC 229). The attempt on the part of the\n\npetitioners is to persuade us to take the view that the connotation ‘Merit-cum-\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 77 of 84\n\n\fSeniority’ as figuring in the 2005 Rules, should be strictly understood as all merit\n\nand no seniority. This is not correct to our understanding.\n \nSuch attempt must\n\nnecessarily fail as the words “Merit-cum-Seniority” as they figure in the 2005\n\nRules read in conjunction with paragraphs 27 and 28 respectively of \nAll India\n\nJudges’ Association\n (3) (supra), should be interpreted in the context in which\n\nthey have been used by this Court – which we have discussed elaborately in the\n\nforegoing paragraphs.\n\n137. The petitioners have relied on the decision of this Court in \nThampanoor\n\nRavi v. Charupara Ravi\n reported in (1999) 8 SCC 74 to contend that the term\n\n“Merit-cum-Seniority” has acquired a technical meaning and thus, should be\n\ngiven the meaning which is used ordinarily in relation to it. The relevant passage\n\nfrom \nthe said decision\n is extracted here: -\n\n “22. In ascertaining the meaning of an expression used in a statute,\n certain norms are adopted. If the legislature has used an expression\n which has acquired a technical meaning and such expression is used\n ordinarily in the context of a particular branch of law, it must be\n assumed that because of its constant use the legislature must be\n deemed to have used such expression in a particular sense as is\n understood when used in a similar context. If an expression has\n acquired a special connotation in law, dictionary or general meaning\n ceases to be helpful in interpreting such a word. Such an expression\n must be given its legal sense and no other. \nIn this context, we may\n refer to the weighty observation in the decision of this Court in \nState\n of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd.\n [AIR 1958 SC\n 560 : 1959 SCR 379] that a term of well-recognised import in the\n general law should be accepted as confining the meaning in\n interpreting the Constitution. If the expression “undischarged\n insolvent” has acquired a special meaning under the law of\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 78 of 84\n\n\f insolvency, we must understand that that is the meaning that is sought\n to be attributed to the expression used in \nArticle 191(1)(c)\n of the\n Constitution.”\n\n138. The aforesaid contention of the petitioner deserves to be rejected for two\n\ngood reasons: -\n\n(1) First, the observations in the said case have been made in the context of a\n\n technical meaning used in a statute. In the present case, the term ‘Merit-\n\n \ncum-Seniority’ as it appears in the 2005 Rules has been imported verbatim\n\n from the decision in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra) and thus has\n\n to be assigned the meaning as given to it in the said case. Thus, it cannot\n\n be said that ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ should be assigned the same meaning\n\n as understood in other decisions of this Court, or as assigned to it in\n\n different statutory provisions.\n\n(2) Secondly, the term ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’, as elaborately discussed\n\n hereinabove, is a term of flexible meaning and the exact contours of it\n\n depend on the context and the policy in furtherance of which it is used.\n\n139. \nIn \nMalik Mazhar Sultan & Anr.\n (3) (supra) this Court directed the High\n\nCourts to be practical in matters of promotion to the cadre of District & Sessions\n\nJudges and held that the 65% promotion quota of the cadre of District & Sessions\n\nJudges should be filled on the basis of the principle of ‘Seniority-cum-Merit’.\n\nThis \nCourt further held\n that seniority should have a predominant role in giving\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 79 of 84\n\n\fpromotions to Civil Judge (Senior Division) and that the High Court may deny\n\nonly in case the judicial officer is not suitable for being promoted. The relevant\n\nobservations read as under: -\n\n “3. We see large number of vacancies of District Judges are lying\n vacant as the promotion of these posts are not being done timely by\n the High Court. Considering the large number of vacant posts of\n District Judges, the High Court should take timely action to fill up\n these vacancies keeping in mind the principle of seniority-cum-merit.\n The High Court may deny promotion to a Civil Judge (Senior\n Division) only in case he/she is not suitable for being promoted and\n the seniority should always have a predominant role in giving\n promotion to the Civil Judge (Senior Division) to the post of District\n Judge. If the posts of District Judges are not filled up in time it is\n likely that sessions cases may not have timely trial, thereby delaying\n the whole procedure of justice delivery system. We request the High\n Court to be practical in the matter of promotion and filling up the\n posts of the District Judges. It is also brought to our notice that as the\n promotion policy itself is not working properly, a large number of\n Civil Judges (Junior Division) are continuing in the same post,\n causing stagnation from about 15 to 18 years. This is because the\n timely promotion is not being taken care of by the High Court and\n this should be corrected at the earliest. Now we are told that a total\n number of 217 posts have been advertised for appointment of Civil\n Judges (Junior Division) and 12 posts of District Judges (direct).”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nH. FEW SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE THE SUITABILITY TEST MORE\n\n MEANINGFUL\n\n140. We have exhaustively discussed and explained the true meaning to be\n\nassigned to the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ in context of Rule 5(1) of the\n\n2005 Rules. However, we are of the view that this debate should not come to an\n\nend as we propose to convey to the High Court of Gujarat to amend its Rules\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 80 of 84\n\n\fappropriately in line with the Uttar Pradesh Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975\n\nwhere the recruitment process has been elaboratively laid down. We are also of\n\nthe view that the minimum standard to be objectively assessed by way of a\n\nsuitability test should be made more efficacious and productive. In this regard,\n\nwe would like to suggest the following: -\n\n(i) Apart from the four components included in the Suitability Test, an\n additional fifth component in the form of an Interview or Viva Voce should\n also be included in order to assess the ability and knowledge of the\n candidates.\n\n(ii) The High Court may consider enhancing the minimum specified threshold\n of marks as prescribed in the suitability test and each of its component.\n\n(iii) The evaluation of judgments delivered by the judicial officer being\n considered for promotion should be of the last two years instead of one\n year.\n\n(iv) Instead of seniority being considered at the very last stage of the process,\n some marks may be allocated for seniority at the stage of suitability test\n and thereafter, the final select list may be prepared on the basis of total\n marks.\n\nI. CONCLUSION\n\n141. We summarise our final conclusion as under: -\n\n(A) What has been conveyed, in so many words, by this Court in \nAll India\n\n Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra) is that the suitability of each candidate\n\n should be tested on their own merit. The aforesaid decision does not speak\n\n about comparative merit for the 65% promotional quota. In other words, what\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 81 of 84\n\n\f is stipulated is the determination of suitability of the candidates and\n\n assessment of their continued efficiency with adequate knowledge of case\n\n law.\n\n(B) For the 65% promotional quota this Court in \nAll India Judges’ Association\n\n (3) (supra) did not state that after taking the suitability test, a merit list should\n\n be prepared and the judicial officers should be promoted only if they fall in\n\n the said merit list. It cannot be said to be a competitive exam. Only the\n\n suitability of the judicial officer is determined and once it is found that\n\n candidates have secured the requisite marks in the suitability test, they cannot\n\n be thereafter ignored for promotion.\n\n(C) However, we clarify that for the 65% promotional quota, it is for a particular\n\n High Court to prescribe or lay down its own minimum standard to judge the\n\n suitability of a judicial officer, including the requirement of comparative\n\n assessment, if necessary, for the purpose of determining merit to be\n\n objectively adjudged keeping in mind the statutory rules governing the\n\n promotion or any promotion policy in that regard.\n\n(D) We find no fault with the promotion process adopted by the High Court of\n\n Gujarat as the same fulfils the twin requirements stipulated in paragraph 27\n\n of \nAll India Judges’ Association\n (3) (supra) being: -\n\n (I) The objective assessment of legal knowledge of the judicial officer\n\n including adequate knowledge of case law and;\n\n (II) Evaluation of the continued efficiency of the individual candidates.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 82 of 84\n\n\f(E) The four components of the Suitability Test as prescribed under the\n\n recruitment notice dated 12.04.2022 comprehensively evaluate (i) the legal\n\n knowledge including knowledge of the case law through the objective MCQ\n\n - based written test AND (ii) the continued efficiency by evaluation of the\n\n ACRs, average disposal and past judgments of the concerned judicial officer.\n\n(F) We are of the view that if the contention of the petitioners were to be accepted\n\n then it would completely obliterate the fine distinction between the two\n\n categories of promotion in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge by way of\n\n 65% promotion on the basis of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ and 10% promotion\n\n strictly on the basis of merit. In other words, the 65% quota for promotion\n\n will assume the character of the 10% quota for promotion by way of a\n\n departmental competitive examination which is distinct in its nature since the\n\n latter is strictly based on merit.\n\n(G) Deviating from the process of promotion duly followed by the High Court of\n\n Gujarat since 2011 would cause grave prejudice to those judicial officers who\n\n lost out in the previous selections to the Higher Judicial Service despite\n\n having scored higher marks in the suitability test since, judicial officers who\n\n were relatively senior were promoted to the cadre of District & Sessions\n\n Judges. Accepting the argument of the petitioners would completely flip the\n\n process and displace the respondents once again, for a contrary reason.\n\nWrit Petition (C) No. 432 of 2023 Page 83 of 84\n\n\f142. We clarify that this judgment shall not be construed to invalidate the\n\npromotions to the Higher Judicial Service granted by other High Courts based on\n\na construction of their own rules and requirements of service in the state judiciary.\n\nIf any challenge to such promotion process is pending, it shall be dealt with\n\nindependently by the High Court or the forum where any issue is pending.\n\n143. For all the foregoing reasons, we have reached the conclusion that the\n\nimpugned final Select List dated 10.03.2023 is not contrary to the principle of\n\n‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules.\n\n144. In the result, the present petition fails and is hereby dismissed. Interim\n\nOrder granted earlier stands vacated.\n\n145. The parties shall bear their own costs.\n\n146. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.\n\n ...................................................... CJI.\n (Dr. Dhananjaya Y.

Another question which falls for consideration is the method of\n recruitment to the posts in the cadre of Higher Judicial Service i.e.\n District Judges and Additional District Judges. At the present\n moment, there are two sources for recruitment to the Higher Judicial\n Service, namely, by promotion from amongst the members of the\n Subordinate Judicial Service and by direct recruitment. The\n subordinate judiciary is the foundation of the edifice of the judicial\n system. It is, therefore, imperative, like any other foundation, that it\n should become as strong as possible. The weight on the judicial\n system essentially rests on the subordinate judiciary. While we have\n accepted the recommendation of the Shetty Commission which will\n result in the increase in the pay scales of the subordinate judiciary,\n it is at the same time necessary that the judicial officers, hard-\n working as they are, become more efficient. It is imperative that they\n keep abreast of knowledge of law and the latest pronouncements, and\n it is for this reason that the Shetty Commission has recommended the\n establishment of a Judicial Academy, which is very necessary. At the\n same time, we are of the opinion that there has to be certain minimum\n standard, objectively adjudged, for officers who are to enter the\n Higher Judicial Service as Additional District Judges and District\n Judges. While we agree with the Shetty Commission that the\n recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service i.e. the District Judge\n cadre from amongst the advocates should be 25 per cent and the\n process of recruitment is to be by a competitive examination, both\n written and viva voce, we are of the opinion that there should be an\n objective method of testing the suitability of the subordinate judicial\n officers for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service. Furthermore,"

In order to achieve this, while the ratio of 75 per cent\n appointment by promotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to\n the Higher Judicial Service is maintained, we are, however, of the\n opinion that there should be two methods as far as appointment by\n promotion is concerned : 50 per cent of the total posts in the Higher\n Judicial Service must be filled by promotion on the basis of principle\n of merit-cum-seniority. For this purpose, the High Courts should\n devise and evolve a test in order to ascertain and examine the legal\n knowledge of those candidates and to assess their continued\n efficiency with adequate knowledge of case-law. The remaining 25\n per cent of the posts in the service shall be filled by promotion strictly\n on the basis of merit through the limited departmental competitive\n examination for which the qualifying service as a Civil Judge (Senior\n Division) should be not less than five years.
