Joshy)\n\n This application having been heard on 20.09.12, the Tribunal on 09.10.12\n\ndelivered the following :\n\n O R D E R\n\nHON'BLE MR. K GEORGE JOSEPH, ADMINISTRATIVE MEMBER\n\n The applicant is a Chief Travelling Ticket Inspector (CTTI) in PB-2 with\n\nGrade Pay of Rs. 4600/- at the Trivandrum Railway Station of the Southern\n\f\nRailway. He commenced service as Ticket Collector on 18.08.1972. For\n\nGroup-B selection (70% quota), Group-C employees working in PB-2 with GP\n\nof Rs. 4200/- and above with 3 years non-fortuitous service in the grade are\n\neligible. An integrated seniority list of all eligible candidates belonging to the\n\ndifferent seniority units forming the feeder cadre is to be published division\n\nwise for promotion to Group-B service of Commercial Department of Southern\n\nRailway. Annexure A-2 notification dated 15.12.2010 with an integrated list of\n\neligible staff coming within the zone of consideration and a standby list for\n\nselection through a written test and viva voce test was for filling up of 06\n\nvacancies (UR-05, SC-01 and ST-Nil) of Assistant Commercial Manager\n\n(ACM) against 70% quota in the Commercial Department. The applicant had\n\nchallenged the same before this Tribunal in O.A. No. 51/2011 which became\n\ninfructuous as none of the 24 candidates could obtain the qualifying marks in\n\nthe written examination. 60 employees, all SC/ST employees, except 05\n\nbelonging to the general category, were alerted for promotion to 08 vacancies\n\n(UR-06, SC-01, ST-01) in the cadre of ACM (Group-B) vide notification dated\n\n25.01.2012 at Annexure A-1. Challenging the Annexure A-1 notification , the\n\napplicant has filed this O.A. for the following reliefs:\n\n (i) Call for the records leading to the issue of Annexure A1\n notification No. P(G)532/11/ACM/70%(Regular) dated\n 25.01.2012 and quash the same;\n\n (ii)Declare that Annexure A-14 Railway Board Order bearing RBE\n No. 33/02 dated 08.03.2002 is arbitrary, discriminatory and\n unconstitutional and quash the same;\n\n (iii)Direct the respondents - Railway Administration to prepare and\n circulate an integrated seniority list of all the eligible employees\n of the Commercial Department, as done in Annexures A6 and A7\n and that too after complying with the principles in Annexure A-10\n at every step and circulate it among the employees for objections\n if any, and finalise the seniority list before conducting selection\n for promotion to the post of Assistant Commercial Manager in\n Group-B Service in the Commercial Department;\n\n (iv)Direct the respondents to consider the applicant also for\n promotion to the post of Assistant Commercial Manager against\n the vacancies notified in Annexure A1 and direct further to grant\n the consequential benefits thereof;\n\n (v)Award costs of and incidental to this application;\n\n (vi)Pass such other orders or directions as deemed just, fit and\n necessary in the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The applicant submitted that when different streams of employees from\n\ndifferent categories and units merge together for selection for promotion, an\n\nintegrated seniority list of all the categories of staff eligible to compete would\n\ninevitably be prepared first. From that seniority list only, the zone of\n\nconsideration could be determined. In the absence of an integrated seniority\n\nlist of all the eligible staff of the different categories of employees, viz.\n\nCommercial Clerks, Ticket Checking Staff, ECRC, Office Clerk of the\n\nCommercial Department finalised after calling for objections, the purported\n\naction of the respondents for selection to the post of ACM as per Annexure\n\nA-1 notification is illegal and unsustainable. The list of employees enclosed in\n\nAnnexure A-1 is not an integrated seniority list, but only a list of persons from\n\nthe seniority lists which were erroneously prepared against various\n\njudgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nUnion of India vs. Virpal Singh\n\nChauhan and Ors.\n (\n1995 (6) SCC 684), Ajit Singh Januja and Ors. vs. State of\n\nPunjab and Others\n (1996 (2) SCC 715), Ajit Singh and Others (II) vs. State of\n\nPunjab and Others (1999 (7) SCC 209), Ramprasad and Others vs. D.K. Vijay\n\nand Ors. (1999 (\n7) SCC 251 and Suraj Bhan Meena and Another vs. State of\n\nRajasthan and Others\n (2011 (1) SCC (L&S) 01) and the order of this Tribunal\n\nin O.A.No. 18/2001 (K.M. Geevarghese and Another vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers). Not a single person from the general category is included in the main\n\f\nlist. \nArticle 16 (4A)\n of the Constitution is only a provision enabling the State\n\nto make any provision for reservation in the matter of promotion with or without\n\nconsequential seniority to any class or vacancies in services under the State.\n\nNo reservation can be made for SC/ST in the matter of promotion without\n\ncollecting the quantifiable data showing the backwardness and inadequacy of\n\nrepresentation in the Railway service. Further, compliance with the provision\n\nof \nArticle 335\n which stipulates the requirement of maintaining efficiency in\n\nadministration is to be made. The Railway has not so far done this exercise.\n\nAnnexure A-1 notification and Annexure A-14 Railway Board order are issued\n\nwithout the aforesaid pre-condition as laid down under \nArticle 16(4A)\n and \n16\n\n(4B)\n of the Constitution of India in view of the decisions in \nM. Nagraj and\n\nOthers vs. Union of India and Others\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212, and in \nSuraj Bhan\n\nMeena and Another vs. State of Rajasthan and Others\n (supra) and in the order\n\ndated 02.12.2010 in O.A. No. 2211/2008, \nAll India Equality Form and Others\n\nvs. Union of India and Others\n, of the Principal Bench of the CAT. Those who\n\nare included in Annexure A-1 are the persons who were already included in\n\nAnnexure A-2 and found unqualified as evident by Annexure A-4. They have\n\nno right to be considered again in the very same vacancies on the very same\n\nyear. The failure on the part of the respondents to prepare and finalise the\n\nseniority/eligibility list according to the principles contained in para 319(A) of\n\nAnnexure A-10 Railway Board order read with Annexure A-11 before initiating\n\nthe process of selection is arbitrary and discriminatory. Even if seniority is\n\ngiven to the SC/ST candidates, it cannot be considered for promotion against\n\nthe general category vacancies. Shri R. Hariharan who is included in the\n\nstandby list was appointed in the entry grade 4 years later than the applicant.\n\n3. The respondents in their reply statement submitted that there is no\n\nconnection between the cadre seniority maintained in the division and the inter\n\nse seniority. The integrated seniority is not a regular seniority. It is made for\n\nthe purpose of selection from the available and eligible employees in the\n\nrelevant cadres of Commercial Department. The lists of eligible employees\n\nare maintained at all divisions. An inter se seniority list pertaining to the\n\ndivision is forwarded for further amalgamation at the Headquarter to arrive at\n\nthe required integrated seniority list comprising of the cadres of all divisions to\n\ndetermine the zone of consideration for selection as per para 203.4 of IREM\n\nVol.1. The Railway Board order bearing No. RBE 33/2002 dated 08.03.2002\n\nis a policy matter. The policy decision is based on the constitutional\n\namendment to negate the effect of para 319(A) of the IREM and to grant\n\nconsequential seniority to the SC/ST employees on their promotion by virtue\n\nof rule of reservation. Seniority based on the date of entry into the relevant\n\ngrade is the criterion for determining the zone of consideration. The date of\n\nentry of the applicant into the grade of RS. 6500-10000 (pre-revised) is\n\n01.03.1993 whereas that of Shri R. Hariharan is 07.09.1990. Preparing an\n\nintegrated seniority list of all the eligible candidates belonging to the different\n\nseniority units forming the feeder cadre for promotion is not necessary and\n\nrelevant to the issue in question as the applicant is not senior enough to be\n\ncalled for selection in terms of para 203.4 and 203.5 of the IREM. The names\n\nlisted in the main and standby lists are the integrated seniority list as that of\n\nAnnexures A-6 and A-7 to the extent required. The applicant has never\n\nchallenged the original seniority list of Ticket checking cadre all these years\n\nnor against the promotion of Shri R. Hariharan ahead of him at any point of\n\ntime. All Railway employees irrespective of their community, on their\n\f\npromotion from one grade to another will have consequential seniority from\n\nthe date of entry into the promoted grade. \nThe Railway Board based on the\n\n85th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2001, vide letter dated 08.03.2002 had\n\nrestored the old seniority rules. There is no excess representation of reserved\n\ncandidates in the cadre of Ticket Checking Staff prior to 10.02.1995 also as\n\nper the report submitted by a High Level Committee. Those SC/ST employees\n\npromoted on their own merit and seniority against unreserved points and not\n\nowing to reservation shall not be treated as roster point promotees. The\n\njudgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSuraj Bhan Meena\n's case is not\n\napplicable to the present case as it pertains to the service rules of Rajasthan\n\nGovernment and not the Central Government policies. The order dated\n\n02.12.2010 in O.A. No. 2211/2008 is challenged before the Hon'ble High Court\n\nof Delhi in W.P.(C) Nos. 1974/2011 and 2280/2011 and the same is pending\n\nfor adjudication. As the Hon'ble Supreme Court has declared the validity of\n\n77th and 85th amendments to the Constitution of India, the Railway Board\n\ncircular dated 08.03.2002 was issued reverting the provisions after issuance of\n\nthe circular dated 28.021997.\n \nThe applicant had neither agitated against the\n\njudgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nNagraj\n's case nor the 77th and 85th\n\namendments nor impleaded affected parties. The conditions stipulated in the\n\ncase of Ajit Singh-II have already been complied with and no excess promotion\n\nhas been made since 1984 over and above the prescribed percentage.\n\nTherefore, there is no necessity to revise the seniority as per Railway Board\n\nletter dated 28.02.1997. As long as the Constitution which governs the\n\nassignment of seniority has not been challenged, the seniority which was\n\nassigned on implementation of such constitutional amendments cannot be\n\nquestioned.\n\n4. In the rejoinder statement filed by the applicant, it was submitted that the\n\ncontention of the respondents that the seniority of all the eligible employees\n\nare not required to be published as has been done in all other departments, is\n\nnot substantiated by indicating any rule or order. The question whether the\n\napplicant is senior or not can be considered only if the respondents publish\n\nthe integrated seniority of all the eligible candidates. Without publishing the\n\nsame, the respondents cannot say that the applicant is not senior enough to\n\nbe considered for promotion. The very list at Annexure A-1 would show that\n\nthere has been an exorbitantly excess representation of the members of the\n\nSC and ST. The order dated 08.03.2002, being the policy of the Railway\n\nBoard, is under challenge. Therefore, the necessity to implead any private\n\nperson does not arise.\n\n5. In the reply to the rejoinder, the respondents submitted that the applicant\n\nbeing junior to those alerted in the final stage, the integrated list of entire lot\n\nrunning to more than 500 employees is not required for the present selection\n\nas there are only 08 posts to be filled up. The present list as per Annexure R-\n\n1 dated 10.07.2012 includes 3 URs besides SC/ST employees as also 15 new\n\nemployees. They are not the same group of persons except (9), who are\n\nseniors as can be seen from Annexure R-4 selection notification dated\n\n10.02.2011. In terms of the instructions contained in Annexure R-3 RBE No.\n\n46/2010, the inter se seniority to meet the requirement for selection on hand\n\nhas been prepared. The Annexures A-6 and A-7 issued for Engineering and\n\nMechanical departments' Group-B selection were huge for the reason that\n\nthere were a large number of vacancies. They were not prepared as per the\n\f\ninstructions contained in Annexure A-10, which is no more available as it has\n\nbeen withdrawn. According to \nArticle 141\n of the Constitution of India, the\n\nstatus of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is \"declared law\" of the\n\nland. The 85th amendment was upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nNagraj\n's case. It, being the declared law, is binding on all the lower Courts in\n\nthe Country.\n \nWithout challenging the implementation of the 85th amendment or\n\nchallenging the judgement in \nNagraj\n's case, the applicant has no right to\n\nchallenge the seniority assignment as per the existing rules and provisions\n\nconfirmed by the 85th amendment and approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nin Nagaraj's case. As per RBE No. 33/2002 dated 08.03.2002, if any\n\nunreserved employee is promoted based on the instructions of 319(A)\n\nbetween 10.02.1995 and 17.06.1995, his promotion is personal, but seniority\n\ncannot be given. Whereas, the promotions given to the unreserved category\n\nof employees against the reserved points either before 10.02.1995 or after\n\n17.06.1995 are protected.\n Therefore, the seniority issues were settled in\n\nNagaraj's case. There is no provision to delete the employees who have failed\n\nin the earlier selections. Even if they are excluded, the applicant will not figure\n\nin the field of eligibility for the present selection as the last person alerted for\n\nthe written examination entered into the Grade Pay of Rs. 4600/- on\n\n01.05.1992. \nThe prayer of the applicant is to prepare the seniority list based\n\non the catch up rule explained in \nVirpal Singh Chauhan\n's case.\n \nThe 85th\n\namendment reverses the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases\n\nof Virpal Singh Chauhan, Ajit Singh-I and Ajit Singh-II. There is no catch up\n\nrule in determining seniority followed in the India Railways after the 85th\n\namendment as confirmed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nNagraj\n's case.\n\n6. We have heard Mr. T.C. Govindaswamy (Sr.), learned counsel for the\n\napplicant and Mrs. Sumathi Dandapani (Sr.) with Mr. V.V. Joshi, learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents and perused the records.\n\n7. The issues involved in this O.A are (i) preparation of integrated\n\nseniority list for the purpose of promotion of Group-C employees to the post of\n\nACM (Group-B) and (ii) the tenability of accelerated seniority to the SC/ST\n\nemployees promoted on roster point. In regard to the first issue, for the sake\n\nof convenience, paras 203 (1) to (6) of IREM Vol.1 are extracted as under:\n\n \"203.1. Conditions of eligibility.- For the selection, all Group 'C'\n employees working on a regular basis in grade the minimum of\n which is Rs. 5000/- in the revised scale and in the higher Group 'C'\n grades and who have rendered not less than 3 years of non-\n fortuitous service in the grade are eligible. There will be no distinction\n between permanent and temporary employees.\n\n ( Railway Board's letter No. E(GP)/2005/2/69 dated 5.1.06]\n\n 203.2. In case a junior employee is considered for selection by\n virtue of his satisfying the relevant minimum service conditions all\n persons senior to him shall be held to be eligible, notwithstanding the\n position that they do not fulfill the requisite minimum service\n conditions.\n\n 203.4. Zone of consideration.- The number of employees to be\n called for the selection will be in accordance with the sliding scale in\n the order of seniority as shown below -\n\n 1. vacancies - 5 employees.\n\n 2. vacancies - 8 employees.\n\n 3. vacancies - 10 employees.\n\n 4. vacancies and above employees equal to three times the\n number of vacancies.\n\n 203.5. Since employees from the different streams will be eligible to\n appear for the selection, their integrated seniority for purposes of the\n selection should be determined on the basis of total length of non-\n fortuitous service rendered in grade Rs. 6500-10500 (R.S.) and\n above. In other words the date of appointment to the grade Rs.\n 6500-10500 (R.S.) on a non fortuitous basis will be the criterion.\n\n 203.6. If adequate number of SCs/STs are not available within the\n field so determined for consideration against reserved vacancies the\n field should be extended to five times the number of vacancies and\n only those SCs/STs coming in the extended field (and not the others)\n should be considered. \"\n\n Further, para 2(i) of RBE No. 46/10 dated 29.03.2010 at Annexure R-3\n\nreads as under:\n\n \"2. Now, consequent upon implementation of the pay scales\n recommended by the VI Pay Commission, the matter regarding\n eligibility conditions for appearing in the Selection/LDCE for\n promotion to Group 'B' posts in the major departments having\n 'Organised Services' (except Accounts Department), has been\n considered by the Board and it has been decided that :\n\n (i) For Group 'B' selections (70% quota), Group 'C' employees\n working in Pay Band PB-2 (Rs.9300-34,800) with Grade Pay of\n Rs.4200 and above with 3 years of non-fortuitous service in the\n grade (including non-fortuitous service rendered in the\n corresponding pre-revised grades) will be eligible.\"\n\n8. From the above, it is clear that an integrated seniority list based on the\n\ntotal length of non-fortuitous service rendered in GP Rs. 4600/- or Rs. 4200/-,\n\nas the case may be, is to be prepared. The inter se seniority list of eligible\n\nemployees at the divisional level is forwarded for further amalgamation at the\n\nHeadquarters to get the required integrated seniority list comprising of the\n\ncadres of all the divisions from which the zone of consideration is drawn up, as\n\nper the say of the respondents. It appears that the seniority list of all the\n\neligible employees of the Civil and Mechanical departments have been\n\npublished which are produced at Annexures A-6 and A-7. If Annexures A-6\n\nand A-7 are long , just because there are a good number of vacancies to be\n\nfilled up, then it is not substantiated by the respondents by stating the number\n\nof vacancies and the number of eligible employees considered for promotion.\n\nThe contention of the respondents is that an integrated seniority list of entire\n\nlot running to more than 500 employees is not required for the present\n\nselection as there are only 08 posts to be filled up. According to them, the\n\ninter se seniority list to meet the requirement of selection on hand in terms of\n\f\nthe instructions contained in Annexure R-3 and para 203.5 of IREM Vol.1.\n\nhas been prepared. Those instructions speak of integrated seniority list and\n\nthe criterion for determining the inter se seniority. There is nothing in them to\n\nsupport the stand of the respondents that the integrated seniority list should be\n\nlimited to meet the requirement of selection on hand. A truncated integrated\n\nseniority list which appears just in time for producing the main list and reserve\n\nlist and disappears soon after does not lend itself to be scrutinized and\n\nchallenged by those eligible employees who are not included in it. Therefore,\n\nwe are inclined to agree in the interest of transparency and equity with the\n\ncontention of the applicant that an integrated seniority list of all categories of\n\nstaff eligible to compete should be prepared first and then the zone of\n\nconsideration should be drawn up from it. If an integrated seniority list is long,\n\nit is only because there are a large number of eligible employees . Length of\n\nthe list is not a justification to curtail it arbitrarily. Once made, it would require\n\nonly periodic revision. In the absence of specific rule to limit the size, as in the\n\ncase of zone of consideration, the respondents are bound to prepare an\n\nintegrated seniority list of all eligible employees for the purpose of promotion to\n\nGroup-B . The assessment of seniority as per para 320 and 203.5 of IREM\n\nVol.1 provision does not come in the way of preparing an integrated seniority\n\nlist as above. When the Civil and Mechanical departments have published\n\nintegrated seniority lists running into 500 or 700 employees, there is no reason\n\nwhy the Commercial department could not have prepared an integrity seniority\n\nlist of all eligible employees. The respondents have not indicated any rule or\n\norder which treated the Commercial department of Souther Railway differently\n\nfrom other departments in the matter of preparing integrated seniority list for\n\nthe purpose of promotion to Group-B.\n\f\n\n9. The integrated seniority list at the Headquarter level is directly related to\n\nthe seniority list maintained at the divisional level. If the seniority list in the\n\ndifferent units at the different levels are not prepared correctly, the integrated\n\nseniority at the divisional level cannot be correct. Herein, the question of\n\naccelerated promotion to the SC/ST employees, who are promoted as per the\n\nroster point arises for consideration. The applicant contended that Annexure\n\nA-1 is not an integrated seniority list but only a list of persons from the\n\nseniority lists which were erroneously prepared against a catena of\n\njudgements of Hon'ble Supreme Court. The catch up rule explained in Virpal\n\nSingh Chauhan's judgement is relied on by the applicant. The respondents\n\naverred that the catch up rule is not followed in Indian Railways after 85th\n\namendment of the Constitution of India, which was confirmed by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in \nNagraj\n's case.\n \nThe Apex Court held in \nM. Nagraj\n's case\n\n(supra) while upholding the constitutional validity by 77th and 85th amendments\n\nthat in case, rules in respect of reservation in promotion with consequential\n\nseniority are to be framed, such rules should satisfy the tests of quantifiable\n\ndata as to backwardness and inadequacy of representation in public\n\nemployment and the overall administrative efficiency. Unless such an\n\nexercise is undertaken, the rules relating to reservation in promotion with\n\nconsequential seniority cannot be implemented. \nArticles 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n\nare enabling provisions calling for satisfaction of the conditions precedent for\n\nimplementation.\n \nThis position has been confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the judgement dated 27.04.2012 in Civil Appeal No. 2608/2011 (\nU.P.\n\nPower Corporation Ltd. vs. Rajesh Kumar & Ors.\n). The relevant part of the\n\nsaid judgement is extracted as under :\n\n\"36. To appreciate the rival submissions raised at the bar and the\ncore controversy, it is absolutely seemly to understand what has\nbeen held in \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) by the Constitution Bench. While\nassailing the validity of \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution which\nprovides for reservation in promotion with a consequential\nseniority, it was contended that equity in the context of \nArticle 16\n(1)\n connotes accelerated promotion so as not to include\nconsequential seniority and as consequential seniority has been\nattached to the accelerated promotion, the constitutional\namendment is violative of \nArticle 14\n read with \nArticle 16(1)\n of the\nConstitution. Various examples were cited about the disastrous\naffects that would be ushered in, in view of the amendment. After\nnoting all the contentions, the Constitution Bench addressed to the\nconcept of reservation in the context of \nArticle 16(4)\n and further\nproceeded to deal with equity, justice and merit. In that context,\nthe Bench stated thus: -\n\n \"This problem has to be examined, therefore, on the facts of\n each case. Therefore, \nArticle 16(4)\n has to be construed in the\n light of \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution. Inadequacy in\n representation and backwardness of Scheduled Caste and\n Scheduled Tribes are circumstances which enable the State\n Government to act under \nArticle 16 (4)\n of the Constitution.\n However, as held by this Court the limitations on the discretion\n of the Government in the matter of reservation under Article16\n (4) as well as \nArticle 16 (4A)\n come in the form of \nArticle 335\n of\n the Constitution.\"\n\nWhile dealing with reservation and affirmative action, the\nConstitution Bench opined thus: -\n\n \"48. It is the equality \"in fact\" which has to be decided looking\n at the ground reality. Balancing comes in where the question\n concerns the extent of reservation. If the extent of reservation\n goes beyond cut-off point then it results in reverse\n discrimination. Anti-discrimination legislation has a tendency of\n pushing towards de facto reservation. Therefore, a numerical\n benchmark is the surest immunity against charges of\n discrimination.\n\n 49. Reservation is necessary for transcending caste and not\n for perpetuating it. Reservation has to be used in a limited\n sense otherwise it will perpetuate casteism in the country.\n Reservation is under-written by a special justification. Equality\n in \nArticle 16(1)\n is individual-specific whereas reservation in\n \nArticle&#160;16(4)\n&#160;\nand \nArticle 16 (4-A)\n is enabling. The\n discretion of the State is, however, subject to the existence of\n \"backwardness\" and \"inadequacy of representation\" in public\n employment. Backwardness has to be based on objective\n factors whereas inadequacy has to factually exist. This is\n where judicial review comes in. However, whether reservation\n in a given case is desirable or not, as a policy, is not for us to\n decide as long as the parameters mentioned in \nArticles 16 (4)\n\n and \n16 (4A)\n are maintained. As stated above, equity, justice\n and merit (\nArticle 335\n)/efficiency are variables which can only\n be identified and measured by the State. Therefore, in each\n case, a contextual case has to be made out depending upon\n different circumstances which may exist Statewise.\"\n\n37. The Bench referred to the cases of Indra Sawhney (supra),\nR.K. Sabharwal (supra), \nVir Pal Singh Chauhan\n (supra), \nAjit Singh\n(I\n) (supra) and Ajit Singh (II) (supra) and opined that the concept of\ncatch-up rule and consequential seniority are judicially evolved\nconcepts to control the extent in reservation and the creation of\nthis concept is relatable to service jurisprudence. Thereafter, the\nConstitution Bench referred to the scope of the impugned\namendment and the Objects and Reasons and, in paragraph 86,\nobserved thus: -\n\n \"Clause (4-A) follows the pattern specified in Clauses (3) and\n (4) of \nArticle 16.\n Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n emphasizes the\n opinion of the States in the matter of adequacy of\n representation. It gives freedom to the State in an appropriate\n case depending upon the ground reality to provide for\n reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of\n posts in the services. The State has to form its opinion on the\n quantifiable data regarding adequacy of representation.\n\n Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n is an enabling provision. It gives\n freedom to the State to provide for reservation in matters of\n promotion. Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n applies only to SCs and\n STs. The said clause is carved out of \nArticle 16(4).\n Therefore,\n Clause (4-A) will be governed by the two compelling reasons -\n\n \"backwardness\" and \"inadequacy of representation\", as\n mentioned in \nArticle 16(4).\n If the said two reasons do not exist\n then the enabling provision cannot come into force. The State\n can make provision for reservation only if the above two\n circumstances exist. Further in Ajit Singh (II), this Court has\n held that apart from \"backwardness\" and \"inadequacy of\n representation\" the State shall also keep in mind \"overall\n efficiency\" (\nArticle 335\n). Therefore, all the three factors have to\n be kept in mind by the appropriate Government in providing for\n reservation in promotion for SCs and STs.\"\n\nThereafter, the Bench referred to the 2000 Amendment Act, the\nObjects and Reasons and the proviso inserted to \nArticle 335\n of the\nConstitution and held thus: -\n\n \"98. \nBy the Constitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act,\n 2000\n, a proviso was inserted at the end of \nArticle 335\n of the\n Constitution which reads as under:\n\n Provided that nothing in this article shall prevent in making of\n any provision in favour of the members of the Scheduled\n Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for relaxation in qualifying\n marks in any examination or lowering the standards of\n evaluation, for reservation in matters of promotion to any\n class or classes of services or posts in connection with the\n affairs of the Union or of a State.\"\n\n99. This proviso was added following the benefit of reservation in\npromotion conferred upon SCs and STs alone. This proviso was\ninserted keeping in mind the judgment of this Court in Vinod\nKumar which took the view that relaxation in matters of reservation\nin promotion was not permissible under \nArticle 16(4)\n in view of the\ncommand contained in \nArticle 335.\n Once a separate category is\ncarved out of Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n then that category is being\n\f\ngiven relaxation in matters of reservation in promotion. The proviso\nis confined to SCs and STs alone. The said proviso is compatible\nwith the scheme of \nArticle 16(4-A).\"\n\nIn paragraph 102, their Lordships have ruled thus: -\n\n \"Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n, however, states that the\n appropriate Government is free to provide for reservation in\n cases where it is satisfied on the basis of quantifiable data\n that backward class is inadequately represented in the\n services. Therefore, in every case where the State decides\n to provide for reservation there must exist two\n circumstances, namely, \"backwardness\" and \"inadequacy of\n representation'. As stated above, equity, justice and\n efficiency are variable factors. These factors are context-\n specific. There is no fixed yardstick to identify and measure\n these three factors, it will depend on the facts and\n circumstances of each case. These are the limitations on the\n mode of the exercise of power by the State. None of these\n limitations have been removed by the impugned\n amendments. If the concerned State fails to identify and\n measure backwardness, inadequacy and overall\n administrative efficiency then in that event the provision for\n reservation would be invalid. These amendments do not\n alter the structure of \nArticles 14\n, 15\n and \n16 (equity code).\n\n The parameters mentioned in \nArticle 16(4)\n are retained.\n Clause (4-A) is derived from Clause (4) of \nArticle 16.\n Clause\n (4-A) is confined to SCs and STs alone. Therefore, the\n present case does not change the identity of the\n Constitution.\"\n\nAfter so stating, it was observed that there is no violation of the\nbasic structure of the Constitution and the provisions are enabling\nprovisions. At that juncture, it has been observed as follows: -\n\n \"\nArticle 16(4) ;\nis enacted as a remedy for the past historical\n discriminations against a social class. The object in enacting\n the enabling provisions like \nArticles 16(4)\n, 16 (4a)\n and \n16\n (4B)\n is that the State is empowered to identify and recognize\n the compelling interests. If the State has quantifiable data to\n show backwardness and inadequacy then the State can\n make reservations in promotions keeping in mind\n maintenance of efficiency which is held to be a constitutional\n limitation on the discretion of the State in making reservation\n as indicated by \nArticle 335.\n As stated above, the concepts of\n efficiency, backwardness, inadequacy of representation are\n required to be identified and measured. That exercise\n depends on availability of data. That exercise depends on\n numerous factors. It is for this reason that enabling\n provisions are required to be made because each competing\n claim seeks to achieve certain goals. How best one should\n optimize these conflicting claims can only be done by the\n administration in the context of local prevailing conditions in\n public employment. This is amply demonstrated by the\n various decisions of this Court discussed hereinabove.\n\n Therefore, there is a basic difference between \"equality in\n law\" and \"equality in fact\" (See Affirmative Action by William\n Darity). If \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4B)\n flow from \nArticle 16(4) ;\n\n\f\n and if \nArticle 16(4)\n is an enabling provision then \nArticles 16\n (4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n are also enabling provisions. As long as the\n boundaries mentioned in \nArticle 16(4)\n, namely,\n backwardness, inadequacy and efficiency of administration\n are retained in \nArticles 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n as controlling\n factors, we cannot attribute constitutional invalidity to these\n enabling provisions. However, when the State fails to identify\n and implement the controlling factors then excessiveness\n comes in, which is to be decided on the facts of each case.\n In a given case, where excessiveness results in reverse\n discrimination, this Court has to examine individual cases\n and decide the matter in accordance with law. This is the\n theory of \"guided power\". We may once again repeat that\n equality is not violated by mere conferment of power but it is\n breached by arbitrary exercise of the power conferred.\"\n\nIn paragraph 108, the Bench analyzed the concept of application\nof the doctrine of guided power under \nArticle 335\n of the\nConstitution and, in that context, opined thus: -\n\n \"Therefore, the question before us is - whether the State\n could be empowered to relax qualifying marks or standards\n for reservation in matters of promotion. In our view, even\n after insertion of this proviso, the limitation of overall\n efficiency in \nArticle 335\n Is not obliterated. Reason is thaT\n \"efficiency\" is a variable factor. It is for State concerned to\n decide in a given case, whether the overall efficiency of the\n system is affected by such relaxation. If the relaxation is so\n excessive that it ceases to be qualifying marks then certainly\n in a given case, as in the past, the State is free not to relax\n such standards. In other cases, the State may evolve a\n mechanism under which efficiency, equity and justice, all\n three variables, could be accommodated. Moreover, \nArticle\n 335\n is to be read with \nArticle 46\n which provides that the\n State shall promote with special care the educational and\n economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and,\n in particular, of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes,\n and shall protect them from social injustice. Therefore, where\n the State finds compelling interests of backwardness and\n inadequacy, it may relax the qualifying marks for SCs/STs.\n These compelling interests however have to be identified by\n weighty and comparable data.\"\n\nThereafter, the Constitution Bench proceeded to deal with the test\nto judge the validity of the impugned State Acts and opined as\nfollows: -\n\n \"110. As stated above, the boundaries of the width of the\n power, namely, the ceiling-limit of 50% (the numerical\n benchmark), the principle of creamy layer, the compelling\n reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\n representation and the overall administrative efficiency are\n not obliterated by the impugned amendments. At the\n appropriate time, we have to consider the law as enacted by\n various States providing for reservation if challenged. At that\n time we have to see whether limitations on the exercise of\n power are violated. The State is free to exercise its discretion\n of providing for reservation subject to limitation, namely, that\n\f\n there must exist compelling reasons of backwardness,\n inadequacy of representation in a class of post(s) keeping in\n mind the overall administrative efficiency. It is made clear\n that even if the State has reasons to make reservation, as\n stated above, if the impugned law violates any of the above\n substantive limits on the width of the power the same would\n be liable to be set aside.\"\n\nIn paragraph 117, the Bench laid down as follows: -\n\n \"The extent of reservation has to be decided on facts of each\n case. The judgment in Indra Sawhney does not deal with\n constitutional amendments. In our present judgment, we are\n upholding the validity of the constitutional amendments\n subject to the limitations. Therefore, in each case the Court\n has got to be satisfied that the State has exercised its\n opinion in making reservations in promotions for SCs and\n STs and for which the State concerned will have to place\n before the Court the requisite quantifiable data in each case\n and satisfy the Court that such reservations became\n necessary on account of inadequacy of representation of\n SCs/ STs in a particular class or classes of posts without\n affecting general efficiency of service as mandated under\n Article 335of the Constitution.\"\n\nIn the conclusion portions, in paragraphs 123 and 124, it has been\nruled thus: -\n\n \"123. However, in this case, as stated above, the main issue\n concerns the \"extent of reservation\". In this regard the State\n concerned will have to show in each case the existence of\n the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy\n of representation and overall administrative efficiency before\n making provision for reservation. As stated above, the\n impugned provision is an enabling provision. The State is not\n bound to make reservation for SCs/STs in matter of\n promotions. However, if they wish to exercise their discretion\n and make such provision, the State has to collect quantifiable\n data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of\n representation of that class in public employment in addition\n to compliance with \nArticle 335.\n It is made clear that even if\n the State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State\n will have to see that its reservation provision does not lead to\n excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling-limit of 50% or\n obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation\n indefinitely.\n\n 124. Subject to the above, we uphold the constitutional\n validity of the \nConstitution (Seventy-Seventh Amendment)\n Act, 1995\n; the \nConstitution (Eighty-First Amendment) Act,\n 2000\n; the \nConstitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act,\n 2000\n and the \nConstitution (Eighty-Fifth Amendment) Act,\n 2001\n.\"\n\n38. From the aforesaid decision and the paragraphs we have\nquoted hereinabove, the following principles can be carved out: -\n\n i) Vesting of the power by an enabling provision may be\n constitutionally valid and yet `exercise of power' by the State\n in a given case may be arbitrary, particularly, if the State fails\n\f\nto identify and measure backwardness and inadequacy\nkeeping in mind the efficiency of service as required under\n\nArticle 335.\n\nii) \nArticle 16(4)\n which protects the interests of certain\nsections of the society has to be balanced against \nArticle 16\n(1)\n which protects the interests of every citizen of the entire\nsociety. They should be harmonized because they are\nrestatements of the principle of equality under \nArticle 14.\n\niii) Each post gets marked for the particular category of\ncandidates to be appointed against it and any subsequent\nvacancy has to be filled by that category candidate.\n\niv) The appropriate Government has to apply the cadre\nstrength as a unit in the operation of the roster in order to\nascertain whether a given class/group is adequately\nrepresented in the service. The cadre strength as a unit also\nensures that the upper ceiling-limit of 50% is not violated.\n\nFurther roster has to be post-specific and not vacancy\nbased.\n\nv) The State has to form its opinion on the quantifiable data\nregarding adequacy of representation. Clause (4A) of \nArticle\n16\n is an enabling provision. It gives freedom to the State to\nprovide for reservation in matters of promotion. Clause (4A)\nof \nArticle 16\n applies only to SCs and STs. The said clause is\ncarved out of \nArticle 16(4A).\n Therefore, Clause (4A) will be\ngoverned by the two compelling reasons - \"backwardness\"\nand \"inadequacy of representation\", as mentioned in \nArticle\n16(4).\n If the said two reasons do not exist, then the enabling\nprovision cannot be enforced.\n\nvi) If the ceiling-limit on the carry-over of unfilled vacancies is\nremoved, the other alternative time-factor comes in and in\nthat event, the time-scale has to be imposed in the interest\nof efficiency in administration as mandated by \nArticle 335.\n If\nthe time-scale is not kept, then posts will continue to remain\nvacant for years which would be detrimental to the\nadministration. Therefore, in each case, the appropriate\nGovernment will now have to introduce the duration\ndepending upon the fact-situation.\n\nvii) If the appropriate Government enacts a law providing for\nreservation without keeping in mind the parameters in \nArticle\n16(4)\n and \nArticle 335\n, then this Court will certainly set aside\nand strike down such legislation.\n\nviii) The constitutional limitation under \nArticle 335\n is relaxed\nand not obliterated. As stated above, be it reservation or\nevaluation, excessiveness in either would result in violation\nof the constitutional mandate. This exercise, however, will\ndepend on the facts of each case.\n\nix) The concepts of efficiency, backwardness and\ninadequacy of representation are required to be identified\nand measured. That exercise depends on the availability of\ndata. That exercise depends on numerous factors. It is for\nthis reason that the enabling provisions are required to be\nmade because each competing claim seeks to achieve\ncertain goals. How best one should optimize these conflicting\n\f\n claims can only be done by the administration in the context\n of local prevailing conditions in public employment.\n\n x) \nArticle 16(4)\n, therefore, creates a field which enables a\n State to provide for reservation provided there exists\n backwardness of a class and inadequacy of representation\n in employment. These are compelling reasons. They do not\n exist in \nArticle 16(1).\n It is only when these reasons are\n satisfied that a State gets the power to provide for\n reservation in the matter of employment.\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n10. Further, in the order dated 02.12.2010 in O.A. No. 2211/2008, the\n\nPrincipal bench of this Tribunal held as under:\n\n \"37. We have applied our mind to the pleadings and the\n contentions raised by the learned counsel representing the\n applicants on the issues as mentioned above, but are of the view\n that once, in brevity, it is the case of the applicants that when no\n compliance of pre-conditions as spelled out in M. Nagaraj's case\n has been done, reservation in promotion with accelerated seniority\n shall have to be worked in the way and manner as per the law\n settled earlier on the issue. If that be so, we need not have to\n labour on the issues raised by the applicants, as surely, if the\n position is already settled, the only relevant discussion and\n adjudication in this case can be and should be confined to non-\n observance of the pre-conditions for making accelerated\n promotions as valid. We have already held above that the railways\n have not worked out or even applied their mind to the pre-\n conditions as mentioned above before giving effect to the\n provisions of \nArticle 16(4A)\n, and for that reason, circular dated\n 29.2.2008 vide which the seniority of SC/ST railway servants\n promoted by virtue of rule of reservation/roster has to be regulated\n in terms of instructions contained in Board's letter dated 8.3.2002\n and 13.1.2005, has to be quashed. \nThere is a specific prayer to\n quash instructions dated 8.3.2002 and 13.1.2005 as well, but there\n would be no need to do so as the same have been discussed in\n the case of railways itself in the matter of \nVirpal Singh Chauhan\n\n (supra), and commented upon. While setting aside instructions\n dated 29.2.2008, our directions would be to not to give accelerated\n seniority to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe category\n employees till such time pre-conditions on which alone \nArticle 16\n (4A)\n of the Constitution is to operate, are complied with. No\n directions in this case can be given as regards seniority of the\n applicants vis-a-vis those who were appointed with them and have\n stolen a march over them because of reservation and have\n obtained accelerated seniority. No such specific prayer has been\n made either. However, it would be open for the parties to this lis or\n any one else to seek determination of their proper seniority for\n which legal proceedings shall have to be resorted to. It would be\n difficult to order across the board that all those who have obtained\n the benefit of reservation and have also been accorded\n\f\n accelerated seniority be put below general category candidates\n who may have been senior to the reserved category employees\n and became below in seniority on the promoted posts because of\n conferment of accelerated seniority to the reserved category\n employees. Surely, for seeking seniority over and above\n Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe employees, number of\n things shall have to be gone into, as for instance, as to when was\n the promotion made and seniority fixed, and whether the cause of\n general category employees would be within limitation. There can\n be number of issues that may arise. We have mentioned only one\n by way of illustration.\n\n 38. Present Original Application is disposed of in the\n manner fully indicated above. In view of the nature of the\n controversy involved in the case, costs of the litigation are made\n easy.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n11. In view of the above settled position of law, R.B.E. No. 33/2002 dated\n\n08.03.2002 at Annexure A-14 allowing the SC/ST employees to retain consequential\n\nseniority upon their promotion by virtue of rule of reservation with effect from\n\n17.06.1995 has no legs to stand on. The respondents have implemented the\n\nenabling provisions of the Constitution without meeting the pre-conditions of\n\nascertaining backwardness, inadequacy and overall administrative efficiency for\n\ndoing so as per the declared law of the land. The Principal Bench of this Tribunal\n\nhas already set aside the circular dated 29.02.2008 which reads as under:-\n\n \"R.B.E.No.29/2008\n\n Subject : Principles for determining the seniority of staff\n belonging to SC/ST promoted earlier vis-a-vis,\n General/OBC staff promoted later.\n\n Reference : (i)Board's letter No.E(NG)I-97/SR6/3 (Vol.III),\n dated 8.3.2002 (Bahri's 33/2002, p-50)\n\n (ii) Board's letter No.E(NG)I-97/SR6/3 (Vol.IV),\n dated 13.1.2005, (Bahri's 7/2005, p-10).\n\n [No.E(NG)I-97/SR6/3 Vol.IV dated 29.2.2008]\n\n The Railways are aware that in pursuance of the\n Constitution (85th \nAmendment) Act, 2001\n, instructions were\n issued vide this Ministry's letter dated 8.3.2002 quoted above\n that w.e.f 17.6.1995 SC/ST Railway servants shall, on their\n promotion by virtue of rule of reservation/roster, be entitled to\n\f\n consequential seniority also. These instructions were,\n however, reiterated vide this Ministry's letter of even number\n dated 21.11.2002 for implementation subject to final outcome\n of the Writ Petitions pending before the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court.\n\n \nThe Railways would also be aware that while disposing\n of the aforesaid Writ Petitions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n their order dated 19.10.2006 in the case of \nM.Nagraj & Ors.\n Vs. UOI & Ors\n have, inter alia, upheld the validity of the\n Constitution (85th \nAmendment) Act, 2001\n. So far as other\n issues discussed in Apex Court's judgment, relevant\n clarifications have since been issued by DOP&T vide their\n O.M.No.36036/2/2007-Estt. (Res.) dated 29.3.2007 and\n circulated vide this Ministry's letter No.97-E (SCT)I/49/25,\n dated 29.5.2007. Thus, in the light of the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court's order dated 19.10.2006, the seniority of the SC/ST\n Railway servants promoted by virtue of rule of\n reservation/roster shall be regulated in terms of instructions\n contained in Board's letter dated 8.3.2002 and 13.1.2005\n \nreferred to above\n.\"\n\nThe direction to regulate the seniority of the SC/ST Railway servants promoted\n\nby virtue of the rule of reservation in terms of the instructions contained in\n\nBoard's letters dated 08.03.2002 and 13.01.2005 is quashed by the Principal\n\nBench. Consequently and also in the light of the judgement of the Apex Court\n\nin \nU.P. Power Corporation Ltd. vs. Rajesh Kumar\n (supra) , the instructions\n\nin R.B.E. No. 33/2002 dated 08.03.2002 have become null and void and,\n\ntherefore,there is no need to quash it. Mere pendency of Writ Petitions (C)\n\nbefore the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi against the order of the Principal\n\nBench of CAT in O.A. No. 2211/2008 does not affect the validity of the order or\n\nthe onus of the respondents to implement it. Whether the applicant will find a\n\nplace in the zone of consideration depends on his position in the integrated\n\nseniority list. Not being prejudicial to any legal right or claim of any person,\n\nthe question of non-impleadment of necessary parties does not arise in the\n\ninstant case.\n\n12. In the result, the respondents are directed to prepare an integrated\n\nseniority list of all eligible employees for promotion to Group-B and publish it\n\ncalling for objections, if any, and finalise it before conducting selection for\n\npromotion to the post of Assistant Commercial Manager in Group-B service in\n\nthe Commercial Department. Annexure A-1 notification dated 25.01.2012 is\n\nquashed.\n\n13. The O.A. is allowed as above with no order as to costs.\n\n (Dated, the 09th October, 2012)\n\n (K. GEORGE JOSEPH) (JUSTICE P.R.
