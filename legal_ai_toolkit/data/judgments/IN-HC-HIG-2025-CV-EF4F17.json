The plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010 are briefly as follows:-\n\n3/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\n4.1. The suit properties are situated in Mulligrampattu village near\n\nNellikuppam in Cuddalore District. The Plaintiffs 1 to 6 and the Defendant-1\n\nare the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. The suit properties were originally\n\npurchased by K.M.Hanifa through a registered sale deed dated 07.04.1969 for\n\nvaluable consideration and he was in possession and enjoyment of the\n\nproperties till his death. The revenue records – patta, chitta and adangal are in\n\nthe name of K.M.Hanifa. K.M.Hanifa died intestate on 21.01.1997 leaving\n\nbehind him, his wife/first Plaintiff, the sons and daughters/Plaintiff 2 to 6 and\n\nthe first Defendant as legal heirs. While so, the Plaintiffs came to know that\n\nthe second Defendant had instituted a suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 against the\n\nfirst Defendant as though the first Defendant had entered into a sale agreement\n\ndeed with the second Defendant to sell the suit properties to the second\n\nDefendant. The suit in O.S.No. 34 of 2009 was alleged to have filed seeking\n\nrelief of specific performance of contract for sale against the first Defendant by\n\nthe second Defendant. The Plaintiffs 1 to 6 are not parties to the said sale\n\nagreement deed. The alleged sale agreement deed will not bind the Plaintiffs 1\n\nto 6. The second Defendant attempted to interfere with the possession of the\n\nPlaintiffs. Therefore, the Plaintiffs were forced to file the suit in O.S.No. 252\n\nof 2009 seeking declaration that the suit properties belong to the Plaintiffs and\n\nthe first Defendant and also the Plaintiffs had filed the suit in O.S.No.20 of\n\n2010 seeking partition. The first Plaintiff/wife of K.M.Hanifa is entitled to 1/8\n\n4/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nshare, sons of K.M.Hanifa are entitled to 2/3rd shares and the daughters are\n\nentitled to 1/3 share. Therefore, the Plaintiffs are collectively entitled to 58/72\n\nshares. The first Defendant is entitled to 14/72 share. Therefore, the Plaintiffs\n\n1 to 6 seeking preliminary decree for partition of their 58/72 shares. The first\n\nDefendant remains ex parte in the suit.\n\n5. The brief averments in the written statement filed by the second\n\nDefendant are as follows:\n\n5.1. The suite preferred by the Plaintiffs is not maintainable and\n\ntherefore, the suit is to be dismissed. The second Defendant denied the claim\n\nmade by the Plaintiffs. The second Defendant had instituted the suit in\n\nO.S.No.34 of 2009 against the first Defendant seeking specific performance of\n\ncontract for sale of the property. On coming to know of the pendency of the\n\nsuit in O.S.No.34 of 2009, the Plaintiffs have filed the suit in O.S.No.20 of\n\n2010 to create complications. The suit properties belong to K.M.Hanifa. After\n\nthe death of K.M.Hanifa, the Plaintiffs 1 to 6 and the first Defendant,who are\n\nthe legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa, are entitled to share in the property. The\n\ndaughters of K.M.Hanifa were married off and they are living with their\n\nhusbands. The fourth Plaintiff, son of K.M.Hanifa, is living abroad. The first\n\nDefendant is taking care of the properties on behalf of the family of the\n\ndeceased K.M.Hanifa. The first Defendant had executed a sale agreement deed\n\n5/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\ndated 17.07.1997 with this second Defendant. The first Defendant also agreed\n\nto execute the sale deed on return of his brother from abroad and also\n\nundertake to execute the sale deed along with other legal heirs. Subsequently,\n\nhe had entered into sale agreement deed on 15.03.1999 agreeing to execute the\n\nsale deed along with other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. The Defendant-1 did not\n\nexecute the sale deed as per his undertaking in the sale agreement deed dated\n\n15.03.1999. Therefore, he had executed a sale agreement deed dated\n\n11.10.2004 and also a fresh sale agreement deed dated 06.12.2006. He had not\n\nexecuted the sale deed as per his undertaking. Therefore, the second Defendant\n\nhad instituted the suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 seeking specific performance of\n\ncontract for sale of the property. To create multiplicity of proceedings, the\n\nPlaintiffs 1 to 6 had filed the suit in O.S.No.20 of 2010 seeking partition\n\nwithout exhausting the remedy in the suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 filed by the\n\nsecond Defendant against the first Defendant. This Court cannot consider the\n\ngranting relief of partition to the Plaintiff. There is no cause of action for\n\ninstituting the suit. The suit is not maintainable and is to be dismissed.\n\n6. Based on the pleadings in the plaint and in the written statement,\n\nthe learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, had framed\n\nthe following issues:\n\n(i) Whether the suit properties are the joint family\n\n6/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nproperties of the Plaintiffs and the first Defendant?\n\n(ii) Whether the suit as framed is maintainable?\n\n(iii) Whether the Plaintiffs 1 to 6 are entitled to claim 58/72\nshare in the suit property?\n\n(iv) Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief of\npartition?\n\n(v) To what other reliefs the Plaintiffs are entitled to?\n\n7. Originally the suit was filed as O.S.No. 34 of 2009 by the second\n\nDefendant in O.S.No.20 of 2010 against the first Defendant in O.S.No. 20 of\n\n2010 on the file of the learned Sub Judge, Panruti which was re-numbered as\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015 on transfer to the learned I Additional District and Sessions\n\nJudge, Cuddalore.\n\n8. The plaint averments in O.S.No.19 of 2015 are briefly as follows:\n\n8.1. On 06.12.2006 the Plaintiff entered into sale agreement with the\n\nDefendant for execution of the sale deed for the suit property agreeing to\n\nexecute the sale deed for Rs.2,50,000/-. On the date of agreement,\n\nRs.2,30,000/- was paid by the Plaintiff, for the balance of sale consideration of\n\nRs.20,000/-, the Defendant agreed to execute sale deed within the stipulated\n\ntime. Since the Plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of the\n\ncontract for payment of Rs.20,000/- and the Defendant did not come forward to\n\n7/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nexecute the sale deed within the stipulated period, the Plaintiff was forced to\n\nfile the suit for specific performance against the Defendant. If the Defendant\n\nfailed to execute the sale deed, the Court shall execute the sale in favour of the\n\nPlaintiff. The Plaintiff had already paid Rs.2,30,000/- on the date of sale\n\nagreement deed. The Defendant agreed to execute sale deed along with other\n\nlegal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. As the Defendant did not come forward to execute\n\nthe sale deed, the Plaintiff had issued legal notice dated 25.06.2008 calling\n\nupon the Defendant to execute the sale deed. On receipt of the said notice, the\n\nDefendant had disputed the claim of the Plaintiff and sent reply with vexatious\n\ncontents. Therefore, the suit had been filed by the Plaintiff seeking the relief of\n\nspecific performance of contract for sale of the property. The suit is to be\n\ndecreed as prayed for.\n\n9. The contents of the written statement filed by the Defendant are\n\nbriefly as follows:\n\n9.1. The suit as framed is not maintainable. The Defendant disputed\n\nthe claim of the Plaintiff. The Defendant has no intention to encumber the\n\nproperties. The sale agreement is a fraudulent deed. The Defendant had not\n\nreceived any amount from the Plaintiff. The suit property was originally\n\nbelonged to the father of the Defendant K.M.Hanifa. He purchased the\n\nproperty in the year 1997 and was in enjoyment of the same. After the death of\n\n8/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nK.M.Hanifa, the suit properties were enjoyed by the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa.\n\nThe claim of the Plaintiff that the Defendant claiming to be the head of the\n\njoint family is not true. In Mohammedan Law, there is no concept of joint\n\nfamily. Also the Plaintiff did not know the wherewithal to purchase the\n\nproperty. The suit property is worth about Rs.25,00,000/- as on the date of\n\nfilling of the suit. The suit property is in enjoyment of the legal heirs of\n\nK.M.Hanifa. The alleged sale agreement deed is a self-serving document\n\ncreated by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had obtained the signature of the\n\nDefendant in a blank sheet of paper and had subsequently created alleged sale\n\nagreement deed. The suit is filed with an evil intention to grab the property of\n\nK.M.Hanifa. The Defendant has a share in the suit property along with the\n\nPlaintiffs 1 to 6 in O.S.No.20 of 2010. The Plaintiff is aware of the same. Still\n\nhe had filed the suit seeking specific performance of contract for sale which is\n\nnot maintainable.\n\n10. Based on the pleadings in the plaint and the written statement of\n\nthe Defendant, the following issues were framed by the learned I Additional\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore:-\n\n(i) Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief of\nspecific performance of contract for sale?\n\n(ii) To what relief the Plaintiff is entitled to?\n\n9/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\n11. Since the properties in both the suits are one and the same, both\n\nthe suits were taken up for joint trial. The Defendants 1 and 2 in O.S.No.20 of\n\n2010 are the Plaintiff and Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015.\n\n12. Based on the Tr.O.P.No.29 of 2014, the learned Principal District\n\nand Sessions Judge, had withdrawn the suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 from the file\n\nof the learned Sub Judge, Panruti to the file of the learned I Additional District\n\nand Sessions Judge, Cuddalore and re-numbered as O.S.No. 19 of 2015. The\n\nsuit filed by the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa in O.S.No. 20 of 2010 and the suit\n\nfiled in O.S.No.19 of 2015 are taken up together for joint trial.\n\n13. During trial, the Plaintiff Ramu in O.S.No. 19 of 2015 was\n\nexamined as P.W-1 and the attesting witness to the sale agreement deed\n\nS.Sherfuddin was examined as P.W-2.

On appreciation of evidence, the learned I Additional District and\n\nSessions Judge, Cuddalore, by common judgement dated 29.04.2017 had\n\ndismissed the suit of the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015 thereby refusing to\n\ngrant the relief of specific performance and instead, granted the alternate relief\n\nof refund of advance amount of Rs.2,30,000/- in favour of the Plaintiff in\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015. The suit in O.S.No. 20 of 2010 filed by the legal heirs of\n\nK.M.Hanifa was decreed thereby granting preliminary decree for partition of\n\n58/72 shares for the Plaintiffs.\n\n11/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\n16. Aggrieved, the second Defendant in O.S.No. 20 of 2010 had\n\npreferred the Appeal in A.S.No.445 of 2023 against the grant of preliminary\n\ndecree. Also the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015 had preferred Appeal in\n\nA.S.No.446 of 2023 seeking to set aside the judgment and decree dated\n\n29.04.2017 passed in O.S.No.19 of 2015. Also, the second Defendant in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 had preferred Appeal in A.S.No.555 of 2022 seeking to set\n\naside the final decree dated 28.04.2017 passed in I.A.No.2 of 2018 in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 by the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,\n\nCuddalore.\n\n17. The suit in O.S.No.252 of 2009 filed by the Plaintiffs in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 as Plaintiffs before the learned Principal District Munsif,\n\nPanruti was not withdrawn or transferred to the file of the leaned I Additional\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore for trial along with the suit in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 and O.S.No.19 of 2015. Therefore, this Court is\n\nconstrained to dispose of the Appeal in A.S.No.445 and 446 of 2023 and 555\n\nof 2022.\n\n18. The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the suit in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 was filed by the Plaintiffs 1 to 6 against Defendant-1 and\n\n12/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nDefendant-2.

Ex.B-3 is the legal heirs certificate of deceased K.M.Hanifa.\n\nEx.B-4 is the Power of Attorney deed in favour of Rabiathul Arabia by\n\nH.Basheeria Bivi/Plaintiff-1, H.Habibur Rahman/Plaintiff-4 and Sathiq\n\nBasha/Plaintiff-6.\n\n15/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\n23. D.W-1 was cross examined extensively by the learned Counsel for\n\nthe Plaintiff/Ramu. In the cross examination, the suggestion on behalf of the\n\nPlaintiff Ramu that the Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015 Nazeer Ahamed had\n\ninstigated his mother and siblings as the Plaintiffs to file the suit in O.S.No.20\n\nof 2010 was denied by him. He had admitted that even during the lifetime of\n\nK.M.Hanifa, the Plaintiff Ramu was cultivating the suit property as a tenant.\n\nEven after the death of K.M.Hanifa, he was still cultivating the property.\n\nTherefore, the finding of the trial Court is erroneous and the same is to be set\n\naside.\n\n24. In support of his submissions, the learned Counsel for the\n\nAppellant Mr.R.Muralidharan relied on the following decisions:\n\n(i) In\n2023-1-L.W. 777 [U.Venkatesan vs. Susila & Others\n] it has been\n\nheld as follows:\n\n“(31)\nSection 12\nof Specific Relief Act enables the Court to grant\nspecific performance in respect of a part of contract in respect of\nsituations covered under sub-sections [2], [3] and [4]. In the present\ncase, the execution of Agreement by defendants 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 is not\nin dispute. Therefore, the contract as such, is valid in respect of 8/9th\nshare which is enforceable against defendants 1 to 5 and 7 to 9. When\nthe contract is held to be valid and binding on defendants 1 to 5 and 7\nto 9 except the 6th defendant who is entitled to only 1/9th share, there\nis no impediment for the Court to grant specific performance, if the\nplaintiff has otherwise proved his readiness and willingness and entitled\nto a decree for specific performance in respect of the undivided share of\ndefendants 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 in respect of their 8/9th share.

What remains to be considered is the other contention of the\nlearned Counsel for the appellants that the plaintiff herself has claimed\nthe alternative relief for refund of advance amount and damages and\nhence the grant of decree of specific performance by the Trial Court is\nunjust tothe first defendant. In this connection, reliance was placed on\nthe following decisions of the Supreme Court:\n\n1.\nS. Rangaraju Naidu Vs. S. Thiruvarakkarasu\n, and\n\n2.\nKanshi Ram Vs. Om Prakash Jawal and others\n, .\n\nIn the first decision cited, since the borrower was not in a\nposition to pay the amount due on promissory note, he entered into an\nagreement to sell his property and the agreement was sought for to be\nenforced and in those circumstances, the Apex Court held that\npredominant object would be for recovery of dues with interest and\nhence the Court is not bound to grant specific performance and in that\nview of the matter, granted the alternative relief. In the second decision\ncited, the plaintiff had claimed specific performance and in the\nalternative, a sum of Rs. 12,000/- as damages and the defendant offered\na sum of Rs. 10 lakhs as an alternative relief and in those\ncircumstances, the Apex Court held that the relief of specific\nperformance was inequitable and awarded the alternative relief. The\nabove decisions would not apply to the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case. As rightly contended by the learned Senior Counsel for\nthe first defendant, the alternative plea of refund of advance amount\nand damages cannot itself be a bar to claim a decree for specific\nperformance of the contract, as held by the Apex Court in the decision\nin\nMotilal Jain v. Smt. Ramdasi Devi and Ors.\n(2000) 3 M.L.J. 202\n(S.C.) and in the decision of the Supreme Court in P.C. Varghese,\nreferred above.”\n\n25. The learned Counsel for the Respondents 1 to 6 Mr. R. Rajavelan,\n\nsubmitted his argument on behalf of the Respondents. The Appellant herein as\n\nPlaintiff had filed the suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 before the learned Sub Judge,\n\nPanruti against Nazeer Ahamed alone (Respondent in A.S.No.446 of 2023 and\n\nRespondent 7 in A.S.No.445 of 2023 also in A.S.No.555 of 2022). The suit in\n\nO.S. No. 34 of 2009 was filed by the Appellant herein as Plaintiff seeking\n\nspecific performance of contract based on an unregistered agreement for sale\n\n18/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\ndated 06.12.2006 in respect of 3 acres 44 cents of landed property with 7.5 HP\n\nmotor pump sets and bore-well situated at Mulligrampattu village near\n\nNellikuppam in Cuddalore District. As per the plaint averments in O.S.No. 34\n\nof 2009, the suit property belongs to Nazeer Ahamed who had entered into\n\nunregistered sale agreement for sale on 06.12.2006 with Plaintiff Ramu for\n\nRs.2,50,000/-. The Plaintiff had paid Rs.2,30,000/- as advance. Nazeer\n\nAhamed agreed to execute the sale deed after receipt of Rs.20,000/- within a\n\nperiod of 2 years. Also he agreed that he being the elder son of K.M.Hanifa,\n\nand on behalf of other family members, to execute the sale deed and major\n\nportion of sale consideration having been accepted, possession of the property\n\nwas handed over to the Plaintiff. Nazeer Ahamed filed written statement\n\ndenying execution of agreement for sale but remained ex parte before the trial\n\nCourt. Having come to know about the same, the mother and siblings of\n\nNazeer Ahamed, the Respondents 1 to 6 in the Appeal Suit Nos.445 of 2023\n\nand 555 of 2022 had filed the suit in O.S. No.20 of 2010 before the learned\n\nfirst Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, for partition and\n\nseparate possession of their 58/72 share of the property from an extent of 3\n\nacres 44 cents against Nazeer Ahamed, 7th Respondent in Nos.445 of 2023 and\n\n555 of 2022 and the sole Respondent in A.S.No.446 of 2023. The mother and\n\nsiblings of Nazeer Ahamed claimed that they were not aware that Nazeer\n\nAhamed had entered into sale agreement with the Plaintiff Ramu. Therefore,\n\n19/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nthe claim that it is a fraudulent transaction and it will not bind them. Further,\n\nthe Respondents 1 to 6 in this Appeal content that the suit property an extent of\n\n3 acres 44 cents comprised in S.No.25/1 and S.No.25/19 belong to their father\n\nK.M.Hanifa by virtue of a registered sale deed dated 07.04.1969 executed in\n\nhis favour by Ganapathi Pillai. K.M.Hanifa was in possession and enjoyment\n\nof the said property till his death by effecting mutation of revenue records.\n\nK.M.Hanifa died intestate on 21.09.1997 leaving behind him his widow, three\n\nsons and 3 daughters as legal heirs, the Respondents 1 to 6 and Nazeer Ahamed\n\nas 7th Respondent in the appeals in A.S.Nos.445 of 2023 and 555 of 2022.\n\nAccording to the Mohammedan Law, the window takes 1/8 share and the\n\nremaining 7/8 shares taken by 3 sons and 3 daughters. The sons taking 2\n\nshares of the daughters share. Therefore, the Plaintiffs together entitled to\n\n58/12 share. Nazeer Ahamed is entitled to 14/72 share. Nazeer Ahamed\n\nremained ex parte in the partition suit also. The only contesting Defendant was\n\nRamu. Ramu had claimed that Nazeer Ahamed had been looking after and\n\nmanaging the property on behalf of other family members. Therefore, the\n\nPlaintiff Ramu claims that he had entered into sale agreement dated 17.07.1997\n\nwhere he undertook to execute sale deed with all other co-sharers and it could\n\nnot be completed. Therefore, subsequent sale agreements were executed on\n\nfollowing dates 15.03.1999, 11.10.2004 and yet another agreement for sale\n\ndated 06.12.2006 between them. It is further contended that on the strength of\n\n20/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nagreement for sale dated 06.12.2006, the Plaintiff Ramu claims to have filed\n\nthe suit for specific performance and the suit was filed by the mother and other\n\nsiblings of Nazeer Ahamed at the instigation of Nazeer Ahamed.\n\n26. The suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 was withdrawn and transferred to\n\nthe file of the I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, to be tried\n\nalong with O.S.No.20 of 2010 jointly as per order dated 12.08.2014 made in\n\nTransfer O.P.No. 29 of 2014 by the learned Principal District Judge,\n\nCuddalore.

However, refund of\n\nadvance amount of Rs.2,30,000/- with interest at the rate of 6% per annum\n\nfrom the date of suit was ordered and Nazeer Ahamed was directed to pay the\n\nsaid amount.\n\n27. Regarding suit for partition in O.S.No. 20 of 2010 preliminary\n\n21/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\ndecree was passed by the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,\n\nCuddalore granting the Plaintiffs 58/72 share. Aggrieved by the common\n\njudgment dated 29.04.2017, the Plaintiff Ramu had preferred two appeals\n\nbefore this Court in A.S.No.445 of 2023 and A.S.No.446 of 2023 against the\n\naforesaid two suits in O.S.No. 19 of 2015 (Previously O.S. No.34 of 2009) and\n\nO.S.No. 20 of 2010 on the file of the learned I Additional District and Sessions\n\nJudge, Cuddalore.\n\n28. On the strength of the preliminary decree passed on 29.04.2017,\n\nthe Plaintiffs in O.S.No. 20 of 2010 obtained final degree in I.A.No. 2 of 2018\n\nin O.S. No. 20 of 2010 after contest on 28.04.2022. As per the final decree, the\n\nPlaintiffs were allotted 2 acres 61½ cents of land representing their share of\n\n58/72 and 63 cents was allotted to Nazeer Ahamed towards his 14/72 share as\n\nAdvocate Commissioner found that the extent of land available on field is 3\n\nacres 26 cents. Aggrieved over the final decree passed in I.A. No. 2 of 2018 in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010, the Plaintiff in O.S.No. 34 of 2009, who is the Respondent\n\nin the EP, had filed A.S.No.555 of 2022 against the order passed by the learned\n\nI Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore. The Respondents 1 to 6\n\nin this appeal had filed E.P.No. 177 of 2022 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 before the\n\nlearned I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore against Nazeer\n\nAhamed and Ramu.

The impugned common\n\njudgement dated 29.04.2017 made in two suits and final decree dated\n\n28.04.21022 are under challenge by way of these three Appeals before this\n\nCourt in A.S.No.445 and 446 of 2023 and A.S.No.555 of 2022. The learned I\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, in his judgment in\n\nparagraph 14 had observed as follows:\n\n“K/t/vz;/19-2015 vd;w tHf;fpy; cs;s thjp uhK th/rh/1\nMf tprhhpf;fg;gl;Ls;shh;/ mth; jdJ rhl;rpaj;jpy; FWf;F\ntprhuizapy; jhth brhj;Jf;fis cwdpghtpw;F MW\ngps;isfs; thhpRfshf cs;shh;fs; vd;W bjhpe;Jjhd;/ jhd;\ne!PJ mfkJt[ld; xg;ge;jk; nghl;ljhft[k; cwdpgh 1997y;\n,we;Jtpl;lhh; vd;Wk; xg;gf[ ;bfhz;Ls;shh;/”\n\n29. By observing above and relying upon Ex.A-1, the learned I\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, had come to the conclusion\n\nthat the agreement for sale dated 06.12.2006 will not bind the other legal heirs\n\nof K.M.Hanif, Respondents 1 to 6 thereby declined the main relief of specific\n\nperformance of contract for sale of the property but granted the alternate relief\n\nof refund of advance amount of Rs.2,30,000/- with interest at the rate of 6%\n\nper annum from the date of plaint till the date of recovery.\n\n30. Hence, the said unregistered agreement for sale is invalid,\n\nunenforceable since Nazeer Ahamed, who had executed the agreement\n\n23/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nregarding the entire property of 3 acres 44 cents did not have the absolute title\n\nof the property. On perusal of the sale agreement, it reads as if he does not\n\nhave absolute right over the property and it reads as if he alone is the legal heir\n\nof K.M.Hanifa. The Respondents 1 to 6, who are widow, 3 sons and 3\n\ndaughters were not referred in the sale agreement at all. The signature of the\n\nRespondents were not obtained in the sale agreement deed. The agreement is\n\nnot executable as the same is barred by\nSection 17\nof Specific Relief Act. In\n\nfact, it is fraudulent on the face of it.\n\n31.\nIn this nexus, the Respondents 1 to 6 (Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of\n\n2010) relied upon the decision made in 2015 3\nCTC 229 [Pemmada\n\nPrabhakar and others vs. Youngmen\n's Vysya Association and others]\n\nwherein it has been held as under:\n\n“33. .... It is an undisputed fact that the plaintiffs have not approached the\nTrial Court with clean hands. It is evident from the pleadings of the\nAgreement of Sale which is produced for the decree for specific\nperformance of Agreement of Sale as the plaintiffs did not obtain the\nsignatures of all the co-sharers of the property namely, the mother of the\ndefendants, the third brother and 3 sisters. Therefore, the agreement is not\nenforceable in law as the persons who have executed the sale deed, did not\nhave the absolute title of the property.”\n\n32. The learned trial Judge granted final decree dated 28.04.2022\n\nmade in I.A.No. 2 of 2018 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and held that the green\n\nsketched portion in the Advocate Commissioner's report totalling 2 acres 61½\n\n24/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\ncents had been allotted to the Plaintiffs 1 to 6 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and the\n\nportion highlighted in yellow sketch in the plan to the extent of 0.63 cents was\n\nallotted to Nazeer Ahamed. Under the said final decree, the Plaintiffs as\n\nPetitioners in the final decree were permitted to draw water from the mortar\n\npump set for 5 days in the week and Nazeer Ahamed was given permission to\n\ndraw water for 2 days and 0.1½ cents have been earmarked for use as common\n\npathway for both parties. The claim of the Appellant Ramu that 14/72 share of\n\nNazeer Ahamed equivalent to 0.63 cents having been allotted in the final\n\ndecree can be allotted in his favour cannot be countenanced as the agreement\n\nfor sale under Ex.A-1 suffers from suppression of material facts of other legal\n\nheirs of deceased K.M.Hanifa. There is no transfer of interest in immovable\n\nproperty under Ex.A-1 agreement for sale and it does not by itself create any\n\ninterest or charge on such property according to\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of\n\nProperty Act, 1882. For this proposition, the learned Counsel for the\n\nRespondent rely on the reported decision in 2021 (1) MWN (Civil) 316 (SC)\n\n[Venigalla Koteswaramma vs. Malampati Suryamba and others] wherein it is\n\nheld as under:\n\n“39. Apart from the above, it is also fundamental, as per\nSection 54\nof the\nTransfer of Property Act, 1882, that an agreement for sale of immoveable\nproperty does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such\nproperty vide Bank of India v. Abhay D. Narottam and others, 2005 (11)\nSCC 520. A person having an agreement for sale in his favour does not\nget any right in the property, except the right of obtaining sale deed on\nthat basis. For ready reference, we may reproduce Section 54 of the\n\n25/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nTransfer of Property Act\nthat reads as under: -\n\n“54. “Sale” defined.- “Sale” is a transfer of ownership in exchange for a\nprice paid or promised or part-paid and part- promised.\n\nSale how made.- Such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable\nproperty of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of\na reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered\ninstrument.\n\nIn the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one\nhundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registered\ninstrument or by delivery of the property. Delivery of tangible\nimmoveable property takes place when the seller places the buyer, or such\nperson as he directs, in possession of the property.\n\nContract for sale.- A contract for the sale of immoveable property is a\ncontract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled\nbetween the parties.\n\nIt does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property.”\n\n39.1. It goes without saying that the alleged agreement for sale did not\ninvest the vendee with title to, or any interest in, the property in question;\n\nand the alleged agreement for sale did not invest the vendee with any such\nright that the plaintiff could not have maintained her claim for partition in\nrespect of the properties left by Annapurnamma without seeking\ndeclaration against the agreement. Therefore, this plea about non-\nmaintainability of suit for want for relief of declaration against the said\nagreement for sale remains totally baseless and could only be rejected.”\n\n33. Further, the learned Counsel for the Respondents 1 to 6 submitted\n\nthat such claim is not legally enforceable as the sale agreement dated\n\n06.12.2006 under Ex.A-1 remains unregistered which is inadmissible for\n\nseeking protection under\nSection 53 (A)\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\nthough it can be received in evidence. This is in view of\nSection 17\n(1-\nA) of\n\nthe Registration Act, 1908\nwhich came into force with effect from 24.09.2001.\n\nFor this proposition, the learned Counsel for the Respondent relied on the\n\n26/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nreported decision in 2018 (\n5) LW 363 [Ameer Minhaj vs. Dierdre Elizabeth\n\n(Wright) Issar and others\n] wherein it has been held as under:\n\n“\nRegistration Act\n(1908),\nSection 17(1A)\n, Unregistered\nagreement.\n\nTransfer of Property Act\n, (1882),\nSection 53A\n, Unregistered\nagreement, part performance claim of.\n\nSpecific performance – Suit agreement – Nor registered\ndocument – Effect of\nDocument though exhibited, will bear an endorsement that it is\nadmissible only as evidence of the agreement to sell under the proviso\nto\nSection 49\nand shall not have any effect for the purposes of\nsection\n53A\n.\n\nTrial Court right in overturning the objection regarding marking\nand exhibiting these documents.\n\nIn other words, the core issue to be answered in the present\nappeal is whether the suit agreement dated 9th July 2003, on the basis\nof which relief of specific performance has been claimed, could be\nreceived as evidence as it is not a registered document.\nSection 17(1A)\n\nof the 1908 Act came into force with effect from 24th September, 2001\nWhereas, the suit agreement was executec subsequently on 9th July,\nIt is amply clear that the document containing contract to\ntransfer the right, title or interest in an immovable property for\nconsideration is required to be registered, if the party wants to rely on\nthe same for the purposes of\nSection 53A\nof the 1882 Act to protect its\npossession over the stated property, If it is not a registered document,\nthe only consequence provided in this provision is to declare that such\ndocument shall have no effect for the purposes of the said\nSection 53A\n\nof the 1882 Act.”\n\n34. Further, in order to receive the benefit of that section, it is\n\nmandatory for the Appellant to prove that possession is referred in agreement.\n\nPossession is not referred in Ex.A-1, but it is pleaded by him in the plaint, in\n\nthe suit for specific performance in O.S.

On perusal of the common judgment dated 29.04.2017 passed in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 and O.S.No.19 of 2015, the order dated 28.04.2022 passed\n\nin I.A.No.2 of 2018 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and from the cross examination of\n\nD.W-1, the Plaintiff-6 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 as D.W-1 in O.S.No.19 of 2015,\n\nRamu was a tenant under K.M.Hanifa and continued to be tenant under the\n\nlegal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. Therefore, he is aware of the details of the property\n\nregarding ownership. He is aware that K.M.Hanifa died and his legal heirs are\n\nthe owners of the property. While so, the Plaintiff Ramu entering into sale\n\nagreement with the elder son of K.M.Hanifa by name Nazeer Ahamed who is\n\nthe Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 (suit for partition) and the sole\n\nDefendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015 seeking the relief of specific performance of\n\ncontract for sale of the property is found fraudulent. Also it is an unregistered\n\nsale agreement deed. From the marking of documents, Ex.A-2 to Ex.A-7, it is\n\nfound that Ex.A-4 to Ex.A-6 are the earlier sale agreement deeds between\n\nNazeer Ahamed and the Plaintiff Ramu. What was the reason for getting fresh\n\nsale agreement in Ex.A-4 on 17.07.1997. Again as per Ex.A-5, he had entered\n\ninto sale agreement deed dated 15.03.1999. Again he had entered another\n\nagreement with Nazeer Ahamed as per Ex.A-6 dated 11.10.2004. So, there\n\n30/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nwere four (4) sale agreement deeds. Ex.A-1 is the sale agreement deed dated\n\n06.12.2006, based on which the suit was filed. Since the Plaintiff had not\n\napproached the Court with clean hands, the Civil Court had granted relief\n\nbased on principles of fairness, equity and good conscience. The Plaintiff\n\ncannot be granted the relief of specific performance of contract. The suit\n\nproperty is an extent of 3 acres and 44 cents for which the sale agreement was\n\nobtained. From one of the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa leaving behind him, the\n\nPlaintiffs and first Defendant in O.S.No.20 of 2010. Not only that,\n\nMohammedan Law does not have the principles of joint family which is\n\nrestricted only to Hindu Joint Family. Therefore, the claim in plaint in\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015 that there are no recitals that Nazeer Ahamed is entering\n\ninto sale agreement deed on behalf of all the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. Also\n\nas rightly pointed out by the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,\n\nthe Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015, Ramu had not obtained any authorisation\n\nletter authorising Nazeer Ahamed to act on their behalf to enter into contract\n\nregarding the property. While so, knowing fully well that K.M.Hanifa died, his\n\nlegal heirs have right over the property, the Plaintiff Ramu allegedly entering\n\ninto sale agreement deed dated 06.12.2006 with only one heir as per Ex.A-1 is\n\nfound unenforceable. After having paid Rs.2,30,000/- out of the total sale price\n\nof Rs.2,50,000/-, for the balance consideration of Rs.20,000/-, time stipulated\n\nfor payment of the balance amount for a period of one year is found fraudulent.\n\n31/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nThe Plaintiff Ramu is not entitled even for refund of the advance amount paid,\n\nRs.2,30,000/-. Still the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,\n\nCuddalore had granted alternate relief instead of dismissing the suit. Therefore,\n\nthe judgment of the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge decreeing\n\nthe suit for specific performance, at the same time, granting alternate relief of\n\nrefund of the advance amount is found just and proper. The grounds raised in\n\nthe grounds of Appeals that the judgment is not proper and is to be set aside is\n\nfound unacceptable. The grant of alternate relief in O.S.No.19 of 2015 is found\n\njustified.\n\n39. The Plaintiff Ramu examined as P.W-1 and marked documents\n\nunder Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-7. The Plaintiff Ramu was cross examined. In the cross\n\nexamination, the Plaintiff Ramu admits that he was aware that K.M.Hanifa\n\ndied leaving behind him, his wife, three daughters and three sons as legal heirs.\n\nHe had admitted clearly that he had not sought specific performance against the\n\nother legal heirs. He had also not attempted to interfere the contract of specific\n\nperformance based on the earlier agreements in 2004, 1999 and 1997. He had\n\nadmitted in all the earlier sale agreements that he had not obtained any\n\nsignature from the other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. He had stated that the one\n\nyear period for execution of the sale deed was agreed. Considering the fact that\n\nthe one of the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa was not in India, on his return, Nazeer\n\n32/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nAhamed claimed to execut the sale deed. Therefore one year period was\n\ngranted.\n\n40. The suggestion of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 that the sale agreement deed is fraudulent deed as the\n\nPlaintiff Ramu had not obtained any signature from other legal heirs of\n\nK.M.Hanifa was denied by the Plaintiff. The learned Judge had considered\n\nthose facts while assessing the evidence of Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015\n\nthereby refused to grant the relief of specific performance of contract for sale\n\nof the property.\n\n41. On perusal of Ex.A-1 unregistered sale agreement deed dated\n\n06.12.2006 marked in O.S.No.19 of 2015, only the name of Nazeer Ahamed is\n\nfound as one of the parties to sale agreement. As per the sale deed dated\n\n07.04.1969, which is marked as Ex.B-1, K.M.Hanifa purchased the property.\n\nAs per Ex.B-2 the kist paid in the name of the K.M.Hanifa dated 07.01.2010.\n\nEx.B-3 is the legal heirship certificate issued to the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa\n\nin the name of the Plaintiffs and Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 is found\n\ntrue. Under those circumstances, the Court has to necessarily grant preliminary\n\ndecree for partition as per the plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010. The\n\nclaim of the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 is proved by the evidence of D.W-\n\n33/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\n1 in O.S.No.19 of 2015. Instead of Nazeer Ahamed, the sole Defendant in\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015 who remained ex parte, the same Defendant as the\n\nDefendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010, he did not enter the witness box. Instead,\n\n6th Plaintiff in O.S.No.20 of 2010 had examined himself as D.W-1 in\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015. The plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and the written\n\nstatement in O.S.No.19 of 2015 was stated in the affidavit filed as examination\n\nin chief. The plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010 was put as suggestion to\n\nD.W-1.\n\n42. On perusal of the Ex.A-1, the sale agreement deed dated\n\n06.12.2006 there is no mention of sole Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015. The\n\nrecitals under Ex.A-1 does not mention that Nazeer Ahamed has entered into\n\nsale agreement on behalf of other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. Also, the conduct\n\nof the sole Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015, Nazeer Ahamed not entering\n\nwitness box and remained ex parte gives strong presumption against the\n\nDefendants. For 3 acres and 34 cents, a meagre amount of Rs.2,50,000/- was\n\nfixed. This is also a suspicious circumstance. Therefore, the learned I\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, granted relief based on\n\nfairness, equity and good conscience and not exercising the discretion in favour\n\nof Plaintiff Ramu in O.S.No.19 of 2015. The discussion of evidence by the\n\nlearned I Additional District and Sessions Judge is well reasoned, since one of\n\n34/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nthe legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa entered into sale agreement with Plaintiff Ramu\n\nis found to be fraudulent deed. Still the learned I Additional District and\n\nSessions Judge had granted relief of refund of advance amount of Rs.2,30,000/-\n\nagainst which the Plaintiff Ramu who had preferred Appeal in A.S.No.446 of\n\n2023. When Plaintiff Ramu had not approached the Court with clean hands, the\n\nCourt need not grant any relief in favour of the Defendant-2 in O.S.No.20 of\n\n2010.\n\n43. On analysing evidence, the learned trial Judge had arrived at a\n\nconclusion that the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 are entitled to one share for\n\neach of the daughters and two shares for the sons. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs\n\nwere granted 58/72 shares. Therefore, the shares entitled to Plaintiffs 1 to 6\n\nwas calculated as 58/72 shares.\n\n44. On proper appreciation of evidence and on perusal of documents\n\nunder Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-7 and Ex.B-1 to Ex.B-4, the learned Judge had granted\n\nthe preliminary decree to the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010. The facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case as gathered from records, invoking the\n\nMohammedan Law and Mohammedan Law of Succession, the Plaintiff cannot\n\nseek invocation of Hindu Law invoking the principles of joint family and on\n\nbasis of the joint family, the elder son of K.M.Hanifa/Defendant Nazeer\n\n35/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nAhamed entered into sale agreement with Plaintiff Ramu cannot be accepted.\n\nTherefore, as rightly pointed out when the sale agreement entered into only\n\nwith Nazeer Ahamed, the elder son of K.M.Hanifa, by the Plaintiff is found not\n\nfair. It was considered as fraudulent, then the Plaintiff is not entitled to any\n\nrelief under the\nSpecific Relief Act\n. The suit ought to have been dismissed.\n\nInstead the learned Judge had granted relief of refund of advance amount in\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015 whereas the learned Judge had granted preliminary decree\n\nfor partition of the Plaintiffs share as 58/72. The learned Judge granted\n\npreliminary decree to the Plaintiffs as 58 / 72 is not found erroneous. It is a\n\nwell reasoned judgment that does not warrant any interference by this Court.\n\n45. In A.S.No.555 of 2022 also, the Appellant/Defendant-2 in\n\nO.S.No. 20 of 2010 seeking to set aside the final decree date 28.04.2022 passed\n\nin I.A.No.2 of 2018 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 by by the learned I Additional\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore is found unacceptable as the learned\n\ntrial Judge had passed final decree in continuation of the preliminary decree.\n\nThe Advocate Commissioner was appointed and surveyed the property with the\n\nhelp of a Surveyor and filed the report. Based on the report of the Advocate\n\nCommissioner, the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge had\n\ngranted final decree which is agitated by the Defendant-2 in O.S.No.20 of 2010\n\n36/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nin continuation of the preliminary decree for partition to the Plaintiffs.\n\n46. During argument, the learned Counsel for the Appellant in\n\nA.S.No.555 of 2022 submitted that if the Court arrives at a conclusion that\n\nPlaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 are entitled to 58 /72 shares, then this Court\n\nexercising discretion shall pass judgment granting the relief of specific\n\nperformance for the share of the Defendant-1/Nazeer Ahamed in O.S.No.20 of\n\n2010. This is also found unenforceable as the other legal heirs are not willing\n\nto encumber the properties. The granting of the discretionary relief of specific\n\nperformance of sale of the property in O.S.No.19 of 2015 and restraining the\n\nshare of the Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 cannot be granted, since the\n\nother legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa had objected to the sale agreement entered into\n\nwith the Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010.\n\n47.

Therefore,\n\nhe has personal knowledge of the details of the family of K.M.Hanifa. While\n\nso, if he has bona fide intention of purchasing the property, he ought to have\n\nentered into agreement of sale with all the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa, the\n\nPlaintiffs in O.S.No. 20 of 2010. Earlier to that, he had obtained and ex parte\n\ndecree for specific performance of contract against the sole Defendant Nazeer\n\nAhamed, one of the legal heirs of the deceased K.M.Hanifa and the elder son\n\nof K.M.Kanifa. As per the evidence, Ex.A-4 dated 17.07.1997 is the earliest\n\nagreement entered into with Nazeer Ahamed. Ex.A-5 the same sale agreement\n\nrenewed on 15.03.1999. Ex.A-6 again the same sale agreement renewed as on\n\n11.10.2004.

Ex.A-1 is the latest sale agreement date 06.12.2006\n\nwhich is pressed into service in O.S.No.19 of 2015. When the Plaintiffs in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 came to know about the ex parte decree regarding specific\n\nperformance, they made enquiries and found out that the Plaintiff in O.S.No.\n\n38/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\n19 of 2015 had obtained ex parte decree in O.S.No.34 of 2009 before the\n\nlearned Sub Judge, Panruti. Therefore, the Plaintiffs in O.S.No. 20 of 2010\n\nwere forced to file the suit seeking partition against the elder son of\n\nK.M.Hanifa, the first Defendant in O.S. No.20 of 2010. Only after filing the\n\nsuit, they had sought transfer of the suit in O.S. No.34 of 2009 for joint trial in\n\nO.S.No. 20 of 2010 by filing transfer application before the learned Principal\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore. After setting aside the ex parte decree\n\nin O.S.No. 34 of 2009 only the suit was ordered on transfer to the learned I\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge to be tried along with O.S.No. 20 of\n\n2010. Meanwhile, before filing the suit for partition, the Plaintiff in O.S.No.\n\n20 of 2010 had filed O.S.No. 252 of 2009 before the learned Principal District\n\nMunsif, Panruti, seeking declaration that the suit schedule mentioned property\n\nis the undivided property of Plaintiffs as well as the second Defendant in\n\nO.S.No. 252 of 2009 and seeking permanent injunction restraining the first\n\nDefendant Ramu from interfering with the peaceful possession and the\n\nenjoyment of the suit property. Since suit in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and the suit in\n\nO.\nS. 19\nof 2015 (O.S.No.34 of 2009) were tried together, the suit in\n\nO.S.No.252 of 2009 was not taken up along with this suit. From the evidence,\n\nin the joint trial in O.S. No. 19 of 2015 and O.S.No.20 of 2010, it is found that\n\nthe Plaintiff Ramu in O.S.No. 19 of 2015 was a tenant under the Plaintiffs and\n\nprior to them under K.M.Hanifa and he had entered into agreement of sale in\n\n39/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nthe year 1997 immediately after the death of K.M.Hanifa for sale of the\n\nproperty.

Here, he had played fraud on the other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa\n\nby putting them in the dark.\n\n48. The Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 were surprised to know that\n\nNazeer Ahamed, the elder son of K.M.Hanifa, had entered into sale agreement,\n\nwith the Plaintiff Ramu, based on that, the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015 had\n\nobtained an ex parte decree which forced them to file the suit seeking\n\ninjunction against the Ramu before the learned Principal District Munsif under\n\nEx.A-7 (O.S.No.252 of 2009). Subsequently, they had filed a suit in O.S.No.\n\n20 of 2010 seeking partition against Nazeer Ahamed, the elder son of\n\nK.M.Hanifa. Also they had filed a petition to set aside the ex parte decree and\n\nto implead themselves as Defendants in O.S.No. 19 of 2015 to set aside the ex\n\npare decree in O.S.No.34 of 2009 before the learned Sub Judge, Panruti and\n\nalso simultaneously filing the Transfer Original Petition seeking transfer\n\nO.S.No. 34 of 2009 to the file of the learned I Additional District and Sessions\n\nJudge wherein they had filed a suit for partition.

In the\n\nprinciples of equity, a person who had approached the Court with unclean\n\nhands is not entitled to any relief from the Civil Court. By his conduct, he had\n\nplayed fraud on the other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa by entering into sale\n\nagreement in 1997 with Nazeer Ahamed and going on renewing the same over\n\na period of time as per E.A-4 to Ex.A-6.\nAll the sale agreements are\n\nunregistered sale agreements. Therefore, a person of such character cannot\n\nseek relief under equity. The rulings cited by the learned Counsel for the\n\nAppellants (Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015) are not applicable to a person who\n\nhad approached the Court with unclean hands.

Santhoshamma and another vs. D.\n\nSarala and another] and (iv) 2008-1-L.W. 696 [K.V. Narasimhan (died), etc\n\nand others vs. S.Salammal & another] are rejected.\n\n49. The rulings relied by the learned Counsel for the Respondents in\n\n(\ni) 2015 3 CTC 229 [Pemmada Prabhakar and others vs. Youngmen\n's Vysya\n\nAssociation and others]; (ii) 2021 (1) MWN (Civil) 316 (SC) [Venigalla\n\nKoteswaramma vs. Malampati Suryamba and others] and (iii) 2018 (5) LW\n\n41/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:\n29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\n363 [Ameer Minhaj vs. Dierdre Elizabeth (Wright) Issar and others\n] are\n\nfound applicable to the facts of this case in the circumstances as discussed\n\nabove. The claim of the Appellant regarding execution of the sale deed for 63\n\ncents, the share of Nazeer Ahamed alone and to grant the relief of specific\n\nperformance as per Ex.A-1 also is rejected. In the light of the arguments and\n\nrulings cited by the learned Counsel for the Respondents 1 to 6 (Plaintiffs in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010), the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa by the principle that the\n\nright of a co-owner, the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010, right of pre-emption to\n\npurchase the property, the share of Nazeer Ahamed, instead of creating\n\nencumbrance in favour of third parties, who are strangers to the family in\n\nenjoying the property.\n\nThe ruling relied on by the learned Counsel for the\n\nRespondents 1 to 6 reported in\n2018-5-L.W. 363 [Ameer Minhaj vs. Dierdre\n\nElizabeth (Wright) Issar and others\n] that an unregistered document cannot be\n\npressed into service seeking relief of specific performance of contract as per\n\nSection 17\n(1-\nA) of the Registration Act\nwhich came to force from 24th\n\nSeptember 2001.\nAlso the ruling cited by the learned Counsel for the\n\nRespondents in 2021 (1) MWN (Civil) 316 (SC) [Venigalla Koteswaramma\n\nvs. Malampati Suryamba and others] is squarely applicable to the facts of this\n\ncase. Therefore, the Appellant herein Ramu who is a Plaintiff in O.S. No.19 of\n\n2015 and Defendant-2 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 is not entitled to the relief of\n\nspecific performance. The Appeal against the final decree also is to be\n\n42/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\ndismissed in the light of the fact that the Plaintiff Ramu had approached the\n\nCourt with unclean hands since the learned I Additional District and Sessions\n\nJudge, Cuddalore had granted alternate relief of refund of the advance amount\n\npaid by the Plaintiff Ramu in O.S.No.19 of 2015 to the sole Defendant Nazeer\n\nAhamed. Also the Respondents in all the these Appeals in A.S.No.555 of\n\n2022, 445 and 446 of 2023 had filed memo agreeing to refund of the amount.\n\nIn the light of the above, all the three Appeals are to be dismissed confirming\n\nthe judgment of the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge, granting\n\nthe alternate relief of refund of advance amount paid by the Ramu the Plaintiff\n\nin O.S.No.19 of 2015.\n\n50. In the light of the above discussion from paragraphs 37 to 49, the\n\nfinal decree order dated 28.04.2022 passed in I.A.No.2 of 2018 in O.S.No.20 of\n\n2010 by the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, is a\n\nwell reasoned order which does not warrant any interference by this Court in\n\nthe light of the fact that the suit for specific performance was rejected and\n\ninstead alternate relief only granted by the learned I Additional District and\n\nSessions Judge, Cuddalore. Therefore, the grant of final decree based\n\npreliminary decree dated 29.04.2017 passed in O.S.No.20 of 2010 is justified.\n\nAccordingly, the point for determination in A.S.No.555 of 2022 is\n\nanswered in favour of the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010/Respondents\n\n43/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nherein and against the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015/Appellant herein.\n\n51. In the light of the above discussion from paragraphs 37 to 49, the\n\njudgment dated 29.04.2017 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 passed by the learned I\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, granting the relief of\n\npartition of 58/72 shares in favour of the Plaintiffs 1 to 6 is found proper. It is\n\na well reasoned judgment which does not warrant any interference by this\n\nCourt under Section 96 and\nOrder XLI of CPC\n. Accordingly, the point for\n\ndetermination in A.S.No.445 of 2023 is answered in favour of the Plaintiffs\n\nin O.S.No.20 of 2010/Respondents herein and against the Plaintiff in\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015/Appellant herein.\n\n52. In the light of the above discussion from paragraphs 37 to 49, the\n\njudgment of the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, in\n\nrefusing to grant the relief of specific performance of contract for sale in favour\n\nof the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015 and instead granting the alternate relief of\n\nrefund of advance amount is four proper. It is a well reasoned judgment which\n\ndoes not warrant any interference by this Court exercising discretion under\n\nSection 96 and\nOrder XLI of C.P.C\n. Accordingly, the point for\n\ndetermination in A.S.No.446 of 2023 is answered in favour of the Plaintiffs\n\nin O.S.No.20 of 2010/Respondents herein and against the Plaintiff in\n\n44/46\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/09/2025 11:48:47 am )\nA.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023\n\nO.S.No.19 of 2015/Appellant herein.\n\nIn the result, all the three Appeals are dismissed with cost throughout.\n\nThe fair and final order dated 28.04.2022 passed in I.A.No.2 of 2018 in\n\nO.S.No.20 of 2010 by the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,\n\nCuddalore is confirmed.
