Case No.-89 Year-2022 Thana- BALIYA District- Begusarai\n======================================================\nRaushan Kumar @ Raushan Tanti, S/o- Harkhit Tanti, Village-Shadipur\nDiyara, W.No-10, Ps-Balia, Dist-Begusarai\n... ... Petitioner/s\nVersus\nThe State of Bihar\n... ... Opposite Party/s\n======================================================\nAppearance :\nFor the Petitioner/s : Mr. Sudhanshu Bhushan, Advocate\nFor the Opposite Party/s : Mr. Satyendra Narayan Singh, APP\n======================================================\nCORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HARISH KUMAR\nORAL ORDER\n3 27-01-2025\nHeard learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the\n\npetitioner and Mr. Satyendra Narayan Singh, learned Additional\n\nPublic Prosecutor for the State.\n\n2. The application for grant of bail to the petitioner\n\nwho is in custody in connection with Balia P.S. Case No. 89 of\n\n2022 registered for the offence punishable under\nSections 302\n,\n\n304B\n,\n498A\n,\n,\n120B\nand\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\n3. Based upon the written report the prosecution\n\nalleges that the marriage of the daughter of the informant was\n\nsolemnized with the petitioner five years ago. On 30.03.2022, at\n\nabout 02:00pm, the petitioner has informed the informant that\n\nsome dispute has arisen between the petitioner and his wife and\n\nthus, request has been made to her to materialize the same.\n\nDespite the effort taken by the informant to contact her\n\ndaughter, she could not contact as her mobile phone came to be\nPatna High Court CR. MISC. No.84231 of 2024(3) dt.27-01-2025\n\n2/4\n\nswitched off. Soon thereafter, the informant alongwith other\n\nfamily members reached at the matrimonial home of the victim,\n\nbut they did not find her. It is further alleged that the petitioner\n\nalongwith other accused have killed the victim and her two\n\nfemale children and left the home. Prior to the alleged\n\noccurrence the deceased was subjected to demand of dowry.\n\n4. Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the\n\npetitioner contended that admittedly even as per the narrations\n\nmade in the FIR the informant was informed on 30.03.2022 and\n\nsoon thereafter she rushed to the matrimonial home, but\n\nsurprisingly, the FIR has been instituted on 01.04.2022, after a\n\ndelay of three days. The falsity of the case is also writ large for\n\nthe simple reason that during the course of investigation it has\n\ntranspired that the two daughters of the victim has been yet\n\nresiding with their grand-mother. It is the contention of the\n\npetitioner that in fact the victim has left her matrimonial home\n\nwithout giving any information to anyone on account of a trifle.\n\nThe dead body of the victim has neither been recovered, nor her\n\ntrace out could be find out during the course of investigation\n\nand, as such, there is no material to constitute any offence much\n\nless under\nSection 302\nand\n304B\nof the Indian Penal Code. It is\n\nlastly contended that the petitioner has been incarcerated since\n\n18.07.2024, having absolutely fair antecedent and he undertakes\nPatna High Court CR. MISC. No.84231 of 2024(3) dt.27-01-2025\n\n3/4\n\nbefore this Court that he will fully cooperate in the proceeding\n\nof the Court.\n\n5. On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor\n\nfor the State vehemently opposes the bail application and submits\n\nthat the petitioner happens to be husband of the deceased and his\n\ncomplicity cannot be ruled out, as he himself admitted the dispute\n\nbetween him and his wife, which resulting into causing her\n\ndisappearance. Moreover, there is a demand of dowry soon before\n\nher disappearance and, as such, an offence of dowry death as\n\nprovided under\nSection 304B\nof the Indian Penal Code, cannot be\n\nruled out.\n\n6. Regard being had to the submissions made on behalf of\n\nthe parties and considering the written report not based on correct facts\n\nof causing the death of two children; in as much there is no trace out of\n\nthe victim, whether alive or dead and the materials collected during the\n\ncourse of investigation are primarily based on suspicion of the\n\ncomplicity of the petitioner in the crime, coupled with the fair\n\nantecedent, let the petitioner, named above, be released on bail on or\n\nafter framing of the charge from the Court below itself on furnishing\n\nbail bonds of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand) with two sureties of\n\nthe like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate, Begusarai in connection with Balia P.S. Case No. 89 of\n\n2022, subject to the condition that one of the bailors will be the close\nPatna High Court CR. MISC. No.84231 of 2024(3) dt.27-01-2025\n\n4/4\n\nrelatives of the petitioner with further conditions which are as\n\nfollows:-\n\n(i) The petitioner will cooperate in conclusion of the\n\ntrial.\n\n(ii) He will remain present on each and every date of\n\ntrial till disposal of the case.\n\n(iii) He will not try to tamper with the evidence or\n\nintimidate the witnesses to delay the disposal of trial.\n\n(iv) In the event of default of two consecutive dates\n\nwithout any cogent reason, his bail bonds will liable to be\n\ncancelled.\n\n(v) The court below shall verify the criminal\n\nantecedent of the petitioner and in case, at any stage, it is found\n\nthat the petitioner has concealed his criminal antecedent, the\n\ncourt below shall take immediate step for cancelling the bail\n\nbond of the petitioner. However, the acceptance of bail bonds, in\n\nterms of the above-mentioned order, shall not be delayed for this\n\npurpose or in the name of verification.\n\n(Harish Kumar, J)\nsupratim/-\n\nU T",
