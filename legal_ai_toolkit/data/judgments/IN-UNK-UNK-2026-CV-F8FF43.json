The defendant\ncontended that it was possible to' divide the property by\nmetes and bounds but offered, if the Court took the contrary\nview, to purchase it at a valuation made by the Court, under\nthe provisions of\n s. 3\n of the Act. The Court appointed a\nCommissioner whose report showed that he had considerable\ndifficulty in suggesting a division. The Single Judge had\ngiven no final decision on the matter when an oral\napplication was made by the plaintiff for withdrawing the\nsuit with liberty to institute a fresh suit. The Judge held\nthat the suit could be withdrawn because no preliminary\ndecree had been passed and that a fresh suit could be\nbrought under the provisions of \nOrder 23 Rule 1 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure\n. The suit was dismissed as withdrawn.\nIn appeal the Division Bench held that the defendant had a\nvested right to purchase the property and reversed the\njudgment of the trial Court. In this Court it was urged on\nbehalf of the plaintiff's legal representatives that under\nOrder 23 Rule 1 there was an unqualified right to withdraw a\nsuit except that in certain limited circumstances where the\ndefendant had acquired a vested interest, the Court was not\nbound to allow withdrawal.\nDismissing the appeal,\nHELD : The true position under\n ss. 2\n and \n3\n of the Partition\nAct so far as O. 23, r. I \nC.P.C\n. is concerned must be\ndetermined in the light of the rule enunciated by Crump, J.,\nin Tukarama's case as that rule has seldom been doubted and\nthere is a large body of judicial opinion to support it. It\nwas observed by Crump J. that on wider considerations it\nmust be held that Plaintiff could not withdraw so as to\ndefeat the defendant's claim. He further pointed out that\nin a partition suit a defendant seeking a share is in the\nposition of a plaintiff and one plaintiff cannot withdraw\nwithout the permission. of another. [914B, D]\nUnder ss. 2 and 3 of the \nPartition Act\n, the various stages\nin the Proceedings would be as follows :\n1. In a suit, for partition if, it appears to the Court\nthat for the reasons stated in\n s. 2\n a division of the\nproperty cannot reasonably and conveniently be made and that\na sale of property would be more beneficial it can direct\nsale. Ibis can be done, however, only on the request of the\nshareholders interested individually or collectively to the\nextent of one moiety or upwards. (2) When a request is made\nunder s. 2 to the court to direct a sale any other\nshareholder can apply under\n s. 3\n for leave to buy at a\nvaluation the share of the other party asking for a sale.\n(3) The court has to order valuation of the share of the\nparty\n 905\nasking for sale. (4) After the valuation has been made the\ncourt has to, offer to sell the share of the party asking\nfor sale to the shareholders applying for leave to buy under\n\ns. 3\n. (5) If two or more shareholders, severally apply for\nleave to buy the court is bound to order a sale of the share\nor shares to the shareholder who offers to pay the highest\nprice above the valuation made by the court. (6) If no\nshareholder is willing to buy such share or shares at the\nprice so ascertained the application Linder\n s. 3\n shall be\ndismissed, the applicant being liable to pay all the costs.\n[914E-915A]\nAs soon as a shareholder applies for leave to, buy at a\nvaluation, the share of the party asking for a sale under\n s.\n3\n of the Partition Act he obtains an advantage in that the\ncourt is bound thereafter to order a valuation and after\ngetting the same done to offer to sell the same to such\nshareholder at the valuation so made. This advantage, which\nmay or may not fulfil the juridical meaning of a right, is\nnevertheless a privilege or a benefit which the law confers\non the shareholder. If the plaintiff is allowed to withdraw\nthe suit after the defendant has gained or acquired the\nadvantage or the privilege of buying the share of the\nplaintiff in accordance with the provisions of s.3(1) it\nwould only enable the plaintiff to defeat the purpose of s.\n3(1) and also to deprive the defendant of the above option\nor privilege which he has obtained by the plaintiff\ninitially requesting the court to sell the property under\n\ns.2\n instead of partitioning it. Apart from these\nconsiderations it would also enable the plaintiff in a\npartition suit to withdraw that suit and defeat the\ndefendant's claim which, according to Crump, J. Tukaram's\ncase cannot be done even in a suit where the provisions of\nthe \nPartition Act\n have not been invoked., [915G-916A]\nThe trial court bad prima facie come to the conclusion that\na division by metes and bounds was not possible. That was\nsufficient so far as the proceedings in the present case\nwere concerned.. The language of\n s.3\n of the Partition Act\ndoes not appear to make it obligatory on the court to give a\npositive finding that the property is incapable of division\nby metes and bounds. It should only 'appear' that it is not\nso capable of division. [916C]\n\nSection 3(1)\n does not contemplate a formal application being\nfiled, in every case. The words employed therein simply\nmean that the other shareholder has to inform the court or\nnotify to it that he is prepared to buy at a valuation the\nshare of the party asking for sale. In the written\nstatement of the defendant in the present case it was said\nthat even if the court held that the property was incapable\nof division into two shares the defendant was ready and\nwilling to buy the plaintiff's share in the suit at a\nvaluation to be made in such a manner as the court might\nthink proper. That was sufficient compliance with the,\nrequirements of\n s. 3\n of the Partition Act. [916F-G]\nTukaram Mahadu Tandel v.

Appeal\nNo. 108 of 1966.\n\nS. V. Gupte, P. Kothandaraman and G. N. Rao, for the\nappellant.\n\nS. T. Desai, A. subhashini and 4. V. Ranagam, for the\nrespondent.\n\nM. Natesan, N. C. Raghvachari and K. Javaram, for the\nintervener.\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n\nGrover, J. This is an appeal by certificate from a judgment\nof the Madras High Court arising out of a suit for partition\ninstituted on the original side of that court.\n\nRaja V. Rajeswara Rao\n the respondent herein and Raja V.\nMaheswara Rao (deceased) who were brothers owned the cinema\nknown as Odeon at Woods Road, Madras in equal shares. This\nproperty was leased out by them to Isherdas Sahni & Bros.\nIn 1965 Raja Maheswara Rao filed a suit in which it was\nstated that apart from other properties owned by the two\nbrothers Odeon Cinema which consisted of land, buildings,\ntheatre, furniture, talkie equipment etc. was owned by them\nin equal shares. The lease in favour of Isherdas Sahni &\nBros. was to expire on April 30, 1967. As we are concerned\nonly with the cinema property in the present case it is\nunnecessary to refer to the pleadings relating to other\nproperties belonging to the two brothers. In para 11 of the\nplaint it was pleaded that having regard to the nature of\nthe property it was not possible or feasible or convenient\nto divide it into two halves by metes and bounds. It was\nprayed that the court in exercise of its inherent\njurisdiction should direct the property to be sold by public\nauction and pay the plaintiff his I share in the net\nproceeds, the sale being subject to the lease in favour of\nIsherdas Sahni & Bros. In the written statement filed by\nRaja Rajeswara Rao it was denied that the Odeon Cinema\nproperty was not capable of division into two halves by\nmetes and bound& and it was averred that such a division was\nnot only possible but. it\n\n907\n\nwould be also just and proper. The right of the plaintiff\nin the suit to invoke the inherent powers of the court for a\ndecree for sale was denied. Paras 6 and 7 are reproduced\nbelow :\n\n \"6. The defendant submits that the suit\n property is very easily capable of division by\n metes and bounds into two shares. The\n defendant wants to retain his share of the\n suit property and he does not want to sell or\n Part with the property. The plaintiff is not\n entitled to a decree for sale of the suit\n property.\"\n\n 7. In the event of this Honourable Court\n holding that the suit property is incapable of\n division into two shares, the defendant\n submits that he is ready and willing to buy\n the plaintiff's share in the suit property and\n prays that this Honourable Court may be\n pleased to order a valuation of the\n plaintiff's share to be made in such manner as\n this Honourable Court may think fit and proper\n and offer to sell the said share to the\n defendant at the price so ascertained with\n suitable directions in that behalf. The\n defendant is willing to buy the plaintiff's\n share,'.\n\nPara 12 was to the effect that in the event of the court\nordering sale of the suit property a decree might be passed\nin favour of the defendant for the purchase of the\nplaintiffs share at a valuation determined by the court. On\nJuly 26, 1965 the Court appointed a Commissioner for the\npurpose of determining various matters which would enable\nthe court to decide whether the property was capable of\ndivision by metes and bounds. It appears that before the\nCommissioner the defendant consistently pressed for a scheme\nbeing suggested by which division of the property in dispute\ncould be effected. The report of the Commissioner dated\nAugust 27, 1965 indicates that he had considerable\ndifficulty in suggesting a division. This is what he said :\n\n \" My submission would therefore be\n that though the property could be divided in\n the manner desired by thedefendant the space\n which is shown as GI........ its situation is\n such that business of the type contemplated by\n the defendant could not be started therein\n without detriment to the functioning of the\n theatre'.\n\nIt is clear from the order of the learned Single Judge that\nthe prima facie impression which he had formed after\ninspection of the property was that it was not capable of\ndivision by metes and bounds. He had given no final,\ndecision on the matter when an oral application was made by\nthe plaintiff for withdrawing the suit with liberty to\ninstitute a fresh suit. An objection was raised before the\ntrial judge that because the defendant bad invoked the\n\n908\n\nprovisions of\n s. 3\n of the Partition Act the plaintiff could\nnot be permitted to withdraw the suit. The trial judge,\nhowever, took the view that so long as a preliminary decree\nhad not been passed in the partition suit it was open to the\nplaintiff to withdraw the same. Considering the question\nwhether liberty should be granted to bring a fresh suit\nunder Order 23, Rule 1, the trial judge treated it to be\naxiomatic that in a suit for partition or redemption when a\nplaintiff withdraws his suit he will be entitled to file a\nfresh suit as the cause of action is' a recurring one. This\nis what the trial judge said :-\n\n \"Even if the plaintiff is not granted\n permission, under Order 23, rule 1, Civil\n Procedure Code, he will nevertheless have a\n right to file a suit for partition at any time\n he pleases. In view of this obvious right of\n the plaintiff, it has to be held that the\n plaintiff is entitled, particularly, in terms\n of Order 23, Rule 1, to bring a fresh suit.\"\n\n The suit was dismissed as withdrawn.\n\nOn October 14, 1966, Raja Maheswara Rao sold his half share\nin Odeon to N. C. Subramaniam and his sons who in their turn\nsold that share to Isherdas Sahni & Bros. (P) Ltd. on\nJanuary 19, 1970. Raja Rajeswara Rao who was defendant in\nthe original suit filed an appeal to the Division Bench of\nthe High Court. During the pendency of the appeal the\nplaintiff died leaving a will and by an order passed by the\ncourt on October 13, 1967 the executor appointed by the\nplaintiff under the will was impleaded as second respondent\nin the appeal.\n\nThe Division Bench of the High Court considered that the\nfollowing question arose for determination :\n\n (1) Whether the court has an inherent power\n of sale of the property which is not capable\n of division apart from the provisions of the\n \nPartition Act\n and whether the plaintiff\n invoked only such an inherent power and not\n the power under\n s. 2\n of the aforesaid Act.\n (2) Whether the plaintiff having invoked the\n jurisdiction of the court under\n s. 2\n of the\n Partition Act is entitled to withdraw the suit\n under Order 23, Rule 1 of the, Civil Procedure\n Code at the same time reserving his right to\n file a fresh suit on the same cause of action.\n (3) At what stage should the request under\n s. 2 be made and\n (4) Has the defendant who has invoked the\n jurisdiction of this Court under\n s. 3\n of the\n Partition Act an indefeasible right to compel\n the plaintiff to sell the, plain-\n\n 909\n\n tiff's half share to him at a valuation and\n prevent the plaintiff from withdrawing the\n suit ?\n\nOn the first question the High Court expressed the view that\nthe \nPartition Act\n conferred on the court in a suit for\npartition a power of sale in certain specified\ncircumstances. No general power of sale could be spelt out\nfrom the provisions of that Act. It was hold that\n s. 2\n of\nthe Partition Act had been invoked by the, plaintiff and the\nplaintiff could not withdraw a suit in the circumstances of\nthe present case. It was further held that the request of\nthe defendant under\n s. 3(1)\n of the Partition Act must be\ninquired into by the trial judge. Accordingly the appeal\nwas allowed and the trial judge was directed to restore the\nsuit to his file and frame the necessary additional issue\nand proceed to dispose of the request made by the defendant\nunder s. 3(1) of the Act in accordance with law. The\npresent appeal has been brought against that judgment.\nDuring the pendency of the appeal in this Court Ramamurthi\nIyer the executor appointed by the will of late Raja\nMaheswara Rao, who had filed the appeal here, died on\nDecember 24, 1971. Smt. J. Padmini wife of M. Jayaraj\nfiled C. M. P. 2227/72 for being brought on record as the\nsecond appellant on the ground that she was the only person\ncompetent to represent the estate of the deceased Raja\nMaheswara Rao. Another petition C. M. P. 1781/72 was filed\nin this Court by Isherdas Sahni & Bros. (P) Ltd. on the\nground that the said company was the assignee of late Raja\nMaheswara Rao and was still his legal representative and\nshould be impleaded in his place. On July 18, 1972 this\nCourt allowed Smt. Padmini to be impleaded as appellant but\ndeclined the prayer for substitution as appellant of\nIsherdas Sahni & Bros. (P) Ltd. The company was, however,\nallowed to intervene in the appeal.\n\nLearned counsel for the parties agreed before us that the\nonly question which survives and which requires our decision\nis whether in the circumstances of the present case the\ntrial court could allow withdrawal of the suit. This\ninvolves the determination of the correct position under\n\nOrder 23, Rule 1 of the C.P.C\n., in respect of a suit for\npartition of joint property in which the provisions of the\n\nPartition Act\n have been invoked or are sought to be applied.\nOrder 23, Rule 1, of the C. P. C., to the extent it is\nmaterial, is as follows\n \"O.23, R. 1. At any time after the\n institution of the suit the plaintiff may, as\n against all or any of the defendants, withdraw\n his suit or abandon part of his claim.\n\n R. 2. Where the Court is satisfied-\n\n (a) that a suit must fail by reason of some\n formal defect, or\n\n 910\n\n (b) that there are other sufficient grounds\n for allowing the plaintiff to institute a\n fresh suit for the subject matter of a suit or\n part of a claim.\n\n it may, on such terms as it thinks fit, grant\n the plaintiff Permission to withdraw from such\n suit or abandon such part of a claim with\n liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect\n of the subject-matter of such suit or such\n part of a claim.\n\n R..3.................\".\n\nIn \nBijayananda Patnaik v. Satrughna Sahu & Others\n(1) in\nwhich an election appeal was sought to be withdrawn it was\nobserved that where an application for withdrawal of a suit\nis made under O.23, R. 1 (1), the court has to allow that\napplication and the suit stands withdrawn. It is only under\nsub-rule (2) where a suit is not being withdrawn absolutely\nbut is being withdrawn on condition that the plaintiff may\nbe permitted to institute a fresh suit for the same subject\nmatter that the permission of the court for such withdrawal\nis necessary.\n \nIn \nHulas Rai Baij Nath v. Firm K. B. Dass &\nCo.\n(2) a suit for rendition of accounts had been filed. The\ndefence was that the accounts had been settled before any\npreliminary decree for rendition of accounts was passed.\nThe plaintiff applied for withdrawal of the suit. This\nCourt held that there was no ground on which the court could\nrefuse to allow withdrawal of the suit because no vested\nright in favour of the defendant had come into existence at\nthe point of time when withdrawal was sought. Certain\nsituations were envisaged where ,different considerations\nmight arise e.g., where a set off might have been claimed\nunder O.8 \nof the C.P.C\n. or a counter claim might have been\nfiled. Even if the defendant in a suit for rendition of\naccounts could claim a decree for the amount due to him\nafter rendition of accounts no such right could possibly he\nheld to exist before the court passed a preliminary decree\nfor rendition of accounts. It was particularly noted that\nin the case of a suit between principal and agent it was the\nprincipal alone who normally had the right to claim\nrendition of accounts from the agent.\n\nCounsel for both sides have sought- to derive support from\nthe above decisions of this Court. On behalf of the\nappellant it has been contended that under O.23, R. 1 there\nis an unqualified right to withdraw the suit if the\nplaintiff does not wish to proceed with it. It is conceded\nthat if any vested right comes into, existence before the\nprayer for withdrawal is made the court is not bound to\nallow withdrawal; but it is suggested that this can happen\nonly in very limited circumstances i.e., where a Preliminary\ndecree had been passed or in those cases whether a set off\nhas been claimed or a counter claim has been made.\nAccording to the appellant no preliminary decree bad been\npassed in the present suit and\n(1) [1964] 2 S.C.R. 538.\n\n(2) [1967] 3 S.C.R. 886.\n\n911\n\nthus no vested right had come into existence in favour of\nthe defendant. There was no question of any counter claim\nor set off and therefore the trial court was fully justified\nin allowing withdrawal of the suit. If the matter were to\nbe viewed only in the above light the appellant's contention\nwould have 'a good 'deal of force. But the nature and\nincidents of a Partition suit and the consequences which\nensue once the provisions of the \nPartition Act\n are invoked\nor sought to be applied must be considered before the\ncontentions of the appellant's counsel can be accepted.\n\nThe Partition Act\n was enacted to amend the law relating to\npartition. \nSections 2\n and \n3\n are as follows :-\n\n \nS. 2\n. \"Whenever in any suit for partition\n in which, if instituted prior to the\n commencement of this Act, a decree for\n partition might have been made, it appears to\n the Court that, by reason of the nature of the\n property to which the suit relates, or of the\n number of the shareholders therein, or of any\n other special circumstance, a division of the,\n property cannot reasonably or conveniently be\n made, and that a sale of the property and\n distribution of the proceeds would be more\n beneficial for all the shareholders, the Court\n may, if it thinks fit, on the request of any\n of such shareholders interested individually\n or collectively to the extent of one moiety or\n upwards, direct a sale of the property and a\n distribution of the proceeds.\n\n \nS. 3 (1)\n If, in any case in which the Court\n is requested under the last foregoing section\n to direct a sale, any other shareholder\n applies for leave to buy at a valuation the\n share or shares of the party or parties asking\n for a sale, the Court shall order a valuation\n of the share or shares in such manner as it\n may think fit and offer to sell the same to\n such shareholder at the price so ascertained,and\n may give all necessary and proper directions\n in that behalf.\n\n (2) If two or more shareholders, severally\n apply for\n leave to buy as provided in sub-section (1)\n the Court shall order a sale of the share or\n shares to the shareholder who offers to pay\n the highest price above the valuation made by\n the Court.\n\n (3) If no such shareholder is willing to buy\n such share or shares at the price so\n ascertained, the applicant or applicants shall\n be liable to pay all costs of or incident to\n the application or applications.\"\n\n912\n\nThe scheme of\n ss. 2\n and \n3\n apparently is that if the nature\nof the property is such or the number of shareholders is so\nmany or if there is any other special circumstance and a\ndivision of the property cannot reasonably or conveniently\nbe made, the court can in its discretion on the request of\nany of the shareholders interested individually or\ncollectively to the extent of one moiety or upwards direct a\nsale of the property and distribute the proceeds among the\nshareholders. Now when a court has been requested under \nS.\n2\n to direct a sale 'any other shareholder can apply for\nleave to by at a valuation the share or shares of the party\nor parties asking for sale. In such a situation it has been\nmade obligatory that the court shall order a valuation of\nthe share or shares and offer to sell the same to the\nshareholder who has applied for leave to buy the share at a\nprice ascertained by the court. other words if a-plaintiff\nin a suit for partition has invoked the power of the court\nto order sale instead of division in a partiton suit under\n\nS. 2\n and the other shareholder undertakes to buy at a\nvaluation the share of the party asking for sale the court\nhas no option or choice or discretion left to it any it is\nbound to order a valuation of the shares in question and\noffer to sell the same to the shareholder undertaking or\napplying to buy it at a valuation. The purpose underlying\nthe section undoubtedly appears to be to prevent the\nproperty falling into the hands of third parties if that can\nbe done in a reasonable manner. It would appear from the\nobjects and reasons for the enactment of the \nPartition Act\n\nthat as the law stood the court was bound to give a share to\neach of the parties and could not direct a sale or division\nof the proceeds. There could be, instances where \"there\nwere insuperable practical difficulties in the way of making\nan equal division and the court was either powerless to give\neffect to. its decree or was- driven to all kinds of shifts\nand expedient in order to do so. The court was,\ntherefore, given a discretionary authority to direct a salt\nwhere. a partition could not reasonably be made and the sale\nwould, in the opinion of the court, be more beneficial to\nthe parties. But having regard to the strong attachment of\nthe people in this country to their landed possessions the\nconsent of the parties interested at least to the extent of\na moiety in the property was made a condition precedent to\nthe exercise by the court of the new power. At the same\ntime in order to prevent any oppressive exercise of this\nprivilege those shareholders who did not desire a sale were\ngiven a right to buy the others out at a valuation to be\ndetermined by the court.\n\nA question immediately arises whether after a shareholder\nhas applied for leave to buy at a valuation under\n S. 3\n the\nother shareholder who has requested the court to exercise\nits power under\n s. 2\n of ordering sale can withdraw the suit\nunder Order 23, Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code. The-\nanswer to this question will\n\n913\n\ndepend on the nature of the right or privilege which vests\nin the co-sharer to seek to derive benefit of the provisions\nof s. 3. In some of the decided cases a choice or option\ngiven to the shareholder under\n s. 3\n has been treated as a\nright or a privilege. See Jhamandas Lilaram v. Mulchand\nPahlumal(1) and Nitish Chandra Ghosh v. Promode Kunwr Ghosh.\n(2) It was argued on behalf of the appellant that even if a\nright or privilege is conferred by\n s. 3\n on a shareholder\nonce the other shareholder has invoked the procedure\nprescribed by\n s. 2\n of the, Partition Act it is not a vested\nright which can come into existence only if a preliminary\ndecree has been passed by the court or if a mutual,\ncompromise has been effected between the parties. Our\nattention has been invited to the decisions of this court\nmentioned before in which the passing of a preliminary\ndecree or a compromise being effected were treated as\ncreating a vested right which prevented the plaintiff in a\nsuit for partition from withdrawing it if the other share-\nholders were not agreeable. \nAccording to the learned\ncounsel for the appellant the only decision in. which the\npoint under consideration has been directly considered is\nthat of Viswanatha Sastri J., in \nHasan Badsha v. Sultan\nRaziah Begum\n. (3) There both parties had conceded that the\nproperty was incapable of being divided by metes and bounds\nand that it should be sold under the provisions of the\n\nPartition Act\n. The defendant applied to Purchase the\nproperty under\n s. 3\n. A Commissioner was also appointed to\nreport whether the property was capable of division and lie\nreported that it could not be divided by metes and bounds.\nThe plaintiff sought to withdraw the suit. It was held that\nhe was entitled to do so because the court had not made a\nvaluation and an order that the half share of the plaintiff\nshould be conveyed to the defendant on the valuation\ndetermined by the court. It might be that an advantage had\naccrued to the defendant as regards the admissions made in\nthe plaint about the impracticability of dividing the\nproperty. That did not clothe the defendant with any\nenforceable right and did not prevent the plaintiff from\nexercising the right of a suitor to withdraw the suit. This\nauthority has also been strongly relied upon for the\nsimilarity of facts in the present case. Here also, it is\npointed out', the court had not come to the conclusion that\nthe Property was incapable of division by metes and bounds\nnor had any valuation been made or order passed for its sale\nunder\n s. 3\n of the Partition Act.

Ramchandra Mahadu Tandel\n (1)\nhave been cited in support of the above submission :\n\n \"But there are other and wider considerations\n which lead me to hold that plaintiff could not\n have withdrawn so as to defeat the defendants'\n claim. It is relevant to point out that in a\n partition suit a defendant seeking a share is\n in the position of a plaintiff and one\n plaintiff cannot withdraw without the\n permission of another (Order XXIII, Rule 1(4)\n )\".\n\nIt has further been emphasised that in a partition suit the\nplaintiff is not wholly dominus litis and even on the\nassumption that\n s. 3\n confers a privilege or an option on the\nshareholder who is a defendant in a suit for partition the\nplaintiff is debarred from defeating the exercise of that\nprivilege or option by resorting to the device of\nwithdrawing a suit under Order 23 Rule 1.\n\nIt seems to us that the true position under\n ss. 2\n and \n3\n of\nthe Partition Act so far as O. 23, r. 1 \nC.P.C\n., is concerned\nmust be determined in the light of the rule enunciated by\nCrump I.\n, \nin \nthe above case\n as that rule has seldom been\ndoubted and there is a large body of judicial opinion to\nsupport it. (See the cases at page 224, Law of Co-Sharers by\nD. N. Guha). The various stages in the proceedings would be\nas follows under ss. 2 and 3 of the Partition Act\n\n 1. In a suit for partition if, it appears to\n the Court\n that for the reasons stated in\n S. 2\n a division\n of the property cannot reasonably and\n conveniently be made and that a sale of\n property would be more beneficial it can\n direct sale. This can be done, however, only\n on the request of the shareholders interested\n individually or collectively to the extent of\n one moiety or upwards.\n\n 2. When a request is made under\n s. 2\n to the\n court to direct a sale any other shareholder\n can apply under\n S. 3\n for leave to buy at a\n valuation the share of the other party asking\n for a sale.\n\n 3. The court has to order valuation of the\n share of the party asking for sale.\n\n 4. After the valuation has been made the\n court has to offer to sell the share of the\n party asking for sale to the shareholder\n applying for leave to buy under\n S. 3\n.-\n\n 5. If two or more shareholders severally\n apply for leave to buy the court is bound to\n order a sale of the share or shares so the\n shareholder who offers to pay the highest\n price above the valuation made by the court.\n (1) I.L.R. 49 Bom. 672.\n\n 915\n\n 6. If no shareholder is willing to buy\n such share or shares at the price so\n ascertained the application under\n s. 3\n shalt\n be dismissed, the applicant being liable to\n pay all the costs.\n\nA question which presents a certain amount of difficulty is\nat what stage the other shareholder acquires a privilege or\na right. under s. 3 when proceedings are pending in a\npartition suit and a request has been made by a co-owner\nowning a moiety of share that a sale be held. One of the\nessential conditions for the applicability of\n s. 2\n of the\nPartition Act is that it should appear to the court that a\ndivision of the property cannot reasonably or conveniently\nbe made. To attract the applicability of\n s. 3\n all that the\nlaw requires is that the other shareholder should apply for\nleave to buy at a valuation. Once that is done the other\nmatters mentioned in\n s. 3\n ( 1 ) must follow and the court is\nleft with no choice or option. In other words when the\nother shareholder applies for leave to buy at a valuation\nthe share of the party asking for a sale the court is bound\nto order valuation of his share and offer to sell the same\nto such shareholder at a price so ascertained.\nComing back to the question of withdrawal of a suit in which\nthe provisions of\n ss. 2\n and \n3\n of the Partition Act have been\ninvoked we find it is difficult to accede to the contention\nof the appellant that the suit can be withdrawn by the\nplaintiff after he has himself requested for a sale under\n s.\n2\n of the Partition Act and the defendant has applied to the\ncourt for leave to buy at a valuation the share of the\nplaintiff under s. 'J. In England the position about\nwithdrawal has been stated thus, in the Supreme Court\nPractice 1970 at page 334 :-\n\n \"Before Judgment.-Leave may be refused to a\n plaintiff to discontinue the action if the\n plaintiff is not wholly dominus litis or if\n the defendant has by the proceedings obtained\n an advantage of which it does not seem just to\n deprive him\".\n\nAs soon as a shareholder applies for leave to buy at a\nvaluation the share of the party asking for a sale under s.\n3 of the \nPartition Act\n he obtains an advantage in that the\ncourt is bound thereafter to order a valuation and after\ngetting the same done to offer to sell the same to such\nshareholder at the valuation so made. This advantage, which\nmay or may not fulfil the juridical meaning of a right, is\nnevertheless a privilege or a benefit which the law confers\non the shareholder. If the plaintiff is allowed to withdraw\nthe suit after the defendant has gained or acquired the\nadvantage or the privilege of buying the share of the\nplaintiff in accordance with the provisions of\n s. 3(1)\n it\nwould only enable the plaintiff to defeat the purpose of s.\n3 (1) and also to deprive the defendant of the above option\nor privilege which he has obtained by the plaintiff\ninitially requesting the court to sell the property under\n\n916\n\nS.2\n instead of partitioning it. Apart from these\nconsideration it would also enable the plaintiff in a\npartition suit to withdrawal that suit and defeat the\ndefendants claim which, according to Crump cannot be done\neven in a suit where the provisions of the \nPartition Act\n\nhave not been invoked.\n\nIn the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant em-\nphasis has been laid on the fact that in the present case\nthe court did not give any finding that the property was not\ncapable of division by metes and bounds. It is thus pointed\nout that the essential condition for the application of\n s. 2\n\nof the Partition Act had not been satisfied and\n S. 3\n cannot\nbe availed of by the respondent unless it had first been\nfound that the property could be put to sale in the light of\nthe provisions of s. 2. This submission has hardly any\nsubstance inasmuch as the trial court had prima facie come\nto the conclusion that a division by' metes and bounds was\nnot possible. That was sufficient so far as the proceedings\nin the present case were concerned. The language of\n s. 3\n of\nthe Partition Act does not appear to make it obligatory on\nthe court to give a positive finding that the property is\nincapable of division by metes and bounds. It should only\n\"appear\" that it is not so capable of division. It has\nfurther been contended that the respondent had maintained\nthroughout that the property was capable of division. He\ncould not, therefore, take advantage of the provisions of\nthe \nPartition Act\n. Further he never made any proper\napplication invoking the provisions of\n s. 3\n of the Partition\nAct and all that he said in his written statement, was that\nin case the court held that the said property was incapable\nof division into two shares he Was ready and willing to buy\nthe plaintiff's share in the suit at a valuation to be made\nin such a manner as the court might think proper. In our\nopinion, this was sufficient compliance with the requirement\nof s. 3 of the \nPartition Act\n. \nSection 3(1)\n does not\ncontemplate a formal application being filed in every case.\nThe words employed therein simply' mean that the other\nshareholder has to inform the court or notify to it that he\nis prepared to buy at a valuation the share of the party\nasking for sale. In the written statement even if it was\nmaintained that the property was not capable of division by\nmetes and bounds the alternative prayer was necessarily made\nin para 7 which would satisfy the requirements of\n S. 3\n of\nthe Partition Act.\n\nOur attention has been invited by the learned counsel for\nthe appellant to certain English decisions and in particular\nto the case of Peter Pitt & Others v. Thomas Webb Jones(1)\nand the statement in Halsbury's Laws of England vol. 24,\nSecond Edition (Hailsham Edn.) paras 745 to 747. It has\nbeen pointed out that in the \nEnglish Partition Act\n 1868 (31,\n32 Victoriae, Cap. 40) ss. 3 and 5 are similar in terms to\n\nss. 2\n and \n3\n of the Indian\n(1) 5 A.C. 651.\n\n917\n\nPartition Act\n. The statement in Halsbury's Laws of England\nand the law laid down in the decided cases, it is urged, do\nnot support the view which has been pressed on behalf of\nthe respondent. The view expressed was that the court had a\ndiscretionary jurisdiction if any interested party requested\nfor sale to order sale notwithstanding the dissent or the\ndisability of any other party, if it appeared to the court\nthat it would be more beneficial for the parties interested.\nThe provisions of the English Partition Act do not appear to\nbe in parimutuel with those of the Indian Partition Act and\nwe do not consider that any assistance can be derived from\nthe English law on the points which are being determined by\nus.\n\nIn the result the appeal fails and it is dismissed. But in\nview of the entire circumstances we leave the parties to\nbear their own costs in this Court.\n\nG.C,\nAppeal dismissed.\n\n918",

The defendant\ncontended that it was possible to' divide the property by\nmetes and bounds but offered, if the Court took the contrary\nview, to purchase it at a valuation made by the Court, under\nthe provisions of\n s. 3\n of the Act. The Court appointed a\nCommissioner whose report showed that he had considerable\ndifficulty in suggesting a division. The Single Judge had\ngiven no final decision on the matter when an oral\napplication was made by the plaintiff for withdrawing the\nsuit with liberty to institute a fresh suit. The Judge held\nthat the suit could be withdrawn because no preliminary\ndecree had been passed and that a fresh suit could be\nbrought under the provisions of \nOrder 23 Rule 1 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure\n. The suit was dismissed as withdrawn.\nIn appeal the Division Bench held that the defendant had a\nvested right to purchase the property and reversed the\njudgment of the trial Court. In this Court it was urged on\nbehalf of the plaintiff's legal representatives that under\nOrder 23 Rule 1 there was an unqualified right to withdraw a\nsuit except that in certain limited circumstances where the\ndefendant had acquired a vested interest, the Court was not\nbound to allow withdrawal.\nDismissing the appeal,\nHELD : The true position under\n ss. 2\n and \n3\n of the Partition\nAct so far as O. 23, r.

No general power of sale could be spelt out\nfrom the provisions of that Act. It was hold that\n s. 2\n of\nthe Partition Act had been invoked by the, plaintiff and the\nplaintiff could not withdraw a suit in the circumstances of\nthe present case. It was further held that the request of\nthe defendant under\n s. 3(1)\n of the Partition Act must be\ninquired into by the trial judge. Accordingly the appeal\nwas allowed and the trial judge was directed to restore the\nsuit to his file and frame the necessary additional issue\nand proceed to dispose of the request made by the defendant\nunder s. 3(1) of the Act in accordance with law. The\npresent appeal has been brought against that judgment.\nDuring the pendency of the appeal in this Court Ramamurthi\nIyer the executor appointed by the will of late Raja\nMaheswara Rao, who had filed the appeal here, died on\nDecember 24, 1971. Smt. J. Padmini wife of M. Jayaraj\nfiled C. M.

It is only under\nsub-rule (2) where a suit is not being withdrawn absolutely\nbut is being withdrawn on condition that the plaintiff may\nbe permitted to institute a fresh suit for the same subject\nmatter that the permission of the court for such withdrawal\nis necessary.\n \nIn \nHulas Rai Baij Nath v.

The\ndefence was that the accounts had been settled before any\npreliminary decree for rendition of accounts was passed.\nThe plaintiff applied for withdrawal of the suit. This\nCourt held that there was no ground on which the court could\nrefuse to allow withdrawal of the suit because no vested\nright in favour of the defendant had come into existence at\nthe point of time when withdrawal was sought. Certain\nsituations were envisaged where ,different considerations\nmight arise e.g., where a set off might have been claimed\nunder O.8 \nof the C.P.C\n. or a counter claim might have been\nfiled.
