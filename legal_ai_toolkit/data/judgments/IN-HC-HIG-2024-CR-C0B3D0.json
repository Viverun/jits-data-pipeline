It has been asserted that the petitioner was\n\narrested vide FIR No. 64 of 2024, dated 22.05.2024, registered at\n\nPolice Station Shahpur, District Kangra, H.P. for the commission\n\nof offences punishable under\nSections 376\n,\n,\nand\nof\n\nthe Indian Penal Code (\nIPC\n). As per the prosecution, the victim\n\ncame out of her home on hearing the noise on 18.05.2024, in the\nWhether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the judgment? Yes.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\nnight at 12:00 O'clock. A boy ran towards her home. The\n\npetitioner also came to her home and assaulted her. The\n\n.\n\npetitioner thought that the boy had come to meet the victim.\n\nThe petitioner assaulted and raped the victim. He also\n\nthreatened the victim. She remained silent. However, the\n\npetitioner started defaming her in the locality and started saying\n\nthat he would again rape her. Hence, the victim made a report to\n\nthe police. The police registered the FIR and arrested the\n\npetitioner. The petitioner is innocent and he was falsely\n\nimplicated. The prosecution story is highly improbable. The\n\npetitioner had only asked the victim about the person with\n\nwhom she was talking in the middle of the night. The person ran\n\naway and the victim falsely implicated the present petitioner.\n\nThe victim made a false complaint after four days to save\n\nherself. The victim is married and was unable to explain why she\n\nwas found with a stranger at midnight. The investigation is\n\ncomplete and no recovery is to be effected from the petitioner.\n\nThe petitioner is a permanent resident of District Kangra, HP\n\nand there is no likelihood of his absconding. The petitioner\n\nwould abide by all the terms and conditions, which may be\n\nimposed by the Court. Hence, the petition.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n2. The petition is opposed by filing a status report\n\nasserting that the victim made a complaint to the police stating\n\n.\n\nthat a quarrel had taken place in front of her house on\n\n18.05.2024 at 12:00 am. The victim came out of the house. One\n\nboy ran towards her home. The petitioner Lucky Kumar also\n\ncame to her home. He gave beatings to her because he thought\n\nthat the boy had visited her house to meet her. The petitioner\n\nraped the victim and threatened to kill her in case the incident\n\nwas revealed to any person. However, the petitioner was\n\ndefaming her and threatening to rape her. The police registered\n\nthe FIR and arrested the petitioner. The victim and the\n\npetitioner were medically examined and samples were\n\npreserved. As per the investigation, the victim and petitioner\n\nbelong to the same village. The petitioner got recovered the stick\n\nwith which he had beaten the victim. The result of the analysis is\n\nawaited. The petitioner has been in custody since 22.05.2024.\n\n3. I have heard Mr. Vijender Katoch, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner and Ms. Ayushi Negi, learned Deputy Advocate\n\nGeneral, for the respondent-State.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n4. Mr Vijender Katoch, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner submitted that the prosecution version is highly\n\n.\n\nimprobable. The incident had occurred in the middle of the night\n\nwhen a quarrel has taken place. It is unlikely that the petitioner\n\ncould have raped the victim when the noise could have attracted\n\nthe villagers. The victim would have shouted for help and\n\ngathered the people. The whole story is false and was made to\n\ndivert attention from the fact that the victim was seen with the\n\nstranger at her home in the middle of the night. Therefore, he\n\nprayed that the present petition be allowed and the petitioner be\n\nreleased on bail.\n\n5. Ms. Ayushi Negi, learned Deputy Advocate General\n\nfor the respondent-State submitted that the petitioner had\n\nraped the victim by entering into her house in the middle of the\n\nnight. Such conduct cannot be lightly condoned. The petitioner\n\ntrespassed in the house of the victim and raped her. She\n\nsubmitted that the offence is heinous and the petitioner should\n\nnot be released on bail.\n\n6. I have given considerable thought to the submissions\n\nat the bar and have gone through the records carefully.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n7. The parameters for granting bail were considered by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nBhagwan Singh v. Dilip Kumar\n@\n\n.\n\nDeepu @ Depak, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1059, wherein it was\n\nobserved as under:-\n\n\"12. The grant of bail is a discretionary relief which nec-\nessarily means that such discretion would have to be ex-\nercised in a judicious manner and not as a matter of\n\ncourse. The grant of bail is dependent upon contextual\nfacts of the matter being dealt with by the Court and may\nvary from case to case. There cannot be any exhaustive\nparameters set out for considering the application for a\n\ngrant of bail. However, it can be noted that;\n\n(a) While granting bail the court has to keep in\nmind factors such as the nature of accusations,\nseverity of the punishment, if the accusations entail\na conviction and the nature of evidence in support\n\nof the accusations;\n\n(b) reasonable apprehensions of the witnesses be-\n\ning tampered with or the apprehension of there be-\ning a threat for the complainant should also weigh\n\nwith the Court in the matter of grant of bail.\n\n(c) While it is not accepted to have the entire evi-\ndence establishing the guilt of the accused beyond\n\nreasonable doubt but there ought to be always a\nprima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of\nthe charge.\n\n(d) Frivolity of prosecution should always be con-\nsidered and it is only the element of genuineness\nthat shall have to be considered in the matter of\ngrant of bail and in the event of there being some\ndoubt as to the genuineness of the prosecution, in\nthe normal course of events, the accused is entitled\nto have an order of bail.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n13. We may also profitably refer to a decision of this Court\nin\nKalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan @ Pappu Ya-\n\ndav (2004) 7 SCC 528 where the parameters to be taken\n\n.\n\ninto consideration for the grant of bail by the Courts have\n\nbeen explained in the following words:\n\n\"11. The law in regard to grant or refusal of bail is\nvery well settled. The court granting bail should ex-\n\nercise its discretion in a judicious manner and not\nas a matter of course. Though at the stage of grant-\ning bail a detailed examination of evidence and\nelaborate documentation of the merit of the case\n\nneed not be undertaken, there is a need to indicate\nin such orders reasons for prima facie concluding\nwhy bail was being granted particularly where the\naccused is charged of having committed a serious\n\noffence. Any order devoid of such reasons would\n\nsuffer from non-application of mind. It is also nec-\nessary for the court granting bail to consider among\nother circumstances, the following factors also be-\nfore granting bail; they are:\n\n(a) The nature of accusation and the severity of\npunishment in case of conviction and the nature of\n\nsupporting evidence.\n\n(b) Reasonable apprehension of tampering with the\n\nwitness or apprehension of threat to the com-\n\nplainant.\n\n(c) Prima facie satisfaction of the court in support\nof the charge. (See Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudar-\nshan Singh [(2002) 3 SCC 598: 2002\nSCC (Cri) 688]\nand Puran v. Rambilas\n[(2001) 6 SCC 338: 2001 SCC\n(Cri) 1124].)\"\n\n8. A similar view was taken in\nState of Haryana vs\n\nDharamraj\n2023 SCC Online 1085, wherein it was observed:\n\n7. A foray, albeit brief, into relevant precedents is\nwarranted. This Court considered the factors to guide the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\ngrant of bail in\nRam Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan\nSingh\n, (\n2002) 3 SCC 598 and Kalyan Chandra\nSarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan\n, (2004) 7 SCC 528. In Prasanta\n\n.\n\nKumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee\n, (2010) 14 SCC 496, the\n\nrelevant principles were restated thus:\n\n'9. ... It is trite that this Court does not, normally, interfere\nwith an order passed by the High Court granting or\n\nrejecting bail to the accused. However, it is equally\nincumbent upon the High Court to exercise its discretion\njudiciously, cautiously and strictly in compliance with the\nbasic principles\nlaid down in\na plethora of decisions of\n\nthis Court on the point. It is well settled that, among other\ncircumstances, the factors to be borne in mind while\nconsidering an application for bail are:\n\nr (i) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable\n\nground to believe that the accused had committed\nthe offence;\n\n(ii) nature and gravity of the accusation;\n\n(iii) severity of the punishment in the event of\nconviction;\n\n(iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing if\n\nreleased on bail;\n\n(v) character, behaviour, means, position and\nstanding of the accused;\n\n(vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated;\n\n(vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses\nbeing influenced; and\n\n(viii) danger, of course, of justice being\nthwarted by grant of bail.'\n\n9. The contents of the FIR show that a quarrel was\n\ntaking place outside the home of the victim at 12:00 am on\n\n18.05.2024 when one person ran towards the house of the victim.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\nThe petitioner followed him. The petitioner gave beatings to the\n\nvictim and also raped her. The victim reported the matter to the\n\n.\n\npolice on 22.05.2024 after four days of the incident. She\n\nexplained the delay by saying that the petitioner was defaming\n\nher and threatening her to rape her. These averments show that\n\nthe complete truth is not being disclosed. There is a force in the\n\nsubmission of learned counsel for the petitioner that prima facie\n\nthe petitioner could not have raped the victim when a quarrel\n\nhad taken place and any cry would have attracted the people.\n\nFurther, the petitioner was following the person and would be\n\nmore concerned about preventing the person's escape. Prima\n\nfacie it appears that the prosecution is not telling the complete\n\ntruth and it is difficult to believe the prosecution's version.\n\n10. The petitioner has been in custody since 22.05.2024.\n\nThe status report does not show that the presence of the\n\npetitioner is required for any purpose. The petitioner has been\n\nsent to judicial custody, which means that his custodial\n\ninterrogation is not required. The status report further shows\n\nthat the result of the analysis is still awaited. Some time will be\n\nconsumed in preparing the challan after the receipt of the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\nreport. The petitioner cannot be kept inside the jail indefinitely\n\nawaiting his trial.\n\n.\n\n11. The petitioner stated that he is a permanent resident\n\nof District Kangra, HP, which is not denied in the status report.\n\nThus, there is no chance of the petitioner's absconding and not\n\nfacing the trial.\n\n12.\n\nIt was submitted that the petitioner and the victim\n\nbelong to the same village and the petitioner can intimidate the\n\nvictim. The bail cannot be denied on this ground alone. Suffice it\n\nto say that the police would have the right to approach the Court,\n\nin case the petitioner violates the conditions of bail.\n\n13. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the present\n\npetition is allowed and the petitioner is ordered to be released on\n\nbail in the sum of ₹1,00,000/- with one surety of the like\n\namount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Court. While on\n\nbail, the petitioner will abide by the following terms and\n\nconditions: -\n\n(i) The petitioner will not intimidate the witnesses nor will\nhe influence any evidence in any manner whatsoever.\n\n(ii) The petitioner shall attend the trial in case a charge sheet\nis presented against him and will not seek unnecessary\nadjournments.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n(iii) The petitioner will not leave the present address for a\ncontinuous period of seven days without furnishing the\naddress of intending visit to the SHO, the Police Station\n\n.\n\nconcerned and the Trial Court.\n\n(iv) The petitioner will furnish his mobile number, and social\nmedia contact to the Police and the Court and will abide\nby the summons/notices received from the Police/Court\n\nthrough SMS/WhatsApp/Social Media Account. In case of\nany change in the mobile number or social media\naccounts, the same will be intimated to the Police/Court\nwithin five days from the date of the change.\n\n14.\n\nIt is expressly made clear that in case of violation of\n\nany of these conditions, the prosecution will have a right to file a\n\npetition for cancellation of the bail.\n\n15. The observation made herein before shall remain\n\nconfined to the disposal of the petition and will have no bearing,\n\nwhatsoever, on the merits of the case.\n\n(Rakesh Kainthla)\nJudge\n24th July, 2024\n\n(Shamsh Tabrez)\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS",
