Mahendru)\n 2\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n ORDER\n\nPer Sudhir Kumar, Member (A):\n\n The applicant filed this OA on 07.11.2015 with an application for\n\nurgent listing, as she was aggrieved with the impugned orders passed by\n\nthe Respondent No.1 National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS, in\n\nshort), the sole Respondent at that time, which she had alleged to be\n\nillegal, biased, discriminatory, whimsical, against the Recruitment Rules\n\n(RRs, in short) and being in serious violation of \nArticles 16\n, 21\n \n& 301\n of\n\nthe Constitution. Apart from the main relief of the OA, she had also\n\nprayed for Interim Relief. While issuing notice on 11.11.2014, a\n\nCoordinate Bench had held that as regards the interim relief is\n\nconcerned, in their considered view it was not appropriate to issue any\n\ndirection as asked for at that stage, and the OA was admitted subject to\n\njust exceptions. The applicant of this OA is aggrieved due to non-\n\nconsideration of her case for the post of Joint Secretary by Respondent\n\nNo.1.\n\n2. One MA No.3794/2014 was filed praying for correction of a\n\ntypographical error in the order passed by the Coordinate Bench on\n\n11.11.2014, which was allowed, and the necessary corrections were\n\nordered to be incorporated in the order passed on 11.11.2014. When the\n\npleadings were completed by filing of the written submissions of the\n\nOfficial Respondent No. R-1, as well as rejoinder thereto, the case was\n\nlisted once again before the same Coordinate Bench from 07.05.2015\n\nonwards. On the next date of hearing, the applicant's counsel wanted to\n\n 3\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nfile a reply to the sur-rejoinder filed by the respondents in the\n\nmeanwhile, which was also allowed.\n\n3. On 17.08.2015, learned counsel for the applicant had advanced his\n\narguments for some time, and, thereafter, it transpired and it was\n\nconceded by him that the applicant ought to have made one Shri\n\nMurlidharan Pillai as a party respondent No. R-2 in this case, since the\n\napplicant has claimed seniority over him. Therefore, even at that late\n\nstage, the prayer was allowed, and permission to amend the Memo of\n\nParties was granted, Dasti notices were ordered to be served upon the\n\nsaid Shri Murlidharan Pillai, and time was granted to the newly named\n\nprivate respondent No.R-2 to file his reply. Thereafter the applicant filed\n\nanother MA No.3026/2015 paying for three more private respondents\n\nalso to be impleaded as party respondents No. R-3 to R-5, and it was\n\nsubmitted that an advance copy of the MA had already been served upon\n\nall those four private respondents. Notices in that MA were issued to the\n\nofficial respondents as well as the newly named private respondents,\n\nproposed to be impleaded as Respondents No. R-2 to R-5.\n\n4. On the next date of hearing, the said MA No.3026/2015 filed for\n\nimpleadment of total four individuals as private party respondents No. R-\n\n2 to R-5 was allowed, and amended Memo of Parties was allowed to be\n\nfiled accordingly, and Dasti notices were ordered to be issued in the O.A.\n\nIn the meanwhile, an MA No.3254/2015 had been filed by those four\n\nindividuals also, praying for their impleadment as opposite party\n\nrespondents, and one of them Shri Akshay Joshi was even present in\n\n 4\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nperson in the Court, and sought time to file counter reply. That MA No.\n\n3254/2015 had also been thereafter allowed, and the applicant was\n\ndirected to serve a copy of the paper book of the O.A. on the newly\n\nnamed private respondents No. R-2 to R-5. Counter reply was thereafter\n\nfiled on behalf of private respondents. Thereafter the case was heard in\n\ngreat detail on 18.03.2016, but still the learned counsel for the official\n\nrespondents sought time for advancing his reply arguments, for which\n\ntime was allowed, keeping the case as part-heard. On the next date of\n\nhearing the learned counsel for the Official respondents advanced his\n\narguments also, and the learned counsel for the applicant sought leave\n\nand permission to file a written synopsis, which was also allowed. None\n\nhad appeared on behalf of the four private respondents, but the case was\n\nheard and reserved for orders since all of them were aware of the\n\nproceedings going on, and had themselves filed the M.A. No. 3254/2015,\n\nseeking to be impleaded as party respondents, which M.A. had been\n\nallowed\n\n5. Counter reply had however been filed on behalf of private\n\nrespondent R-4, who had appeared in person, and the Private\n\nRespondent No. R-5 had also once appeared in person. It was only that\n\nthe private Respondents No. R-2 to R-5 did not advance any oral\n\narguments, either by themselves, or through any Counsel, beyond the\n\nCounter Reply filed by R-4.\n\n6. The applicant had in May 1992 joined the Institute of Defence\n\nStudies and Analysis (IDSA, in short), which is an Autonomous Body and\n\n 5\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nResearch Organization, fully funded and controlled by the Govt. of India\n\nto undertake research in defence and security aspects concerning the\n\nnation, and it works in close liaison with R-1 NSCS. The senior serving\n\nor retired officers of the Govt. of India usually head the IDSA, as was said\n\nto have been the case with its previous as well as the present DG on the\n\ndate of filing of the OA. It was, therefore, claimed by the applicant that\n\nIDSA comes within the definition of State under \nArticle 12\n of the\n\nConstitution of India, which aspect has not been seriously disputed by\n\nthe Respondents also. The applicant has claimed that her appointment\n\nwith IDSA was on a permanent sanctioned vacant post of Research\n\nAssistant in Group 'B', through public appointment, as per the RRs\n\nrelevant to those posts. According to the applicant, after two years of her\n\nservice with the IDSA, on 04.05.1994 she was selected and appointed\n\nagainst the duly sanctioned and vacant permanent Group 'A' post of\n\nResearch Officer in the pay scale of Rs.2200-4000, with all allowances as\n\nadmissible to Group 'A' Officers of the Government of India, through the\n\nappointment order dated 04.05.1994 (Annexure A-4). As usual, the said\n\nappointment was stated to be initially for two years, and it was ordered\n\nthat she would be on probation period of one year, and on successful\n\ncompletion of the probation period, the applicant's appointment was to\n\nbe continued. She has claimed that upon satisfactory completion of her\n\nprobation period, the IDSA had continued her on the said Group 'A'\n\nsanctioned post of Research Officer, and that she was treated by IDSA as\n\na regular employee, in view of her appointment having been made\n\nagainst a permanent post, and as per the RRs, and that she had even\n\ncontinued to draw her annual increments etc. The applicant claims to\n\n 6\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nhave been then selected by IDSA and appointed on 15.07.1997 to the\n\nnext higher Group 'A' post of Research Fellow, in the pay scale of\n\nRs.12000-16500, with allowances as admissible to Group 'A' Officers, for\n\na period of two years, w.e.f. 01.07.1997, which appointment was\n\nextended for a further period of two years w.e.f. 01.07.1999, through\n\norder dated 25.09.1999 (Annexure A-5), and was extended thereafter also\n\nfrom time to time. None of these averments have been effectively denied\n\nby the Official Respondent No. R-1, or by the Private Respondents No. R-\n\n2 to R-5. In fact, her the then employer IDSA is not even a party to the\n\npresent proceedings.\n\n7. It was submitted by the applicant that Respondent No.1 NSCS is a\n\nspecialized Department of Govt. of India, coming under the direct\n\nadministrative control of the Prime Minister's Office, the appointments to\n\nwhich are made under its own NSCS RRs. It was further submitted by\n\nthe applicant herself that this organization NSCS has been given a\n\nspecial dispensation to make direct and lateral appointments at all levels\n\nfrom outside the Government also, including the Universities, Research\n\nInstitutes etc., by searching for talent through its own mechanism, and\n\nthat the appointments in NSCS and the process of making those\n\nappointments do not come under the purview of even the UPSC, as\n\nexemption from the relevant Constitutional Provisions has been built-in\n\nin the NSCS RRs itself.\n\n8. The applicant has claimed that while she was working in Group 'A'\n\npost of Research Fellow in IDSA, in the pay scale of Rs.12000-16500, the\n\n 7\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nRespondent No.1 had asked for her services, and had taken her on\n\ndeputation, and appointed her on the post of Deputy Secretary to the\n\nGovt. of India, in the same pay scale, with all admissible allowances.\n\nShe claimed to have served on the post of Deputy Secretary from\n\n16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, i.e., for more than 2 years, after which her\n\nparent organization IDSA had requisitioned her services to be returned\n\nback, to enable her to work on an important research project. As a\n\nresult, she was repatriated from NSCS, and resumed her charge on the\n\npost of Research Fellow in IDSA, in Group 'A', on 27.09.2002 itself. She\n\nhas submitted that her performance on the post of Deputy Secretary in\n\nNSCS had earned her outstanding reports and special appreciation. She\n\nhas further submitted that the Respondent No.R-1 NSCS had actually\n\nintended then itself to formally appoint her within NSCS for this purpose,\n\nand they had even asked her to obtain from IDSA the service certificate,\n\nwhich also she had obtained on 19.07.2002, through Annexure A-6,\n\nmuch prior to her repatriation back to IDSA. The applicant has further\n\nproduced the Commendation Certificate dated 27.09.2002 which had\n\nbeen issued to her by R-1 NSCS when she was reverted back to her\n\nparent organization IDSA, and which certificate had actually been issued\n\nby a Joint Secretary of Respondent No. R-1, as at Annexure A-7, on\n\nbehalf of NSCS, with a copy being marked to her substantive employer,\n\nDirector IDSA, also.\n\n9. Less than one year later, in July-August 2003, the applicant had\n\nparticipated in the regular recruitment process conducted by Respondent\n\nNo.R-1, for substantive appointments to the post of Deputy Secretary to\n\n 8\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthe Govt. of India with NSCS, and on her being successful in the written\n\nexamination and interview, the applicant was advised to submit her\n\nresignation to her the then parent organization IDSA, as a precondition,\n\nfor further processing her substantive appointment as Deputy Secretary\n\nin NSCS in the Govt. of India. Accordingly, she submitted her\n\nresignation to IDSA on 08.08.2003, though, while awaiting the\n\ncompletion of the appointment procedure of Respondent No.R-1-NSCS,\n\nshe had remained in service of IDSA till 30.09.2003. When the\n\nRespondent No.R-1-NSCS had informed her and IDSA that the President\n\nof India had approved her appointment to the post of Deputy Secretary,\n\nNSCS, in Govt. of India, as per her request, she was relieved from IDSA\n\non 30.09.2003, and IDSA had, through a letter of the same date\n\n30.09.2003, accepted her resignation, and had relieved her of her duties.\n\nThe applicant has claimed that at that time she failed to notice that in\n\nthat relieving order issued by IDSA, it was mentioned that she had been\n\nrelieved with retrospective effect from 10.08.2003, and that her\n\nresignation had been accepted on 30.09.2003 was retrospective effect,\n\nover-looking the fact that she was in IDSA's service till that date. Her\n\nappointment, thereafter, as Deputy Secretary, Govt. of India with\n\nRespondent No.R-1 NSCS was Gazette notified on 08.12.2003, by virtue\n\nof which Gazette Notification, she came to be holder of a civil post in the\n\nUnion of India. The relevant documents were annexed as Annexures A-\n\n10, A-11 & A-12 of the paper book of the O.A.\n\n10. The applicant has submitted that under the RRs of 2001, fresh\n\nappointments to the permanent vacant posts with Respondent No.R-1-\n\n 9\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nNSCS had to be made mainly by the mode of Contract and Deputation,\n\nand subject to suitability of the officer, the initial contract of service with\n\nthe Government under Respondent No.R-1-NSCS was generally extended\n\nfrom time to time. If an officer has put in the requisite necessary service\n\nwith NSCS for being eligible to the next higher post, the only procedural\n\nrequirement was that a fresh contract was required to be signed to\n\nappoint to the officer concerned for the next higher post in order to retain\n\nthe talent, which was akin to promotion. Through its orders dated\n\n05.06.2006, the Govt. of India had, however, continued the applicant on\n\nthe post of Deputy Secretary for another period of two years, with\n\nretrospective effect from 03.10.2005, and she was also granted three\n\nadvance increments, in order to match her salary to be the same which\n\nshe was already drawing in IDSA, and one more advance increment was\n\nalso granted in recognition of her outstanding service. She has\n\nsubmitted that when she had become the holder of a civil post under the\n\nUnion of India, since her appointment was against a permanent vacant\n\npost, and had been made in full compliance of the RRs, and the\n\ndirections of the Government issued through order dated 05.06.2006,\n\nwhich was in full compliance of RRs, and it was without any fresh\n\ncontract, this had the effect of putting her at par with the regular\n\nappointees.\n\n11. Thereafter, in September 2006, while she was holding the post of\n\nDeputy Secretary, a Selection Committee had duly considered her case\n\nfor appointment to the post of Director, against a permanent vacant post\n\nwith Respondent No.R-1 NSCS. For this purpose, the Selection\n\n 10\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nCommittee had reckoned her Group 'A' service of 12 years in IDSA, and\n\nthe period of her service in NSCS, from the date of her initial joining in\n\nIDSA on 04.05.1994, to the date 31.08.2006, when she was with NSCS,\n\nand had also taken into account her Group 'A' service of more than 09\n\nyears, in the pay scale of Rs.12000-16500, w.e.f. 01.07.1997 to\n\n30.09.2006. Thereafter, as per recommendations of that Selection\n\nCommittee, she was appointed to the higher post of Director in NSCS in\n\nthe pay scale of Rs.14300-18300 (Revised to Pay Band-4 Rs.37400-\n\n67,000 + GP Rs.8700) for a period of 5 years, and all allowances as were\n\nadmissible to the equivalent pay of the Group 'A' Officers of the\n\nGovernment were made available to her. Soon thereafter, in 2007, the\n\nRespondent No.R-1-NSCS was delinked from Cabinet Secretariat, and\n\nbrought under the Administrative control of the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nOn 22.12.2007, new NSCS (Group A Services) RRs, 2007 were notified,\n\nunder which 50% appointments to the posts of Directors were to be\n\nmade by promotion, and 50% appointments as Directors were to be made\n\nby deputation/contract/absorption/re-employment, and it was\n\nspecifically provided that the promotion quota will be filled up only\n\nthrough such officers who had been working with Respondent No.R-1-\n\nNSCS, and had put in 5 years of regular service in the feeder grade of\n\nRs.12000-16500.\n\n12. The applicant had then explained the complication which had\n\narisen in her case with the advent of the new RRs, 2007 (Annexure A-16),\n\nand we shall revert to that shortly. However, the applicant worked as\n\nDirector for 5 years from 2006 to 2011, and vide their order dated\n\n 11\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n27.09.2011, the respondent No. R-1 extended her services on the post of\n\nDirector for one more year (Annexure A-17). In Para 4.17 of her OA, the\n\napplicant has alleged that despite the fact that all appointments with the\n\nRespondent No.R-1-NSCS are made against permanent vacant posts,\n\nthrough a duly constituted Selection Committee, and on the same service\n\nconditions and pay scales as admissible to temporary/regular Group 'A'\n\nofficers, yet the method of contract is a normal mode of appointment to\n\nNSCS under the RRs, which has been designed only to keep the officers\n\nin continuous stress. At the same time, the appointments made under\n\n50% promotion quota are also made against the permanent vacant posts,\n\nfrom among the already serving temporary/regular/absorbed officers in\n\nthe feeder cadre. She has further submitted that the mode of absorption\n\nunder the RRs is essentially meant for regularization of the services of\n\nthose officers who are appointed to NSCS on Contract, or on Deputation\n\nbasis. In the conspectus of these submissions, the applicant has\n\nclaimed that when on 03.10.2003, she was first appointed against the\n\npermanent vacant post of Deputy Secretary with Respondent No.R-1-\n\nNSCS, and later on, when on 29.09.2006 she was duly appointed against\n\nthe permanent vacant post of Director, at the time of absorbing her\n\nservices with Respondent No.R-1-NSCS, she ought to have been\n\nabsorbed w.e.f. 03.10.2003 on the post of Deputy Secretary, and w.e.f.\n\n29.09.2006 on the post of Director, under the relevant DoP&T\n\ninstructions in this regard, which the respondent No.1-NSCS has not\n\ndone, giving rise to the present O.A.\n\n 12\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n13. The applicant has further submitted that she had all along been\n\nrepresenting for treating her service with IDSA w.e.f. March, 1992 as\n\nbeing in continuum for the purpose of her pension and retirement\n\nbenefits. She has further submitted that but for the allure of pension\n\nfacility in the Government service, which is not available to IDSA\n\nemployees, she would have, in fact, continued to work in the IDSA. It\n\nwas further submitted that the Govt. of India had since regularized all\n\ncontract appointments made by IDSA, with effect from the initial dates of\n\ntheir contractual appointments, and that IDSA has since extended\n\nPension benefits to all such regularized IDSA employees, under CCS\n\n(Pension) Rules, 1972.\n\n14. In the result, the applicant has through this O.A. assailed the\n\nrespondents' order dated 12.04.2012 (Annexure A-1), ordering for her\n\nbeing absorbed against the post of Director, only from the date of\n\nissuance of that order, and their not having provided her the benefit of\n\nabsorption of her services w.e.f. 03.10.2003, the date she joined NSCS on\n\nthe post of Deputy Secretary after due process of selection, and her\n\nhaving resigned from IDSA, as per their requirement. She has further\n\nsubmitted that RRs of NSCS do not empower the respondents to\n\ncontinue an officer only on Contract basis indefinitely, merely to deny\n\nhim (or her) the status of a regular employee. She has further submitted\n\nthat in any case she has been substantively holding a civil post under\n\nthe Govt. of India since 03.10.2003, and both her appointment to the\n\npost of Deputy Secretary NSCS, as well as Director NSCS later on, were\n\n 13\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nduly Gazette notified. She is aggrieved that the respondents' impugned\n\norder as at Annexure A-1 has resulted in wiping out the benefit of her\n\nentire past service with NSCS, rendered on the post of Deputy Secretary\n\nNSCS from 03.10.2003 to 28.10.2006, full benefit of which ought to have\n\naccrued to her, and further her subsequent substantive appointment on\n\nthe post of Director NSCS from 29.09.2006 onwards, till the date of\n\n11.04.2012. As a result of this action of the respondents, many persons\n\nwho had been, in the past, working as her juniors or her subordinates\n\nhave stolen a march over her, just because even though they were her\n\njuniors, and in some cases subordinate to her, and they were even\n\npromoted or taken on deputation to NSCS on dates later than her, they\n\nhave been given seniority from the initial dates of their holding the same\n\npost on such deputation or promotion. The applicant has submitted that\n\nRespondent No.R-1-NSCS not absorbing or regularizing her service from\n\nthe initial date of her appointment and joining service on 03.10.2003 has\n\nresulted in denial to her of career, post, status, seniority, seniority, and\n\nthe full pension benefits available under the CCS (Pension) Regulations,\n\n1972, and that it has also affected her entitlement of consideration of her\n\ncase for promotion to the post of Joint Secretary under the promotion\n\nquota for the Select List year 2009.\n\n15. The applicant has further assailed the impugned order dated\n\n12.04.2012 to be baseless, whimsical, discriminatory, vitiated with bias\n\nand prejudice, and against the RRs, as the date arbitrarily chosen by the\n\nrespondents for her absorption has no relation whatsoever with the date\n\n 14\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nof her initial appointment with Respondent No.1-NSCS, and the various\n\nposts of Deputy Secretary and Director of NSCS held by her. She has\n\nsubmitted that she has thus been denied right of equality in employment\n\netc. under \nArticles 16\n \n& 21\n of the Constitution of India. The applicant\n\nhas further submitted that on her taking up the matter with respondent\n\nNo.1-NSCS, she was informed that the respondent No.1-NSCS had\n\ndeclined to give her the benefit of continuity of Group 'A' Service from her\n\nservice in IDSA on the plea that her previous Group 'A' Service in IDSA\n\nupto 10.08.2003, and subsequently her joining on appointment in NSCS\n\non 03.10.2003, was separated by the period of 01 month and 22 days,\n\nand, therefore, her previous experience of working for 09 years in Group\n\n'A' Service rendered in IDSA could not be treated to have been in\n\ncontinuation for the purpose of according promotion to her. She has\n\nalleged that this stand was contrary to the stand taken by the\n\nrespondent No.1-NSCS on 03.10.2003, when they had indeed reckoned\n\nher previous Group 'A' Service in IDSA to have been without any\n\ninterruption for the purpose of counting her service qualification, as\n\nrequired under the RRs, and the respondents could not be allowed to\n\nnow change their stand after a decade. It was submitted that it was not\n\ncorrect and legally tenable for the respondent No.1-NSCS to have raised\n\nthe plea of an alleged break in her service, and shelter had been sought\n\nbehind the Hon'ble Apex Court judgment in the case of \nBanaras Hindu\n\nUniversity Varanasi and Another vs. Dr. Indra Pratap Singh\n AIR\n\n1992 SC 780: JT 1992 (1) SC 320.\n\n 15\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n16. The applicant has alleged that because of this deliberate mischief\n\non their part, the respondent No.1-NSCS has, thereafter, through their\n\norder dated 26.11.2013, declined to consider her case for promotion to\n\nthe post of Joint Secretary, taking the plea that her past service in IDSA,\n\nand the subsequent service with R-1 NSCS, were separated by a gap of\n\n01 month and 22 days, and, therefore, her employment cannot be\n\nreckoned to be one continuum, and that the assessment of her claim for\n\npromotion would, therefore, have to be considered only on the basis of\n\nher service from the date of her joining in NSCS on 03.10.2003, which\n\nthe applicant has termed to be illegal. She has submitted that the\n\nrespondents cannot now take a reverse view only because the word\n\n'continuous' has been added in the revised RRs of 2007, which was not\n\nthere in the previous RRs. The applicant had represented in this behalf\n\non 11.12.2013 pointing out the discrimination meted out to her, and had\n\neven cited other cases to allege discrimination. It was submitted that the\n\nrespondent No.1-NSCS has now taken a new plea that the applicant's\n\nearlier contract appointment had come to an end, and that her\n\ncontinuous service could be counted only from the date of her\n\nsubstantive absorption, and they have thus ignored consideration of her\n\ncase for absorption on this basis of service rendered from the initial date\n\nof her joining on contract. She has further submitted that even the\n\nadvice sought by the Respondent No. R-1-NSCS from DoP&T and\n\nMinistry of Law was on a wrong premise. The applicant had further\n\nsought shelter behind this Tribunal's Order in the case of \nDr. S.D.\n\nPradhan vs. National Security Council\n in OA No.2250/2012, decided\n\non 21.10.2013 (Annexure A-20). Thereafter, it was alleged that she had\n\n 16\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nrepresented against the respondents' order dated 29.04.2014, but the\n\nsame was not replied to, and she had cited the cases of two individuals\n\nwho had later got themselves impleaded as private respondents R-3 & R-\n\n5, but did not advance any arguments, beyond R-4 filing a counter reply\n\nto the OA.\n\n17. The applicant had submitted that in the case of private respondent\n\nNo. R-2, the official respondent R-1-NSCS had directly appointed him on\n\nthe post of Joint Director/Deputy Secretary, under the mode of\n\nabsorption, by even treating or reckoning his co-terminus employment in\n\ntheir Personal Sections with various Hon'ble Ministers during the years\n\nfrom 1986 to 2006, which was against the RRs, and R-1-NSCS had even\n\ntreated the gap in his employment with the Govt. of India in Ministers'\n\nPersonal Sections also from 17.01.1990 to 30.04.1992 as to be in\n\ncontinuum, only because of which he could get promoted to the post of\n\nDirector w.e.f. 29.09.2011, overlooking her seniority over him (R-2). The\n\napplicant had also discussed the case of private respondent No. R-4\n\nstating that on 16.08.2005, the respondents had created a new post of\n\nOSD in the pay scale of Joint Secretary with Respondent No. R-1-NSCS,\n\nfor the specific purpose of serving the National Security Advisory Board,\n\nand had then permanently transferred the private respondent No. R-4 to\n\nthat post, when he was, in fact, at that time looking after the Hospitality\n\nWing at the Prime Minister's residence, and even though he (R-4) had no\n\nqualifications/experience whatsoever of defence research or related\n\naspects. It was submitted by her that private respondent No. R-4 was\n\nlater absorbed as Joint Secretary, and then further promoted to the post\n\n 17\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nof Additional Secretary, apparently by relaxing the eligibility norms, and\n\neven without the mandatory approval of the ACC. She had explained the\n\ncase of another person, Dr. S.D. Pradhan, who was not named, and did\n\nnot become a party respondent in this case, but in whose cases also, she\n\nhad alleged that Respondent No.R-1-NSCS had reckoned the entire\n\ncontract service for the purpose of continuity of service for pensionary\n\nbenefits under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.\n\n18. While submitting that she does not want to question the benefits\n\nalready granted by the respondent No.1-NSCS to any other person, the\n\napplicant had only submitted that she did not want to be discriminated\n\nagainst by the respondents.\n\n19. The applicant had taken the ground for filing this OA that she was\n\nentitled to absorption on the post of Deputy Secretary in substantive\n\ncapacity w.e.f. 03.10.2003, the date when she had first joined\n\nRespondent No.R-1-NSCS, and required to be treated as having been\n\nsubstantively promoted on the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2006, as had\n\nbeen stated by the respondent No.1-NSCS in the letter dated 06.10.2006,\n\nby which she would have become entitled to be considered for promotion\n\nto the post of Joint Secretary as on 01.10.2009, even as per the new\n\nNSCS RRs, 2007. She had further taken the ground that she was\n\nentitled for her service in IDSA to be reckoned in continuum for the\n\npurpose of retirement and pensionary benefits under CCS (Pension)\n\nRules, 1972. In support of her contention, she had taken the ground\n\n 18\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthat her appointment to Respondent No.R-1-NSCS as Deputy Secretary\n\nwas against a permanent vacant post, and in terms of NSCS RRs as they\n\nwere prevailing on that date. She had further taken the ground that the\n\nrespondent No.1-NSCS has overlooked her period of service on the two\n\nposts of Research Officer and Research Fellow with IDSA, which had\n\nbeen reckoned with and considered even by the Selection Committee of\n\nR-1 NSCS itself also, due to which she was held to be meeting the\n\nrequirements of service qualification for her appointment to the post of\n\nDeputy Secretary with R-1-NSCS on 03.10.2003, and, therefore, the\n\nrespondent R-1-NSCS cannot now be allowed to go back on that aspect,\n\nand not to consider that service of hers with IDSA as eligible service.\n\n20. She has further taken the ground that when her initial appointment\n\nunder the then prevailing NSCS RRs of 2001 was on contract basis for\n\nthree/five years and the contract was extended from time to time till her\n\nabsorption, which is a usual mode of appointment with R-1 NSCS, her\n\ninitial appointment was akin to deputation appointment, as held by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nBanaras Hindu University\n\nVaranasi and Another vs. Dr. Indra Pratap Singh\n (supra).\n \nShe has\n\nalso submitted that she cannot be denied the benefit admissible to\n\nregular officers just because her direct appointment against a\n\npermanent vacant post had been termed to be on contract basis, as had\n\nbeen held by this Tribunal in the case of \nDr. S.D. Pradhan vs. National\n\nSecurity Council\n (supra), more so because even her subsequent\n\npromotional appointment to the post of Director on 29.09.2006 had also\n\n 19\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nbeen made against a permanent vacant post, in full compliance of the\n\nthen prevailing RRs of 2001. She had further taken the ground that\n\nwhen her appointment to a civil post with Respondent No.R-1-NSCS was\n\nunder \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution, she was entitled to all benefits and\n\nsafeguards as available to equivalent officers holding equivalent civil\n\nposts, and it has to be held that she was holding a civil post\n\ncontinuously since 03.10.2003.\n\n21. The applicant had further sought shelter behind the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt judgment in \nRoshan Lal Tandon vs. Union of India\n AIR 1967 SC\n\n1889, which was reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nUPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal Baghela AIR 2006 SC 1165=2006 (2) SCC\n\n482, and the relevant paragraphs from the judgment produced at\n\nAnnexure A-23 were cited.\n \nShe had further taken the ground that both\n\nin respect of her initial contract service/appointment dated 03.10.2003\n\nto the post of Deputy Secretary, and further promotion/appointment\n\nfrom 29.09.2006 to the promotional post of Director, her service\n\nconditions were throughout regulated under CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965, and\n\nother Rules made under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution, and also \nArticle\n\n313\n of the Constitution, and shelter had been sought by her in regard to\n\nher status as such, on the basis of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court\n\njudgment in the case of \nIndian Institute of Technology vs. Mangat\n\nSingh\n [1973 (9) DLT 475] (Annexure A-24). She had further taken the\n\nground that the impugned decision to grant her absorption on the post of\n\nDirector only w.e.f. 12.04.2012 was illegal, discriminatory, as well as\n\n 20\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nagainst the RRs, both the previous RRs of the year 2001, as well as the\n\nnew RRs of 2007, and had caused her serious prejudice, as it had\n\naffected and completely wiped out her continuous service with R-1-NSCS\n\nfrom 03.10.2003 to 11.04.2012, and it was, therefore, stated to be in\n\nviolation of her rights under \nArticles 16\n \n& 21\n of the Constitution.\n\n22. The applicant had further taken the ground that the date of\n\n12.04.2012 now fixed by the respondents in the impugned order as the\n\ndate of her absorption in the NSCS service, on the post of Director, was\n\ncompletely whimsical, without any basis, and does not have any basis\n\nnor any relation whatsoever to the date of her permanent appointment,\n\nor availability of permanent vacant posts, especially so, since she was\n\nappointed in full compliance of 2001 RRs to the post of Deputy Secretary\n\non 03.10.2003, against a permanent vacant post, and, therefore, she was\n\nentitled for absorption against her the then post from the same date.\n\nShe had further alleged discrimination due to the direct induction of an\n\nofficer on the post of Deputy Secretary on 29.09.2006, and on the post of\n\nDirector on 29.09.2011, ignoring her claim, when she was already\n\nserving as Deputy Secretary since 03.10.2003, and submitted the R-1-\n\nNSCS had ordered her services to have been absorbed on 12.04.2012 in\n\nan artificial manner, thereby making the said officer, private respondent\n\nR-2, senior to her.\n\n23. She had further taken the ground that her life would be shattered\n\nunless her service since 04.05.1994 in IDSA/NSCS-R-1 is counted for\n\nthe period of her total service for the purpose of pension etc. She had\n\n 21\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nfurther taken the ground that the terms contract and a fixed tenure of\n\nsuch contract being mentioned in the letter of her appointment was a\n\nsham, unreasonable, and a clear case of exploitation, in the fact\n\nsituation that the applicant did not, at that point of time, have any\n\nbargaining power, and it was least expected from the Government, which\n\nhad to act as a model employer, to make such appointments on contract\n\nbasis, against permanent posts. In the result, citing that the respondent\n\nNo.1 NSCS had even failed to reply to her Legal Notice dated\n\n11.06.2014, the following prayers had been sought for:-\n\n \"a) To quash and set aside the respondent's orders dated\n\n 12.04.2012, 26.11.2013 and 29.04.2014 (Annexure A-1, A-\n 2 and A-3) and order the respondent for applicant's\n absorption on the post of Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of\n India w.e.f. 03.10.2003 and to further order the\n respondent to treat the applicant's appointment dated\n 29.09.2006 on the post of Director as promotion w.e.f.\n from 29.09.2006 as already stated by the respondent vide\n order dated 06.10.2006 and to further order the\n respondent to consider the applicant for promotion to the\n post of Joint Secretary in pay scale of Rs.37400-67000 +\n Grade Pay of Rs. 10,000/- as on 01.10.2009 as per the\n NSCS Recruitment Rules, 2007 and to reckon her service\n in IDSA in continuum for the purpose of retirement and\n pension benefits under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.\n\n b) Pass such other order (s) as may be deemed fit in the\n interest of justice\".\n\n24. Counter reply on behalf of R-1-NSCS was filed on 02.02.2015. A\n\npreliminary objection was taken that all the representations of the\n\napplicant have been replied to, after thorough examination, in\n\nconsultation with the nodal departments, DoP&T and Ministry of Law &\n\nJustice. Further, it was submitted that the applicant was working with\n\nIDSA only on contract basis, first as Research Assistant, on stipend\n\nbasis, from 06.04.1992 to 16.05.1994, and then as Research Officer in\n\n 22\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthe pay scale of Rs.2200-4000 w.e.f. 17.05.1994, as per letter dated\n\n11.12.2013 (Annexure R-1) received from IDSA, (copy of her IDSA\n\nservice record was produced as Annexure R-2). It was further admitted\n\nthat she was awarded Fellowship in the pay scale of Rs.12000-18000 in\n\nIDSA for two years w.e.f. 15.07.1997. It was further submitted that she\n\nwas further awarded another Fellowship in IDSA for two years, w.e.f.\n\n01.07.1999, as per the IDSA service record at Annexure R-3, during\n\nwhich period she had also worked as a Research Fellow with the R-1-\n\nNSCS in the pay scale of Rs.12000-16500, from 16.08.2000 to\n\n27.09.2002, on loan basis, for which period her pay & allowances were\n\npaid by R-1-NSCS, as per the copy of the Office Order dated 28.08.2000,\n\nat Annexure R-4, whereafter she had returned to IDSA w.e.f. 27.09.2002,\n\nthrough the order of that date produced at Annexure R-5. It was\n\nsubmitted that thereafter she had resigned from IDSA, and was relieved\n\nof her duties w.e.f. 10.08.2003, as per the IDSA service record at\n\nAnnexure R-6, and that she was paid salary only upto 10.08.2003 by\n\nIDSA, and that she had also availed terminal benefits of her leave\n\nencashment etc. from that office accordingly. In that context, it was\n\nsubmitted that the contract of the applicant with IDSA came to an end\n\non 10.08.2003, and that she had been paid her entire salary and\n\nterminal benefits by IDSA only upto that date.\n\n25. It was admitted that the applicant was appointed with R-1 NSCS\n\non contract basis as Deputy Secretary/Joint Director in the pay scale of\n\nRs.12000-16500 w.e.f. 03.10.2003, but it was emphasized that this was\n\n 23\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nafter a gap of 01 month and 22 days after she had left her services with\n\nIDSA. It was further submitted that she was subsequently appointed as\n\nDirector with R-1-NSCS w.e.f. 29.09.2006 for a period of 5 years on fresh\n\ncontract vide order dated 06.10.2006 (Annexure R-8), which was\n\nextended from time to time for one year at a time, i.e., upto 28.09.2012,\n\nthrough Annexure R-9, but, in the meanwhile, she was absorbed as\n\nDirector with R-1-NSCS w.e.f. 12.04.2012, which alone gave her the\n\nstatus of a regular Government servant from that date, because prior to\n\nthat she was working only on contract basis, both with IDSA, and\n\nthereafter with R-1-NSCS. It was submitted that under the RRs of R-1-\n\nNSCS for promotions to the posts of Joint Secretary, produced at\n\nAnnexure R-11, the eligibility criteria for the post of Joint Secretary\n\nclearly shows that in order to be eligible for promotion to the post of\n\nJoint Secretary, the incumbent should satisfy either one of the three\n\nconditions mentioned in the RRs, as follows:-\n\n \"(a) 2 years' regular service in Director (DIG scale Grade Pay\n Rs.8900); or\n\n (b) 3 years' regular service in Director scale (Grade Pay Rs.\n\n 8700); or\n\n (c) 8 years' regular service in Deputy Secretary's scale\n (Grade Pay Rs.7600);\n\n with total continuous Group 'A' service of 17 years\".\n\n26. The respondents had taken the further preliminary objection that\n\nthe applicant does not fulfil the eligibility criteria of 3 years' regular\n\nservice in the grade of Director, with total continuous Group 'A' Service of\n\n17 years, for her case being considered for her promotion as Joint\n\nSecretary, though she had been maintaining that she has put in more\n\n 24\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthan 17 years in Group A Service, taking into account her past service\n\nrendered both in IDSA, and with R-1-NSCS. It was further submitted\n\nthat on the issue of giving weightage for counting of past service rendered\n\nby her in IDSA, DoP&T had opined that no such weightage for counting\n\nof past service was permissible, and though contract appointment can be\n\nmade against posts, if the RRs prescribed for the same, but the eligible\n\nservice of an employee will be counted only from the date of absorption,\n\nand the service rendered prior to that on contract basis, not being\n\nregular service, cannot be taken into account for counting eligible service\n\nfor the purpose of promotion, as per DoP&T advice, produced at\n\nAnnexure R-12.\n\n27. It was submitted that prior to the applicant joining R-1-NSCS on\n\n03.10.2003, she was working with IDSA also purely on contract basis,\n\nand she had resigned from IDSA in August 2003 'on her own will', and\n\nnot in pursuance of any request from R-1-NSCS, and that even from that\n\noffice, she had accepted her contract appointment as Deputy Secretary\n\nwith R-1-NSCS, on 03.10.2003, and had even signed a contract\n\nagreement for that purpose. The applicant's contention that she was\n\nassured that her contract appointment will soon be converted into\n\nregular appointment was denied, since there was no such provision in\n\nthe 2001 RRs, and the prevalent RRs in the year 2003 did not even have\n\nany provision for promotion, and as per the Guidelines for recruitment of\n\nofficers in respondent No.1 NSCS organization, absorption had been\n\ndone only 'in rare cases', and that too after completion of a minimum\n\n 25\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nperiod of 5 years by the concerned incumbent in that organization in an\n\noutstanding manner.\n\n28. It was denied that the applicant's appointment as Director w.e.f.\n\n29.09.2006 was on promotion, and it was submitted that her\n\nappointment as Director was only on a fresh contract, and her pay also\n\nwas fixed only at the minimum of the scale of pay of Director, vide order\n\ndated 06.10.2006. It was further submitted that during the year 2006,\n\nthe previous RRs of 2001 were applicable, which had no provision for\n\npromotion, and that promotion had been included in the revised RRs\n\n2007, which had become effective from 22.12.2007 only, and the\n\napplicant could not, therefore, have been eligible for promotion to the\n\npost of Director in the year 2006, as claimed by her.\n\n29. It was further submitted that the Office Order dated 06.10.2006,\n\ncontaining the word 'promotion', has since been rectified vide Office\n\nOrder dated 20.10.2014 (Annexure R-13), which modification order had\n\nbeen issued just around a fortnight before the date of filing of the present\n\nOA, but after the Legal Notice had been sent by the applicant's counsel.\n\n30. It was submitted that the applicant's prayers that she be treated as\n\nhaving been absorbed on the post of Deputy Secretary on 03.10.2003,\n\nand her contract appointment as Director on 29.09.2006 be treated as\n\npromotion, are also based on false presumptions and afterthoughts, and\n\nthat she was presently not eligible for being considered for promotion as\n\nJoint Secretary. It was further submitted that the applicant is\n\nquestioning the order dated 06.10.2006 regarding her pay fixation in the\n\n 26\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\npresent OA, filed in the year 2014, and, therefore, the present OA is\n\nhopelessly time barred, and that she was estopped from raising these\n\nissues at this stage.\n\n31. In Para-wise reply to OA, it was submitted by R-1 NSCS that apart\n\nfrom the RRs, there are certain Guidelines also for filling up of the posts\n\nin NSCS, and that the Guidelines on recruitment of Officers in NSCS also\n\nstipulate that absorption can be made \"in rare cases only\", and after\n\ncompletion of minimum 5 years' service with that organization in an\n\noutstanding manner, and, therefore, it was submitted that absorption in\n\nNSCS cannot be claimed by the present applicant as a matter of right,\n\nand such absorption is always at the sole discretion of the organization.\n\nIt was submitted that since a contract employee cannot be promoted,\n\nand can only be appointed to the next higher grade on a fresh contract,\n\ninadvertently the Office Order dated 06.10.2006 had included/contained\n\nthe word 'promotion', which inadvertent mistake had since already been\n\nrectified through Annexure R-13.\n\n32. It was further submitted that in the year 2012, the Prime Minister's\n\nOffice had directed to examine and process the case of the present\n\napplicant for absorption in NSCS. Accordingly, her case, along with the\n\ncases of all other officers who had completed 5 years' continuous service\n\nin NSCS till then, were processed, and placed before the Selection\n\nCommittee first, and then before the Appointing Authority (Prime\n\nMinister), who had found 3 of them, including the applicant, as being\n\nsuitable for absorption, and orders were accordingly issued on\n\n12.04.2012 (Annexure R-10) in respect of those three Officers. It was\n\n 27\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nsubmitted that in 11 years of her continuous service with the\n\nrespondent-organization R-3, the applicant had never raised the issue of\n\nher absorption to be given effect to w.e.f. 03.10.2003, which issue has\n\nraised through this OA now. It was further submitted that the applicant\n\nhad submitted a representation dated 06.03.2013, which was replied to\n\nthrough Communication dated 26.11.2013 (Annexure A-2), which\n\nrepresentation of hers was related to the maintenance of her Service\n\nBook in respondents' own organization, and not relating to counting of\n\nher past service rendered in IDSA from May 1992 to 30.09.2003, as has\n\nnow been mentioned by her in the present OA, and that after submission\n\nof her aforesaid representation dated 06.03.2013, she had also verbally\n\nraised the issue of her promotion during her meeting with the Deputy\n\nNational Security Advisor and the Secretary of R-1-NSCS on 20.11.2013,\n\nafter which the reply was issued to her on 26.11.2013, and she was\n\ninformed that her past service in IDSA, and subsequent service in the\n\nrespondent No.1 NSCS-organization being separated by 01 month and 22\n\ndays, the two cannot be reckoned to be one continuum, and, therefore,\n\nan assessment of her claim for promotion will have to be made only with\n\nreference to the date of her joining in NSCS on 03.10.2003, and in\n\naccordance with the RRs and set procedures, and that it was not correct\n\nto say that the respondents had declined her representation.\n\n33. In reply to Para 4.7 of the OA, it was submitted that the applicant\n\nhad earlier joined the respondent No.1-NSCS, when she was working in\n\nIDSA as a Research Fellow, 'on loan basis' from 16.08.2000 to\n\n26.09.2002, and that she was not on deputation, as has been wrongly\n\n 28\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nmentioned by her. It was submitted after she was relieved from the\n\nrespondent No1-NSCS on 27.09.2002 with direction to report to her\n\nparent office IDSA, at that point of time, she was not asked to submit\n\nany Service Certificate from IDSA. Instead, through her Note dated\n\n23.08.2011, she had herself provided a copy of a Certificate addressed\n\n\"To whomsoever it may concern\" dated 16.08.2011, issued by IDSA,\n\nstating that she had worked as Research Assistant in that organization\n\nfrom 1992 to 1994 (Annexure R-15), and she had again submitted a copy\n\nof another such Certificate dated 19.07.2002 through her\n\nCommunication dated 22.01.2014 (Annexure R-16), with reference to the\n\nCommunication dated 26.11.2013 issued to her in response to her\n\nearlier representation dated 06.03.2013. Therefore, her contention that\n\nshe had been asked to submit a Service Certificate from IDSA for the\n\npurpose of her appointment in 2003 was denied.\n\n34. It was further denied that the applicant had been advised to submit\n\nher resignation in IDSA as a pre-condition to further process of\n\nappointment in Govt. of India, and it was further denied by R-1- NSCS\n\nthat she had remained in service of IDSA till 30.09.2003, and it was\n\nfurther denied that she was sanctioned leave upto 30.09.2003 by the\n\nIDSA, since, according to R-1- NSCS she did not remain in service of\n\nIDSA till that date, and was instead relieved of her duties w.e.f.\n\n10.08.2003, and her salary was also paid only upto that date only by\n\nIDSA. Her plea in this regard was termed by R-1- NSCS to be an\n\nafterthought.\n\n 29\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n35. It was further submitted that the modes of appointment prescribed\n\nin the NSCS RRs 2001 for the post of Deputy Secretary/Joint Director\n\nwere (1) deputation/ (2) contract/ (3) absorption/ (4) re-employment, and\n\nthat the officers of the (1) Central Government/(2) State Government/ (3)\n\nUniversities/(4) Research Institutes/ (5) Autonomous Bodies, holding\n\nanalogous posts, were eligible. It was submitted that since at the time of\n\nher selection for the post of Deputy Secretary in R-1-NSCS in the year\n\n2003, the applicant was holding an analogous post in IDSA, her\n\ncandidature was considered, and she was appointed to that post in R-1-\n\nNSCS on contract basis w.e.f. 03.10.2003. Still, uno flatu, it was denied\n\nthat the respondent R-1- NSCS had reckoned her having held Group 'A'\n\nservice of more than 9 years in IDSA from 1994 to 2003 for consideration\n\nof her appointment with the R-1-NSCS. Further, while admitting that the\n\npost against which she was appointed was a regular sanctioned post, it\n\nwas once again uno flatu stated that it was filled up not on a substantive\n\nbasis, but through her contract appointment, which was one of the\n\nmodes of appointment prescribed in the RRs 2001.\n\n36. It was submitted by R-1- NSCS that merely appointing her on\n\ncontract basis against a regular post, and notifying such an appointment\n\nin the Gazette of India, and granting her annual increments and other\n\nbenefits as admissible to regularly appointed officers in that pay scale\n\ncannot bestow upon her the status of a regular Government servant,\n\nsince the conditions of her contract appointment were governed by the\n\nagreement duly accepted and signed by her, which contract agreement\n\nitself inter-alia included application of Fundamental Rules (FRs), LTC\n\n 30\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nRules, CCS (CCA) Rules, 1972 etc. to her appointment. It was further\n\nsubmitted that contract appointments and absorption were two different\n\nmodes prescribed in the 2001 RRs, and a contract employee is governed\n\nonly by the agreement signed by him/her, and attains the status of a\n\nregular Government servant only after absorption.\n\n37. It was further submitted that since contract employment had been\n\nprescribed as one of the modes of recruitment of Officers in the NSCS\n\n2001 RRs, such contract employees were also eligible for increments etc.\n\nalso, apart from pay & allowances, as admissible to officers recruited\n\nthrough the other prescribed modes, and on completion of their initial\n\ncontract period, as assessment was made for their continuation in the\n\nsame grade, or to give them the higher grade, on the basis of a fresh\n\ncontract. It was still submitted that they, however, can become regular\n\nGovernment servants from the date of their absorption only.\n\n38. It was further denied that the applicant was substantively\n\nappointed to the post of Director in the year 2006 only because the\n\nSelection Committee had at that time taken into reckoning her\n\ncontinuous Group 'A' service of 12 years in IDSA and NSCS put together,\n\nand 9 years out of which was in the pay scale of Deputy Secretary/Joint\n\nDirector both in IDSA and NSCS put together. It was instead submitted\n\nthat she was appointed as Director on a fresh contract keeping in view\n\nonly her performance in R-1- NSCS in the grade of Deputy Secretary,\n\nduring the two spells of her contract service with R-1- NSCS by that\n\ntime, totalling to 5 years, since the Guidelines for recruitment of officers\n\nin NSCS provided that a contract officer can be considered for higher\n\n 31\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\npost on a fresh contract basis on completion of 5 years of such contract\n\nservice.\n\n39. It was further submitted that the NSCS was designated as a\n\nspecialized Research unit, under the direct charge of the National\n\nSecurity Advisor (NSA, in short) in the Prime Minister's Office, vide\n\nCabinet Secretariat's Resolution dated 27.02.2002, and it was admitted\n\nthat the new RRs for Group 'A' services in NSCS were notified on\n\n22.12.2007, which is a matter of record. The applicant's contention that\n\nwith the advent of the new RRs 2007, she should have been\n\nabsorbed/regularized from the back date of 03.10.2003, and that she\n\nwas eligible for her appointment on the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2006\n\nto be treated, as promotion was denied and called a far-fetched\n\nimagination. It was submitted that appointing people on absorption/re-\n\nemployment/contract, as prescribed in the RRs, is the sole discretion of\n\nthe organization, and as regards promotion, no junior/subordinate of the\n\napplicant had been promoted to the post of Director/Joint Secretary after\n\nthe new RRs 2007, and when three eligible officers, including the\n\napplicant, were found suitable to be eligible for absorption, orders were\n\nissued on 12.04.2012 accordingly.\n\n40. It was further submitted by R-1-NSCS that though (such Class-I\n\n/Group A Service) appointments in the Government of India are normally\n\ndone through UPSC, however, the respondent-organization-NSCS has\n\nbeen given a special dispensation in the matter of recruitment of its\n\nofficers/staff, to enable it to tap the available talent from within or\n\noutside the Government etc., and whenever the Search Committee of R-\n\n 32\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n1-NSCS identifies suitable candidates anywhere, such identified\n\ncandidates are offered appointment. While serving Government servants\n\nare taken on deputation basis, those working with the Research\n\nInstitutes/Autonomous Bodies/Private Institutions etc., who cannot\n\ncome on deputation, are offered contract appointments, if they are\n\ncleared otherwise from security angle. Retired Government servants are\n\nalso appointed on re-employment basis. It was further submitted that\n\nwhenever any vacancy arises at a level, and the process of selection has\n\nbeen initiated, the candidature of already serving NSCS contract officers\n\nis also considered, and if they are found suitable as per the\n\nRRs/Guidelines, they are appointed to the higher grade, on a fresh\n\ncontract basis, as was done in the applicant's case.\n\n41. It was further submitted that after joining respondent-organization\n\nNSCS, the applicant had consented to become a member of the\n\nContributory Provident Fund (CPF, in short) as applicable to contract\n\nemployees, and that only after her absorption w.e.f. 12.04.2012 she\n\nbecame a member of the New Pension Scheme (NPS, in short), and her\n\nCPF accumulations were refunded to her, which goes to show that she\n\nwas fully aware that she would not be eligible for pension under the CCS\n\n(Pension) Rules, 1972 in NSCS. It was denied that any of her junior, or\n\nany of her subordinates, had been appointed or absorbed in the grade of\n\nDirector prior to her absorption along with two others on 12.04.2012. It\n\nwas further submitted that the date of 12.04.2012 is very much relevant,\n\nas the order of her absorption in NSCS was issued on that date, after\n\nreceiving the approval of the Competent Authority. It was also submitted\n\n 33\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthat she had entered into a fresh contract agreement for her contractual\n\nappointment to the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2006, without raising the\n\nissue of her absorption from the back date of 03.10.2003, which\n\ncontention she has now raised through this OA. It was submitted that\n\nall the representations of the applicant were examined in consultation\n\nwith the nodal departments, DoP&T and Ministry of Law & Justice, and\n\ndetailed replies were sent to her, clarifying that as per the existing RRs,\n\nshe is not eligible for promotion as Joint Secretary at present, and it has\n\nalso been clarified that she was appointed as Deputy Secretary w.e.f.\n\n03.10.2003 only because she was earlier holding an analogous post in\n\nIDSA, as was required in the RRs of 2001.\n\n42. The applicability of the case of \nBanaras Hindu University\n\nVaranasi and Another vs. Dr. Indra Pratap Singh\n (supra) to the instant\n\ncase was denied, as that case related to Merit Promotion Scheme of the\n\nUniversity Grants Commission, whereas the present OA concerns the\n\nRRs and other Rules and Regulations applicable to the NSCS and other\n\nCentral Government employees, and that it is clear that for promotion to\n\nthe post of Joint Secretary in NSCS, one has to have rendered a\n\nminimum regular service of 3 years in the grade of Director, with\n\nminimum 17 years' continuous Group 'A' Service, and the applicant does\n\nnot meet this eligibility criteria at present. It was denied that the\n\nrespondents had vide order dated 26.11.2013 declined to consider the\n\napplicant for promotion to the post of Joint Secretary, since it had been\n\nalready clarified to her vide Communication dated 29.04.2012 that her\n\n 34\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nregular service counts from the date of her absorption in NSCS, i.e.,\n\n12.04.2012.\n\n43. The respondents had further distinguished her case from the case\n\nof \nDr. S.D. Pradhan\n (supra), who had been on contract with the NSCS\n\nfrom 1999 to 2001, and was subsequently absorbed as Joint Secretary,\n\nbecause he was working continuously since 29.06.1989 in various\n\ncapacities, and the last post of OSD at JS level was held by him as on\n\n07.06.2001.\n\n44. The applicant's contention that her representation dated\n\n17.06.2014 was not replied to was denied, stating that it had been\n\nreplied through Annexure R-18 dated 05.09.2014. Respondents had\n\nthereafter explained the individual cases of private respondent R-3 Ms.\n\nShweta Bakshi, private respondent R-5 Shri Akshay Joshi, private\n\nrespondent R-2 Shri Murlidharan Pillai, and of private respondent R-4\n\nShri Rohit Khera, and the circumstances of their absorption and\n\npromotion etc. They had also explained the facts concerning the case of\n\nDr. S.D. Pradhan, which had been mentioned by the applicant in the OA\n\nin her own manner.\n\n45. In reply to the grounds, it was submitted by R-1-NSCS that the\n\napplicant had herself resigned from her previous employer IDSA, which\n\nresignation was accepted by IDSA, to be effective from 10.08.2003, and it\n\nhad nowhere been mentioned in her relieving order that she was relieved\n\nfor the purpose of joining service with R-1-NSCS, though, while\n\nconsidering her appointment to the post of Deputy Secretary in NSCS\n\n 35\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nw.e.f. 03.10.2003, her candidature had been considered by considering\n\nher to have been holding an analogous post in IDSA prior to that, as was\n\nrequired under the then prevalent 2001 RRs. It was further submitted\n\nthat the applicant has wrongly cited the Hon'ble Supreme Court's\n\njudgment, because in that judgment it has nowhere been held that\n\ncontract appointments are akin to deputation appointment.\n\n46. It was further reiterated that the word 'promotion' was\n\ninadvertently mentioned in the order passed by R-1-NSCS on\n\n06.10.2006, as a contract employee could not have been promoted, and\n\nas per NSCS RRs of 2001, promotion did not figure as a mode of\n\nrecruitment, and, on the contrary, any officer being absorbed had to give\n\na Service Certificate. It was submitted that the applicant could not have\n\ndemanded any promotion, and since the word 'promotion' had been\n\ninadvertently wrongly used in the order dated 06.10.2006, that order had\n\nsince been rectified on 20.10.2014.\n\n47. The applicant's contention that her rights and obligations were not\n\ndetermined only by the contract signed by her, but were determined\n\ninstead by Statutory Rules was denied as her own imagination and an\n\nafterthought. It was submitted that the fact remained that she had been\n\nabsorbed on the post of Director in NSCS only w.e.f. 12.04.2012, on the\n\nbasis of consideration of her performance during the period from\n\n03.10.2003 to 11.04.2012, and the applicant had at that point of time\n\nnot raised any issue then and there regarding the effective date of her\n\nabsorption. It was further submitted that consequent on her absorption,\n\nher contractual status has since changed, to that of a regular\n\n 36\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nGovernment servant, and this was not violative of her fundamental rights\n\nof equality. It was further submitted that the mere fact that the\n\nappointment of the applicant on contract basis was against a permanent\n\nvacant post does not mean that she is entitled to absorption from the\n\ndate of her initial contract appointment in a retrospective manner.\n\n48. Explaining the case of private respondent R-2 Shri Murlidharan\n\nPillai, it was submitted by R-1-NSCS that he was holding an analogous\n\npost in PMO when he was appointed as Joint Director with R-1-NSCS on\n\nabsorption basis w.e.f. 29.09.2006. Thereafter, since RRs of 2007, when\n\nthey were promulgated, provided that the NSCS officers with 5 years'\n\nregular service in the pay scale of Deputy Secretary/Joint Director were\n\neligible for promotion to the grade of Director, and since R-2 Shri Pillai\n\nhad by then completed 5 years of regular service with R-1 NSCS on\n\n28.09.2011, he was promoted to the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2011,\n\nas per the 2007 RRs, and on the basis of the recommendations of the\n\nSelection Committee.\n\n49. It was further submitted by R-1-NSCS that 11 years after her\n\njoining on contract basis, the applicant cannot question her joining as\n\nsuch, and since contract appointment is not akin to deputation, and in\n\nreply to para 5.16 of the OA it was submitted that only a serving regular\n\nemployee can be selected to come on deputation, for a specified tenure,\n\nwith the prior concurrence of his parent organization, and after\n\ncompletion of deputation tenure, reverts to his parent organization. It\n\nwas, therefore, submitted that even as per notified RRs, contract\n\nappointments and deputation appointments are two different modes of\n\n 37\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nappointments being made in NSCS. Any injustice having been meted out\n\nto the applicant was denied, and it was submitted that on all the\n\noccasions when the issue was raised by her, she had been informed that\n\npresently she was not eligible for promotion. Therefore, it was prayed\n\nthat the OA may be dismissed, with costs against the applicant.\n\n50. The applicant filed her rejoinder on 10.04.2015, more or less\n\nreiterating her contentions as already made out in the OA, which need\n\nnot be repeated here once again. It was reiterated by her that under the\n\nNSCS RRs of 2001, all initial appointments to regular/permanent posts\n\nwere to be made by the methods of (1) Contract/(2) deputation /(3)\n\nabsorption/(4) re-employment, and that there was no provision for any\n\nregular appointments whatsoever. It was submitted that as can be seen\n\nfrom Annexure R-12 of the respondent-R-1-NSCS's counter reply, DoP&T\n\nitself had termed those RRs as vague, and that the R-1-NSCS had further\n\ncomplicated the matters by having obtained waiver of consultation with\n\nUPSC, DoP&T, and Ministry of Finance for the recruitments made at\n\nhigher levels.\n\n51. It was further submitted that the respondent R-1-NSCS had\n\namended the RRs in the year 2007, which also are nothing but a mere\n\nrepetition of 2001 RRs, except that 'promotion' has been added as\n\nanother mode of making appointments. It was further submitted that for\n\nconsideration of her candidature for appointment to the post of Deputy\n\nSecretary, the Respondents had already treated her to have been holding\n\nthe analogous post of Research Fellow in IDSA on regular basis, and,\n\nlater, when her appointment on the post of Director was to be\n\n 38\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nconsidered, they had treated both her deputation period of two years in\n\nNSCS earlier (from 16.08.2000 to 26.09.2002) and three years of her\n\ncontract service from 2003, as the total 5 years of service on regular\n\nbasis, while considering her eligibility and making her a Director on\n\n29.09.2006. It was, therefore, submitted that now the R-1-NSCS cannot\n\ngo back from their having reckoned her eligibility of three years' service\n\nas regular service w.e.f. 2003, before her appointment as Director, for\n\nthe purpose of consideration of her case for promotion to the post of\n\nJoint Secretary.\n\n52. It was submitted that while the respondents had ignored her right\n\nof absorption from the very beginning, on the other hand, along with her\n\npromotion to the post of Director on 29.09.2006, the respondents had\n\nmade direct initial appointment of one Mr. Murlidharan Pillai as Deputy\n\nSecretary, as such from the same date when she became a Director, who,\n\nas a Deputy Secretary, was junior to her, and he could become Director\n\nonly on 29.09.2011. It was, therefore, submitted that for the period of 5\n\nyears from 29.09.2006 to 28.09.2011, private respondent R-2 had been\n\nher subordinate/junior. However, while private respondent R-2 was\n\npromoted as Director on regular basis earlier, w.e.f. 29.09.2011, the\n\napplicant was ordered to have been absorbed as Director more than six\n\nmonths later, only through the impugned order dated 12.04.2012,\n\nthereby making the private respondent R-2 as senior to the applicant,\n\nbecause of which she had also asked for her similar regularization with\n\neffect from the date of her initial appointment. Again discussing the case\n\nof Mrs. Shweta Bakshi, private respondent R-3, it was submitted by the\n\n 39\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\napplicant that she was absorbed/regularized on the post of Under\n\nSecretary on 04.12.2012, and, therefore, as per Rules, she ought to have\n\nbecome eligible for promotion to the next post of Deputy Secretary only\n\nafter 5 years of regular service. But, less than a year later, on\n\n06.11.2013, R-1-NSCS had promoted her to the post of Deputy\n\nSecretary, by reckoning her previous contract service, which reckoning of\n\nprevious contract service is being denied in the case of the applicant,\n\nand, therefore, she is being discriminated against.\n\n53. It was further submitted by the applicant that since the superior\n\nofficers of the R-1-NSCS were impressed with the applicant's\n\nperformance while on deputation, they had decided to initiate the\n\nprocess for her appointment against the permanent post of Deputy\n\nSecretary, and she had submitted her C.V. accordingly. Vide letter dated\n\n23.04.2003, she was asked to appear for written test, and the interview\n\nwas held on 08.05.2003, and then she was also asked to submit the 'No\n\nObjection Certificate' from IDSA for treating her as being nominated by\n\nthe IDSA, and also that she would be relieved and sent on deputation to\n\nthe respondent-organization in the event of her selection.\n\n54. It was submitted that in July-August 2003, she had been informed\n\nby R-1-NSCS regarding her having qualified in the selection process, and\n\nwhile the final approval of her selection/appointment was being obtained\n\nfrom the highest levels, she was asked to submit her resignation to the\n\nIDSA, and to remain ready for joining her services with the R-1-NSCS.\n\nAccordingly, on 08.08.2003, she had submitted her resignation from\n\nIDSA, but its acceptance was kept pending by IDSA, awaiting the joining\n\n 40\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nmessage from R-1-NSCS, and that during this interregnum period, she\n\nhad remained on the rolls of IDSA, as may be seen from the fact that on\n\n14.08.2003, the IDSA had even considered her proposal for going on\n\nforeign tour, and on 18.09.2003, the Director IDSA had approved her\n\napplication dated 10.09.2003 for sanction of leave till 30.09.2003\n\n(Annexure A-8 colly).\n\n55. It was submitted that on 29.09.2003, she had received a verbal\n\nmessage from her superiors in R-1-NSCS, asking her to join forthwith on\n\nthe post of Deputy Secretary, and, as a result, she had requested and\n\nwas relieved from IDSA on 30.09.2003, and her LPC had been issued,\n\nand after the intervening holidays, i.e., on 1st and 2nd October, 2003, she\n\nhad joined on 03.10.2003 on the post of Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of\n\nIndia with R-1-NSCS, which had later been Gazette notified. A true copy\n\nof the applicant's LPC dated 29.09.2003 issued by IDSA was submitted\n\nas Annexure A-26 (Page 256 of the paper book) which had in para 4\n\nstated that she had handed over the charge of her Office in IDSA on 30th\n\nSeptember, 2013.\n\n56. It was further submitted by the applicant that she had all along\n\nbeen under the impression that her eligibility for the post of Deputy\n\nSecretary was reckoned under Clause 12 (iii) of NSCS RRs of 2001, by\n\nreckoning her total Group 'A' service of 9 years with IDSA, also as\n\nqualifying service, and it is now only that the respondents have stated in\n\ntheir counter reply that she had been appointed not on the basis of her 9\n\nyears of Group 'A' Service in IDSA, but only because she was holding\n\n 41\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nanalogous post in IDSA, and it has further been admitted by the\n\nrespondents that they had treated her as holding the analogous post of\n\nResearch Fellow with IDSA on regular basis on the date of appointment,\n\nand, therefore, they could not allege any gap in her appointment, and in\n\nthe light of the letter dated 23.04.2003, and the NOC given by the IDSA,\n\nshe was bound to be treated as a candidate nominated by IDSA, and,\n\nthus, entitled for her reckoning of her past service in IDSA.\n\n57. It was further submitted that the respondents have now only\n\nrevealed that they had reckoned her two spells of service with them, i.e.,\n\ndeputation from 16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, and contract service from\n\n03.10.2003 to 28.09.2006, i.e., a total of 5 years of service, to consider\n\nher eligibility for the post of Director, and when this is seen in the light of\n\nClause 12 (ii) of the NSCS RRs 2001, it can only mean that the\n\nrespondents had treated the 5 years' period of her service with them, first\n\non deputation from IDSA, and then on contract, as regular service, and\n\nthey cannot now deny that to have been regular service. It was further\n\nsubmitted that since the respondents have admitted to have treated the\n\napplicant's previous service in IDSA since May 1994 as well as NSCS\n\nservice with them as regular service, she has to be held to be entitled to\n\nall benefits, including absorption with R-1-NSCS w.e.f. 03.10.2003, and,\n\ntherefore, eligible for consideration for promotion to the post of Joint\n\nSecretary as on 29.09.2009, or the applicable cut off date fixed as per\n\nrules after the said date.\n\n 42\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n58. It was reiterated that though the respondents' orders (Annexure A-\n\n2 to A-3) are supposedly based on internal consultation with DoP&T and\n\nMinistry of Law, but on the basis of incorrect and half baked facts, and\n\nare contrary to the respondents' own conduct vis-a-vis other officers, and\n\nits RRs, as well as against the settled law. It was reiterated that\n\nrespondents have already promoted three officers by reckoning their\n\ncontract service as regular service, but had denied to her similar\n\ntreatment in respect of her appointment w.e.f. 03.10.2003 to the post of\n\nDeputy Secretary on similar contract basis, and also her further\n\npromotion vide appointment letter dated 29.09.2006 to the post of\n\nDirector, both of which were proper appointments in the civil posts, duly\n\nnotified in the Gazette of India. It was submitted that the applicant's\n\ncontract of appointment was not a proper contract, under the \nContract\n\nAct\n, but was subject to CCS Rules, and the applicant had all along\n\nenjoyed the appropriate status, which was extended to her, and\n\ncontinued unilaterally by the Govt. of India.\n\n59. It was further submitted that her previous employment under IDSA\n\nwas also as per the RRs of IDSA, against the permanent vacant posts,\n\nand it was wrong to state that her appointment dated 17.05.1994 in\n\nIDSA against a Group 'A' post of Research Officer was on contract basis,\n\nas, rather, it was a regular appointment, and was regulated by CCS\n\nRules. It was submitted that though it was labelled as temporary initially\n\nfor two years, upon successful completion of the probation period of one\n\nyear, it was later continued, and the applicant had even earned her\n\npromotion also in the regular course, in the higher pay scale of\n\n 43\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nRs.12000-18000, which was the promotion methodology in IDSA, and\n\nshe was also granted all benefits attached to the higher pay scale and\n\nannual increments. It was submitted that as on 16.08.2000, when she\n\nwas deputed to work with NSCS for a 2 years' period, the applicant was\n\nworking in IDSA on a Group 'A' post of Research Fellow in the pay scale\n\nof Rs.12000-18000. It was submitted that IDSA being a sister\n\norganization of NSCS, it is a common practice in between both these\n\norganizations to depute officers to each other. In that process, the R-1\n\nNSCS had first taken her on deputation against the post of Deputy\n\nSecretary, Govt. of India w.e.f. 16.08.2000, in the same pay scale as in\n\nIDSA, and she had served with NSCS for more than two years, till\n\n27.09.2002, and such deputation appointment was made in compliance\n\nof the NSCS RRs of 2001, which provided for\n\ndeputation/contract/absorption/re-employment as being the only modes\n\nof appointment in NSCS, and stating that R-1 NSCS had taken her\n\nservices from IDSA on 'loan basis' was a travesty of justice.\n\n60. It was further submitted that the respondent No.1 NSCS's reply\n\ncreates a false impression as if she had resigned her Group 'A'\n\nappointment with IDSA without any reasons whatsoever, as if she was\n\nwandering about, when on 03.10.2003 R-1 NSCS had suddenly\n\nappointed her on the post of Deputy Secretary to the Government of\n\nIndia. It was reiterated that once she had returned from her first\n\ndeputation with NSCS to IDSA, the superior officers in R-1-NSCS had\n\ninitiated the process for her substantive appointment in NSCS against\n\nthe permanent vacant post of Deputy Secretary, as per its RRs. The\n\n 44\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nrecruitment process undertaken had included a written test, and an\n\ninterview, both of which were held in May, 2003, and the applicant had\n\nsuccessfully qualified. When only the formal approval of her\n\nappointment on the said post in the office of R-1-NSCS was under\n\nprocess, she was asked to resign from IDSA, and to be ready to join the\n\nrespondent R-1-NSCS's office.\n\n61. It was further reiterated that though the applicant had tendered\n\nher resignation from IDSA on 08.08.2003, but she continued to serve\n\nIDSA till 30.09.2003, as per the service record and L.P.C. filed by her,\n\nand she was relieved by IDSA on 30.09.2003, and after the intervening\n\nholidays, she joined NSCS on the first available date on 03.10.2003 on\n\nthe post of Deputy Secretary. It was further submitted that the IDSA\n\norder dated 30.09.2003, which had stated that her resignation had been\n\naccepted w.e.f. 10.08.2003, was contrary to the L.P.C. dated 29.09.2003\n\n(Annexure A-26), and had in fact been never delivered to her, but must\n\nhave been only kept in her personal file, which was sent to R-1 NSCS.\n\n62. It was further reiterated that her promotion to the post of Director\n\nwas also not in question for more than 10 years, and it was now only\n\nthat the R-1 NSCS had started acting in a foul manner, to make a case of\n\nbreak in her continuous service, in order to be able to decline her request\n\nfor promotion to the post of Joint Secretary. It was submitted that the\n\nstand of R-1-NSCS was inconsistent with the fact that she was not only\n\non rolls of IDSA till 30.09.2003 as mentioned above, but also, as late as\n\non 14.08.2003, the IDSA had even considered her proposal for foreign\n\ntour, and on 18.09.2003 the Director, IDSA had approved her leave\n\n 45\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\napplication dated 10.09.2003 for sanction of leave till 30.09.2003\n\n(Annexure A-8 colly).\n\n63. It was submitted that though in the matters of appointments, R-1\n\nNSCS has been exempted from the purview of UPSC and DoP&T, but the\n\nRRs (Annexure A-12 & A-16) provide for peculiar manner of making\n\nappointments, i.e., only by modes of contract/deputation/absorption/\n\nre-employment for the permanent Group 'A' posts, by searching for the\n\nsuitable persons in a discreet manner. For promotions to higher posts\n\nalso, the same mode is adopted, though a fresh contract of appointment\n\nis issued, while treating the same as promotion for all purposes. It was\n\npleaded that it was only because of this that the R-1 NSCS had rightly\n\ntreated the applicant's appointment dated 29.09.2006 on the post of\n\nDirector as promotion, thus supporting her submission that her initial\n\nappointment dated 03.10.2003 itself was in the nature of a regular\n\nappointment, entitling her to all service benefits, and career progression.\n\n64. It was further submitted that the Government of India's order dated\n\n27.09.2011 (Annexure A-17) purportedly extending her contract\n\nappointment as Director for a period of one more year, w.e.f. 29.09.2011\n\nto 28.09.21012, on the existing terms and conditions, was issued in\n\nexercise of its unilateral powers, on which the applicant has no control.\n\nIt was, therefore, prayed that both her initial appointment as Deputy\n\nSecretary, as well as her promotion to the post of Director, were in the\n\nnature of regular appointments.\n\n65. It was later on only, through the new RRs 2007, that in the\n\neligibility conditions the words 'total continuous service' were inserted in\n\n 46\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nplace of 'total service'. It was further submitted that respondents have\n\nnot correctly quoted the RRs in respect of appointments to the posts of\n\nJoint Secretary, which had actually been produced by her by way of\n\nAnnexure A-16 (at page 80 of the paper-book of the OA). It was\n\nsubmitted that since the R-1 NSCS is exempted from the purview of\n\nDoP&T/UPSC/Ministry of Finance guidelines, it had been taking its own\n\ndecisions in an arbitrary manner, and in the cases of R-2 Shri\n\nMurlidharan Pillai and R-3 Miss Shweta Bakshi etc., they were\n\nregularized with their past contract service being reckoned for the\n\npurposes of promotion, without any reference to DoP&T or Law Ministry,\n\nand that the R-1 NSCS is now bound by its own precedents.\n\n66. It was denied by the applicant that her employment with IDSA was\n\nonly on contract basis throughout, and it was submitted that like other\n\nsimilarly placed employees, she would also have been eligible for pension\n\nunder CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, if she had continued in the IDSA. It\n\nwas further submitted that it was wrong on the part of the respondents\n\nto say that as per the Guidelines for recruitment of officers in R-1-NSCS,\n\nabsorption can only be done \"in rare cases\", and after completion of a\n\nminimum tenure of five years in NSCS in an outstanding manner, which\n\nGuidelines are not at all in existence, and which have not been adhered\n\nto by the R-1-NSCS in the past, and that the private respondent R-2 was\n\nadmittedly not only absorbed in violation of those very Guidelines, cited,\n\nbut not produced, but he has even been allowed to steal a march over\n\nher.\n\n 47\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n67. It was further submitted that only when she started asking for her\n\nfurther promotion, and consideration of her case for the post of Joint\n\nSecretary, that the respondents had acted maliciously, and with bias,\n\nand had illegally issued an order dated 20.10.2014, ostensibly trying to\n\ncorrect their order dated 29.09.2006 issued eight years' back, just to be\n\nable to deprive her of her legal rights, and, therefore, the said order dated\n\n20.10.2014 is non-est in the eyes of law, and has to be discarded,\n\nbecause changing the words 'promotion' to 'selection' in the order dated\n\n06.10.2006 after a gap of more than eight years, through order dated\n\n20.10.2014, is nothing but a mala fide attempt to deprive her of her legal\n\nrights.\n\n68. The contention of the respondent No.1-NSCS that her previous\n\ndeputation from IDSA to R-1-NSCS was 'on loan basis' was denied, on\n\nthe basis of Annexure R-3 of the counter reply, wherein it has been\n\nclearly stated that she was deputed for a period of one year from\n\n16.08.2000 and during the period of her deputation she was to draw her\n\npay and allowances from R-1-NSCS. It was further submitted that the\n\nrespondents have admitted that she was already holding an analogous\n\npost in IDSA, and that her candidature for appointment had been\n\nconsidered by treating her holding the analogous post of Research Fellow\n\nin IDSA on regular basis. Therefore, all the averments of the respondent\n\nNo.R-1-NSCS, denying her the benefit of 09 years' Group 'A' service in\n\nIDSA, by taking the plea that it was on contract basis, were termed by\n\nher to be wrong.\n\n 48\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n69. It was submitted that respondents have made a new revelation that\n\nthe basis of her appointment to the post of Director on 29.09.2006 was\n\nher service with them in the grade of Deputy Secretary for five years, in\n\ntwo spells, of working on contract, i.e., firstly while on deputation from\n\nIDSA from 16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, and secondly for three years of her\n\nholding the regular post of Deputy Secretary, in NSCS since 03.10.2003.\n\nIt was, therefore, submitted that from this, it is apparent that the R-1-\n\nNSCS had in 2006 itself treated the applicant having rendered five years\n\nof regular service with them in the grade of Rs.12000-16500/-, only on\n\nbasis of which she was found to be qualified for appointment to the post\n\nof Director in NSCS. Therefore, after having treated her deputation from\n\nIDSA with R-1-NSCS, and later service, though called as contract service,\n\nas regular service with NSCS for the purpose of her being qualified for\n\nappointment to the post of Director, now, at this stage, they cannot be\n\nallowed to take a turn, and deny to her the eligibility for the post of Joint\n\nSecretary, by reckoning her appointment dated 29.09.2006 as Director\n\nnot as a regular appointment, and considering her to be eligible for being\n\nconsidered for the post of Joint Secretary on completion of her three\n\nyears' tenure on 29.09.2009, in terms of 2007 RRs.\n\n70. It was further submitted by the applicant that when the\n\nrespondents had on 03.10.2003 considered her to have held analogous\n\npost in IDSA in the past, now that past service in an analogous post in\n\nIDSA cannot be discarded, due to an alleged break in service, which was\n\nnot true. It was submitted that respondents have acted in a mala fide\n\nmanner, and when she had first represented, and then served a legal\n\n 49\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nnotice also claiming her rights, on the basis of the order dated\n\n06.10.2006, which clearly stated that her appointment to the post of\n\nDirector w.e.f. 29.09.2006 was on promotion, the respondent No.1-NSCS\n\nhad no choice but to consider her candidature for the post of Joint\n\nSecretary, and just to deliberately deny her that, they had acted with\n\nbias, and had attempted to tamper with that order in the year 2014,\n\nmore than 08 years later, and had now amended their order of\n\n06.10.2006, which was patently illegal, and that the said amended order\n\nhas to be held to be an invalid order. It was further submitted that the\n\nrespondents have not denied the correctness and the applicability of the\n\nratio of the Hon'ble Apex Court's judgment on the issue of continuous\n\nservice, and the fallacy of respondent No.1-NSCS 's plea regarding an\n\nalleged break in service.\n\n71. It was reiterated by the applicant in her rejoinder that she had\n\nbecome eligible for the post of Joint Secretary in October, 2011 itself, on\n\ncompletion of five years' of regular service as Director. The cases of the\n\nprivate respondents were, therefore, once again described by the\n\napplicant in her own manner, which we shall discuss and appreciate in\n\nan appropriate manner later. Particularly in the case of private\n\nrespondent R-4 Shri Rohit Khera, the applicant had reiterated that it was\n\nan admitted case of the respondents that he had throughout worked at\n\nthe residence of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, as Comptroller, in the grade\n\nof a Deputy Secretary, and that he had never been promoted on the post\n\nof Joint Secretary through any orders of DoP&T or ACC for such\n\n 50\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\npromotion. It was further submitted that, therefore, his appointment in\n\nR-1-NSCS itself was in violation of NSCS RRs, as there is no provision for\n\ncreating any vacancy through the permanent transfer of a post, as stated\n\nby R-1-NSCS, nor can an officer be said to be holding the post of Joint\n\nSecretary merely because he draws salary which falls in that pay scale.\n\nIt was submitted that though he had already attained the normal age of\n\nsuperannuation, but till date he was still working on the post of\n\nAdditional Secretary in NSCS.\n\n72. The applicant had thereafter cited the Hon'ble Delhi High Court's\n\njudgment in the case of \nJuliana Loieau v. British High Commission\n,[\n\n2012 (130) DRJ 552] in which it had been held that the origin of every\n\nservice of employment is an offer and its acceptance, which amounts to a\n\ncontract, but when pursuant to such a contract the employment\n\nassumes a status akin to services under the Union and the States, and\n\nwhere the Statutes like \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n, etc. intervene, or\n\nwhere the service is statutorily regulated, then it can be argued that the\n\nconditions of service would be governed by terms beyond the letter of\n\noffer, on terms whereof the appointment had been offered. Therefore, it\n\nwas submitted by the applicant that since all the CCS Rules were made\n\napplicable to her after her accepting the offer of appointment, and the\n\ncontract to define since the conditions of service went much beyond the\n\nletter of offer, on terms whereof the appointment was offered to her, and\n\nsuch rules were made applicable, her contractual employment assumed\n\na status akin to services under the Union and the States.\n\n 51\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n73. Because the respondents have admitted that the terms and\n\nconditions as mentioned in the contract were nothing but prescribing the\n\napplication or otherwise of the statutory rules, which may be framed and\n\naltered unilaterally by the Government without the consent of the\n\nemployee, it was submitted by the applicant that that being so the\n\ncontract appointment also fell within the provisions of \nArticles 309\n and\n\n311\n of the Constitution of India. It was further submitted that the\n\nrespondents had not denied that the law as \nlaid down in\n \nRoshan Lal\n\nTandon v. Union of India\n (supra) and UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal\n\nBaghela (supra) would apply, more so because she had been appointed\n\nas per the RRs in vogue, and was also held to be entitled to all benefits of\n\nregular appointments. It was, therefore, submitted that the respondent\n\nR-1-NSCS's reply to the OA is false and baseless, and the averments\n\nmade in the OA were reiterated.\n\n74. In order to counter the detailed rejoinder submitted by the\n\napplicant, the official respondent R-1-NSCS filed a sur-rejoinder on\n\n30.06.2015 denying that any discrimination or bias had been meted out\n\nto the applicant, as alleged. It was also denied that the DoP&T had\n\ntermed the RRs of R-1-NSCS as vague, and it was submitted that DoP&T\n\nhad only made certain observations in regard to the length of service in\n\nthe lower grade prescribed for appointment as Joint Secretary, and had,\n\ntherefore, asked for clarification/validation in consultation with the\n\nMinistry of Law & Justice, Department of Legal Affairs. It was submitted\n\nthat the Ministry of Law & Justice had thereafter found the provision of\n\n 52\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n17 years' of continuous Group 'A' Service as correct for promotion to the\n\npost of Joint Secretary.\n\n75. It was further submitted in this sur-rejoinder that NSCS is\n\nexempted from consultation with UPSC only, and wherever required,\n\nadvice and approval of DoP&T, Ministry of Finance etc. is obtained in\n\nvarious matters, including recruitment.\n\n76. It was further submitted that while reviewing the RRs of 2001, it\n\nwas found that there was no provision for career progression of contract\n\nofficers of R-1-NSCS who, could only be absorbed based on their\n\noutstanding performance, and, therefore, in the RRs of 2007 the clause\n\nregarding 'Promotion' was added, in order to benefit such exceptional\n\nofficers who would otherwise have stagnated, and that the revised RRs of\n\n2007 were issued with the approval of Hon'ble Prime Minister, DoP&T\n\nand Ministry of Law & Justice. The DoP&T opinion, as already mentioned\n\nin the counter-reply, was thereafter repeated. They had once again\n\nexplained the cases of R-2 Shri Murlidharan Pillai, and R-3 Miss Shweta\n\nBakshi.\n\n77. It was further submitted that after her selection for appointment to\n\nNSCS, the applicant was asked to obtain a 'No Objection Certificate' from\n\nher the then employer, IDSA, stating that they have no objection to NSCS\n\nin considering her candidature, and that she would be relieved and sent\n\non deputation in the event of her selection. However, since she could not\n\nobtain the requisite NOC from IDSA for her appointment to R-1-NSCS on\n\ndeputation basis, therefore, she had resigned from IDSA, and had also\n\navailed all terminal benefits, including encashment of leave, from that\n\n 53\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\noffice, and it is incorrect of her to say that she had submitted the\n\nrequisite NOC from the IDSA.\n\n78. Her contention with regard to her appointment with IDSA having\n\ncontinued till 30.09.2003 was thereafter once again denied, and it was\n\nsubmitted that even the LPC issued by the IDSA on 29.09.2003\n\n(Annexure A.26) is not relevant, as she had joined NSCS on a fresh\n\nappointment, on contract basis, after resigning from IDSA, and availing\n\nall terminal benefits. However, at the same time, it was admitted that\n\nshe was holding an analogous post in IDSA on contract basis, because of\n\nwhich her candidature was considered, and she was appointed as\n\nDeputy Secretary in NSCS on contract basis w.e.f. 03.10.2003.\n\n79. It was further reiterated by R-1-NSCS that though in the order of\n\nher appointment as Director issued in 2006, the word 'Promotion' had\n\nbeen included inadvertently, but the same order had also mentioned that\n\nher appointment was on the terms and conditions of service as laid down\n\nin the agreement of contract, and even her pay was fixed at the minimum\n\nof the pay scale of Director, and since the word \"promotion\" had been\n\nwrongly mentioned, that has since been modified on 20.10.2014,\n\nthrough Annexure R-13. It was further submitted that her appointment\n\nwith IDSA was on contract basis as per her service records at Annexure\n\nR-2 and R-3 of the counter-reply of R-1-NSCS, which also goes to show\n\nthat she had joined NSCS earlier \"on loan basis\", and not on deputation\n\nbasis, and that she was relieved from IDSA w.e.f. 10.08.2003, and she\n\nhad joined R-1 NSCS on 03.10.2003. Her contentions in regard to the\n\n 54\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nperiod in between, and that she was considered by IDSA for a foreign\n\ntour, or was sanctioned leave etc. were termed to be misleading, and not\n\nsupported by any proper orders issued by the IDSA.\n\n80. It was further submitted that appointing a person on contract/re-\n\nemployment, as per RRs, against a regular post, does not bestow upon\n\nthe incumbent the status of a regular Government servant, when the\n\nRRs themselves have a provision to appoint an individual on contract\n\nbasis on those posts. All other averments, as already discussed in detail\n\nwhile discussing the counter-reply earlier filed were repeated. The\n\naverments made by the applicant in respect of handling of cases of the\n\nprivate respondents were also denied. An attempt was made by R-1-\n\nNSCS to argue the specific cases of private respondents, particularly that\n\nof R-4 Mr. Rohit Khera, which approach itself is per se impermissible as\n\nper law.\n\n81. It was denied that irrespective of the mode of appointment, all\n\nofficers are entitled to be at par in the matter of service, seniority and\n\ncareer progression. It was submitted that the officers of R-1-NSCS are\n\nappointed through various different modes, as prescribed in the RRs\n\n(earlier 2001 RRs, and now 2007 RRs), and they are all governed by\n\neither the Central Civil Service Rules, or All India Service Rules etc., and,\n\ntherefore, the officers who have been appointed on contract basis, or on\n\nre-employment basis, cannot be treated at par in respect of matters\n\nrelating to seniority and promotion, since the question of maintaining a\n\nsingle seniority list of such appointees, and promoting them to the next\n\n 55\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nhigher grade, arises only after they have been absorbed, and that the\n\nseniority and promotions in respect of officers on deputation with R-1-\n\nNSCS is taken care of by their respective Cadre Controlling Authorities.\n\nTherefore, it was again prayed that the OA be dismissed with costs\n\nagainst the applicant.\n\n82. All the four private respondents filed their separate counter-replies\n\nalso. Private respondents R-2 to R-5 had in their written submissions\n\ndated 22.01.2016 submitted that they are not inclined to file any\n\nseparate reply in the matter, and would adopt the counter-reply already\n\nfiled by R-1-NSCS in the aforesaid OA. With this the pleadings were\n\ncompleted.\n\n83. Heard. As already mentioned above, the case was argued in great\n\ndetail on two dates of hearing. Thereafter, the learned counsels also\n\nsubmitted written submissions of their arguments. In the written\n\nsubmissions filed on behalf of the applicant, most of the arguments as\n\nadvanced, along the lines of the OA and the rejoinder, were reiterated.\n\nIt was further submitted that her previous Employer IDSA had actually\n\nforwarded her application for the post of Deputy Secretary with R-1\n\nNSCS along with NOC itself, but, during the course of recruitment\n\nprocess of written test and interview conducted in August 2003, the R-1\n\nNSCS had asked her to submit resignation from IDSA, if she was ready\n\nto join to the post of Deputy Secretary on a permanent basis. It was\n\nsubmitted that the applicant is a renowned research scholar, and she\n\nwas assured by R-1-NSCS that though her appointment was being made\n\n 56\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nagainst a permanent sanctioned vacant post, initially the appointment\n\norder would be only for a contract of two years, and she was further\n\nassured that it was akin to regular appointment, along with reasoning\n\ngiven that the R-1-NSCS's RRs provide for appointment only through\n\nthe modes of contract for new entrants, or otherwise on deputation for\n\ntemporary appointments, absorption and re-employment etc. It was\n\nsubmitted that she had been further assured that she would be\n\nabsorbed/given regular status from the initial date of her joining itself,\n\nby maintaining the seniority, as well as reckoning her past service in\n\nIDSA.\n\n84. It was further reiterated that her appointment, which was Gazette\n\nnotified also, came to be regulated under \nArticles 309\n to 313 of the\n\nConstitution of India, and that she was even treated at par with regular\n\nGovt. Officers in the matters of Leave, LTC, Leave Salary, Travelling\n\nAllowances and all other entitlements/improvements sanctioned\n\nsubsequently, as per DoP&T order dated 12.04.1985. It was further\n\nsubmitted that the fixity of tenure under the contract of appointment\n\nsigned by her on 03.10.2003 was neither the essence of that contract,\n\nnor substantial to that contract, and that she had continued to be in\n\nservice without any fresh contract being signed, merely by R-1-NSCS\n\nissuing administrative orders extending her tenure, and giving her the\n\nbenefit of seniority/pay protection/increments.\n\n85. It was further submitted that even though her appointment Order\n\nas Director stated such appointment to be on contractual basis for a\n\n 57\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nperiod of 5 years, it incorporated all the service conditions akin to regular\n\nappointments, and was also on a permanent sanctioned and vacant post,\n\nand was made by fully following the then prevailing RRs, and the word\n\n'Promotion' had been correctly used, since it is settled law that promotion\n\nis an incidence of regular appointment. Her contention again was that all\n\nalong she was under the impression that she has been selected under\n\nClause 12 (iii) of the RRs for the post of Deputy Secretary, which\n\nimpression has been shattered now only by the respondent No.1 NSCS\n\nstating on record that she was selected under Clause 12 (i) of the RRs, by\n\ntreating her to have held analogous post on regular basis in her earlier\n\nparent organization-IDSA. Further, it was submitted that when for the\n\npurpose of counting the service requirement of 5 years for considering\n\nher case for promotion as a Director, the respondents had even counted\n\nher first deputation tenure with them (during her substantive\n\nappointment with IDSA) from 18.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, and had added\n\nto that the three years' contract tenure on the post of Deputy Secretary\n\nwith them from 03.10.2003 to 28.09.2006, the respondents cannot be\n\nallowed to make a 'U' turn now, and to state that her appointment with\n\nher previous Employer IDSA, as well as her appointment with R-1 NSCS\n\non the post of Deputy Secretary, and also on the post of Director, were\n\nnever on regular service, when this Tribunal had in the case of Dr. S.D.\n\nPradhan vs. NSCS (supra) already held that since during the period of\n\nhis contract employment, Dr. Pradhan had been given several\n\npromotions, his contract employment was as good as the regular\n\nemployment, since fixity of tenure was never indicated in the\n\nappointment on contract basis, and was not adhered to also. \nShe had\n\n 58\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nsought shelter behind the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nRoshan Lal Tandon vs. Union of India\n (supra) followed in the case of\n\nUPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal Baghela (supra).\n\n86. It was further submitted that when the R-1 NSCS had already\n\nadmitted her past service with them (when she was an employee in IDSA,\n\nand was on deputation with them) in NSCS as regular service while\n\nconsidering her case for appointing/promoting her as Director, the\n\nintention and purpose behind the impugned order dated 12.04.2012\n\ncould not be elicited. Further reliance has been placed upon the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court judgment in \nDTC vs. DTC Mazdoor Union\n (1991) 1 Suppl.\n\nSCC 600, and, in particulars paragraphs-223 to 225 and Para 264 of\n\nthat judgment, which were reproduced in the written arguments\n\nsubmitted.\n\n87. It was, therefore, reiterated that she is entitled to fair and just\n\ntreatment with regard to her mode of appointment by absorption, and\n\nmaintenance of her seniority over private respondent R-2. All other\n\narguments, as already discussed, were reiterated, and it was submitted\n\nthat if her Group 'A' service with IDSA is counted to compute 17 years of\n\nGroup 'A' service, even counting the alleged gap of 01 month and 22\n\ndays, if not on 04.05.2011, she would have completed her 17 years of\n\neligible experience at least on 26.06.2011, and, therefore, she should be\n\nconsidered eligible for the post of Joint Secretary as on 01.07.2011, as\n\nnormally 1st of July is the cut off date for consideration of eligibility for\n\npromotions in R-1-NSCS.\n\n 59\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n88. It was further submitted that the alleged break in her continuous\n\nservice, a point which has been introduced by the respondents now only,\n\nis an afterthought, discriminatory and baseless, and without any\n\nmeaning, and on the question of continuous service, reliance had once\n\nagain been placed upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of \nBanaras Hindu University Varanasi and Another vs. Dr.\n\nIndra Pratap Singh\n (supra).\n\n89. It was reiterated that she was actually and factually relieved from\n\nthe IDSA only on 30.09.2003, and had then joined on the post of Deputy\n\nSecretary with R-1-NSCS on the very next available working day, on\n\n03.10.2003, and that there was no break in her continuous Group 'A'\n\nservice, and merely because IDSA had passed an order behind her back,\n\nstating that she had been relieved retrospectively w.e.f. 10.08.2003, on a\n\ngenuine error of overlooking her sanctioned leave upto 30.09.2003, the\n\nsame cannot be raised as a ground to deny her continuity of service. The\n\ncases of the private respondents were once again discussed, which need\n\nnot be repeated here once again.\n\n90. In their written submissions, the respondent R-1-NSCS had once\n\nagain denied the eligibility of the applicant for her absorption from the\n\nback date, i.e., on 03.10.2003, and the aspects of gap of 01 month and\n\n22 days, and her availing of all terminal benefits, leave encashment etc.\n\nfrom IDSA were again mentioned. It was further reiterated that even\n\nthough the applicant has claimed weightage of her past service rendered\n\nby her in IDSA, but since the DoP&T has opined that no such counting of\n\n 60\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nher past service is permissible, since that service was rendered on\n\ncontract basis, and not on regular basis, and it cannot now be taken into\n\naccount for counting of 17 years' continuous regular service. The\n\napplicant's contention regarding the order promoting her w.e.f.\n\n29.09.2006 as Director was again denied, stating that the RRs of 2001\n\nhad no provision for promotion, which promotion had been included only\n\nin the revised RRs effective from 22.12.2007, and, therefore, it could not\n\nbe held that she was promoted in 2006 as a Director, which was actually\n\nonly a fresh contract appointment, and that the office order dated\n\n06.10.2006, containing the word 'Promotion', already stood rectified vide\n\norder dated 20.10.2014 (Annexure R-13). It was, therefore, submitted\n\nthat the applicant does not at all fulfil the eligibility criteria of 17 years of\n\ncontinuous Group 'A' Service, which is required for consideration of her\n\ncase for the post of Joint Secretary. The individual cases of private\n\nrespondents were thereafter once again discussed, which need not be\n\nrepeated here once again.\n\nDISCUSSION ON THE POINTS OF LAW INVOLVED\n\n91. After having heard the case in great detail, we have given our\n\nanxious consideration to the facts and law concerning the instant case.\n\nThe first thing which has to be decided is about the nature of\n\nemployment into which the applicant had entered with R-1 NSCS from\n\n03.10.2003. It is an admitted fact from both sides that her selection for\n\nthat post was done as per the NSCS RRs of 2001 then in vogue for\n\nappointments to the posts of Deputy Secretaries of R-1 NSCS. The\n\napplicant has claimed that it was a regular and substantive\n\n 61\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nappointment, even though it was given effect to by way of her signing a\n\ncontract for a period of two years, which was in the nature of an\n\nagreement, a copy of which has been produced by the applicant at\n\nAnnexure A-10 of her OA.\n\n92. It is seen that para-2 of that supposed contract agreement provided\n\nfor that she may be required to devote her whole time to the duties\n\nassigned to her, and that she should at all times obey the Rules,\n\nincluding the Central Government Servants' (Conduct) Rules. Para-3 (iii)\n\nof that agreement even provided for 3 months' notice being required from\n\neither side for termination of that agreement, or 3 months' salary in lieu\n\nof notice from the side of the Government. Para-4 provided that in case\n\nof any misconduct by her, the applicant could be suspended. Para-5\n\nprovided for the scale of pay, DA, CCA etc. at the rates admissible under\n\nthe Central Government Rules. Para-6 provided for the applicant being\n\neligible to leave and leave salary etc. in terms of DoP&T OM dated\n\n12.04.1985. Para-7 provided for the applicant to be entitled to Travelling\n\nAllowance in terms of Rules supplementary to Fundamental Rules. Para-\n\n8 provided for her being entitled to receive the benefits of any\n\nimprovement in the terms and conditions of her service. Para-9 provided\n\nfor her pay and leave salary to be subject to any emergency cut that may\n\nbe ordered by the Government. Para-10 provided for the provisions of\n\nCCS (CCA) Rules, and Rules made thereunder, and any Rules made and\n\ndeemed to be made under \nArticle 309\n or continued under \nArticle 313\n of\n\nthe Constitution to the extent to which they are applicable to the service,\n\nwhich she was joining, being applicable to her. That agreement had been\n\n 62\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nsigned by the applicant and an existing Deputy Secretary, NSCS, and an\n\nUnder Secretary being her two witnesses, and the Joint Secretary Dr.\n\nS.D. Pradhan signing on behalf of President of India, with his signatures\n\nalso being witnessed and attested by the very same Deputy Secretary and\n\nUnder Secretary, as witnesses on his behalf, who were the attesting\n\nwitnesses of the witnesses of the applicant also. There were no\n\nindependent/different witnesses who had attested to have been\n\nwitnessed to the signatures affixed first by the applicant, and then by the\n\nsaid Joint Secretary, Dr. S.D. Pradhan, to that supposed contractual\n\nagreement.\n\n93. The Gazette Notification at Annexure A-11 had clearly stated that\n\nthe President is pleased to appoint the applicant as Deputy Secretary,\n\nNSCS, for a period of two years, or until further orders, whichever is\n\nearlier, and that Notification published in the Gazette of India Part-1\n\nSection-2\n did not have any cross reference or mention of such\n\nappointment being subject to an appointment agreement (Annexure A-\n\n10). This Gazette Notification, therefore, was the last nail in the coffin of\n\nthe supposed contract agreement signed on 03.10.2003 by the applicant\n\nand a Joint Secretary of NSCS, in the absence of any independent\n\ndifferent witnesses attesting to the veracity of the agreement having been\n\nsigned by the applicant out of her own free will.\n\n94. It is trite law that any appointment is given effect to by an employer\n\nthrough an offer of appointment, which, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in \"\nRoshan Lal Tandon\n\" (supra), is in the nature of contract\n\n 63\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nemployment. Like in every contract, even in the case of a contract for\n\npublic employment, the offer of appointment made to a candidate sought\n\nto be employed, and his/her acceptance of that offer, form the basis of\n\nhis/her appointment, enabling him to join against the post for which\n\nhe/she had been selected. Such an appointment is made against a\n\nvacancy, and in a post, and this positive and deliberate act of\n\nengagement creates a relationship of an employee and the employer in\n\nbetween the two parties, and is the starting point in the career of every\n\npublic servant in public employment.\n \nSuch appointment confers a\n\nstatus, and ensures all the rights attached to public service, including\n\nconfirmation, seniority, promotion and so on. It was held by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in \"\nRoshan Lal Tandon\n\" (supra), that once appointed to\n\nhis post or office, the Government Servant acquires an status, and his\n\nrights and obligations are no longer determined by the consent of both\n\nparties, but by statute or statutory rules, though these rules may be\n\nframed and altered unilaterally by the Government.\n\n95. As has been held by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in\n\nthe case of \nBasant Lal Malhotra vs. State of Punjab & Ors.\n AIR 1969\n\n(P&H) 178, an appointment means an actual act of posting a person to a\n\nparticular office.\n \nThe same position of law was later upheld by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nPrafulla Kumar Swain vs.\n\nPrakash Chandra Misra & Others\n 1993 SCC (L&S) 960, when it was\n\nheld that an appointment means an actual act of posting a person to a\n\n 64\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nparticular office, and anything short of it cannot be construed as an\n\nappointment.\n\n96. On the other hand, the law is also very well settled in respect of a\n\npurely contractual employment. An employment can also be purely in\n\nthe nature of contractual employment, and, unless it is governed by a\n\nstatute or Statutory Rules, it was held that the \nIndian Contract Act\n\nwould not only be applicable to the formulation of the contract, as also to\n\nthe determination thereof, as was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of \nBank of India vs. O.P. Swarankar\n AIR 2003 SC 858=(2003)\n\n2 SCC 721.\n\n97. However, the concomitants of a purely contractual employment\n\nwith the Government were most clearly explained and \nlaid down by\n the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal\n\nBaghela (supra), which the applicant has produced at Annexure A-23 of\n\nher OA. In that judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was dealing with\n\nthe case of a person who was appointed as a Drugs Inspector purely on\n\nad hoc or contractual basis, and that appointment was meant to come to\n\nan end automatically, with the efflux of time, after which the person\n\nholding that contractual appointment/post was not to have any right to\n\ncontinue in that post, even though the concerned person may have been\n\ncontinued from time to time on similar ad hoc basis, beyond the initially\n\nprescribed contractual period. In that case, it was held by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court that when a person is employed purely under a contract,\n\nit is only that the contract alone which would govern the terms of\n\nappointment of such contractual employee in respect of his service, and\n\n 65\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nnot the rules framed under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution, governing the\n\nprocess of selection and conditions of service to the post on which he was\n\nemployed.\n\n98. In the instant case before us, it is not so. Both the sides are ad-\n\nidem on the point that the process of selection of the applicant was\n\nconducted as per the RRs of the year 2001 as applicable for the post\n\nconcerned, and that it was not as if she had been randomly picked up for\n\nappointment only for a limited period. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt had in the above cited judgment \"U.P.S.C. vs. Girish Jayantilal\n\nBaghela (supra) laid down the tests which distinguish a purely\n\ncontractual employment from a regular and substantive employment. It\n\nwas found by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the respondent in that\n\ncase did not have any right to continue as Drugs Inspector after expiry of\n\nthe six months' period, for which alone he had been initially appointed.\n\nHis contractual appointment for the six months' period was de hors all\n\nthe Rules, and, in particular, the RRs for the posts of Drug Inspectors\n\nhad not been followed in making his selection for that six months'\n\ncontractual appointment period. It was, therefore, held by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court that his appointment was not made in a manner which\n\ncould even remotely be said to have complied with the requirements as\n\nlaid down under \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution. Therefore, his\n\nappointment being purely contractual, it was held that the stage of his\n\nacquiring the status of a Government servant had never arrived.\n\n 66\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n99. When we apply those tests to the instant case, it is seen that the\n\nactual Gazette Notification, issued in the name of the President, through\n\nAnnexure A-11 dated 08.12.2003, which was published in the Gazette of\n\nIndia Part-1 \nSection-2\n, had in every manner conferred upon the\n\napplicant the status of the holder of a Gezetted civil post, and that\n\nNotification had been issued without any reference to the \"agreement\"\n\n(not a \"contract\"), which the respondents had made her sign on\n\n03.10.2003, as per Annexure A-10 of the OA. In fact both Annexures A-\n\n10 and A-14 have been titled as \"Agreement\", & have not at all\n\nmentioned to be in the nature of a \"Contract\". Therefore, it is clear that\n\nin the instant case the applicant had acquired the status of a Gazetted\n\nGovernment servant from day one, i.e., 03.10.2003, the day she joined\n\nthe R-1-NSCS as a Deputy Secretary. All the arguments of the R-1-NSCS\n\nto the contrary, which had been adopted in toto by the private\n\nrespondents R-2 to R-5 also are, therefore, rejected as being without any\n\nlegal basis whatsoever.\n\n100. Enumerating the concomitants of a contract in the case of UPSC\n\nvs. Girish Jayantilal Baghela (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had\n\nnoticed that:-\n\n i) While working as a contractual employee, the respondent was\n not governed by the relevant Service Rules;\n\n ii) That the respondent did not enjoy even the privilege of\n availing casual or earned leave.\n\n iii) That the respondent was not entitled to avail the benefit of\n General Provident Fund\n\n 67\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n iv) Nor was the respondent entitled to any pension (which are\n normal incidents of a Government service).\n\n v) It was also noticed by the Supreme Court that the respondent\n could neither be placed under suspension, entitling him to a\n subsistence allowance,\n\n vi) Nor could the respondent be transferred anywhere in India.\n\n vii) It was further notified that some of the minor penalties, which\n can be inflicted on a Government servant, while they continue\n to be in Government service could also not be imposed upon,\n the respondent of that case; and\n\n viii) Lastly, he was not entitled to any protection under \nArticle 311\n\n of the Constitution.\n\n101. Testing the present applicant's case on the touchstone of\n\nthese eight concomitants of a purely contractual appointment, bereft of\n\nany status as a Government servant, the case of the present applicant\n\ncertainly cannot be held to be that of having been only a contractual\n\nemployee of the respondent No.1 NSCS, because of the very nature of the\n\nprocess of her appointment, and her acquiring the status of holder of a\n\nGazetted civil post, which was duly Gazette notified through the Gazette\n\nNotification 08.12.2003 (Annexure A-11), which itself was sufficient to\n\nbring her case totally beyond the status of \"a purely contractual\n\nemployee\", as was the case in the case of UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal\n\nBaghela (supra), and more particularly so because the Gazette\n\nNotification nowhere mentioned her employment to have been made on\n\ncontractual basis.\n\n102. It is also clear that she had been recruited through the due process\n\nas prescribed under the RRs 2001, that she was not randomly picked up\n\nfrom the streets, that she was considered to be already holding an\n\nanalogous post in IDSA, that she was subject to all the Service Rules &\n\n 68\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nRegulations, as well as entitled to all protections under \nArticle 309\n to 313\n\nof the Constitution, that she was entitled to take Casual Leave as well as\n\nleave of all other kinds as applicable to the Central Govt. employees; that\n\nshe could have been placed under suspension, and would then have been\n\nentitled to Subsistence Allowance; that she could have been transferred\n\nor deputed on duty, or on tour anywhere in India, and any disciplinary\n\naction could have been taken against her.\n\n103. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has in the case of \nSatish\n\nChandra Anand vs. Union of India\n, AIR 1953 SC 250 held that State\n\ncan enter into contracts of temporary employment and impose special\n\nterms in each case, provided they are not inconsistent with the\n\nConstitution, and those who chose to accept those terms and enter into\n\nthe contract are bound by them, even as the State is bound. Here, in the\n\ninstant case, there was no \"Contract\" as such, but only an \"Agreement\"\n\nbinding down the applicant to all Service Rules & Regulations etc., none\n\nof which were inconsistent with the Constitution. Therefore, in turn, the\n\nState, being the Govt. of India here, was also bound by the status\n\nconferred upon the applicant by them after such appointment.\n\n104. \nIn the case of Manager, M/s. \nPyarchand Kesarimal Porwal Bidi\n\nFactory vs. Onkar Laxman Thenge\n, 1969 (2) SCR 272: AIR 1970 SC\n\n823, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that a subsisting contract of\n\nservice with one master is a bar to service with any other master unless\n\nthe contract otherwise provides, or the master consents. A contract of\n\nemployment involving personal service is incapable of transfer.\n\n 69\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nTherefore, after the R-1 NSCS had secured its relationship of being the\n\napplicant's Master by asking her to come and join her services with them\n\nafter serving her earlier Employer-Employee relationship with the IDSA, it\n\ncannot now be allowed to shirk from its responsibilities after having\n\nstepped into the shoes of being the applicant's Master, and deny any\n\nEmployer-Employee relationship, which is much different than that in\n\nthe case of purely contractual employees.\n\n105. The position of civil service and civil servants is different in U.K.\n\nLaw and the Indian Law. Regarding the U.K. Law of Crown Service, in\n\nthe Commentary on Administrative Law by the Late Sir William Wade as\n\nper the 11th Edition, 2014, Edited by H.W.R. Wade & C.E.F. Forsyth, the\n\nfollowing legal position prevailing in U.K. may be mentioned:\n\n \"The Law of Crown Service\n\n Nature of Crown Service\n\n Crown service is one of the most curious departments of public\n law. In most other democratic countries the position and rights\n of state employees from an important branch of administrative\n law, and the tenure of posts in the civil service gives rise to many\n questions for the courts, whether they be ordinary courts of law\n or special administrative courts. In England the position is\n different. The civil service despite its great size and importance,\n is largely staffed and regulated under arrangements which are\n legally anomalous. It has generally been held that at common law\n civil servants of the Crown, and military servants also, have no\n legal right to their salaries and no legal protection against\n wrongful dismissal. Although recently the picture has changed\n substantially, the law has long regarded the civil service as if it\n still consisted of a handful of secretaries working behind the\n scenes in a royal palace. Although it has lost its domestic\n character in every other respect, it is still in a primitive state of\n legal evolution.\n\n Another paradox is that in practice the situation is just the\n opposite of what these legal rules would suggest. Crown service,\n though legally the most precarious employment, is in reality the\n most secure. This is merely convention, but in the civil service\n\n 70\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthe convention is deeply ingrained, so that there are probably\nbetter grounds for complaining that civil servants are excessively\nprotected than for criticising their defencelessness in law. Even\nwhen a public inquiry reveals serious failings in the conduct of\ncivil servants, they are rarely dismissed.\n\nCrown servants of all ranks are in law the servants of the Crown\nand not of one another. A civil servant therefore has no\ncontractual rights against his department, his minister or any\nsuperior officer. Whoever engages him acts merely as the Crown's\nagent, and his contract of employment is directly between\nhimself (as servant) and the Crown. Any remedy must therefore\nbe sought against the Crown alone.\n\nTenure: No Protection at Common Law\n\nThe best-known decision on the legal insecurity of civil service\ntenure concerned the dismissal of a consular agent in Nigeria. He\nhad been engaged for a term (as he said) of three years certain,\nbut was prematurely dismissed. He sued the Crown by petition of\nright, but the Court of Appeal refused him relief, holding that it is\nnot competent for the Crown to tie its hands by such a contract\n(with a civil servant).\n\nThe basis of the rule that Crown servants are dismissible at\npleasure, therefore, is the principle that the public interest\nrequires that the government should be able to disembarrass\nitself of any employee at any moment. All the emphasis was on\npublic policy. There was no suggestion that the rule had any\nconnection with the royal prerogative.\n\nThe rules so laid down was followed in later decisions. Yet the\nreasons put forward for this policy will not really bear\nexamination. Any employer can always dismiss a servant: the\nonly question is whether, if he does so, he should pay\ndamages for breach of contract. No master can be compelled\nto employ a servant, any more than a servant can be\ncompelled to serve a master. The argument that the Crown\ncould not otherwise relieve the public of an undesirable servant\ntherefore falls to the ground., It may be said that the Crown\nshould not be put in the dilemma of ignoring the public interest\nor else committing a breach of contract-for a breach of contract,\ndespite Mr. Justice Holmes's famous theory to the contract, is a\nwrongful act. But to that it can be answered that it is of even\ngreater importance that engagements expressly entered into\nshould at least be honoured in the breach, if not in the\nobservance. The Crown should be an honest man, and if\ndriven to break its contract ought to pay damages, as it does for\nbreach of other contracts. Yet the latest decision has confirmed\nthat civil servants can be dismissed at will.......................\".\n\n 71\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n106. But, further, while discussing the common law on powers of the\n\nCrown, the learned Author (and Editors) had opined as follows:\n\n \"Common Law Powers of the Crown\n\n As adumbrated, the Crown as a corporation sole has all the\n powers of a natural person and may enter into contracts and\n own and convey land and do all the many other things its\n subjects may do (as just explained, these are sometimes\n inaccurately called 'prerogative powers'). These are considerable\n powers in many circumstances and they are generally exercised\n by ministers on behalf of the Crown. Ministers are, of course,\n responsible to parliament for their exercise and that exercise is\n subject, when appropriate, to judicial review. Moreover,\n elementarily, such common law powers cannot be exercised\n inconsistently with a statute. Equally elementarily, the\n exercise of these powers is 'circumscribed by public law'. Some\n consider that it is 'illegitimate' for any exercise of power by\n ministers not to rest on parliamentary authority, but the\n common law powers of the Crown have existed for centuries and\n have been upheld times in recent years.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n107. However, at the same time, while discussing the realms beyond the\n\nlaw, the learned Authors opined as follows:\n\n \"Consensual submission' may not necessarily mean the\n acceptance of specific contractual obligations, as opposed to\n voluntary participation or activity. Contractual obligations\n belong to private law, so that where the only rights asserted\n are covered by such obligations, judicial review will be\n refused. For this reason many commercial, social and sporting\n associations will lie outside the field of public law.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n108. Thus, while discussing the liability of the Crown in U.K. in the case\n\nof Contracts, the learned Authors opined that the Crown is free to make\n\n 72\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\ncontracts without statutory authority since it enjoys the power of a\n\nnatural person, they further opined that contracts of service with public\n\nauthorities rest on the same 'ordinary law' basis as other contracts,\n\nexcept in the case of the Crown. However, the position is entirely\n\ndifferent in the case of India. Under the Indian Constitution, the\n\nPresident, or the Governors of the States, are free to act and enter into\n\ncontracts which are not in consonance with Part XIV of the Constitution,\n\nrelating to Services under the Union and the State, consisting of \nArticles\n\n309\n and \n311\n of the Constitution. Further, regulation of recruitment and\n\nprescribing conditions of service of persons appointed to public service\n\nand civil posts in connection with the affairs for the Union, or of any of\n\nthe State, has to be done only under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution, in\n\naccordance with the Rules made under the Authority of that Article & its\n\nProviso, regulating such recruitment, and conditions of service of\n\npersons appointed to such services and posts, subject to the protection\n\nmade available to the persons so employed in civil capacities, either\n\nunder the Union, or under a State, under \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution,\n\neven though \nArticle 310\n lays down that except as expressly provided by\n\nthe Constitution, every person who is a member of a defence service or of\n\na civil service of the Union etc., or holder of any civil post etc., holds\n\noffice during the pleasure of the President, or the pleasure of the\n\nGovernor of the State, as the case may be. But, such pleasure of the\n\nPresident, or of the Governor, would still be bound by the Rules made\n\nunder \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution regarding dismissal, removal or\n\nreduction in rank of such persons.\n\n 73\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n109. Under \nArticle 309\n, read with the proviso below \nArticle 320 (3)\n\nconcerning the functions of the Public Service Commission, while it is\n\npossible to prescribe that in respect of some posts and service\n\nregulations may be made either generally, or in any particular class of\n\ncase, or in any particular circumstances, that it shall not be necessary\n\nfor the appropriate Public Service Commission to be consulted regarding\n\nmatters relating to the method of recruitment to a particular Civil\n\nService, or for a particular category of civil posts concerned, however,\n\nthis does not absolve the Executive from the rigours of \nArticles 309\n and\n\n311\n of the Constitution, and the protection available to the holders of\n\ncivil posts under \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution of India. In the instant\n\ncase it is clear that IDSA also fell under the definition of the State for the\n\npurposes of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution, and that R-1 NSCS certainly is\n\ncovered under that Article. Therefore, R-1 NSCS cannot be absolved\n\nfrom the rigours of \nArticle 311\n, even in spite of the exemption granted to\n\nit under \nArticle 320 (3).\n\n110. Therefore, it is clear that in the instant case, the respondents have\n\non the one hand appointed the applicant to be a holder of a civil post,\n\nand even issued a Gazette notification to that effect, as such declaring\n\nher to be the holder of that civil post, but, on the other hand, they have\n\nalso taken recourse to forcing her to sign an \"Agreement\" of service,\n\ncontaining a number of conditions, as already discussed above, but\n\nwhich conditions also only work towards more closely defining the\n\ncharacter of her employment to be that of a holder of a civil post, because\n\nof those conditions having borrowed and brought into effect the\n\n 74\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\napplicability of CCS (Conduct) Rules, CCS (CCA) Rules, and other\n\nparallel Service rules concerning the Central Civil Services of the Union\n\nof India to the applicant's appointment with them. Therefore, we have no\n\nhesitation in holding that the \"Agreement\", which has been termed by\n\nR-1 NSCS to have been a \"Contract\", was only a charade or a facade,\n\ndesigned more to try to hide the true nature of the applicant's\n\nemployment with R-1-NSCS.\n\n111. In fact, the fact that the so-called \"contract\" \"Agreement\" dated\n\n03.10.2003, entered into between the applicant and the President of\n\nIndia, was a sham, and non-est in the eyes of law, is further signified by\n\nthe fact that both the witnesses who had signed as witnesses for the\n\napplicant, and as witnesses for the signature of Dr. S.D. Pradhan, Joint\n\nSecretary to the Govt. of India in NSCS, were the same, and both were\n\nemployees of R-1 NSCS. This agreement having been attested to twice by\n\nthe same witnesses, both for the applicant, as well as for the Joint\n\nSecretary signing on behalf of the President of India, who had signed\n\ntwice for having been witnesses for both sides, is totally unacceptable in\n\nlaw. The \"Agreement\" having been signed by the same witnesses from\n\nboth the sides flies in the face of the law relating to the Law of Contract,\n\nand the law relating to Law of Evidence in relation to contracts.\n\n112. Though in the context of different Acts, like the Transfer of Property\n\nAct, the Registration Act and the Indian Evidence Act, it has been held by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court that the attestation required as a proof of\n\n 75\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nexecution of document is required by law to be attested under \nSection 68\n\nof the Indian Evidence Act, and its importance is such that the object of\n\nsuch attestation is to protect the executant from being required to\n\nexecute a document by the other party thereto by force, fraud or undue\n\ninfluence. It has been further held that such attestation is meant to\n\nensure that the executant of the agreement was a free agent, and not\n\nunder pressure, or subject to fraud, while executing the document\n\nconcerned.\n\n113. It has been further held that the object of placing more attestation\n\nthan one upon a document, whether at the parties' voluntary instance,\n\nor by requirement of law, is ordinarily not for the purpose to demand the\n\ncombined testimony of all of them at the trial, but merely to provide by\n\nway of caution a number of witnesses, so that the main object of various\n\nStatutes, requiring the attestation to be such that an element of validity\n\nhas to surround the act of execution, is achieved, with certain\n\nsafeguards.\n\n114. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in the case of \nM.L. Abdul\n\nJabbar Sahib v. H. Venkata Sastri and Sons and others\n etc. [AIR\n\n1969 SC 1147] that the act of attestation must be done by a witness\n\nanimo attestandi, i.e., \"with the intention to attest\", who should not only\n\nbe present at the time for affixing their signatures on the document while\n\nit was being executed, but that the attesting witness must see that the\n\nexecutants actually signed of freewill, and it must also be shown that the\n\nattestor had signed the documents in the presence of the executants. In\n\n 76\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthe instant case, the manner in which two witnesses had signed as\n\nhaving been witnesses to the signatures on the \"Agreement\" of both the\n\napplicant, and of the Joint Secretary of NSCS signing on behalf of the\n\nPresident of India, it cannot be elicited and held that the Agreement was\n\nindeed signed by the applicant free from any undue influence, or out of\n\nthe free will of the applicant before us.\n\n115. That is why, the law requires more than one attestation of\n\nwitnesses from either side, and at least one attesting witness from each\n\nside who is capable of giving evidence of the signature having been\n\naffixed out of free will, which is a necessary concomitant for the\n\nexecution of a valid contract \"Agreement\" to ensure that the executant\n\nwas a free agent, and was not under any pressure of any kind while\n\nexecuting the document. The execution of an \"Agreement\" means not\n\nonly signing of the Agreement by a person on the document, but also the\n\nattestation of his signature having been made out of free will, by\n\nattesting witnesses, where it requires such attestation. It is, therefore,\n\nclear from the facts of the instant case that after the applicant had joined\n\nservice with the respondent No.1-NSCS on 03.10.2003, she was perforce\n\nmade to sign the \"Agreement\" as at Annexure A-10, even though that\n\n\"Agreement\" is of no consequence when tested on the touch-stone of\n\nthe requirements of a valid \"Contract\".\n\n116. Similarly, the \"Agreement\" made on 29.09.2006 (Annexure A-14)\n\nat the time of applicant's promotion to the post of Director was also\n\nsigned by the applicant and one Shri Rohit Khera, Joint Secretary on\n\n 77\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nbehalf of the President, who is incidentally private respondent R-4 of this\n\nO.A., and both signatures were again witnessed by the same set of two\n\nwitnesses, both of whom were Directors working under the Joint\n\nSecretary, who was the executant on behalf of the President of India.\n\nTherefore, had this been a civil case, none of these two \"Agreements\"\n\nAnnexure A-10 dated 03.10.2003 and Annexure A-14 dated 29.09.2006\n\nwould have stood the scrutiny of being as per the Law of Contracts, and\n\nLaw of Evidence. Therefore, insofar as the nature of the applicant's\n\nappointment with the respondents is concerned, it is clear that from day\n\none, i.e., 03.10.2003, she was a holder of a civil post in R-1 NSCS, which\n\nwas properly Gazette notified also, and when she was promoted as\n\nDirector again, she continued to be a holder of a civil post, which\n\npromotional appointment of hers was also properly Gazette notified, and\n\nthe respondent R-1 NSCS cannot be allowed to hide behind the sham\n\n\"Agreements\" at Annexures A-10 and A-14, to try to pass off her\n\nemployment with them as having been contractual employment, when\n\nthe employment had all the trappings of a substantive appointment, or\n\nappointment to a Gazetted civil post of appropriate stature.\n\n117. The respondent R-1 NSCS has desperately tried to make out a case\n\nas if her appointment was only a contractual employment, and was not a\n\nsubstantive employment. But it is seen that she was even placed on\n\nprobation in her employment to the civil post under the Union of India,\n\nwhich employment can only be in three manners, viz. (i) permanent\n\nemployment, subject to a period of probation, followed by confirmation as\n\nprobationer, and thereafter the appointee acquiring a substantive lien, (ii)\n\n 78\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nappointment in a temporary service, under the Central Civil Services\n\n(Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, or, (iii) appointments \"purely on\n\ncontractual basis\", without any trappings whatsoever of the appointee\n\nbeing a Government servant, which contractual employees never get to\n\nbecome the holders of a civil post.\n\n118. As we have pointed out above, even though the Gazette Notification\n\ndated 08.12.2003 had mentioned that the President had appointed the\n\napplicant as Deputy Secretary with R-1-NSCS on contract basis for a\n\nperiod of two years, or until further orders, whichever is earlier, but\n\nthrough the Agreement executed on 03.10.2003, all the trappings of her\n\nbeing the holder of a civil post were attached to her employment. It is\n\nalso not the case of the respondent R-1 NSCS that she was appointed\n\nunder the CCS (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965.\n\n119. It may be pertinent to mention here that removal from service of a\n\ntemporary government servant, who is not in quasi permanent service, is\n\neasy, as it is liable to termination at any time, by notice being given in\n\nwriting (by the Government servant to the Appointing Authority, or by\n\nthe Appointing Authority to the Government servant), the period of such\n\nnotice being one month, as per Rule-5 (1)(b) of CCS (Temporary Service)\n\nRules, 1965. The concomitants of Temporary Service appointments\n\nunder fixed period temporary service made under proviso to Rule 5(1)(b)\n\nof the Rules vis-a-vis substantive appointments were examined by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in \nUnion of India and others v. Arun Kumar\n\nRoy\n (1986) 1 SCC 675, and it was held that when once Service Rules\n\nhave been framed under \nArticle 309\n, the Rules so framed govern the\n\n 79\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nservice after appointment, and that they override the term of any\n\ncontract, which is not in consonance with the said Rules. It was further\n\nheld that any Subordinate Legislation by way of Notification, clarifying\n\nthe operation of Statutory Rules, cannot override the Statutory Rules\n\nthemselves.\n \nThe said Rule-5 of the CCS (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965\n\nwas first interpreted by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nSenior\n\nSuperintendent, R. M. S., Cochin V. K. V. Gopinath\n (AIR 1972 SC\n\n1487=(1972) 3 SCR 530.\n \nHowever, that judgment was declared not to\n\nbe a good law through the Supreme Court's subsequent judgment in the\n\ncase of \nRaj Kumar vs. Union of India\n, [1975] 3 S.C.R. 963=AIR 1975\n\nSC 1116.\n \nAfter taking notice of these two judgments in \nUnion of India\n\nand others v. Arun Kumar Roy\n (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had\n\nheld as follows:-\n\n \"17. The question whether the terms embodied in the Order of\n appointment should govern the service conditions of\n employees in. Government service or the rules governing them\n is not an open question now. It is now well settled that a\n Government servant whose appointment though originates\n in a contract, acquires a status and thereafter is governed\n by his service rules and not by the terms of contract. The\n powers of the Government under \nArt. 309\n to make rules,\n to regulate the service conditions of its employees are\n very wide and unfettered. These powers can be exercised\n unilaterally without the consent of the employees concerned. It\n will, therefore, be idle to contend that in the case of employees\n under the Government, the terms of the contract of\n appointment should prevail over the rules governing their\n service conditions. The origin of Government service often\n times is contractual. There is always an offer and\n acceptance, thus bringing it to being a completed contract\n between the Government and its employees. \nOnce\n appointed, a Government servant acquires a status and\n thereafter his position is not one governed by the contract\n of appointment. Public law governing service conditions\n steps in to regulate the relationship between the employer\n and employee. His emoluments and other service\n conditions are thereafter regulated by the appropriate\n statutory authority empowered to do so. Such regulation\n is permissible in law unilaterally without reciprocal\n\n 80\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n consent. This Court made this clear in two Judgments\n rendered by two Constitution Benches for this Court in\n \nRoshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India\n, (1968) 1 SCR 185 : (AIR\n 1967 SC 1889) and in \nState of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki\n Nath Khosa\n, (1974) 1 SCR 771 : (AIR 1974 SC 1).\n\n 18. Thus it is clear and not open to doubt that the terms\n and conditions of the service of an employee under the\n Government who enters service on a contract, will, once\n he is appointed, be governed by the rules governing his\n service conditions. It will not be permissible thereafter for\n him to rely upon the terms of contract which are not in\n consonance with the rules governing the service.\n\n 19. The powers of the Government under Article. 309 of\n the Constitution to make rules regulating the service\n conditions of the government employees cannot, in any\n manner, be fettered by any agreement. The respondent\n cannot therefore, succeed either on the terms of the contract\n or on the notification on which the High Court has relied upon.\n Nor can he press into service the rule of estoppel against the\n Government.\n\n 20. Now, we may usefully advert to clause. (v) of para 2 of the\n Order of appointment. This clause reads as follows :\n\n \"Other conditions of service will be governed by the relevant\n rules and orders in force from time to time.\"\n\n 21. This clause was inserted by way of abundant caution\n making it clear that the conditions of service will be regulated\n by the rules, obtaining from time to time regarding the service\n in question.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n120. As was held in Paragraphs 18 & 19 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's\n\njudgment in the case of \nUnion of India and others v. Arun Kumar Roy\n\n(supra), even in the case of an employee under the Government, who\n\nenters service on a contract, the terms and conditions of service of the\n\nemployee will, once he was so appointed, be governed by the rules\n\ngoverning his service conditions, and it will not be permissible thereafter\n\n(either for him, or for the Government) to go back to and rely upon the\n\nterms of the contract, which are not in consonance with the rules\n\n 81\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\ngoverning the service, since the powers of the Government under \nArticle\n\n309\n of the Constitution to make Rules regulating the service conditions of\n\nthe Government employee cannot in any manner be fettered by any\n\nagreement. Here, in the instant case, it is the other way round. After\n\nhaving bound the applicant with all the fetters of the Service Rules and\n\nRegulations from the day 1, i.e., 03.10.2003, it is the Govt. of India which\n\nis trying to go back and to try to turn the clock back, to the detriment of\n\nthe applicant's accrued rights.\n\n121. In Para-12 of their counter reply, respondent No.R-1 NSCS has\n\nsubmitted two things, firstly that the RRs 2001 prevalent in 2006 did not\n\nhave any provision for promotion, and secondly that as per the\n\nGuidelines for recruitment of officers in NSCS, absorption can be done\n\nonly \"in rare cases\", and after completion of a minimum tenure of 5\n\nyears in an outstanding manner. We find both these submissions to be\n\nentirely against the well settled and laid down principles of\n\nAdministrative Law. When once the 2001 RRs had been prescribed by\n\nthe respondents (through Annexure A-12 dated 16.02.2001), that was in\n\nthe nature of a Subordinate Legislation. Thereafter the respondents\n\ncannot have, and cannot take recourse to, any purported Guidelines,\n\nwhich have neither been brought on record by them, nor could have been\n\nissued in supersession of the Subordinate Legislation issued through the\n\nGeneral Statutory Regulation No.97 dated 16.02.2001. After the RRs\n\n2001 had been framed and notified, keeping of any element of discretion\n\nin their drawers in the form of any Secret and undisclosed Guidelines is\n\n 82\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nboth illegal, as well as totally abhorrent to all tenets of law. RRs could\n\nhave been, however, amended, which was actually done in 2007.\n\n122. The submission of the respondents that the RRs did not have any\n\nprovision for promotion is also not acceptable, as the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt has repeatedly held that consideration for promotion is a\n\nfundamental right of any holder of a civil post, if a promotional post\n\nexists, and the R-1 NSCS has failed to deny that the promotional post of\n\nJoint Secretary does exist.\n\n123. The contention of the respondents that absorption can only be done\n\n\"in rare cases\" is also completely unacceptable. This smacks of an\n\nelement of discretion, without following any prescribed Rules or\n\nRegulations, or the prescription of any cut-off or qualifying criteria like\n\n'Very Good' in CRs of so many years out of so many years, or\n\n'Outstanding' in CRs of so many years out of so many years. It is trite\n\nlaw that administrative discretion is abhorrent to the Rule of Law, and\n\nthe R-1 NSCS cannot be allowed to plead that without prescribing any\n\nqualifying standards as per Rules, they can have and keep an\n\nadministrative discretion in their pockets, to take a decision to absorb\n\ncertain persons, \"in rare cases\", and not to absorb all others, even if\n\nthey are also holders of civil posts, and had performed well, when no\n\nsuch benchmark for performance has been prescribed under the Rules\n\nfor determination of those \"rare cases\". Stating that absorption could\n\nhave been done \"in rare cases\" further discloses the propensity on the\n\npart of R-1 NSCS to take recourse to a discretion de hors the RRs, which\n\n 83\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nin itself is a blasphemy. As was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nE.P. Royappa vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n: AIR 1974 SC 555, equality and\n\nequality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule\n\nof law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an\n\nabsolute monarch, and that the principle of equality enshrined in\n\nArticle 14\n must guide every state action, whether it be legislative,\n\nexecutive, or quasi-judicial (\nMeneka Gandhi vs. Union of India\n:\n\n(\n1978) 1 SCC 248,) and Ajay Hasia vs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi and\n\nOthers\n (1981) 1 SCC 722.\n\n124. It has been further submitted in the counter reply of R-1 NSCS that\n\nrespondents have the sole discretion to decide regarding the cases for\n\nabsorption, which also cannot be the case, because the term\n\n\"absorption\" is only used in the cases of deputationists, or persons\n\nholding their lien in another organization, and who have moved to the\n\nborrowing organization, where they are sought to be so \"absorbed\".\n\n\"Absorption\" can also be used in the case of contractual employees, and\n\nTemporary Service employees. But then, as we have discussed above, the\n\nappointment of the applicant with R-1 NSCS w.e.f. 03.10.2003 was\n\nneither \"purely contractual\", nor was it under the CCS (Temporary\n\nService) Rules, 1965, and that it already had all the trappings of a\n\nsubstantive employment (with even a period of Probation having been\n\nenvisaged). Therefore, at least in the case of the present applicant, the\n\nvery term \"absorption\" had lost its meaning altogether, when she was\n\nalready substantively employed after her selection in a proper manner, as\n\nper the RRs and she was holding her post in her own right.\n\n 84\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n125. The meaning of the word 'absorption' had been discussed in the\n\ncase of \nDev Dutta vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n [(1991) Supp2 SCC\n\n553] in Paragraph-8 of the judgment as follows:-\n\n \"8. Now coming to the question of seniority, the term \"absorbed\"\n\n in Service Jurisprudence with reference to a post in the very\n nature of things implies that an employee who has not been\n holding a particular post in his own right by virtue of either\n recruitment or promotion to that post but is holding a\n different post in a different department is brought to that\n post either on deputation or by transfer and is subsequently\n absorbed in that post whereafter he becomes a holder of that\n post in his own right and loses his lien on his parent post. No\n one asserts that the instant one was a case of the absorbed Sales\n Tax Inspectors being initially sent on deputation from the post of\n Block Level Extension Officer to the post of Sales Tax Inspector\n and being subsequently absorbed in that post. Consequently,\n when as pointed out by the High court, it was not disputed that\n the surplus Block Level Extension Officers had been absorbed in\n the post of Sales Tax Inspectors it is obvious that it was a case of\n absorption by transfer. \nIn this connection it would be useful to\n recapitulate that the minutes of the meeting \nreferred to above\n held\n on 30/09/1965 laying down the principles of procedure for\n absorbing the surplus personnel specifically stated that the\n surplus staff which was to be \"absorbed\" \"should be treated as\n having been transferred from one post to another so that\n there may be no break in their service\".\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n126. In fact it is true that the vagueness in the 2001 RRs of the R-1\n\nNSCS had been very clearly pointed out by the DoP&T itself in its Noting\n\ndated 21.03.2014, produced by the respondent themselves at Annexure\n\nR-12. The R-1 NSCS has also falsely stated that there was no provision\n\nfor promotion in the RRs, since it was not clearly spelt out in the 2001\n\nRRs, but as per the RRs of 2007, produced by them as Annexure R-11,\n\npromotion is certainly one of the methods for appointment of the Joint\n\nSecretaries, of the Directors and of the Deputy Secretaries, as per the\n\nRRs Gazette notified on 22.12.2007. Therefore, the total absence of any\n\npossibility of promotions under 2001 RRs cannot be appreciated, when\n\n 85\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nthe clarity has not come even after 2007 RRs. The DoP&T Noting dated\n\n21.03.2014, submitted by the respondents at Annexure R-12, had stated\n\nas follows:-\n\n \"8. In the present case, it seems that the eligibility\n requirement of total continuous service of 17 years is\n specified for the officer in PB 3 GP Rs.7600 for being\n considered for promotion to the post of JS in NSCS.\n Other eligibility criteria in respect of officers of NSCS having\n 2 years regular service in PB-4 GP Rs. 8900, or 3 years\n regular service in PB 4 GP Rs.8700 for being eligible to JS\n appear to be separate provisions. This interpretation is\n logical from the provisions prescribed for deputation of this\n post. It prescribes that the officers in PB 3 GP Rs.7600\n with total continuous Group A service of 17 years is\n eligible for being considered for appointment to the post\n by deputation/absorption. Due to vagueness of the\n provisions of the RRs, this interpretation needs to be\n clarified/validated in consultation with M/o Legal\n Affairs.\n\n 9. NSCS may accordingly decide the eligibility of the\n officer to the post of HS DoP&T may not have any further\n comments in the matter\".\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n127. When the respondents have themselves framed their RRs in a vague\n\nmanner, both in 2001 and in 2007, and not in accordance with the\n\nsettled principles of Administrative Law, they cannot be allowed to hide\n\nbehind the imperfections of those Rules to deny to the applicant her due.\n\n128. One further controversy unnecessarily raised by the R-1 NSCS has\n\nbeen in the context of their submission that the applicant was \"on loan\n\nbasis\" with them w.e.f. 16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002 from IDSA, and was\n\nnot \"on deputation\". In this context, the following definition of \"loan\"\n\nmay be reproduced from page 1039 of P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Law Lexicon,\n\n3rd Edition, 2012, Edited by Dr. Shakil Ahmad Khan. As was held in\n\n 86\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nNihal Singh vs. Ganesh Dass Ramgopal: AIR 1937 Oudh 124\";\n\n\"except with respect to money \"to loan\"implies that a thing is\n\ndelivered to another for use, without reward, and to be returned in\n\nspecie.\" But, in the instant case, during the relevant period of more than\n\ntwo years, the salary and other emoluments of the applicant were paid by\n\nR-1 NSCS only, and not by her the then employer IDSA, and, therefore, in\n\nterms of the above cited 1937 judgment, her services with R-1 NSCS\n\ncannot be termed to have been \"on loan basis\", but were certainly \"on\n\ndeputation basis\":-\n\n \"A lending; that which is lent; a permission to use; a bailment of\n an article for a certain time to be used by the borrower. Loan may\n include the lending of anything a horse, a carriage, a book, or any\n kind of goods, as well as money. To loan is to lend a thing to\n another, either gratuitously or for reward. In order to constitute a\n loan, there must be a thing loaned, a lender, and a borrower, as\n well as a contract between the parties. Where the relation between\n a depositor in a bank and his banker is that of debtor and\n creditor, simply, the transaction cannot in any proper sense be\n regarded as a loan, unless the money is left, not for safekeeping,\n but for a fixed period at interest, in which case the transaction\n assumes all the characteristics of a loan. \"Except with respect to\n money, 'to loan' implies that a thing is delivered to another for\n use, without reward, and to be returned in specie.\"\n\n129. The R-1 NSCS has also denied any continuity in service of the\n\napplicant from the IDSA to the R-1 NSCS organization. However, their\n\nclaim in this regard is false, totally hollow and unbelievable, in view of\n\nAnnexure A-26 LPC, which they have failed to deny or to controvert. The\n\nvery fact the R-1 organization later on felt the need to call for the Service\n\nBook of the applicant from the IDSA, and IDSA ultimately forwarded it to\n\nthem, and the official respondent R-1-NSCS have themselves produced\n\nphotocopies of certain pages from her Service Book at Annexure R-2,\n\n 87\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nclearly goes to show that R-1 NSCS was fully aware about the continuity\n\nof the applicant's service from IDSA to their organization. Even in their\n\nsur-rejoinder, R-1 NSCS has failed to deny the genuineness of Annexure\n\nA-26 dated 29.09.2003, which clearly shows that the applicant was to be\n\nrelieved from IDSA on 30.09.2003 only.\n\n130. Also, as has been recorded in the applicant's IDSA Service Book\n\nitself, she was deputed to R-1 NSCS for a period of two years w.e.f.\n\n16.08.2000, and she was to draw her pay and allowances from the R-1\n\nNSCS only during her deputation period, as per the order dated\n\n25.08.2000 passed by them. Deputation can only be of a substantive\n\nappointee, who retains a lien with the parent employer. If the contention\n\nof R-1 NSCS that the applicant was a purely contractual basis employee\n\nwith IDSA has to be accepted, then there could have been no deputation\n\nof the applicant from IDSA to R-1 NSCS, and no return of hers to IDSA to\n\nre-occupy her lien would have been possible. The very fact that it was\n\nfelt necessary to take her \"on loan\", or \"on deputation basis\",\n\nhowsoever, it may be called, from the IDSA to R-1 NSCS, and for IDSA to\n\nhave so lent her services to the R-1 NSCS, and to then have taken her\n\nback in their organization after completion of her more than two years'\n\ndeputation tenure with the R-1 NSCS, goes to show that her employment\n\nwith the IDSA also was not on \"purely contractual basis\" and that she\n\ndid hold a lien in IDSA.\n\n131. Even though the deputation may have been illegally called to be 'on\n\nloan basis', but her services on such deputation had been treated as\n\n 88\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nsubstantive services with R-1, and R-1 itself had, while considering her\n\ncase for promotional appointment to the post of Director, taken into\n\naccount that previous two years' deputation service of hers along with the\n\nthree years' service in the past of Deputy Secretary, for the purpose of\n\ncounting her 5 years' of qualifying service with NSCS for her promotion to\n\nthe post of Director, it proves that neither the applicant's appointment\n\nwith IDSA had been purely a contractual appointment, not her\n\ndeputation to R-1 NSCS had been so. If it was only a contract, the\n\ncontract should have been terminated with IDSA on 16.08.2000, and\n\nthen a fresh contract ought to have been entered into by her with the\n\nNSCS for the period of her deputation with R-1 NSCS w.e.f. 16.08.2000,\n\nwhich was neither done, nor contemplated, nor has been mentioned\n\nanywhere in the pleadings.\n\n132. Therefore, whatever may have been the nomenclature recorded in\n\nher Service Book behind her back, to which she had no access, the\n\nnature of her employment with IDSA was that of a substantive\n\nemployment, and her services were lent 'on loan or deputation basis' to\n\nR-1 w.e.f. 16.08.2000 and were then taken back by the IDSA when R-1\n\nNSCS sent her back after the end of her deputation period. As mentioned\n\nabove, when services are taken only on \"loan basis\", it is not necessary\n\nfor the obligation to pay the salary etc. during the period concerned has\n\nalso to be necessarily borne by the loanee organization, and cannot\n\ncontinue to be borne by the loaning organization. In the instant case, R-\n\n1 NSCS took on such a responsibility, and, therefore, very rightly so, they\n\nlater on treated that period of her deputation as substantial service.\n\n 89\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n133. The contention of the respondent R-1 NSCS that they cannot now\n\ncount her previous service in the IDSA for the purpose of considering her\n\ncase for Joint Secretary-ship, only because there had been a gap on\n\npaper of 01 month and 22 days in her appointment being terminated by\n\nthe IDSA, and her joining the respondents on 03.10.2003, cannot also be\n\naccepted, and is an absolutely false submission, because of the fact that\n\nthe respondent R-1 NSCS itself has failed to deny the contents of the\n\ndocuments dated 14.08.2003 & 10.09.2003 (Annexure A-8 colly)\n\nproduced by the applicant, in which the applicant had sought permission\n\nregarding the invitation received by her to attend the Conference on \"Post\n\nModern Terrorism\", and the IDSA Director's office had received that\n\nthrough Dy. No.2689 dated 14.08.2003, and then Director IDSA had\n\nsigned on it on 18.08.2003, and had reviewing the situation found that\n\nher deputation cannot be supported.\n\n134. Respondent No.R-1-NSCS has also failed to deny the genuineness\n\nof the applicant's request for leave dated 10.09.2003, by which she had\n\nrequested Director IDSA that she may be granted Earned Leave/Half Pay\n\nLeave w.e.f. 09.08.2003 to 30.09.2003, and in Para-3 of her request letter\n\ndated 10.09.2003, she had also stated that she was unable to attend the\n\noffice during the preceding period with regularity or for more than an\n\nhour, and that also will have to be considered as leave period in the\n\ninterests of discipline. That leave request had been received in the office\n\nof Director, IDSA, by Dy. No.2965 dated 18.09.2003, and the Director\n\nIDSA had approved the sanction of her Earned Leave/Half Pay Leave\n\n 90\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nw.e.f. 09.08.2003 to 30.09.2003, and had also mentioned that since she\n\nwas unable to attend office during the preceding period from 09.08.2003\n\nto 10.09.2003, that period also will have to be considered as leave period,\n\nand her sense of discipline had met with the approval and appreciation\n\nby the Director, which shows the integrity on behalf of the applicant.\n\nFurther, the respondent R-1-NSCS has also not been able to deny the\n\nAnnexure A-9 dated 30.09.2003, the applicant's relieving order issued by\n\nIDSA, which order was passed by IDSA on 30.09.2003, though it had\n\nbeen mentioned in it that she was relieved of her duties in that Institute\n\nw.e.f. 10.08.2003 (AN). But since this relieving order had not been\n\npassed and issued by IDSA on 10.08.2003, but had actually been passed\n\nand issued on 30.09.2003, it supports the applicant's contention that she\n\nwas in service with the IDSA till 30.09.2003, and that there had been no\n\ngap in her appointment with IDSA coming to an end in that date, and her\n\njoining with R-1-NSCS on the next very available working day on\n\n03.10.2003. As had been held in \nBadat & Co. v. East India Trading\n\nCo.\n: AIR 1964 SC 538, merely an evasive denial, without any specific\n\ncountering of the averments made and facts narrated, cannot be\n\naccepted, and such indirect admission itself being proof, no other proof is\n\nnecessary.\n\n135. It is also seen that the R-1-NSCS has themselves supported the\n\nsequence of events as narrated by the applicant in the OA by producing\n\nAnnexure R-6 of their counter reply, in which it is seen that sanction of\n\n46 days of E.L. for encashment as per the Rule vide Officer Order No.\n\n12A/2003 dated 03.12.2003 has been recorded earlier than the legend\n\n 91\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nrecorded below that, that the present applicant's resignation has been\n\naccepted, and she had been relieved from her duties in (the IDSA)\n\nInstitute w.e.f. 10.08.2003, vide Office Order No.9C/2003 dated\n\n29.09.2003. It is thus clear that the last entry regarding the Office Order\n\ndated 29.09.2003 issued by IDSA was recorded after the Office Order\n\nNo.12A/2003 issued by IDSA was passed on 03.12.2003, for leave\n\nencashment purposes, because the Service Book of the applicant had\n\nremained with the IDSA for quite a long time even after she had joined R-\n\n1-NSCS, and this entry regarding the antedating of the date of her being\n\nrelieved as entered in the Service Book had actually been made some\n\ntime after 02.12.2003, when her 46 days' Earned Leave encashment had\n\nalso been sanctioned by IDSA. Therefore, the entire story of R-1-NSCS of\n\nthere being a gap of 01 month and 22 days in the applicant's employment\n\nwith IDSA ending and her employment with the R-1 NSCS starting is\n\nentirely bogus, and unbelievable, and an utter falsehood. Further, it may\n\nbe added that even if such a break in service of 01 month and 22 days\n\nwas to be accepted to be true, still, after the R-1-NSCS having taken into\n\naccount her previous employment with IDSA as analogous service,\n\nmaking her eligible for appointment to the post of Deputy Secretary with\n\nR-1 NSCS w.e.f. 03.10.2003, the respondent R-1 NSCS cannot now turn\n\naround, and the benefit of such analogous service of hers of 17 years\n\ncannot now be denied to the applicant. In this context, in a slightly\n\nsimilar case of absorption of a deputationist Doctor, in a Coordinate\n\nBench's order dated 28.10.2016 (including one of us Member (A)) in OA\n\nNo.1699/2012 - Dr. Niruta Sharma v. Union of India, it has been held\n\nas follows:\n\n 92\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n \"22. We are also bound by the orders of the Full Bench,\nParagraphs 11 to 25 of which have been reproduced above. The\nFull Bench had held that the deputationists are given seniority\nand fixation of pay, taking into account the full period of\nequivalent service rendered by them in their earlier parent\nDepartment. Therefore, in so far as her seniority is concerned,\nthe present applicant is entitled to claim the seniority which had\naccrued to her by way of the equivalent service rendered by her\nwith the Himachal Pradesh Government, including the period of\nher deputation with the Respondent No.2 of this O.A. In this\ncontext, it is seen from the reply of the respondents in response\nto Para-4.9 of the OA that the respondents have, under the\nadvice received by them from DoPT, already fixed her seniority by\nprotecting that past service of hers, rendered by her in her earlier\nparent organization, including the period of deputation with\nRespondent No.2. Therefore, the ratio of the Full Bench\njudgment has been fully complied with by the respondents in her\ncase.\n\n23. The Full Bench had further held that in the matter of\npromotions, deputationists who get absorbed will be able to claim\nweightage on the basis of the seniority that is so carried forward\nby them. It is apparent from the reply of the respondents in\nresponse to Para 4.9 of the OA that they have already given due\nweightage to the applicant's seniority as carried/brought forward\nby her from her previous employment with Himachal Pradesh\nGovernment in the matter of fixation and seniority, in the\nSeniority List of the CHS cadre.\n\n24. However, though the stand of the respondents that such\nprotection of past service does not make the absorbed doctors\neligible for promotion to the next higher grade in CHS with\nretrospective effect, is also correct, the absorbed doctors in the\nGDMO Sub-Cadre of CHS need not be required to once again\ncomplete the prescribed qualifying service in the feeder grade of\nGDMO Sub-Cadre, into which they have been so absorbed, after\nthe date of such absorption, in addition to any other eligibility\nrequirement, since they have already worked on analogous post\nduring the period of their deputation service. The respondents\nare, therefore, not fully justified and right in making the\nsubmission that such qualifying service can count only from the\ndate of absorption of the absorbee Doctor into the GDMO Sub-\nCadre of CHS, and no weightage can be ascribed to their\nanalogous service in the past, during the period of their\ndeputation.\n\n25. While it is correct that the absorption in CHS is the\npoint of time on which there is a new start of service of the\napplicant in a new cadre of CHS, in the pay scale of the post\nconcerned, in which the absorbee Doctor's entitlements would\nstart counting afresh, because he/she has joined the CHS cadre\nonly from that date of absorption in substantive capacity, but her\npast service with the Himachal Pradesh Government, and her\nperiod of analogous service while on deputation with CHS, while\nretaining her lien with the Himachal Government, would not only\ncount for the purpose of seniority to be fixed, by protecting such\n\n 93\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n past service, but should also count towards the qualifying service\n for further promotions in CHS. However, she would not be\n entitled for any retrospective promotion.\n\n 26. xxx (Not reproduced here)\n\n 27. Therefore, while the claim of the applicant for fixation of\n her initial pay in CHS in the higher pay scale, as had been\n granted to her in her previous substantive employment with the\n Himachal Government, from the date of her absorption in CHS\n itself cannot be granted to her, more so when she had knowingly\n and willingly accepted her absorption under the CHS cadre only\n as a Senior Medical Officer w.e.f. 09.10.2003, in the pay scale of\n Rs.10,000-15200, in the interest of her remaining at Delhi,\n instead of reverting back to her earlier parent cadre in Himachal\n Pradesh, but the weightage of her having already rendered\n analogous service during the period of her deputation also would\n have to be provided to her, and, only if that period of analogous\n service falls short of the period prescribed for the consideration\n of her case for promotion, she would be required to render only\n such balance period of qualifying service after her absorption\n into CHS. If her analogous service experience while being on\n deputation with CHS has already exceeded the qualifying period,\n her eligibility for consideration of her case for promotion would\n start soon after such absorption.\n\n 28. Therefore, the OA is partially allowed, but there shall be\n no order as to costs.\n\n136. The respondent R-1-NSCS cannot also be allowed to hide behind\n\nthe fact that the relieving order of the IDSA does not mention the reason\n\nfor which the applicant had resigned from her service with that Institute,\n\nand does not mention anywhere that she had submitted her resignation\n\nand sought voluntarily to be relieved, just because her impending\n\nappointment with R-1 NSCS had not been mentioned by IDSA in its\n\norder. Such a mention was not at all necessary in that order passed by\n\nIDSA, because it was only an acceptance of her letter of voluntary\n\npremature resignation, and in that it neither was neither necessary for\n\nher to mention her future plans, nor was it necessary for the IDSA to\n\nindicate the reasons for their having accepted her request for such\n\npremature voluntary resignation.\n\n 94\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n137. Further, it was not as if the RRs dated 16.02.2001 notified through\n\nGSR 97, which have been produced before us through Annexures A-12 &\n\nA-27, had not been re-considered and amended in between. The GSR\n\n183 dated 16.04.2003 filed by the applicant as a part of Annexure A-27\n\ngoes to show that firstly the name of the R-1 Organization had been\n\nchanged to the National Security Council Secretariat, and secondly a\n\nSelection Committee, comprising of three Members each, had been\n\nintroduced in Column 13 for the RRs in respect of the posts of Joint\n\nSecretary, Scientist 'G\" and Major General, and against the posts of\n\nDirector and Deputy Secretary, in place of the earlier existing entries.\n\nSuch a Selection Committee, duly provided for in the RRs for the post\n\nconcerned, cannot be reduced only to be to select people for the purpose\n\nof contractual employment only, when the prescribed methods of\n\nrecruitment under Column-11 for the posts of Directors were\n\nDeputation/Contract/Absorption/Re-employment. It is, therefore, clear\n\nthat the Selection Committee in Column 13 of the RRs would apply to all\n\nthe four methods of selection provided for in Column 11 of the RRs.\n\n138. However, in respect of any such Selection Committee, the Apex\n\nCourt had in \nDr. Krushna Chandra Sahu and Others vs. State of\n\nOrissa and Others\n AIR 1996 SC 352=(1995) 6 SCC 1 decided the scope\n\nof powers of any such Selection Committee as follows, holding that such\n\npowers have to conform to the RRs, and, therefore, the Selection\n\nCommittee must set parameters for the four methods of Selection\n\nprovided for in Column 11 of the RRs:-\n\n 95\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n\"35. The members of the Selection Board or for that matter, any\nother Selection Committee, do not have the jurisdiction to lay\ndown the criteria for selection unless they are authorised\nspecifically in that regard by the Rules made under \nArt. 309.\n It is\nbasically the function of the rule making authority to provide the\nbasis for selection. This Court in \nState of Andhra Pradesh v. V.\nSadanandam\n, AIR 1989 SC 2060 observed as under (para 16, at\npp. 2065-66 of AIR):-\n\n\"We are now only left with the reasoning of the Tribunal that there\nis no justification for the continuance of the old Rule and for\npersonnel belonging to either zones being transferred on\npromotion to offices in other zones. In drawing such conclusion,\nthe Tribunal has travelled beyond the limits of its jurisdiction. We\nneed only point out that the mode of recruitment and the category\nfrom which the recruitment to a service should be made are all\nmatters which are exclusively within the domain of the executive.\nIt is not for judicial bodies to sit in judgment over the wisdom of\nthe executive in choosing the mode of recruitment or the\ncategories from which the recruitment should be made as they are\nmatters of policy decision falling exclusively within the purview of\nthe executive\".\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n36. The Selection Committee does not even have the inherent\njurisdiction to lay down the norms for selection nor can such\npower be assumed by necessary implication. \nIn \nRamachandra Iyer\nv. Union of India\n, (1984) 2 SCR 200 : (AIR 1984 SC 541), it was\nobserved (para 44, at p.562 of AIR):-\n\n\"By necessary inference, there was no such power in the ASRB to\nadd to the required qualifications. If, such power is claimed, it has\nto be explicit and cannot be read by necessary implication for the\nobvious reasons that such deviation from the rules is likely to\ncause irreparable and irreversible harm\".\n\n37. Similarly, in \nUmesh Chandra Shukla v. Union of India\n, 1985\nSuppl (2) SCR 367 : (AIR 1985 SC 1351), it was observed that the\nSelection Committee does not possess any inherent power to lay\ndown its own standards in addition to what is prescribed under\nthe Rules.\n \nBoth these decisions were followed in \nSh. Durgacharan\nMisra v. State of Orissa\n, (1987) 2 UJ (SC) 657 : (AIR 1987 SC\n2267) and the limitations of the Selection Committee were pointed\nout that it had no jurisdiction to prescribe the minimum marks\nwhich a candidate had to secure at the viva voce test.\n\n38. It may be pointed out that rule making function under \nArt.\n309\n is legislative and not executive as was \nlaid down by\n this Court\nin \nB.S. Yadav v. State of Haryana\n, AIR 1981 SC 561. For this\nreason also, the Selection Committee or the Selection Board\ncannot be held to have jurisdiction to lay down any standard or\nbasis for selection as it would amount to legislating a rule of\nselection.\"\n\n 96\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n139. The only issue that now remains now to be adjudicated is with\n\nregard to the determination of the seniority of the applicant vis-a-vis the\n\nother four private respondents. For deciding that, we may just follow and\n\nrely on the Hon'ble Apex Court judgment in the case of \nV. Sreenivasa\n\nReddy and Others vs. Govt. of A.P. and Others\n AIR 1995 SC 586,\n\nand in particular, paragraphs 15-20, which are reproduced below:-\n\n 15. It is settled law by the judgment of the Constitution\n Bench in Direct Recruits Class II Officers Association v.\n\n \nState of Maharashtra, (1990) 2 SCR 900 : (1991 AIR SCW\n 2226), that appointment in accordance with Rules is a\n condition precedent to count seniority. Temporary or ad hoc\n or fortuitous appointments etc. is not an appointment in\n accordance with the Rules and the temporary service cannot\n be counted towards the seniority. \nDelhi Water Supply and\n Sewage Disposal Committee v. R. K Kashyap\n, 1989 Supp (1)\n SCC 194 : (AIR 1989 SC 278); \nMasood Akhtar Khan v. State\n of M.P.\n, (1990) 4 SCC 24; \nD. N. Agrawal v. State of M.P.\n,\n (1990) 2 SCC 553 : (AIR 1990 SC 1311); \nState of Tamil Nadu\n v. E. Paripoornam\n, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 420 : (1992 AIR SCW\n 2057); \nR. C. Poudyal v. Union of India\n, (1993) 2 JT (SC) 1\n and at p. 25: (1993 AIR SCW 1620 at p. 1682); \nExcise\n Commissioner, Karnataka v. V. Sreekanta\n, 1993 Supp (3)\n SCC 53 : (1993 AIR SCW 1740).\n\n 16. \nIn \nK. C. Joshi v. Union of India\n, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 272\n : (AIR 1991 SC 284), the seniority is to be counted from the\n date on which appointment is made to the post in\n accordance with the rules. The previous temporary service\n should be considered to be fortuitous.\n \nIn \nUnion of India v. S.\n K. Sharma\n, (1992) 2 SCC 728 : (1992 AIR SCW 1150), this\n Court held that the approval of the UPSC for continuation in\n ad hoc post for the purpose of granting pay and allowances,\n would not amount to regular appointment and ad hoc\n services cannot be counted for determining seniority by the\n selection by PSC vide Vijay Kumar Jain v. State of Madhya\n Pradesh, 1992 Supp (2) SCC 95.\n \nIn \nK. C. Joshi\n's case (AIR\n 1991 SC 284), this Court held that employee would become\n a member of service only from the date of his appointment\n according to rules.\n \nIn \nA. M. Sehgal v. Raja Ram\n, 1992 Supp\n (1) SCC 304 : (1991 AIR SCW 1246), this Court held that\n where statutory rules link seniority with confirmation\n seniority cannot be fixed according to length of service and\n confirmation to a post borne on the cadre is a condition to\n get seniority.\n \nIn \nState of West Bengal v. Aghore Nath Dey\n,\n (1993) 3 SCC 371, it was held that ad hoc services followed\n\n 97\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nby regular service, the benefit of ad hoc service is not\nadmissible if the appointment was in violation of rules.\n \nIn \nD.\nN. Agrawal v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n, (1990)2 SCC 553 :\n\n(AIR 1990 SC 1311), it was held that seniority cannot relate\nback to the date of temporary appointment.\n\n17. Under Rule 10(a)(i)(1) where it is necessary in the public\ninterest to fill emergently a vacancy in the post borne on\nthe cadre of a service, class or category and if the filling of\nsuch vacancy in accordance with the rules is likely to result\nin undue delay, the appointing authority may appoint a\nperson temporarily otherwise than in accordance with the\nsaid rules. Under sub- rule (iv) of R. 10(2), such temporary\nappointee shall not be regarded as a probationer in such\nservice, class or category or be entitled by reason only of\nsuch appointment to any preferential claim to future\nappointments to such service, class or category. Rule 23(a)\nprovides the Procedure for commencement of the date of\nprobation of persons first appointed temporarily as under:-\n\n \"If a person having been appointed temporarily under\n sub-rule (a)(i)(1) or sub-rule (c) of R. 10, a post borne on\n the cadre of any service, class or category or having been\n appointed to any service, class or category, otherwise\n than in accordance with the Rules governing and\n appointed thereto is subsequently appointed to any\n service, class or category in accordance with the Rules, he\n shall commence his probation from the date of\n subsequent appointment or such earlier date as\n appointing authority may determine.\"\n\n The other clauses are not relevant for the purpose of this\n case, hence omitted.\n\n18. Rule 33 determines the seniority - (a) The seniority of a\nperson in a service, class or category or grade shall, unless\nhe has been reduced to a lower rank as a punishment, be\ndetermined by the date of his first appointment to such\nservice, class, category or grade. If any portion of the service\nof such person does not count towards probation under\nRules 10(a), (iv), 10(c), 16, 37(d), or 42(d), his seniority shall\nbe determined by the date of commencement of his service\nwhich counts towards probation.\n\n19. It is true that in Diwakar's case (AIR 1982 SC 1555) and\nin \nVenkata Reddy\n's case, this Court upheld the exercise of\nthe power by the Government under proviso to clause (3) of\n\nArt. 320\n of the Constitution and in \nVenkata Reddy\n's case\n(1993 AIR SCW 2750) held that the temporary employees\nare appointed in accordance with the rules. As stated\nearlier, those appointments came to be made during ban\nperiod and remained in service for long period. In this case,\nthere is no ban on recruitment and the appellants are\neligible to apply for and seek direct recruitment.\n \nIn\n\nParipoornam\n's case (1992 AIR SCW 2057), another Bench of\n\n 98\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n three Judges, considering the similar Madras Rules, held in\n paragraph 14, that temporary appointments made under R.\n 10(a)(i)(1) to fill in emergency vacancies were otherwise than\n in accordance with the Rules and the temporary service\n cannot be counted towards the seniority.\n \nSame is the view\n held by another three Judges Bench in \nA. P. M. Mayankutty\n v. Secretary Public Service Department\n, (1977) 2 SCW 360 :\n\n (1977 Lab IC 551). \nIn Diwakar's case (\nAIR 1982 SC 1555)\n and Venkata Reddy\n case (1993 AIR SCW 2750), this Court\n approved the validity of the exercise of the power under\n proviso to clause (3) of \nArt. 320\n owing to the ban on the\n recruitment by the government and long lapse of time which\n has elapsed from the date of the initial temporary\n appointments till the date the decision was taken by the\n government to regularise the services of such temporary\n appointments.\n\n 20. \nIn \nA. K. Bhatnagar v. Union of India\n, (1991) 1 SCC 544,\n this Court while deprecating the practice of the government\n giving a go-by to the statutory rules or regulations, framed\n under proviso to \nArt. 309\n of the Constitution making large\n scale departure, expressed thus :-\n\n \"On more than one occasion this Court has indicated to\n the Union and the State Governments that once they\n frame rules, their action in respect of matters covered by\n rules should be regulated by the rules. The rules framed\n in exercise of powers conferred under the proviso of \nArt.\n 309\n of the Constitution are solemn rules having binding\n effect. Acting in a manner contrary to the rules does\n create problem and dislocation. Very often government\n themselves get trapped on account of their own mistakes\n or actions in excess of what is provided in the rules. We\n take serious view of these lapses and hope and trust that\n the government both at the Centre and in the States\n would take note of this position and refrain from\n acting in a manner not contemplated by their own rules.\"\n\n140. In the instant case, it is absolutely clear from the above discussion\n\nthat the applicant was first on deputation from 2000 to 2002 in R-1-\n\nNSCS, but was later taken on substantive appointment w.e.f. 03.10.2003,\n\nwhen she was not on deputation from IDSA, since she had resigned from\n\nher post in IDSA with effect from 30.09.2003.\n\n141. We have already discussed above that the nature of her\n\nemployment with R-1-NSCS was never purely on contractual basis, and,\n\n 99\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\ntherefore, she cannot at all be classified under the category of contractual\n\nemployees. It was also not a case of absorption, because absorption can\n\nonly be of a deputationist, or of a temporary or ad hoc worker, or of a\n\nperson working under CCS (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, and,\n\ntherefore, her case was clearly not that of absorption also.\n\n142. In the result, it is clear that from the very beginning from\n\n03.10.2003 itself, the case of the applicant was that of re-employment\n\nonly, since her previous service with IDSA had already been treated by\n\nthe Selection Committee of R-1 NSCS, as provided for in Column 13 of\n\nthe RRs for the post concerned to be analogous service, from which her\n\nemployment was terminated by the IDSA Office Order dated 30.09.2003\n\nand then she was re-employed with R-1 w.e.f. 03.10.2003.\n\n143. We have examined the contents of the Notification No.18/4/51-\n\nEstt.(B) issued on 01.09.1958 by the Government of India, Ministry of\n\nHome Affairs, and subsequently amended many times thereafter, titled\n\nthe Union Public Service Commission (Exemption from Consultation)\n\nRegulations, 1958. It is seen that through DoP&T Notification dated\n\n31.01.2001 issued through GSR 88 dated 17.02.2001, an item No.21 had\n\nbeen introduced in Schedule-I under Regulation-2 of such Union Public\n\nService Commission (Exemption from Consultation) Regulations, 1958, in\n\nwhich the following posts of the R-1 NSCS have been kept out of the\n\npurview of consultations from UPSC.:-\n\n \"(21) Posts of Lt. General, Scientist \"H\", Major General, Scientist\n \"G\", Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director,\n Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, Principal Private Secretary,\n Senior System Analyst, Researc1:l Officer, Private Secretary,\n Section Officer. Protocol Officer, Assistant, Research Assistant,\n\n 100\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n Personal Assistant, Protocol Assistant, Senior Library and\n Information Assistant and Draftsman Grade' I' in the National\n Security Council Secretariat, Cabinet Secretariat.\"\n\n144. However, such blanket exemption from consultation with UPSC\n\naccorded to the R-1 NSCS Organization with effect from 17.02.2001\n\nthrough Gazette Notification GSR-88 cannot be turned into a licence to\n\nindulge in favouritism amongst its employees, and to abuse the discretion\n\nwhich may have become available to R-1 NSCS Organization because of\n\nthat Notification.\n\n145. We have also found something absolutely abhorrent and against all\n\ntenets and principles of law in the counter-reply of R-1 NSCS. One of\n\nthese things is the submission made that only in some cases, the\n\ndiscretion is exercised to provide permanent employment to persons all of\n\nwhom are initially contractually engaged by the R-1 NSCS. We find this\n\nsubmission to be totally obnoxious. There cannot be any absolute\n\ndiscretion. Even the exercise of discretion must be reasonably made and\n\nin public interest, as was held by Lord Halsbury in Sharp v. Wakefield\n\n[1891] AC 173, and which law has been followed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in Manager, Govt. Press v. Balliappa, AIR 1979 SC 429, and in\n\nUnion of India v. Sudhir Kumar Jaiswal\n, 1994 SCC (L&S) 925=1994\n\n(2) SCR 674.\n\n146. If the decision is taken without any principle, or without any norm,\n\nthe four corners of which are required to be known in advance, such\n\ndecision is nothing but arbitrary, and antithesis of the Rule of Law, as\n\n 101\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nwas held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nS.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of\n\nIndia and Ors.\n, AIR 1967 SC 1427, and in Swant Singh v. Assistant\n\nPassport Officer, New Delhi, AIR 1967 SC 1836.\n\n147. In fact, in the United States, in the case of United States v. Martin\n\nWanderlich, 342 US 98=1996 LED 113(1951), this proposition has\n\nbeen beautifully summed up by holding as follows:\n\n \"Law has reached its finest moments when it has freed men\n from unlimited discretion of some rulers, some civil or military\n official, some bureaucrat.......Absolute discretion is a ruthless\n master. It is more destructive of freedom than any of man's\n other inventions\".\n\n148. We have also found that the respondents have not been able to\n\neffectively deny the applicant's averment that the respondent R-1 NSCS\n\nhas become an accommodating ground for all persons whose inclination\n\nis palatable to the ruling dispensation, and to provide them permanent\n\nemployment, without their having even an iota of knowledge about\n\nsecurity scenario of the country. The respondent R-1 NSCS has not been\n\nable to deny the applicant's averment that one of the persons\n\npermanently absorbed in NSCS was previously only in-charge of catering\n\nin the Prime Minister's residence, and was then directly absorbed by\n\nRespondent R-1-NSCS on a higher post of Joint Secretary, without his\n\nhaving absolutely any knowledge of the security scenario of the country.\n\nRespondents also have not been able to deny the applicant's averment\n\nthat one of the named private respondents in this case was earlier only in\n\nthe Personal Section of a Minister, where he could not have gathered or\n\ngained any knowledge of the security scenario of the country, but still he\n\n 102\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nwas absorbed, and given permanent employment with respondent R-1\n\nNSCS, and even in doing so, he was permanently placed ahead of the\n\npresent applicant, who is an expert in the security matters in her own\n\nright, as had been recognized by the respondent R-1 NSCS earlier also,\n\nwhen they had sought her services on deputation from her previous\n\nemployer IDSA. We find this scenario most disappointing and\n\ndepressing, and actually being against the Security interests of the\n\nnation.\n\n149. Therefore, in the conspectus of the law as laid down above, as cited\n\nby us from various Supreme Court's judgments, and from the order dated\n\n28.10.2016 in OA No.1699/2012 (supra), and as is seen from the\n\ndiscussion of the facts of this case, we hold that the applicant was in\n\nsubstantive employment with IDSA earlier, though it was called as a\n\ncontract, and that she was re-employed as Deputy Secretary in\n\nsubstantive capacity with R-1 w.e.f. 03.10.2003, and that she was,\n\ntherefore, fully eligible to count her past analogous employment, with a\n\nsimilar/parallel organization (IDSA) prior to that date, till 30.09.2003.\n\nThis also flows from the Full Bench order of this Tribunal dated\n\n22.04.2009 in OA 1436/07 with OA 1437/2007 and OA 1438/2007- Dr.\n\nSnehal Bhave Vs. UOI & Ors and the connected two cases, which had\n\nbeen followed by the Coordinate Bench in \nOA No.622/2012 Dr. Pankaj\n\nAgnihotri v. Union of India\n.\n\n 103\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n150. In the result, for the foregoing reasons, the OA is allowed, but there\n\nshall be no order as to costs.\n\n(Raj Vir Sharma) (Sudhir Kumar)\n Member (J) Member (A)\n\ncc.\n\nPer RAJ VIR SHARMA, MEMBER(J):\n\n151. After going through the order proposed by the Hon'ble\n\nAdministrative Member, I am unable to agree with the view taken,\n\nas well as the conclusion arrived at, by him in the proposed order.\n\nHence, I am writing this dissenting order.\n\n152. The brief facts of the case, which are not disputed by\n\neither side, are as follows:\n\n(A) The applicant worked on contract basis in the Institute of\n\nDefence Studies and Analysis (hereinafter referred to as 'IDSA'),\n\nNew Delhi, first as Research Assistant on stipend basis from\n\n6.4.1992 to 16.5.1994, and then as Research Officer in the scale of\n\npay of Rs.2200-4000/- (4th \nCPC\n) with effect from 17.5.1994 to\n\n16.5.1996. Her contract appointment as Research Officer was\n\nextended by two more years w.e.f. 17.5.1996.\n\n(B) While continuing as Research Officer for the second term\n\nof two years on contract basis, the applicant was awarded\n\n 104\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nFellowship in the scale of pay of Rs.12000-18000/- (5th \nCPC\n) in\n\nIDSA for two years w.e.f. 15.7.1997, and another Fellowship for two\n\nyears w.e.f. 1.7.1999.\n\n(C ) During the term of her said second Fellowship, the NSCS\n\nappointed the applicant as Research Fellow against a post of\n\nDeputy Secretary in the NSCS, in the scale of pay of Rs.12000-\n\n16500/- (5th \nCPC\n) from 16.8.2000 to 27.9.2002, on loan basis. She\n\nreturned to IDSA on 27.9.2002. She resigned from IDSA and was\n\nrelieved of her duties w.e.f. 10.8.2003. She was paid salary and\n\nterminal benefits by IDSA up to 10.8.2003.\n\n(D) Thereafter, the applicant was appointed as Deputy\n\nSecretary in the scale of Rs.12000-16500/- (5th \nCPC\n) in NSCS on\n\ncontract basis with effect from 3.10.2003 for a period of two years\n\nor until further orders whichever was earlier, vide notification dated\n\n8.12.2003, and office order dated 12.12.2003, issued by the NSCS.\n\nThus, the applicant joined NSCS on a fresh contract w.e.f.\n\n3.10.2003. Her said contract appointment as Deputy\n\nSecretary/Joint Director was extended for a further period of 2\n\nyears w.e.f. 3.10.2005 on the terms and conditions of services \nlaid\n\ndown in\n the agreement, vide order dated 5.6.2006.\n\n(E) Thereafter, the applicant was appointed as Director in\n\nNSCS in the pay scale of Rs.14300-18300/- w.e.f. 29.9.2006 for a\n\nperiod of 5 years on fresh contract, vide order dated 6.10.2006. The\n\n 105\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nsaid contract appointment was extended for one more year, i.e., up\n\nto 28.9.2012, vide order dated 27.09.2011. Before her said contract\n\nappointment came to an end, the applicant was absorbed as\n\nDirector in NSCS w.e.f. 12.4.2012, vide office order dated 12.4.2012\n\n(Annexure A/1).\n\n(F) After her absorption in the post of Director w.e.f.\n\n12.4.2012, the applicant made representation dated 6.3.2013\n\nregarding maintenance of her Service Book, and met the Dy.N.S.A.\n\non 20.11.2013 regarding her promotion as Joint Secretary. The\n\nrespondent-NSCS, vide communication dated 26.11.2013\n\n(Annexure A/2), informed the applicant that her service in IDSA,\n\nand subsequent service in NSCS, with the two being separated by a\n\nmonth and 22 days, cannot be reckoned to be one continuum, and\n\ntherefore, an assessment of her claim for promotion will have to be\n\nmade with reference to her date of joining in NSCS on October 3,\n\n2003, and in accordance with Recruitment Rules and set\n\nprocedures.\n\n(G) Being dissatisfied, the applicant made further\n\nrepresentation dated 11.12.2013 claiming consideration of her case\n\nfor promotion to the grade of Joint Secretary. The respondent-\n\nNSCS, vide its communication dated 29.4.2014 (Annexure A/3),\n\ninformed the applicant that she did not fulfill the eligibility criteria\n\n 106\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nlaid down in\n the Recruitment Rules for promotion to the post of\n\nJoint Secretary.\n\n(H) Therefore, the applicant has filed the present O.A. under\n\nSection 19\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, seeking the\n\nfollowing reliefs:\n\n \"8.a) To quash and set aside the respondent's\n orders dated 12-4-2012, 26-11-2013 and 29-\n\n 4-2014 (Annexure: A-1, A-2 and A-3) and order\n the respondent for applicant's absorption on\n the post of Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of\n India w.e.f. 3-10-2003 and to further order the\n respondent to treat the applicant's\n appointment dated 29-9-2006 on the post of\n Director as promotion w.e.f. from 29-9-2006 as\n already stated by the respondent vide order\n dated 6-10-2006 and to further order the\n respondent to consider the applicant for\n promotion to the post of Joint Secretary in pay\n scale of Rs.37400-67000 + Grade Pay of\n Rs.10,000/- as on 1-10-2009 as per the NSCS\n Recruitment Rules, 2007 and to reckon her\n service in IDSA in continuum for the purpose\n of retirement and pension benefits under CCS\n Pension Rules, 1972.\n\n 8.b) Pass such other order(s) as may be deemed fit\n in the interest of justice.\"\n\n153. Thus, in the present O.A., the applicant has mainly\n\nraised three issues, namely, (1) her absorption from 3.10.2003; (2)\n\npromotion as Joint Secretary, and (3) to reckon her service in IDSA\n\nin continuum for pensionary and other service benefits.\n\n 107\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n154. When the applicant had accepted her appointments as\n\nDeputy Secretary/Joint Director on contract basis w.e.f. 3.10.2003,\n\nand as Director in NSCS w.e.f 29.9.2006 on contract basis, for\n\nspecified periods, and had entered into agreements/contracts with\n\nthe NSCS, and when the NSCS, vide its order dated 12.4.2012\n\n(Annexure A/1), had absorbed her in the post of Director w.e.f.\n\n12.4.2012, I do not find any substance in the claim of the\n\napplicant for being absorbed in NSCS w.e.f. 3.10.2003.\n\n155. Furthermore, it transpires that the applicant never made\n\nany representation before the departmental authority questioning\n\nthe office order dated 12.4.2012 and claiming absorption in NSCS\n\nwith effect from 3.10.2003, i.e., the date when she had joined the\n\nNSCS as Deputy Secretary/Joint Director on contract basis for a\n\nperiod of two years. She has, for the first time, raised the said issue\n\nin the present O.A. \nSection 20\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act,\n\n1985, stipulates that a Tribunal shall not ordinarily admit an\n\napplication unless it is satisfied that the applicant had availed of all\n\nthe remedies available to him. As the applicant has not approached\n\nthe respondent-NSCS in the matter of her absorption w.e.f.\n\n3.10.2003, she cannot be held to have availed of the remedy\n\navailable to her, and, therefore, the present O.A. is liable to be\n\nrejected as being hit by \nSection 20\n of the Administrative Tribunals\n\nAct, 1985.\n\n 108\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n156. As per the National Security Council Secretariat (Group\n\n'A' Services) Recruitment Rules, 2007, in case of promotion to the\n\ngrade of Joint Secretary, officers of NSCS have to fulfill the following\n\neligibility criteria:\n\n (a) 2 years regular service in Director (DIG scale Grade\n\n Pay Rs.8900/-), or\n\n (b) 3 years regular service in Director scale (Grade Pay\n\n Rs.8700/-), or\n\n (c) 8 years regular service in Deputy Secretary's scale\n\n (grade Pay Rs.7600/-);\n\n with total continuous Group 'A' service of 17 years.\n\nThe applicant cannot be said to have fulfilled the eligibility criteria\n\nof minimum total continuous Group 'A' service of 17 years for\n\npromotion as Joint Secretary. Prior to her joining NSCS, she was\n\nworking in IDSA on contract basis. She resigned from IDSA w.e.f.\n\n10.8.2003, and got all terminal benefits from IDSA. Thereafter, she\n\njoined NSCS on contract basis as Deputy Secretary/Joint Director\n\nw.e.f. 3.10.2003. As the eligibility service of an employee counts\n\nfrom the date of absorption, and the service rendered on contract\n\nbasis, not being regular service, cannot be taken into account for\n\ncounting eligibility service for promotion to higher grade, I do not\n\nfind any substance in the claim of the applicant that she had put in\n\n 109\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\nmore than 17 years of Group A service in terms of the Recruitment\n\nRules for promotion to the post of Joint Secretary.\n\n157. The applicant's appointment as Director with effect from\n\n29.9.2006 was on a fresh contract. She herself had signed a fresh\n\ncontract while accepting the said offer of appointment. There was\n\nalso no provision in the Recruitment Rules of 2001 for promotion\n\nfrom the post of Deputy Secretary to the post of Director. Therefore,\n\nthe claim of the applicant that she was promoted from the post of\n\nDeputy Secretary/Joint Director to the post of Director in 2006 is\n\nuntenable. The provision regarding promotion from the post of\n\nDeputy Secretary/Joint Director to the post of Director was made\n\nonly in the National Security Council Secretariat (Group 'A' Service)\n\nRecruitment Rules, 2007. The respondent-NSCS, vide order dated\n\n20.10.2014 (Annexure R/13), rectified the office order dated\n\n6.10.2006, ibid, where the word 'promotion' was inadvertently\n\nmentioned. In this view of the matter, I do not find any substance in\n\nthe contention of the applicant that her appointment as Deputy\n\nSecretary/Joint Director was deemed to be regularized with effect\n\nfrom 3.10.2003 on the issuance of the office order dated 6.10.2006\n\nby the respondent-NSCS promoting her from the post of Deputy\n\nSecretary/Joint Director to the post of Director with effect from\n\n29.9.2006 on contract basis.\n\n 110\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n158. As already noted, the applicant was working in IDSA on\n\ncontract basis. Consequent to her resignation, she was relieved\n\nfrom IDSA w.e.f. 10.8.2003. She was paid all terminal benefits up to\n\n10.8.2003. Thereafter, she joined NSCS again on contract basis\n\nwith effect from 3.10.2003, and continued to work in NSCS on\n\ncontract basis till 12.4.2012 when she was absorbed in the post of\n\nDirector. The CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, were applicable to regular\n\nappointees up to 31.12.2003. The regular employees with effect\n\nfrom 1.1.2004 were eligible for New Pension Scheme. Therefore, I do\n\nnot find any substance in the applicant's claim to reckon her\n\nservice in IDSA in continuum for the purpose of retirement and\n\npension benefits under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.\n\n159. The decisions relied on by the applicant, which have been\n\ndiscussed by the learned Administrative Member, being\n\ndistinguishable on facts, are of no help to the case of the applicant.\n\n160. Resultantly, the O.A. is dismissed as being hit by \nSection\n\n20\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, and also being devoid\n\nof merit. No costs.\n\n (RAJ VIR SHARMA)\n JUDICIAL MEMBER\n\nReferral order under \nSection 26\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act,\n\n1985:\n\n 111\n\n OA No.3963/2014\n\n161.

In England the position is\n different. The civil service despite its great size and importance,\n is largely staffed and regulated under arrangements which are\n legally anomalous. It has generally been held that at common law\n civil servants of the Crown, and military servants also, have no\n legal right to their salaries and no legal protection against\n wrongful dismissal. Although recently the picture has changed\n substantially, the law has long regarded the civil service as if it\n still consisted of a handful of secretaries working behind the\n scenes in a royal palace. Although it has lost its domestic\n character in every other respect, it is still in a primitive state of\n legal evolution."

No master can be compelled\nto employ a servant, any more than a servant can be\ncompelled to serve a master. The argument that the Crown\ncould not otherwise relieve the public of an undesirable servant\ntherefore falls to the ground., It may be said that the Crown\nshould not be put in the dilemma of ignoring the public interest\nor else committing a breach of contract-for a breach of contract,\ndespite Mr. Justice Holmes's famous theory to the contract, is a\nwrongful act. But to that it can be answered that it is of even\ngreater importance that engagements expressly entered into\nshould at least be honoured in the breach, if not in the\nobservance.

The\n powers of the Government under \nArt. 309\n to make rules,\n to regulate the service conditions of its employees are\n very wide and unfettered. These powers can be exercised\n unilaterally without the consent of the employees concerned. It\n will, therefore, be idle to contend that in the case of employees\n under the Government, the terms of the contract of\n appointment should prevail over the rules governing their\n service conditions. The origin of Government service often\n times is contractual. There is always an offer and\n acceptance, thus bringing it to being a completed contract\n between the Government and its employees. \nOnce\n appointed, a Government servant acquires a status and\n thereafter his position is not one governed by the contract\n of appointment. Public law governing service conditions\n steps in to regulate the relationship between the employer\n and employee. His emoluments and other service\n conditions are thereafter regulated by the appropriate\n statutory authority empowered to do so.
