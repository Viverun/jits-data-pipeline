No. 326 of 2007\n\nSoma Banerjee\nVersus\nSubhrojyoti Banerjee\n\nFor the Appellant: Mr. Basudev Gayen,\nMr. Biswajit Dutta.\n\nFor the Respondent: Mr. Seikh Kamal Uddin,\nMr. Subhrojyoti Chakraborty,\nMr. Arun Kr. Mondal.\n\nHeard on: 07.07.2009.\n\nJudgment on: 5th August, 2009.\n\nBhaskar Bhattacharya, J.:\n\nThis first appeal is at the instance of a wife in a suit for divorce and is\n\ndirected against the judgment and decree dated 14th May, 2007, passed by the\n\nAdditional District Judge, Second Court, Hooghly, in Matrimonial Suit No.232 of\n\n2001 thereby granting a decree for divorce on the ground of cruelty.\n\nBeing dissatisfied, the wife has come up with the present appeal.\nThe respondent before us filed in the Court of District Judge, Hooghly, a\n\nsuit being Matrimonial Suit No.232 of 2001 for restitution of conjugal rights\n\nwhich was subsequently converted into a suit for divorce by way of amendment.\n\nThe case made out by the respondent as it appears from the amended\n\nplaint may be summarized thus:\n\na) The parties were married according to Hindu rites and customs on 21st\n\nFebruary, 2000 and had been residing together as husband and wife.\n\nb) The wife was at that point of time a student in graduate class in Serampore\n\nCollege. Shortly after marriage, it was discovered that the wife was\n\nextremely arrogant in her attitude and used to disrespect the husband and\n\nhis parents.\n\nc) The wife started picking up quarrel with the husband and his parents and\n\neven the request of the mother-in-law to have tiffin or meal was considered\n\nby the wife as disturbance in matrimonial relationship between the parties.\n\nd) At the time of dinner, the members of the family used to communicate with\n\neach other about every day's affairs and the wife posed to be a\n\nrepresentative from the higher status of society. She very often refused to\n\nparticipate in the dining table on the pretence that she did not develop\n\nappetite. She delayed taking meals and her mother-in-law had to wait. It\n\nso happened on several occasions that after long wait by the mother-in-\n\nlaw, the wife divulged that she would not take meal on that night. The\nmorning after such night was full of embarrassment; the wife used to make\n\nphone call to her father stating that no food was supplied to her in the\n\nprevious night and shortly thereafter, the father of the wife appeared with\n\nready food to feed her. This was a matter of humiliation for the whole\n\nfamily.\n\ne) The wife was to attend her college from the matrimonial home and was\n\nultramodern in her costume and exposure. The husband and the father-in-\n\nlaw used to raise objection for her unconventional costumes and for that,\n\nthe wife flew into rage.\n\nf) The wife did not care for the normal family requirements and discipline.\n\nShe did not return home after break of her college hours and again on\n\noccasions, she used to return in the company of a group of boys and girls\n\nand at times, with either a boy or any other girl. The companions of the\n\nwife followed her to the bedroom and used to gossip for hours. The father\n\nof the husband raised objection whenever the wife took any of her\n\nboyfriends in the bedroom.\n\ng) The wife used to visit her paternal house without giving even any\n\nintimation.\n\nh) She developed a peculiar habit of holding threat to the members of the\n\nfamily of the husband that she would take resort to police machinery so\n\nthat she could put the husband and his parents beyond the prison bar. On\n\n23rd April, 2001 the respondent left the matrimonial home against the will\n\nof the husband and without the consent of the members and the family.\n\ni) Immediately after filing of the suit for restitution of conjugal right by the\n\nhusband, the wife after receiving the summons of the suit, made a frivolous\n\ncomplaint under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code and a case was\n\nregistered being Chinsurah Police Station Case No.227 dated 5th October,\n\n2001. The police on several occasions raided the house of the husband\n\nand searched for the husband and his ailing parents who were indicted as\n\naccused persons in the case. To evade arrest, the husband and his\n\nparents were compelled to abscond. Ultimately, they got anticipatory bail\n\nfrom the Court of law.\n\nj) The father of the husband who was a patient of diabetes and having\n\nwaning eyesight, due to such cruel conduct of the wife became further ill\n\nand passed away on 21st April, 2003. Ultimately, the learned S.D.J.M.,\n\nHooghly Sadar acquitted all the accused persons including the husband\n\nfrom the unfounded, harassing and mala fide charges levelled by the wife\n\nagainst them on 12th April, 2005. The aforesaid conduct amounted to\n\ncruelty.\n\nThe suit was contested by the wife by filing written statement thereby\n\ndenying the material allegations made in the plaint and the defence of the\n\nrespondent may be summed up thus:\n\na) The father of the husband sought appropriate bride through advertisement\n\nin the Anandabazar Patrika and the father of the wife responded to that\n\nadvertisement and after negotiation, the marriage was settled as the\ndemand of the father of the husband was within the limit of the father of\n\nthe wife.\n\nb) At the time of the marriage, gold ornaments weighing around 25 bhories,\n\nwooden cot, wooden almirah with glass, bedding, utensils, and numbers of\n\nsarees as namaskari, and many other things were given as per demand of\n\nthe family of the husband.\n\nc) Soon after the marriage, the parents of the husband did not hesitate to\n\nexpress that they were not happy with the quality of goods given during\n\nmarriage and particularly, there was implied indication to give some more\n\nquantity of ornament and furniture and the husband had also support in\n\nsuch demand.\n\nd) Thereafter, the mental cruelty upon the wife started, but the wife was not\n\nfrustrated immediately and being a soft and sober lady, she thought that\n\ninstead of informing all these demands to her parents, she would tackle all\n\nthe problem by her soft behaviour. She gladly and with smile accepted all\n\ndomestic works and practically, within a very short period she became the\n\nmaidservant of that family.\n\ne) When in the night she expected some soft affection and love from her\n\nhusband, she used to experience mechanical sex exploitation and she\n\ncould feel that her husband was just using her as the instrument for sex\n\nsatisfaction and he never cared for the satisfaction of the wife.\n\nf) The husband was only concerned with sex and after the marriage, the\n\nhusband took the wife to Darjeeling and there also there was no change in\nthe attitude of the husband. Practically there was no demand except sex\n\nand the wife who had a sense of culture was gradually frustrated, as she\n\nwas neither getting any romance nor any satisfaction in the field of sex.\n\ng) Similar was the situation when the wife was taken to Digha. The husband\n\nstarted suspecting the wife and while he left for office, he first dropped the\n\nwife at her college at Serampore, a college exclusively for the girls and then\n\nleft for his office. The husband used check up the regular routine of the\n\nclasses and everyday got ensured that the respondent came home\n\nimmediately after the classes were over and thus, even her movement was\n\nmonitored.\n\nh) The wife being a student of girls' college had no scope to have friendship\n\nwith any boy and the allegation that sometimes she used to return from\n\ncollege with even by a boyfriend was nothing but creation of some grounds\n\nof the suit.\n\ni) The husband used to take dinner with his parents regularly and the same\n\nwas served by the wife but never was she asked to sit with them for taking\n\ndinner. The wife had to get up early in the morning to finish the household\n\nworks and the cooking for the entire family before she left for her college.\n\nThough the wife did all the works always with smiling face, she was always\n\nneglected by all the members of the family. She was provided with\n\nminimum food which was given by the mother-in-law and that too, in a\n\nseparate place and never on the dinner table.\n\nk) The wife was never given any opportunity to develop any intimacy with the\n\nneighbours. She was never allowed to go outside the house alone. Even\n\nwhen she had to remain alone in the house she was kept confined because\n\nthe mother-in-law locked the door from outside.\n\nl) When the tolerance of the wife exceeded the limit, she asked her husband\n\nas to why at least he was not protecting her from that torture, he became\n\nfurious and gave out that she would have to adjust all these and she was\n\nthreatened that they had many good lawyers and had tremendous\n\ninfluence over police and hence she would be given proper lessons if she\n\ndid any excess.\n\nm) In conspiracy with the husband and his mother, his father by force got\n\nsome signed blank papers. One day the wife met with a mild accident while\n\nshe was returning back to her matrimonial home and she disclosed such\n\nfact to her mother-in-law. But thereafter, the father-in-law insisted the\n\nwife on saying that she wanted to commit suicide. One day the wife was\n\nalone in her matrimonial home for sometime and then she took a cassette\n\nfrom the rack of cassette and put the same in the player and was surprised\n\nto find that the father-in-law got the said conversation recorded in that\n\ncassette. On 21st March, 2001 in the morning at the instance of the\n\nparents-n-law the husband took the wife forcibly to her father's house and\n\nleft the wife at a place which is quite far off of her paternal home.\n\nn) Thereafter, the parents of the wife advised her to wait for sometime and on\n\n1st April, 2001 in the morning, the father of the wife took her to her\nmatrimonial home but the father-in-law practically drove them out with\n\nfilthy languages.\n\no) Thereafter, the wife contacted her husband over telephone and said that it\n\nwas entirely her fault and she committed that whatever be the torture, she\n\nwould tolerate and would not make any allegation and she requested her\n\nhusband to be kind enough to take her back. The husband, however, then\n\nasked her to come near United Bank, Chinsurah at 5-30 p.m. on 15th April,\n\n2001. The wife, accordingly, came and the husband took to her\n\nmatrimonial home. The usual torture however continued.\n\np) With the advice of his parents, the husband took to her to a doctor saying\n\nthat she needed some treatment and she was taken to the chamber of Dr.\n\nJayanta Basu but she noticed in the nameplate that the said doctor was a\n\npsychiatrist and as such, she refused to go to the doctor. The husband\n\ntried to procure a document to show that the wife had some psychiatric\n\nproblem which could be used to support a ground for divorce and as they\n\ncould not do that all of them became furious and on 23rd April, 2001 the\n\nhusband and his parents ill-treated the wife ans asked her to bring\n\nRs.20,000/- immediately. When the wife raised objection, she and her\n\nparents were driven out and since then she compelled to live with her\n\nparents. She first intended to seek the interference Women Protection Cell\n\nat Chinsurah instead of lodging F.I.R. with the police but thereafter, she\n\nwas surprised to receive a notice of the suit for restitution of conjugal right\n\nwith all false averment and thereafter, the wife decided to lodge a complaint\nagainst husband and his parents under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode. The contents of the complaint were correct. The wife subsequently,\n\nby filing amendment prayed for restitution of conjugal rights.\n\nAt the time of hearing, the husband and his mother appeared as witness\n\nfor the husband while the wife alone gave evidence in opposing the claim.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the learned Trial Judge by the judgment and decree\n\nimpugned herein was pleased to decree the suit on the ground that the act of the\n\nwife amounted to cruelty.\n\nBeing dissatisfied, the wife has come up with the present appeal.\n\nAfter hearing the learned counsel for the parties and after going through\n\nthe materials on record, we find that the learned Trial Judge has granted decree\n\nmainly on the ground that in the written statement the wife made deliberate false\n\nallegations against the husband and his parents of demand of dowry and torture\n\nfor the purpose of getting the same which has been proved to be false in the\n\ncriminal proceedings initiated by the wife where the accused persons were all\n\nacquitted. According to the learned Trial Judge such false allegations were\n\nsufficient to pass a decree for divorce against the wife.\n\nWe have gone through the judgment of the criminal Court acquitting the\n\naccused persons which has been marked as Exhibit in this proceeding for\n\ndivorce. It appears that on the complaint of the wife under\nSection 498A\nof the\nIndian Penal Code, not only the husband but also his parents were indicted and\n\ncharge-sheeted. The father of the husband died during the pendency of the\n\nproceedings and ultimately, on trial the accused persons were all acquitted as the\n\nlearned criminal Court disbelieved the evidence of the prosecution. It appears\n\nthat the husband is an employee of the Central Government. The wife although\n\nsubsequently by way of amendment of the written statement prayed for\n\nrestitution of conjugal rights, in our opinion, the learned Trial Judge rightly\n\nturned down such prayer because it was apparent that she had no intention of\n\nliving with the husband as would appear from the fact that knowing well that her\n\nhusband would lose the job for the step she was going to take, she deliberately\n\nmade the false allegation against her husband and parents-in-law.\n\nThe aforesaid action on the part of the wife definitely comes within the\n\ndefinition of cruelty within the meaning of the\nHindu Marriage Act\n. We, therefore,\n\ndo not find any reason to disturb the aforesaid decree for divorce granted by the\n\nlearned Trial Judge.\n\nAs regards the decree of permanent alimony, we find that the learned Trial\n\nJudge granted a decree for permanent alimony at the rate of Rs.2500/- a month.\n\nBefore us, the husband placed the latest salary certificate indicating that his\n\npresent monthly salary is Rs.19000/-. After taking into consideration the\n\nchanged circumstances as well as the conduct of the wife, we modify the decree\n\nfor permanent alimony by directing the husband to pay a onetime alimony of\nRs.3 lakh to the wife payable by the respondent to the wife within three months\n\nfrom today. Till the period of three months from today or payment of Rs.3 lakh\n\nwhichever is earlier, the respondent will go on paying alimony at the rate he has\n\nbeen paying. The decree for permanent alimony passed by us will be executable\n\nafter the expiry of three months from today.\n\nThe appeal is thus disposed of by affirming the decree for divorce and\n\nmodifying the decree of permanent alimony as indicated above.\n\nIn the facts and circumstances, there will be, however, no order as to\n\ncosts.\n\n(Bhaskar Bhattacharya, J.)\n\nI agree.\n\n(Prasenjit Mandal, J.)",
