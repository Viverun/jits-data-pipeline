P. COLABAWALLA, J.\n\nDATE : 9th MARCH, 2021\n\nP.C. :\n\n1. The present Arbitration Petition is filed by the petitioners\n\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for\n\nshort the \"\nArbitration Act\n\") challenging the Award dated 4th\n\nPage 1 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nAugust, 2019 passed by the Sole Arbitrator.\n\n2. At the very outset, respondent No.1 has taken a\n\npreliminary objection that this Court does not have jurisdiction to\n\nentertain the present petition filed under\nSection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration Act. Respondent No.1 has urged that before the petition\n\nbe entertained on merits, the issue of jurisdiction of this Court be\n\ndecided first.\n\n3. In order to decide the preliminary issue of jurisdiction, it\n\nwould be necessary to set out some brief facts. The arbitration clause\n\nin the loan agreement executed between the parties reads as under:-\n\n\"In the event of any dispute or differences arising under this\nAgreement including any dispute as to any amount outgoing, the\nreal meaning or purport thereof (\"Dispute\"), such Dispute shall be\nfinally resolved by arbitration. Such arbitration shall be conducted\nin accordance with the provisions of the\nIndian Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\nor any amendment or re-enactment thereof\nby a single arbitrator to be appointed by the Lender. The venue of\narbitration shall be at New Delhi and the arbitration shall be\nconducted in English language\".\n\n(Emphasis Supplied.)\n\nPage 2 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n4. Since disputes arose between the parties, arbitral\n\nproceedings were instituted at New Delhi and which culminated into\n\nan Arbitral Award dated 30th January, 2013 (for short the \"First\n\nArbitral Award\") in favour of respondent No.1. This First Arbitral\n\nAward was passed at New Delhi.\n\n5. This First Arbitral Award was challenged by the\n\npetitioners herein before this Court by filing Arbitration Petition No.\n\n427 of 2013 [the earlier\nSection 34\npetition] under\nSection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration Act. In the said petition, respondent No.1 appeared on\n\nsix occasions before this Court [as recorded in paragraph 3 of the\n\njudgment of this Court dated 17th August, 2015]. Despite respondent\n\nNo.1 appearing on several occasions, it did not object to the territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court to decide the said petition. Finally, the First\n\nArbitral Award was set aside by a learned Single Judge of this Court\n\non 17th August, 2015.\n\n6. Respondent No.1 accepted this order and did not\n\nchallenge the same or file any application for review or modification\n\nthereof. It, in fact, acted in furtherance thereto and initiated fresh\n\nPage 3 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\narbitration proceedings by nominating respondent No.2 as the Sole\n\nArbitrator on 9th February, 2018. On 9th March, 2019 the Sole\n\nArbitrator issued a disclosure statement under the\nArbitration Act\n.\n\nIt is the case of the petitioners that though the Sole Arbitrator\n\ndisclosed that he had been an Arbitrator in 500 arbitrations for\n\nvarious Financial Institutions, he did not disclose whether he had\n\nserved as an Arbitrator in any matter concerning the 1st respondent\n\n- bank. It is also the case of the petitioners that they applied to the\n\nSole Arbitrator on several occasions for receiving copies of the papers\n\nand proceedings in the arbitration, but without any success. Apart\n\nfrom the Statement of Claim, nothing was served on the petitioner.\n\nThis, of course, is not germane for me to decide the preliminary issue\n\nof jurisdiction raised by respondent No.1. Be that as it may, the\n\nArbitral Tribunal thereafter passed a fresh Award on 3rd August,\n\n2019 (for short the \"Second Arbitral Award\"). This arbitration also\n\ntook place at New Delhi and the Second Arbitral Award was also\n\npassed at New Delhi. It is the Second Arbitral Award that is\n\nchallenged in the present petition.\n\n7. In this factual backdrop, Mr. Kanade, the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of respondent No.1, submitted that the \"seat\" of\n\nPage 4 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\narbitration, as designated by the parties, is admittedly New Delhi and\n\nthe petitioners do not even dispute that the \"seat\" of the Arbitral\n\nTribunal is at New Delhi. He submitted that now it is well settled that\n\nonce a \"seat\" is designated by the parties, then only the Courts where\n\nthe \"seat\" is situate would have jurisdiction to entertain all\n\napplications/petitions arising out of the arbitral proceedings. Mr.\n\nKanade submitted that the moment the \"seat\" is designated by the\n\nparties, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Once the arbitral\n\n\"seat\" is determined, the \"seat\" of arbitration alone determines the\n\njurisdiction of the Courts over the arbitration.\nIn this regard, Mr.\n\nKanade relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nBGS SGS Soma JV versus NHPC Ltd.\n[(2020) 4 SCC 234] and\n\nmore particularly paragraphs 49 to 59 thereof. He submitted that the\n\nSupreme Court in the aforesaid case clearly stipulates that the Courts\n\nhaving jurisdiction over the \"arbitral seat\" would have exclusive\n\njurisdiction due to which any proceedings filed in any other Court,\n\nwould have to be held as proceedings filed in a Court without\n\njurisdiction. Relying upon the aforesaid decision, Mr. Kanade\n\nsubmitted that in the present case, since the parties to the arbitration\n\nagreement had chosen New Delhi as the \"arbitral seat\"/ \"juridical\n\nseat\", the present petition could have been filed only in the Courts at\n\nPage 5 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nNew Delhi, and no other. He therefore submitted that any petition\n\nfiled to challenge the Second Arbitral Award can only be at the Courts\n\nat New Delhi.\n\n8. Mr. Kanade then argued that though the petitioners do\n\nnot dispute that the \"seat\" of the Arbitral Tribunal is at New Delhi,\n\nthey assert that this Court would have jurisdiction by virtue of\n\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act. Mr. Kanade submitted that in the\n\nfacts of the present case,\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act would have\n\nno application at all. It was his submission that\nSection 42\nwould\n\ncome into play only in two categories, namely, (i) where the \"seat\"\n\nhas been identified by parties in the contract; or (ii) where the \"seat\"\n\nis not specified. Mr. Kanade submitted that the present case\n\nadmittedly falls in the first category i.e. where the arbitral \"seat\" has\n\nbeen identified by the parties. In cases falling under the second\n\ncategory, namely, where no seat is designated, the application of\n\nSection 42\nwould depend on where part of the cause of action has\n\narisen in the territorial jurisdiction of different Courts. This situation\n\nhas been succinctly elucidated in paragraph 59 of the aforesaid\n\nSupreme Court judgment in the case of\nSoma JV\n(supra). However,\n\nthis Court is not called upon to examine the application of\nSection 42\n\nPage 6 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nin such cases. The present case squarely falls within the first\n\ncategory, namely, where the arbitral \"seat\" has been designated by\n\nthe parties. Mr. Kanade submitted that where the arbitral \"seat\" is\n\ndesigned by the parties,\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act would be\n\napplicable only if an application inter alia under\nSection 9\nor under\n\nSection 34\nis made in a Court having jurisdiction over the arbitral\n\n\"seat\" as determined by the parties.\n\nHe submitted that this is the\n\nposition in law as enunciated in paragraph 59 of the Judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court in\nSoma JV\n(supra).\n\n9. Mr. Kanade then relied upon another decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nState of West Bengal & Ors. Vs\n\nAssociated Contractors\n[(2015) 1 SCC 32] to contend that any\n\napplication preferred to a Court other than the one that is conferred\n\nwith exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of the \"seat\" being agreed to\n\nbetween the parties, would also be without jurisdiction. In the\n\npresent case, once the parties have designated New Delhi as the\n\narbitral \"seat\", the Courts at New Delhi alone have exclusive\n\njurisdiction. In such a scenario, filing of the earlier\nSection 34\n\npetition [Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013] challenging the First\n\nPage 7 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nArbitral Award in this Court would not denude or affect the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the Courts at New Delhi. He submitted that in fact this\n\nCourt did not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the earlier\n\nSection 34\npetition (challenging the First Arbitral Award) since\n\nexclusive jurisdiction was vested by the parties in the Courts at New\n\nDelhi. Mr. Kanade submitted that if this be the case then the reliance\n\nplaced by the petitioners on\nSection 42\nto confer jurisdiction on this\n\nCourt is wholly misplaced. This is for the simple reason that for\n\nSection 42\nto apply, the first application had to be made to a Court\n\nthat had jurisdiction to entertain it and not otherwise.\n\n10. Mr. Kanade then submitted that it is a settled position in\n\nlaw that the parties cannot arrogate jurisdiction to a Court which\n\ndoes not have inherent jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute.\n\nThis being the case, the contentions raised by the petitioners about\n\nrespondent No.1 having waived its objection to the territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court does not hold any merit. He submitted that\n\nonce the Courts in New Delhi were conferred exclusive jurisdiction by\n\nvirtue of the fact that the \"seat\" of arbitration was in New Delhi, the\n\nsame would mean that no other Court [save and except the ones at\n\nNew Delhi] would have jurisdiction, whether territorial or subject-\n\nPage 8 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nmatter, to entertain the present petition. He, therefore, submitted\n\nthat it cannot be contended that this Court had territorial jurisdiction\n\nto decide the earlier\nSection 34\nPetition. If this be the case, then the\n\nreliance placed on\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act is wholly\n\nmisconceived and it be, therefore, held that the present petition is\n\nliable to be rejected on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.\n\n11. On the other hand, Dr. Chandrachud, the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the petitioners, submitted that since disputes\n\narose between the parties, respondent No.1 invoked arbitration\n\nwhich culminated in the First Arbitral Award. The First Arbitral\n\nAward was then challenged before this Court by filing Arbitration\n\nPetition No.427 of 2013 [the earlier\nSection 34\npetition]. In the said\n\npetition, respondent No.1 appeared on six occasions before this\n\nCourt, after which this Court set aside the First Arbitral Award vide\n\nits order dated 17th August, 2015. At no point of time, did respondent\n\nNo.1 ever raise any objection to the territorial jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt to entertain the earlier\nSection 34\npetition [i.e. Arbitration\n\nPetition No.427 of 2013]. Dr. Chandrachud submitted that this does\n\nnot stop here. Respondent No.1 thereafter accepted the order dated\n\n17th August 2015 passed by this Court setting aside the First Arbitral\n\nPage 9 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nAward and thereafter initiated fresh arbitration proceedings. On 9th\n\nFebruary, 2018, respondent No.1 nominated respondent No.2 as an\n\nArbitrator who ultimately passed the Second Arbitral Award and\n\nwhich is impugned in the present petition. Dr. Chandrachud\n\nsubmitted that respondent No.1, having participated in the\n\narbitration proceedings before this Court in the first round and not\n\nhaving raised any objection to this Court's territorial jurisdiction, as\n\nwell as acting in furtherance of the order passed by this Court on 17th\n\nAugust, 2015 by invoking a fresh arbitration, is now precluded from\n\ncontending that this Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the\n\nearlier\nSection 34\npetition [i.e. Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013].\n\nIf this be the case, then\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act is clearly\n\napplicable, and therefore, all subsequent proceedings arising out of\n\nand with respect to the arbitration agreement between the parties,\n\nwould have to be filed only in this Court.\n\n12. To substantiate his argument, Dr. Chandrachud took me\n\nthrough the provisions of\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act and\n\ncontended that where with respect to an arbitration agreement any\n\napplication under\nPart I of Arbitration Act\nhas been made in a Court,\n\nthat Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings\n\nPage 10 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nand all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the\n\narbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other\n\nCourt. In the instant case, admittedly the present Arbitration Petition\n\nfiled under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act arises out of the same\n\narbitration agreement between the parties as was the previous\n\nArbitration Petition filed under\nSection 34\nof the Act [i.e. Arbitration\n\nPetition No.427 of 2013] and entertained by this Court. Therefore,\n\nunder\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act, this Court alone has the\n\njurisdiction to hear and decide the present petition, was the\n\nsubmission.\n\n13. Dr. Chandrachud also relied upon the decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nState of West Bengal & Ors Vs.\n\nAssociated Contractors\n(supra) to contend that the words used in\n\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act are \"with respect to an arbitration\n\nagreement\" which are words of wide import and would take within its\n\nsweep all applications made before, during or even after the arbitral\n\nproceedings are over. He therefore submitted that in the instant case\n\nit is this Court alone which would now have jurisdiction to entertain\n\nall applications with respect to the \"arbitration agreement\" entered\n\nPage 11 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\ninto between the petitioners and respondent No.1.\n\n14. Dr. Chandrachud submitted that respondent No.1, by not\n\nraising the issue of territorial jurisdiction of this Court when it\n\nentertained the earlier\nSection 34\npetition. [i.e. Arbitration Petition\n\nNo.427 of 2013] and further, accepting the judgment/order passed\n\ntherein on 17th August, 2015, not only waived their objection to\n\nterritorial jurisdiction but in fact accepted the jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt. It is, therefore, now too late in the day for respondent No.1 to\n\ncontend that this Court did not have territorial jurisdiction to\n\nentertain the earlier\nSection 34\npetition [i.e. Arbitration Petition\n\nNo.427 of 2013]. Dr. Chandrachud, submitted that in the case of\n\nSnehalata Goel Vs Pushpalata\n[(2019) 3 SCC 594] the Supreme\n\nCourt has clearly held that territorial jurisdiction of the Court does\n\nnot go to the root of the matter unlike subject matter jurisdiction. He,\n\ntherefore, submitted that the party who fails to object to the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of the Court, cannot subsequently dispute its\n\nterritorial jurisdiction in another proceeding. Dr. Chandrachud\n\nsubmitted that applying the aforesaid principle, respondent No.1, by\n\nfailing to object to the territorial jurisdiction of this Court to entertain\n\nthe earlier\nSection 34\npetition [i.e. Arbitration Petition No.427 of\n\nPage 12 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n2013], it had waived its right to now object to the territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court.\n\n15. Dr. Chandrachud lastly submitted that the reliance placed\n\nby respondent No.1 on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case\n\nof\nSoma JV\n(supra) is wholly misconceived. The Supreme Court\nin\n\nthat case\nhad not dealt with a case like the present one in which the\n\nparty contesting the jurisdiction of the Court in the subsequent\n\napplication had failed to object to the territorial jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt in the previous application.\n\nHe submitted that if one looks at\n\nthe facts of the case in\nSoma JV\n(supra), it is clear that the same is\n\ncompletely distinguishable on facts and has no application to the\n\npresent matter. Dr. Chandrachud submitted that the ratio of any\n\ndecision must be understood in the background of the facts of that\n\ncase.\n\nHe submitted that the case is only an authority for what it\n\nactually decides and not what logically follows from it. In this regard\n\nDr. Chandrachud relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of\nSarva Shramik Sanghatana (KV) Vs State of Maharashtra\n\n[(2008) 1 SCC 494]. Relying upon this decision, Dr. Chandrachud\n\nsubmitted that a little difference in the facts or additional facts may\n\nPage 13 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nmake a lot of difference in the precedential value of a decision.\n\nDr.\n\nChandrachud submitted that in the case of\nSoma JV\n(supra) the\n\nfacts revealed that the issue of jurisdiction was raised at the very first\n\ninstance and not a situation like the present one where the party had\n\nwaived its right to raise the issue of territorial jurisdiction. He,\n\ntherefore, submitted that there was no merit in the preliminary issue\n\nof jurisdiction raised by respondent No.1 and hence the same ought\n\nto be rejected.\n\n16. I have heard the learned counsel for parties at great\n\nlength and have perused the papers and proceedings in the above\n\nmatter. To understand this controversy, it would be appropriate to\n\nonce again set out the admitted facts. Admittedly, respondent No.1\n\ninitiated arbitral proceedings which culminated into the First\n\nArbitral Award [Arbitral Award dated 30th January, 2013]. The First\n\nArbitral Award was challenged in this Court by filing Arbitration\n\nPetition No.427 of 2013 under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act [the\n\nearlier\nSection 34\npetition]. Respondent No.1, who appeared on six\n\noccasions before this Court in Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013,\n\nnever contended or even raised the issue that this Court did not have\n\nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain Arbitration Petition No.427 of\n\nPage 14 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n2013 [the earlier\nSection 34\npetition]. Ultimately, the First Arbitral\n\nAward was set aside by this Court vide its order dated 17th August,\n\n2015. After the order was passed by this Court on 17th August, 2015,\n\nfresh arbitration proceedings were initiated by respondent No.1.\n\nThese fresh arbitration proceedings culminated into a fresh Arbitral\n\nAward dated 4th August, 2019 [the Second Arbitral Award], and\n\nwhich is impugned in the present petition. In this background, I have\n\nto examine whether\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act would be\n\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. If it is\n\nnot, then this Court would have no jurisdiction to entertain the above\n\npetition considering that the \"seat\" of arbitration is at New Delhi.\n\n17.\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act reads as under:-\n\n\"42. Jurisdiction. - Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere\nin this Part or in any other law for the time being in force,\nwhere with respect to an arbitration agreement any application\nunder this Part has been made in a Court, that Court alone\nshall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all\nsubsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the\narbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no\nother Court.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n18.\nSection 42\nstipulates that notwithstanding anything\n\nPage 15 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\ncontained elsewhere in\nPart I of the Arbitration Act\nor in any other\n\nlaw for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration\n\nagreement, any application under Part I has been made in a Court,\n\nthat Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings\n\nand all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the\n\narbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other\n\nCourt. For\nSection 42\nto apply, with respect to an arbitration\n\nagreement, an application under Part I has to be made to a \"Court\".\n\nOnly then all subsequent applications arising out of the same\n\narbitration agreement have to be filed only that \"Court\". The word\n\n\"Court\" is defined in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Arbitration Act and reads\n\nthus:-\n\n\"(e) \"Court\" means:-\n\n(i) in the case of an arbitration other than international\ncommercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of\noriginal jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High\nCourt in exercise of its ordinary original civil\njurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions\nforming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same\nhad been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not\ninclude any Civil Court of a grade inferior to such\nprincipal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes;\n\n(ii) in the case of international commercial arbitration, the\nHigh Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil\njurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions\nforming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same\nhad been the subject-matter of a suit, and in other cases,\n\nPage 16 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\na High Court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from\ndecrees of Courts subordinate to that High Court.\"\n\n19. The definition of the word \"Court\" stipulates that a Court\n\nmeans, in a case of an arbitration other than an international\n\ncommercial arbitration, the Principal Civil Court of original\n\njurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in exercise of its\n\nordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the\n\nquestions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same\n\nhad been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any Civil\n\nCourt of a grade inferior to such Principal Civil Court, or any Court of\n\nSmall Causes. In other words, on reading\nSection 2(1)(e)(i)\n[and\n\nwhich is applicable in the present case], it is clear that any Civil Court\n\nof a grade inferior to the Principal Civil Court or any Court of Small\n\nCauses inherently lacks jurisdiction to entertain any application\n\nunder the\nArbitration Act\n. This is for the simple reason that it is only\n\nthe Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and which\n\nincludes the High Court exercising its ordinary original civil\n\njurisdiction that would have jurisdiction to entertain any application\n\nunder the\nArbitration Act\n.\n\nPage 17 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n20. Having seen the relevant provisions, I shall now examine\n\nas to how they apply to the facts of the present case. Earlier, the First\n\nArbitral Award [Arbitral Award dated 30th January, 2013] was\n\nchallenged before this Court by filing Arbitration Petition No. 427 of\n\n2013 [the earlier\nSection 34\npetition]. When that petition was\n\nentertained and heard by this Court and although respondent No.1\n\nappeared in the said matter on six occasions, no objection to the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of this Court was taken by it. Thereafter, the\n\nFirst Arbitral Award was set aside by this Court vide its order dated\n\n17th August, 2015. After this order was passed, respondent No.1\n\naccepted the said order and initiated fresh arbitration proceedings\n\nwhich ultimately culminated in the Second Arbitral Award [the\n\nimpugned Award]. This being the factual position, it is quite clear that\n\nrespondent No.1, by its conduct, had submitted to the territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court and waived its right to object to the same\n\nwhen it entertained Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013 [the earlier\n\nSection 34\npetition] and passed its order dated 17th August, 2015. It\n\nis not as if this Court, when it entertained Arbitration Petition No. 427\n\nof 2013 [the earlier\nSection 34\npetition], lacked inherent jurisdiction\n\nto entertain the said petition. If at all, it did not have territorial\n\njurisdiction to entertain Arbitration Petition No. 427 of 2013 [the\n\nPage 18 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nearlier\nSection 34\npetition]. However, as mentioned earlier,\n\nrespondent No.1 never raised any issue regarding the territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court when it entertained and heard Arbitration\n\nPetition No. 427 of 2013 [the earlier\nSection 34\npetition] and hence\n\nwaived the same. The reason I say this is because it is now well settled\n\nthat when an objection to the territorial jurisdiction of a Court is not\n\ntaken by a party, he is deemed to have waived it and cannot raise that\n\nissue/objection in subsequent proceedings.\nIn this regard, the\n\nreliance placed by Dr. Chandrachud on the Judgment of the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of\nSneh Lata Goel Vs. Pushplata and ors\n[(2019)\n\n3 SCC 594] is well founded. In the facts of that case, an objection was\n\nraised in execution regarding the territorial jurisdiction of the Court\n\nthat passed the decree. It did not relate to subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe Supreme Court inter alia held that an objection to territorial\n\njurisdiction does not travel to the root of or to the inherent lack of\n\njurisdiction of a civil court to entertain the suit and hence can be\n\nwaived. The relevant portion of this decision reads thus:-\n\n\"18. The Court in Kiran Singh case [\nKiran Singh v. Chaman Paswan\n, AIR\n1954 SC 340] disallowed the objection to jurisdiction on the ground\nthat no objection was raised at the first instance and that the party\nfiling the suit was precluded from raising an objection to jurisdiction\n\nPage 19 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nof that court at the appellate stage. This Court concluded thus: (AIR p.\n345, para 16)\n\"16. ... If the law were that the decree of a court which would\nhave had no jurisdiction over the suit or appeal but for the\novervaluation or undervaluation should be treated as a nullity,\nthen of course, they would not be estopped from setting up\nwant of jurisdiction in the court by the fact of their having\nthemselves invoked it. That, however, is not the position under\n\nSection 11\nof the Suits Valuation Act.\"\n\nThus, where the defect in jurisdiction is of kind which falls within\n\nSection 21\nCPC or\nSection 11\nof the Suits Valuation Act, 1887, an\nobjection to jurisdiction cannot be raised except in the manner and\nsubject to the conditions mentioned thereunder. Far from helping the\ncase of the respondent, the judgment in\nKiran Singh [Kiran\nSingh v. Chaman Paswan\n, AIR 1954 SC 340] holds that an objection to\nterritorial jurisdiction and pecuniary jurisdiction is different from an\nobjection to jurisdiction over the subject-matter. An objection to the\nwant of territorial jurisdiction does not travel to the root of or to the\ninherent lack of jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain the suit.\n\n19. In Hira Lal Patni v. Kali Nath [Hira Lal Patni v. Kali Nath, AIR 1962\nSC 199] , a person filed a suit on the original side of the High Court of\nJudicature at Bombay for recovering commission due to him. The\nmatter was referred to arbitration and it resulted in an award in favour\nof the plaintiff. A decree was passed in terms of the award and was\neventually incorporated in a decree of the High Court. In execution\nproceedings, the judgment-debtor resisted it on the ground that no\npart of the cause of action had arisen in Bombay, and therefore, the\nHigh Court had no jurisdiction to try the cause and that all proceedings\nfollowing thereon where wholly without jurisdiction and thus a nullity.\nRejecting this contention, a four-Judge Bench of this Court held thus:\n\n(AIR p. 201, para 4)\n\nPage 20 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n\"4. The objection to its [Bombay High Court]\nterritorial jurisdiction is one which does not go to the competence\nof the court and can, therefore, be waived. In the instant case,\nwhen the plaintiff obtained the leave of the Bombay High Court\non the original side, under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, the\ncorrectness of the procedure or of the order granting the leave\ncould be questioned by the defendant or the objection could\nbe waived by him. When he agreed to refer the matter to\narbitration through court, he would be deemed to have waived\nhis objection to the territorial jurisdiction of the court, raised by\nhim in his written statement. It is well settled that the objection\nas to local jurisdiction of a court does not stand on the same\nfooting as an objection to the competence of a court to try a case.\n\nCompetence of a court to try a case goes to the very root of the\njurisdiction, and where it is lacking, it is a case of inherent lack of\njurisdiction. On the other hand, an objection as to the local\njurisdiction of a court can be waived and this principle has been\ngiven a statutory recognition by enactments like\nSection 21\nof the\nCode of Civil Procedure.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n20. In Harshad Chiman Lal Modi v. DLF Universal Ltd. [Harshad Chiman\nLal Modi v. DLF Universal Ltd., (2005) 7 SCC 791] , this Court held that\nan objection to territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction has to be taken at\nthe earliest possible opportunity. If it is not raised at the earliest, it\ncannot be allowed to be taken at a subsequent stage. This Court held\nthus: (SCC pp. 803-04, para 30)\n\n\"30. ... The jurisdiction of a court may be classified into several\ncategories. The important categories are (i) territorial or local\njurisdiction; (ii) pecuniary jurisdiction; and (iii) jurisdiction over\nthe subject-matter. So far as territorial and pecuniary\njurisdictions are concerned, objection to such jurisdiction has to\nbe taken at the earliest possible opportunity and in any case at\nor before settlement of issues. The law is well settled on the\npoint that if such objection is not taken at the earliest, it cannot\nbe allowed to be taken at a subsequent stage. Jurisdiction as to\n\nPage 21 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nsubject-matter, however, is totally distinct and stands on a\ndifferent footing. Where a court has no jurisdiction over the\nsubject-matter of the suit by reason of any limitation imposed\nby statute, charter or commission, it cannot take up the cause\nor matter. An order passed by a court having no jurisdiction is a\nnullity.\"\n\n21.\nIn\nHasham Abbas Sayyad v. Usman Abbas Sayyad [Hasham Abbas\nSayyad\nv. Usman Abbas Sayyad, (2007) 2 SCC 355] , a two-Judge Bench\nof this Court held thus: (SCC pp. 363-64, para 24)\n\n\"24. We may, however, hasten to add that a distinction must be\nmade between a decree passed by a court which has no\nterritorial or pecuniary jurisdiction in the light of\nSection 21\nof\nthe Code of Civil Procedure, and a decree passed by a court\nhaving no jurisdiction in regard to the subject-matter of the suit.\nWhereas in the former case, the appellate court may not\ninterfere with the decree unless prejudice is shown, ordinarily\nthe second category of the cases would be interfered with.\"\n\n22. Similarly, in\nMantoo Sarkar v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. [Mantoo\nSarkar\nv. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., (2009) 2 SCC 244 : (2009) 1 SCC\n(Civ) 482 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 738] , a two-Judge Bench of this Court\nheld thus: (SCC p. 249, para 20)\n\n\"20. A distinction, however, must be made between a\njurisdiction with regard to the subject-matter of the suit and\nthat of territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction. Whereas in the case\nfalling within the former category the judgment would be a\nnullity, in the latter it would not be. It is not a case where the\nTribunal had no jurisdiction in relation to the subject-matter of\nclaim ... in our opinion, the court should not have, in the absence\nof any finding of sufferance of any prejudice on the part of the\nfirst respondent, entertained the appeal.\"\n\nPage 22 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n23. The objection which was raised in execution in the present case did\nnot relate to the subject-matter of the suit. It was an objection to\nterritorial jurisdiction which does not travel to the root of or to the\ninherent lack of jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain the suit. An\nexecuting court cannot go behind the decree and must execute the\ndecree as it stands.\nIn\nVasudev Dhanjibhai Modi v. Rajabhai Abdul\nRehman [Vasudev Dhanjibhai Modi\nv. Rajabhai Abdul Rehman, (1970) 1\nSCC 670] , the petitioner filed a suit in the Court of Small Causes,\nAhmedabad for ejecting the defendant tenant. The suit was eventually\ndecreed in his favour by this Court. During execution proceedings, the\ndefendant tenant raised an objection that the Court of Small Causes\nhad no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and its decree was a nullity.\nThe court executing the decree and the Court of Small Causes rejected\nthe contention. The High Court reversed the order of the Court of Small\nCauses and dismissed the petition for execution. On appeal to this\nCourt, a three-Judge Bench of this Court, reversed the judgment of the\nHigh Court and held thus: (SCC pp. 672-73, paras 6 & 8)\n\n\"6. A court executing a decree cannot go behind the decree:\n\nbetween the parties or their representatives it must take the\ndecree according to its tenor, and cannot entertain any\nobjection that the decree was incorrect in law or on facts. Until\nit is set aside by an appropriate proceeding in appeal or revision,\na decree even if it be erroneous is still binding between the\nparties.\n\n***\n\n8. ... If the decree is on the face of the record without jurisdiction\nand the question does not relate to the territorial jurisdiction or\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Suits Valuation Act, objection to the\njurisdiction of the court to make the decree may be raised;\n\nwhere it is necessary to investigate facts in order to determine\nwhether the court which had passed the decree had no\njurisdiction to entertain and try the suit, the objection cannot be\nraised in the execution proceeding.\"\n\nPage 23 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n24. In this background, we are of the view that the High Court was\nmanifestly in error in coming to the conclusion that it was within the\njurisdiction of the executing court to decide whether the decree in the\nsuit for partition was passed in the absence of territorial jurisdiction.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n21. From this decision it is clear that when an objection to the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of a Court is not taken at the earliest available\n\nopportunity it cannot be raised in subsequent proceedings. The policy\n\nunderlying the same is that when a case had been tried by a Court on\n\nthe merits and judgment rendered, it should not be liable to be\n\nreversed purely on technical grounds, unless it has resulted in failure\n\nof justice. The policy is to treat objections to territorial jurisdiction as\n\ntechnical and not open to consideration by an Appellate Court or in\n\nsubsequent proceedings, unless there has been a prejudice on the\n\nmerits. In the facts of the present case, I have no hesitation in holding\n\nthat respondent No.1, having submitted to the jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt by appearing in Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013 and not\n\nraising any objection to its territorial jurisdiction, is now precluded\n\nfrom contending that this Court did not have territorial jurisdiction\n\nto entertain Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013 [the earlier\nSection\npetition] and which was finally disposed of by this Court vide its\n\nPage 24 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\norder dated 17th August, 2015.\n\n22. Once having held that respondent No.1 is now precluded\n\nfrom contending that this Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain\n\nArbitration Petition No.427 of 2013 [the earlier\nSection 34\npetition],\n\nthen clearly, by virtue of the provisions of\nSection 42\n, this Court alone\n\nwould have jurisdiction to entertain the present petition filed under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act to challenge the Second Arbitral\n\nAward [the impugned Award]. This is for the simple reason because\n\nSection 42\nstipulates that notwithstanding anything contained\n\nelsewhere in\nPart I of the Arbitration Act\nor in any other law for the\n\ntime being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement,\n\nany application under Part I has been made in a Court, that Court\n\nalone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all\n\nsubsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the\n\narbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other\n\nCourt. This Court is certainly a Court as defined in\nsection 2(1)(e)(i)\n\nin which the earlier\nSection 34\npetition was filed and entertained\n\n[Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013] and the present petition is also\n\nwith respect to the same arbitration agreement as was in Arbitration\n\nPage 25 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nPetition No.427 of 2013 [the earlier\nsection 34\npetition]. Hence\n\npresent petition filed under\nSection 34\nimpugning the Second\n\nArbitral Award would have to be filed only in this Court and no other\n\nCourt.\n\n23. It is true that once the \"seat\" of arbitration is decided by\n\nthe parties, then it is the Courts where the \"seat\" is located would\n\nhave exclusive jurisdiction to decide all applications arising out the\n\narbitration. However, at least as far as domestic arbitrations are\n\nconcerned, the same is a question of territorial jurisdiction. It is not\n\nas if this Court, by entertaining Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013\n\n[the earlier\nSection 34\npetition], despite the \"seat\" being located at\n\nNew Delhi, inherently lacked jurisdiction to entertain it. In fact,\n\nrespondent No.1, despite appearing in the said petition before this\n\nCourt, did not object to its territorial jurisdiction and also acted in\n\nfurtherance of the order passed therein. Not having taken this\n\nobjection in the earlier\nSection 34\npetition [Arbitration Petition\n\nNo.427 of 2013] filed in this Court and submitting to its jurisdiction,\n\nit is now too late in the day for respondent No.1 to contend that this\n\nCourt does not have jurisdiction to entertain the present\nSection 34\n\npetition because this Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the earlier\n\nPage 26 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nSection 34\npetition [Arbitration Petition No.427 of 2013].\n\n24. This now only leaves me to deal with the decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nSoma JV\n(supra) on which heavy\n\nreliance was placed by Mr. Kanade. The facts of that case would show\n\nthat the arbitration clause contemplated that the arbitration\n\nproceedings were to be held in New Delhi / Faridabad, India. On\n\n16.5.2011 a notice of arbitration was issued by the petitioner to the\n\nrespondent in regard to the payment of compensation for losses\n\nsuffered due to abnormal delays and additional costs as a result of\n\nhindrances caused by the respondent. A three-member Arbitral\n\nTribunal was constituted as per clause 67.3 of the agreement which\n\nultimately culminated into a unanimous Award at New Delhi under\n\nwhich the claims of the petitioner aggregating to INR\n\n424,81,54,096.29 were allowed, together with simple interest at 14%\n\np.a. till the date of actual payment. On 3rd January, 2017, the\n\nrespondent filed an application under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\n\nAct, seeking to set aside the Award before the Court of the District\n\nand Sessions Judge, Faridabad, Haryana. On 28th April, 2017, the\n\npetitioner filed an application under Section 151 read with\nOrder VII\n\nRule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 and\nSection 2(1)(e)(i)\nof\n\nPage 27 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nthe\nArbitration Act\n, seeking a return of the petition for presentation\n\nbefore the appropriate Court at New Delhi and/or the District Judge\n\nat Dhemaji, Assam. In November 2017, after the constitution of a\n\nSpecial Commercial Court at Gurugram, the\nSection 34\npetition filed\n\nat Faridabad was transferred to the said Gurugram Commercial\n\nCourt and numbered as Arbitration Case No. 74 (CIS\n\nNo.ARB/118/2017). On 21st December, 2017, the Special Commercial\n\nCourt, Gurugram allowed the application of the petitioner and\n\nreturned the\nSection 34\npetition for presentation to the proper court\n\nhaving jurisdiction at New Delhi. Being aggrieved by that order, the\n\nrespondent filed an appeal under\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nbefore the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. The\n\nPunjab and Haryana, High Court, inter alia, held that Delhi, being a\n\nconvenient venue where the arbitral proceedings were held and not\n\nthe \"seat\" of the arbitration proceedings, Faridabad, would have\n\nterritorial jurisdiction on the basis of the cause of action having\n\narisen in part in Faridabad and as a result the appeal was allowed and\n\nthe judgment of the Special Commercial Court, Gurugram was set\n\naside. It was this order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court that\n\nwas assailed before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court allowed\n\nthe appeal and set aside the impugned judgment passed by the Punjab\n\nPage 28 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nand Haryana High Court. The argument canvassed before the\n\nSupreme Court in support of the Punjab and Haryana High Court\n\ndecision was that the arbitration clause did not expressly state that\n\neither New Delhi or Faridabad was to be the \"seat\" of the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, and therefore, the arbitration clause only referred to a\n\nconvenient venue, and the fact that the sittings were held at New\n\nDelhi would not, therefore, make New Delhi the \"seat\" of the\n\narbitration under\nSection 20(1)\nof the Arbitration Act. Since the\n\nagreements were signed in Faridabad, and since the notices were sent\n\nby the petitioners to the respondent's office, part of the cause of\n\naction clearly arose in Faridabad as a result of which the Courts in\n\nFaridabad would be clothed with jurisdiction to decide the\nSection 34\n\napplication. The alternate argument canvassed was that even\n\nassuming that New Delhi was the \"seat\" of arbitration, both New Delhi\n\nand Faridabad would have concurrent jurisdiction, New Delhi being a\n\nneutral forum at which no part of the cause of action arose, and\n\nFaridabad being a chosen forum where a part of the cause of action\n\nhad arisen. When read with\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act, since\n\nthe Court at Faridabad was first approached by filing an application\n\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, that Court would alone have\n\njurisdiction, was the argument. The facts and the arguments\n\nPage 29 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\ncanvassed in this case would reveal that the issue of jurisdiction was\n\nraised at the very first instance and which was upheld by the Special\n\nCommercial Court, Gurugram and set aside by the Punjab and\n\nHaryana High Court. The argument that was canvassed and rejected\n\nby the Supreme Court was that since Faridabad Court was\n\napproached first, it would have jurisdiction by virtue of\nSection 42\nof\n\nthe Arbitration Act. This was negated by the Supreme Court by\n\nholding that Faridabad did not have jurisdiction considering that the\n\n\"seat\" of the arbitration was at New Delhi. It is in this light and in this\n\nfactual scenario that one has to read the findings given by the\n\nSupreme Court in paragraph 59. It was not a case where no issue\n\nregarding jurisdiction was raised in the first instance and was\n\nthereafter raised in a subsequent application, as is the case before me.\n\nFor ready reference, paragraph 59 is reproduced hereunder:-\n\n\"59. Equally incorrect is the finding in\nAntrix Corpn. Ltd. [Antrix Corpn.\nLtd. v. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd.\n, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 9338] that\n\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 would be rendered ineffective\nand useless.\nSection 42\nis meant to avoid conflicts in jurisdiction of\ncourts by placing the supervisory jurisdiction over all arbitral\nproceedings in connection with the arbitration in one court exclusively.\nThis is why the section begins with a non obstante clause, and then\ngoes on to state \"...where with respect to an arbitration agreement any\napplication under this part has been made in a court...\" It is obvious that\nthe application made under this part to a court must be a court which\nhas jurisdiction to decide such application. The subsequent holdings\nof this court, that where a seat is designated in an agreement, the\n\nPage 30 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\ncourts of the seat alone have jurisdiction, would require that all\napplications under Part I be made only in the court where the seat is\nlocated, and that court alone then has jurisdiction over the arbitral\nproceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of the arbitral\nagreement. So read,\nSection 42\nis not rendered ineffective or useless.\nAlso, where it is found on the facts of a particular case that either no\n\"seat\" is designated by agreement, or the so-called \"seat\" is only a\nconvenient \"venue\", then there may be several courts where a part of\nthe cause of action arises that may have jurisdiction. Again, an\napplication under\nSection 9\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 may be\npreferred before a court in which part of the cause of action arises in a\ncase where parties have not agreed on the \"seat\" of arbitration, and\nbefore such \"seat\" may have been determined, on the facts of a\nparticular case, by the Arbitral Tribunal under\nSection 20(2)\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1996. In both these situations, the earliest application\nhaving been made to a court in which a part of the cause of action\narises would then be the exclusive court under\nSection 42\n, which would\nhave control over the arbitral proceedings. For all these reasons, the\nlaw stated by the Bombay and Delhi High Courts in this regard is\nincorrect and is overruled.\"\n\n25. One must not lose sight of the fact that these observations\n\ncannot be viewed divorced from the facts of the case and the\n\narguments canvassed by the parties. The facts of our case are wholly\n\ndifferent. As mentioned earlier, the issue of territorial jurisdiction\n\nof this Court was never raised by respondent No.1 when the earlier\n\nSection 34\npetition was filed in this Court. In fact, respondent No.1\n\naccepted the order passed by this Court and proceeded to initiate\n\nfresh arbitration proceedings. This being the case, I find that the\n\nfactual situation before me is totally different from the one in the case\n\nPage 31 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nof\nSoma JV\n(supra), and therefore, has no application over here.\n\n26. It is now a well settled proposition that the ratio of any\n\ndecision must be understood in the background of the facts of that\n\ncase. It has been said a long time ago that a case is only an authority\n\nfor what it actually decides and not what logically follows from it. The\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nSarva Shramik Sanghatana (KV\n)\n\n(supra) has succinctly set out this proposition in paragraphs 14 to\n\n18 which read thus:-\n\n\"14. On the subject of precedents Lord Halsbury, L.C., said\nin Quinn v. Leathem [1901 AC 495 : (1900-1903) All ER Rep 1 (HL)] : (All ER\np. 7 G-I)\n\"Before discussing Allen v. Flood [1898 AC 1 : (1895-1899) All ER Rep\n52 (HL)] and what was decided therein, there are two observations\nof a general character which I wish to make; and one is to repeat\nwhat I have very often said before--that every judgment must be\nread as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be\nproved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found\nthere are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but are\ngoverned and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which\nsuch expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an\nauthority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be\nquoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.\nSuch a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a\nlogical code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law\nis not always logical at all.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nWe entirely agree with the above observations.\n\nPage 32 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\n15.\nIn\nAmbica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat\n[(1987) 1 SCC 213] (vide\nSCC p. 221, para 18) this Court observed:\n\n\"18. The ratio of any decision must be understood in the\nbackground of the facts of that case. It has been said long time ago\nthat a case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not\nwhat logically follows from it.\"\n\n16.\nIn\nBhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd.\n[(2003) 2 SCC\n111] (vide SCC p. 130, para 59) this Court observed:\n\n\"59. ... It is also well settled that a little difference in facts or\nadditional facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential value\nof a decision.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n17. As held in\nBharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. N.R. Vairamani\n[(2004) 8 SCC\n579 : AIR 2004 SC 4778] a decision cannot be relied on without disclosing\nthe factual situation. In the same judgment this Court also observed: (SCC\npp. 584-85, paras 9-12)\n\n\"9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing\nas to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the\ndecision on which reliance is placed. Observations of courts are\nneither to be read as Euclid's theorems nor as provisions of a statute\nand that too taken out of their context. These observations must be\nread in the context in which they appear to have been stated.\nJudgments of courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret\nwords, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary\nfor judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is\nmeant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they\ndo not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their\nwords are not to be interpreted as statutes.\nIn London Graving Dock\nCo. Ltd. v. Horton [1951 AC 737 : (1951) 2 All ER 1 (HL)] (AC at p. 761),\nLord MacDermott observed: (All ER p. 14 C-D)\n'The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by treating\nthe ipsissima verba of Willes, J. as though they were part of\nan Act of Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation\nappropriate thereto. This is not to detract from the great\n\nPage 33 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nweight to be given to the language actually used by that\nmost distinguished Judge, ...'\n\n10. In Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd. [1970 AC 1004 : (1970) 2\nWLR 1140 : (1970) 2 All ER 294 (HL)] Lord Reid said,\n'Lord Atkin's speech ... is not to be treated as if it were a\nstatutory definition. It will require qualification in new\ncircumstances.' (All ER p. 297g)\nMegarry, J. in Shepherd Homes Ltd. v. Sandham (No. 2) [(1971) 1\nWLR 1062 : (1971) 2 All ER 1267] , observed: (All ER p. 1274d)\n'One must not, of course, construe even a reserved judgment\nof even Russell, L.J. as if it were an Act of Parliament;'\nAnd, in British Railways Board v. Herrington [1972 AC 877 : (1972)\n2 WLR 537 : (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)] Lord Morris said: (All ER p.\n761c)\n'There is always peril in treating the words of a speech or a\njudgment as though they were words in a legislative\nenactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial\nutterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular\ncase.'\n\n11. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact may\nmake a world of difference between conclusions in two cases.\nDisposal of cases by blindly placing reliance on a decision is not\nproper.\n\n12. The following words of Hidayatullah, J. in the matter of applying\nprecedents have become locus classicus: (\nAbdul Kayoom v. CIT\n[AIR\n1962 SC 680] , AIR p. 688, para 19)\n\n'19. ... Each case depends on its own facts and a close\nsimilarity between one case and another is not enough\nbecause even a single significant detail may alter the entire\n\nPage 34 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\naspect, in deciding such cases, one should avoid the\ntemptation to decide cases (as said by Cardozo) by matching\nthe colour of one case against the colour of another. To\ndecide therefore, on which side of the line a case falls, the\nbroad resemblance to another case is not at all decisive.'\n***\n'Precedent should be followed only so far as it marks the path\nof justice, but you must cut the dead wood and trim off the side\nbranches else you will find yourself lost in thickets and\nbranches. My plea is to keep the path to justice clear of\nobstructions which could impede it.' \"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n18. We have referred to the aforesaid decisions and the principles laid\ndown therein, because often decisions are cited for a proposition without\nreading the entire decision and the reasoning contained therein. In our\nopinion, the decision of this Court in Sarguja Transport case [(1987) 1 SCC\n5 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 19 : AIR 1987 SC 88] cannot be treated as a Euclid's\nformula.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n27.\nIn these circumstances, I find that the reliance placed by\n\nMr. Kanade on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\nSoma\n\nJV\n(supra) is wholly misplaced and does not carry his case any\n\nfurther.\n\n28. Even the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nState of West Bengal & Ors. Vs Associated Contractors\n(supra)\n\nPage 35 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\ndoes not support the case of respondent No.1. The facts of this case\n\nreveal that in 1995-1996 an item rate tender was duly executed and\n\nsigned between the respondent - Associated Contractors and the\n\nSuperintending Engineer concerned for execution of the work of\n\nexcavation and lining of Teesta-Jaldhaka Main Canal from Chainage\n\n3 k.m. to 3.625 k.m. in Police Station Mal, District Jalpaiguri, West\n\nBengal. Paragraph 25 of the said item rate tender and the contract\n\ncontained an arbitration clause. The respondent filed an application\n\nunder\nSection 9\nof the Arbitration Act, seeking interim orders in the\n\nHigh Court of Calcutta. The Calcutta High Court, after granting leave\n\nunder Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, passed an ad-interim ex-parte\n\ninjunction order. This order was continued from time to time until it\n\nwas confirmed by an order dated 10th December, 1998. From the\n\naforesaid order, an appeal was filed and in the appeal the interim\n\norder dated 10th December, 1998 was stayed. The Arbitrator was,\n\nhowever, asked to complete the proceedings before him which would\n\ngo on uninterrupted. In the meanwhile, several orders were passed\n\nby the High Court regarding the remuneration of the Arbitrator and\n\npayment of the same. Finally, the arbitration proceedings culminated\n\nin an Award dated 30th June, 2004. On 21st September, 2004, the\n\nState of West Bengal filed an application under\nSection 34\nof the\n\nPage 36 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nArbitration Act\nto set aside the Arbitral Award before the Principal\n\nCivil Court of the learned District Judge at Jalpaiguri, West Bengal.\n\nOn 10th December, 2004 the respondent filed an application under\n\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India challenging the jurisdiction of\n\nthe District Court at Jalpaiguri. By the impugned judgment dated\n\n11th April, 2005, a Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court allowed\n\nthe petition under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India inter alia\n\nholding that since the parties had already submitted to the\n\njurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court in its ordinary original civil\n\njurisdiction in connection with which earlier proceedings had arisen\n\nout of the said contract, the jurisdiction of the Court of the learned\n\nDistrict Judge at Jalpaiguri to entertain the\nSection 34\napplication\n\nfor setting aside the award, was specifically excluded under\nSection\nof the Arbitration Act. It was this order that was assailed before\n\nthe Supreme Court. The argument canvassed before the Supreme\n\nCourt by the State of West Bengal was that the application made\n\nunder\nSection 9\nof the Arbitration Act before the Calcutta High Court,\n\nwas itself without jurisdiction and hence\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration\n\nAct would not be attracted. It was argued that the reason for the\n\nDivision Bench to stay the interim order passed under\nSection 9\nof\n\nthe Arbitration Act, was because it was convinced prima facie that\n\nPage 37 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nthe High Court had no jurisdiction in the matter. Whilst negating this\n\ncontention, the Supreme Court in paragraphs 25 & 26 inter alia held\n\nas under:-\n\n\"25. Our conclusions therefore on\nSection 2(1)(e)\nand\nSection 42\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1996 are as follows:\n\n(a)\nSection 2(1)(e)\ncontains an exhaustive definition marking out\nonly the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction in a district\nor a High Court having original civil jurisdiction in the State, and\nno other court as \"court\" for the purpose of\nPart I of the\nArbitration Act, 1996\n.\n\n(b) The expression \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\"\n\nmakes it clear that\nSection 42\nwill apply to all applications made\nwhether before or during arbitral proceedings or after an award\nis pronounced under Part I of the 1996 Act.\n\n(c) However,\nSection 42\nonly applies to applications made under\nPart I if they are made to a court as defined. Since applications\nmade under\nSection 8\nare made to judicial authorities and since\napplications under\nSection 11\nare made to the Chief Justice or\nhis designate, the judicial authority and the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate not being court as defined, such applications would\nbe outside\nSection 42\n.\n\n(d)\nSection 9\napplications being applications made to a court\nand\nSection 34\napplications to set aside arbitral awards are\napplications which are within\nSection 42\n.\n\n(e) In no circumstances can the Supreme Court be \"court\" for\nthe purposes of Section 2(1)(e), and whether the Supreme Court\ndoes or does not retain seisin after appointing an arbitrator,\n\nPage 38 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\napplications will follow the first application made before either\na High Court having original jurisdiction in the State or a\nPrincipal Civil Court having original jurisdiction in the district, as\nthe case may be.\n\n(f) Section 42 will apply to applications made after the arbitral\nproceedings have come to an end provided they are made\nunder Part I.\n\n(g) If a first application is made to a court which is neither a\nPrincipal Court of Original Jurisdiction in a district or a High\nCourt exercising original jurisdiction in a State, such application\nnot being to a court as defined would be outside\nSection 42\n.\nAlso, an application made to a court without subject-matter\njurisdiction would be outside\nSection 42\n.\n\nThe reference is answered accordingly.\n\n26. On the facts of the present case, nothing has been shown as to\nhow the High Court of Calcutta does not possess jurisdiction. It has\nbeen mentioned above that leave under Clause 12 has been granted.\nIn the circumstances of the present case, therefore, the judgment\ndated 11-4-2005 passed by the High Court of Calcutta is correct and\ndoes not need any interference. Civil Appeal No. 6691 of 2005 and Civil\nAppeal No. 4808 of 2013 are hereby dismissed.\"\n\n29. I fail to see how this decision supports the case of\n\nrespondent No.1. In fact, this decision categorically holds that the\n\nexpression \"with respect to the Arbitration Agreement\" makes it\n\nclear that\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act will apply to all\n\napplications made before or during the arbitral proceedings or after\n\nan Award is pronounced under\nPart I of the Arbitration Act\n. It further\n\nPage 39 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nholds that if the first application is made to a Court which is neither\n\nthe Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, or a High\n\nCourt exercising original jurisdiction, such an application not being\n\nto a Court as defined, would be outside the purview of\nSection 42\n. Also\n\nan application made to a Court without subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nwould be outside the purview of\nSection 42\n. In the facts of the present\n\ncase, the first application was made before this Court under\nSection\nof the Arbitration Act challenging the First Arbitral Award dated\n\n30th January, 2013. It is not as if this Court whilst entertaining the\n\nsaid petition was not the High Court exercising original jurisdiction\n\nor did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain the said\n\npetition. If at all, it did not have territorial jurisdiction and which was\n\nwaived by respondent No.1 as discussed earlier. This being the case, I\n\nfind that the reliance placed by respondent No.1 on this decision also\n\nis wholly misplaced.\n\n30. For all the aforesaid reasons I hold that this Court has\n\njurisdiction to entertain the above\nSection 34\nPetition. It is\n\naccordingly listed for admission on 6th April, 2021.\n\n31. This order shall be digitally signed by the Private\n\nPage 40 of 41\n\ncarbpl.1444.2019.docx\n\nSecretory /Personal Assistant of this Court. All concerned shall act\n\non production by fax or e-mail of a digitally signed copy of this order.\n\n(B. P. COLABAWALLA, J. )\n\nPage 41 of 41",
