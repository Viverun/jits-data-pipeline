No.180/2022 registered at Police Station Bhadesar, District\n\nChittorgarh for the offences under\nSections 8\n/\nand\n/\nof the\n\nNDPS Act.\n\nHeard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Public\n\nProsecutor. Perused the material available on record.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner submitted that as per\n\nprosecution, on 08.11.2022, the SHO, Police Station Bhadesar,\n\nDistrict Chittorgarh flagged down a car bearing registration\n\nNo.GJ08-BS-6609. Learned counsel further submitted that two\n\npersons were sitting in the car, who on seeing the police party,\n\ntried to flee away from the spot. Learned counsel submitted that\n\nas per prosecution, one person namely Narayan S/o Shankar Lal\n\n(Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:32963] (2 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\nJat was apprehended by the police on the spot however, the\n\npetitioner was successful in fleeing away from the place. Learned\n\ncounsel submitted that after observing mandatory formalities, the\n\npolice team recovered contraband (poppy husk/poppy straw)\n\nweighing 134 kg. from the offending vehicle.\n\nLearned counsel submitted that the petitioner has been\n\nfalsely roped in the present case. Learned counsel submitted that\n\nrecovery of contraband was made on 08.11.2022, the sample of\n\ncontraband were sent to the FSL only on 15.11.2022 i.e. after\n\nseven days of the alleged recovery; that the samples have been\n\nsent to the FSL after 72 hours of the seizure, whereas as per\n\nClause 13 of Standing Order No.01/88 issued by the Narcotic\n\nControl Bureau, the samples are required to be sent for FSL\n\nexamination within 72 hours of the seizure. It was submitted that\n\nin the present case, the samples were sent beyond the 72 hours\n\nperiod and thus, the possibility of samples being tampered with\n\ncannot be ruled out. Learned counsel submitted that co-accused -\n\nNarayan S/o Shankar Lal Jat who was arrested by police on the\n\nspot has already been enlarged on bail by a co-ordinate Bench of\n\nthis Court vide order dated 22.06.2023. Learned counsel\n\nsubmitted that the case of the present petitioner is not\n\ndistinguishable from that of the co-accused - Narayan S/o\n\nShankar Lal Jat who has already been enlarged on bail.\n\nLearned counsel submitted that the petitioner was not\n\narrested on the spot and the contraband greater than was not\n\nrecovered from conscious possession of the petitioner; challan\n\nagainst the petitioner has already been filed; the petitioner is in\n\n(Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:32963] (3 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\njudicial custody and the trial of the case will take sufficiently long\n\ntime.\n\nOn these grounds, he implored the court to enlarge the\n\npetitioner on bail.\n\nThe order dated 22.06.2023 passed in S.B. Criminal Misc.\n\nBail Application No.7644/2023 is reproduced for ready reference:\n\n\"1. The prayer made in this bail petition filed under\nSection\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short \"the\nCode\") is for grant of bail in connection with crime\nregistered pursuant to First Information Report Number\n180/2022 of Police Station Bhadesar, District Chittorgarh in\nrespect of offence(s) punishable under Section(s) 8 / 1 5 a\nn d 2 9 o f t h e Narcotic Drugs and Psy-chotropic\nSubstances Act (hereinafter to be referred as \"the\nNDPS\nAct\n\").\n\n2. Heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel for\nthe applicant, learned public prosecutor and carefully\nperused the en-tire material available in case diary.\n\n3. The accusation against the petitioner-accused is that\nS.H.O. Shankar Lal Rao of Police Station Bhadesar, District\nChittorgarh, on 08.11.2022 along with other police officials\nwas on patrol duty for checking crimes at the road leading\nfrom Bhadesar to Mandfiya. A check post was set-up\nbesides the road. It is alleged that at about 01.30 PM, a car\nbearing registration number GJ-08-BS-6609 came at a very\nhigh speed which was stopped, in which 2 persons were\naboard. Seeing the police party, the driver tried to reverse\nthe car but failed. He got down from the car and fled away.\nThe other person in the car was apprehended, on being\nasked the name and address, he disclosed his name as\nNarayan s/o Shankarlal and the name of the fleeing person\nas Narayan s/o Dayaram. After due formalities, the police\nteam proceeded to search the vehicle from which, 134 Kgs.\nof poppy-straw was recovered.\n\n4. After investigation, charge-sheet was filed against\npetitioner-accused and investigation has been kept pending\n\n(Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:32963] (4 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\nagainst other co-accused Narayan s/o Dayaram and Ratan\nLal under section 173(8) of the criminal Procedure Code.\n\n5. Petitioner Narayan S/o Shanker Lal Jat was arrested on\n08.11.2022 since then, he is in custody and has\napproached thisCourt by way of this application for bail\npreferred under\nSection439\nCr.P.C.\n\n6. Learned counsel appearing for the accused has argued\nthat there was delay in sending the samples of alleged\ncontraband to the laboratory. As per record of the charge-\nsheet, the recovery of the poppy-straw was made on\n08.11.2022 and the packets of sample were received in the\nlaboratory only on 15.11.2022 i.e. af-ter 7 days of the\nalleged recovery; that the samples have been sent to the\nFSL after 72 hours of the seizure whereas as per Clause 13\nof Standing Order No. 01/88 issued by the Narcotic Control\nBureau, the samples were required to be sent to FSL for\ntesting within 72 hours of seizure to maintain the reliability\nof the samples. In the present case, the said mandatory\ndirection has not been complied with, therefore, the\npossibility of tampering with the samples cannot be ruled\nout. It is further contended that there is no such document\non the record that can explain the rea-sons for this delay,\ntherefore, the possibility of change in the sam-ple cannot\nbe ruled out. It is further submitted that investigation is\ncomplete and the petitioner has already been in custody\nsince 08.11.2022. There is no other case against the\npetitioner. Reliance has been placed on the decision of\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh vs. Hansraj @ Hansu\n2019 (1) CJ\n(Cri.) 93 rendered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the State has opposed the grant of\nbail but he is not in a position to controvert the above\nmentioned date of recovery of contraband and date of\nreceipt issued by the FSL. It is argued that the petitioner is\ninvolved in drug peddling. The re-covery from him is of\ncommercial quantity and the bar as con-tained in\nSection\nof the NDPS Act is attracted. He thus craves rejection of\nthe petitioner's bail application.\n\n8. The petitioner has been in custody for sufficient period.\nAfter completion of investigation, the charge sheet has\n\n(Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:32963] (5 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\nalready been filed. Trial is likely to consume time and no\nuseful purpose would be served by keeping him in\ndetention for an indefinite period. The petitioner is not\ninvolved in any other case under the\nNDPS Act\n. The point\nraised regarding delay in sending the sample to FSL and its\nconsequences is a matter of trial. However, in the present\ncase sufficient mitigating circumstances are made out to\nextend the concession of bail to the petitioner in view of\ndecision of\nState ofUttar Pradesh vs. Hansraj @ Hansu\n\nreported in 2019 (1) CJ (Cri.)93.\n\n9. Keeping in view the above facts and without commenting\nupon the merits of the case, this Court feels that the\naccused has available to him, substantial ground so as to\nquestion the case of the prosecution and restriction\nimposed by\nSection 37\nof the NDPS Act are duly satisfied.\nTherefore, I deem this to be a fit case for grant of regular\nbail to the petitioner.\n\n10. Consequently, the present bail application is allowed\nand it is directed that the accused-petitioner Narayan S/o\nShankar Lal Jat, arrested in connection with the F.I.R. No.\n180/2022, registered at Police Station Bhadesar, District\nChitrtograrh shall be released on bail provided he furnishes\na personal bond and two surety bonds of sufficient amount\nto the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the\nstipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of\nhearing and as and when called upon to do so. This order is\nsub-ject to the condition that accused, within 7 days of his\nrelease and sureties, on the day of furnishing bail, will also\nfurnish details of their all bank accounts, with bank and\nbranch name, in shape of an affidavit, and submit legible\ncopy of their Aadhar cards as well as front page of Bank\npass book, for smooth recovery of penalty amount, if there\narise a need for recovery of penalty under Sec-tion 446\n\nCr.P.C\nin future.\"\n\nPer contra, learned Public Prosecutor has vehemently\n\nopposed the bail application. However, he was not in a position to\n\nrefute the fact that above-named co-accused person has already\n\n(Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:32963] (6 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\nbeen enlarged on bail by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide\n\norder dated 22.06.2023.\n\nHaving considered the rival submissions, facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, so also the fact that above-named co-\n\naccused person has already been enlarged on bail by a co-ordinate\n\nBench of this Court vide order dated 22.06.2023, this Court\n\nwithout expressing any opinion on merits/demerits of the case\n\ndeems it just and proper to enlarge the petitioner on bail.\n\nConsequently, the bail application under\nSection 439\nCr.P.C.\n\nis allowed. It is ordered that the accused-petitioner - Narain Lal\n\nS/o Daya Ram Jat arrested in connection with F.I.R.\n\nNo.180/2022 registered at Police Station Bhadesar, District\n\nChittorgarh shall be released on bail, if not wanted in any other\n\ncase, provided he furnishes a personal bond of Rs.1,00,000/- and\n\ntwo sureties of Rs.50,000/- each, to the satisfaction of learned\n\ntrial court, for his appearance before that court on each & every\n\ndate of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till completion\n\nof the trial.\n\n(KULDEEP MATHUR),J\n868-Ravi Khandelwal\n\n(Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
