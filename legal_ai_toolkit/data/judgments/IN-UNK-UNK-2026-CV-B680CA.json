Appellant\n\n Versus\n\n State of Madhya Pradesh .... Respondent\n\n with\n\n Criminal Appeal No. 1456 of 2015\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n Sanjay Kumar, J\n\n 1. Bhawna, the second respondent in Criminal Appeal No. 1456 of\n\n 2015, married Nimish Gour in the year 2007. He, however, secured a decree\n\n of divorce on 05.09.2019 dissolving their marriage. Bhawna preferred First\n\n Appeal No. 1876 of 2019 against the said divorce decree and the same is\n\n stated to be pending consideration before the Madhya Pradesh High Court.\n\n Signature Not Verified\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n NIRMALA NEGI\n\n Date: 2023.08.31\n\n 17:02:22 IST\n\n The appellants in the present appeals were Bhawna’s in-laws. Kusum Lata\n Reason:\n\n was her mother-in-law while Abhishek and Sourabh were her brothers-in-law.\n\n\f 2\n\n2. Bhawna married Nimish on 02.07.2007. Their marriage was an\n\narranged one and was performed at Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Bhawna was a\n\nteacher by profession. Nimish was working in the film industry at Mumbai and\n\nwas engaged in film editing. After their marriage, the couple left for Mumbai\n\non 08.07.2007. Bhawna is stated to have visited her in-laws in Madhya\n\nPradesh on 3 or 4 occasions only, including the Deepavali festival in 2008.\n\nAdmittedly, Bhawna parted ways with her matrimonial home at Mumbai on\n\n25.02.2009, be it on her own volition or otherwise, and started residing with\n\nher parents at Narsinghpur. At that time, Kusum Lata had submitted\n\nrepresentation dated 24.02.2009 to Police Station Heera Nagar at Indore,\n\napprehending that Bhawna may make allegations against them about\n\nharassing her for dowry.\n\n3. Prior to the filing of the divorce petition by Nimish on 08.05.2013,\n\nBhawna made a written complaint on 05.02.2013 to Police Station Kotwali,\n\nDistrict Narsinghpur, levelling several allegations against her husband and\n\nher in-laws. The same was sent to the jurisdictional police station at Heera\n\nNagar, Indore. In consequence, FIR No. 56 of 2013 dated 09.02.2013 was\n\nregistered on the file of P.S. Heera Nagar, Indore, against all four of them\n\nunder \nSection 498A\n IPC and \nSections 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act,\n\n1961. All three appellants secured anticipatory bail on 06.03.2013 in relation\n\n\f 3\n\nto FIR No. 56 dated 09.02.2013 from the learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\nIndore, vide Bail Application No. 634 of 2013.\n\n4. The appellants then moved the Madhya Pradesh High Court\n\nunder \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. Kusum Lata and Sourabh filed M.Cr.C. No. 6585 of\n\n2013 while M.Cr.C. No. 2647 of 2014 was filed by Abhishek, praying for\n\nquashing of FIR No. 56 of 2013 dated 09.02.2013 insofar as they were\n\nconcerned. During the pendency of these cases, the police completed their\n\ninvestigation and filed a charge sheet against all the four accused. The same\n\nwas taken on file in Criminal Case No. 11954 of 2014 by the learned Judicial\n\nMagistrate First Class, Indore. Thereupon, Kusum Lata and Sourabh filed an\n\napplication on 13.08.2014 in M.Cr.C. No. 6585 of 2013 laying a challenge to\n\nthe charge sheet and the proceedings in Criminal Case No. 11954 of 2014.\n\nHowever, by separate orders dated 03.03.2015, the Madhya Pradesh High\n\nCourt dismissed both the quash petitions. Aggrieved thereby, the appellants\n\nare before this Court by way of these appeals by special leave.\n\n5. By common order dated 30.10.2015 passed in both the appeals,\n\nthis Court stayed further proceedings qua the appellants.\n\n6. In her written complaint dated 05.02.2013 made to P.S. Kotwali,\n\nDistrict Narsinghpur, Bhawna spoke of her marriage being solemnized with\n\nNimish on 02.07.2007 at Indore and stated that her parents had given\n\n₹.3,50,000/- in cash, one gold necklace, ear-set, anklets of silver, Bichua\n\n\f 4\n\n(toe-rings), costly sarees and clothes. She further stated that her relatives\n\nhad separately given her a gold chain, Nath, Bindi etc., several jewellery\n\nitems and other gifts. She alleged that her mother-in-law and brother-in-law,\n\nAbhishek, got a list prepared of all the gifts and took the same, saying: ‘Bhabi,\n\nwe will keep them in a Bank Locker as you do not have a house in Mumbai\n\nand you will not be able to keep them’. She stated that she went to Mumbai\n\nalong with her husband on 08.07.2007. She made several allegations about\n\nhow she was ill-treated by her husband at Mumbai. Those allegations are of\n\nno relevance presently, as we are not concerned with Nimish. Bhawna went\n\non to state that her husband and mother-in-law had complaints with her and\n\nher parents on the issue of dowry and that they started harassing her\n\nmentally even on minor issues and started using wrong and intolerable words\n\nfor her parents, brothers and sister. She stated that, one day, she was\n\nwearing a maxi while applying mehendi to her hair and upon seeing this, her\n\nmother-in-law said - Bhawna is wearing a maxi so she should be undressed\n\nand made to dance on the street. She alleged that her mother-in-law made a\n\ndemand for a gold chain, ear-rings, ring and other gold jewellery in dowry at\n\nthe time of the marriage. She also alleged that at the time of his own\n\nmarriage, her brother-in-law, Abhishek, demanded a car and additional two\n\nlakh rupees from her and her parents. They did not have so much money and\n\ncould not give a car and ₹.2,00,000/- and her in-laws said that if you cannot\n\n\f 5\n\nbring the money then live in your parental house. She further stated that her\n\nmother-in-law’s house at Indore was like a paying guest accommodation,\n\nwhere one or the other student was always living, and there was no room for\n\nher to stay. She alleged that they treated her also like a paying guest and\n\nharassed her physically, mentally, socially and emotionally with their demands\n\nfor dowry. She then spoke of how she found her husband’s diary at Mumbai in\n\nwhich he had mentioned details of his physical relations with several other\n\nwomen and when she narrated the same to her mother-in-law and\n\nbrother-in-law at the time of Deepavali in 2008, they said that she had spoilt\n\nthe festival by telling such things and that she should never come on\n\nDeepavali day. She stated that she was thrown out of the house by her\n\nhusband on 25.02.2009. She further stated that upon her many requests,\n\nNimish came to the marriage of her brother on 17.06.2012, but again asked\n\nher about the arrangement for money. Upon being told of their inability to\n\narrange money, he told her relatives either to fulfil the demand for money or\n\nget him freed from her. She said that her father, mother and brother\n\ndeveloped health problems owing to these issues and requested that strict\n\nlegal action be taken against Nimish, Kusum Lata, Sourabh and Abhishek, for\n\nharassing her mentally and physically for dowry and to do her justice.\n\n7. In her statement dated 08.09.2013 made before P.S. Heera\n\nNagar, Bhawna stated that her marriage with Nimish was performed on\n\n\f 6\n\n02.07.2007 at Nandan Garden in Indore and her parents had given gold and\n\nsilver jewellery, clothes, cash etc., exceeding their status and spent about ₹ 5\n\nlakhs for the marriage. She said that her husband and she went to Mumbai\n\non 07.07.2007. She made various allegations against her husband which are\n\nof no significance presently, as he is not before us. As regards her in-laws,\n\nshe said that her mother-in-law, Kusum Lata, and brothers-in-law, Abhishek\n\nand Sourabh, used to harass her mentally and physically to bring ₹.2 lakhs in\n\ncash, a car and jewellery in dowry from her parents and due to this, her\n\nparents fell ill and were being treated. She alleged that all her in-laws wanted\n\na divorce from her forcibly and nobody wanted to talk to her after she came\n\naway from her matrimonial home. She alleged that Abhishek, who was a\n\njudge, was misusing his official position and he was the reason for\n\nobstructions in legal proceedings.\n\n8. Om Prakash, Bhawna’s father, also made a statement before the\n\npolice on 08.09.2013 on the same lines. He said that her marriage was\n\nperformed at Indore on 02.07.2007 and as per his status, he had given cash,\n\ngold, jewellery, clothes etc., totalling to ₹.5 lakhs, in dowry. He said that,\n\nwhenever Bhawna came to meet them, she used to tell him and all the\n\nneighbours that her husband, Nimish, mother-in-law, Kusum Lata, and\n\nbrothers-in-law, Abhishek and Sourabh, used to tell her that her father had\n\ngiven nothing in dowry and when she went to her parental home, she should\n\n\f 7\n\nbring ₹.2 lakhs in cash, a car and gold jewellery. He stated that they had been\n\nharassing his daughter mentally and physically for dowry. He alleged that, on\n\nKarvachauth day, Bhawna’s mother-in-law had demanded 100 sarees but he\n\nhad refused. Renubala, Bhawna’s mother, also made a statement on\n\n08.09.2013 on identical lines. Two of their neighbours, Sushila Bai and\n\nMohan, also gave statements on the same day, supporting Bhawna’s version.\n\nAccording to them, whenever Bhawna came to meet her parents, she used to\n\ntell them that her in-laws were torturing her mentally and physically for dowry.\n\nOn the other hand, Shailendra and Radhey Shyam, who lived in the\n\nneighbourhood where Nimish’s father had his residence, stated to the effect\n\nthat there were no demands made of Bhawna or her family for dowry and that\n\nshe was never harassed on that ground. In their final report dated\n\n20.09.2013, the police merely replicated the contents of the FIR and added\n\nnothing further on the strength of their investigation.\n\n9. Certain other facts are also of pertinence and may be noted.\n\nAbhishek entered judicial service as a Civil Judge six or seven months after\n\nthe marriage of Bhawna with Nimish. He was posted at Ujjain and, thereafter,\n\nat Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh. Kusum Lata used to reside with Abhishek.\n\nSaurabh, Bhawna’s other brother-in-law, is an architect and was working at\n\nDelhi since the year 2007. Nimish made written representations to the police\n\nauthorities at Narsinghpur on 09.09.2012 and 17.11.2012 complaining of\n\n\f 8\n\nintimidation by and at the behest of Bhawna. Prior thereto, an anonymous\n\ncomplaint was made to the Chief Justice, Madhya Pradesh High Court,\n\nagainst Abhishek, making scandalous allegations to the effect that he was\n\nundeserving of judicial office. A complaint was also made to the\n\nAnti-Corruption Bureau, Mumbai, purportedly in the name of one Sanyogita\n\nMishra. Again, the allegations therein were directed against Abhishek.\n\n10. Notably, the examination-in-chief of Bhawna on 27.10.2018 in\n\nNimish’s divorce petition in Civil Suit No. 153A of 2015 on the file of the\n\nFamily Court, Narsinghpur, is made available. Therein, she asserted that her\n\nentire stridhan jewellery was with Nimish and in spite of repeated demands,\n\nhe was not returning it to her as he wanted to snatch her jewellery. Further,\n\nduring her cross-examination therein, she admitted that she had made a\n\ncomplaint to the Madhya Pradesh High Court against Abhishek. She however\n\ndenied making any such complaint to the Anti-Corruption Unit at Mumbai.\n\n11. This being the factual backdrop, we may note at the very outset\n\nthat the contention that the appellants’ quash petition against the FIR was\n\nliable to be dismissed, in any event, as the chargesheet in relation thereto\n\nwas submitted before the Court and taken on file, needs mention only to be\n\nrejected. It is well settled that the High Court would continue to have the\n\npower to entertain and act upon a petition filed under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. to\n\nquash the FIR even when a chargesheet is filed by the police during the\n\n\f 9\n\npendency of such petition [See \nJoseph Salvaraj A. vs. State of Gujarat and\n\nothers\n {(2011) 7 SCC 59}].\n \nThis principle was reiterated in \nAnand Kumar\n\nMohatta and another vs. State (NCT of Delhi), Department of Home and\n\nanother\n [(2019) 11 SCC 706]. This issue, therefore, needs no further\n\nelucidation on our part.\n\n12. The contours of the power to quash criminal proceedings under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. are well defined. \nIn \nV. Ravi Kumar vs. State\n represented\n\nby Inspector of Police, District Crime Branch, Salem, Tamil Nadu and others\n\n[(2019) 14 SCC 568], this Court affirmed that where an accused seeks\n\nquashing of the FIR, invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, it is\n\nwholly impermissible for the High Court to enter into the factual arena to\n\nadjudge the correctness of the allegations in the complaint. In M/s.\n\nNeeharika Infrastructure (P).\n \nLtd. vs. State of Maharashtra and others\n\n[Criminal Appeal No.330 of 2021, decided on 13.04.2021], a 3-Judge\n\nBench of this Court elaborately considered the scope and extent of the power\n\nunder \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. It was observed that the power of quashing should\n\nbe exercised sparingly, with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases,\n\nsuch standard not being confused with the norm formulated in the context of\n\nthe death penalty.\n \nIt was further observed that while examining the\n\nFIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought, the Court cannot embark upon\n\nan enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations\n\n\f 10\n\nmade therein, but if the Court thinks fit, regard being had to the parameters of\n\nquashing and the self-restraint imposed by law, and more particularly, the\n\nparameters \nlaid down by\n this Court in \nR.P. Kapur vs. State of Punjab\n (\nAIR\n\n1960 SC 866) and State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal and others\n\n[(1992) Supp (1) SCC 335], the Court would have jurisdiction to quash the\n\nFIR/complaint.\n\n13. Instances of a husband’s family members filing a petition to quash\n\ncriminal proceedings launched against them by his wife in the midst of\n\nmatrimonial disputes are neither a rarity nor of recent origin. Precedents\n\naplenty abound on this score. We may now take note of some decisions of\n\nparticular relevance. Recently, in Kahkashan Kausar alias \nSonam and others\n\nvs. State of Bihar and others\n [(2022) 6 SCC 599], this Court had occasion\n\nto deal with a similar situation where the High Court had refused to quash a\n\nFIR registered for various offences, including \nSection 498A\n IPC. Noting that\n\nthe foremost issue that required determination was whether allegations made\n\nagainst the in-laws were general omnibus allegations which would be liable to\n\nbe quashed, this Court referred to earlier decisions wherein concern was\n\nexpressed over the misuse of \nSection 498A\n IPC and the increased tendency\n\nto implicate relatives of the husband in matrimonial disputes. This Court\n\nobserved that false implications by way of general omnibus allegations made\n\nin the course of matrimonial disputes, if left unchecked, would result in\n\n\f 11\n\nmisuse of the process of law. On the facts of that case, it was found that no\n\nspecific allegations were made against the in-laws by the wife and it was held\n\nthat allowing their prosecution in the absence of clear allegations against the\n\nin-laws would result in an abuse of the process of law. It was also noted that a\n\ncriminal trial, leading to an eventual acquittal, would inflict severe scars upon\n\nthe accused and such an exercise ought to be discouraged.\n\n14. \nIn \nPreeti Gupta and another vs. State of Jharkhand and\n\nanother\n [(2010) 7 SCC 667], this Court noted that the tendency to implicate\n\nthe husband and all his immediate relations is also not uncommon in\n\ncomplaints filed under \nSection 498A\n IPC. It was observed that the Courts\n\nhave to be extremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints\n\nand must take pragmatic realities into consideration while dealing with\n\nmatrimonial cases, as allegations of harassment by husband’s close\n\nrelations, who were living in different cities and never visited or rarely visited\n\nthe place where the complainant resided, would add an entirely different\n\ncomplexion and such allegations would have to be scrutinised with great care\n\nand circumspection.\n\n15. Earlier, in \nNeelu Chopra and another vs. Bharti\n [(2009) 10 SCC\n\n184], this Court observed that the mere mention of statutory provisions and\n\nthe language thereof, for lodging a complaint, is not the ‘be all and end all’ of\n\nthe matter, as what is required to be brought to the notice of the Court is the\n\n\f 12\n\nparticulars of the offence committed by each and every accused and the role\n\nplayed by each and every accused in the commission of that offence. These\n\nobservations were made in the context of a matrimonial dispute involving\n\nSection 498A\n IPC.\n\n16. Of more recent origin is the decision of this Court in \nMahmood Ali\n\nand others vs. State of U.P. and others\n (Criminal Appeal No. 2341 of\n\n2023, decided on 08.08.2023) on the legal principles applicable apropos\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. Therein, it was observed that when an accused comes\n\nbefore the High Court, invoking either the inherent power under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. or the extraordinary jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution,\n\nto get the FIR or the criminal proceedings quashed, essentially on the ground\n\nthat such proceedings are manifestly frivolous or vexatious or instituted with\n\nthe ulterior motive of wreaking vengeance, then in such circumstances, the\n\nHigh Court owes a duty to look into the FIR with care and a little more closely.\n\nIt was further observed that it will not be enough for the Court to look into the\n\naverments made in the FIR/complaint alone for the purpose of ascertaining\n\nwhether the necessary ingredients to constitute the alleged offence are\n\ndisclosed or not as, in frivolous or vexatious proceedings, the Court owes a\n\nduty to look into many other attending circumstances emerging from the\n\nrecord of the case over and above the averments and, if need be, with due\n\ncare and circumspection, to try and read between the lines.\n\n\f 13\n\n17. \nIn \nBhajan Lal\n (supra), this Court had set out, by way of\n\nillustration, the broad categories of cases in which the inherent power under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. could be exercised. Para 102 of the decision reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n ‘102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant\n provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of\n law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to\n the exercise of the extraordinary power under \nArticle 226\n or the\n inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have\n extracted and reproduced above, we give the following\n categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power\n could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any\n court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not\n be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and\n sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae\n and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein\n such power should be exercised.\n\n (1) Where the allegations made in the first\n information report or the complaint, even if they are\n taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety\n do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a\n case against the accused.\n\n (2) Where the allegations in the first information\n report and other materials, if any, accompanying the\n FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an\n investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of\n the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within\n the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.\n\n (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made\n in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in\n support of the same do not disclose the commission of\n any offence and make out a case against the accused.\n\n (4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not\n constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a\n non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted\n by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as\n contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.\n\n (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or\n complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on\n the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a\n\n\f 14\n\n just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for\n proceeding against the accused.\n\n (6) Where there is an express legal bar\n engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the\n Act concerned (under which a criminal proceeding is\n instituted) to the institution and continuance of the\n proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision\n in the Code or the Act concerned, providing efficacious\n redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.\n\n (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly\n attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is\n maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for\n wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view\n to spite him due to private and personal grudge.’\n\n18. Applying the aforestated edicts to the case on hand, we may take\n\nnote of certain glaring inconsistencies and discrepancies. Though Bhawna\n\nhad earlier alleged that her mother-in-law, Kusum Lata, and her\n\nbrother-in-law, Abhishek, had taken away all her jewellery after her marriage\n\non the pretext of safekeeping, she specifically stated in her deposition before\n\nthe Family Court, Narsinghpur, in Civil Suit No. 153A of 2015, that her entire\n\nstridhan jewellery was with Nimish and in spite of repeated demands, he was\n\nnot returning it to her. Further, during her cross-examination therein, she\n\nadmitted that she had made a complaint to the High Court against Abhishek.\n\nThe complaint was styled as an anonymous one, but Bhawna voluntarily\n\nowned up to being its author. This aspect bears out her animosity against her\n\nin-laws and more particularly, Abhishek.\n\n19. The most significant aspect to be taken note of presently is that\n\nBhawna admittedly parted ways with her matrimonial home and her in-laws in\n\n\f 15\n\nFebruary, 2009, be it voluntarily or otherwise, but she did not choose to make\n\na complaint against them in relation to dowry harassment till the year 2013.\n\nSurprisingly, FIR No. 56 dated 09.02.2013 records that the occurrence of the\n\noffence was from 02.07.2007 to 05.02.2013, but no allegations were made by\n\nBhawna against the appellants after she left her matrimonial home in\n\nFebruary, 2009. Significantly, Bhawna got married to Nimish on 02.07.2007\n\nat Indore and went to Mumbai with him on 08.07.2007. Her interaction with\n\nher in-laws thereafter seems to have been only during festivals and is stated\n\nto be about 3 or 4 times. Sourabh, an architect, was stationed at Delhi since\n\nthe year 2007 and no specific allegation was ever made against him by\n\nBhawna. In fact, she merely made a general allegation to the effect that he\n\nalso tortured her mentally and physically for dowry. No specific instance was\n\ncited by her in that regard or as to how he subjected her to such harassment\n\nfrom Delhi. Similarly, Abhishek became a judicial officer 6 or 7 months after\n\nher marriage and seems to have had no occasion to be with Bhawna and\n\nNimish at Mumbai. His exposure to her was only when she came to visit her\n\nin-laws during festivals. Surprisingly, Bhawna alleges that at the time of his\n\nown marriage, Abhishek demanded that Bhawna and her parents should\n\nprovide him with a car and ₹.2 lakhs in cash. Why he would make such a\n\ndemand for dowry, even if he was inclined to commit such an illegality, from\n\nhis sister-in-law at the time of his own marriage is rather incongruous and\n\n\f 16\n\ndifficult to comprehend. Further, the fact that Bhawna confessed to making a\n\nvicious complaint against Abhishek to the High Court clearly shows that her\n\nmotives were not clean insofar as her brother-in-law, Abhishek, is concerned,\n\nand she clearly wanted to wreak vengeance against her in-laws. The\n\nallegation levelled by Bhawna against her mother-in-law, Kusum Lata, with\n\nregard to how she taunted her when she wore a maxi is wholly insufficient to\n\nconstitute cruelty in terms of \nSection 498A\n IPC.\n\n20. We may also note that Bhawna herself claimed that Nimish came\n\nto her brother’s wedding in 2012, but she has no details to offer with regard to\n\nany harassment for dowry being meted out to her by her mother-in-law and\n\nher brothers-in-law after 2009. As noted earlier, even for that period also, her\n\nallegations are mostly general and omnibus in nature, without any specific\n\ndetails as to how and when her brothers-in-law and mother-in-law, who lived\n\nin different cities altogether, subjected her to harassment for dowry.\n\n21. Most damaging to Bhawna’s case is the fact that she did nothing\n\nwhatsoever after leaving her matrimonial home in February, 2009, and filed a\n\ncomplaint in the year 2013 alleging dowry harassment, just before her\n\nhusband instituted divorce proceedings.\n\n22. Given the totality of the facts and circumstances, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that Bhawna’s allegations against the appellants, such as\n\nthey are, are wholly insufficient and, prima facie, do not make out a case\n\n\f 17\n\nagainst them. Further, they are so farfetched and improbable that no prudent\n\nperson can conclude that there are sufficient grounds to proceed against\n\nthem. \nIn effect, the case on hand falls squarely in categories (1) and (5) set\n\nout in \nBhajan Lal\n (supra). Permitting the criminal process to go on against\n\nthe appellants in such a situation would, therefore, result in clear and patent\n\ninjustice. This was a fit case for the High Court to exercise its inherent power\n\nunder \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. to quash the FIR and the consequential\n\nproceedings.\n\n23. The appeals are accordingly allowed.\n\n FIR No. 56 of 2013 and Criminal Case No. 11954 of 2014 pending\n\non the file of the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Indore, shall stand\n\nquashed insofar as the appellants, Kusum Lata, Abhishek Gour and Sourabh\n\nGour, are concerned.\n\n Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.\n\n .....................................,J\n (ANIRUDDHA BOSE)\n\n ......................................,J\n (SANJAY KUMAR)\n\n ......................................,J\n (S.V.N.
