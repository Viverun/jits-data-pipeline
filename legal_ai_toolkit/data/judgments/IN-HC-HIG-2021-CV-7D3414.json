Facts in brief are as under:\n\n2.1 The judgement under challenge is at the behest of the original\n\npetitioners, who were treated as unsuccessful candidates by the\n\nGujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) in the selection\n\nprocess for the post of Assistant Conservator of Forests, Class ­\n\nII (for short 'ACF') and Range Forest Officer, Class ­ II (for short\n\n'RFO') conducted pursuant to the advertisement dated 01.03.2010\n\n(Advertisement No. 209/2009­10).\n\n2.2 On 01.03.2010, the GPSC published an advertisement inviting\n\napplications for 47 posts of ACF (Class II) and 120 posts of RFO\n\n(Class­II). The distribution of 167 posts (47 + 120) in the\n\nadvertisement is summarised as below:\n\nAdv. Name of Total Posts Category wise posts.

This was in accordance with the Gujarat Civil Services\n\n(Reservation of Posts for Women) Rules, 1997 (for short 'Rules,\n\n1997') which at the relevant time prescribed 30% reservation for\n\nwomen candidates.\n\n2.4 On 30.05.2010, the GPSC conducted a preliminary test. From\n\n27.05.2013 to 02.06.2013, the GPSC conducted written tests. On\n\n21.05.2014, GPSC declared the result of the main Written\n\nExamination. 505 candidates had cleared the main Written\n\nExamination and appeared for the Personal Interview scheduled\n\nfrom 16.06.2014 to 31.07.2014. On 25.09.2014, GPSC declared the\n\nfinal result of the competitive examination for the posts of ACF and\n\nRFO. The preparation of the merit list and declaration of results on\n\n25.09.2014 gave rise to the petitions as the original petitioners -\n\nwomen candidates were declared unsuccessful.\n\nPage 7 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n2.5 Pleadings of Letters Patent Appeal No. 1109 of 2015 were\n\nconsidered for the purposes of analysis of the judgement of the\n\nlearned Single Judge in context of the issue under consideration.\n\nThe result dated 25.09.2014 made the following declarations in the\n\nmerit:\n\n(i) Clause 8 of the result declared that with regard to women\n\nreservation, as provided for in the Government Notification\n\ndated 09.04.1997 and GAD Circular dated 22.05.1997, 51\n\nwomen candidates (Gen ­ 26, SEBC ­ 15, SC ­ 02 and ST ­ 08)\n\nare required to be selected.\n\n(ii)The result stipulated that as against this, 19 women of\n\nGeneral Category, 6 women of SEBC Category, 1 woman of SC\n\nCategory and 04 women of ST Category, thus total 30 women\n\ncandidates have been selected.\n\n(iii) Clause 9 of the result declared that the required number\n\nof women candidates of SEBC, SC, ST and General categories\n\ncould not be selected even after relaxing 10% of the minimum\n\nqualifying standard prescribed for the male candidates of their\n\nrespective categories.\n\n1. The qualifying standards for general category male is 429.\n\nPage 8 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nAfter relaxation of 10% marks, the qualifying marks for\n\ngeneral category female comes to 386.10 and hence general\n\ncategory female candidates who have obtained more than\n\n386 marks have been selected for recommendation to the\n\nGovernment.\n\n2. The qualifying standard of SEBC category male is 375\n\nmarks. After relaxation of 10% marks, the qualifying\n\nmarks for general category female comes to 337.50 and\n\nhence SEBC category female candidates who have obtained\n\nmore than 337 marks have been selected for\n\nrecommendation to the Government.\n\n3. The qualifying standard of SC category male is 387 marks.\n\nAfter relaxation of 10% marks, the qualifying marks for SC\n\ncategory female candidates comes to 348.30 and hence SC\n\ncategory female candidates who have obtained more than\n\n348.30 marks have been selected for recommendation to the\n\nGovernment.\n\n4. Similarly, the qualifying standard of ST category male is\n\n316 marks. After relaxation of 10% marks, the qualifying\n\nmarks for ST category female comes to 284.40 and hence ST\n\nPage 9 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ncategory female candidates who have obtained more than\n\n284.40 marks have been selected for recommendation to the\n\ngovernment.\n\n(iv) Clause 10 of the result, therefore, stipulated that out of\n\n51 total posts reserved for women candidates of General,\n\nSEBC, SC and ST categories, 19 women candidates of General,\n\n6 women of SEBC category, 1 woman of SC category and 04\n\nwomen candidates of ST category have been selected. Hence,\n\nmale candidates of their respective categories are selected\n\nagainst the posts reserved for women of respective categories.\n\n2.6 The aforesaid clauses prescribing qualifying standard of marks\n\nand positioning male candidates in the deficit posts - 21 in number,\n\nhas given rise to the controversy under consideration.\n\n3. Before the learned Single Judge, the unsuccessful female\n\ncandidates in essential raised the following four grounds of challenge\n\nwhich the learned Single Judge classified under four heads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"(A) The method, procedure and basis followed and adopted by\n\nPage 10 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nGPSC for determining the qualifying standard (described by\nGPSC as cut­off marks).\n\n(B) Transferring the quota reserved for female candidates to\nmale candidates and also transferring the quota reserved for\ncandidates possessing special qualification to the candidates\nnot possessing such special qualification.\n\n(C) Migrating the candidates.\n\n(D) Adopting and applying criteria/policy which was not\ndeclared and informed to the candidates (and thereby\nchanging the criteria in the midstream). \"\n\n3.1 With regard to heads (A) and (B) as noted above, perusal of the\n\norder of the learned Single Judge would indicate that the learned\n\nSingle Judge held, on the submission made by the learned Counsel\n\nfor the respective petitioners, that the qualifying standard which\n\nprescribed cut­off marks at the rate of 10% was introduced only after\n\nthe stage when the interview got concluded and at the stage after\n\nthe common merit list was prepared and when the GPSC started\n\npreparing the selection list for the first time in the entire selection\n\nprocess.\n\n3.2 The learned Single Judge on examining the provisions of the\n\nRules governing the examination for ACF and RFO, namely, The\n\nAssistant Conservator of Forest/Range Forest Officer\n\nPage 11 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nCompetitive Examination Rules, 2008 (for short 'the\n\nExamination Rules') in especially considering Rules 9 and 19\n\nthereof, found that the Examination Rules do not empower the\n\nCommission to determine and prescribe minimum qualifying\n\nmarks/standard at any stage other than the two stages mentioned in\n\nRules 9 and 19 of the Examination Rules. According to the learned\n\nSingle Judge, despite this rule position, it was for the first time that\n\nthe GPSC introduced the qualifying marks standard after the\n\npreparation of the merit list. The learned Single Judge extensively\n\ndiscussed the position with regard to the Commission's legality in\n\nproviding such qualifying standards (as discussed in paras 16 to 18\n\nthereof) and found that the prescription of qualifying standards after\n\nthe examinations were conducted in accordance with the\n\nExamination Rules, at the stage of preparation of merit list, was\n\nuntenable. The learned Single Judge found that the concept of\n\nqualifying standard of 10% for assessing the bench mark for\n\nincluding the reserved quota for women in all the categories was\n\nbased on the marks obtained by the last male candidate in each\n\ncategory of which 10% less was the yardstick prescribed for bringing\n\nin a female within that category. It will be in the fitness of things to\n\nPage 12 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nreproduce the relevant findings of the learned Single Judge on the\n\nissue in question.\n\n\"16.5 Under the said Examination Rules or under the\nRecruitment Rules, there is no provision (other than above­\nquoted two Rules 9 and 19 in the Examination Rules), which\nempower determination of qualifying marks/standard at any\nstage, other than the said two stages mentioned in Rule 9 and\nRule 19 of the Examination Rules. The Examination Rules\nand/or Recruitment Rules also do not contain any provision\n(other than said two Rules) which empower the commission to\ndetermine and prescribe minimum qualifying marks/standard\nat any stage other than the two stages mentioned in Rule 9 and\nRule 19 of the Examination Rules. The Examination Rules\nand/or the Recruitment Rules do not contain any provision in\nlight of which or on the strength of which minimum qualifying\nmarks/standard can be introduced and enforced by the\ncommission and that too at the stage which is not contemplated\nand provided for in the Rules.\n\n16.6 Despite this position the commission determined, for the\nfirst time and introduced qualifying marks/standard\n(described by the commission as cut­off marks), after\nconclusion of stage of preliminary examination and the stage of\nwritten test and the stage of interview and after general /\ncommon merit list was prepared on the basis of aggregate\nmarks secured by the candidates during the written test and\ninterview.\n\n17. The Examination Rules prescribe the procedure for\nconducting examinations for selection of candidates for the said\ntwo posts. Rule 3 of the said Examination Rules, 2008\nprescribes, inter alia, that upon receiving requisition from the\nGovernment the Commission shall hold combined competitive\nexamination for selection of candidates. Rule 4 of the said\nExamination Rules provides that examination shall be held in\ntwo successive stages whereby preliminary examination for\nselection of candidates and then main examination (written\n\nPage 13 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ntest and interview) will be conducted. The said preliminary\nexamination will comprise objective type test. At the second\nstage, main examination for final selection of candidates has to\nbe conducted. The said main examination comprises written\ntest and interview. Part­I of the Schedule to the said\nExamination Rules, 2008 prescribes, inter alia, that the\npreliminary examination shall consist one paper of objective\ntype and shall carry 150 marks. It also provides that the\nnumber of candidates to be allowed to appear in the main\nexamination shall be about 15 times the approximate number\nof vacancies advertised. With reference to the main\nexamination, the said Part I of the schedule provides that the\nwritten examination shall consist five papers of conventional\ntype. Part III further provides that paper one, paper two and\npaper three will be compulsory papers and each paper will\ncarry 100 marks and paper four and paper five will be optional\npapers and each paper will carry 200 marks. Rule 9 of\nExamination Rules, prescribes the procedure to be\nfollowed by the Commission and provides, inter alia,\nthat the Commission shall arrange names of the\ncandidates in order of merit on the basis of aggregate\nmarks finally awarded to each candidate in the main\nexamination (i.e. written and interview test) and in that\norder, the Commission shall recommend the candidates\nfor appointment. The said provision under Rule 9 is subject\nto the proviso which prescribes that where the vacancies\nreserved for the candidates belonging to SC or ST or SEBC\ncategory cannot be filled ­ up on the basis of qualifying\naggregate marks fixed for general category, the Commission\nmay relax the standard of aggregate marks to make up\nfor the deficiency in the reserved posts. Thus, the said rule also\nconfers power to relax the qualifying standard in the event\nvacancies reserved for candidates belonging to SC, ST or SEBC\ncategory cannot be filled­up. Rule 19 obliges the commission\nto fix qualifying marks and it further provides that the\ncandidates who obtain minimum qualifying marks, as\nmay be fixed by the Commission in the preliminary\nexamination shall be allowed to appear in the main\nexamination subject to their satisfying the eligibility criteria\n\nPage 14 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nand that the candidates who obtain minimum qualifying\nmarks as may be fixed by the Commission in the main\nexamination (written) shall be called for interview. The\nexpression the candidates who have obtained minimum\nqualifying marks as may be fixed by the commission... ...\nsignifies and clarifies that the said provisions oblige the GPSC\nto fix minimum qualifying marks at the stage of\npreliminary examination stage (for allowing entry to\nappear for written test) and at the stage of main\nexamination / written test (for allowing entry to appear in\ninterview). The said expression indicates that the candidates\nwho obtain marks fixed by GPSC as minimum qualification\ncan enter into next level. The said Rule 19 also empowers the\nCommission to relax the said qualifying standard at the\nstage of examination i.e. in preliminary examination or\nin the main examination (written), if the Commission is of\nthe opinion that sufficient number of candidates from SC or ST\nor SEBC category are not likely to be available for main\nexamination (written) or for interview which is clarified by the\nexpression \"... ... ... may be allowed to appear........by relaxing\nthe standard ..\"..\n\n17.1 In light of said provision it comes out that (a) the Rules do\nnot prescribe any particular percentage or marks as qualifying\nstandard; (b) however the Rules prescribe the stage/s when the\nqualifying standard should be fixed viz. at the stage of\npreliminary examination (for allowing entry to appear in\nwritten test) and at the stage of written test (for allowing entry\nto appear in interview); (c) once the candidates cross the stage\nof main examination (i.e. the written test and interview), then\nfurther requirement in form of qualifying standard for\nentry in selection list (i.e. list containing names and marks\nof successful candidates in the written test and interview) is\nnot prescribed by the Rules; (d) Rules 9 and 19 indicate that\nactually the said Rules aim at informing the qualifying\nstandard to the students so that they know the minimum\nmarks/standard they must achieve to reach next level.\n\n18.

Actually, the\ncandidates were not even aware as to whether any qualifying\nstandard is fixed or not. It is pertinent to mention at this stage\nthat respondent GPSC determined, settled, adopted and\napplied different qualifying standard with regard to each of the\nfour categories mentioned in the advertisement.\n\n18.1 In present cases controversy and dispute have arisen on\naccount of the basis adopted and the procedure and method\nfollowed by respondent GPSC for determining and settling the\nqualifying standard (cut­off marks) and the said method,\nprocedure and basis have given birth to the objection that\nGPSC is neither justified nor authorized to determine\nqualifying standard for female candidates (for filling up the\nvacancies in reserved quota) on the basis of and by taking\ninto account the marks secured by last male candidate\ni.e. the male candidate, who, depending on the number of\nvacancies available of particular category, is the \"last\ncandidate required (depending on number of notified vacancy)\nfor complying the quota in that category and at such belated\nstage.\n\n18.2 On this count, it is pertinent that for the purpose of\ndetermining the qualifying standard the respondent GPSC\nfirst picked­up the General / Unreserved Category and took\ninto account total number of vacancies in that category.\nThereafter the respondent GPSC started from the candidate at\nthe top in the common merit list (i.e. the candidate with highest\nmarks) and, while descending, it started identifying only male\ncandidates belonging to the said / particular category and\nproceeded in descending order by taking into account marks of\nonly male candidates in that particular category (i.e. excluding\nall female candidates/marks obtained by female candidates in\nthat category) and continued to descend in similar\nmanner until it reached the male candidate who,\ndepending on the number of notified vacancies in the\nparticular category, would be the last male candidate\n\nPage 16 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nrequired to fill­up the vacancies in that particular\ncategory. The marks secured by such last male candidate of\nthat particular category are treated and adopted and applied\nby GPSC as the qualifying marks/standard (what is described\nby GPSC as cut­off marks) for the respective category. The\nprocedure and method followed by GPSC is explained by it in\nparagraphs No.6.2 to 6.4 of its affidavit dated 23.2.2015 filed\nin SCA No.14849 of 2014 and it is further explained in para\nNo.2 of its additional affidavit dated 24.2.2015.\n\n18.3 Besides this even in the notification dated 25.9.2014\nGPSC itself has admitted and stated that: The candidates at\nRank No...... ST being female candidates have been selected\nafter relaxing the minimum qualifying standard prescribed for\nmale candidates of their respective categories. (Emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n18.4 From the details mentioned in said affidavits it has\nemerged that for combined (i.e. ACF + RFO) 84 position of\nunreserved / general category, 26 position are reserved (@ 30%\nof total number of notified vacancy for the said category) for\nfemale candidates and for selecting female candidates for said\nposition, the marks secured by the male candidate in general\ncategory whose name is listed at Sr.No.78 in the general /\ncommon merit list is treated as the marks of last candidate\nin general / unreserved category (though only 58\nposition / vacancies are to filled­up) and the marks\nsecured by the said male candidate at Sr.No.78 is\nrecognized as minimum qualifying marks/standard for\nthe female candidates in general / unreserved category\non the premise that the said candidate at Sr.No.78 is last male\ncandidate to enter the selection list in general/unreserved\ncategory and the said marks are then adopted and applied as\nbenchmark for selection of female candidates and for\ncomplying the reserved quota. In response to the query, the\nlearned counsel for GPSC submitted and clarified that the\nstandard/basis which came to be fixed, settled and adopted in\nabove mentioned manner (as qualifying marks/standard) is\ntreated as yardstick and benchmark for all purposes including\n\nPage 17 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nthe process and purpose of filling­up the reserved quota for\nwomen in other three categories as well and for the candidates\nseeking selection in the quota reserved for persons holding\nspecial qualification.\n\n18.5 It is relevant to mention that the stage of finalizing\nselection list and declaring successful candidates was reached\nafter crossing three stages of screening. It is also relevant to\nnote that the respondent GPSC also did not adopt the marks\nsecured by a candidate in particular category regardless or\nirrespective of the fact that such last candidate is male\ncandidate or female candidate but the respondent GPSC\nconsciously started the process by picking up the marks\nsecured only by male candidates in respective categories\nand proceeded going downwards while taking into\naccount the marks secured by only male candidates and\nit consciously opted for and adopted marks secured by such last\nmale candidate as the qualifying standard.\n\n18.6 It is pertinent that neither the Recruitment Rules\nnor the Reservation Rules nor the Examination Rules\nprovide for or contemplate or permit such procedure\nand method and/or authorize GPSC to follow such\nprocedure. Such method, basis and procedure is, therefore,\nnot permissible under the Rules. Actually, such procedure\nmilitates against and frustrates diligent, honest and genuine\nand complete implementation of quota reserved for female\ncandidates of all four categories.\n\n19. The basis/standard adopted and the procedure and\nmethod followed by GPSC for determining and settling the\nqualifying marks/standard is not only contrary to and beyond\nthe purview of the Rules or de hors the Rules but there is no\nrationale for the decision / action of adopting marks secured by\nonly male candidate as the base / benchmark and the\nGPSC has not offered any explanation or justification\nfor such decision and the procedure, basis and method\nfollowed and adopted by GPSC are irrational,\nunjustified and do not find support from the applicable\n\nPage 18 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nRules and are not sustainable.\n\n20. The Court would hasten to clarify that the aforesaid view\nand finding is not to say or to suggest and it does not mean\nthat the Court finds fault with the principle and/or practice of\napplying the qualifying standard and/or with the practice of\nnot relaxing the qualifying standard below certain extent. Nay.\nNot the least. What, in the opinion of the Court, is objectionable\nand untenable, is the manner in which GPSC determined the\nqualifying marks/standard and the procedure it followed and\nthe basis which it adopted (wherein it took into account marks\nsecured by only male candidates) for the said purpose and not\nthe decision to determine and apply qualifying\nmarks/standard. In this background and in this view of the\nmatter, the Court is convinced to hold that the impugned\nmethod, basis and procedure are incapable of approval and\nacceptance. The very basis adopted by GPSC is fundamentally\nerroneous and irrational and untenable.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n3.3 In short, the learned Single Judge found that prescription of\n\napplying the qualifying standard with the practice of relaxing the\n\nqualifying standard for female candidates with reference to\n\nminimum qualifying marks for male candidates was faulty.\n\nHowever, in para 25 of the decision, the learned Single Judge\n\nclarified that the action of determining qualifying marks and/or the\n\naction of allowing relaxation therein essentially are not sustained on\n\naccount of the manner in which the said process is carried out and\n\nthe basis which the GPSC adopted and not for want of jurisdiction to\n\nPage 19 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ndo so. The learned Single Judge held that the action of allowing\n\nrelaxation is not sustained also because it is tainted with vice of\n\ndiscrimination and the error of not applying relevant factors and not\n\nfor want of power.\n\n\"25. For the foregoing reasons and in light of the facts, the\nimpugned method and procedure followed by GPSC and the\nbasis adopted by GPSC for fixing / determining the qualifying\nstandard as well as the qualifying marks/standard\ndetermined and settled and adopted by GPSC are not\nsustainable and deserve to be set aside and are consequently set\naside and as corollary all subsequent and consequential\ndecisions and actions by GPSC which are taken in\npursuance of and on the basis of such qualifying\nstandard (decided in impugned method) fall and stand\nvitiated. At this stage, it is necessary to further clarify that the\naction of determining qualifying marks / standard and/or the\naction of allowing relaxation therein are, essentially, not\nsustained on account of the manner in which the said\nprocess is carried out and the basis which GPSC\nadopted and not for want of power. The action of allowing\nrelaxation is not sustained also because it is tainted with vice\nof discrimination and the error of not applying relevant factors\nand not for want of power.\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n3.4 On the second limb of the fall­out of this qualifying standard,\n\nthe learned Single Judge held that by virtue of this operation of the\n\nqualifying standard of 10%, the process of selection of female\n\ncandidates seeking selection in the reserved quota caused a\n\nsubstantial shortfall in the number of female candidates being\n\nPage 20 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nselected, though sufficient number of female candidates in each\n\ncategory who meet with and fulfill the eligibility criteria prescribed\n\nby the Rules and notified in the advertisement are available. On the\n\nsubmission of the learned Counsel for GPSC that this 10%\n\nrelaxation of GPSC was based on the opinion of the learned\n\nAdvocate General, the learned Single Judge held that such an\n\nopinion taken years back had no foundation of a statutory backing\n\nand had no nexus with the post in question and therefore could not\n\nhave been relied upon.\n\n3.5 As a result of the shortfall of 21 vacancies not being fulfilled in\n\nas a result of the process of restricted intake of female candidates in\n\neach of the four categories inasmuch as out of 51 vacancies only 30\n\nfemale candidates found their place as a result of the qualifying\n\nstandard and the treatment by GPSC in transferring these 21\n\npositions to male candidates and their consequential selection was\n\nalso a subject matter of consideration before the learned Single\n\nJudge. Having held that on the conjoint reading of the recruitment\n\nrules, relaxation of qualifying standards was faulty, the learned\n\nSingle Judge held that when the recruitment rules and the\n\nPage 21 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nreservation rules are read, then the recruitment examination rules\n\nprovided that the qualifying standards ought to be relaxed to\n\naccommodate required number of candidates of reserved category\n\nand the Commission must strive to fill up the quota reserved for\n\nfemale candidates belonging to reserved categories even by relaxing\n\nthe qualifying standards fixed by it rather than transferring the\n\nposition to the male candidates. By doing so and restricting the\n\nintake of female candidates, the female reservation got constricted\n\nwhich was not in consonance with the Rules.\n\n3.6 On reliance placed by the GPSC on the Circulars dated\n\n09.04.1997 and 22.05.1997 providing for a clarification that in the\n\nevent, a requisite number of female candidates are not available,\n\nthen the vacancies may be filled up by male candidates of the\n\nrespective categories, the learned Single Judge on an extensive\n\ndiscussion of the Circulars found that a recourse to such Circulars\n\ncould not be taken when the Examination Rules obliged the\n\nCommission to fill up the notified vacancies of the reserved quota to\n\nthe fullest extent and when female candidates were available.\n\nPage 22 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n3.7 In other words, the learned Single Judge found that the\n\nbenefit of reservation of women as prescribed under the Reservation\n\nRules got restricted by virtue of providing for 10% relaxation and\n\ntransferring of the posts - 21 reserved for women to the male\n\ncandidates was contrary to the spirit of the Recruitment Rules and\n\nthe Reservation Rules and the petitions were therefore allowed. The\n\nfinal result dated 25.09.2014 and the subsequent revision of result\n\ncarried out by the GPSC based on the decision of the Apex Court in\n\nthe case of\nUnion of India vs. Ramesh Ram\n[(2010) 7 SCC 234\n\nwas quashed and set aside. The learned Single Judge in para 57\n\nheld as under:\n\n\"57. In the result and as an upshot of foregoing discussions:\n\n(a) the qualifying marks / standard (described as cut­off\nmarks by GPSC) determined and applied by the respondent\nGPSC by following and adopting earlier discussed method,\nprocedure and base are, for the recorded reasons, set aside.\n\n(b) Consequently, all subsequent decisions and actions which\nare based on the said qualifying standard and/or which are\ntaken pursuant to and/or on the basis of and by applying the\nsaid qualifying standard / cut­off marks do not survive and all\nsuch consequential decisions, steps and actions are set aside.\n\n(c) In the result and for the recorded reasons, impugned\nselection list notified by GPSC on 25.9.2014 stands quashed.\n\nThus, the list revised by GPSC vide notification dated\n23.1.2015 automatically falls and does not survive.\n\nPage 23 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n(d) The action of the respondent GPSC of categorizing part\nof the notified vacancies reserved for women candidates and\nalso out of the vacancies reserved for candidates with special\nsubject, as vacant and the further / subsequent action of\ntransferring the position out of reserved quota for women\ncandidates to male candidates and out of the quota reserved for\ncandidates with special subject, to other candidates not\nholding said special qualification, also stand quashed.\n\n(e) The action of considering the meritorious reserved category\ncandidates (who secured their position in general/open\ncategory on account of their performance) in their respective\nreserved category only because they availed benefit of\n\"concession\" which cannot be considered as \"relaxation in\nmerits\" also set aside since it is found to be contrary to the\ndecision by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Jitendra Kumar\nSingh (supra).\n\n(f) So far as Special Civil Application No.14849/2014 is\nconcerned, it stands partly allowed inasmuch as petitioners'\nobjection against the qualifying standard fixed by GPSC and\nthe objection against adopting criterion of 10% for relaxing\nqualifying standard and the objection against considering the\nmarks obtained by last male candidate as cut­off marks /\nqualifying standard are accepted and the selection list\nprepared on such basis is set aside. However, the contention\nthat meritorious reserved category candidates who secured\nposition in general/unreserved (open) category list should be,\nfor the purpose of complying reserved quota, considered in their\nrespective reserved category is not accepted. Horizontal\nreservation, even compartmentalized reservation, cannot be\nmaintained by taking away a slice from the quota for vertical\nreservation.\n\n(g) So far as Special Civil Applications No.14330/2014,\n14331/2014 and Special Civil Applications No. 16620/2014\nare concerned, the said petitions are also partly allowed\ninasmuch as the objection against qualifying standard fixed by\nGPSC by considering marks of last candidate as the base is\n\nPage 24 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\naccepted and the qualifying standard determined by GPSC on\nsuch basis and the selection list are set aside and the\nobjection against adopting criterion of 10% for relaxing\nsaid qualifying standard is also accepted. However, so far\nas the further relief claimed by the petitioner in Special Civil\nApplication no.16620 of 2014 that her case should be\nconsidered for the post of AFO is concerned, it is clarified that\nat this stage, the said request cannot be considered because\nnow the process of preparing fresh selection list will have to be\nundertaken and it shall be finalized afresh.\n\n(h) So far as Special Civil Application No.13857/2014 is\nconcerned, the said petition is also partly allowed inasmuch as\nthe decision of applying said qualifying standard and the\ndecision to apply criterion of 7% for relaxing qualifying\nstandard and the decision to consider part of the notified\nposition from the quota reserved for candidates with special\nsubject (i.e. the candidates holding specified special\nqualification) as vacant and the further decision to\ntransfer such position to the candidates not holding\nqualification of special subject by treating such notified\nposition as vacant, is set aside.\n\n(i) So far as Special Civil Application No.15057/2015 is\nconcerned, having regard to the fact that at the relevant time,\nonly one contention/objection was raised and pressed in\nservice, viz. the impugned notification is bad and\nunsustainable because waiting list is not prepared and notified\nunder the said notification, the said petition is, therefore,\nexamined in light of the said singular contention and with\nregard to the said objection (of the petitioner in Special Civil\nApplication No.15057/2015) it is found and held that in light\nof applicable Rules said objection is not sustainable. Though\nthe said petitioner did not raise any other contention with\nregard to the notification and/or selection list, it is clarified\nthat the decision with reference to the qualifying standard /\ncut­off marks and the selection list (with regard to the\nobjections by other petitioners) will apply to and will govern the\ncase of the petitioner in SCA No.15057/2015 also.\n\n(j) So far as Special Civil Applications No.1100/2015 and\n\nPage 25 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n1141/2015 are concerned, the said petitions are also partly\nallowed and the decision of the respondent GPSC of\nconsidering the candidates who availed benefit of relaxation /\nreservation though they have not availed benefit of relaxation\nin qualifying standard, is, it being contrary to the decision by\nApex Court in case of Jitendra Kumar Singh (supra), set aside.\n\n(k) So far as Special Civil Application No.2125/2015 is\nconcerned, in view of the fact that the qualifying standard /\ncut­off marks decided by the GPSC is set aside, the decision\nwith regard to allotment of any candidate to the post of ACF or\nRFO will have to be taken afresh by the respondent GPSC after\npreparing fresh selection list and that, therefore, at this stage,\nthe declaration as prayed for by the petitioner (i.e. to allot the\nsaid petitioner to the post of ACF) cannot be granted. However,\nso far as other contentions which are similar and common as\nin other petitions, are concerned, they shall be governed by the\nconclusion with reference to other petitions. It is clarified that\nif the petitioner has any grievance with regard to her allotment\nafter fresh selection list is prepared, then at that stage, it would\nbe open and permissible to the petitioner to take appropriate\naction against the decision by GPSC. However, in view of the\nCourt's decision with reference to the qualifying standard /\ncut­off marks, the consequential actions including allotment of\nthe candidates to the higher post will not survive and that\nprocess also will have to be taken afresh. \"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n4.

For the benefit of the women candidates, a general policy\ndecision can be taken by the Public Service Commission to\ngrant relaxation in qualifying marks determined for\nelimination test. This policy is legally permissible under\n\narticle 16\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n5.\nIn 1999(9) Judgments Today 152 (\nHaridas Parsedia vs.\nUrmila Shakya & Ors\n) the Supreme Court has observed as\nunder:\n\n\"We have, therefore, to see whether the State of Madhya\nPradesh, in its discretion and within permissible limits\nof\nArticle 16\n, had taken any policy decision to give\ngeneral relaxation of passing marks to SC/ST\ncandidates appearing at the departmental\nexaminations.\"\n\nThe Court held that ­\n\n\"Even when SC/ST candidates compete among\nthemselves for the reserved category posts they are\nrequired to pass the written examination.

The ultimate object is to get at least three\ncandidates or as is prescribed, who may be called for vivo­voce.\nTherefore, the lowest range of aggregate marks as cut off for\ngeneral candidates should be so worked out as to get the\nrequired number of candidates including OBCs, Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes. The lowest range would,\ntherefore, be worked out in such a way that candidates\nnumbering 15 times the notified posts/vacancies would be\nsecured so as to afford an opportunity to the candidates to\ncompete in the main examination.\n\nUnder the provision, if that range has not been reached\nby the candidates belonging to the SCs or the STs, there may be\n5% further cut off from the last range worked out for the\ngeneral candidates so as to declare them as qualified for\nappearing in the main examination. In other words, where\ncandidates belonging to the SCs and STs numbering 15 times\nthe total vacancies reserved for them are not available then\nService Commission has to go down further and cut off 5% of\nthe marks from the lowest of the range prescribed for general\ncandidates and then declare as eligible the SC and ST\ncandidates who secured 5% less than the lowest range fixed by\nP.S.C. for general candidates so as to enable them to appear for\nthe main examination.\"\n\n7.\nIn AIR 1999 SC 2894 (Dr. Preeti Srivastava and another\n\nPage 32 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(\ns)\n\nvs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n) the Supreme Court held that \"it\nis basically, for an expert body like the Medical Council of\nIndia to determine whether in the common entrance\nexamination, lower qualifying marks can be prescribed for the\nreserved category of candidates as against the general category\nof candidates; and if so, how much lower. There cannot,\nhowever, be a big disparity in the qualifying marks for the\nreserved category of candidates and the general category of\ncandidates at the post­graduate level.\" The Supreme Court did\nnot approve of the cut off percentage of 20% for the reserved\ncategory and 45% for the general category saying that the\ndisparity of qualifying marks being 20% for the reserved\ncategory and 45% for the general category is too great a\ndisparity to sustain public interest at the level of post­graduate\nmedical training and education.\n\n8. In the background of the aforesaid decisions of the\nSupreme Court, the Public Service Commission can determine\na lower qualifying marks for women candidates, in comparison\nwith the male candidates of respective sources (categories) of\nrecruitment, both at the Elimination Test as well as\nCompetitive Test which the Public Service Commission is\nconducting for selection of candidates. The percentage of marks\nto be lowered is to be determined by the Public Service\nCommission in the context of the aforesaid decisions of the\nSupreme Court. It can be within the range of 5 to 15 per cent.\n\nPage 33 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nAdvise accordingly.\n\nAhmedabad, (S.N.

Moreover, at the stage of direct recruitment in the\ngovernment services, it is provided to give five years relaxation\nin the upper age limit. This order has come into effect from\n09/04/1997. Thereafter, a clarification was made by the\nGeneral Administration Department vide Circular dated\n22/05/1997 regarding several issues raised in the said matter,\nwhich contains below mentioned important provisions.\n\nThe seat of women candidate could be allotted to the male\ncandidate if sufficient women candidates are not available for\nseats reserved for women. The government aims to fill 30% of\n\nPage 34 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nthe total vacancies by women candidates. Therefore, after\ncomputing the candidates admitted on the basis of merit at the\ntime of recruiting 30% posts, remaining of women candidates\nin 30% could be admitted on reservation basis.\n\n2. Following the opinion of the Advocate General\nregarding the standard of selection for women candidates in\nrespect of the government's policy of reserving 30% seats for\nwomen candidates, the Commission has adopted a standard of\nselection by decision dated 25/10/2001 to keep the qualifying\nstandard as low as 10% of the standard of male candidates in\nthat category. Following the decision of the Commission, such\nprocedure is followed while finalizing the result in personal\ninterview of various vacancies conducted by the Commission.\n\n3. The commission issued advertisement for the\nMedical Officer (Ayurveda) Class­II vide Sr.no.100/2005­2006,\ncontaining total 170 seats. Out of the said 170 seats, 40 seats\nwere reserved for ST, wherein 12 seats were reserved for\nwomen. In personal interview of the said post, the commission\nhad fixed qualifying standard of 40 marks for Male\nCandidates and 36 marks for female candidates for general\ncategory and for reserved posts, 25 marks for male candidates\nand 22 marks for female candidates. In 28 seats out of 40 seats\nof ST, two candidates were selected who obtained 25 marks,\nwhereas in 12 seats of women candidates, three candidates\n\nPage 35 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nobtained 25 marks and remaining nine candidates obtained 22\nmarks were selected, whereas, other women candidates\nobtaining 22 makrs were not included in selection list. Among\nthese candidates, Dr. Komal Katara and another candidate\nhad sought relief in the matter from the Hon'ble High Court, In\nwhich, the judgment of the Special Civil Application was in\nfavour of the Commission and the candidates had preferred\nL.P.A, wherein the Division Bench had delivered judgment on\n10/09/2009. It was ordered therein to prepare merit after\nincluding ST candidates (Male or Female), who have obtained\n25 marks or more, in the merit list of 28 posts and after\nconsidering female candidates, who have obtained less than 25\nmarks but more than 22 marks, against 12 reserved posts for\nwomen candidates. Following this judgment, the result of the\nsaid post was sent for recommendation of the government and\naccordaingly, the candidates have been appointed.\n\n4. The Commission or the State had not drawn the\nattention of the Hon'ble High Court towards the provision of\nthe circular dated 22/05/1997 of the General Administration\nDepartment and same thing happened in L.P.A., too.\nTherefore, the Commission and the State had preferred M.C.A.\nregarding the judgment of the division bench of the Hon'ble\nHigh Court. The judgment of M.C.A. No.411/2010 was\ndelivered on 16/03/2010, while remaining three M.C.A. filed\nby the Commission and one M.C.A. filed by the State are still\n\nPage 36 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\npending. In the judgment of M.C.A., the Assistant Government\nPleader had submitted that as explained in point no.7 of the\ncircular dated 22/05/1997 of the General Administration\nDepartment, the women candidates can be appointed only on\nthe reserved posts, when the posts are reserved for the women\ncandidates and remaining 70% posts are not required to be\ntaken into consideration. The said submission was not accepted\nby the Hon'ble High Court and confirmed the judgment\ndelivered earlier.\n\n5. Advocate General's opinion was sought by the\nCommission whether the facts of order dated 10/09/2009 of\nthe Honourable High Court are applicable to all\nadvertisements or it is only applicable to the advertisement of\nMedical Officer (Ayurved) Class­2. Advocate General's opinion\nwas received vide his letter dated 24/12/2009 stating that\nuntil the judgement of Review Petition is pronounced, this\njudgement is applicable to all the advertisements. Hence, the\nCommission has followed this judgement accordingly in the\nadvertisements and it is continued. That is, female candidates\nwho are included in the merit list of general post other than the\nfemale reservation, have been included on the basis of merit\nand separate merit list for female candidates with respect to\nreserved posts has been prepared.\n\n6. There is provision in the circular of General\n\nPage 37 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nAdministration Department dated 22/05/1997 to consider\n30% of the reserved posts for the candidates included on the\nbasis of merit. Whereas, in view of the above mentioned\njudgement, the Commission has not considered meritorious\nfemale candidates against 30% reserved posts. They are\nconsidered in the merit list of remaining post other than the\nreserved posts of woman.\n\n(7) As per the same standard, the result of the exams\nof Gujarat Administrative Services Class­ 1/2 published on 13­\n05­2010 have been prepared. In which, 23 female candidates\nhave been selected as meritorious candidates who were\nfulfilling the eligibility criteria meant for the male candidates\nand have not been counted in reference to the posts of female\nreservation.\n\n(8) The Judgments are rendered by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court regarding Vertical and Horizontal\n\nreservations. In which the latest judgment is given on 03­06­\n2010 in the case of Public Service Commission, Uttranchal ­\nVersus ­ Mamta Bist and others. Looking to the other\njudgments of the Supreme Court mentioned in this judgment\nas well as considering the details of this judgment, the female\nreservation has been included in Horizontal reservation. Hence,\nwhile making the selection for the seats of female reservation,\nthe meritorious female candidates shall also be counted in\n\nPage 38 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nreference to the reserved post earmarked for them. In such\ncircumstances, presently four Review Petitions are pending in\nthe Hon'ble High Court. Therefore, it is to consider whether it\nwould be proper to take steps to get the said petitions heard\n\nfirst by giving reference of Supreme Court judgments OR to\n\ntake steps to correct the result in view of Supreme Court\njudgments in the cases where result is published and\nappointment process is pending.\n\n(9) The legal opinion is to be taken in this case\nbecause, after the Commission has declared the result of the\npost of Class ­ 1 / Class ­2 on 13­05­2010, a legal notice has\nbeen issued to the Government and Public Service Commission\nby Tanna Associates through its letter dtd. 05­07­2010. Public\nService Commission has received this notice on 08­07­010. In\nthis Legal Notice, two recent judgments of the Supreme Court\nhave been referred.\n\n(\n1) Union of India Vs. Ramesh, Ram and Others\n.\n\nC.A. no. 4310 ­ 4311 / 2010 ­ Judgment dtd. ­07­05­2010\n­ and ­\n(2) Public Service Commission, Uttranchal ­ Vs. ­\nMamta Bist and others.\n\nCivil Application no. 5989/ 2007, Judgment dtd. 03­06­2010\n\nReferring these two judgments, it has been submitted that the\nnecessary procedure should be followed after reviewing the\n\nPage 39 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nresult declared on 13­05­2010 and the recommendations done\nregarding the same by the Public Service Commission to the\nGovernment on 03­08­2010. Hence, before carrying out further\nprocedure by the Government in reference to the appointment of\nClass­1 and Class­2, necessary discussion / procedure is to be\ndone regarding the Legal Notice received from Tanna\nAssociates.\n\n(10) From the above details, it can be observed that\nwhile discussing 30 percent reservation for women, the Public\nService Commission is required to take into consideration/\ndecide upon two issues/ factors. (1) 30% reservation for women\nin direct recruitments of Class ­1/2 posts through competitive\nexams and (2) 30% reservation for women in direct\nrecruitments on the basis of interview without competitive\nexam. While discussing the issue, it has to be also taken into\nconsideration that the norms of commission in different types\nof direct recruitments with reference to 30 percent reservation\nfor women remain identical and non­contradictory.\nAdditionally, it is to be seen that any further procedure in this\nregard does not lead to violation/ contempt of court until any\nmodification takes place in the judgment of Gujarat High\nCourt mentioned above at para­4.\n\n(11) On 08/01/2011, an informal meeting was\narranged in the chamber of Advocate General to discuss the\n\nPage 40 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nissue where the Secretary of the commission, Joint Secretary\nShri V.N. Desai, Shri Deepak Shukla, a panel advocate of the\ncommission and the Registrar remained present. In the\nmeeting, the provisions of GAD circular dated 22­05­1997 and\nsubsequent judgment by the Division Bench in Dr. Komal\nKatara case were discussed. The opinion of Advocate General\nwith reference to the judgment is considered while following\nprocedure at present. The details thereof were given. Three\nMCAs of the Commission and one MCA of the GAD are\npending before the High Court. Detailed discussion about legal\naspects was held with Advocate Shri Deepak Shukla, a panel\nadvocate of the commission and the Advocate General that\nconsidering the circumstances, whether the present procedure\nbe continued in accordance with the judgment in case of Dr.\nKomal Katara or the procedure prescribed vide the judgment of\nHon'ble Supreme Court be implemented. After the discussion,\nthe Advocate General opined that the procedure be followed in\naccordance with the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court. The\nMCA in Review Petition of Dr. Katara being pending,\nimplementation of the procedure is not bound by the same. The\nHon'ble High Court can also justify it by placing on record the\njudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court. As per the legal opinion of\n24­12­2009, Komal Katara Judgment is only applicable to the\ncases where situation similar to Komal Katara case has arisen.\nIn a case where situation not similar to Komal Katara case has\nemerged, recruitment of women is to be decided considering\n\nPage 41 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ninstructions of 1997 of the GAD and judgments of the Supreme\nCourt in Mamta Bist case and other similar cases. Under such\ncircumstances, now the Commission is required to take the\ndecision about the matter after a review.\n\n(12) Perusing the Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin the case of Rajeshkumar Dariya V/S Rajasthan P.S.C.\nDated: 18/07/2007, it appears that, in the case of female\nreservation, the merit list should be prepared according to the\ntotal vacancies of concerned category at first, and if the number\nof female candidates equivalent to the reserved posts of female\nor more are included in this merit list, the posts of female\nreservation are deemed to be filled up. But if the female\ncandidates equal to number of female reservation are not\navailable, they shall be considered from the merit list in the\nfollowing order for the selection of the number of such female\ncandidates and the male candidates to that extent shall be\ndecreased from the merit list. For example, 10 posts are to be\nfilled from unreserved category, out of which 3 posts are\nreserved for female. If the passing criteria for unreserved\ncategory is 40 marks, the combined list of male and female\ncandidates securing 40 marks or more is to be prepared first,\nand if three or more females are included in it on merit, no\nfurther consideration is to be made considering that 30 percent\nfemale reservation is fulfilled as per rules. But if two female\ncandidates are included, one more female candidate is to be\n\nPage 42 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nselected and for that, the female candidates from the merit list\nare to be considered in the following order and the male\ncandidate at sr.No.10 in the merit list is to be excluded from\nthe selection list. This kind of consideration is to be adopted\nfor the candidates of scheduled cast / scheduled tribe / socially\nand educationally backward / physically disabled. After\ndiscussion of this fact, following can be considered in the result\nwhich will be declared afterwards.\n\n(a) Instead of prescribing the minimum passing marks / selection\ncriteria separately for the male and female candidates of\nunreserved and reserved category, the minimum passing /\nselection criteria for unreserved category (common minimum\npassing / selection criteria for Male and female) and for the\nreserved category (common minimum passing / selection\ncriteria for Male and female) may be prescribed.\n\n(b) If the female candidates equal to the posts of reserved seats of\nfemale or more are included in the merit list prepared on the\nbasis of minimum passing criteria, no relaxation standard\nshall be fixed for the female candidates considering that the\nprovisions of 30 percent female reservation are complied.\n\n(c) If the female candidates sufficiently equal to the posts of\nfemale reservation are not available in the merit list prepared\non the basis of minimum marks, the shortfall of female\ncandidates shall be selected from the relaxed standard for\nfemale candidates.\n\nPage 43 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n(d) Considering the legal opinion submitted by the Advocate\nGeneral on 06/10/2001 in respect of what extent the minimum\nstandard is to be relaxed for filling up 30 percent posts of\nfemale, the Commission has decided that, 10 percent of the\nminimum marks prescribed for the candidates of\nunreserved/reserved candidates shall be relaxed as the\nstandard in this regard. Such standard is found proper to be\nfollowed in the result which will be declared hereinafter.\nPurpose of the Commission to take such decision is to maintain\n30% female reservation as well as efficiency / merit etc in\ngovernment service. Aforesaid relaxed standard should be\nadopted only for shortfall of candidates in female reservation\nseats and a separate waiting list of female candidates on the\nbasis of relaxed standard should not be maintained.\n\n(Ch) As shown in (Gh) above, if sufficient female candidates are not\navailable for 30% after relaxing standard, such shortfall /\nvacant seats shall be filled by male candidates as per their\nmerit number.\n\n(Chh) Before preparing common merit list for recommendation to the\nGovernment, joint list of all the candidates, category wise\nseparate common merit list for general candidates (male and\nfemale), Scheduled Caste candidates (male and female),\nScheduled Tribe candidates (male and female), Socially and\nEducationally Backward Candidates (male and female),\n\nPage 44 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nphysically handicapped candidates (male and female) shall be\nprepared first.\n\n(Jh) It would also occur sometimes that due to preparing the\nmerit list in aforesaid manner, number of candidates with\nminimum or more marks would be more than total number of\naforesaid category. Under the circumstances, candidates equal\nto number of posts should be kept in selection list and\nremaining candidates should be included in waiting list and if\na candidate does not join after making recommendation and\nproposal is received to call for a name from waiting list, in\nsuch an event, if female candidate has not joined,\nrecommendation should be made from waiting list serially if\n30% seats (meaning seats shown in advertisement) are filled\nwith female candidates in recommendation list and if 30%\nseats are not filled with female candidates, female candidate\nshould be recommended from waiting list, which method is\nbeing followed at present.\n\n(Z) The decision dated 09­09­2005 taken by the Commission\n(Circular No.:EXM­82­2000­Part­2­CNF) to call three times the\nnumber of candidates to seats in preliminary test should be\ncontinued.\n\nFor consideration and order of the Commission.\"\n\nPage 45 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nPOLICY DECISION DATED 25.10.2001\n\n(translated version)\n\nThrough two notifications dated\n09/04/97 of the General Administration Department of the\nGovernment, it has been provided by the State Government\nthat 30 % seats shall be reserved in the concerned cadres for\nthe appointment of women in all the services.

Similarly, 60 vacancies were for the post of RFO of\n\nwhich 18 had to be filled by women candidates of General category.\n\nIn all, 84 general posts were to be filled in of which 26 were reserved\n\nfor female candidates. He would submit that going down the list the\n\nlast candidate at Merit No. 78, who had secured 433 marks was the\n\nyardstick worked out and 10% relaxation for female candidates on\n\nthat basis was counted as 389 for the purpose of yardstick of the\n\nfemale candidates in unreserved category.\n\n4.7 In other words, the GPSC went into each category and the last\n\nmale candidate of the said category was considered and 10%\n\nqualifying standard was relaxed so as to consider the eligibility of a\n\nfemale candidate for being appointed in the respective reserved\n\ncategories against female reservation. While working up such list,\n\nonly 30 women candidates were found qualifying and hence deficit of\n\n21 posts were filled in by transferring such posts male candidates for\n\nrespective categories.\n\n4.8 Mr. Shukla would submit that it is entirely within the domain\n\nPage 53 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nof the GPSC to prescribe for qualifying standards and the findings of\n\nthe learned Single Judge that the GPSC had either no power or that\n\nthe power was utilised arbitrarily, was misconceived.

He would submit that no\n\none had a fundamental right to be appointed because the right\n\nmerely provides for a right to be considered.\n\n4.11 In context of his submission explaining the concept of women\n\nreservation and prescribing the standard of qualifying marks, Mr.\n\nShukla would rely on the decision dated 13.12.2007 in the case of\n\nDr. Mehta Rakshaben Kantilal vs. Gujarat Public Service\n\nCommission and Another (Special Civil Application No.\n\nPage 55 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n25773 of 2007). He would invite the attention of the Court to\n\nrelevant contentions raised by the parties therein, wherein the\n\npetitioner had prayed to quash and set aside alleged norms fixed by\n\nthe GPSC being dehors the advertisement and the recruitment\n\nrules. He would invite the attention of the court to para 16 of the\n\ndecision and submit that fixation of cut­off marks cannot be said to\n\nbe arbitrary. Specific attention was drawn to para 18 of the decision\n\nwherein the court had observed that if there is a relaxation or a\n\nprovision of cut­off marks between reserved category candidates for\n\nentry of female candidates it cannot be said to frustrate female\n\nreservation. He would also invite the court's attention to para 23 of\n\nthe decision. In support of his submissions he also relied on the\n\nfollowing decisions:\n\n(a) Asha M. Barasara v.

He drew the attention of\n\nthe Court to the Affidavit­in­reply of the GPSC and read the same in\n\ncontext of the 'Convenience Note' filed by him in LPA No. 1187 of\n\n2015. He would submit that the appellants of LPA No. 1187 of 2015\n\nwere general category candidates who had been deprived the benefit\n\nof female reservation on account of erroneous implementation of\n\npolicy of reservation for women. He would submit that while\n\ndeclaring the merit list of 25.09.2014, the GPSC had not followed\n\nthe 30% reservation for females as envisaged by the Apex Court in\n\nthe case of\nMamta Bisht\n(supra).\n\n5.1 Mr. Tanna would further submit that GPSC at the relevant\n\ntime was not even entitled to prescribe 10% relaxation in qualifying\n\nmarks for women and thereby transferring the shortfall to be\n\noccupied by male candidates of the respective categories. As far as\n\nthe Letters Patent Appeal filed by the original petitioners, he would\n\nPage 60 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nsubmit that he was aggrieved by the observation of the learned\n\nSingle Judge in para 57(f), which misinterpreted the concept of\n\nhorizontal and compartmentalized reservation taking it as a concept\n\nand an argument which was not found favourable as taking away a\n\nslice from the quota of vertical reservation.\n\n5.2 Mr. Tanna would submit that when sufficient qualified female\n\ncandidates were available, steps should have been taken by the\n\nGPSC to fill in the reserved post in each category with the available\n\nfemale candidates and the contention of Mr. Shukla that the power\n\nof the GPSC was backed by an opinion of the Advocate General\n\ndated 06.10.2001 was misconceived. There was no power with the\n\nCommission to prescribe such qualifying standard. Mr. Tanna in\n\nsupport of his submission would rely on the leading case as he would\n\nput it in the case of\nTamannaben Ashokbhai Desai vs. Shital\n\nAmrutlal Nishar\nrendered in Letters Patent Appeal No. 1910\n\nof 2019 dated 05.08.2020.

He would invite the attention of the\n\nCourt to the operative portion of the learned Single Judge, para\n\n57(k) and submit that he would support the impugned judgement of\n\nthe learned Single Judge.\n\n6.1 Mr. Pujara would submit that the Rules, 1997 provided a\n\nstatutory requirement of 30% (now 33%) reservation for women\n\nunder the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India. He\n\nwould submit that though large number of eligible candidates were\n\navailable in each category, the GPSC selected much less number of\n\nwomen than notified vacancies for them in the final selection list\n\ndated 25.09.2014.\n\n6.2 Mr. Pujara would submit that by not actually selecting the\n\nsufficient number of women for the posts reserved for women as\n\nnotified in the advertisement, the GPSC failed to implement the\n\nstatutory policy of women reservation of the State Government.\n\nGPSC committed illegality by preparing select list and final list on a\n\nwrong premises by applying irrational and illogical formula of fixing\n\nqualifying marks on the basis of the marks obtained by the \"last\n\nPage 64 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nmale candidate\" of the respective category and then granting 10%\n\nrelaxation for selecting women candidate on the reserved quota. In\n\nthe submission of Mr. Pujara, such formula had no legal sanctity as\n\nit was not even contemplated by the statutory rules. The GPSC\n\nbeing a creature of the Constitution under the\nArticle 320\nit must\n\nscrupulously follow the statutory rules. He would invite the\n\nattention of the Court to para 12.2 of the judgement of the learned\n\nSingle Judge.\nIn support of his submissions, Mr. Pujara would rely\n\non the decision in the case of\nRajesh Kumar Daria vs. Rajasthan\n\nPublic Service Commission\n(supra) wherein the Apex Court has\n\nexplained the concept of women reservation and how the same is to\n\nbe implemented.\n\nHe would also rely on the decision of the Apex\n\nCourt in the case of\nState of Punjab vs. Manjit Singh\n[(2003) 11\n\nSCC 559]. He would invite the attention of the Court to para 9\n\nthereof to submit that where no special qualification or any\n\nprescribed standard of efficiency over and above the eligibility\n\ncriteria is provided by the Rules, it would not be for the Commission\n\nto impose any extra qualification.\n\n6.3 Mr. Pujara would also invite the attention of the Court to the\n\nPage 65 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ndecision in the case of\nInder Parkash Gupta vs. State of Jammu\n\nand Kashmir\n[(2004) 6 SCC 786]. He would submit relying on\n\npara 28 of the decision that the Commission must scrupulously\n\nfollow the Proviso to the Rules under\nArticle 309\nand it cannot fix\n\nany \"cut­off marks\" not contemplated under the statutory rules.\n\n6.4 Mr. Pujara would rely on the decision in the case of\nP.V.\n\nIndiresan (2) vs. Union of India\n[2011 (8) SCC 441] which\n\nexplains the concept of \"cut­off marks\".\n\nHe further relied on the\n\ndecision in the case of\nGovernment of Andhra Pradesh vs. P.B\n\nVijayakumar\n[(1995) 4 SCC 520] which provides the spirit of\n\nreservation inasmuch as the reservation in benefit of a person who is\n\nrequired not to compete in equal terms with the open category, their\n\nselection and appointment to the reserved post is independently on\n\ntheir inter­se merit and not as compared with the merits of the\n\ncandidates in the open category. The very purpose of reservation\n\naccording to Mr. Pujara is to protect the weak against the\n\ncompetition of the open category.\n\n7.

The fixing of qualifying standards after\n\nthe announcement of the results, in his submission, has been rightly\n\nupset by the learned Single Judge. He would submit that the\n\nCommission is constituted as a Constitutional Body under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India and must faithfully follow the Rules\n\nand it must select the candidates in accordance with the\n\nExamination Rules. Mr. Oza has relied on the decisions which were\n\ncited by Mr. K.B.

The\n\nsubsequent decision and the modification of the list based on the\n\ndecision of the Apex Court in the case of\nRamesh Ram\n(supra)\n\naccording to Mr. Upadhyaya is flawed.\n\nHe would submit that the\n\nlearned Single Judge has rightly held that the judgment in the case\n\nof\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) is rules specific and would not apply to the\n\nrules as they exist in the State of Gujarat.\n\n9. Mr. Sandeep Limbani, learned Advocate has appeared and\n\nsupported the submissions of the learned Counsel for the GPSC.

Mr. Kanva Antani, learned AGP has appeared for the State.\n\nHe would draw the attention of the Court to the provisions of\n\nArticles 309\nand\nof the Constitution of India and submit that\n\nunder\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution it is for the State to legislate\n\nfor making Rules for the purposes of recruitment whereas for the\n\npurposes of conducting examination it is within the domain of the\n\nPublic Service Commission under\nArticle 320\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia. The concept of recruitment envisages 2 streams (i) Selection\n\nand (ii) Appointment. Selection is undertaken by the Public Service\n\nCommission whereas appointment is made by the State. Mr. Antani\n\nwould invite the attention of the Court to the Examination Rules\n\nand submit that it is within the powers of the Commission to\n\nformulate a policy and the decision of the Commission shall be final.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n11. As reproduced hereinabove, the major bone of contention that\n\nthis Court in these Appeals is called upon to decide is whether the\n\nmethod, procedure and the basis followed and adopted by the GPSC\n\nPage 70 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nfor determining the qualifying standards (described by the GPSC as\n\n\"cut­off marks\") and by adopting such criteria which was not\n\ndeclared and informed to the candidates amounted to changing the\n\nrules of the game. The second consequential issue that, therefore,\n\ndeserves consideration is whether it was open for the GPSC to\n\ntransfer the quota reserved for female candidates to male\n\ncandidates. The question whether transfer of quota of candidates\n\npossessing special qualification is an issue which will be dealt with\n\nin course of a separate LPA which is still pending consideration.\n\n12. Before we embark on this journey of taking a decision on the\n\nissue, it will be in the fitness of things to have a bird's eye view of\n\nthe relevant rules of recruitment that govern the recruitment in\n\nquestion. Rules governing the recruitment of ACF are Assistant\n\nConservator of Forests in Gujarat Forest Service, Class II\n\nRecruitment Rules, 2007 ( for short 'Rules of 2007'). Those\n\nrules provide for recruitment to the service either by way of\n\npromotion and by direct selection on the basis of a result of a\n\ncompetitive examination held for such purpose. Rule 2 of the Rules\n\nof 2007 reads as under:\n\nPage 71 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n\"2.

It is a\n\ncombined competitive examination for recruitment to the post. The\n\nexamination is in two successive stages namely (i) preliminary\n\n(objective type) for selection of candidates for main examination (ii)\n\nMain examination (written and interview test) for final selection of a\n\ncandidate. Rule 9 indicates that the name of the candidates have to\n\nbe arranged by the Commission in the order of merit on the basis of\n\naggregate marks finally awarded to each candidate in the main\n\nPage 77 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nexamination and in that order the Commission shall recommend\n\nthe qualified candidate for appointment to the extent of the number\n\nof vacancies to be filled in.

For the sake of brevity, though it may amount to burdening\n\nthe record, we cannot help but reproduce the reasoning of the\n\nlearned Single Judge on the basis of the affidavit­in­reply of the\n\nGPSC to show how they have worked out reservation in context of\n\nqualifying marks of 10% reservation.\n\n\"18.2 On this count, it is pertinent that for the purpose of\ndetermining the qualifying standard the respondent GPSC\nfirst picked­up the General / Unreserved Category and took\ninto account total number of vacancies in that category.\nThereafter the respondent GPSC started from the candidate at\nthe top in the common merit list (i.e. the candidate with highest\nmarks) and, while descending, it started identifying only male\ncandidates belonging to the said / particular category and\n\nproceeded in descending order by taking into account\n\nmarks of only male candidates in that particular\n\ncategory (i.e. excluding all female candidates/marks\n\nobtained by female candidates in that category) and\n\ncontinued to descend in similar manner until it reached the\nmale candidate who, depending on the number of notified\nvacancies in the particular category, would be the last male\n\nPage 79 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ncandidate required to fill­up the vacancies in that particular\n\ncategory. The marks secured by such last male candidate\n\nof that particular category are treated and adopted and\n\napplied by GPSC as the qualifying marks/standard\n\n(what is described by GPSC as cut­off marks) for the\n\nrespective category. The procedure and method followed by\n\nGPSC is explained by it in paragraphs No.6.2 to 6.4 of its\naffidavit dated 23.2.2015 filed in SCA No.14849 of 2014 and it\nis further explained in para No.2 of its additional affidavit\ndated 24.2.2015.\n\n18.3 Besides this even in the notification dated 25.9.2014\nGPSC itself has admitted and stated that: The candidates at\nRank No...... ST being female candidates have been selected\nafter relaxing the minimum qualifying standard prescribed for\n\nmale candidates of their respective categories. (Emphasis\n\nsupplied)\n\n18.4 From the details mentioned in said affidavits it has\nemerged that for combined (i.e. ACF + RFO) 84 position of\nunreserved / general category, 26 position are reserved (@ 30%\nof total number of notified vacancy for the said category) for\nfemale candidates and for selecting female candidates for said\nposition, the marks secured by the male candidate in general\ncategory whose name is listed at Sr.No.78 in the general /\ncommon merit list is treated as the marks of last candidate in\n\nPage 80 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ngeneral / unreserved category (though only 58 position /\nvacancies are to filled­up) and the marks secured by the said\nmale candidate at Sr.No.78 is recognized as minimum\nqualifying marks/standard for the female candidates in\ngeneral / unreserved category on the premise that the said\ncandidate at Sr.No.78 is last male candidate to enter the\nselection list in genera/unreserved category and the said\nmarks are then adopted and applied as benchmark for\nselection of female candidates and for complying the reserved\nquota. In response to the query, the learned counsel for GPSC\nsubmitted and clarified that the standard/basis which came to\nbe fixed, settled and adopted in above mentioned manner (as\nqualifying marks/standard) is treated as yardstick and\nbenchmark for all purposes including the process and purpose\nof filling­up the reserved quota for women in other three\ncategories as well and for the candidates seeking selection in\nthe quota reserved for persons holding special qualification.\n\n18.5 It is relevant to mention that the stage of finalizing\nselection list and declaring successful candidates was reached\nafter crossing three stages of screening. It is also relevant to\nnote that the respondent GPSC also did not adopt the marks\nsecured by a candidate in particular category regardless or\nirrespective of the fact that such last candidate is male\ncandidate or female candidate but the respondent GPSC\nconsciously started the process by picking up the marks secured\n\nPage 81 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nonly by male candidates in respective categories and proceeded\ngoing downwards while taking into account the marks secured\nby only male candidates and it consciously opted for and\nadopted marks secured by such last male candidate as the\nqualifying standard.\"\n\n13.1 The working of reservation as demonstrated by the learned\n\nSingle Judge in para 18.2 which is reiterated above is at complete\n\nvariance of working of reservation in female category as held in the\n\ncase of\nTamannaben Desai\n(supra) so confirmed by the Apex Court\n\nin the case of\nSaurav Yadav\n(supra).\n\nPara 56 of the decision in the\n\ncase of\nTamannaben Desai\n(supra) which explains proper and\n\ncorrect method of implementing horizontal reservation for women\n\nreads as under:\n\n\"56.

Nothing more is to be done. If there is a\nshortfall of women (say, only 10 women are available in\n\nthe Step 2 List of OC category), 7 more women have to\n\nbe added. The way to do this is to, first, delete the last 7\n\nmale candidates of the Step 2 List. Thereafter, go down\n\nthe Step 1 List after item no. 51, and pick the first 7\n\nwomen (category does not matter). As soon as 7 such\nwomen from Step 1 List are found, they are to be brought\n\nup and added to the Step 2 List to make up for the\n\nshortfall of 7 women.

The illustration given by us deals with\nonly one possible dimension. There could be multiple such\npossibilities. Even going by the present illustration, the first\nfemale candidate allocated in the vertical column for\n\nPage 85 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nScheduled Tribes may have secured higher position than the\ncandidate at Serial No.64. In that event said candidate must\nbe shifted from the category of Scheduled Tribes to Open /\nGeneral category causing a resultant vacancy in the vertical\ncolumn of Scheduled Tribes. Such vacancy must then enure to\nthe benefit of the candidate in the Waiting List for Scheduled\nTribes - Female. The steps indicated by Gujarat High Court\nwill take care of every such possibility. It is true that the\nexercise of laying down a procedure must necessarily be left to\nthe concerned authorities but we may observe that one set out\nin said judgment will certainly satisfy all claims and will not\nlead to any incongruity as highlighted by us in the preceding\nparagraphs.\"\n\n14. What is evident from reading the Examination Rules of 2008 is\n\nthat, while preparing the merit list and recommending the name of\n\nthe qualified candidates for appointment, the Commission has to\n\narrange the names in the order of merit on the basis of aggregate\n\nmarks finally awarded to each candidate in the main Written\n\nExamination and Interview Test. Rule 19 of the Examination Rules\n\nenvisages the discretion of the Commission to prescribe qualifying\n\nstandards. The minimum qualifying standards have to be fixed by\n\nPage 86 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nthe Commission in the preliminary examination prior to the main\n\nexamination and then while calling for the interview on the basis of\n\nthe main examination. On facts, it has been found on reading the\n\nresult dated 25.09.2014 that the Commission has introduced 10%\n\nqualifying standards after preparing the Common Merit List for\n\npurposes of working out female reservation based on the aggregate\n\nmarks of \"last male candidate\" in each category. The learned Single\n\nJudge has specifically held in para 25 of the order that he is not\n\ngoing into the question whether the Commission had power or not\n\nwhat was observed is that what had been done was that the power\n\nhad been used without nexus and it was not sustained about the\n\nmanner in which the process was held. Para 25 at the cost of\n\nrepetition is quoted hereunder:\n\n\"25. For the foregoing reasons and in light of the facts, the\nimpugned method and procedure followed by GPSC and the\nbasis adopted by GPSC for fixing / determining the qualifying\nstandard as well as the qualifying marks/standard\ndetermined and settled and adopted by GPSC are not\nsustainable and deserve to be set aside and are consequently set\naside and as corollary all subsequent and consequential\ndecisions and actions by GPSC which are taken in pursuance\nof and on the basis of such qualifying standard (decided in\n\nPage 87 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nimpugned method) fall and stand vitiated. At this stage, it is\n\nnecessary to further clarify that the action of\n\ndetermining qualifying marks / standard and/or the\n\naction of allowing relaxation therein are, essentially,\n\nnot sustained on account of the manner in which the\n\nsaid process is carried out and the basis which GPSC\n\nadopted and not for want of power. The action of\n\nallowing relaxation is not sustained also because it is\n\ntainted with vice of discrimination and the error of not\n\napplying relevant factors and not for want of power.\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n15. Referring to the file notings produced by Mr. Shukla and read\n\nbefore us in context of the opinion of the Advocate General dated\n\n06.10.2001 quoted above, what is evident is that female reservation\n\nis envisaged under the statutory rules, then in force by virtue of the\n\nNotification of 09.04.1997. Even subsequent amendment of the rules\n\non 14.06.2012 would indicate that the explanation to the rules are in\n\nthe spirit of the judgement of this court in the case of\nRajesh\n\nKumar Daria\n(supra). The reservation of posts for women has to be\n\ndone in consonance with the manner and method as envisaged under\n\nthe Notification dated 14.06.2012.

Manner of applying reservation of posts for\n\nwomen\n\n(1) The reservation of posts for women shall be\nhorizontal and compartmentalized and women selected\non merit within the vertical reservation quota in any\ncategory mentioned in clause (a) to (d) of rule 2 shall be\ncounted against the horizontal reservation for women\nwithin that category.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(i) Horizontal and compartmentalized reservation\nmeans respective quota of posts reserved in favour of\nwomen under Clause (3) of\narticle 15\nof the Constitution\nof India made in public services and posts in connection\nwith the affairs of the state that interlocks with the\nvertical reservation.\n\n(ii) Vertical reservation means reservation in favour of\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other\nBackward Classes under clause (4) of\narticle 16\nof the\nConstitution of India.\n\n(2) The reservation of posts for women mentioned in\nrule 2 shall be applied ­\n\n(i) by first filling up the quota of the categories\n\nPage 89 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nmentioned in clause (a) to (d) of rule 2 in order of merit;\nand then\n\n(ii) finding out the number of candidates among them\nwho belong to the respective reservation category and if\nthe number of candidates in such lists is equal to or more\nthan the number of special reservation quota of women,\nthen it shall not be necessary for further selection\n\ntowards the reservation quota of women. Only if there\n\nis any shortfall of the women candidates in any\n\nsuch category, the requisite number of women\n\nbelonging to such category shall have to be taken\n\nby deleting the corresponding number of\n\ncandidates from the bottom of the list relating to\n\nsuch category.\"\n\n16. Reading of the aforesaid provision makes it abundantly clear\n\nthat if there is a shortfall of women candidates, the requisite number\n\nof women shall have to be taken by deleting the corresponding\n\nnumber of candidates from the bottom of the list relating to such\n\ncategories. The working of Commission in preparing the merit list of\n\n25.09.2014 is in direct contravention of this provision. By\n\nintroducing the so called policy decision of 10% relaxation viz­a­viz\n\nthe last male candidate in each category, the said policy decision has\n\nworked in direct conflict of the Reservation Rule under\nArticle 309\nof\n\nPage 90 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nthe Constitution of India namely the Women Reservation Rules.\n\nConsequentially, the action of transferring the deficit posts filled in -\n\n21 in number by male candidates, therefore, in our opinion is not\n\nsustainable and has rightly been set aside by learned Single Judge.\n\nWe concur with the said view.\n\n17. The Circular dated 22.05.1997 envisages a position of filling in\n\na post of a female reserved category candidate by a male only in the\n\nevent a female candidate is not available.\nIn the facts of the present\n\ncase, what has been found by the learned Single Judge and which\n\nhas been so demonstrated by the pleadings on record, especially the\n\naffidavit­in­reply of the GPSC is that the merit list has been so\n\noperated contrary to the manner in which it is explained in the case\n\nof\nTamannaben Desai\n(supra).\n\n18. As far as the decision cited by Mr. Shukla in the case of Dr.\n\nMehta Rakshaben (supra), reproduction of relevant para of the\n\ndecision in the case of Dr. Mehta Rakshaben (supra) shall be\n\npertinent. Para 18 of the said decision is reproduced hereinbelow:\n\nPage 91 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n\"18. The reservation of female candidates in open category\n\ncannot be equated with the reservation made for SC­ST or\n\nOBC in any recruitment. The reservation of female\ncandidates is reservation within the reservation as well as\n\nreservation for open category. Therefore, when the\n\nreservation is there in the open category, in normal\n\ncircumstances, it is also open to the recruitment authority to\n\nfix up the same merit, may be between male candidates\n\nor female candidates and between equal merits,\n\npriority may be given to the female candidates for\n\noffering appointment or for inclusion in the select list.\n\nHowever, if a reasonable relaxation is given for considering\n\nmore number of female candidates for entering the zone of\n\nconsideration, the same also cannot be said as arbitrary\nor unreasonable. In the present case, it appears that for the\nmale candidates GPSC has provided cut­off mark in open\n\ncategory at 152, whereas for female candidates, such\nstandard of cut­off mark is lowered down and is fixed at\n134, which has resulted into inclusion of about seven\nmore female candidates in the zone of consideration for\ninterview. Therefore, when the attempt is made for permitting\n\nentry of more female candidates in comparison to the posts\n\navailable for female candidates, the action cannot be said as\n\nfrustrating or contrary to the policy for reservation made for\n\nfemale candidates. Further, it is an admitted position that\nnone of the petitioners, not called for interview, has secured\n\n134 or more marks at the elimination test. Therefore, the cut­\n\nPage 92 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\noff mark is relaxed for female candidates to enter the zone of\n\nconsideration for interview. \"\n\n18.1 In the facts of the said case, the court found that when an\n\nattempt is made for permitting entry of more female candidates in\n\ncomparison to the posts available for female candidates, the action\n\ncannot be said to be frustrating or contrary to the policy of\n\nreservation made for female candidates. In other words, the policy\n\nwas approved as it worked in favour of female reservation whereas\n\nin the facts of the present case, the learned Single Judge found that\n\nit worked in contravention or constriction of the policy of reservation\n\nand therefore even the learned Single Judge held and rightly so that\n\nthe decision in the case of Dr. Mehta Raksha (supra) would not be\n\napplicable to the facts of the present case.\n\n18.2 Even in the decision in the case of Prajapati Ishawarbhai\n\nJoitaram (supra), the learned Single Judge rightly held that the\n\ndecision would not be applicable to the facts of the case. The\n\nquestion there was also in relation to horizontal reservation but was\n\nin context of providing for qualifying standards for entering the zone\n\nfor the purposes of interview and not after the entire exercise based\n\nPage 93 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nfor filtering on the basis of the examination, in the context of the\n\npresent rules, especially Rules 9 and 19, was over. The judgment,\n\ntherefore, would not be applicable. Paragraphs no. 4 to 6 of the\n\ndecision in the case of Prajapati Ishwarbhai Joitaram (supra)\n\nread as under:\n\n\"4. However, the principal contention raised on behalf of the\nappellants is that the cut­off marks for the purpose of inclusion in the\nselect list or waiting list should have been fixed by the respondents at\nthe time when the written examinations are held and it is not open to\nthe respondents to fix the cut­off marks at the later stage. It was also\nsubmitted that even if the cut­off marks are fixed by the respondents\nfor the respective category of the candidates in the case of horizontal\nreservation for Ex­Servicemen, in order to accommodate all Ex­\nServicemen upto the post advertised, it is required for the\nrespondents to go below the cut­off marks and offer employment for\nthe purpose of selection. The learned counsel in support of his\nsubmission, has relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in the case\nof\nRajesh Kumar Daria Vs. Rajasthan Public Service Commission\n\nreported at (2007) 8 SCC 785 for explaining the method and manner\nof applying the horizontal reservation and the selection of the\ncandidates by application of horizontal reservation.\n\n5. Whereas, on behalf of the respondents, it has been submitted\nthat initially the cut­off marks were not prescribed for the simple\n\nPage 94 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nreason that it would be unknown as to how many candidates may\npass the written examination. It is only after the written examination\nis conducted, if the interview is to be taken, normally the number of\ncandidates who may be called for interview, may be three times the\nnumber of post advertised and therefore, the cut­off mark is to be\ntreated as that of the person who is last in such list for the purpose of\ninterview. Whereas in case of posts wherein interview is not provided\nand the selection is to be made on the basis of the performance at the\nwritten test, keeping in view the number of vacancies and the\navailable candidates, the cut­off mark is being provided. It was\nsubmitted that so far as the appellants herein are concerned, who are\nin the category of Ex­Servicemen, for which there is reservation of\n10% in horizontal manner, initially, there was no relaxation\nprovided. However, subsequently, as the Division Bench of this Court\nvide order dated 19.12.2012, passed in the present appeal, observed\nfor consideration on the aspect of relaxation, the Recruitment Board\nhas considered the same and relaxation has been granted to the\nextent of 5% so far as Ex­Servicemen are concerned in comparison to\nthe cut­off marks of the candidates of the respective category, be it\nGeneral, SC, ST or SEBC, as the case may be. It was submitted that\nfor the purpose of inclusion of the name of any candidate who is\nfalling in the horizontal reservation, such candidate has to meet with\nthe criteria of cut­off marks provided for the respective category\nsubject to relaxation for Ex­Servicemen and if the candidate is to be\nconsidered scoring less than the cut­off marks, it would adversely\naffect the merits of the selection and ultimately efficiency of the\n\nPage 95 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ncandidate concerned and such would adversely affect the\nadministration. It was submitted that the facts and figures which are\ngiven by way of the affidavit­in­reply in the present LPA makes it\nclear that all care has been taken by the respondents to see that all\ncandidates of the reserved category are included in the list, but\nsubject to the requirement that one has scored marks above the cut­off\nmarks provided for such category with the relaxation of 5% for Ex­\nServicemen which is in the present case.\n\n6. The first aspect of providing cut­off marks shows that the\nrecruitment process is governed by the Police Sub­Inspector, Class III\nLevel Cadres Posts (Combines Competitive Examination for Director\nRecruitment) Rules, 2011, ( Recruitment Rules for short) copy\nwhereof is produced as annexure with the affidavit­in­reply dated\n05.11.2012 filed by Shri Ashish Bhatia, Chairman of Recruitment\nBoard. Therefore, so far as the recruitment to the post of Police\nInspector is concerned, it would be governed by the aforesaid\nRecruitment Rules. Rule 4(2)(c) of the Recruitment Rules reads as\nunder:\n\n\"The candidates who qualify in the written examination shall\nbe called for an interview. The number of candidates called for\ninterview shall ordinarily be three times the number of\nrequisioned.\"\n\nTherefore, if the number of candidates to be called for interview by\nexpress language of the Recruitment Rules should be equivalent to\nthree times the number of post advertised. Only those candidates who\n\nPage 96 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nstand on merit upto three times the number of vacancies will be\nrequired to be called for interview and under these circumstances, the\nlast candidate in the list who secured particular marks at the written\ntest could be termed as qualifying marks/cut­off marks of the\ncandidates for the post of Police Inspector. Therefore, if the\nrespondents have fixed the qualifying marks accordingly keeping in\nview the said aspects, it cannot be said that there is no power or\nauthority with the recruiting board to provide for qualifying marks.\nIt is hardly required to be stated that fixation of qualifying marks for\nentering into the select list and/or waiting list is essentially the\ndomain of recruiting agency or the authority conducting the\nexamination. For example, if the number of posts are 50 and the\ncandidates appearing at the written test are 500 and about 300\ncandidates have passed the written test, that does not mean that all\nthe 300 candidates would be eligible for the purpose of interview. It is\nopen to the recruiting agency or the authority conducting the\nexamination to fix the cut­off marks which is popularly known as\nqualifying marks for the purpose of entering in the zone of\nconsideration for the purpose of interview. In the present case, it is\nthree times the number of posts advertised. Therefore, it is only after\nthe result of the written test, the recruiting agency may be in a\nposition to know that how many candidates are to be interviewed and\nthe qualifying marks or the cut­off marks may be fixed. Such cannot\nbe termed as beyond the power or competence of the recruiting agency\nfor providing of the cut­off marks or qualifying marks for the purpose\nof interview.\"\n\nPage 97 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n19. As held by the Apex Court in the case of\nInder Parkash\n\nGupta\n(supra), it will be worthwhile to reproduce para 28 of the\n\ndecision which reads as under:\n\n\"28. The Jammu & Kashmir Medical (Gazetted) Service\nRecruitment Rules, 1979 admittedly were issued under Section\n124 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution which is in pari\nmateria with\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India. The said\nrules are statutory in nature. The Public Service Commission is\na body created under the Constitution. Each State constitutes\nits own Public Service Commission to meet the Constitutional\nrequirement for the purpose of discharging its duties under the\nConstitution. Appointment to service in a State must be in\nconsonance with the constitutional provisions and in\nconformity with the autonomy and freedom of executive action.\nSection 133 of the Constitution imposes duty upon the State to\nconduct examination for appointment to the services of the\nState. The Public Service Commission is also required to be\nconsulted on the matters enumerated under Section 133. While\ngoing through the selection process the Commission, however,\nmust scrupulously follow the statutory rules operating in the\nfield. It may be that for certain purposes, for example, for the\npurpose of short­listing, it can lay down its own procedure. The\nCommission, however, must lay down the procedure strictly in\n\nPage 98 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nconsonance with the statutory rules. It can not take any action\nwhich per se would be violative of the statutory rules or makes\nthe same inoperative for all intent and purport. Even for the\npurpose of short­listing, the Commission cannot fix any kind of\ncut off marks.\"\n\n19.1 On facts of the present case, it has been found that the\n\nprocedure\nlaid down by\nthe Commission did not have the support of\n\nthe statutory rules and therefore the decision in the case of\nInder\n\nParkash Gupta\n(supra) would apply on facts of the present case.\n\n19.2 Even the decision in the case of\nManjit Singh\n(supra), para 9\n\nwhich is reproduced hereunder would indicate that the Commission\n\nwould have no power to impose a qualification which was not in\n\nconsonance with providing for efficiency of administration.\n\n\"9. In the present case, the stand of the appellant\n\nCommission is that for medical services where the\n\nmembers of service have to deal with the health and life\n\nof the people, they must have some minimum standard of\n\nefficiency and it is the bounden duty of the Commission to\n\nensure the same. It is perhaps with this view in mind that the\n\nCommission fixed 45% minimum qualifying cut­off marks for\n\nPage 99 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ngeneral category candidates and 40% cut­off marks for\n\nScheduled Caste candidates. We feel, here lies the fallacy in\n\nthe whole reasoning of the Commission. It is no doubt true\n\nthat the Commission is an independent and autonomous body\nand has to work without influence of any authority or the\ngovernment. It is rather under duty to act independently. But\n\nat the same time the fact cannot be lost sight of that the State\n\nGovernment is competent to lay down the qualifications\n\nfor differernt posts, and frame rules for the purpose or\n\ntake policy decisions which may of course not be against\n\nthe law. In this context, we may refer to the provisions\n\ncontained under\nArticle 320\nof the Constitution. It reads as\nunder :\n\n\" 320. ­ Functions of Public Service Commissions­\n\n1. It shall be the duty of the Union and the State\npublic Service Commissions to conduct examinations for\nappointments to the services of the Union and the\nservices of the State respectively.\n\n2.

The observations in paragraph no.812 of\nIndra Sawhney\n\n(supra) are relevant for our purposes and are extracted herein\nbelow:­\n\n\"812 .We are also of the opinion that this rule of 50%\napplies only to reservations in favour of backward\nclasses made under\nArticle 16(4).\nA little\nclarification is in order at this juncture: all\nreservations are not of the same nature. There are\ntwo types of reservations, which may, for the sake of\nconvenience, be referred to as 'vertical reservations'\nand 'horizontal reservations'. The reservations in\nfavour of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and\nother backward classes [under\nArticle 16(4)]\nmay be\ncalled vertical reservations whereas reservations in\nfavour of physically handicapped [under Clause (1)\nof\nArticle 16]\ncan be referred to as horizontal\n\nreservations. Horizontal reservations cut across\n\nthe vertical reservations that is called inter­\n\nlocking reservations. To be more precise, suppose\n\n3% of the vacancies are reserved in favour of\nphysically handicapped persons; this would be a\nreservation relatable to Clause (1) of\nArticle 16.\nThe\npersons selected against this quota will be placed in\nthe appropriate category; if he belongs to S.C.\ncategory he will be placed in that quota by making\n\nPage 108 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nnecessary adjustments; similarly, if he belongs to\nopen competition (O.C.) category, he will be placed\nin that category by making necessary adjustments.\n\nEven after providing for these horizontal\nreservations, the percentage of reservations in favour\nof backward class of citizens remains ­ and should\nremain ­ the same. This is how these reservations\nare worked out in several States and there is no\nreason not to continue that procedure.\"\n\n30. Thus, it is evident that the reservation in favour of the\nphysically handicapped, dependents of freedom fighters and\nEx­servicemen is relatable to\nArticle 16 (1)\nand can be referred\nto as horizontal reservation. Such reservation has been granted\non the principle of reasonable classification embraced in Article\n\n16(1) for ensuring attainment of the equality of\n\nopportunity assured by it. It is just the same as Article 14\n\nwhich permits reasonable classification on the doctrine of\nequality enshrined in it.\n\n31. As has been held in\nIndra Sawhney\n(supra) noted above,\nthe persons selected against the quota of physically\nhandicapped, dependents of freedom fighters and Ex­\nservicemen are to be placed in the appropriate category to\nwhich they belong by making necessary adjustment so that the\nrule of 50% (percentage of reservation) is adhered to.

Special reservations in favour of\nphysically handicapped, women etc., under\nArticles\n16(1)\nor 15(3) are 'horizontal reservations'. Where a\nvertical reservation is made in favour of a backward\nclass under\nArticle 16(4)\n, the candidates belonging\nto such backward class, may compete for non­\nreserved posts and if the}' are appointed to the non­\nreserved posts on their own merit, their numbers\nwill not be counted against the quota reserved for\nthe respective backward class. Therefore, if the\nnumber of SC candidates, who by their own merit,\nget selected to open competition vacancies, equals or\n\nPage 112 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\neven exceeds the percentage of posts reserved for SC\ncandidates, it cannot be said the reservation quota\nfor SCs has been filled. The entire reservation quota\nwill be intact and available in addition to those\nselected under Open Competition category. [Vide ­\n\nIndira Sawhney\n(Supra),\nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of\nPunjab\n,\n1995 (2) SCC 745), Union of India v. Virpal\nSingh Chauvan\n, 1995 (\n6) SCC 684 and Ritesh R.\nSah v. Dr. Y.L. Yamul\n, 1996 (3) SCC 253)]. But the\naforesaid principle applicable to vertical (social)\nreservations will not apply to horizontal (special)\nreservations. Where a special reservation for women\nis provided within the social reservation for\nScheduled Castes, the proper procedure is first to fill\nup the quota for scheduled castes in order of merit\nand then find out the number of candidates among\nthem who belong to the special reservation group of\n'Scheduled Castes­Women'. If the number of women\nin such list is equal to or more than the number of\nspecial reservation quota, then there is no need for\nfurther selection towards the special reservation\nquota. Only if there is any shortfall, the requisite\nnumber of scheduled caste women shall have to be\ntaken by deleting the corresponding number of\ncandidates from the bottom of the list relating to\nScheduled Castes. To this extent, horizontal\n\nPage 113 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\n(special) reservation differs from vertical (social)\nreservation. Thus women selected on merit within\nthe vertical reservation quota will be counted\nagainst the horizontal reservation for women.\"\n\n35.\nArticle 16(4)\ncontemplates vertical (social) reservation for\nSC/ST/OBC, which cannot exceed 50% of the total vacancies.\nThese reservations are not communal reservation, therefore,\ncandidates belonging to the SC/ST/OBC may compete for non­\nreserved/open category (OC) post and if they get selected on the\nOC post on merit, their numbers will not be counted against\nthe reserved quota for the respective social class. The entire\nreservation quota shall remain intact and be available in\naddition to those selected under OC.\n\n36. The principle applicable to horizontal (special) reservation\nis different and distinct from the principle applicable to\nvertical reservation. The special reservation provided to\nwomen, Ex­servicemen etc., under\nArticles 15(3)\nand\n16(1)\nis\nhorizontal reservation. Horizontal reservation cuts across the\nvertical reservation, otherwise, it will be vertical reservation\nbreaching the 50% bench mark, which is prohibited. The\nhorizontal reservation is provided to the special class of\npersons i.e. Ex­ servicemen/dependents of freedom fighters\nirrespective of their social class SC/ST/OBC. Such persons on\nbeing selected in the OC or in SC/ST/OBC quota will\nnecessarily be counted against the vacancy reserved for them\non horizontal basis irrespective of the social category to which\n\nPage 114 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nthey belong for the reason that the persons belonging to special\nclass may constitute a class in themselves, but as a class they\ndo not enjoy the benefit of vertical reservation. They have not\nbeen classified as backward class. They would, therefore, have\nto be adjusted in the social category to which they belong after\nmaking necessary adjustment. For instance, 10 posts of Ex­\nservicemen are to be filled up on horizontal reservation basis\nand if that many number of Ex­servicemen are included in the\nmerit list of selected candidates prepared vertically i.e.\nOC/SC/ ST/OBC, then nothing further is required to be done.\nBut against 10 Ex­servicemen only 5 could make it to the merit\nlist, then in that event 5 Ex­servicemen, if available, will have\nto be adjusted in the respective social category i.e.\nOC/OBC/ST/ST to which they belong by replacing the last\nmale candidate from that category. If the suitable Ex­\nservicemen are not available then as per the impugned rule, the\nvacancy is to be carried forward.\n\n40. It is the action of the Recruitment Board at the time of\ndocument verification that has given rise to the present\npetition. At the time of physical verification of documents, the\ncandidates who had qualified in PET/PST in different\ncategories were to be called for physical verification of\ndocuments in such numbers as prescribed under the Rules. The\nRecruitment Board has fixed cut off marks for unreserved\ncategory and other reserved categories where there were more\n\nPage 115 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ncandidates than the number of vacancies. This is a fair and\nreasonable approach taken by the Recruitment Board. In fact,\nit would be the only mode for the Recruitment Board to proceed\nwhere number of candidates who had qualified in PET/PST\nwere more than number of vacancies in different categories.\nBut where there were less number of candidates than the\nvacancies available, there would be no question of fixing any\ncut off marks at the stage of physical verification of documents.\nBut surprisingly, the Recruitment Board even for the categories\nwhere there were lesser number of candidates than the posts\navailable for that category, has fixed cut off marks equivalent\nto the unreserved category of male and female and all reserved\ncategories under the vertical reservation. This meant that the\ncandidates falling under the horizontal reservation were to\ncompete or perform better than those selected candidates in\nvertical category. This is where the petitioners were aggrieved\nand have approached this Court. This arbitrariness is because\nof the instructions issued by the Recruitment Board dated\n03.05.2019.\n\n45. When the time came to call the appellants for the\nverification of their documents, the Board introduced the\nconcept of qualifying marks. Clause 10 of the advertisement\nprovides that relaxation may be given to the Ex­servicemen if\nsufficient number of candidates are unable to obtain the\nminimum qualifying marks. It is suggestive of the fact that the\n\nPage 116 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nrelaxation, which was intended to be given as per the condition\nof the recruitment was in context with the minimum qualifying\nmarks i.e. 40% as\nreferred to above\nand not the qualifying\nmarks, that may be fixed by the Board for other category of the\ncandidates for the purpose of preparing the final select list on\nmerit. Clause 10 in the advertisement has been provided with a\npurpose and with definite intention. The intention is to provide\nemployment to the Ex­servicemen and to call for as many\ncandidates as possible from the category of Ex­servicemen\nagainst the reserved posts.\nIn this context, the decision of the\nSupreme Court\nreferred to above\nin the case of\nP.V. Indresan\nand others\n(supra) assumes significance. The respondents\n\nfaltered at this stage. The respondents relied upon Rule 6A\n\nfor the purpose of providing qualifying marks\n\napplicable even to the Ex­servicemen. We have already\n\nquoted Rule 6A of the 1975 Rules above. It is stated\n\ntherein that in the case of direct recruitment, if\n\nsufficient number of candidates belonging to the\n\ncategory of Ex­servicemen are not available on the basis\n\nof general standard to fill all the vacancies reserved for\n\nthem, the candidates belonging to the category of Ex­\n\nservicemen may be selected under a relaxed standard of\n\nselection to make up the deficiency in the reserved quota\n\nsubject to the condition that such relaxation should not\n\naffect the level of performance of such candidates. This\n\nRule 6A rather is apparently making a provision for\n\nPage 117 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nselecting Ex­servicemen under the relaxed standard to make up\n\nthe deficiency. This Rule 6A cannot be read to nullify the\n\nappointment of the reserved category of Ex­servicemen. If\n\nthe stand of the respondents is accepted, the very\n\npurpose of horizontal reservation would stand\n\nfrustrated. It is settled law that the horizontal\n\nreservation has to be provided by cutting across\n\namongst the vertical reservation and if a candidate\n\nhaving a right of selection under any of the horizontal\n\nreservation categories, secures lesser marks than the\n\nlast candidate in the vertical reservations category, the\n\ncandidate from horizontal reservation shall be pulled\n\nup for filling up the last seat in that category of vertical\n\nreservation. The benefit of horizontal reservation could\n\nnot have been denied to the appellants herein merely\n\nbecause the last candidate in the select list was higher\n\nin merit even after providing 20% relaxation to the Ex­\n\nservicemen. The provisions of\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution\n\nshall not be attracted for filling the seats amongst the\nreservationists of the horizontal category vis­a­vis the vertical\ncategory.\"\n\n19.4 In other words, even the Division Bench of this Court,\n\nconsidering various decisions cited before it has held that the\n\nconcept of qualifying marks in \"horizontal reservation\" cannot work\n\nPage 118 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nin a manner so as to restrict the right of selection of a candidate who\n\nis otherwise entitled to an appointment in the horizontal category.\n\n19.5 Thus, we are of the opinion that the GPSC at the time of\n\npreparing the final merit list, in the present case, could not have\n\napplied the criteria of minimum qualifying marks. The action of the\n\nGPSC in prescribing qualifying standard for female candidates for\n\nreserved quota on the basis of the marks secured by \"last male\n\ncandidate\" of the respective category and then granting 10%\n\nrelaxation at the time of final selection list is dehors the Statutory\n\nRules.\n\n20. On all these counts therefore, the directions issued by the\n\nlearned Single Judge in para 57 of the decision, as quoted in\n\nparagraph no. 3.7 hereinabove, especially in (a), (b), (c), (g), (k) stand\n\nconfirmed. As far as the observations made in para 57 (f) that the\n\nhorizontal reservation cannot be maintained by taking away a slice\n\nfrom quota of vertical reserevation is held to be contrary to spirit of\n\nhorizontal and compartmental reservation in light of the decision in\n\nthe case of\nRajesh Kumar Daria\n(supra).

No costs.\n\n(PER : HON'BLE DR. JUSTICE VINEET KOTHARI)\nCONCURRING :\n\n1. I concur and respectfully agree with the view expressed by\n\nlearned Brother Justice Biren Vaishnav. I may add the following :\n\n2. The purpose of providing 30% Horizontal Reservation to\n\nwomen in the Recruitment Process for Forest Department for the\n\npost of Assistant Conservator of Forest and Range Forest Officer was\n\nto ensure appointment of women to the extent of 30% of total\n\nvacancies in each category notified by the Advertisement dated\n\n1.3.2010. The said avowed object of appointment / presence of 30%\n\nwomen in the different categories in number of posts notified on\n\n1.3.2010 was defeated by GPSC by the so called Policy Decision\n\ndated 25.10.2001 based on the opinion of learned Advocate General\n\ndated 6.10.2001 to introduce the relaxation of 10% of minimum cut­\n\noff marks computed on the basis of last cut­off marks for the Male in\n\nPage 121 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\neach category. This linkage of relaxation for women to Male's cut­off\n\nmarks had no rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved. The\n\nre­entry of males on the posts reserved for women to the extent of\n\n30% on the basis that the women candidates even on such lower and\n\nrelaxed criteria fixed of cut­off marks for women on the basis of\n\npolicy decision of GPSC were not available, was nothing but taking\n\nby the left hand what was given by the right hand to the women\n\nfolks in the said Recruitment Process. This was not only contrary to\n\nthe law\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in the case of\nSaurav\n\nYadav\n(Supra) approving the Division Bench's decision of this\n\nCourt in the case of\nTamanna Ashokkumar Desai\n(Supra) which\n\nhas meticulously laid down the step­wise entry of women candidates\n\nin the Horizontal Reservation in compartmentalized manner, but\n\nalso such fixation of lower cut­off marks for women category by the\n\nGPSC without any prior Notification or clarity in the Advertisement\n\nor in the Rules promulgated by the State, was in our opinion self­\n\ndefeating exercise which violated\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia i.e. right of equality in consideration.\n\n3. The said policy decision based on the opinion of the learned\n\nAdvocate General in different circumstances as quoted elsewhere\n\nPage 122 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ncould not be applied in the present Recruitment process for Forest\n\nDepartment at the time of preparation of the final recommendations\n\nfor the appointments by GPSC and it was totally uncalled for. The\n\nvery concept of equality without any discrimination on the basis of\n\ngender, in our opinion, was violated by linking the minimum cut­off\n\nand qualifying marks for women category to the lowest cut­off marks\n\nof the male category. This comparison and linkage per se is gender\n\ndiscrimination and unnecessarily views females as inferior mortals\n\nor less intelligent than males, which they are not. An independent\n\nlower cut off with relaxation, prescribed at the beginning of\n\nrecruitment process could be understood but the very idea of linking\n\nit to the lowest cut off marks in Males category, in our opinion, is\n\nabhorrent and unpalatable idea. The relaxation of marks to support\n\nand ensure full entry on Horizontal Reservation for women is a State\n\npolicy to ensure the equality, but not by comparing their IQ level\n\nwith males as if later is superior. The Constitution not only\n\nguarantees equality without discrimination on the basis of gender\n\nbut, the real equality could be achieved by making the horizontal\n\nentry of the women to the full extent of 30% of seats reserved for\n\nthem, only if such 30% posts were actually filled up by the qualified\n\nPage 123 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nfemale candidates available in all the categories. They were all\n\nqualified and faced interviews and were not otherwise rejected. The\n\nonly sledge or axe which fell on the unfortunate women folks in the\n\npresent recruitment process, 21 in number, who were removed\n\nfrom the list of selected candidates finally on the basis of aforesaid\n\narbitrary fixation of 10% relaxation of cut­off marks by GPSC. They\n\nwere not the candidates otherwise without the merit and\n\nqualifications. Their appointment would not have breached the\n\nnorms and bar of efficiency and merit through the bottom.\n\n4. The power to fix cut­off marks with the GPSC is not in doubt\n\nbut, the manner and point of time when it was done is questionable\n\nin the present case and cannot be sustained, since it was done at the\n\nfag end without prior knowledge and notification to public at large\n\nincluding the candidates, who appeared in the said Selection\n\nprocess.\n\n5. We are of the considered opinion that the law as now settled\n\nby the Supreme Court and the Division Bench of this Court in the\n\ncase of\nTamanna Ashokkumar Desai\n(Supra) has to be\n\nimplemented in true letter and spirit meticulously to achieve the\n\nPage 124 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nobject of giving 30% reservation to women provided under the\n\nReservation Rules promulgated by the State de facto by their actual\n\nappointments to the extent of 30% of total seats and to achieve the\n\nobject of real equality for women candidates vis­a­vis the male\n\ncandidates. The number of females present in Select List has to be\n\n30% of total vacancies and their actual appointment was necessary,\n\nwhich has been prevented by introducing this 10% relaxation of\n\nmarks with reference to bottom Male category marks illogically. The\n\nreliance placed by learned counsel for the GPSC on the previous\n\nSupreme Court decisions for admission to the medical colleges is not\n\nopportune and exactly applicable to the Recruitment Process in the\n\npresent case in the Forest Department, where the question of life\n\nand health of the public at large to be handled by Doctors, who\n\nqualified in that process is not the scenario here, when the\n\nRecruitment Process for Assistant Conservator of Forest or Range\n\nForest Officer is being considered.\n\n6. Today, with the advancement of Education, Technology and\n\nWomen Empowerment in India, the women folks are entering the\n\npublic service from the post of Peon to the post of Pilots for Fighter\n\nPlanes, Scientist, Doctors, CAs and Lawyers being other lot of\n\nPage 125 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nprofessionals and with so many IT professionals in both genders,\n\nthey are doing great service to the Nation and their equality is not\n\nnow a far­fetched dream in our Country but a stark reality.\n\n7. The reservation provided to women folks in the Recruitment\n\nProcess as of now besides their entry on the basis of their merit by\n\nway of Horizontal Reservation cannot be permitted to be defeated by\n\nthe policy decision taken on the file notings of the GPSC, as was\n\ndone in the present case. Therefore, we cannot countenance the\n\nstand of the GPSC taken in the present case before us and we fully\n\naffirm the view of the learned Single Judge and with the detailed\n\nreasons and discussions given in the present Judgment by the\n\nBrother Justice Biren Vaishnav, J., with which I fully concur with\n\nthe reasons and the final conclusions and with a direction to the\n\nGPSC to implement the judgment of this Court in the case of\n\nTamanna Ashokkumar Desai\n(Supra) as affirmed by the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nSaurav Yadav\n(Supra), the GPSC\n\nshould revise the Recommendations List accordingly and the\n\nconsequential appointments may be given to the women category\n\nand the males who were appointed under the interim orders of this\n\nCourt in 21 posts reserved and required to be filled by women\n\nPage 126 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\ncategory in this selection process will naturally have to make way for\n\nsuch eligible women candidates. No equity or continuation in service\n\ncan be claimed by such displaced 21 male category persons.\n\n8. However, if the State considers it to be possible and services of\n\nsuch persons are required by the State, they may either be employed\n\nby the Forest Department on contractual basis and may be offered\n\nanother opportunity to again compete in the fresh Selection or\n\nRecruitment Process to be held by the GPSC in the next Selection\n\nProcess upon vacancies arising. However, they cannot claim any\n\nright of continuity in the service on the post of Assistant Forest\n\nConservator or Range Forest Officer, as of now, merely because they\n\nwere appointed temporarily under the interim orders of this Court,\n\nwhich will stand obliterated by this final judgment and no right of\n\ncontinuity of service can be said to have been vested with such male\n\ncandidates, 21 in number, who were temporarily appointed on the\n\nposts reserved for women category subject to final decision in these\n\nAppeals and the entire process will be governed by the law laid down\n\nherein­above and in the case of\nTamanna Ashokkumar Desai\n\n(Supra) by the Division Bench of this Court as affirmed by the\n\nPage 127 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nSupreme Court in\nSaurav Yadav\n(Supra).\n\n9.\nIncidentally and luckily, before we could sign off and\n\npronounce this Judgment, we came across the Judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court pronounced on 25.3.2021 in WPC No.1109 of 2020\n\n(\nNitisha v. Union of India\n), in which reiterating the concern of the\n\nSupreme Court for gender equality in the case of\nSecretary,\n\nMinistry of Defence v. Babita Puniya & Others\ndated\n\n17.2.2020, reported in (2020) 7 SCC 469 in which the Supreme\n\nCourt directed grant of Permanent Commissions to Women, who\n\nwere engaged in Army in Short Service Commissions (SSC) in its\n\nlandmark Judgment in which the following epoch making\n\nobservations were made by Hon'ble Dr.Justice D. Y.\n\nChandrachud for the Bench, resounding the Constitutional spirit\n\nof equality without any gender discrimination in the following\n\nterms :\n\n\"Seventy years after the birth of a post­colonial independent\n\nState, there is still a need for change in attitudes and\n\nmindsets to recognise the commitment to the values of the\n\nConstitution. The submissions advanced in the note tendered\nto the Supreme Court are based on sex stereotypes premises on\n\nPage 128 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nassumptions about socially ascribed roles of gender which\n\ndiscriminate against women. Underlying the statement\n\nthat it is a \"greater challenge\" for women officers to meet the\nhazards of service \"owing to their prolonged absence during\npregnancy, motherhood and domestic obligations towards their\nchildren and families\" is a strong stereotype which assumes\nthat domestic obligations rest solely on women. Reliance on the\n\"inherent physiological differences between men and women\"\n\nrests in a deeply entrenched stereotypical and\n\nconstitutionally flawed notion that women are the\n\n\"weaker\" sex and may not undertake tasks that are \"too\n\narduous\" for them. Arguments founded on the physical\n\nstrengths and weaknesses of men and women and on\nassumptions about women in the social context of marriage\nand family do not constitute a constitutionally valid basis for\ndenying equal opportunity to women officer.\"\n\nIn the Judgment pronounced on 25.3.2021, the same Hon'ble\n\nJudge reiterated the concern of Supreme Court in the following\n\nwords :\n\n\"We must recognize here, that the structures of our society\n\nhave been created by males for males. Therefore, certain\n\nstructures which may appear to be facially harmless are an\n\nindication of insidious patriarchal system. A facially\n\nequal application of laws to unequal parties is farce, when law\n\nPage 129 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nis structured to cater to male standpoint. Superficial face\n\nof Equality does not stand true to the principles\n\nenshrined in the Constitution.\"\n\nWe cannot emphasize more or add anything more to apply the\n\nsame Constitutional spirit to support our aforesaid view.\n\n10. Before we part with, we would humbly place on record our\n\nacknowledgement of the guidance given by the judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in the case of\nTamanna Ashokkumar\n\nDesai\n(Supra) where the Author of\nthe said judgment\n(Hon'ble\n\nMr.Justice J.B. Pardiwala, sitting with Hon'ble the Chief\n\nJustice Vikram Nath) took a view and with great respects, a\n\ncorrect one, even deviating from His Lordship's own view sitting\n\nsingly earlier in the case of\nLekhabahen Kanaiyalal Modi\n\n(Supra).\n\nThat only, in our humble opinion, displays the sterling\n\ncharacter of a Judge, who is receptive enough to change his own\n\nearlier view and render an exposition of law with axiomatic clarity\n\nby a Division Bench view in the case of\nTamanna Ashokkumar\n\nDesai\n(Supra).\n\nWe are beholden and respectfully agree with the\n\nPage 130 of 131\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Jul 16 01:10:19 IST 2021\n\nC/LPA/1105/2015 CAVJUDGMENT Dt. 31.03.2021\n\nGUJARAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION Versus NIKETA BABULAL CHAUDHARI & 2 other(s)\n\nsaid view in the case of\nTamanna Ashokkumar Desai\n(Supra).\n\nWe also place on record our appreciation for the valuable assistance\n\nby all the learned Senior Counsels and other learned counsels, who\n\nappeared in the said matter.\n\n(DR.
