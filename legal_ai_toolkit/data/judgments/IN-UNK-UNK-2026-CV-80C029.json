Explanation. ­ For the purpose of this section, 'cruelty' means­\n\n (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive \n the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to \n life limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or \n\n (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view \n to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful \n demand or any property or valuable security or is on account of \n failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.\"\n\n \n304B. Dowry death.­ (1) Where the death of woman is caused by \n any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal \n circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown \n that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or \n harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in \n connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 50/67\n 'dowry death', and such husband or relative shall be deemed to \n have caused her death.\n\n Explanation.­ For the purpose of this sub­section, 'dowry' shall \n have the same meaning as in \nsection 2\n of the Dowry Prohibition \n Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).\n\n (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with \n imprisonment for term which shall not be less than seven years but \n which may extend to imprisonment for life.\n\n Section - 302 \nIPC\n\n \"302 Punishment for murder - Whoever commits murder shall \n be punished with death, or (Imprisonment for life), and shall also \n be liable to fine.\"\n\n \nSec.34\n IPC\n\n \"When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of \n the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that \n act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.\"\n\n CONTRADICTIONS:\n\n153.From the perusal of record, it has come on record that present case has been \n\n registered on the statement Ex.PW2/B of PW Irshad Ali wherein he had put the \n\n allegations against accused Nadeem that he had demanded Rs.7 lacs, out of which \n\n he had paid Rs.2.50 lacs to him and a Car. In support of his version, PW3 Smt. \n\n Anwari, who is mother of deceased also made same complaint against accused \n\n Nadeem.\n\n154.During the course of trial, PW Mohd. Irshad and PW Anwari including PW4 \n\n Hasan Ali, samdhi of complainant, PW5 Gulam Mohd., samdhi of complainant, \n\n PW6 Imran, brother of complainant, PW7 Irfan Ali, brother of complainant and \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 51/67\n PW9 Mohd. Yasin, samdhi of complainant have been examined as material \n\n witnesses.\n\n155.On perusal of record, it is also revealed that statement of PWs Irshad, father of \n\n deceased Smt. Anwari, mother of deceased, Hasan Ali, and Gulam Mohd. , Mohd. \n\n Yasin, all are the Samdhi of complainant, Imran and Irfan are sons complainant, \n\n and brothers of deceased have also been confronted with their statements.\n\n156.As per PW1, accused Naeem had demanded Rs.07 lacs from him in the presence \n\n of his Samdhi Yasin and he had given Rs.50,000/­, another time Rs.65,000/­ again \n\n Rs.1,10,000/­ to accused Naeem. This witness has further deposed that accused \n\n persons used to give beating to his daughter on the demand of dowry and they used \n\n to demand Rs. 7 lacs, out of which he had given Rs.2.5 lacs to them. PW7 Irfan \n\n Ali states that his father had given Rs.1 lacs to fulfil the demand of dowry which is \n\n not corroborated with the statement of PW2. \n\n157.Since there is lot of contradictions in the testimonies of material PWs. PW3 Smt. \n\n Anwari, mother of deceased has deposed in her testimony that deceased was \n\n graduate where as PW2 states that she was 12th standard passed.\n\n158.PW2 and PW3 have stated in their testimonies that no family members of in­laws \n\n of her daughter (deceased) had met her in GTB Hospital whereas PW9 states that \n\n all the in­laws of deceased Kamarjahan were also present in hospital when he \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 52/67\n reached there at about 7:00 - 8:00 p.m. on 21.01.2010. MLC Ex.PW13/D also \n\n reflects that deceased was got admitted in the GTB Hospital by Sahil, one of \n\n family member of in­laws of deceased.\n\n159.PW4 Hasan Ali, PW5 Gulam Mohd., PW6 Imran, PW7 Irfan Ali and PW9 Mohd. \n\n Yasin who are the family members of complainant have deposed on the same \n\n footings as of PW2 and PW3. Their statement have been confronted in the same \n\n manner as of PW2. None of PWs could disclosed the date of cruelty upon the \n\n deceased or even could not alleged the time of demand of dowry by the accused \n\n persons. All the PWs have leveled common allegations against accused persons \n\n without alleging any dates.\n\n160.PW4 in his testimony before court has stated that after 3­4 months he was called \n\n by Irshad Ali, there his daughter and Irshad Ali had told him that there is a quarrel \n\n in matrimonial home of Kamar Jahan on issue of less dowry and requested him to \n\n accompany to the house of accused Nadeem to make him understand whereas PW \n\n in his entire testimony has not stated so. Even PW3 in her entire testimony could \n\n not deposed the aforesaid fact. None of material PWs could disclose the date of \n\n demand of dowry or of cruelty by accused persons.\n\n161.Further, statement Ex.PW2/B have been confronted at various points.\n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 53/67\n\n 162.Since document Ex.PW10/A at Column No.7 reflects alleged history of fall from \n\n roof, as per MLC, as column No.13 due to fall from roof, column No.20, 21 shows \n\n that she was suffering from depression and in support of his case this fact has been \n\n stated by the complainant.\n\n163.PW5 Gulam Mohd. Has stated in his testimony that after about four month of his \n\n daughter he find Irshad Ali in a disturb state and on his asking he informed him \n\n that in­law of Kamar Jahan including husband, father­in­law, mother­in­law, Uncle \n\n have been harassing her for less dowry and he along with Irshad and one more \n\n person had visited matrimonial home of Kanwar Jahan whereas this fact has not \n\n been disclosed by PW2 and PW3 in their testimony. Further, PW5 in his \n\n testimony stated that he had made understand four aforesaid persons not given \n\n beatings to Kamar Jahan and not to threaten her to kill for demand of dowry and \n\n Irshad Ali had delivered a sum of Rs.1,10,000/­ to Nadeem and accused \n\n Naimuddin not to harass Kamar Jahan for demand of dowry. This fact has also \n\n not been deposed by PW2 and PW3 in their testimonies. This witness further goes \n\n to say that he had visited police station to getting FIR registered along with Irshad \n\n Ali on 21.01.2010 and that in his presence police had met Irshad Ali in hospital \n\n and had made enquries from him. These facts are also absent from the testimony \n\n of PW2 and PW3.\n\n164.Further, this witness again goes to say that he along with Irshad Ali and two other \n\n persons visited the house of accused persons by an Alto car owned by Irshad ALI \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others 54/67\n in the area of Jyoti Nagar in the evening time. This fact is also absent from the \n\n testimony of PW2 and PW3. Rest of statement of this witness is confronted by ld. \n\n defence counsel.\n\n165.PW6 who is the brother of deceased states that deceased was 12th standard passed \n\n whereas PW3 states that she was graduate. PW6 further states that at one point of \n\n time Shammi (Chachiya Sasur of deceased) had met him at Sadar bazar and \n\n advised him why do not he pay amount to the accused pesrons. If anything \n\n happened to deceaed then do not make any complaint to him. Surprisingly this \n\n witness has also been failed to disclose the date when Shammi had met him in \n\n Sadar bazar and what amount of dowry he had asked him to pay to the accused. \n\n This witness had stated that deceased had been thrown from fourth floor of her \n\n matrimonial home by the accused persons and Shammi whereas site plan \n\n Ex.PW19/B does not corroborated this fact. It reflects that the floor from where \n\n deceased was allegedly thrown was the third roof including the ground floor. \n\n166.Further, this witness had stated that he along with his brother Irfan had visited the \n\n matrimonial house of his sister (deceased) generally 3­4 times and she used to \n\n reside on third floor those days but PW7 Irfan Ali states the never visited the \n\n matrimonial house of his sister with his brother Imran (PW6). \n\n167.PW7 comes with a new fact that lastly before 15­20 days of incident, at that time \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 55/67\n Kamar Jahan was not well due to gum problem and she was saying \"papa mujha \n\n mat bhejo mein lot ke vapas nahi aa paungi\" none of PWs either it is complainant \n\n or the mother or brothers of deceased, no PWs has stated this fact in their \n\n testimony. PW9 Mohd. Yasin, he is the hearsay on the fact of cruelty upon \n\n deceased as he told by Nazma, his niece.\n\n168.Since postmortem report has been admitted by ld. counsel for accused persons. \n\n Hence, I.O. had exhibited postmortem report and its contents wherein alleged \n\n history of fall from height vide MLC No.C­272/10 dated 21.01.2010 at 5:00 p.m. \n\n has been shown and details of injuries shows lacerated wound of size 2 cm x 1 cm \n\n deep present over external aspect of right arm 5 cm above elbow with underlying \n\n fracture. Blue colour bruise measuring 12 cm x 10 cm present over geuteal \n\n (buttock) region left side.\n\n DEFENCE WITNESSES:\n\n169.Further, DW1 Babu Khan who is jija of complainant has deposed that since her \n\n childhood Kamar Jahan (deceased) was suffering with mental illness because of \n\n which she used to have fits and used to become out of control and used to be \n\n controlled only after prolonged efforts and deceased was under treatment by some \n\n mulla, molvi for the illness by her parents. DW2 has deposed that Kamar Jahan \n\n was happy with the family of accused Nadeem at her matrimonial home and he had \n\n received phone calls from accused Nadeem and he used to tell him that Kamar \n\n Jahan was not mentally fit and sometimes she used to eat the food and sometimes \n\n she hunger herself for 2­3 days and that she used to jump continuously on the bed. \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 56/67\n This witness further deposed that he had accompanied accused Nadeem and his \n\n family members along with Kamar Jahan to hospital for her treatment whenever \n\n she used to become ill due to fits.\n\n170.Further, DW2 Saleem has also deposed that he had talked with Kamar Jahan on \n\n 2­3 occasions where she had told him that she is very happy in her matrimonial \n\n house and she was getting love and affection much more than what she used to get \n\n in her own family. This witness has further deposed that he had received phone \n\n calls from accused Nadeem and accused Nadeem used to tell him that Kamar Jahan \n\n was not mentally fit and sometimes she used to eat the food and sometimes she \n\n hunger herself for 2­3 days and she used to jump continuously on the bed. This \n\n witness had accompanied accused Nadeem and his family members along with \n\n Kamar Jahan (deceased) to hospital for her treatment whenever she used to become \n\n ill due to fits.\n\n171.I.O. had verified medical papers of deceased on the direction of Court at the time \n\n of bail and it came into his notice that deceased Kamar Jahan was under treatment \n\n of psychiatric and neuro.\n\n172.As per the case of prosecution marriage between accused Nadeem and deceased \n\n took place on 26.12.2007 and Kamar Jahan died unnatural death on 22.01.2010. \n\n Death of deceased within 07 years of her marriage is not disputed.\n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 57/67\n\n173.Since from the testimonies of material PWs, no specific date of cruelty of \n\n harassment on account of demand of dowry by the accused persons could come on \n\n record. Even it has also not come on record that soon before death deceased was \n\n subjected to cruelty or harassment on account of demand of dowry. In this regard, \n\n it is pertinent to mention here that no circumstances have been proved by the \n\n prosecution connecting the accused subjected to cruelty or harassment upon \n\n deceased on account of demand of dowry. Further, from the testimonies of \n\n material PWs allegations of cruelty and harassment are contradictory with each \n\n other. Hon'ble Supreme Court in case \"\nState of Rajasthan Vs. Teg Bahadur\n, \n\n 2004(8) J.T. 116\", has held that:\n\n \"Prosecution has to prove 1. The death of married woman was \n within seven years of marriage. 2. a little prior to death, her \n husband or relative on point of demand of dowry subjected \n cruelty to her or harassed her. 3. Prosecution has to rule out the \n possibility of natural or accidental death so as to bring within \n purview of \"death occurring otherwise then in normal \n circumstances\".\n\n \"On the careful scrutiny of the statements of the aforesaid \n witnesses, it is seen that witnesses have given different \n statements regarding demand of dowry. According to him, \n with respect to dowry, dispute was raised at the time of \n marriage. According to Om Prakash, when Suman returned to \n her parents' house, she complained about demand of dowry by \n the in­laws. There is no corroboration about the statement of \n Om Prakash by the statement of his wife Smt. Hira Bai. Under \n these circumstances, we are of the opinion, that there is lack of \n evidence to prove the demand of dowry and that the evidence \n led by the prosecution bristles with discrepancies and \n contradictions. On the basis of the evidence, it could not be \n treated to have been proved that actually the accused had made \n a demand of dowry and that was made soon before the death \n and due to this, the deceased was harassed.\"\n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 58/67\n\n 174.Since it is established that at the time of marriage there was no demand of dowry. \n\n From the perusal of MLC and postmortem report, both does not suggest any \n\n antemortem injury upon the person of deceased except hamorrhagic shock as a \n\n result of antemortem injury to chest and pelvis produced by blunt force impact. \n\n The provisions of section 304­B \nIPC\n has application when death of woman is \n\n caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise then under normal \n\n circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before \n\n her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any \n\n relatives of her husband for, or in connection with any demand for dowry.\n\n175.The crucial question arise whether there were any cruelty or harassment with the \n\n deceased in connection of demand of dowry soon before death?\n\n176.In response to this question none of PWs in their testimony had stated that any \n\n complaint had been made to any authority regarding demand of dowry against the \n\n accused. Moreover, from the testimony of PWs it is revealed that there are mere \n\n general allegations against the accused persons and there is no definite evidence on \n\n record regarding harassment or cruelty on account of demand of dowry by \n\n accused persons to the deceased at any time having immediate proximity to the \n\n death of deceased by the accused persons. Therefore, basic requirement of cruelty \n\n or harassment soon before death to bring application of \nsection 304B\n IPC cannot \n\n be said to be met out.\n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 59/67\n\n \n177.Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in case \"\nSohan Lal & Others v. State\n, 2011 (3) \n\n JCC 1966,\" wherein it has held that :\n\n \"Deceased died of unnatural death within seven years of her \n marriage ­ Trial court acquitted the accused as merely because \n deceased committed suicide in the matrimonial home, no \n inference could be drawn that it must be an outcome of a \n cruelty or torturous act committed by the respondents or by \n any of them - Appeal against acquittal­ There is no complaint \n made either to the police or to any other authority regarding \n any demand of dowry or any harassment allegedly meted out \n to the deceased during her life time­ there are contradictions \n as to the time and manner of the alleged demands, moreover, \n the evidence is completely lacking to show that any \n harassment much less than cruelty as envisaged under section \n 498A was meted out to the deceased­Conclusion reached by \n the trial court cannot be faulted with. Petition dismissed.\n \"Penal code 1860­ Sec. 498A - Cruelty­ The generic \n statements that deceased was given beatings without \n specification as to how the beatings were given, whether any \n object/weapon was used to give those beatings and similarly \n without the details as to how the deceased was harassed­ \n Would be insufficient to hold that the deceased was treated \n with cruelty within the meaning of Sec. 498A or that the \n deceased ended her life on account of the said cruelty.\"\n\n178.Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in case \"\nRani v. The State of NCT of Delhi, H.R.\n\n (2011), Delhi,\" has observed that :\n\n \n\"To bring home an offence under Section 304­B \nIPC\n it is an \n obligation of the prosecution to prove in those cases where death \n of a woman occurs within 7 years of her marriage that soon \n before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by \n her husband or any other relative, in connection with a demand \n of dowry. Mere making of demand is not the only pre­requisite \n for proving an offence under \nSection 304B\n IPC. The \n prosecution was thus supposed to prove that the demand made \n by the accused was coupled with a harassment or cruelty in \n connection with the demand. Unnatural death can be called a \n dowry death only if, after making a demand of dowry, the \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 60/67\n accused perpetuates cruelty on the victim so that the demand \n made by him is got fulfilled by perpetuation of cruelty on the \n victim. If the alleged demand of dowry is not coupled with \n cruelty, harassment or any other such act on the part of accused, \n \nSection 304B\n of IPC would not be made out. In this case, none \n of the three brothers stated that cruelty was perpetuated on Janki \n or she was harassed by the appellant or by any other relative for \n not fulfilling the demand. I consider in these circumstances \n conviction of the appellant under \nSection 304B\n IPC was totally \n illegal and unjust. The conviction seems to be the result of a \n callous criminal justice system where neither the defence \n counsel prepared the case nor the prosecution discharged his \n duty in an impartial manner nor the Judge considered it as his \n duty to see what offence was made out and everyone acted in a \n mechanical manner.\"\n\n179.Before reaching at any conclusion the Section 113­ B of the Evidence Act is also \n\n relevant for the case in hand. Both Sections 304 ­ B \nIPC\n and Section 113­ B of the \n\n Evidence Act were inserted as noted by the \nDowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act\n \n\n 43 of 1986 with a view to combat the increasing menace of dowry deaths. Section \n\n 113­ B which reads as follows :­ \n \"113­ B : Presumption as to dowry death ­ When the question \n is whether a person has committed the dowry death of a \n woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman \n has been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for, \n or in connection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall \n presume that such person had caused the dowry death.\n\n Explanation ­ For the purposes of this section `dowry death' \n shall have the same meaning as in Section 304 ­ B of the \n \nIndian Penal Code\n (45 of 1860).\"\n\n The necessity for insertion of the two provisions has been amply analyzed by the \n\n Law Commission of India in its 21st Report dated 10th August, 1988 on `Dowry \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others 61/67\n Deaths and Law Reform'. Keeping in view the impediment in the pre­ existing \n\n law in securing evidence to prove dowry related deaths, legislature thought it wise \n\n to insert a provision relating to presumption of dowry death on proof of certain \n\n essentials. It is in this background presumptive Section 113­ B in the Evidence Act \n\n has been inserted. As per the definition of `dowry death' in Section 304 ­ B \nIPC\n \n\n and the wording in the presumptive Section 113­ B of the Evidence Act, one of the \n\n essential ingredients, amongst others, in both the provisions is that the concerned \n\n woman must have been \"soon before her death\" subjected to cruelty or harassment \n\n \"for in connection with the demand of dowry\". Presumption under Section 113­ B \n\n is a presumption of law. On proof of the essentials mentioned therein, it becomes \n\n obligatory on the Court to raise a presumption that the accused caused the dowry \n\n death. The presumption shall be raised only on proof of the following essentials : \n\n (1) The question before the Court must be whether the accused has \n committed the dowry death of a woman. (This means that the \n presumption can be raised only if the accused is being tried for the \n offence under Section 304 ­ B \nIPC\n ).\n\n (2) The woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband \n or his relatives.\n\n (3) Such cruelty or harassment was for, or in connection with any \n demand for dowry.\n\n (4) Such cruelty or harassment was soon before her death.\n\n \nA conjoint reading of Section 113­ B of the Evidence Act and Section 304 ­ B \nIPC\n \n\n shows that there must be material to show that soon before her death the victim \n\n was subjected cruelty or harassment. Prosecution has to rule out the possibility of a \n\n natural or accidental death so as to bring it within the purview of the `death \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 62/67\n occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances'. The expression `soon before' is \n\n very relevant where Section 113­ B of the Evidence Act and Section 304 ­ B \nIPC\n \n\n are pressed into service. Prosecution is obliged to show that soon before the \n\n occurrence there was cruelty or harassment and only \nin that case\n presumption \n\n operates. Evidence in that regard has to be led by prosecution. `Soon before' is a \n\n relative term and it would depend upon circumstances of each case and no strait­\n\n jacket formula can be laid down as to what would constitute a period of soon \n\n before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed period, and that \n\n brings in the importance of a proximity test both for the proof of an offence of \n\n dowry death as well as for raising a presumption under \nSection 113B\n of the \n\n Evidence Act.\n\n The expression `soon before her death' used in the substantive \nSection 304B\n IPC \n\n and Section 113­ B of the Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. \n\n No definite period has been indicated and the expression `soon before' is not \n\n defined. A reference to expression `soon before' used in Section 114, Illustration \n\n \n(a) of the \nEvidence Act\n is relevant. It lays down that a Court may presume that a \n\n man who is in the possession of goods `soon after the theft, is either the thief has \n\n received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his \n\n possession. The determination of the period which can come within the term `soon \n\n before' is left to be determined by the Courts, depending upon facts and \n\n circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that the expression `soon \n\n before' would normally imply that the interval should not be much between the \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 63/67\n concerned cruelty or harassment and the death in question. There must be \n\n existence of a proximate and live­link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry \n\n demand and the concerned death. If alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time \n\n and has become stale enough not to disturb mental equilibrium of the woman \n\n concerned, it would be of no consequence.\n\n The presumption u/s 113­B of the Evidence Act for the purpose of section 304­B \n\n can only be used when the death of deceased must have been \"soon before her \n\n death subjected to cruelty or harassment\" \"for or in connection with the demand of \n\n dowry\". Presumption u/s 113 B is a presumption of law. \n\n180.In order to raise the presumption of dowry death u/s 304­B \nIPC\n, it must be shown \n\n that victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment by the accused persons for or in \n\n connection with any demand of dowry soon before her death. Since from the \n\n testimonies of material PWs same could not come on record. Hence, presumption \n\n under section 113­B Evidence Act does not arise.\n\n181.The Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Kamesh Panjiyar @ Kamlesh Panjiyar v. State of \n\n Bihar, (SC)' AIR 2005 SC 785' reiterating and elaborating the similar principles \n\n defining \nsection 498A\n IPC and 304B \nIPC\n observed that:\n\n \"12. Consequences of cruelty which are likely to drive a woman to commit \n suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health, whether \n mental or physical of the woman is required to be established in order to \n bring home the application of Section 498­A \nIPC\n. Cruelty has been defined \n in the Explanation for the purpose of Section 498­A. Substantive Section \n 498­A \nIPC\n and presumptive Section 113­\nA of the Evidence Act\n have been \n inserted in the respective statutes by Criminal Law (Second Amendment) \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others 64/67\n Act, 1983. It is to be noted that Sections 304­B and 498­A, \nIPC\n cannot be \n held to be mutually inclusive. These provisions deal with two distinct \n offences. It is true that cruelty is a common essential to both the sections and \n that has to be proved. The Explanation to Section 498­A gives the meaning \n of `cruelty'. In Section 304­B there is no such explanation about the meaning \n of `cruelty'. But having regard to common background to these offences it \n has to be taken that the meaning of `cruelty' or `harassment' is the same as \n prescribed in the Explanation to Section 498­A under which `cruelty' by itself \n amounts to an offence. Under Section 304­B it is `dowry death' that is \n punishable and such death should have occurred with seven years of \n marriage. No such period is mentioned in Section 498­A. If the case is \n established, there can be a conviction under both the sections. \n(See \nAkula \n Ravinder and others v. The State of Andhra Pradesh\n, 1991(3) RCR(Crl.) 97 \n (SC) : AIR 1991 SC 1142). Period of operation of \nSection 113\n­B of the \n Evidence Act is seven years, presumption arises when a woman committed \n suicide within a period of seven years from the date of marriage.\"\n\n \"13. \nSection 2\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (in short `\nDowry Act\n') \n defines \"dowry\" as under :­ \n\n \nSection 2\n. Definition of `dowry' ­ In this Act, `dowry' means any property or \n valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly ­\n\n (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or\n\n (b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to \n either party to the marriage or to any other person,\n at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of \n the said parties, but does not include dower or mehr in the case of persons to \n whom the Muslim personal law (Shariat) applies.\n\n Explanation I ­ For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that any \n presents made at the time of a marriage to either party to the marriage in the \n form of cash, ornaments, clothes or other articles, shall not be deemed to be \n dowry within the meaning of this section, unless they are made as \n consideration for the marriage of the said parties.\n\n Explanation II ­ The expression `valuable security' has the same meaning in \n \nSection 30\n of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\"\n\n \n\"14. The word \"dowry\" in Section 304­B \nIPC\n has to be understood as it is \n defined in \nSection 2\n of the Dowry Act. Thus, there are three occasions related \n to dowry. One is before the marriage, second is at the time of marriage and \n the third \"at any time\" after the marriage. The third occasion may appear to \n be unending period. But the crucial words are \"in connection with the \n marriage of the said parties\". Other payments which are customary payments \n e.g. given at the time of birth of a child or other ceremonies as are prevalent \n in different societies are not covered by the expression \"dowry\". (See \nSatvir \n Singh v. State of Punjab\n, 2001(4) RCR(Crl.) 355 (SC) : 2002(1) SCC 633).\n\nAs was observed in said case \"suicidal death\" of a married woman within \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 65/67\n seven years of her marriage is covered by the expression \"death of a woman \n is caused.... or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances\" as \n expressed in Section 304­B \nIPC\n.\"\n\n182.From the testimony of material PWs it has also come on record that there is \n\n material contradictions in their testimonies and no PWs could disclose exact date \n\n of cruelty or harassment on account of demand of dowry by accused. Moreover, \n\n all these PWs have made material improvement in their version before the court. \n\n As essential ingredients that cruelty must have been committed before death is \n\n absent. Hence, offence u/s 304­B does not attract.\n\n183.In reference to section 498­A \nIPC\n no circumstance has been shown by the \n\n prosecution indicating any willful conduct on part of the accused causing any \n\n cruelty or harassment on account of demand of dowry with any specific date. \n\n Allegations levelled by PWs are illusory which does not inspire that any cruelty \n\n had been committed upon the victim. Only mere general allegations cannot be put \n\n as willful conduct towards demand of dowry or cruelty by the accused.\n\n \n\n184.Further, FSL report also does not corroborate the allegations of complainant\n\n185.As far as offence\n u/s 302\n IPC is concerned, it could not be brought on record by \n\n prosecution that there was intention on the part of accused persons to commit the \n\n murder of deceased rather it is established from the medical documents placed on \n\n record that deceased was suffering from mental illness. Hence, jumping by \n\n herself under the influence of fits from the house is not ruled out. Hence, offence \n\nSC No.25/2010\n\nState Vs. Nadeem and others\n 66/67\n u/s 302 \nIPC\n is not made out against accused persons.\n\n186.From the close scrutiny of testimony of material PWs, it has been established that \n\n none of them corroborating the fact with each other. Moreover, their statements \n\n have been confronted. Since all PWs have impeached their testimony by making \n\n improvement before the court. Hence, they cannot be said to be reliable witness. \n\n After taking into consideration testimonies of PWs, perusal of record and \n\n circumstances, this court at this stage, comes to the conclusion that case of \n\n prosecution does not inspire the confidence of this court as prosecution has been \n\n failed to prove its charges u/s 498A/304B/302/34 \nIPC\n against accused persons \n\n namely Nadeem, Naimuddin and Smt. Jubuesha @ Sanno beyond reasonable \n\n doubt. Accordingly, this court acquit accused persons namely Nadeem, Naimuddin \n\n and Smt. Jubuesha @ Zaibunisha @ Sanno from charges\n u/s 498A\n/\n304B\n/\n302\n/\n34\n \n\n IPC by giving them benefit of doubt.\n\n187.In terms of Section 437 (A) Cr. P.C. accused persons namely Nadeem, \n\n Naimuddin and Smt. Jubuesha @ Zaibunisha @ Sanno are directed to execute bail \n\n bond in sum of Rs.20,000/­ each with one surety in the like amount for the period \n\n of six months. Order accordingly, file be consigned to record room.\n\n PRONOUNCED IN THE OPEN\n COURT ON THIS 07.11.2012.\n\n (RAMESH KUMAR­II)\n ADDL.
