Basheer and others … Respondent (s)\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nKURIAN, J.:\n\nConstruction by plaintiff, destruction by defendant. Construction by\npleadings, proof by evidence; proof only by relevant and admissible\nevidence. Genuineness, veracity or reliability of the evidence is seen by\nthe court only after the stage of relevancy and admissibility. These are\nsome of the first principles of evidence. What is the nature and manner of\nadmission of electronic records, is one of the principal issues arising for\nconsideration in this appeal.\n\nIn the general election to the Kerala Legislative Assembly held on\n13.04.2011, the first respondent was declared elected to 034 Eranad\nLegislative Assembly Constituency. He was a candidate supported by United\nDemocratic Front. The appellant contested the election as an independent\ncandidate, allegedly supported by the Left Democratic Front. Sixth\nrespondent was the chief election agent of the first respondent. There were\nfive candidates. Appellant was second in terms of votes; others secured\nonly marginal votes. He sought to set aside the election under Section\n100(1)(b) read with Section 123(2)(ii) and (4) of\nThe Representation of the\nPeople Act, 1951\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘the RP Act’) and also sought\nfor a declaration in favour of the appellant. By order dated 16.11.2011,\nthe High Court held that the election petition to set aside the election on\nthe ground under\nSection 123(2)(a)(ii)\nis not maintainable and that is not\npursued before us either. Issues (1) and (2) were on maintainability and\nthose were answered as preliminary, in favour of the appellant. The\ncontested issues read as follows:\n\n“1) xxx xxx xxx\n\n2) xxx xxx xxx\n\n3) Whether Annexure A was published and distributed in the constituency\n\non 12.4.2011 as alleged in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the election petition and\nif so whether Palliparamban Aboobacker was an agent of the first\nrespondent?\n\n4) Whether any of the statements in Annexure A publication is in\nrelation to the personal character and conduct of the petitioner or in\nrelation to the candidature and if so whether its alleged publication will\namount to commission of corrupt practice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The\nRepresentation of the People Act?\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n6) Whether the Flex Board and posters mentioned in Annexures D, E and E1\n\nwere exhibited on 13.4.2011 as part of the election campaign of the first\nrespondent as alleged in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the election petition and if\nso whether the alleged exhibition of Annexures D, E and E1 will amount to\ncommission of corrupt practice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The Representation\nof the People Act?\n\n7) Whether announcements mentioned in paragraph 8 of the election\npetition were made between 6.4.2011 and 11.4.2011, as alleged in the above\nparagraph, as part of the election propaganda of the first respondent and\nif so whether the alleged announcements mentioned in paragraph 8 will\namount to commission of corrupt practice as contemplated under\nsection\n123(4)\nof The Representation of the People Act?\n\n8) Whether the songs and announcements alleged in paragraph 9 of the\nelection petition were made on 8.4.2011 as alleged, in the above paragraph,\nas part of the election propaganda of the first respondent and if so\nwhether the publication of the alleged announcements and songs will amount\nto commission of corrupt practice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The\nRepresentation of People Act?\n\n9) Whether Mr. Mullan Sulaiman mentioned in paragraph 10 of the election\npetition did make a speech on 9.4.2011 as alleged in the above paragraph as\npart of the election propaganda of the first respondent and if so whether\nthe alleged speech of Mr. Mullan Sulaiman amounts to commission of corrupt\npractice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The Representation of the People Act?\n\n10) Whether the announcements mentioned in paragraph 11 were made on\n9.4.2011, as alleged in the above paragraph, as part of the election\npropaganda of the first respondent and if so whether the alleged\nannouncements mentioned in paragraph 11 of the election petition amount to\ncommission of corrupt practice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The Representation\nof the People Act?\n\n11) Whether the announcements mentioned in paragraph 12 of the election\npetition were made, as alleged in the above paragraph, as part of the\nelection propaganda of the first respondent and if so whether the alleged\nannouncements mentioned in paragraph 12 of the election petition amount to\ncommission of corrupt practice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The Representation\nof the People Act?\n\n12) Whether the alleged announcements mentioned in paragraph 13 of the\nelection petition were made as alleged and if so whether it amounts to\ncommission of corrupt practice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The Representation\nof the People Act?\n\n13) Whether the alleged announcements mentioned in paragraph 14 of the\nelection petition were made as alleged and if so whether it amounts to\ncommission of corrupt practice under\nsection 123(4)\nof The Representation\nof the People Act.\n\n14) Whether the election of the first respondent is liable to be set\naside for any of the grounds mentioned in the election petition?”\n\nBy the impugned judgment dated 13.04.2012, the High Court dismissed the\nelection petition holding that corrupt practices pleaded in the petition\nare not proved and, hence, the election cannot be set aside under Section\n100(1)(b) of the RP Act; and thus the Appeal.\n\nHeard Shri Vivek Chib, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri\nKapil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent.\n\nThe evidence consisted of three parts – (i) electronic records, (ii)\ndocumentary evidence other than electronic records, and (iii) oral\nevidence. As the major thrust in the arguments was on electronic records,\nwe shall first deal with the same.\n\nElectronic record produced for the inspection of the court is documentary\nevidence under\nSection 3\nof The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter\nreferred to as ‘\nEvidence Act\n’).\nThe Evidence Act\nunderwent a major\namendment by Act 21 of 2000 [\nThe Information Technology Act, 2000\n\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘\nIT Act\n’)]. Corresponding amendments were also\nintroduced in The\nIndian Penal Code\n(45 of 1860),\nThe Bankers Books\nEvidence Act, 1891\n, etc.\n\nSection 22A\nof the Evidence Act reads as follows:\n\n“22A. When oral admission as to contents of electronic records are\nrelevant.- Oral admissions as to the contents of electronic records are not\nrelevant, unless the genuineness of the electronic record produced is in\nquestion.”\n\nSection 45A\nof the Evidence Act reads as follows:\n\n“45A. Opinion of Examiner of Electronic Evidence.-When in a proceeding, the\ncourt has to form an opinion on any matter relating to any information\ntransmitted or stored in any computer resource or any other electronic or\ndigital form, the opinion of the Examiner of Electronic Evidence referred\nto in\nsection 79A\nof the Information Technology Act, 2000(21 of 2000)., is\na relevant fact.\n\nExplanation.--For the purposes of this section, an Examiner of Electronic\nEvidence shall be an expert.”\n\nSection 59 under\nPart II of the Evidence Act\ndealing with proof, reads as\nfollows:\n\n“59. Proof of facts by oral evidence.—All facts, except the contents of\ndocuments or electronic records, may be proved by oral evidence.”\n\nSection 65A reads as follows:\n\n“65A. Special provisions as to evidence relating to electronic record: The\ncontents of electronic records may be proved in accordance with the\nprovisions of section 65B.”\n\nSection 65B reads as follows:\n\n“65B. Admissibility of electronic records:\n\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, any information\ncontained in an electronic record which is printed on a paper, stored,\nrecorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer\n(hereinafter referred to as the computer output) shall be deemed to be also\na document, if the conditions mentioned in this section are satisfied in\nrelation to the information and computer in question and shall be\nadmissible in any proceedings, without further proof or production of the\noriginal, as evidence of any contents of the original or of any fact stated\ntherein of which direct evidence would be admissible.\n\n(2) The conditions referred to in sub-section (1) in respect of a computer\noutput shall be the following, namely: -\n\n(a) the computer output containing the information was produced by the\ncomputer during the period over which the computer was used regularly to\nstore or process information for the purposes of any activities regularly\ncarried on over that period by the person having lawful control over the\nuse of the computer;\n\n(b) during the said period, information of the kind contained in the\nelectronic record or of the kind from which the information so contained is\nderived was regularly fed into the computer in the ordinary course of the\nsaid activities;\n\n(c) throughout the material part of the said period, the computer was\noperating properly or, if not, then in respect of any period in which it\nwas not operating properly or was out of operation during that part of the\nperiod, was not such as to affect the electronic record or the accuracy of\nits contents; and\n\n(d) the information contained in the electronic record reproduces or is\nderived from such information fed into the computer in the ordinary course\nof the said activities.\n\n(3) Where over any period, the function of storing or processing\ninformation for the purposes of any activities regularly carried on over\nthat period as mentioned in clause (a) of sub-section (2) was regularly\nperformed by computers, whether –\n\n(a) by a combination of computers operating over that period; or\n\n(b) by different computers operating in succession over that period; or\n\n(c) by different combinations of computers operating in succession over\nthat period; or\n\n(d) in any other manner involving the successive operation over that\nperiod, in whatever order, of one or more computers and one or more\ncombinations of computers,\n\nall the computers used for that purpose during that period shall be treated\nfor the purposes of this section as constituting a single computer; and\nreferences in this section to a computer shall be construed accordingly.\n\n(4) In any proceedings where it is desired to give a statement in evidence\nby virtue of this section, a certificate doing any of the following things,\nthat is to say, -\n\n(a) identifying the electronic record containing the statement and\ndescribing the manner in which it was produced;\n\n(b) giving such particulars of any device involved in the production of\nthat electronic record as may be appropriate for the purpose of showing\nthat the electronic record was produced by a computer;\n\n(c) dealing with any of the matters to which the conditions mentioned in\nsub-section (2) relate,\n\nand purporting to be signed by a person occupying a responsible official\nposition in relation to the operation of the relevant device or the\nmanagement of the relevant activities (whichever is appropriate) shall be\nevidence of any matter stated in the certificate; and for the purposes of\nthis sub-section it shall be sufficient for a matter to be stated to the\nbest of the knowledge and belief of the person stating it.\n\n(5) For the purposes of this section, -\n\n(a) information shall be taken to be supplied to a computer if it is\nsupplied thereto in any appropriate form and whether it is so supplied\ndirectly or (with or without human intervention) by means of any\nappropriate equipment;\n\n(b) whether in the course of activities carried on by any official,\ninformation is supplied with a view to its being stored or processed for\nthe purposes of those activities by a computer operated otherwise than in\nthe course of those activities, that information, if duly supplied to that\ncomputer, shall be taken to be supplied to it in the course of those\nactivities;\n\n(c) a computer output shall be taken to have been produced by a computer\nwhether it was produced by it directly or (with or without human\nintervention) by means of any appropriate equipment.\n\nExplanation: For the purposes of this section any reference to information\nbeing derived from other information shall be a reference to its being\nderived therefrom by calculation, comparison or any other process.”\n\nThese are the provisions under the\nEvidence Act\nrelevant to the issue under\ndiscussion.\n\nIn the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the IT Act, it is stated thus:\n\n“New communication systems and digital technology have made drastic changes\nin the way we live. A revolution is occurring in the way people transact\nbusiness.”\n\nIn fact, there is a revolution in the way the evidence is produced before\nthe court. Properly guided, it makes the systems function faster and more\neffective. The guidance relevant to the issue before us is reflected in the\nstatutory provisions extracted above.\n\nAny documentary evidence by way of an electronic record under the\nEvidence\nAct\n, in view of Sections 59 and 65A, can be proved only in accordance with\nthe procedure prescribed under Section 65B. Section 65B deals with the\nadmissibility of the electronic record. The purpose of these provisions is\nto sanctify secondary evidence in electronic form, generated by a computer.\nIt may be noted that the Section starts with a non obstante clause. Thus,\nnotwithstanding anything contained in the\nEvidence Act\n, any information\ncontained in an electronic record which is printed on a paper, stored,\nrecorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced by a computer\nshall be deemed to be a document only if the conditions mentioned under sub-\nSection (2) are satisfied, without further proof or production of the\noriginal. The very admissibility of such a document, i.e., electronic\nrecord which is called as computer output, depends on the satisfaction of\nthe four conditions under Section 65B(2). Following are the specified\nconditions under\nSection 65B(2)\nof the Evidence Act:\n\n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been\nproduced by the computer during the period over which the same was\nregularly used to store or process information for the purpose of any\nactivity regularly carried on over that period by the person having lawful\ncontrol over the use of that computer;\n\n(ii) The information of the kind contained in electronic record or of the\nkind from which the information is derived was regularly fed into the\ncomputer in the ordinary course of the said activity;\n\n(iii) During the material part of the said period, the computer was\noperating properly and that even if it was not operating properly for some\ntime, the break or breaks had not affected either the record or the\naccuracy of its contents; and\n\n(iv) The information contained in the record should be a reproduction or\nderivation from the information fed into the computer in the ordinary\ncourse of the said activity.\n\nUnder\nSection 65B(4)\nof the Evidence Act, if it is desired to give a\nstatement in any proceedings pertaining to an electronic record, it is\npermissible provided the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n(a) There must be a certificate which identifies the electronic record\ncontaining the statement;\n\n(b) The certificate must describe the manner in which the electronic\nrecord was produced;\n\n(c) The certificate must furnish the particulars of the device involved\nin the production of that record;\n\n(d) The certificate must deal with the applicable conditions mentioned\nunder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act; and\n\n(e) The certificate must be signed by a person occupying a responsible\nofficial position in relation to the operation of the relevant device.\n\nIt is further clarified that the person need only to state in the\ncertificate that the same is to the best of his knowledge and belief. Most\nimportantly, such a certificate must accompany the electronic record like\ncomputer printout, Compact Disc (CD), Video Compact Disc (VCD), pen drive,\netc., pertaining to which a statement is sought to be given in evidence,\nwhen the same is produced in evidence. All these safeguards are taken to\nensure the source and authenticity, which are the two hallmarks pertaining\nto electronic record sought to be used as evidence. Electronic records\nbeing more susceptible to tampering, alteration, transposition, excision,\netc. without such safeguards, the whole trial based on proof of electronic\nrecords can lead to travesty of justice.\n\nOnly if the electronic record is duly produced in terms of\nSection 65B\nof\nthe Evidence Act, the question would arise as to the genuineness thereof\nand in that situation, resort can be made to Section 45A – opinion of\nexaminer of electronic evidence.\n\nThe Evidence Act\ndoes not contemplate or permit the proof of an electronic\nrecord by oral evidence if requirements under\nSection 65B\nof the Evidence\nAct are not complied with, as the law now stands in India.\n\nIt is relevant to note that Section 69 of the Police and Criminal Evidence\nAct, 1984 (PACE) dealing with evidence on computer records in the United\nKingdom was repealed by Section 60 of the Youth Justice and Criminal\nEvidence Act, 1999. Computer evidence hence must follow the common law\nrule, where a presumption exists that the computer producing the evidential\noutput was recording properly at the material time. The presumption can be\nrebutted if evidence to the contrary is adduced. In the United States of\nAmerica, under Federal Rule of Evidence, reliability of records normally go\nto the weight of evidence and not to admissibility.\n\nProof of electronic record is a special provision introduced by the\nIT Act\n\namending various provisions under the\nEvidence Act\n. The very caption of\n\nSection 65A\nof the Evidence Act, read with\nSections 59\nand 65B is\nsufficient to hold that the special provisions on evidence relating to\nelectronic record shall be governed by the procedure prescribed under\n\nSection 65B\nof the Evidence Act. That is a complete code in itself. Being a\nspecial law, the general law under\nSections 63\nand\nhas to yield.\n\nIn\nState (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu\nalias Afsan Guru[1], a two-Judge\nBench of this Court had an occasion to consider an issue on production of\nelectronic record as evidence. While considering the printouts of the\ncomputerized records of the calls pertaining to the cellphones, it was held\nat Paragraph-150 as follows:\n\n“150. According to\nSection 63\n, secondary evidence means and includes, among\nother things, “copies made from the original by mechanical processes which\nin themselves insure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with\nsuch copies”.\nSection 65\nenables secondary evidence of the contents of a\ndocument to be adduced if the original is of such a nature as not to be\neasily movable. It is not in dispute that the information contained in the\ncall records is stored in huge servers which cannot be easily moved and\nproduced in the court. That is what the High Court has also observed at\npara 276. Hence, printouts taken from the computers/servers by mechanical\nprocess and certified by a responsible official of the service-providing\ncompany can be led in evidence through a witness who can identify the\nsignatures of the certifying officer or otherwise speak of the facts based\non his personal knowledge. Irrespective of the compliance with the\nrequirements of Section 65-B, which is a provision dealing with\nadmissibility of electronic records, there is no bar to adducing secondary\nevidence under the other provisions of the\nEvidence Act\n, namely,\nSections\nand\n. It may be that the certificate containing the details in sub-\n\nsection (4) of Section 65-B is not filed in the instant case, but that does\nnot mean that secondary evidence cannot be given even if the law permits\nsuch evidence to be given in the circumstances mentioned in the relevant\nprovisions, namely,\nSections 63\nand\n.”\n\nIt may be seen that it was a case where a responsible official had duly\ncertified the document at the time of production itself. The signatures in\nthe certificate were also identified. That is apparently in compliance with\nthe procedure prescribed under\nSection 65B\nof the Evidence Act. However, it\nwas held that irrespective of the compliance with the requirements of\nSection 65B, which is a special provision dealing with admissibility of the\nelectronic record, there is no bar in adducing secondary evidence, under\n\nSections 63\nand\n, of an electronic record.\n\nThe evidence relating to electronic record, as noted herein before, being a\nspecial provision, the general law on secondary evidence under\nSection 63\n\nread with\nSection 65\nof the Evidence Act shall yield to the same. Generalia\nspecialibus non derogant, special law will always prevail over the general\nlaw. It appears, the court omitted to take note of\nSections 59\nand 65A\ndealing with the admissibility of electronic record.\nSections 63\nand\nhave no application in the case of secondary evidence by way of electronic\nrecord; the same is wholly governed by Sections 65A and 65B. To that\nextent, the statement of law on admissibility of secondary evidence\npertaining to electronic record, as stated by this court in\nNavjot Sandhu\n\ncase (supra), does not lay down the correct legal position. It requires to\nbe overruled and we do so. An electronic record by way of secondary\nevidence shall not be admitted in evidence unless the requirements under\nSection 65B are satisfied. Thus, in the case of CD, VCD, chip, etc., the\nsame shall be accompanied by the certificate in terms of Section 65B\nobtained at the time of taking the document, without which, the secondary\nevidence pertaining to that electronic record, is inadmissible.\n\nThe appellant admittedly has not produced any certificate in terms of\nSection 65B in respect of the CDs, Exhibits-P4, P8, P9, P10, P12, P13, P15,\nP20 and P22. Therefore, the same cannot be admitted in evidence. Thus, the\nwhole case set up regarding the corrupt practice using songs, announcements\nand speeches fall to the ground.\n\nThe situation would have been different had the appellant adduced primary\nevidence, by making available in evidence, the CDs used for announcement\nand songs. Had those CDs used for objectionable songs or announcements been\nduly got seized through the police or Election Commission and had the same\nbeen used as primary evidence, the High Court could have played the same in\ncourt to see whether the allegations were true. That is not the situation\nin this case. The speeches, songs and announcements were recorded using\nother instruments and by feeding them into a computer, CDs were made\ntherefrom which were produced in court, without due certification. Those\nCDs cannot be admitted in evidence since the mandatory requirements of\n\nSection 65B\nof the Evidence Act are not satisfied. It is clarified that\nnotwithstanding what we have stated herein in the preceding paragraphs on\nthe secondary evidence on electronic record with reference to\nSection 59\n,\n\n65A\nand\n65B\nof the Evidence Act, if an electronic record as such is used as\nprimary evidence under\nSection 62\nof the Evidence Act, the same is\nadmissible in evidence, without compliance of the conditions in\nSection 65B\n\nof the Evidence Act.\n\nNow, we shall deal with the ground on publication of Exhibit-P1-leaflet\nwhich is also referred to as Annexure-A. To quote relevant portion of\nParagraph-4 of the election petition:\n\n“4. On the 12th of April, 2011, the day previous to the election, one\nPalliparamban Aboobacker, S/o Ahamedkutty, Palliparamban House,\nKizhakkechathalloor, Post Chathalloor, who was a member of the Constituency\nCommittee of the UDF and the Convenor of Kizhakkechathalloor Ward Committee\nof the United Democratic Front, the candidate of which was the first\nrespondent, falling within the Eranad Mandalam Election Committee and was\nthereby the agent of the first respondent, actively involved in the\nelection propaganda of the first respondent with the consent and knowledge\nof the first respondent, had got printed in the District Panchayat Press,\nKondotty, at least twenty five thousand copies of a leaflet with the\nheading “PP Manafinte Rakthasakshidhinam – Nam\nMarakkathirikkuka April 13” (Martyr Day of P P Manaf - let us not forget\nApril 13) and in the leaflet there is a specific reference to the\npetitioner who is described as the son of the then President of the\nEdavanna Panchayat Shri P V Shaukat Ali and the allegation is that he gave\nleadership to the murder of Manaf in Cinema style. The name of the\npetitioner is specifically mentioned in one part of the leaflet which had\nbeen highlighted with a black circle around it specifically making the\nallegation that it was the petitioner under whose leadership the murder was\ncommitted. Similarly in another part of the leaflet the name of the\npetitioner is specifically mentioned with a black border in square. The\nleaflet comprises various excerpts from newspaper reports of the year 1995\nhighlighting the comments in big letters, which are the deliberate\ncontribution of the publishers. The excerpts of various newspaper reports\nwas so printed in the leaflet to expose the petitioner as a murderer, by\nintentionally concealing the fact that petitioner was honourably acquitted\nby the Honourable Court. …”\n\nThe allegation is that at least 25,000 copies of Exhibit-P1-leaflet were\nprinted and published with the consent of the first respondent. Exhibit-P1,\nit is submitted, contains a false statement regarding involvement of the\nappellant in the murder of one Manaf on 13.04.1995 and the same was made to\nprejudice the prospects of the appellant’s election. Evidently, Exhibit-P1\nwas got printed through Haseeb by PW-4-Palliparamban Aboobakar and\npublished by Kudumba Souhrida Samithi (association of the friends of the\nfamilies), though PW-4 denied the same. The same was printed at District\nPanchayat Press, Kondotty with the assistance of one V. Hamza.\n\nAt Paragraph-4 of the election petition, it is further averred as follows:\n\n“4. … Since both the said Aboobakar and V. Hamza are agents of the first\nrespondent, who had actively participated in the election campaign, the\nprinting, publication and distribution of annexure-A was made with the\nconsent and knowledge of the first respondent as it is gathered from Shri P\nV Mustafa a worker of the petitioner that the expenses for printing have\nbeen shown in the electoral return of the first respondent. …”\n\nAt Paragraph-18 of the election petition, it is stated thus:\n\n“18. … As far as the printing and publication of annexure-A leaflet is\nconcerned, the same was not only done with the knowledge and connivance of\nthe 1st respondent, it was done with the assistance of the his official\naccount agent Sri V. Hamza, who happened to be the General Manager of the\nPress in which the said leaflets were printed. ...”\n\nPW-4-Palliparamban Aboobakar has completely denied the allegations.\nStrangely, Shri Mustafa and Shri Hamza, referred to above, have not been\nexamined. Therefore, evidence on printing of the leaflets is of PW-4-\nAboobakar and PW-42. According to PW-4, he had not seen Exhibit-P1-leaflet\nbefore the date of his examination. He also denied that he was a member of\nthe election committee. According to PW-42, who was examined to prove the\nprinting of Exhibit-P1, the said Hamza was never the Manager of the Press.\nExhibit-X4-copy of the order form, based on which the leaflet was printed,\nshows that the order was placed by one Haseeb only to print 1,000 copies\nof a supplement and the order was given in the name of PW-4 in whose name\nExhibit-P1 was printed, Exhibit-X5-receipt for payment of printing charges\nshows that the same was made by Haseeb. The said Haseeb also was not\nexamined. Still further, the allegation was that at least 25,000 copies\nwere printed but it has come out in evidence that only 1,000 copies were\nprinted.\n\nIt is further contended that Exhibit-P1 was printed and published with the\nknowledge and consent of the first respondent. Mere knowledge by itself\nwill not imply consent, though, the vice-versa may be true. The requirement\nunder Section 123(4) of the RP Act is not knowledge but consent. For the\npurpose of easy reference, we may quote the relevant provision:\n\n“123. Corrupt practices.—The following shall be deemed to be corrupt\npractices for the purposes of this Act:—\n\n(1) xxx xxx xxx xxx\n\n(2) xxx xxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) xxx xxx xxx xxx\n\n(4) The publication by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with\nthe consent of a candidate or his election agent, of any statement of fact\nwhich is false, and which he either believes to be false or does not\nbelieve to be true, in relation to the personal character or conduct of any\ncandidate, or in relation to the candidature, or withdrawal, of any\ncandidate, being a statement reasonably calculated to prejudice the\nprospects of that candidate's election.”\n\nIn the grounds for declaring election to be void under\nSection 100(1)(b)\n,\nthe court must form an opinion “that any corrupt practice has been\ncommitted by a returned candidate or his election agent or by any other\nperson with the consent of a returned candidate or his election agent”. In\nother words, the corrupt practice must be committed by (i) returned\ncandidate, (ii) or his election agent (iii) or any other person acting with\nthe consent of the returned candidate or his election agent. There are\nfurther requirements as well. But we do not think it necessary to deal with\nthe same since there is no evidence to prove that the printing and\npublication of Exhibit-P1-leaflet was made with the consent of the first\nrespondent or his election agent, the sixth respondent. Though it was\nvehemently contended by the appellant that the printing and publication was\nmade with the connivance of the first respondent and hence consent should\nbe inferred, we are afraid, the same cannot be appreciated. ‘Connivance’ is\ndifferent from ‘consent’. According to the Concise Oxford English\nDictionary, ‘connive’ means to secretly allow a wrong doing where as\n‘consent’ is permission. The proof required is of consent for the\npublication and not connivance on publication.\nIn\nCharan Lal Sahu v. Giani\nZail Singh and another\n[2], this Court held as under:\n\n“30. … ‘Connivance’ may in certain situations amount to consent, which\nexplains why the dictionaries give ‘consent’ as one of the meanings of the\nword ‘connivance’. But it is not true to say that ‘connivance’ invariably\nand necessarily means or amounts to consent, that is to say, irrespective\nof the context of the given situation. The two cannot, therefore, be\nequated. Consent implies that parties are ad idem. Connivance does not\nnecessarily imply that parties are of one mind.\nThey may or may not be,\ndepending upon the facts of the situation. …”\n\nLearned Counsel for the appellant vehemently contends that consent needs to\nbe inferred from the circumstances. No doubt, on charges relating to\ncommission of corrupt practices, direct proof on consent is very difficult.\nConsent is to be inferred from the circumstances as held by this Court in\n\nSheopat Singh v. Harish Chandra and another\n[3]. The said view has been\nconsistently followed thereafter. However, if an inference on consent from\nthe circumstances is to be drawn, the circumstances put together should\nform a chain which should lead to a reasonable conclusion that the\ncandidate or his agent has given the consent for publication of the\nobjectionable material. Question is whether such clear, cogent and credible\nevidence is available so as to lead to a reasonable conclusion on the\nconsent of the first respondent on the alleged publication of Exhibit-P1-\nleaflet. As we have also discussed above, there is no evidence at all to\nprove that Exhibit-P1-leaflet was printed at the instance of the first\nrespondent. One Haseeb, who placed the order for printing of Exhibit-P1 is\nnot examined. Shri Hamza, who is said to be the Manager of the Press at the\nrelevant time, was not examined. Shri Mustafa, who is said to have told the\nappellant that the expenses for the printing of Exhibit-P1 were borne by\nthe first respondent and the same have been shown in the electoral return\nof the first respondent is also not examined. No evidence of the electoral\nreturns pertaining to the expenditure on printing of Exhibit-P1 by the\nfirst respondent is available. The allegation in the election petition is\non printing of 25,000 copies of Exhibit-P1. The evidence available on\nrecord is only with regard to printing of 1,000 copies. According to PW-24-\nSajid, 21 bundles of Exhibit-P1 were kept in the house of first respondent\nas directed by wife of the first respondent. She is also not examined. It\nis significant to note that Sajid’s version, as above, is not the case\npleaded in the petition; it is an improvement in the examination. There is\nfurther allegation that PW-7-Arjun and PW-9-Faizal had seen\nbundles of Exhibit-P1 being taken in two jeeps bearing registration nos. KL\n13B 3159 and KL 10J 5992 from the residence of first respondent. For one\nthing, it has to be seen that PW-7-Arjun was an election worker of the\nappellant and Panchayat Secretary of DYFI, the youth wing of CPI(M) and the\nmember of the local committee of the said party of Edavanna and Faizal is\nhis friend. PW-29 is one Joy, driver of jeep bearing registration no. KL\n10J 5992. He has completely denied of any such material like Exhibit-P1\nbeing transported by him in the jeep. It is also significant to note that\nneither PW-7-Arjun nor PW-9-Faizal has a case that the copies of Exhibit-P1\nwere taken from the house of the first respondent. Their only case is that\nthe vehicles were coming from the house of the first respondent and PW-4-\nPalliparamban Aboobakar gave them the copies. PW-4 has denied it. It is\nalso interesting to note that PW-9-Faizal has stated in evidence that he\nwas disclosing the same for the first time in court regarding the receipt\nof notice from PW-4. It is also relevant to note that in Annexure-P3-\ncomplaint filed by the chief electoral agent of the appellant on\n13.04.2011, there is no reference to the number of copies of Exhibit-P1-\n\nleaflet, days when the same were distributed and the people who distributed\nthe same, etc., and most importantly, there is no allegation at all in\nAnnexure-P3 that the said leaflet was printed by the first respondent or\nwith his consent. The only allegation is on knowledge and connivance on the\npart of the first respondent. We have already held that knowledge and\nconnivance is different from consent. Consent is the requirement for\nconstituting corrupt practice under Section 123(4) of the RP Act. In such\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that there is a complete chain of\ncircumstances which would lead to a reasonable inference on consent by the\nfirst respondent with regard to printing of Exhibit-P1-leaflet. Not only\nthat there are missing links, the evidence available is also not cogent and\ncredible on the consent aspect of first respondent.\n\nNow, we shall deal with distribution of Exhibit-P1-leaflet. Learned counsel\nfor the appellant contends that consent has to be inferred from the\ncircumstances pertaining to distribution of Exhibit-P1.\nStrong reliance is placed on the evidence of one Arjun and Faizal.\nAccording to them, bundles of Exhibit-P1-leaflet were taken in two jeeps\nand distributed throughout the constituency at around 08.00 p.m. on\n12.04.2011. To quote the relevant portion from Paragraph-5 of the election\npetition:\n\n“5. … Both the first respondent and all his election agents and other\npersons who were working for him knew that the contents of Annexure A which\nwas got printed in the manner stated above are false and false to their\nknowledge and though the petitioner was falsely implicated in the Manaf\nmurder case he has been honourably acquitted in the case and declared not\nguilty. True copy of the judgment in S.C. No. 453 of 2001 of the Additional\nSessions Court (Adhoc No.2), Manjeri, dated 24.9.2009 is produced herewith\nand marked as Annexure B. Though this fact is within the knowledge of the\nfirst respondent, his agents\nreferred to above\nand other persons who were\nworking for him in the election on the 12th of April, 2011 at about 8 AM\nbundles of Annexure A which were kept in the house of the first respondent\nat Pathapiriyam, within the constituency were taken out from that house in\ntwo jeeps bearing Nos KL13-B 3159 and KL10-J 5992 which were seen by two\nelectors, Sri V Arjun aged 31 years, Kottoor House, S/o Narayana Menon,\nPathapiriyam Post, Edavanna and C.P. Faizal aged 34 years, S/o Muhammed\nCheeniyampurathu Pathapiriyam P.O., who are residing in the very same\nlocality of the first respondent and the jeeps were taken around in various\nparts of the Eranad Assembly Constituency and Annexure A distributed\nthroughout the constituency from the aforesaid jeeps by the workers and\nagents of the first respondent at about 8 PM that night. The aforesaid\npublication also amounted to undue influence as the said expression is\nunderstood in\nSection 123(2)(a)(ii)\nof The Representation of the People\nAct, in that it amounted to direct or indirect interference or attempt to\ninterfere on the part of the first respondent or his agent and other\npersons who were his agents referred to below with the consent of the\nfirst respondent, the free exercise of the electoral right of the voters of\nthe Eranad Constituency and is also a corrupt practice falling under\n\nSection 123(4)\nof The Representation of the People Act, 1951. …”\n\nThe allegation is on distribution of Exhibit-P1 at about 08.00 p.m. on\n12.04.2011. But the evidence is on distribution of Exhibit-P1 at various\nplaces at 08.00 a.m., 02.00 p.m., 05.00 p.m., 06.30 p.m., etc. by the UDF\nworkers. No doubt, the details on distribution are given at Paragraph-5\n(extracted above) of the election petition at different places, at various\ntimings. The appellant as PW-1 stated that copies of Exhibit-P1 were\ndistributed until 08.00 p.m. Though the evidence is on printing of 1,000\ncopies of Exhibit-P1, the evidence on distribution is of many thousands. In\none panchayat itself, according to PW-22-KV Muhammed around 5,000 copies\nwere distributed near Areakode bus stand. Another allegation is that two\nbundles were entrusted with one Sarafulla at Areakode but he is not\nexamined. All this would show that there is no consistent case with regard\nto the distribution of Exhibit-P1 making it difficult for the Court to hold\nthat there is credible evidence in that regard.\n\nAll that apart, the definite case of the appellant is that the election is\nto be declared void on the ground of Section 100(1)(b) of the RP Act and\nthat too on corrupt practice committed by the returned candidate, viz., the\nfirst respondent and with his consent. We have already found that on the\nevidence available on record, it is not possible to infer consent on the\npart of the first respondent in the matter of printing and publication of\nExhibit-P1-leaflet. There is also no evidence that the distribution of\nExhibit-P1 was with the consent of first respondent. The allegation in the\nelection petition that bundles of Exhibit-P1 were kept in the house of the\nfirst respondent is not even attempted to be proved. The only connecting\nlink is of the two jeeps which were used by the UDF workers and not\nexclusively by the first respondent. It is significant to note that there\nis no case for the appellant that any corrupt practice has been committed\nin the interest of the returned candidate by an agent other than his\nelection agent, as per the ground under Section 100(1)(d)(ii) of the RP\nAct. The definite case is only of Section 100(1)(b) of the RP Act.\n\nIn\nRam Sharan Yadav v. Thakur Muneshwar Nath Singh and others\n[4], a two-\nJudge Bench of this Court while dealing with the issue on appreciation of\nevidence, held as under:\n\n“9. By and large, the Court in such cases while appreciating or analysing\nthe evidence must be guided by the following considerations:\n\n[pic](1) the nature, character, respectability and credibility of the\nevidence,\n(2) the surrounding circumstances and the improbabilities appearing in the\ncase,\n(3) the slowness of the appellate court to disturb a finding of fact\narrived at by the trial court who had the initial advantage of observing\nthe behaviour, character and demeanour of the witnesses appearing before\nit, and\n(4) the totality of the effect of the entire evidence which leaves a\nlasting impression regarding the corrupt practices alleged.”\n\nOn the evidence available on record, it is unsafe if not difficult to\nconnect the first respondent with the distribution of Exhibit-P1, even\nassuming that the allegation on distribution of Exhibit-P1 at various\nplaces is true.\n\nNow, we shall deal with the last ground on announcements. The attack on\nthis ground is based on Exhibit-P10-CD. We have already held that the CD is\ninadmissible in evidence. Since the very foundation is shaken, there is no\npoint in discussing the evidence of those who heard the announcements. Same\nis the fate of the speech of PW-4-Palliparamban Aboobakar and PW-30-Mullan\nSulaiman.\n\nWe do not think it necessary to deal with the aspect of oral evidence since\nthe main allegation of corrupt practice is of publication of Exhibit-P1-\nleaflet apart from other evidence based on CDs. Since there is no reliable\nevidence to reach the irresistible inference that Exhibit-P1-leaflet was\npublished with the consent of the first respondent or his election agent,\nthe election cannot be set aside on the ground of corrupt practice under\nSection 123(4) of the RP Act.\n\nThe ground of undue influence under Section 123(2) of the RP Act has been\ngiven up, so also the ground on publication of flex boards.\n\nIt is now the settled law that a charge of corrupt practice is\nsubstantially akin to a criminal charge. A two-Judge Bench of this Court\nwhile dealing with the said issue in\nRazik Ram v. Jaswant Singh Chouhan and\nothers\n[5], held as follows:\n\n“15. …The same evidence which may be sufficient to regard a fact as proved\nin a civil suit, may be considered insufficient for a conviction in a\ncriminal action. While in the former, a mere preponderance of probability\nmay constitute an adequate basis of decision, in the latter a far higher\ndegree of assurance and judicial certitude is requisite for a conviction.\nThe same is largely true about proof of a charge of corrupt practice, which\ncannot be established by mere balance of probabilities, and, if, after\ngiving due consideration and effect to the totality of the evidence and\ncircumstances of the case, the mind of the Court is left rocking with\nreasonable doubt — not being the doubt of a timid, fickle or vacillating\nmind — as to the veracity of the charge, it must hold the same as not\nproved.”\n\nThe same view was followed by this Court\nP.C. Thomas v. P.M. Ismail and\nothers\n[6], wherein it was held as follows:\n\n“42. As regards the decision of this Court in Razik Ram and other decisions\non the issue, relied upon on behalf of the appellant, there is no quarrel\nwith the legal position that the charge of corrupt practice is to be\nequated with criminal charge and the proof required in support thereof\nwould be as in a criminal charge and not preponderance of probabilities, as\nin a civil action but proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. It is well settled\nthat if after balancing the evidence adduced there still remains little\ndoubt in proving the charge, its benefit must go to the returned candidate.\nHowever, it is equally well settled that while insisting upon the standard\nof proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the courts are not required to extend\nor stretch the doctrine to such an extreme extent as to make it well-nigh\nimpossible to prove any allegation of corrupt practice. Such an approach\nwould defeat and frustrate the very laudable and sacrosanct object of the\nAct in maintaining purity of the electoral process. (please see\nS.\nHarcharan Singh v. S. Sajjan Singh\n)”\n\nHaving regard to the admissible evidence available on record, though for\ndifferent reasons, we find it extremely difficult to hold that the\nappellant has founded and proved corrupt practice under\nSection\n100(1)(b)\nread with Section 123(4) of the RP Act against the first\nrespondent. In the result, there is no merit in the appeal and the same is\naccordingly dismissed.\n\nThere is no order as to costs.\n\n…………....……………………CJI.\n\n(R. M.
