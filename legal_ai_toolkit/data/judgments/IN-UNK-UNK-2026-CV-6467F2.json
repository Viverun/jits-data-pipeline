In First Round of Litigation, O.A. No. 618 /\n\n HP/2009, the deceased employee, Mehar Chand, had\n\n filed an Original Application, before Learned Tribunal\n\n by setting up a case that he was engaged as\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n -3- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n Part-Time Water Carrier in Post Office Bhambla,\n\n District Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, on 03.03.1983,\n\n but instead of working as a Part-Time Worker,\n\n .\n\n the Respondents have made him to work for the\n\n duration stretching from 8 hours to 16 hours\n\n continuously and un-interruptedly; and prayed for\n\n grant of Temporary Status on completion of one\n\n of\n year's service in terms of the Policy dated 12.04.1991\n\n and had prayed for regularization as granted to\n\n other\n rt\n similarly placed incumbents, including one\n\n Rattan Chand, who had filed Original Application\n\n No.822/HP/1998, decided on 15.05.2000 and other\n\n Original Applications filed by Puran Chand, Lekh\n\n Chand Sharma and Narain Singh, respectively. The\n\n Original Application filed by the deceased employee,\n\n Mehar Chand, was disposed of by the Learned\n\n Tribunal on 19.07.2010 [at pages 38 to 46 paper\n\n book] by directing the Respondents to consider the\n\n case of the deceased employee, Mehar Chand, for\n\n grant of Temporary Status in terms of the Scheme\n\n of 1991 in the same manner in which the benefits\n\n have been extended to others and with further\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n -4- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n direction(s) to consider the claim for regularization\n\n as per Rules and Law and the Scheme at the\n\n appropriate time. Pursuant to the orders passed\n\n .\n\n by Learned Tribunal on 19.07.2010, the Respondents\n\n issued an order dated 11.08.2011 [at page 47 of\n\n paper book], whereby, deceased employee, Mehar\n\n Chand, was granted Temporary Status as Casual\n\n of\n Labourer w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and after completing\n\n three years of continuous service, he was treated\n\n at par\n rt with Temporary Grade 'D' Employees of\n\n Department of Posts w.e.f. 29.11.1992 and was\n\n held entitled for benefits as were admissible to\n\n Temporary Grade 'D' Employees on regular basis\n\n in terms of the Communications-Instructions dated\n\n 12.04.1991 and 30.11.1992. Resultantly, the deceased\n\n employee, Mehar Chand, was granted Temporary\n\n Status as Casual Labourer w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and\n\n was treated at par with the Temporary Grade 'D'\n\n Employees w.e.f. 29.11.1992 and was also granted\n\n financial benefits flowing from orders passed by\n\n Tribunal dated 19.07.2010 by issuing implementation\n\n order dated 11.08.2011 but by restricting such\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n -5- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n benefits for 18 months prior to filing of Original\n\n Application. However, the deceased employee, Mehar\n\n Chand, superannuated from service on 08.06.2012,\n\n .\n\n without being granted the pensionary benefits. Against\n\n this, a legal notice dated 15.08.2013 was served\n\n requesting for grant of pension and other retiral\n\n benefits but the claim was rejected by Respondent-\n\n of\n Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, Mandi, on\n\n 17.09.2013 [at page 54 of paper book] on the\n\n ground,\n rt\n that since the deceased employee had\n\n retired from service on 08.06.2012 without being\n\n regularized, therefore, he was not entitled for retiral\n\n benefits as were admissible to regular Grade 'D'\n\n Employees by the respondents.\n\n 2(i). In Second round of litigation, i.e. OA\n\n No. 1593-HP/2013, the deceased employee, Mehar\n\n Chand, assailed the rejection order dated 17.09.2013\n\n and prayed for granting pensionary-retiral benefits\n\n for temporary service rendered by treating the\n\n said service at par with regular service as per\n\n the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\n the case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd.) & Ors.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n -6- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n etc. versus Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n\n & Anr. etc. reported in 1990 SCC Suppl. 1113\n\n and the Instructions dated 30.11.1992 and other\n\n .\n\n \njudgment(s), including the judgments passed in the\n\n case of Shyam Lal Shukla [OA No.1626/2005,\n\n decided on 28.07.2019, which was upheld by the\n\n Allahabad High Court, in Civil Misc.

In compliance\n\n to the orders passed by the Learned Tribunal\n\n on 04.07.2014 [at pages 56 to 60 of paper book],\n\n Respondents rejected the case on 21.10.2014 [at\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n -7- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n page 36 of paper book], on the ground, that once\n\n the deceased employee, Mehar Chand, retired from\n\n service without being regularized, therefore, the retiral\n\n .\n\n benefits including pension cannot be granted to him.\n\n CASE SET UP BY DECEASED MEHAR CHAND\n IN THIRD ROUND OF LITIGATION LEADING\n TO PASSING OF IMPUGNED ORDER DATED\n\n 28.10.2015 [ANNEXURE A-5]:\n\n 3. In third round of litigation, i.e. O.A. No. 063\n\n of\n /00161/2014, the deceased employee, Mehar Chand,\n\n assailed the rejection orders dated 17.09.2013 and\n rt\n dated 21.10.2014 with the twin prayers, i.e. firstly,\n\n to grant regularization to him from the date junior\n\n Moti Ram was regularized and secondly, to grant\n\n retiral benefits [including pensionary benefits] by\n\n taking into account temporary service {rendered after\n\n grant of Temporary Status and continuous service} by\n\n treating such temporary service at par with service\n\n rendered by Grade 'D' Employees on regular basis\n\n and based on such temporary service the pensionary\n\n benefits, were granted to Shyam Lal Shukla, who\n\n was made to superannuate from service in temporary\n\n capacity, without granting regularization despite having\n\n rendered two decades of service as temporary employee\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n -8- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n under the Respondents. In this backdrop, the deceased\n\n employee, namely Mehar Chand had filed OA No 063\n\n /00161/2014, seeking following reliefs:-\n\n .\n\n \"(i) That the impugned orders dated 21.10.2014\n\n (A-1, 17.09.2013 (A-6/A) be quashed and\n set aside being wholly illegal and arbitrary.\n\n (ii) That it be declared that the applicant is\n\n entitled to pensionary benefits w.e.f. 8.5.2012\n with all the consequential benefits along\n with 18% interest per annum.\n\n of\n\n \n(iii) That the applicant be extended the benefit\n of the judgment in the case of \nShyam Lal\n Shukla\n (Supra).\"\n\n STAND OF RESPONDENTS BEFORE LEARNED\n rt\n TRIBUNAL:\n\n 4. In Reply to OA No. 063/00161/2014, i.e.\n\n third round of litigation [which is subject matter\n\n of instant petition], the Respondents filed a Written\n\n Statement-Reply on Affidavit of Senior Superintendent\n\n of Post Offices, Mandi. Stand of Respondents in Reply-\n\n Affidavit was that deceased employee, Mehar Chand,\n\n retired on attaining the age of superannuation on\n\n 08.06.2012 and the alleged junior, Moti Ram was\n\n not regularized on the date of superannuation of\n\n the deceased employee, namely Mehar Chand on\n\n 08.06.2012 whereas, the aforesaid Moti Ram, was\n\n regularized subsequently in the month of November\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n -9- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n 2012 and therefore, the claim for regularization\n\n was stated to be not tenable. So far as the claim\n\n for pensionary benefits is concerned, it was stated\n\n .\n\n that once deceased employee, Mehar Chand was not\n\n a regular employee of the Department and therefore,\n\n the pension was not admissible. In this backdrop\n\n the Respondents prayed for dismissal of the Original\n\n of\n Application.\n\n REJOINDER BY ORIGINAL APPLICANT BEFORE\n LEARNED CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL:\n\n rt\n\n 5. Deceased Employee, Mehar Chand, filed a\n\n rejoinder, stating that the issue as to whether a\n\n Temporary Employee was entitled for pensionary benefits\n\n has already been put at rest by Learned Allahabad\n\n Bench of the Tribunal, in the case of Shyam Lal\n\n Shukla, mandating that a Temporary Employee who\n\n was conferred the Temporary Status and thereafter\n\n rendered temporary service till superannuation was to\n\n be granted the service benefits, including pensionary\n\n benefits as were admissible to Grade 'D' Employees\n\n on regular employees. Meaning thereby, that in case\n\n a temporary employee superannuated from government\n\n service without being regularized (due to inaction of\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n \n- 10 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n government inaction) therefore, the Original Applicant,\n\n namely, Mehar Chand was entitled to the pensionary\n\n benefits as granted to \nShyam Lal Shukla\n (supra).\n\n .\n\n It was averred in Para 4(iv) that Respondents did\n\n not consider the case of deceased Original Applicant-\n\n petitioner, Mehar Chand for regularization against\n\n post of MTS Grade 'D' and had the case been\n\n of\n considered in true perspective then, he would have\n\n been regularized. In Para 4 (xiv), the entitlement\n\n of the\n rtdeceased Original Applicant-Petitioner for\n\n retiral benefits was asserted to be squarely covered\n\n by the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\n the case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd.) & Ors.\n\n etc. versus Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. &\n\n Anr, 1990 Suppl. SCC 1113. In above backdrop,\n\n deceased employee Mehar Chand had claimed the\n\n retiral benefits, including pension, on the basis of\n\n temporary service rendered w.e.f. 23.11.1989 till his\n\n superannuation on 08.06.2012 with the prayer to\n\n release all consequential benefits.\n\n ORIGINAL APPLICANT MEHAR CHAND DIED\n DURING PENDENCY OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE\n TRIBUNAL:\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 11 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n 6.

Though in OA No 063/00161/2014, the\n\n Deceased Original Applicant-Petitioner, namely, Mehar\n\n Chand, {which is subject matter of controversy in\n\n instant writ proceedings} had primarily sought two\n\n reliefs i.e. firstly, seeking quashing of the rejection\n\n orders dated 21.10.2014 and 17.09.2013 and claiming\n\n regularization for the prolonged temporary service\n\n rendered from 29.11.1989 for more than two\n\n decades and secondly, for retiral benefits, including\n\n pension even if aforesaid employee superannuated\n\n on 08.06.2012 without having been regularized, in\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 12 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n the light of the mandate of the Honble Supreme\n\n Court in the case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union (infra)\n\n and Establishment Rule 154-A of the Posts and\n\n .\n\n Telegraph Ministerial Manual {at Page 79 of paper\n\n book} by mandating that contingent paid/part time\n\n Chowkidars shall be brought on regular establishment\n\n and such employees shall be treated as a regular\n\n of\n employee and in terms of the order passed by\n\n the Allahabad Bench of Tribunal in case of Shyam\n rt\n Lal Shukla, which has attained finality also entitles\n\n a temporary Government Servant who superannuates\n\n from service, without having been regularized is also\n\n entitled for pensionary benefits.\n\n To the dismay of the Original Applicant,\n\n the Learned Central Administrative Tribunal dismissed\n\n the Original Application by passing Impugned Order\n\n on 28.10.2015 [Annexure P-5], disallowing the claim\n\n for regularization on the ground that once no junior\n\n was regularized and the named junior, Moti Ram\n\n was regularized in month of November 2012, after\n\n superannuation of the Original Applicant, namely Mehar\n\n Chand. The operative part of the Impugned Order\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 13 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n dated 28.10.2015 [Annexure P-5], reads as under:-\n\n \"6.

Learned counsel further stated that\n memo dated 10.11.2010 (Annexure A-8)\n\n of\n was not an order regarding regularization of\n the services of Sh. Moti Ram and hence\n the applicant could not rely on the same\n to claim regularization from the same\n rt date as Sh. Moti Ram and pensionary\n\n benefits on account of his service.\n\n 7. We have given our careful consideration\n to the matter. In the earlier round of\n\n litigation in OA No. 1593/HP/2013 decided\n on 04.07.2014, it has been directed as\n follows:-\n\n \"Hence, the respondents are directed\n to re-examine the case of the applicant\n\n for regularization and if any junior\n of the applicant has been regularized\n\n prior to his date of superannuation\n on 08.06.2012 the applicant's claim for\n regularization may also be considered.\n It is to state the obvious that if\n the applicant is regularized, he would\n be entitled to pension from the date\n he retired from service Such\n consideration may be effected within\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 14 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n three months of a date of receipt of\n a certified copy of this order being\n served upon the respondents and the\n applicant may be apprised about the\n decision in the matter.\"\n\n .\n\n \nIt is in response to this order that the\n impugned order dated 21 10 2014 has been\n passed The respondents have categorically\n\n stated that Moti Ram whose case has\n been referred to by the applicant was\n appointed as regular MTS Grove in\n\n of\n November, 2012. Perusal of the memo\n no. B-2/Moti Ram/2010, dated 10.11.2010\n (Annexure A-8) shows that this was an\n rt\n order regarding posting of Sh Moti Ram\n Temporary status Casual Labourer treated\n\n at par with Temporary Group 'D' employees,\n as Group 'D' against vacant post at Sub\n Post Office, Manali.

This order dated 10.11.2010 cannot\n\n be treated as an order regularizing the\n\n services of Sh. Moti Ram. It is merely\n a posting/deployment order. Hence, since\n the applicant has not been able to\n\n establish that any person junior to him\n was regularized prior to the date when\n he superannuated on 08.06.2012, his\n claim for regularization prior to his\n date of superannuation cannot succeed.\n The judgments regarding \nShyam Lal\n Shukla\n (supra), \nUOI & Ors.

Non-adjudication of the\n\n claim-relief in Para 8(i) of OA, by Learned Tribunal\n\n despite the fact that the entitlement for pensionary\n\n benefits is established in view of the settled law\n\n of\n i.e. judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\n cases of Jagrit Mazdoor Union and Establishment\n rt\n Rule 154-A of the Posts and Telegraph Ministerial\n\n Manual {at Page 79 of paper book} {infra} and the\n\n order /judgment passed by Allahabad Bench of Tribunal,\n\n which was upheld by the High Court and by the\n\n Honble Supreme Court in the case of Shyam Lal\n\n Shukla [infra].

As per existing recruitment\n rules, extra-departmental agents are given\n\n .\n\n preference in the matter of absorption as\n\n Group 'D' postmen. Directions have already\n been issued for their absorption against the\n\n vacancies. It has been pointed out again\n that casual labourers are being paid bonus\n while substitutes are not entitled under\n\n of\n the existing scheme.

If on the basis of established norms,\n\n casual labourers are in excess, their\n services shall be dispensed with in\n accordance with law; and\n\n 4. If any casual labourers cannot be\n retrenched straightaway, they shall\n be paid wages for three months at\n the existing rates. This tentative scheme\n does not take into account the several\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 25 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n specific claims advanced by the\n petitioners in the two writ petitions.\n These are House Rent Allowance, City\n Compensatory Allowance, Bonus and\n Earned Leave. There are also demands\n\n .\n\n for weekly off day, postal holiday\n\n and maternity leave. Weekly off has\n now been given to RTPs, casual\n\n labourers and substitutes under order\n of this Court and the claim does\n not survive for adjudication. All these\n\n of\n three categories in these two writ\n petitions are also being given three\n national Holidays. For the remaining\n rt\n postal holidays, the claim has been\n pressed but we are of the view that\n\n until absorption, they may not be\n granted. It has been agreed before\n us that the claim of bonus may be\n\n left to arbitration or for being dealt\n with by the Consultative Council. As\n regards House Rent Allowances, City\n\n Compensatory Allowance and maternity\n Leave, we see no justification for\n\n treating the employees of the Postal\n Department differently from those\n\n covered under the Regularisation\n Rules in the Telecommunications\n Department.

After rendering three years\n of continuous service with temporary\n rt\n status, the casual labourers shall\n be treated at par with temporary\n\n Grade 'D' employees of the Department\n of Posts and would thereby be\n entitled to such benefits as are\n\n admissible to Group 'D' employees\n on regular basis. So far as the\n substitutes are concerned, it has been\n\n stated to us that orders have been\n issued for considering their claims\n\n against Group 'D' vacancies and a\n copy of the Department's letter has\n\n been produced. We hope and trust\n that the direction shall be implemented\n in its true spirit.

In order to appreciate the claim and the\n\n of\n legal entitlement of the deceased Original Applicant-\n\n Petitioner, namely, Mehar Chand for pension, it is\n rt\n necessary to have a recap of Establishment Rule\n\n 154-A of Posts and Telegraph Manual, reads as under:\n\n \"Selected categories of whole time contingency\n paid staff such as Sweepers, Bhisties,\n Chowkidars, Chobdars, Malis or Gardeners,\n\n Khalasis and such other categories as are\n expected to work side by side with regular\n employees or with employees in work charged\n establishments, should for the present be\n\n brought on to regular establishments of\n which they form adjuncts and should\n\n be treated as \"regular\" employees. The\n other contingency staff who do not fulfill\n these conditions e.g. Dhobis, Tailors, Syces,\n Grass Cutters, etc., should continue on the\n\n existing basis and should be treated to be\n \"Casual employees\". Part time employees of\n 'regular' categories, as also employees of\n 'Casual categories who are not brought on\n to the regular establishment, will continue,\n as at present, to be paid form contingencies. \"\n\n In above backdrop, the deceased Original\n\n Applicant-Petitioner, Mehar Chand was appointed as\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 28 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n contingent paid Chowkidar (part time) on 03.03.1983\n\n in Post Office Bhambla and while working as such,\n\n he was granted temporary status of casual labourer\n\n .\n\n on 11.08.2011 [at page 47 of paper book] w.e.f.\n\n 29.11.1989 and after grant of temporary status, the\n\n aforesaid employee performed work, job and functions\n\n as that of regular or work charged employees till\n\n of\n superannuation on 08.06.2012.

Further,\n\n the claim set up in Para 4 (xii) of the OA that\n\n the deceased employee, Mehar Chand had rendered\n\n temporary service as was performed by regular service\n\n w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and completion of 3 years as such\n\n w.e.f. 29.11.1992 till superannuation on 08.06.2012\n\n stands uncontroverted in the Reply filed before the\n\n Tribunal.

Inaction of the Respondents in\n\n not passing orders for treating Shri Mehar Chand,\n\n as 'regular employee' in terms of Rule 154-A has\n\n certainly deprived the deceased original applicant-\n\n petitioner Mehar Chand, of his right for pension,\n\n during his lifetime, despite that the petitioner had\n\n rendered more than 20-23 years qualifying service\n\n vis-à-vis requirement of 10 years of qualifying service\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 30 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n under the CCS (Pension) Rules, which were in vogue\n\n on the date of superannuation on 08.06.2012. The\n\n right and legal entitlement of the deceased petitioner\n\n .\n\n for pension under Establishment Rule 154-A and\n\n the CCS (Pension Rules 1972 could not have been\n\n negated or denied by acting contrary to the Rules.\n\n Inaction of Respondents in \"neither bring him on\n\n of\n regular establishment nor treating him as regular\n\n employee\" but in exploiting the petitioner by treating\n rt\n him as \"temporary employee\" despite having rendered\n\n whole time/regular service for more than 20-23 years\n\n continuously, is calculated design and an exploitative\n\n methodology to deny the petitioner of the accrued\n\n right for pensionary benefits under the Rules.

The appellants\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 54 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n performed duties similar to those of\n regular employees in the Accounts\n Section of SFF HQ Estt. No.22. This\n similarity in job functions further\n blurs the line between the appellants'\n\n .\n\n status and that of regular government\n\n employees, suggesting that the\n distinction may be more formal than\n\n substantive. The extension of significant\n elements from the 4th and 5th \nCPC\n to\n the appellants further cements their\n\n of\n plea of being employed in governmental\n functions.\n\n \n31. As held in \nVinod Kumar\n (supra), \"the\n rt essence of employment and the rights\n thereof cannot be merely determined\n\n by the initial terms of appointment\n when the actual course of employment\n has evolved significantly over time.\"\n\n 32. This Court fully associates with this\n principle and finds it wholly applicable\n\n in the present case, especially in light\n of the administrative orders and Board\n\n proceedings referred to supra that have\n consistently treated the appellants as\n\n equivalent to regular government\n employees. The mere classification of\n employees as 'temporary' or 'permanent'\n is not merely a matter of nomenclature\n but carries significant legal implications,\n particularly in terms of service benefits\n and protections.\n\n 33. In the present case, the totality of\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 55 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n circumstances indicates that despite\n their formal classification as temporary\n employees, the appellants' employment\n bears substantial hallmarks of regular\n government service. The denial of\n\n .\n\n pensionary benefits solely on the\n\n basis of their temporary status, without\n due consideration of these factors,\n\n appears to be an oversimplification\n of their employment relationship\n with the government. This approach\n\n of\n runs the risk of creating a class of\n employees who, despite serving the\n\n rtgovernment for decades in a manner\n indistinguishable from regular employees,\n are deprived of the benefits and protections\n\n typically accorded to government servants.\n\n 34. Thus, we are of the opinion that the\n denial of pensionary benefits to the\n\n appellants is not tenable or justifiable\n in the eyes of law as the same is\n arbitrary and violates the fundamental\n\n rights as guaranteed by \nArticles 14\n\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of India. It\n is indeed relevant to note that the\n appellants' batch seems to be the last\n\n in their genre of SSD Fund temporary\n employees and thus, manifestly, the\n direction to extend the benefits of the\n 6th \nCPC\n and the RP Rules to the\n appellants shall not form a precedent\n so as to have a detrimental effect on the\n financial health of the SSD Fund.\"\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 56 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n 19. While dealing with denial of claim for\n\n regularization for want of vacancies, the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No(s).8558 of 2018,\n\n .\n\n \nin Re; \nDharam Singh & Ors versus State of\n\n U.P. & Anr.\n, decided on 19.08.2025 has outlined\n\n that long-term extraction of work under temporary\n\n labels corrodes confidence in public administration\n\n of\n and offends the promise of equal protection and\n\n such adhocism erodes not only the dignity of\n rt\n workers and their livelihood but such exploitation\n\n practice offend \nArticles 14\n, 16\n and \n21\n of the\n\n Constitution of India. After deprecating such practice,\n\n directions were issued to accord the benefit of\n\n regularization to Casual Incumbents, in the following\n\n terms:-\n\n \"19. Having regard to the long, undisputed\n service of the appellants, the admitted\n perennial nature of their duties, and the\n\n material indicating vacancies and comparator\n regularizations we issue the following\n directions:\n\n i. Regularization and creation of\n Supernumerary posts: All appellants\n shall stand regularized with effect\n from 24.04.2002, the date on which the\n High Court directed a fresh\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 57 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n recommendation by the Commission\n and a fresh decision by the State on\n sanctioning posts for the appellants.\n For this purpose, the State and the\n successor establishment (U.P. Education\n\n .\n\n Services Selection Commission) shall\n\n create supernumerary posts in\n the corresponding cadres, Class-III\n\n (Driver or equivalent) and Class-IV\n (Peon/Attendant/Guard or equivalent)\n without any caveats or preconditions.\n\n of\n On regularization, each appellant shall\n be placed at not less than the minimum\n\n rt of the regular pay-scale for the post,\n with protection of last-drawn wages\n if higher and the appellants shall be\n\n entitled to the subsequent increments\n in the pay scale as per the pay grade.\n For seniority and promotion, service\n\n shall count from the date of\n regularization as given above.\n\n ii. Financial consequences and arrears:\n\n Each appellant shall be paid as arrears\n\n the full difference between (a) the pay\n and admissible allowances at the\n minimum of the regular pay-level for\n\n the post from time to time, and (b)\n the amounts actually paid, for the\n period from 24.04.2002 until the date\n of regularization/retirement/death, as\n the case may be. Amounts already\n paid under previous interim directions\n shall be so adjusted. The net arrears\n shall be released within three months\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 58 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n and if in default, the unpaid amount\n shall carry compound interest at 6%\n per annum from the date of default\n until payment.\n\n iii. Retired appellants: Any appellant who\n\n .\n\n has already retired shall be granted\n regularization with effect from 24.04.2002\n until the date of superannuation for\n\n pay fixation, arrears under clause (ii),\n and recalculation of pension, gratuity\n and other terminal dues. The revised\n\n of\n pension and terminal dues shall be\n paid within three months of this\n rt Judgement.\n\n iv. Deceased appellants: In the case of\n\n Appellant No. 5 and any other appellant\n who has died during pendency, his/her\n legal representatives on record shall\n be paid the arrears under clause (ii)\n\n upto the date of death, together with\n all terminal/retiral dues recalculated\n\n consistently with clause (i), within three\n months of this Judgement.\n\n v. Compliance affidavit: The Principal\n Secretary, Higher EducationDepartment,\n\n Government of Uttar Pradesh, or the\n Secretary of the U.P. Education Services\n Selection Commission or the prevalent\n competent authority, shall file an\n affidavit of compliance before this Court\n within four months of this Judgement.\n\n 20. We have framed these directions\n comprehensively because, case after case,\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 59 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n orders of this Court in such matters\n have been met with fresh technicalities,\n rolling \"reconsiderations,\" and administrative\n drift which further prolongs the\n insecurity for those who have already\n\n .\n\n labored for years on daily wages.\n\n Therefore, we have learned that Justice\n in such cases cannot rest on simpliciter\n\n directions, but it demands imposition of\n clear duties, fixed timelines, and verifiable\n compliance. As a constitutional employer,\n\n of\n the State is held to a higher standard\n and therefore it must organize its\n perennial\n rt workers on a sanctioned\n footing, create a budget for lawful\n engagement, and implement judicial\n\n directions in letter and spirit. Delay to\n follow these obligations is not mere\n negligence but rather it is a conscious\n\n method of denial that erodes livelihoods\n and dignity for these workers. The operative\n scheme we have set here comprising\n\n of creation of supernumerary posts, full\n regularization, subsequent financial benefits,\n\n and a sworn affidavit of compliance, is\n therefore a pathway designed to convert\n\n rights into outcomes and to reaffirm that\n fairness in engagement and transparency\n in administration are not matters of\n grace, but obligations under \nArticles 14\n,\n 16\n and \n21\n of the Constitution of\n India.\"\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 60 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n CONCLUSION:\n\n 20. Based on the discussion made hereinabove,\n\n this Court deprecates the Learned Tribunal in not\n\n .\n\n adjudicating the claim of the deceased petitioner-\n\n \nnamely, Mehar Chand for pension for continuous\n\n and uninterrupted temporary service rendered after\n\n grant of temporary status from 29.11.1989 till\n\n of\n superannuation on 08.06.2012 and the resultant\n\n claim of present petitioner no 1-widow Soma Devi\n rt\n for family pension from 28.01.2015 till day, despite\n\n the entitlement for pensionary benefits in view of\n\n the settled law i.e. judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court in Jagrit Mazdoor Union and the provision\n\n of Establishment Rule 154-A of the Posts and\n\n Telegraph Ministerial Manual {at Page 79 of paper\n\n book} (supra} and the order/judgment passed by\n\n Allahabad Bench of Tribunal, which was upheld\n\n by the High Court and by the Honble Supreme\n\n Court in case of \nShyam Lal Shukla\n (supra), which\n\n stands implemented and based on the judgement\n\n in the case of Shyam Lal Shukla, the entitlement\n\n for pensionary benefits as granted by the Learned\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n \n- 61 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n Tribunal was upheld by a Coordinate Division\n\n Bench of this Court in the case of \nPianu Ram\n\n (supra) and by the Punjab and Haryana High\n\n .\n\n \nCourt in the case of \nSunil Soni\n (supra). Even,\n\n the right and entitlement for pensionary benefits\n\n to deceased petitioner and his widow is borne\n\n out from the CCS (TS) Rules, as \nreferred to above\n.\n\n of\n Once the entitlement of petitioner for pensionary\n\n benefits is apparently established in the light of\n rt\n the settled position of law and the Rules coupled\n\n with the fact that the pensionary benefits have\n\n been granted to other similarly placed temporary\n\n employees, who had rendered temporary service\n\n for continuous service, on whole time by performing\n\n same work, job, duties and functions as was\n\n performed by regular employees but were retired\n\n without being regularized, and the Courts have\n\n affirmed the right of such temporary employees\n\n in respondent department for pensionary benefits,\n\n by granting \"deemed regularization\" therefore, the\n\n petitioner being similarly placed, deserves similar\n\n treatment as granted to others so as to ensure\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 62 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n parity and to obviate the charge of discrimination.\n\n Treating petitioner differently, shall lead to \"treating\n\n equals as unequal\", which cannot be permitted to\n\n .\n\n sustain. Failure on the part of Learned Tribunal\n\n to exercise its jurisdiction by not adjudicating\n\n the claim has resulted in miscarriage of justice\n\n and denying of pensionary benefits to the deceased\n\n of\n Original Applicant Mehar Chand and the resultant\n\n denial of family pension to the present petitioner\n rt\n no 1 has violated the social security, by way of\n\n pensionary benefits, and the inaction is interdicted.\n\n Now, coming to Impugned Order dated\n\n 28.10.2015, (Annexure P-5) dismissing the claim of\n\n deceased Original Applicant-petitioner, Mehar Chand\n\n for regularization, this Court is of the considered\n\n view, that the view taken by the Learned Tribunal\n\n is untenable, for the reason, that firstly, non-\n\n regularization amounts to exploitative practice by\n\n making the deceased employee, Mehar Chand w.e.f.\n\n 29.11.1989 till superannuation on 08.06.2012;\n\n and secondly, the non-availability of vacancy for\n\n regularization cannot be ground to deny benefit\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 63 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n of regularization, when as per Establishment Rule\n\n 154-A, the Respondents were bound to bring the\n\n employee-Mehar Chand on regular establishment\n\n .\n\n \nand to treat him as deemed regular employee\n\n which was not done; and thirdly, once the right\n\n of temporary employees, who were granted temporary\n\n status for being brought on regular establishment\n\n of\n and were mandatorily to be treated as \"regular\n\n employees\" by virtue of Rule 154-A, then, the\n rt\n rights acquired under Rule 154-A could not be\n\n permitted to be negated by Respondents due to\n\n the inaction or lethargy of respondents in not\n\n taking timely action for giving effect to right of\n\n consideration and upon consideration for actual\n\n regularization under aforesaid Rule; and fourthly,\n\n the rights acquired in terms of the judgements\n\n in the cases of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n (supra)\n\n and \nShyam Lal Shukla\n, (supra) cannot be negated\n\n when, the latter judgement has attained finality\n\n and stands implemented also; and fifthly, even\n\n deceased employee-Mehar Chand is similarly placed\n\n with \nShyam Lal Shukla\n (supra) as both incumbents\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 64 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n were granted the temporary status in 1989 and\n\n after grant of temporary status both stood retired\n\n from service after rendering decades of temporary\n\n .\n\n \nservice (ranging between more than 17 years in\n\n case of Shyam Lal Shukla and more than 20\n\n years in case of Mehar Chand) and both stood\n\n retired from service without being regularized and\n\n of\n by virtue of judicial intervention, Shyam Lal Shukla\n\n was granted pensionary benefits by treating and\n rt\n conferring benefit of \"deemed regularization\" then,\n\n the petitioner deserves similar treatment so as to\n\n ensure similar treatment in terms of the mandate\n\n of the Honble Supreme Court in the case of\n\n \nState of Uttar Pradesh versus Arvind Kumar &\n\n Ors\n (2015) 1 SCC 347 and Siraj Ahmad versus\n\n State of Uttar Pradesh (2019) 17 SCC 626 and\n\n in Lt Col.\n Suprita Chandel versus Union of\n\n India, Civil Appeal 1943 of 2022, that the benefit\n\n of a judgement has to be granted to all similarly\n\n placed incumbents without forcing them to come\n\n to the Courts; and sixthly, after following the\n\n judgement in case of Shyam Lal Shukla, another\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n \n- 65 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n Coordinate Bench of this Court in case of \nPianu\n\n Ram\n (supra) and by the Punjab and Haryana High\n\n Court in case of \nSunil Soni\n (supra), granted\n\n .\n\n regularization or deemed regularization so as to\n\n enable retiree for pensionary benefits for having\n\n rendered decades of temporary service after being\n\n granted temporary status then, deceased employee\n\n of\n\n -Mehar Chand was entitled for the same treatment,\n\n which has been overlooked by the Learned Tribunal;\n\n rt\n and seventhly, the rights acquired and the effect\n\n and applicability of the settled law cannot in\n\n any manner be curtailed or restricted or negated\n\n by the Respondents; and eighthly, the denial of\n\n regularization for want of vacancy speaks volumes\n\n of inaction of respondents, when, the creation of\n\n a post was an act to be performed by the\n\n respondents over which the employee had no say;\n\n and ninthly, creation of posts for regularization in\n\n normal parlance, may be an administrative act,\n\n but in fact-situation of the instant case, once Rule\n\n 154-A and judgments of the Honble Supreme Court\n\n in the case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union and similar\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 66 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n directions in case of Shyam Lal Shukla mandates\n\n to confer \"temporary status\" after completion of\n\n one year of continuous service as casual labourer\n\n .\n\n with 240 days (which was 206 days in offices\n\n with five days week) and then to bring \"temporary\n\n employees on regular establishment\" and in treating\n\n temporary employees as \"regular employees\". The\n\n of\n conferment of temporary status was ignored and\n\n it was after judicial intervention that Respondents\n rt\n issued an order on 11.08.2011 (at page 47 of\n\n paper book) granting temporary status to deceased\n\n employee-Mehar Chand w.e.f. 29.11.1989 (at page\n\n 47 of paper book). After issuance of the orders\n\n dated 11.08.2011, the Respondents were under\n\n an obligation to create the posts (if not available)\n\n so as to bring such \"temporary employees on\n\n regular establishment\" and in treating temporary\n\n employees as \"regular employees.\" Such an accrued\n\n right to be considered for regularization cannot be\n\n frustrated or defeated due to the inaction and\n\n lethargy of in respondents, in \"not creating posts\"\n\n for giving effect to regularization of the deceased\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 67 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n employee, Mehar Chand and all others, after grant\n\n of temporary status on 11.08.2011 retrospectively\n\n despite having rendered more than two decades\n\n .\n\n {23 years' service}; and tenthly, the Respondents\n\n have not placed on record any cogent and convincing\n\n as to what prevented the authorities from creating\n\n the post (if not available) for regularizing deceased\n\n of\n petitioner-Mehar Chand and others after issuance\n\n of orders on 11.08.2011 till his superannuation\n rt\n on 08.06.2012; and lastly, even the plea of the\n\n Respondents that Moti Ram-junior was regularized\n\n in November 2012 after the retirement of Mehar\n\n Chand on 08.06.2012, goes on to establish that\n\n Respondents have slept over the matter, remained\n\n negligent, failed to take effective and timely action\n\n for creating the posts for regularization, with the\n\n intent to defeat the de-facto and dejure right of\n\n consideration and resultant regularization, which\n\n had accrued under the Rules and settled law, as\n\n discussed hereinabove. It is not the case of the\n\n Respondents-Authorities that the petitioner had not\n\n rendered more than 23 years of temporary service.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 68 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n It is not the case of Respondents that service\n\n record was not upto the mark.

The fundamental right of consideration\n\n and resultant regularization which had accrued\n\n on the basis of Rule 154-A and settled law could\n\n neither not be defeated, restricted or negated due\n\n to inaction and omission of Respondents in not\n\n taking effective and timely steps for creating posts,\n\n so as to make the accrued right meaningful and\n\n practicable.

Resultantly, the deceased employee-Mehar\n\n Chand is held entitled for regularization/deemed\n\n regularization prior to his retirement on 08.06.2012\n\n of\n in view of having rendered more than two decades\n\n of service rendered after grant of temporary status\n rt\n on 23.11.1989 till his retirement on 08.06.2012.\n\n Treating an employee on temporary service amounts\n\n to creating a class on basis of mere nomenclature\n\n or designation, ignoring the fact that the service\n\n performed by employee had the hallmark of regular\n\n service in terms of work, job, duties and functions.\n\n Mere status or nomenclature cannot be made the\n\n basis for denying benefits and protections, including\n\n pensionary benefits. Such deprivation is arbitrary\n\n and violates fundamental rights as guaranteed by\n\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n and reiterating of such right\n\n by the Honble Supreme Court in the cases of\n\n Yashwant Hari Katakkar, Rajkaran and Dharam\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n - 70 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n Singh (supra).\n\n 22. Accordingly, the Impugned Order dated\n\n 28.10.2015 (Annexure P-5) disallowing the claim\n\n .\n\n of deceased petitioner-Mehar Chand for regularization\n\n is set-aside; and non-adjudication of the claim of\n\n the deceased employee, Mehar Chand for pensionary\n\n benefits w.e.f. 08.06.2012/01.07.2012 and the right\n\n of\n and claim of the present petitioner no 1, Soma Devi\n\n for family pension w.e.f 28.01.2015 in applicable\n rt\n pay scale-pay band and in revised pay scale w.e.f.\n\n 01.01.2016 with pension fixation benefits from due\n\n date, with all consequential benefits.\n\n 23.
