Ramana\n\n REPORTABLE\n\n IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n CRIMINAL APPEAL No. 1080 of 2019\n\n SURENDRAN … APPELLANT\n\n VERSUS\n\n STATE OF KERALA … RESPONDENT\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n N.V. RAMANA, CJI\n\n 1. The instant appeal, by way of special leave, is directed against\n\n judgment dated 12.09.2018 passed by the High Court of Kerala in\n\n Criminal Revision Petition No. 1801 of 2006, whereby the High\n\n Court partly allowed the Revision Petition filed by the appellant­\n\n husband (accused no. 5). By way of the impugned judgment, the\n\n High Court has set aside the concurrent findings of conviction of\n\n the courts below and acquitted the appellant under \nSection 304B\n of\n\n the Indian Penal Code [for short ‘the \nIPC\n’] while confirming his\n\n conviction under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC. The High Court has\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\n further modified the sentence imposed on the appellant to rigorous\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nSATISH KUMAR YADAV\n\nDate: 2022.05.13\n\n16:44:41 IST\n\nReason:\n\n imprisonment for one year.\n\n 1\n\n\f2. The conspectus of the facts necessary for the disposal of the\n\nappeal are as follows: the appellant married the deceased on\n\n09.04.1995. After the marriage, the deceased resided with the\n\nappellant and his family members at their matrimonial home. It is\n\nalleged that the appellant, along with his family members, started\n\nharassing the deceased soon after the marriage and was demanding\n\nadditional dowry. Allegedly, the deceased attempted suicide by\n\nconsuming Benzyl Hexa Chloride powder on 11.02.1996 due to the\n\nmental harassment by the accused persons. Fortunately, she was\n\nable to recover after treatment at the Government Hospital,\n\nPalakkad. Subsequent to this incident, mediation between the\n\nparties took place and a settlement was reached between the\n\nparties whereby the deceased continued to reside at the house of\n\nthe accused. Despite the above agreement, it is alleged that the\n\nharassment continued and the deceased committed suicide by\n\nhanging on 21.10.1996, at her own home.\n\n3. The prosecution charged the appellant, his parents and his\n\ntwo brothers under \nSections 304B\n and \n498A\n of the IPC. Pending\n\ntrial, the appellant’s father passed away. The Trial Court, after\n\nexamining all the witnesses and perusing the documents produced\n\nby the prosecution and defence, convicted the accused persons\n\n 2\n\n\funder \nSections 304B\n and \n498A\n of the IPC. Vide judgment dated\n\n12.05.2006, the Appellate Court acquitted the appellant’s brothers\n\nof both the offences. However, the conviction and sentence against\n\nthe appellant and his mother was confirmed.\n\n4. Aggrieved, the appellant and his mother filed the Criminal\n\nRevision Petition before the High Court of Kerala. As already\n\nmentioned above, vide the impugned judgment, the High Court\n\npartly allowed the revision petition and acquitted the appellant and\n\nhis mother under \nSection 304B\n of the IPC while confirming their\n\nconviction under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC. The High Court, however,\n\nreduced the sentence imposed on the appellant to rigorous\n\nimprisonment for one year, and, that of his mother to rigorous\n\nimprisonment for one month. The appellant’s mother has not filed\n\nany appeal before this Court.\n\n5. The main thrust of the submissions made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant are two­fold. First, that the suicide note\n\nand other statements made by the deceased cannot be relied upon\n\nby the Court for convicting him under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC as\n\nthey do not fall within the scope of \nSection 32(1)\n of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 (for short ‘the \nEvidence Act\n’). Second, that the\n\nevidence of PW­3 (mother of the deceased) is contradictory and\n\n 3\n\n\fcannot be relied upon to convict the appellant. On the strength of\n\nthe above two arguments, the learned counsel for the appellant\n\nattempts to persuade this Court that there is no credible evidence\n\nto convict the appellant under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC, and\n\ntherefore, he should be acquitted of the same.\n\n6. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent­\n\nState submits that there are three concurrent finding of facts by the\n\nCourts below which do not merit any interference by this Court in\n\nexercise of its jurisdiction under \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution of\n\nIndia. Learned counsel for the State also submits that there is\n\nsufficient evidence on record to make out a clear case for convicting\n\nthe appellant under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC.\n\n7. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the\n\nrespondent­State at length.\n\n8. Before we proceed, it is expedient to advert to the submissions\n\nof the learned counsel for the appellant particularly that in the\n\npresent case, the appellant was acquitted under \nSection 304B\n of\n\nthe IPC by the High Court in revision and therefore, the statements\n\nof the deceased could not have been relied upon by the High Court\n\n 4\n\n\fto sustain his conviction under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC as it would\n\nnot fall within the ambit of \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act.\n\n9. In this context, it is appropriate to refer to certain provisions\n\nof \nSection 32\n of the Evidence Act. \nSection 32\n relates to the\n\nadmissibility of statements made by a person who cannot be called\n\nas witness. The Section itself specifies the circumstances under\n\nwhich such statements become relevant. In the present case, we are\n\nconcerned with one such circumstance, that is, when the person\n\nwho made the statement is dead. The learned counsel for the\n\nappellant has focused predominantly on \nSection 32(1)\n of the\n\nEvidence Act in an attempt to exclude the evidence of the deceased\n\nby suggesting that it does not fall within the scope of the abovesaid\n\nsub­section and therefore, is inadmissible. The relevant portion of\n\nSection 32\n of the Evidence Act is extracted below:\n\n 32. Cases in which statement of relevant\n fact by person who is dead or cannot be\n found, etc., is relevant. –\n\n Statements, written or verbal, or relevant\n facts, made by a person who is dead, or who\n cannot be found, or who has become\n incapable of giving evidence, or whose\n attendance cannot be procured, without an\n amount of delay or expense which under the\n circumstances of the case appears to the\n Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant\n facts in the following cases:\n\n 5\n\n\f (1) When it relates to cause of death. ­\n When the statement is made by a person as\n to the cause of his death, or as to any of the\n circumstances of the transaction which\n resulted in his death, in cases in which the\n cause of that person's death comes into\n question.\n\n Such statements are relevant whether the\n person who made them was or was not, at\n the time when they were made, under\n expectation of death, and whatever may be\n the nature of the proceeding in which the\n cause of his death comes into question.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n10. \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act is famously referred to as the\n\n“dying declaration” section, although the phrase itself does not find\n\nmention under the \nEvidence Act\n. The Courts have had occasion to\n\nconsider the scope and ambit of \nSection 32\n, particularly \nSection\n\n32(1)\n of the Evidence Act on various occasions.\n\n11. To rely on \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act, one of the main\n\nconditions laid out in the sub­section is that the issue must arise\n\n“in cases in which the cause of that person's death comes into\n\nquestion”. The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant\n\nis that, in the present case, with the acquittal of the appellant by\n\nthe High Court under \nSection 304B\n of the IPC, and the absence of\n\nany appeal challenging the same, the present case pertains to only\n\n 6\n\nSection 498A\n of the IPC. Therefore, the present case does not fall\n\nwithin the scope of the aforementioned sub­section as it is no\n\nlonger a case in which the cause of the deceased’s death comes into\n\nquestion. As such, \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act cannot be\n\nrelied upon by the Court to admit the statements of the deceased to\n\nconvict him under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC.\n\n12. Learned counsel for the appellant has primarily relied upon\n\nthe judgment of this Court in \nGananath Pattnaik v. State of\n\nOrissa\n, (2002) 2 SCC 619, wherein the Court had observed as\n\nunder:\n\n “10. Another circumstance of cruelty is with\n respect to taking away of the child from the\n deceased. To arrive at such a conclusion, the\n trial court has referred to the statement of\n PW 5, who is the sister of the deceased. In\n her deposition recorded in the court on 4­5­\n 1990 PW 5 had stated:\n\n “Whenever I had gone to my sister, all\n the times she was complaining that she is\n not well treated by her husband and in­\n laws for non­fulfilment of balance dowry\n amount of a scooter and a two­in­one.”\n\n and added:\n\n “On 3­6­1987 for the last time I had\n been to the house of the deceased i.e. to\n her separate residence. Sworna, Snigdha,\n Sima Apa, Baby Apa accompanied me to\n her house on that day. At that time the\n deceased complained before us as usual\n\n 7\n\n\f and added to that she said that she is\n being assaulted by the accused\n nowadays. She further complained before\n us that the accused is taking away the\n child from her, and that her mother­in­\n law has come and some conspiracy is\n going against her (the deceased). She\n further told that ‘mate au banchei\n debenahin’.”\n\n Such a statement appears to have been\n taken on record with the aid of \nSection 32\n\n of the Indian Evidence Act at a time when\n the appellant was being tried for the\n offence under Section 304­B and such\n statement was admissible under clause (1)\n of the said section as it related to the\n cause of death of the deceased and the\n circumstances of the transaction which\n resulted in her death. Such a statement is\n not admissible in evidence for the offence\n punishable under Section 498­A of the\n Penal Code, 1860 and has to be termed as\n being only a hearsay evidence. \nSection 32\n is\n an exception to the hearsay rule and deals\n with the statements or declarations by a\n person, since dead, relating to the cause of\n his or her death or the circumstances\n leading to such death. If a statement which\n otherwise is covered by the hearsay rule does\n not fall within the exceptions of \nSection 32\n of\n the Evidence Act, the same cannot be relied\n upon for finding the guilt of the accused.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n13. Although not cited by the learned counsel, the proposition put\n\nforth by him appears to be supported by three other judgments of\n\n 8\n\n\fthis Court in Inderpal v. State of MP, (2001) 10 SCC 736,\n\nBhairon Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2009) 13 SCC 80\n\nand Kantilal Martaji Pandor v. State of Gujarat, (2013) 8 SCC\n\n781. All of these judgments also appear to follow the same line of\n\nreasoning as followed by this Court in \nGananath Pattnaik\n case\n\n(supra), i.e., that once the Court has acquitted an accused of the\n\ncharge relating to the death of an individual, the evidence of the\n\ndeceased would not be admissible to prove the charge under\n\nSection 498A\n of the IPC simpliciter as then the case would no longer\n\nrelate to the death of the deceased.\n\n14. It may bear mentioning that the phrase “cases in which the\n\ncause of that person's death comes into question” is broader than\n\nmerely referring only to cases where there is a charge of murder,\n\nsuicide, or dowry death. There have been instances where Courts\n\nhave used \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act to admit statements in\n\na case where the charge is of a different nature or even in a civil\n\naction. This is abundantly clear from the second part of \nSection\n\n32(1)\n of the Evidence Act which specifies that such statements are\n\nrelevant “whatever may be the nature of the proceeding in which the\n\ncause of his death comes into question”. Illustration (a) to \nSection 32\n\nof the Evidence Act refers to a statement made by a deceased in a\n\n 9\n\n\frape case which may be admitted under the section, which was the\n\nposition in India even prior to the enactment of the \nEvidence Act\n, as\n\nheld by the Court in the case of Queen v. Bissorunjun Mookerjee,\n\n(1866) 6 W.R. Cr. 75.\n\n15. \nIn \nLalji Dusadh v. King­Emperor\n, AIR 1928 Pat 162, the\n\nPatna High Court upheld the admissibility of statements made by\n\nthe deceased in a case concerning charges under \nSections 302\n, \n392\n\nand \n397\n of the IPC. In that case, the deceased victim was robbed\n\nand killed as a part of the same transaction. The submission of the\n\nlearned counsel for the accused \nin that case\n, inter alia, was that the\n\ndying declaration of the deceased could not be admitted under\n\nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act with respect to the charges under\n\nSection 392\n and \n397\n of the IPC. Negativing this contention, the\n\nHigh Court observed as follows:\n\n “A further legal point is taken with regard to\n the dying declarations.\n\n It is contended that so far as the charges for\n the offences under sections 392 and 397 are\n concerned the dying declarations are not\n admissible under \nsection 32(1)\n of the Indian\n Evidence Act inasmuch as the cause of the\n deceased's death does not come in question\n in the trial of those charges. It is contended\n that on this point the Indian law is the same\n as the English law and that a dying\n declaration as to the cause of the death is\n\n 10\n\n\f only admissible when the causing of the\n death is the subject of the charge. I cannot\n agree with this view. The words of \nsection\n 32\n are very wide and it is not necessary\n that the charge should be one of\n homicide. The evidence as to the cause of\n death was relevant to the charge of\n robbery and consequently the cause of\n death that is to say the assault\n committed by the appellant came in\n question in the trial. \nBefore the Indian\n Evidence Act\n was enacted it was held in\n Queen v. Bissorunjun Mookerjee [(1866) 6\n W.R. (Cr.) 75.] that there was no necessity in\n India for following the very narrow rule of\n English law and that a dying declaration\n could be used as evidence in a charge of\n rape. One of the illustrations to \nsection 32\n of\n the present \nIndian Evidence Act\n expressly\n provides for such evidence where the charge\n is not culpable homicide but rape.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n16. Further, in a proceeding with multiple charges, where one\n\ndirectly relates to the death of a declarant and the other does not,\n\nthe Court has admitted the evidence of the declarant even if the\n\nprosecution failed to prove the charge relating to death. For\n\ninstance, in \nParmanand Ganga Prasad v. Emperor\n, AIR 1940\n\nNag 340, the High Court of Nagpur held as follows:\n\n “7. …The prosecution story as narrated by\n us shows that throughout the enquiry the\n cause of death of Munde was material. That\n\n 11\n\n\fbeing so, the mere fact that a charge of\nmurder failed and was not brought home\nto the accused would not make the\nstatement inadmissible for the purposes\nof other offences which were committed\nin the course of the same transaction and\nwith which the accused were charged.\n\n8. We may also observe that in all cases\nregarding admissibility of a particular piece\nof evidence the material time when the\nadmissibility has got to be decided is the\ntime when the Court received the evidence\nand not the eventual result. In this case\nwhen the statements were filed by the\nprosecution and proved in the case it could\nunder no circumstances be argued that the\ncause of death of the deceased was not in\nquestion. The cause of death of Munde was\nin question as there was also a charge under\nS. 302, and this charge was joined with\nother charges in the case under Section\n239(d) as forming part of the same\ntransaction. So, at the stage at which\nthese statements were put up by the\nprosecution before the Court as\nadmissible, it could not be argued that\nthey were not admissible and a document\nonce admitted in evidence remains\nadmissible for all purposes in the case.\n\nThe subsequent result of the case, viz.,\nfailure of the charge of murder should not\nmake any difference whatsoever to the\nadmissibility of the document. Just as\ntheir Lordships of the Privy Council in AIR\n1938 PC 130 [Babulal v. Emperor, (1938) 25\nAIR PC 130 : 174 IC 1 : 65 IA 158 : 32 SLR\n476 : 39 Cr LJ 452 : ILR (1938) 2 Cal 295\n(PC).] stated that the relevant point of time in\nthe proceedings at which the condition as to\nsameness of transaction must be fulfilled is\n\n 12\n\n\f the time of accusation and not that of the\n eventual result we think we would be\n justified in stating the same with respect to\n the admissibility of a document…”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n17. From the above pronouncements, and the wordings of \nSection\n\n32(1)\n of the Evidence Act, it appears that the test for admissibility\n\nunder the said section is not that the evidence to be admitted\n\nshould directly relate to a charge pertaining to the death of the\n\nindividual, or that the charge relating to death could not be proved.\n\nRather, the test appears to be that the cause of death must come\n\ninto question in that case, regardless of the nature of the\n\nproceeding, and that the purpose for which such evidence is being\n\nsought to be admitted should be a part of the ‘circumstances of the\n\ntransaction’ relating to the death.\n\n18. The phrase ‘circumstances of the transaction’, as occurring in\n\nthe section, has been interpreted by the Privy Council in the\n\njudgment that is considered the locus classicus on admissibility of\n\nevidence under \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act, Pakala\n\nNarayana Swami v. King­Emperor, AIR 1939 PC 47. In that\n\ncase, the Privy Council was dealing with a case of murder wherein\n\none of the main pieces of evidence against the accused was the\n\n 13\n\n\fstatement made by the deceased to his wife. The defence argued\n\nthat such evidence had to be excluded due to the hearsay rule.\n\nHowever, the said evidence was admitted under \nSection 32(1)\n of the\n\nEvidence Act and the accused was convicted. In appeal, one of the\n\nquestions the Privy Council had to answer related to whether the\n\ndeceased’s statement was properly admitted or not. In that context,\n\nthe Privy Council observed as under:\n\n “A variety of questions has been mooted in\n the Indian courts as to the effect of this\n section. It has been suggested that the\n statement must be made after the\n transaction has taken place, that the person\n making it must be at any rate near death,\n that the “circumstances” can only include\n the acts done when and where the death was\n caused. Their Lordships are of opinion that\n the natural meaning of the words used does\n not convey any of these limitations. The\n statement may be made before the cause of\n death has arisen, or before the deceased has\n any reason to anticipate being killed. The\n circumstances must be circumstances of\n the transaction : general expressions\n indicating fear or suspicion whether of a\n particular individual or otherwise and not\n directly releated to the occasion of the\n death will not be admissible. But\n statements made by the deceased that he\n was proceeding to the spot where he was\n in fact killed, or as to his reasons for so\n proceeding, or that he was going to meet\n a particular person, or that he had been\n invited by such person to meet him would\n each of them be circumstances of the\n\n 14\n\n\ftransaction, and would be so whether the\nperson was unknown, or was not the person\naccused. Such a statement might indeed be\nexculpatory of the person accused.\n“Circumstances of the transaction” is a\nphrase no doubt that conveys some\nlimitations. It is not as broad as the\nanalogous use in “circumstantial\nevidence” which includes evidence of all\nrelevant facts. It is on the other hand\nnarrower than “res gestae.”\nCircumstances must have some\nproximate relation to the actual\noccurrence : though, as for instance in a\ncase of prolonged poisoning, they may be\nrelated to dates at a considerable distance\nfrom the date of the actual fatal dose.\n\nIt will be observed that “the circumstances”\nare of the transaction which resulted in the\ndeath of the declarant. It is not necessary\nthat there should be a known transaction\nother than that the death of the declarant\nhas ultimately been caused, for the condition\nof the admissibility of the evidence is that\n“the cause of [the declarant's] death comes\ninto question.” In the present case the cause\nof the deceased's death comes into question.\nThe transaction is one in which the deceased\nwas murdered on March 21 or 22 : and his\nbody was found in a trunk proved to be\nbought on behalf of the accused. The\nstatement made by the deceased on March\n20 or 21 that he was setting out to the place\nwhere the accused lived, and to meet a\nperson, the wife of the accused, who lived in\nthe accused's house, appears clearly to be a\nstatement as to some of the circumstances of\nthe transaction which resulted in his death.\n\nThe statement was rightly admitted.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 15\n\n\f19. This principle of law has been upheld by this Court on various\n\noccasions. \nIn \nSharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of\n\nMaharashtra\n, (1984) 4 SCC 116, this Court summarized the\n\nprinciples of \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act, including relating to\n\n“circumstances of the transaction”:\n\n “21. Thus, from a review of the authorities\n mentioned above and the clear language of\n \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act, the\n following propositions emerge:\n\n (1) \nSection 32\n is an exception to the rule of\n hearsay and makes admissible the statement\n of a person who dies, whether the death is a\n homicide or a suicide, provided the\n statement relates to the cause of death, or\n exhibits circumstances leading to the death.\n\n In this respect, as indicated above, the\n \nIndian Evidence Act\n, in view of the peculiar\n conditions of our society and the diverse\n nature and character of our people, has\n thought it necessary to widen the sphere of\n \nSection 32\n to avoid injustice.\n\n (2) The test of proximity cannot be too\n literally construed and practically\n reduced to a cut­and­dried formula of\n universal application so as to be confined\n in a straitjacket. Distance of time would\n depend or vary with the circumstances of\n each case. For instance, where death is a\n logical culmination of a continuous drama\n long in process and is, as it were, a finale\n of the story, the statement regarding each\n step directly connected with the end of\n\n 16\n\n\fthe drama would be admissible because\nthe entire statement would have to be\nread as an organic whole and not torn\nfrom the context. Sometimes statements\nrelevant to or furnishing an immediate\nmotive may also be admissible as being a\npart of the transaction of death. It is\nmanifest that all these statements come\nto light only after the death of the\ndeceased who speaks from death. For\ninstance, where the death takes place\nwithin a very short time of the marriage\nor the distance of time is not spread over\nmore than 3­4 months the statement may\nbe admissible under \nSection 32\n.\n\n(3) The second part of clause (1) of \nSection\n32\n is yet another exception to the rule that\nin criminal law the evidence of a person who\nwas not being subjected to or given an\nopportunity of being cross­examined by the\naccused, would be valueless because the\nplace of cross­examination is taken by the\nsolemnity and sanctity of oath for the simple\nreason that a person on the verge of death is\nnot likely to make a false statement unless\nthere is strong evidence to show that the\nstatement was secured either by prompting\nor tutoring.\n\n(4) It may be important to note that \nSection\n32\n does not speak of homicide alone but\nincludes suicide also, hence all the\ncircumstances which may be relevant to\nprove a case of homicide would be equally\nrelevant to prove a case of suicide.\n\n(5) Where the main evidence consists of\nstatements and letters written by the\ndeceased which are directly connected\nwith or related to her death and which\nreveal a tell­tale story, the said statement\n\n 17\n\n\f would clearly fall within the four corners\n of \nSection 32\n and, therefore, admissible.\n\n The distance of time alone in such cases\n would not make the statement\n irrelevant.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n20. A reading of the above pronouncements makes it clear that, in\n\nsome circumstances, the evidence of a deceased wife with respect to\n\ncruelty could be admissible in a trial for a charge under \nSection\n\n498A\n of the IPC under \nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act. There are,\n\nhowever, certain necessary pre­conditions that must be met before\n\nthe evidence is admitted.\n\n21. The first condition is that her cause of death must come into\n\nquestion in the matter. This would include, for instance, matters\n\nwhere along with the charge under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC, the\n\nprosecution has also charged the accused under Sections 302, 306\n\nor 304B of the \nIPC\n. It must be noted however that as long as the\n\ncause of her death has come into question, whether the charge\n\nrelating to death is proved or not is immaterial with respect to\n\nadmissibility.\n\n22. The second condition is that the prosecution will have to show\n\nthat the evidence that is sought to be admitted with respect to\n\nSection 498A\n of the IPC must also relate to the circumstances of the\n\n 18\n\n\ftransaction of the death. How far back the evidence can be, and\n\nhow connected the evidence is to the cause of death of the deceased\n\nwould necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each\n\ncase. No specific straitjacket formula or rule can be given with\n\nrespect to this.\n\n23. To the above extent therefore, the judgments of this Court in\n\nGananath Pattnaik\n (supra), Inderpal (supra), Bhairon Singh\n\n(supra) and Kantilal Martaji Pandor (supra), wherein it has been\n\nheld that the evidence of the deceased cannot be admitted under\n\nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act to prove the charge under \nSection\n\n498A\n of the IPC only because the accused stands acquitted of the\n\ncharge relating to the death of the deceased, may not be correct.\n\nThese judgments stand overruled to that limited extent.\n\n24. Coming to the present case, we are of the opinion that it is not\n\nnecessary for this Court to undertake the exercise to determine\n\nwhether the statement of the deceased can be admitted under\n\nSection 32(1)\n of the Evidence Act. As the learned counsel for the\n\nState rightly points out, this appeal can be decided even without\n\nconsidering this aspect, as the other evidence on record clearly\n\nproves the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n 19\n\n\f25. The fact that the deceased’s wife was being harassed is clear\n\nfrom the evidence of PW­3 (mother of the deceased). She had\n\nspecifically stated in her chief­examination that within few days of\n\ntheir marriage, the appellant brought the deceased back to her\n\nparental home with the threat that if extra dowry was not given, he\n\nwould leave her and marry another “beautiful” girl. As a result of\n\nsuch harassment, the deceased allegedly attempted suicide for the\n\nfirst time by consuming poison. While she was being treated in the\n\nhospital, a settlement was reached between the parties, to which\n\nappellant was also a part, wherein it was agreed that no further\n\ndemands for dowry would be made. This agreement was exhibited\n\nbefore the Trial Court as Ext P­3. Although the High Court\n\nindicated that the said settlement was not admissible in evidence,\n\nthe fact of its existence has been deposed by PW­9, who is an\n\nindependent witness, as well as by PW­3. Further, it was stated by\n\nPW­3 in her chief­examination that even after the settlement, the\n\nappellant had continued to ill­treat the deceased. The deceased, due\n\nto the ill­treatment faced by her had ultimately committed suicide\n\nby hanging herself with a saree.\n\n26. The learned counsel for the appellant, despite his best efforts,\n\ncould not persuade this Court that the evidence of PW­3 was\n\n 20\n\n\funreliable. There are three concurrent findings of the Courts below\n\nupholding the reliability of the evidence of PW­3. The submission of\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellant that the evidence of PW­3 is\n\nunreliable because she is the mother of the deceased, cannot be\n\ncountenanced. It is a settled principle of law that the evidence\n\ntendered by the related or interested witness cannot be discarded\n\non that ground alone. However, as a rule of prudence, the Court\n\nmay scrutinize the evidence of such related or interested witness\n\nmore carefully. This Court in \nIlangovan v. State of T.N.\n, (2020)\n\n10 SCC 533 has held as follows:\n\n \n“7. With respect to the first submission of\n the counsel for the appellant, regarding the\n testimonies of related witnesses, it is\n settled law that the testimony of a related\n or an interested witness can be taken into\n consideration, with the additional burden\n on the Court in such cases to carefully\n scrutinise such evidence (see \nSudhakar v.\n State\n, (2018) 5 SCC 435). As such, the\n mere submission of the counsel for the\n appellant, that the testimonies of the\n witnesses in the case should be disregarded\n because they were related, without bringing\n to the attention of the Court any reason to\n disbelieve the same, cannot be\n countenanced.”\n\n 21\n\n\f27. In view of the above, we see no reason to interfere with the\n\nimpugned judgment passed by the High Court in confirming the\n\nconviction of the appellant under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC and\n\nsentencing him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year.\n\n28. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. The appellant is on bail.\n\nHis bail bonds stand cancelled and he is directed to surrender\n\nwithin a period of one week from today before the concerned\n\nauthorities to serve out the remaining period of sentence.\n\n ...........................CJI.\n\n (N.V.
