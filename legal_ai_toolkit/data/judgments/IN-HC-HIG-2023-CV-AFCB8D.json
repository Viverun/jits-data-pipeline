CITY CIVIL AND\nSESSIONS JUDGE, BANGALORE, DECREEING THE SUIT FOR\nSPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.\n\nTHIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR DICTATION, THIS DAY,\nK.S.MUDAGAL J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nChallenging the judgment and decree for Specific\n\nPerformance granted in favour of the respondents, the\n\ndefendants in O.S.No.5268/2005 on the file of the V Additional\n\nCity Civil Judge, Bengaluru have preferred this appeal.\n\n2. The appellants were defendant Nos.1 to 4 and\n\nrespondents were plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 in O.S.No.5268/2005.\n\nFor the purpose of convenience, the parties are referred to\n\nhenceforth according to their ranks before the trial Court.\n\n3. Plaintiffs filed O.S.No.5268/2005 before the trial\n\nCourt against the defendants seeking decree for Specific\n\n-3-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nPerformance of agreement of sale dated 25.03.2005 and other\n\nalternative reliefs. The subject matter of the suit was\n\nresidential building bearing No.648/91 situated at 5th Cross,\n\n10th Main, II Block, Banashankari-I stage, Bangalore-50.\n\n4. The case of the plaintiffs in brief is as follows:\n\ni) That defendant Nos.1 to 4 are the absolute owners\n\nof the suit schedule property. The defendants agreed to sell the\n\nsaid property to the plaintiffs for a consideration of\n\nRs.14,50,000/-. In pursuance of such agreement, they\n\nexecuted the agreement of sale dated 25.03.2005 receiving\n\nadvance amount of Rs.3,00,000/-. Out of the said amount,\n\nRs.2,90,000/- was paid by Demand Draft and Rs.10,000/- was\n\npaid in cash. Balance amount of Rs.11,50,000/- was agreed to\n\nbe paid at the time of registration of the sale deed. Plaintiffs\n\nwere always ready and willing to perform their part of the\n\ncontract. They made arrangements for funds and purchased\n\nthe demand drafts for balance sale consideration. Defendants\n\nstarted evading execution of the sale deed. Therefore, the\n\nplaintiffs got issued notice dated 20.05.2005 calling upon the\n\ndefendants to execute the sale deed. The defendants did not\n\nrespond to the said notice.\n\n-4-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nii) The plaintiffs spent in all Rs.31,700/- for obtaining\n\nthe documents etc. They are paying interest at 7.5% per\n\nannum towards loan borrowed by them from HSBC Bank and\n\ninterest at 15% per annum towards loan borrowed from ICICI\n\nBank. The plaintiffs are entitled for decree of Specific\n\nPerformance. In the alternative, they are entitled to decree for\n\nRs.16,81,700/- towards advance sale consideration, liquidated\n\ndamages and expenses of the documents etc., Thus they\n\nsought decree accordingly.\n\n5. The defendants contested the suit by filing their\n\nwritten statement. The gist of the written statement is as\n\nfollows:\n\ni) Ownership of the suit property was admitted. It\n\nwas admitted that on 25.03.2005 they have executed Ex.P12.\n\nBut according to them, Ex.P12 was executed as security for the\n\nloan of Rs.3,00,000/- borrowed by them for their family\n\ncommitments. It was agreed that Ex.P12 is only a security\n\ndocument for the said loan and that was not intended to be\n\nacted upon. Despite defendants repaying the said loan amount\n\nand demanding the return of agreement of sale dated\n\n25.03.2005, the plaintiffs did not return the same. To make\n\n-5-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nunlawful gain, they have filed the suit. The value of the\n\nproperty during the relevant period was Rs.50,00,000/-. That\n\nalso goes to show that the transaction was only a security\n\ntransaction.\n\nii) To the notice of the plaintiffs, the defendants issued\n\nsuitable reply dated 18.06.2005. The readiness and willingness\n\nof the plaintiffs to perform their part of the contract was\n\ndenied. The availment of the loan by the plaintiffs for the\n\npurpose of the transaction was also denied. The plaintiffs in\n\ncollusion with some other interested persons have made false\n\nclaim of agreement of sale and decree for Specific\n\nPerformance. Out of loan of Rs.3,00,000/-, the plaintiffs\n\ndeducted Rs.10,000/- by way of interest and only paid\n\nRs.2,90,000/-. Therefore the allegation that Rs.3,00,000/- was\n\npaid as advance sale consideration is also disputed. The suit\n\nproperty is the only dwelling house of the defendants. If decree\n\nfor Specific Performance is passed, they will be put to greater\n\nhardship. Thus they sought dismissal of the suit.\n\n6. On the basis of the said pleadings, the trial Court\n\nframed the following issues:\n\ni) Does the plaintiffs prove that the defendants\nexecuted an agreement of sale on 25.03.2005 for selling\n\n-6-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nthe schedule property to them for a consideration of\nRs.14,50,000/- and that they paid Rs.3,00,000/- to them\nas earnest money?\n\nii) Do the defendants prove that the agreement is just\na nominal document executed by them by way of security\nfor the hand loan that they obtained from the plaintiffs?\n\niii) Do the plaintiffs prove that they are always ready\nand willing to perform their part of the contract?\n\niv) Do the plaintiffs prove that they are entitled for\nrelief of specific performance or for alternative relief as\nprayed for by them?\n\nv) What order or decree?\n\n7. In support of the case of the plaintiffs, plaintiff No.1\n\nwas examined as PW.1. His mother-in-law and sister-in-law\n\nwere examined as PWs.2 and 3 and on their behalf, Exs.P1 to\n\nP35 were marked. On behalf of defendants, defendant No.1\n\nwas examined as DW.1 and defendant No.4 was examined as\n\nDW.2, on their behalf Ex.D1 was marked.\n\n8. The trial Court on hearing the parties by the\n\nimpugned judgment and decree held that the defendants\n\nadmitted their signature and text of the document. Whereas\n\nthey failed to prove their defence that the said document was\n\nonly a security document, therefore, the plaintiffs' claim that\n\nEx.P12 the agreement of sale was proved. The plaintiffs have\n\n-7-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nproved their readiness and willingness to perform their part of\n\nthe contract. Thus, the trial Court decreed the suit for Specific\n\nPerformance of agreement of sale. Defendants challenged the\n\nsaid judgment in the above appeal.\n\nSubmissions of Sri. M.V.Chandrashekar Reddy, learned\nCounsel for the appellant/defendants:\n\n9. Though the defendants admitted their signature on\n\nEx.P12, they were not well versed with English language. It\n\nwas for the plaintiffs to prove the payment of the entire\n\namount. Though it was claimed that Rs.10,000/- was paid in\n\ncash, the same was not proved. That substantiates the claim of\n\nthe defendants that the transaction was a loan transaction and\n\nthe plaintiffs deducted Rs.10,000/- out of the loan of\n\nRs.3,00,000/- as advance interest.\n\nThe witnesses examined by the plaintiffs were all\n\ninterested witnesses. They were the close relatives of the\n\nplaintiffs. Though PW.1 claimed that he struck the deal through\n\nthe broker by name Jayaram, he was not examined. The scribe\n\nof Ex.P12 was not examined. The loan borrowed by plaintiff\n\nNo.1 was a personal loan. If really the loan was for purchasing\n\nthe property, the plaintiffs should have taken the title deed and\n\ncreated lien on the same. Admittedly the original title deeds\n\n-8-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nwere with the defendants. That substantiated the claim of the\n\ndefendants that the transaction was a loan transaction.\n\nAs per\nSection 16(c)\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963 ('the\n\nAct' for short) as applicable to the present case, the plaintiffs\n\nhad the burden to prove that they were ready and willing to\n\nperform their part of the contract all along. As per Ex.P20, the\n\nplaintiffs surrendered the home loan before filing of the suit.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be said that the plaintiffs were always\n\nready and willing to perform their part of the contract.\n\nThe evidence adduced by the plaintiffs regarding\n\nexecution of the document was very doubtful. Ex.P12 itself\n\nstates that in the case of breach of terms of agreement, the\n\nplaintiffs were entitled only for refund of the amount with\n\nliquidated damages of Rs.2,00,000/-. Therefore, the trial Court\n\nwas in error granting decree for Specific Performance. Even on\n\nproving the execution of the document and the readiness and\n\nwillingness to perform the contract,\nSection 20\nof the Act\n\nmandates that the Court has to exercise the discretion to grant\n\nSpecific Performance of contract only if all the conditions stated\n\ntherein are satisfied. In the present case, admittedly the\n\nplaintiffs owned three houses and suit property was the only\n\ndwelling house for the defendants. Therefore comparative\n\n-9-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nhardship was on the defendants. On that count also, the decree\n\nfor Specific Performance is unsustainable.\n\n10. In support of his submission he relies on the\n\nfollowing judgments:\n\n(\ni) Mayawanti Vs Kaushalya Devi1\n\n(\nii) Sharadamma Vs Gunashekar2\n\n(iii) Smt. Asharaj and Others Vs S.G.Nagaraj @\nSuga Nagaraj3\n\n(\niv) Kali Dei and another Vs Brundaban Malik4\n\n(\nv) Ramjan Khan and others Vs Baba Raghunath\nDass\nand others5\n\n(\nvi) N.K Giriraja Shetty Vs N.K Parthasarathy\nShetty\nand others6\n\n(\nvii) B.R Mulani Vs Dr.A.B Aswathanarayana7\n\n(viii) Bal Krishna and Anr Vs Bhagwan Das (Dead)\nby L.Rs and Ors8\n\n(\nix) Vimlesh Kumari Kulshrestha Vs Sambhajirao\nand Another9\n\n(\nx) U.N Krishnamurthy (Since Deceased) Thr.Lrs\nVs A.M.Krishnamurthy10\n\n(\nxi) Shamsher Singh Vs Rajinder Kumar11\n\n(\nxii) V Muthusami (dead) by LRS Vs Angammal and\nOrs12\n(1990) 3 SCC 1\nLAWS (KAR)-2008-9-26\n3 ILR 2014 Kar 5778\n4 AIR 1972 ORISSA 132\n5 AIR 1992 Madhya Pradesh 22\n6 ILR 2006 KAR 1692\n7 ILR 1992 KAR 2224\n8 AIR 2008 SC 1786\n9 (2008) 5 SCC 58\n10 AIR 2022 SC 3361\n11 2014 AIR SCW 3292\n12 AIR 2002 SC 1279\n\n- 10 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\n(\nxiii) Ranganayakamma Vs Govinda Narayan13\n\n(xiv) Bhaurao Dagdu Paralkar Vs State of\nMaharashtra14\n\nSubmissions of Sri H.R.Anantha Krishna Murthy, learned\nCounsel for the respondents:\n\n11. The contention of the defendants that they were\n\nnot well versed with the English language was not established.\n\nOne of the defendants was a Government servant and the\n\ndocument was attested by the daughter of the first defendant\n\nwho is an engineering student. Moreover, they admitted\n\nexecution of the document, but according to them, the\n\ndocument was executed as security for repayment of the loan.\n\nTherefore the burden was on them to establish their defence.\n\nThe defendants though claimed that they have paid the\n\ninterest, except their self-serving evidence, there was nothing\n\nto prove the same.\n\nThe evidence adduced by the plaintiffs shows that the\n\ndocument executed was agreement of sale and the plaintiffs\n\nwere always ready and willing to perform their part of the\n\ncontract. The contention that at the relevant time the property\n\nwas valued more than Rs.50,00,000/- was not established. So\n\nfar as hardship, the plaintiffs invested Rs.3,00,000/- in the\n\n13 ILR 1982 KAR 1211\n14 (2005) 7 SCC 605\n\n- 11 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nyear 2005. Therefore, if Specific Performance is denied,\n\nplaintiffs will be put to greater hardship as the plaintiffs will not\n\nbe in a position to acquire any such urban property for that\n\nprice after about 20 years. There is no merit in the appeal. He\n\nsought for dismissal of the suit.\n\n12. In support of his submissions, he relies on the\n\nfollowing judgments:\n\n(\ni) Dattatraya Vs Rangnath Gopalrao\nKawathekar\n(dead) by his LRs and\nothers15\n(\nii) Roop Kumar Vs Mohan Thedani16\n\n(iii) Jayamma Vs Venkatesh Shetty and Ors17\n(\niv) Narayan Bhagwantrao Gosavi Balajiwale\nVs Gopal Vinayak Gosavi18\n\n(\nv) Vishnu Vs Abdulgani19\n\n(vi) K Prakash Vs B.R Sampathkumar20\n(\nvii) Zarina Siddiqui Vs A Ramalingam @ R\nAmarnathan21\n\n(viii) Basavaraj Vs Padmavathi22\n(\nix) Prakash Chandra Vs Narayan23\n\n(\nx) Ferrodous Estates (PVT)Ltd Vs\nP.Gopirathnam\n(dead) & ors24\n\n15 AIR 1971 SC 2548\n16 AIR 2003 SC 2418\n17 2017(1)KarLJ 100\n18 AIR 1960 SC 100\n19 2013(1) KCCR105\n20 (2015) 1 SCC 597\n21 (2015) 1 SCC 705\n22 AIR 2023 SC 282\n23 (2012) 5 SCC 403\n\n24 Civil Appeal No.13516/2015 DD 12.10.2020\n\n- 12 -\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\n13. On considering the submissions of both side and on\n\nexamination of the records, the points that arise for\n\nconsideration of this Court are:\n\n(i) Whether the finding of the trial Court that the\n\ndefendants executed Ex.P12 agreeing to sell the suit property\n\nfor Rs.14,50,000/- is sustainable?\n\n(ii) Whether the finding of the trial Court that the\n\nplaintiffs were always ready and willing to perform their part of\n\ncontract is sustainable?\n\n(iii) Whether the trial Court was justified in granting\n\ndecree for Specific Performance?\n\nANALYSIS:\n\nReg. Point No.1:\n\n14. To prove that the defendants executed the\n\nagreement to sell the suit schedule property for consideration\n\nof Rs.14,50,000/- on receiving advance consideration of\n\nRs.3,00,000/-, the plaintiffs relied on the evidence of PWs.1 to\n\n3 and Ex.P12 the agreement of sale. The defendants did not\n\ndispute that they were the absolute owners of the suit schedule\n\nproperty. As per Ex.P12 the agreement of sale, the defendants\n\nagreed to sell the suit property for consideration of\n\nRs.14,50,000/- and they received advance sale consideration\n\n- 13 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nof Rs.3,00,000/-. Even out of that Rs.3,00,000/-,\n\nRs.2,90,000/- was paid by different demand drafts, drawn on\n\nCity Bank and ICICI Bank. The receipt of money under the\n\ndemand drafts was also not disputed. As per clause-2 of\n\nEx.P12, the defendants agreed to convey the property free of\n\nall encumbrances and execute the sale deed within three\n\nmonths of Ex.P12. The defendants agreed to execute the sale\n\nwithin three months from the date of the said document.\n\n15. On admitting the text of Ex.P12 and receipts of\n\ndemand drafts, the burden was on the defendants to prove\n\nthat Ex.P12 was executed as security for repayment of loan. It\n\nwas for them to prove that they had received a sum of\n\nRs.3,00,000/- mentioned in Ex.P12 as loan amount. It is no\n\ndoubt true that the plaintiffs did not examine the scribe of the\n\ndocument or alleged broker, but on having admitted the\n\ndocuments, the burden was on the defendants to prove that\n\nthe document was only a security document and was not\n\nintended to be acted upon. Though much was argued to\n\ncontend that PWs.2 and 3 were interested witnesses, in the\n\nlight of their own admission regarding execution of Ex.P.12,\n\n- 14 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nPWs.2 and 3 being the relatives of the plaintiffs cannot be\n\nblown out of proportion.\n\n16. The next question is \"whether the defendants\n\nestablished their defence that Ex.P12 was only a security\n\ndocument and not the loan transaction\". The defendants in\n\ntheir written statement though contended that they were\n\nwilling to return the loan amount and paid the interest accrued\n\nfrom the date of execution of the same, except their self\n\nserving statement, there was no proof of such payment of\n\ninterest. If the plaintiffs were dragging the matter, taking\n\nadvantage of Ex.P12, the normal course of conduct of a man of\n\nordinary prudence is to first tender the amount and issue\n\nnotice to the plaintiffs and call upon them to hand over the\n\ndocument. But the defendants did not take any steps till the\n\nplaintiffs issued notice to them as per Ex.P.33.\n\n17. Learned Counsel for the appellants submits that the\n\nplaintiffs issued notice even before the expiry of the stipulated\n\nperiod of three months, therefore, there was no need to issue\n\nnotice before that. But according to the plaintiffs, the\n\ndefendants were trying to alienate the property. Therefore they\n\nhad to issue notice within stipulated time. Whatever it may be,\n\n- 15 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nto establish their defence, the defendants atleast could have\n\nexamined the witnesses to the document. Admittedly, the first\n\ndefendant's daughter was a witness to the document and she\n\nwas an engineering student. Atleast she could have been\n\nexamined to show that the document was a nominal document\n\nnot intended to be acted upon. Under the circumstances, the\n\ntrial Court was justified in holding that the defendants failed to\n\nestablish their defence that the document was a nominal\n\ndocument or a security document for the loan transaction.\n\n18. As rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel for\n\nthe plaintiffs/respondents,\nSection 91\nof the Indian Evidence\n\nAct, 1872 bars leading of oral evidence to prove the terms of\n\nthe contract, if the contract itself is reduced to the form of a\n\ndocument. Having executed Ex.P12 as the agreement of sale\n\nthe defendants were excluded from adducing any oral evidence\n\ncontrary to the terms stated thereon in view of\nSection 91\nof\n\nthe Evidence Act. Even otherwise, the defendants failed to\n\nprove that there was loan transaction and they had paid the\n\ninterest, etc. Therefore, defendants cannot be permitted to\n\nlead any evidence to the exclusion of terms of Ex.P12, that too,\n\n- 16 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nwhen they do not contend that the said document was obtained\n\nfrom them by any fraud or coercion.\n\nReg. Readiness and willingness:\n\n19. There is no dispute with regard to the legal\n\nproposition that to claim relief of specific performance, the\n\nproof of execution of the agreement of sale itself is not\n\nsufficient.\nSection 16(c)\nof the Act as it stood in the year 2005\n\nmandated that the plaintiffs have to aver and prove that they\n\nwere always ready and willing to perform their part of the\n\ncontract. Pleading and proving the same was the statutory\n\nrequirement under\nSection 16(c)\nof the Act.\n\n20. According to the defendants themselves, plaintiff\n\nNos. 1 and 2 were both employed and they were earning\n\nhandsome income. It is suggested by the defendants\n\nthemselves to PW.1 that plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 were in the habit\n\nof lending money and getting such documents executed. To\n\nsubstantiate that defendants themselves produced Ex.D1 the\n\ncertified copy of the plaint in OS No.9162/2004. The\n\ndefendants contend that similar to the present case, plaintiff\n\nNo.2 got executed agreement of sale in respect of property\n\nbelonging to one Shanmugaraj and filed similar suit\n\n- 17 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nagainst him for specific performance of contract. Thereby it\n\nbecomes clear that financial affordability of the plaintiffs was\n\nnot in dispute.\n\n21. Further the defendants themselves claim that\n\nplaintiffs owned three properties. As per the defendants\n\nthemselves the plaintiffs had paid Rs.2,90,000/-, though not\n\nRs.3,00,000/-. They failed to establish that Rs.10,000/- out of\n\nRs.3,00,000/- was deducted as interest in advance. The\n\nplaintiffs contend that to pay the balance sale consideration\n\nthey had availed loan from HSBC Bank. To prove that they\n\nrelied on Ex.P1 letter of HSBC Bank, Ex.P10 loan sanction letter\n\nand Ex.P11 loan cancellation letter.\n\n22. To prove that they were always ready and willing to\n\nperform their part of the contract and were pooling funds, the\n\nplaintiffs relied on Ex.P20 the letter said to have been issued\n\nby HSBC Bank along with transaction details. The defendants in\n\nthe cross examination of PW.1 suggested that was a personal\n\nloan. On that ground also the trial Court was justified in holding\n\nthat the plaintiffs were always ready and willing to perform\n\ntheir part of the contract. We do not find any perversity or\n\nillegality in the finding of the trial Court in that regard.\n\n- 18 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nReg. Relief of specific performance:\n\n23. The defendants contested the granting of the relief\n\nof specific performance on two points. First one is that, as per\n\nthe stipulation under the head of breach of contract in Ex.P12,\n\nplaintiffs were entitled only for refund of the earnest money\n\nand liquidated damages of Rs.2,00,000/- and not for specific\n\nperformance. The second ground is that suit property is the\n\nonly dwelling house for all the four defendants together.\n\nWhereas the plaintiffs owned three houses and they are\n\nfinancially far above the defendants. If the suit for specific\n\nperformance is decreed, they become homeless. Such greater\n\nhardship to them disentitles the plaintiffs to seek the decree for\n\nspecific performance.\n\n24. PW.1 in his cross examination has admitted that\n\nexcept the suit property the defendants have no other shelter.\n\nHe also admits that they have three houses for their living. It is\n\nsettled law that, even if the plaintiffs establish execution of\n\nagreement of sale and their readiness and willingness, the\n\ngrant of decree of specific performance is not a matter of\n\ncourse or a matter of right. That is discretionary relief.\nSection\nof the Specific Relief Act as it was applicable to the parties\n\n- 19 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nat the relevant time specifically states that the jurisdiction to\n\ndecree the specific performance is discretionary and the Court\n\nis not bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to\n\ndo so.\nSection 20\nfurther states that discretion of the Court\n\nshall not be arbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by\n\njudicial principles.\n\n25.\nSection 20(2)(b)\nand (c) of the Act at the relevant\n\ntime which are relevant for the purpose of this case reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"20. Discretion as to decreeing specific performance.--\n\n(1) The jurisdiction to decree specific performance is\ndiscretionary, and the court is not bound to grant such relief\n\nmerely because it is lawful to do so; but the discretion of the\ncourt is not arbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by\njudicial principles and capable of correction by a court of\nappeal.\n\n(2) The following are cases in which the court may properly\nexercise discretion not to decree specific performance:--\n\n(a) xxxxxxxx\n\n(b) where the performance of the contract would involve some\nhardship on the defendant which he did not foresee, whereas\n\nits non-performance would involve no such hardship on the\nplaintiff; or\n\n(c) where the defendant entered into the contract under\ncircumstances which though not rendering the contract\nvoidable, makes it inequitable to enforce specific performance.\"\n\n26. Reading of the above provision shows that even if\n\nthe contract entered into between the parties is not voidable,\n\n- 20 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nlooking to the circumstances under which the Court is satisfied\n\nthat it is inequitable to enforce specific performance, the Court\n\ncan reject the specific performance.\nSection 20(2)(b)\nof the\n\nAct states that, if the contract involves some hardship to the\n\ndefendant which he did not foresee at the time of entering into\n\nthe contract, then discretion may not be exercised to grant\n\nspecific performance. In the present case, the evidence on\n\nrecord shows that defendant Nos.1 to 4 were economically not\n\nwell placed as compared to the plaintiffs. Secondly, in Ex.P12\n\nthe plaintiffs' own document i.e., agreement, it is stated that\n\nvendors agreed to sell the suit property to meet the expenses\n\ntowards domestic and legal necessities of their family. The\n\nevidence on record shows that defendants entered into the\n\nagreement to meet out the expenses of marriage of defendant\n\nNo.4 and for the purpose of higher education of the daughter of\n\nthe first defendant. That substantiates the contention of the\n\ndefendants that Ex.P12 was executed under compelling\n\nfinancial pressure.\n\n27. The next thing to be seen is, what was the\n\nunderstanding of the parties regarding the consequences that\n\nentail, if they fail to comply the terms of the contract. In the\n\n- 21 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nagreement the term that is enlisted under the head 'Breach of\n\nTerms of conditions of the agreement\", clause-A says what\n\nshall be done if the purchaser fails to perform his part of the\n\ncontract. Clauses-B and C read as follows:\n\n\"B. In the event of default committed by the VENDORS\nregarding their duties and obligations under this agreement of\nSale, the PURCHASERS shall be entitled to claim refund of the\nadvance of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lakh only) already\n\npaid to the VENDORS with an additional amount of\n\nRs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh only) by way of liquidated\n\ndamages.\n\nC. Both the parties are at liberty to approach the appropriate\ncourt of law for specific performance of this agreement in case\nof breach of the terms and conditions of this agreement against\nthe defaulting party.\"\n\n[[\n\n28. The reading of the above conditions in the\n\nagreement shows that in case of default on the part of the\n\nvendors, firstly the parties agree that advance amount shall be\n\nrefunded with additional amount of Rs.2,00,000/-. Thereafter\n\nby way of general condition, they say that both parties are at\n\nliberty to approach the appropriate Court of law for specific\n\nperformance of agreement. When there are clauses containing\n\nspecific and general conditions, the clauses containing the\n\nspecific condition shall prevail. Moreover such clauses dilute the\n\n- 22 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nagreement aiming at the relief of only specific performance of\n\nthe contract.\n\n29. In a similar circumstance, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in paras 14, 15 and 16 of the judgment in Mayawanti's\n\ncase referred to supra held that, when a promise is made in an\n\nalternative form, it may be that on proper construction of the\n\ncontract, that it contains alternative obligations namely\n\npromise of either to execute the sale deed or pay back the\n\nadvance or compensation, the promisor has the option either\n\nto do or abstain from doing. It was held that the Court may\n\ntreat the covenants to perform or to pay as alternative where\n\nspecific performance would work unreasonable results. It was\n\nfurther held that in such circumstances specific performance\n\ncan be rejected. Needless to say that need for relief of specific\n\nperformance is an equitable relief, the same has to be granted\n\non pragmatically examining all the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case.\n\n30. The above facts and circumstances show that the\n\ndefendants agreed to sell the property when there was financial\n\nstress. The agreement contained an alternative clause to\n\nspecific performance, for refund of the earnest money with\n\n- 23 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\ndamages which diluted the general condition that the parties\n\nare entitled to specific performance.\nIn case of breach even in\n\nthe judgment in\nFerrodous Estates Pvt. Ltd\n's case relied on\n\nby learned counsel for the respondents, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt declined to interfere in the judgment of the High Court\n\ndenying the specific performance and granting decree for\n\nrefund of earnest money with damages.\n\n31. So far as the other judgments relied on by both\n\nside, suffice it to say that they all are covered under\nSection 20\n\nof the Act and the other two\njudgments\nreferred to above\n.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessary to refer to other judgments relied\n\non by both counsel.\n\n32. On evaluation of the aforesaid facts and\n\ncircumstances, in the considered opinion of the Court, granting\n\nspecific performance in favour of the plaintiffs is inequitable\n\nand causes undue hardship to the defendants. However, as the\n\ndefendants have enjoyed Rs.3,00,000/- since 2005, they are\n\nliable to refund the earnest money with agreed damages of\n\nRs.2,00,000/- and Rs.31,700/- spent by the plaintiffs which\n\ncomes to Rs.5,31,700/- with interest.\n\n- 24 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\n33. What shall be rate of interest is the question. The\n\nagreement does not contain any clause regarding rate of\n\ninterest on the earnest money. The defendants contended that\n\nRs.3,00,000/- was lent by way of loan which shall carry\n\ninterest at 9% per annum. This matter is dragged nearly for\n\ntwo decades and the defendants have not even deposited the\n\nagreed sum. Therefore it would be just to award interest at\n\n10% per annum. The appeal deserves to be allowed in part.\n\nHence, the following:\n\nORDER\n\ni) The appeal is partly allowed.\n\nii) The impugned judgment and decree so far it relates\n\nto the specific performance of contract is hereby set aside.\n\niii) Suit in O.S.No.5268/2005 is partly decreed.\n\niv) The prayer in the suit for specific performance is\n\nhereby dismissed.\n\nv) The suit is decreed for recovery of Rs.5,31,700/-\n\nwith interest thereon at 10% per annum from the date of the\n\nsuit till its realization.\n\nvi) The defendants shall deposit 50% of the decreetal\n\namount with accrued interest before the trial Court within four\n\n- 25 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:41819-DB\n\nRFA No. 1191/2010\n\nweeks from the date of the receipt of the copy of this\n\njudgment. The balance 50% shall be deposited before the trial\n\nCourt within next four weeks.\n\nDraw decree accordingly.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nPKN,AKC",
