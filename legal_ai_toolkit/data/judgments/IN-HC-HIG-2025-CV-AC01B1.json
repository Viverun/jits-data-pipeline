In First Round of Litigation, O.A.

The\n\nOriginal Application filed by the deceased employee,\n\nMehar Chand, was disposed of by the Learned\n\nTribunal on 19.07.2010 [at pages 38 to 46 paper\n\nbook] by directing the Respondents to consider the\n\ncase of the deceased employee, Mehar Chand, for\n\ngrant of Temporary Status in terms of the Scheme\n\nof 1991 in the same manner in which the benefits\n\nhave been extended to others and with further\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n-4- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\ndirection(s) to consider the claim for regularization\n\nas per Rules and Law and the Scheme at the\n\nappropriate time. Pursuant to the orders passed\n\n.\n\nby Learned Tribunal on 19.07.2010, the Respondents\n\nissued an order dated 11.08.2011 [at page 47 of\n\npaper book], whereby, deceased employee, Mehar\n\nChand, was granted Temporary Status as Casual\n\nof\nLabourer w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and after completing\n\nthree years of continuous service, he was treated\n\nat par\nrt with Temporary Grade 'D' Employees of\n\nDepartment of Posts w.e.f. 29.11.1992 and was\n\nheld entitled for benefits as were admissible to\n\nTemporary Grade 'D' Employees on regular basis\n\nin terms of the Communications-Instructions dated\n\n12.04.1991 and 30.11.1992. Resultantly, the deceased\n\nemployee, Mehar Chand, was granted Temporary\n\nStatus as Casual Labourer w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and\n\nwas treated at par with the Temporary Grade 'D'\n\nEmployees w.e.f. 29.11.1992 and was also granted\n\nfinancial benefits flowing from orders passed by\n\nTribunal dated 19.07.2010 by issuing implementation\n\norder dated 11.08.2011 but by restricting such\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n-5- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nbenefits for 18 months prior to filing of Original\n\nApplication. However, the deceased employee, Mehar\n\nChand, superannuated from service on 08.06.2012,\n\n.\n\nwithout being granted the pensionary benefits. Against\n\nthis, a legal notice dated 15.08.2013 was served\n\nrequesting for grant of pension and other retiral\n\nbenefits but the claim was rejected by Respondent-\n\nof\nSenior Superintendent of Post Offices, Mandi, on\n\n17.09.2013 [at page 54 of paper book] on the\n\nground,\nrt\nthat since the deceased employee had\n\nretired from service on 08.06.2012 without being\n\nregularized, therefore, he was not entitled for retiral\n\nbenefits as were admissible to regular Grade 'D'\n\nEmployees by the respondents.\n\n2(i). In Second round of litigation, i.e. OA\n\nNo. 1593-HP/2013, the deceased employee, Mehar\n\nChand, assailed the rejection order dated 17.09.2013\n\nand prayed for granting pensionary-retiral benefits\n\nfor temporary service rendered by treating the\n\nsaid service at par with regular service as per\n\nthe judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd.) & Ors.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n-6- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\netc. versus Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n\n& Anr. etc. reported in 1990 SCC Suppl. 1113\n\nand the Instructions dated 30.11.1992 and other\n\n.\n\njudgment(s), including the judgments passed in the\n\ncase of Shyam Lal Shukla [OA No.1626/2005,\n\ndecided on 28.07.2019, which was upheld by the\n\nAllahabad High Court, in Civil Misc.

In compliance\n\nto the orders passed by the Learned Tribunal\n\non 04.07.2014 [at pages 56 to 60 of paper book],\n\nRespondents rejected the case on 21.10.2014 [at\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n-7- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\npage 36 of paper book], on the ground, that once\n\nthe deceased employee, Mehar Chand, retired from\n\nservice without being regularized, therefore, the retiral\n\n.\n\nbenefits including pension cannot be granted to him.\n\nCASE SET UP BY DECEASED MEHAR CHAND\nIN THIRD ROUND OF LITIGATION LEADING\nTO PASSING OF IMPUGNED ORDER DATED\n\n28.10.2015 [ANNEXURE A-5]:\n\n3. In third round of litigation, i.e. O.A. No. 063\n\nof\n/00161/2014, the deceased employee, Mehar Chand,\n\nassailed the rejection orders dated 17.09.2013 and\nrt\ndated 21.10.2014 with the twin prayers, i.e. firstly,\n\nto grant regularization to him from the date junior\n\nMoti Ram was regularized and secondly, to grant\n\nretiral benefits [including pensionary benefits] by\n\ntaking into account temporary service {rendered after\n\ngrant of Temporary Status and continuous service} by\n\ntreating such temporary service at par with service\n\nrendered by Grade 'D' Employees on regular basis\n\nand based on such temporary service the pensionary\n\nbenefits, were granted to Shyam Lal Shukla, who\n\nwas made to superannuate from service in temporary\n\ncapacity, without granting regularization despite having\n\nrendered two decades of service as temporary employee\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n-8- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nunder the Respondents. In this backdrop, the deceased\n\nemployee, namely Mehar Chand had filed OA No 063\n\n/00161/2014, seeking following reliefs:-\n\n.\n\n\"(i) That the impugned orders dated 21.10.2014\n\n(A-1, 17.09.2013 (A-6/A) be quashed and\nset aside being wholly illegal and arbitrary.\n\n(ii) That it be declared that the applicant is\n\nentitled to pensionary benefits w.e.f. 8.5.2012\nwith all the consequential benefits along\nwith 18% interest per annum.\n\nof\n\n(iii) That the applicant be extended the benefit\nof the judgment in the case of\nShyam Lal\nShukla\n(Supra).\"\n\nSTAND OF RESPONDENTS BEFORE LEARNED\nrt\nTRIBUNAL:\n\n4. In Reply to OA No. 063/00161/2014, i.e.\n\nthird round of litigation [which is subject matter\n\nof instant petition], the Respondents filed a Written\n\nStatement-Reply on Affidavit of Senior Superintendent\n\nof Post Offices, Mandi. Stand of Respondents in Reply-\n\nAffidavit was that deceased employee, Mehar Chand,\n\nretired on attaining the age of superannuation on\n\n08.06.2012 and the alleged junior, Moti Ram was\n\nnot regularized on the date of superannuation of\n\nthe deceased employee, namely Mehar Chand on\n\n08.06.2012 whereas, the aforesaid Moti Ram, was\n\nregularized subsequently in the month of November\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n-9- ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n2012 and therefore, the claim for regularization\n\nwas stated to be not tenable. So far as the claim\n\nfor pensionary benefits is concerned, it was stated\n\n.\n\nthat once deceased employee, Mehar Chand was not\n\na regular employee of the Department and therefore,\n\nthe pension was not admissible. In this backdrop\n\nthe Respondents prayed for dismissal of the Original\n\nof\nApplication.\n\nREJOINDER BY ORIGINAL APPLICANT BEFORE\nLEARNED CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL:\n\nrt\n\n5. Deceased Employee, Mehar Chand, filed a\n\nrejoinder, stating that the issue as to whether a\n\nTemporary Employee was entitled for pensionary benefits\n\nhas already been put at rest by Learned Allahabad\n\nBench of the Tribunal, in the case of Shyam Lal\n\nShukla, mandating that a Temporary Employee who\n\nwas conferred the Temporary Status and thereafter\n\nrendered temporary service till superannuation was to\n\nbe granted the service benefits, including pensionary\n\nbenefits as were admissible to Grade 'D' Employees\n\non regular employees. Meaning thereby, that in case\n\na temporary employee superannuated from government\n\nservice without being regularized (due to inaction of\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 10 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\ngovernment inaction) therefore, the Original Applicant,\n\nnamely, Mehar Chand was entitled to the pensionary\n\nbenefits as granted to\nShyam Lal Shukla\n(supra).\n\n.\n\nIt was averred in Para 4(iv) that Respondents did\n\nnot consider the case of deceased Original Applicant-\n\npetitioner, Mehar Chand for regularization against\n\npost of MTS Grade 'D' and had the case been\n\nof\nconsidered in true perspective then, he would have\n\nbeen regularized. In Para 4 (xiv), the entitlement\n\nof the\nrtdeceased Original Applicant-Petitioner for\n\nretiral benefits was asserted to be squarely covered\n\nby the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd.) & Ors.\n\netc. versus Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. &\n\nAnr, 1990 Suppl. SCC 1113. In above backdrop,\n\ndeceased employee Mehar Chand had claimed the\n\nretiral benefits, including pension, on the basis of\n\ntemporary service rendered w.e.f. 23.11.1989 till his\n\nsuperannuation on 08.06.2012 with the prayer to\n\nrelease all consequential benefits.\n\nORIGINAL APPLICANT MEHAR CHAND DIED\nDURING PENDENCY OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE\nTRIBUNAL:\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 11 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n6.

Though in OA No 063/00161/2014, the\n\nDeceased Original Applicant-Petitioner, namely, Mehar\n\nChand, {which is subject matter of controversy in\n\ninstant writ proceedings} had primarily sought two\n\nreliefs i.e. firstly, seeking quashing of the rejection\n\norders dated 21.10.2014 and 17.09.2013 and claiming\n\nregularization for the prolonged temporary service\n\nrendered from 29.11.1989 for more than two\n\ndecades and secondly, for retiral benefits, including\n\npension even if aforesaid employee superannuated\n\non 08.06.2012 without having been regularized, in\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 12 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nthe light of the mandate of the Honble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union (infra)\n\nand Establishment Rule 154-A of the Posts and\n\n.\n\nTelegraph Ministerial Manual {at Page 79 of paper\n\nbook} by mandating that contingent paid/part time\n\nChowkidars shall be brought on regular establishment\n\nand such employees shall be treated as a regular\n\nof\nemployee and in terms of the order passed by\n\nthe Allahabad Bench of Tribunal in case of Shyam\nrt\nLal Shukla, which has attained finality also entitles\n\na temporary Government Servant who superannuates\n\nfrom service, without having been regularized is also\n\nentitled for pensionary benefits.\n\nTo the dismay of the Original Applicant,\n\nthe Learned Central Administrative Tribunal dismissed\n\nthe Original Application by passing Impugned Order\n\non 28.10.2015 [Annexure P-5], disallowing the claim\n\nfor regularization on the ground that once no junior\n\nwas regularized and the named junior, Moti Ram\n\nwas regularized in month of November 2012, after\n\nsuperannuation of the Original Applicant, namely Mehar\n\nChand. The operative part of the Impugned Order\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 13 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\ndated 28.10.2015 [Annexure P-5], reads as under:-\n\n\"6. Learned counsel for the respondents stated\nthat as per the counter reply filed on\nbehalf of the respondents, Sh. Moti Ram\n\n.\n\nwas appointed as regular MTS Group 'D'\n\nin November, 2012 whereas the services\nof the applicant were dispensed on\n08.06.2012 on attaining the age of 60\n\nyears. Learned counsel further stated that\nmemo dated 10.11.2010 (Annexure A-8)\n\nof\nwas not an order regarding regularization of\nthe services of Sh. Moti Ram and hence\nthe applicant could not rely on the same\nto claim regularization from the same\nrt date as Sh. Moti Ram and pensionary\n\nbenefits on account of his service.\n\n7. We have given our careful consideration\nto the matter. In the earlier round of\n\nlitigation in OA No. 1593/HP/2013 decided\non 04.07.2014, it has been directed as\nfollows:-\n\n\"Hence, the respondents are directed\nto re-examine the case of the applicant\n\nfor regularization and if any junior\nof the applicant has been regularized\n\nprior to his date of superannuation\non 08.06.2012 the applicant's claim for\nregularization may also be considered.\nIt is to state the obvious that if\nthe applicant is regularized, he would\nbe entitled to pension from the date\nhe retired from service Such\nconsideration may be effected within\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 14 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nthree months of a date of receipt of\na certified copy of this order being\nserved upon the respondents and the\napplicant may be apprised about the\ndecision in the matter.\"\n\n.\n\nIt is in response to this order that the\nimpugned order dated 21 10 2014 has been\npassed The respondents have categorically\n\nstated that Moti Ram whose case has\nbeen referred to by the applicant was\nappointed as regular MTS Grove in\n\nof\nNovember, 2012. Perusal of the memo\nno. B-2/Moti Ram/2010, dated 10.11.2010\n(Annexure A-8) shows that this was an\nrt\norder regarding posting of Sh Moti Ram\nTemporary status Casual Labourer treated\n\nat par with Temporary Group 'D' employees,\nas Group 'D' against vacant post at Sub\nPost Office, Manali. In the endorsement\n\nit is seen that copy no.1 is endorsed to\nMoti Ram Temporary Group 'D'. Mandi\nHO. This order dated 10.11.2010 cannot\n\nbe treated as an order regularizing the\n\nservices of Sh. Moti Ram. It is merely\na posting/deployment order. Hence, since\nthe applicant has not been able to\n\nestablish that any person junior to him\nwas regularized prior to the date when\nhe superannuated on 08.06.2012, his\nclaim for regularization prior to his\ndate of superannuation cannot succeed.\nThe judgments regarding\nShyam Lal\nShukla\n(supra),\nUOI & Ors.

Sri Singhal has relied on the\njudgment of Central Administrative Tribunal,\n\nLucknow Bench, Lucknow passed in Original\nApplication No. 509 of 2004. We have perused\n\nthe said judgment\n. In the said case, the\nlearned Tribunal has not taken note of the\n\nScheme framed by the Department dated\n12.4.2001 and paragraph 17 of the Scheme\nwhere it is clearly provided that no recruitment\nwill made from open market for Group D\nposts (except on compassionate appointment)\ntill casual labours with requisite qualifications\nare available to fill up the posts in question.\nMoreover, the Tribunal has also mis-construed\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 40 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nRule 154 (a) as it has not appreciated\nthe said Rule in correct prospective.

The said judgement has no application\nin the present case as in the present\n\nrt matter the Scheme has been framed by the\nPostal Department in compliance of the\norder of the Supreme Court and the said\n\nScheme has been approved by the Supreme\nCourt. Thus the Postal Department /Petitioner\nherein cannot resile from its obligation to\n\nimplement the said Scheme in letter and\nspirit. In the background of the aforesaid\nfacts we are satisfied that there is no\n\nerror in the impugned judgment of the\nTribunal and it does not call for interference\n\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution.

In our considered view,\n\nafter the conferment of the temporary\nstatus upon the present respondent, he\n\nwas entitled for benefits which are\naccruable to a regular Group 'D' employee\nafter completion of three years of\n\nof\nservice on temporary basis.

The extension of significant\nelements from the 4th and 5th\nCPC\nto\nthe appellants further cements their\n\nof\nplea of being employed in governmental\nfunctions.\n\n31. As held in\nVinod Kumar\n(supra), \"the\nrt essence of employment and the rights\nthereof cannot be merely determined\n\nby the initial terms of appointment\nwhen the actual course of employment\nhas evolved significantly over time.\"\n\n32. This Court fully associates with this\nprinciple and finds it wholly applicable\n\nin the present case, especially in light\nof the administrative orders and Board\n\nproceedings referred to supra that have\nconsistently treated the appellants as\n\nequivalent to regular government\nemployees. The mere classification of\nemployees as 'temporary' or 'permanent'\nis not merely a matter of nomenclature\nbut carries significant legal implications,\nparticularly in terms of service benefits\nand protections.\n\n33. In the present case, the totality of\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 55 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\ncircumstances indicates that despite\ntheir formal classification as temporary\nemployees, the appellants' employment\nbears substantial hallmarks of regular\ngovernment service. The denial of\n\n.\n\npensionary benefits solely on the\n\nbasis of their temporary status, without\ndue consideration of these factors,\n\nappears to be an oversimplification\nof their employment relationship\nwith the government. This approach\n\nof\nruns the risk of creating a class of\nemployees who, despite serving the\n\nrtgovernment for decades in a manner\nindistinguishable from regular employees,\nare deprived of the benefits and protections\n\ntypically accorded to government servants.\n\n34. Thus, we are of the opinion that the\ndenial of pensionary benefits to the\n\nappellants is not tenable or justifiable\nin the eyes of law as the same is\narbitrary and violates the fundamental\n\nrights as guaranteed by\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution of India. It\nis indeed relevant to note that the\nappellants' batch seems to be the last\n\nin their genre of SSD Fund temporary\nemployees and thus, manifestly, the\ndirection to extend the benefits of the\n6th\nCPC\nand the RP Rules to the\nappellants shall not form a precedent\nso as to have a detrimental effect on the\nfinancial health of the SSD Fund.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 56 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n19. While dealing with denial of claim for\n\nregularization for want of vacancies, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in Civil Appeal No(s).8558 of 2018,\n\n.\n\nin Re;\nDharam Singh & Ors versus State of\n\nU.P. & Anr.\n, decided on 19.08.2025 has outlined\n\nthat long-term extraction of work under temporary\n\nlabels corrodes confidence in public administration\n\nof\nand offends the promise of equal protection and\n\nsuch adhocism erodes not only the dignity of\nrt\nworkers and their livelihood but such exploitation\n\npractice offend\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. After deprecating such practice,\n\ndirections were issued to accord the benefit of\n\nregularization to Casual Incumbents, in the following\n\nterms:-\n\n\"19. Having regard to the long, undisputed\nservice of the appellants, the admitted\nperennial nature of their duties, and the\n\nmaterial indicating vacancies and comparator\nregularizations we issue the following\ndirections:\n\ni. Regularization and creation of\nSupernumerary posts: All appellants\nshall stand regularized with effect\nfrom 24.04.2002, the date on which the\nHigh Court directed a fresh\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 57 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nrecommendation by the Commission\nand a fresh decision by the State on\nsanctioning posts for the appellants.\nFor this purpose, the State and the\nsuccessor establishment (U.P. Education\n\n.\n\nServices Selection Commission) shall\n\ncreate supernumerary posts in\nthe corresponding cadres, Class-III\n\n(Driver or equivalent) and Class-IV\n(Peon/Attendant/Guard or equivalent)\nwithout any caveats or preconditions.\n\nof\nOn regularization, each appellant shall\nbe placed at not less than the minimum\n\nrt of the regular pay-scale for the post,\nwith protection of last-drawn wages\nif higher and the appellants shall be\n\nentitled to the subsequent increments\nin the pay scale as per the pay grade.\nFor seniority and promotion, service\n\nshall count from the date of\nregularization as given above.\n\nii. Financial consequences and arrears:\n\nEach appellant shall be paid as arrears\n\nthe full difference between (a) the pay\nand admissible allowances at the\nminimum of the regular pay-level for\n\nthe post from time to time, and (b)\nthe amounts actually paid, for the\nperiod from 24.04.2002 until the date\nof regularization/retirement/death, as\nthe case may be. Amounts already\npaid under previous interim directions\nshall be so adjusted. The net arrears\nshall be released within three months\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 58 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nand if in default, the unpaid amount\nshall carry compound interest at 6%\nper annum from the date of default\nuntil payment.\n\niii. Retired appellants: Any appellant who\n\n.\n\nhas already retired shall be granted\nregularization with effect from 24.04.2002\nuntil the date of superannuation for\n\npay fixation, arrears under clause (ii),\nand recalculation of pension, gratuity\nand other terminal dues. The revised\n\nof\npension and terminal dues shall be\npaid within three months of this\nrt Judgement.\n\niv. Deceased appellants: In the case of\n\nAppellant No. 5 and any other appellant\nwho has died during pendency, his/her\nlegal representatives on record shall\nbe paid the arrears under clause (ii)\n\nupto the date of death, together with\nall terminal/retiral dues recalculated\n\nconsistently with clause (i), within three\nmonths of this Judgement.\n\nv. Compliance affidavit: The Principal\nSecretary, Higher EducationDepartment,\n\nGovernment of Uttar Pradesh, or the\nSecretary of the U.P. Education Services\nSelection Commission or the prevalent\ncompetent authority, shall file an\naffidavit of compliance before this Court\nwithin four months of this Judgement.\n\n20. We have framed these directions\ncomprehensively because, case after case,\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 59 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\norders of this Court in such matters\nhave been met with fresh technicalities,\nrolling \"reconsiderations,\" and administrative\ndrift which further prolongs the\ninsecurity for those who have already\n\n.\n\nlabored for years on daily wages.\n\nTherefore, we have learned that Justice\nin such cases cannot rest on simpliciter\n\ndirections, but it demands imposition of\nclear duties, fixed timelines, and verifiable\ncompliance. As a constitutional employer,\n\nof\nthe State is held to a higher standard\nand therefore it must organize its\nperennial\nrt workers on a sanctioned\nfooting, create a budget for lawful\nengagement, and implement judicial\n\ndirections in letter and spirit. Delay to\nfollow these obligations is not mere\nnegligence but rather it is a conscious\n\nmethod of denial that erodes livelihoods\nand dignity for these workers. The operative\nscheme we have set here comprising\n\nof creation of supernumerary posts, full\nregularization, subsequent financial benefits,\n\nand a sworn affidavit of compliance, is\ntherefore a pathway designed to convert\n\nrights into outcomes and to reaffirm that\nfairness in engagement and transparency\nin administration are not matters of\ngrace, but obligations under\nArticles 14\n,\nand\nof the Constitution of\nIndia.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 60 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n20. Based on the discussion made hereinabove,\n\nthis Court deprecates the Learned Tribunal in not\n\n.\n\nadjudicating the claim of the deceased petitioner-\n\nnamely, Mehar Chand for pension for continuous\n\nand uninterrupted temporary service rendered after\n\ngrant of temporary status from 29.11.1989 till\n\nof\nsuperannuation on 08.06.2012 and the resultant\n\nclaim of present petitioner no 1-widow Soma Devi\nrt\nfor family pension from 28.01.2015 till day, despite\n\nthe entitlement for pensionary benefits in view of\n\nthe settled law i.e. judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in Jagrit Mazdoor Union and the provision\n\nof Establishment Rule 154-A of the Posts and\n\nTelegraph Ministerial Manual {at Page 79 of paper\n\nbook} (supra} and the order/judgment passed by\n\nAllahabad Bench of Tribunal, which was upheld\n\nby the High Court and by the Honble Supreme\n\nCourt in case of\nShyam Lal Shukla\n(supra), which\n\nstands implemented and based on the judgement\n\nin the case of Shyam Lal Shukla, the entitlement\n\nfor pensionary benefits as granted by the Learned\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 61 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nTribunal was upheld by a Coordinate Division\n\nBench of this Court in the case of\nPianu Ram\n\n(supra) and by the Punjab and Haryana High\n\n.\n\nCourt in the case of\nSunil Soni\n(supra). Even,\n\nthe right and entitlement for pensionary benefits\n\nto deceased petitioner and his widow is borne\n\nout from the CCS (TS) Rules, as\nreferred to above\n.\n\nof\nOnce the entitlement of petitioner for pensionary\n\nbenefits is apparently established in the light of\nrt\nthe settled position of law and the Rules coupled\n\nwith the fact that the pensionary benefits have\n\nbeen granted to other similarly placed temporary\n\nemployees, who had rendered temporary service\n\nfor continuous service, on whole time by performing\n\nsame work, job, duties and functions as was\n\nperformed by regular employees but were retired\n\nwithout being regularized, and the Courts have\n\naffirmed the right of such temporary employees\n\nin respondent department for pensionary benefits,\n\nby granting \"deemed regularization\" therefore, the\n\npetitioner being similarly placed, deserves similar\n\ntreatment as granted to others so as to ensure\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 62 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nparity and to obviate the charge of discrimination.\n\nTreating petitioner differently, shall lead to \"treating\n\nequals as unequal\", which cannot be permitted to\n\n.\n\nsustain. Failure on the part of Learned Tribunal\n\nto exercise its jurisdiction by not adjudicating\n\nthe claim has resulted in miscarriage of justice\n\nand denying of pensionary benefits to the deceased\n\nof\nOriginal Applicant Mehar Chand and the resultant\n\ndenial of family pension to the present petitioner\nrt\nno 1 has violated the social security, by way of\n\npensionary benefits, and the inaction is interdicted.\n\nNow, coming to Impugned Order dated\n\n28.10.2015, (Annexure P-5) dismissing the claim of\n\ndeceased Original Applicant-petitioner, Mehar Chand\n\nfor regularization, this Court is of the considered\n\nview, that the view taken by the Learned Tribunal\n\nis untenable, for the reason, that firstly, non-\n\nregularization amounts to exploitative practice by\n\nmaking the deceased employee, Mehar Chand w.e.f.\n\n29.11.1989 till superannuation on 08.06.2012;\n\nand secondly, the non-availability of vacancy for\n\nregularization cannot be ground to deny benefit\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 63 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nof regularization, when as per Establishment Rule\n\n154-A, the Respondents were bound to bring the\n\nemployee-Mehar Chand on regular establishment\n\n.\n\nand to treat him as deemed regular employee\n\nwhich was not done; and thirdly, once the right\n\nof temporary employees, who were granted temporary\n\nstatus for being brought on regular establishment\n\nof\nand were mandatorily to be treated as \"regular\n\nemployees\" by virtue of Rule 154-A, then, the\nrt\nrights acquired under Rule 154-A could not be\n\npermitted to be negated by Respondents due to\n\nthe inaction or lethargy of respondents in not\n\ntaking timely action for giving effect to right of\n\nconsideration and upon consideration for actual\n\nregularization under aforesaid Rule; and fourthly,\n\nthe rights acquired in terms of the judgements\n\nin the cases of\nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n(supra)\n\nand\nShyam Lal Shukla\n, (supra) cannot be negated\n\nwhen, the latter judgement has attained finality\n\nand stands implemented also; and fifthly, even\n\ndeceased employee-Mehar Chand is similarly placed\n\nwith\nShyam Lal Shukla\n(supra) as both incumbents\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 64 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nwere granted the temporary status in 1989 and\n\nafter grant of temporary status both stood retired\n\nfrom service after rendering decades of temporary\n\n.\n\nservice (ranging between more than 17 years in\n\ncase of Shyam Lal Shukla and more than 20\n\nyears in case of Mehar Chand) and both stood\n\nretired from service without being regularized and\n\nof\nby virtue of judicial intervention, Shyam Lal Shukla\n\nwas granted pensionary benefits by treating and\nrt\nconferring benefit of \"deemed regularization\" then,\n\nthe petitioner deserves similar treatment so as to\n\nensure similar treatment in terms of the mandate\n\nof the Honble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh versus Arvind Kumar &\n\nOrs\n(2015) 1 SCC 347 and Siraj Ahmad versus\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh (2019) 17 SCC 626 and\n\nin Lt Col.\nSuprita Chandel versus Union of\n\nIndia, Civil Appeal 1943 of 2022, that the benefit\n\nof a judgement has to be granted to all similarly\n\nplaced incumbents without forcing them to come\n\nto the Courts; and sixthly, after following the\n\njudgement in case of Shyam Lal Shukla, another\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 65 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nCoordinate Bench of this Court in case of\nPianu\n\nRam\n(supra) and by the Punjab and Haryana High\n\nCourt in case of\nSunil Soni\n(supra), granted\n\n.\n\nregularization or deemed regularization so as to\n\nenable retiree for pensionary benefits for having\n\nrendered decades of temporary service after being\n\ngranted temporary status then, deceased employee\n\nof\n\n-Mehar Chand was entitled for the same treatment,\n\nwhich has been overlooked by the Learned Tribunal;\n\nrt\nand seventhly, the rights acquired and the effect\n\nand applicability of the settled law cannot in\n\nany manner be curtailed or restricted or negated\n\nby the Respondents; and eighthly, the denial of\n\nregularization for want of vacancy speaks volumes\n\nof inaction of respondents, when, the creation of\n\na post was an act to be performed by the\n\nrespondents over which the employee had no say;\n\nand ninthly, creation of posts for regularization in\n\nnormal parlance, may be an administrative act,\n\nbut in fact-situation of the instant case, once Rule\n\n154-A and judgments of the Honble Supreme Court\n\nin the case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union and similar\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 66 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\ndirections in case of Shyam Lal Shukla mandates\n\nto confer \"temporary status\" after completion of\n\none year of continuous service as casual labourer\n\n.\n\nwith 240 days (which was 206 days in offices\n\nwith five days week) and then to bring \"temporary\n\nemployees on regular establishment\" and in treating\n\ntemporary employees as \"regular employees\". The\n\nof\nconferment of temporary status was ignored and\n\nit was after judicial intervention that Respondents\nrt\nissued an order on 11.08.2011 (at page 47 of\n\npaper book) granting temporary status to deceased\n\nemployee-Mehar Chand w.e.f. 29.11.1989 (at page\n\n47 of paper book). After issuance of the orders\n\ndated 11.08.2011, the Respondents were under\n\nan obligation to create the posts (if not available)\n\nso as to bring such \"temporary employees on\n\nregular establishment\" and in treating temporary\n\nemployees as \"regular employees.\" Such an accrued\n\nright to be considered for regularization cannot be\n\nfrustrated or defeated due to the inaction and\n\nlethargy of in respondents, in \"not creating posts\"\n\nfor giving effect to regularization of the deceased\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 67 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nemployee, Mehar Chand and all others, after grant\n\nof temporary status on 11.08.2011 retrospectively\n\ndespite having rendered more than two decades\n\n.\n\n{23 years' service}; and tenthly, the Respondents\n\nhave not placed on record any cogent and convincing\n\nas to what prevented the authorities from creating\n\nthe post (if not available) for regularizing deceased\n\nof\npetitioner-Mehar Chand and others after issuance\n\nof orders on 11.08.2011 till his superannuation\nrt\non 08.06.2012; and lastly, even the plea of the\n\nRespondents that Moti Ram-junior was regularized\n\nin November 2012 after the retirement of Mehar\n\nChand on 08.06.2012, goes on to establish that\n\nRespondents have slept over the matter, remained\n\nnegligent, failed to take effective and timely action\n\nfor creating the posts for regularization, with the\n\nintent to defeat the de-facto and dejure right of\n\nconsideration and resultant regularization, which\n\nhad accrued under the Rules and settled law, as\n\ndiscussed hereinabove. It is not the case of the\n\nRespondents-Authorities that the petitioner had not\n\nrendered more than 23 years of temporary service.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 68 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nIt is not the case of Respondents that service\n\nrecord was not upto the mark. It is not the case\n\nof the Respondents that aforesaid employee-Mehar\n\n.\n\nChand was not entitled for \"being brought on\n\nregular establishment and to be treated as regular\n\nemployee in terms of the Rules and settled law\n\nand it is not disputed that in similar fact-situation,\n\nof\nthe benefits of regularization/deemed regularization\n\nhas been granted extended to Shyam Lal Shukla\nrt\nand to\nPianu Ram and Sunil Soni\n(supra) by\n\nRespondents. The fundamental right of consideration\n\nand resultant regularization which had accrued\n\non the basis of Rule 154-A and settled law could\n\nneither not be defeated, restricted or negated due\n\nto inaction and omission of Respondents in not\n\ntaking effective and timely steps for creating posts,\n\nso as to make the accrued right meaningful and\n\npracticable. Inaction of not creating the posts for\n\nregularization reveals exploitative practice, which\n\nsmacks of unreasonableness and arbitrariness in\n\naction, only to deprive the deceased employee-Mehar\n\nChand of regularization prior to retirement on\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 69 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\n08.08.2012. Ignoring these material aspects, the\n\nImpugned Order dated 28.10.2015, {Annexure P-5},\n\npassed by disallowing the claim of Mehar Chand\n\n.\n\nfor regularization is interdicted by this Court.\n\n21. Resultantly, the deceased employee-Mehar\n\nChand is held entitled for regularization/deemed\n\nregularization prior to his retirement on 08.06.2012\n\nof\nin view of having rendered more than two decades\n\nof service rendered after grant of temporary status\nrt\non 23.11.1989 till his retirement on 08.06.2012.\n\nTreating an employee on temporary service amounts\n\nto creating a class on basis of mere nomenclature\n\nor designation, ignoring the fact that the service\n\nperformed by employee had the hallmark of regular\n\nservice in terms of work, job, duties and functions.\n\nMere status or nomenclature cannot be made the\n\nbasis for denying benefits and protections, including\n\npensionary benefits. Such deprivation is arbitrary\n\nand violates fundamental rights as guaranteed by\n\nArticles 14\nand\nand reiterating of such right\n\nby the Honble Supreme Court in the cases of\n\nYashwant Hari Katakkar, Rajkaran and Dharam\n\n::: Downloaded on - 05/12/2025 22:46:24 :::CIS\n\n- 70 - ( 2025:HHC:39462-DB )\n\nSingh (supra).\n\n22. Accordingly, the Impugned Order dated\n\n28.10.2015 (Annexure P-5) disallowing the claim\n\n.\n\nof deceased petitioner-Mehar Chand for regularization\n\nis set-aside; and non-adjudication of the claim of\n\nthe deceased employee, Mehar Chand for pensionary\n\nbenefits w.e.f. 08.06.2012/01.07.2012 and the right\n\nof\nand claim of the present petitioner no 1, Soma Devi\n\nfor family pension w.e.f 28.01.2015 in applicable\nrt\npay scale-pay band and in revised pay scale w.e.f.\n\n01.01.2016 with pension fixation benefits from due\n\ndate, with all consequential benefits.\n\n23. Besides the above, it is clarified that the\n\ncase of the petitioners 2 and 3, namely, Raju Verma\n\nand Sunil Kumar, being sons of deceased Original\n\nApplicant, for family pension, may be examined in\n\nthe light of applicable rules and subject to eligibility,\n\nadmissible share of family pension, be released, if\n\nany, in accordance with law.\n\n24.
