Accordingly, as\n\nagreed to by the learned counsel for the parties, these writ\n\npetitions were clubbed to be heard and disposed of together.\n\nThese matters were heard on 19.12.2023, 09.01.2024,\n\n11.01.2024, 23.01.2024, 01.02.2024, 20.02.2024, 27.02.2024 &\n\n05.03.2024and accordingly, are disposed of by this common\n\nJudgment and Order.\n\n2. In all these writ petitions, the Office Memorandum dated\n\n18.01.2023 issued has been put to challenge. The writ petitioners\n\nalong with the various reserved categories namely ST(H) and\n\nST(P) urged that clauses (iii) & (iv) of the impugned OM dated\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 35 of 103\n\n18.01.2023 are contrary to law as the same are violative of and\n\nruns counter to the Judgment and Order dated 06.06.2022\n\npassed by a Co-ordinate Bench in\nBhagawan Pator Vs. State of\n\nAssam & Ors\n[W.P.(C) No. 5005/2016] as well as\nIvy Gohain\n\nDasgupta Vs. Bhagawan Pator & Ors. (W.A. No.\n46/2023).\n\n3. Mr. D.K. Das, learned counsel for the writ petitioners would\n\naddress this Court as a counsel for the writ petitioners that the\n\nquestions of law and the issues raised are similar in all these\n\nbunch of writ petitions barring certain factual details. Mr. Das has\n\nsubmitted that W.P.(C) No. 363/2023 would be the case on which\n\nhe would like to base his arguments upon. Accordingly, W.P(C)\n\nNo. 363/2023 is taken up as a lead case.\n\n4. Before the detailed arguments are referred to, it is\n\nnecessary to state that the dispute between the parties arise as\n\nthe writ petitioners claim that their rights which flow out of\nArticle\n\n16 (4A)\nof the Constitution of India have been denied to them.\n\nUnder the said Article, the State is empowered to make any\n\nprovisions for reservations in matters of promotion to any class or\n\nclasses of posts in the services under the State in favour of the\n\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, which are in the opinion\n\nof the State, not adequately represented in any services under the\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 36 of 103\n\nState and therefore by way of the amendment,\nArticle 16 (4A)\n\nwas brought in to the Constitution power to deal with such\n\nmatters was conferred on the State for making adequate\n\nprovisions for reservation in promotion with consequential\n\nseniority.\n\n5. The State Legislature had enacted the\nAssam Scheduled\n\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Vacancies in Services\n\nand Posts) Act, 1978\n(in short 'the Act of 1978') with the purpose\n\nto provide for reservation of vacancies in services and posts for\n\nthe members of Scheduled Casts and Scheduled Tribes.\nSection 5\n\nof the Act of 1978 specifies the percentage for reservation for\n\nmembers of the ST and SC community. The Judgment of the\n\nApex Court in\nIndra Sawhany Vs. Union of India & Ors\n, reported\n\nin 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 laid down the law the reservation is\n\npermissible at the stage of initial recruitment and not in the stage\n\nof promotion.\n\nConsequent upon the Judgment of the Apex Court\n\nin\nIndra Sawhany\n(Supra), the Parliament brought about the\n\nConstitutional Amendment by incorporating\nArticle 16 (4A)\nwhich\n\nempowers the State to make any provisions for reservation in\n\nmatters of promotion in any class or classes or posts in the\n\nservices under the State in favour of Scheduled Castes and\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 37 of 103\n\nScheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the State are not\n\nadequately represented the services under the State.\n\nThe Apex\n\nCourt by its judgment rendered in\nR.K. Sabarwal Vs. State of\n\nPunjab\n, reported in AIR 1995 SC 1371 held that the reservation is\n\nto be determined on the basis of the number of posts in the cadre\n\nand not on the basis of the vacancies and further those reserved\n\ncategory candidates who are promoted or appointed on merit\n\nshould be adjusted against unreserved posts and not against\n\nposts meant for the reserved category. Consequent to the said\n\nJudgment, an amendment was brought about in the\nAssam Act\nof\n\n1978. Section 5-A was inserted by which maintenance of post\n\nbased roster register was brought in to give effect to the\n\nreservation of SC and ST communities.\nSection 5-A(iii)\nof the Act\n\nof 1978 provides that the roster is to be operated as a\n\nreplacement and not as a running account. Further Section 5A(xiii)\n\nprovides that the promotions are to be on the post based roster\n\nand the policy of replacement by filling up vacant post for eligible\n\npersons from the respective category by special drive so that the\n\nprescribed percentage of reservation is maintainable. Pursuant to\n\nthe Constitutional Amendment of\nArticle 16 (4A)\n, by Office\n\nMemorandum bearing No. ABP.59/96/163 dated 12.03.2002\n\nbrought in by the State of Assam, the principle of fixation of\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 38 of 103\n\nseniority of reserved candidates vis-à-vis General candidates in\n\npromotional posts- in other words, the benefit of consequential\n\nseniority of reserved category candidates over General category\n\ncandidates in the promotional posts was notified. The\n\nConstitutional Amendment of\nArticle 16 (4A)\ncame to be assailed\n\nin the Apex Court and by Judgment rendered in M. Nagraj & Ors.\n\nVs. union of India & Ors, reported in (2006) 8 SCC 212, it was\n\nheld that (i) this Amendment does not affect the right of equality\n\nwhich is a basic structure of the Constitution of India; (ii) The\n\nright of the State to provide for reservations in promotion and\n\nconsequential seniority was upheld and also held that the\n\nconsequential seniority is a concept purely of service\n\njurisprudence. The incorporation of consequential seniority would\n\nnot violate the mandate of equality; (iii) The Apex Court, however,\n\nheld that before providing such reservation in promotion, the\n\nState will need to have quantifiable data to show backwardness,\n\ninadequacy of representations of these classes in service and\n\nbalancing the maintenance of efficiency in services as mandated\n\nunder\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution of India. The unit and\n\nprocedure the collection of the quantifiable data was left the\n\ndomain of the executive.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 39 of 103\n\n6. Pursuant to the Judgment of M. Nagraj (Supra), the State of\n\nAssam constituted a one-man Commission to study the need for\n\nreservation by collecting quantifiable data and render its\n\nrecommendation. The one-man Commission submitted its report\n\nwhich was accepted by the State Government. Based on the\n\napproval, the State Government proscribed a procedure carry out\n\nreservation and promotion by way of issuing the Office\n\nMemorandum bearing No. TAD/BC/68/2011/Pt-I/146 dated\n\n29.12.2014.\n\n7. This Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 came to be\n\nchallenged in W.P.(C) No. 1560/2015 (\nEquality Forum Vs. The\n\nState of Assam & Ors.\n). By Judgment and Order dated 23.12.2015,\n\nthe One-Man-Commission was set aside holding that the said\n\nreport would be of no legal consequence and would not enable\n\nthe State to give effect to the provisions of the Act of 1978.\nIt\n\nwas held that reservation in promotion would remain in a dormant\n\nstate till the till the exercise of collection of quantifiable data\n\nrelating to the three constitutional requirements as mandated in\n\nM Nagaraj (supra) and UP Power Corporation Ltd-Vs- Rajesh\n\nKumar, reported in (2012) 7 SCC 1 are complied with by the State\n\nwhile seeking to inform the provisions of\nArticle 16 (4A).\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 40 of 103\n\n8. The Government of Assam in pursuance to the Judgment\n\nand Order dated 23.12.2015 passed in W.P(C) No. 1560/2015\n\n(\nEquality Forum Vs. The State of Assam & Ors.\n) brought out the\n\nOffice Memorandum dated 03.08.2016. By the said Office\n\nMemorandum, the Government again laid down the guidelines to\n\nbe followed for consideration of promotion in any cadre in any\n\nestablishments including those are the reserved categories.\n\nAmongst the various conditions\nlaid down in\nthe Office\n\nMemorandum dated 03.08.2016 under Clause (iv), it was provided\n\nthat during promotional process where the stipulated percentage\n\nin respect of any reserved category is met, but in the gradation\n\nlist/seniority list, there are candidates of reserved category who\n\non merit are entitled to the promotion then his/her case would be\n\nconsidered for promotion on merit if such candidate has not\n\ngained the seniority by way of any accelerated promotion earlier.\n\n9. It is the said clause (iv) in the Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.08.2016 which came to be assailed in W.P.(C) No. 5005/2016\n\n(\nBhawagan Pator Vs. State of Assam & Ors\n) and Anr. vide\n\nJudgment and Order dated 06.06.2022 to be violative of the\n\nSection 5\nof the 1978 Act and therefore is liable to be struck down.\n\nWhile holding that\nArticle 16 (4A)\nand\nArticle 16 (4B)\nbeing\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 41 of 103\n\nenabling provisions, the State is at liberty to implement its policy\n\nof giving reservations in promotion with consequential seniority\n\nand it at liberty to provide for reservation in promotion with or\n\nwithout consequential seniority. However, while\n\nimplementing/adopting/changing such policy, due process of law\n\nneeds to be followed including the dicta in M Nagran(Supra)\n\nclarified in Jarnail Singh. The learned Single Judge held that since\n\nthe Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 would hold the field\n\nuntil such policy is expressly repealed by the State, the State is\n\nnot within its competence and jurisdiction to deprive the benefit\n\nof reservation in promotion with consequential seniority to\n\nmeritorious reserved category candidates without expressly\n\nbringing any policy by superseding the benefit granted under\n\nOffice Memorandum dated 12.03.2002.\n\n10. This Judgment and Order came to subsequently assailed in\n\nthe W.A. No. 46/2023 (\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta Vs. Bhagwan Pator &\n\nOrs\n); W.A No. 239/2022 (\nEquality Forum Vs. The State of Assam\n\n& Ors\n) and W.A. No. 162/2023 (\nSanjai Kumar Mahanta Vs. The\n\nState of Assam & Ors\n). The Division Bench upon deciding this\n\nissue in its entirety held that the decision rendered in the writ\n\nappeal would prevail over all such provisions of the learned Single\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 42 of 103\n\nJudge in the Judgment and Order dated 06.06.2022 in W.P.(C) No.\n\n5005/2016 but in respect of any other provision which may not be\n\ncontrary or inconsistent with the provisions of the Judgment, the\n\nsame may prevail. The Division Bench did not uphold the findings\n\nof the learned Single Judge in so far as the interpretation of\n\nClause (iv) of the Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 is\n\nconcerned. The Division Bench further provided that the decisions\n\nrendered in the said Judgment of Division Bench in WA No.\n\n46/2023, WA No. 162/2023 and WA No. 239/2022 would prevail\n\nover all such provisions of the learned Single Judge in the\n\njudgment dated 06.06.2022 rendered in WP(C) No. 5005/2016\n\nand 5026/2016 but in respect of any other provisions which may\n\nnot be contrary or inconsistent with the provisions of this\n\njudgment the same may prevail, but with a further clarification\n\nthat if any such provisions of the judgment of the learned Single\n\nJudge is in conflict or contradictory to any of the provisions in the\n\npresent judgment, such provisions and the judgment of the\n\nlearned Single Judge stands modified accordingly. In the said\n\nDivision Bench Judgment, it was observed by the Division Bench\n\nthat Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023 had in the meantime\n\nbeen issued whereby the consequential seniority was withdrawn\n\nand the catch up principle has been reintroduced. The Division\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 43 of 103\n\nBench declined to observe anything on merit as the said Office\n\nMemorandum is under challenge before by way of separate writ\n\npetitions.\n\n11. It is this Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023 which is\n\nunder challenge in the present proceedings which requires\n\nconsideration by this Court in the present writ petition.\n\n12.

Mr. D.K. Das, learned counsel for the petitioner argues that\n\nOffice Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 which has been sought to\n\nbe superseded by the impugned Office Memorandum dated\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 48 of 103\n\n18.01.2023 cannot be permitted to be accepted inasmuch as it\n\nwill amount to overriding the provisions of the Act of 1978. The\n\nOffice Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 which was brought in by\n\nthe State, is falling from the power source from\nSections 5\nand\n5A\n\nof the Act of 1978. It is submitted that the Act of 1978 was\n\nbrought in pursuant to the Judgment of the Apex Court and\n\ntherefore, the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 must be\n\nunderstood to have been brought by the State to satisfy the\n\nConstitutional requirements relating to reservation in promotion\n\nwith consequential seniority.\n\n14. The further argument of the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner is that notwithstanding the supersession of the Office\n\nMemorandum dated 12.03.2002, the benefit conferred to the\n\nreserved category candidates of consequential seniority upon\n\npromotion is protected under\nSection 5\nof the Act of 1978 itself. It\n\nis submitted that the State is bound to provide cadre wise\n\npromotions and will adhere to seniority in the cadre and not as\n\nper the date of their initial appointments.\n\n15. It is further submitted that besides the learned Single Judge\n\nvide Judgment and Order dated 06.06.2022, even the Division\n\nBench Judgment and Order dated 10.08.2023 rendered in W.A No.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 49 of 103\n\n46/2023 & Ors did not upset the rights of the petitioners towards\n\ntheir claims for consequential seniority in reservation on\n\npromotion. It is unheard of that pursuant to reservation on\n\npromotion for the reserved category candidates, consequential\n\nseniority is denied. This the learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nsubmits was a concept which had long been abundant across the\n\ncountry and this primitive practice of denial of consequential\n\nseniority upon promotion being still followed by the State needs to\n\nbe suitably interfered with and the benefit of consequential\n\nseniority be restored to the writ petitioners.\n\n16. It is argued that if Clause (iv) of the Office Memorandum\n\ndated 18.01.2023 is to be upheld then the same would be in\n\nviolation of the Apex Court\nJudgment of R.K. Sabarwal\n(Supra)\n\ninasmuch as per Clause (iv), if a reserved category candidate\n\ncompetes on merit then the said candidate will have to be treated\n\nas a reserved category candidate which is quite opposed to the\n\nlaw\nlaid down by\nApex Court in\nR.K. Sabarwal\n(Supra). The\n\nfurther argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that\n\nthe Office Memorandum brings in the concept of \"promotions\n\ngroup-wise\". Referring to the Judgment of the Apex Court in\n\nJarnail Singh-II, it is submitted that the promotions can't be\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 50 of 103\n\ngroup-wise, it has to cadre wise. The entire unit will have to be\n\ntaken as a cadre to apply the catch up principle. It is submitted\n\nthat it is only the cadre-wise promotions which can follow and no\n\nother. As such the Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023 seeks to\n\ntake away the vested rights of the reserved category candidate\n\nwhich cannot be permitted to be taken away.\n\n17. It is also argued that where the Act of 1978 followed by the\n\nRules made thereunder are present enabling the policy of\n\nreservation in promotion then the State cannot deny these\n\nbenefits by bringing in an Office Memorandum which is conflict\n\nwith the Act and the Rules. Although the provisions of\nArticle 16\n\n(4-A)\nand\nArticle 16 (4B)\nare enabling provisions, once the\n\nprovisions are implemented by the State by bringing in the Act\n\nfollowed by the Rules, it becomes an enforceable right and\n\ntherefore, the petitioners are within their rights to seek justice\n\nfrom this Court and the respondents are to be suitably directed to\n\nrestore the vested right accrued to the petitioners by considering\n\ntheir cases and by relegating them to their places of seniority as\n\nper the benefit of reservation in promotion in consequential\n\nseniority. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner refers to and relies upon the following Judgments:\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 51 of 103\n\n\"1.\nR.K. Sabharwal and Ors. Vs. State of Punjab & Ors.\n, reported in\n(1995) 2 SCC 745;\n\n2.\nBhogeswar Saikia Vs. State of Assam & Ors\n, reported in (2010) 3\nGLT 377;\n\n3.\nParesh Chand Deka Vs.

Union of India & Ors, reported in (2019) 16\nSCC 129; and\n\n8.\nJarnail Singh & Ors. Vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta & Ors\n.\"\n\n18. Per contra, Mr. D. Mazumdar, learned Addl. Advocate\n\nGeneral, Assam strongly disputes the contentions urges by the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioners. It is submitted that both the\n\nlearned Single Judge in\nBhagawan Pator\n(Supra) as well as the\n\nDivision Bench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra) has categorically\n\nheld that the power to grant reservation in promotion and\n\nconsequential seniority is squarely lies with the State. The State\n\nmay decide to grant so or may decide not to grant such benefits.\n\nAs such, it is submitted that when the question of the power has\n\nbeen decided by the learned Single Judge and to that extent the\n\nfindings have been upheld by the Division Bench, there is no\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 52 of 103\n\nquarrel that the State is within its rights to bring out such law\n\nwhich may confer reservation on promotion with consequential\n\nseniority or may take away such provisions already granted earlier.\n\nThese findings rendered in by the Co-ordinate Bench which are\n\nupheld by the Division Bench are not in appeal and therefore,\n\nthey operate against the writ petitioners as well. It is submitted\n\nthat when the impugned Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023\n\nwas issued, the writ petition of\nBhagawan Pator\n(Supra) was\n\nalready decided. While the W.A. No. 46/2023 (Ivy Gohain\n\nDasgupta) was pending disposal.\n\nThereafter, the Division Bench\n\nupheld the catch up rule and in the absence of any further appeal\n\nby the petitioners, the present writ petitions are not maintainable\n\nas the same stands squarely covered by the Judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra) wherein it was\n\nheld that it is within the realm of the State to grant or not to\n\ngrant benefits of reservation on promotion with consequential\n\nseniority. It is submitted that unless there is a specific provision\n\nunder the Rules granting consequential seniority, it is to be\n\naccepted that \"catch up\" theory is the Rule which is to be\n\nfollowed.\n\nIt is submitted that pursuant to the Judgment rendered\n\nin\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra), it is the Division Bench Judgment\n\nwhich will prevail and not the findings of the Co-ordinate Bench\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 53 of 103\n\nmore particularly in view of paragraph-47 and 48 of the said\n\nJudgment of the Division Bench. The learned Addl.\n\nAdvocate\n\nGeneral further submits that the reference to provisions of Section\n\n5A of the 1978 Act that it mandates reservation of promotion with\n\nconsequential seniority, it is submitted that such submissions of\n\nthe petitioners are totally misplaced inasmuch as Section 5A of\n\nthe 1978 Act is only meant to maintain/identify the reservation\n\nslots in terms of the Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in\nR.K.\n\nSabarwal\n(Supra). Relying on the provisions of\nSection 5A\nof the\n\nAct of 1978, no challenge can be made to the impugned\n\nNotification by the writ petitioners. Such a challenge is completely\n\nmisplaced as\nSection 5A\nof the Act of 1978 has no connection\n\nwith consequential seniority. In support of his arguments Mr. D.\n\nMazumdar referred to and relies on the following Judgments:\n\n1.\nS. Panneer Selvam Vs. State of T.N.\n, reported in (2015) 10\nSCC 292;\n\n2.\nSudhakar Baburao Nangnure Vs. Nareshwar Raghunathrao\nShende\n, reported in (2020) 11 SCC 399;\n\n3.\nAjit Singh (2) Vs. State of Punjab\n, reported in (1999) 7 SCC\n209; and\n\n19. Mr. K.N. Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel representing\n\nthe private respondents also strongly disputes the contentions\n\nraised by the writ petitioners. He refers to the Paragraphs 45, 46,\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 54 of 103\n\n47 & 48 of the Judgment of the Division Bench in\nIvy Gohain\n\nDasgupta\n(Supra) to submit that pursuant to the decision of the\n\nDivision Bench, there is no further question required to be\n\ndecided as the Division Bench has categorically upheld the power\n\nof the State to grant or not to grant consequential seniority for\n\nreservation in promotion. He submits that there is no question of\n\nany vested rights to the reserved category candidates as it is a\n\npolicy decision which can be altered by the State and the same\n\nhas been done by the Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023.\n\nSince both the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench\n\nin\nBhagawan Pator\n(Supra) and\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra)\n\nrespectively has upheld the State's power to confer or not to\n\nconfer consequential seniority on promotion reserved category\n\ncandidates, the State by the Notification under challenge dated\n\n18.01.2023 has decided to take away the benefits which may\n\nhave been granted earlier and therefore, as there is no further\n\nappeal against the Judgment and Order passed by the Division\n\nBench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra), the decision of the Court\n\nthat the State is within its power to grant or reject such benefits\n\non promotion with consequential seniority has attained finality.\n\nIt\n\nis further submitted that the earlier Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.08.2016 has been upheld by the Division Bench in\nIvy Gohain\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 55 of 103\n\nDasgupta\n(Supra). Consequently, the Office Memorandum dated\n\n18.01.2023 is an extension thereof. It is further submitted that\n\nthe reserved categories candidates have no vested rights which\n\nthey can complain about. The learned Sr. counsel submits that no\n\nindividual facts have been pleaded by the writ petitioners and as\n\nsuch it is not understood what relief the writ petitioners are\n\nclaiming without reference to their individual facts in each of the\n\ncases.\n\nIn support of his contentions, the learned Senior Counsel\n\nrefers to the\nJudgment of Ajit Singh Januja & Ors Vs. State of\n\nPunjab and Ors\n, reported in (1996) 2 SCC 715;\nS. Panneer Selvam\n\nVs. State of T.N.\n, reported in (2015) 10 SCC 292 and Mukesh\n\nKumar and Anr. Vs. State of Uttarakhan and Ors, reported in\n\n(2020) 3 SCC 1.\n\n20. The rival submissions have been heard and carefully\n\nconsidered. The pleadings available on record have also been\n\ncarefully perused. The Judgments cited in the Bar have also been\n\nnoted.\n\n21. To address the issues raised in the present writ petitions, it\n\nwill be necessary to refer to a few provisions of the Assam\n\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of posts in\n\nservices) Act, 1978.\nThis Act\nwas published in the Assam Gazatte\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 56 of 103\n\n(Extraordinary) on 28.05.1979. It is this Act has been brought by\n\nthe State of Assam to provide for reservation of vacancies in\n\nservices and posts for the members of the Scheduled Castes and\n\nScheduled Tribes. The statement and object of reasons is quoted\n\nas under:\n\n\"In order to provide for reservation of vacancies in services and posts\nfor the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who\nare the Backward Classes of citizen and are not adequately\nrepresented in the services and posts in the affairs of the State\nwithin the State, it was considered expedient to provide adequate\nreservation of vacancies in services and posts for them.\"\n\n22. Under\nSection 5\nof the Act of 1978, it is provided that\n\nreservation for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n\nTribes in posts to be filled up by promotion in any establishment\n\nshall be regulated in the manner provided thereafter.\n\nClause 5A provides the percentage of reservation for each\n\ncategory namely, 7% for members of Scheduled Caste, 10% for\n\nmembers of Scheduled Tribes (Plains) and 5% for members of\n\nScheduled Tribes(Hills) and further provided that the State\n\nGovernment may from time to time review the implementation of\n\nthe reservation policy and take adequate measures including the\n\nincreased of percentage mentioned in the clause.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 57 of 103\n\nSection 5B provides for separate post based roster for\n\nrecruitment and promotion for each cadre to be maintained by\n\nevery establishment for reservations of candidates of Scheduled\n\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes as contained therein.\n\n23. Clause 5A was subsequently inserted by an amendment.\n\nClause 5-A is extracted as under:\n\n\"5A Manner and procedure for giving effect of reservation-\nThe reservation for the members of the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes in services or posts in an establishment shall be\ngiven effect to in the following manner, namely:\n\n(i) A post based Roster Register shall be maintained to give effect to\nthe reservation of vacancies for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes. Such roster shall be based on the Model roster as per Schedule\nI and II appended to this Act and shall be adopted for the purpose by\neach Establishment in such manner that the prescribed percentage of\nreservation is maintained in each cadre;\n\n(ii) Each Appointing authority shall prepare and notify the roster based\non the principles laid down in this Act and maintain Roster Register in\na manner containing such number of points as are equivalent to the\nnumber of posts, in a cadre. In case of any increase or decrease in the,\ncadre strength, the roster shall correspondingly by expanded or\ncontracted;\n\n(iii) The roster is to be operated on the principle of replacement and\nnot as a running account, in other words, the point at which\nreservation for different categories applies are fixed as per the roster\nand vacancies caused by retirement etc. of persons occupying those\npoints shall be filled up by appointment of persons of the respective\ncategories;\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 58 of 103\n\n(iv) Separate rosters are to be maintained for giving effect to\nreservation in direct recruitment and promotion;\n\n(v) Cadre, for the purpose of a roster, shall mean a particular grade\nand shall comprise the number of posts to be filled by a particular\nmode of recruitment in terms of the applicable recruitment rules. Thus\nin a cadre of say, 100 posts, where the recruitment rules prescribe a\nratio of 50:50 for direct recruitment and promotion, two roster- one\nfor direct recruitment and one for promotion (when reservation in\npromotion applies)each comprising 50 points shall be drawn up on the\nlines of the respective rosters;\n\n(vi) Since reservation does not apply to transfer on deputation or\ntransfer, where the recruitment rules prescribe a percentage of posts\nto be filled by this method, such posts shall be excluded while\npreparing the rosters;\n\n(vii) Appointment of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes which were made on merit and not due to\nreservation, are not to be counted towards reservations so far as\ndirect recruitment is concerned. In other words, they are to be treated\nas general category appointments;\n\n(viii) For initial adoption of this post based roster, the existing backlog\nvacancies in a cadre where the prescribed percentage of reservation\nfor the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes has not been\nachieved as per post based roster prepared under this Amendment Act,\nshall be considered as vacancies released by recruitment, resignation,\npromotion etc. of the persons belonging to the said reserved\ncategories and the same are to be filled up by direct recruitment or by\npromotion of eligible persons from the respective categories by special\ndrive so that the prescribed percentage of reservation is maintained.\n\n(ix) Before making an appointment by direct recruitment, the\nAppointing authority shall ascertain by consulting the Roster Register\nmaintained by each Establishment, whether the post is reserved or\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 59 of 103\n\nunreserved and if it is reserved, for whom it is so reserved.\n\nImmediately after an appointment is made, the particulars thereof\nshall be entered in the Roster Register and signed by the Appointing\nauthority;\n\n(x) In the absence of a qualified Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes\ncandidate, as the case may be, in a particular year, the vacancy shall\nbe carried forward and filled up in the next year;\n\n(xi) Every Establishment shall prepare and notify the roster for each\ncadre equivalent to the number of posts with the concurrence of the\nPersonnel Department and Welfare of Plains Tribes and Backward\nClasses Department;\n\n(xii) The roster shall be maintained separately for permanent and\ntemporary posts;\n\n(xiii) A vacancy caused due to any reason whatsoever, except\ntermination of service during probation, shall be treated as a fresh\nvacancy;\n\n(xiv) A candidate who claims to be a member of the Scheduled Castes\nor the Scheduled Tribes shall support his candidature by a Certificate\nfrom Deputy Commissioner/ Sub-Divisional Officer or from such other\nauthority as may be prescribed by rules made under the Act.\"\n\n24. Under\nSection 13\nof the said Act, the Government is\n\nempowered to frame the Rules for implementing the provisions of\n\nthe Act and inconsequence thereof, the Assam Scheduled Castes\n\nand Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of vacancies in services and\n\nposts) Rules, 1983 was framed.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 60 of 103\n\n25. A perusal of the Act and the Rules above revealed that\n\nunder\nSection 5A\nof the Act of 1978, the following conditions inter\n\nalia are noticed:\n\n(i) A post based roster is to be maintained. The roster is to be\n\noperated on the principle or replacement and not as a running\n\naccount;\n\n(ii) The cadre shall mean a particular grade and shall comprise the\n\nnumber of posts to be filled up by particular mode of recruitment;\n\nand\n\n(iii) The appointment made on merit of reserved candidates shall\n\nnot be counted towards the reserved category posts.\n\n26. The parliament by the 77th Amendment had inserted Clause\n\n4A under\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution of India. Clause 4A\n\nempowers the State to make any provision for reservation.\n\nSubsequently by the 85th Amendment, further amendment was\n\nbrought in to Clause 4A of the Constitution of India to the effect\n\nthat nothing in the Article shall prevent the State from making any\n\nprovisions for reservation in matters of promotion with\n\nconsequential seniority to any class or classes of posts in the\n\nservices under the State in favour of Schedules Casts and\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 61 of 103\n\nScheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the State are not\n\nadequately represented in the services of the State. Pursuant to\n\nthe 77th and 85th Amendment, the State of Assam had brought in\n\nthe Office Memorandum No. ABP.59/96/163 dated 12.03.2002. By\n\nthe said Office Memorandum, consequential seniority was made\n\navailable to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes Government\n\nServants upon their promotions by virtue of the Rule of\n\nreservation/roster. This benefit was made available to the\n\nreserved category Government servant w.e.f 17.06.1995. As such\n\nby the Act of 1978 by virtue of\nSection 5\nreservation in promotion\n\nto the reserved category candidates was already in place well\n\nprior to the Constitutional Amendment to\nArticle 16.\nBy the Office\n\nMemorandum dated 13.03.2002, the consequential seniority upon\n\npromotion to the reserved category candidates was also\n\nintroduced. Subsequently, Section 5A was introduced pursuant to\n\nan Amendment. The 2012 Office Memorandum was subsequently\n\nfollowed by another Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014.\nThe\n\nsaid Office Memorandum provided for the guidelines to implement\n\nthe post based roster reservation system. In the said Office\n\nMemorandum of 29.12.2014 at Clause 1.11, it is provided that the\n\nrosters are an aid to determine the entitlement of different\n\ncategories with regard to the quota reserved for them in matters\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 62 of 103\n\nof appointment and promotion. They are not intended to\n\ndetermine seniority in the cadre. Pursuant to the Judgment of the\n\nApex Court rendered in\nM Nagaraj & Ors. Vs. Union of India\n,\n\nreported in (2006) 8 SCC 212and the U.P. Corporation Limited\n\n(Supra) that there is a requirement of the State to have a\n\nquantifiable data on the backwardness and inadequacy of the\n\nrepresentation of the reserved category candidates before\n\neffecting the promotion to the reserved category candidates. In\n\npursuance to the said Judgment by the Apex Court, State of\n\nAssam constituted a One-Man-Committee. The One-Man-\n\nCommittee submitted its report to the effect that there is\n\ninadequacy of representation in the reserved category and\n\nbackwardness of the classes and therefore the One-Man-\n\nCommittee report suggested that reservation in promotion should\n\nbe continue. This report came to be assailed in writ petitions filed\n\nbefore the Gauhati High Court being W.P(C) No. 1560/2015 and\n\nW.P.(C) No. 2680/2015 which was filed by the society named\n\nEquality Forum and other individuals. A Co-ordinate Bench of this\n\nCourt by its Judgment and Order dated 23.12.2015 rejected the\n\ncontentions of the State Government to proceed for reservation in\n\npromotion on the basis of the recommendation of the One-Man-\n\nCommittee report. It was held by the Co-ordinate Bench that the\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 63 of 103\n\nmandate in\nM Nagarajan\n(Supra) and U.P. Power Corporation\n\n(Supra)to have quantifiable data is not satisfied by the One-Man-\n\nCommittee report in the manner it sought to project the same. It\n\nwas held that there has to be an exercise of collection of\n\nquantifiable data relating to the three Constitutional requirements,\n\nnamely (i) backwardness of the class; (ii) inadequacy of\n\nrepresentation in public service and (iii) overall efficiency in\n\nadministration in the event of reservation, are the quantifiable\n\ndata which are to be collected by the State before proceeding for\n\nreservation in promotion. The Co-ordinate Bench held that till\n\nsuch quantifiable data is collected. The Amendment of the Act of\n\n1978 brought in by the 2012 Office Memorandum in so far as the\n\nreservation in promotion are concerned shall remain in a domain\n\nstate.\n\n27. Thereafter, the Government by Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.08.2016 vide No. TAD/BC/68/2011/Pt-I/207 brought in the\n\nsaid Office Memorandum for review of the Government Policy of\n\nreservation in promotion with reference to the Judgment of the\n\nGauhati High Court in Equality Forum in W.P(C) No. 5610/2015.\n\nThe said Office Memorandum brought in the various guidelines to\n\nbe followed while considering promotion in any cadre in any\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 64 of 103\n\nestablishment. It was provided that the policy of reservation in\n\npromotion will continue. Under Clause (ii) of the said Office\n\nMemorandum, it was laid down that while taking up the process\n\nof promotion in a particular cadre of the service, every\n\nestablishment shall examine the representation of SC, ST(P) and\n\nST(H) candidates in a cadre in comparison with the prescribed\n\npercentage of reservation and calculate shortfall if any in any\n\ncadre with reference to a particular year. If in any particular cadre,\n\nthe SCs and STs are not adequately represented and shortfall is\n\nfound to exist in the cadre, they may be considered as backward\n\nin so far as that particular cadre is concerned.

Since the Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 is also\nrelevant for the purposes of this case, the same is extracted\nbelow:\n\n\"GOVERNMENTOFASSAM\nDEPARTMENT OF WELFARE OF PLAINS TRIBES AND BACKWARD CLASSES\nDISPUR ::::ASSAM\nNo. TAD/BC/68/2011/Pt-I/207 dated Dispur 3rd August, 2016\nOFFICE MEMORANDUM\n\nSubject: Review of Government Policy of Reservation in Promotion\nwith reference to the Hon'ble Gauhati High Court judgments\n\nWith a view to bringing the policy of reservation in promotion for\nreserved categories in line with the directions of the Hon'ble High Court,\nGovernment have reviewed the existing procedure of effecting reservation\nin promotion and accordingly lays down the following guidelines to be\nfollowed while considering promotion in any cadre in any establishment\n\ni) The policy of reservation in promotion shall continue.\n\nii) ii)Each establishment while taking up the process of\npromotion in a particular cadre of a service, shall examine the\nrepresentation of SC,ST (P) and ST(H) candidates in the cadre in\ncomparison with the prescribed percentage of reservation and calculate\nshortfall if any, in the cadre with reference to that particular year. Shortfall\nof reservation of a particular reserved category in a cadre means the\ndifference between the total number of reserved posts for that category\nin the cadre and the number of persons of that category holding the posts\nin the cadre. While calculating the shortfall, all candidates belonging to\nthe same category [SC or ST(P) or ST (H)] shall be taken into account\nirrespective of the mode of their entry into the cadre i.e. whether on\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 66 of 103\n\naccount of seniority- cum-merit or merit cum seniority, as the case may\nbe, or through any other process admissible in law or by way of\nreservation. If in a particular cadre, SCs and STs are not adequately\nrepresented and shortfall is found to exist in the cadre, they may be\nconsidered as backward insofar as that particular cadre is concerned.\n\nSuch shortfall shall be filled up by the concerned category of incumbents\nwithin the zone of consideration either on account of seniority-cum-merit/\nmerit-cum-seniority or by way of providing reservation as the case may\nbe, till the prescribed percentage in respect of the said category is\nachieved.\n\niii) If no eligible incumbent belonging to the shortfall category\nis available within the zone of consideration, this will further substantiate\nthe status of backwardness and inadequate representation of category in\nthe cadre and therefore the number of posts that are required to meet the\ncalculated shortfall shall be kept vacant and the vacancy shall be carried\nforward and filled up in the next year. In case, sufficient number of SC or\nST(P) or ST(H) candidates fit for promotion against reserved posts are not\navailable and if the posts cannot be allowed to remain vacant on grounds\nof maintaining efficiency in administration, the appointing authority may\nwith full justification, refer the vacancy to the Department of WPT and BC\nfor de-reservation, subject to the condition that no candidate belonging to\nthe category for which the post is reserved is available within the zone of\nconsideration placed before the annual Selection Committee/\nDepartmental Promotion Committee for two consecutive years.

This\n\nOffice Memorandum was also challenged by the registered society\n\nEquality Forum by filing W.P.(C) No. 5026/2016 on the ground\n\nthat this Office Memorandum is in violation of the Judgment\n\nrendered earlier by the Co-ordinate Bench in Judgment dated\n\n23.12.2015 rendered earlier by the Co-ordinate Bench in W.P(C)\n\nNo. 1560/2015 and W.P(C) No. 2680/2015. These writ petitions\n\ncame to be heard and disposed of together by Co-ordinate Bench\n\nand by Judgment and order dated 06.06.2022, the Co-ordinate\n\nBench finally held as under:\n\n\"I.

The Co-ordinate Bench went on to hold the policy of\n\nproviding reservation in promotion with consequential seniority\n\nholding the field as per Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002,\n\nthe State is not within in competence and jurisdiction to deprive\n\nthe benefit to a meritorious reserved category candidate and that\n\ntoo without expressly bringing such policy by superseding the\n\nbenefit granted under Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2009. The\n\nCo-ordinate Bench held that the policy of providing reservation in\n\npromotion with consequential seniority is holding the field. The\n\nCo-ordinate Bench also held that\nArticle 16 (4A)\nand\nArticle 16(4B)\n\nbeing enabling provisions, the State is at liberty to implement its\n\npolicy for giving reservation in promotion with consequential\n\nseniority or is at liberty not to provide for any reservation in\n\npromotion.

This Judgment came to be assailed before the Division\n\nBench of this Court in W.A No. 46/2023 and other connected writ\n\nappeals. A Division Bench of this Court elaborately dealt with the\n\nissues raised and overturned the Judgment of the learned Single\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 69 of 103\n\nJudge. The Division Bench upheld the Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.08.2016 and also held that in view of the Judgment of the\n\nApex Court in\nJarnail Singh Vs. Laxmi Narayan Gupta\n, reported in\n\n(2018) 10 SCC 396 (hereinafter referred to as \"Jarnail Singh-I\")\n\nthat the Judgment of the learned Single Bench rendered in\n\nEquality Forum\n(supra) is no longer a good law and therefore the\n\nfindings of the Single Bench rendered in\nEquality Forum\n(Supra)\n\nwould no longer be binding on the State.\n\n33. It is pertinent to mention here that the impugned Office\n\nMemorandum dated 18.01.2023 which is presently assailed in\n\nthese bunch of writ petitions came to be issued by the State of\n\nAssam after the Judgment of the learned Single Bench rendered\n\nin\nBhagawan Pator\n(Supra) but during the pendency of the writ\n\nappeal No. 46/2023 and other connected writ appeals and prior to\n\nthe Judgment dated 10.08.2023 rendered by the Division Bench in\n\nthese writ appeal. The impugned Office Memorandum being\n\nassailed in the present Office Memorandum is extracted below:\n\n\"GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM\nDEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL:::: PERSONNEL (B)\nDISPUR::::GUWAHATI-06\n\nNo. ABP.81/2022/58 Dated Dispur, the 18th January, 2023\n\nOFFICE MEMORANDUM\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 70 of 103\n\nSUBJECT: Review of Government Policy of Reservation in Promotion\nwith reference to the Hon'ble Gauhati High Court judgments.\n\nThe Hon'ble Gauhati High Court in its judgment and order dated\n06.06.2022 in W.P.(C) No. 5005/2016 (Bhagwan Pator-Vs. SOA & Ors) and\nWP(C) No. 5026/2016 (Equality Forum-Vs-SOA & Ors) at Para 7 (IX) of this\norder, has observed that,\n\n\"Para 7(IX):\nArticle 16 (4A)\nand\n16(4B)\nbeing enabling provision, the State is\nat liberty to implement its policy of giving reservation in promotion with\nconsequential seniority, without consequential seniority or at liberty not to\nprovide any reservation in promotion. However, while implementing such\npolicy, due process of law need to be followed including dicta in\nM Nagraj\n\n(Supra) clarified in\nJarnail Singh\n(Supra).\"\n\nThe Government of Assam after careful examination of the Hon'ble High\nCourt judgment dated 23.12.2015 in W.P.(C) No. 1560 (Equality Forum-Vs-\nSOA & 3 Ors.) and the judgment dated 06-06-2022 in WP(C) No. 5005/2016\nand WP(C) No. 5026/2016, has reviewed the existing procedure of effecting\n'reservations in promotion with consequential seniority for the reserved\ncategories and accordingly lays down the following guidelines to be followed\nwhile considering promotion in any establishment.\n\ni) The policy of reservation in promotion shall continue,\n\nii) Each Establishment while taking up the process of promotion in a\nparticular cadre of a service, shall examine the representation of SC, ST(P)\nand ST(H) candidates in the cadre in comparison with the prescribed\npercentage of reservation and calculate shortfall if any, in the cadre with\nreference to that particular year. Shortfall of reservation of a particular\nreserved category in cadre means the difference between the total number\nof reserved posts for that category in the cadre and the number of persons\nof that category holding the posts in the cadre. While calculating the shortfall,\nall candidates belonging to the same category [SC or ST(P) or ST(H)] shall\nbe taken into account irrespective of the mode of entry into the cadre i.e.\nwhether on account of seniority-cum-merit or merit cum seniority, as the\ncase may be, or through any other process admissible in law or by way of\nreservation. If in a particular cadre, SCs and STs are not adequately\nrepresented and shortfall is found to exist in the cadre, it may be considered\nas inadequacy in representation insofar as that particular cadre is concerned.\nSuch shortfall shall be filled up by the concerned category of incumbents\nwithin the zone of consideration either on account of seniority-cum-merit/\nmerit-cum-seniority or by way of providing reservation as the case may be,\ntill the prescribed percentage in respect of the said category is achieved.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 71 of 103\n\niii) If no eligible incumbent belonging to the shortfall category is available\nwithin the zone of consideration, this will further substantiate the status of\nbackwardness and inadequate representation of the category in the cadre\nand therefore the number of posts that are required to meet the calculated\nshortfall shall be kept vacant and the vacancy shall be carried forward and\nfilled up in the next year. In case, sufficient number of SC or ST(P) or ST(H)\ncandidates, fit for promotion against reserved posts, are not available and if\nthe posts cannot be allowed to remain vacant on grounds of maintaining\nefficiency in administration, the Appointing Authority may with full\njustification, refer the vacancy to the Department of Personnel for de-\nreservation, subject to the condition that no eligible candidate belonging to\nthe category for which the post is reserved, is available within the zone of\nconsideration placed before the annual Selection Committees Departmental\nPromotion Committee for two consecutive years. In other words, the\nconcerned Departments may move proposal for de-reservation in the third\nyear.\n\niv) (a) In case of promotion in Group-A services, the quantum of\nreservation for SC, ST(P), STCD in promotion shall be as per stipulated\npercentage of reservation available for these categories. However, SC or\nST(P) or ST(H) Government Servants in Group-A services on their\naccelerated promotion by virtue of rule of reservation, shall not be entitled to\nconsequential seniority. The application of general catch-up rule will allow\neligible officers who were senior in the merit list at the entry level in Group A\nservices to regain their seniority in the promotional post, once they are\npromoted to the same cadre as an officer of reserved category, provided the\nofficer of the reserved category had got his promotion ahead of an officer\nsenior to him in the merit list, by way of accelerated promotion on account of\nreservation in promotion in a particular cadre. Seniority of Government\nservants in Group-A services shall be revised accordingly as per above\nprinciple.\n\nFurther, an officer promoted from Group-B to Group-A service, will\nalso regain his seniority in Group-A service on promotion vis-a-vis his\ncompatriot in Group-B service, provided that the officer was senior to the\nreserved category officer in the particular Group B cadre, prior to the\npromotion of the reserved category officer into Group A. Seniority of such\nGroup B Government servant promoted to Group A service shall be revised\naccordingly in Group A.\n\nIf an occasion arises during the promotion process in Group A service,\nin which stipulated percentage in respect of reserved category is met in the\nnext promotional grade, but in the zone of consideration there are\ncandidates of reserved category who on merit are entitled to the promotions,\ntheir cases shall be considered for promotion on merit, if such candidates\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 72 of 103\n\nhave not made into zone of consideration by way of any accelerated\npromotion earlier by virtue of rule of reservation.\n\n(b) In case of promotion in Group B, C and D services, the quantum of\nreservation for SC, ST(P), ST(H) in promotion shall be as per stipulated\npercentage of reservation of these categories. The SC or ST(P) or ST(H)\nGovernment servants on their promotion by virtue of rule of reservation shall\nbe entitled to consequential seniority. In other words candidates belonging to\nGeneral/OBC/MOBC categories promoted later will be placed junior to the\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes Government servant promoted earlier.\nSeniority of Government Servants in Group-B, C and D services shall be\nrevised accordingly.\n\nv) As regards the question of maintaining administrative efficiency as\nrequired under\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution of India, Hon'ble High Court in\nWP(C) No.1560/2015 (Equality Forum-Vs-SOA & 3 Ors.) held that \"......it\nshould be assessed applying objective measurable standards\". As such, the\nAnnual Confidential Reports (ACR)/ Annual Performance Appraisal Reports\n(APAR) of the incumbent along with the length of service, participation in\ntraining programs concerning job requirements, acquisition of degrees or\ndiplomas on subjects if mandatory to the job, may be considered as the\nyardstick of measuring efficiency.\n\nvi) It shall be the responsibility of the concerned appointing authority to\nprovide adequate information concerning the above to the Selection\nCommittee (Departmental Promotion Committee) which shall evaluate all\nrelevant parameters while making its recommendation.\n\nThis Office Memorandum is issued in supersession of earlier O.M. No.\nABP.59/96/163, dated 12/03/2002 and OM No. TAD/BC/68/2011/Pt-\nI/207,dated 03/08/2016.\n\nThis shall come into force with immediate effect.\n\nSd/- Tonmoy Pratim Borgohain, IAS\nSecretary to the Government of Assam\nPersonnel Department\"\n\n34. The Clauses No. (iii), (iv)(a) and (v) of this Office\n\nMemorandum are challenged in these writ petitions. The essence\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 73 of 103\n\nof this Office Memorandum is that the State of Assam has decided\n\nto continue the policy of reservation and promotion but has done\n\naway with the consequential seniority of the reserved category\n\ncandidates and has instead brought in the \"catch-up Rule\"\n\nenabling the General category candidates who were senior in the\n\nfeeder posts to regain their seniority in the higher post after\n\npromotion provided the reserved category candidate who was\n\npromoted earlier did not earn a further promotion and the General\n\ncategory candidate was senior to the said reserved category\n\ncandidate in the feeder category.\n\n35. It is no longer res integra that\nArticle 16 (4A)\nand\nArticle 16\n\n(4B)\nhad been held to be enabling provisions by the Apex Court in\n\nM. Nagaraj\n(Supra) and the subsequent Judgments. If these\n\nprovisions are enabling provisions then the State is at liberty to\n\nprovide for reservation in promotion with or without consequential\n\nseniority as the case may be, if such a decision is arrived at by\n\nthe State.\n\nBoth the Co-ordinate Bench in\nBhagawan Pator\n(Supra)\n\nas well as a Division Bench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra) had\n\ncategorically held that the State is at liberty to grant seniority in\n\npromotion to the reserved category or not to grant such seniority\n\nin promotion to the reserved category.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 74 of 103\n\n36. A careful perusal of the Act read with the Rules will reveal\n\nthat even prior to the 77th and 85th Constitutional Amendments,\n\nthe State by way of the Act of 1978 read with the Rules of 1983\n\nhad made provisions for reservation in promotion of in respect of\n\nreserved categories.\nThis Act\nand the Rules are not department\n\nspecific and are applicable to all the Departments/establishments\n\nin respect of such promotions to be made to the Government\n\nServants who satisfy the criteria.\nThe Act\nread with the Rules\n\nnowhere specifically provides for grant of consequential seniority\n\nupon promotion of the reserved category candidates. It is in the\n\nabsence of such provisions that the State had brought out the\n\nNotifications and Office Memorandums from time to time. By\n\nOffice Memorandum dated 12.06.1996 pursuant to the Judgment\n\nof the Apex Court rendered in\nUnion of India & Ors. Vs. Virpal\n\nSingh Chauhan & Ors\n, reported in (1995) 6 SCC 684, it was\n\nprovided that the candidates promoted earlier by virtue of Rule or\n\nreservation/roster shall not be entitled to seniority over his senior\n\nin the feeder category and that as an when the General category\n\ncandidate who was senior to the reserved category candidate in\n\nthe feeder category is promoted, such General category candidate\n\nwith regain his seniority over his reserved category.\n\nNotwithstanding that he was promoted subsequent to the\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 75 of 103\n\nreserved category candidate. This Office Memorandum was\n\nfollowed by the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 by which\n\npursuant to the Amendment of\nArticle 16 (4A)\nof the Constitution\n\nof India. The State of Assam conferred consequential seniority to\n\nthe reserved category Government servants on their promotion by\n\nvirtue of the Rule of reservation/roster. The earlier Office\n\nMemorandum dated 12.06.1996 was accordingly revised and\n\nsuperseded. This Office Memorandum was followed by the\n\nsubsequent Office Memorandum on 03.08.2016.\n\n37. A careful perusal of the Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.08.2016 reveals that this Office Memorandum was not issued\n\nin supersession of the earlier Office Memorandum dated\n\n12.03.2002. It was in this context that the Office Memorandum\n\ndated 03.08.2016 was put to challenge and the Co-ordinate Bench\n\nin\nBhagawan Pator\n(Supra) had essentially held the Clauses put to\n\nchallenge in the Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 to be not\n\nvalid in view of the fact that the position in terms of the Office\n\nMemorandum dated 12.03.2002 remained unchanged.\n\n38. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nthat the policy of consequential seniority has always been in place\n\nand followed by the Government of Assam and the same could\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 76 of 103\n\nnot have been recalled or turned down as had been sought to be\n\ndone by the impugned Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023,\n\nwill require examination in the above conspectus of facts.\n\n39. As above discussed, although well prior to the Constitutional\n\nAmendments brought in to\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution, the\n\nState of Assam by the Act of 1978 read with the Rules of 1983\n\nhad implemented the policy of reservation on promotion. There is\n\nno quarrel with this position on facts. The point of discord is\n\nwhether the Act itself contemplates consequential seniority in\n\nrespect of the reserved category candidates who have been\n\npromoted under the reservation policy and therefore the principle\n\nof consequential seniority having been conferred under the Notice\n\ndated 12.03.2002 and the source of power for which can be\n\ntraced back to the Act of 1978, whether denial of such principle in\n\nterms of the impugned notification will amount to the vested\n\nrights of the writ petitioners being taken away.\n\n40.\nThe Act\nof 1978 read with the Rules have been brought in\n\nby the State with the object of providing reservation in\n\npromotions. The statement of objects and reasons clearly provide\n\nthat the Act proposes to provide for reservation of vacancies in\n\nservices and posts for the members of Scheduled Castes and\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 77 of 103\n\nScheduled Tribes who are backward classes and are not\n\nadequately represented in the services and posts in the affairs\n\nwithin the State. A careful perusal of the Act including the\n\nAmendment brought thereto reveals that the Act provides for\n\nmaintaining a post based roster. Cadre is defined, for the\n\npurposes of roster, to mean a particular grade and shall comprise\n\nthe number of posts to be filled up by particular modes of\n\nrecruitment in terms of the applicable recruitment Rules. The\n\nroster to be maintained shall be separate for direct recruitment as\n\nwell as for promotions. The Rules of 1983 have been framed\n\nunder the powers conferred under\nSection 13\nof the Act of 1978.\n\nUnder Rule 5 of the said Rules, the procedure to be followed is\n\nprescribed in respect of promotions by selection. Under Rule 5(2),\n\nthe Selection Committee will consider the suitability of all\n\ncandidates, the details of whom are furnished by the appointing\n\nauthority and thereafter recommend a list of candidates found\n\nsuitable for promotion in order of preference which shall be the\n\ndetermining factor about the inter se seniority of the candidates\n\nafter promotion. Rule 5(3) provides that in addition to the list as\n\nrequired to be submitted under Rule 5(2), Selection Committee\n\nshall furnish separate list of candidates belonging to Scheduled\n\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes (Hills), Scheduled Tribes (Plains) and\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 78 of 103\n\nothers in order of preference for appointment against the\n\nvacancies shown to be reserved for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled\n\nTribes(Hills), Scheduled Tribes(Plains) against the unreserved\n\nvacancy. Under Rule 5(4), the appointing authority shall consider\n\nthe list in accordance with the provisions of the respective service\n\nRules and shall consult the APSC where such consultation is\n\nnecessary. Under Rule 6, the appointing authority is required to\n\nmaintain a register as per the proforma appended to the Rules\n\nseparately for direct recruitment and for promotion. This register\n\nshall be maintained in respect of every year beginning on the 1st\n\nof March and ending on the last day of February in the next year.\n\nFurther Rule 4 of the Rules provides for submission of annual\n\nreport showing the position regarding appointment of candidates\n\nbelonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes by direct\n\nrecruitment and by promotion shall be submitted by each\n\nadministrative department to the department for the Welfare of\n\nPlains Tribes and Backward Classes. The relevant provisions of\n\nthe Rules are extracted below for ready reference:\n\n\"5. Promotion by selection- While filling up vacancies by promotion\nthe following procedure shall be followed-\n\n1) The Appointing Authority while making a request to the selection\nCommittee/Board for recommending candidates for promotion, shall\ncommunicate to the Selection Committee / Board the details about the\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 79 of 103\n\nreservation for the Scheduled Castes and scheduled Tribes (Hills) and\nScheduled Tribes (Plains) and shall also furnish the details about such\nnumber of candidates as are to be furnished in accordance with the\nprovisions of the respective service rules. In case however, where\nthere is no service rules for the service in which the promotion is to be\nmade, the Appointing Authority will furnish the details about the\ncandidates equal to four times the number of vacancies.\n\n(2) The Selection Committee/ Board will consider the suitability of all\nthe candidates the details of whom are furnished by the appointing\nauthority and recommend a list of candidates found suitable for\npromotion in order of preference, which shall be the determining\nfactor about the inter se seniority of the candidates after promotion.\n\n(3) In addition to the list mentioned in sub-rule (2) above, the\nSelection Committee shall furnish separate list of candidates belonging\nto Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes (Hills), Scheduled Tribes\n(Plains) and others, in order of preference for appointing against the\nvacancies shown as reserved for Schedules Castes and Scheduled\nTribes (Hills) and Scheduled Tribes (Plains) and against the\nunreserved vacancies.\n\n(4) The Appointing Authority shall consider the list in accordance with\nthe provisions of the respective service rules and shall also consult the\nAssam Public Service Commission where such consultation is\nnecessary, and shall finally approve the list.\n\n(5) The Appointing Authority shall thereafter make promotions in\naccordance with the roster provided in Clause (1) of the Scheduled to\nthe Act in Order of preference indicated in the lists.\n\n(6) In case of non availability of adequate number of candidates\nbelonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Hills) and\nScheduled Tribes (Plains) in the list mentioned in sub-rules (2) and (3)\nof this rule and if it is considered that the vacancies reserved for these\ncategories of candidates cannot be left vacant in the interest of Public\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 80 of 103\n\nService, the Appointing Authority with prior concurrence of the\nDepartment for the Welfare of Plains Tribes and Backward Classes\nshall issue orders deresrving the vacancies giving one explanation for\nthe dereservation, and shall thereafter fill up the dereserved vacancies\nby promoting officers from the list furnished by the Selection\nCommittee/Board and approved by the Assam Public Service\nCommission/Appointing Authority in order of preference.

Submission of Annual Report- An annual report showing the\nposition regarding appointment of candidates belonging to Scheduled\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes by direct recruitment and by promotion shall\nbe submitted by each Administrative Department to Department for\nthe Welfare of Plains Tribes and Backward Classes in the manner\nprescribed below-\n\n(1) The annual report shall be for the period from the first day of\nMarch to the last day February next.\n\n(2) As soon after the first day March every year as possible, every\nAppointing Authority shall sent to the respective administrative\nDepartment-\n\n(i) a Statement in the form given in Appendix-III showing the total\nnumber of employees in each class of service indicating the number of\nemployees belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes;\nand\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 81 of 103\n\n(ii) a Statement each in the proforma given in Appendix-IV A and\nAppendix-IV B, showing the particulars of appointments made during\nthe year and the number of appointees belonging to Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes.\n\n(3) The Administrative Department shall consolidate all the reports\nsubmitted by different Appointing Authority under its administrative\ncontrol and submit the report as provided in the substantive clause of\nthis rule.\"\n\n41. A careful perusal of the Act of 1978 read with the Rules will\n\nreveal that no such mandate under the Act or the Rules is\n\ndiscernable. This is qualified by the fact that the Government of\n\nAssam had from time to time issues various Office Memorandums\n\neither conferring consequential seniority or withdrawing the\n\nbenefit of consequential seniority. If the provisions of the Act of\n\n1978 and the Rules of 1983 are to be read together then it is\n\nclear that there is no policy available under the Act of 1978 read\n\nwith the Rules of 1983 which confers automatic consequential\n\nseniority on the reserved category candidates who have been\n\ngranted accelerated promotion on the reservation policy. In the\n\nabsence of any specific provisions thereto, it cannot be assumed\n\nthat accelerated promotions made under the reservation policy\n\nwill necessarily be also conferred with the benefits of\n\nconsequential seniority. On the contrary, in the absence of any\n\nsuch specific provisions or criteria specified under the Act of 1978\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 82 of 103\n\nread with the Rules of 1983, it can only mean that the benefits of\n\naccelerated promotion would not grant consequential seniority.\n\nThis benefit of consequential seniority has been conferred by the\n\nState by bringing in Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002.\n\n42. The petitioners are members of the Water Resources\n\nDepartment and the PWD Department. Promotions in both these\n\nDepartments are governed by their own service Rules. In the said\n\nservice Rules, there is a provision which lays down the procedure\n\nfor promotion. As per the said procedure laid down, the\n\nappointing authority is to determine the list of eligible candidates\n\nas per the assessments made in terms of the Rules. Ordinarily the\n\nOfficers who are included in the zone of consideration are four (4)\n\ntime the number of the vacancies in the order of seniority. This is\n\na standard practice applicable in all most departments including\n\nall the works department of the State. As such, the process for\n\npromotion is governed by the service Rules and not by the Act of\n\n1978 read with the Rules of 1983. Therefore, the procedure laid\n\ndown for promotion is provided in detail under the respective\n\nService Rules governing the service conditions of the employees\n\nof the various departments. That apart, the Service Rules also\n\nprovides that the seniority of a member of a cadre shall be in the\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 83 of 103\n\norder of merit as determined by the selection committee. Under\n\nsuch circumstances, the claim of the petitioners that their rights\n\nare infringed by virtue of consequential seniority not being\n\nconferred upon promotion also cannot be accepted.\n\n43. As such, it is reiterated that the Act of 1978 read with the\n\nRules of 1983 does not provide for any provision or criteria for\n\nautomatic or consequential seniority upon such promotion of\n\nreserved category candidates under the reservation policy.\nThe\n\nAct\nof 1978 read with the Rules of 1983 merely brings in a law to\n\ngrant reservation in promotion in respect of reserved category\n\ncandidates. Any additional benefits of consequential seniority is\n\nnot provided for under the Act of 1978 read with the Rules of\n\n1983. Such benefits have been brought or provided by the State\n\nby issuance of such Notifications or Office Memorandums from\n\ntime to time.\n\n44. A perusal of the Office Memorandum dated 12.06.1996\n\nreveals that the benefit of consequential seniority on promotion\n\nfor reserved category candidates had been taken away pursuant\n\nto the Judgment of the Apex Court rendered in\nVirpal Singh\n\nChauhan\n(Supra). The position which existed in the State prior to\n\nthe Office Memorandum dated 12.06.1996 is not available before\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 84 of 103\n\nthis Court. Even assuming that consequential seniority on\n\npromotion of the reserved category candidates was granted by\n\nthe State or was in place prior to 12.06.1996, then such benefit\n\nwas either granted by any such Notification that may have been\n\nbrought in by the State or upon such interpretation as may have\n\nbeen made by the State of the law as it existed then. However,\n\nnothing has been pointed out to the Court that such a provision\n\nexisted in the Act as well as the Rules prior to 12.06.1996.\n\n45. Under such circumstances, the contention of the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner that in the absence of anything to the\n\ncontrary, reservation and promotion to the reserved category\n\ncandidates would also automatically grant them the benefit of\n\nconsequential seniority cannot be accepted and the same is\n\ntherefore rejected.\n\n46. The Office Memorandum dated 12.06.2002 having conferred\n\nthe benefit of consequential seniority in reservation or promotion\n\nto reserved category candidates, was conferred by the State of\n\nAssam and which continued till the Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.08.2016 was brought in which sought to amend the benefits\n\ngranted under the Office Memorandum of 12.03.2002.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 85 of 103\n\n47. This Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 although was\n\nconsidered to be bad in law by the Co-ordinate Bench in\n\nBhagawan Pator\n(Supra) in view of the fact that the earlier Office\n\nMemorandum dated 12.03.2002 was still holding the field.\n\nHowever, the Division Bench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra)\n\noverruled the views of the Co-ordinate Bench. Both the Co-\n\nordinate Bench as well as the Division Bench had categorically\n\nheld that the State Government was within its powers to grant or\n\nnot to grant the benefit of reservation in promotion along with\n\nconsequential seniority. Such view held by the Single Bench and\n\nalso by the Division Bench is the correct view as have been\nlaid\n\ndown in\nlaw by the Apex Court in\nM. Nagaraj\n(Supra) and the\n\ncatena of the Judgments thereafter.\n\nThe findings of the Division\n\nBench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra) is not under appeal and\n\ntherefore the same has attained finality as on date.\n\n48. The impugned Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023 and\n\nthe context in which the earlier Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.08.2016 was issued are largely operating in the same sphere.\n\nThe impugned Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023 have also\n\nbeen issued in supersession of the earlier Office Memorandums\n\ndated 12.03.2002 and 03.08.2016.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 86 of 103\n\n49. Clause 4(A) of the Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023\n\nprovides that Government servants in the reserved categories on\n\ntheir accelerated promotion under the Rule or reservation shall\n\nnot be entitled to consequential seniority. The application of\n\ngeneral catch-up Rule will allow the eligible officers who were\n\nsenior in the merit list at the entry level in Group-A services to\n\nregain their seniority in promotional post once they are promoted\n\nto the same cadre as the Officer of the reserved category. The\n\nsaid Clause 4A further provides similar benefits from Officers who\n\nare promoted from Group-B to Group-A category. It also provides\n\nduring the process of promotion in the Group-A services in which\n\nthe stipulated percentage of the reserved category although is\n\nmet but in the zone of consideration there are candidates of\n\nreserved category who on merit are entitled to the promotions,\n\ntheir cases will be considered for promotion on merit, if such\n\ncandidates are not in the zone of consideration by way of\n\naccelerated promotion earlier by virtue of the Rule or reservation.\n\n50. The first part of Clause 4A is the policy of catch-up Rule\n\nwhich as discussed before has been brought in by the State\n\nsuperseding the benefits of consequential seniority as was\n\nbrought in by the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002. The\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 87 of 103\n\nsuperseding of the earlier Office Memorandum of 12.03.2002 and\n\nthe implementation of the policy of catch-up Rule over the\n\nconsequential seniority by itself cannot be held to be beyond the\n\npowers of the State inasmuch as, as have been discussed above,\n\nno such policy is discernable in the Act of 1978 read with the\n\nRules of 1983. That apart, the Single Bench in\nBhagawan Pator\n\n(Supra) as well as the Division Bench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n\n(Supra) had categorically held that the State Government is within\n\nits powers to grant or not to grant consequential seniority in\n\npromotions of reserved category candidates.\n\nThis is more so in\n\nview of the law\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in\nM Nagaraj\n(Supra)\n\nwhere it was held\nArticle 16 (4A)\nand\nArticle 16 (4B)\nare enabling\n\nprovisions for the State to grant such benefits if the State so\n\ndesires.\n\n51.\nIn\nSudhakar Baburao Nangure Vs. Noreshwar Raghunathrao\n\nShende and Ors.\n, reported in (2020) 11 SCC 399, the Apex Court\n\nwas considering a challenge made by General Category\n\ncandidates to the promotion given to reserved category\n\ncandidates with consequential seniority. In the facts of the case,\n\nGovernment Resolution dated 20.10.1997 provided that Officer\n\nbelonging to reserved category was to retain seniority in\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 88 of 103\n\npromotional post. Subsequent Government Resolution dated\n\n20.03.2003 confirmed that policy and also clarified that seniority\n\nwould be governed by regular date of promotion. The appellant\n\nbefore the Apex Court, however, had failed to challenge the\n\nappointment of the respondent to the next higher post as well as\n\nthe Government Resolution dated 20.03.2003 providing for\n\nconsequential seniority. It was in these circumstances that the\n\nApex Court held that the seniority list which was challenged fixing\n\nthe seniority of the respondent reserved category candidate\n\nabove the appellant belonging to the General category candidate\n\nin the cadre of JDTP was justified. The Apex Court while\n\nconsidering the issues had considered the important Judgments\n\nand the earlier precedents in respect of the reservation in\n\npromotion with consequential seniority. The Apex Court after\n\nconsideration of all the Judgments referred to in the said case\n\nrejected the bill on the ground that the appellant had failed to\n\nchallenge the appointment of the first respondent to the next\n\nhigher post as well as a challenge to the circular dated\n\n20.03.2003 providing for consequential seniority. It was held by\n\nthe Apex Court that in the earlier round of litigation, the Apex\n\nCourt have given liberty to the parties to pursue the matter\n\nregarding the applicability of catch up Rule before the High Court\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 89 of 103\n\nin the first instance and then before the Supreme Court if the\n\nappellant was still aggrieved. However, in the facts of the case,\n\nthe Apex Court held that the challenge that has been raised\n\nbefore the Apex Court has been developed before this Court\n\nwithout any basis in the pleadings and in that context declined to\n\nentertain the appeals. However, the Apex Court while examining\n\nthe matter had referred to the relevant case laws and the earlier\n\nprecedents of the Apex Court on the aspect of reservation in\n\npromotion with consequential seniority. It is relevant to refer to\n\nthose discussions of the Apex Court in the said Judgment and for\n\nthe said purpose, the following paragraphs are extracted:\n\n\"36. A line of cases before this Court considered the effect of an\naccelerated promotion granted to a member of a Scheduled Caste or\nScheduled Tribe in terms of consequential seniority in a higher post.\nMore specifically, the vexed issue was whether a member of such a\ncaste and tribe who obtains promotion earlier than a senior\nbelonging to the general or open category in the feeder cadre would\nretain that seniority on the latter being promoted to a higher post.\n\n37.\nIn\nUnion of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan [Union of\nIndia\nv. Virpal Singh Chauhan, (1995) 6 SCC 684 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 1]\n(\"Virpal Singh Chauhan\"), a two-Judge Bench of this Court held that\nthe State could provide that a candidate who had been promoted\nearlier on the basis of reservation and on the application of the\nroster would not be entitled to seniority over a senior belonging to\nthe general category in the feeder category. A senior belonging to\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 90 of 103\n\nthe general category who is promoted to a higher post subsequently\nwould regain seniority over the reserved candidate.\n\n38. The decision in\nVirpal Singh Chauhan [Union of India v. Virpal\nSingh Chauhan\n, (1995) 6 SCC 684 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 1] led to the\n\nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\nwith effect from 17-\n6-1995. Clause (4-A), as amended, expanded the ambit of the earlier\nprovision by enabling the State to also provide for consequential\nseniority, while making the provision for reservation in matters of\npromotion. Clause (4-A) of\nArticle 16\n, in its present form, reads thus:\n\n\"16. (4-A) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from\nmaking any provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with\nconsequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the\nservices under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not\nadequately represented in the services under the State.\"\n\n39. The principle which has been enunciated in\nVirpal Singh\nChauhan [Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n, (1995) 6 SCC 684 :\n\n1996 SCC (L&S) 1] has come to be known as the \"catch-up\" rule.\n\nIn Ajit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab [Ajit Singh Januja v. State of\nPunjab, (1996) 2 SCC 715 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 540] [\"Ajit Singh (1)\"], a\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court adopted the catch-up rule\npropounded in\nVirpal Singh Chauhan [Union of India v. Virpal Singh\nChauhan\n, (1995) 6 SCC 684 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 1] . This Court held\nthat a balance has to be maintained so as to avoid reverse\ndiscrimination and a rule or circular which gives seniority to a\ncandidate belonging to the reserved category promoted on the basis\nof the roster point would violate\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution.\n\n40. A contrary view was taken by another three-Judge Bench\nin\nJagdish Lal v. State of Haryana [Jagdish Lal\nv. State of Haryana,\n(1997) 6 SCC 538 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 1550] (\"Jagdish Lal\") to the\neffect that by virtue of the principle of continuous officiation, a\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 91 of 103\n\ncandidate belonging to the reserved category who is promoted\nearlier than a general candidate due to an accelerated promotion\nwould not lose seniority in the higher cadre.\n\nThis conflict of decisions\nwas resolved by a Constitution Bench in\nAjit Singh (2) v. State of\nPunjab [Ajit Singh\n(2) v. State of Punjab, (1999) 7 SCC 209 : 1999\nSCC (L&S) 1239] [\"Ajit Singh (2)\"].\n\nThe Constitution Bench upheld\nthe principle laid down in\nVirpal Singh Chauhan [Union of\nIndia v. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n, (1995) 6 SCC 684 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 1]\nand Ajit Singh (1) [Ajit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab, (1996) 2 SCC\n715 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 540] and disapproved of the decision\nin\nJagdish Lal [Jagdish Lal v. State of Haryana\n, (1997) 6 SCC 538 :\n\n1997 SCC (L&S) 1550] . This Court held thus : [Ajit Singh (2)\ncase [\nAjit Singh (2) v. State of Punjab\n, (1999) 7 SCC 209 : 1999 SCC\n(L&S) 1239] , SCC p. 246, para 77]\n\"77. We, therefore, hold that the roster-point promotees (reserved\ncategory) cannot count their seniority in the promoted category from\nthe date of their continuous officiation in the promoted post, -- vis-à-\n\nvis the general candidates who were senior to them in the lower\ncategory and who were later promoted. On the other hand, the\nsenior general candidate at the lower level, if he reaches the\npromotional level later but before the further promotion of the\nreserved candidate -- he will have to be treated as senior, at the\npromotional level, to the reserved candidate even if the reserved\ncandidate was earlier promoted to that level. We shall explain this\nfurther under Point 3. We also hold that\nVirpal [Union of\nIndia v. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n, (1995) 6 SCC 684 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 1]\nand Ajit Singh [Ajit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab, (1996) 2 SCC\n715 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 540] have been correctly decided and\nthat\nJagdish Lal [Jagdish Lal v. State of Haryana\n, (1997) 6 SCC 538 :\n\n1997 SCC (L&S) 1550] is not correctly decided. Points 1 and 2 are\ndecided accordingly.\"\n\n41. The constitutional validity of clauses (4-A) and (4-B) of\nArticle 16\n\nof the Constitution was dealt with in a decision of a Constitution\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 92 of 103\n\nBench of this Court in\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006)\n8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] .\n\nNagaraj [M.\nNagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S)\n1013] laid down that the catch-up rule and the concept of the\nconsequential seniority are essentially precepts of service\njurisprudence. They cannot, in the view of the Constitution Bench, be\nelevated to the status of a component of the basic structure. These\nprecepts have been held to be practices as distinct from\nconstitutional principles. The consequence is that they do not lie\nbeyond the amending power of Parliament : neither the catch-up\nrule nor consequential seniority are elements of clauses (1) or (4) of\n\nArticle 16.\nThese have been held to be the principles evolved to\ncontrol the extent of reservation.\n\n42. The validity of clauses (4-A) and (4-B) of\nArticle 16\nhas been\nupheld by the Constitution Bench in\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of\nIndia\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] on the rationale\nthat \"they retain the controlling factors or the compelling reasons,\nnamely, backwardness and inadequacy of representation which\nenables the States to provide for reservation keeping in mind the\noverall efficiency of the State administration under\nArticle 335\" [\nM.\nNagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 at p. 278 : (2007) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1013] .\n\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8\nSCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] held that the State must\ndemonstrate in each case the existence of compelling reasons,\nnamely, (i) backwardness; (ii) inadequacy of representation; and (iii)\noverall administrative efficiency before providing for reservation.\n\nConstruing clauses (4-A) and (4-B) of\nArticle 16\nto be\nenabling,\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] holds that if the State wishes to exercise\nits discretion under the enabling provisions, it must collect\nquantifiable data showing backwardness of the class as well as\ninadequacy of representation of that class in public employment in\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 93 of 103\n\naddition to complying with the norm of efficiency embodied in Article\n\n335. The Court held thus : (SCC p. 278, para 123)\n\"123. However, in this case, as stated above, the main issue\nconcerns the \"extent of reservation\". In this regard the State\nconcerned will have to show in each case the existence of the\ncompelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\nrepresentation and overall administrative efficiency before making\nprovision for reservation. As stated above, the impugned provision is\nan enabling provision. The State is not bound to make reservation\nfor SCs/STs in matters of promotions. However, if they wish to\nexercise their discretion and make such provision, the State has to\ncollect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the class and\ninadequacy of representation of that class in public employment in\naddition to compliance with\nArticle 335.\nIt is made clear that even if\nthe State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will\nhave to see that its reservation provision does not lead to\nexcessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate\nthe creamy layer or extend the reservation indefinitely.\"\n\n43.\nIn the recent decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court\nin\nJarnail Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta [Jarnail Singh\nv. Lachhmi\nNarain Gupta, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC (L&S) 86] (\"Jarnail\nSingh\"), Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] has been followed save and except for the\ndictum requiring the State to demonstrate backwardness as a\ncondition for the exercise of the enabling power in making\nreservations in promotion for Scheduled Castes and Tribes. This part\nof the judgment in\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8\nSCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] has been held to be\ninconsistent with the nine-Judge Bench decision in\nIndra\nSawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India\n, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 :\n\n1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1] . The Court in\nJarnail Singh [Jarnail\nSingh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta\n, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC\n(L&S) 86] held thus : (SCC p. 423, para 23)\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 94 of 103\n\n\"23.\n\n... It is clear, therefore, that\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of\nIndia\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] has, in\nunmistakable terms, stated that the State has to collect quantifiable\ndata showing backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes.\n\nWe are afraid that this portion of the judgment is\ndirectly contrary to the nine-Judge Bench in\nIndra Sawhney [Indra\nSawhney v. Union of India\n, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S)\nSupp 1] . Jeevan Reddy, J., speaking for himself and three other\nlearned Judges, had clearly held:\n\n'[t]he test or requirement of social and educational backwardness\ncannot be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,\nwho indubitably fall within the expression \"backward class of\ncitizens\".'(See SCC p. 727, paras 796 to 797.)\"\n\nR.F. Nariman, J. speaking for the Constitution Bench held thus : (SCC\np. 424, para 24)\n\"24. ... Thus, it is clear that when\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of\nIndia\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] required the\nStates to collect quantifiable data on backwardness, insofar as\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are concerned, this would\nclearly be contrary to\nIndra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of\nIndia\n, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1] and would\nhave to be declared to be bad on this ground.\"\n\n44. The decision in\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8\nSCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] has been followed in several\nsubsequent decisions of this Court : (i) Suraj Bhan Meena v. State of\nRajasthan [Suraj Bhan Meena v.

State of Rajasthan\n,\n(2011) 1 SCC 467 : (2011) 1 SCC (L&S) 1] the question which arose\nfor consideration before a two-Judge Bench of this Court was\nformulated thus : (SCC p. 480, para 49)\n\"49. The primary question which we are called upon to answer in\nthese five special leave petitions is whether the amended provisions\nof\nArticle 16(4-A)\nof the Constitution intended that those belonging\nto the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, who had\nbeen promoted against reserved quota, would also be entitled to\nconsequential seniority on account of such promotions, or would the\n\"catch-up\" rule prevail.\"\n\nAnswering this question, this Court held thus : (SCC p. 484, para 66)\n\"66. The position after the decision in\nM. Nagaraj\ncase [\nM.\nNagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S)\n1013] is that reservation of posts in promotion is dependent on the\ninadequacy of representation of members of the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes and subject to the\ncondition of ascertaining as to whether such reservation was at all\nrequired.\"\n\nThe Court held that since no exercise was carried out by the State of\nRajasthan to acquire quantifiable data regarding the inadequacy of\nrepresentation of Scheduled Castes and Tribes in public services in\nthe State, the High Court was justified in quashing the notifications\nproviding for consequential seniority and promotion.\n\n46.\nIn\nPanneer Selvam [S. Panneer Selvam v. State of T.N.\n, (2015)\n10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 76] the issue before a two-Judge\nBench of this Court was thus : (SCC p. 298, para 1)\n\"1.1. (i) In the absence of policy decision taken by the State/rules\nframed pursuant to the enabling provision of\nArticle 16(4-A)\nof the\nConstitution of India, whether a reserved category candidate\npromoted on the basis of reservation earlier than his senior general\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 96 of 103\n\ncategory candidate in the feeder category can claim consequential\nseniority in the promotional post?\"\n\nRule 12 of the sub-rules to the Tamil Nadu Highways and\nEngineering Service provided as follows:\n\n\"12. Reservation of appointment.--The rule of reservation of\nappointments (General Rule 22) shall apply to the appointment of\nAssistant Divisional Engineers by direct recruitment and recruitment\nby transfer separately and the appointment of Assistant Engineers by\ndirect recruitment.\"\n\nUnder Rule 12, reserved category Assistant and Junior Engineers had\nsecured promotion as Assistant Divisional Engineers earlier than their\ncounterparts belonging to the general category as a result of\naccelerated promotion following the rule of reservation.\n\n47. R. Banumathi, J. speaking for the two-Judge Bench held that\nRule 12 did not provide for consequential seniority to candidates\ndrawn from the reserved category who are granted accelerated\npromotion and, in the absence of a specific provision or policy,\nconsequential seniority could not be granted : (\nPanneer Selvam\n\ncase [\nS. Panneer Selvam v. State of T.N.\n, (2015) 10 SCC 292 : (2016)\n1 SCC (L&S) 76] , SCC p. 308, para 26)\n\"26. The true legislative intent under\nArticle 16(4-A)\nof the\nConstitution is to enable the State to make provision or frame rules\ngiving consequential seniority for the accelerated promotion gained\nbased on the rule of reservation. Rule 12 evidently does not provide\nfor the consequential seniority for reserved category promotees at\nany point of time. The consequential seniority for such reserved\ncategory promotees can be fixed only if there is express provision for\nsuch reserved category promotees in the State rules. In the absence\nof any specific provision or policy decision taken by the State\nGovernment for consequential seniority for reserved category\naccelerated promotees, there is no question of automatic application\nof\nArticle 16(4-A)\nof the Constitution.\"\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 97 of 103\n\nThe Court noted that the appellants who belonged to the general\ncategory were not questioning the accelerated promotion granted to\ntheir counterparts from the reserved category by following the rule\nof reservation but were only seeking the application of the catch-up\nrule in the fixation of seniority in the promotional cadre. The Court\nheld that in the absence of any provision of consequential seniority in\nthe rules, the catch-up rule will prevail : (\nPanneer Selvam\ncase [\nS.\nPanneer Selvam v. State of T.N.\n, (2015) 10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC\n(L&S) 76] , SCC pp. 312-13, para 36)\n\"36. In the absence of any provision for consequential seniority in\nthe rules, the \"catch-up rule\" will be applicable and the roster-point\nreserved category promotees cannot count their seniority in the\npromoted category from the date of their promotion and the senior\ngeneral candidates if later reach the promotional level, general\ncandidates will regain their seniority.\n\nThe Division Bench appears to\nhave proceeded [\nV. Vivekanandan v. S. Pannerselvam\n, 2011 SCC\nOnLine Mad 2241 : (2012) 2 Mad LJ 346] on an erroneous footing\nthat\nArticle 16(4-A)\nof the Constitution of India automatically gives\nthe consequential seniority in addition to accelerated promotion to\nthe roster-point promotees and the judgment of the Division Bench\ncannot be sustained.\"\n\n48. The decision in\nPanneer Selvam [S. Panneer Selvam v. State of\nT.N.\n, (2015) 10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 76] has since been\nfollowed by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in\nB.K. Pavitra [B.K.\nPavitra v. Union of India\n, (2017) 4 SCC 620 : (2017) 2 SCC (L&S)\n128] .\n\nA.K. Goel, J. speaking for the Bench held thus : (B.K. Pavitra\ncase [\nB.K. Pavitra v. Union of India\n, (2017) 4 SCC 620 : (2017) 2\nSCC (L&S) 128] , SCC p. 641, para 29)\n\"29.\nIt is clear from the above discussion in S. Panneer\nSelvam v. State of T.N. [S. Panneer Selvam v. State of T.N., (2015)\n10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 76] that exercise for determining\n\"inadequacy of representation\", \"backwardness\" and \"overall\nefficiency\", is a must for exercise of power under\nArticle 16(4-A).\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 98 of 103\n\nMere fact that there is no proportionate representation in\npromotional posts for the population of SCs and STs is not by itself\nenough to grant consequential seniority to promotees who are\notherwise junior and thereby denying seniority to those who are\ngiven promotion later on account of reservation policy. It is for the\nState to place material on record that there was compelling necessity\nfor exercise of such power and decision of the State was based on\nmaterial including the study that overall efficiency is not\ncompromised. In the present case, no such exercise has been\nundertaken. The High Court erroneously observed [\nM.\nNagaraj v. Union of India\n, 2010 SCC OnLine Kar 5407] that it was for\nthe petitioners to plead and prove that the overall efficiency was\nadversely affected by giving consequential seniority to junior persons\nwho got promotion on account of reservation. Plea that persons\npromoted at the same time were allowed to retain their seniority in\nthe lower cadre is untenable and ignores the fact that a senior\nperson may be promoted later and not at the same time on account\nof roster point reservation. Depriving him of his seniority affects his\nfurther chances of promotion. Further plea that seniority was not a\nfundamental right is equally without any merit in the present context.\nIn absence of exercise under\nArticle 16(4-A)\n, it is the \"catch-up\" rule\nwhich fully applies. It is not necessary to go into the question\nwhether the Corporation concerned had adopted the rule of\nconsequential seniority.\"\n\n67.\nIn\nSuraj Bhan Meena [Suraj Bhan Meena v. State of Rajasthan\n,\n(2011) 1 SCC 467 : (2011) 1 SCC (L&S) 1] , the petitioners had\nchallenged a Notification dated 25-4-2008 issued by the State of\nRajasthan under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution,\namending the Rajasthan \"Various Service Rules\" with effect from 28-\n12-2012. This was challenged on the ground that the deletion\namounted to giving consequential seniority to candidates belonging\nto the Scheduled Castes and Tribes without carrying out the exercise\nof collecting quantifiable data.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 99 of 103\n\n68.\nIn\nU.P. Power Corpn. [U.P. Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Rajesh Kumar\n,\n(2012) 7 SCC 1 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 289] , there was a specific\nchallenge before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad to the\nvalidity of Rule 8-A of the U.P. Government Servants Seniority Rules,\n2007.\nSection 3\nof the Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes)\nAct, 1994 and Rule 8-A of the 1991 Rules brought into force in 2007\nwere challenged as being ultra vires and unconstitutional. As a\nconsequence, the consequential orders relating to seniority were\nimpugned.\n\nOnce again, the challenge was on the ground that the\nexercise which was required in pursuance of the decision of this\nCourt in\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] had not been carried out.\n\n69.\nIn\nPanneer Selvam [S. Panneer Selvam v. State of T.N.\n, (2015)\n10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 76] , Rule 12 of the Special Rules\nto Tamil Nadu Highways Engineering Service provided that the rule\nof reservation of appointments (General Rule 22) shall apply to the\nappointment of Assistant Divisional Engineers by direct recruitment\nand by transfer of the appointment of Assistant Engineers. This Court\nheld that Rule 12 did not provide for consequential seniority and, in\nthe absence of a provision for consequential seniority catch-up rule\nwill be applicable.\n\nThe litigation in\nPanneer Selvam [S. Panneer\nSelvam v. State of T.N.\n, (2015) 10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 76]\ndid not engage a situation such as the present where the GR dated\n20-3-2003 specifically provides for consequential seniority.\n\n70. The decision in\nB.K. Pavitra [B.K. Pavitra v. Union of India\n, (2017)\n4 SCC 620 : (2017) 2 SCC (L&S) 128] involved a specific challenge to\nthe validity of the Karnataka Determination of Seniority of the\nGovernment Servants promoted on the basis of Reservation (to the\nposts in the Civil Services of the State) Act, 2002.\nThe Act\nwas struck\ndown by a two-Judge Bench of this Court on the ground that the\nState had not undertaken an exercise to establish a \"compelling\nnecessity\" since no material had been placed by the State on record.\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 100 of 103\n\n71. All these decisions (except the decision in\nPanneer Selvam [S.\nPanneer Selvam v. State of T.N.\n, (2015) 10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC\n(L&S) 76] ) involved a specific challenge to the validity of\nadministrative notifications or, as the case may be, an Act of the\nlegislature.\n\nPanneer Selvam [S. Panneer Selvam v. State of T.N.\n,\n(2015) 10 SCC 292 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 76] was a case where in\nthe absence of a provision for consequential seniority, it was held\nthat the catch-up rule will prevail. In the present case, there is a\nspecific provision for consequential seniority in the GR dated 20-3-\n2003. Absent a challenge to the GR in the proceedings which were\ninitiated before the Tribunal, such a challenge cannot be entertained\nat this stage.\"\n\n52.\nIn view of the fact that the Judgments\nreferred above\nhave\n\nalso been referred to at the bar as such no further discussions is\n\nnecessary in respect of the Judgments referred to by the rival\n\ncounsel in support of their contentions in respect of the issue of\n\nreservation on promotion with consequential seniority.\n\n53. Therefore, the consistent views both by the Apex Court as\n\nwell as by a Division Bench of this Court having held that the\n\nState is within its liberty to grant or not to grant the benefit of\n\nconsequential seniority during promotions of reserved category\n\ncandidates, the impugned Office Memorandum dated 18.01.2023\n\nbringing in the policy of catch-up Rule and superseding the earlier\n\npolicy of consequential seniority cannot be held to be bad in law.\n\n54. The subsequent part of Clause 4A whereby, it is provided\n\nthat where notwithstanding the reserved quota having been met\n\nby the reserved category candidates, if there are suitable\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 101 of 103\n\ncandidates belonging to the reserved category in the zone of\n\nconsideration, then such candidates can be considered provided\n\nthese candidates did not gain the benefit of accelerated seniority\n\nduring their promotions by virtue of the Rule of reservation also\n\ncannot be held to be incongruous. If the first part of Clause 4A is\n\nheld to be valid then the later part of Clause 4A which provides\n\nfor consideration of those reserved category candidates for\n\npromotion if there otherwise within the zone of consideration and\n\nthey did not get the benefits of consequential seniority during\n\ntheir promotion under the reservation policy is also required to be\n\nconsequentially held to be valid as it is a sequel to the policy of\n\nthe State Government of granting reservation and promotion but\n\nwithout consequential seniority. No fault can be found with regard\n\nto such policy being implemented by the State. The claim of the\n\npetitioners that by the impugned notification, then vested right\n\nhave been sought to be taken away is also not made out and\n\ntherefore such claims are also rejected.\n\n55. That apart the second part of Clause 4A is parameteria with\n\nClause 4 of the earlier Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 and\n\nwhich provisions has already been upheld by the Division Bench\n\nof this Court in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra). The Division Bench\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 102 of 103\n\nhad declined to interfere with the Clause 4 of the Office\n\nMemorandum dated 03.08.2016. This Judgment of the Division\n\nBench has not been subsequently assailed and therefore, the\n\nsame has attained finality.\n\nConsequently, the findings of the\n\nDivision Bench in\nIvy Gohain Dasgupta\n(Supra) are equally\n\nbinding on this Court.\n\n56. In view of all the above discussions held, the writ petitions\n\nfail, the prayers in the writ petitions are found to be devoid of\n\nmerit and therefore, the writ petitions are rejected. No order as to\n\ncost.\n\n57. Pending I.A.s are also disposed of.\n\nJUDGE\nComparing Assistant\n\nW.P(C) No. 363/2023 & Ors Page 103 of 103",
