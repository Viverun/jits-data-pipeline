The above referred observations made in the fifteen\n decisions that have distinguished \nRangaiah\n case demonstrate\n that the wide principle enunciated therein is substantially\n watered-down. Almost all the decisions that distinguished\n Rangaiah hold that there is no rule of universal application to\n the effect that vacancies must necessarily be filled on the basis\n of law that existed on the date when they arose. This only\n implies that decision in Rangaiah is confined to the facts of that\n case.\n\n \n84. The decision in \nDeepak Agarwal Vs. State of U.P.\n,\n (2011) 6 SCC 725 is a complete departure from the principle\n in Rangaiah inasmuch as the Court has held that a candidate\n has a right to be considered in the light of the existing\n rule. That is the rule in force on the date the consideration takes\n place.\n \nThis enunciation is followed in many subsequent\n decisions including that of \nUnion of India v. Krishna Kumar\n ,\n (2019) 4 SCC 319. In fact, in Krishna Kumar Court held that\n there is only a \"right to be considered for promotion in\n accordance with rules which prevail on the date on which\n consideration for promotion takes place.\"\n\n \n85.

However, as there\n is no declaration of law to this effect, it continues to be cited as\n a precedent and this Court has been distinguishing it on some\n\n Page 75 of 78\n\n 76 OA No.1035/2022\n\n & 908/2022\n\n ground or the other, as we have indicated hereinabove.

It is clear from the above judgment of\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the Rule\n\n prevalent as on the date of selection will be\n\n applicable even if the vacancies arose before\n\n the Rule was enacted. Admittedly, AVC was\n\n issued on 02.06.2014 and, therefore, for the\n\n selection after 02.06.2014, the applicants will\n\n be governed by the above AVC.\n\n 26.

It\n specifies the modality for combined seniority list. This merger\n has been impugned mainly on the apprehension of loss of\n promotional avenue and on the ground that the two cadres\n were not to be merged. However, we see that these two\n cadres were ordered to be merged mainly on the plea that\n elsewhere these two were the common cadre and not the\n respective ones. Further, such merger was not violative of\n provisions of rules/instructions.\n\n 7. At any rate, we also see that there was a provision to\n file objection to the combined seniority list, should an\n employee feel dissatisfied with it, which clearly affords an\n opportunity to the aggrieved employees to represent against\n the proposed move of combined seniority. A decision about\n maintenance or curation of a cadre is the prerogative of the\n employer and here, the respondents proposed to merge the\n two cadres on the grounds of their administrative/operational\n exigency and in our considered view, their decision per se\n does not suffer from any legal infirmity. Their steps of\n operationalizing the proposed merger has given opportunity\n to the affected persons to represent against it.
