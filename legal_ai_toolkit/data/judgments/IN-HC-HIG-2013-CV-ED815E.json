Union of India and others\n, CWP No.6927 of 2011\n\ndecided on 25.1.2013 inter alia observed as follows:-\n\n\"We are conscious of the fact that the statutory\n\nappeal against such an order is provided under\nSection\nof the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 (for short - 'the\n\nAct'), however, having regard to the Constitution Bench\n\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of \"L.\n\nChandra Kumar etc. v. The Union of India and others\"\n\nAIR 1997 SC 1125 and also that of Delhi High Court in\n\nCWP No.13360 of 2009 titled as \"\nColonel A.D.\n\nNargolkar v.

Chandra Kumar etc. v. The Union of India and\n\nothers, AIR 1997 SC 1125 it was held that power of judicial review is\n\na basic and essential feature of the Constitution. Broadly speaking, it\n\nwas held that judicial review in India comprises of three aspects; (i)\n\njudicial review of legislative action, (ii) judicial review of judicial\n\ndecision and (iii) judicial review of administrative action. The Judges\n\nof the Superior Courts have been entrusted with the task of\n\nupholding the Constitution and to this end have been conferred the\n\npower to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure the balance of\n\npower envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and that the\n\nlegislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their\n\nfunctions, transgress constitutional limitations. Therefore, this Court\n\ngoing by the decision in L. Chandra Kumar's case (Supra) has power\n\nof judicial review in respect of the judicial decisions of the Tribunal in\n\nterms of\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution.\n\nIn view of the above, the writ petition is held to be\n\nmaintainable.\n\nThe petitioner initially rendered Army service of 8 years\n\nand 332 days. Thereafter, he was enrolled in the Defence Security\n\nCorps ('DSC' - for short) on 09.03.1983. The petitioner was served\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -4-\n\nwith a charge sheet (Annexure P-1) on account of an act prejudicial\n\nto good order and military discipline. It was alleged that at Ambala\n\nCantt. between 22.00 hours and 22.30 hours on 02.03.1987 while at\n\npost No.2, he improperly and without authority fired one round in the\n\nair from his 7.62 mm bolt action rifle. In the order of the Tribunal, it is\n\nrecorded that the petitioner while on duty was forced to fire one\n\nround in the air to save himself from the aggressor, who was another\n\nsepoy of the platoon and was armed with a rifle. The petitioner was\n\ntried by a Summary Court Martial and in terms of order passed on\n\n12.04.1988, he was found guilty and dismissed from service. The\n\npetitioner filed a writ petition (CWP No.5988 of 1989) in this Court for\n\nsupplying him proceedings of the Court Martial. The said writ petition\n\nwas allowed by this Court. The petitioner in the meantime filed a\n\npetition under\nSection 164 (2)\nof the Army Act, 1950. The General\n\nOfficer Commanding in Chief vide order dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure\n\nP-2) on the post confirmation petition dated 25.07.1988 submitted by\n\nthe petitioner against the award of the Summary Court Martial\n\npartially agreed with the recommendations of the General Officer,\n\nCommanding PH and HP Area. The sentence of dismissal awarded\n\nto the petitioner was commuted to discharge; besides, it was directed\n\nthat the petitioner shall be deemed to have been discharged with\n\neffect from the date of original sentence of dismissal became\n\noperative.\n\nThe petitioner then filed a writ petition (CWP No.17050 of\n\n1989) in this Court which was taken up for hearing on 11.01.1995.\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -5-\n\nBy this time, the petitioner was due for retirement on superannuation\n\nfrom service. The writ petition was disposed of vide order dated\n\n11.01.1995 (Annexure P-3). It was observed by the learned Single\n\nJudge of this Court that even though the petitioner had raised several\n\ngrounds to challenge the impugned action of his discharge, his\n\nlearned counsel stated that he had remained unemployed since 1989\n\nfrom the date of his discharge and was in a bad shape and he would\n\nbe satisfied if the authorities reconsider his claim for grant of pension\n\nsympathetically. It was pointed out that the petitioner had rendered\n\nmore than 15 years of service by 23.03.1989 i.e. the date of his\n\ndischarge from service vide order Annexure P-2. It was also\n\nsubmitted that the factors which weighed with the authorities while\n\ncommuting the punishment from dismissal to discharge were that the\n\npetitioner would be able to earn his pension. The learned Senior\n\nStanding counsel for the Union of India submitted that if the petitioner\n\nmakes a representation to the competent authority within one month\n\nfrom 11.01.1995, it would be considered and decided\n\nsympathetically. In view of the above, it seemed fair to this Court\n\nthat the petitioner should be allowed to make a representation to the\n\nrespondents for grant of pension. In case such a representation was\n\nmade within one month from 11.01.1995, the competent authority it\n\nwas directed shall consider it sympathetically and decide it as\n\nexpeditiously as possible. It was further observed that keeping in\n\nview the fact that the petitioner had completed more than 14 years of\n\nservice as on the date of his dismissal from service and more than 15\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -6-\n\nyears on 23.03.1989, when he was ordered to be discharged from\n\nservice, it would be fair and proper if his claim was considered\n\nsympathetically. In fact insofar as the petitioner was concerned, it\n\nwas observed that there would be no difference to him between\n\ndismissal or discharge from service unless his claim was considered\n\nfor the grant of pension. In view of the totality of the circumstances,\n\nthe writ petition was disposed of with the direction that the petitioner\n\nshall make a representation within one month from 11.01.1995 which\n\nthe respondents were to consider and decide. It was clarified that in\n\ncase the respondents consider his claim for grant of pension, he\n\nshall not be entitled to claim any arrears of pension etc.\n\nIn consequence of the order dated 11.01.1995 (Annexure\n\nP-3) passed by this Court, the petitioner submitted a representation\n\ndated 10.02.1995. According to the petitioner his main submission\n\nwas that the order of his discharge from service was not liable to be\n\nmade with retrospective effect and it is to be prospective. The order\n\ndated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) commuting the sentence of\n\ndismissal to discharge, it was submitted was made in a manner that it\n\nbrought in operation the discharge of the petitioner from service with\n\nthe retrospective date. It was also submitted by the petitioner that he\n\nhad rendered 5 years, 1 month and 3 days service in the DSC and\n\nhe had a continuous service of 9 years in the Army which was\n\nrequired to be added to the present service for the purpose of\n\npension. He in fact had 14 years and 1 month of service to his credit.\n\nService of five months more would have been required so as to\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -7-\n\nentitle the petitioner to earn his pension on commutation of his\n\nsentence of dismissal to discharge. However, the petitioner had\n\nmore than 15 years of service to his credit on the date when his\n\nsentence of dismissal was commuted to discharge i.e. On\n\n23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2).\n\nThe representation of the petitioner was considered by\n\nthe Government of India, Ministry of Defence vide impugned order\n\ndated 30.04.1996 (Annexure P-4). It was inter alia mentioned that\n\nthe representation of the petitioner dated 10.02.1995 had been\n\nconsidered de novo in the Ministry of Defence in consultation with the\n\nArmy Headquarters. It was found that the petitioner had been\n\ncharged under\nSection 63\nof the Army Act, 1950 which relates to\n\nviolation of good order and discipline. He was tried by the Special\n\nCourt Martial on 12.04.1988 and he was awarded punishment of\n\n'dismissal from service'. Accordingly, he was dismissed from service\n\nwith effect from 12.04.1988. Subsequently in pursuance of the post\n\nconfirmation petition dated 25.07.1988 submitted by the petitioner,\n\nthe General Officer Commanding in Chief, Western Command\n\ncommuted the sentence of 'dismissal' to 'discharge'. It was also\n\ndirected that the date of discharge of the petitioner from service\n\nwould be effective from the same date from which the original\n\nsentence of dismissal became operative i.e. with effect from\n\n12.04.1988. It was further observed that in view of the foregoing, it\n\nwas clear that there was no dispute regarding the date of discharge\n\nof the petitioner from service, which was 12.04.1988. It was also\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -8-\n\nobserved that no retirement benefits as otherwise due on 12.04.1988\n\nwould have been admissible to the petitioner had he been dismissed\n\nfrom service, however, the retriment benefits as per admissibility\n\nwere payable to him under the Army Pension Regulations. Thus by\n\ncommuting his sentence from 'dismissal' to 'discharge', he was held\n\nentitled to receive retirement benefits as dismissal under Rules\n\ndepending on the length of service rendered by him upto 12.04.1988.\n\nAs per service record of the petitioner, the total qualifying service on\n\nthe day of his discharge from service i.e. on 12.04.1988 worked out\n\nto 14 years and 1 day only, which included his earlier service of 8\n\nyears and 330 days. In this manner, there was a short fall of 11\n\nmonths of service required for 15 years service for grant of pension.\n\nService pension was, therefore, not admissible to him in terms of\n\nRegulation 132\nof the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 (Part\n\nI). Further, condonation of deficiency in service only upto 6 months\n\nwas permissible under the Pension Regulations. In case of the\n\npetitioner, the deficiency in service was more than six months and\n\nthe same, it was observed, could not be condoned. The petitioner\n\nwas, however, held entitled to grant of Service Gratuity, Death cum\n\nRetirement Gratuity amounting to Rs.22,325/- for 14 years of service\n\nwhich had already been paid to him. The service gratuity otherwise\n\nwould not have been admissible to him had his punishment not been\n\ncommuted from 'dismissal' to 'discharge'. In view of the foregoing\n\nposition, it was held that no pension was payable to him under the\n\nRules. The petitioner now claims for the grant of pension.\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -9-\n\nNotice of motion was issued to the respondents.\n\nReply has been filed on behalf of the respondents. It has\n\ninter alia been submitted that the petitioner initially served with the\n\nSikh LI for the period from 23.07.1973 to 29.09.1982. He served with\n\nthe Sikh LI for more than 9 years. Thereafter he was enrolled in the\n\nDSC on 09.03.1983. His qualifying service countable towards\n\npension/gratuity in DSC was only 8 years and 332 days after\n\ndeducting 102 days being non-qualifying service due to absence from\n\nservice of the petitioner for the periods from 13.08.1973 to\n\n05.09.1973; 20.08.1977 to 17.09.1977 and from 02.08.1981 to\n\n20.09.1981. Accordingly his formal service of 8 years and 332 days\n\nwas counted towards pension/gratuity in DSC by the PAO (OR) DSC.\n\nThe petitioner was posted in RR to 140 B DSC Platoon attached to\n\nHQ 448 Coy ASE (Pet) Ambala Cantt. on 25.12.1986 and not during\n\n1983 as mentioned in the writ petition. He was involved in\n\ndisciplinary proceedings while serving with 140 B DSC Platoon\n\nattached with Head Quarters 448 Coy ASC (Pet) Ambala Cantt.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the\n\npetitioner is entitled for the benefit of pension as he has rendered 15\n\nyears of service till the date of his discharge from service on\n\n02.03.1989. In any case, it is submitted that even if it is taken that\n\nthe petitioner has rendered 14 years and 1 month of service, the\n\nperiod of short fall of 11 months for qualifying service for grant of\n\npension is liable to be condoned in terms of Government of India\n\norder dated 14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) and Government of India\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -10-\n\norder dated 21.07.2001 that have been filed. Therefore, the\n\npetitioner is liable to be given the benefit of pension.\n\nIn response, learned counsel for the respondents has\n\nplaced strong reliance on Note 5 (a) of\nSection 179\nof the Army Act,\n\n1950 which is placed on record as Annexure R-1. The same\n\nenvisages that a sentence of dismissal might be remitted on the\n\ncondition that the person sentenced shall not receive pay in respect\n\nof or count service for any purpose during the period spent under\n\ndismissal; besides, the conditions, if any must be clearly stated that\n\nthe written acceptance of the person obtained and that the mitigation\n\nor commutation cannot be made conditional. Therefore, it is\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner is not entitled for any benefit of pension.\n\nWe have given our thoughtful consideration to the matter.\n\nThe factual aspects are not much in dispute. The petitioner has\n\nrendered initial service with the Sikh LI for the period from\n\n23.07.1973 to 29.09.1982. The said service according to the Army\n\nrecords works out to about 8 years and 332 days. Thereafter, the\n\npetitioner was enrolled in the DSC on 09.03.1983 in which he\n\ncontinued till the date of his dismissal from service on 12.04.1988.\n\nThis was subsequently vide order dated 23.03.1989 commuted to\n\ndischarge. It was directed that the petitioner shall be deemed to have\n\nbeen discharged with effect from the date the original sentence of\n\ndismissal became operative, that is, from 12.04.1988. In this manner\n\nthe petitioner had 14 years and 1 month of service. The qualifying\n\nservice for grant of pension is undisputedly 15 years. There is,\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -11-\n\ntherefore, a short fall of 11 months of service for entitlement for\n\npension. However, in case the service of the petitioner is to be taken\n\nto have been dispensed with from 23.03.1989 when his sentence of\n\ndismissal was commuted to that of discharge, he completes 15\n\nyears of service.\n\nTwo fold questions, therefore, would require consideration\n\nas to whether the short fall of 11 months of service so as to have the\n\nnecessary qualifying service for entitlement for pension can be\n\ncondoned; and whether the order of commutation of dismissal from\n\nservice to that of discharge in respect of the petitioner becomes\n\neffective from the date of the order of discharge, that is, from\n\n23.03.1989.\n\nThe learned Armed Forces Tribunal in its impugned order\n\ndated 03.11.2011 inter alia observed that a look at the order dated\n\n30.04.1996 (Annexure P-4) by which the representation of the\n\npetitioner was declined showed that it proceeded on the basis of the\n\nprovisions of\nRegulation 132\nof the Pension Regulations and the\n\nreason given was that condonation in deficiency of service only up to\n\n6 months was permissible, while in the case of the petitioner, it was\n\nmore than 6 months. Therefore, he was not held entitled to service\n\npension, besides, service gratuity had already been paid to him.\n\nRegulation 132\nof the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 Part I\n\nrelates to minimum qualifying service of pension, which reads as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"Minimum Qualifying Service for Pension\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -12-\n\n132. The minimum period of qualifying service (without\n\nweightage) actually rendered and required for earning\n\npension shall be 15 years\"\n\nThe learned Tribunal, therefore, relying on the said\n\nprovision and the instructions applicable held that for condonation of\n\ndeficiency of service that was permissible was only up to six months\n\nwhile in the case of the petitioner it was more than six months. As\n\nsuch, he was not held entitled to service pension. The petitioner has,\n\nhowever, placed on record Government of India order dated\n\n14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) according to which the shortfall in\n\nqualifying service for grant of pension in respect of PBOR (personnel\n\nbelow officers rank) can be beyond six months and upto 12 months.\n\nThe relevant extract of the said Government of India order dated\n\n14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) reads as under:-\n\n\"Sanction is hereby accorded in pursuance of MOD ID\n\nNo.34 (3)/2001/D (O& M) dated 3.08.2001 for delegation\n\nof administrative powers with the approval of Raksha\n\nMantri to the Service HQrs in respect of the subject\n\nindicated below:-\n\n(a) (i) to (iv) xxxxx\n\n(v) Condonation of shortfall in Qualifying\n\nService for grant of pension in respect of PBOR\n\n(Personnel below officers rank) beyond six months\n\nand upto 12 months.\n\n(vi) to (xiv) xxxxx\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -13-\n\n(b) xxxx\n\n(c) xxxx\n\n(d) xxxx\n\n2 to 5. xxxxx\n\n6.

The order, however, takes\n\neffect from the date of issue i.e. 14.08.2011. This has, however,\n\nbeen further clarified by the Government vide order MOD ID No.12\n\n(2)/04/Den/Sers dated 21.07.2004 which has been placed on record\n\nand reads as under:-\n\n\"Ministry of Defence\n\nSubject: Condonation of short fall in qualifying service for\n\ngrant of pensionary benefits in respect of personnel below\n\nofficer ranks beyond six months and upto twelve months-\n\nclarification regarding.\n\nKindly refer to CGDA ID Note No. 5669/ ATP/\n\nContempt/R.H.

It is clarified that the services Hqrs are\n\nempowered to exercise the powers delegated to them\n\nvide order No.4684/Dir(P)/2001 dated 14.08.2001 even to\n\nthe cases which were pending with prior to issue of the\n\norders. However, they are required to exercise the power\n\nin the interest of justice, equity and fair play.\n\nAs discussed on telephone on 21.07.2004, CGDA/\n\nPCDA (P), Allahabad is requested to take further\n\nnecessary action in the light of above clarification.\n\nHarbans Singh\nDir (Pen)\"\n\nA perusal of the above shows that it has been clarified\n\nthat the services headquarters are empowered to exercise the\n\npowers delegated to them vide order dated 14.08.2001 (Annexure\n\nA-1) even to the cases which were pending with prior to issue of the\n\norders. However, they were required to exercise the power in the\n\ninterest of justice, equity and fair play. Therefore, even in respect of\n\npending cases the power can be exercised for condoning the short\n\nfall or deficiency in qualifying service from six months to twelve\n\nmonths. The said orders dated 14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) and\n\n21.07.2004 were not urged or brought to the notice of the learned\n\nTribunal. The learned Tribunal in its impugned order inter alia\n\nobserved that a period of short fall of six months only could be\n\ncondoned and not eleven months. The same, would not be\n\nsustainable and in fact a period of up to twelve months can be\n\ncondoned. The petitioner has a short fall of eleven months which can\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -15-\n\nbe condoned and this in fact is the tenor, intent and spirit of the order\n\ndated 11.01.1995 (Annexure P-3) passed by this Court in the writ\n\npetition filed by the petitioner whereby he restricted his claim for the\n\ngrant of pension only which was to be considered sympathetically by\n\nthe Union of India in accordance with the stand taken on its behalf by\n\nthe learned Senior standing counsel appearing for it. Therefore, the\n\nperiod of elven months was liable to be condoned.\n\nAs regards the other condition with regard to the effective\n\ndates for discharge, the learned counsel for the respondents has\n\nplaced strong reliance on Note 5 (a) of\nSection 179\nof the Army Act,\n\n1950. The said Note 5 (a) of\nSection 179\nof the Army Act, 1950\n\nreads as under:-\n\n\"A sentence of dismissal might be remitted on the\n\nconditions that the person sentenced shall not receive\n\npay in respect of or count service for any purpose during\n\nthe period spent under dismissal.

Mitigation or commutation cannot be\n\nmade conditional.\"\n\nIn terms of the above note, sentence of dismissal might\n\nbe remitted on the condition that the person sentenced shall not\n\nreceive pay in respect of or count service for any purpose during the\n\nperiod spent under dismissal and the conditions, if any, must be\n\nclearly stated and that the written acceptance of the person obtained.\n\nBesides, mitigation or commutation cannot be made conditional.\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -16-\n\nHowever, the above is only a note under\nSection 179\nof the Army\n\nAct, 1950 which relates to pardon and remission. The said note, even\n\notherwise relates to the period spent under dismissal. The same in\n\nany case would not over ride the provisions of the\nArmy Act\n1950,\n\nthe Army Rules 1954 or the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961.\n\nThe claim of the petitioner if permissible under the relevant statutory\n\nrules and regulations cannot be defeated by reference to a note. The\n\nquestion, in fact that requires to be considered for the grant of\n\npensionary benefits is the date from which the order of discharge\n\nbecomes effective.\nSection 22\nof the Army Act, 1950 and Rule 18 of\n\nthe Army Rules, 1954 deal with this aspect. The same read as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"\nSection 22\n. Retirement, release or discharge.- Any\n\nperson subject to this Act may be retired, released or\n\ndischarged from the service by such authority and in such\n\nmanner as may be prescribed.\n\nRule 18. Date from which retirement, resignation,\n\nremoval, release, discharge or dismissal otherwise than\n\nby sentence of court-martial takes effect:-\n\n(1) The dismissal of an officer under\nSection 19\nor the\n\nretirement, resignation, release or removal of such officer\n\nshall take effect from the date specified in that behalf in\n\nthe notification of such dismissal, retirement or removal in\n\nthe Official Gazette.\n\n(2) The dismissal of a person subject to the Act, other\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -17-\n\nthan an officer whose dismissal otherwise than by\n\nsentence of a court-martial is duly authorised or the\n\ndischarge of a person so subject whose discharge, if duly\n\nauthorised,shall be carried out by the commanding officer\n\nof such person with all convenient speed. The authority\n\ncompetent to authorise such dismissal or discharge may,\n\nwhen authorising the dismissal or discharge, specify any\n\nfuture date from which it shall take effect.\n\nProvided that if no such date is specified the\n\ndismissal or discharge shall take effect from the date on\n\nwhich it was duly authorised or from the date on which the\n\nperson dismissed or discharged, ceased to perform\n\nmilitary duty whichever is the later date.\n\n(3)The retirement, removal, resignation release,\n\ndischarge or dismissal of a person subject to the Act\n\nshall not be retrospective.\"\n\nSection 22\nof the Army Act provides that any person\n\nsubject to this Act may be retired, released or discharged from the\n\nservice by such authority and in such manner as may be prescribed.\n\n'Prescibed' has been defined in\nSection 3 (xix)\nto mean prescribed by\n\nrules made under the\nArmy Act\n. Rule 18 inter alia relates to the date\n\nfrom which dismissal or discharge is to take effect. In the present\n\ncase, as has already been noticed, the petitioner was tried by the\n\nSummary Court Martial and in terms of order passed on 12.04.1988,\n\nhe was dismissed from service. Thereafter, the General Officer\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -18-\n\nCommanding in Chief vide order dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2)\n\non the post confirmation petition submitted by the petitioner\n\ncommuted the dismissal to discharge. It was, however, directed that\n\nthe petitioner shall be deemed to have been discharged with effect\n\nfrom the date of original sentence of dismissal became operative.\n\nHowever, the effective date of dismissal or discharge is to be\n\ndetermined in accordance with the Rule 18 of the Army Rules, 1954.\n\nIt is well-known that if a procedure is prescribed by the Rules, then\n\nthat procedure alone is to be followed and all other procedures are\n\nforbidden. Therefore, there being a provision in terms of Rule 18 of\n\nthe Army Rules, the effective date for determining the dismissal or\n\ndischarge, as the case may be, is Rule 18 of the Army Rules. Sub\n\nRule (1) of Rule 18 envisages the dismissal of an officer under\n\nSection 19\n(which provides that subject to the provision of the\nArmy\n\nAct\nand the rules and regulations made thereunder, the Central\n\nGovernment may dismiss, or remove from the service any person\n\nsubject to the\nArmy Act\n) or the retirement, resignation, release or\n\nremoval of such officer shall take effect from the date specified in\n\nthat behalf in the notification of such dismissal, retirement or removal\n\nin the Official Gazette. There is no official gazette notification placed\n\non the record from which the petitioner can be said to have been\n\nreleased and neither is the petitioner an officer. He in fact is a\n\npersonnel below officer rank (PBOR). Therefore, Sub Rule (1) of\n\nRule 18 is inapplicable. Sub Rule (2) of Rule 18 relates to dismissal\n\nof a person subject to the\nArmy Act\n, other than an officer whose\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -19-\n\ndismissal otherwise than by sentence of court martial is duly\n\nauthorized or the discharge of a person so subject whose discharge,\n\nif duly authorized, is to be carried out by the Commanding Officer of\n\nsuch person with all convenient speed. It is further provided that the\n\nauthority competent to authorize such dismissal or discharge may,\n\nwhen authorizing the dismissal or discharge, specify any future date\n\nfrom which it shall take effect. In terms of the proviso, if no such date\n\nis specified, the dismissal or discharge is to take effect from the date\n\non which it was duly authorized or from the date on which the person\n\ndismissed or discharged ceased to perform military duty whichever is\n\nthe later date. In terms of Sub Rule (3) of Rule 18, the retirement,\n\nremoval, resignation, release, discharge or dismissal of a person\n\nsubject to the Act shall not be retrospective. In the present case the\n\ninitial dismissal by way of Court Martial was later on commuted to\n\ndischarge. The object of discharge was primarily to grant pensionary\n\nand retiral benefits to the petitioner which he otherwise would not\n\nhave been entitled to in the case of dismissal; besides, Sub Rule (2)\n\nprovides for dismissal or discharge from a future date from which it\n\nshall take effect and Sub Rule (3) provides that it shall not be\n\nretrospective.\nIn\nInder Pal Singh v. Union of India and others\n,\n\n2003 (6) SLR 115, a Division Bench of this Court considered the\n\ncase of a Sepoy who injured another Sepoy negligently and was tried\n\nby a Court Martial and dismissed from service. It was held that the\n\ncompetent authority had the jurisdiction to modify the order of\n\ndismissal to one of discharge; besides, after referring to Rule 18 of\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -20-\n\nthe Army Rules and particularly Sub Rule (3) held that the said Sub\n\nRule imposes a restriction that in no case the discharge could be\n\nmade with retrospective effect. It was further observed that a bare\n\nreading of the entire Rule 18 makes it clear that the competent\n\nauthority may order the dismissal or discharge from a future date. In\n\nno circumstances such order could be made from a retrospective\n\ndate. This Court in the said case was also of the opinion that\n\nwhether the discharge was made in the ordinary course or had been\n\nmade as a matter of punishment, in no case, the same could be\n\nmade with retrospective effect. It was also held that there was no\n\nforce in the contention of the respondents that the provisions of Rule\n\n13 or 18 were not applicable in the case of the petitioner because he\n\nhad been punished for dismissal from service by the Summary Court\n\nMartial and thereafter he ceased to be a member of the service and\n\nthe Army Rules were only applicable to the persons who were still in\n\nservice and subject to the\nArmy Act\n. It was held that merely because\n\nthe petitioner was punished by the Court Martial, it could not be said\n\nthat the aforesaid rules were not applicable on him and the\n\npunishment of discharge could be given to him with retrospective\n\neffect. Consequently, the impugned order in the said case to the\n\nextent vide which the petitioner was ordered to have been discharged\n\nfrom service from the date his dismissal order became effective, was\n\nset aside and the order of discharge of the petitioner, it was held,\n\nwould be effective from the date it was passed by the Vice Chief of\n\nArmy Staff. Applying the ratio of said judgment in the present case\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -21-\n\nthe discharge of the petitioner would be effective from the date it was\n\npassed i.e. in terms of order dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2).\n\nThe learned Tribunal referred to\nthe said judgment\nin\n\nInder Pal Singh v. Union of India\n(supra) and it was held that the\n\nearlier petition (i.e. CWP No.17050 of 1989) was filed after the order\n\ndated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) was passed regarding discharge\n\nbeing effective from the date of original sentence of dismissal\n\nbecame operative and the said writ petition was to challenge the\n\nentire action of dismissal or discharge taken against the petitioner. It\n\nwas found that from the order dated 11.01.1995 (Annexure P-3), the\n\norder dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) had been taken into account\n\nin that order. Obviously, therefore, the litigation, it was observed, had\n\nalready culminated in the order dated 11.01.1995, wherein the\n\ncontention regarding the impermissibility of discharge being effective\n\nfrom the date, the original punishment order was operative was not\n\npressed into service. As such it could not be allowed to be raised.\n\nTherefore, the learned Tribunal was of the view that since the\n\ncontention regarding the effective date of discharge was not pressed\n\nwhile disposing of the writ petition (CWP No.17050 of 1989) vide\n\norder dated 11.01.1995, the original punishment was operative and it\n\ncould not be allowed to be raised now. However, we are of the view\n\nthat since the claim of the petitioner is for grant of pension and the\n\nquestion whether he has the requisite entitlement of service for grant\n\nof pension is germane to the matter in issue, it can well be raised and\n\ntaken into account so as to consider his case for the requisite service\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -22-\n\nrendered for the benefit of pension. In fact for the grant of pension\n\nthe rules can be read down so as to grant the same.\n\nTherefore,\n\nkeeping in view the ratio of judgment in\nInder Pal Singh\n's case\n\n(supra), we are of the view that the order of discharge from service\n\nbecame effective from the date of passing the order, that is, from\n\n23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) whereby the dismissal from service of the\n\npetitioner was commuted to discharge. By the said date, that is\n\n23.03.1989, the petitioner had the requisite 15 years of service. As\n\nsuch, on both or any of the account, that were formulated, the\n\npetitioner would be entitled to pension.\n\nConsequently, the writ petition is liable to be allowed.\n\nHowever, in the order dated 11.01.1995 passed in CWP No.17050 of\n\n1989 it was clarified by this Court that in case the respondents\n\nconsider the case of the petitioner for the grant of pension, he would\n\nnot be entitled to claim any arrears of pension etc. The said\n\nrestriction was for the respondents. However, keeping in view the\n\nspirit of the said order the arrears are liable to be restricted to a\n\nperiod of three years earlier to the filing of CWP No.9915 of 1996 in\n\nthis Court, that is, from 08.07.1996.\n\nAccordingly, the writ petition is allowed, the petitioner\n\nwould be entitled to pension for the service rendered by him for a\n\nperiod of 15 years. However, the arrears shall be restricted to three\n\nyears earlier to the filing of CWP No.9915 of 1996 in this Court, that\n\nis, from 08.07.1996 for which the pension be calculated and paid to\n\nthe petitioner. For the period the matter remained pending in this\n\nAmit Kaundal\n\n2013.10.25 13:22\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\nCWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M) -23-\n\nCourt and in the Tribunal, the petitioner cannot be said to be at any\n\nfault and he would be entitled to pension for the said period as well.\n\nThere shall, however, be no costs.\n\n(S.
