Nageswara Rao\n\nREPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 3019 OF 2017\n\nAIR COMMODORE NAVEEN JAIN .....APPELLANT(S)\n\nVERSUS\n\nUNION OF INDIA & ORS. .....RESPONDENT(S)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nHEMANT GUPTA, J.\n\n1) The challenge in the present appeal is to an order passed by the\n\nArmed Forces Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi 1 on March 9,\n\n2016 whereby, the Original Application filed by the appellant was\n\ndismissed and also an order of the same date declining leave to\n\nappeal to this Court under Section 31(1) of the Armed Forces\n\nTribunal Act, 20072.\n\n2) The appellant was commissioned in the Administrative Branch of\n\nthe Indian Air Force on December 11, 1981. He was promoted to\n\nthe rank of Air Commodore in the year 2011. He along with nine\n\nother officers were considered for promotion against five vacancies\n\nin the rank of Air Vice Marshal. The appellant could not be\n\npromoted though he was first in the merit list in view of the fact\n\n1 for short, ‘Tribunal’\n2 for short, ‘Act’\nthat he was placed at Sl. No. 3 in seniority in the select list of four\n\nofficers. The first officer on the select list was promoted to the\n\nrank of Air Vice Marshal on May 11, 2015 against the first available\n\nvacancy whereas, next two vacancies arose on August 1, 2015 and\n\nSeptember 1, 2015 i.e. after the appellant attained the age of\n\nsuperannuation on June 30, 2015. Since, there was no post\n\navailable for his promotion prior to his superannuation, he was not\n\npromoted to the rank of Air Vice Marshal.\n\n3) The appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the Tribunal claiming\n\npromotion to the rank of Air Vice Marshal selected by Promotion\n\nBoard in order of merit and not in the order of seniority challenging\n\nthe clause in the Promotion Policy dated February 20, 2008 that the\n\nmerit list prepared by the Board has to be rearranged in the order\n\nof seniority.\n\n4) The argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that\n\npromotion to the rank of Air Vice Marshal is on the principle of\n\n“merit-cum-seniority”. Therefore, seniority cannot be the guiding\n\nprinciple for promotion once the appellant was found to be\n\nmeritorious by the Promotion Board. In support of his argument,\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant relied upon judgment of this\n\nCourt in Ajit Singh & Ors. (II) v. State of Punjab & Ors.3 and\n\nalso to an order passed by this Court in Union of India & Anr. v.\n\nMajor General Manoj Luthra & Ors. 4 whereby, the order of the\n\n3 (1999) 7 SCC 209\n4 Civil Appeal No. 9390 of 2014 decided on September 29, 2015\nTribunal was affirmed while examining the policy for promotion to\n\nthe post of Major General in the Armed Forces Medical Services.\n\nThe argument is that similar policy is applicable for promotion to\n\nthe post of Air Vice Marshal, therefore, in view of the affirmance of\n\nthe judgment of the Tribunal by this Court, such policy cannot be\n\nrelied upon. The Tribunal in Major General Manoj Luthra, held\n\nas under:\n\n“12. …Once selection is made on the basis of merit and\nofficers are graded in the select list based on that merit\nfollowing the policy of seniority thereafter is contrary to\nthe provisions of\nArticle 14\nand\n16.\nWe are\nhandicapped on this issue as policy is not subject\nmatter of challenge. Admittedly, the petitioner is on\nmerit at S. No. 1 should have been permitted to pick up\nthe rank of Lt. Gen. But for this policy he is at S.No. 3\nof the list and he would pick up the rank of Lt. Gen. only\non 01.07.2014 which is the date when he would have\nretired. Therefore, he loses out his right of promotion\non account of faulty policy being followed…”\n\n5) The appeal against the said order was dismissed by this Court\n\nobserving that the policy is quite ambiguous but the cause of\n\njustice is best sub-served if the respondent is conferred with the\n\nrank of Lieutenant General w.e.f. May 1, 2014 but no arrears shall\n\nbe paid.\n\n6) On the other hand, the argument of learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents is that the promotion policy is not “merit-cum-\n\nseniority” as argued by the appellant but is a policy which\n\ncontemplates that merit list of officers is prepared from amongst\n\nthe candidates in the zone of consideration on the basis of total\nmarks obtained after adding AR Marks and Board Marks. The\n\nnames of the officers will be rearranged in order of seniority at the\n\nsecond stage of determining the suitability of the officers for\n\npromotion. The right of promotion is in terms of policy alone.\n\nTherefore, if the policy contemplates a particular procedure for\n\npromotion, the promotion can be effected only in such a manner\n\nand in no other manner. It is also argued that the appellant was\n\naware of the policy and has participated in the promotion process,\n\ntherefore, after participating in the selection process and after\n\nremaining unsuccessful, he is estopped to challenge the policy\n\nunder which his name was considered for promotion to the post of\n\nAir Vice Marshal.\n\n7) A consolidated Promotion Policy was circulated on February 20,\n\n2008 as the existing policy for promotion based upon “seniority-\n\ncum-fitness” was found to have resulted in the older age profile for\n\nthe officers being promoted to the higher ranks. The requirement\n\nwas felt to formalize the norms and introduce a merit-based\n\nsystem for promotion at senior levels. The norms and criteria for\n\npromotion to the rank of Air Marshal and No.1 Promotion Board for\n\npromotion of Air Commodore and Group Captains to the ranks of\n\nAir Vice Marshal and Air Commodore were fixed in such policy. The\n\nofficer who fulfils the qualifying service and is eligible in terms of\n\ncriteria framed, the merit list is prepared on the basis of AR Marks;\n\nBoard Marks and on the basis of numerical gradings of available\n\nAnnual Confidential Reports during last ten years. The Board\nMarks are the sum total of marks given by each member present in\n\nthe Board meeting on the scale of 05.\n\n8) The relevant clauses from the Policy dated February 20, 2008 read\n\nas under:\n\n“11. Zone of consideration. (a) Zone of consideration\nwill be 3 times the number of vacancies occurring.\nHowever, if Zone of Consideration extends to the next\ncourse then all officers who have retained their\nseniority from that course would be considered.\n\n(b) All the second and third timers will necessarily form\npart of zone of consideration, irrespective of the\nnumber of vacancies.\n\n(c) In cases where available offices in any branch from\nwhich promotions are to be made is less than the\nstipulate zone consideration of 3 times, the actual\nnumber of officers available will form the zone of\nconsideration.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n13. Eligibility. An officer should have at least one\nappraisal report in the rank held by him at the time of\nhis consideration for promotion.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n15. Qualifying Service. The minimum qualifying service\nin the rank, for promotion to the ranks of Air Marshal,\nAVMs and Air Cmdes as on 31 March of the year\npreceding the promotion year for which Board is\nconducted, will be as follows:-\n\n(a) AVM 1 year\n(b) Air Cmde 1 year\n(c) Gp Capt 2 years\n\nExceptions in qualifying service may be made due to\nany service reasons. Such exceptions will be required\nto be authorized by the CAS.\n\n16. Preparation of Merit List. Merit list will be prepared\non the basis of ‘AR Marks’ and ‘Board Marks’ with\nweightage of 95.05 respectively. In the case of\npromotion to the rank of Air Marshal average of\nnumerical gradings of the available ARs during last five\nyears will be taken into account to determine the AR\nmarks. For promotion to the ranks of Air Cmde and\nAVMs, average of numerical gradings of available ARs\nduring last ten years will be taken into consideration.\n\n‘Board Marks’ will be sum total of marks given by each\nmember present in the Board meeting on the scale of\n05….”\n\n17. Overall Merit. A merit list of officers considered by\nthe Board will be prepared on the basis of total marks\nobtained in AR Marks and Board Marks. An illustration\nto demonstrate the actual computation of an officer’s\nmarks is placed as Annexure-I to this paper.\n\nA Select List of the officers will be prepared from the\nMerit List. The Select List will contain the names of the\nofficer restricted to the number of forecast vacancies\nand rearranged in the order of seniority. The officers\nfrom the list will be promoted in that order.\n\nIn case of any additional vacancy/vacancies\n(unforeseen or ex-cadre) arising during the promotion\nyear, these should be added to the forecast vacancies\nfor the next promotion year and the Promotion Board\nfor the next promotion year should be appropriately\nadvanced. The zone of consideration will be as\nprovided in para 11 above. Therefore, there will be no\n“Select Reserve List”.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n22. The recommendations of the Promotion Boards will\nbe forwarded to Min of Defence for their approval. The\npromotions will take effect from the Select List in the\norder of seniority against a suitable vacancy arising in\nturn.\n\n23. Actual promotion will be subject to the officer’s\nmaintaining continuity in performance, medical fitness\nand availability of a suitable vacancy in his turn.”\n\n9) The validity of such Policy has been upheld by the Tribunal relying\n\nupon Division Bench judgment of High Court of Delhi in\nAir Cmde\nRandhir Pratap v. Union of India & Ors.5\n.\n\nThe Tribunal relied\n\nupon\nHardev Singh v. Union of India & Anr.6\nto hold that no\n\nemployee has a right to get promotion but only a right to be\n\nconsidered for promotion. The Tribunal found that the Promotion\n\nPolicy is based on the principle of “seniority-cum-merit” and not\n\n“merit-cum-seniority” as the ultimate promotions are based on\n\nseniority. This Court in Hardev Singh held as under:-\n\n“25. In our opinion, it is always open to an employer to\nchange its policy in relation to giving promotion to the\nemployees. This Court would normally not interfere in\nsuch policy decisions. We would like to quote the\ndecision of this Court in\nVirender S. Hooda v. State of\nHaryana\n[(1999) 3 SCC 696 : 1999 SCC (L&S) 824]\nwhere this Court had held in para 4 of the judgment\nthat: (SCC p. 699)\n“4. … When a policy has been declared by the\nState as to the manner of filling up the post and\nthat policy is declared in terms of rules and\ninstructions issued to the Public Service\nCommission from time to time and so long as\nthese instructions are not contrary to the rules,\nthe respondents ought to follow the same.”\n\n26. Similarly, in Balco Employees' Union v. Union of In-\n\ndia [(2002) 2 SCC 333] it has been held that a court\ncannot strike down a policy decision taken by the Gov-\nernment merely because it feels that another policy\nwould have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or\nlogical. It is not within the domain of the court to weigh\nthe pros and cons of the policy or to test the degree of\nits beneficial or equitable disposition.\n\n27. For the aforestated reasons, we are of the view that\nno injustice had been caused to the appellant as his\ncase was duly considered for promotion to the rank of\nLieutenant-General by the SSB twice but as other offi-\ncers were found better than the appellant, he could not\nbe promoted. In the circumstances, we do not find any\nsubstance in the appeal and, therefore, the appeal de-\nserves to be dismissed.”\n\n5 Writ Petition (C) No. 18935 of 2006 decided on August 24, 2007\n6 (2011) 10 SCC 121\n10) The Policy dated February 20, 2008 does not use the expression\n\nthat the promotion is based either on the principle of “merit-cum-\n\nseniority” or “seniority-cum-merit”. Therefore, the entire policy is\n\nrequired to be examined as to what is the criteria for promotion\n\nrather than using the expression either “merit-cum-seniority” or\n\n“seniority-cum-merit”. Therefore, the first and the foremost\n\nquestion is as to whether the promotion to the rank of Air Vice\n\nMarshal is based upon the general principle of “merit-cum-\n\nseniority” or “seniority-cum-merit” or that the promotions are to be\n\nmade on the basis of the eligibility criteria, procedure and on the\n\nbasis of seniority after determining merit of the candidates falling\n\nin the zone of consideration.\n\n11) The Army Order circulating Promotion Policy on February 20, 2008\n\nis statutory in nature. The appellant has challenged such policy\n\ninter alia on the ground that the policy is based upon “merit-cum-\n\nseniority” but the condition in the policy promoting the officers on\n\nthe basis of seniority after short listing the officers is contrary to\n\nthe principles of promotion based on “merit-cum-seniority”.\n\nTherefore, clause 17 of the Promotion Policy is contrary to\n\nestablished principles of law pertaining to promotion on the basis\n\nof “merit-cum-seniority” and, thus, not sustainable.\n\n12) A three Judge Bench of this Court in\nB.V. Sivaiah & Ors. v. K.\nAddanki Babu & Ors.7\nwhile examining the principle seniority-\n\ncum-merit held as under:\n\n“10. On the other hand, as between the two principles\nof seniority and merit, the criterion of “seniority-cum-\nmerit” lays greater emphasis on seniority.\nIn\nState of\nMysore v. Syed Mahmood\n[AIR 1968 SC 1113 : (1968) 3\nSCR 363 : (1970) 1 LLJ 370] while considering Rule 4(3)\n\n(b) of the Mysore State Civil Services General\nRecruitment Rules, 1957 which required promotion to\nbe made by selection on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit, this Court has observed that the Rule required\npromotion to be made by selection on the basis of\n“seniority subject to the fitness of the candidate to\ndischarge the duties of the post from among persons\neligible for promotion”. It was pointed out that where\nthe promotion is based on seniority-cum-merit, the\nofficer cannot claim promotion as a matter of right by\nvirtue of his seniority alone and if he is found unfit to\ndischarge the duties of the higher post, he may be\npassed over and an officer junior to him may be\npromoted.”\n\n13) In State of Mysore & Anr. v. G.B. Purohit & Ors.8, this Court\n\nheld that a right to be considered for promotion, is a condition of\n\nservice but mere chances of promotion are not. The rule which\n\nmerely affects the chances of promotion cannot be regarded as\n\nvarying a condition of service.\nThe said judgment was quoted\n\nwith approval in later judgment reported as\nRamchandra\n\nShankar Deodhar & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.9\n,\n\nwherein this Court held as under:\n\n“15…..All that happened as a result of making\npromotions to the posts of Deputy Collectors division\nwise and limiting such promotions to 50 per cent of the\ntotal number of vacancies in the posts of Deputy\nCollector was to reduce the chances of promotion\navailable to the petitioners. It is now well settled by the\n\n7 (1998) 6 SCC 720\n8 (1967) SLR 753\n9 (1974) 1 SCC 317\ndecision of this Court in State of Mysore v. G.B.\nPurohit [CA No. 2281 of 1965, decided on January 25,\n1967] that though a right to be considered for\npromotion is a condition of service, mere chances of\npromotion are not. A rule which merely affects chances\nof promotion cannot be regarded as varying a condition\nof service. In Purohit’s case the district wise seniority of\nsanitary inspectors was changed to State wise seniority,\nand as a result of this change the respondents went\ndown in seniority and became very junior. This, it was\nurged, affected their chances of promotion which were\nprotected under the proviso to Section 115, sub-section\n(7). This contention was negatived and Wanchoo, J. (as\nhe then was), speaking on behalf of this Court\nobserved: “It is said on behalf of the respondents that\nas their chances of promotion have been affected their\nconditions of service have been changed to their\ndisadvantage. We see no force in this argument\nbecause chances of promotion are not conditions of\nservice…..”\n\n14) In\nDwarka Prasad & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.10\n, the\n\nargument examined was that the promotion opportunities have to\n\nbe provided in ratio with the strength of the feeder cadre. It was\n\nheld as under:\n\n“16. Fixation of quotas or different avenues and ladders\nfor promotion in favour of various categories of posts in\nfeeder cadres based upon the structure and pattern of\nthe Department is a prerogative of the employer,\nmainly pertaining to the policy-making field. The\nrelevant considerations in fixing a particular quota for a\nparticular post are various such as the cadre strength in\nthe feeder quota, suitability more or less of the holders\nin the feeder post, their nature of duties, experience\nand the channels of promotion available to the holders\nof posts in the feeder cadres. Most important of them all\nis the requirement of the promoting authority for\nmanning the post on promotion with suitable\ncandidates. Thus, fixation of quota for various\ncategories of posts in the feeder cadres requires\nconsideration of various relevant factors, a few amongst\nthem have been mentioned for illustration. Mere cadre\nstrength of a particular post in the feeder cadre cannot\n\n10 (2003) 6 SCC 535\nbe a sole criterion or basis to claim parity in the\nchances of promotion by various holders of posts in\nfeeder categories.”\n\n15) In\nA. Satyanarayana & Ors. v. S. Purushotham & Ors.11\n, this\n\nCourt held that the power of the State to fix quota for promotion\n\ncannot be said to be violative of the Constitutional Scheme of\n\nequality as contemplated under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. The Court held as under:\n\n“23. We, however, are of the opinion that the validity or\notherwise of a quota rule cannot be determined on\nsurmises and conjectures. Whereas the power of the\nState to fix the quota keeping in view the fact situation\nobtaining in a given case must be conceded, the same,\nhowever, cannot be violative of the constitutional\nscheme of equality as contemplated under\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution of India. There cannot be any\ndoubt whatsoever that a policy decision and, in\nparticular, legislative policy should not ordinarily be\ninterfered with and the superior courts, while exercising\ntheir power of judicial review, shall not consider as to\nwhether such policy decision has been taken mala fide\nor not. But where a policy decision as reflected in a\nstatutory rule pertains to the field of subordinate\nlegislation, indisputably, the same would be amenable\nto judicial review, inter alia, on the ground of being\nviolative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n(See\nVasu Dev Singh v. Union of India\n[(2006) 12 SCC\n753 : (\n2006) 11 Scale 108] and State of\nKerala v. Unni\n[(2007) 2 SCC 365] .)\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n25. While saying so, we are not unmindful of the legal\nprinciple that nobody has a right to be promoted; his\nright being confined to right to be considered therefor.\n\n26. Similarly, the power of the State to take a policy\ndecision as a result whereof an employee's chance of\npromotion is diminished cannot be a subject-matter of\njudicial review as no legal right is infringed thereby.”\n\n11 (2008) 5 SCC 416\n16) In\nA.P. Public Service Commission v. Baloji Badhavath &\n\nOrs.12\n, this Court held that the Court will not ordinarily interfere\n\nwith the process of determining merit unless the procedure\n\nadopted by it is held to be arbitrary or against known-principles of\n\nfair play. The Court held as under:\n\n“25. How the Commission would judge the merit of\nthe candidates is its function. Unless the procedure\nadopted by it is held to be arbitrary or against the\nknown principles of fair play, the superior courts\nwould not ordinarily interfere therewith. The State\nframed Rules in the light of the decision of the High\nCourt in S. Jaffer Saheb [(1985) 2 APLJ 380]. Per se,\nit did not commit any illegality. The correctness of\n\nthe said decision\n, as noticed hereinbefore, is not in\nquestion having attained finality. The matter,\nhowever, would be different if the said Rules per se\nare found to be violative of\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution of India. Nobody has any fundamental\nright to be appointed in terms of\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution of India. It merely provides for a right\nto be considered therefor. A procedure evolved for\nlaying down the mode and manner for consideration\nof such a right can be interfered with only when it is\narbitrary, discriminatory or wholly unfair.”\n\n17) In\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava & Ors. v. Samyut Kshetriya\n\nGramin Bank & Ors.13\n, this Court was examining two-stage\n\nprocess adopted by Bank - the first preparing list of candidates\n\nwho secure minimum marks in the performance appraisal and\n\ninterview, and the second promoting the candidates who secure\n\nthe minimum marks, strictly on the basis of seniority. It was held\n\nthat such is seniority-cum-merit criteria for promotion. The Court\n\nheld as under:\n\n12 (2009) 5 SCC 1\n13 (2010) 1 SCC 335\n“13. Thus, it is clear that a process whereby eligible\ncandidates possessing the minimum necessary merit in\nthe feeder posts is first ascertained and thereafter,\npromotions are made strictly in accordance with\nseniority, from among those who possess the minimum\nnecessary merit is recognised and accepted as\ncomplying with the principle of “seniority-cum-merit”.\nWhat would offend the rule of seniority-cum-merit is a\nprocess where after assessing the minimum necessary\nmerit, promotions are made on the basis of merit\n(instead of seniority) from among the candidates\npossessing the minimum necessary merit. If the criteria\nadopted for assessment of minimum necessary merit is\nbona fide and not unreasonable, it is not open to\nchallenge, as being opposed to the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit. We accordingly hold that\nprescribing minimum qualifying marks to ascertain the\nminimum merit necessary for discharging the functions\nof the higher post, is not violative of the concept of\npromotion by seniority-cum-merit.”\n\n18) In view of the principles governing the right of promotion as\n\ndelineated above, we find that the grievance of the appellant is in\n\nrespect of lost chances of promotion inasmuch as he attained the\n\nage of superannuation before the vacancy arose. Clauses 17 and\n\n22 are categorical that the select list of officers will be prepared\n\nfrom merit list and rearranged in order of seniority. Thus, the final\n\nlist of the candidates falling within the zone of consideration in\n\nterms of clause 11 and who are eligible in terms of clause 13 is\n\ndetermined first by preparing the merit list on the basis of AR\n\nmarks and Board marks. Thereafter, the names of the officers\n\nfound meritorious are to be rearranged in order of seniority as per\n\nclauses 17 and 22 of the Promotion Policy. Thus, it ensures that\n\nthe candidates falling within the zone of consideration are short\n\nlisted for promotion but ultimate promotion from amongst the\nselected candidates is on the basis of seniority. Such policy per se\n\ncannot be said to be illegal, arbitrary and discriminatory so as to\n\nattract the violation of either\nArticle 14\nor\nArticle 16\nof the\n\nConstitution.\n\n19) In Ajit Singh, referred to by learned counsel for the appellant, the\n\nCourt held that equal opportunity contemplated by\nArticle 14\nof\n\nthe Constitution means the right to be considered for promotion.\n\nIf a person satisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but is not\n\nconsidered for promotion, then there will be a clear infraction of\n\nhis fundamental right to be considered for his promotion, which is\n\nhis personal right. The rules and the considerations contemplated\n\npromotion by “seniority-cum-merit” particularly in the light of\n\nreserved category candidates promoted at the roster points. It\n\nwas held that in terms of\nArticle 16\n, every employee eligible for\n\npromotion or who comes within the zone of consideration, has a\n\nfundamental right to be considered for promotion but his right is\n\nof consideration alone. The Court held as under:\n\n“22. … It has been held repeatedly by this Court that\nclause (1) of\nArticle 16\nis a facet of\nArticle 14\nand that it\ntakes its roots from\nArticle 14.\nThe said clause\nparticularises the generality in\nArticle 14\nand identifies,\nin a constitutional sense “equality of opportunity” in\nmatters of employment and appointment to any office\nunder the State. The word “employment” being wider,\nthere is no dispute that it takes within its fold, the\naspect of promotions to posts above the stage of initial\nlevel of recruitment.\nArticle 16(1)\nprovides to every\nemployee otherwise eligible for promotion or who\ncomes within the zone of consideration, a fundamental\nright to be “considered” for promotion. Equal\nopportunity here means the right to be “considered” for\npromotion. If a person satisfies the eligibility and zone\ncriteria but is not considered for promotion, then there\nwill be a clear infraction of his fundamental right to be\n“considered” for promotion, which is his personal\nright….”\n\nxx xx xx\n\n27. In our opinion, the above view expressed in Ashok\nKumar Gupta [(1997) 5 SCC 201 : 1997 SCC (L&S)\n1299] and followed in Jagdish Lal [(1997) 6 SCC 538 :\n\n1997 SCC (L&S) 1550] and other cases, if it is intended\nto lay down that the right guaranteed to employees for\nbeing “considered” for promotion according to relevant\nrules of recruitment by promotion (i.e. whether on the\nbasis of seniority or merit) is only a statutory right and\nnot a fundamental right, we cannot accept the\nproposition. We have already stated earlier that the\nright to equal opportunity in the matter of promotion in\nthe sense of a right to be “considered” for promotion is\nindeed a fundamental right guaranteed under\nArticle\n16(1)\nand this has never been doubted in any other\ncase before Ashok Kumar Gupta [(1997) 5 SCC 201 :\n1997 SCC (L&S) 1299] right from 1950.”\n\n20) In Major General Manoj Luthra, the Promotion Policy has not\n\nbeen struck down by this Court but in the facts of that case, in view\n\nof superannuation of the officer, the benefit was ordered to be\n\nconferred to the respondent. Such is not a binding precedent as\n\nthe merit of the policy has not been examined.\n\n21) The promotion to the post of Air Vice Marshal is regulated by\n\nCircular dated February 20, 2008, therefore, the promotion can be\n\nclaimed only in terms of eligibility and the norms fixed therein.\n\nMere fact that the appellant could not be promoted on account of\n\nnon-availability of vacancies before his superannuation is not a\n\nground on which the Promotion Policy can be struck down. The\nPromotion Policy can be struck down only if the policy has no\n\nreasonable nexus with the objective to be achieved and is\n\ndiscriminatory. The lack of vacancy is not a ground on the basis of\n\nwhich promotion policy can be struck down. Since the Promotion\n\nPolicy is in two stages as in Rajendra Kumar Srivastava i.e. to\n\nshortlist the candidates on the basis of eligibility criteria and on the\n\nbasis of the marks obtained in the Annual Confidential Report and\n\nthe marks given by the Board, therefore, the applicability of\n\nprinciple of seniority cannot be said to be arbitrary or irrational\n\nwhich may make the policy illegal and unsustainable.\n\n22) The promotion has to be affected in terms of statutory rules and in\n\nabsence thereof, as per the executive instructions. The policy\n\nprovides equal opportunities to the officers falling within the zone\n\nof consideration and subsequent promotion. Such policy is not\n\ndiscriminatory in terms of\nArticle 14\nor denies lack of equal\n\nopportunity in terms of\nArticle 16.\nThe promotion to the post of Air\n\nVice Marshal is governed by the policy of Air Force which is\n\napplicable to all officers falling in the zone of consideration.\n\nTherefore, the Promotion Policy cannot be said to be illegal,\n\narbitrary and irrational warranting interference in exercise of power\n\nof judicial review.\n\n23) Apart from the policy, we also find that the appellant is estopped to\n\nchallenge the policy after participating in the selection process on\n\nthe basis of such policy. It has been so held by this Court in\nMadan Lal & Ors. v. State of J & K & Ors.14\n:\n\n“10. Therefore, the result of the interview test on\nmerits cannot be successfully challenged by a\ncandidate who takes a chance to get selected at the\nsaid interview and who ultimately finds himself to be\nunsuccessful. It is also to be kept in view that in this\npetition we cannot sit as a court of appeal and try to\nreassess the relative merits of the candidates\nconcerned who had been assessed at the oral interview\nnor can the petitioners successfully urge before us that\nthey were given less marks though their performance\nwas better. It is for the Interview Committee which\namongst others consisted of a sitting High Court Judge\nto judge the relative merits of the candidates who were\norally interviewed, in the light of the guidelines\nlaid\ndown by\nthe relevant rules governing such interviews.\nTherefore, the assessment on merits as made by such\nan expert committee cannot be brought in challenge\nonly on the ground that the assessment was not proper\nor justified as that would be the function of an appellate\nbody and we are certainly not acting as a court of\nappeal over the assessment made by such an expert\ncommittee.”\n\n24) In a judgment reported as\nAshok Kumar v. State of Bihar15\n, a\n\nthree Judge Bench held that the appellants were estopped from\n\nturning around and challenging the selection once they were\n\ndeclared unsuccessful. The Court held as under:-\n\n“17.\nIn\nRamesh Chandra Shah v. Anil Joshi [Ramesh\nChandra Shah\nv. Anil Joshi, (2013) 11 SCC 309 : (2011)\n3 SCC (L&S) 129] , candidates who were competing for\nthe post of Physiotherapist in the State of Uttarakhand\nparticipated in a written examination held in pursuance\nof an advertisement. This Court held that if they had\ncleared the test, the respondents would not have raised\nany objection to the selection process or to the method-\n\nology adopted. Having taken a chance of selection, it\nwas held that the respondents were disentitled to seek\nrelief under\nArticle 226\nand would be deemed to have\nwaived their right to challenge the advertisement or the\nprocedure of selection. This Court held that: (SCC p.\n318, para 18)\n\n14 (1995) 3 SCC 486\n15 (2017) 4 SCC 357\n“18. It is settled law that a person who\nconsciously takes part in the process of selection\ncannot, thereafter, turn around and question the\nmethod of selection and its outcome.”\n\n18. In Chandigarh Admn. v. Jasmine Kaur [Chandigarh\nAdmn. v. Jasmine Kaur, (2014) 10 SCC 521 : 6 SCEC\n745] , it was held that a candidate who takes a\ncalculated risk or chance by subjecting himself or\nherself to the selection process cannot turn around and\ncomplain that the process of selection was unfair after\nknowing of his or her non-selection.\nIn\nPradeep Kumar\nRai v. Dinesh Kumar Pandey [Pradeep Kumar\nRai\nv. Dinesh Kumar Pandey, (2015) 11 SCC 493 :\n\n(2015) 3 SCC (L&S) 274], this Court held that: (SCC p.\n\n500, para 17)\n\n“17. Moreover, we would concur with the Division\nBench on one more point that the appellants had\nparticipated in the process of interview and not\nchallenged it till the results were declared. There\nwas a gap of almost four months between the\ninterview and declaration of result. However, the\nappellants did not challenge it at that time. This,\nit appears that only when the appellants found\nthemselves to be unsuccessful, they challenged\nthe interview. This cannot be allowed. The\ncandidates cannot approbate and reprobate at\nthe same time. Either the candidates should not\nhave participated in the interview and challenged\nthe procedure or they should have challenged\nimmediately after the interviews were\nconducted.”\n\nThis principle has been reiterated in a recent judgment\nin Madras Institute of Development Studies v. K.\nSivasubramaniyan [Madras Institute of Development\nStudies v. K. Sivasubramaniyan, (2016) 1 SCC 454 :\n\n(2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 164 : 7 SCEC 462] .\n\n19. In the present case, regard must be had to the fact\nthat the appellants were clearly on notice, when the\nfresh selection process took place that written\nexamination would carry ninety marks and the\ninterview, ten marks. The appellants participated in the\nselection process. Moreover, two other considerations\nweigh in balance. The High Court noted in the\nimpugned judgment [\nAnurag Verma v. State of Bihar\n,\n2011 SCC OnLine Pat 1289.] that the interpretation of\nRule 6 was not free from vagueness. There was, in other\nwords, no glaring or patent illegality in the process\nadopted by the High Court. There was an element of\nvagueness about whether Rule 6 which dealt with\npromotion merely incorporated the requirement of an\nexamination provided in Rule 5 for direct recruitment to\nClass III posts or whether the marks and qualifying\nmarks were also incorporated. Moreover, no prejudice\nwas established to have been caused to the appellants\nby the 90:10 allocation.”\n\n25) In view thereof, we do not find that the policy circulated on\n\nFebruary 20, 2008 suffers from any illegality which was rightly not\n\ninterfered with by the learned Tribunal. Thus, the appeal is\n\ndismissed.\n\n.............................................J.\n(L.

HE WAS PROMOTED TO  THE RANK OF AIR COMMODORE IN THE YEAR 2011. HE ALONG WITH NINE  OTHER OFFICERS WERE CONSIDERED FOR PROMOTION AGAINST FIVE VACANCIES  IN THE RANK OF AIR VICE MARSHAL. THE APPELLANT COULD NOT BE  PROMOTED THOUGH HE WAS FIRST IN THE MERIT LIST IN VIEW OF THE FACT  1 FOR SHORT, ‘TRIBUNAL’ 2 FOR SHORT, ‘ACT’ THAT HE WAS PLACED AT SL. NO. 3 IN SENIORITY IN THE SELECT LIST OF FOUR  OFFICERS. THE FIRST OFFICER ON THE SELECT LIST WAS PROMOTED TO THE  RANK OF AIR VICE MARSHAL ON MAY 11, 2015 AGAINST THE FIRST AVAILABLE  VACANCY WHEREAS, NEXT TWO VACANCIES AROSE ON AUGUST 1, 2015 AND  SEPTEMBER 1, 2015 I.E. AFTER THE APPELLANT ATTAINED THE AGE OF  SUPERANNUATION ON JUNE 30, 2015. SINCE, THERE WAS NO POST  AVAILABLE FOR HIS PROMOTION PRIOR TO HIS SUPERANNUATION, HE WAS NOT  PROMOTED TO THE RANK OF AIR VICE MARSHAL.  3) THE APPELLANT INVOKED THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL CLAIMING  PROMOTION TO THE RANK OF AIR VICE MARSHAL SELECTED BY PROMOTION  BOARD IN ORDER OF MERIT AND NOT IN THE ORDER OF SENIORITY CHALLENGING  THE CLAUSE IN THE PROMOTION POLICY DATED FEBRUARY 20, 2008 THAT THE  MERIT LIST PREPARED BY THE BOARD HAS TO BE REARRANGED IN THE ORDER  OF SENIORITY.  4) THE ARGUMENT OF LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT IS THAT  PROMOTION TO THE RANK OF AIR VICE MARSHAL IS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF  “MERIT-CUM-SENIORITY”. THEREFORE, SENIORITY CANNOT BE THE GUIDING  PRINCIPLE FOR PROMOTION ONCE THE APPELLANT WAS FOUND TO BE  MERITORIOUS BY THE PROMOTION BOARD. IN SUPPORT OF HIS ARGUMENT,  LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT RELIED UPON JUDGMENT OF THIS  COURT IN AJIT SINGH & ORS. (II) V. STATE OF PUNJAB & ORS.3 AND"
