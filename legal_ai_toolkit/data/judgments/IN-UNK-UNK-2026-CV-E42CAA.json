Dattu\n\n NON-REPORTABLE\n\n IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n CIVIL APPEAL NO.1793 OF 2009\n (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 22469 of 2007)\n\nPunjab State Electricity Board & Ors. ..........Appellants\n\n Versus\n\nJit Singh ........Respondent\n\n ORDER\n\n Leave granted.\n\n2) Punjab State Electricity Board (`Board' in short) is before us in\n\n this appeal, inter alia calling in question the correctness or\n\n otherwise of the judgment and order passed by the High Court of\n\n Punjab and Haryana in Writ Petition No. 7326 of 2005 dated\n\n 12.7.2007.\n\n3) The facts in nutshell are, the respondent was appointed as security\n\n guard on ad hoc basis on 27.01.1976 and his services were\n\n regularized with effect from 9.8.1978. He retired from service on\n\n 1\n\n\f attaining the age of superannuation on 31.7.2000. On his\n\n retirement, the respondent has received all the pensionary benefits.\n\n4) The Board has issued a circular dated 23.01.2001, giving certain\n\n benefit of \"ad hoc service\" to Board employees. In short, in the\n\n circular, it is stated, that, the period of ad hoc service would be\n\n counted towards retirement benefit on regularization, provided the\n\n employees fulfil certain conditions. A clarification is also issued\n\n by the Board, by Memo No. 41614/659 dated 14.2.2001, clarifying\n\n the circular dated 23.1.2001.\n\n5) To take benefit of the circular issued by the Board, the respondent\n\n had made a request to the Board to count his ad hoc service in the\n\n Board before regularization of his service for the purpose of\n\n calculating the pensionary benefits. The said claim is rejected by\n\n the Board vide its order dated 5.10.2004. This issue was agitated\n\n by the respondent by filing a Writ Petition before the High Court\n\n of Punjab and Haryana. The court has granted relief to the\n\n respondent. The findings and the conclusions reached therein is\n\n the subject matter of this civil appeal.\n\n6) The learned counsel for the Board would contend, that, the High\n\n Court was not correct in relying on the full bench decision of the\n\n 2\n\n\fPunjab and Haryana High Court in the case of \nKesar Chand vs.\n\nState of Punjab & Others\n; [AIR, 1988 Punjab and Haryana, 265],\n\nsince in that decision the court was concerned with the issue, the\n\neffect of regularization of service of work charge employee for the\n\npurpose of pensionary benefits which are available to the other\n\npublic servants. It is further contended, that, the Circular/Memo\n\ndated 23.1.2001 and subsequent Circular/Memo dated 14.2.2001\n\nare only prospective and the benefit cannot be granted to such of\n\nthose employees who have retired from service prior to the\n\nissuance of Circular/Memo dated 23.1.2001 and clarificatory\n\nMemo dated 14.2.2001. It is further contended that the reliance\n\nplaced by the respondent on Clause 7 of the Finance Circular No.\n\n73/89 issued by the Board is misplaced, since that circular was\n\nmade applicable to work-charge employees only. It is also\n\ncontended, that, since the respondent has not questioned the\n\nvalidity or otherwise of the Circular/Memo dated 23.1.2001 and\n\n14.2.2001, he cannot take the benefit of those circulars, since they\n\nare prospective and issued after respondent retired from service on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation.\n\n 3\n\n \n7) The learned counsel for the respondent-employee would contend\n\n that there is no essential difference between a `work charge\n\n employee' and an employee appointed on ad hoc basis and,\n\n therefore, the High Court was justified in relying on the full bench\n\n decision of Punjab and Haryana High Court in \nKesar Chand\n's case\n\n and directing the Board to reconsider the case of the respondent in\n\n the light of \nthe said decision\n.\n\n8) The issue that requires our consideration and decision is, whether\n\n the High Court was justified in relying on the decision of \nKesar\n\n Chand\n's case to annul the order passed by the Board dated\n\n 5.10.2004 and secondly, whether the ad hoc service of an\n\n employee of the Board before regularization of his service requires\n\n to be counted while calculating the pensionary benefits of the\n\n respondent.\n\n9) To resolve the controversy, we require to notice Memo/Circulars\n\n issued by the Board dated 23.1.2001 and 14.2.2001. They are :-\n\n (a) \"Memo No. 21064/21114/ENG-27(44)LCL 75\n\n Dated 23.1.2001\n\n Subject: COUNTING OF ADHOC SERVICE FOR\n PENSIONARY BENEFITS ONLY\n\n The matter regarding benefit of Adhoc Service has been\n under the active consideration of the Board for some time past, the\n\n 4\n\n\f Board in its 11/2000 meeting held on 29.12.2000 has decided that\n entire adhoc service rendered by the Board employees, shall\n regularization, provided the employees fulfill the following\n conditions:-\n\n1) Who fulfilled the condition of minimum prescribed\n qualifications and experience, if any, for the past at the time of\n appointment and were recruited by following proper procedure were\n continuing un-interruptedly till date of regularization.\n\n ii) Who fulfilled condition of minimum qualification and\n experience at the time of recruitment but were not recruited\n by following proper procedure and continued in service\n without any interruption.\n\n iii) This benefit will not be admissible to those who do not\n fulfill either of the above two conditions. It was\n specifically decided that this benefit shall not be given to\n those employees who have either been retired or retired\n from the service of the Board.\"\n\n (b) Memo No. 41614/659 ENG-27(44)LCL 75\n Dated : 14.2.2001\n\n SUBJECT : COUNTING OF ADHOC SERVICE\n FOR PENSIONARY BENEFITS ONLY\n\n Part 2 of this office memo No. 21064/21114/ENG-27 (44) LC-75\n dated 23.1.2000 vide which instructions were issued on the subject\n cited is amended and may be substituted as under :-\n\n2) This benefit shall also not be given to these employees who have\n either retired on attaining the age of superannuation/compulsory\n retired/taken premature retirement or resigned from the service of the\n Board.\"\n\n 5\n\n\f10) In our view, before we advert to the issues canvassed, it would be\n\n useful to extract the decision of the Board on the claim made by\n\n the respondent. It is as under :-\n\n \"Memo No. 12958/SGE-740\n Dated: 5.10.04\n Subject: In response to the legal notice given under \nSection 80\n\n CPC by Shri Jit Singh, ASI, retired, on 31.7.2000.\n\n In response to the above, it is being intimated to you that as per\n the instructions of Board, you are not entitled to the benefit of ad\n hoc service for pensionary benefits.\"\n\n11) The facts which are not disputed and which cannot be disputed\n\n also are, that, the respondent was appointed as a security guard on\n\n ad hoc basis on 27.1.1976 and his services were regularized as\n\n security guard with effect from 9.8.1978. The respondent retired\n\n from service on attaining the age of superannuation on 31.7.2000.\n\n The Board has issued a circular dated 23.1.2001 for the purpose of\n\n counting of ad hoc service rendered by the Board employees for\n\n the purpose of quantifying the pensionary benefits after their\n\n services are regularized in the Board, if they satisfies the\n\n conditions envisaged in the circular. By yet another\n\n Circular/Memo dated 14.2.2001 the Board has clarified its earlier\n\n circular that the benefit of the circular dated 23.1.2000 shall not be\n\n 6\n\n\f given to those employees who have either retired on attaining the\n\n age of superannuation/compulsorily retired/take premature\n\n retirement or resigned from the service of the Board before\n\n issuance of the Board's circular dated 23.1.2000. That only means\n\n the circulars are given prospective effect. The respondent in the\n\n writ petition filed does not question the validity or otherwise of\n\n the circular issued on the ground that they are violative of any\n\n Constitutional provisions, including \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution\n\n of India. It is not even the case of the respondent that the circulars\n\n issued by the Board is arbitrary, since it treats employees retired\n\n from service prior to and after issuance of the circular of the\n\n Board. Therefore, it may not be proper for us to take up an issue\n\n which is not pleaded or urged either before this Court or before the\n\n High Court by the respondent-employee of the Board.\n\n12) A retired employee of the Board being of the view that he is\n\n entitled for the benefit of the Circulars issued by the Board dated\n\n 23.01.2001 and 14.02.2001, has approached the Board to count his\n\n service when he worked as adhoc employee till the date of\n\n regularization of his service for the purpose of calculating his\n\n pensionary benefits. This request is rejected by the Board by its\n\n 7\n\n\f cryptic and non-speaking order. The order so made was the\n\n subject matter of the writ petition. The court following the\n\n decision in \nKesar Chand\n's case (supra) has allowed the petition on\n\n the ground that in \nthe said decision\n, it has been held \"that once\n\n service of work charge employee is regularized, there is no logic\n\n to deprive him of the pensionary benefits available to other public\n\n servants. Even the temporary or officiating service of the\n\n government has to be reckoned in determining the qualifying\n\n service.\"\n\n13) In \nKesar Chand\n's case, the facts were, the employee had joined as\n\n Beldar on August 1, 1951 as a work charge employee in the office\n\n of the Sub-Divisional Officer, Pathankot. He had regular service\n\n without any break till the date of retirement from service on\n\n attaining the age of superannuation. While claiming pensionary\n\n benefits at least from the date, he is deemed to have been\n\n regularized in service, he had relied on the award passed by the\n\n Industrial Tribunal, and further had questioned the vires of Rule\n\n 3.12 and Rule 1.2 of the Punjab Civil Services Rules, which had\n\n been relied on by the respondents to deprive the pensionary\n\n benefits. It was his further case that he was a government servant\n\n 8\n\n\f and was paid from the government revenue and, therefore, could\n\n not be excluded from the purview of Punjab Civil Services Rules\n\n in relation to pension. In the back drop of the aforesaid fact\n\n scenario, the Punjab and Haryana High Court granted relief to the\n\n work charge employee, who had put in continuous service till the\n\n date of retirement on attaining the age of superannuation.\n\n14) In the instant case, the facts are not identical. The respondent is an\n\n employee of Punjab State Electricity Board and not an employee\n\n of the State Government. He is not claiming any benefit under\n\n Punjab Civil Services Rules, but claiming benefit in view of the\n\n circulars issued by the Board. He has not even questioned the\n\n vires of the circular issued by the Board, wherein a cut off date is\n\n prescribed by limiting to those ad hoc employees who are still in\n\n service and whose services have been regularized etc. Therefore,\n\n in our opinion, the High Court by placing reliance on a decision\n\n which does not have any bearing on the fact situation pleaded by\n\n the petitioner ought not to have observed that the principles\n\n enunciated in \nKesar Chand\n's case will apply to the case of the\n\n respondent and, therefore, authorities of the Board should\n\n reconsider the claim of the respondent-employee in the light of the\n\n 9\n\n\f principles enunciated in the said case. Therefore, we cannot\n\n sustain this portion of the order passed by the High Court.\n\n15) Now, we come to the order passed by the Board dated 5.10.2004.\n\n In our view, it is suffice to state, that, the order is a non-speaking\n\n order in the sense, it does not contain any reasons much less\n\n cogent reason so fair play requires recording precise and cogent\n\n reasons when an order affects the right of citizen. In the impugned\n\n order, we do not see any reason in the order passed by the\n\n authorities of the Board. Therefore, in our view, the High Court\n\n ought to have set aside the order and remitted the matter to the\n\n authorities of the Board, to reconsider the claim of the respondent\n\n in accordance with law. That only means the order should have\n\n been an open remand, instead of asking the Board to reconsider\n\n the claim with reference to a particular principle \nlaid down by\n the\n\n High Court in a different factual scenario. Since, we are\n\n remanding the matter, we have not answered the second issue.\n\n16) In the result we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order\n\n and direct the authorities of the Board to reconsider the claim of\n\n the respondent in accordance with law.\n\n17) The appeal is disposed of accordingly.\n\n .......................................J.\n\n 10\n\n\f [ TARUN CHATTERJEE ]\n\n .......................................J.\n [ H.L.
