Criminal Misc. 2nd Bail Application No. 11462/2023\n\nBhanva Ram S/o Shri Gobra Ram, Aged About 38 Years, R/o\nNawapura, Bagora P.s. Dist. Jalore\n(Lodged In Sub Jail, Bhinmal)\n----Petitioner\nVersus\nState Of Rajasthan, Through Pp\n----Respondent\n\nFor Petitioner(s) : Mr. Achla Ram\nFor Respondent(s) : Mr. Mool Singh Bhati, PP\n\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJENDRA PRAKASH SONI\n\nOrder\n\n28/11/2023\n\n1. The petitioner, who is in custody in connection with the F.I.R.\n\nNo.25/2022 of Police Station Bagora, District Jalore for the alleged\n\ncommission of offences punishable under\nSections 8\n/\n&\n/\nof\n\nNDPS Act, 1985 seeks grant of bail in terms of\nSection 439\nof the\n\nCr.P.C., 1973.\n\n2. After rejection of the first bail application, statements of\n\nSeizure Officer - Chhatar Singh Deora (PW-1) and Investigation\n\nOfficer - Laxman Singh (PW-2) have been recorded during the\n\ntrial.\n\n3. The accusation against the petitioner is that on the basis of a\n\nsource information, on 22.02.2022 a raid was conducted in the\n\npremises of the petitioner. The person standing outside of the\n\nhouse introduced himself as Bhanva Ram but none of his family\n\nmembers were found there. After due formalities, under a pile of\n\n(Downloaded on 01/12/2023 at 08:39:24 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:41620] (2 of 5) [CRLMB-11462/2023]\n\nnet, which is used to cover plants in the field, in a corner of\n\nDhaliya (open sitting area) 6 kg 110 gms of opium was seized in a\n\ntransparent plastic bag.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner drew the attention of the\n\nCourt towards the cross-examinations conducted from Seizure\n\nOfficer - Chhatar Singh Deora (PW-1) and Investigation Officer -\n\nLaxman Singh (PW-2), wherein both of them admitted that no\n\nevidence whatsoever was collected regarding the title or\n\nownership or actual physical possession of Dhaliya in question\n\nduring the investigation. Even no documentary evidence was\n\ncollected in respect of the land/field whereupon Dhaliya was\n\nstated to be situated. It is argued that at the time of search and\n\nseizure, the petitioner was found standing on the public road\n\nwhich was a public way and he never had exclusive ownership or\n\npossession on the Dhaliya in question.\n\n5. It is further argued that neither the petitioner nor any of his\n\nfamily member was found present in that Dhaliya. Petitioner has\n\nbeen implicated in the present case, on the basis of his\n\nconfessional statement only made while in custody, which is not\n\nadmissible according to law. According to him, on the basis of\n\nsuch confessional statement and the recovery made from an open\n\nplace, liberty of petitioner cannot be curtailed indefinitely;\n\npetitioner is ready to abide by any condition imposed by the Court\n\nin case he is released on bail.\n\n6. On the opposite side, learned Public Prosecutor has opposed\n\nthe grant of bail to the petitioner and argued that petitioner is\n\ninvolved in drug peddling; that recovered contraband weighes\n\nabove commercial quantity as per the schedule appended to the\n\n(Downloaded on 01/12/2023 at 08:39:24 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:41620] (3 of 5) [CRLMB-11462/2023]\n\nAct and the Bar as contained in\nSection 37\nof the NDPS Act is\n\nattracted. He, thus, craves rejection of the petitioner's bail\n\napplication.\n\n7. I have been addressed by the counsel for the parties at\n\nlength and also have been taken through the record. I have\n\nconsidered the respective submissions.\n\n8. The Seizure Officer - Chhatar Singh Deora (PW-1) in his\n\ndeposition during the trial has deposed as under :-\n\n\"It is correct to say that neither I nor any member of\nthe police party knew petitioner Bhanva Ram earlier\n.... We had never been to the recovery Dhaliya\nearlier. It is correct to say that we did not recover\nany opium from the residential house of Bhanva Ram\n..... It is correct to say that the place wherefrom the\nopium was recovered was an open place; there was\nno door on it and any other person could easily\ncome in and go out from there. Any person could\ntake away and keep in any item there .... It is\ncorrect to say that Dhaliya was located adjacent to\nthe public road .... It is also correct to say that\nDhaliya was built in a field ..... It is correct to say\nthat there was a distance of 60 feet between the\nresidential house situated in the field and the\nDhaliya in question .... The field was also located\nadjacent to the public road ..... It is correct to say\nthat at the time of recovery, the petitioner Bhanva\nRam was found standing on the public road ....\nvehicle ply on that road .... no evidence/information\nin respect of the khasra numbers of the field was\ncollected whereupon the Dhaliya was situated. He\ndid not know that how many khatedars/co-tenants\nhad their share in the field and whether the field had\nbeen divided amongst the khatedars/co-tenants or\nnot ..... It is correct to say that I did not get any\n\n(Downloaded on 01/12/2023 at 08:39:24 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:41620] (4 of 5) [CRLMB-11462/2023]\n\ninformation about the Patwari, Sarpanch, Ward\nPanch or any neighbour about the possession and\nownership of field and Dhaliya in question ----. No\ndocuments were found at the place of search and\nseizure which revealed ownership or possession of\nthe Dhaliya and land no member of family of the\npetitioner Bhanva Ram was found living there.\"\n\n9. The Investigation Officer - Laxman Singh (PW-2) has also\n\ndeposed to the same nature and effect. In view of above\n\ndeposition of Investigating Officer and Seizure Officer recorded\n\nduring the trial, prima facie there appears to be a serious doubt in\n\nrespect of ownership and possession of the place in question\n\nwherefrom the seizure was effected.\n\n10. Above deposition prima facie clarifies that there are certain\n\ngrey areas in the case against the petitioner as regard the\n\nexclusive ownership and possession of place of recovery; trial of\n\nthe case is likely to consume sufficient time and no useful purpose\n\nwould be served by keeping the petitioner in detention for an\n\nindefinite period. The petitioner has been suffering incarceration\n\nfor 21 months and as per the bail rejection application order,\n\npetitioner does not have any criminal antecedents.\n\n11. In view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the conditions\n\nof\nSection 37\nof the Act are duly satisfied. Hence, the petitioner\n\ndeserves indulgence of bail during trial of the present case.\n\n12. Consequently, the second bail application is allowed. It is\n\nordered that the accused-petitioner Bhanva Ram S/o Shri\n\nGobra Ram in F.I.R. No.25/2022 of Police Station Bagora, District\n\nJalore shall be released on bail; provided he furnishes a personal\n\nbond of Rs. 1,00,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs. 50,000/- each\n\nto the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to\n\n(Downloaded on 01/12/2023 at 08:39:24 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JD:41620] (5 of 5) [CRLMB-11462/2023]\n\nappear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when\n\ncalled upon to do so and if not required by Jail Authorities in any\n\nother case. This order is subject to the condition that accused,\n\nwithin 7 days of his release and sureties, on the day of furnishing\n\nbail, will also furnish details of his all bank accounts, with bank\n\nand branch name, in shape of an affidavit, and submit legible copy\n\nof their Aadhar cards as well as front page of Bank pass book, for\n\nsmooth recovery of penalty amount, if there arise a need for\n\nrecovery of penalty under\nSection 446\nCr.P.C in future.\n\n(RAJENDRA PRAKASH SONI),J\n37-Payal/-\n\n(Downloaded on 01/12/2023 at 08:39:24 PM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
