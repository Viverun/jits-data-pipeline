As far as the recovery of the contraband\n\n drugs from the vehicle and from the possession of the petitioners\n\n is concerned, there are no contradictory statement of any witness,\n\n who has appeared before the trial court so far. The factum of\n\n recovery from the possession and from the car in which the\n\n petitioners were present is conclusively made out from the record\n\n placed before this Court and the statements made before the trial\n\n court.\n\n Having regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances\n\n of the case and considering the fact that huge quantity of\n\n contraband drugs have been recovered in the present case and\n\n looking to the nature of accusation and gravity of the offence\n\n without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, I am not\n\n inclined to grant bail under \nSection 439\n Cr.P.C. to the petitioners\n\n at this stage.\n\n Accordingly, the present second bail applications preferred by\n\n the petitioners under \nSection 439\n Cr.P.C. are dismissed.\n\n (VINIT KUMAR MATHUR),J\n 56-57-Shahenshah/-\n\n (Downloaded on 07/02/2023 at 09:38:24 PM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
