Therefore, Letters Patent\nAppeal No.380/2016 be treated and considered as a lead matter which is\narising out of Special Civil Application No.10829/2003.\n\n[4.0] The facts leading to the Letters Patent Appeal No.380/2016\narising out of Special Civil Application No.10829/2003 in nut­shell are\nas under:\n\n[4.1] That the private respondents herein - original petitioners were\nworking in the different departments of the State Government either as\nwork charged employees in the work charged establishment past almost\n30 years. The main grievance which was voiced in the main special civil\napplication was that though they are in the work charged establishment\npast almost 30 years, the authorities concerned have not taken any step\nto put them on the temporary establishment. It was the case on behalf of\nthe original petitioners that as a result of such inaction on the part of the\nState Government, and/or concerned department, they have been\ndeprived of benefits which an employee otherwise derives working on\nthe temporary establishment. Some of the petitioners complained that\nalthough they have been absorbed in the temporary establishment, yet\nthe same was at a very belated stage, rather than absorbing them in the\ntemporary establishment on completion of 5 years of service in the work\ncharged establishment, according to the policy of the State Government,\nas laid down in the circular dated 16.08.1973. Therefore, the claim put\nforward by the petitioners was to absorb them in the temporary\nestablishment from the work charged establishment on the basis of the\npolicy of the State Government which was prevailing at a point of time\nin the form of a resolution dated 16.08.1973 issued by the Public Works\nDepartment. It appears that with respect to some of the employees,\nbefore the benefit could be given to them of the resolution of the year\n\nPage 21 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n1973, the State Government cancelled the same and/or revoked the\nsame vide Government Resolution dated 20.08.2014. That therefore the\npetitioners more or less prayed for the following reliefs.\n\n\"13(A). Your Lordships be pleased to issue an order, direction\nand/or writ in the nature of mandamus and/or any other\nappropriate writ, order or direction, directing the respondents\nto treat the petitioners on temporary establishment on\ncompletion of 5 years of service as workcharge employees and\nfurther be pleased to direct the respondents to grant them\nhigher grade on completion of 9, 18 & 27 years of service from\nthe date the petitioners completed 9 years of service on\ntemporary establishment;\n\n(B) That Your Lordships be further pleased to direct the\nrespondents to convert the petitioners from workcharge\nestablishment to temporary establishment and thereafter grant\nfurther benefit of higher grade on completion of 9, 18 & 27\nyears of service;\n\n(C) That Your Lordships be pleased to quash and set aside the\nimpugned G.R. dated 20.08.2014 marked ANN.M to this\npetition, being arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of\nArticles\n& 16\nof the Constitution of India;\n\n(D) Pending admission and final disposal of this petition, Your\nLordships be pleased to direct the respondents to consider the\ncase of the petitioners in the light of the judgment rendered by\nthis Hon'ble Court in SCA No.7464/1996 and LPA\nNo.1360/2011;\n\n(E) Any other and such further relief as the Hon'ble Court\ndeems fit and proper in the interest of justice;\"\n\n[4.2] Before the learned Single Judge the original petitioners heavily\nrelied upon the decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in the\ncase of Rashmikaben Trikamlal & Ors. vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.\nrendered in Special Civil Application No.7464/1996 decided on\n21.01.2011 which came to be affirmed by the Division Bench and\nthereafter by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil)\n(CC) No.17221/2012. It was the case on behalf of the original\npetitioners that they have been serving in the work charged\nestablishment as work charged employees past almost 3 decades.\nTherefore, if the State Government though fit to avail the services of the\npetitioners for a period of almost 3 decades at a stretch, then it could be\n\nPage 22 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nsaid that the nature of work was permanent. It was the case on behalf of\nthe petitioners that they should have been given the benefit of\nGovernment Resolution dated 16.08.1973 by absorbing them in the\ntemporary establishment on completion of 5 years' service in the work\ncharged establishment. It was also the case on behalf of the original\npetitioners that action on the part of the State Government in\ncanceling / revoking the resolution of the year 1973 by way of the\nresolution of the year 2014 is absolutely highhanded and arbitrary and\nthe same is unconstitutional. It was submitted that it was not permissible\nin law for the State Government to withdraw the resolution of the year\n1973 with retrospective effect. It was also submitted on behalf of the\npetitioners that the notification of the year 2014 is violative of\nsection\n9A\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as \"\nID\nAct\n\"). It was submitted that the plea of financial implication is not\ntenable in law and cannot be the ground to deny the legitimate right of\nthe employees to absorb them in the temporary establishment on\ncompletion of 5 years' service in the work charged establishment.\n\n[4.3] It was also the case on behalf of the original petitioners that all of\nthem were recruited in accordance with law through the employment\nexchange and therefore, their appointments could not be termed as\nbackdoor entry. It was the case on behalf of the petitioners that their\nrecruitment was in accordance with rules and regulations. Making above\nsubmissions and relying upon number of decisions of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court referred to in para 12 of the impugned judgment and\norder, it was requested to grant the reliefs as prayed in the petition.\n\nAt this stage it is required to be noted that before the learned\nSingle Judge there were three categories of employees. First category\nwas those employees who were serving as work charge in the work\ncharged establishment and claiming the benefit of the resolution of 1973\n\nPage 23 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nand to absorb them in the temporary establishment on completion of 5\nyears of service in the work charged establishment. The second category\nof employees before the learned Single Judge was those serving in the\ntemporary establishment and/or as temporary employees claiming the\npermanency / absorption in view of the Government Resolution dated\n17.10.1998 and/or claiming the higher pay scale on completion of 5\nyears, 10 years, 15 years as the case may be on the temporary\nestablishment and the third category of the employees was those who\nwere serving as daily wagers for number of years and claiming the relief\nof their absorption in the work charged establishment and thereafter on\ntemporary establishment claiming the benefit of higher pay scale and\nother benefits as per the G.R. dated 17.10.1988.\n\n[5.0] The aforesaid petitions were vehemently opposed by the State. It\nwas the case on behalf of the State before the learned Single Judge that\nnone of the petitioners have any legal or vested right to claim that on\ncompletion of 5 years in the work charged establishment they should\nhave been absorbed in the temporary establishment. It was submitted on\nbehalf of the State that the entire claim based on the G.R. of the year\n1973 is misconceived.\n\n[5.1] It was the case on behalf of the State that the appointments of the\npetitioners were not in consonance with the\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution of India. It was further the case on behalf of the respondent\nState that way back in the year 1978, the State Government had taken a\npolicy decision not to appoint any person on work charged\nestablishment, but despite such policy decision, the respective\ndepartments recruited the petitioners. It was submitted that it is well\nwithin the powers of the State Government to change its policy after due\ndeliberations. It was submitted on behalf of the State that in wake of the\n\nPage 24 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nG.R. of the year 2014, the petitioners cannot claim for the absorption in\nthe temporary establishment. It was submitted that therefore in view of\nthe G.R. of the year 2014, the decision of the learned Single Judge in the\ncase of Rashmikaben Trikamlal & Ors. (Supra) heavily relied upon by\nthe petitioners shall not be helpful to the petitioners since the G.R. of\n1973 no longer remains in existence. It was also the case on behalf of\nthe State that there are highly disputed questions of fact involved in\neach of the petitions as regards the mode of appointment, qualification\netc. and therefore, it was requested not to issue any writ of mandamus\nupon the State Government to absorb the petitioners in the temporary\nestablishment. It was further submitted on behalf of the State that\nhaving regard to the financial implications, it is not feasible for the State\nGovernment to absorb the petitioners from the work charged\nestablishment to temporary establishment. It was submitted that the\nG.R. of the year 2014 could not be termed in any manner as\nunconstitutional or illegal as it does not take away any vested or legal\nrights of the petitioners.\n\nMaking above submissions and relying upon the decisions of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court as well as this Court referred to in para 23 of the\nimpugned judgment and order and relying upon the affidavit in reply\nfiled on behalf of the respondent No.1 duly affirmed through the Under\nSecretary, R&B Department, Gandhinagar, which has been reproduced\nin para 24 of the impugned judgment and order, it was requested to\ndismiss the petitions.\n\n[6.0] That thereafter, after considering the submissions made by the\nlearned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties and\nconsidering\nsection 9A\nof the ID Act, the learned Single Judge has\nobserved and held and had come to the conclusion that the impugned\nG.R. of 2014 is not liable to be quashed only on the ground of violation\n\nPage 25 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nof\nsection 9A\nof the ID Act. However, thereafter, the learned Single\nJudge did not accept the objection on behalf of the State of alternative\nremedy available. That thereafter after considering the object of the G.R.\ndated 16.08.1973 and the fact that the respective petitioners are\ncontinued as work charged employees in the work charged\nestablishment for the years together and after considering the various\nother decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to and discussed\nin paras 74 to 81 of the impugned common judgment and order and\nother decisions referred to in paras 88, 89, 92, 93, 96, 99, 100, 104, 105,\n109, 110, 113 and 114, in para 120, the learned Single Judge has\nconcluded in para 120 as under:\n\n\"120. To sum up the principle deduced from the long chain of\ndecided cases it can be said to be well settled:\n\n(i) In the matter of Government service normal rule is regular\nrecruitment through prescribed agency, the recruitment of ad\nhoc or temporary hands is an exceptional leeway permitted due\nto exigencies of administration. In such a fact situation the\nendeavour will also be to replace such temporary employee by\nregular selected employees.\n\n(ii) that law does not favour ad hoc or temporary employment\ncontinuing for long spells, as it breeds unhealthy and\nunreasonable service environment endangering industrial peace\nperilously affecting dignity and quality of life of those whose\nsecurity of work is under constant threat.\n\n(iii)\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution is embodiment of rule against\narbitrariness and unreasonableness in the State action in all\nspheres of its activities.\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution which\nguarantees protection against deprivation of life and personal\nliberty includes within it the right to dignified livelihood.\nArticle\n39(d)\nspells out the directive principles of the State policy\ntowards securing equal pay for equal work for both woman and\nman and\nArticle 42\nstipulates the Directive Principles of the\nState policy in securing just and humane conditions of work.\n\n(iv) equal pay for equal work and security of employment by\nregularising casual employees of long duration within a\nreasonable period have been unanimously accepted as\nConstitutional goal to our policy. To this end, thrust has been\n\nPage 26 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nthat the management particularly Govt. agencies should not\nallow workers to remain as casual labourers or temporary\nemployees for unreasonably long period of time.\n\n(v) mere continuation for some period on ad hoc by itself does\nnot give a right to permanency but where for any reason ad hoc\nor temporary or work charged employees are continued for\nfairly long spell they have a right to claim regularisation and the\nauthorities are under obligation to consider their case for\nregularisation in a fair manner.\n\n(vi) regularisation cannot be resorted to by the governmental\nagencies as mode of fresh recruitment to permit back door\nentries to frustrate the mandate of\nArticle 16\nby making a\nstraight jacket measure of service for regularising the\nappointment made de hors the rules, unmindful of the\ncircumstances under which the appointment had been made.\n\n(vii) the first condition for laying claim for regularisation is\navailability of work on reasonably permanent basis. Mere\ncontinuance for some time of a casual or ad hoc employee does\nnot give right to presume about need for continued employment\nor work charged but continuation of casual or ad hoc employee\nor work charged for a long duration of several years raises a\npresumption for need for regular permanent employment may\nbe justified.\n\n(viii) Apart from the right to reasonable treatment by the State\nagencies and security of job emanating from the Constitutional\nprovisions,\nIndustrial Disputes Act\nis a legislative measure\ngiving effect to the directive principles of State Policy in the\nfield of ensuring equal pay for equal work and ensuring security\nof job with just and humane conditions by providing prohibition\nagainst practising of unfair labour practice both by employers\nand employees and defining the term unfair labour practice to\ninclude practice of engaging workman for long spells\ncharacterising them badli, casual, temporary, ad hoc work\ncharged with the object of denying them the status of\npermanency and benefits and privileges attached thereto.\n\n(ix) A claim by workers, continuing for long spell as casual or\ntemporary or work charged under an employer governed by the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, to permanency is a demand which can\nbe achieved through collective bargaining or a claim giving rise\nto a industrial dispute which can be enforced through\nadjudication under the provisions of the\nI.D. Act\n.\n\n(x) Adjudication of claim for permanent status as an industrial\n\nPage 27 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndispute which has been made subject matter of reference to the\nIndustrial tribunal is governed by the principles emanating from\nthe provisions of\nIndustrial Disputes Act\nwhich by necessary\nimplication involves determination of question whether\ncontinued casual or temporary employment is a bonafide\nadministrative exigency simplicitor or amounts to unfair labour\npractice on the part of the employer, inasmuch as claim to\npermanency under\nIndustrial Disputes Act\ndirectly emanates\nfrom prohibition against unfair labour practice adopted by the\nemployer.\n\n(xi) In situation emerging from long spell of ad hoc or\ntemporary or casual employment of daily rated workmen,\ncourts have consistently resorted to issue of directions for\nframing a scheme for regularisation of such workmen on a just\nand fair basis to the employer or have also issue of directions\nfor regularising the petitioners before it as the circumstances of\nthe case may warrant but ordinarily in the first instance an\nopportunity is being given to the employer himself to frame a\nscheme in a fair and just manner of absorbing such casual\nworkmen on permanent basis whether in one go or in a phased\nmanner and has considered objections thereto, if any, before\naccording its approval to such scheme.\n\n(xii) In considering the question of granting relief as to\nconferring status of permanency and emoluments and privileges\nattached thereto, primary consideration is existence of\npermanent nature of work for such casual employees to be\nutilised against it and the extent of absorption on regular and\npermanent basis depends upon the extent of regular work\navailable against which temporary employee can be regularly\nemployed. Regularisation or permanency is not to be resorted in\ncase where the establishment by itself is of temporary nature;\n\nwhere the employment is not with the object of offering\nemployment but for ameliorating financial condition of weaker\nsections of the society like employment under Jawahar Yojana\nor where employment has been secured or offered by\ncommitting illegalities, irregularities or fraud as in the case of\nAshwani Kumar (supra) where the appointments were found to\nhave been given to six thousand persons out of all proportion to\nthe then existing requirement of the project for about 800\npersons only, by the Director of the project Mr. Malik by\ncommitting illegalities, irregularities and fraud as per the\ninvestigation report. In which case the appointments against\nrules were held to be nullity and void ad initio.\"\n\nThat thereafter after discussing and/or considering the decisions\n\nPage 28 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nrelied upon on behalf of the State, by impugned judgment and order, the\nlearned Single Judge has concluded finally in para 147 as under:\n\n\"147. My final conclusion is as under:\n\n(I) The writ applications are maintainable and are not liable to be\nrejected on the ground of availability of an alternative remedy\nunder the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\nor any other appropriate\nLegislation.\n\n(II) The action of the State Government, in not absorbing the writ\napplicants in the temporary establishment from the work charged\non completion of five years of continuous service and fulfillment of\nother conditions, is contrary to the concept of social and economic\njustice. The State, as a model employer, should not have guillotined\nthe legitimate aspirations of the employees. It created a situation\nwith hopes ending in despair.\n\n(III)\nSection 9A\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 has no role to\nplay as such and the issue raised is of no significance.\n(IV) The Government Resolution of the year 2014 impugned in\nthese writ applications being a policy matter is not disturbed, but at\nthe same time, the writ applicants are entitled to the benefits of the\nearlier policy, more particularly, when such policy remained in force\nfor forty one years and the writ applicants have been serving past\nalmost thirty years.\"\n\nAt this stage it is required to be noted that as such the learned\nSingle Judge has rejected the prayer to declare the resolution of 2014 as\nper se illegal or unconstitutional being a policy matter. However, has\nobserved that when the Government has thought it fit to change the\npolicy decision by revoking the earlier G.R. of 1973, let it be so, but\natleast so far as the employees working as on date on the work charged\nestablishment are concerned, they are entitled to the benefits of the\nearlier policy more particularly when such policy remained in force for\n41 years and the petitioners have been serving past almost 30 years.\nThat thereafter, by impugned common judgment and order the learned\nSingle Judge has allowed all the petitions in part and has issued the final\ndirections in para 148 as under:\n\n\"148. In the result, all the writ applications are allowed in part.\n(I) The State Government is directed to absorb the writ applicants\nin the temporary establishment from the work charged and grant\nthem the benefits as stated below:\n\nPage 29 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n(a) The State Government will first fix the date on which the writ\napplicants became eligible for being absorbed on the temporary\nestablishment in terms of the earlier policy which was prevailing.\n\nWhatever date is fixed in that regard, thereafter nine years period\nshould be considered as having worked on the temporary\nestablishment. To put it in clear terms, say for instance, if an\nemployee was eligible to be absorbed in the work charged\nestablishment in the year 1995, then he would have been entitled to\nthe first higher pay scale after putting in nine years of service on the\ntemporary establishment i.e. 1995 + 9 = 2004. The benefits shall\nbe calculated accordingly.\n\n(II) So far as the Daily Wagers are concerned, the State Government\nis directed to absorb them on the work charged establishment from\nthe date they were otherwise eligible to be absorbed. For example,\nif they would have been absorbed in the year 1995, then the\nbenefits would accrue nine years thereafter i.e. 2004. I expect the\nState Government, as a model employer, to act accordingly and\nexpeditiously.\n\n(III) If any of the petitioners have retired/expired, then those\npetitioners shall also be entitled to the benefits in above terms and\nthey or their legal heirs, as the case may be, shall be paid the\namount falling due by virtue of this order expeditiously.\"\n\n[6.1] Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common\njudgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge in Special Civil\nApplication No.10829/2003 and other allied Special Civil Applications,\nthe original respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 - State of Gujarat and others\nhave preferred the present Letters Patent Appeals under Clause 15 of the\nLetters Patent.\n\n[7.0] Shri Kamal Trivedi, learned Advocate General has appeared with\nMs. Sangita Vishen and Shri Dhawan Jayswal, learned Assistant\nGovernment Pleaders appearing on behalf of the appellants - State of\nGujarat and others and Shri H.S.

It is further\nsubmitted that the learned Single Judge has also materially erred in\nissuing the directions relying upon and/or considering the resolution of\n1973 and has materially erred in directing the State to absorb all those\nemployees working on work charged establishment to absorb them on\nthe temporary establishment on completion of 5 years of service as work\ncharged.\n\n[8.1] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that as such the learned Single\nJudge has not properly appreciated the purpose and object of work\ncharged establishment. It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned\nAdvocate General appearing on behalf of the appellants that as such by\nway of G.R. dated 16.08.1973 initially Government of Gujarat floated a\npolicy of conversion of post of work charged establishment in respect of\nmaintenance and repairs of any works or irrigation management which\nare either required preliminary or for a very long term basis. It is\nsubmitted that therefore the same was only with respect to the\nestablishment in respect of maintenance and repairs. It is submitted that\n\nPage 31 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\neven as per the said G.R. dated 16.08.1973 there cannot be any\nautomatic conversion from work charged establishment to temporary\nestablishment solely on completion of 5 years of service as work\ncharged. It is submitted that subject to the requirement and availability\nof posts, of all those work charged employees were required to be\nconsidered and converted into temporary establishment. It is submitted\nthat conversion of work charged employees into temporary\nestablishment was not by way of promotion. It is submitted that the\nsame was initiated to satisfy the need of people in establishment. It is\nsubmitted that there is more sanctioned posts of temporary\nestablishment and their appointment was based on constant requirement\nof work. It is submitted that on merely completing 5 years in service as\nwork charge shall not entitle the petitioners to claim benefits of\nconversion. It is submitted that the same cannot be claimed as a matter\nof right by the petitioners more particularly when their appointment was\nby way of back door entry.\n\n[8.2] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that even otherwise on and after\nFebruary 1987 there was a ban on recruitment on the work charged\nestablishment. It is submitted that by G.R. dated 03.02.1987 a decision\nwas taken that no person to be recruited on work charged establishment.\nIt is submitted that despite the same some of the departments continued\nto employ / recruit the persons on work charged establishment and that\ntoo de hors the G.R. dated 03.02.1987. It is submitted that instruction\nissued in G.R. dated 03.02.1987 was again repeated vide instruction\ndated 11.07.1988. It is submitted that vide instruction dated\n11.07.1988, instruction was issued and the G.R. dated 03.08.1987 was\nagain repeated. It is submitted that thereafter in the year 1989 the\ncircular was issued / re­issued reiterating the same proposition of G.R.\n\nPage 32 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndated 03.08.1987 regarding the ban on conversion to work charged\nestablishment. It is submitted that therefore there is no question of\nconversion of the employees working on work charged establishment\ninto temporary establishment and/or converting daily wagers into the\nstatus of work charged employees thereafter.\n\n[8.3] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that in any case even thereafter in\nview of the subsequent G.R. dated 17.10.1988, policy of converting daily\nwagers into the status of work charged employees announced by G.R.\ndated 04.07.1973 should be deemed to have been substituted more\nparticularly when the State Government came out with the issuance of 3\nG.Rs. of 17.10.1988, conferring benefits in different categories of daily\nwagers having been put in the service of 5 years or more, though vide\ncircular dated 03.02.1987 new recruitment of work charged\nestablishment from daily wagers was already prohibited. It is submitted\nthat therefore since the conversion from daily wagers to work charged\nemployees had already came to be prohibited vide circular dated\n03.02.1987 which were repeated time and again, subsequent\nappointment of the daily wagers as work charged employees after\n03.02.1987 and thereafter would be treated as illegal appointments. It is\nsubmitted that therefore the learned Single Judge has materially erred in\ndirecting the State to absorb all work charged employees in the\ntemporary establishment as per the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 on\ncompletion of either 5 years as work charge and consequently the\nlearned Single Judge has materially erred in granting them the benefit of\nhigher pay scale on completion of 9 years from the date on which they\nare absorbed in the temporary establishment on completion of 5 years as\nwork charge. It is submitted that the directions issued by the learned\nSingle Judge would amount to an en block regularization, which is\n\nPage 33 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nimpermissible in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nthe case of Umadevi (3) (Supra).\n\n[8.4] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that even otherwise, automatic\nconversion of daily wagers into work charged employees as also\nconversion from the work charged employees to temporary\nestablishment without considering (1) existence of the sanctioned post;\n(2) present vacancy in the second post; (3) eligibility conditions\nprovided under the respective recruitment rules; (4) ban, if any, on the\nrecruitment in the employment would be illegal and contrary to as per\nthe decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Umadevi (3)\n(Supra).\n\n[8.5] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that even otherwise the work\ncharged employees are not getting various benefits which are otherwise\navailable to persons working in the temporary establishment and\ntherefore, if on completion of 5 years of service, there is an automatic\nabsorption of work charged employees as persons working in temporary\nestablishment, then in that case, the administration would be saddled\nwith not only enormous administrative responsibility, virtually\namounting to impossibility, but also huge financial liability in terms of\ngrant of the benefits viz. (1) grant of placement in the appropriate place\nin the seniority list with back date; (2) grant of deemed date of\npromotion; (3) revision of pay scale; (4) grant of higher pay scale if\npromotion is not available; (5) re­fixation of pay scale in the event of\ngrant of promotion with back date and all the consequential benefits\nflowing there from. It is submitted that therefore the learned Single\nJudge has materially erred in issuing the final directions by which there\n\nPage 34 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nshall be a heavy financial burden and/or huge financial liability on the\nState Government.\n\n[8.6] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that on one hand the learned\nSingle Judge has specifically observed and held that the impugned G.R.\nof 2014 is neither violative of\nSection 9A\nof the ID Act nor same is illegal\nbeing a policy decision and still on the other hand the learned Single\nJudge has granted the benefits considering the G.R. of 1973 which can\nbe said to be contradictory in terms.\n\n[8.7] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that while issuing the impugned\ndirections in respect of daily wagers, the learned Single Judge has not at\nall considered the subsequent G.R. dated 17.10.1988 and/or the effect of\nthe G.R. dated 17.10.1988 by which all earlier circular / resolutions\nwere superseded and the Government came out with a new policy\ndecision in form of the G.R. dated 17.10.1988 by which certain benefits\nwere conferred on such employees on completion of their 5 years, 10\nyears and/or 15 years as daily wagers working in the work charged\nestablishment.\n\n[8.8] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that as such vide G.R. dated\n17.10.1988 issued by the R&B Department of the State Government,\nsubsequently benefits were granted to the daily wagers of three different\ncategories viz. (1) unskilled; (2) semi­skilled and (3) skilled. It is\nsubmitted that this was for all practical purposes, in substitution of the\nearlier G.R. dated 04.07.1973 with reference to absorption of daily\nwagers on work charges establishment. It is further submitted that\n\nPage 35 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ntherefore thereafter in view of the issuance of the G.R. dated\n17.10.1988, State Government issued circular / instruction dated\n31.03.1989, inter alia declaring that in absence of there being any\nprovision of appointing daily wager on work charged establishment in\nthe said G.R. dated 17.10.1988, appointment of daily wagers as work\ncharged employees should be totally banned. It is further submitted that\nthereafter a G.R. dated 05.01.1990 in the R&B Department came to be\nissued, inter alia superseding the earlier G.Rs. dated 04.07.1973,\n16.11.1978 and the instructions for converting daily wagers on the work\ncharged establishment in the wake of the policy and the rules announced\nby the aforesaid three G.Rs dated 17.10.1988, in case of daily wagers.\n\n[8.9] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that even thereafter a G.R. dated\n16.08.1994 came to be issued by the R & B Department declaring the\ngrant of benefit of higher pay scale in lieu of promotion on completion of\n9, 18 and 27 years with a clarification that the work charged employees\nare not eligible to get the benefit of higher pay scale in lieu of\npromotion. It is submitted that thereafter the G.R. dated 02.07.2007\ncame to be issued superseding the earlier policy for grant of benefit of\nhigher pay scale in lieu of promotion on completion of 9, 18 and 27\nyears vide new policy for grant of said benefit on completion of 12 - 24\nyears, wherein clause 1(4) provides that the said policy will not be\napplicable to the work charged establishment employees. It is further\nsubmitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General appearing on behalf\nof the appellants that therefore the impugned directions issued by the\nlearned Single Judge are just contrary to the aforesaid G.Rs./circulars.\n\n[8.10] In the alternative it is submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned\nAdvocate General appearing on behalf of the appellants that the learned\n\nPage 36 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nSingle Judge has materially erred in issuing the general directions. It is\nsubmitted that each case was required to be considered separately as the\nfacts differ. It is submitted that in many of the cases even some of the\npersons were already put in the work charged establishment and/or\nwere put in the temporary establishment before many years and\nthereafter no grievance was made by them and thereafter after a long\npassage of time and belatedly they claimed their absorption from the\nwork charged establishment to temporary establishment on completion\nof their 5 years as work charged. It is submitted that therefore the\nlearned Single Judge could have restricted the reliefs and/or actual\nbenefits from the date of filing of the petition and/or restricting the\nactual benefits for the last three years from the date of filing of the\npetitions.\n\nShri Trivedi, learned Advocate General has relied upon the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nShiv Dass vs.\nUnion of India & Ors.\nreported in AIR 2007 SC 1330 and the decision\nof the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Acharya Madhavi\nBhavin Rachhadiya Jasminkumar Kantibhai & Ors. vs. State of\nGujarat & Ors. rendered in Letters Patent Appeal No.1184/2017.\n\n[8.11] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the appellants that the learned Single\nJudge has materially erred in not applying the law laid down by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Umadevi (3) (Supra) which has\nbeen consistently considered and followed by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in catena of subsequent decisions.\n\n[8.12] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the appellants that the learned Single\nJudge has materially erred in relying upon and/or considering the\n\nPage 37 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndecision of the learned Single Judge in the case of Rashmikaben\nTrikamlal and Others (Supra). It is submitted that considering the\ncontroversy in the said petition the learned Single Judge ought not to\nhave followed the said decision while considering the reliefs sought in\nthe petition/s.\n\nNow, so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of the learned\nSingle Judge of this Court in the case of Rashmikaben Trikamlal &\nOthers (Supra) relied upon by the original petitioners and which has\nbeen considered by the learned Single Judge is concerned, it is\nsubmitted that the said decision can be said to be per incuriam and/or\nthe same was not to be treated as a precedent as observed by the\nDivision Bench in Letters Patent Appeal No.1360/2011 arising out of\nSpecial Civil Application No.7464/1996.\n\n[8.13] Relying upon the further additional affidavits affirmed by\nShri N.K. Patel, Chief Engineer and Additional Secretary, R&B\nDepartment and affirmed by Shri K.A. Patel, Special Secretary, Narmada\nWater Resources, Water Supply and Kalpsar Department, State of\nGujarat, it is vehemently submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the State that if the directions contained\nin the common CAV judgment under challenge were to be implemented,\nthen in that case, the financial implication on public exchequer will be in\nthe order of Rs.222 Crores (approximately) apart from recurring\nfinancial burden so far as the R & B Department is concerned and\napproximately Rs.260 Crores and Rs.103 Crores (approximately) for\nabsorption of work charged employees into temporary establishment and\ndaily wagers into work charged establishment respectively apart from\nrecurring financial burden so far as the Narmada Water Resources and\nWater Supply and Kalpsar Department is concerned. It is submitted that\nall the daily wagers are being paid the wages in the regular pay scale as\n\nPage 38 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nper the G.R. dated 17.10.1988 and as they are governed by the three\nG.Rs. of 17.10.1988 for unskilled; semi­skilled and skilled workers. It is\nsubmitted that work charged employees are not getting various benefits\nwhich are otherwise available to the persons working in the temporary\nestablishment and hence, if there is an automatic absorption of work\ncharged employees as persons working in the temporary establishment,\nthen in that case, administration would be saddled with not only\nenormous administrative responsibility, virtually amounting to not only\nimpossible but also huge financial liability in terms of the grant of\nvarious benefits which are available to the persons working in the\ntemporary establishment. It is submitted that there are recruitment rules\nframed with respect to the various posts in different categories of\nemployment in temporary establishment such as fitter, work assistant,\nroad­roller driver etc.\nand therefore, any direction to absorb all those\nwork charged employees into temporary establishment solely on\ncompletion of their 5 years as work charged shall be violative of\nArticles\nand\nof the Constitution of India and therefore, the same shall not\nbe sustainable in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nthe case of\nSecretary, State of Karnataka and Others vs. Umadevi\n(3)\nand Others reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 and other subsequent decisions.\n\n[8.14] Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General appearing on behalf\nof the appellants has pointed out that the employees working on\ntemporary establishment are as such and virtually permanent employees\nand they are being given all the benefits which are available to the\nregular permanent employees. It is submitted that those who are\nappointed on temporary establishment are appointed after following due\nprocedure and as per the recruitment rules. It is submitted that therefore\nif the directions issued by the learned Single Judge were to be\nimplemented\n,\nin that case\nthe same can be said to be absolutely in\n\nPage 39 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nconflict with the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nUmadevi\n(3) (Supra). It is submitted that even otherwise and even as per\nthe G.R. dated 16.08.1973, the work charged establishment is to be\nconverted into temporary establishment and/or those working on work\ncharged establishment were to be absorbed in the temporary\nestablishment subject to availability of the post only. It is submitted that\ntherefore even considering the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 such persons who\nare working s work charged can be said to have a right to consider their\ncases for absorption in temporary establishment and not beyond that.\n\n[8.15] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the appellants that as such the learned\nSingle Judge has passed the impugned CAV common judgment and\nissued directions solely and mainly on the ground that all those working\neither as daily wagers and/or as work charged for a long period. It is\nsubmitted that nothing is on record that all those persons were\nappointed as work charged on work charged establishment after\nfollowing due procedure and as per the recruitment rules. It is submitted\nthat therefore mere long period of service alone cannot be a ground to\nabsorb all those work charged employees to temporary establishment\nwhich as such can be said to be granting the permanent status and/or to\nregularize their service as permanent employees.\n\n[8.16] It is further submitted by Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the appellant that as such so far as the\ndaily wagers are concerned, there is no much discussion by the learned\nSingle Judge more particularly with respect to their status as daily\nwagers. It is submitted that as per catena of decisions of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court as well as this Court, those who are working on daily\nwage basis have no right to be regularized and/or regularization merely\n\nPage 40 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\non the ground that they are working since long. It is further submitted\nby Shri Trivedi, learned Advocate General that even otherwise all those\ndaily wagers are governed by the subsequent G.R. dated 17.10.1988 and\nthey are being given all the benefits flowing from the G.R. dated\n17.10.1988. It is submitted that by the G.R. dated 17.10.1988 all other\nearlier G.Rs. are superseded and the State Government has come out\nwith fresh policy. It is submitted that therefore the earlier policy prior to\n17.10.1988 shall not be thereafter made applicable and all shall be\ngoverned by the subsequent G.R. dated 17.10.1988 and other\nsubsequent policy decisions and/or G.Rs./circulars. It is submitted that\ntherefore the impugned decision so far as the daily wagers are\nconcerned, the same cannot be sustained and the same deserves to be\nquashed and set aside.\n\nMaking above submissions and relying upon the following\ndecisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as this Court it is\nrequested to allow the present Letters Patent Appeals.\n\n1.

Chauhan, learned Advocate appearing for Gujarat Water\nResources Development Corporation appearing in Letters Patent Appeal\nNos.1230/2016, 833/2016 and 618/2016 has, in addition to what\nlearned Advocate General has submitted, relied upon the decision of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nState of Rajasthan vs. Daya Lal\n\nreported in (2011) 2 SCC 429 has vehemently submitted that as held by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid decision no mandamus can\nbe issued of regularization.\n\nHe has also relied upon the decision of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nNand Kumar vs. State of Bihar\n\nPage 42 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nreported in (2014) 5 SCC 300.\n\n[9.2] Shri Murli Devnani, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of some\nof the original petitioners has submitted that in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case and considering the fact that the respective\noriginal petitioners were working as work charged employees since more\nthan 3 decades, the learned Single Judge has rightly directed the original\nrespondents - appellants herein to absorb them in the temporary\nestablishment on completion of 5 years / 10 years of service as per the\nG.R. dated 16.08.1973.\n\n[9.3] It is further submitted by Shri Devnani, learned Advocate that in\nthe facts and circumstances of the case the decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the case of\nUmadevi\n(3) (Supra) upon which the\nreliance has been placed by the State shall not be applicable to the facts\nof the case on hand. It is submitted that as such the directions issued by\nthis Court are in favour of the employees who are working as work\ncharged employees and their appointments can be termed as irregular\nappointments but not illegal appointments and thereby making them\neligible and entitled for benefit of regularization on completion of 5\nyears of service.\n\n[9.4] It is submitted that even the rules for recruitment for the post of\nwork charged only provides for calling the names from the employment\nexchange. It is submitted that therefore all the appointments of the work\ncharged employees are as per the rules provided in Rule 92(1)(k), sub­\nrule (2).\n\n[9.5] It is further submitted that it is required to take into account the\nfact that the employees appointed as daily wage workers are getting\n\nPage 43 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nbenefit flowing from the G.R. dated 17.10.1988. Such employees are\ngiven certain benefits on completion of 5­10­15 years of service. It is\nsubmitted that as per the decision of this Court, daily rated employees\nare to be treated as regular employees. It is submitted that in the present\ncase majority of the employees are appointed and working as work\ncharged employees since many years and they have retired as work\ncharged employees or have to retire as work charged employees. It is\nsubmitted that even though the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 was meant for\ngrant of the benefit of temporary establishment, if work charged\nemployees has worked continuously on work charged establishment for\nmore than 5 years, they are not granted the benefit of absorption in the\ntemporary establishment on completion of 5 years as work charge.\n\n[9.6] It is further submitted by Shri Devnani, learned Advocate\nappearing on behalf of some of the original petitioners that the\nauthorities have conceded the fact that their appointments are not\nagainst a particular projects as contemplated in their policy of employing\nsuch employees. It is submitted that thus continuing such a large class of\nemployees as work charged employees for such a long period is nothing\nbut a classic example of exploitation by State Government authorities\nthough the State Government is required to act as a model employer.\n\n[9.7] It is further submitted by Shri Devnani, learned Advocate\nappearing on behalf of some of the original petitioners that as such the\nState Government has conceded the fact that employees of the Irrigation\nDepartment as well as Panchayat Department are extended such\nbenefits, but the same benefits are extended to them because of the\nmistake on the part of the State Government authorities and thereby the\nsame cannot be a cause for creation of right in favour of the employees\nin the present litigation. It is submitted that aforesaid is nothing but an\n\nPage 44 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nattempt of eye­wash on the part of the State as majority of such\nemployees have been extended benefit on the basis of various Court's\norders in their favour or on the basis of the policy adopted by the\nDepartment after careful consideration of all the relevant factors\nincluding financial burden, a conscious policy decision were taken by the\nsaid Departments which cannot be termed as a wrong decision. It is\nsubmitted that had it been so, the appellants would have definitely come\nforward for withdrawal of such benefits and recovery of the amounts of\narrears from the concerned employees.\n\n[9.8] Now, so far as the case on behalf of the State that there shall be\nhuge financial burden if the respective original petitioners are granted\nthe benefit of absorption in the temporary establishment as directed by\nthe learned Single Judge is concerned, it is submitted that the same\ncannot be a ground to deny the legitimate rights / benefits to such\nemployees. It is submitted that the State cannot be permitted to take the\nadvantage of its own wrong. It is submitted that if the appellants had\ngranted these benefits in time to its employees as per the eligibility and\nentitlement, there would not be such financial burden for them to bear.\n\n[9.9] It is further submitted by Shri Devnani, learned Advocate\nappearing on behalf of some of the original petitioners that as such some\nof the zonal offices have made fresh appointments and some of the\noffices are entitled to make fresh appointment for filling up certain posts\nin the cadre of work assistant which would be nothing but an attempt on\nthe part of the State to deprive the legitimate right of the employees\nworking with them for a long period.\n\n[9.10] It is further submitted by Shri Devnani, learned Advocate\nappearing on behalf of some of the original petitioners that as such the\n\nPage 45 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nappellants have not come forward with details and availability of\nvacancies of different posts in temporary establishment as the same\nwould be a vital factor which may be taken into consideration for\nredressal of the grievances of the present respondents - original\npetitioners. Relying upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nthe case of\nState of Punjab & Ors. vs. Jagjit Singh and Ors.\nreported in\n(2017) 1 SCC 148, it is vehemently submitted by Shri Devnani, learned\nAdvocate appearing on behalf of some of the original petitioners that\neven on the principal of \"Equal Pay for Equal Work\", the impugned\ndecision of the learned Single Judge does not call for any interference.\n\nMaking above submissions and relying upon the decision of the\nlearned Single Judge in the case of\nRevabhai Bhudarbhai Solanki vs.\nState of Gujarat\nrendered in Special Civil Application No.2743/2002\nwith Special Civil Application No.3930/2002, it is requested to dismiss\nthe present appeals.\n\n[10.0] Shri T.R. Mishra, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of\nthe original petitioners of Special Civil Application No.10308/2012\n(respondents herein in LPA No.429/2017) has vehemently opposed the\nLetters Patent Appeal No.429/2017 and has submitted that in the facts\nand circumstances of the case the learned Single Judge has not\ncommitted any error in issuing the impugned directions directing the\nState to absorb all those work charged employees into temporary\nestablishment on completion of their 5 years' service as work charged.\n\n[10.1] It is further submitted by Shri Mishra, learned Advocate that\nhe is concerned with about 45 petitions. It is submitted that different\npetitioners are mentioned working in different offices. It is submitted\nthat issue which has arisen is whether the appointment of these persons\nwere on a particular project; as work charged employees; or it was a\n\nPage 46 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ngeneral order appointing these persons on work charged establishment\nwithout mentioning any project on which they have been appointed.\n\n[10.2] It is further submitted by Shri Mishra, learned Advocate that\nthere are two type of petitioners; one, who have been appointed as daily\nwagers initially and after 5, 10 years of service as daily wagers, they\nwere converted as work charged establishment and second, those who\nhave been appointed initially as work charged employees. It is submitted\nthat all these appointments were through employment exchange and\nthose who were initially appointed as daily wagers have been directly\nrecruited from open market. It is submitted that all these daily wagers\nwho have completed 10 years of service have been converted as work\ncharged employee instead of permanent employee, based on the G.R.\ndated 17.10.1988. It is submitted that after completion of 10 years of\nservice, they ought to have been directly appointed on temporary\nestablishment so that again on completion of 9 years of service, they\ncould have got the benefit of first higher grade.\n\n[10.3] It is submitted that so far as LPA No.429/2017 arising out\nof Special Civil Application No.10308/2012 is concerned, it is submitted\nthat after all the original petitioners were converted into work charged\nfrom daily wagers, Government has taken a decision to grant higher\ngrade vide G.R. dated 01.06.1993 and the authority have already send\ndarkhast to the Government for conversion of work charged employees\ninto temporary establishment as back as on 23.07.2008.\n\n[10.4] It is further submitted by Shri Mishra, learned Advocate that\neven otherwise in the above LPA, the juniors to the original petitioners\nwere converted from work charged establishment to temporary\nestablishment in the year 1999 itself. It is submitted that the juniors to\n\nPage 47 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nthe original petitioners have also been granted higher pay scale on\ncompletion of 9 years of service. It is submitted that thus juniors to the\noriginal petitioners have been granted the benefit of conversion of work\ncharged establishment to temporary establishment and further granted\nhigher grade on completion of 9 years of service. It is submitted that\nhowever in the entire group of petitions to which he is representing,\nmost of the original petitioners have not been granted the benefit of\nconversion from work charged establishment to temporary\nestablishment. It is submitted that in few cases conversion from work\ncharge to temporary establishment has been granted but after 10 to 15\nyears of service, instead of 5 years of service.

It\nappears that the Government came out with a new policy decision in\nform of G.R. dated 17.10.1988 issued by the Roads & Building\nDepartment of the State Government, granting substantial benefits to\nthe daily wagers of three different categories viz. unskilled; semi­skilled\nand skilled. On considering the G.R. dated 17.10.1988, it appears that\nthe State Government accepted the recommendations made by the\nexperts / committee and it has been resolved to extend certain benefits\nto the daily wager employees.\n\n[18.4] G.R. dated 17.10.1988 is a resolution of the Government\nunder which it has been resolved to extend certain benefits to the daily\nwage employees. Clause (2) of the said resolution provides that as per\nthe provisions of\nSection 25(B)\nof the ID Act, daily wage labourers who\nhave put in more than five but less than ten years of service on\n01.10.1988, shall be paid monthly wage arrived at by taking into\nconsideration the fixed monthly pay payable as per the prevailing pay­\nscale in the concerned cadre and the dearness allowance admissible\nthere on as per the prevailing rates, for the number of days present.\nBesides, 14 casual leaves including two for restricted holidays, leave of\nSundays and leave on the days of National Festivals shall be admissible\nin a year with pay and the benefits of Medical facilities and deduction\nfor General Provident Fund shall also be admissible as per the rules.\nClause (3) provides that the skilled daily wage labourers who have put\n\nPage 63 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nin more than ten years of service on 01.10.1988 shall be considered\npermanent and such permanent labourers shall be placed in the running\nscale of the prevailing pay­scale of the concerned cadre and accordingly,\npay, dearness allowances, house rent allowance, local compensatory\nallowances shall be paid to him. It is further decided to give such\npersons the benefits of superannuation, pension, gratuity, General\nProvident Fund etc. as per the prevailing rules. Further, 14 Casual leaves\nincluding two for restricted holidays, 30 earned leaves, 20 half pay\nleaves shall be admissible to them over and above the weekly leave of\nSundays and the leave on the days of National Festivals. The age­limit\nfor superannuation of the permanent labourers shall be 60 years. The\nperiod of permanent service shall be treated as qualifying service. It has\nfurther been decided that as per the provision of\nSection 25(B)\nof the ID\nAct, the skilled labourers who have completed 15 years of service on\n01.10.1988, shall be given one increment and who have completed 20\nand more than 25 years of service likewise shall be given two and three\nincrements in the prevailing pay­scale of the concerned cadre\nrespectively and their pay shall be accordingly fixed on 01.10.1988.\n\nThus, on interpretation of the new policy contained in G.R. dated\n17.10.1988, all the daily wagers working in different departments of the\nState Government shall be entitled to the benefit flowing from the G.R.\ndated 17.10.1988 only. At this stage it is required to be noted that vide\nCircular dated 31.03.1989, it was clarified that the appointment of daily\nwagers as work charged employee is banned in view of the G.Rs. Dated\n17.10.1988 and has no provision for appointment of daily wagers on\nwork charged establishment having been made vide aforesaid G.R.\nTherefore, on and after 17.10.1988 the earlier G.R. / policy shall not be\napplicable at all more particularly the G.R. dated 04.07.1973.\n\n[18.5] Identical question came to be considered by the learned\n\nPage 64 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nSingle Judge of this Court in the case of\nKarshanbhai K. Rabari & Ors.\nvs. State of Gujarat\nrendered in Special Civil Application\nNo.11071/1993 by which a similar relief was sought by those working\nas daily wagers and after considering the subsequent policy decision in\nthe form of G.Rs. Dated 17.10.1988 and by observing that the\npetitioners who are appointed as daily wagers have no right whatsoever,\nthe learned Single Judge dismissed the said petition and observed and\nheld that all those daily wagers shall be governed by the G.R. dated\n17.10.1988. The decision of the learned Single Judge in Special Civil\nApplication No.11071/1993 has been affirmed by the Division Bench\nvide order in Letters Patent Appeal No.1134/1997.\n\nIn another decision\nin the case of\nBhimjibhai Bhanjibhai Gohil vs. State of Gujarat\n\nrendered in Special Civil Application Nos.4726/2004 and\n12247/2004, the learned Single Judge rejected the prayer of those daily\nwagers who prayed for a direction to the authorities to consider their\ncase for being granted the benefits of work charged employees and\nregularization. That in\nthe said decision\nthe learned Single Judge\nconsidered the subsequent policy decision vide G.R. dated 17.10.1988.\nIn para 3 the learned Single Judge has observed and held as under:\n\n\"3. When the petitioners have been given the benefitsof the\ncircular dated 17­10­1988 and when their case for being\ntreated as work charged employees or for regularization is not\nbacked by any government resolution, their case cannot be\naccepted merely on the ground that the some other employees\nhave received the said benefits irrespective of want of\nvacancies and financial constraint of the government. It is true\nthat the petitioners are working since long, however, their case\nfor regularization cannot be considered unless they are\nselected for regular vacancies in accordance with rules. I am\nsure if in future occasion arise to grant further benefits of work\ncharge, the cases of the petitioners will be considered by the\ngovernment in accordance with the rules and their seniority.\nSubject to above observations, the petitions are rejected.\"\n\nThe said decision of the learned Single Judge has also been\n\nPage 65 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nconfirmed by the Division Bench vide order in Letters Patent Appeal\nNo.590/2007 in Special Civil Application No.4726/2004. Yet in another\ndecision in the case of Dashrathbhai Naranbhai Tadvi & Ors. vs. State\nof Gujarat & Anr. rendered in Special Civil Application\nNo.11393/2000, the learned Single Judge after following the decision\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nUmadevi\n(3) (Supra)\nrejected the said petition in which the daily wagers prayed for an\nappropriate writ, direction and order directing the State to take them on\nregular establishment on and from their passing the SSC examination\nwith all incidental benefits. Before the learned Single Judge it was the\ncase on behalf of the petitioners that they are daily wagers workmen\nworking under the Department since last more than 15 to 20 years.\n\nHowever, considering the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\ncase of\nUmadevi\n(3) (Supra) in which it is observed by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court that merely because a temporary employee or a casual\nwage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his\nappointment, he would not be absorbed in regular service or made\npermanent, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the original\nappointment was not made by following a due process of selection as\nenvisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open to the Court to prevent\nregular recruitment at the instance of temporary employees whose\nperiod of employment has come to an end or of adhoc employees who\nby the very nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. The\ndecision of the learned Single Judge has been confirmed by the Division\nBench vide order in Letters Patent Appeal No.2626/2010.\n\n[18.6] In the case of\nM.I. Isani, Executive Engineer, Surendranagar\nDistrict Panchayat\n(Supra), the Division Bench of this Court has\nspecifically observed after considering the G.R. dated 04.07.1973 that at\nthe most the said confers eligibility for being absorbed when vacancies\n\nPage 66 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\narise and if certain conditions are fulfilled. But it does not automatically\nconfers permanency.\n\n[18.7] In the case of State of Tamil Nadu Through Secretary to\nGovernment, Commercial Taxes and Registration Department,\nSecretariat and Another vs. A. Singamuthu reported in (2017) 4 SCC\n113, after considering various earlier decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt on the point, in para 8 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed\nand held as under:\n\n\"8. Part­time or casual employment is meant to serve the\nexigencies of administration. It is a settled principle of law\nthat continuance in service for long period on part­time or\ntemporary basis confers no right to seek regularisation in\nservice. The person who is engaged on temporary or casual\nbasis is well aware of the nature of his employment and he\nconsciously accepted the same at the time of seeking\nemployment. Generally, while directing that temporary or\npart­time appointments be regularised or made permanent,\nthe courts are swayed by the long period of service rendered\nby the employees. However, this may not be always a correct\napproach to adopt especially when the scheme of\nregularisation is missing from the rule book and\nregularisation casts huge financial implications on public\nexchequer.\"\n\n[18.8] In the case of\nUmadevi\n(3) (Supra), in para 48 the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court has observed and held as under:\n\n\"48. ...There is no fundamental right in those who have been\nemployed on daily­wages or temporarily or on contractual\nbasis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service.\nAs has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be\nholders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made\nonly by making appointments consistent with the\nrequirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The\nright to be treated equally with the other employees employed\non daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal\ntreatment with those who were regularly employed. That\nwould be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied\non to claim a right to be absorbed in service even though they\nhave never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment\nrules.\"\n\nPage 67 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n[18.9] In the case of\nHari Nandan Prasad vs. Employer I/R. to\nManagement of FCI and Another\nreported in (2014) 7 SCC 190 in\npara 39 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed and held as under:\n\n\"39. On harmonious reading of the two judgments discussed\nin detail above, we are of the opinion that when there are\nposts available, in the absence of any unfair labour practice\nthe Labour Court would not give direction for regularization\nonly because a worker has continued as daily wage\nworker/adhoc/temporary worker for number of years.\nFurther, if there are no posts available, such a direction for\nregularization would be impermissible. In the aforesaid\ncircumstances giving of direction to regularize such a person,\nonly on the basis of number of years put in by such a worker\nas daily wager etc. may amount to backdoor entry into the\nservice which is an anathema to\nArt.14\nof the Constitution.\nFurther, such a direction would not be given when the\nconcerned worker does not meet the eligibility requirement of\nthe post in question as per the Recruitment Rules. However,\nwherever it is found that similarly situated workmen are\nregularized by the employer itself under some scheme or\notherwise and the workmen in question who have approached\nIndustrial/Labour Court are at par with them, direction of\nregularization in such cases may be legally justified,\notherwise, non­regularization of the left over workers itself\nwould amount to invidious discrimination qua them in such\ncases and would be violative of\nArt.14\nof the Constitution.\nThus, the Industrial adjudicator would be achieving the\nequality by upholding\nArt.14\n, rather than violating this\nconstitutional provision.\"\n\n[18.10] In the case of\nKartick Chandra Mondal & Anr\n(Supra), the\nHon'ble Supreme Court has observed that merely because some other\nsimilarly placed casual workers were regularized, illegality or\nirregularity in appointments cannot be further perpetuated by\nregularizing the services of others. Thus, it is held that there cannot be\nany negative discrimination. In para 25 it is observed and held as under:\n\n\"25. Even assuming that the similarly placed persons were ordered\nto be absorbed, the same if done erroneously cannot become the\nfoundation for perpetuating further illegality. If an appointment is\nmade illegally or irregularly, the same cannot be the basis of\nfurther appointment. An erroneous decision cannot be permitted\nto perpetuate further error to the detriment of the general welfare\n\nPage 68 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nof the public or a considerable section. This has been the consistent\napproach of this Court. However, we intend to refer to a latest\ndecision of this Court on this point in the case of\nState of Bihar v.\nUpendra Narayan Singh and others\n[(2009) 5 SCC 65], the\nrelevant portion of which is extracted hereinbelow :\"\n\n\"67. By now it is settled that the guarantee of equality before\nlaw enshrined in\nArticle 14\nis a positive concept and it cannot\nbe enforced by a citizen or court in a negative manner. If an\nillegality or irregularity has been committed in favour of any\nindividual or a group of individuals or a wrong order has\nbeen passed by a judicial forum, others cannot invoke the\njurisdiction of the higher or superior court for repeating or\nmultiplying the same irregularity or illegality or for passing\nwrong order.\"\n\n[A reference in this regard may also be made to the earlier\ndecisions of this Court. See also:\n1) Faridabad CT Scan Centre v.\nD.G. Health Services and others\n[(1997) 7 SCC 752] : (1997 AIR\nSCW 3716);\n2) South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. v. State of M.P. and\nothers\n[(2003) 8 SCC 648] : (2003 AIR SCW 5258) and 3)\nMaharaj Krishan Bhatt and another v. State of J. and K. and others\n[(2008) 9 SCC 24] : (2008 AIR SCW 5421)].\"\n\n[18.11] In the case of\nPWD Employees Union and Others\n(Supra),\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court had an occasion to consider the very G.R.\ndated 17.10.1988. In\nthe said decision\nit is held that the G.R. dated\n17.10.1988 is applicable to all the daily wage workers working in\ndifferent departments of the State including Forest and Environment\nDepartment performing any nature of job. It is held that it is not limited\nonly to the daily wage workers working in building, maintenance and\nrepairing work. While considering the G.R. dated 17.10.1988, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court has observed in paragraphs 23, 24, 28 and 29 as\nunder:\n\n\"23. From a bare reading of the Resolution dated 17th October,\n1988, the following facts emerge:\n\n(a) Labour and other Unions made representation to the\nGovernment making demands and issues relating to daily\nwage workers of different departments of the\nGovernment.\n\n(b) The State Government constituted a committee under\nthe Chairmanship, Minister of Road and Building\n\nPage 69 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nDepartment.\n\n(c) The Committee was constituted for studying\n\n(i) the wages of daily wage workers;and\n\n(ii) work related services and facilities provided to\nthe daily wage workers who are engaged in the\nbuilding maintenance and repairing work in\ndifferent departments of the State.\n\n(d) The recommendations of the Committee were\naccepted and accordingly the State Government resolved\nto provide the benefits of the scheme contained in the\nResolution 17th October, 1988.\n\n24. The daily wage workers who were engaged in building\nmaintenance and repairing work in different departments were\nalready entitled for their work related facilities. Therefore, what\nwe find is that the Committee has not limited the\nrecommendation to the daily wage workers working in building\nmaintenance and repairing work in different departments of the\nState. The State Government vide its Resolution dated 17th\nOctober, 1988 has not limited it to the daily wage workers\nworking in building maintenance and repairing work. What we\nfind is that the Resolution dated 17th October, 1988 is\napplicable to all the daily wage workers working in different\ndepartments of the State including Forest and Environment\nDepartment performing any nature of job including the work\nother than building maintenance and repairing work. The\ndecision of the Full Bench of Gujarat High Court in Gujarat\nForest Producers, Gatherers and Forest Workers Union(supra\nand the subsequent Resolution dated 22nd December, 1999\nissued from Forest and Environment Department of the State, in\nour opinion are not sustainable, as the intent of Resolution dated\n17th October, 1988 was not properly explained therein and,\ntherefore, the aforesaid decision of Full Bench and Resolution\ndated 22nd December, 1999 cannot be made applicable to the\ndaily wage workers of the Forest and Environment Department\nof the State of Gujarat.\n\n28. Thus, the principal question that falls to be considered in\nthese appeals is whether in the facts and circumstances it will be\ndesirable for the Court to direct the appellants to straightaway\nregularize the services of all the daily wage workers working for\nmore than five years or the daily wage workers working for more\nthan five years are entitled for some other relief.\n\n29. As per the scheme contained in Resolution dated 17th\nOctober, 1988 all the daily wage workers were not entitled for\n\nPage 70 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nregularization or permanency in the services. As per the said\nResolution the daily wagers are entitled to the following\nbenefits:\n\n\"(i) They are entitled to daily wages as per the prevailing\nDaily Wages. If there is presence of more than 240 days\nin first year, daily wagers are eligible for paid Sunday,\nmedical allowance and national festival holidays.\n\n(ii) Daily wagers and semi skilled workers who has\nservice of more than five years and less than 10 years are\nentitled for fixed monthly salary along with dearness\nallowance as per prevailing standard, for his working\ndays. Such daily wagers will get two optional leave in\naddition to 14 misc. leave, Sunday leave and national\nfestival holidays. Such daily wagers will also be eligible\nfor getting medical allowance and deduction of provident\nfund.\n\n(iii) Daily wagers and semi skilled workers who has\nservice of more than ten years but less than 15 years are\nentitled to get minimum pay scale at par with skilled\nworker along with dearness allowance as per prevailing\nstandard, for his working days. Moreover, such daily\nwagers will get two optional leave in addition to 14 misc.\n\nleave, Sunday leave and national festival holidays.\nHe/she will be eligible for getting medical allowance and\ndeduction of provident fund.\n\n(iv) Daily wagers and semi skilled workers who has\nservice of more than 15 years will be considered as\npermanent worker and such semi skilled workers will get\ncurrent pay scale of skilled worker along with dearness\nallowance, local city allowance and house rent allowance.\nThey will get benefit as per the prevailing rules of\ngratuity, retired salary, general provident fund.\nMoreover, they will get two optional leave in addition to\n14 misc. leave, 30 days earned leave, 20 days half pay\nleave, Sunday leave and national festival holidays. The\ndaily wage workers and semi skilled who have completed\nmore than 15 years of their service will get one\nincrement, two increments for 20 years service and three\nincrements for 25 years in the current pay scale of skilled\nworkers and their salary will be fixed accordingly.\"\n\nThus, considering the aforesaid decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt as well as this Court and in view of the subsequent G.R. dated\n\nPage 71 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n17.10.1988 which shall be applicable to all the daily wagers working in\ndifferent departments of the State, all the daily wagers shall be governed\nby the G.R. dated 17.10.1988 and any violation and/or\nresolution/circular prior to 17.10.1988 shall not be applicable including\nthe G.R. dated 04.07.1973.\n\n[18.12] Now, so far as the impugned CAV common judgment passed\nby the learned Single Judge and the directions issued by the learned\nSingle Judge with respect to the daily wagers more particularly the\ndirections issued in para 148(II) by which the appellants herein -\noriginal respondents - State Government is directed to absorb all daily\nwagers - petitioners on the work charged establishment from the date\nthey were otherwise eligible to be absorbed is concerned, the same\ncannot be sustained for the reasons stated herein above. At the outset it\nis required to be noted that as such there is no much discussion by the\nlearned Single Judge so far as the daily wagers are concerned and/or\ntheir status of the daily wagers are concerned. There is no discussion at\nall with respect to the position after the G.R. dated 17.10.1988. The only\nreason which can be culled out from the impugned judgment and order\nis that as they are working since many years and in view of the earlier\nG.R. of 1973, all those daily wagers are required to be absorbed in the\nwork charged establishment. At this stage it is required to be noted that\nas such the learned Single Judge seems to have considered the G.R.\ndated 16.08.1973 which has been subsequently revoked in the year 2014\nwhich as such is with respect to the conversion of work charged\nestablishment to temporary establishment and as such the same is not\nwith respect to absorbing the daily wagers to work charged\nestablishment. Even otherwise merely because an employee has worked\nas a daily wager for 5 years or more, he shall not be automatically\nentitled to be absorbed in the work charged establishment. The order to\n\nPage 72 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nabsorb daily wagers to work establishment merely on completion of 5\nyears automatically shall be contrary to various law laid down by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in catena of decisions referred to hereinabove.\n\n[18.13] Even otherwise it is required to be noted that grant of such\ndirection to absorb all those daily wagers into work charged\nestablishment merely on completion of 5 years as daily wager would\nhave a cascading effect and chain of sequences. After they are absorbed\nin the work charged establishment they may claim the absorption in the\ntemporary establishment and may claim all other benefits which may be\navailable to the regular permanent employees and they may claim such\nbenefit despite the fact that there are no sanctioned vacant posts. Even\notherwise it is required to be noted that even as per the G.R. dated\n04.07.1973 (though the same shall not be applicable after the G.R. dated\n17.10.1988), absorption of daily wagers to work charged establishment\nwas subject to various circumstances / conditions referred to\nhereinabove. There was no automatic conversion / absorption of daily\nwagers to work charged establishment even as per the G.R. dated\n04.07.1973 (which shall not be applicable after the G.R. dated\n17.10.1988).\n\n[18.14] In view of the above, the impugned common CAV judgment\nand order passed by the learned Single Judge in terms of para 148(II) by\nwhich State Government is directed to absorb the daily wagers on the\nwork charged establishment from the date from which they were\notherwise eligible to be absorbed cannot be sustained and the same\ndeserves to be quashed and set aside. Even the example that if the daily\nwagers would have been absorbed in the year 1995, then the benefits\nwould accrue 9 years thereafter i.e. 2004 is concerned, with greatest\nrespect, it is not possible to cull out which benefits would be available to\n\nPage 73 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nsuch daily wagers who are absorbed on work charged establishment 9\nyears thereafter. Even as a work charged establishment they shall not be\nentitled to the higher pay scale / higher grade on completion of 9 years.\nThere is no clarity whatsoever so far as the same is concerned. In any\nview of the matter the directions contained in para 148(II) referred to\nhereinabove in case of daily wagers - original petitioners cannot be\nsustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside by further\nobserving that all those daily wagers shall be entitled to the benefits\nflowing from the G.R. dated 17.10.1988 and any clarificatory circulars\nonly and shall not be entitled to any benefits under any resolution /\ncircular which was in force prior to 17.10.1988. All these appeals are\nrequired to be allowed to the aforesaid extent.\n\n[19.0] Now, so far as the impugned common judgment and order\npassed by the learned Single Judge and the directions issued by the\nlearned Single Judge directing the State Government to absorb all those\nwrit applicants - work charged employees working on work charged\nestablishment in the temporary establishment is concerned, it is required\nto be noted that as such so far as the work charged employees working\non work charged establishment are concerned, the relevant G.R. would\nbe the G.R. dated 16.08.1973, which has been revoked / canceled\nsubsequently vide G.R. dated 20.08.2014. Even the learned Single Judge\nwhile passing the impugned judgment and order and issuing the\nimpugned directions has considered the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 only.\n\n[19.1] While considering the impugned common CAV judgment\nand directions issued with respect to work charged employees and\nabsorbing them into the temporary establishment, what is work charged\nestablishment and temporary establishment is required to be considered.\nThe definition of \"work charged establishment\" and \"temporary\n\nPage 74 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nestablishment\" has been provided under the Gujarat Public Works\nDepartment Manual. The definitions of \"temporary establishment\" and\n\"work charged establishment\" are as under:\n\n\"(a) Temporary Establishment:\n\n(i) In order to meet the demand for extra supervision which\nmay arise from time to time as well as to ensure that the Public\nWorks establishments shall be capable of contraction as well as\nof expansion at the expenditure on works diminishes or\nincreases the permanent establishments may be supplemented\nby temporary establishments to such extent as may be necessary\nand varying in strength from time to time according to the\nnature of the work to be done. Temporary establishment will\ninclude all such non­permanent establishment no matter under\nwhat titles employed as is entertained for the general purposes\nof a Division or Subdivision or for the purpose of the general\nsupervision as distinct from the actual execution of a work or\nworks.\n\n(ii) If member of temporary establishment are engaged for a\nspecial work, their engagement lasts only for the period during\nwhich the work last. All the temporary appointments should\nalways be made \"until further order\" and the persons so\nappointed should clearly be given to understand that they are\nliable to be discharged at any time without any reasons being\ngiven.

The setting up and continuation of work charged\nestablishment is dependent upon the Government\nundertaking, project or a scheme of a work and the availability\nof the fund for executing it. The employees engaged in the\nwork charged establishment, their nature of work and duties\nperformed by them, their recruitment and condition of\nservices are different than those employed in the regular\nestablishment. The regular establishment and the work\ncharged establishment, both are two separate types of\nestablishment and the employees employed on those\nestablishments, thus form two separate and distinct classes.\"\n\n[19.3] In the case of\nKunji Raman\n(Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt had an occasion to consider the difference between the work\ncharged establishment and the regular establishment.\n\nAfter considering\nthe decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nJaswant Singh\nand Others vs. Union of India and Others\nreported in (1979) 4 SCC\n440, in paras 6 and 8, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed and held\nas under:\n\n\"6. A work­charged establishment as pointed out by this\n\nPage 78 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nCourt in\nJaswant Singh v. Union of India\nbroadly means an\nestablishment of which the expenses, including the wages and\nallowances of the staff, fare chargeable to \"works\". The pay and\nallowances of employees who are borne on a work­charged\nestablishment are generally shown as a separate sub­head of the\nestimated cost of the works. The work­charged employees are\nengaged on a temporary basis and their appointments are made\nfor the execution of a specified work. From the very nature of\ntheir employment, their services automatically come to an end on\nthe completion of the works for the sole purpose of which they\nare employed. Thus a work­charged establishment is materially\nand qualitatively different from a regular establishment.\n\n8. A work­charged establishment thus differs from a regular\nestablishment which is permanent in nature. Setting up and\ncontinuance of a work­charged establishment is dependent upon\nthe Government undertaking a project or a scheme or a 'work'\nand availability of fund for executing it. So far as employees\nengaged on work­charged establishments are concerned, not only\ntheir recruitment and service conditions but the nature of work\nand duties to be performed by them are not the same as those of\nthe employees of the regular establishment. A regular\nestablishment and a work­charged establishment are two\nseparate types of establishments and the persons employed on\nthose establishments thus form two separate and distinct\nclasses.....\"\n\n[19.4] The Division Bench of this Court in the case of\nK.N. Thanaki\nand Ors.\n(Supra) has specifically observed and held that on completion\nof certain number of years, the work charged employees become eligible\nfor absorption as temporary servants, but that does not mean that they\nbecome entitled to be appointed and retained as temporary employees\nimmediately after have become eligible to be absorbed as temporary\nemployees. It is held that their actual absorption has to take place in\naccordance with their seniority and availability of posts.\n\nIn the case before the Division Bench the grievance of the\npetitioners who were work charged employees was that even though\nthey had completed 5 years of service as work charged employees, they\nare not treated as temporary government servants and not given all the\nbenefits on that basis.\n\nPage 79 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n[19.5] Even considering the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 on which the\nreliance has been placed by the work charged employees and which has\nbeen relied upon and considered by the learned Single Judge while\nissuing the impugned directions, it appears that the decision was taken\nby the State Government that various posts of work charged\nestablishment in respect of only maintenance and repairs of any works\nor irrigation management which are either required permanently or a\nvery long term basis be converted into temporary posts and work\ncharged posts to that extent should be abolished. Assuming that the said\nresolutions shall be applicable to all the Departments and not in respect\nof any only maintenance and repairs of any works\n,\nin that case\nalso, as\nobserved by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of\nK.N. Thanaki\nand Ors.\n(Supra), there shall not be any automatic absorption of work\ncharged employees into temporary establishment on mere completion of\ntheir 5 years of service as work charged. Same shall be subject to\navailability of posts in the temporary establishment and subject to their\nseniority etc.\n\nAs observed by the Division Bench of this Court in the\naforesaid decision in the case of\nK.N. Thanaki and Ors.\n(Supra), all those\nwork charged employees in the work charged establishment who have\nworked for more than 5 years shall be eligible to consider their case for\nabsorption into temporary establishment, but there shall not be any\nautomatic absorption in the temporary establishment. Therefore,\nassuming that the subsequent G.R. of 2014 by which the earlier G.R.\ndated 16.08.1973 is revoked / cancelled shall not be applicable\nretrospectively and may be applicable prospectively\n,\nin that case\nalso,\nthe direction which could have been issued by the learned Single Judge\nwould have been to direct the State Government to consider the case of\nall those work charged employees who have worked for more than 5\nyears on work charged establishment as per the G.R. dated 16.08.1973,\nwhich was applicable prior to the G.R. of 2014. Therefore, the impugned\n\nPage 80 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndirection of the learned Single Judge so far as the work charged\nemployees are concerned that all the work charged employees who have\nworked for more than 5 years shall be converted into temporary\nestablishment on completion of their 5 years of service as work charge\ncannot be sustained and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.\n\n[19.6] Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the State that in\nview of the subsequent circular dated 03.02.1987 and in view of the\nprohibition on the new recruitment on work charged establishment the\nappointments of work charged employees can be said to be illegal is\nconcerned, at the outset it is required to be noted that merely because all\nthose persons are continued as work charged even after the ban / bar,\ntheir appointment cannot be said to be per se illegal. It is the State\nGovernment who continued them as work charged despite the resolution\n/ circular declaring the prohibition on new recruitment on work charged\nestablishment. The State cannot be permitted to take the benefit of its\nown wrong. All those seem to have been continued as work charged\nlooking to the need of the work and the requirement. Therefore, the\nsubmission on behalf of the State that in view of the circular dated\n03.02.1987 declaring the prohibition on new recruitment on work\ncharged establishment, the continuation of the concerned work charged\nemployees is illegal, cannot be accepted.\n\n[19.7] Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the petitioners -\nwork charged employees that in between so many other work charged\nemployees including some of the petitioners are absorbed in the\ntemporary establishment is concerned, it is true that some of the\ndepartments have granted the benefit of absorption and the G.R. dated\n16.08.1973 and made some of the work charged employees working on\nwork charged establishment into the temporary establishment on\n\nPage 81 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ncompletion of their 5 years' service as work charged. However, as\nobserved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nKartick Chandra\nMondal\n(Supra), the guarantee of equality before law enshrined in\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution is a positive concept and it cannot be\nenforced by a citizen or Court in a negative manner. It is further\nobserved and held that even assuming that similarly placed persons were\nordered to be absorbed, the same if done erroneously cannot become the\nfoundation for perpetuating further illegality.\n\nIn\nthe said decision\nthe\nHon'ble Supreme Court has taken into consideration the observations\nmade in para 67 of the earlier decision in the case of\nState of Bihar v.\nUpendra Narayan Singh and others\nreported in (2009) 5 SCC 65.\nTherefore, merely because earlier some similarly placed persons / work\ncharged employees including some of the petitioners are granted the\nbenefit of absorption in the temporary establishment on completion of 5\nyears' service as work charged, the petitioners cannot claim the same\nclaiming violation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nAs observed\nherein above and even as per the decision of the Division Bench of this\nCourt in the case of\nK.N. Thanaki and Ors.\n(Supra), there is no\nautomatic absorption in temporary establishment after 5 years of service\nas work charged. The cases are required to be considered for absorption\nin a temporary establishment after completion of 5 years as work\ncharged subject to availability of posts in the temporary establishment\nand as per the seniority etc.\n\n[19.8] From the impugned common judgment and order passed by\nthe learned Single Judge it appears that before the learned Single Judge\nand even before this Court the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe original petitioners heavily relied upon the decision of the learned\nSingle Judge of this Court in the case of Rashmikaben Trikamlal and\nOrs. (Supra) by which the learned Single Judge directed the State to\n\nPage 82 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ngrant the benefit of higher pay scale under the scheme of 9­18­27 years\nof service to those employees working on work charged establishment,\non the date on which they completed 5 years of service is concerned, at\nthe outset it is required to be noted that in the said decision all those\nwork charged were converted to temporary establishment and the\nlearned Single Judge directed to grant the benefit of higher pay scale. It\nis true that in the said decision the learned Single Judge observed that\non completion of 5 years of service they are deemed to have been\nconverted from work charged establishment to temporary establishment\nand therefore, they shall be entitled to the benefit of higher pay scale\nunder the scheme of 9­18­27 years on completion of 9 years of service\nfrom the date on which they deemed to have been converted from work\ncharged establishment to temporary establishment. However, it is\nrequired to be noted that the said decision was challenged before the\nDivision Bench by way of Letters Patent Appeal No.1360/2011 and the\nDivision Bench dismissed the said appeal and confirmed the order\npassed by the learned Single Judge, however the Division Bench\nspecifically made it clear that order of dismissal of appeal may not be\ntreated as a precedent. Therefore, once the Division Bench specifically\nobserved and made it clear that the dismissal of appeal confirming the\norder passed by the learned Single Judge in Special Civil Application\nNo.7464/1996 may not be treated as a precedent, normally the same\ncannot be relied upon as the same is to be treated and/or confined to\nthose petitioners also and the same cannot be treated as a precedent.\n\nWhile considering the aforesaid decision the learned Single Judge\nhas not at all considered the observations made by the Division Bench in\nLetters Patent Appeal No.1360/2011 that the said order may not be\ntreated as a precedent. The learned Single Judge seems to have\nproceeded on the premise that the decision of the learned Single Judge\nin Special Civil Application No.7464/1996 has been confirmed by the\n\nPage 83 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nDivision Bench without any further observation (in the present case the\nobservation that the same may not be treated as a precedent).\n\n[19.9] It is true that in many of the cases the concerned petitioners\nare continued as work charged employees in the work charged\nestablishment since many years and therefore, there shall be a\npresumption that the nature of work is permanent. However, the same is\nrequired to be considered while applying the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 and\nwhile considering their cases for absorption in the temporary\nestablishment. From the impugned judgment and order passed by the\nlearned Single Judge, there is no factual data available before the\nlearned Single Judge with respect to the number of persons working in\nthe work charged establishment; on which posts they are working as\nwork charged; in which department they are working; since how many\nyears they are working; how many posts in the temporary establishment\nwere available. The learned Single Judge has passed the impugned\njudgment and order mainly on the ground that all those petitioners -\nwork charged employees working in the work charged establishment are\nworking since many years and that they shall be entitled to benefit of\nabsorption as per the G.R. of the year 1973 and that subsequent G.R. of\n2014 canceling / withdrawing the earlier G.R. of 1973 shall not be made\navailable retrospectively. The learned Single Judge is right in observing\nthat the subsequent G.R. of 2014 withdrawing / revoking the earlier\nG.R. of 1973 cannot be made applicable retrospectively but at the same\ntime the finding recorded by the learned Single Judge that on\ncompletion of 5 years of service as work charged in the work charged\nestablishment automatically they shall be entitled to be absorbed in the\ntemporary establishment cannot be sustained. Number of\ncircumstances/conditions are required to be considered while converting\nthe work charged establishment into the temporary establishment even\n\nPage 84 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nas per the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 which was applicable prior to the G.R.\nof 2014 and therefore, the State Government / concerned Departments\nof the State Government in which the respective petitioners are serving\nas work charged employees in the work charged establishment are to be\ndirected to consider the case of all those petitioners - work charged\nemployees who are not absorbed in the temporary establishment to\nabsorb them in the temporary establishment as per the G.R. dated\n16.08.1973.\n\n[20.0] Therefore, in light of the above finding and the\nobservations, under normal circumstances, the matters are required to\nbe remanded / sent back to the Government to undertake the exercise\nviz. when the posts in temporary establishment had fallen vacant; how\nmany posts had fallen vacant; whether there was a requirement and/or\nwork or not? However, considering the fact that in most of the cases the\nwork charged employees have worked for more than three decades,\nconsidering the object and purpose of the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 and for\nthe reasons stated hereinbelow, we do not propose to send back the\nmatters to the State Government after number of years.\n\n[20.1] It is required to be noted that the concerned work charged\nemployees have worked and are working since last three decades.\nTherefore, it can safely be presumed and it cannot be disputed that there\nwas / is work and their services were required and they have\ncontinuously worked for approximately three decades. Even as per the\nG.R. dated 16.08.1973 which shall be applicable pre­G.R. Of 2014,\nvarious posts of work charged establishment in respect of maintenance\nand repairs of any works or irrigation management which are either\nrequired permanently or very long term basis be converted to permanent\nposts and work charge posts to that extent should be abolished. The G.R.\n\nPage 85 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndated 16.08.1973 reads as under:\n\n\"Conversion of work­charged posts\nMaintenance repairs and\nIrrigation management under P.W.D.\ninto temporary establishment.\n\nGovernment of Gujarat,\nPublic Works Department,\nResolution EC­WCE­ 1272(2)­G,\nDated the 16th August, 1973.\n\nRead:­ Govt.

The question of conversion of work charged posts\nhas been re­considered by Govt.

This issues with the concurrence of Finance Department vide\nits not, dated 10­7­73 on this Department's file of even number.\"\n\n[20.2] Therefore, on fair reading of the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 the\nobject and purpose of the G.R. dated 16.08.1973 seems to be to convert\nvarious posts of work charged establishment which are either required\npermanently or very long term basis be converted into temporary posts\nprovided that such work charged posts should have been continuously in\nexistence for a minimum period of 5 years and are required either\npermanently or on very long term basis say 10 to 15 years. In the present\ncase all the work charged employees have worked for very long term\nbasis i.e. for three decades. Therefore, as such the concerned work\ncharged employees are required to be absorbed in temporary\nestablishment and on conversion and/or absorption into temporary\nestablishment, they shall be entitled to all the benefits which may be\navailable to the employees working in the temporary establishment. At\nthis stage it is required to be noted that as such many departments have\nalready granted such benefits to some of the employees and some work\ncharged employees are converted into temporary establishment as per\nthe G.R. dated 16.08.1973. Therefore, it is held that all those respective\npetitioners - work charged employees were / are required to be\nconverted to temporary establishment, but as observed herein above, not\nautomatically on completion of their 5 years of service as work charged\nemployees. Consequently, they shall be entitled to all the benefits which\nmay be available to the employees working on temporary establishment.\n\n[20.3] However, next question which is posed for consideration of\nthis Court is from which date such benefit should be granted to the\nconcerned respective petitioners. At this stage it is required to be noted\nthat as such some of the original petitioners - employees are already\n\nPage 87 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ngranted the benefit of G.R. dated 16.08.1973 before many years and\nthey are converted to temporary establishment long back. However, they\nare claiming that they ought to have been converted to temporary\nestablishment immediately on completion of 5 years of service as work\ncharged. Some of the work charged employees who are converted to\ntemporary establishment are already granted the benefit flowing from\ntheir conversion to temporary establishment. However, according to\nsome of the petitioners they are granted the benefit belatedly and they\nshall be entitled to the benefits immediately on completion of 5 years of\nservice as work charged as according to them they ought to have been\nconverted to temporary establishment immediately on completion their\n5 years of service as work charged. In case of some of the petitioners\nthough they are converted from work charged to temporary\nestablishment, they are not granted the benefit/s on their conversion to\ntemporary establishment more particularly the benefit of higher pay\nscale on completion of either 9, 18 and 27 years of service on such\ntemporary establishment. It is the case on behalf of the State that as all\nof them have approached this Court belatedly, on the ground of delay\nand laches the learned Single Judge ought not to have entertained the\npetitions. However, the same cannot be accepted. At the most, as\nobserved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nShiv Dass\n\n(Supra),the reliefs and/or actual monetary benefits can be restricted to\nthree years preceding filing of the petitions. If such a course is adopted\n,\n\nin that case\n, the concerned petitioners shall get the benefit of the G.R.\ndated 16.08.1973 and the benefits which may be available to the\ntemporary establishment employees and they are non­suited on the\nground of delay and laches and at the same time the State also may not\nhave to bear the heavy financial burden as it is reported that the\nfinancial burden upon the State would be approximately Rs.400 Crores\nto Rs.500 Crores. Therefore, the relief sought is required to be moulded\n\nPage 88 of 90\n\nDownloaded on : Sun Sep 22 00:23:11 IST 2019\n\nC/LPA/380/2016 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nto strike balance and therefore, we are of the opinion that if the actual\nmonetary benefits are restricted to 3 years preceding the filing of the\npetition/s, it shall meet the ends of justice.\n\n[21.0] In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, all\nthese Letters Patent Appeals are partly allowed to the extent quashing\nand setting aside the impugned directions in case of daily wagers and\nthe direction that on completion of their 5 years' service they shall be\nabsorbed in the workcharged establishment and they shall be paid all\nconsequential benefits, is hereby quashed and set aside. However, all\nthose daily wagers shall be entitled to the benefits flowing from the G.R.\ndated 17.10.1988 and if not paid, they shall be paid such benefits\naccordingly.\n\n[21.1] So far as the impugned direction/s in respect of\nworkcharged employees namely all those workcharged employees to be\nabsorbed / converted to temporary establishment on their completion of\n5 years' service and they shall be paid the consequential benefits\naccordingly is hereby quashed and set aside and is modified to the extent\nand it is held that all those petitioners - workcharged employees who\nhave worked for more than 20 years as workcharged employees shall be\nentitled to conversion to temporary establishment as per the G.R. dated\n16.08.1973 from the date on which they complete 20 years of service as\nworkcharged and they shall be entitled to all the benefits which may be\navailable to the employees working in the temporary establishment,\nincluding the benefit of higher pay scale / grade if at all the same is\nbeing paid to the employees working in the temporary establishment,\nhowever they shall be paid the arrears on such conversion to temporary\nestablishment for the period preceding 3 years of filing of the respective\npetitions.
