REP.BY PUB.PROSECUTOR Respondent(s)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nA.K. PATNAIK, J.\n\nThis is an appeal against the judgment dated 11th December, 2006\nof the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 544 of 2003.\n\n2. The facts briefly are that an FIR was lodged by Gynaneshwar\nJaiswal on 4.4.1999 at 2.15 p.m. in Mangalhat Police Station,\nHyderabad. In the FIR it was stated by the informant that his daughter\nMeenakshi Jaiswal was married to the appellant on 22.2.1996 and at the\ntime of marriage he gave sufficient gold jewellery, silver items,\nfurniture, electrophinic gadgets etc., worth above Rs.2,50,000/- but\never since her marriage, she was subjected to physical and mental\ntorture by her husband Vipin Jaiswal, her husband's parents Prem Kumar\nJaiswal and Yashoda Bai and her husband's sister Supriya and her\nhusband and they all brutally assaulted her on innumerable occasions\nfor not getting sufficient dowry. It was further stated in the FIR\nthat on 2.4.1999 the informant received a call from the appellant and\nhe went to the house of the appellant along with his relatives to find\nout what had happened as well as to give invitation for a function at\nhis place but they all abused him and the appellant physically\nassaulted and pushed him out from the house but fearing the safety of\nhis daughter and her welfare, he did not report the matter to the\npolice. It is further stated in the FIR that on 4.4.1999 at about 1.00\np.m. when he came back home, he was informed on telephone by his son\nthat Meenakshi had received severe burn injuries and as a result died\nin the house of the appellant. The police registered a Criminal Case\nunder\nSection 304B\n, IPC and took up investigation and submitted a\ncharge-sheet against the appellant and his other relatives under\n\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\n, IPC.\n\n3. At the trial, besides other witnesses, the prosecution\nexamined the father of the deceased (informant) as PW 1, the cousin of\nPW 1 as PW 2 and the mother of the deceased as PW 4. The appellant\nvolunteered to be a witness and got examined himself as DW 1 and took\nthe defence that the deceased had left behind a suicide note written\nby her one day before her death in which she has stated that she had\ncommitted suicide not on account of any harassment by the appellant\nand her family members but due to the harassment by her own parents.\nThe Trial Court, however, disbelieved the defence and convicted the\nappellant and his other relatives under\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\n, IPC.\nThe Trial Court in particular held that there was material that two\ndays prior to the death of the deceased, her father (PW1) and his\nrelative (PW2) were called by her and told that she has been harassed\nby the appellant and her in laws for not being paid the amount\ndemanded by the appellant and when PWs 1 and 2 went to the house of\nthe appellant, they were abused by the appellant and on 4.4.1999, PW 1\nand others were informed by one Suresh Kumar, a neighbour of the\nappellant, about the incident. From the aforesaid and other evidence,\nthe Trial Court came to the conclusion that the deceased was subjected\nto torture and harassment by the accused, mainly for the reason that\nan amount of Rs.50,000/- was not given to the appellant by PW 1. The\nappellant and other relatives of the appellant carried Criminal Appeal\nNo. 544 of 2003 before the High Court and by the impugned judgment,\nthe High Court acquitted the two other relatives of the appellant (A2\nand A3) but maintained the conviction of the appellant under\nSections\n304B\nand\n498A\n, IPC.\n\n4. At the hearing before us, learned senior counsel for the\nappellant submitted that the findings of the Trial Court and of the\nHigh Court with regard to the demand of dowry are in relation to the\ndemand of Rs.50,000/-. He submitted that this demand of Rs.50,000/- is\nnot mentioned in the FIR (Ext. P1). He further submitted that in any\ncase, the evidence of PW1 and PW4 is clear that this demand of\nRs.50,000/- by the appellant was not a dowry demand but an amount\nwhich the appellant wanted from the family of the deceased to purchase\na computer and set up his own business. He further submitted that the\nTrial Court and the High Court ought not to have disbelieved the\nsuicide note (Ext. D19) which was in the handwriting of the deceased\nas proved by DW1. In this context, he explained that the signature on\nthe suicide note (Ext. D19) purporting to be that of the deceased,\ntallied with the signature of the deceased in Ext. D1 which was a hall\nticket issued by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Open University for an examination\nwhich the deceased took in March, 1998.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the State, on the other hand, submitted\nthat both the Trial Court and the High Court have discussed the\nevidence of the prosecution witnesses, and in particular, the evidence\nof PWs 1, 2 and 4 to establish that there was demand of dowry of not\nonly Rs.50,000/- but other items as well. He further submitted that\n\nSection 2\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 defines 'dowry' as any\nproperty or valuable security given or agreed to be given either\ndirectly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage in\nconnection with the marriage of the parties to the marriage. He\nsubmitted that the expression “in connection with the marriage of the\nparties to the marriage” is wide enough to cover the demand of\nRs.50,000/- made by the appellant for purchase of a computer. He\nfurther submitted that so far as the suicide note (Ext. D19) is\nconcerned, the same cannot be believed to have been written by the\ndeceased who was only a matriculate and the High Court has given good\nreasons in the impugned judgment why the suicide note cannot be\nbelieved to have been written by the deceased. He argued that in any\ncase only on the basis of the evidence given by DW1, the Court cannot\nhold that the suicide note had been written by the deceased and\nnot by someone else. He submitted that since the prosecution has been\nable to prove that the deceased had been subjected to not only a\ndemand of dowry but also cruelty soon before her death, the\nTrial Court and the High Court have rightly held the appellant\nguilty both under\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\n, IPC.\n\n6. We have perused the evidence of PW 1 and PW 4, the\nfather and mother of the deceased respectively. We find that PW 1 has\nstated that at the time of marriage, gold, silver articles, ornaments,\nT.V., fridge and several other household articles worth more than\nRs.2,50,000/- were given to the appellant and after the marriage, the\ndeceased joined the appellant in his house at Kagaziguda. He has,\nthereafter, stated that the appellant used to work in a xerox cum type\ninstitute in Nampally and in the sixth month after marriage, the\ndeceased came to their house and told them that the appellant asked\nher to bring Rs.50,000/- from them as he was intending to purchase a\ncomputer and set up his own business. Similarly, PW4 has stated in her\nevidence that five months after the marriage, the appellant sent her\naway to their house and when she questioned her, she told that the\nappellant was demanding Rs.50,000/- and that the demand for money is\nto purchase a computer to start his own business. Thus, the evidence\nof PW1 and PW4 is that the demand of Rs.50,000/- by the appellant was\nmade six months after the marriage and that too for purchasing a\ncomputer to start his own business. It is only with regard to this\ndemand of Rs.50,000/- that the Trial Court has recorded a finding of\nguilt against the appellant for the offence under\nSection 304B\n, IPC\nand it is only in relation to this demand of Rs.50,000/- for purchase\nof a computer to start a business made by the appellant six months\nafter the marriage that the High Court has also confirmed the findings\nof the Trial Court with regard to guilt of the appellant under\nSection\n304B\n, IPC. In our view, both the Trial Court and the High Court failed\nto appreciate that the demand, if at all made by the appellant on the\ndeceased for purchasing a computer to start a business six months\nafter the marriage, was not in connection with the marriage and was\nnot really a 'dowry demand' within the meaning of\nSection 2\nof the\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961. This Court has held in\nAppasaheb & Anr.\nVs. State of Maharashtra\n(2007) 9 SCC 721:\n\n“In view of the aforesaid definition of the word \"dowry\"\nany property or valuable security should be given or agreed to\nbe given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time\nafter the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the\nsaid parties. Therefore, the giving or taking of property or\nvaluable security must have some connection with the marriage of\nthe parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of\nproperty or valuable security with the marriage of the parties\nis essential. Being a penal provision it has to be strictly\nconstrued. Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or\npractice in India. It is well settled principle of\ninterpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with\nreference to a particular trade, business or transaction and\nwords are used which everybody conversant with that trade,\nbusiness or transaction knows or understands to have a\nparticular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as\nhaving that particular meaning. (See\nUnion of India v. Garware\nNylons Ltd.\n,\nAIR (1996) SC 3509 and Chemicals and Fibres of\nIndia v. Union of India\n, AIR (1997) SC 558).”\n\n7. In any case, to hold an accused guilty of both the offences\nunder\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\n, IPC, the prosecution is required to\nprove beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was subjected to\ncruelty or harassment by the accused. From the evidence of the\nprosecution witnesses, and in particular PW1 and PW4, we find that\nthey have made general allegations of harassment by the appellant\ntowards the deceased and have not brought in evidence any specific\nacts of cruelty or harassment by the appellant on the deceased. On the\nother hand, DW1 in his evidence has stated that on 4.4.1999, the day\nwhen the incident occurred, he went to the nearby temple along with\nhis mother (A2) and his father (A3) went to the bazar to bring ration\nand his wife (deceased) alone was present at the house and at about\n1.00 p.m., they were informed by somebody that some smoke was coming\nout from their house and their house was burning. Immediately he and\nhis mother rushed to their house and by that time there was a huge\ngathering at the house and the police was also present. He and his\nfamily members were arrested by the police and after one month they\nwere released on bail. What DW1 has further stated is relevant for the\npurpose of his defence and is quoted hereinbelow:\n\n“While cleaning our house we found a chit on our dressing\ntable. The said chit was written by my wife and it is in her\nhandwriting and it also contains her signature. Ex. D 19 is the\nsaid chit. I identified the handwriting of my wife in Ex. D19\nbecause my wife used to write chits for purchasing of monthly\nprovisions as such on tallying the said chit and Ex. D19 I came\nto know that it was written by my wife only. Immediately I took\nthe Ex. D19 to the P.S. Mangalhat and asked them to receive but\nthey refused to take the same.”\n\nFrom the aforesaid evidence, it is clear that while cleaning the house\nthe appellant came across a chit written in the handwriting of his\nwife and containing her signature. This chit has been marked as Ext.\nD19 and the appellant has identified the handwriting and signature of\nthe deceased in Ext. D19 which is written in Hindi. The English\ntranslation of Ext.D19 reproduced in the impugned judgment of the High\nCourt is extracted hereinbelow:\n\n“I, Meenakshi W/o Vipin Kumar, do hereby execute and commit\nto writing this in my sound mind, consciousness and senses and\nwith my free will and violation to the effect that nobody is\nresponsible for my death. My parents family members have\nharassed much to my husband. I am taking this step as I have fed\nup with his life. Due to me the quarrels are taking place here,\nas such I want to end my life and I beg to pardon by all.”\n\nIt appears from Ext. D19 that the deceased has written the chit\naccording to her free will saying that nobody was responsible for her\ndeath and that her parents and family members have harassed her\nhusband and she was taking the step as she was fed up with her life\nand because of her quarrels were taking place.\n\n8. When the appellant, who is the husband of the deceased, has\nsaid in his evidence as DW1 that the aforesaid chit (Ext. D19) has\nbeen written by the deceased herself and has been signed by her and it\nalso appears from his evidence quoted above that he was acquainted\nwith her handwriting and signature, the Trial Court and the High Court\ncould have recorded a finding one way or the other by comparing her\nhandwriting and signature with some of her other handwritings and\nsignatures under\nSection 73\nof the Evidence Act. In the alternative,\nthe Trial Court and the High Court could have sought for an expert's\nopinion under\nSection 45\nof the Evidence Act on whether the\nhandwriting and signature were that of the deceased. But\nunfortunately, neither the Trial Court nor the High Court have\nresorted to these provisions of the\nEvidence Act\nand instead by their\nown imaginary reasoning disbelieved the defence of the appellant that\nExt.D19 could not have been written by the deceased.\n\n9. In our considered opinion, the evidence of DW1 (the\nappellant) and Ext.D19 cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution\nstory that the deceased was subjected to harassment or cruelty in\nconnection with demand of dowry. In our view, onus was on the\nprosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the ingredient of\nSection\n498A\n, IPC and the essential ingredient of offence under Section 498A\nis that the accused, as the husband of the deceased, has subjected her\nto cruelty as defined in the Explanation to\nSection 498A\n, IPC.\n\nSimilarly, for the Court to draw the presumption under\nSection 113B\nof\nthe Evidence Act that the appellant had caused dowry death as defined\nin\nSection 304B\n, IPC, the prosecution has to prove besides the demand\nof dowry, harassment or cruelty caused by the accused to the deceased\nsoon before her death. Since the prosecution has not been able to\nprove beyond reasonable doubt this ingredient of harassment or\ncruelty, neither of the offences under\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\n, IPC has\nbeen made out by the prosecution.\n\n10. We accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the impugned\njudgment of the High Court and that of the Trial Court and direct that\nthe bail bond furnished by the appellant shall stand discharged.\n\n............................J.\n(A.K.
