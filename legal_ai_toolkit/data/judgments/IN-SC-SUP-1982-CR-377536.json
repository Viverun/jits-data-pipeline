[On behalf of Chandrachud, C.J., A.C.\nGupta, N.L. Untwalia, JJ. and on his own behalf].\nThe right to life is not one of the rights mentioned in\n\nArticle 19 (1)\nof the Constitution and the six fundamental\nfreedoms guaranteed under\nArticle 19(1)\nare not absolute\nrights. The condition precedent for the applicability of\n\nArticle 19\nis that the activity which the impugned law\nprohibits and penalises, must be within the purview of and\nprotection of\nArticle 19 (1).\n[173 E, 174 A, B-C]\nState of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala, [1957] SCR\n874 @ 920; Fatechand Himmatlal and Ors. v. State of\nMaharashtra, [1977] 2 SCR 828 @ 840; A.K. Gopalan v. The\nState of Madras, [1950] 1 SCR 88, followed.\n2. The\nIndian Penal Code\n, particularly those of its\nprovisions which cannot be justified on the ground of\nunreasonableness with reference to any of the specified\nheads, such as \"public order\" in clauses (2), (3) and (4) is\nnot a law imposing restrictions on any of the rights\nconferred by\nArticle 19 (1).\nThere are several offences\nunder the Penal Code, such as, theft, cheating, ordinary\nassault, which do not violate or affect \"public order\", but\nonly \"law and order\". These offences injure only specific\nindividuals as distinguished from the public at large. It is\nnow settled that \"public order\" means \"even tempo of the\nlife of the community\". That being so, even all murders do\nnot disturb or affect \"public order\". Some murders may be of\npurely private significance and the injury or harm resulting\ntherefrom affects only specific individuals, and,\nconsequently, such murders may not be covered by \"public\norder\" within the contemplation of clauses (2), (3) and (4)\nof\nArticle 19.\nSuch murders do not lead to public disorder\nbut to disorder simpliciter. Yet, no rational being can say\nthat punishment of such murderers is not in the general\npublic interest. It may be noted that general public\ninterest is not specified as a head in clauses (2) to (4) on\nwhich restriction on the rights mentioned in clause (i) of\nthe Article may be justified.\n[181 D-H, 182 A-B]\nThe real distinction between the areas of \"law and\norder\" and \"public order\" lies not merely in the nature or\nquality of the act, but in the degree and extent. Violent\ncrimes similar in nature, but committed in different\ncontexts and circumstances might cause different reactions.\nA murder committed in given circumstances may cause only a\nslight tremor, the wave length of which does not extend\nbeyond the parameters of law and order. Another murder\ncommitted in different context and circumstances may unleash\na tidal wave of such intensity, gravity and magnitude, that\nits impact throws out of gear the even flow of life.\nNonetheless, the fact remains that for such murders which do\nnot affect \"public order\", even the provision for life\nimprisonment in\nsection 302\n, Indian Penal Code, as an\nalternative punishment, would not be justifiable under\nclauses (2), (3) and (4) as a reasonable restriction in the\ninterest of \"public order\". Such a construction must,\ntherefore, be avoided. Thus construed,\nArticle 19\nwill be\nattracted only to such laws, the provisions of which are\ncapable of being tested under clauses (2) to (5) of\nArticle\n19.\n[182 B-E]\nR.S. Cooper v. Union of India, [1970] 3 SCR 530; Maneka\nGandhi v. Union of India, [1978] 2 SCR 621; Dr. Ram Manohar\nLohia's case, [1966]1 SCR 709; Hardhan Saha and Anr. v.\nState of West Bengal, [1975] 1 SCR 778@ 784, followed.\n3. From the decided cases of the Supreme Court, it is\nclear that the test of direct and indirect effect was not\nscrapped. Indeed there is no dispute that the test of \"pith\nand substance\" of the subject-matter and of direct and of\nincidental effect of legislation is a very useful test to\ndetermine the question of legislative competence, i.e., in\nascertaining whether an Act falls under one Entry\nwhile incidentally encroaching upon another Entry. Even for\ndetermining the validity of a legislation on the ground of\ninfringement of fundamental rights, the subject matter and\nthe object of the legislation are not altogether irrelevant.\nFor instance, if the subject matter of the legislation\ndirectly covers any of the fundamental freedoms mentioned in\n\nArticle 19 (1).\nIt must pass the test of reasonable ness\nunder the relevant head in clauses (2) to (6) of that\nArticle. If the legislation does not directly deal with any\nof the rights in\nArticle 19 (1)\n, that may not conclude the\nenquiry. It will have to be ascertained further whether by\nits direct and immediate operation, the impugned legislation\nabridges any of the rights enumerated in\nArticle 19 (1).\n\n[189 B-D]\nThe mere fact that the impugned law incidentally,\nremotely or collaterally has the effect of abridging or\nabrogating those rights, will not satisfy the test. If the\nanswer to the above queries be in the affirmative, the\nimpugned law in order to be valid must pass the test of\nreasonableness under\nArticle 19.\nBut if the impact of the\nlaw on any of the rights under clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nis\nmerely incidental, indirect, remote or collateral and is\ndependent upon factors which may or may not come into play,\nthe anvil of\nArticle 19\nwill not be available for judging\nits validity.

State of Maharashtra and Anr.,\n[1966] 3 SCR 744; Bennett Coleman's case, AIR 1973 SC 106,\nreferred to.\n4.\nSection 299\ndefines \"culpable homicide\" and\nsection\ndefines culpable homicide amounting to murder.\nSection\nprescribes death or imprisonment for life as penalty for\nmurder. It cannot, reasonably or rationally, be contended\nthat any of the rights mentioned in\nArticle 19 (1)\nof the\nConstitution confers the freedom to commit murder or, for\nthe matter of that, the freedom to commit any offence\nwhatsoever. Therefore, penal laws, that is to say laws which\ndefine offences and prescribe punishment for the commission\nof offences do not attract the application of\nArticle 19\n(1).\nIt cannot be said that the object of the penal laws is\ngenerally such as not to involve any violation of the rights\nconferred by\nArticle 19 (1)\nbecause after the decision of\nthis Court in the Bank Nationalisation case the theory, that\nthe object and form of the State action alone determine the\nextent of protection that may be claimed by an individual\nand that the effect of the State action on the fundamental\nright of the individual is irrelevant, stands discredited.\nBut the point of the matter is that, in pith and substance,\npenal laws do not deal with the subject-matter of rights\nenshrined in\nArticle 19 (1).\nThat again is not enough for\nthe purpose of deciding upon the applicability of\nArticle\n, because even if a law does not, in its pith and\nsubstance, deal with any of the fundamental rights conferred\nby\nArticle 19 (1)\n, if the direct and inevitable effect of\nthe law is such as to abridge or abrogate any of those\nrights,\nArticle 19 (1)\nshall have to be attracted. It would\nthen become necessary to test the\nvalidity of even a penal law on the touchstone of that\nArticle. On this latter aspect of the matter, it is clear\nthat the deprivation of freedom consequent upon an order of\nconviction and sentence is not a direct and inevitable\nconsequence of the penal law but is merely incidental to the\norder of conviction and sentence which may or may not come\ninto play, that is to say, which may or may not be passed.\n\nSection 302\nof the Penal Code, therefore, does not have to\nstand the test of\nArticle 19 (1)\nof the Constitution. [190\nC-H, 191 A-B]\nThe onus of satisfying the requirements of\nArticle 19\n,\nassuming that the Article applies. lies on the person\nchallenging its validity. There is initial presumption in\nfavour of the constitutionality of the state and the burden\nof rebutting that presumption is thrown on the party who\nchallenges the constitutionality on the ground of\nArticle\n19.\nBehind the view that there is a presumption of\nconstitutionality of a statute and the onus to rebut the\nsame lies on those who challenge the legislation, is the\nrationale of judicial restraint, a recognition of the limits\nof judicial review, a respect for the boundaries of\nlegislative and judicial functions, and the judicial\nresponsibility to guard the trespass from one side or the\nother. The primary function of the courts is to interpret\nand apply the laws according to the will of those who made\nthem and not to transgress into the legislative domain of\npolicy-making. Even where the burden is on the State to show\nthat the restriction imposed by the impugned statute is\nreasonable and in public interest, the extent and the manner\nof discharge of the burden necessarily depends on the\nsubject-matter of the legislation, the nature of the\ninquiry, and the scope and limits of judicial review.\n[192 C-D, 193 A, C-D, 194 D-E]\nSaghir Ahmad v. State of Uttar Pradesh, [1955] 1 SCR\n707; Khyerbari Tea Co. v. State of Assam & Ors., A.I.R. 1964\nSC 925; B. Banerjee v. Anita Pan, [1975] 2 SCR 774 @ 787;\nPathumma v.

Rao, [1952] SCR 597 @ 607; Jagmohan Singh\nv. State of U.P., [1973] 2 SCR 541, referred to.\n5. Statistical attempts to assess the true penological\nvalue of capital punishment remain inconclusive. Firstly,\nstatistics of deterred potential murderers are hard to\nobtain. Secondly, the approach adopted by the Abolitionists\nis over simplified at the cost of other relevant but\nimponderable factors, the appreciation of which is essential\nto assess the true penological value of capital punishment.\nThe number of such factors is infinitude, their character\nvariable, duration transient and abstract formulation\ndifficult. Conditions change from country to country and\ntime to time. Due to the inconsistancy of social conditions,\nit is not scientifically possible to assess with any degree\nof accuracy, as to whether the variation in the incidence of\ncapital crime is attributable to the presence or absence of\ndeath penalty in the penal law of that country for such\ncrimes.\n[215 E-H, 216 A]\n6. To sum up, the question whether or not death penalty\nserves any penological purpose is a difficult, complex and\nintractable issue. It has evoked strong, divergent views.\nFor the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the\nimpugned provision as to death penalty in\nsection 302\n, Penal\nCode, on the ground of reasonableness in the light of\n\nArticles 19\nand\nof the Constitution, it is not necessary\nto express any categorical opinion, one way or the other, as\nto which of these two antithetical views, held by the\nAbolitionists and Retentionists, is correct. It is\nsufficient to say that the very fact that persons of reason,\nlearning and light are rationally and deeply divided in\ntheir opinion on this issue, is a ground among others, for\nrejecting the petitioners' argument that retention of death\npenalty in the impugned provision, is totally devoid of\nreason and purpose. If, notwithstanding the view of the\nAbolitionists to the contrary, a very large segment of\npeople the world over, including sociologists, legislators,\njurists, judes and administrators still firmly believe in\nthe worth and necessity of capital punishment for the\nprotection of society, if in the perspective of prevailing\ncrime conditions in India, contemporary public opinion\nchanalised through the people's representatives in\nParliament, has repeatedly in the last three decades,\nrejected all attempts, including the one made recently, to\nabolish or specifically restrict the area of death penalty,\nif death penalty is still a recognised legal sanction for\nmurder or some types of murder in most of the civilised\ncountries in the world, if the framers of the Indian\nConstitution were fully aware of the existence of death\npenalty as punishment for murder, under the\nIndian Penal\nCode\n, if the 35th Report and subsequent Reports of the Law\nCommission suggesting retention of death penalty, and\nrecommending revision of the\nCriminal Procedure Code\nand the\ninsertion of the new\nsections 235 (2)\nand\n354 (3)\nin that\nCode providing for pre-sentence hearing and sentencing\nprocedure on conviction for murder another capital offences\nwere before the Parliament and presumably considered by it\nwhen in 1972-73 it took up revision of the Code of 1898, and\nreplaced it by the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973, it\ncannot be said that the provision of death penalty as an\nalternative punishment for murder, in\nsection 302\n, Penal\nCode, is unreasonable and not in public interest. Therefore,\nthe impugned provision in\nsection 302\n, violates neither the\nletter nor the ethos of\nArticle 19.\n[221 B-H, 222 A]\n7. (i) Neither the new interpretative dimensions given\nto\nArticles 19\nand\nby the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi,\n[1978] 2 SCR 621, and Charles Sobraj v. The Superintendent,\nCentral Jail, Tihar, New Delhi, [1979] 1 SCR 512, nor the\nacceptance by India of the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights, makes any change in the prevailing\nstandards of decency and human dignity. The International\nCovenant does not outlaw capital punishment for murder\naltogether. [225 C-E]\n(ii) In accordance with the interpretative principle\nindicated by the Supreme Court in Maneka's case,\nArticle 21\n\nwill read as \"No person shall be deprived of his life or\npersonal liberty except according to fair, just and\nreasonable procedure established by valid law\" or in its\nconverse positive form as \"A person may be deprived of his\nlife or personal liberty in accordance with fair, just and\nreasonable procedure established by valid law.\"\nArticle 21\n,\nthus, clearly\nbrings out the implication, that the Founding Fathers\nrecognised the right of the State to deprive a person of his\nlife or personal liberty in accordance with fair, just and\nreasonable procedure established by valid law. In view of\nthe constitutional provisions-Entries 1 and 2 in List III\nConcurrent List of Seventh Schedule\nArticles 72 (1) (c)\n, 161\n\nand 134-it cannot be said that death penalty under\nsection\n, Penal Code, per se or because of its execution by\nhanging, constitutes an unreasonable, cruel or unusual\npunishment. By reason of the same constitutional postulates,\nit cannot be said that the framers of the Constitution\nconsidered death sentence for murder or the prescribed\ntraditional mode of its execution as a degrading punishment\nwhich would defile \"the dignity of the individual\" within\nthe contemplation of the Preamble to the Constitution. On\nparity of reasoning, it cannot be said that death penalty\nfor the offence of murder violates the basic structure of\nthe Constitution. [222 E-H, 223 A-B, F-H]\n(iii) Clauses (1) and (2) of\nArticle 6\nof the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights do not\nabolish or prohibit the imposition of death penalty in all\ncircumstances. All that they require is that, firstly, death\npenalty shall not be arbitrarily inflicted; secondly, it\nshall be imposed only for most serious crimes in accordance\nwith a law which shall not be an ex post facto legislation.\nThus, the requirements of these clauses are substantially\nthe same as the guarantees or prohibitions contained in\n\nArticles 20\nand\nof our Constitution. India's commitment,\ntherefore, does not go beyond what is provided in the\nConstitution and the\nIndian Penal Code\nand the\nCriminal\nProcedure Code\n. The Penal Code prescribes death penalty as\nan alternative punishment only for heinous crimes which are\nnot more than seven in number.\nSection 354 (3)\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1973 in keeping with the spirit of\nthe International Covenant, has further restricted the area\nof death penalty. India's penal laws, including the impugned\nprovisions and their application, are thus entirely in\naccord with its international commitment. [224 G-H, 225 A-C]\n8. The procedure provided in\nCriminal Procedure Code\n\nfor imposing capital punishment for murder and some other\ncapital crimes under the Penal Code cannot, by any\nreckoning, be said to be unfair, unreasonable or unjust. Nor\ncan it be said that this sentencing discretion, with which\nthe Courts are invested, amounts to delegation of its power\nof legislation by Parliament. The impugned provisions do not\nviolate\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nof the Constitution.\n[238 B, G-H, 239 A-B]\n\nSection 235 (2)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure makes\nnot only explicit what according to the decision in\nJagmohan's case was implicit in the scheme of the Code, but\nalso bifurcates the trial by providing two hearings, one at\nthe preconviction stage and another at the pre-sentence\nstage. And,\nsection 354 (3)\nof the Code marks a significant\nshift in the legislative policy underlying the Code, 1898,\nas in force immediately before April 1, 1974, according to\nwhich both the alternative sentences of death or\nimprisonment for life provided for murder and for certain\nother capital offences under the Penal Code, were normal\nsentences. Now, according to this changed legislative policy\nwhich is patent on the face of\nsection 354 (3)\n, the normal\npunishment for murder and six other capital offences under\nthe Penal Code is imprisonment for life (or imprisonment for\na term of years) and death penalty is an exception. [229 F-\nG, A-B]\nAlthough sub-section (2) of\nsection 235\nof the Code\ndoes not contain a specific provision as to evidence and\nprovides only for hearing of the accused as to sentence, yet\nit is implicit in this provision that if a request is made\nin that behalf by either the prosecution or the accused, or\nby both, the Judge should give the party or parties\nconcerned an opportunity of producing evidence or material\nrelating to the various factors bearing on the question of\nsentence. [230 E-F]\nJagmohan Singh v. State of U.P., [1973] 2 SCR 541,\nreiterated.\nSanta Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1973 SC 2385,\nreferred to.\n9. The expression \"special reasons\" in the context of\n\nsection 354 (3)\nobviously means \"exceptional reasons\"\nfounded on the exceptionally grave circumstances of the\nparticular case relating to crime as well as criminal. Thus,\nthe legislative policy now writ large and clear on the face\nof\nsection 354 (3)\nis that on conviction of murder and other\ncapital offences punishable in the alternative with death\nunder the Penal Code, the extreme penalty should be imposed\nonly in extreme cases. [236 C-D]\nBalwant Singh v. State of Punjab, [1976] 2 SCR 684,\nreferred to.\n10.\nSection 235 (2)\nof the Code provides for a\nbifurcated trial and specifically gives the accused person a\nright of pre-sentence hearing, at which stage, he can bring\non record material or evidence, which may not be strictly\nrelevant to or connected with the particular crime under\ninquiry, but nevertheless have, consistently with the policy\nunderlined in\nsection 354 (3)\n, a bearing on the choice of\nsentence. The present legislative policy discernible from\n\nsection 235(2)\nread with\nsection 354(3)\nis that in fixing\nthe degree of punishment or making the choice of sentence\nfor various offences, including one under\nsection 302\n, Penal\nCode, the Court should not confine its consideration\n\"principally\" or \"merely\" to the circumstances connected\nwith the particular crime, but also give due consideration\nto the circumstances of the criminal. [237 C-E]\n11. The Supreme Court should not venture to formulate\nrigid standards in an area in which the Legislature so\nwarily treads. Only broad guidelines consistent with the\npolicy indicated by the Legislature can be laid down. But\nthis much can be said that in order to qualify for inclusion\nin the category of \"aggravating circumstances\" which may\nform the basis of \"special reasons\" in\nsection 354(3)\n,\ncircumstances found on the facts of a particular case, must\nevidence aggravation of an abnormal or special degree. [243\nE-F, 254 B-C]\nGurbakash Singh Sibbia and Ors. v. State of Punjab,\n[1980] 3 SCR p. 383, applied.\nHyman and Anr. v. Rose, [1912] AC 623, referred to.\n12.\nSections 354 (3)\nand\n235 (2)\nand other related\nprovisions of the Code of 1973 make it clear that for making\nthe choice of punishment or for ascertaining\nthe existence or absence of \"special reasons\" in that\ncontext, the Court must pay due regard both to the crime and\nthe criminal. What is the relative weight to be given to the\naggravating and mitigating factors, depends on the facts and\ncircumstances of the particular case. More often than not,\nthese two aspects are so intertwined that it is difficult to\ngive a separate treatment to each of them. This is so\nbecause \"style is the man.\" In many cases, the extremely\ncruel or beastly manner of the commission of murder is\nitself a demonstrated index of the depraved character of the\nperpetrator. That is why, it is not desirable to consider\nthe circumstances of the crime and the circumstances of the\ncriminal in two separate water-tight compartments. In a\nsense, to kill is to be cruel and therefore all murders are\ncruel. But such cruelty may vary in its degree of\nculpability. And it is only when the culpability assumes the\nproportion of extreme depravity that \"special reasons\" can\nlegitimately be said to exist.\n[251 G-H, 252 A-C]\nRajendra Prasad v. State of U.P. [1979] 3 SCR p. 78,\nBishnu Deo Shaw v. State of West Bengal, [1979] 3 SCR p.\n355, overruled.\n13. There are numerous other circumstances justifying\nthe passing of the lighter sentence, as there are\ncountervailing circumstances of aggravation. \"We cannot\nobviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations\nsince they are astrological imponderables in an imperfect\nand undulating society.\" Nonetheless, it cannot be over\nemphasised that the scope and concept of mitigating factors\nin the area of death penalty must receive a liberal and\nexpansive construction by the courts in accord with the\nsentencing policy writ large in\nsection 354 (3)\n. Judges\nshould never be blood-thirsty. Hanging of murderers has\nnever been too good for them. Facts and figures, albeit\nincomplete, furnished by the Union of India, show that in\nthe past, Courts have inflicted the extreme penalty with\nextreme infrequency-a fact which attests to the caution and\ncompassion which they have always brought to bear on the\nexercise of their sentencing discretion in so grave a\nmatter. It is, therefore, imperative to voice the concern\nthat Courts, aided by the broad illustrative guidelines\nindicated by the Supreme Court, will discharge the onerous\nfunction with evermore scrupulous care and humane concern,\ndirected along the highroad of legislative policy outlined\nin\nsection 354 (3)\n, viz., that for persons convicted of\nmurder life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an\nexception. A real and abiding concern for the dignity of\nhuman life postulates resistance to taking a life through\nlaw's instrumentality. That ought Lot to be done save in the\nrarest of rare cases when the alternative option is\nunquestionably foreclosed. [255 E-H, 256 A-C]\nPer Bhagwati J. (Dissenting)\n1:1. Ordinarily, on the principle of stare decisis,\nJudges would hold themselves bound by the view taken in an\nearlier case and resist any attempt at reconsideration of\nthe same issue. But, for several weighty and given\nconsiderations, the Court can depart from this precedential\nrule in any particular case.\n[258 A-B]\n1:2. The rule of adherence to precedence is not a rigid\nand inflexible rule of law, but it is a rule of practice\nadopted by the Courts for the purpose of ensuring uniformity\nand stability in the law. Otherwise there will be no\ncertainty and predictability in the law, leading to chaos\nand confusion and in the process\ndestroying the rule of law, and increasing the labour of\njudges. But this rule of adherence to precedents; though a\nnecessary tool \"in the legal smithy,\" is only a useful\nservant and can not be allowed to turn into a tyrannous\nmaster. If the rule of stare decisis were followed blindly\nand mechanically, it would dwarf and stultify the growth of\nthe law and affect its capacity to adjust itself to the\nchanging needs of the society. [258 B-C, D,E,F]\n1:3 There are certain issues which transcend technical\nconsiderations of stare decisis and if such an issue is\nbrought before the Court, it would be nothing short of\nabdication of its constitutional duty for the Court to\nrefuse to consider such issue by taking refuge under the\ndoctrine of stare decisis. The Court may refuse to entertain\nsuch an issue like the constitutional validity of death\npenalty because it is satisfied that the previous decision\nis correct but it cannot decline to consider it on the\nground that it is barred by the rule of adherence to\nprecedents. [259 E-G]\nIn the present case, there are two other supervening\ncircumstances which justify, may compel, re-consideration of\nthe decision in Jagmohan's case. The first is the\nintroduction of the new\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nin 1973,\nwhich by\nsection 354\n, sub-section (3) has made life sentence\nthe rule, in case of offences punishable with death or in\nthe alternative imprisonment for life and provided for\nimposition of sentence of death only in exceptional cases\nfor special reasons. The second and the still more important\ncircumstance which has supervened since the decision in\nJagmohan's case is the new dimension of\nArticles 14\nand\nunfolded by the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of\nIndia (1978) 2 SCR 663. This new dimension of\nArticles 14\n\nand\nrenders the death penalty provided in\nsection 302\nof\nthe Indian Penal Code read with\nsection 354(3)\nof the Code\nof Criminal Procedure vulnerable to attack on a ground not\navailable at the time when Jagmohan's case was decided.\nFurthermore, since Jagmohan's case was decided, India has\nratified two international instruments on Human Rights and\nparticularly the International Covenant on civil and\npolitical rights.\n[259 G-H, 260 A-D]\nJagmohan v. State of U.P. A.I.R. 1973 SC 947, dissented\nfrom.\nState of Washington v. Dawson and Company 264 U.S. 646;\n68 L. Edn. 219 dissenting judgment quoted with approval.\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India, [1978] 2 SCR 663\napplied.\n2:1. The constitutional validity of the death penalty\nprovided as an alternative punishment in\nsection 302\nof the\nIndian Penal Code read with\nsection 354\nsub-section (3) of\nthe\nCode of Criminal Procedure\ncannot be sustained. Death\npenalty does not serve any social purpose or advance any\nconstitutional value and is totally arbitrary and\nunreasonable so as be violative of\nArticles 14\n, 19\n, and\nof the Constitution, [256 F, 257 E]\nJagmohan Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1973 SC\n947. not followed.\n2:2 The culture and ethos of the nation as gathered\nfrom its history, its tradition and its literature would\nclearly be relevant factors in adjudging the\nconstitutionality of death penalty and so would the ideals\nand values embodied in the Constitution which lays down the\nbasic frame-work of the social and political structure of\nthe country, and which sets out the objectives and goals to\nbe pursued by the people in a common endeavour to secure\nhappiness and welfare of every member of the society. So\nalso standards or norms set by International organisations\nand bodies have relevance in determining the constitutional\nvalidity of death penalty and equally important in\nconstruing and applying the equivocal formulae of the\nConstitution would be the \"wealth of non-legal learning and\nexperience that encircles and illuminates\" the topic of\ndeath penalty. [261 B-E]\n2:3. The objective of the United Nations has been and\nthat is the standard set by the world body that capital\npunishment should be abolished in all countries. This\nnormative standard set by the world body must be taken into\naccount in determining whether the death penalty can be\nregarded as arbitrary, excessive and unreasonable so as to\nbe constitutionally invalid. [268 B-C]\n2:4. The Constitution of India is a unique document. It\nis not a mere pedantic legal text but it embodies certain\nhuman values, cherished principles, and spiritual norms and\nrecognises and upholds the dignity of man. It accepts the\nindividual as the focal point of all development and regards\nhis material, moral and spiritual development as the chief\nconcern of its various provisions. It does not treat the\nindividual as a cog in the mighty all-powerful machine of\nthe State but places him at the centre of the constitutional\nscheme and focuses on the fullest development of his\npersonality. The several provisions enacted in the\nconstitutions for the purpose of ensuring the dignity of the\nindividual and providing for his material, moral and\nspiritual development would be meaningless and ineffectual\nunless there is rule of law to invest them with life and\nforce.\n[268 C-D, G-H]\n2:5. The rule of law permeates the entire fabric of the\nConstitution and indeed forms one of its basic features. The\nrule of law excludes arbitrariness; its postulate is\n'intelligence without passion' and 'reason freed from\ndesire'. Wherever we find arbitrariness or unreasonableness\nthere is denial of the rule of law. \"Law\" in the context of\nthe rule of law, does not mean any law enacted by the\nlegislative authority, howsoever arbitrary or despotic it\nmay be. Otherwise even under a dictatorship it would be\npossible to say that there is rule of law, because every law\nmade by the dictator howsoever arbitrary and unreasonable\nhas to be obeyed and every action has to be taken in\nconformity with such law. In such a case too even where the\npolitical set up is dictatorial, it is law that governs the\nrelationship between men and men and between men and the\nState. But still it is not a rule of law as understood in\nmodern jurisprudence because in jurisprudential terms, the\nlaw itself in such a case being an emanation from the\nabsolute will of the dictator, it is in effect and substance\nthe rule of man and not of law which prevails in such a\nsituation. What is a necessary element of the rule of law is\nthat the law must not be arbitrary and irrational and it\nmust satisfy the test of reason and the democratic form of\npolity seeks to ensure this element by making the framers of\nthe law accountable to the people. [269 A-E]\n2:6. The rule of law has much greater vitality under\nour Constitution than it has in other countries like the\nUnited Kingdom which has no constitutionally enacted\nFundamental Rights. The rule of law has really three basic\nand fundamental assumptions; one is that law making must be\nessentially in the hands of a democratically elected\nlegislature, subject of course to any power in the executive\nin an emergent situation to promulgate ordinance effective\nfor a short duration while the legislation is not in session\nas also to enact delegated legislation in accordance with\nthe guidelines laid down by the legislature; the other is\nthat, even in the hands of a democratically elected\nlegislature, there should not be unfettered legislative\npower; and lastly there must be an independent judiciary to\nprotect the citizen against excesses of executive and\nlegislative power and we have in our country all these three\nelements essential to the rule of law. It is plain and\nindisputable that under our Constitution law cannot be\narbitrary or irrational and if it is, it would be clearly\ninvalid, whether under\nArticle 14\nor\nArticle 19\nor\nArticle\n, whichever be applicable. [275 E-H. 276 A-B]\nMinerva Mill's case [1981] 1 SCR 206; Maneka Gandhi's\ncase [1978] 2 SCR 621; Airport Authority of India's case\n[1979] 3 SCR 1014; A.K. Gopalan's case [1950] 3 SCR 88; F.C.\nMullen's case [1981] 2 SCR 516 referred to.\n2:7. The Constitution does not in so many terms\nprohibit capital punishment. In fact, it recognises death\nsentence as one of the penalties which may be imposed by\nlaw. Apart from\nArticle 21\n, Clause (C) of\nArticle 72\nalso\nrecognises the possibility of a sentence of death being\nimposed on a person convicted of an offence inasmuch as it\nprovides that the President shall have the power to suspend,\nremit or commute the sentence of any person who is convicted\nof an offence and sentenced to death. Therefore, the\nimposition of death sentence for conviction of an offence is\nnot in all cases forbidden by the Constitution. But that\ndoes not mean that the infliction of death penalty is\nblessed by the Constitution or that it has the imprimatur or\nseal of approval of the Constitution. The Constitution is\nnot a transient document but it is meant to endure for a\nlong time to come and during its life, situations may arise\nwhere death penalty may be found to serve a social purpose\nand its prescription may not be liable to be regarded as\narbitrary or unreasonable and therefore to meet such\nsituations, the Constitution had to make a provision and\nthis it did in\nArticle 21\nand clause (c) of\nArticle 72\nso\nthat, even where death penalty is prescribed by any law and\nit is otherwise not unconstitutional, it must still comply\nwith the requirement of\nArticle 21\nand it would be subject\nto the clemency power of the President under clause (c) of\n\nArticle 72.\n[276 D-H, 277 A-B]\n2:8. From the legislative history of the relevant\nprovisions of the\nIndian Penal Code\nand the\nCode of Criminal\nProcedure\n, it is clear that in our country there has been a\ngradual shift against the imposition of death penalty. Life\nsentence is now the rule and it is only in exceptional\ncases, for special reasons, that death sentence can be\nimposed. The legislature has however not indicated what are\nthe special reasons for which departure can be made from the\nnormal rule and death penalty may be inflicted. The\nlegislature has not given any guidance as to what are those\nexceptional cases in which, deviating from the normal\nrule, death sentence may be imposed. This is left entirely\nto the unguided discretion of the court, a feature, which\nhas lethal consequences so far as the constitutionality of\ndeath penalty is concerned. [277 C-D, 278 E-G]\nRajendra Prasad v. State of U.P. [1979] 3 S.C.R. 646,\nreferred to.\n2:9. The problem of constitutional validity of death\npenalty cannot be appreciated in its proper perspective\nwithout an adequate understanding of the true nature of\ndeath penalty and what it involves in terms of human anguish\nand suffering. In the first place, death penalty is\nirrevocable; it cannot be recalled. It extinguishes the\nflame of life for ever and is plainly destructive of the\nright to life, the most precious right of all, a right\nwithout which enjoyment of no other rights is possible. If a\nperson is sentenced to imprisonment, even if it be for life,\nand subsequently it is found that he was innocent and was\nwrongly convicted, he can be set free. Of course, the\nimprisonment that he has suffered till then cannot be undone\nand the time he has spent in the prison cannot be given back\nto him in specie but he can come back and be restored to\nnormal life with his honour vindicated, if he is found\ninnocent. But that is not possible where a person has been\nwrongly convicted and sentenced to death and put out of\nexistence in pursuance of the sentence of death. In his\ncase, even if any mistake is subsequently discovered, it\nwill be too late, in every way and for every purpose it will\nbe too late, for he cannot be brought back to life. The\nexecution of the sentence of death in such a case makes\nmiscarriage of justice irrevocable. [281 F-H, 282 A-D]\n2:10. Howsoever careful may be the procedural\nsafeguards, erected by the law before death penalty can be\nimposed, it is impossible to eliminate the chance of\njudicial error. No possible judicial safeguards can prevent\nconviction of the innocent. It is indeed a very live\npossibility and it is not at all unlikely that so long as\ndeath penalty remains a constitutionaly valid alternative,\nthe Court or the State acting through the instrumentality of\nthe Court may have on its conscience the blood of an\ninnocent man. [283 D-E. G-H]\n2:11. Judicial error in imposition of death penalty\nwould indeed be a crime beyond punishment. This is the\ndrastic nature of death penalty, terrifying in its\nconsequences, which has to be taken into account in\ndetermining its constitutional validity. Death penalty is\nbarbaric and inhuman in its effect, mental and physical upon\nthe condemned man and is positively cruel. Its psychological\neffect on the prisoner in the Death Row is disastrous. [284\nE-F]\nFurman v. Georgia 408 US 238; In Re Kemmler 136 US 436;\nIn Re Medley 134 US 160; quoted with approval.\n2:12. Penological goals also do not justify the\nimposition of death penalty for the offence of murder. The\nprevailing standards of human decency are also incompatible\nwith death penalty. The standards of human decency with\nreference to which the proportionality of the punishment to\nthe offence is required to be judged vary from society to\nsociety depending on the cultural and spiritual\ntradition of the society, its history and philosophy and its\nsense of moral and ethical values. [302 A-B]\nMoreover, it is difficult to see how death penalty can\nbe regarded as proportionate to the offence of murder when\nlegislatively it has been ordained that life sentence shall\nbe the rule and it is only in exceptional cases for special\nreasons that death penalty may be imposed. It is obvious\nfrom the provision enacted in\nsection 354 (3)\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure that death sentence is legislatively\nregarded as disproportionate and excessive in most cases of\nmurder and it is only in exceptional cases that it can at\nall be contended that death sentence is proportionate to the\noffence of murder. But, then the legislature does not\nindicate as to what are those exceptional cases in which\ndeath sentence may be regarded as proportionate to the\noffence and, therefore, reasonble and just. Death penalty\ncannot be regarded as proportionate to the offence of\nmurder, merely because the murder is brutal, heinous or\nshocking. The nature and magnitude of the offence or the\nmotive and purposes underlying it or the manner and extent\nof its commission cannot have any relevance to the\nproportionality of death penalty to the offence. [304 H, 305\nA-D, 306 D-E]\n2:13 The historical course through which death penalty\nhas passed in the last 150 years shows that the theory that\ndeath penalty acts as a greater deterrent than life\nimprisonment is wholly unfounded. Even the various studies\ncarried out clearly establish beyond doubt that death\npenalty does not have any special deterrent effect which\nlife sentence does not possess and that in any event there\nis no evidence at all to suggest that death penalty has any\nsuch special deterrent effect. [316 A, 321 G-H]\n2:14. Death penalty as provided under\nsection 302\nof\nthe Indian Penal Code read with\nsection 354\nsub-section (3)\nof the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 does not sub-serve\nany legitimate end of punishment, since by killing the\nmurderer it totally rejects the reformation purpose and it\nhas no additional deterrent effect which life sentence does\nnot possess and it is therefore not justified by the\ndeterrence theory of punishment. Though retribution or\ndenunciation is regarded by some as a proper end of\npunishment, it cannot have any legitimate place in an\nenlightened philosophy of punishment. Therefore, death\npenalty has no rational penological purpose and it is\narbitrary and irrational and hence violative of\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution.\n[340 D-F]\n2:15. On a plain reading of\nsection 302\nof the Indian\nPenal Code which provides death penalty as alternative\npunishment of murder it is clear that it leaves it entirely\nto the discretion of the Court whether to impose death\nsentence or to award only life imprisonment to an accused\nconvicted of the offence of murder.\nSection 302\ndoes not lay\ndown any standards or principles to guide the discretion of\nthe Court in the matter of imposition of death penalty. The\ncritical choice between physical liquidation and life long\nincarceration is left to the discretion of the Court and no\nlegislative light is shed as to how this\ndeadly discretion is to be exercised. The court is left free\nto navigate in an unchartered sea without any compass or\ndirectional guidance. [341 A-C]\n2:16. Actually\nsection 354 (3)\nof the Criminal\nProcedure Code makes the exercise of discretion more\ndifficult and uncertain. It is left to the Judge to grope in\nthe dark for himself and in the exercise of his unguided and\nunfettered discretion decide what reasons may be considered\nas 'special reasons' justifying award of death penalty and\nwhether in a given case any such special reasons exist which\nshould persuade the Court to depart from the normal rule and\ninflict death penalty on the accused. There being no\nlegislative policy or principle to guide the Court in\nexercising its discretion in this delicate and sensitive\narea of life and death, the exercise of discretion of the\nCourt is bound to vary from judge to judge. What may appear\nas special reasons to one judge may not so appear to another\nand the decision in a given case whether to impose the death\nsentence or to let off the offender only with life\nimprisonment would, to a large extent, depend upon who is\nthe judge called upon to make the decision. The reason for\nhis uncertainty in the sentencing process is two-fold.\nFirstly, the nature of the sentencing process is such that\nit involves a highly delicate task calling for skills and\ntalents very much different from those ordinarily expected\nof lawyers. Even if considerations relevant to capital\nsentencing were provided by the legislature, it would be a\ndifficult exercise for the judges to decide whether to\nimpose the death penalty or to award the life sentence. But\nwithout any such guidelines given by the legislature, the\ntask of the judges becomes much more arbitrary and the\nsentencing decision is bound to vary with each judge.\nSecondly, when unguided discretion is conferred upon the\nCourt to choose between life and death, by providing a\ntotally vague and indefinite criterion of 'special reasons'\nwithout laying down any principles or guidelines for\ndetermining what should be considered to be 'special\nreasons', the choice is bound to be influenced by the\nsubjective philosophy of the judge called upon to pass the\nsentence and on his value system and social philosophy will\ndepend whether the accused shall live or die. No doubt the\njudge will have to give 'special reasons' if he opts in\nfavour of inflicting the death penalty, but that does not\neliminate arbitrariness and caprice, firstly because there\nbeing no guidelines provided by the legislature, the reasons\nwhich may appeal to one judge as 'special reasons' may not\nappeal to another, and secondly, because reasons can always\nbe found for a conclusion that the judge instinctively\nwishes to reach and the judge can bona fide and\nconscientiously find such reasons to be 'special reasons'.\nIt is now recognised on all hands that judicial conscience\nis not a fixed conscience; it varies from judge to judge\ndepending upon his attitudes and approaches, his\npredilections and prejudices, his habits of mind and thought\nand in short all that goes with the expression \"social\nphilosophy\". Further, the various decisions in which special\nreasons have been given singly and cumulatively indicate not\nmerely that there is an enormous potential of arbitrary\naward of death penalty by the High Court and the Supreme\nCourt but that, in fact, death sentence have been awarded\narbitrarily and freakishly.\n[341 G, E-H, 342 E-H.\n343 A-B, 353 E-F]\n2:17. But where the discretion granted to the Court is\nto choose between life and death without any standards or\nguide-lines provided by the legislature,\nthe death penalty does become arbitrary and unreasonable.\nThe death penalty is qualitatively different from a sentence\nof imprisonment. Whether a sentence of imprisonment is for\ntwo yeaes or five years or for life, it is qualitatively the\nsame, namely, a sentence of imprisonment, but the death\npenalty is totally of different. It is irreversible; it is\nbeyond recall or reparation; it extinguishes life. It is the\nchoice between life and death which the court is required to\nmake and this is left to its sole discretion unaided and\nunguided by any legislative yardstick to determine the\nchoice. [356 G-H. 357 A-B]\n2:18. The only yardstick which may be said to have been\nprovided by the legislature is that life sentence shall be\nthe rule and it is only in exceptional cases for special\nreasons that death penalty may be awarded, but it is no\nwhere indicated by the legislature as to what should be\nregarded as 'special reasons' justifying imposition of death\npenalty. The awesome and fearful discretion whether to kill\na man or to let him live is vested in the Court and the\nCourt is called upon to exercise this discretion guided only\nby its own perception of what may be regarded as 'special\nreasons' without any light shed by the legislature. It is\ndifficult to appreciate how a law which confers such\nunguided discretion on the Court without any standards or\nguidelines on so vital an issue as the choice between life\nand death can be regarded as constitutionally valid. [357B-\nD]\n2:19. Death penalty in its actual operation is\ndiscriminatory, for it strikes mostly against the poor and\ndeprived sections of the community and the rich and the\naffluent usually escape from its clutches. This circumstance\nalso adds to the arbitrary and capricious nature of the\ndeath penalty and renders it unconstitutional as being\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\n[366G-H]\n3:1. When a law is challenged on the ground that it\nimposes restrictions on the freedom guaranteed by one or the\nother sub-clause of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nand the\nrestrictions are shown to exist by the petitioner, the\nburden of estabilshing that the restrictions fall within any\nof the permissive clauses (2) to (6) which may be\napplicable, must rest upon the State. The State would have\nto produce material for satisfying the Court that the\nrestrictions imposed by the impugned law fall with the\nappropriate permissive clause from out of clauses (2) to (6)\nof\nArticle 19\nOf course there may be cases where the nature\nof the legislation and the restrictions imposed by it may be\nsuch that the Court may, without more, even in the absence\nof any positive material produced by the State, conclude\nthat the restrictions fall within the permissible category,\nas for example, where a law is enacted by the legislature\nfor giving effect to one of the Directive Principles of\nState Policy and prima facie, the restrictions imposed by it\ndo not appear to be arbitrary or excessive. Where such is\nthe position, the burden would again shift and it would be\nfor the petitioner to show that the restrictions are\narbitrary or excessive and go beyond what is required in\npublic interest. But once it is shown by the petitioner that\nthe impugned law imposes restrictions which infringe one or\nthe other sub-clause of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\n, the burden\nof showing that such restrictions are reasonable and fall\nwithin the permissible category must be on the State and\nthis burden the State may discharge either by producing\nsocio economic data before the Court or on consideration of\nthe provisions in the impugned\nlaw read in the light of the constitutional goals set out in\nthe Directive Principles of State Policy. The test to be\napplied for the purpose of determining whether the\nrestrictions imposed by the impugned law are reasonable or\nnot cannot be cast in a rigid formula of universal\napplication. The nature of the right alleged to have been\ninfringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions\nimposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be\nremedied, the value of human life. the disproportion of the\nimposition, the social philosophy of the Constitution and\nthe prevailing conditions at the time would all enter into\nthe judicial verdict. And in evaluating such elusive factors\nand forming his own conception of what is reasonable in all\nthe circumstances of a given case, it is inevitable that the\nsocial philosophy and the scale of values of the judge\nparticipating in the decision would play a very important\npart. [293 G-H, 294 A-G]\nState of Madras v. V.J. Row [1952] SCR 597. Shagir\nAhmed v. State of U.P. [1955] 1 SCR 707 followed.\nKhyerbari Tea Co. v. State of Assam [1964] 5 SCR 975;\nB. Banerjee v.

The position in regard to onus of proof in a case\nwhere the challenge is under\nArticle 21\nis much clearer and\nmuch more free from or doubt or debate than in a case where\nthe complaint is of violation of clause (1) of\nArticle 19.\n\nWherever there is deprivation of life, i.e. not only\nphysical existence, but also use of any faculty or limb\nthrough which life is enjoyed and basic human dignity, or of\nany aspect of personal liberty, the burden must rest on the\nState to establish by producing adequate material or\notherwise that the procedure prescribed for such deprivation\nis not arbitrary but is reasonable, fair and just. Where\ntherefore a law authorises deprivation of the right to life,\nthe reasonableness, fairness and justness of the procedure\nprescribed by it for such deprivation must be established by\nthe State. The burden must lie upon the State to show that\ndeath penalty is not arbitrary and unreasonable and serves a\nlegitimate social purpose, despite the possibility of\njudicial error in convicting and sentencing an innocent man\nand the brutality and pain, mental as well as physical,\nwhich death sentence invariably inflicts upon the condemned\nprisoner. The State must place the necesary material on\nrecord for the purpose of discharging this burden which lies\nupon it and if it fails to show by presenting adequate\nevidence before the Court or otherwise that death penalty is\nnot arbitrary and unreasonable and does serve a legitimate\nsocial purpose, the imposition of death penalty under\n\nsection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code read with\nsection 354\n\nsub-section (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nwould have\nto be struck down as violative of the protection of\nArticle\n21.\n[295 A-C, 296 D-E]\n3:3. There is a presumption in favour of the\nconstitutionality of a statute and the burden of showing\nthat it is arbitrary or discriminatory lies upon the\npetitioner, because it must be presumed that the legislature\nunderstands and\ncorrectly appreciates the needs of its own people, that its\nlaws are directed to problems made manifest by experience\nand that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds.\nIt would be a wise rule to adopt to presume the\nconstitutionality of a statute unless it is shown to be\ninvalid. But this rule is not a rigid inexorable rule\napplicable at all times and in all situations. There may\nconceivably be cases where having regard to the nature and\ncharacter of the legislation. the importance of the right\naffected and the gravity the injury caused by it and the\nmoral and social issue involved in the determination, the\nCourt may refuse to proceed on the basis of presumption of\nconstitutionality and demand from the State justification of\nthe legislation with a view to establishing that it is not\narbitrary or discriminatory. [296 G-H, 298 C-E]\nThe burden rests on the State to establish by producing\nmaterial before the Court or authorities, that death penalty\nhas greater deterrent effect than life sentence in order to\njustify its imposition under the law. If the State fails to\ndischarge this burden which rests upon it, the Court would\nhave to hold that death penalty has not been shown to have\ngreater deterrent effect and it does not therefore serve a\nrational legislative purpose.

This reference to the Constitution Bench\nraises a question in regard to the constitutional validity\nof death penalty for murder provided in\nSection 302\n, Penal\nCode, and the sentencing procedure embodied in sub-section\n(3) of\nSection 354\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\n\nThe reference has arisen in these circumstances:\n\nBachan Singh, appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 273 of\n1979, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death under\n\nSection 302\n, Indian Penal Code for the murders of Desa\nSingh, Durga Bai and Veeran Bai by the Sessions Judge. The\nHigh Court confirmed his death sentence and dismissed his\nappeal.\n\nBachan Singh's appeal by special leave, came up for\nhearing before a Bench of this Court (consisting of Sarkaria\nand Kailasam, JJ.). The only question for consideration in\nthe appeal was, whether the facts found by the Courts below\nwould be \"special reasons\" for awarding the death sentence\nas required under\nSection 354(3)\nof the Code of Criminal\nProcedure 1973.\n\nShri H.K. Puri, appearing as Amicus Curiae on behalf of\nthe appellant, Bachan Singh, in Criminal Appeal No. 273 of\n1979.\ncontended that in view of the ratio of\nRajendra Prasad v.\nState of U.P.\n,(1) the Courts below were not competent to\nimpose the extreme penalty of death on the appellant. It was\nsubmitted that neither the circumstance that the appellant\nwas previously convicted for murder and committed these\nmurder after he had served out the life sentence in the\nearlier case, not the fact that these three murders were\nextremely heinous and inhuman, constitutes a \"special\nreason\" for imposing the death sentence within the meaning\nof\nSection 354(3)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973.\nReliance for this argument was placed on Rajendra Prasad\n(ibid) which according to the counsel, was on facts very\nsimilar, if not identical, to that case.\n\nKailasam, J. was of opinion that the majority view in\nRajendra Prasad taken by V.R. Krishna Iyer, J, who spoke for\nhimself and D.A. Desai, J., was contrary to the judgment of\nthe Constitution Bench in\nJagmohan Singh v. State of Uttar\nPradesh\n(2), inter alia, on these aspects:\n\n(i) In Rajendra Prasad, V.R. Krishna Iyer, J. observed\n:\n\n\"The main focus of our judgment is on this\npoignant gap in 'human rights jurisprudence' within the\nlimits of the Penal Code, impregnated by the\nConstitution. To put it pithily, a world order voicing\nthe worth of the human person, a cultural legacy\ncharged with compassion, an interpretative liberation\nfrom colonial callousness to life and liberty, a\nconcern for social justice as setting the sights of\nindividual justice, interest with the inherited text of\nthe Penal Code to yield the goals desiderated by the\nPreamble and\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21.\"\n\nAccording to Kailasam, J., the challenge to the\naward of the death sentence as violative of\nArticles\n, 14\nand\n, was repelled by the Constitution Bench\nin\nJagmohan\n's case.\n\n(ii) In\nJagmohan\n's case, the Constitution Bench\nheld:\n\n\"The impossibility of laying down standards (in\nthe matter of sentencing) is at the very core of\ncriminal law as administered in India which invests the\njudges with a\nvery wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree\nof punishment and that this discretion in the matter of\nsentence in liable to be corrected by superior\nCourts... The exercise of judicial discretion on well\nrecognised principles is, in the final analysis, the\nsafest possible safeguard for the accused.\"\n\nIn Rajendra Prasad, the majority decision characterised\nthe above observations in Jagmohan as: \"incidental\nobservations without concentration on the sentencing\ncriteria\", and said that they are not the ratio of the\ndecision, adding. \"Judgments are not Bible for every line to\nbe venerated.\"\n\n(iii) In Rajendra Prasad, the plurality observed:\n\n\"It is constitutionally permissible to swing a\ncriminal out of corporeal existence only if the\nsecurity of State and society, public order and the\ninterests of the general public compel that course as\nprovided in\nArticle 19(2)\nto (6).\"\n\nThis view again, according to Kailasam, J., is inconsistent\nwith the law\nlaid down by\nthe Constitution Bench in\nJagmohan, wherein it was held that deprivation of life is\nconstitutionally permissible if that is done according to\n\"procedure established by law\".\n\n(iv) In Rajendra Prasad, the majority has further\nopined:\n\n\"The only correct approach is to read into Section\n\n302.\nI.P.C\n. and\nSection 354(3)\nCr. P.C., the human\nrights and humane trends in the Constitution. So\nexamined, the rights to life and the fundamental\nfreedoms is deprived when he is hanged to death, his\ndignity is defiled when his neck is noosed and\nstrangled.\"\n\nAgainst the above, Kailasam, J. commented : 'The only\nchange after the Constitution Bench delivered its judgment\nis the introduction of\nSection 354(3)\nwhich requires special\nreasons to be given if the Court is to award the death\nsentence. If without the restriction of stating sufficient\nreasons death sentence could be constitutionally awarded\nunder the\nI.P.C\n. and Cr. P.C. as it stood before the\namendment, it is difficult to perceive how by requiring\nspecial reasons to\nbe given the amended section would be unconstitutional\nunless the \"sentencing sector is made most restrictive and\nleast vagarious\".\n\n(v) In Rajendra Prasad, the majority has held that:\n\n\"Such extraordinary grounds alone constitutionally\nqualify as special reasons as leave on option to the\nCourt but to execute the offender if State and society\nare to survive. One stroke of murder hardly qualifies\nfor this drastic requirement, however, gruesome the\nkilling or pathetic the situation, unless the inherent\ntestimony coming from that act is irresistible that the\nmurderous appetite of the convict is too chronic and\ndeadly that ordered life in a given locality or society\nor in prison itself would be gone if this man were now\nor later to be at large. If he is an irredeemable, like\na bloodthirsty tiger, he has to quit his terrestrial\ntenancy.\"\n\nAccording to Kailasam, J., what is extracted above,\nruns directly counter to and cannot be reconciled with the\nfollowing observations in\nJagmohan\n's case:\n\n\"But some (murders) at least are diabolical in\nconception and cruel in execution. In some others where\nthe victim is a person of high standing in the country,\nsociety is liable to be recked to its very foundation.\nSuch murders cannot be simply wished away by finding\nalibis in the social maladjustment of the murderer.\nPrevalence of such crimes speaks, in the opinion of\nmany, for the inevitability of death penalty not only\nby way of deterrence but as a token of emphatic\ndisapproval by the society A very responsible body (Law\nCommission) has come to the conclusion after\nconsidering all the relevant factors. On the\nconclusions thus offered to us, it will be difficult to\nhold that capital punishment as such is unreasonable or\nnot required in the public interest.\"\n\n(vi) Kailasam, J. was further of the opinion that\nit is equally beyond the functions of a Court to evolve\n\"working rules for imposition of death sentence bearing\nthe markings of enlightened flexibility and social\nsensibility\" or to make law \"by cross-fertilisation\nfrom sociology, history, cultural anthropology and\ncurrent national perils and developmental goals and,\nabove all, constitutional currents\". This function, in\nhis view, belongs only to Parliament. The Court must\nadminister the law as it stands.\n\n(vii) The learned Judge has further expressed that the\nview taken by V.R. Krishna Iyer, J. in Rajendra Prasad\nthat \" 'special reasons' necessary for imposing death\npenalty must relate not to the crime as such, but to\nthe criminal\" is not warranted by the law as it stands\ntoday.\n\nWithout expressing his own opinion on the various\nquestions raised\nin that case\nincluding the one with regard\nto the scope, amplification and application of\nSection 354\n(3)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1974, Sarkaria, J.,\nin agreement with Kailasam, J., directed the records of the\ncase to be submitted to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice, for\nconstituting a large Bench \"to resolve the doubts,\ndifficulties and inconsistencies pointed out by Kailasam,\nJ.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, several persons convicted of murders\nand sentenced to death, filed writ petitions (namely, Writ\nPetitions 564, 165, 179, 434, 89, 754, 756 and 976 of 1979)\nunder\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution directly challenging\nthe constitutional validity of the death penalty provided in\n\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code for the offence of\nmurder, and the sentencing procedure provided in\nSection 354\n(3)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1974. That is how,\nthe matter has now come up before this larger Bench of five\nJudges.\n\nAt the outset, Shri R.K. Garg submitted with some\nvehemance and persistence, that Jagmohan's case needs\nreconsideration by a larger Bench if not by the Full Court.\nReconsideration of Jagmohan, according to the learned\ncounsel, is necessitated because of subsequent events and\nchanges in law. Firstly, it is pointed out that when\nJagmohan was decided in 1972, the then extant\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n, 1898 left the choice between death and\nlife imprisonment as punishment for murder entirely to the\ndiscretion of the Court. This position has since undergone a\ncomplete change and under\nSection 354 (3)\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973, death sentence has ceased to be\nthe normal penalty for murder. Secondly,\nit is argued, the seven-Judge decision of this Court in\n\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n(1) has given a new\ninterpretative dimension of the provisions of\nArticles 21\n,\nand\nand their inter-relationship, and according to\nthis new interpretation every law of punitive detention both\nin its procedural and substantive aspects must pass the test\nof all the three Articles. It is stressed that an argument\nfounded on this expansive interpretation of these Articles\nwas not available when Jagmohan was decided. Thirdly, it is\nsubmitted that India has since acceded to the international\nCovenant of Civil and Political Rights adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, which came into\nforce in December 16, 1976. By virtue of this Covenant.\nIndia and the other 47 countries who are a party to it,\nstand committed to a policy for abolition of the 'death\npenalty'.\n\nDr. L.M. Singhvi submitted that the question of death\npenalty cannot be foreclosed for ever on the abstract\ndoctrine of stare decisis by a previous decision of this\nCourt. It is emphasised that the very nature of the problem\nis such that it must be the subject of review from time to\ntime so as to be in tune with the evolving standards of\ndecency in a maturing society.\n\nThe learned Solicitor-General, Shri Soli Sorabji\nopposed the request of Shri Garg for referring the matter to\na larger Bench because such a course would only mean\navoidable delay in disposal of the matter. At the same time,\nthe learned counsel made it clear that since the\nconstitutionality of the death penalty for murder was now\nsought to be challenged on additional arguments based on\nsubsequent events and changes in law, he would have no\nobjection on the ground of stare decisis, to a fresh\nconsideration of the whole problem by this very Bench.\n\nIn view of the concession made by Shri Sorabji, we\nproceeded to hear the counsel for the parties at length, and\nto deal afresh with the constitutional questions concerning\ndeath penalty raised in these writ petitions.\n\nWe have heard the arguments of Shri R.K. Garg.\nappearing for the writ-petitioners in Writ Petition No.\n564/79 for more than three weeks and also those of Dr. L.M.\nSinghvi, Dr. Chitaley and\nS/Shri Mukhoty, Dave and R.K. Jain, appearing for\ninterveners or for the other writ-petitioners.\n\nWe have also heard the arguments of Shri Soli Sorabji,\nSolicitor-General, appearing for the Union of India and Shri\nPatel appearing for the State of Maharashtra and the other\ncounsel appearing for the respondents.\n\nThe principal questions that fall to be considered in\nthis case are:\n\n(I) Whether death penalty provided for the offence of\nmurder in\nSection 302\n, Penal Code is\nunconstitutional.\n\n(II) If the answer to the foregoing question be in the\nnegative, whether the sentencing procedure\nprovided in\nSection 354 (3)\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 (Act 2 of 1974) is\nunconstitutional on the ground that it invests the\nCourt with unguided and untrammelled discretion\nand allows death sentence to be arbitrarily or\nfreakishly imposed on a person found guilty of\nmurder or any other capital offence punishable\nunder the\nIndian Penal Code\nwith death or, in the\nalternative, with imprisonment for life.\n\nWe will first take up Question No. (I) relating to the\nconstitutional validity of\nSection 302\n, Penal Code.\nQuestion No. (I):\n\nBefore dealing with the contentions canvassed, it will\nbe useful to have a short survey of the legislative history\nof the provisions of the Penal Code which permit the\nimposition of death penalty for certain offences.\n\nThe\nIndian Penal Code\nwas drafted by the First Indian\nLaw Commission presided over by Mr. Macaulay. The draft\nunderwent further revision at the hands of well-known\njurists, like Sir Barnes Peacock, and was completed in 1850.\nThe\nIndian Penal Code\nwas\npassed by the then Legislature on October 6, 1860 and was\nenacted as Act No XLV of 1860.\n\nSection 53\nof the Penal Code enumerates punishments to\nwhich offenders are liable under the provisions of this\nCode. Clause Firstly of the Section mentions 'Death' as one\nof such punishments. Regarding 'death' as a punishment, the\nauthors of the Code say: \"We are convinced that it ought to\nbe very sparingly inflicted, and we propose to employ it\nonly in cases where either murder or the highest offence\nagainst the State has been committed.\" Accordingly, under\nthe Code, death is the punishment that must be awarded for\nmurder by a person under sentence of imprisonment for life\n(\nSection 303\n). This apart, the Penal Code prescribes 'death'\nas an alternative punishment to which the offenders may be\nsentenced, for the following seven offences:\n\n(1) Waging war against the Government of India. (s.\n\n121)\n(2) Abetting mutiny actually committed. (s. 132)\n(3) Giving or fabricating false evidence upon which an\ninnocent person suffers death. (s. 194)\n(4) Murder which may be punished with death or life\nimprisonment. (s. 302)\n(5) Abetment of suicide of a minor or insane, or\nintoxicated person. (s. 305)\n(6) Dacoity accompanied with murder. (s. 396)\n(7) Attempt to murder by a person under sentence of\nimprisonment for life if hurt is caused. (s. 307)\nIn the instant cases, the impugned provision of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\nis\nSection 302\nwhich says: \"Whoever\ncommits murder shall be punished with death, or imprisonment\nfor life, and also be liable to fine.\" The related\nprovisions are contained in\nSections 299\nand\n.\nSection\ndefines 'culpable homicide'.\nSection 300\ndefines\n'murder'. Its material part runs as follows:\n\n\"Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable\nhomicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused\nis done with the intention of causing death, or\nSecondly-If it is done with the intention of causing\nsuch bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to\ncause death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or\nThirdly-If it is done with the intention of causing\nbodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended\nto be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of\nnature to cause death, or\nFourthly-If the person committing the act knows that it\nis so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability,\ncause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause\ndeath, and commits, such act without any excuse for\nincurring the risk of causing death or such injury as\naforesaid.\"\n\nThe first contention of Shri Garg is that the provision\nof death penalty in\nSection 302\n, Penal Code offends\nArticle\nof the Constitution. It is submitted that the right to\nlive is basic to the enjoyment of all the six freedoms\nguaranteed in clauses (a) to (e) and (g) of\nArticle 19 (1)\n\nof the Constitution and death penalty puts an end to all\nthese freedoms: that since death penalty serves no social\npurpose and its value as a deterrent remains unproven and it\ndefiles the dignity of the individual so solemnly vouchsafed\nin the Preamble of the Constitution, its imposition must be\nregarded as an 'unreasonable restriction' amounting to total\nprohibition, on the six freedoms guaranteed in\nArticle 19\n(1).\n\nArticle 19\n, as in force today, reads as under:\n\n\"19 (1). All citizens shall have the right-\n\n(a) to freedom of speech and expression;\n\n(b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;\n\n(c) to form associations or unions;\n\n(d) to move freely throughout the territory of\nIndia;\n\n(e) to reside and settle in any part of the\nterritory of India;\n\n(f) .....................;\n(g) to practice any profession, or to carry on\nany occupation, trade or business.\n\n(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect\nthe operation of any existing law, or prevent the State\nfrom making any law, in so far as such law imposes\nreasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right\nconferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of\nthe sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of\nthe State, friendly relations with foreign States,\npublic order, decency or morality, or in relation to\ncontempt of court, defamation or incitement to an\noffence.\n\n(3) Nothing in sub-clause (b) of the said clause shall\naffect the operation of any existing law in so far as\nit imposes, or prevent the State from making any law\nimposing, in the interests of the sovereignty and\nintegrity of India or public order, reasonable\nrestrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by\nthe said sub-clause.\n\n(4) Nothing in sub-clause (c) of the said clause shall\naffect the operation of any existing law in so far as\nit imposes, or prevent the State from making any law\nimposing, in the interests of the sovereignty and\nintegrity of India or public order or morality,\nreasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right\nconferred by the said sub-clause.\n\n(5) Nothing in sub-clauses (d) and (e) of the said clause\nshall affect the operation of any existing law in so\nfar as it imposes, or prevents the State from making\nany law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the\nexercise of any of the rights conferred by the said\nsub-clauses either in the interests of the general\npublic or for the protection of the interests of any\nScheduled Tribe.\n\n(6) Nothing in sub-clause (g) of the said clause shall\naffect the operation of any existing law in so far as\nit imposes, or prevents the State from making any law\nimposing, in the interests of the general public,\nreasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right\ncon-\nferred by the said sub-clause, and in particular,\nnothing in the said sub-clause, shall affect the\noperation of any existing law in so far as it relates\nto, or prevent the State from making any law relating\nto,-\n\n(i) the professional or technical qualifications\nnecessary for practising any profession or\ncarrying on any occupation, trade or business, or\n\n(ii) the carying on by the State, or by a corporation\nowned or controlled by the State, of any trade,\nbusiness, industry or service, whether to the\nexclusion, complete or partial, of citizens or\notherwise.\"\n\nIt will be seen that the first part of the Article\ndeclares the rights in clause (1) comprising of six sub-\nclauses namely, (a) to (e) and (g). The second part of the\nArticle in its five clauses (2) to (6) specifies the limits\nupto which the abridgement of the rights declared in one or\nmore of the sub-clauses of clause (1), may be permitted.\nBroadly speaking,\nArticle 19\nis intended to protect the\nrights to the freedoms specifically enumerated in the six\nsub-clauses of clause (1) against State action, other than\nin the legitimate exercise of its power to regulate these\nrights in the public interest relating to heads specified in\nclauses (2) to (6). The six fundamental freedoms guaranteed\nunder\nArticle 19 (1)\nare not absolute rights. Firstly, they\nare subject to inherent restraints stemming from the\nreciprocal obligation of one member of a civil society to so\nuse his rights as not to infringe or injure similar rights\nof another. This is on the principle sic utere tuo ut\nalienum non laedas. Secondly, under clauses (2) to (6) these\nrights have been expressly made subject to the power of the\nState to impose reasonable restrictions, which may even\nextend to prohibition, on the exercise of those rights.\n\nThe power, if properly exercised, is itself a safeguard\nof the freedoms guaranteed in clause (1). The conferment of\nthis power is founded on the fundamental truth that\nuncontrolled liberty entirely freed from restraint,\ndegenerates into a licence, leading to anarchy and chaos;\nthat libertine pursuit of liberty, absolutely free, and free\nfor all, may mean liberticide for all. \"Liberty has,\ntherefore,\" as\nJustice Patanjali Sastri put it, \"to be limited in order to\nbe effectively possessed.\"\n\nIt is important to note that whereas\nArticle 21\n\nexpressly deals with the right to life and personal liberty,\n\nArticle 19\ndoes not. The right to life is not one of the\nrights mentioned in\nArticle 19 (1).\n\nThe first point under Question (1) to be considered is\nwhether\nArticle 19\nis at all applicable for judging the\nvalidity of the impugned provision in\nSection 302\n, Penal\nCode.\n\nAs rightly pointed out by Shri Soli Sorabji, the\ncondition precedent for the applicability of\nArticle 19\nis\nthat the activity which the impugned law prohibits and\npenalises, must be within the purview and protection of\n\nArticle 19 (1).\nThus considered, can any one say that he has\na legal right or fundamental freedom under\nArticle 19 (1)\nto\npractise the profession of a hired assassin or to form\nassociations or unions or engage in a conspiracy with the\nobject of committing murders or dacoities. The argument that\nthe provisions of the Penal Code, prescribing death sentence\nas an alternative penalty for murder have to be tested on\nthe ground of\nArticle 19\n, appears to proceed on the fallacy\nthat the freedoms guaranteed by\nArticle 19 (1)\nare absolute\nfreedoms and they cannot be curtailed by law imposing\nreasonable restrictions, which may amount to total\nprohibition. Such an argument was advanced before the\nConstitution Bench in\nThe State of Bombay v. R.M.D.\nChamarbaugwala\n.(1) In that case the constitutional validity\nof certain provisions of the Bombay Lotteries and Prize\nCompetition Control Act, 1952, as amended by\nBombay Act\nNo.\nXXX of 1952, was challenged on the ground, inter alia, that\nit infringes the fundamental rights of the promoters of such\ncompetitions under\nArticle 19 (1) (g)\n, to carry on their\ntrade or business and that the restrictions imposed by the\nsaid Act cannot possibly be supported as reasonable\nrestrictions in the interest of the general public\npermissible under\nArticle 19 (b).\nIt was contended that the\nwords \"trade\" or \"business\" or \"commerce\" in sub-clause (g)\nof\nArticle 19 (a)\nshould be read in their widest amplitude\nas any activity which is undertaken or carried on with a\nview to earning profit since there is nothing in\nArticle 19\n(1) (g)\nwhich may qualify or cut down the meaning of the\ncritical words; that there is no justification for excluding\nfrom the meaning\nof those words activities which may be looked upon with\ndisfavour by the State or the Court as injurious to public\nmorality or public interest. Speaking for the Constitution\nBench, S.R. Das, C.J. repelled this contention, in these\nterms:\n\n\"On this argument it will follow that criminal\nactivities undertaken and carried on with a view to\nearning profit will be protected as fundamental rights\nuntil they are restricted by law. Thus there will be a\nguaranteed right to carry on a business of hiring out\ngoondas to commit assault or even murder, or house-\nbreaking, or selling obscene pictures, of trafficking\nin women and so on until the law curbs or stops such\nactivities. This appears to us to be completely\nunrealistic and incongruous. We have no doubt that\nthere are certain activities which can under no\ncircumstance be regarded as trade or business or\ncommerce although the usual forms and instruments are\nemployed therein. To exclude those activities from the\nmeaning of those words is not to cut down their meaning\nat all but to say only that they are not within the\ntrue meaning of those words.\"\n\nThis approach to the problem still holds the field. The\nobservations in Chamarbaugwala, extracted above, were\nrecently quoted with approval by V.R. Krishna Iyer., J.,\nwhile delivering the judgment of the Bench in\nFatehchand\nHimmatlal & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra\n(1).\n\nIn\nA.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras\n(2), all the six\nlearned Judges constituting the Bench held that punitive\ndetention or imprisonment awarded as punishment after\nconviction for an offence under the\nIndian Penal Code\nis\noutside the scope of\nArticle 19\n, although this conclusion\nwas reached by them by adopting more or less different\napproaches to the problem.\n\nIt was contended on behalf of A.K. Gopalan that since\nthe preventive detention order results in the detention of\nthe detenu in a cell, his rights specified in clauses (a) to\n\n(e) and (g) of\nArticle 19 (1)\nhave been infringed.\nKania, C J. rejected this argument, inter alia, on\nthese grounds:\n\n(i) Argument would have been equally applicable to a\ncase of punitive detention, and its acceptance\nwould lead to absurd results. \"In spite of the\nsaving clauses (2) to (6), permitting abridgement\nof the rights connected with each other, punitive\ndetention under several sections of the Penal\nCode, e.g. for theft, cheating, forgery and even\nordinary assault, will be illegal, (because the\nreasonable restrictions in the interest of \"public\norder\" mentioned in clauses (2) to (4) of the\nArticle would not cover these offences and many\nother crimes under the Penal Code which injure\nspecific individuals and do not affect the\ncommunity or the public at large). Unless such\nconclusion necessarily follows from the article,\nit is obvious that such construction should be\navoided. In my opinion, such result is clearly not\nthe outcome of the Constitution.\"\n\n(The underlined words within brackets supplied.)\n(At page 100 of the Report)\n\n(ii) Judged by the test of direct and indirect effect\non the rights referred to in\narticle 19 (1)\n, the\nPenal Code is not a law imposing restrictions on\nthese rights. The test is that \"the legislation to\nbe examined must be directly in respect of one of\nthe rights mentioned in the sub-clauses. If there\nis a legislation directly attempting to control a\ncitizen's freedom of speech or expression or his\nright to assemble peaceably and without arms,\netc., the question whether that legislation is\nsaved by the relevant saving clause of\nArticle 19\n\nwill arise. If, however, the legislation is not\ndirectly in respect of any of these subjects, but\nas a result of the operation of other legislation,\nfor instance, for punitive or preventive\ndetention, his right under any of these sub-\nclauses is abridged, the question of the\napplication of\nArticle 19\ndoes not arise. The true\napproach is only to consider the directness of the\nlegislation and not what will be the result of the\ndetention otherwise valid, on the mode of the\ndetenu's life.\" (Pages 100-101).\n(iii)\"The contents and subject-matter of\narticles 19\n\nand\nare thus not the same...\" (Page 105).\n\n\"\nArticle 19 (5)\ncannot apply to a substantive law\ndepriving a citizen of personal liberty.\" \"\nArticle\n19 (1)\ndoes not purport to cover all aspects of\nliberty or of personal liberty. Personal liberty\nwould primarily mean liberty of the physical body.\nThe rights given under\narticle 19 (1)\ndo not\ndirectly come under that description. In that\nArticle only certain phases of liberty are dealt\nwith\". (Page 106) \"In my opinion therefore,\n\nArticle 19\nshould be read as a separate complete\nArticle\". (Page 107).\n\nPatanjali Sastri, J., also, opined \"that lawful\ndeprivation of personal liberty on conviction and sentence\nfor committing a crime, or by a lawful order of preventive\ndetention is \"not within the purview of\nArticle 19\nat all,\nbut is dealt with by the succeeding\nArticles 20\nand\n21.\"\n\n(Page 192). In tune with Kania, C.J., the learned Judge\nobserved: \"A construction which would bring within\nArticle\nimprisonment in punishment of a crime committed or in\nprevention of a crime threatened would, as it seems to me,\nmake a reductio ad absurdum of that provision. If\nimprisonment were to be regarded as a 'restriction' of the\nright mentioned in\narticle 19 (1) (d)\n, it would equally be a\nrestriction on the rights mentioned by the other sub-clauses\nof clause (1), with the result that all penal laws providing\nfor imprisonment as a mode of punishment would have to run\nthe gauntlet of clauses (2) to (6) before their validity\ncould be accepted. For instance, the law which imprisons for\ntheft would on that view, fall to be justified under clause\n(2) as a law sanctioning restriction of freedom of speech\nand expression.\" (Page 192).\n\n\"\nArticle 19\nconfers the rights therein specified only\non the citizens of India, while\narticle 21\nextends the\nprotection of life and personal liberty to all persons\ncitizens and non-citizens alike. Thus, the two Articles do\nnot operate in a coterminous field.\" (Page 193).\n\n\"(Personal liberty) was used in\nArticle 21\nas a sense\nwhich excludes the freedoms dealt in\nArticle 19 .....\"\n\nRejecting the argument of the Attorney General, the\nlearned Judge held that clauses (4) to (7) of\nArticle 22\ndo\nnot form a complete\nCode and that \"the language of\nArticle 21\nis perfectly\ngeneral and covers deprivation of personal liberty or\nincarceration, both for punitive and preventive reasons.\"\n(Page 207).\n\nMahajan, J., however, adopted a different approach. In\nhis judgment, \"an examination of the provisions of\nArticle\nclearly suggests that the intention was to make it self-\ncontained as regards the law of preventive detention and\nthat the validity of a law on the subject of preventive\ndetention cannot be examined or controlled either by the\nprovisions of\nArticle 21\nor by the provisions of\nArticle\n19(5).\"\n(Page 229).\n\nMukerjee, J. explained the relative scope of the\nArticles in this group, thus: \"To me it seems that\nArticle\nof the Constitution gives a list of individual liberties\nand prescribes in the various clauses the restraints that\nmay be placed upon them by law so that they may not conflict\nwith public welfare or general morality. On the other hand,\n\nArticles 20\n, 21\nand\nare primarily concerned with penal\nenactments or other laws under which personal safety or\nliberty of persons could be taken away in the interests of\nthe society and they set down the limits within which the\nState control should be exercised. In my opinion, the group\nof\narticles 20\nto 22 embody the entire protection guaranteed\nby the Constitution in relation to deprivation of life and\npersonal liberty both with regard to substantive as well as\nto procedural law.\" (Page 255).\n\n\"The only proper way of avoiding these anomalies is to\ninterpret the two provisions (\narticles 19\nand\n) as\napplying to different subjects. It is also unnecessary to\nenter into a discussion on the question...as to whether\n\narticle 22\nby itself is a self-contained Code with regard to\nthe law of Preventive Detention.\" (Page 257).\n\nS.R. Das, J., also, rejected the argument that the\nwhole of the\nIndian Penal Code\nis a law imposing reasonable\nrestriction on the rights conferred by\nArticle 19 (1)\n, with\nthese observations (at Page 303) :\n\n\"To say that every crime undermines the security\nof the State and, therefore, every section of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\n, irrespective of whether it has any\nreference to speech or expression, is a law within the\nmeaning of this clause is wholly unconvincing and\nbetrays only a vain and forlorn\nattempt to find an explanation for meeting the argument\nthat any conviction by a Court of law must necessarily\ninfringe\narticle 19 (1) (a).\nThere can be no getting\naway from the fact that a detention as a result of a\nconviction impairs the freedom of speech for beyond\nwhat is permissible under clause (2) of\narticle 19.\n\nLikewise, a detention on lawful conviction impairs each\nof the other personal rights mentioned in sub-clauses\n(3) to (6). The argument that every section of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\nirrespective of whether it has any\nreference to any of the rights referred to in sub-\n\nclauses (b) to (e) and (g) is a law imposing reasonable\nrestriction on those several rights has not even the\nmerit of plausibility. There can be no doubt that a\ndetention as a result of lawful conviction must\nnecessarily impair the fundamental personal rights\nguaranteed by\narticle 19 (1)\nfar beyond what is\npermissible under clauses (2) to (6) of that article\nand yet nobody can think of questioning the validity of\nthe detention or of the section of the\nIndian Penal\nCode\nunder which the sentence was passed.\"\n\n(ii) Das, J. then gave an additional reason as to why\nvalidity of punitive detention or of the sections of\nthe Penal Code under which the sentence was passed,\ncannot be challenged on the ground of\narticle 19\n, thus\n:\n\n\"Because the freedom of his person having been\nlawfully taken away, the convict ceases to be entitled\nto exercise .. any of the .. rights protected by clause\n(1) of\narticle 19.\"\n\n(iii) The learned Judge also held that \"\narticle 19\n\nprotects some of the important attributes of personal\nliberty as independent rights and the expression\n'personal liberty' has been used in\narticle 21\nas a\ncompendious term including within its meaning all the\nvarieties of rights which go to make up the personal\nliberties of men.\" (Page 299).\n\nFazal Ali, J. dissented from the majority. In his\nopinion: \"It cannot be said that\narticles 19\n, 20\n, 21\nand\ndo not to some extent overlap each other. The case of a\nperson who is convicted of an\noffence will come under\narticle 20\nand\nand also under\n\narticle 22\nso far as his arrest and detention in custody\nbefore trial are concerned. Preventive detention, which is\ndealt with in\narticle 22\n, also amounts to deprivation of\npersonal liberty which is referred to in\narticle 19 (1)\n\n(d).\" (Page 148).\n\nFazal Ali, J. held that since preventive detention,\nunlike punitive detention, directly infringes the right\nunder\nArticle 19(1)(d)\n, it must pass the test of clause (5).\nAccording to the learned Judge, only those laws are required\nto be tested on the anvil of\nArticle 19\nwhich directly\nrestrict any of the rights guaranteed in\nArticle 19(1).\n\nApplying this test (of direct and indirect effect) to the\nprovisions of the\nIndian Penal Code\n, the learned Judge\npointed out that the Code \"does not primarily or necessarily\nimpose restrictions on the freedom of movement, and it is\nnot correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on\nthe right to move freely. Its primary object is to punish\ncrime and not to restrict movement. The punishment may\nconsist in imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty. If it\nconsists in a pecuniary penalty, it obviously involves no\nrestriction on movement, but if it consists in imprisonment,\nthere is a restriction on movement. This restraint is\nimposed not under a law imposing restrictions on movement\nbut under a law defining crime and making it punishable. The\npunishment is correlated with the violation of some other\nperson's right and not with the right of movement possessed\nby the offender himself. In my opinion, therefore, the\n\nIndian Penal Code\ndoes not come within the ambit of the\nwords \"law imposing restriction on the right to move\nfreely.\"\n\n(Pages 145-146).\n\nIn applying the above test, which was the same as\nadopted by Kania, C.J., Fazal Ali, J. reached a conclusion\ncontrary to that reached by the Chief Justice, on the\nfollowing reasoning ;\n\n\"Punitive detention is however essentially\ndifferent from preventive detention. A person is\npunitively detained only after trial for committing a\ncrime and after his guilt has been established in a\ncompetent court of justice. A person so convicted can\ntake his case to the State High Court and sometimes\nbring it to this Court also; and he can in the course\nof the proceedings connected with his trial take all\npleas available to him including the plea of want of\njurisdiction of the Court of trial and the invalidity\nof the law\nunder which he has been prosecuted. The final judgment\nin the criminal trial will thus constitute a serious\nobstacle in his way if he chooses to assert even after\nhis conviction that his right under\narticle 19(1)(d)\n\nhas been violated. But a person who is preventively\ndetained has not to face such an obstacle whatever\nother obstacle may be in his way.\"\n\n(Page 146)\nWe have copiously extracted from the judgments in\nA.K.\nGopalan\n's case, to show that all the propositions\npropounded, arguments and reasons employed or approaches\nadopted by the learned Judges\nin that case\n, in reaching the\nconclusion that the\nIndian Penal Code\n, particularly those of\nits provisions which do not have a direct impact on the\nrights conferred by\nArticle 19(1)\n, is not a law imposing\nrestrictions on those rights, have not been overruled or\nrendered bad by the subsequent pronouncements of this Court\nin Bank Nationalizaton(1) case or in\nManeka Gandhi\n's case.\nFor instance, the proposition\nlaid down by\nKania, C.J.,\nFazal Ali, Patanjali Sastri, and S.R. Das, J.J. that the\n\nIndian Penal Code\nparticularly those of its provisions which\ncannot be justified on the ground on reasonableness with\nreference to any of the specified heads, such as \"public\norder\" in clauses (2), (3) and (4), is not a law imposing\nrestrictions on any of the rights conferred by\nArticle\n19(1)\n, still holds the field. Indeed, the reasoning,\nexplicit, or implicit in the judgments of Kania, C.J.,\nPatanjali Sastri and S.R. Das JJ. that such a construction\nwhich treats every section of the\nIndian Penal Code\nas a law\nimposing 'restriction' on the rights in\nArticle 19(1)\n, will\nlead to absurdity is unassailable. There are several\noffences under the Penal Code, such as theft, cheating,\nordinary assault, which do not violate or effect 'public\norder,' 'but only law and order'. These offences injure only\nspecific individuals as distinguished from the public at\nlarge. It is by now settled that 'public order' means 'even\ntempo of the life of the community.' That being so, even all\nmurders do not disturb or affect 'public order'. Some\nmurders may be of purely private significance and the injury\nor harm resulting therefrom affects only specific\nindividuals and, consequently, such murders may not be\ncovered by \"public order\" within the contemplation of\nclauses (2), (3) and (4) of\narticle 19.\nSuch murders do not\nlead to public disorder but to disorder simpliciter. Yet, no\nrational being can say\n(1) [1970] 3 SCR 530.\nthat punishment of such murders is not in the general public\ninterest. It may be noted that general public interest is\nnot specified as a head in clauses (2) to (4) on which\nrestriction on the rights mentioned in clause (1) of the\nArticle may be justified.\n\nIt is true, as was pointed out by Hidayatullah, J. (as\nhe then was) in Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia's(1) case, and in\nseveral other decisions that followed it, that the real\ndistinction between the areas of 'law and order' and 'public\norder' lies not merely in the nature or quality of the act,\nbut in the degree and extent. Violent crimes similar in\nnature, but committed in different contexts and\ncircumstances might cause different reactions. A murder\ncommitted in given circumstances may cause only a slight\ntremor, the wave length of which does not extent beyond the\nparameters of law and order. Another murder committed in\ndifferent context and circumstances may unleash a tidal wave\nof such intensity, gravity and magnitude, that its impact\nthrows out of gear the even flow of life. Nonetheless the\nfact remains that for such murders which do not affect\n\"public order\", even the provision for life imprisonment in\n\nSection 302\n, Indian Penal Code, as as alternative\npunishment, would not be justifiable under clauses (2), (3)\nand (4) as a reasonable restriction in the interest of\n'Public Order'. Such a construction must, therefore, be\navoided. Thus construed,\nArticle 19\nwill be attracted only\nto such laws, the provisions of which are capable of being\ntested under clauses (2) to (5) of\nArticle 19.\n\nThis proposition was recently (1975) reiterated in\n\nHardhan Saha & Anr. v. State of West Bengal\n(2).\n\nIn accord\nwith this line of reasoning in\nA.K. Gopalan\n's case, a\nConstitution Bench of this Court in Hardhan Saha's case\nrestated the principle for the applicability of\nArticle 19\n\nby drawing a distinction between a law of preventive\ndetention and a law providing punishment for commission of\ncrimes, thus :\n\n\"Constitution has conferred rights under\nArticle\nand also adopted preventive detention to prevent the\ngreater evil of elements imperilling the security, the\nsafety of a State and the welfare of the nation. It is\nnot possible to think that a person who is detained\nwill yet be free to move\n(1) [1966] 1 S.C.R. 709.\n\n(2) [1975] 1 S.C.R. 778 at p. 784.\nfor assemble or form association or unions or have the\nright to reside in any part of India or have the\nfreedom of speech or expression. Suppose a person is\nconvicted of an offence of cheating and prosecuted (and\nimprisoned) after trial, it is not open to say that the\nimprisonment should be tested with reference to\nArticle\nfor its reasonableness. A law which attracts\nArticle\ntherefore must be such as is capable of being tested\nto be reasonable under clauses (2) to 5 of\nArticle 19.\"\n\n(emphasis and parenthesis supplied.)\nThe last sentence which has been underlined by us,\nappears to lend implicit approval to the rule of\nconstruction adopted by the majority of the learned Judges\nin\nA.K. Gopalan\n's case, whereby they excluded from the\npurview of\nArticle 19\ncertain provisions of the\nIndian Penal\nCode\nproviding punishment for certain offences which could\nnot be tested on the specific grounds-embodied in clauses\n(2) to (5) of that Article. This proposition enunciated in\nA.K. Gopalan's case is only a product of the application of\nthe basic canon that a construction which would lead to\nabsurdity, should be eschewed.\n\nIn R.C. Cooper v. Union of India (popularly known as\nBank Nationalization case), the majority adopted the two-\nfold test for determining as to when a law violated\nfundamental rights, namely: \"(1) It is not the object of the\nauthority making the law impairing the right of a citizen,\nnor the form of action that determines the protection he can\nclaim. (2) It is the effect of the law and of the action\nupon the right which attract the jurisdiction of the Court\nto grant relief. The direct operation of the act upon the\nrights forms the real test.\"\n\nIn\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n(ibid), Bhagwati, J.\nexplained the scope of the same test by saying that a law or\nand order made thereunder will be hit by\narticle 19\n, if the\ndirect and inevitable consequence of such law or order is to\nabridge or take away any one or more of the freedoms\nguaranteed by\nArticle 19(1).\nIf the effect and operation of\nthe statute by itself, upon a person's fundamental rights is\nremote or dependent upon \"factors which may or may not come\ninto play\", then such statute is not ultra-vires on the\nground of its being violative of that fundamental right.\nBhag-\nwati J. described this proposition as \"the doctrine of\nintended and real effect\" while Chandrachud, J. (as he then\nwas) called it \"the test of proximate effect and operation\nof the statute.\"\n\nThe question is, whether R.C. Cooper & Maneka Gandhi\nhave given a complete go-by to the 'test of direct and\nindirect effect, sometimes described as form and object\ntest' or 'pith and substance rule', which was adopted by\nKania, C.J. and Fazal Ali, J. in\nA.K. Gopalan\n's case. In our\nopinion, the answer to this question cannot be in the\naffirmative. In the first place, there is nothing much in\nthe name. As Varadachariar, J. put it in Subrahmanyan\nChettiar's(1) case, such rules of interpretation were\nevolved only as a matter of reasonableness and common sense\nand out of the necessity of satisfactorily solving conflicts\nfrom the inevitable overlapping of subjects in any\ndistribution of powers. By the same yardstick of common\nsense, the 'pith and substance rule' was applied to resolve\nthe question of the constitutionality of a law assailed on\nthe ground of its being violative of a fundamental right.\n\nSecondly, a survey of the decisions of this Court since\nA.K. Gopalan, shows that the criterion of directness which\nis the essence of the test of direct and indirect effect,\nhas never been totally abandoned. Only the mode of its\napplication has been modified and its scope amplified by\njudicial activism to maintain its efficacy for solving new\nconstitutional problems in tune with evolving concepts of\nrights and obligations in a strident democracy.\n\nThe test of direct and indirect effect adopted in A.K.\nGopalan was approved by the Full Court in\nRam Singh v. State\nof Delhi\n.(2) Therein, Patanjali Sastri, J. quoted with\napproval the passages (i) and (ii) (which we have extracted\nearlier) from the judgment of Kania, C. J. Although Mahajan\nand Bose, JJ. differed on the merits, there was no dissent\non this point among all the learned Judges.\n\nThe first decision, which, though purporting to follow\nKania, C. J's. enunciation in A.K. Gopalan, imperceptibly\nadded another dimension to the test of directness, was\n\nExpress Newspapers (Private) Ltd. & Anr. v. The Union of\nIndia & Ors.\n(3) In that case, the cons-\n\n(1) [1940] FCR 188.\n\n(2) [1951] SCR 451.\n\n(3) [1959] SCR 12.\ntitutional validity of the\nWorking Journalists (Conditions\nof Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1955\n, and the\nlegality of the decision of the Wage Board, constituted\nthereunder, were challenged. The impugned Act, which had for\nits object the regulation of the conditions of service of\nworking journalists and other persons employed in newspaper\nestablishments, provided, inter alia, for the payment of\ngratuity to a working journalist who had been in continuous\nservice for a certain period. It also regulated hours of\nwork and leave and provided for retrenchment compensation.\n\nSection 9 (1)\nlaid down the principles that the Wage Board\nwas to follow in fixing the rates of wages of working\njournalists.\n\nOne of the contentions of the petitioners\nin that case\n\nwas that impugned Act violated their fundamental rights\nunder\nArticles 19 (1) (a)\n, 19 (1) (g)\n, 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution and that the decision of the Wage Board fixing\nthe rates and scales of wages which imposed too heavy a\nfinancial burden on the industry and spelled its total ruin,\nwas illegal and void. It was contended by the learned\nAttorney General\nin that case\nthat since the impugned\nlegislation was not a direct legislation on the subject of\nfreedom of speech and expression.\nArt. 19 (1)(a)\nwould have\nno application, the test being not the effect or result of\nlegislation but its subject-matter. In support of his\ncontention, he relied upon the observations on this point of\nKania, C. J. in A. K. Gopalan. It was further urged that the\nobject of the impugned Act was only to regulate certain\nconditions of service of working journalists and other\npersons employed in the newspaper establishments and not to\ntake away or abridge the freedom of speech or expression\nenjoyed by the petitioners and, therefore, the impugned Act\ncould not come within the prohibition of\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\n\nread with\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution.\n\nOn the other hand, the petitioners took their stand on\na passage in the decision of the Supreme Court of United\nStates in Minnesota Ex Rel. Olson,(1) which was as under :\n\n\"With respect to these contentions it is enough to\nsay that in passing upon constitutional questions the\nCourt has regard to substance and not to mere matters\nof form, and that, in accordance with familiar\nprinciples, the statute must be tested by its operation\nand effect.\"\n\n(1) [1930] 283 US 697 at p. 708.\nIt was further submitted that in all such cases, the Court\nhas to look behind the names, forms and appearances to\ndiscover the true character and nature of the legislation.\nThus considered, proceeded the argument, the Act by laying a\ndirect and preferential burden on the press, would tend to\ncurtail the circulation, narrow the scope of dissemination\nof information and fetter the petitioners' freedom to choose\nthe means of exercising their rights of free speech (which\nincludes the freedom of the press). It was further submitted\nthat those newspaper employers who were marginally situated\nmay not be able to bear the strain and have to disappear\nafter closing down their establishments.\n\nN.H. Bhagwati, J. who delivered the unanimous Judgment\nof the Constitution Bench, after noting that the object of\nthe impugned legislation is to provide for the amelioration\nof the conditions of the workmen in the newspaper industry,\noverruled this contention of the employers, thus:\n\n\"That, however would be a consequence which would\nbe extraneous and not within the contemplation of the\nlegislature. It could therefore hardly be urged that\nthe possible effect of the impact of these measures in\nconceivable cases would vitiate the legislation as\nsuch. All the consequences which have been visualized\nin the behalf by the petitioners, viz., the tendency to\ncurtail circulation and thereby narrow the scope of\ndissemination of information, fetters on the\npetitioners' freedom to choose the means of exercising\nthe right, likelihood of the independence of the press\nbeing undermined by having to seek government aid; the\nimposition of penalty on the petitioners' right to\nchoose the instruments for exercising the freedom or\ncompelling them to seek alternative media, etc., would\nbe remote and depend upon various factors which may or\nmay not come into play. Unless these were the direct or\ninevitable consequences of the measures enacted in the\nimpugned Act, it would not be possible to strike down\nthe legislation as having that effect and operation.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\nThe learned Judge further observed that the impugned Act\ncould be \"legitimately characterised as a measure which\naffects the press\", but its \"intention or the proximate\neffect and operation\" was not such as would take away or\nabridge the right of freedom of speech and\nexpression guaranteed in\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\n, therefore, it\ncould not be held invalid on that ground. The impugned\ndecision of the Wage Board, however, was held to be ultra\nvires the Act and contrary to the principles of natural\njustice.\n\nIt may be observed at this place that the manner in\nwhich the test of direct and indirect effect was applied by\nN.H. Bhagwati, J., was not very different from the mode in\nwhich Fazal Ali, J. applied it to punitive detention as\npunishment after conviction for an offence under the\nIndian\nPenal Code\n. N.H. Bhagwati, J., did not discard the test\nadopted by Kania, C.J., in A.K. Gopalan, in its entirety; he\nmerely extended the application of the criterion of\ndirectness to the operation and effect of the impugned\nlegislation.\n\nAgain, in\nSakal Papers (P) Ltd. & Ors. v. The Union of\nIndia\n(1) this Court, while considering the constitutional\nvalidity of the\nNewspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956\nand\nDaily Newspaper (Price and Page) Order, 1960, held that the\n\"direct and immediate\" effect of the impugned Order would be\nto restrain a newspaper from publishing any number of pages\nfor carrying its news and views, which it has a fundamental\nright under\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\nand, therefore, the Order was\nviolative of the right of the newspapers guaranteed by\n\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\n, and as such, invalid. In this case,\nalso, the emphasis had shifted from the object and subject-\nmatter of the impugned State action to its direct and\nimmediate effect.\n\nIn\nNaresh Shridhar Mirajkar & Ors. v. State of\nMaharashtra & Anr.\n,(2) an order prohibiting the publication\nof the evidence of a witness in a defamation case, passed by\na learned Judge (Tarkunde, J.) of the Bombay High Court, was\nimpugned on the ground that it violated the petitioners'\nright to free speech and expression guaranteed by\nArticle 19\n(1) (a).\nGajendragadkar, C.J., (Wanchoo, Mudholkar, Sikri\nand Ramaswami, JJ., concurring) repelled this contention\nwith these illuminating observations:\n\n\"The argument that the impugned order affects the\nfundamental rights of the petitioners under\nArticle 19\n(1)\n, is based on a complete misconception about the\ntrue nature and\n(1) [1962] 3 SCR 842.\n\n(2) [1966] 3 SCR 744.\ncharacter of judicial process and of judicial\ndecisions. When a Judge deals with matters brought\nbefore him for his adjudication, he first decides\nquestions of fact on which the parties are at issue,\nand then applies the relevant law to the said facts.\nWhether the findings of fact recorded by the Judge are\nright or wrong, and whether the conclusion of law drawn\nby him suffers from any infirmity, can be considered\nand decided if the party aggrieved by the decision of\nthe Judge takes the matter up before the appellate\nCourt. But it is singularly inappropriate to assume\nthat a judicial decision pronounced by a Judge of\ncompetent jurisdiction in or in relation to matter\nbrought before him for adjudication can affect the\nfundamental rights of the citizens under\nArticle 19\n(1).\nWhat the judicial decision purports to do is to\ndecide the controversy between the parties brought\nbefore the court and nothing more. If this basic and\nessential aspect of the judicial process is borne in\nmind, it would be plain that the judicial verdict\npronounced by court in or in relation to a matter\nbrought before it for its decision cannot be said to\naffect the fundamental rights of citizens under\nArticle\n19 (1).\"\n\n\"It is well-settled that in examining the validity of\nlegislation, it is legitimate to consider whether the\nimpugned legislation is a legislation directly in respect of\nthe subject covered by any particular article of the\nConstitution, or touches the said article only incidentally\nor indirectly'.'\n\"If the test of direct effect and object which is\nsometimes described as the pith and substance test, is thus\napplied in considering the validity of legislation, it would\nnot be inappropriate to apply the same test to judicial\ndecisions like the one with which we are concerned in the\npresent proceedings. As we have already indicated, the\nimpugned order was directly concerned with giving such\nprotection to the witness as was thought to be necessary in\norder to obtain true evidence in the case with a view to do\njustice between the parties. If, incidentally, as a result\nof this-order, the petitioners were not able to report what\nthey heard in court, that cannot be said to make the\nimpugned order invalid under\nArticle 19 (1) (a).\"\nWe have already mentioned briefly how the test of\ndirectness was developed and reached its culmination in Bank\nNationalization's case and\nManeka Gandhi\n's case.\n\nFrom the above conspectus, it is clear that the test of\ndirect and indirect effect was not scrapped. Indeed, there\nis no dispute that the test of 'pith and substance' of the\nsubject-matter and of direct and of incidental effect of\nlegislation is a very useful test to determine the question\nof legislative competence i.e., in ascertaining whether an\nAct falls under one Entry while incidentally encroaching\nupon another Entry. Even for determining the validity of a\nlegislation on the ground of infringement of fundamental\nrights, the subject-matter and the object of the legislation\nare not altogether irrelevant. For instance, if the subject-\nmatter of the legilation directly covers any of the\nfundamental freedoms mentioned in\nArticle 19 (1)\n, it must\npass the test of reasonableness under the relevant head in\nclauses (2) to (6) of that Article. If the legislation does\nnot directly deal with any of the rights in\nArticle 19 (1)\n,\nthat may not conclude the enquiry. It will have to be\nascertained further whether by its direct and immediate\noperation, the impugned legislation abridges any of the\nrights enumerated in\nArticle 19 (1).\n\nIn Bennett Coleman,(1) Mathew, J. in his dissenting\njudgment referred with approval to the test as expounded in\nExpress Newspapers. He further observed that \"the 'pith and\nsubstance' test, though not strictly appropriate, must serve\na useful purpose in the process of deciding whether the\nprovisions in question which work some interference with the\nfreedom of speech, are essentially regulatory in character\".\nFrom a survey of the cases noticed above, a\ncomprehensive test which can be formulated, may be re-\nstated as under:\n\nDoes the impugned law, in its pith and substance,\nwhatever may be its form and object, deal with any of\nthe fundamental rights conferred by\nArticle 19 (1)?\nIf\nit does, does it abridge or abrogate any of those\nrights? And even if it does not, in its pith and\nsubstance, deal with any of the fundamental rights\nconferred by\nArticle 19(1)\n, is the\nDirect and inevitable effect of the impugned law such\nas to abridge or abrogate any of those rights?\nThe mere fact that the impugned law incidentally, remotely\nor collaterally has the effect of abridging or abrogating\nthose rights, will not satisfy the test. If the answer to\nthe above queries be in the affirmative, the impugned law in\norder to be valid, must pass the test of reasonableness\nunder\nArticle 19.\nBut if the impact of the law on any of the\nrights under clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nis merely incidental,\nindirect, remote or collateral and is dependent upon factors\nwhich may or may not come into play, the anvil of\nArticle 19\n\nwill not be avilable for judging its validity.\n\nNow, let us apply this test to the provisions of the\nPenal Code in question. Section 299 defines 'culpable\nhomicide' and Section 300 defines culpable homicide\namounting to murder. Section 302 prescribes death or\nimprisonment for life as penalty for murder. It cannot,\nreasonably or rationally, be contended that any of the\nrights mentioned in\nArticle 19(1)\nof the Constitution\nconfers the freedom to commit murder or, for the matter of\nthat, the freedom to commit any offence whatsoever.\nTherefore, penal laws, that is to say, laws which define\noffences and prescribe punishment for the commission of\noffences do not attract the application of\nArticle 19(1).\nWe\ncannot, of course, say that the object of penal laws is\ngenerally such as not to involve any violation of the rights\nconferred by\nArticle 19(1)\nbecause after the decision of\nthis Court in the Bank Nationalization case the theory, that\nthe object and form of the State action alone determine the\nextent of protection that may be claimed by an individual\nand that the effect of the State action on the fundamental\nright of the individual is irrelevant, stands discredited.\nBut the point of the matter is that, in pith and substance,\npenal laws do not deal with the subject matter of rights\nenshrined in\nArticle 19(1).\nThat again is not enough for the\npurpose of deciding upon the applicability of\nArticle 19\n\nbecause as the test formulated by us above shows, even if a\nlaw does not, in its pith and substance, deal with any of\nthe fundamental rights conferred by\nArticle 19(1)\n, if the\ndirect and inevitable effect of the law is such as to\nabridge or abrogate any of those rights,\nArticle 19(1)\nshall\nhave been attracted. It would then become necessary to test\nthe validity of even a penal law on the touchstone of that\nArticle. On this latter aspect of the matter, we are of the\nopinion that the deprivation of freedom consequent upon an\norder of conviction and sentence is not a direct\nand inevitable consequence of the penal law but is merely\nincidental to the order of conviction and sentence which may\nor may not come into play, that is to say, which may or may\nnot be passed. Considering therefore the test formulated by\nus in its dual aspect, we are of the opinion that Section\n302 of the Penal Code does not have to stand the test of\n\nArticle 19(1)\nof the Constitution.\n\nThis is particularly true of crimes, inherently vicious\nand pernicious, which under the English Common Law were\nclassified as crimes mala in se as distinguished from crimes\nmala prohibita crimes mala in se embrace acts immoral or\nwrong in themselves, such as, murder, rape, arson, burglary,\nlarceny (robbery and dacoity); while crimes mala prohibita\nembrace things prohibited by statute as infringing on\nothers' rights, though no moral turpitude attaches to such\ncrimes. Such acts constitute crimes only because they are so\nprohibited. (See Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition, Vol.\n\n10). While crimes mala in se do not per se, or in operation\ndirectly and inevitably impinge on the rights under\nArticle\n19(1)\n, cases under the other category of crimes are\nconceivable where the law relating to them directly\nrestricts or abridges such rights. The illustration given by\nShri Sorabji will make the point clear. Suppose, a law is\nenacted which provides that it shall be an offence to level\nany criticism, whatever, of the Government established by\nlaw and makes a further provision prescribing five years'\nimprisonment as punishment for such an offence. Such a law\n(i.e. its provision defining the offence) will directly and\ninevitably impinge upon the right guaranteed under clause\n\n(a) of\nArticle 19(1).\nTherefore, to be valid, it must pass\nthe test of reasonableness embodied in clause (2) of the\nArticle. But this cannot be said in regard to the provisions\nof the Penal Code with which we are concerned.\n\nAssuming arguendo, that the provisions of the Penal\nCode, particularly those providing death penalty as an\nalternative punishment for murder, have to satisfy the\nrequirements of reasonableness and public interest under\n\nArticle 19\nthe golden strand of which according to the\nratios of Maneka Gandhi runs through the basic structure of\n\nArticle 21\nalso the further questions to be determined, in\nthis connection, will be: On whom will the onus of\nsatisfying the requirements under\nArticle 19\n, lie ? Will\nsuch onus lie on the State or the person challenging its\nvalidity ? And what will be the nature of the onus?\nWith regard to onus, no hard and fast rule of universal\napplication in all situations, can be deducted from the\ndecided cases.\nIn some decisions, such as,\nSaghir Ahmad v.\nState of Uttar Pradesh\n(\n1) and Khyerbari Tea Co. v. State of\nAssam & Ors.\n(2) it was\nlaid down by\nthis Court that if the\nwrit petitioner succeeds in showing that the impugned law ex\nfacie abridges or transgresses the rights coming under any\nof the sub-clauses of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\n, the onus\nshifts on the respondent state to show that the legislation\ncomes within the permissible limits imposed by any of the\nclauses (2) to (6) as may be applicable to the case, and,\nalso to place material before the court in support of that\ncontention. If the State does nothing in that respect, it is\nnot for the petitioner to prove negatively that it is not\ncovered by any of the permissive clauses.\n\nA contrary trend, however, is discernible in the recent\ndecisions of this Court, which start with the initial\npresumption in favour of the constitutionality of the\nstatute and throw the burden of rebutting that presumption\non the party who challenges its constitutionality on the\nground of\nArt. 19.\n\nIn\nB. Banerjee v. Anita Pan\n(3) this Court, speaking\nthrough V.R. Krishna Iyer, J., reiterated the ratio of\nRam\nKrishna Dalmia\n's case,(4) that :\n\n\"there is always a presumption in favour of the\nconstitutionality of an enactment and the burden is\nupon him who attack it to show that there has been a\nclear transgression of the constitutional principles\";\nand\n\"that it must be presumed that the legislature\nunderstands and correctly appreciates the need of its\nown people, that its laws are directed to problems made\nmanifest by experience and that its discriminations are\nbased on adequate grounds.\"\n\nIt was emphasised that \"Judges act not by hunch but on hard\nfacts properly brought on record and sufficiently strong to\nrebuff the\ninitial presumption of constitutionality of legislation. Nor\nis the Court a third Chamber of the House to weigh whether\nit should draft the clause differently\". Referring, inter\nalia, to the decision of this Court in R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala\n(ibid), and Seervai's 'Constitutional Law of India', Vol. I,\npage 54, it was recalled, \"Some courts have gone to the\nextent of holding that there is a presumption in favour of\nconstitutionality, and a law will not be declared\nunconstitutional unless the case is so clear as to be free\nfrom doubt; and to doubt the constitutionality of a law is\nto resolve it in favour of its validity\". Similar view was\ntaken by a Bench of seven learned Judges of this Court in\n\nPathumma v. State of Kerala\n.(1)\nBehind the view that there is a presumption of\nconstitutionality of a statute and the onus to rebut the\nsame lies on those who challenge the legislation, is the\nrationale of judicial restraint, a recognition of the limits\nof judicial review; a respect for the boundaries of\nlegislative and judicial functions, and the judicial\nresponsibility to guard the trespass from one side or the\nother. The primary function of the courts is to interpret\nand apply the laws according to the will of those who made\nthem and not to transgress into the legislative domain of\npolicy-making. \"The job of a Judge is judging and not law-\nmaking\". In Lord Devlin's words : \"Judges are the keepers of\nthe law and the keepers of these boundaries cannot, also, be\namong out-riders.\"\n\nA similar warning was echoed by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States in Dennis v. United States(2) in these\nterms :\n\n\"Courts are not representative bodies. They are\nnot designed to be a good reflex of a democratic\nsociety. Their judgment is best informed, and therefore\nmost dependable, within narrow limits. Their essential\nquality is detachment, founded on independence. History\nteaches that the independence of the judiciary is\njeopardized when courts become embroiled in the\npassions of the day and assume primary responsibility\nin choosing between competing political, economic and\nsocial pressures.\"\nIn Gregg v. Georgia,(1) one of the principal questions\nfor consideration was, whether capital punishment provided\nin a statute for certain crimes was a \"cruel and unusual\"\n\npunishment. In that context, the nature of the burden which\nrests on those who attack the constitutionality of the\nstatute was explained by Stewart, J., thus :\n\n\"We may not require the legislature to select the\nleast severe penalty possible so long as the penalty\nselected is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to\nthe crime involved. And a heavy burden rests on those\nwho would attack the judgment of the representatives of\nthe people. This is true in part because the\nconstitutional test is intertwined with an assessment\nof contemporary standards and the legislative judgment\nweighs heavily in ascertaining such standards. In a\ndemocratic society legislatures, not courts, are\nconstituted to respond to the will and conse quently\nthe moral values of the people.\"\n\nEven where the burden is on the State to show that the\nrestriction imposed by the impugned statute is reasonable\nand in public interest, the extent and the manner of\ndischarge of the burden necessarily depends on the subject-\nmatter of the legislation, the nature of the inquiry, and\nthe scope and limits of judicial review. (See the\nobservations of Sastri. J. in\nState of Madras v. V.C.\nRao\n,(2) reiterated in Jagmohan).\n\nIn the instant case, the State has discharged its\nburden primarily by producing for the persual of the Court,\nthe 35th Report of the Law Commission, 1967, and the\njudgments of this Court in Jagmohan Singh and in several\nsubsequent cases, in which it has been recognised that death\npenalty serves as a deterrent. It is, therefore, for the\npetitioners to prove and establish that the death sentence\nfor murder is so outmoded, unusual or excessive as to be\ndevoid of any rational nexus with the purpose and object of\nthe legislation.\n\nThe Law Commission of India, after making an intensive\nand extensive study of the subject of death penalty in\nIndia, published\nand submitted its 35th Report in 1967 to the Government.\nAfter examining, a wealth of evidential material and\nconsidering the arguments for and against its retention,\nthat high-powered Body summed up its conclusions at page 354\nof its Report, as follows :\n\n\"The issue of abolition or retention has to be\ndecided on a balancing of the various arguments for and\nagainst retention. No single argument for abolition or\nretention can decide the issue. In arriving at any\nconclusion on the subject, the need for protecting\nsociety in general and individual human beings must be\nborne in mind.\n\nIt is difficult to rule out the validity of, of\nthe strength behind, many of the arguments for\nabolition nor does, the Commission treat lightly the\nargument based on the irrevocability of the sentence of\ndeath, the need for a modern approach, the severity of\ncapital punishment and the strong feeling shown by\ncertain sections of public opinion in stressing deeper\nquestions of human values.\n\nHaving regard, however, to the conditions in\nIndia, to the variety of the social up-bringing of its\ninhabitants, to the disparity in the level of morality\nand education in the country, to the vastness of its\narea, to diversity of its population and to the\nparamount need for maintaining law and order in the\ncountry at the present juncture, India cannot risk the\nexperiment of abolition of capital punishment.\"\n\nThis Report was also, considered by the Constitution\nBench of this Court in Jagmohan. It was the main piece of\nevidence on the basis of which the challenge to the\nconstitutional validity of Section 302 of the Penal Code, on\nthe ground of its being violative of\nArticle 19\n, was\nrepelled. Parliament must be presumed to have considered\nthese views of the Law Commission and the judgment of this\nCourt in Jagmohan, and must also have been aware of the\nprinciples crystallised by judicial precedents in the matter\nof sentencing when it took up revision of the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\nin 1973, and inserted in it, Section\n354(3) which indicates that death penalty can be awarded in\nexceptional cases for murder and for some other offences\nunder the Penal Code for special reasons to be recorded.\n\nDeath penalty has been the subject of an age-old debate\nbetween Abolitionists and Retentionists, although recently\nthe\ncontroversy has come in sharp focus. Both the groups are\ndeeply anchored in their antagonistic views. Both firmly and\nsincerly believe in the rightcousness of their respective\nstands, with overtones of sentiment and emotion. Both the\ncamps can claim among them eminent thinkers, penologists,\nsociologists, jurists; judges, legislators, administrators\nand law enforcement officials.\n\nThe chief arguments of the Abolitionists, which have\nbeen substantially adopted by the learned counsel for the\npetitioners, are as under :\n\n(a) The death penalty is irreversible. Decided upon\naccording to fallible processes of law by fallible\nhuman beings, it can be-and actually has been-\ninflicted upon people innocent of any crime.\n\n(b) There is no convincing evidence to show that death\npenalty serves any penological purpose :\n\n(i) Its deterrent effect remains unproven. It has not\nbeen shown that incidence of murder has increased\nin countries where death penalty has been\nabolished, after its abolition.\n\n(ii) Retribution in the sense of vengeance, is no\nlonger an acceptable end of punishment.\n\n(iii)On the contrary, reformation of the criminal and\nhis rehabilitation is the primary purpose of\npunishment. Imposition of death penalty nullifies\nthat purpose.\n\n(c) Execution by whatever means and for whatever\noffence is a cruel, inhuman and degrading\npunishment.\n\nIt is proposed to deal with these arguments, as far as\npossible, in their serial order.\n\nRegarding (a) : It is true that death penalty is irrevocable\nand a few instances, can be cited, including some from\nEngland, of persons who after their conviction and execution\nfor murder, were discovered to be innocent. But this,\naccording to the Retentionists is not a reason for abolition\nof the death penalty, but an argument for reform of the\njudicial system and the sentencing procedure. Theore-\ntically, such errors of judgment cannot be absolutely\neliminated from any system of justice, devised and worked by\nhuman beings, but their incidence can be infinitesimally\nreduced by providing adequate safeguards and checks. We will\npresently see, while dealing with the procedural aspect of\nthe problem, that in India, ample safeguards have been\nprovided by law and the Constitution which almost eliminate\nthe chances of an innocent person being convicted and\nexecuted for a capital offence.\n\nRegarding (b): Whether death penalty serves any penological\npurpose.\n\nFirstly, in most of the countries in the world,\nincluding India, a very large segment of the population,\nincluding notable penologists judges, jurists, legislators\nand other enlightened people still believe that death\npenalty for murder and certain other capital offences does\nserve as a deterrent, and a greater deterrent than life\nimprisonment. We will set out very briefly, by way of\nsample, opinions of some of these distinguished persons.\n\nIn the first place, we will notice a few decisions of\nCourts wherein the deterrent value of death penalty has been\njudicially recognised.\n\nIn Paras Ram v. State of Punjab,(1) the facts were that\nParas Ram, who was a fanatic devotee of the Devi, used to\nhold Satsangs at which bhajans were sung in praise of the\nGoddess. Paras Ram ceremonially beheaded his four year old\nboy at the crescendo of the morning bhajan. He was tried,\nconvicted and sentenced to death for the murder. His death\nsentence was confirmed by the High Court. He filed a\npetition for grant of special leave to appeal to this Court\nunder\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. It was contended on\nbehalf of Paras Ram that the very monstrosity of the crime\nprovided proof of his insanity sufficient to exculpate the\noffender under\nSection 84\n, Indian Penal Code, or material\nfor mitigation of the sentence of death. V. R. Krishna Iyer,\nJ., speaking for the Bench, to which one of us (Sarkaria,\nJ.) was a party, refused to grant special leave and\nsummarily dismissed the petition with these observations :\n\"The poignantly pathological grip of macabre\nsuperstitions on some crude Indian minds in the shape\nof desire to do human and animal sacrifice, in defiance\nof the scientific ethos of our cultural heritage and\nthe scientific impact of our technological century,\nshows up in crimes of primitive horror such as the one\nwe are dealing with now, where a blood-curdling\nbutehery of one's own beloved son was perpetrated,\naided by other 'pious' criminals, to propitiate some\nblood-thirsty diety. Secular India, speaking through\nthe Court, must administer shock therepy to such anti-\nsocial 'piety' when the manifestation is in terms of\ninhuman and criminal violence. When the disease is\nsocial, deterrence through court sentence must,\nperforce, operate through the individual culprit coming\nup before court. Social justice has many facets and\nJudges have a sensitive, secular and civilising role in\nsuppressing grievous injustice to humanist values by\ninflicting condign punishment on dangerous deviants.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\nIn Jagmohan, also, this Court took due note of the fact\nthat for certain types of murders, death penalty alone is\nconsidered an adequate deterrent:\n\n\"A large number of murders is undoubtedly of the\ncommon type. But some at least are diabolical in\nconception and cruel in execution. In some others where\nthe victim is a person of high standing in the country\nsociety is liable to be rocked to its very foundation.\nSuch murders cannot simply be wished away by finding\nalibis in the social maladjustment of the murderer.\nPrevalence of such crimes speaks, in the opinion of\nmany, for the inevitability of death penalty not only\nby way of deterrence but as a token of emphatic\ndisapproval of the society.\"\n\nExamining whether life imprisonment was an adequate\nsubstitute for death penalty, the Court observed:\n\n\"In the context of our criminal law which punishes\nmurder, one cannot ignore the fact that life\nimprisonment works out in most cases to a dozen years\nof punishment, and it may be seriously questioned\nwhether that sole alter-\nnative will be an adequate substitute for the death\npenalty.\"\n\nIn\nEdiga Anamma v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n,(1) V.R.\nKrishna Iyer, J., speaking for the Bench to which one of us\n(Sarkaria, J.,) was a party, observed that \"deterrence\nthrough threat of death may still be a promising strategy in\nsome frightful areas of murderous crime.\" It was further\nobserved that \"horrendous features of the crime and the\nhapless and helpness state of the victim steel the heart of\nlaw for the sterner sentence.\"\n\nIn\nShiv Mohan Singh v. State (Delhi Administration\n),(2)\nthe same learned Judge, speaking for the Court, reiterated\nthe deterrent effect of death penalty by referring to his\nearlier judgment in\nEdiga Annamma\n's case, as follows:\n\n\"In Ediga Annamma this Court, while noticing the\nsocial and personel circumstances possessing an\nextenuating impact, has equally clearly highlighted\nthat in India under present conditions deterrence\nthrough death penalty may not be a time-barred\npunishment in some frightful areas of barbarous\nmurder.\"\n\nAgain, in\nCharles Sobraj v. The Superintendent, Central\nJail, Tihar, New Delhi\n,(3) the same learned Judge, speaking\nfor a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court,\nreiterated that deterrence was one of the vital\nconsiderations of punishment.\n\nIn Trop v. Dulleh,(4) Brennan, J. of the supreme Court\nof the United States, concurring with the majority,\nemphasised the deterrent end of punishment, in these words:\n\n\"Rehabilitation is but one of the several purposes\nof the penal law. Among other purposes are deterrents\nof the wrongful act by the threat of punishment and\ninsulation of society from dangerous individuals by\nimprisonment or execution.\"\nIn Furman v. Georgia, Stewart, J. took the view that\ndeath penalty serves a deterrent as well as retributive\npurpose. In his view, certain criminal conduct is so\natrocious that society's interest in deterrence and\nretribution wholly outweighs any considerations of reform or\nrehablitation of the perpetrator, and that, despite the\ninconclusive empirical evidence, only penalty of death will\nprovide maximum deterrence.\n\nSpeaking for the majority, in Gregg v. Georgia,\nStewart, J. reiterated his views with regard to the\ndeterrent and retributive effect of death penalty.\n\nNow, we may notice by way of specimen, the views of\nsome jurists and scholars of note. Sir James Fitzjames\nStephen, the great jurist, who was concerned with the\ndrafting of the\nIndian Penal Code\n, also, was a strong\nexponent of the view that capital punishment has the\ngreatest value as a deterrent for murder and other capital\noffence. To quote his words:\n\n\"No other punishment deters men so effectually\nfrom committing crimes as the punishment of death. This\nis one of those propositions which it is difficult to\nprove, simply because they are in themselves more\nobvious than any proof can make them. It is possible to\ndisplay ingenuity in arguing against it, but that is\nall. The whole experience of mankind is in the other\ndirection. The threat of instant death is the one to\nwhich resort has always been made when there was an\nabsolute necessity for producing some result. No one\ngoes to certain inevitable death except by compulsion.\nPut the matter the other the way. Was there ever yet a\ncriminal who, when sentenced to death and brought out\nto die, would refuse to offer of commutation of his\nsentence for the severest secondary punishment? Surely\nnot. Why is this ? It can only be because 'All that a\nman has will he give for his life'. In any secondary\npunishment, however terrible, there is hope; but death\nis death; its terrors cannot be described more\nforcibly.\"\n\nEven Marchese De Cesare Bonesana Beccaria, who can be\ncalled the father of the modern Abolitionist movement,\nconcedes in his treatise, \"Dei Delitti a della Pana\" (1764),\nthat capital punishment would be justified in two instances:\n\nFirstly, in an execution\nwould prevent a revolution against popularly established\nGovernment; and, secondly, if an execution was the only way\nto deter others from committing a crime. The adoption of\ndouble standards for capital punishment in the realm of\nconscience is considered by some scholars as the biggest\ninfirmity in the Abolitionists' case.\n\nThorsten Sallin is one of the penologists who has made\na scientific study of the subject of capital punishment and\ncomplied the views of various scholars of the 19th and 20th\ncenturies. In his book \"Capital Punishment\", he has made an\nattempt to assemble the arguments for and against the death\npenalty. He has also given extracts from the Debates in the\nBritish House of Commons in 1956 and, also, in March and\nApril 1966, in the Candian House of Commons. In the last\npart of his book, the learned Editor summarises his ideas\nabout capital punishment. In his opinion, Retribution seems\nto be outdated and unworkable. It is neither efficient nor\nequitably administered. \"Justice is a relative concept that\nchanges with the times\". A retributive philosophy alone is\nnot now socially acceptable. \"In the last analysis, the only\nutilitarian argument that has being to be given attention is\nthe one that defends capital punishment as a uniquely\npowerful means of protecting the community.\" He ends his\nbook with the observation : \"I have attempted to show that,\nas now used, capital punishment performs none of the\nutilitarian functions claimed by its supporters, nor can it\never be made to serve such functions. It is an archaic\ncustom of primitive origin that has disappeared in most\ncivilized countries and is withering away in the rest.\"\n\nIn his article appearing in \"Criminology Review Year\nBook\" (1979) Vol. 1, complied by Sheldon L. Messinger & Egon\nBittner(1), Isaac Ehrlich, after surveying the past\nliterature on the relation between capital punishment and\ncapital crimes, has (at pp. 31-33) pointed out the following\nshortcomings in the thesis of Sellin :\n\n\"The principal shortcoming of the work by Sellin\nand others using his methodology is that the approach\ntaken and the methods applied do not permit a\nsystematic examination of the main implications\nemanating from the general theory of deterrence. The\nshortcoming is basic, because the implications\nfollowing from the general deterrence\nhypothesis are what Sellin was challenging. Yet his\nwork neither develops nor tests the full range of\nimplications following from the theory he attempts to\nreject; nor does he develop or test a competing theory.\nIn addition, to my knowledge, Sellin never reported in\nany of his studies the results of any systematic\n(parametric or non-parametric) statistical tests that\ncould justify his strong and unqualified inferences.\"\n\n... ... ...\n\n\"Another fundamental shortcoming of Sellin's\nstudies is their failure to account systematically for\nother factors that are expected by the deterrence\nhypothesis to affect the frequency of murder in the\npopulation, apart from the relevant risk of execution.\nThese are variables such as the probability of\napprehension, the conditional probability of conviction\ngiven apprehension, the severity of alternative\npunishments for murder, the distribution of income, the\nprobability of unemployment, and other indicators of\ndifferential gains from criminal activities occurring\njointly with murder. Since, as I shall argue later,\nsome of these variables are expected to be highly\ncorrelated with the conditional probability of\nexecution given conviction of murder, their exclusion\nfrom the statistical analysis can seriously bias\nestimates of the partial deterrent effect of capital\npunishment. Aware of the problem, Sellin attempted to\ncompare states that are as alike as possible in all\nother respects. However, his \"matching procedure\",\nbased on the assumption that neighbouring states can\nsatisfy such pre-requisites without any explicit\nstandardization, is simply insufficient for any valid\ninferences. Pairs of states, such as New York, and\nRhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine, or Illinois and\nWisconsin all included in his comparisons, differ in\ntheir economic and demographic characteristics, in\ntheir law enforcement activities, and in the\nopportunities they provide for the commission of other\ncrimes. Moreover, the direction of the causal\nrelationship between the murder rate and the overall\nrisk of punishment-be it the death penalty or any other\nsanction - is not self-evident because, for example,\nstates with high murder rates are expected to and, in\nfact do devote more\nresources to apprehend, convict and execute offenders\nthan do states with lower rates. Specifically,\nvariations in the legal or practical status of the\ndeath penalty occasionally may be the result of, rather\nthan the cause for, changes in the murder rate, and\nthus may give rise to an apparent positive association\nbetween these two variables. The same general point\napplies in connection with the identification of the\neffect of any other variable which is a product of law\nenforcement activity or private protection against\ncrime. For these reasons, the true deterrent effect of\na sanction such as the death penalty cannot be readily\ninferred from simple comparisons of the sort performed\nby Sellin.\"\n\nThe learned author then (at page 33) arrives at this\nconclusion :\n\n\"If investigations indicate that probability and\nlength of imprisonment do impart significant deterrent\neffects, then failure of the research to demonstrate\nspecifically the deterrent efficacy of capital\npunishment may be taken more as evidence for\nshortcomings in the research design and methodology or\nin the measures of the theoretically relevant variables\nused than as a reflection on the validity of the\ndeterrence theory itself.\"\n\nThe scholar then stresses another purpose of capital\npunishment, namely, incapacitation of the offender, which,\nin fact, is another aspect of its deterrent effect. To quote\nhis words :\n\n\"There is an additional point worth stressing.\nEven if punishment by execution or imprisonment does\nnot have any deterrent effect, surely it must exert\nsome incapacitative effect on punished offenders by\nreducing or eliminating the possibility of recidivism\non their part.\"\n\nThis eminent social scientist, Prof. Ehrlich(1) whose\nviews we have extracted, has made intensive studies of the\ndeterrent effect of capital punishment. Then, a result of\nhis study was also published\nin the American Economic Review in June, 1975. He includes a\nspecific test for the presence of a deterrent effect of\ncapital punishment to the results of earlier studies. He has\nin his study(1) claimed to identify a significant reduction\nin the murder rate due to the use of capital punishment. A\nversion of his detailed study is said to have been filed\nwith the United States Supreme Court on March 7, 1975 in the\ncase of Fowler v. North Carolina.(2)\nIn 1975, Robert Martinson, a sociologist, published the\nresults of a study he had made in New York regarding the\nrehabilitation of of prisoners. Among the conclusions he\ndrew: \"The prison which makes every effort at rehabilitation\nsucceeds no better than the prison which leaves its inmates\nto rot....The certainty of punishment rather than the\nseverity, is the most effective crime deterrent. We should\nmake plain that prisons exist to punish people for crimes\ncommitted.\"\n\n(Quoted in Encyclopaedia Britannica 1978 Book of the\nYear, pp. 593-594)\nMany judges-especially in Britain and the United\nStates, where rising crime rates are the source of much\npublic concern-have expressed grave doubts about the wisdom\nof the view that reform ought to take priority in dealing\nwith offenders. \"They have argued that the courts must\nreflect a public abhorrence of crime and that justice\ndemands that some attempt be made to impose punishment\nfitting to the crime.\"\n\n(Encyclopaedia Britannica, ibid.)\nProfessor Jean Graven, Judge of the Court of Appeal of\nGeneva, and a distinguished jurist, maintains in his learned\nanalysis, (see the Postscript in reply to A World View of\nCapital Punishment by James Avery Joyce), of the views of\nCamus and Koestler, that neither of these two authors has\nfaced up to the really basic objection to the abolitionist's\ncase. According to Graven, there are two groups of people,\nwhich are not covered by the abolitionist's case and Camus\nand Koestler have therefore left their cause open to attack\nat its\n_______________________\n(1) See Lee S. Friedman's article at pages 61-87, Review\nYear Book, 1979, compiled by Messinger and Bittner.\n(2) 428 US 904=49 L. Ed. 1212 (1976).\nweakest point. \"The true problem\", as Graven sees it, \"is\nthe protection of the organized, civilized community\", the\nlegitimate defence of society against criminal attacks made\nupon it by those anti-social elements which can be stopped\nonly by being eliminated, in the \"last resort\". \"For such,\nthe death penalty should be preserved, and only for such\".\n\nProfessors Graven's second challenge is, which the\nabolitionist must accept, the existing division between\ncivil and military protection. According to him, in doing\nso, the abolitionist cannot avoid applying double standard\nand two mutually destructive criteria to their approach to\nthe death penalty. \"For if the death penalty is accepted as\nprotective in principle to society, then it should be so in\nall cases and in all circumstances in troubled times as well\nas in peaceful times, in respect of the traitor, the spy,\nthe deserter, or the hostage, as well as of the brigand, the\n\"gangster\", or the professional killer. We must be logical\nand just at the same time. In the realm of conscience and of\n'principles', there cannot be two weights and measures.\nThere cannot be a morality for difficult times and another\nmorality for easy times; one standard for military justice\nand another for civil justice. What then should be done with\nthose individuals who have always been considered proper\nsubjects for elimination? If the capital sentence is\nobjectionable and illegal...If the death penalty must be\nabsolutely repudiated because it 'degrades man, (quoting\nCamus) then we accept the position. But, in that case, no\nright to kill exists any longer...the greatest war\ncriminals, those responsible conscious of what they have\ndone and intended to do-for the worst crimes of genocide,\nwho gassed, incinerated in ovens or buried in quicklime a\nmillion innocent victims, or allowed them to perish in mines\nand marshes...Society has not the right then to kill even\nthese \"Monsters\".\n\n(Quoted in A World View of Capital Punishment, by James\nAvery Joyce).\n\nJ.J. Maclean, a Parliamentarian, articulated his views\nwith regard to the deterrent, value of capital punishment in\nthe Canadian House of Commons in the March-April, Debates\n1966, as follows:\n\n\"Whether it (capital punishment) is a greater or\nlesser deterrent than life imprisonment. This is an\nargument that cannot be proven on either side but I\nwould not like to\nhave to try to convince any one that capital punishment\nis not a deterrent. Statistically this cannot be proven\nbecause the deterrent effect on both capital punishment\nand life imprisonment is obscured by the fact that most\ncriminals plan a crime on the basis that they are going\nto avoid any penalty...I say, the deterrent value is\nwith respect to people who did not commit crimes, who\nwere deterred from becoming murderers by the fact that\ncapital punishment or some other heavy penalty would be\nmeted outto them if caught.\"\n\n(Quoted in Sellin's Capital Punishment).\n\nThe Law Commission of India in its 35th Report, after\ncarefully sifting all the materials collected by them,\nrecorded their views regarding the deterrent effect of\ncapital punishment as follows:\n\n\"In our view capital punishment does act as a\ndeterrent. We have already discussed in detail several\naspects of this topic. We state below, very briefly,\nthe main points that have weighed with us in arriving\nat this conclusion:\n\n(a) Basically, every human being dreads death.\n\n(b) Death, as a penalty, stands on a totally different\nlevel from imprisonment for life or any otber\npunishment. The difference is one of quality, and\nnot merely of degree.\n\n(c) Those who are specifically qualified to express an\nopinion on the subject, including particularly the\nmajority of the replies received from State\nGovernments, Judges, Members of Parliament and\nLegislatures and Members of the Bar and police\nofficers-are definitely of the view that the\ndeterrent object of capital punishment is achieved\nin a fair measure in India.\n\n(d) As to conduct of prisoners released from jail\n(after undergoing imprisonment for life), it would\nbe difficult to come to a conclusion, without\nstudies extending over a long period of years.\n(e) Whether any other punishment can possess all the\nadvantages of capital punishment is a matter of\ndoubt.\n\n(f) Statisties of other countries are inconclusive on\nthe subject. If they are not regarded as proving\nthe deterrent effect; neither can they be regarded\nas conclusively disproving it.\"\n\nViews of the British Royal Commission:\n\nThe British Royal Commission, after making an\nexhaustive study of the issue of capital punishment and its\ndeterrent value, in their Report (1949-53), concluded:\n\n\"The general conclusion which we reach, after\ncareful review of all the evidence we have been able to\nobtain as to the deterrent effect of capital\npunishment, may be stated as follows. Prima facie the\npenalty of death is likely to have a stronger effect as\na deterrent to normal human beings than any other form\nof punishment, and there is some evidence (though no\nconvincing statistical evidence) that this is in fact\nso. But this effect does not operate universally or\nuniformly, and there are many offenders on whom it is\nlimited and may often be negligible.\"\n\nWe may add that whether or not death penalty in actual\npractice acts as a deterrent, cannot be statistically\nproved, either way, because statistics as to how many\npotentisim murderers were deterred from committing murders,\nbut for the existence of capital punishment for murder, are\ndifficult, if not altogether impossible, to collect. Such\nstatistics of deterred potential murderers are difficult to\nunravel as they remain hidden in the innermost recesses of\ntheir mind.\n\nRetribution in the sense of reprobation whether a\ntotally rejected concept of punishment.\n\nEven retribution in the sense of society's reprobation\nfor the worst of crimes, i.e., murder, is not an altogether\noutmoded concept. This view is held by many distinguished\nsociologist, jurists and judges.\n\nLord Justice Denning, Master of the Rolls of the\nCourt of\nAppeal in England, appearing before the British Royal\nCommission on Capital Punishment, stated his views on this\npoint as under:\n\n\"Punishment is the way in which society expresses\nits denunciation of wrong-doing, and, in order to\nmaintain respect for law, it is essential that the\npunishment inflicted for grave crimes should adequately\nreflect the revulsion felt by the great majority of\ncitizens for them. It is a mistake to consider the\nobjects of punishment as being deterrent or reformative\nor preventive and nothing else...The truth is that some\ncrimes are so outrageous that society insists on\nadequate punishment, because the wrong-doer deserves\nit, irrespective of whether it is a deterrent or not.\"\n\nThat retribution is still socially acceptable function of\npunishment, was also the view expressed by Stewart, J., in\nFurman v. Georgia, at page 389, as follows:\n\n\"...I would say only that I cannot agree that\nretribution is a constitutionally impermissible\ningredient in the imposition of punishment. The\ninstinct for retribution is part of the nature of man,\nand channeling that instant, in the administration of\ncriminal justice serves an important purpose in\npromoting the stability of a society governed by law.\nWhen people begin to believe that organized society is\nunwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders\nthe punishment they 'deserve', then there are sown the\nseeds of anarchy of self help, vigilant justice, and\nlynch law.\"\n\nPatrick Devlin, the eminent jurist and judge, in his\nbook, \"The Judge\", emphasises the retributive aspect of the\npurpose of punishment and criminal justice, thus:\n\n\"I affirm that justice means retribution and\nnothing else. Vindictiveness is the emotional outflow\nof retribution and justice has no concern with that.\nBut it is concerned with the measurement of deserts.\nThe point was put lucidly and simply by the Vicar of\nLongton in a letter to The Times, from which with his\npermission I quote: Firstly, far from pretending that\nretribution should have no place in our penal system,\nMr. Levin should recognize that it is\nlogically impossible to remove it. If it were removed,\nall punishments should be rendered unjust. What could\nbe more immoral than to inflict imprisonment on a\ncriminal for the sake of deterring others, if he does\nnot deserve it? Or would it be justified to subject him\nto a compulsory attempt to reform which includes a\ndenial of liberty unless, again he deserves it?.\nRetribution and deterrence are not two divergent ends\nof capital punishment. They are convergent goals which\nultimately merge into one. How these ends of punishment\ncoalesce into one was described by the Law Commission of\nIndia, thus:\n\n\"The retributive object of capital punishment has\nbeen the subject-matter of sharp attack at the hands of\nthe abolitionists. We appreciate that many persons\nwould regard the instinct of revenge as barbarous. How\nfar it should form part of the penal philosophy in\nmodern times will always remain a matter of\ncontroversy. No useful purpose will be served by a\ndiscussion as to whether the instinct of retribution is\nor is not commendable. The fact remains, however, that\nwhenever there is a serious crime, the society feels a\nsense of disapprobation. If there is any element of\nretribution in the law, as administered now, it is not\nthe instinct of the man of jungle but rather a refined\nevolution of that instinct the feeling prevails in the\npublic is a fact of which notice is to be taken. The\nlaw does not encourage it, or exploit it for any\nundesirable ends. Rather, by reserving the death\npenalty for murder, and thus visiting this gravest\ncrime with the gravest punishment, the law helps the\nelement of retribution merge into the element of\ndeterrence.\"\n\n[Para 265 (18), 35th Report]\nEarlier in 1949-1953, the British Royal Commission in\nPara 59 of its Report spoke in a somewhat similar strain:\n\n\"We think it is reasonable to suppose that the\ndeterrent force of capital punishment operates not only\nby affecting the conscious thoughts of individuals\ntempted to commit murder, but also by building up in\nthe community, over a\nlong period of time, a deep feeling of peculiar\nabhorrence for the crime of murder. The fact that men\nare hung for murder is one great reason why murder is\nconsidered so dreadful a crime. This widely diffused\neffect on the moral consciousness of society is\nimpossible to assess, but it must be at least as\nimportant as any direct part which the death penalty\nmay play as a deterrent in the calculations of\npotential murderers.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Ernest Van Den Haag, a New York\npsychologist and author, and a leading proponent of death\npenalty, \"a very strong symbolic value\" attaches to\nexecutions. \"The motives for the death penalty may indeed\ninclude vengeance. Legal vengeance solidifies social\nsolidarity against law-breakers and probably is the only\nalternative to the disruptive private revenge of those who\nfeel harmed.\"\n\n(See The Voice (USA) June 4, 1979)\nThe views of Lloyd George, who was the Prime Minister\nof England during the First World War, have been referred to\nin the book \"Capital Punishment\" (1967) by Thorsten Sellin\nat page 65, as below:\n\n\"The first function of capital punishment is to\ngive emphatic expression to society's peculiar\nabhorrence of murder....It is important that murder\nshould be regarded with peculiar horror...I believe\nthat capital punishment does, in the present state of\nsociety, both express and sustain the sense of moral\nrevulsion for murder.\"\n\nThis view is not without respectable support in the\njurisprudential literature of today, despite an opinion to\nthe contrary. (See also the Royal Commission's Report, 1949-\n\n53). In relying, inter alia, upon the evidence before it,\nincluding that of Lord Denning, the Royal Commission\nrecognised a strong and widespread demand for retribution.\nIt is a common phenomenon in all the civilized countries\nthat some murders are so shockingly offensive that there is\na general outcry from the public for infliction of the\nultimate penalty on the criminal.\n\nIn regard to the retributive aspect of capital\npunishment, we may cite one recent illustration showing how\ndemand for retribu-\ntion, in the sense of society's instinctive disapproval of\nthe outrageous conduct of the murderer is indelibly\ningrained in contemporary public opinion even in advanced\ncountries.\n\nIn November 1978, George Moscone (Mayor) and Harvey\nMilk (Supervising Officer) of San Francisco were cruelly,\nassassinated by Dan White, a police-man. Six months later,\non May 22, 1979, a jury of seven men and five women rejected\nthe charge of first-degree murder, and in consequence, did\nnot award capital punishment to Dan White for this heinous\ndouble murder. Public opinion reacted sharply. Public\nprotest against this decision spontaneously manifested\nitself in a burst of flame and fury. Thousands of outraged\ndemonstrators rampaged through the Civic Centre, smashing\nwindows, burning police cars, chanting: \"We want justice\"\n\nWriting in 'The Voice', a local paper from San Franscisco,\nin its issue of June 4, 1979, Lawrence Mullen, fired at the\njury a volley of questions, to which the agitated public\nwould demand answers:\n\n\"What comment did the jury make on the value of\nlife? Was the tragedy of the execution-style murders\nthe central issue, or was the jury only concerned with\ntechnicalities, absurdities and loopholes of the law?\nWas justice considered not revenge but justice? High\nirony, Dan White's strong belief in capital punishment\nhas found thousands of new converts. From now on, a lot\nof people will die because Dan White lives. Are we so\ninsensitive, callous and inhuman that we accept or\nexcuse violence and brutality? Consider White's defence\nlawyer, Douglas Schmidt's reference to that tragic\nMonday in November: \"It was a tragedy. Now it's behind\nus.\"\n\n\"For those who loved and still miss George Moscone\nand Harvey Milk, for those who were cast into darkness\nand cried for justice, for those who still seek\nanswers, the lawyer's words are a chilling reminder\nthat we must not forget-that we must not 'put it behind\nus'.\"\n\nThe former cop, a law and order and capital\npunishment advocate driven by his passion, by his lack\nof reason, to destroy those who he disagreed with, and\nby doing so\ndemonstrated the greatest human failure-the inability\nto co-exist.\n\n\"Dan White symbolizes the violence and brutality\nthat is undermining civilization.\"\n\nDan White's case and the spontaneous reaction of the\npublic opinion that followed, show that opposition to\ncapital punishment has (to use the words of Raspberry),\"(1)\nmuch more appeal when the discussion is merely academic than\nwhen the community is confronted with a crime, or a series\nof crimes, so gross, so heinous, so cold-blooded that\nanything short of death seems an inadequate response\".\n\nThe Editor of 'Capital Punishment', Thorsten Sellin has\nnoted at page 83 of his compilation, the following views of\nan outstanding Justice of the Ontario Appeal Court:\n\n\"The irrevocable character of the death penalty is\na reason why all possible measures should be taken\nagainst injustice-not for its abolition. Now a days,\nwith the advent of armed criminals and the substantial\nincrease in armed robberies, criminals of long standing\nif arrested, must expect long sentences. However, if\nthey run no risk of hanging, when found guilty of\nmurder, they will kill police men and witnesses with\nthe prospect of a future no more unhappy, as one of\nthem put it, than being fed, lodged, and clothed for\nthe rest of their lives. In addition, once in prison,\nsuch people who are capable of anything could kill\ntheir guards and their fellow inmates with relative\nimpunity.\"\n\nJ.J. Maclean, the Canadian Parliamentarian justifies,\nfrom another angle, the right of the State to award capital\npunishment for murder:\n\n\"If the State has the right and the duty to defend\nthe community against outside aggression, such as in\ntime of war, and within the country, for instance, in\ncase of treason\n______________\n(1) Raspberry, Death Sentence, the Washington Post,\nMarch 12, 1976, p, 27 cols. 5-6.\ncrimes against the State, etc., and that to the extent\nof taking the life of the aggressors and guilty\nparties, if the citizen wants to protect his own life\nby killing whoever attacks him without any reason, the\nState can do the same when a criminal attacks and\nendangers the life of the community by deciding to\neliminate summarily another human being. Capital\npunishment must be retained to prove the sanctity of\nthat most precious thing which is the gift of life; it\nembodies the revulsion and horror that we feel for the\ngreatest of crimes...For most people, life is priceless\nand they will do anything and suffer the worst\nprivations to preserve it, even when life itself does\nnot hold many consolations or bright prospects for the\nfuture. As a deterrent, the death penalty is playing\nits part for which there is no substitute...I suggest\nthat statistics do not prove much, either on one side\nor the other.... There are too many variations, too\nmany changes as regards circumstances, condition\nbetween one period and the other, to enable us to make\nworthy comparisons.\"\n\n(See page 84 of Sellin's Capital Punishment).\nSome penologists justify capital penalty and life\nimprisonment on the 'isolation' or 'elimination' theory of\ncrime and punishment. Vernon Rich in his \"Law & the\nadministration of justice\" (Second Edition, at page 10),\nsays:\n\n\"The isolation theory of crime and punishment is\nthat the criminal law is a device for identifying\npersons dangerous to society who are then punished by\nbeing isolated from society as a whole, so that they\ncannot commit other antisocial acts. The isolation\ntheory is used to justify the death penalty and long-\nterm imprisonment. Obviously, this theory is effective\nin preventing criminal acts by those executed or\npermanently incarcerated.\"\n\nWhile the Abolitionists look upon death penalty as\nsomething which is per se immoral and inhuman, the\nRetentionists apprehened that if we surrender even the risk\nof the last remaining horrifying deterrent by which to\nfrighten the toughts of the underworld, we may\neasily tip the scales in favour of the anti-social hoodlums.\nThey fear that abolition of capital punishment, will result\nin increase of murders motivated by greed, and in affable\n\"crime passionelle.\"\n\n\"It is feared\", wrote George A. Floris,(1) \"the most\ndevastating effects of the abolition will, however, show\nthemselves in the realm of political murder. An adherent of\npolitical extremism is usually convinced that the victory of\nhis cause is just round the corner. So, for him long term\nimprisonment holds no fear. He is confident that the coming\nascendency of his friends will soon liberate him.\" To prove\nthis proposition, Floris cites the instance of Von Paper's\nGovernment who in September 1932, reprieved the death\nsentence passed on two of Hitler's storm-troopers for brutal\nkilling of one of their political opponents. The\nRetentionists believe that the dismantling of the gallows\nwill almost everywhere enhance the hit and run attacks on\npolitical opponents. On this premise, they argue that\ncapital punishment is the most formidable safeguard against\nterrorism.\n\nThe argument cannot be rejected out of hand. A number\nof instances can be cited where abolitionist States feeling\nthe inadequacy of their penological armour to combat\npolitically motivated gangsterism, have retrieved and used\ntheir capital weapon which they had once thrown away.\nDespite their traditional abhorrence of death penalty, the\nNorwegians executed Major Vedkun Quisling after World War\nII. The Belgians, too, executed no less than 242\ncollaborators' and traitors after the liberation, although\nin their country, the death penalty was otiose since 1880.\n\nIn England, death penalty was retained for high treason\nin the Silverman Bill of 1956. Even at present, for that\noffence, death penalty is a valid sanction in England. In\nthe aftermath of assassination of Prime Minister Bandernaike\nin 1959, Ceylon hurriedly reintroduced capital punishment\nfor murder. Owing to similar considerations, Israel\nsanctioned death penalty for crimes committed against the\nJewish people, and executed the notorious Jew-baiter, Adolf\nEichmann in 1962. Recently, on April 9, 1979, confronted\nwith a wave of violent incidents after the signing of Egypt-\nIsrael Peace Treaty. Israel sanctioned the use of death\npenalty \"for acts of inhuman cruelty\".\n\n____________\n(1) Sunday Tribune, December 8, 1963.\nIn India, very few scientific studies in regard to\ncrime and punishment in general, and capital punishment, in\nparticular, have been made. Counsel for the petitioners\nreferred us to Chapter VI, captioned 'Capital Punishment, in\nthe book, 'Quantum of Punishment in Criminal Law in India,\nwritten by Dr. Kripal Singh Chhabra, now on the staff of\nG.N. University, Amritsar. In this article, which was\nprimarily meant as LL. D. thesis, the learned author\nconcludes:\n\n\"On the basis of statistics both of India and\nabroad, U.N.O. findings and other weighty arguments, we\ncan safely conclude that death penalty is not\nsustainable on merits. Innately it has no reformative\nelement. It has been proved that death penalty as\noperative carries no deterrent value and crime of\nmurder is governed by factors other than death penalty.\nAccordingly, I feel that the death penalty should be\nabolished.\"\n\nIt will be seen, in the first place, that the analysis\nby Dr. Chhabra in coming to the conclusion, that death\npenalty is of no penological value, is based on stale,\nincomplete and inadequate statistics. This is more\nparticularly true of the data relating to India, which does\nnot cover the period subsequent to 1961. Secondly, the\napproach to the problem adopted by him, like the other\nAbolitionists referred to by him, is mainly, if not merely,\nstatistical.\n\nAs already noticed, the proponents of the opposite view\nof capital punishment, point out that statistics alone are\nnot determinative of the question whether or not death\npenalty serves any deterent or other penological purpose.\nFirstly, statistics of deterred potential murderers are hard\nto obtain. Secondly, the approach adopted by the\nAbolitionists is oversimplified at the cost of other\nrelevant but imponderable factors, the appreciation of which\nis essential to assess the true penological value of capital\npunishment. The number of such factors is infinitude, their\ncharacter variable duration transient and abstract\nformulation difficult. Conditions change from country to\ncountry and time to time. Due to the inconstancy of social\nconditions, it is not scientifically possible to assess with\nany degree of accuracy, as to whether the variation in the\nincidence of capital crime is attributable to the presence\nor absence of death penalty in the penal law of that country\nfor such crimes.\nThat is why statistical attempts to assess the true\npenological value of capital punishment, remain\ninconclusive.\n\nPursued beyond a certain point, both the Abolitionists\nand the Retentionists retreat into their own conceptual\nbunkers firmly entrenched in their respective \"faiths\". We\nneed not take sides with either of them. There is always a\ndanger in adhering too rigidly to concepts. As Prof. Brett\nhas pointed out \"all concepts are abstractions from reality,\nand that in the process of abstraction something of the\nreality is bound to be lost''(1). We must therefore, view\nthe problem against the perspective of the hard realities of\nthe time and the conditions prevailing in the world,\nparticularly in our own country.\n\nA review of the world events of the last seven or eight\nyears, as evident from Encyclopaedia Britannica Year Books\nand other material referred to by the learned counsel, would\nshow that most countries in the world are in the grip of an\never-rising tide of violent crime. Murders for monetary gain\nor from misdirected political motives, robbery, rape assault\nare on the increase. India is no exception. The Union of\nIndia has produced for our perusal a statement of facts and\nfigures showing the incidence of violent crime, including\nmurder, dacoity and robbery, in the various States of India,\nduring the years 1965 to 1975. Another statement has been\nfurnished showing the number of persons convicted of murder\nand other capital offences and sentenced to death in some of\nthe States of India during the period 1974 to 1978. This\nstatement however, is incomplete and inadequate. On account\nof that deficiency and for the general reasons set out\nabove, it cannot, even statistically show conclusively or\nwith any degree of certainty, that capital punishment has no\npenological worth. But the first statement does bring out\nclearly the stark reality that the crimes of murder, dacoity\nand robbery in India are since 1965 increasing.\n\nNow, looking around at the world during the last\ndecade, we may recall that in Purman v. Georgia (decided on\nJune 29, 1976), the Supreme Court of the United States held\nby a majority, that the imposition and carrying out of the\ndeath penalty constitutes 'cruel and unusual' punishment, in\nviolation of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n____________\n(1) An Enquiry into Criminal Guilt by Prof. Peter\nBrett, 1963 Edn. Melbourne, page 13.\nAmendments. Brennan and Marshall, JJ. (differing from the\nplurality) went to the extent of holding that death penalty\nwas per se unconstitutional as it was a cruel and unusual\npunishment. In so holding, these learned Justices purported\nto adopt the contemporary standards of decency prevailing\namong the enlightened public of the United States. Justice\nMarshall ruled that \"it was morally unacceptable to the\npeople of the United States\". This opinion of the learned\nJustices was sharply rebuffed by the people of the United\nStates through their chosen representatives. Soon after the\ndecision in Furman, bowing to the thrust of public opinion,\nthe Legislatures of not less than 32 States, post-haste\nrevised their penal laws and reinstituted death penalty for\nmurder and certain other crimes. Public opinion polls then\ntaken show that approximately 70 per cent of Americans have\nbeen in favour of death penalty. (See 'The Voice', supra).\nIn 1976, a Gallup Poll taken in the Unitted States showed\nthat more than 65 per cent of those polled preferred to have\nan operative death penalty.\n\nIncidently, the rejection by the people of the approach\nadopted by the two learned Judges in Furman, furnishes proof\nof the fact that judicial opinion does not necessarily\nreflect the moral attitudes of the people. At the same time,\nit is a reminder that Judges should not take upon themselves\nthe responsibility of becoming oracles or spokesmen of\npublic opinion: Not being representatives of the people, it\nis often better, as a matter of judicial restraint, to leave\nthe function of assessing public opinion to the chosen\nrepresentatives of the people in the legislature concerned.\n\nComing back to the review of the world crime situation,\nduring the last decade, Saudi Arabia and some other\ncountries have reinstated death penalty or enacted harsher\npunishments not only for murder but some other crimes, also.\nIn America, apart from 32 States which reinstated death\npenalty under revised laws after Furman, the legislatures of\nsome of the remaining 15 States have either reinstituted or\nare considering to reintroduce death penalty. Currently, a\nfederal legislation for reinstituting or prescribing capital\npunishment for a larger range of offences of homicide is\nunder consideration of United States' Congress. According to\nthe report of the Amnesty International, in U.S.A., as on\nMay 1, 1979, death penalty can be imposed for aggravated\nmurder in 35 States. Attempts have been made in other\ncountries, also to reintroduce death penalty. In Britain, in\nthe wake of serious violent incidents of terrorism, a Bill\nwas moved in Parliament to reintroduce capital punishment\nfor murder and certain other offences. It was defeated by a\nfree vote on April 19, 1979. Even so, no less than 243\nMembers of Parliament had voted in favour of this measure.\nWe have noted that Israel has also recently reinstituted\ndeath penalty for certain criminal 'acts of in human\ncruelty'. In People's Republic of China, a new legislation\nwas adopted on July 1, 1979 by China's Parliament, according\nto\nArticle 43\nof which, death penalty can be imposed \"for\nthe most heinous crimes\". In Argentina, the death penalty\nwas reintroduced in 1976. Similarly, Belgium reintroduced\ndeath penalty and increased the number of crimes punishable\nwith death. In France, in 1978 a movement in favour of\nabolition initiated by the French bishops failed to change\nthe law under which death penalty is a valid sanction for\nmurder and certain other offences. In Japan, death penalty\nis a legal sanction for 13 crimes. In Greece and Turkey,\ndeath penalty can be imposed for murder and other capital\noffences. In Malaysia and the Republic of Singapore under\nthe\nDrugs Act\nof May, 1979, misuse of drugs is also\npunishable with death. Cuba introduced a new penal code in\nFebruary 1978, which provides punishment of death by\nshooting for crimes ranging from some types of murder and\nrobbery to hijacking and rape.\n\nIn the U.S.S.R. (Russia), as many as 18 offences are\npunishable with death. In Russia, at present, the following\noffences committed in peacetime are punishable with death\nunder the RSFSR Criminal Code:\n\n\"Treason (\nArticle 64\n); espoinage (\nArticle 65\n);\nterrorism (if the offence includes the killing of an\nofficial (\nArticle 66\n); terrorism against representative\nof foreign State (if the offence includes the killing\nof such a representative \"for the purpose of provoking\nwar or international compli cations\") (\nArticle 67\n);\nsabotage (\nArticle 68\n); organizing the commission of any\nof the above-named offences (\nArticle 72\n); commission of\nany of the above-named offences against other Working\nPeople's State (\nArticle 73\n); banditry (\nArticle 77\n);\nactions disrupting the work of corrective labour\ninstitutions (Article 77-1); making or passing\ncounterfeit money or securities (when the offence is\ncommitted as a form of business) (\nArticle 87\n);\nviolation of rules for currency transactions (when\ncommitted as a form of business or on\na large scale, or by a person previously convicted\nunder this Article) (\nArt. 88\n); stealing of State\nproperty on an especially large scale, regardless of\nthe manner of stealing (Article 93-1); intentional\nhomicide with aggravating circumstances (\nArticle 102\n);\nrape, when committed by a group of persons or by an\nespecially dangerous recidivist, or resulting in\nespecially grave consequences, or the rape of a minor\n(\nArticle 117\n); taking a bribe, with especially\naggravating circumstances (\nArticle 173\n); infringing the\nlife of a policeman or People's Guard, with aggravating\ncircumstances (Article 191-2); hijacking an aircraft,\nif the offence results in death or serious physical\ninjuries (Article 213-2); resisting a superior or\ncompelling him to violate official duties, an offence\napplicable only to military personnel, and carrying the\ndeath penalty in peace-time if committed in conjunction\nwith intentional homicide of a superior or any other\nperson performing military duties (\nArticle 240\n).\"\n\n(Vide, Report of Amnesty International, 1979)\nOur object in making the above survey is to bring out the\nhard fact that in spite of the Abolitionist movement, only\n18 States (as on 30 May 1979) in the world have abolished\nthe death penalty for all offences, while 8 more have\nretained it for specific offences committed in time of war,\nonly. (See Amnesty International Report (1979) page 92).\nThis means, most of the countries in the modern world still\nretain death penalty as a legal sanction for certain\nspecified offences. The countries which retain death penalty\nin their penal laws, such as, Russia, U.S.A., France,\nBelgium, Malaysia, China and Japan, etc., cannot, by any\nstandard, be called uncivilized nations or immature\nsocieties.\n\nSurveyors and students of world events and current\ntrends believe that the reversal of the attitudes towards\ncriminals and their judicial punishments in general, and\ncapital punishment in particular in several countries of the\nworld, is partly due to the fact that milder sanctions or\ncorrective processes, or even the alternative of\nimprisonment, have been found inadequate and wanting to stem\nthe mounting tide of serious crime. Writing in Encyclopaedia\nBritannica, 1978 Book of the Year under the caption,\n'Changing Attitudes Towards Criminals', Richard Whittingham\nsums up the cause that has led to the adoption of this New\nHard Line, thus :\n\"Horror Story after horror story of dangerous\ncriminals sent back into society on bail or parole from\na penitentiary or (in many cases) release from a mental\ninstitution to commit further crimes have forced people\nto say that enough is enough. The consensus seemed to\nbe that there must be no repetition of such situations\nas the one described by Chicago Sun-Times Columnist\nRoger Simon in a September 4, 1977, article about a man\nwho had just been convicted of a particularly\ndespicable crime.\"\n\nFaced with the spectre of rising crime, people and\nsociologists alike, have started questioning the\nrehabilitation policy. \"In California another study from the\nRand Cooperation, suggests that keeping habitual criminals\nlocked up would do more to reduce crime than any\nrehabilitation efforts. Despite treatment or preventive\nmeasures, habitual criminals commonly go back to crime after\nthey are released from prison, the study showed. In\naddition, the study found that deterrence to crime was in\ndirect proportion to the relative certainty of going to\njail, after being caught.\"\n\nAccording to Encyclopaedia Britannica Year Book 1979,\nin 1978 also penologists were seriously divided in their\nviews about the end of punishment. Some penologists argued\nthat \"It is not possible to punish and reform\nsimultaneously\": while \"others would prefer to strip\npunishment of its moral overtones\", \"While many Legislators\nand most penologists have supported the idea that reform\nought to take priority in dealing with offenders, many\nJudges especially in Britain and the United States, where\nrising crime rates are the source of much public concern\nhave expressed grave doubts about the wisdom of this view.\nThey have argued that the courts must reflect a public\nabhorrence of crime and that justice demands that some\nattempt be made to impose punishment fitting to the crime\".\n\nIndia also, as the statistics furnished by the\nrespondent (Union of India) show, is afflicted by a rising\nrate of violent crime, particularly murder, armed robbery\nand dacoity etc., and this has been the cause of much public\nconcern. All attempts made by individual members to move\nBills in the Parliament for abolition or restriction of the\narea of death penalty have ended in failure. At least four\nof such unsuccessful attempts were made after India won\nIndependence, in 1949, 1958, 1961 and 1978. It may be noted\nthat the last of\nthese cttempts was only to restrict the death penalty to a\nfew types of murders specified in the Bill. Though it was\npassed by the Rajya Sabha after being recast, it has not\nbeen passed by Lok Sabha.\n\nTo sum up, the question whether or not death penalty\nserves any penological purpose is a difficult, complex and\nintractable issue. It has evoked strong, divergent views.\nFor the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the\nimpugned provision as to death penalty in Section 302, Penal\nCode on the ground of reasonableness in the light of\n\nArticles 19\nand\nof the Constitution, it is not necessary\nfor us to express any categorical opinion, one way or the\nother, as to which of these two antithetical views, held by\nthe Abolitionists and Retentionists, is correct. It is\nsufficient to say that the very fact that persons of reason,\nlearning and light are rationally and deeply divided in\ntheir opinion on this issue, is a ground among others, for\nrejecting the petitioners argument that retention of death\npenalty in the impugned provision, is totally devoid of\nreason and purpose. If, notwithstanding the view of the\nAbolitionists to the contrary, a very large segment of\npeople, the world over, including sociologists, legislators,\njurists, judges and administrators still firmly believe in\nthe worth and necessity of capital punishment for the\nprotection of society, if in the perspective of prevailing\ncrime conditions in India, contemporary public opinion\nchanalised through the people's representatives in\nParliament, has repeatedly in the last three decades,\nrejected all attempts, including the one made recently to\nabolish or specifically restrict the area of death penalty,\nif death penalty is still a recognised legal sanction for\nmurder or some types of murder in most of the civilised\ncountries in the world, if the framers of the Indian\nConstitution were fully aware as we shall presently show\nthey were of the existence of death penalty as punishment\nfor murder, under the\nIndian Penal Code\n, if the 35th Report\nand subsequent Reports of the Law Commission suggesting\nretention of death penalty, and recommending revision of the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code\nand the insertion of the new\nSections 235 (2) and 354 (3) in that Code providing for pre-\nsentence hearing and sentencing procedure on conviction for\nmurder and other capital offences were before the Parliament\nand presumably considered by it when in 1972-1973 it took up\nrevision of the Code of 1898 and replaced it by the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n, 1973, it is not possible to hold that\nthe provision of death penalty as an alternative punishment\nfor murder, in Section 302, Penal Code is unreasonable and\nnot in the\npublic interest. We would, therefore, conclude that the\nimpugned provision in Section 302, violates neither the\nletter nor the ethos of\nArticle 19.\n\nWe will now consider the issue whether the impugned\nlimb of the provision in Section 302, Penal Code contravenes\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.\n\nBefore dealing with the contention canvassed on the\npoint, it will be proper to notice briefly the principles\nwhich should inform the interpretation of\nArticle 21.\n\nIn\nManeka Gandhi\n's case, which was a decision by a\nBench of seven learned Judges, it was held by Bhagwati, J.\nin his concurring judgment, that the expression 'personal\nliberty' in\nArticle 21\nis of the widest amplitude and it\ncovers a variety of rights which go to constitute the\npersonal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to\nthe status of distinct fundamental rights under\nArticle 19.\n\nIt was further observed that\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nare not\nto be interpreted in water-tight compartments, and\nconsequently, a law depriving a person of personal liberty\nand prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the\nmeaning of\nArticle 21\nhas to stand the test of one or more\nof the fundamental rights conferred under\nArticle 19\nwhich\nmay be applicable in a given situation, ex-hypothesi it must\nalso be liable to be tested with reference to\nArticle 14.\n\nThe principle of reasonableness pervades all the three\nArticles, with the result, that the procedure contemplated\nby\nArticle 21\nmust be 'right and just and fair' and not\n'arbitrary' fancifu or 'oppressive', otherwise, it should be\nno procedure at all and the requirement of\nArticle 21\nwould\nnot be satisfied.\n\nArticle 21\nreads as under:\n\n\"No person shall be deprived of his life or\npersonal liberty except according to procedure\nestablished by law.\"\n\nIf this Article is expanded in accordance with the\ninterpretative principle indicated in Maneka Gandhi, it will\nread as follows:\n\n\"No person shall be deprived of his life or\npersonal liberty except according to fair, just and\nreasonable procedure established by valid law.\"\nIn the converse positive form, the expanded Article\nwill read as below:\n\n\"A peron may be deprived of his life or personal\nliberty in accordance with fair, just and reasonable\nprocedure established by valid law.\"\n\nThus expanded and read for interpretative purposes,\nArticle\nclearly brings out the implication, that the Founding\nFathers recognised the right of the State to deprive a\nperson of his life or personal liberty in accordance with\nfair, just and reasonable procedure established by valid\nlaw. There are several other indications, also, in the\nConstitution which show that the Constitution-makers were\nfully cognizant of the existence of death penalty for murder\nand certain other offences in the\nIndian Penal Code\n. Entries\n1 and 2 in List III-Concurrent List-of the Seventh Schedule,\nspecifically refer to the\nIndian Penal Code\nand the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\nas in force at the commencement of the\nConstitution.\nArticle 72 (1) (c)\nspecifically invests the\nPresident with power to suspend, remit or commute the\nsentence of any person convicted of any offence, and also\n\"in all cases where the sentence is a sentence of death\".\nLikewise, under\nArticle 161\n, the Governor of a State has\nbeen given power to suspend, remit or commute, inter alia\nthe sentence of death of any person convicted of murder or\nother capital offence relating to a matter to which the\nexecutive power of the State extends.\nArticle 134\n, in terms,\ngives a right of appeal to the Supreme Court to a person\nwho, on appeal, is sentenced to death by the High Court,\nafter reversal of his acquittal by the trial Court. Under\nthe successive\nCriminal Procedure Code\ns which have been in\nforce for about 100 years, a sentence of death is to be\ncarried out by hanging. In view of the aforesaid\nconstitutional postulates, by no stretch of imagination can\nit be said that death penalty under Section 302, Penal Code,\neither per se or because of its execution by hanging,\nconstitutes an unreasonable, cruel or unusual punishment. By\nreason of the same constitutional postulates, it cannot be\nsaid that the framers of the Constitution considered death\nsentence for murder or the prescribed traditional mode of\nits execution as a degrading punishment which would defile\n\"the dignity of the individual\" within the contemplation of\nthe Preamble to the Constitution. On parity of reasoning, it\ncannot be said that death penalty for the offence of murder\nviolates the basic structure of the Constitution.\nBefore we pass on to the main Question No. II, we may\ndispose of another contention convassed by Dr. L.M. Singhvi.\n\nIt is pointed out that India, as a member of the\nInternational Community, was a participating delegate at the\ninternational conference that made the Stockholm Declaration\non December 11, 1977, that India has also accepted the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted\nby the Central Assembly of the United Nations, which came\ninto force on March 23, 1966, and to which some 47\ncountries, including India, are a party. This being the\nposition, it is stressed, India stands committed to the\nabolition of the death penalty. It is contended that the\nconstitutional validity and interpretation of the impugned\nlimb of Section 302, Penal Code, and the sentencing\nprocedure for capital cases provided in\nSection 354 (3)\nof\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, must be considered in\nthe light of the aforesaid Stockholm Declaration and the\nInternational Covenant, which represent the evolving\nattitudes and standards of decency in a maturing world.\n\nLet us examine this contention. The European Convention\nof Human Rights came into force on September 1, 1953, and 18\ncountries had signed this Convention on November 4, 1950.\nIndia acceded to this Resolution of the Convention on March\n27, 1979. The International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights, inter alia, provides:\n\n\"\nArticle 6 (1)\nEvery human being has the inherent\nright to life. This right shall be protected by law. No\none shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.\n(2) In countries which have not abolished the\ndeath penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only\nfor the most serious crimes in accordance with the law\nin force at the time of the commission of the crime...\n\nIt will be seen that clauses (1) and (2) of\nArticle 6\ndo not\nabolish or prohibit the imposition of death penalty in all\ncircumstances. All that they require is that, firstly, death\npenalty shall not be arbitrarily inflicted; secondly, it\nshall be imposed only for most serious crimes in accordance\nwith a law, which shall not be an ex post facto legislation.\nThus, the requirements of these clauses are substantially\nthe same as the guarantees or prohibitions contained in\n\nArticles 20\nand\nof our Constitution. India's commitment\ntherefore does not go beyond what is provided in the\nConstitution and the\nIndian Penal Code\nand the\nCriminal\nProcedure Code\n. The Penal Code prescribes death penalty as\nan alternative punishment only for heinous crimes which are\nnot more than seven in number.\nSection 354 (3)\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1973, as we shall presently\ndiscuss, in keeping with the spirit of the International\nCovenant, has further restricted the area of death penalty.\nIndia's penal laws, including the impugned provisions and\ntheir application, are thus entirely in accord with its\ninternational commitment.\n\nIt will be pertinent to note that most of the countries\nincluding those who have subscribed to this International\ncovenant, retain death penalty for murder and certain other\ncrimes even to the present day in their penal laws. Neither\nthe new interpretative dimensions given to\nArticles 19\nand\nby this Court in\nManeka Gandhi and Charles Sobraj v. The\nSuperintendent Central Jail, Tihar, New Delhi\n(1) nor the\nacceptance by India of the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights, makes any change in the prevailing\nstandards of decency and human dignity by which counsel\nrequire us to judge the constitutional validity of the\nimpugned provisions. The International Covenant, as already\nnoticed, does not outlaw capital punishment for murder,\naltogether.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, we would answer the\nfirst main question in the negative. This takes us to\nQuestion No. II.\n\nQuestion No.II.\n\nAre the provisions of\nSection 354 (3)\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 unconstitutional ? That is the\nquestion. The constitutional validity of section 354 (3) is\nassailed on these grounds:\n\n(i) (a)\nSection 354 (3)\nof the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973, delegates to the Court the\nduty to legislate the field of 'special\nreasons' for choosing between life and death,\nand\n____________________\n(1) [1979] 1 S.C.R. 512.\n(b) permits imposition of death penalty in an\narbitrary and whimsical manner in as much as\nit does not lay down any rational principies\nor criteria for invoking this extreme\nsanction. (Reliance has been placed on Furman\nv. Georgia (ibid).\n\n(ii) If Section 354 (3) is to be saved from the vice of\nunconstitutionality, the Court should so interpret\nit and define its scope that the imposition of\ndeath penalty comes to be restricted only to those\ntypes of grave murders and capital offences which\nimperil the very existence and security of the\nState. (Reliance for this argument has been placed\non\nRajendra Prasad\n's case (ibid) ).\n\nAs against this, the learned Solicitor-General submits\nthat the policy of the law in the matter of imposition of\ndeath sentence is writ large and clear in Section 354 (3),\nnamely, that life imprisonment is the rule and death\nsentence an exception; that the correct approach should be\nto apply this policy to the relevant facts of the particular\ncase, bearing on the question of sentence, and to find out\nif there are any exceptional reasons justifying imposition\nof the death penalty, as a departure from the normal rule.\n\nIt is submitted that conferment of such sentencing\ndiscretion on the courts, to be exercised judicially, in no\nsense, amounts to delegation of the legislative powers by\nParliament.\n\nShri Sorabji further submits that there is no inherent\nimpossibility in formulating broad guidelines consistent\nwith the policy indicated by the legislature, for the\nexercise of the judicial functions under Section 354 (3). He\nemphasises that only broad guidelines, as distinct from\nrigid rules, can be\nlaid down by\nthe Court. Since the\ndiscretion-proceeds the argument-is to be exercised\njudicially after taking into consideration all the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to the\ncrime and the criminal in a particular case, and ample\nsafeguards by way of appeal and reference to the superior\ncourts against erroneous or arbitrary exercise of the\nsentencing discretion have been provided, Section 354 (3)\ncannot be said to be violative of\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nor\nanything else in the Constitution,\nBefore embarking upon a discussion of the arguments\nadvanced on both sides, it is necessary to have a peep into\nthe history and the legislative background of the procedural\nprovisions relating to sentencing in the Code of criminal\nProcedure.\n\nUnder the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1898, as it stood\nbefore its amendment by Act No. 26 of 1955, even for the\nseven offences mentioned earlier, which are punishable in\nthe alternative with death, the normal sentence was the\ndeath sentence, and if the Court wanted to depart from this\nrule, it had to give reasons for doing so. This requirement\nwas embodied in subsection (5) of Section 367, which, as it\nthen stood, was as follows: \"If the accused is convicted of\nan offence punishable with death and the Court sentences him\nto any punishment other than death, the Court shall in its\njudgment state the reason why sentence of death was not\npassed.\n\nThe Law Commission in its 35th Report (Vol. I), made\nthe following comments on this provision:\n\n\"...a considerable body of opinion is in favour of\na provision requiring the court to state its\nreasons for imposing the punishment either of\ndeath or of imprisonment for life. Further, this\nwould be good safeguard to ensure that the lower\ncourts examine the case as elaborately from the\npoint of view of sentence as from the point of\nview of guilt...It would increase the confidence\nof the people, in the courts, by showing that the\ndiscretion is judicially exercised. It would also\nfacilitate the task of the High Court in appeal or\nin proceedings for confirmation in respect of the\nsentence (where the sentence awarded is that of\ndeath) or in proceedings in revision for\nenhancement of the sentence (where the sentence\nawarded is one of imprisonment of life.\"\n\nIn deferance to this recommendation, section 66 of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1955 (XXVI of 1955)\ndeleted old sub-section (5) of Section 367 with effect from\nJanuary 1, 1956, and thereafter, for such capital offences,\nit was left to the Court, on the facts of each case, to\npass, in its discretion, for reason to be\nrecorded, the sentence of death or the lesser sentence. This\nled to some difference of opinion whether, even after the\nAmendment of 1955, in case of murder the normal punishment\nwas death or imprisonment for life (See A.I.R. Commentaries\non the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, Vol. 3, page 565, by D.V.\nChitaley and S. Appu Rao). Overruling its earlier decision,\nthe Bombay High Court in the\nState v. Vali Mohammad\n,(1) held\nthat death is not a normal penalty for murder. As against\nthis, the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in\nVeluchami Thevar,(2) held that death was the normal\npunishment where there were no extenuating circumstances.\nThe third set of cases held that both the sentences were\nnormal but the discretion as regards sentence was to be\nexercised in the light of facts and circumstances of the\ncase.\n\nThis view appears to be in accord with the decision of\nthis Court in\nIman Ali & Anr. v. State of Assam\n.(3) In that\ncase, there was a clear finding by the Court of Session\nwhich had been upheld by the High Court, that each of the\ntwo appellants therein, committed a cold-blooded murder by\nshooting two inmates of the house simply with the object of\nfacilitating commission of dacoity by them. Those persons\nwere shot and killed even though they had not tried to put\nup any resistence. It was held by this Court (speaking\nthrough Bhargava, J.) that in these circumstances where the\nmurders were committed in cold-blood with the sole object of\ncommitting dacoity, the Sessions Judge had not exercised his\ndiscretion judicially in not imposing the death sentence,\nand the High Court was justified in enhancing the sentence\nof the appellants from life imprisonment to death.\n\nJagmohan Singh\n's case, which we shall notice presently\nin further detail, proceeds on the hypothesis that even\nafter the deletion of sub-section (5) of Section 367 in the\nCode of 1898, both the alternative sentences provided in\nSection 302, Penal Code are normal punishment for murder,\nand the choice of either sentence rests in the discretion of\nthe Court which is to be exercised judicially, after taking\ninto account all the relevant circumstances of the case.\n__________________\n(1) AIR 1959 Bom. 294 (299).\n\n(2) A.I.R. 1965 Mad. 48 at p. 49.\n\n(3) [1968] 3 S.C.R. 610.\nSection 354 (3)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973, marks a significant shift in the legislative policy\nunderlying the Code of 1898, as in force immediately before\nApr. 1, 1974, according to which both the alternative\nsentences of death or imprisonment for life provided for\nmurder and for certain other capital offences under the\nPenal Code, were normal sentences. Now, according to this\nchanged legislative policy which is patent on the face of\nSection 354 (3), the normal punishment for murder and six\nother capital offences under the Penal Code, is imprisonment\nfor life (or imprisonment for a term of years) and death\npenalty is an exception. The Joint Committee of Parliament\nin its Report, stated the object and reason of making this\nchange, as follows:\n\n\"A sentence of death is the extreme penalty of law\nand it is but fair that when a Court awards that\nsentence in a case where the alternative sentence of\nimprisonment for life is also available, it should give\nspecial reasons in support of the sentence\"\n\nAccordingly, sub-section (3) of Section 354 of the current\nCode provides:\n\n\"When the conviction is for an offence punishable\nwith death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment\nfor life or imprisonment for a term of years, the\njudgment shall state the reasons for the sentence\nawarded, and, in the case of sentence of death, the\nspecial reasons for such sentence.\"\n\nIn the context, we may also notice Section 235 (2) of\nthe Code of 1973, because it makes not only explicit, what\naccording to the decision in\nJagmohan\n's case was implicit in\nthe scheme of the Code, but also bifurcates the trial by\nproviding for two hearings, one at the pre-conviction stage\nand another at the pre-sentence stage. It requires that:\n\n\"If the accused is convicted, the Judge shall,\nunless he proceeds in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 360, hear the accused on the question of\nsentence, and then pass sentence on him according to\nlaw.\"\nThe Law Commission on its 48th Report had pointed out\nthis deficiency in the sentencing procedure:\n\n\"45. It is now being increasingly recognised that\na rational and consistent sentencing policy requires\nthe removal or several deficiencies in the present\nsystem. One such deficiency is the lack of\ncomprehensive information as to characteristics and\nbackground of the offender.\n\nThe aims of sentencing:-Themselves obscure-become\nall the more so in the absence of information on which\nthe correctional process is to operate. The public as\nwell so the courts themselves are in the dark about\njudicial approach in this regard.\n\nWe are of the view that the taking of evidence as\nto the circustances relevant to sentencing should be\nencouraged and both the prosecution and the accused\nshould be allowed to cooperate in the process.\"\n\nBy enacting Section 235 (2) of the New Code, Parliament\nhas accepted that recommendation of the Law Commission.\nAlthough sub-section (2) of Section 235 does not contain a\nspecific provision as to evidence and provides only for\nhearing of the accused as to sentence, yet it is implicit in\nthis provision that if a request is made in that behalf by\neither the prosecution or the accused, or by both, the Judge\nshould give the party or parties concerned an opportunity of\nproducing evidence or material relating to the various\nfactors bearing on the question of sentence. \"Of course\", as\nwas pointed out by this Court in\nSanta Singh v. State of\nPunjab\n,(1) \"care would have to be taken by the Court to see\nthat this hearing on the question of sentence is not turned\ninto an instrument for unduly protracting the proceedings.\nThe claim of due and proper hearing would have to be\nharmonised with the requirement of expeditious disposal of\nproceedings.\"\n\nWe may also notice Sections 432, 433 and 433A, as they\nthrow light as to whether life imprisonment as currently\nadministered in\n______________\n(1) A.I.R. 1976 SC. 2286.\nIndia, can be considered an adequate alternative to the\ncapital sentence even in extremely heinous cases of murder.\n\nSections 432 and 433 of the Code of 1973 continue\nSections 401 and 402 of the Code of 1898, with necessary\nmodifications which bring them in tune with\nArticles 72\nand\nof the Constitution. Section 432 invests the\n\"appropriate Government\" (as defined in sub-section (7) of\nthat Section) with power to suspend or remit sentences.\nSection 433 confers on the appropriate Government power to\ncommute sentence, without the consent of the person\nsentenced. Under clause (a) of the Section, the appropriate\nGovernment may commute a sentence of death, for any other\npunishment provided by the\nIndian Penal Code\n.\n\nWith effect from December 18, 1978, the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1978\n, inserted new\nSection 433A, which runs as under :\n\n\"433A. Restriction on powers of remission or\ncommutation in certain cases-Notwithstanding anything\ncontained in Section 432, where a sentence of\nimprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a\nperson for an offence for which death is one of the\npunishments provided by law or where a sentence of\ndeath imposed on a person has been commuted under\nSection 433 into one of imprisonment for life, such\nperson shall not be released from prison unless he had\nserved at least fourteen years of imprisonment.\"\n\nIt may be recalled that in Jagmohan this Court had\nobserved that, in practice, life imprisonment amounts to 12\nyears in prison. Now, Section 433A restricts the power of\nremission and commutation conferred on the appropriate\nGovernment under Sections 432 and 433, so that a person who\nis sentenced to imprisonment for life or whose death\nsentence is commuted to imprisonment for life must serve\nactual imprisonment for a minimum of 14 years.\n\nWe may next notice other provisions of the extent Code\n(corresponding to Sections 374, 375, 376 and 377 of the\nrepealed Code) bearing on capital punishment. Section 366\n\n(i) of the Code requires the Court passing a sentence of\ndeath to submit the proceedings to the High Court, and\nfurther mandates that such a sentence shall not be executed\nunless it is confirmed by the High Court. On such a\nreference for confirmation of death sentence, the High Court\nis required to proceed in accordance with Sections 367 and\n\n368. Section 367 gives power to the High Court to direct\nfurther inquiry to be made or additional evidence to be\ntaken. Section 368 empowers the High Court to confirm the\nsentence of death or pass any other sentence warranted by\nlaw or to annul or alter the conviction or order a new trial\nor acquit the accused. Section 369 enjoins that in every\ncase so submitted, the confirmation of the sentence, or any\nnew sentence or order passed by the High Court, shall, when\nsuch court consists of two or more Judges, be made, passed\nand signed by at least two of them. Section 370 provides\nthat where any such case is heard before a Bench of Judges\nand such Judges are equally divided in opinion, the case\nshall be referred to a third Judge.\n\nIn this fasciculus of Sections relating to confirmation\nproceedings in the High Court, the Legislature has provided\nvaluable safeguards of the life and liberty of the subject\nin cases of capital sentences. These provisions seek to\nensure that where in a capital case, the life of the\nconvicted person is at stake, the entire evidential material\nbearing on the innocence or guilt of the accused and the\nquestion of sentence must be scrutinised with utmost caution\nand care by a superior Court.\n\nThe High Court has been given very wide powers under\nthese provisions to prevent any possible miscarriage of\njustice.\nIn\nState of Maharashtra v. Sindhi\n, (1) this Court\nreiterated, with emphasis, that while dealing with a\nreference for confirmation of a sentence of death, the High\nCourt must consider the proceedings in all their aspects\nreappraise, reassess and reconsider the entire facts and law\nand, if necessary, after taking additional evidence, come to\nits own conclusions on the material on record in regard to\nthe conviction of the accused (and the sentence)\nindependently of the view expressed by the Sessions Judge.\n\nSimilarly, where on appeal, the High Court reverses an\nacquittal, and convicts the accused person and sentences him\nto death, Section 379 of the Code of 1973, gives him a right\nof appeal to the Supreme Court. Finally, there is\nArticle\nof the Constitution under which the Supreme Court is\nempowered, in its discretion, to\n__________\n(1) A.I.R. 1975 S.C. 1665.\nentertain an appeal on behalf of a person whose sentence of\ndeath awarded by the Sessions Judge is confirmed by the High\nCourt.\n\nIn the light of the above conspectus, we will now\nconsider the effect of the aforesaid legislative changes on\nthe authority and efficacy of the propositions\nlaid down by\n\nthis Court in\nJagmohan\n's case. These propositions may be\nsummed up as under :\n\n(i) The general legislative policy that underlines the\nstructure of our criminal law, principally\ncontained in the\nIndian Penal Code\nand the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code\n, is to define an offence\nwith sufficient clarity and to prescribe only the\nmaximum punishment therefor, and to allow a very\nwide discretion to the Judge in the matter of\nfixing the degree of punishment.\n\nWith the solitary exception of Section 303,\nthe same policy permeates Section 302 and some\nother sections of the Penal Code, where the\nmaximum punishment is the death penalty.\n\n(ii) (a) No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances which should be\nconsidered when sentencing an offender, is\npossible. \"The infinite variety of cases and\nfacts to each case would make general\nstandards either meaningless 'boiler plate'\nor a statement of the obvious that no Jury\n(Judge) would need.\" (Referred to McGauthe v.\nCalifornia(1)\n\n(b) The impossibility of laying down standards is\nat the very core of the criminal law as\nadministered in India which invests the\njudges with a very wide discretion in the\nmatter of fixing the degree of punishment.\n\n(iii) The view taken by the plurality in Furman v.\nGeorgia decided by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates, to the effect, that a law which gives\nuncontrolled and un-\n_____________________\n(1) [1971] 402 US 183.\nguided discretion to the Jury (or the Judge) to\nchoose arbitrarily between a sentence of death and\nimprisonment for a capital offence, violates the\nEighth Amendment, is not applicable in India. We\ndo not have in our Constitution any provision like\nthe Eighth Amendment, nor are we at liberty to\napply the test of reasonableness with the freedom\nwith which the Judges of the Supreme Court of\nAmerica are accustomed to apply \"the due process\"\n\nclause. There are grave doubts about the\nexpediency of transplanting western experience in\nour country. Social conditions are different and\nso also the general intellectual level. Arguments\nwhich would be valid in respect of one area of the\nworld may not hold good in respect of another\narea.\n\n(iv) (a) This discretion in the matter of sentence is\nto be exercised by the Judge judicially,\nafter balancing all the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances of the crime.\n\n(b) The discretion is liable to be corrected by\nsuperior courts. The exercise of judicial\ndiscretion on well-recognised principles is,\nin the final analysis, the safest possible\nsafeguard for the accused.\n\nIn view of the above, it will be\nimpossible to say that there would be at all\nany discrimination, since crime as crime may\nappear to be superficially the same but the\nfacts and circumstances of a crime are widely\ndifferent. Thus considered the provision in\nSection 302, Penal Code is not violative of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution on the ground\nthat it confers on the judges an unguided and\nuncontrolled discretion in the matter of\nawarding capital punishment of imprisonment\nfor life.\n\n(v) (a) Relevant facts and circumstances impinging on\nthe nature and circumstances of the crime can\nbe brought before the Court at the\npreconviction\nstage, notwithstanding the fact that no\nformal procedure for producing evidence\nregarding such facts and circumstances had\nbeen specifically provided. Where counsel\naddresses the Court with regard to the\ncharacter and standing of the accused, they\nare duly considered by the Court unless there\nis something in the evidence itself which\nbelies him or the Public Prosecutor\nchallenges the facts.\n\n(b) It is to be emphasised that in exercising its\ndiscretion to choose either of the two\nalternative sentences provided in Section\n302, Penal Code, \"the Court is principally\nconcerned with the facts and circumstances\nwhether aggravating or mitigating, which are\nconnected with the particular crime under\ninquiry. All such facts and circumstances are\ncapable of being proved in accordance with\nthe provisions of the\nIndian Evidence Act\nin\na trial regulated by the Cr. P.C. The trial\ndoes not come to an end until all the\nrelevant facts are proved and the counsel on\nboth sides have an opportunity to address the\nCourt. The only thing that remains is for the\nJudge to decide on the guilt and punishment\nand that is what Sections 306(2) and 309(2)\nCr. P.C. purport to provide for. These\nprovisions are part of the procedure\nestablished by law and unless it is shown\nthat they are invalid for any other reasons\nthey must be regarded as valid. No reasons\nare offered to show that they are\nconstitutionally invalid and hence the death\nsentence imposed after trial in accordance\nwith the procedure established by law is not\nunconstitutional under\nArticle 21.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\nA study of the propositions set out above, will show\nthat in substance, the authority of none of them has been\naffected by the legislative changes since the decision in\n\nJagmohan\n's case. Of course, two of them require to be\nadjusted and attuned to the shift in the\nlegislative policy.\nThe first of those propositions is No.\n\n(iv) (a) which postulates, that according to the then extant\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nboth the alternative sentences\nprovided in Section 302, Penal Code are normal sentences,\nand the Court can, therefore, after weighing the aggravating\nand mitigating circumstances of the particular case, in its\ndiscretion, impose either of those sentences. This postulate\nhas now been modified by Section 354(3) which mandates the\nCourt convicting a person for an offence punishable with\ndeath or, in the alternative with imprisonment for life or\nimprisonment for a term of years, not to impose the sentence\nof death on that person unless there are \"special reasons\"-\nto be recorded-for such sentence. The expression \"special\nreasons\" in the context of this provision, obviously means\n\"exceptional reasons\" founded on the exceptionally grave\ncircumstances of the particular case relating to the crime\nas well as the criminal. Thus, the legislative policy now\nwrit large and clear on the face of Section 354(3) is that\non conviction for murder and other capital offences\npunishable in the alternative with death under the Penal\nCode, the extreme penalty should be imposed only in extreme\ncases.\n\nIn this view we are in accord with the dictum of this\nCourt in\nBalwant Singh v. State of Punjab\n(1), wherein the\ninterpretation of Section 354(3) first came up for\nconsideration. After surveying the legislative background,\none of us (Untwalia, J,) speaking for the Court, summed up\nthe scope and implications of Section 354 (3), thus :\n\n\"Under this provision the Court is required to\nstate the reasons for the sentence awarded and in the\ncase of sentence of death, special reasons are required\nto be stated. It would thus be noticed that awarding of\nthe sentence other than the sentence of death is the\ngeneral rule now and only special reasons that is to\nsay, special facts and circumstances in a given case,\nwill warrant the passing of the death sentence. It is\nunnecessary nor is it possible to make a catalogue of\nthe special reasons which may justify the passing of\nthe death sentence in a case.\"\n\nWhile applying proposition (iv) (a), therefore, the Court\nhas to bear\n_____________________\n(1) A.I.R.1976 SC 231=[1976] 2 SCR 684.\nin mind this fundamental principle of policy embodied in\nSection 354(3).\n\nAnother proposition, the application of which, to an\nextent, is affected by the legislative changes, is No. (v).\nIn portion (a) of that proposition, it is said that\ncircumstances impinging on the nature and circumstances of\nthe crime can be brought on record before the pre-conviction\nstage. In portion (b), it is emphasised that while making\nchoice of the sentence under Section 302, Penal Code, the\nCourt is principally concerned with the circumstances\nconnected with the particular crime under inquiry. Now,\nSection 235(2) provides for a bifurcated trial and\nspecifically gives the accused person a right of pre-\nsentence hearing, at which stage, he can bring on record\nmaterial or evidence, which may not be strictly relevant to\nor connected with the particular crime under inquiry, but\nnevertheless, have, consistently with the policy underlined\nin Section 354(3), a bearing on the choice of sentence. The\npresent legislative policy discernible from Section 235(2)\nread with Section 354(3) is that in fixing the degree of\npunishment or making the choice of sentence for various\noffences, including one under Section 302, Penal Code, the\nCourt should not confine its consideration principally\" or\nmerely to the circumstances connected with the particular\ncrime, but also give due consideration to the circumstances\nof the criminal.\n\nAttuned to the legislative policy delineated in\nSections 354(3) and 235(2), propositions (iv) (a) and (v)\n\n(b) in Jagmohan, shall have to be recast and may be stated\nas below :\n\n(a) The normal rule is that the offence of muder shall\nbe punished with the sentence of life\nimprisonment. The court can depart from that rule\nand impose the sentence of death only if there are\nspecial reasons for doing so. Such reasons must be\nrecorded in writing before imposing the death\nsentence.\n\n(b) While considering the question of sentence to be\nimposed for the offence of murder under Section\n302 Penal Code, the court must have regard to\nevery relevant circumstance relating to the crime\nas well as the criminal. If the court finds, but\nnot otherwise, that the\noffence is of an exceptionally depraved and\nheinous character and constitutes, on account of\nits design and the manner of its execution, a\nsource of grave danger to the society at large,\nthe court may impose the death sentence.\n\nThe soundness or application of the other propositions\nin Jagmohan, and the premises on which they rest, are not\naffected in any way by the legislative changes since\neffected. On the contrary these changes reinforce the\nreasons given in Jagmohan, for holding that the impugned\nprovisions of the Penal Code and the\nCriminal Procedure Code\n\ndo not offend\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. Now,\nParliament has in Section 354(3) given a broad and clear\nguideline which is to serve the purpose of lodestar to the\ncourt in the exercise of its sentencing discretion.\nParliament has advisedly not restricted this sentencing\ndiscretion further, as, in its legislative judgment, it is\nneither possible nor desirable to do so. Parliament could\nnot but be aware that since the\nAmending Act\n26 of 1955,\ndeath penalty has been imposed by courts on an extremely\nsmall percentage of persons convicted of murder-a fact which\ndemonstrates that courts have generally exercised their\ndiscretion in inflicting this extreme penalty with great\ncircumspection, caution and restraint. Cognizant of the past\nexperience of the administration of death penalty in India,\nParliament, in its wisdom, thought it best and safe to leave\nthe imposition of this gravest punishment in gravest cases\nof murder, to the judicial discretion of the courts which\nare manned by persons of reason, experience and standing in\nthe profession. The exercise of this sentencing discretion\ncannot be said to be untrammelled and unguided. It is\nexercised judicially in accordance with well-recognised\nprinciples crystalised by judicial decisions, directed along\nthe broad contours of legislative policy towards the\nsignposts enacted in Section 354(3).\n\nThe new Section 235 (2) adds to the number of several\nother safeguards which were embodied in the\nCriminal\nProcedure Code\nof 1898 and have been re-enacted in the Code\nof 1973. Then, the errors in the exercise of this guided\njudicial discretion are liable to be corrected by the\nsuperior courts. The procedure provided in\nCriminal\nProcedure Code\nfor imposing capital punishment for murder\nand some other capital crimes under the Penal Code cannot,\nby any reckoning, be said to be unfair unreasonable and\nunjust,\nNor can it be said that this sentencing discretion, with\nwhich the courts are invested, amounts to delegation of its\npower of legislation by Parliament. The argument to that\neffect is entirely misconceived. We would, therefore, re-\naffirm the view taken by this Court in Jagmohan, and hold\nthat the impgned provisions do not violate\nArticles 14\n, 19\n\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\nNow, remains the question whether this Court can lay\ndown standards or norms restricting the area of the\nimposition of death penalty to a narrow category of murders.\n\nDr. Chitale contends that the wide observations in\nJagmohan as to the impossibility of laying down standards or\nnorms in the matter of segtencing are too sweeping. It is\nsubmitted that soon after the decision in Furman, several\nStates in U.S.A. amended their penal statutes and brought\nthem in conformity with the requirements of Furman. Support\nhas also been sought for this argument from Gregg v.\nGeorgia, wherein the Supreme Court of the United States held\nthat the concern expressed in Furman decision that death\npenalty may not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious\nmanner could be met by a carefully drafted statute ensuring\nthat the sentencing authority was given adequate guidance\nand information for determining the appropriate sentence, a\nbifurcated sentencing proceeding being preferable as a\ngeneral proposition.\n\nIf by \"laying down standards\", it is meant that\n'murder' should be categorised before hand according to the\ndegrees of its culpability and all the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances should be exhaustively and rigidly\nenumerated so as to exclude all free-play of discretion, the\nargument merits rejection.\n\nAs pointed out in Jagmohan, such \"standardisation\" is\nwell-nigh impossible.\n\nFirstly, there is little agreement among penologists\nand jurists as to what information about the crime and\ncriminal is relevant and what is not relevant for fixing the\ndose of punishment for a person convicted of a particular\noffence. According to Cessare Beccaria, who is supposed to\nbe the intellectual progenitor of today's fixed sentencing\nmovement 'crimes are only to be measured by the injnry done\nto society'. But the 20th Century sociologists do not wholly\nagree\nwith this view. In the opinion of Von Hirsch, the\n\"seriousness of a crime depends both on the harm done (or\nrisked) by the act and degree of the actor's culpability\".\nBut how is the degree of that culpability to be measured.\nCan any thermometer be devised to measure its degree ? This\nis a very baffling, difficult and intricate problem.\n\nSecondly, criminal cases do not fall into set-\nbehavioristic patterns. Even within a single-category\noffence there are infinite, unpredictable and unforceable\nvariations. No two cases are exactly identical. There are\ncountless permutations and combinations which are beyond the\nanticipatory capacity of the human calculus. Each case\npresents its own distinctive features, its peculiar\ncombinations of events and its unique configuration of\nfacts. \"Simply in terms of blame-worthiness or dessert\ncriminal cases are diferent from one another in ways that\nlegislatures cannot anticipate, and limitations of language\nprevent the precise description of differences that can be\nanticipated.\"(1) This is particularly true of murder. \"There\nis probably no offence\", observed Sir Ernest Growers,\nChairman of the Royal Commission, \"that varies so widely\nboth in character and in moral guilt as that which falls\nwithin the legal definition of murder.\" The futility of\nattempting to lay down exhaustive standards was demonstrated\nby this Court in Jagmohan by citing the instance of the\nModel Penal Code which was presented to the American Supreme\nCourt in McGoutha.\n\nThirdly, a standardisation of the sentencing process\nwhich leaves little room for judicial discretion to take\naccount of variations in culpability within single-offence\ncategory ceases to be judicial. It tends to sacrifice\njustice at the alter of blind uniformity. Indeed, there is a\nreal danger of such mechanical standardisation degenerating\ninto a bed of procrustean cruelty.\n\nFourthly, standardisation or sentencing discretion is a\npolicy matter which belongs to the sphere of legislation.\nWhen Parliament as a matter of sound legislative policy, did\nnot deliberately restrict, control or standardise the\nsentencing discretion any further than that incompassed by\nthe broad contours delineated in Section 354 (3),\n_____________\n(1) Messinger and Bittner's Crimonology Year Book\n(Ibid) Albert W, Alcherler's article at page 421.\nthe Court would not by over-leaping its bounds rush to do\nwhat Parliament, in its wisdom, varily did not do.\n\nWe must leave upto the Legislature, the things that are\nLegislature's. \"The highest judicial duty is to recognise\nthe limits on judicial power and to permit the democratic\nprocesses to deal with matters falling outside of those\nlimits\". As Judges, we have to resist the temptation to\nsubstitute our own value choices for the will of the people.\nSince substituted judicial 'made-to-order' standards,\nhowsoever painstakingly made, do not bear the peoples\nimprimatur, they may not have the same authenticity and\nefficacy as the silent zones and green belts designedly\nmarked out and left open by Parliament in its legislative\nplanning for fair-play of judicial discretion to take care\nof the variable, unpredictable circumstances of the\nindividual cases, relevant to individualised sentencing.\nWhen judges, acting individually or collectively, in their\nbenign anxiety to do what they think is morally good for the\npeople, take upon themselves, the responsibility of setting\ndown social norms of conduct. There is every danger, despite\ntheir effort to make a rational guess of the notions of\nright and wrong prevailing in the community at large and\ndespite their intention to abide by the dictates of mere\nreason, that they might write their own peculiar view or\npersonal pre-dilection into the law, sincerely mistaking\nthat changeling for what they perceive to be the community\nethic. The perception of 'community' standards or ethics may\nvary from Judge to Judge. In this sensitive, highly\ncontroversial area of death penalty, with all its\ncomplexity, vast implications and manifold ramifications,\neven all the Judges sitting cloistered in this Court and\nacting unanimously, cannot assume the role which properly\nbelongs to the chosen representatives of the people in\nParliament, particularly when Judges have no divining rod to\ndivine accurately the will of the people. In Furman, the\nHon'ble Judges claimed to articulate the contemporary\nstandards of morality among the American people. But\nspeaking through public referenda, Gallup polls and the\nstate legislatures, the American people sharply rebuffed\nthem. We must draw a lesson from the same.\n\nWhat the learned Chief Justice, who is amongst us in\nthis case has said recently in\nGurbaksh Singh Sibbia and\nothers v. State of Punjab\n(1) in the context of laying down\nstandards in the discre-\n\n________________________\n(1) Criminal Appeals Nos. 335 etc. of 1977 and 81 and\n82 of 1978.\ntionary area of anticipatory bail, comes in as a timely\nreminder. In principle, these observations aptly apply to\nthe desirability and feasibility of laying down standards in\nthe area of sentencing discretion, also. Let us therefore,\nhark to the same:\n\n\"Generalisations on matters which rest on discretion\nand the attempt to discover formulae of universal\napplication when facts are bound to differ from case to case\nfrustrate the very purpose of conferring discretion. No two\ncases are alike on facts and, therefore, Courts have to be\nallowed a little free play in the joints if the conferment\nof discretionary power is to be meaningful. There is no risk\ninvolved in entrusting a wide discretion to the Court of\nSession and the High Court in granting anticipatory bail\nbecause, firstly, these are higher courts manned by\nexperienced persons, secondly, their orders are not final\nbut are open to appellate or revisional scrutiny and above\nall because, discretion has always to be exercised by courts\njudicially and not according to whim, caprice or fancy. On\nthe other hand, there is a risk in foreclosing categories of\ncases in which anticipatory bail may be allowed because life\nthrows up unforeseen possibilities and offers new\nchallenges. Judicial discretion has to be free enough to be\nable to take these possibilities in its stride and to meet\nthese challenges. While dealing with the necessity for\npreserving judicial discretion unhampered by rules of\ngeneral application, Earl Loreburn L.C. said in Hyman and\nAnr. v. Rose(1).\n\n\"I desire in the first instance to point out that\nthe discretion given by the section is very wide. Now\nit seems to me that when the Act is so express to\nprovide a wide discretion...it is not advisable to lay\ndown any rigid rules for guiding that discretion. I do\nnot doubt that the rules enunciated by the Master of\nthe Rolls in the present case are useful maxims in\ngeneral, and that in general they reflect the point-of\nview from which judges would regard an application for\nrelief. But I think it ought to be distinctly\nunderstood that there may be cases in which any or all\nof them may be disregarded. If it were otherwise, the\nfree discretion given by the statute would be fettered\nby limitations which have nowhere been enacted. It is\none thing to decide what is the true meaning of the\nlanguage contained\n___________________________\n(1) [1912] A.C. 623,\nin an Act of Parliament. It is quite a different thing\nto place conditions upon a free discretion entrusted by\nstatute to the Court where the conditions are not based\nupon statutory enactment at all. It is not safe. I\nthink, to say that the Court must and will always\ninsist upon certain things when the Act does not\nrequire them, and the facts of some unforeseen case may\nmake the Court wish it had kept a free hand.\"\n\n\"Judges have to decide cases as they come before them,\nmindful of the need to keep passions and prejudices out of\ntheir decisions. And it will be strange if, by employing\njudicial artifices and techniques, we cut down the\ndiscretion so wisely conferred upon the Courts, by devising\na formula which will confine the power to grant anticipatory\nbail within a strait-jacket. While laying down cast-iron\nrules in a matter like granting anticipatory bail, as the\nHigh Court has done, it is apt to be overlooked that even\nJudges can have but an imperfect awareness of the needs of\nnew situations. Life is never static and every situation has\nto be assessed in the context of emerging concerns as and\nwhen it arises. Therefore, even if we were to frame a 'Code\nfor the grant of anticipatory bail', which really is the\nbusiness of the legislature, it can at best furnish broad\nguidelines and cannot compel blind adherence.\"\n\nFrom what has been extracted above, it is clear that\nthis Court should not venture to formulate rigid standards\nin an area in which the Legislature so warily treads. Only\nbroad guidelines consistent with the policy indicated by the\nLegislature in Section 354(3) can be laid down. Before we\ncome to this aspect of the matter, it will be fair to notice\nbriefly the decisions of the Supreme Court of U.S.A. in\nGregg v. Georgia and companion cases.\n\nSoon after the decision in Furman, the Georgia\nLegislature amended its statutory scheme. The amended\nstatute retains the death penalty for six categories of\ncrime: murder, kidnapping for ransom or where victim is\nharmed, armed robbery, rape, treason, and aircraft\nhijacking. The statutory aggravating circumstances, the\nexistence of any of which may justify the imposition of the\nextreme penalty of death, as provided in that statute, are:\n\n\"(1) The offence of murder, rape, armed robbery,\nor\nkidnapping was committed by a person with a prior\nrecord of conviction for a capital felony, (or the\noffence of murder was committed by a person who has a\nsubstantial history of serious assaultive criminal\nconvictions).\n\n(2) The offence of murder, rape, armed robbery,\nor kidnapping was committed while the offender was\nengaged in the commission of another capital felony, or\naggravated battery, or the offence of murder was\ncommitted while the offender was engaged in the\ncommission of burglary or arson in the first degree.\n(3) The offender by his act of murder, armed\nrobbery, or kidnapping knowingly created a great risk\nof death to more than one person in a public place by\nmeans of a weapon or device which would normally be\nhazaradous to the lives of more than one person.\n(4) The offender committed the offence of murder\nfor himself or another, for the purpose of receiving\nmoney or any other thing of monetary value.\n(5) The murder of a judicial officer, former\njudicial officer, district attorney or solicitor or\nformer district attorney or solicitor during or because\nof the exercise of his official duty.\n\n(6) The offender caused or directed another to\ncommitted murder as an agent or employee of another\nperson.\n\n(7) The offence of murder, rape, armed robbery,\nor kidnapping was outrageiously or want only vile\nhorrible or inhuman in that it involved torture,\ndepravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the\nvictim.\n\n(8) The offence of murder was committed against\nany peace officer, corrections employee or fireman\nwhile engaged in the performance or his official\nduties.\n\n(9) The offence of murder was committed by a\nperson in, or who has escaped from, the lawful custody\nof a peace officer or place of lawful confinement.\n(10) The murder was committed for the purpose of\navoiding, interfering with, or preventing a lawful\narrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement, of\nhimself or another.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia in\nArnold v. State\n(1),\nheld unconstitutional the portion (within brackets) of the\nfirst circumstances encompassing persons who have a\n\"substantial history of serious assaultive criminal\nconvictions\" but did not set clear and objective standards.\n\nThe amended statute, also, provided for a bifurcated\ntrial and a pre-sentence hearing. It also provides for an\nautomatic appeal of death sentence to the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia, which may or may not affirm the death sentence. The\nappellate court is also required to include reference to\nsimilar cases that the court considered.\n\nThe defendant (accused\n)\nin that case\nwas convicted of\ntwo counts of armed robbery and two counts of murder. The\naccused had committed the murders for the purpose of\nreceiving money and an automobile of one of the victims.\nAfter reviewing the trial record, the Georgia Supreme Court\naffirmed the convictions and the imposition of death\nsentences for murder, only. The constitutional validity of\nthe amended statutory scheme of Georgia was challenged\nbefore the Supreme Court of U.S.A. on the ground that the\nimposition of the death penalty for the crime of murder\nunder the Georgia statute violated the prohibition against\nthe infliction of cruel and unusual punishment under the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nLikewise in the companion case Proffitt v. Florida (2),\nthe Florida Legislature adopted new statutes that authorised\nthe imposition of the death penalty on those convicted of\nfirst-degree murders. Under the new Florida statutes, if a\ndefendant (accused) is found guilty of first-degree murder,\na separate presentence hearing is held before the jury,\nwhere arguments may be presented and where any evidence\ndeemed relevant to sentencing may be admitted and must\ninclude matters relating to eight aggravating and seven\nmitigating circumstances specified in the statutes, the jury\nis directed to weigh such circumstances and return an\nadvisory verdict as to the sentence.\n\n__________________\n(1) 236 Ga 534, 540, 224 SE 2d 386, 391 (1976)\n(2) 428 US 242, 49 L. Ed 2d 913 (1976).\nThe actual sentence is, however, determined by the trial\njudge, who is also directed to weigh the statutory\naggravating and mitigating circumstances. If a death\nsentence is imposed, the trial court must set forth in\nwriting its fact findings that sufficient statutory\naggravating circumstances exist and are not outweighed by\nstatutory mitigating circumstances. Just as in the Georgia\nstatute, a death sentence is to be automatically reviewed by\nthe Supreme Court of Florida. Under this new statutory\nscheme, the Florida Court found Proffitt (defendant) guilty\nof first-degree murder and sentenced him to death on the\nfinding that these aggravating circumstances were\nestablished :\n\n\"(1) The murder was premeditated and occurred in the\ncourse of a felony (burglary);\n\n(2) the defendant had the propensity to commit murder;\n(3) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and\ncruel ; and\n(4) the defendant knowingly, through his intentional\nact, had created a great risk of serious bodily\nharm and death to many persons.\"\n\nThe trial judge also found specifically that none of the\nstatutory mitigating circumstances existed. The Supreme\nCourt of Florida affirmed the death sentence. Before the\nSupreme Court of U.S.A. the constitutional validity of the\nimposition of death penalty for the crime of murder under\nthe Florida statutes was challenged on the same ground as in\nGregg v. Georgia. The Supreme Court of U.S.A. in both the\naforesaid cases negatived the challenge to the statutes and\nupheld their validity.\n\nIt may be recalled that in Furman, that Court had held\nthat if clear, definite and articulate standards channeling\nthe sentencing discretion for imposition of the death\npenalty are not laid down in a statute, it would violate the\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments. It may be noted that the\naggravating circumstance No. (7) is couched in a very wide\nand elastic language. The expressions \"outrageously or\nwantonly vile\", \"horrible or inhuman\" employed therein are\nof the widest amplitude and give this aggravating\ncircumstance the character of an omnibus clause. Likewise,\nin the Florida statute, the scope of the words \"especially\nheinous, atrocious and cruel\" was equally large and\nimprecise.\n\nIt can be seriously questioned whether these extremely\nelastic standards really exclude the uncontrolled exercise\nof sentencing discretion so as to meet the requirements of\nFurman.\n\nIn Gregg v. Georgia, the petitioner attacked the\nseventh statutory aggravating circumstance which authorises\nimposition of the death penalty if the murder was\n\"outrageously, or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman\" on the\nground that it was so broad that capital punishment could be\nimposed by its application in any murder case. Stewart, J.,\nspeaking for himself and for Powell and Stevens, JJ., got\nover this attack, in three ways:\n\nFirstly, by reading down the concerns expressed in\nFurman. In this connection, Stewart, J. said, all that\nFurman mandates is that discretion in so grave a matter must\nbe suitably directed \"so as to minimize the risk of wholly\narbitrary and capricious action.\" This was, if we may say so\nwith respect, an admission of the fact that a considerable\nrange of sentencing discretion has perforce to be left with\nthe sentencing body to be exercised by it according to its\nown good sense and reason, and that no standards howsoever\nmeticulously drafted can totally exclude scope for arbitrary\nand capricious action.\n\nThe second reason given to parry this attack was of a\ngeneral nature. It was observed:\n\n\"As a general proposition these concerns\n(expressed in Furman) are best met by a system that\nprovides for a bifurcated proceeding at which the\nsentencing authority is apprised of the information\nrelevant to the imposition of sentence and provided\nwith standards to guide its use of the information.\"\n\nThe third course adopted to foil the attack was:\n\n\"It is, of course, arguable that any murder\ninvolves depravity of mind or an aggravated battery.\nBut this language need not be construed in this way,\nand there is no reason to assume that the Supreme Court\nof Georgia will adopt such an open-ended construction,\"\nWhite, J. with whom the Chief Justice and Rehnquist, J.\njoined, negatived the change of these standards being vague\nand incomplete, with these observations:\n\n\"The argument is considerably overstated The\nGeorgia Legislature has plainly made an effort to guide\nthe jury in the exercise of its discretion, while at\nthe same time permitting the jury to dispense mercy on\nthe basis of factors too intangible to write into a\nstatute, and I cannot accept the naked assertion that\nthe effort is bound to fail. As the types of murders\nfor which the death penalty may be imposed became more\nnarrowly defined and are limited to those which are\nparticularly serious or for which the death penalty is\nparticularly appropriate as they are in Georgia by\nreasons of the aggrvating-circumstance requirement, it\nbecomes reasonable to expect that Georgia's current\nsystem would escape the infirmities which invalidated\nits previous system under Furman. Indeed, if the\nGeorgia Supreme Court properly performs the task\nassigned to it under the Georgia statutes, death\nsentences imposed wantonly or freakishly for any given\ncategory of crime will be set aside.\"\n\nSimilarly, in Proffit v. Florida, it was contended that\nthe enumerated aggravating and mitigating circumstances in\nthe Florida statute are so vague and so broad that virtually\n\"any capital defendant becomes a candidate for the death\npenalty\". In particular, the petitioner attacked the eighth\nand third statutory aggravating circumstances which\nauthorise the death penalty to be imposed if the crime is\n\"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" or if \"the\ndefendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many\npersons\".\n\nAgreeing with the Supreme Court of Florida, the Supreme\nCourt of U.S.A. recognised that \"while it is arguable that\nall killing are atrocious, still we believe that the\nLegislature intended something especially heinous,\natrocious, of cruel\" when it authorised the death penalty\nfor first-degree murder. As a consequence, the Court has\nindicated that the eighth statutory provision is directed\nonly at \"the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is\nunnecessarily tortuous to the victim\".\nIt appears to us that in Gregg v. Georgia and the\ncompanion cases, the Supreme Court of U.S.A. was obliged to\nread down the requirements of Furman and to accept these\nbroadly worded, looseended and not-all-inclusive 'standards'\nbecause in the area of sentencing discretion, if it was to\nretain its judicial character, exhaustive standardisation or\nperfect regulation was neither feasible nor desirable.\n\nMoreover, over-standardisation of the sentencing\nprocess tends to defeat its very purpose, and may actually\nproduce opposite results.\n\nMessinger and Bittner's Criminology Year Book (ibid)\nAlbert W. Alcherler's article at page 421 highlights this\ndanger, by taking, inter alia, the example of the guided-\ndiscretion capital punishment statutes favoured by the\nSupreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia and its companion cases,\nas follows:\n\nA defendant convicted of capital murder might wish\nto make the following speech to the jury about to\nconsider whether capital punishment should be imposed:\n\n\"I am deeply sorry for my crime which I recognize\nwas about as bad as any that can be imagined. I did, in\nfact, go to the police station shortly after the\nkilling to surrender and make a full confession.\nAlthough I have done some terrible things in my life\nyou may wish to know, before deciding whether I should\nlive or die, that I have also done some good. I once\nrisked my life in combat to save five comrades-an\naction for which I was awarded the Silver Star-and for\nthe last 10 years I have personally cared for my\ninvalid mother while supporting 5 younger brothers and\nsisters.\n\n\"The mitigating factors listed in today's capital\npunishment statutes are sometimes quite general, but\nnone that I have seen in any statute would permit a\njury to consider any of the circumstances mentioned in\nthis defendant's speech (or, for that matter any other\nevidence of pre-crime virtue or past-crime remorse).\nApparently the Florida statute's upheld in Proffitt v.\nFlorida would not; yet the Supreme Court plurality,\nseemingly oblivious to the\nstatutes limitations, declared in a companion case, 'A\njury must be allowed to consider on the basis of all\nrelevant evidence not only why a death sentence should\nbe imposed, but also why it should not be imposed.\"\n\n(Jurek v.Texas.(1)\nCritically examined, it is clear that the decisions in\nGregg v.Georgia and its companion cases demonstrate the\ntruth of what we have said earlier, that it is neither\npracticable nor desirable to imprison the sentencing\ndiscretion of a judge or jury in the straitjacket of\nexhaustive and rigid standards, Nevertheless, these\ndecisions do show that it is not impossible to lay down\nbroad guidelines as distinguished from ironcased standards,\nwhich will minimise the risk of arbitrary imposition of\ndeath penalty for murder and some other offences under the\nPenal Code.\n\nThis takes us to the question of indicating the broad\ncriteria which should guide the Courts in the matter of\nsentencing a person convicted of murder under Section 302,\nPenal Code. Before we embark on this task, it will be proper\nto remind ourselves, again that \"while we have an obligation\nto ensure that the constitutional bounds are not over-\nreached, we may not act as judges as we might as\nlegislatures.\"(2)\nIn Jagmohan, this Court had held that this sentencing\ndiscretion is to be exercised judicially on well-recognised\nprinciples, after balancing all the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances of the crime. By \"well-recognised\nprinciples\" the Court obviously meant the principles\ncrystallised by judicial decisions illustrating as to what\nwere regarded as aggravating or mitigating circumstances in\nthose eases. The legislative changes since Jagmohan-as we\nhave discussed already-do not have the effect of abrogating\nor nullifying those principles. The only effect is that the\napplication of those principles is now to be guided by the\nparamount beacons of legislative policy discernible from\nSections 354 (3) and 235 (2), namely: (1) The extreme\npenalty can be inflicted only in gravest cases of extreme\nculpability; (2) In making choice of the sentence, in\naddition to the circumstances of the offence, due regard\nmust be paid to the circumstances of the offences, also.\n__________________________\n(1) 428 US 262, 271(1976).\n\n(2) Per Stewart. J. in Gregg. v. Georgia.\nWe will first notice some of the aggravating\ncircumstances which, in the absence of any mitigating\ncircumstances, have been regarded as an indication for\nimposition of the extreme penalty.\n\nPre-planned, calculated, cold-blooded murder has always\nbeen regarded as one of an aggravated kind. In Jagmohan, it\nwas reiterated by this Court that if a murder is\n\"diabolically conceived and cruelly executed\", it would\njustify the imposition of the death penalty on the murderer.\nThe same principle was substantially reiterated by V.R.\nKrishna Iyer, J., speaking for the Bench, in Ediga Anamma,\nin these terms:\n\n\"The weapons used and the manner of their use, the\nhorrendous features of the crime and hapless, helpless\nstate of the victim, and the like, steel the heart of\nthe law for a sterner sentence.\"\n\nIt may be noted that this indicator for imposing the\ndeath sentence was crystallised in that case after paying\ndue regard to the shift in legislative policy embodied in\n\nSection 354(3)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,\nalthough on the date of that decision (February 11, 1974),\nthis provision had not come into force. In Paras Ram's case,\nalso, to which a reference has been made earlier, it was\nemphatically stated that a person who in a fit of anti-\nsocial piety commits \"blood-curdling butchery\" of his child,\nfully deserves to be punished with death. In Rajendra\nPrasad, however, the majority (of 2:1) has completely\nreversed the view that had been taken in Ediga Anamma,\nregarding the application of Section 354(3) on this point.\nAccording to it, after the enactment of Section 354(3)\n'murder most foul' is not the test. The shocking nature of\nthe crime or the number of murders committed is also not the\ncriterion. It was said that the focus has now completely\nshifted from the crime to the criminal. \"Special reasons\"\n\nnecessary for imposing death penalty \"must relate not to the\ncrime as such but to the criminal\".\n\nWith great respect, we find ourselves unable to agree\nto this enunciation. As we read Sections 354(3) and 235(2)\nand other related provisions of the Code of 1973, it is\nquite clear to us that for making the choice of punishment\nor for ascertaining the existence or absence of \"special\nreasons\" in that context, the Court must pay due regard both\nto the crime and the criminal. What is the relative weight\nto be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors,\ndepends on the facts and circumstances of the particular\ncase. More often than not, these two aspects are so\nintertwined that it is difficult to give a separate\ntreatment to each of them. This is so because 'style is the\nman'. In many cases, the extremely cruel or beastly manner\nof the commission of murder is itself a demonstrated index\nof the depraved character of the perpetrator. That is why,\nit is not desirable to consider the circumstances of the\ncrime and the circumstances of the criminal in two separate\nwater-tight compartments. In a sense, to kill is to be cruel\nand, therefore, all murders are cruel. But such cruelty may\nvary in its degree of culpability. And it is only when the\nculpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravity that\n\"special reasons\" can legitimately be said to exist.\n\nDrawing upon the penal statutes of the States in U.S.A.\nframed after Furman v. Georgia, in general, and clauses\n(2)(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the\nIndian Penal Code\n\n(Amendment) Bill passed in 1978 by the Rajya Sabha, in\nparticular, Dr. Chitale has suggested these \"aggravating\ncircumstances\".\n\n\"Aggravating circumstances: A Court may, however,\nin the following cases impose the penalty of death in\nits discretion:\n\n(a) if the murder has been committed after previous\nplanning and involves extreme brutality; or\n\n(b) if the murder involves exceptional depravity; or\n\n(c) if the murder is of a member of any of the armed\nforces of the Union or of a member of any police\nforce or of any public servant and was committed.\n\n(i) while such member or public servant was on\nduty; or\n\n(ii) in consequence of anything done or attempted\nto be done by such member or public servant\nin the lawful discharge of his duty as such\nmember or public servant whether at the time\nof murder he was such member or public\nservant, as the case may be, or had ceased to\nbe such member or public servant; or\n\n(d) if the murder is of a person who had acted in the\nlawful discharge of his duty under\nSection 43\nof\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, or who had\nrendered assistance to a Magistrate or a police\nofficer demanding his aid or requiring his\nassistance under\nSection 37\nand Section 129 of the\nsaid Code.\"\n\nStated broadly, there can be no objection to the\nacceptance of these indicators but as we have indicated\nalready, we would prefer not to fetter judicial discretion\nby attempting to make an exhaustive enumeration one way or\nthe other.\n\nIn Rajendra Prasad, the majority said: \"It is\nconstitutionally permissible to swing a criminal out of\ncorporeal existence only if the security of State and\nsociety, public order and the interests of the general\npublic compel that course as provided in\nArticle 19(2)\nto\n(6).\" Our objection is only to the word \"only\". While it may\nbe conceded that a murder which directly threatens, or has\nan extreme potentiality to harm or endanger the security of\nState and society, public order and the interests of the\ngeneral public, may provide \"special reasons\" to justify the\nimposition of the extreme penalty on the person convicted of\nsuch a heinous murder, it is not possible to agree that\nimposition of death penalty on murderers who do not fall\nwithin this narrow category is constitutionally\nimpermissible. We have discussed and held above that the\nimpugned provisions in Section 302, Penal Code, being\nreasonable and in the general public interest, do not offend\n\nArticle 19\n, or its 'ethos'; nor do they in any manner\nviolate\nArticles 21\nand\n14.\nAll the reasons given by us for\nupholding the validity of Section 302, Penal Code, fully\napply to the case of\nSection 354(3)\n, Code of Criminal\nProcedure, also. The same criticism applies to the view\ntaken in\nBishnu Deo Shaw v. State of West Bengal\n, (1) which\nfollows the dictum in Rajendra Prasad (ibid).\n\nIn several countries which have retained death penalty,\npreplanned murder for monetary gain, or by an assassin hired\nfor\n___________________\n(1) [1979] S.C.C. 714.\nmonetary reward is, also, considered a capital offence of\nthe first-degree which, in the absence of any ameliorating\ncircumstances, is punishable with death. Such rigid\ncategorisation would dangerously overlap the domain of\nlegislative policy. It may necessitate, as it were, a\nredefinition of 'murder' or its further classification.\nThen, in some decisions, murder by fire-arm, or an automatic\nprojectile or bomb, or like weapon, the use of which creates\na high simultaneous risk of death or injury to more than one\nperson, has also been treated as an aggravated type of\noffence. No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating\ncircumstances is possible. But this much can be said that in\norder to qualify for inclusion in the category of\n\"aggravating circumstances\" which may form the basis of\n'special reasons' in Section 354(3), circumstances found on\nthe facts of a particular case, must evidence aggravation of\nan abnormal or special degree.\n\nDr. Chitaley has suggested these mitigating factors:\n\n\"Mitigating circumstances: In the exercise of its\ndiscretion in the above cases, the Court shall take\ninto account the following circumstances:\n\n(1) That the offence was committed under the influence\nof extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\n(2) The age of the accused. If the accused is young or\nold, he shall not be sentenced to death.\n(3) The probability that the accused would not commit\ncriminal acts of violence as would constitute a\ncontinuing threat to society.\n\n(4) The probability that the accused can be reformed\nand rehabilitated. The State shall by evidence\nprove that the accused does not satisfy the\nconditions 3 and 4 above.\n\n(5) That in the facts and circumstances of the case\nthe accused believed that he was morally justified\nin committing the offence.\n\n(6) That the accused acted under the duress or\ndomination of another person.\n(7) That the condition of the accused showed that he\nwas mentally defective and that the said defect\nimpaired his capacity to appreciate the\ncriminality of his conduct.\"\n\nWe will do no more than to say that these are\nundoubtedly relevant circumstances and must be given great\nweight in the determination of sentence. Some of these\nfactors like extreme youth can instead be of compelling\nimportance. In several States of India, there are in force\nspecial enactments, according to which a 'child', that is,\n'a person who at the date of murder was less than 16 years\nof age', cannot be tried, convicted and sentenced to death\nor imprisonment for life for murder, nor dealt with\naccording to the same procedure as an adult. The special\nActs provide for a reformatory procedure for such juvenile\noffenders or children.\n\nAccording to some Indian decisions, the post-murder\nremorse, penitance or repentence by the murderer is not a\nfactor which may induce the Court to pass the lesser penalty\n(e.g. Mominaddi Sardar). But those decisions can no longer\nbe held to be good law in views of the current penological\ntrends and the sentencing policy outlined in Section 235(2)\nand 354(3). We have already extracted the view of A.W.\nAlchuler in Cr. Y.E. by Messinger and Bittner (ibid), which\nare in point.\n\nThere are numerous other circumstances justifying the\npassing of the lighter sentence; as there are countervailing\ncircumstances of aggravation. \"We cannot obviously feed into\na judicial computer all such situations since they are\nastrological imponderables in an imperfect and undulating\nsociety.\" Nonetheless, it cannot be overemphasised that the\nscope and concept of mitigating factors in the area of death\npenalty must receive a liberal and expansive construction by\nthe courts in accord with the sentencing policy writ large\nin Section 354(3). Judges should never be blood-thirsty.\nHedging of murderers has never been too good for them. Facts\nand figures, albeit incomplete, furnished by the Union of\nIndia, show that in the past, Courts have inflicted the\nextreme penalty with extreme infrequency-a fact which\nattests to the caution and compassion which they have always\nbrought to bear on the exercise of their sentencing\ndiscretion in so grave a matter. It is, therefore,\nimperative to voice the concern that courts, aided by the\nbroad illustrative guidelines\nindicated by us, will discharge the onerous function with\nevermore scrupulous care and humane concern, directed along\nthe highroad of legislative policy outlined in Section\n354(3), viz, that for persons convicted of murder, life\nimprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. A\nreal and abiding concern for the dignity of human life\npostulates resistance to taking a life through law's\ninstrumentality. That ought not to be done save in the\nrarest of rare cases when the alternative option is\nunquestionably foreclosed.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, we reject the challenge\nto the constitutionality of the impugned provisions\ncontained in Sections 302, Penal Code, and 354(3) of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973.\n\nThe writ petitions and the connected petitions can now\nbe heard and disposed of, on their individual merits, in the\nlight of the broad guidelines and principles enunciated in\nthis judgment.\n\nBHAGWATI, J. These writ petitions challenge the\nconstitutional validity of\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal\nCode read with Section 354, sub-section (3) of the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\nin so far as it provides death sentence\nas an alternative punishment for the offence of murder.\nThere are several grounds on which the constitutional\nvalidity of the death penalty provided in\nSection 302\nof the\nIndian Penal Code read with section 354 sub-section (3) of\nthe\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nis assailed before us, but it\nis not necessary to set them out at this stage, for I\npropose to deal with them when I examine the arguments\nadvanced on behalf of the parties. Suffice it to state for\nthe present that I find, considerable force in some of these\ngrounds and in my view, the constitutional validity of the\ndeath penalty provided as an alternative punishment in\n\nsection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code read with section 354\nsub-section (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\ncannot be\nsustained. I am conscious that my learned brethren on the\nBench who constitute the majority have taken a different\nview and upheld the constitutional validity of the death\npenalty but, with the greatest respect to them and in all\nhumility, I cannot persuade myself to concur with the view\ntaken by them. Mine is unfortunately a solitary dissent and\nit is therefore, with a certain amount of hesitation that I\nspeak but my initial diffidence is overcome by my deep and\nabiding faith in the dignity of man and worth of the human\nperson and passionate\nconviction about the true spiritual nature and dimension of\nman. I agree with Bernard Shaw that \"Criminals do not die by\nthe hands of the law. They die by the hands of other men.\nAssassination on the scaffold is the worst form of\nassassination because there it is invested with the approval\nof the society.....Murder and capital punishment are not\nopposites that cancel one another but similars that breed\ntheir kind.\" It was the Father of the nation who said years\nago, reaffirming what Prince Satyavan said on capital\npunishment in Shanti Parva of Mahabharata that \"Destruction\nof individuals can never be a virtuous act\" and this\nsentiment has been echoed by many eminent men such as\nLeonardo Da Vinci, John Bright, Victor Hugo and Berdyaev. To\nquote again from Bernard Shaw from Act IV of his play\n\"Caesar and Cleopatra:\n\n\"And so to the end of history, murder shall breed\nmurder, always in the name of right and honour and\npeace, until the Gods are tired of blood and-create a\nrace that can understand.\"\n\nI share this sentiment because I regard men as an embodiment\nof divinity and I am therefore morally against death\npenalty. But my dissent is based not upon any ground of\nmorality or ethics but is founded on constitutional issues,\nfor as I shall presently show, death penalty does not serve\nany social purpose or advance any constitutional value and\nis totally arbitrary and unreasonable so as to be violative\nof\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\nBefore I proceed to consider the various constitutional\nissues arising out of the challenge to the validity of the\ndeath penalty, I must deal with a preliminary objection\nraised on behalf of the respondents against our competence\nto entertain this challenge. The learned counsel appearing\non behalf of the respondents urged that the question of\nconstitutional validity of the death penalty stood concluded\nagainst the petitioners by the decision of a constitution\nbench of five Judges of this Court in\nJagmohan v. State of\nU.P.\n(1) and it could not therefore be allowed to be\nreagitated before this Bench consisting of the same number\nof Judges.\n\nThis Bench, contended the respondents, was bound\nby the decision in Jagmohan's case(supra) and the same\nissue, once decided in\nJagmohan\n's case (supra), could not be\nraised again and reconsidered by this Bench. Now it is true\nthat\n______________\n(1) AIR 1973 SC 947.\nthe question of constitutional validity of death penalty was\nraised in\nJagmohan\n's case (supra) and this Court by a\nunanimous judgment held it to be constitutionally valid and,\ntherefore, ordinarily, on the principle of stare decisis, we\nwould hold ourselves bound by the view taken\nin that case\n\nand resist any attempt at reconsideration of the same issue.\nBut there are several weighty considerations which compel us\nto depart from this precedential rule in the present case.\nIt may be pointed out that the rule of adherence to\nprecedence is not a rigid and inflexible rule of law but it\nis a rule of practice adopted by the courts for the purpose\nof ensuring uniformity and stability in the law. Otherwise,\nevery Judge will decide an issue according to his own view\nand lay down a rule according to his own perception and\nthere will be no certainty and predictability in the law,\nleading to chaos and confusion and in the process,\ndestroying the rule of law. The labour of the judges would\nalso, as pointed out by Cardozo J. in his lectures of\n\"Nature of Judicial Process\" increase\" almost to the\nbreaking point if every past decision could be reopened in\nevery case and one could not lay one's own course of bricks\non the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who\nhad gone before him.\" But this rule of adherence to\nprecedents, though a necessary tool in what Maitland called\n\"the legal smithy\", is only a useful servant and cannot be\nallowed to turn into a tyrannous master.\nWe would do well to\nrecall what Brandies J. said in his dissenting judgment in\nState of Washington v. Dawson and company,(1) namely; \"Stare\ndecisis is ordinarily a wise rule of action. But it is not a\nuniversal and inexorable command.\" If the Rule of stare\ndecisis were followed blindly and mechanically, it would\ndwarf and stultify the growth of the law and affect its\ncapacity to adjust itself to the changing needs of the\nsociety. That is why Cardozo pointed out in his New York\nState Bar Address:\n\n\"That was very well for a time, but now at last\nthe precedents have turned upon us and are engulfing\nand annihilating us-engulfing and annihilating the very\ndevotees that worshipped at their shrine. So the air is\nfull of new cults that disavow the ancient faiths. Some\nof them tell us that instead of seeking certainty in\nthe word, the outward sign, we are to seek for\nsomething deeper, a certainty of ends and aims. Some of\nthem tell us that certainty is merely relative and\ntemporary, a writing on the sands to\n_________\n(1) 264 US 646 : 68 Lawyers Edu. 219\nbe effected by the advancing tides. Some of them even\ngo so far as to adjure us to give over the vain quest,\nto purge ourselves of these yearnings for an\nunattainable ideal, and to be content with an\nempiricism that is untroubled by strivings for the\nabsolute. With all their diversities of form and\ndoctrine, they are at one at least in their emphasis\nupon those aspects of truth that are fundamental and\nultimate. They exemplify the method approach, the\nattitude and outlook, the concern about the substance\nof things, which in all its phases and disguises is the\nessence of philosophy.\"\n\nWe must therefore rid stare decisis of something of its\npetrifying rigidity and warn ourselves with Cardozo that \"in\nmany instances the principles and rules and concepts of our\nown creation are merely apercus and glimpses of reality\" and\nremind oursevels \"of the need of reformulating them or at\ntimes abandoning them altogether when they stand condemned\nas mischievous in the social consciousness of the\nhour,...the social consciousness which it is our business as\nJudges to interpret as best as we can.\" The question at\nissue in the present writ petitions is one of momentous\nsignificance namely, whether the state can take the life of\nan individual under the cover of judicial process and\nwhether such an act of killing by the State is in accord\nwith the constitutional norms and values and if, on an issue\nlike this, a Judge feels strongly that it is not competent\nto the State to extinguish the flame of life in an\nindividual by employing the instrumentality of the judicial\nprocess, it is his bounden duty, in all conscience, to\nexpress his dissent, even if such killing by the State is\nlegitimized by a previous decision of the court. There are\ncertain issues which transcend technical considerations of\nstare decisis and if such an issue is brought before the\ncourt, it would be nothing short of abdication of its\nconstitutional duty for the court to consider such issue by\ntaking refuge under the doctrine of stare decisis. The court\nmay refuse to entertain such an issue like the\nconstitutional validity of death penalty because it is\nsatisfied that the previous decision is correct but it\ncannot decline to consider it on the ground that it is\nbarred by the rule of adherence to precedents. Moreover, in\nthe present case, there are two other supervening\ncircumstances which justify, nay compel, reconsideration of\nthe decision in\nJagmohan\n's case (supra). The first is the\nintroduction of the new\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nin 1973\nwhich by sec-\ntion 354 sub-section (3) has made life sentence the rule in\ncase of offences punishable with death or in the alternative\nimprisonment for life and provided for imposition of\nsentence of death only in exceptional cases for special\nreasons. I shall presently refer to this section enacted in\nthe new\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nand show how, in view of\nthat provision, the imposition of death penalty has become\nstill more indefensible from the constitutional point of\nview. But the more important circumstance which has\nsupervened since the decision in\nJagmohan\n's case (supra) is\nthe new dimension of\nArticles 14\nand\nunfolded by this\nCourt in\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n.(1) This new\ndimension of\nArticles 14\nand\nrenders the death penalty\nprovided in\nsection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code read with\n\nsec. 354 (3)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure vulnerable to\nattack on a ground not available at the time when Jagmohan's\ncase (supra) was decided. Furthermore, it may also be noted,\nand this too is a circumstance not entirely without\nsignificance, that since Jagmohan's case (supra) was\ndecided, India has ratified two international instruments on\nhuman rights and particularly the International Convenant on\nCivil and Political Rights.\n\nWe cannot therefore consider\nourselves bound by the view taken in\nJagmohan\n's case (supra)\nand I must proceed to consider the issue as regards the\nconstitutional validity of death penalty afresh, without\nbeing in any manner inhibited by the decision in Jagmohan's\ncase (supra).\n\nIt must be realised that the question of constitutional\nvalidity of death penalty is not just a simple question of\napplication of constitutional standards by adopting a\nmechanistic approach. It is a difficult problem of\nconstitutional interpretation to which it is not possible to\ngive an objectively correct legal anwer. It is not a mere\nlegalistic problem which can be answered definitively by the\napplication of logical reasoning but it is a problem which\nraises profound social and moral issues and the answer must\ntherefore necessarily depend on the judicial philosophy of\nthe Judge. This would be so in case of any problem of\nconstitutional interpretation but much more so would it be\nin a case like the present where the constitutional\nconundrum is enmeshed in complex social and moral issues\ndefying a formalistic judicial attitude. That is the reason\nwhy in some countries like the United States and Canada\nwhere\n_________________\n(1) [1978] 2 SCR 663.\nthere is power of judicial review, there has been judicial\ndisagreement on the constitutionality of death penalty. On\nan issue like this, as pointed out by David Pannick in his\nbook on \"Judicial Review of the Death Penalty\" judicial\nconclusions emanate from the judicial philosophy of those\nwho sit in judgment and not from the language of the\nConstitution.\" But even so, in their effort to resolve such\nan issue of great constitutional significance, the Judges\nmust take care to see that they are guided by \"objective\nfactors to the maximum possible extent.\" The culture and\nethos of the nation as gathered from its history, its\ntradition and its literature would clearly be relevant\nfactors in adjudging the constitutionality of death penalty\nand so would the ideals and values embodied in the\nConstitution which lays down the basic frame-work of the\nsocial and political structure of the country, and which\nsets out the objectives and goals to be pursued by the\npeople in a common endeavour to secure happiness and welfare\nof every member of the society. So also standards or norms\nset by International organisations and bodies have relevance\nin determining the constitutional validity of death penalty\nand equally important in construing and applying the\nequivocal formulae of the Constitution would be the \"wealth\nof non-legal learning and experience that encircles and\nilluminates\" the topic of death penalty. \"Judicial\ndispensers\", said Krishna Iyer, J. in\nDalbir Singh and\nOthers v. State of Punjab\n(1) \"do not behave like cavemen but\nbreathe the fresh air of finer culture.\" There is no reason\nwhy, in adjudicating upon the constitutional validity of\ndeath penalty. Judges should not obtain assistance from the\nwritings of men like Dickens, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Koestter\nand Camus or from the investigations of social scientists or\nmoral philosophers in deciding the circumstances in which\nand the reasons why the death penalty could be seen as\narbitrary or a denial of equal protection. It is necessary\nto bear in mind the wise and felicitous words of Judge\nLearned Hand in his \"Spirit of Liberty\" that while passing\non question of constitutional interpretation, it is as\nimportant to a Judge:\n\n\".....to have atleast a bowing acquaintance with\nActon and Maitland. With Thucydides, Gibbon and\nCarlyle, with Homer, Dante Shakespeare and Milton, with\nMachiavelli, Montaigne and Rabelais, with Plato, Bacon,\nHume\nand Kant, as with the books which have been\nspecifically written on the subject. For in such\nmatters everything turns upon the spirit in which he\napproaches the question before him. The words he must\nconstrue are empty vessels into which he can pour\nnearly anything he will. Men do not gather figs of\nthistles, nor supply institutions from judges whose\noutlook is limited by parish or class. They must be\naware that there are before them more than verbal\nproblems; more than final solutions cast in\ngeneralisations of universal applicability.\"\n\nConstitutional law raises, in a legal context, problems of\neconomic, social, moral and political theory and practice to\nwhich non-lawyers have much to contribute. Non-lawyers have\nnot reached unanimity on the answers to the problems posed;\nnor will they ever do so, But when judges are confronted by\nissues to which there is no legal answer, there is no reason\n(other than a desire to maintain a fiction that the law\nprovides the answer) for judicial discretion to be exercised\nin a vacuum, immune from non-legal learning and extra-legal\ndispute. \"Quotations from noble minds are not for decoration\n(in hard constitutional cases) but for adaptation within the\nframework of the law.\" Vide: David Pannick on 'Judicial\nReview of the Death Penalty.' The Judges must also consider\nwhile deciding an issue of constitutional adjudication as to\nwhat would be the moral, social and economic consequences of\na decision either way. The consequences of course do not\nalter the meaning of a constitutional or statutory provision\nbut they certainly help to fix its meaning. With these\nprefatory observations I shall now proceed to consider the\nquestion of constitutional validity of death penalty.\n\nI shall presently refer to the constitutional\nprovisions which bear on the question of constitutionality\nof death penalty, but before I do so, it would be more\nlogical if I first examine what is the international trend\nof opinion in regard to death penalty. There are quite a\nlarge number of countries which have abolished death penalty\nde jure or in any event, de facto The Addendum to the Report\nof the Amnesty International on \"The Death Penalty\" points\nout that as on 30th May 1979, the following countries have\nabolished death penalty for all offences : Australia,\nBrazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican Republic,\nEcuador, Fiji, Finland, Federal Republic of Germany,\nHonduras, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Sweden,\nUruguay and Venezuela, and according\nto this Report, Canada, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Panama,\nPeru, Spain and Switzerland have abolished death penalty in\ntime of peace, but retained it for specific offences\ncommitted in time of war. The Report also states that\nAlgeria, Belgium, Greece, Guyana, Ivory Coast, Seychelles\nand Upper Volta have retained the death penalty on their\nstatute book but they did not conduct any executions for the\nperiod from 1973 to 30th May 1979. Even in the United States\nof America there are several States which have abolished\ndeath penalty and so also in the United Kingdom, death\npenalty stands abolished from the year 1965 save and except\nfor offences of treason and certain forms of piracy and\noffences committed by members of the armed forces during war\ntime. It may be pointed out that an attempt was made in the\nUnited Kingdom in December 1975 to reintroduce death penalty\nfor terrorist offences involving murder but it was defeated\nin the House of Commons and once again a similar motion\nmoved by a conservative member of Parliament that \"the\nsentence of capital punishment should again be available to\nthe courts\" was defeated in the House of Commons in a free\nvote on 19th July 1979. So also death penalty has been\nabolished either formally or in practice in several other\ncountries such as Argentina, Bolivia, most of the federal\nStates of Mexico and Nicaragua, Israel, Turkey and Australia\ndo not use the death penalty in practice. It will thus be\nseen that there is a definite trend in most of the countries\nof Europe and America towards abolition of death penalty.\n\nIt is significant to note that the United Nations has\nalso taken great interest in the abolition of capital\npunishment. In the Charter of the United Nations signed in\n1945, the founding States emphasized the value of\nindividuals's life, stating their will to \"achieve\ninternational co-operation...in promoting and encouraging\nrespect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for\nall without distinction as to race, sex, language or\nreligion.\" Though the San Francisco Conference did not\naddress itself to the issue of death penalty specifically,\nthe provisions of the charter paved the way for further\naction by United Nations bodies in the field of human\nrights, by establishing a Commission on Human Rights and, in\neffect, charged that body with formulating an International\nBill of Human Rights. Meanwhile the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights was adopted by the General Assembly in its\nResolution 217 A (III) of 10 December 1948.\nArticles 3\nand\nof the Declaration provided:\n3. \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and\nsecurity of person.\"\n\n5. \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel,\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nThe United Nations' position on the question of death\npenalty was expected to be stated more specifically in the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the\ndrafting of which had been under way since the first session\nof the Commission on Human Rights in 1947. But during the 11\nyear period of drafting of the relevant provision of the\nCovenant, two main approaches to the issue of capital\npunishment became evident: one stressed the need for barring\nthe death penalty and the second placed emphasis on\nresstricting its application to certain cases. The\nproponents of the first position suggested either the total\nabolition of the death penalty or its abolition in time of\npeace or for political offences. This approach was however\nregarded as unfeasible, since many countries, including\nabolitionist ones, felt that the provision for an outright\nban on the death penalty would prevent some States from\nratifying the Covenant, but at the same time, it was\ninsisted by many countries that the Covenant should not\ncreate the impression of supporting or perpetuating death\npenalty and hence a provision to this effect should be\nincluded. The result was that the second approach stressing\neveryone's right to life and emphasizing the need for\nrestricting the application of capital punishment with a\nview to eventual abolition of the death penalty, won greater\nsupport and\nArticle 6\nof the Covenant as finally adopted by\nthe General Assembly in its resolution 2000(XXX) of 16\nDecember 1966 provided as follows :\n\n1. Every human being has the inherent right to life.\n\nThis right shall be protected by law. No one shall\nbe arbitrarily deprived of his life.\n\n2. In countries which have not abolished the death\npenalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for\nthe most serious crimes in accordance with the law\nin force at the time of the commission of the\ncrime and not contrary to the provisions of the\npresent Covenant and to the Convention on the\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of\nGenocide. This\npenalty can only be carried out pursuant to a\nfinal judgment rendered by a competent court.\n\n3. When deprivation of life constitutes the crime of\ngenocide, it is understood, that nothing in this\narticle shall authorise any State Party to the\npresent Covenant to derogate in any way from any\nobligatlon assumed under the provisions of the\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the\nCrime of Genocide.\n\n4. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to\nseek, pardon or commutation of the sentence.\nAmnesty pardon or commutation of the sentence of\ndeath may be granted in all cases.\n\n5. Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes\ncommitted by persons below eighteen years of age\nand shall not be carried out on pregnant women.\n\n6. Nothing in this article shall be invoked to delay\nor prevent the abolition of capital punishment by\nany State Party to the present Covennt.\"\n\nArticle 7\nof the Covenant corresponding to\nArticle 5\nof the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights reaffirmed that no one\nshall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading treatment or punishment.\n\nSo deep and profound was the United Nation's concern\nwith the issue of death penalty that the General Assembly in\nits resolotion 1396 (XIV) of 20 November, 1959 invited the\nEconomic and Social Council to initiate study of the\nquestion of capital punishment, of the laws and practices\nrelating thereto, and of the effects of capital punishment\nand the abolition thereof on the rate of criminality.\nPursuant to this resolution, the Economic and Social Council\nactivised itself on this issue and at its instance a\nsubstantive report report was prepared by the noted French\njurist Marc Ancel. The report entitled \"Capital Punishment\"\n\nwas the first major survey of the problem from an\ninternational stand point on the deterrent aspect of the\ndeath penalty and in its third chapter, it contained a\ncautious statement \"that the deterrent effect of the death\npenalty is, to say the least, not demons-\ntrated\". This view had been expressed not only by\nabolitionists countries in their replies to the\nquestionaires but also by some retentionist countries. The\nAncel report alongwith the Report of the ad hoc Advisory\nCommittee of Experts on the Prevention of Crime and the\nTreatment of Offenders which examined it in January 1963 was\npresented to the Economic and Social Council at its 35th\nSession when its Resolution 934 (XXXV) of 9th April 1963 was\nadopted. By this Resolution the Economic and Social Council\nurged member governments inter alia to keep under review the\nefficacy of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime in\ntheir countries and to conduct research into the subject and\nto remove this punishment from the criminal law concerning\nany crime to which it is, in fact, not applied or to which\nthere is no intention to apply it. This Resolution clearly\nshows that there was no evidence supporting the supposed\ndeterrent effect of the death penalty and that is why the\nEconomic and Social Council suggested further research on\nthe topic. Moreover, the urging of the de facto abolitionist\ncountries by this Resolution to translate the position into\nde jure terms constituted an implicit acceptance of the\nprinciple of abolition. The same year, by Resolution 1918\n(XVIII) of 5th December 1963, the General Assembly endorsed\nthis action of the Economic and Social Council and requested\nthe Economic and Social Council to invite the Commission on\nhuman Rights to study and make recommendations on the Ancel\nReport and the comments of the ad hoc Advisory Committee of\nExperts. The General Assembly also requested the Secretary\nGeneral to present a report on new developments through the\nEconomic and Social Council. Norval Morris, an American\nprofessor of criminal law and criminology, accordingly\nprepared a Report entitled \"Capital Punishment; Developments\n1961-1965\" and amongst other things, this Report pointed out\nthat there was a steady movement towards legislative\nabolition of capital punishment and observed with regard to\nthe deterrent effect of death penalty, that:\n\n\"With respect to the influence of the abolition of\ncapital punishment upon the incidence of murder, all of\nthe available data suggest that where the murder rate\nis increasing, abolition does not appear to hasten the\nincrease where the rate is decreasing abolition does\nnot appear to interrupt the decrease; where the rate is\nstable, the presence or absence of capital punishment\ndoes not appear to affect it.\"\nThe Commission on Human Rights considered this Report and\nadopted a draft General Assembly Resolution which was\nsubmitted by the Economic and Social Council to the General\nAssembly and on 26th November 1968, the General Assembly\nadopted this draft with certain modifications as its\nResolution 2393 (XXIII) inviting member governments to take\nvarious measures and requesting the Secretary General to\ninvite member governments \"to inform him of their present\nattitude to possible further restricting the use of the\ndeath penalty or to its total abolition\" and to submit a\nreport to the Economic and Social Council. The Secretary\nGeneral accordingly submitted his report to the Economic and\nSocial Council at its 50th session in 1971. This Report\ncontained a finding that \"most countries are gradually\nrestricting the number of offences for which the death\npenalty is to be applied and a few have totally abolished\ncapital offences even in war times\". The discussion in the\nEconomic and Social Council led to the adoption of\nResolution 1574 (L) of 20th May 1971 which was reaffirmed by\nGeneral Assembly Resolution 2857 (XXVI) of 20th December\n1971. This latter resolution clearly affirmed that:\n\n\"In order to guarantee fully the right to life,\nprovided for in\narticle 3\nof the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, the main objective to be pursued is\nthat of progressively restricting the number of\noffences for which capital punishment may be imposed,\nwith a view to the desirability of abolishing this\npunishment in all countries\".\n\n(Emphasais supplied)\nIn 1973 the Secretary General submitted to the Economic\nand Social Council at its 54th session his third report on\ncapital punishment as requested by the Council and at this\nsession, the Council adopted Resolution 1745 (LIV) in which,\ninter alia, it invited the Secretary General to submit to it\nperiodic updated reports on capital punishment at five-year\nintervals starting from 1975. A fourth report on capital\npunishment was accordingly submitted in 1975 and a fifth one\nin 1980. Meanwhile the General Assembly at its 32nd Session\nadopted Resolution 32/61 on 8th December 1977 and this\nResolution re-affirmed \"the desirability of abolishing this\"\n\nthat is capital \"punishment\" in all countries.\nIt will thus be seen that the United Nations has\ngradually shifted from the position of a neutral observer\nconcerned about but not committed on the question of death\npenalty, to a position favouring the eventual abolition of\nthe death penalty. The objective of the United Nations has\nbeen and that is the standard set by the world body that\ncapital punishment should ultimately be abolished in all\ncountries. This normative standard set by the world body\nmust be taken into account in determining whether the death\npenalty can be regarded as arbitrary, excessive and\nunreasonable so as to be constitutionally invalid.\n\nI will now proceed to consider the relevant provisions\nof the Constitution bearing on the question of\nconstitutional validity of death penalty. It may be pointed\nout that our Constitution is a unique document. It is not a\nmere pedantic legal text but it embodies certain human\nvalues cherished principles and spiritual norms and\nrecognises and upholds the dignity of man. It accepts the\nindividual as the focal point of all development and regards\nhis material, moral and spiritual development as the chief\nconcern of its various provisions. It does not treat the\nindividual as a cog in the mighty all-powerful machine of\nthe State but places him at the centre of the constitutional\nscheme and focuses on the fullest development of his\npersonality. The Preamble makes it clear that the\nConstitution is intended to secure to every citizen social,\neconomic and political justice and equality of status and\nopportunity and to promote fraternity assuring the dignity\nof the individual. The Fundamental Rights lay down\nlimitations on the power of the legislature and the\nexecutive with a view to protecting the citizen and confer\ncertain basic human rights which are enforceable against the\nState in a court of law. The Directive Principles of State\nPolicy also emphasise the dignity of the individual and the\nworth of the human person by obligating the State to take\nvarious measures for the purpose of securing and protecting\na social order in which justice social, economic and\npolitical, shall inform all the institutions of national\nlife. What is the concept of social and economic justice\nwhich the founding fathers had in mind is also elaborated in\nthe various Articles setting out the Directive Principles of\nState Policy. But all these provisions enacted for the\npurpose of ensuring the dignity of the individual and\nproviding for his material, moral and spiritual development\nwould be Meaningless and ineffectual unless there is rule of\nlaw to invest them with life and force.\nNow if we look at the various constitutional provisions\nincluding the Chapters on Fundamental Rights and Directive\nPrinciples of State Policy, it is clear that the rule of law\npermeates the entire fabric of the Constitution and indeed\nforms one of its basic features. The rule of law excludes\narbitrariness; its postulate is 'intelligence without\npassion' and 'reason freed from desire'. Wherever we find\narbitrariness or unreasonableness there is denial of the\nrule of law. That is why Aristotle preferred a government of\nlaws rather than of men. 'Law', in the context of the rule\nof law, does not mean any law enacted by the legislative\nauthority, howsoever arbitrary or despotic it may be.\nOtherwise even under a dictatorship it would be possible to\nsay that there is rule of law, because every law made by the\ndictator howsoever arbitrary and unreasonable has to be\nobeyed and every action has to be taken in conformity with\nsuch law. In such a case too even where the political set up\nis dictatorial, it is law that governs the relationship\nbetween men and men and between men and the State. But still\nit is not rule of law as understood in modern jurisprudence,\nbecause in jurisprudential terms, the law itself in such a\ncase being an emanation from the absolute will of the\ndictator it is in effect and substance the rule of man and\nnot of law which prevails in such a situation. What is\nnecessary element of the rule of law is that the law must\nnot be arbitrary or irrational and it must satisfy the test\nof reason and the democratic form of polity seeks to ensure\nthis element by making the framers of the law accountable to\nthe people. Of course, in a country like the United Kingdom,\nwhere there is no written constitution imposing fetters on\nlegislative power and providing for judicial review of\nlegislation, it may be difficult to hold a law to be invalid\non the ground that it is arbitrary and irrational and hence\nviolative of an essential element of the rule of law and the\nonly remedy if at all would be an appeal to the electorate\nat the time when a fresh mandate is sought at the election.\nBut the situation is totally different in a country like\nIndia which has a written Constitution enacting Pundamental\nRights and conferring power on the courts to enforce them\nnot only against the executive but also against the\nlegislature. The Fundamental Rights erect a protective\narmour for the individual against arbitrary or unreasonable\nexecutive or legislative action.\n\nThere are three Fundamental Rights in the Constitution\nwhich are of prime importance and which breathe vitality in\nthe concept\nof the rule of law. They are\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nwhich,\nin the words of Chandrachud, C.J. in Minverva Mills case(1)\nconstitute a golden triangle.\nIt is now settled law as a\nresult of the decision of this Court in\nManeka Gandhi\n's case\n(supra) that\nArticle 14\nenacts primarily a guarantee against\narbitrariness and inhibits State action whether legislative\nor executive, which suffers from the vice of arbitrariness.\n\nThis interpretation placed on\nArticle 14\nby the Court in\nManeka Gandhi's case has opened up a new dimension of that\nArticle which transcends the classificatory principle. For a\nlong time in the evolution of the constitutional law of our\ncountry, the courts had construed\nArticle 14\nto mean only\nthis, namely, that you can classify persons and things for\nthe application of a law but such classification must be\nbased on intelligible differentia having rational\nrelationship to the object sought to be achieved by the law.\nBut the court pointed out in\nManeka Gandhi\n's case that\n\nArticle 14\nwas not to be equated with the principle of\nclassification. It was primarily a guarantee against\narbitrariness in State action and the doctrine of\nclassification was evolved only as a subsidiary rule for\ntesting or determining whether a particular State action was\narbitrary or not. The Court said \"Equality is antithetical\nto arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are\nsworn enemies. One belongs to the rule of law while the\nother to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where\nan act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal\nboth according to political logic and constitutional law and\nis, therefore, violative of\nArticle 14.\"\nThe Court thus laid\ndown that every State action must be non-arbitrary and\nreasonable; if it is not, the court would strike it down as\ninvalid.\n\nThis view was reaffirmed by the Court in another\noutstanding decision in Ramana Dayaram Shetty International\nAirport Authority of India & Ors. There tenders were invited\nby the Airport Authority for giving a contract for running a\ncanteen at the Bombay Airport. The invitation for tender\nincluded a condition that the applicant must have at least 5\nyears' experience as a registered 2nd class hotelier.\nSeveral persons tendered. One was a person who had\nconsiderable experience in the catering business but he was\nnot a registered 2nd class hotelier as required by the\ncondition in the invitation to tender. Yet his tender was\naccepted because it was the highest. The contract given to\nhim was challenged and the court held that the action of the\nAirport Authority was illegal. The court pointed out that a\n______________________\n(1) [1979] 3 SCR 1014.\nnew form of property consisting of government largesse in\nthe shape of jobs, cotracts licences, quotas, mineral rights\nand other benefits and services was emerging in the social\nwelfare State that India was and it was necessary to develop\nnew forms of protection in regard to this new kind of\nproperty.\n\nThe court held that in regard to government largesse,\nthe discretion of the government is not unlimited in that\nthe government cannot give or withhold largesse in its\narbitrary discretion or at its sweet will. The government\naction must be based on standards that are not arbitrary or\nirrational. This requirement was spelt out from the\napplication of\nArticle 14\nas a constitutional requirement,\nand it was held that having regard to the constitutional\nmandate of\nArticle 14\n, the Airport Authority was not\nentitled to act arbitrarily in accepting the tender but was\nbound to conform to the standards or norms\nlaid down by\nit.\nThe Court thus reiterated and reaffirmed its commitment\nagainst arbitrariness in State action.\n\nIt can, therefore, now be taken to be well-settled that\nif a law is arbitrary or irrational, it would fall foul of\n\nArticle 14\nand would be liable to be struck down as invalid.\nNow a law may contravene\nArticle 14\nbecause it enacts\nprovisions which are arbitrary; as for example, they make\ndiscriminatory classification which is not founded on\nintelligible differentia having rational relation to the\nobject sought to be achieved by the law or they arbitrarily\nselect persons or things for discriminatory treatment. But\nthere is also another category of cases where without\nenactment of specific provisions which are arbitrary, a law\nmay still offend\nArticle 14\nbecause it confers discretion on\nan authority to select persons or things for application of\nthe law without laying down any policy or principle to guide\nthe exercise of such discretion. Where such unguided and\nunstructured discretion is conferred on an authority, the\nlaw would be violative of\nArticle 14\nbecause it would enable\nthe authority to exercise such discretion arbitrarily and\nthus discriminate without reason. Unfettered and uncharted\ndiscretion conferred on any authority, even if it be the\njudiciary, throws the door open for arbitrariness, for after\nall a judge does not cease to be a human being subject to\nhuman limitations when he puts on the judicial robe and the\nnature of the judicial process being what it is, it cannot\nbe entirely free from judicial subjectivism. Cardozo, J. has\nfrankly pointed this out in his lectures on \"Nature of the\nJudicial Process\":\n\"There has been a certain lack of candor in much\nof the discussion of the theme, or rather perhaps in\nthe refusal to discuss it, as if judges must lose\nrespect and confidence by the reminder that they are\nsubject to human limitations... if there is anything of\nreality in my analysis of the judicial process, they do\nnot stand aloof on these chill and distant heights; and\nwe shall not help the cause of truth by acting and\nspeaking as if they do. The great tides and currents\nwhich engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their\ncourse and pass the judges by.\n\nThis facet of the judicial process has also been emphasized\nby Richard B. Brandt in his book on \"Judicial Discretion\"\n\nwhere he has said :\n\n\"Much of law is designed to avoid the necessity\nfor the judge to reach what Holmes called his 'can't\nhelps', his ultimate convictions or values. The force\nof precedent, the close applicability of statute law,\nthe separation of powers, legal presumptions, statutes\nof limitations, rules of pleading and evidence, and\nabove all the pragmatic assessments of fact that point\nto one result whichever ultimate values be assumed, all\nenable the judge in most cases to stop short of a\nresort to his personal standards. When these prove\nunavailing, as is more likely in the case of courts of\nlast resort at the frontiers of the law, and most\nlikely in a supreme constitutional court, the judge\nnecessarily resorts to his own scheme of values. It\nmay, therefore, be said that the most important thing\nabout a judge is his philosophy; and if it be dangerous\nfor him to have one, it is at all events less dangerous\nthan the self-deception of having none.\n\nThat is why Lord Camden described the discretion of a judge\nto be \"the law of tyrants; it is always unknown; it is\ndifferent in different men; it is casual and depends on\nConstitution,Tamper, and Passion. In the best it is often\ntimes Caprice, in the worst it is every Vice, Folly and\nPassion to which human Nature is liable.\" Doe d. Hindson v.\nKersey (1765) at p. 53 of the pamphlet published in London\nby J. Wilkes in 1971 entitled \"Lord Camden's Genuine\nArgument in giving Judgment on the Ejectment between\nHindson, and others against Kersey\". Megarry J. also points\nout in his delightful book \"Miscellany at Law\" that\n\"discretion is indeed a poor substitute for\nprinciples, however, great the Judge\". Therefore, where\ndiscretion is conferred on an authority by a statute, the\ncourt always strains to find in the statute the policy or\nprinciple laid down by the legislature for the purpose of\nguiding the exercise of such discretion and, as pointed out\nby Subba Rao, J. as he then was, the court sometimes even\ntries to discover the policy or principle in the crevices of\nthe statute in order to save the law from the challenge of\n\nArticle 14\nwhich would inevitably result in striking down of\nthe law if the discretion conferred were unguided and\nunfettered. But where after the utmost effort and intense\nsearch, no policy or principle to guide the exercise of\ndiscretion can be found, the discretion conferred by the law\nwould be unguided and unstructured, like a tumultuous river\noverflowing its banks and that would render the law open to\nattack on ground of arbitrariness under\nArticle 14.\n\nSo also\nArticle 19\nstrikes against arbitrary\nlegislation in so far as such legislation is violative of\none or the other provision of clause (1) of that Article.\nSub-clauses (a) to (g) of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nenact\nvarious Fundamental freedoms; sub-clause (1) guarantees\nfreedom of speech and expression, sub-clause (b), freedom to\nassemble peacefully and without arms; sub-clause (c),\nfreedom to form associations or unions; sub-clause (d),\nfreedom to move freely throughout the territory of India;\nsub-clause (e) to reside and settle in any part of the\nterritory of India and sub-clause (g), freedom to practise\nany profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or\nbusiness. There was originally sub-clause (f) in clause (1)\nof\nArticle 19\nwhich guaranteed freedom to acquire, hold and\ndispose of property but that sub-clause was deleted by the\n\nConstitution (Forty Fourth Amendment) Act\n1978. Now the\nfreedoms guaranteed under these various sub-clauses of\nclause (1) of\nArticle 19\nare not absolute freedoms but they\ncan be restricted by law, provided such law satisfies the\nrequirement of the applicable provision in one or the other\nof clauses (2) to (6) of that Article. The common basic\nrequirement of the saving provision enacted in clauses (2)\nto (6) of\nArticle 19\nis that the restriction imposed by the\nlaw must be reasonable. If, therefore, any law is enacted by\nthe legislature which violates one or the other provision of\nclauses (1) of\nArticle 19\n, it would not be protected by the\nsaving provision enacted in clauses (2) to (6) of that\nArticle, if it is arbitrary or irrational, because in that\nevent the restriction imposed by it would a fortiorari be\nunreasonable.\nThe third Fundamental Right which strikes against\narbitrariness in State action is that embodied in Article\n\n21. This Article is worded in simple language and it\nguarantees the right to life and personal liberty in the\nfollowing terms.\n\n\"21. No person shall be deprived of his life or\npersonal liberty except according to procedure\nestablished by law.\"\n\nThis Article also came up for interpretation in\nManeka\nGandhi\n's case (supra). Two questions arose before the Court\n\nin that case\n: one was as to what is the content of the\nexpression \"personal liberty\" and the other was as to what\nis the meaning of the expression \"except according to\nprocedure established by law\". We are not concerned here\nwith the first question and hence I shall not dwell upon it.\nBut so far as second question is concerned, it provoked a\ndecision from the Court which was to mark the beginning of\namost astonishing development of the law. It is with this\ndecision that the Court burst forth into un-precedented\ncreative activity and gave to the law a new dimenston and a\nnew vitality. Until this decision was given, the view held\nby this Court was that\nArticle 21\nmerely embodied a facet of\nthe Diceyian concept of the rule of law that no one can be\ndeprived of his personal liberty by executive action\nunsupported by law. It was intended to be no more than a\nprotection against executive action which had no authority\nof law. If there was a law which provided some sort of\nprocedure, it was, enough to deprive a person of his life or\npersonal liberty.\n\nEven if, to take an example cited by S.R.\nDas, J, in his Judgment in\nA.K. Gopalan v. State of\nMadras\n(1) the law provided that the Bishop of Rochester be\nboiled in old, it would be valid under\nArticle 21.\nBut in\nManeka Gandhi's case (supra) which marks a watershed in the\nhistory of development of constitutional law in our country,\nthis Court for the first time took the view that\nArticle 21\n\naffords protection not only against executive action but\nalso against legislation and any law which deprives a person\nof his life or personal liberty would be invalid unless it\nprescribes a procedure for such deprivation which is\nreasonable fair and just. The concept of reasonableness, it\nwas held, runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution\nand it is not enough for the law merely to provide some\nsemblance of a procedure but the procedure for depriving a\n___________\n(1) [1950] SCR 88.\nperson of his life or personal liberty must be rasonable,\nfair and just. It is for the court to determine whether in a\nparticular case the procedure is reasonable, fair and just\nand if it is not, the court will strike down the law as\ninvalid. If therefore a law is enacted by the legislature\nwhich deprives a person of the life-and 'life' according to\nthe decision of this Court in\nFrancis Coralie Mullen's v.\nAdministrator, Union Territory of Delhi and Ors.\n,(1) would\ninclude not merely physical existence but also the use of\nany faculty or limb as also the right to live with human\ndignity-or any aspect of his personal liberty, it would\noffend against\nArticle 21\nif the procedure prescribed for\nsuch deprivation is arbitrary and unreasonable. The word\n'procedure' in\nArticle 21\nis wide enough to cover the entire\nprocess by which deprivation is effected and that would\ninclude not only the adjectival but also the substantive\npart of the law. Take for example, a law of preventive\ndetention which sets out the grounds on which a person may\nbe preventively detained. If a person is preventively\ndetained on a ground other than those set out in the law,\nthe preventive detention would obviously not be according to\nthe procedure prescribed by the law, because the procedure\nset out in the law for preventively detaining a person\nprescribes certain specific grounds on which alone a person\ncan be preventively detained, and if he is detained on any\nother ground, it would be violative of\nArticle 21.\nEvery\nfacet of the law which deprives a person of his life or\npersonal liberty would therefore have to stand the test of\nreasonableness, fairness and justness in order to be outside\nthe inhibition of\nArticle 21.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the rule of law has much\ngreater vitality under our Constitution that it has in other\ncountries like the United Kingdom which has no\nconstitutionally enacted Fundamental Rights. The rule of law\nhas really three basic and fundamental assumptions one is\nthat law making must be essentially in the hands of a\ndemocratically elected legislature, subject of course to any\npower in the executive in an emergent situation to\npromulgate ordinances effective for a short duration while\nthe legislature is not in session as also to enact delegated\nlegislation in accordance with the guidelines\nlaid down by\n\nthe legislature; the other is that, even in the hands of a\ndemocratically elected legislature, there should not be\nunfettered legislative power, for, as Jefferson said: \"Let\nno man be trusted with power but tie him down from making\nmischief by the\n_____________________\n(1) [1981] 2 SCR 516.\nchains of the Constitution\"; and lastly there must be an\nindependent judicially to protect the citizen against\nexcesses of executive and legislative power. Fortunately,\nwhatever uncharitable and irresponsible critics might say\nwhen they find a decision of the court going against the\nview held by them, we can confidently assert that we have in\nour country all these three elements essential to the rule\nof law. It is plain and indisputable that under our\nConstitution law cannot be arbitrary or irrational and if it\nis, it would be clearly invalid, whether under\nArticle 14\nor\n\nArticle 19\nor\nArticle 21\nwhichever be applicable.\n\nIt is in the light of these constitutional provisions\nthat I must consider whether death penalty provided under\n\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code read with section 354\nsub-section (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nis\nconstitutionally valid. Now one thing is certain that the\nConstitution does not in so many terms prohibit capital\npanishment. In fact, it recognises death sentence as one of\nthe penalties which may be imposed by law.\nArticle 21\n\nprovides inter alia that no one shall be deprived of his\nlife except according to procedure established by law and\nthis clearly postulates that a person may be deprived of his\nlife in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law or\nin other words, law may provide a procedure, which of course\naccording to the decision of this Court in Maneka Gandhi's\ncase (supra) must be reasonable, fair and just procedure,\nfor inflicting death penalty on a person depriving him of\nhis life. Clause(c) of\nArticle 72\nalso recognises the\npossibility of a sentence of death being imposed on a person\nconvicted of an offence inasmuch as it provides that the\nPresident shall have the power to suspend, remit or commute\nthe sentence of any person who is convicted of an offence\nand sentenced to death. It is therefore not possible to\ncontend that the imposition of death sentence for conviction\nof an offence is in all cases forbidden by the Constitution.\nBut that does not mean that the infliction of death penalty\nis blessed by the Constitution or that it has the imprimatur\nor seal of approval of the Constitution. The Constitution is\nnot a transient document but it is meant to endure for a\nlong time to come and during its life, situations may arise\nwhere death penalty may be found to serve a social purpose\nand its prescription may not be liable to be regarded as\narbitrary or unreasonable and therefore to meet such\nsituations, the Constitution had to make a provision and\nthis it did in\nArticle 21\nand clause (c) of\nArticle 72\nso\nthat, even where death penalty is prescribed by any\nlaw and it is otherwise not unconstitutional, it must still\ncomply with the requirement of\nArticle 21\nand it would be\nsubject to the clemency power of the President under clause\n\n(c) of\nArticle 72.\nThe question would however still remain\nwhether the prescription of death penalty by any particular\nlaw is violative of any provision of the Constitution and is\ntherefore rendered unconstitutional. This question has to be\nanswered in the present case with reference to\nsection 302\n\nof the Indian Penal Code read with section 354 sub-section\n(3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n.\n\nNow in order to answer this question it is necessary\nfirst of all to examine the legislative trend in our country\nso far as the imposition of death penalty is concerned. A\n\"brief survey of the trend of legislative endeavours\" will,\nas pointed out by Krishna Iyer, J. in\nRajendra Prasad v.\nState of U.P.\n(1) \"serve to indicate whether the people's\nconsciousness has been protected towards narrowing or\nwidening the scope for infliction of death penalty.\" If we\nlook at the legislative history of the relevant provisions\nof the\nIndian Penal Code\nand the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n\nwe find that in our country there has been a gradual shift\nagainst the imposition of death penalty. \"The legislative\ndevelopment, through several successive amendments had\nshifted the punitive centre of gravity from life taking to\nlife sentence.\" Sub-section (5) of\nsection 367\nof the Code\nof Criminal Procedure 1898 as it stood prior to its\namendment by Act 26 of 1955 provided :\n\n\"If the accused is convicted of an offence\npunishable with death, and the court sentences to any\npunishment other than death, the court shall in its\njudgment state the reasons why sentence of death was\nnot passed.\"\n\nThis provision laid down that if an accused was convicted of\nan offence punishable with death, the imposition of death\nsentence was the rule and the awarding of a lesser sentence\nwas an exception and the court had to state the reasons for\nnot passing the sentence of death. In other words, the\ndiscretion was directed positively towards death penalty.\nBut, by the\nAmending Act\n26 of 1955 which came into force\nwith effect from 1st January 1956, this provision was\ndeleted with the result that from and after that date, it\nwas left to the discretion of the court on the facts of each\ncase to pass a sen-\n\n__________________\n(1) [1979] 3 SCC 646.\ntence of death or to award a lesser sentence. Where the\ncourt found in a given case that, on the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, the death sentence was not called\nfor or there were extenuating circumstances to justify the\npassing of the lesser sentence, the court would award the\nlesser sentence and not impose the death penalty. Neither\ndeath penalty nor life sentence was the rule under the law\nas it stood after the abolition of sub-section (5) of the\nsection 367 by the\nAmending Act\n26 of 1955 and the court was\nleft \"equally free to award either sentence\". But then\nagain, there was a further shift against death penalty by\nreason of the abolitionist pressure and when the new\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n1973 was enacted, section 354 sub-section\n(3) provided ;\n\n\"When the conviction is for a sentence punishable\nwith death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment\nfor life or imprisonment for a term of years, the\njudgment shall state the reasons for the sentence\nawarded and, in the case of sentence of death, special\nreasons for such sentence.\"\n\nThe court is now required under this provision to state the\nreasons for the sentence awarded and in case of sentence of\ndeath, special reasons are required to be stated. It will\nthus be seen that life sentence is now the rule and it is\nonly in exceptional cases, for special reasons, that death\nsentence can be imposed. The legislature has however not\nindicated what are the special reasons for which departure\ncan be made from the normal rule and death penalty may be\ninflicted. The legislature has not given any guidance as to\nwhat are those exceptional cases in which, deviating from\nthe normal rule, death sentence may be imposed. This is left\nentirely to the unguided discretion of the court, a feature,\nwhich, in my opinion, has lethal consequences so far as the\nconstitutionality of death penalty is concerned. But one\nthing is clear that through these legislative changes \"the\ndisturbed conscience of the State on the question of legal\nthreat to life by way of death sentence has sought to\nexpress itself legislatively\", the stream of tendency being\ntowards cautions abolition.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that a further\nlegislative attempt towards restricting and rationalising\ndeath penalty was made in the late seventies. A Bill called\n\nIndian Penal Code\n(Amendment) Bill 1972 for amending section\n302 was passed by the Rajya Sabha in 1978 and it was pending\nin the Lok Sabha at the time when\nRajendra\nPrasad\n's case was decided and though it ultimately lapsed\nwith the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, it shows how strongly\nwere the minds of the elected representatives of the people\nagitated against \"homicidal exercise of discretion\" which is\noften an \"obsession with retributive justice in disguise\".\nThis Bill sought to narrow drastically the judicial\ndiscretion to impose death penalty and tried to formulate\nthe guidelines which should control the exercise of judicial\nexercise in this punitive area. But unfortunately the Bill\nthough passed by the Rajya Sabha could not see its way\nthrough the Lok Sabha and was not enacted into law.\nOtherwise perhaps the charge against the present section of\n302 of the\nIndian Penal Code\nread with section 354 sub-\nsection (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nthat it does\nnot indicate any policy or principle to guide the exercise\nof judicial discretion in awarding death penalty, would have\nbeen considerably diluted, though even then, I doubt very\nmuch whether that section could have survived the attack\nagainst its constitutionally on the ground that it still\nleaves the door open for arbitrary exercise of discretion in\nimposing death penalty.\n\nHaving traced the legislative history of the relevant\nprovisions in regard to death penalty, I will now turn my\nattention to what great and eminent men have said in regard\nto death penalty, for their words serve to bring out in bold\nrelief the utter barbarity and futility of the death\npenalty. Jaiprakash Narain, the great humanist, said, while\nspeaking on abolition of death penalty ;\n\n\"To my mind, it is ultimately a question of\nrespect for life and human approach to those who commit\ngrievous hurts to others. Death sentence is no remedy\nfor such crimes. A more humane and constructive remedy\nis to remove the culprit concerned from the normal\nmilieu and treat him as a mental case. I am sure a\nlarge proportion of the murderers could be weaned away\nfrom their path and their mental condition sufficiently\nimproved to become useful citizens. In a minority of\ncases, this may not be possible. They may be kept in\nprison houses till they die a natural death. This may\ncast a heavier economic burden on society than hanging.\nBut I have no doubt that a humane treatment even of a\nmurderer will enhance man's dignity and make society\nmore human.\n\n(emphasis added)\nAndrei Sakharov in a message to the Stockholm Conference on\nAbolition of death Penalty organised by Amnesty\nInternational in 1978 expressed himself firmly against death\npenalty:\n\n\"I regard the death penalty as a savage and\nimmoral institution which undermines the moral and\nlegal foundations of a society. A state, in the person\nof its functionaries who like all people are inclined\nto making superficial conclusions, who like all people\nare subject to influence, connections, prejudices and\negocentric motivations for their behaviour, takes upon\nitself the right to the most terrible and irreversible\nact-the deprivation of life. Such a State cannot expect\nan improvement of the moral atmosphere in its country.\nI reject the notion that the death penalty has any\nessential deterrent effect on potential offenders. I am\nconvinced that the contrary is true-that savagery\nbegets only savagery...I am convinced that society as a\nwhole and each of its members individually, not just\nthe person who comes before the courts, bears a\nresponsibility for the occurrence of a crime. I believe\nthat the death penalty has no moral or practical\njustification and represents a survival of barbaric\ncustoms of revenge. Blood thirsty and calculated\nrevenge with no temporary insanity on the part of the\njudges, and therefore, shameful and disgusting.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\nTolstoy also protested against death sentence in an article\n\"I Cannot be Silent\":\n\n\"Twelve of those by whose labour we live, the very\nmen whom we have depraved and are still depraving by\nevery means in our power-from the poison of vodka to\nthe terrible falsehood of a creed we impose on them\nwith all our might, but do not ourselves believe in-\ntwelve of those men strangled with cords by those whom\nwe feed and clothe and house, and who have depraved and\nstill continue to deprave them. Twelve husbands,\nfathers, and sons, from among those upon whose\nkindness, industry and simplicity alone rests the whole\nof Russian life, are seized, imprisoned, and shackled.\nThen their hands are tied\nbehind their backs lest they should seize the ropes by\nwhich they are to be hung, and they are led to the\ngallows.\"\n\nSo also said Victor Hugo in the spirit of the Bishop created\nby him in his 'Les Miserables' :\n\n\"We shall look upon crime as a disease. Evil will\nbe treated in charity instead of anger. The change will\nbe simple and sublime. The cross shall displace the\nscaffold, reason is on our side, feeling is on our\nside, and experience is on our side.\"\n\nMahatma Gandhi also wrote to the same effect in his simple\nbut inimitable style :\n\n\"Destruction of individuals can never be a\nvirtuous act. The evil doers cannot be done to death.\nToday there is a movement afoot for the abolition of\ncapital punishment and attempts are being made to\nconvert prisons into hospitals as if they are persons\nsuffering from a disease.\"\n\nThis Gandhian concept was translated into action with\ncommendable success in the case of Chambal dacoits who laid\ndown their arms in response to the call of Vinobha Bhave and\nJaiprakash Narayan. See \"Crime and Non-violence\" by Vasant\nNargolkar. There is also the recent instance of surrender of\nMalkhan Singh, a notorious dacoit of Madhya Pradesh. Have\nthese dacoits not been reformed ? Have they not been\nredeemed and saved ? What social purpose would have been\nserved by killing them ?\n\nI may also at this stage make a few observations in\nregard to the barbarity and cruelty of death penalty, for\nthe problem of constitutional validity of death penalty\ncannot be appreciated in its proper perspective without an\nadequate understanding of the true nature of death penalty\nand what it involves in terms of human anguish and\nsuffering. In the first place, death penalty is irrevocable;\nit cannot be recalled. It extinguishes the flame of life for\never and is plainly destructive of the right to life, the\nmost precious right of all, a right without which enjoyment\nof no other rights is possible. It silences for ever a\nliving being and despatches him to that 'undiscovered\ncountry from whose bourn no traveller returns' nor,\nonce executed, 'can stored urn or animated bust back to its\nmansion call the fleeting breath'. It is by reason of its\ncold and cruel finality that death penalty is qualitatively\ndifferent from all other forms of punishment. If a person is\nsentenced to imprisonment, even if it be for life, and\nsubsequently it is found that he was innocent and was\nwrongly convicted, he can be set free. Of course the\nimprisonment that he has suffered till then cannot be undone\nand the time he has spent in the prison cannot be given back\nto him in specie but he can come back and be restored to\nnormal life with his honour vindicated if he is found\ninnocent. But that is not possible where a person has been\nwrongly convited and sentencted to death and put out of\nexistence in pursuance of the sentence of death. In his\ncase, even if any mistake is subsequently discovered, it\nwill be too late; in every way and for every purpose it will\nbe too late, for he cannot be brought back to life. The\nexecution of the sentence of death in such a case makes\nmiscarriage of justice irrevocable. On whose conscience will\nthis death of an innocent man lie ? The State through its\njudicial instrumentality would have killed an innocent man.\nHow is it different from a private murder ? That is why\nLafayatte said : \"I shall ask for the abolition of the\npenalty of death until I have the infallibility of human\njudgment demonstrated me.\"\n\nIt is argued on behalf of the retentionists that having\nregard to the elaborate procedural safeguards enacted by the\nlaw in cases involving capital punishment, the possibility\nof mistake is more imaginary than real and these procedural\nsafeguards virtually make conviction of an innocent person\nimpossible. But I do not think this argument is well\nfounded. It is not supported by factual data. Hugo Bedau in\nhis well known book, \"The Death Penalty in America\" has\nindividually documented seventy four cases since 1893 in\nwhich it has been responsibly charged and in most of them\nproved beyond doubt, that persons were wrongly convicted of\ncriminal homicide in America. Eight out of these seventy\nfour, though innocent, were executed. Redin, Gardener, Frank\nand others have specifically identified many more additional\ncases. These are cases in which it has been possible to show\nfrom discovery of subsequent facts that the convictions were\nerroneous and innocent persons were put to death, but there\nmay be many more cases where by reason of the difficulty of\nuncovering the facts after conviction, let alone after\nexecution, it may not be possible to establish that there\nwas miscarriage of justice. The jurist Olivecroix, applying\na calculus of probabilities to the chance of judicial error,\nconcluded as far back\nas in 1860 that approximately one innocent man was condemned\nout of every 257 cases. The proportion seems low but only in\nrelation to moderate punishment. In relation to capital\npunishment, the proportion is infinitivelly high. When Hugo\nwrote that he preferred to call the guillotine Lesurques\n(the name of an innocent man guillotined in the Carrier de\nLyon case) he did not mean that every man who was\ndecapitated was a Lesurques, but that one Lesurques was\nenough to wipe out the value of capital punishment for ever.\nIt is interesting to note that where cases of wrongful\nexecution have come to public attention, they have been a\nmajor force responsible for bringing about abolition of\ndeath penalty. The Evans case in England in which an\ninnocent man was hanged in 1949 played a large role in the\nabolition of capital punishment in that country. Belgium\nalso abjured capital punishment on account of one such\njudicial error and so did Wisconsin, Rhode Island and Maine\nin the United States of America.\n\nHowsoever careful may be the procedural safeguards\nerected by the law before death penalty can be imposed, it\nis impossible to eliminate the chance of judicial error. No\npossible judicial safeguards can prevent conviction of the\ninnocent. Students of the criminal process have identified\nseveral reasons why innocent men may be convicted of crime.\nIn the first place, our methods of investigation are crude\nand archaic. We are, by and large, ignorant of modern\nmethods of investigation based on scientific and\ntechnological advances. Our convictions are based largely on\noral evidence of witnesses. Often, witnesses perjure\nthemselves as they are motivated by caste, communal and\nfactional considerations. Some times they are even got up by\nthe police to prove what the police believes to be a true\ncase. Sometimes there is also mistaken eye witness\nidentification and this evidence is almost always difficult\nto shake in cross-examination. Then there is also the\npossibility of a frame up of innocent men by their enemies.\nThere are also cases where an over zealous prosecutor may\nfail to disclose evidence of innocence known to him but not\nknown to the defence. The possibility of error in judgment\ncannot therefore be ruled out on any theoretical\nconsiderations. It is indeed a very live possibility and it\nis not at all unlikely that so long as death penalty remains\na constitutionally valid alternative, the court or the State\nacting through the instrumentality of the court may have on\nits conscience the blood of an innocent man.\nThen again it is sometimes argued that, on this\nreasoning, every criminal trial must necessarily raise the\npossibility of wrongful conviction and if that be so, are we\ngoing to invalidate every form of punishment ? But this\nargument, I am afraid, is an argument of despair. There is a\nqualitative difference between death penalty and other forms\nof punishment. I have already pointed out that the former\nextinguishes the flame of life altogether and is irrevocable\nand beyond recall while the latter can, at least to some\nextent be set right, if found mistaken. This vital\ndifference between death penalty and imprisonment was\nemphasized by Mahatma Gandhi when he said in reply to a\nGerman writer :\n\n\"I would draw distinction between killing and\ndetention and even corporal punishment. I think\nthere is a difference not merely in quantity but\nalso in quality. I can recall the punishment of\ndetention. I can make reparation to the man upon\nwhom I inflict corporal punishment. But once a man\nis killed, the punishment is beyond recall or\nreparation.\"\n\nThe same point was made by the distinguished criminologist\nLeon Radzinowicz when he said : \"The likelihood of error in\na capital sentence case stands on a different footing\naltogether.\" Judicial error in imposition of death penalty\nwould indeed be a crime beyond punishment. This is the\ndrastic nature of death penalty, terrifying in its\nconsequences, which has to be taken into account in\ndetermining in constitutional validity.\n\nIt is also necessary to point out that death penalty is\nbarbaric and inhuman in its effect, mental and physical upon\nthe condemned man and is positively cruel. Its psychological\neffect on the prisoner in the Death Row is disastrous. One\nPsychiatrist has described Death Row as a \"grisly\nlaboratory\" \"the ultimate experiment alstress in which the\ncondemned prisoner's personality is incredibly brutalised.\"\nHe points out that \"the strain of existence on Death Row is\nvery likely to produce....... acute psychotic breaks.\" Vide\nthe article of \"West on Medicine and Capital Punishment.\"\nSome inmates are driven to ravings or delusions but the\nmajority sink into a sort of catatonic numbness under the\nover-whelming stress.\" Vide \"The Case against Capital\nPunishment\" by the Washington Research Project. Intense\nmental suffering is inevitably associated with confinement\nunder sentence of death. Anticipation of approaching\ndeath can and does produce stark terror. Vide article on\n\"Mental Suffering under Sentence of Death\". 57 Iowa Law\nReview 814. Justice Brennan in his opinion in Furman v.\nGeorgia(1) gave it as a reason for holding the capital\npunishment to be unconstitutional that mental pain is an\ninseparable part of our practice of punishing criminals by\ndeath, for the prospect of pending execution exacts a\nfrightful toll during the inevitable long wait between the\nimposition of sentence and the actual infliction of death.\"\n\nKrishna Iyer, J. also pointed out in\nRajendra Prasad\n's case\n(supra) that because the condemned prisoner had \"the hanging\nagony hanging over his head since 1973 (i.e. for six\nyears)...\"he must by now be more a vegetable than a person.\"\nHe added that \"the excruciation of long pendency of the\ndeath sentence with the prisoner languishing near-solitary\nsuffering all the time, may make the death sentence\nunconstitutionally cruel and agonising.\" The California\nSupreme Court also, in finding the death penalty per se\nunconstitutional remarked with a sense of poignancy :\n\n\"The cruelty of capital punishment lies not only\nin the execution itself and the pain incident thereto,\nbut also in the dehumanising effects of the lengthy\nimprisonment prior to execution during which the\njudicial and administrative procedures essential to due\nprocess of law are carried out. Penologists and medical\nexperts agree that the process of carrying out a\nverdict of death is often so degrading and brutalizing\nto the human spirit as to constitute psychological\ntorture.\"\n\nIn Re Kemmler(2) the Supreme Court of the United States\naccepted that \"punishments are cruel when they involve a\nlingering death, something more than the mere extinguishment\nof life.\" Now a death would be as lingering if a man spends\nseveral years in a death cell avaiting execution as it would\nbe if the method of execution takes an unacceptably long\ntime to kill the victim. The pain of mental lingering can be\nas intense as the agony of physical lingering. See David\nPannick on \"Judicial Review of the Death Penalty.\" Justice\nMiller also pointed out in Re Medley(3) that \"when a\nprisoner sentenced by a court to death is confined to the\n______________\n(1) 408 US 238.\n\n(2) 136 US 436.\n\n(3) 134 US 160.\npenitentiary awaiting the execution of the sentence, one of\nthe most horrible feelings to which he can be subjected\nduring that time is the uncertainty during the whole of\nit..... as to the precise time when his execution shall take\nplace.\" We acknowledged that such uncertainty is inevitably\n'accompanied by an immense mental anxiety amounting to a\ngreat increase of the offender's punishment.'\nBut quite apart from this excruciating mental anguish\nand severe psychological strain which the condemned prisoner\nhas to undergo on account of the long wait from the date\nwhen the sentence of death is initially passed by the\nsessions court until it is confirmed by the High Court and\nthen the appeal against the death sentence is disposed of by\nthe Supreme Court and if the appeal is dismissed, then until\nthe clemency petition is considered by the Pesident and if\nit is turned down, then until the time appointed for actual\nexecution of the sentence of death arrives, the worst time\nfor most of the condemned prisoners would be the last few\nhours when all certainty is gone and the moment of death is\nknown. Dostoyevsky who actually faced a firing squad only to\nbe reprieved at the last instant, described this experience\nin the following words :\n\n\"...the chief and the worst pain is perhaps not\ninflicted by wounds, but by your certain knowledge that\nin an hour, in ten minutes, in half a minute, now this\nmoment your soul will fly out of your body, and that\nyou will be a human being no longer, and that that's\ncertain-the main thing is that it is certain ..Take a\nsoldier and put him in front of a cannon in battle and\nfire at him and he will still hope, but read the same\nsoldier his death sentence for certain, and he will go\nmad or burst out crying. Who says that human nature is\ncapable of bearing this without madness ? Why this\ncruel, hideous, unnecessary and useless mockery ?\nPossibly there are men who have sentences of death read\nout to them and have been given time to go through this\ntorture, and have then been told, You can go now,\nyou've been reprieved. Such men could perhaps tell us.\nIt was of agony like this and of such horror that\nChrist spoke. No you can't treat a man like that.\"\nWe have also accounts of execution of several prisoners in\nthe United States which show how in these last moment\ncondemned prisoners often simply disintegrate. Canns has in\nfrank and brutal language bared the terrible psychological\ncruelty of capital punishment :\n\n\"Execution is not simply death. It is just as\ndifferent in essence, from the privation of life as a\nconcentration camp is from prison..... It adds to death\na rule, a public premeditation known to the future\nvictim, an organisation, in short, which is in itself a\nsource of moral sufferings more terrible than death...\nFor there to be equivalence, the death penalty would\nhave to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of\nthe date at which he would inflict a horrible death on\nhim and who, from that moment onward, had confined him\nat his mercy for months. Such a monster is not\nencountered in private life.\"\n\nThere can be no stronger words to describe the utter\ndepravity and inhumanity of death sentence.\n\nThe physical pain and suffering which the execution of\nthe sentence of death involves is also no less cruel and\ninhuman. In India, the method of execution followed is\nhanging by the rope. Electrocution or application of lethal\ngas has not yet taken its place as in some of the western\ncountries. It is therefore with reference to execution by\nhanging that I must consider whether the sentence of death\nis barbaric and inhuman as entailing physical pain and\nagony. It is no doubt true that the Royal Commission on\nCapital Punishment 1949-53 found that hanging is the most\nhumane method of execution and so also in Ichikawa v.\nJapan,(1) the Japanese Supreme Court held that execution by\nhanging does not corrospond to 'cruel punishment' inhibited\nby\nArticle 36\nof the Japanese Constituion. But whether\namongst all the methods of execution, hanging is the most\nhumane or in the view of the Japanese Supreme Court, hanging\nis not cruel punishment within the meaning of\nArticle 36\n,\none thing is clear that hanging is undoubtedly accompanied\nby intense physical torture and pain. Warden Duffy of San\nQuentin, a high security\n__________\n(1) Vide : David Pannick on \"Judicial Review of Death\nPenalty, page 73,\nprison in the United States of America, describes the\nhanging process with brutal frankness in lurid details :\n\n\"The day before an execution the prisoner goes\nthrough a harrowing experience of being weighed,\nmeasured for length of drop to assure breaking of the\nneck, the size of the neck, body measurement et cetera.\nWhen the trap springs he dangles at the end of the\nrope. There are times when the neck has not been broken\nand the prisoner strangles to death. His eyes pop\nalmost out of his head, his tongue swells and protrudes\nfrom his mouth, his neck may be broken, and the rope\nmany times takes large portions of skin and flesh from\nthe side of the face and that the noose is on. He\nurinates, he defecates, and droppings fall to the floor\nwhile witnesses look on, and at almost all executions\none or more faint or have to be helped out of the\nwitness room. The prisoner remains dangling from the\nend of the rope for from 8 to 14 minutes before the\ndoctor, who has climbed up a small ladder and listens\nto his heart beat with a stethoscope, pronounces him\ndead. A prison guard stands at the feet of the hanged\nperson and holds the body steady, because during the\nfirst few minutes there is usually considerables\nstruggling in an effort to breathe.\"\n\nIf the drop is too short, there will be a slow and agonising\ndeath by strangulation. On the other hand, if the drop is\ntoo long, the head will be torn off. In England centuries of\npractice have produced a detailed chart relating a man's\nweight and physical condition to the proper length of drop,\nbut even there mistakes have been made. In 1927, a surgeon\nwho witnessed a double execution wrote :\n\n\"The bodies were cut down after fifteen minutes\nand placed in an antechamber, when I was horrified to\nhear one of the supposed corpses give a gasp and find\nhim making respiratory efforts, evidently a prelude to\nrevival. The two bodies were quickly suspended again\nfor a quarter of an hour longer...Dislocation of the\nneck is the ideal aimed at, but, out of all my post-\nmortem findings, that has proved rather an exception,\nwhich in the majority of\ninstances the cause of death was strangulation and\nasphyxin.\"\n\nThese passages clearly establish beyond doubt that the\nexecution of sentence of death by hanging does involve\nintense physical pain and suffering, though it may be\nregarded by some as more humane than electrocution or\napplication of lethal gas.\n\nIf this be the true mental and physical effect of death\nsentence on the condemned prisoner and if it causes such\nmental anguish, psychological strain and physical agony and\nsuffering, it is difficult to see how it can be regarded as\nanything but cruel and inhuman. The only answer which can be\ngiven for justifying this infliction of mental and physical\npain and suffering is that the condemned prisoner having\nkilled a human being does not merit any sympathy and must\nsuffer this punishment because he 'deserves' it. No mercy\ncan be shown to one who did not show any mercy to others.\nBut, as I shall presently point out, this justificatory\nreason cannot commend itself to any civilised society\nbecause it is based on the theory of retribution or\nretaliation and at the bottom of it lies the desire of the\nsociety to avenge itself against the wrong doer. That is not\na permissible penological goal.\n\nIt is in the context of this background that the\nquestion has to be considered whether death penalty provided\nunder\nsection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code read with section\n354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nis\narbitrary and irrational for if it is, it would be clearly\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\nI am leaving aside for the\nmoment challenge to death penalty under Article 19 and\nconfining myself only to the challenge under Article 14 and\n\n21. So far as this challenge is concerned the learned\ncounsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner contended that\nthe imposition of death penalty under\nsection 302\nof the\nIndian Penal Code read with section 354 sub-section (3) of\nthe\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nwas arbitrary and\nunreasonable, firstly because it was cruel and inhuman,\ndisproportionate and excessive, secondly because it was\ntotally unnecessary and did not serve any social purpose or\nadvance any constitutional value and lastly because the\ndiscretion conferred on the court to award death penalty was\nnot guided by any policy or principle laid down by the\nlegislature but was wholly arbitrary. The Union of India as\nalso the States supporting it sought to counter this argu-\nment of the petitioners by submitting first that death\npenalty is neither cruel nor inhuman, neither\ndisproportionate nor excessive, secondly, that it does serve\na social purpose inasmuch as it fulfils two penological\ngoals namely, denunciation by the community and deterrence\nand lastly, that the judicial discretion in awarding death\npenalty is not arbitrary and the court can always evolve\nstandards or norms for the purpose of guiding the exercise\nof its discretion in this punitive area. These were broadly\nthe rival contentions urged on behalf of the parties and I\nshall now proceed to examine them in the light of the\nobservations made in the preceding paragraphs.\n\nThe first question that arises for consideration on\nthese contentions is-and that is a vital question which may\nwell determine the fate of this challenge to the\nconstitutional validity of death penalty-on whom does the\nburden of proof lie in a case like this ? Does it lie on the\npetitioners to show that death penalty is arbitrary and\nunreasonable on the various grounds urged by them or does it\nrest on the State to show that death penalty is not\narbitrary or unreasonable and serves a legitimate social\npurpose. This question was debated before us at great length\nand various decisions were cited supporting one view or the\nother. The earliest decision relied on was that of\nSaghir\nAhmed v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n(1) where it was held by this\nCourt that if the petitioner succeeds in showing that the\nimpugned law ex facie abridges or transgresses the rights\ncoming under any of the sub-clauses of clause (1) of\nArticle\n, the onus shifts on the respondent State to show that the\nlegislation comes within the permissible limits authorised\nby any of clauses (2) to (6) as may be applicable to the\ncase, and also to place material before the court in support\nof that contention. If the State fails to discharge this\nburden, there is no obligation on the petitioner to prove\nnegatively that the impugned law is not covered by any of\nthe permissive clauses.\n\nThis view as to the onus of proof\nwas reiterated by this Court in\nKhyerbari Tea Company v.\nState of Assam\n(2).\n\nBut contended the respondents, a contrary\ntrend was noticeable in some of the subsequent decisions of\nthis Court and the respondents relied principally on the\ndecision in\nB. Banerjee v. Anita Pan\n(3) where Krishna Iyer,\nJ. speaking on behalf of himself and Beg, J. as he then was,\n_________________________\n(1) [1955] 1 SCR 707.\n\n(2) [1964] 5 SCR 975.\n\n(3) [1975] 2 S.C.R. 774.\nrecalled the following statement of the law from the\nJudgment of this Court in\nRam Krishna Dalmia v. S.R.\nTendolkar & others\n: (1)\n\"there is always a presu mption in favour of the\nconstitutionality of an enactment and the burden is\nupon him who attacks it to show that there has been a\nclear transgression of the constitutional principles.\"\n\nand\n\"that it must be presumed that the legislature\nunderstands and correctly appreciates the need of its\nown people, that its laws are directed to problems made\nmanifest by experience and that its discriminations are\nbased on adequate grounds.\"\n\nand added that \"if nothing is placed on record by the\nchallengers, the verdict ordinarily goes against them.\"\nRelying inter alia on the decision of this Court in\nState of\nBombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala\n(2) the learned Judge again\nemphasized:\n\n\"Some courts have gone to the extent of holding\nthat there is a presumption in favour of\nconstitutionality, a law will not be declared\nunconstitutional unless the case is so clear as to be\nfree from doubt.\"\n\nThese observations of Krishna Iyer, J. undoubtedly seem\nto support the contention, of the respondents, but it may be\npointed out that what was said by this Court in the passage\nquoted above from the judgment in\nRam Krishna Dalmia\n's case\n(supra) on which reliance was placed by Krishna Iyer, J. was\nonly with reference to the challenge under\nArticle 14\nand\nthe Court was not considering there the challenge under\n\nArticles 19\nor 21.\n\nThis statement of the law contained in\n\nRam Krishna Dalmia\n's case (supra) could not therefore be\napplied straightaway without anything more in a case where a\nlaw was challenged under\nArticles 19\nor 21. The fact,\nhowever, remains that Krishna Iyer, J. relied on this\nstatement of the law even though the case before him\ninvolved a challenge under\nArticle 19(1) (f)\nand not under\n\nArticle 14.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that the attention of\nthe learned Judge was not invited to the decisions of this\nCourt in\nSaghir Ahmed\n's case and Khyerbari Tea Company's\ncase\n_______________________\n(1) [1959] SCR 297.\n\n(2) [1957] SCR 874.\n(supra) which were cases directly involving challenge under\n\nArticle 19.\nThese decisions were binding on the learned\nJudge and if his attention had been drawn to them, I am sure\nthat he would not have made the observations that he did\ncasting on the petitioners the onus of establishing\n\"excessiveness or perversity in the restrictions imposed by\nthe statute\" in a case alleging violation of\nArticle 19.\n\nThese observations are clearly contrary to the law\nlaid down\nin\nSaghir Ahmed and Khyerbari Tea Company cases (supra)\nThe respondents also relied on the observations of\nFazal Ali, J. in\nPathumma v. State of Kerala\n(1). There the\nconstitutional validity of the Kerala Agriculturists' Debt\nRelief Act 1970 was challenged on the ground of violation of\nboth\nArticles 14\nand\n19(1) (f).\nBefore entering upon a\ndiscussion of the arguments bearing on the validity of this\nchallenge, Fazal Ali. J. speaking on behalf of himself, Beg,\nC.J., Krishna Iyer and Jaswant Singh. JJ. observed that the\ncourt will interfere with a statute only \"when the statute\nis clearly violative of the right conferred on the citizen\nunder Part III of the Constitution\" and proceeded to add\nthat it is on account of this reason \"that courts have\nrecognised that there is always a presumption in favour of\nthe constitutionality of a statute and the onus to prove its\ninvalidity lies on the party which assails the same.\"\n\nThe\nlearned Judge then quoted with approval the following\npassage from the Judgment of S.R. Das, C.J. in\nMohd. Hanif\nv. State of Bihar\n(2)\n\"The pronouncements of this Court further\nestablish, amongst other things, that there is always a\npresumption in favour of the constitutionality of an\nenactment and that the burden is upon him, who attacks\nit, to show that there has been a clear violation of\nthe constitutional principles. The Courts, it is\naccepted, must presume that the legislature understands\nand correctly appreciates the needs of its own people,\nthat its laws are directed to problems made manifest by\nexperience and that its discriminations are based on\nadequate grounds.\"\n\nIt is difficult to see how these observations can be pressed\ninto service on behalf of the respondents. The passage from\nthe judgment of\n_______________________\n(1) [1970] 2 SCR 537.\n\n(2) [1959] S.C.R. 629.\nS.R. Das, C.J. in\nMohd. Hanif\n's case (supra) relied upon by\nFazal Ali, J. occurs in the discussion relating to the\nchallenge under\nArticle 14\nand obviously it was not intended\nto have any application in a case involving challenge under\n\nArticle 19\nor 21. In fact, while discussing the challenge to\nthe prevention of cow slaughter statutes under\nArticle\n19(1)(g)\n, S.R. Das, C.J. proceeded to consider whether the\nrestrictions imposed by the impugned statutes on the\nFundamental Rights of the petitioners under\nArticle 19(1)(g)\n\nwere reasonable in the interest of the general public so as\nto be saved by clause (6) of\nArticle 19.\nMoreover, the\nobservations made by Fazal Ali, J. were general in nature\nand they were not directed towards consideration of the\nquestion as to the burden of proof in cases involving\nviolation of\nArticle 19.\nWhat the learned Judge said was\nthat there is always a presumption in favour of the\nconstitutionality of a statute and the court will not\ninterfere unless the statute is clearly violative of the\nFundamental Rights conferred by Part III of the\nConstitution. This is a perfectly valid statement of the law\nand no exception can be taken to it. There must obviously be\na presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a\nstatute and initially it would be for the petitioners to\nshow that it violates a Fundamental Right conferred under\none or the other sub-clauses of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nand\nis therefore unconstitutional, but when that is done, the\nquestion arises, on whom does the burden of showing whether\nthe restrictions are permissible or not, lie? That was not a\nquestion dealt with by Fazal Ali, J. and I cannot therefore\nread the observations of the learned Judge as, in any\nmanner, casting doubt on the validity of the statement of\nlaw contained in Saghir Ahmed and Khyerbari Tea Company's\ncases (supra). It is clear on first principle that\nsubclauses (a) to (g) of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nenact\ncertain fundamental freedoms and if sub clauses (2) to (6)\nwere not there, any law contravening one or more of these\nfundamental freedoms would have been unconstitutional. But\nclauses (2) to (6) of\nArticle 19\nsave laws restricting these\nfundamental freedoms, provided the restrictions imposed by\nthem fall within certain permissible categories. Obviously\ntherefore, when a law is challenged on the ground that it\nimposes restrictions on the freedom guaranteed by one or the\nother subclause of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nand the\nrestrictions are shown to exist by the petitioner, the\nburden of establishing that the restrictions fall within any\nof the permissive clauses (2) to (6) which may be\napplicable, must rest upon the State. The State would have\nto produce material for satisfying the court that the\nrestrictions imposed\nby the impugned law fall within the appropriate permissive\nclause from out of clauses (2) to (6) of\nArticle 19.\nOf\ncourse there may be cases where the nature of the\nlegislation and the restrictions imposed by it may be such\nthat the court may, without more, even in the absence of any\npositive material produced by the State, conclude that the\nrestrictions fall within the permissible category, as for\nexample, where a law is enacted by the legislature for\ngiving effect to one of the Directive Principles of State\nPolicy and prima facie, the restrictions imposed by it do\nnot appear to be arbitrary or excessive. Where such is the\nposition, the burden would again shift and it would be for\nthe petitioner to show that the restrictions are arbitrary\nor excessive and go beyond what is required in public\ninterest. But, once it is shown by the petitioner that the\nimpugned law imposes restrictions which infringe one or the\nother sub-clause of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\n, the burden of\nshowing that such restrictions are reasonable and fall\nwithin the permissible category must be on the State and\nthis burden the State may discharge either by producing\nsocio economic data before the court or on consideration of\nthe provisions in the impugned law read in the light of the\nconstitutional goals set out in the Directive Principles of\nState Policy.\n\nThe test to be applied for the purpose of\ndetermining whether the restrictions imposed by the impugned\nlaw are reasonable or not cannot be cast in a rigid formula\nof universal application, for, as pointed out by Patanjali\nShastri, J. in\nState of Madras v. V.J. Row\n(1) \"no abstract\nstandard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid\ndown as applicable to all cases\". The nature of the right\nalleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of\nthe restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil\nsought to be remedied, the value of human life, the\ndisproportion of the imposition, the social philosophy of\nthe Constitution and the prevailing conditions at the time\nwould all enter into the judicial verdict. And we would do\nwell to bear in mind that in evaluating such elusive factors\nand forming his own conception of what is reasonable in all\nthe circumstances of a given case, it is inevitable that the\nsocial philosophy and the scale of values of the judge\nparticipating in the decision would play a very important\npart.\n\nBefore I proceed to consider the question of burden of\nproof in case of challenge under\nArticle 14\n, it would be\nconvenient first to\n(1) [1952] SCR 597.\ndeal with the question as to where does the burden of proof\nlie when the challenge to a law enacted by the legislature\nis based on violation of\nArticle 21.\nThe position in regard\nto onus of proof in a case where the challenge is under\n\nArticle 21\nis in my opinion much clearer and much more free\nfrom doubt or debate than in a case where the complaint is\nof violation of clause (1) of\nArticle 19.\nWherever there is\ndeprivation of life, and by life I mean not only physical\nexistence, but also use of any faculty or limb through which\nlife is enjoyed and basic human dignity, or of any aspect of\npersonal liberty, the burden must rest on the State to\nestablish by producing adequate material or otherwise that\nthe procedure prescribed for such deprivation is not\narbitrary but is reasonable, fair and just. I have already\ndiscussed various circumstances bearing upon the true nature\nand character of death penalty and these circumstances\nclearly indicate that it is reasonable to place on the State\nthe onus to prove that death penalty is not arbitrary or\nunreasonable and serves a compelling State interest. In the\nfirst place, death penalty destroys the most fundamental\nright of all, namely, the right to life which is the\nfoundation of all other fundamental rights. The right to\nlife stands on a higher footing than even personal liberty,\nbecause personal liberty too postulates a sentient human\nbeing who can enjoy it. Where therefore a law authorises\ndeprivation of the right to life the reasonableness,\nfairness and justness of the procedure prescribed by it for\nsuch deprivation must be established by the State. Such a\nlaw would be 'suspect' in the eyes of the court just as\ncertain kinds of classification are regarded as 'suspect' in\nthe United States of America. Throwing the burden of proof\nof reasonableness, fairness and justness on the State in\nsuch a case is a homage which the Constitution and the\ncourts must pay to the righ to life. It is significant to\npoint out that even in case of State action depriving a\nperson of his personal liberty, this Court has always cast\nthe burden of proving the validity of such action on the\nState, when it has been challenged on behalf of the person\ndeprived of his personal liberty. It has been consistently\nheld by this Court that when detention of a person is\nchallenged in a habeas corpus petition, the burden of\nproving the legality of the detention always rests on the\nState and it is for the State to justify the legality of the\ndetention. This Court has shown the most zealous regard for\npersonal liberty and treated even letters addressed by\nprisoners and detenus as writ petitions and taken action\nupon them and called upon the State to show how the\ndetention is justified. If this be the anxiety and concern\nshown by\nthe court for personal liberty, how much more should be the\njudicial anxiety and concern for the right to life which\nindisputably stands on a higher pedestal. Moreover, as\nalready pointed out above, the international standard or\nnorm set by the United Nations is in favour of abolition of\ndeath penalty and that is the ultimate objective towards\nwhich the world body is moving. The trend of our national\nlegislation is also towards abolition and it is only in\nexceptional cases for special reasons that death sentence is\npermitted to be given. There can be no doubt that even under\nour national legislation death penalty is looked upon with\ngreat disfavour. The drastic nature of death penalty\ninvolving as it does the possibility of error resulting in\njudicial murder of an innocent man as also its brutality in\ninflicting excruciating mental anguish severe psychological\nstrain and agonising physical pain and suffering on the\ncondemned prisoner are strong circumstances which must\ncompel the State to justify imposition of death penalty. The\nburden must lie upon the State show that death penalty is\nnot arbitrary and unreasonable and serves a legitimate\nsocial purpose, despite the possibility of judicial error in\nconvicting and sentencing an innocent man and the brutality\nand pain, mental as well as physical, which death sentence\ninvariably inflicts upon the condemned prisoner. The State\nmust place the necessary material on record for the purpose\nof discharging this burden which lies upon it and if it\nfails to show by presenting adequate evidence before the\ncourt or otherwise that death penalty is not arbitrary and\nunreasonable and does serve a legitimate social purpose, the\nimposition of death penalty under\nsection 302\nof the Indian\nPenal Code read with section 354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode\nof Criminal Procedure\nwould have to be struck down as\nviolative of the protection of\nArticle 21.\n\nSo far as the question of burden of proof in a case\ninvolving challenge under\nArticle 14\nis concerned, I must\nconcede that the decisions in Ram Krishan Dalmia's case\n(\nsupra) and Mohd. Hannif Qureshi\n's case (supra) and several\nother subsequent decisions of the Court have clearly laid\ndown that there is a presumption in favour of\nconstitutionality of a statute and the burden of showing\nthat it is arbitrary or discriminary lies upon the\npetitioner, because it must be presumed \"that the\nlegislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs\nof its own people, that its laws are directed to problems\nmade manifest by experience and that its discriminations are\nbased on adequate grounds.\" Sarkaria, J. has pointed out in\nthe majority judgment that underlying this presumption of\nconstitu-\ntionality \"is the rationale of judicial restraint, a\nrecognition of the limits of judicial review, a respect for\nthe boundaries of legislative and judicial functions and the\njudicial responsibility to guard the tresspass from one side\nor the other.\" The learned Judge with a belief firmly rooted\nin the tenets of mechanical jurisprudence, has taken the\nview that \"the primary function of the Courts is to\ninterpret and apply the laws according to the will of those\nwho made them and not to transgress into the legislative\ndomain of policy making.\" Now there can be no doubt that in\nadjudicating upon the constitutional validity of a statute,\nthe Judge should show deference to the legislative judgment\nand should not be anxious to strike it down as invalid. He\ndoes owe to the legislature a margin of tolerance and he\nmust constantly bear in mind that he is not the legislator\nnor is the court a representative body. But I do not agree\nwith Sarkaria, J. when he seems to suggest that the judicial\nrole is, as it was for Francis Bacon, 'jus dicere and not\njus dare; to interpret law and not to make law or give law.'\nThe function of the Court undoubtedly is to interpret the\nlaw but the interpretative process is highly creative\nfunction and in this process, the Judge, as pointed out by\nJustice Holmes, does and must legislate. Lord Reid ridiculed\nas 'a fairytale' the theory that in some Aladdin's cave is\nhidden the key to correct judicial interpretation of the\nlaw's demands and even Lord Diplock acknowledged that \"The\ncourt may describe what it is doing in tax appeals as\ninterpretation. So did the priestess of the Delphic Oracle.\nBut whoever has final authority to explain what Parliament\nmeant by the words that it used, makes law as if the\nexplanation it has given were contained in a new Act of\nParliament. It will need a new Act of Parliament to reverse\nit.\" Unfortunately we are so much obsessed with the\nsimplicities of judicial formalism which presents the\njudicial role as jus dicere, that, as pointed out by David\nPannick in his \"Judicial Review of the Death Penalty\", \"we\nhave, to a substatial extent, ignored the Judge in\nadministering the judicial process. So heavy a preoccupation\nwe have made with the law, its discovery and its agents who\nplay no creative role, that we have paid little, if any,\nregard to the appointment, training, qualities, demeanour\nand performance of the individuals selected to act as the\nmouth of the legal oracle.\" It is now acknowledged by\nleading jurists all over the world that judges are not\ndescusitized and passionless instruments which weigh on\ninanimate and impartial scales of legal judgment, the\nevidence and the arguments presented on each side of the\ncase. They are not political\nand moral enuchs able and willing to avoid impregnating the\nlaw with their own ideas and judgment. The judicial exercise\nin constitutional adjudication is bound to be influenced,\nconsciously or subconsciouly, by the social philosophy and\nscale of values of those who sit in judgment. However, I\nagree with Sarkaria, J. that ordinarily the judicial\nfunction must be characterised by deference to legislative\njudgment because the legislature represents the voice of the\npeople and it might be dangerous for the court to trespass\ninto the sphere demarcated by the Constitution for the\nlegislature unless the legislative judgment suffers from a\nconstitutional infirmity. It is a trite saying that the\nCourt has \"neither force nor will but merely judgment\" and\nin the exercise of this judgment, it would be a wise rule to\nadopt to presume the constitutionality of a statute unless\nit is shown to be invalid. But even here it is necessary to\npoint out that this rule is not a rigid inexorable rule\napplicable at all times and in all situations. There may\nconceivably be cases where having regard to the nature and\ncharacter of the legislation, the importance of the right\naffected and the gravity the injury caused by it and the\nmoral and social issues involved in the determination, the\ncourt may refuse to proceed on the basis of presumption of\nconstitutionality and demand from the State justification of\nthe legislation with a view to establishing that it is not\narbitrary or discriminatory. There are times when commitment\nto the values of the Constitution and performance of the\nconstitutional role as guardian of fundamental rights\ndemands dismissal of the usual judicial deference to\nlegislative judgment. The death penalty, of which the\nconstitutionality is assailed in the present writ petitions,\nis a fundamental issue to which ordinary standards of\njudicial review are inappropriate. The question here is one\nof the most fundamental which has arisen under the\nConstitution, namely, whether the State is entitled to take\nthe life of a citizen under cover of judicial authority. It\nis a question so vital to the identity and culture of the\nsociety and so appropriate for judicial statement of the\nstandards of a civilised community-often because of\nlegislative apathy-that \"passivity and activism become\nplatitudes through which judicial articulation of moral and\nsocial values provides a light to guide an uncertain\ncommunity.\" The same reasons which have weighed with me in\nholding that the burden must lie on the State to prove that\nthe death penalty provided under\nsection 302\nof the Indian\nPenal Code read with section 354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode\nof Criminal Procedure\nis not arbitrary and unreasonable and\nserves a legitimate penological purpose where\nthe challenge is under\nArticle 21\nmust apply equally to cast\nthe burden of the proof upon the State where the challenge\nis under\nArticle 14.\n\nNow it is an essential element of the rule of law that\nthe sentence imposed must be proportionate to the offence.\nIf a law provides for imposition of a sentence which is\ndisproportionate to the offence, it would be arbitrary and\nirrational, for it would not pass the test of reason and\nwould be contrary to the rule of law and void under\nArticles\n, 19\nand\n21.\nThe principle of proportionality is implicit\nin these three Articles of the Constitution. If, for\nexample, death penalty was prescribed for the simple offence\nof theft-as indeed it was at one time in the seventeenth\ncentury England-it would be clearly excessive and wholly\ndisproportionate to the offence and hence arbitrary and\nirrational by any standards of human decency and it would be\nimpossible to sustain it against the challenge of these\nthree Articles of the Constitution. It must therefore be\ntaken to be clear beyond doubt that the proportionality\nprinciple constitutes an important constitutional criterion\nfor adjudging the validity of a sentence imposed by law.\n\nThe Courts in the United States have also recognised\nthe validity of the proportionality principle. In Gregg v.\nGoergia (1) Stewart, J. speaking for the plurality of the\nAmerican Supreme Court said that \"to satisfy constitutional\nrequirements, the punishment must not be excessive...the\npunishment must not be out of proportion to the severity of\nthe crime. This constitutional criterion was also applied in\nCoker v. Georgia (2) to invalidate the death penalty for\nrape of an adult woman. While, J. with whom Stewarts and\nBlackmun, JJ. agreed, said, with regard to the offence of\nrape committed against an adult woman : \"a sentence of death\nis grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment for the\ncrime of rape and is therefore forbidden by the Eighth\nAmendment as cruel and unusual punishment\". Likewise in\nLockette v. Ohio (3) where the defendant sat outside the\nscene of robbery waiting to drive her accomplices away and\ncontrary to plan, the robbers murdered three victims in the\ncourse of their robbery and she was convicted and sentenced\nto death by resort to the doctrine of vicarious liability,\nthe Supreme Court of the United States applying the same\nprinciple of proportionality held the death sentence\nunconstitutional. Marshall, J. pointed out that because the\nappellant was convicted under a theory of vicarious\nliability, the death penalty imposed on her \"violates the\nprinciple of proportionality embodied in the Eighth\nAmendment's prohibition\" and White J. also subscribed to the\nsame reasoning when he said, \"the infliction of death upon\nthose who had no intent to bring about the death of the\nvictim is .....grossly out of proportion to the severity of\nthe crime\".\nOf course, the Supreme Court of the United\nStates relied upon the Eighth Amendment which prohibits\ncruel and unusual treatment or punishment and we have no\nsuch express prohibition in our Constitution, but this Court\nhas held in\nFrancis Mullen\n's case (supra) that protection\nagainst torture or cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment\nis implicit in the guarantee of\nArticle 21\nand therefore\neven on the basic of the reasoning in these three American\ndecisions, the principle of proportionallty would have\nrelevance under our Constitution. But, quite apart from\nthis, it is clear and we need not reiterate what we have\nalready said earlier, that the principle of proportionality\nflows directly as a necessary element from\nArticles 14\n, 19\n\nand\nof the Constitution.\nWe find that in Canada too, in\nthe case of Rex v. Miller and Cockriell (1) the principle of\nproportionality has been recognised by Laskin C.J. speaking\non behalf of Canadian Supreme Court as \"one of the\nconstitutional criteria of 'cruel and unusual treatment or\npunishment' prohited under the Canadian Bill of Rights.\nLaskin C.J. pointed out in that case \"It would be patent to\nme, for example, that death as a mandatory penalty today for\ntheft would be offensive to\ns. 2(b)\n. That is because there\nare social and moral considerations that enter into the\nscope and application of\nsection 2(b)\n. Harshness of\npunishment and its severity in consequences are relative to\nthe offence involved but, that being said, there may still\nbe a question (to which history too may be called in aid of\nits resolution) whether the punishment prescribed is so\nexcessive as to outrage standards of decency. That is not a\nprecise formula for\ns. 2(b)\nbut I doubt whether a more\nprecise one-can be found.\" Similarly, as pointed out by Mr.\nDavid Pannick in his book on \"Judicial Review of the Death\nPenalty\" international charters of rights express or imply\nthe principle of proportionality.\nArticle 7\nof the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights forbids\ntorture and cruel\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and so does\nArticle A 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It\nhas been suggested by Francis Jacobs, a commentator on the\nEuropean Convention that \"among the factors to be considered\nin deciding whether the death penalty, in particular\ncircumstances, was contrary to\nArticle 3\n, would be whether\nit was disproportionate to the offence.\n\nIt is necessary to point out at this stage that death\npenalty cannot be said to be proportionate to the offence\nmerely because it may be or is believed to be an effective\ndeterrent against the commission of the offence. In Coker v.\nGeorgia (supra) the Supreme Court of the United States held\nthat capital punishment is disproportionate to rape \"even\nthough it may measurably serve the legitimate ends of\npunishment and therefore is not invalid for its failure to\ndo so.\" The absence of any rational purpose to the\npunishment inflicted is a separate ground for attacking its\nconstitutionality. The existence of a rational legislative\npurpose for imposing the sentence of death is a necessary\ncondition of its constitutionality but nota sufficient one.\nThe death penalty for theft would, for example, deter most\npotential thieves and may have a unique deterrent effect in\npreventing the commission of the offence; still it would be\nwholly disproportionate and excessive, for the social effect\nof the penalty is not decisive of the proportionality to the\noffence. The European Court of Human Rights also observed in\nTyrer v. United Kingdom (1) that \"a punishment does not lose\nits degrading character just because it is believed to be,\nor actually is, an effective deterrent or aid to crime\ncontrol. Above all, as the court must emphasize, it is never\npermissible to have recourse to punishments which are\ncontrary to\nArticle 3\n, whatever their deterrent effect may\nbe.\" The utilitarian value of the punishment has nothing to\ndo with its proportionality to the offence. It would\ntherefore be no answer in the present case for the\nrespondents to say that death penalty has a unique deterrent\neffect in preventing the crime of murder and therefore it is\nproportionate to the offence. The proportionality between\nthe offence and death penalty has to be judged by reference\nto objective factors such as international standards or\nnorms or the climate of international opinion, modern\npenological theories and evolving standards of human\ndecency. I have already pointed out and I need not repeat\nthat the international standard or norm which\nis being evolved by the United Nations is against death\npenalty and so is the climate of opinion in most of the\ncivilized countries of the world. I will presently show that\npenological goals also do not justify the imposition of\ndeath penalty for the offence of murder. The prevailing\nstandards of human decency are also incompatible with death\npenalty. The standards of human decency with reference to\nwhich the proportionality of the punishment to the offence\nis required to be judged vary from society to society\ndepending on the cultural and spiritual tradition of the\nsociety, its history and philosophy and its sense of moral\nand ethical values. To take an example, if a sentence of\ncutting off the arm for the offence of theft or a sentence\nof stoning to death for the offence of adultery were\nprescribed by law, there can be no doubt that such\npunishment would be condemned as barbaric and cruel in our\ncountry, even though it may be regarded as proportionate to\nthe offence and hence reasonable and just in some other\ncountries. So also the standards of human decency vary from\ntime to time even within the same society. In an\nevolutionary society, the standards of human decency are\nprogressively evolving to higher levels and what was\nregarded as legitimate and reasonable punishment\nproportionate to the offence at one time may now according\nto the envolving standards of human decency, be regarded as\nbarbaric and inhuman punishment wholly disproportionate to\nthe offence. There was a time when in the United Kingdom a\nsentence of death for the offence of theft or shop lifting\nwas regarded as proportionate to the offence and therefore\nquite legitimate and reasonable according to the standards\nof human decency then prevailing, but today such punishment\nwould be regarded as totally disproportionate to the offence\nand hence arbitrary and unreasonable. The question,\ntherefore, is whether having regard to the international\nstandard or norm set by the United Nations in favour of\nabolition of death penalty, the climate of opinion against\ndeath penalty in many civilized countries of the world and\nthe prevailing standards of human decency, a sentence of\ndeath for the offence of murder can be regarded as\nsatisfying the test of proportionality and hence reasonable\nand just. I may make it clear that the question to which I\nam addressing myself is only in regard to the\nproportionality of death sentence to the offence of murder\nand nothing that I say here may be taken as an expression of\nopinion on the question whether a sentence of death can be\nsaid to be proportionate to the offence of treason or any\nother offence involving the security of the State.\nNow in order to determine what are the prevailing\nstandards of human decency, one cannot ignore the cultural\nethos and spiritual tradition of the country. To quote the\nwords of Krishna Iyer, J. in\nRaiendra Prasad\n's case \"The\nvalues of a nation and ethos of a generation mould concepts\nof crime and punishment. So viewed, the lode-star of penal\npolicy today, shining through the finer culture of former\ncenturies, strengthens the plea against death penalty...The\nIndian cultural current also counts and so does our\nspiritual chemistry, based on divinity in everyone,\ncatalysed by the Buddha Gandhi compassion. Many humane\nmovements and sublime souls have cultured the higher\nconsciousness of mankind.\" In this land of Buddha and\nGandhi, where from times immemorial, since over 5000 years\nago, every human being is regarded as embodiment of Brahman\nand where it is a firm conviction based not only on faith\nbut also on experience that \"every saint has a past and\nevery sinner a future\", the standards of human decency set\nby our ancient culture and nourished by our constitutional\nvalues and spiritual norms frown upon imposition of death\npenalty for the offence of murder. It is indisputable that\nthe Constitution of a nation reflects its culture and ethos\nand gives expression to its sense of moral and ethical\nvalues. It affords the surest indication of the standards of\nhuman decency cherished by the people and sets out the\nsocio-cultural objectives and goals towards which the nation\naspires to move. There can be no better index of the ideals\nand aspirations of a nation than its Constitution. When we\nturn to our Constitution, we find that it is a humane\ndocument which respects the dignity of the individual and\nThe worth of the human person and directs every organ of\nthe State to strive for the fullest development of the per -\nsonality of every individual. Undoubtedly, as already\npointed out above, our Constitution does contemplate death\npenalty, and at the time when the Constitution came to be\nenacted, death penalty for the offence of murder was on the\nstatute book, but the entire thrust of the Constitution is\nin the direction of development of the full potential of\nevery citizen and the right to life alonggwith basic human\ndignity is highly prized and cherished and torture and cruel\nor in-human treatment or punishment which would be degrading\nand destructive of human dignity are constitutionally\nforbidden. Moreover, apart from the humanistic quintessence\nof the Constitution, the thoughts, deeds and words of the\ngreat men of this country provide the clearest indication of\nthe prevailing standards of human\ndecency. They represent the conscience of the nation and are\nthe most authentic spokesmen of its culture and ethos.\nMahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation wrote long ago in\nthe Harijan. \"God alone can take life because He alone gives\nit. He also said and this I may be permitted to emphasize\neven at the cost of repetition: \"Destruction of individuals\ncan never be a virtuous act. The evil doers cannot be done\nto death . . Therefore all crimes including murder will have\nto be treated as a disease.\" I have also quoted above what\nJai Prakash Narain said in his message to the Delhi\nConference against Death Penalty. The same humanistic\napproach we find in the utterances of Vinoba Bhave. His\napproach to the problem of dacoits in Chambal Valley and the\nmanner in which he brought about their surrender through\nsoulforce bear eloquent testimony to the futility of death\npenalty and shows how even dacoits who have committed\ncountless murders can be reclaimed by the society. But, the\nmore important point is that this action of Vinoba Bhave was\napplauded by the whole nation and Dr. Rajendra Prasad who\nwas then the President of India, sent the following telegram\nto Binoba Bhave when he came to know that about 20 dacoits\nfrom the Chambal region had responded to the Saint's appeal\nto surrender .\n\n\"The whole nation looks with hope and admiration\nupon the manner in which you have been able to rouse\nthe better instincts and moral sense, and thereby\ninspire faith in dacoits which has led to their\nvoluntary surrender. Your efforts, to most of us, come\nas a refreshing proof of the efficacy of the moral\napproach for reforming the misguided and drawing the\nbest out of them. I can only pray for the complete\nsuccess of your mission and offer you my regards and\nbest wishes.\"\n\nThese words coming from the President of India who is the\nHead of the nation reflect not only his own admiration for\nthe manner in which Vinoba Bhave redeemed the dacoits but\nalso the admiration of the entire nation and that shows that\nwhat Vinoba Bhave did, had the approval of the people of the\ncountry and the standards of human decency prevailing\namongst the people commended an approach favouring\nreformation and rehabilitation of the dacoits rather than\ntheir conviction for the various offences of murder com-\nmitted by them and the imposition of death penalty on them.\nMore over, it is difficult to see bow death penalty can be\nregarded as pro-\nportionate to the offence of murder when legislatively it\nhas been A ordained that life sentence shall be the rule and\nit is only in exceptional cases for special reasons that\ndeath penalty may be imposed. It is obvious from the\nprovision enacted in section 354(3) of the -\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\nthat death sentence is legislatively\nregarded as disproportionate and excessive in most cases of\nmurder and it is only in exceptional cases what Sarkaria, J.\nspeaking on -. - behalf of the majority, describes as \"the\nrarest of rare\" cases, that it can at all be contended that\ndeath sentence is proportionate to the offence of murder.\nBut, then the legislature does not indicate as to what are\nthose exceptional cases in which death sentence may be\nregarded as proportionate to the offence and, therefore,\nreasonable and just. Merely because a murder is heinous or\nhorrifying, it cannot be said that death penalty is\nproportionate to the offence when it is not so for a simple\nmurder. How does it become proportionate to the offence\nmerely because it is a 'murder most foul'.\nI fail to\nappreciate how it should make any difference to the penalty\nwhether the murder is a simple murder or a brutal one. A\nmurder is a murder all the same whether it is carried out\nquickly and inoffensively or in a gory and gruesome manner.\nIf death penalty is not proportionate to the offence in the\nformer case, it is difficult to see how it can be so in the\nlatter. I may usefully quote in this connection the words of\nKrishna Iyer, J. in\nRajendra Prasad\n's case where the learned\nJudge said;\n\n\"Speaking illustratively, is shocking crime,\nwithout more, good to justify the lethal verdict ? Most\nmurders are horrifying, and an adjective adds but\nsentiment, not argument. The personal story of an actor\nin a shocking murder, if considered, may bring tears\nand soften the sentence. He P . might have been a\ntortured child, an ill-treated orphan, a jobless\nstarveling, a badgered brother, a wounded son, a tragic\nperson hardened by societal cruelty or vengeful\njustice, - even a Hemlet or Parasurarna. He might have\nbeen an - - angelic boy but thrown into mafia company\nor inducted into dopes and drugs by parental neglect or\nmorally-ment-ally retarded or disordered. Imagine a\nharijan village hacked out of existence by the\ngenocidal fury of a kulak ' group and one survivor,\ndays later, cutting to pieces the villain of the\nearlier outrage. Is the court in error in reckoning the\nprior provocative barbarity as a sentencing factor ?\nAnother facet. May be, the convict's poverty had\ndisabled his presentation of the social milieu or other\ncircumstances of extenuation in defence.. When life is\nat stake, can such frolics of fortune play with\njudicial , verdicts ?\n\n\"The nature of the crime-too terrible to\ncontemplate has often been regarded a traditional peg on\nwhich to hang a death penalty.\nEven Ediga Anamma\n(supra) has\nhardened here. But 'murder most foul' is not the test,\nspeaking J- scientifically. The doer may be a patriot, a\nrevolutionary, a weak victim of an overpowering passion who,\ngiven better a environment, may be a good citizen, a good\nadministrator, a good husband, a great saint. What was\nValmiki once ? And that sublime spiritual star, Shri\nAurobindo tried once - for murder but by history's fortune\nacquitted.\"\n\nI agree with these observations of the learned Judge which\nclearly show that death penalty cannot be regarded as\nproportionate to the offence of murder, merely because the\nmurder is brutal, heinous or shocking. The nature and\nmagnitude of the offence or the motive and purposes\nunderlying it or the manner and extent of its commission\ncannot have any relevance to the proportionality of death\npenalty to the offence. It may be argued that though these\nfactors may not of themselves be relevant,. they may go to\nshow that the murderer is such a social monster, a\npsychopath, that he cannot be reformed and he should\ntherefore be regarded as human refuse, dangerous to society,\nand deserving to be hanged and in such a case death penalty\nmay legitimately be regarded as proportionate to the\noffence. But I do not think this is a valid argument. It is\nfor reasons which I shall presently state, wholly untenable\nand it has dangerous implications. I do not think it is\npossible to hold that death penalty is, in any\ncircumstances, proportionate to the offence of murder.\nMoreover, when death penalty does not serve any legitimate\nsocial purpose, and this is a proportion which I shall\nproceed to establish in the succeeding paragraphs,\ninfliction of mental and physical pain and suffering on the\ncondemned prisoner by sentencing him to death penalty cannot\nbut be regarded as cruel and inhuman and therefore arbitrary\nand unreasonable.\n\nI will now examine whether death penalty for the\noffence of murder serves any legitimate social purpose.\nThere are three justi-\nfications traditionally advanced in support of punishment in\ngeneral, namely, (1) reformation; (2) denunciation by the\ncommunity or retribution and (3) deterrence. These are the\nthree ends of punishment, its three penological goals, with\nreference to which any punishment prescribed by law must be\njustified. If it cannot be justified with reference to one\nor the other of these three penological purposes, it would\nhave to be condemned as arbitrary and irrational, for in a\ncivilised society governed by the rule of law, no punishment\ncan be inflicted on an individual unless it serves some\nsocial purpose. It is a condition of legality of a\npunishment that it should serve a rational legislative\npurpose or in other words, it should have a measurable\nsocial effect. Let us therefore examine whether death\npenalty for the offence of murder serves any legitimate and\nof punishment.\n\nIt would be convenient first to examine the examine the\nconstutionality of death penalty with reference to the\nreform tory end of punishment. The civilised goal of\ncriminal justice is the reformation of the criminal and\ndeath penalty means abandonment of this goal for those who\nsuffer it. Obviously death penalty cannot serve the\nreformatory goal because it extinguishes life and puts an\nend to any possibility of reformation. In fact, it defeats\nthe reformatory end of punishment. But the answer given by\nthe protagonists of death penalty to this argument is that\nthough there may be a few murderers whom it may be possible\nto reform and rehabilitate, what about those killers who\ncannot be reformed and rehabilitated ? Why should the death\npenalty be not awarded to them ? But even in their cases, I\nam afraid, the argument cannot be sustained. There is no way\nof accurately predicting or knowing with any degree of moral\ncertainty that a murderer will not be reformed or is\nincapable of reformation. All we know is that there have\nbeen many many successes even with the most vicious of\ncases. Was Jean Valjean of Les Miserbles not reformed by the\nkindness and magnanimity of the Bishop ? Was Valmiki a\nsinner not reformed and did he not become the author of one\nof the world's greatest epics ? Were the dacoits of Chambal\nnot transformed by the saintliness of Vinoba Bhave and Jai\nPrakash Narain ? We have also the examples of Nathan\nLeopold, Paul Crump and Edger Smith who were guilty of the\nmost terrible and gruesome murders but who, having escaped\nthe gallows, became decent and productive human beings.\nThese and many other examples clearly\nshow that it is not possible to know before hand with any\ndegree of cartainty that a murderer is beyond reformation.\nThen would it be right to extinguish the life of a human\nbeing merely on the basis of speculation and it can only be\nspeculation and not any definitive inference-that he cannot\nbe reformed. There is divinity in every man and to my mind\nno one is beyond redemption. It was Ramakrishna Paramhansa,\none of the greatest saints of the last century, who said,\n\"Each soul is potentially divine\". There is Brahman in every\nliving being, serve khalu idan bramh, as the Upanishad says\nand to the same effect we find a remarkable utterance in the\nBrahmasukta of Atharvaveda where a sage exclaims: \"Indeed\nthese killers are Brahman; these servants (or slaves) are\nBrahmaa; these cheats and rogues are also manifestation of\none and the same Brahman itself.\" Therefore once the dross\nof Tamas is removed and satva is brought forth by methods of\nrehabilitation such as community service, yoga, meditation\nand sat sang or holy influence, a change definitely takes\nplace and the man is reformed. This .\nis not just a fancy or\nidealised view taken by Indian philosophical thought, but it\nalso finds Support from the report of the Royal Commission\non Capital Punishment set up in the United Kingdom where it\nhas been said: \"Not that murderers in general are incapable\nof reformation, the evidence plainly shows the contrary.\nIndeed, as we shall see later\" (in paragraphs 651-652) \"the\nexperience of countries without capital punishment indicates\nthat the prospects of reformation are at least as favourable\nwith murderers as with those who have committed other kinds\nof serious crimes.\" The hope of reforming even the worst\nkiller is based on exeperience as well as faith and to\nlegitimate the death penalty even in the so called\nexceptional cases where a killer is said to be beyond\nreformation, would be to destroy this hope by sacrificing it\nat the altar of superstition and irrationality. I would not\ntherefore, speaking for myself, be inclined to recognise any\nexception, though Justice Krishna Iyer has done so in\n\nRajendra Prasad\n's case, that death panalty may be legally\npermissible where it is found that a killer is such a\nmonster or beast that he can never be-reformed. Moreover, it\nmay be noted, as pointed out by Albert Camus, that in\nresorting to this philosophy of elimination of social\nmonsters, we would be approaching some of the worst ideas of\ntotalitarianism or the selective racism which the Hitler\nregime propounded. Sir Ernest Gowers, Chairman of the Royal\nCommission on Capital Punishment also emphasized the\ndisturbing implications of this argument favouring\nelimination of\na killer who is a social monster and uttered the following\nwarning A \"If it is right to eliminate useless and dangerous\nmembers of the community why should the accident of having\ncommitted a capital offence determine who should be\nselected. These ar. Only a tiny proportion and not\nnecessarily the most dangerous.... It can lead to Nazism.\"\nThis theory that a killer who is believed to be a social\nmonster or beast should be eliminated in defence of the\nsociety cannot therefore be accepted and it cannot provide\na justification for imposition of death penalty even in this\nnarrow class of cases.\n\nI will now turn to examine the constiutional validity\nof death penalty with reference to the second goal of\npunishment, namely, denunciation by the community or\nretribution. The argument which is sometimes advanced in\nsupport of the death penalty is that every punishment is to\nsome exetent intended to express the revulsion felt by the\nsociety against the wrong doer and the punishment must,\ntherefore, be commensurate with the crime and since murder\nis one of the gravest crimes against society, death penalty\nis the only punishment which fits such crime and hence it\nmust he held to be reasonable. This argument is founded on\nthe denunciatory theory of punishment which apparently\nclaiming to justify punishment, as the expression of the\nmoral indignation of the society against the wrong doer,\nrepresents in truth and reality an attempt to legitimise the\nfeeling of revenge entertained by the society against him.\nThe denunciatory theory was put forward as an argument in\nfavour of death penalty by Lord Denning before the Royal\nCommission on Capital Punishment:\n\n\"The punishment inflicted for grave crimes should\nadequately reflect the revulsion felt by the great\nmajority of citizens for them. It is a mistake to\nconsider the objects of punishment as being deterrent\nor reformative or preventive and nothing else. The\nultimate justification of any punishment is not that it\nis a deterrent but that it is the emphatic denunciation\nby the community of a crime, and from this point of\nview there are some murders which in the present state\nof opinion demand the most emphatic denunciation of\nall, namely, the death penalty.. The truth is that some\ncrimes are so outrageous that it, irrespective of\nwhether it is a deterrent or not.\"\nThe Royal Commission on Capital Punishment seemed to agree\nwith Lord Denning's view about this justification for the\ndeath penalty and observed.\".. the law cannot ignore the\npublic demand for retribution which heinous crimes\nundoubtedly provoke; it would be generally agreed that,\nthough reform of the criminal law ought sometimes, to give a\nlead to public opinion, it is dangerous to move too far in\nadvance of it.\" Though garbed in highly euphemistic language\nby labelling the sentiment underlying this observation as\nreprobation and not revenge, its implication can hardly be\ndisguised that the death penalty is considered necessary not\nbecause the preservation of the society demands it, but\nbecause the society wishes to avenge itself for the wrong\ndone to it. Despite its high moral tone and phrase, the\ndenunciatory theory is nothing but an echo of what Stephen\nsaid in rather strong language: \"The criminal law stands to\nthe passion of revenge in much the same relation as marriage\nto the sexual appetite.\" The denunciatory theory is a\nremnant of a primitive society which has no respect for the\ndignity of man and the worth of the human person and seeks\nto assuage its injured conscience by taking revenge on the\nwrong doer. Revenge is an elementary passion of a brute and\nbetrays lack of culture and refinement. The manner in which\na society treats crime and criminals affords the surest\nindex of its cultural growth and development. Long ago in\nthe year 1910 Sir Winston Churchill gave expression to this\nsocial truth when he said in his inimitable language:\n\n\"The mood and temper of the public with regad to\nthe treatment of crime and the criminals is one of the\nmost unfailing tests of civilization of any country. A\ncalm dispassionate recognition of the right of accused,\nand even of the convicted, criminal against the State,\na constant heart searching by all charged with the duty\nof punishment tireless efforts towards the discovery of\ncurative and , regenerative processes, unfailing faith\nthat there is a treasure if you can only find it in the\nheart of every man-these are the symbols, which, in\ntreatment of crime and the criminals, mark and measure\nthe stored-up strength of a nation and are sign and\nproof of the living virtue in it.-\n\nA society which is truly cultured-a society which is reared\non a spiritual foundation like the Indian society-can never\nharbour a\nfeeling of revenge against a wrong doer. On the contrary,\nit would A try to reclaim the wrong doer and find the\ntreasure that is in his heart. The wrong doer is as much as\npart of the society as anyone else and by exterminating him,\nwould the society not injure itself ? If a limb of the human\nbody becomes diseased, should we not try to cure it instead\nof amputating it ? Would the human body not be partially\ndisabled: would it not be rendered imperfect by the .\namputation ? Would the amputation not leave a scar on the\nhuman body ? Would the human body not cease to be what it\nwas intended by its maker? But if the diseased limb can be\ncured, would it not be so much better that the human body\nremains intact in all its perfection. Similarly the society\nalso would benefit if one of its members who has gone astray\nand done some wrong can be reformed and regenerated. It will\nstrengthen the fabric of the society and increase its inner\nstrength and vitality. Let it not be forgotten that no human\nbeing is beyond redemption. There is divinity in every human\nbeing, if only we can create conditions in which it can\nblossom forth in its full glory, and effulgence. It can\ndissolve the dross of criminality and make God out of man.\n\"Each soul\", said Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa, \"is\npotentially divine\" and it should be the endeavour of the\nsociety to reclaim the wrong doer and bring out the divinity\nJ in him and not to destroy him in a fit of anger or\nrevenge. Retaliation can have no place in a civilised\nsociety and particularly in the Land of Buddha and Gandhi.\nThe law of Jesus must prevail over the lex tallionis of\nMoses, \"Thou shalt not kill\" must penologically over power\n\"eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth.\" The society has made\ntremendous advance in the last few decades and today the\nconcept of human rights has taken firm root in our soil and\nthere is a tremendous wave of consciousness in regard to the\ndignity and divinity of man. To take human life even with\nthe sanction of the law and under the cover of judicial\nauthority, is retributive barbarity and violent futility:\n\ntravesty of dignity and violation of the divinity of man. So\nlang as the offender can be reformed through the\nrehabilitatory therapy which may be administered to him in\nthe prison or other correctional institute and he can be\nreclaimed as a useful citizen and made conscious of the\ndivinity within him by techniques such as meditation, how\ncan there be any moral justification for liquidating him out\nof existence ? In such a case, it would be most unreasonable\nand arbitrary to extinguish the flame of life within him,\nfor no social purpose would be served and no consti-\ntutional value advanced by doing so. I have already pointed\nout that death penalty runs counter to the reformatory\ntheory of punishment and I shall presently discuss the\ndeterrent aspect of death penalty and show that death\npenalty has not greater deterrent effect than life\nimprisonment. The only ground on which the death penalty may\ntherefore be sought to be justified is reprobation which as\nalready pointed out, is nothing but a different name for\nrevenge and retaliation. But in a civilised society which\nbelieves in the dignity and worth of the human person, which\nacknowledges and protects the right to life as the most\nprecious possession of mankind, which recognises the\ndivinity in man and describes a his kind as \"Amaratsaya\nPutra\" that is \"children of Immortality\", it is difficult to\nappreciate now retaliatory motivation can ever be\ncountenanced as a justificatory reason. This reason is\nwholly inadequate since it does not justify punishment by\nits results, but it merely satisfies the passion for revenge\nmasquerading as righteousness.\n\nI may point that in holding this view I am not alone,\nfor I find that most philosophers have rejected retribution\nas a proper goal of punishment. Plato wrote:\n\"He who desires to inflict rational punishment\ndoes not retaliate for a past wrong which cannot be\nundone; he has regard to the future, and is desirous\nthat the man who is punished, and he who sees him\npunished, may be deterred from doing wrong again. He\npunishes for the sake of prevention....\"\n\nEven in contemporary America, it is firmly settled that\nretribution has no proper place in our criminal system. The\nNew York Court of Appeals pointed out in a leading judgment\nin People v. Oliver:\n\n\"The punishment or treatment of offenders is\ndirected toward one or more of three ends: (I) to\ndiscourage and act as a deterrent upon future criminal\nactivity. (2) to confine the offender so that he may\nnot harm society; and (3) to correct and rehabilitate\nthe offender. There is no\nplace in the scheme for punishment for its own sake,\nthe product simply of vengeance or retribution.\"\n\nSimilarly, the California Supreme Court has held that \"to\nconclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for\nvengeance\" would be \"a conclusion not permitted in view of\nmodern theories of penology.\"\n\nThe same view has been adopted in official studies of\ncapital punishment. The British Royal Commission on Capital\nPunishment concluded that \"modern penological thought\ndiscounts retribution in the sense of vengeance. \"The\nFlorida Special Commission on capital punishment, which\nrecommended retention of the death penalty on other grounds,\nrejected \"vengeance or retaliation\" as justification for the\nofficial taking of life.\"\n\nThe reason for the general rejection of retribution as\na purpose of the criminal system has been stated concisely\nby Professors Michael and Wechsler:\n\n\"Since punishment consists in the infliction of\npain it is, apart from its consequence, an evil:\n\nconsequently it is good and therefore just only if and\nto the degree that it serves the common good by\nadvancing the welfare of the person punished or of the\nrest of the population-Retribution is itself unjust\nsince it requires some human beings to inflict pain\nupon others, regardless of its effect upon them or upon\nthe social welfare.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister of Canada Mr. Pierre Trudeaux, addressing\nthe Canadian Parliament, pleading for abolition of death\npenalty, posed a question in the same strain:\n\n\"Are we as a society so lacking in respect for\nourselves, so lacking in hope for human betterment, so\nsocially bankrupt that we are ready to accept state\nvengeance as our penal philosophy\"\n\nIt is difficult to appreciate how a feeling of vengeance\nwhether on the individual wronged or the society can ever be\nregarded as a healthy sentiment which the State should\nfoster. It is true that when a heinous offence is committed\nnot only the individual who suffers\nas a result of the crime but the entire society is oppressed\nwith a feeling of revulsion, but as Arthur Koestler has put\nit in his inimitable style in his \"Reflections on Hanging\":\n\n\"Though easy to dismiss in reasoned argument on\nboth moral and logical grounds, the desire for\nvengeance has deep, unconscious roots and is roused\nwhen we feel strong indignation or revulsion-whether\nthe reasoning mind approves or not. This psychological\nfact is largely ignored in abolitionist propaganda-yet\nit has to be accepted as a fact. The admission that\neven confirmed abolitionists are not proof against\noccasional vindictive impulses does not mean that such\nimpulses should be legally sanctioned by society, any\nmore than we sanction some other unpalatable instincts\nof our biological inheritance. Deep inside every\ncivilized being there lurks a tiny Stone Age man,\ndangling a club to robe and rape, and screaming an eye\nfor an eye. But we would rather not have that little\nfur-clad figure dictate the law of the land.\"\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that if the only justification\nfor the death penalty is to be found in revenge and\nretaliation, it would be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable\npunishment falling foul of\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\n\nI must then turn to consider the deterrent effect of\ndeath penalty, for deterrence is undoubtedly an important\ngoal of punishment.\n\nThe common justification which has been put forward on\nbehalf of the protagonists in support of capital punishment\nis that it acts as a deterrent against potential murderers.\nThis is, to my mind, a myth, which has been carefully\nnurtured by a society which is actuated not so much by logic\nor reason as by a sense of retribution. It is really the\nbelief in retributive justice that makes the death penalty\nattractive but those supporting it are not inclined to\nconfess to their instinct for retribution but they try to\nbolster with reasons their unwillingness to abandon this\nretributive instinct and seek to justify the death penalty\nby attribution to it a deterrent effect. The question\nwhether the death penalty has really and truly\na deterrent effect is an important issue which has received\ncareful attention over the last 40 years in several\ncountries including the United States of America. Probably\nno single subject in criminology has been studied more.\nObviously, no penalty will deter all murders and probably\nany severe penalty will deter many. The key question\ntherefore is not whether death penalty has a deterrent\neffect but whether death penalty has a greater deterrent\neffect than life sentence. Does death penalty deter\npotential murderers better than life imprisonment ? I shall\npresently consider this question but before I do so let me\nrepeat that the burden of showing that death penalty is not\narbitrary and unreasonable and serves a legitimate\npenological goal is on the State. I have already given my\nreasons for taking this view on principle but I find that\nthe same view has also been taken by the Supreme Judicial\nCourt of Massachusettes in \"Commonwealth v. O'Neal (No.2)(1)\nwhere it has been held that because death penalty impinges\non the right to life itself, the onus lies on the State to\nshow a compelling State interest to justify capital\npunishment and since in that case the State was unable to\nsatisfy this onus, the Court ruled that death penalty for\nmurder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape was\nunconstitutional. The Supreme Judicial Court of\nMassachusttes also reiterated the same view in opinion of\nthe Justices 364 N.E. 2d 184 while giving its opinion\nwhether a Bill before the House of Representatives was\ncompatible with\nArticle 26\nof the Constitution which\nprohibits cruel or unusual punishment. The majority Judges\nstated hat\nArticle 26 \"\nforbids the imposition of a death\npenalty in this Commonwealth in the absence of a showing on\nthe part of the Commonwealth that the availability of that\npenalty contributes more to the achievement of a legitimate\nState purpose-for example, the purpose of deterring criminal\nconduct than the availability in like cases of the penalty\nof life imprisonment.\" It is therefore clear that the burden\nrests on the State to establish by producing material before\nthe Court or otherwise, that death penalty has greater\ndeterrent effect than life sentence in order to justify its\nimposition under the law. If the State fails to discharge\nthis burden which rests upon it, the Court would have to\nhold that death penalty has not been shown to have greater\ndeterrent effect and it does not therefore serve a rational\nlegislative purpose.\nThe historical course through which death penalty has\npassed in the last 150 years shows that the theory that\ndeath penalty acts as a greater deterrent than life\nimprisonment is wholly unfounded. Not more than a century\nand a half ago, in a civilised country like England, death\npenalty was awardable even for offences like shop lifting,\ncattle stealing and cutting down of trees. It is interesting\nto note that when Sir Samuel Romully brought proposals for\nabolition of death penalty for such offences, there was a\nhue and cry from lawyers, judges, Parliamentarians and other\nso called protectors of social order and they opposed the\nproposals on the grounds that death penalty acted as a\ndeterrent against commission of such offences and if this\ndeterrent was removed, the consequences would be disastrous.\nThe Chief Justice said while opposing abolition of capital\npunishment for shop-lifting:\n\n\"Where terror of death which now, as the law\nstood, threatened the depredator to be removed, it was\nhis opinion the consequence would be that shops would\nbe liable to unavoidable losses from depredations and,\nin many instances, bankruptcy and ruin must become the\nlot of honest and laborious tradesmen. After all that\nhad been said in favour of this speculative humanity,\nthey must all agree that the prevention of crime should\nbe the chief object of the law; and terror alone would\nprevent the com mission of that crime under their\nconsideration.\"\n\nand on a similar Bill, the Lord Chancellor remarked:\n\n\"So long as human nature remained what it was, the\napprehension of death would have the most powerful co\noperation in deterring from the commission of crimes;\nand he thought it unwise to withdraw the salutary\ninfluence of that terror.\"\n\nThe Bill for abolition of death penalty for cutting down a\ntree was opposed by the Lord Chancellor in these terms:\n\n\"It did undoubtedly seem a hardship that so heavy\na punishment as that of death should be affixed to the\ncutting down of a single tree, or the killing or\nwounding of a cow.\nBut if the Bill passed in its present state a person\nmight root up or cut down whole acres of plantations or\ndestroy the whole of the stock of cattle of a farmer\nwithout being subject to capital punishment.\"\n\nSix times the House of Commons passed the Bill to abolish\ncapital punishment for shop lifting and six times the House\nof Lords threw out the Bill, the majority of one occasion\nincluding all the judicial members, one Arch Bishop and six\nBishops. It was firmly believed by these opponents of\nabolition that death penalty acted as a deterrent and if it\nwas abolished, offences of shop-lifting etc would increase.\nBut it is a matter of common knowledge that this belief was\nwholly unjustified and the abolition of death penalty did\nnot have any adverse effect on the incidence of such\noffences. So also it is with death penalty for the offence\nof murder. It is an irrational belief unsubstantiated by any\nfactual data or empirical research that death penalty acts\nas a greater deterrent than life sentence and equally\nunfounded is the impression that the removal of death\npenalty will result in increase of homicide. The argument\nthat the rate of homicide will increase if death penalty is\nremoved from the statute book has always been advanced by\nthe established order out of fear psychosis, because the\nestablished order has always been apprehensive that if there\nis any change and death penalty is abolished, its existence\nwould be imperilled. This argument has in my opinion no\nvalidity because, beyond a superstitious belief for which\nthere is no foundation in fact and which is based solely on\nunreason and fear, there is nothing at all to show that\ndeath penalty has any additionally deterrent effect not\npossessed by life sentence. Arthur Koestler tells us an\ninteresting story that in the period when pick-pockets were\npunished by hanging in England, other thieves exercised\ntheir talents in the crowds sorrounding the scaffold where\nthe convicted pick-pocket was being hanged. Statistics\ncompiled during the last 50 years in England show that out\nof 250 men hanged, 170 had previously attended one or even\ntwo public executions and yet they were not deterred from\ncommitting the offence of murder which ultimately led to\ntheir conviction and hanging. It is a myth nurtured by\nsuperstition and fear that death penalty has some special\nterror for the criminal which acts as a deterrent against\nthe commission of the crime. Even an eminent judge like\nJustice Frank Furter of the Supreme Court of the United\nStates expressed the same opinion when he said in the course\nof his\nexamination before the Royal Commission on Capital\nPunishment:\n\n\"I think scientifically the claim of deterrence is\nnot worth much.\"\n\nThe Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, after four years\nof investigation which took it throughout the continent and\neven to the United States, also came to the same conclusion:\n\n\"Whether the death penalty is used or not and\nwhether executions are frequent or not, both death\npenalty states and abolition states show rates which\nsuggests that these rates are conditioned by other\nfactors than the death penalty.\"\n\nand then again, it observed in support of this conclusion:\n\n\"The general conclusion which we have reached is\nthat there is no clear evidence in any of the figures\nwe have examined that the abolition of capital\npunishment has led to an increasing homicide rate or\nthat its reintroduction has led to a fall.\"\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out in the United States\nof America for the purpose of exploring the deterrent effect\nof death penalty and two different methods have been\nadopted. The first and by far the more important method\nseeks to prove the case of the abolitionists by showing that\nthe abolition of capital punishment in other countries has\nnot led to an increase in the incidence of homicide. This is\nattempted to be shown either by comparing the homicide\nstatistics of countries where capital punishment has been\nabolished with the statistics for the same period of\ncountries where it has been retained or by comparing\nstatistics of a single country in which capital punishment\nhas been abolished, for periods before and after abolition\nor where capital punishment has been reintroduced, then for\nthe period before and after its reintroduction. The second\nmethod relates to comparison of the number of executions in\na country in particular years with the homicide rate in the\nyears succeeding. Now, so far as the comparison of homicide\nstatistics of countries which have abolished capital\npunishment with the statistics of countries which have\nretained it, is concerned, it may not yield any definitive\ninference, because in most cases abolition or retention of\ndeath\npenalty may not be the only differentiating factor but there\nmay be other divergent social, cultural or economic factors\nwhich may affect the homicide rates. It is only if all other\nfactors are equal and the only variable is the existence or\nnon-existence of death penalty that a proper comparison can\nbe made for the purpose of determining whether death penalty\nhas an additional deterrent effect which life sentence does\nnot possess, but that would be an almost impossible\ncontrolled experiment. It may however be possible to find\nfor comparison a small group of countries or States,\npreferably contiguous and closely similar in composition of\npopulation and social and economic conditions generally, in\nsome of which capital punishment has been abolished and in\nothers not. Comparison of homicide rates in these countries\nor States may afford a fairly reliable indication whether\ndeath penalty has a unique deterrent effect greater than\nthat of life sentence. Such groups of States have been\nidentified by Professor Sellin in the United States of\nAmerica and similar conditions perhaps exist also in\nNewzealand and the Australian States. The figures of\nhomicide rate in these States do not show any higher\nincidence of homicide in States which have abolished death\npenalty than in those which have not. Professor Sellin\npoints out that the only conclusion which can be drawn from\nthese figures is that there is no clear evidence . Of any\ninfluence of death penalty on the homicide rates of these\nStates. In one of the best known studies conducted by him,\nProfessor Sellin compared homicide rates between 1920 and\n1963 in abolition States with the rates in neighboring and\nsimilar retention States. He found that on the basis of the\nrates alone, it was impossible to identify the abolition\nStates within each group. A similar study comparing homicide\nrates in States recently abolishing the death penalty and\nneighboring retention States during the 1960's reached the\nsame results. Michigan was the first State in the United\nStates to abolish capital punishment and comparisons between\nMichigan and the bordering retention states of Ohio and\nIndiana States with comparable demographic characteristics\ndid not show any significant differences in homicide rates.\nProfessor Sellin therefore concluded: \"You cannot tell from\n.... the homicide rates alone, in contiguous, which are\nabolition and which are retention states; this indicates\nthat capital crimes are dependent upon factors other than\nthe mode of punishment.\"\n\nStudents of capital punishment have also studied the\neffect of abolition and reintroduction of death penalty upon\nthe homicide\nrate in a single state. If death penalty has a significant\ndeterrent effect? abolition should produce a rise in\nhomicides apart from the general trend and reintroduction\nshould produce a decline. After examining statistics from 11\nstates, Professor Sellin concluded that \"there is no\nevidence that the abolition of capital punishment generally\ncauses an increase in criminal homicides, or that its\nreintroduction is followed by a decline. The explanation of\nchanges in homicide rates must be sought elsewhere.\"\n\nSome criminologists have also examined the short term\ndeterrent effects of capital punishment. One study compared\nthe number of homicides during short periods before and\nafter several well-publicized executions during the twenties\nand thirties in Philadelphia. It was found that there were\nsignificantly more homicides in the period after the\nexecutions than before-the opposite of what the deterrence\ntheory would suggest other studies have also shown that in\nthose localities where capital punishment is carried out,\nthe incidence of homicide does not show any decline in the\nperiod immediately following well-publicized executions\nwhen, if death penalty had any special deterrent effect,\nsuch effect would be greatest. Sometimes, as Bowers points\nout in his book on \"Executions in America\" the incidence of\nhomicide is higher. In short, there is no correlation\nbetween the ups and downs of the homicide rate on the one\nhand and the presence or absence of the death penalty on the\nother.\n\nI may also refer to numerous other studies made by\njurists and sociologists in regard to the deterrent effect\nof death penalty Barring only one study made by Ehrlich to\nwhich I shall presently refer, all the other studies are\nalmost unanimous that death penalty has no greater deterrent\neffect than life imprisonment. Dogan D. Akman, a Canadian\nCriminologist, in a study made by him on the basis of data\nobtained from the records of all Canadian penitentiaries for\nthe years 1964 and 1965 observed that the threat of capital\npunishment has little influence on potential assaulters. So\nalso on the basis of comparison of homicide and execution\nrates between Queensland and other Australian States for the\nperiod 1860-1920, Barber and Wilson concluded that the\nsuspension of capital punishment from 1915 and its abolition\nfrom 1922 in Qneensland did not have any significant effect\non the murder rate. Chambliss, another Criminologist, also\nreached the same conclusion in his Article on \"Types of\nDeviance and the Effectiveness of Legal Sanctions\" (1967)\nWisconsin\nLaw Review 703 namely, that \"given the preponderance of evi-\ndence, it seems safe to conclude that capital punishment\ndoes not act as an effective deterrent to murder.\" Then we\nhave the opinion of Fred J. Cook who says in his Article on\n\"Capital Punishment: Does it Prevent Crime ?\" that\n\"abolition of the death penalty may actually reduce rather\nthan encourage murder.\" The European Committee on Crime\nProblems of the Council of Europe gave its opinion on the\nbasis of data obtained from various countries who are\nMembers of the Council of Europe that these data did not\ngive any \"positive indication regarding the value of capital\npunishment as a deterrent\". I do not wish to burden this\njudgment with reference to all the studies which have been\nconducted at different times in different parts of the world\nbut I may refer to a few of them, namely \"Capital Punishment\nas a Deterrent to Crime in Georgia\" by Frank Gibson, \"The\nDeath Penalty in Washington State\" by Hayner and Crannor,\nReport of the Massachusett Special Commission Relative to\nthe Abolition of the Death Penalty in Capital Cases, \"The\nuse of the Death Penalty-Factual Statement\" by Walter\nReckless, \"Why was Capital Punishment resorted in Delaware\"\n\nby Glenn W. Samuelson, \"A Study in Capital Punishment\" by\nLeonard o. Savitz, \"The Deterrent Influence of the Death\nPenalty\" by Karl F. Schuessler, \"Murder and the Death\nPenalty\" by E.H. Sutherland, \"Capital Punishment: A case for\nAbolition\" by Tidmarsh, Halloran and Connolly, \"Can the\nDeath Penalty Prevent Crime\" by George B. Vold and \"Findings\non Deterrence with Regard to Homicide\" by Wilkens and\nFeyerherm. Those studies, one and all, have taken the view\nthat \"statistical findings and case studies converge to\ndisprove the claim that the death penalty has any special\ndeterrent value\" and that death penalty \"fails as a\ndeterrent measure\". Arthur Koestler also observes in his\nbook on \"Reflections on Hanging\" that the figures obtained\nby him from various jurisdictions which have abolished\ncapital punishment showed a decline in the homicide rate\nfollowing abolition. The Report made by the Department of\nEconomic and Social Affairs of the United Nations also\nreaches the conclusion that \"the information assembled\nconfirms the now generally held opinion that the abolition\nor ..suspension of death penalty does not have the immediate\neffect of appreciably increasing the incidence of crime.\"\n\nThese various studies to which I have referred clearly\nestablish beyond doubt that death penalty does not have any\nspecial deterrent effect which life sentence does not posses\nand that in any event there is no evidence at all to suggest\nthat death penalty has any such special deterrent effect.\nThere is unfortunately no empirical study made in India\nto assess, howsoever imperfectly, the deterrent effect of\ndeath penalty. But we have the statistics of the crime of\nmurder in the former States of Travancore and Cochin during\nthe period when the capital punishment was on the statute\nbook as also during the period when it was kept in abeyance.\nThese figures have been taken by me from - the Introduction\nof Shri Mohan Kumar Mangalam to the book entitled \"Can the\nState Kill its Citizen\" brought out by Shri Subramaniam:\n\nStatistics of murder cases during the period when Capi-\ntal Punishment was kept in abeyance.\n\nYear Travancore Cochin Total for Travan-\ncore & Cochin\n1945 111 cases 22 133\n1946 135 cases 13 148\n1947 148-cases 26 174\n1948 160 cases 43 203\n1949 114 cases 26 140\n1950 125 cases 39 164\nTotal 793 169 962\n\nStatistics of murder cases during the period when capi-\ntal punishment was in vogue.\n\n1951 141 cases 47 188\n1952 133 cases 32 165\n1953 146 cases 54 200\n1954 114 cases 57 171\n1955 99 cases 30 129\n1956 97 cases 17 114\nTotal 730 237 967\nThese figures show that the incidence of the crime murder\ndid not A increase at all during the period of six years\nwhen the capital punishment was in abeyance. This is in line\nwith the experience of ether countries where death penalty\nhas been abolished.\n\nI must at this stage refer to the study carried out by\nEhrlich on which the strongest reliance has been placed by\nSarkaria, J. in the majority judgment. Ehrlich was the first\nto introduce regression analysis in an effort to isolate the\ndeath penalty effect, if it should exist, uncontaminated by\nother influences on the capital crirme rate. His paper was\ncatapulated into the centre of legal attention even before\nit was published, when the Solicitor General of the United\nStates cited it in laudatory terms in his brief in Fowler v.\nNorth Cerolina(l) and delivered copies of it to the court.\nThe Solicitor General called it an \"important empirical\nsupport for the a priori logical belief that use of the\ndeath penalty decrease the number of murders.\" In view of\nthe evidence available upto that time, Ehrlich's claim was\nindeed formidable both in substance and precision. The\nconclusion he reached was: \"an additional execution per -\nyear.. may have resulted in . seven or eight fewer murders.\"\nThe basic data from which he derived this conclusion were\nthe executions and the homicide rates as recorded in the\nUnited States during the years 1933 to 1969, the former\ngenerally decreasing, the latter, especially during the\nsixties, sharply increasing. Ehrlich considered\nsimultaneously with the execution and homicide rates, other\nvariables that could affect the capital crime rate and\nsought to isolate the effect of these variables through the\nprocess of regression analysis. It is not necessary for the\npurpose of the present judgment to explain this process of\nmathematical purification or the various technical\nrefinements of this process, but it is sufficient to point\nout that the conclusion reached by Ehrlich was that death\npenalty had a greater - deterrent effect than the fear of\nlife imprisonment. Ehrlich's study because it went against\nall the hitherto available evidence, received extra ordinary\nattention from the scholarly community.\n\nFirst, Peter Passell and John Taylor attempted to\nreplicate Ehrlich's findings and found that they stood\nscrutiny only under an unusually restrictive set of\ncircumstances. They found, for example that the appearance\nof deterrence is produced only when\nthe regression equation is in logarathmic form and in the\nmore conventional linear regression frame work, the\ndeterrent effect disappeared. They also found that no such\neffect emerged when data for the years after 1962 were\nomitted from the analysis and only the years 1953-61 were\nconsidered. Kenneth Avio of the University of Victoria made\nan effort to replicate Ehrlich's findings from Canadian\nexperience but that effort also failed and the conclusion\nreached by the learned jurist was that \"the evidence would\nappear to indicate that Canadian offenders over the period\n1926-60 did not behave in a manner consistent with an\neffective deterrent effect of capital punishment.\" William\nBowers and Glenn Pierce also made an attempt to replicate\nEhrlich's results and in replicating Ehrlich's work they\nconfirmed the Passel-Taylor findings that Ehrlich's results\nwere extremely sensitive as to whether the logarithmic\nspecification was used and whether the data for the latter\npart of 1960's were included. During 1975 the Yale Law\nJournal published a series of Articles reviewing the\nevidence on the deterrent effect of death penalty and in the\ncourse of an Article in this series, Ehrlich defended his\nwork by addressing himself to some of the criticism raised\nagainst his study. Hans Zeisel, Professor Emeritus of Law\nand Sociology in the University of Chicago points out in his\narticle on The deterrent effect of death penalty; Facts v.\nFaith that in this article contributed by him to the Yale\nLaw Journal, Ehrlich did refute some criticisms but the\ncrucial ones were not met. Ehrlich in this Article referred\nto a second study made by him, basing it this time on a\ncomparison by States for the years 1940 and 1950. He claimed\nthat this study bolstered his original thesis but conceded\nthat his findings were \"tentative and inconclusive\". In the\nmean time Passell made a State-by-State comparison for the\nyears 1950 and 1960 and as a result of his findings,\nconcluded that \"we know of no reasonable way of interpreting\nthe cross sections (i.e. State-by State) data that would\nlend support to the deterrence hypothesis.\"\n\nA particularly extensive review of Ehrlich's time\nseries analysis was made by a team led by Lawrence Klein,\nPresident of the American Economic Association. The authors\nfound serious methodological problems with Ehrlich's\nanalysis. They raised questions about his failure to\nconsider the feedback effect of crime on the economic\nvariables in his model, although he did consider other\nfeedback effects in his analysis. They found some of\nEhrlich's technical manipulations to be superfluous and\ntending to obscure the accuracy of his estimates. They, too,\nraised questions about\nvariables omitted from the analysis, and the effects of\nthese omissions on the findings.\n\nLike Passell-Taylor and Bowers-Pierce, Klein and his\ncollaborators replicated Ehrlich's results, using Ehrlich's\nown data which by that time he had made available. As in\nprevious replications, Ehrlich's results were found to be\nquite sensitive to the mathematical specification of the\nmodel and the inclusion of data at the recent end of the\ntime series.\n\nBy this time, Ehrlich's model had been demonstrated to\nbe peculiar enough. Klein went on to reveal further\ndifficulties. One was that Ehrlich's deterrence finding\ndisappeared after the introduction of a variable rejecting\nthe factors that caused other crimes to increase during the\nlatter part of the period of analysis. The inclusion of such\na variable would seem obligatory not only to substitute for\nthe factors that had obviously been omitted but also to\naccount for interactions between the crime rate and the\ndemographic characteristics of the population.\n\nKlein also found Ehrlich's results to be affected by an\nunusual construction of the execution rate variable, the\ncentral determinant of the analysis. Ehrlich constructed\nthis variable by using three other variables that appeared\nelsewhere in his regression model: the estimated homicide\narrest rate the estimated homicide conviction rate, and the\nestimated number of homicides. Klein showed that with this\nconstruction of the execution rate, a very small error in\nthe estimates of any of these three variables produced\nunusually strong spurious appearances of a deterrent effect.\nHe went on to show that the combined effect of such slight\nerrors in all three variables was likely to be considerable,\nand that in view of all these considerations, Ehrlich's\nestimates of the deterrent effect were so weak that they\n\"could be regarded as evidence.. (of) a counter deterrent\neffect of capital punishment.\" In view of these serious\nproblems with Ehrlich's analysis, Klein concluded: \"We see\ntoo many plausible explanations for his finding a deterrent\neffect other than the theory that capital punishment deters\nmurder\" and further observed: \"Ehrlich's results cannot be\nused at this time to pass judgment on the use of the death\npenalty.\"\n\nThis is the analysis of the subsequent studies of\nPassell and Taylor, Bowers and Pierce and Klein and his\ncolleagues made by Hans\nZeisel in his Article on \"The deterrent effect of the Death\nPenalty: Facts v. Faith\". These studies which were\ndefinitely more scientific and refined than Ehrlich's\ndemolish to a large extent the validity of the conclusion\nreached by Ehrlich and establish that death penalty does not\npossess an additional deterrent effect which life sentence\ndoes not. But, according to Hans Zeisel, the final blow to\nthe work of Ehrlich came from a study of Brian Forst, one of\nKlein's collaborators on the earlier study. Since it had\nbeen firmly established that the Ehrlich phenomenon, if it\nexisted emerged from developments during the sixties, Forst\nconcentrated on that decade. He found a rigorous way of\ninvestigating whether the ending of executions and the sharp\nincrease in homicides during this period was casual or\ncoincidental. The power of Forst's study derives from his\nhaving analysed changes both over time and across\njurisdictions. The aggregate United States time series data\nEhrlich used were unable to capture important regional\ndifferences. Moreover, they did not vary as much as cross-\nstate observations, hence they did not provide as rich an\nopportunity to infer the effect of changes in executions on\nhomicides. Forst's analysis, according to Hans Zeisel, was\nsuperior to Ehrlich's and it led to a conclusion that went\nbeyond that of Klein. \"The findings\" observed Forst \"give no\nsupport to the hypothesis that capital punishment deters\nhomicide\" and added: \"our finding that capital punishment\ndoes not deter homicide is remarkably robust with respect to\na wide range of alternative constructions.\" It will thus be\nseen that The validity of Ehrlich's study which has been\nrelied upon very strongly by Sarkaria J. in the majority\njudgment is considerably eroded by the studies carried out\nby leading criminologists such as Passell and Taylor, Bowers\nand Pierce, Klein and his colleagues and Forst and with the\ngreatest respect, I do not think that Sarkaria, J. speaking\non behalf of the majority was right in placing reliance on\nthat study. The validity, design and findings of that study\nhave been thoroughly discredited by the subsequent studies\nmade by these other econometricians and particularly by the\nvery scientific and careful study carried out by Forst. I\nmay point out that apart from Ehrlich's study there is not\none published econometric analysis which supports Ehrlich's\nresults.\n\nI may also at this stage refer once again to the\nopinion expressed ed by Professor Sellin. The learned\nProfessor after a serious and thorough study of the entire\nsubject in the United States on behalf\nof the American Law Institute stated his conclusion in these\nterms:\n\n\"Any one who carefully examines the above data is\nbound to arrive at the conclusion that the\ndeath penalty as we use it exercises no influence\non the extent or fluctuating rate of capital\ncrime. It has failed as a deterrent.\n\n(Emphasis supplied.)\nSo also in another part of the world very close to our\ncountry, a Commission of Inquiry on capital punishment was\nappointed by late Prime Minister Bhandarnaike of Shri Lanka\nand it reported:\n\n\"If the experience of the many countries which\nhave suspended or abolished capital punishment is taken\ninto account, there is in our view cogent evidence of\nthe unlikelihood of this 'hidden protection'...It is,\ntherefore, our view that the statistics of homicide in\nCeylon when related to the social changes since the\nsuspension of the death penalty in Ceylon and when\nrelated to the experience of other countries tend to\ndisprove the assumption of the uniquely deterrent\neffect of the death penalty, and that in deciding on\nthe question of reintroduction or abolition of the\ncapital punishment reintroduction cannot be justified\non the argument that it is a more effective deterrent\nto potential killers than the alternative or protracted\nimprisonment.\"\n\nIt is a strange irony of fate that Prime Minister\nBhandarnaike who suspended the death penalty in Sri Lanka\nwas himself murdered by a fanatic and in the panic that\nensued death penalty was reintroduced in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe evidence on whether the threat of death penalty has\na deterrent effect beyond the threat of life sentence is\ntherefore overwhelmingly on one side. Whatever be the\nmeasurement yardstick adopted and howsoever sharpened may be\nthe analytical instruments they have not been able to\ndiscover any special deterrent effect. Even regression\nanalysis, the most sophisticated of these instruments after\ncareful application by the scholarly community, has failed\nto detect special deterrent effect in death penalty which is\nnot to be found in life imprisonment. One answer which the\nprotagonists of\ncapital punishment try to offer to combat the inference\narising from these studies is that one cannot prove that\ncapital punishment does not deter murder because people who\nare deterred by it do not report good news to their police\ndepartments. They argue that there are potential murderers\nin our midst who would be deterred from killing by the death\npenalty, but would not be deterred by life imprisonment and\nthere is no possible way of knowing about them since these\npersons do not commit murder and hence are not identified.\nOr to use the words of Sarkaria, J. \"Statistics of deterred\npotential murderers are difficult to unravel as they remain\nhidden in the innermost recesses of their mind.\" But this\nargument is plainly a unsound and cannot be sustained. It is\nlike saying, for example, that we have no way of knowing\nabout traffic safety because motorists do not report when\nthey are saved from accidents by traffic safety programmes\nor devices. That however cannot stop us from evaluating the\neffectiveness of those programmes and devices by studying\ntheir effect on the accident rates where they are used for a\nreasonable time. Why use a different standard for evaluating\nthe death penalty, especially when we can measure its\neffectiveness by comparing homicide rates between countries\nwith similar social and economic conditions in some of which\ncapital punishment has been abolished and in others not or\nhomicide rates in the same country where death penalty has\nbeen abolished or subsequently reintroduced. There is no\ndoubt that if death penalty has a special deterrent effect\nnot possessed by life imprisonment, the number of those\ndeterred by capital punishment would appear statistically in\nthe homicide rates of abolitionist jurisdictions but\naccording to all the evidence gathered by different studies\nmade by jurists and criminologists, this is just not to be\nfound.\n\nThe majority speaking through Sarkaria, J. has observed\nthat \"in most of the countries of the world including India,\na very large segment of the population including noteable\npenologists, Judges, jurists, legislators and other\nenlightened people believe that death penalty for murder and\ncertain other capital offences does serve as a deterrent and\na greater deterrent than life imprisonment.\" I do not think\nthis statement represents the correct factual position. It\nis of course true that there are some penologists, judges,\njurists, legislators and other people who believe that death\npenalty acts as a greater deterrent but it would not be\ncorrect to say that they form a large segment of the\npopulation. The enlightened opinion in the world,\nas pointed out by me, is definitely veering round in favour\nof A abolition of death penalty. Moreover, it is not a\nrational conviction but merely an unreasoned belief which is\nentertained by some people including a few penologists,\njudges, jurists and legislators that death penalty has a\nuniquely deterrent effect. When you ask these persons as to\nwhat is the reason why they entertain this belief, they will\nnot be able to give any convincing answer beyond stating\nthat basically every human being dreads death and therefore\ndeath would naturally act as a greater deterrent than life\nimprisonment. That is the same argument advanced by Sir\nJames Fitz James Stephen, the draftsman of the\nIndian Penal\nCode\nin support of the deterrent effect of capital\npunishment. That great Judge and author said in his Essay on\nCapital Punishment:\n\n\"No other punishment deters men so effectually\nfrom committing crimes as the punishment of death. This\nis one of those propositions which it is difficult to\nprove simply because they are in themselves more\nobvious than any proof can make them. It is possible to\ndisplay ingenuity in arguing against it, but that is\nall. The whole experience of mankind is in the other\ndirection. The threat of instant death is the one to\nwhich resort has always been made when there was an\nabsolute necessity of producing some results.... No one\ngoes to certain inevitable death except by compulsion.\nPut the matter the other way, was there ever yet a\ncriminal who when sentenced to death and brought out to\ndie would refuse the offer of a commutation of a\nsentence for a severest secondary punishment ? Surely\nnot. Why is this ? It can only be because 'all that a\nman has will be given for his life'. In any secondary\npunishment, however terrible, there is hope, but death\nis death; its terrors - cannot be described more\nforcibly.\"\n\nThe Law Commission in its thirty-fifth report also\nrelied largely on this argument for taking the view that\n\"capital punishment does act as a deterrent.\" It set out the\nmain points that weighed with it in arriving at this\nconclusion and the first and foremost amongst them was that:\n\n\"Basically every human being dreads death\", suggesting that\ndeath penalty has therefore a greater deterrent effect than\nany other punishment. But this argument is not valid and a\nlittle scrutiny will reveal that it is wholly unfounded. In\nthe first place,\neven Sir James Fitz James Stephen concedes that the\nproposition that death penalty has a uniquely deterrent\neffect not possessed by any other punishment, is one which\nis difficult to prove, though according to him it is Self-\nevident. Secondly, there is a great fallacy underlying the\nargument of Sir James Stephen and the Law Commission. This\nargument makes no distinction between a threat of certain\nand imminent punishment which faces the convicted murderer\nand the threat of a different problematic punishment which\nmay or may not influence a potential murderer Murder may be\nunpremeditated under the stress of some sudden outburst of\nemotion or it may be premeditated after planning and\ndeliberation. Where the murder is unpremeditated, as for\nexample, where it is the outcome of a sudden argument or\nquarrel or provocation leading to uncontrollable anger or\ntemporary imbalance of the mind-and most murders fall within\nthis category-any thought of possibility of punishment is\nobliterated by deep emotional disturbance and the penalty of\ndeath can no more deter than any other penalty. Where murder\nis premeditated it may either be the result of lust,\npassion, jealousy hatred frenzy of frustration or it may be\na cold calculated murder for monetary or other\nconsideration. The former category of murder would conclude\nany possibility of deliberation or a weighing of\nconsequences, the thought of the likelihood of execution\nafter capture, trial and sentence would hardly enter the\nmind of the killer. So far as the latter category of murder\nis concerned, several considerations make it unlikely that\nthe death penalty would play any significant part in his\nthought. Since both the penalties for murder, death as well\nas life sentence, are so severe as to destroy the future of\nany one subjected to them, the crime would not be committed\nby a rational man unless he thinks that there is little\nchance of detection. What would weigh with him in such a\ncase is the uncertainty of detection and consequent\npunishment rather than the nature of punishment. It is not\nthe harshness or severity of death penalty which acts as a\ndeterrent. A life sentence of twenty years would act as an\nequally strong deterrent against crime as death penalty,\nprovided the killer feels that the crime would not go\nunpunished. More than the severity of the sentence, it is\nthe certainty of detection and punishment that acts as a\ndeterrent. The Advisory Council on the Treatment of\noffenders appointed by the Government of Great Britain\nstated in its report in 1960 \"We were impressed by the\nargument that the greatest deterrent to crime is not the\nfear of punishment but the\ncertainty Of detection.\" Professor Hart emphasized the same\npoint, refuting the argument of Sir James Fitz James Stephen\nin these words:\n\n\"This (Stephen's) estimate of the paramount place\nin human motivation of the fear of death reads\nimpressively but surely contains a suggestio falsi and\nonce this is detected its cogency as an argument in\nfavour of the death penalty for murder vanishes for\nthere is really no parallel between the situation of a\nconvicted murderer over the alternative of life\nimprisonment in the shadow of the gallows and the\nsituation of the murderer contemplating his crime. The\ncertainty of death is one thing, perhaps for normal\npeople nothing can be compared with it. But the\nexistence of the death penalty does not mean for the\nmurderer certainty of death now. It means not very high\nprobability of death in the future. And, futurity and\nuncertainty, the hope of an escape, rational or\nirrational, vastly diminishes the difference between\ndeath and imprisonment as , deterrent and may diminish\nto vanishing point... The way in which the convicted\nmurderer may view the immediate prospect of the gallows\nafter he has been caught, must be a poor guide to the\neffect of this prospect upon him when he is\ncontemplating committing his crime.\"\n\nIt is also a circumstance of no less significance bearing on\nthe question of detection effect of death penalty, that,\neven after detection and arrest, the likelihood of execution\nfor the murderer is almost nil. In the first place, the\nmachinery of investigation of offences being what it is and\nthe criminal law of our country having a tilt in favour of\nthe accused, the killer and look forward to a chance of\nacquittal at the trial. Secondly, even if the trial results\nin a conviction, it would not, in all probability, be\nfollowed by a sentence of ... , death. Whatever may have\nbeen the position prior to the enactment of the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n, 1973, it is now clear that under section\n354 sub-section (3), life sentence is the rule and it is\nonly in exceptional cases for special reasons that death\nsentence may be awarded. The entire drift of the legislation\nis against infliction of death penalty and the courts are\nmost reluctant to impose it save in the rarest of rare\ncases. It is interesting to note that in the last 2 years,\nalmost every case where death penalty is confirmed by the\nHigh Court has come up before this Court by way of petition\nfor\nspecial leave, and, barring the case of Ranga and Billa, I\ndo not think there is a single case in which death penalty\nhas been affirmed by this Court. There have been numerous\ncases where even after special leave petitions against\nsentence of death were dismissed, review petitions have been\nentertained and death sentence commuted by this Court. Then\nthere is also the clemency power of the President under\n\nArticle 72\nand of the Governor under\nArticle 161\nof the\nConstitution and in exercise of this power, death sentence\nhas been commuted by the President or the Governor, as the\ncase may be, in a number of cases. The chances of imposition\nof death sentence following upon a conviction for the\noffence of murder are therefore extremely slender. This is\nalso evident from the figures supplied to a us by the\nGovernment of India for the years 1974 to 1978 pursuant to\nthe inquiry made by us. During the course of the hearing, we\ncalled upon the Government of India to furnish us\nstatistical information in regard to following three\nmatters, namely, (i) the number of cases in which and the\nnumber of persons on whom death sentence was imposed and\nwhose death sentence was confirmed by various High Courts in\nIndia; (ii) the number of cases in which death sentence was\nexecuted in the various States and the various Union\nTerritories; and (iii) the number of cases in which death\nsentence was commuted by the President of India under\n\nArticle 72\nor by the Governors under\nArticle 161\nof the\nConstitution. The statistical information sought by us was\nsupplied by the Government of India and our attention was\nalso drawn to the figures showing the total number of\noffences of murder committed inter alia during the years\n1974-77. These figures showed that on an average about\n17,000 offences of murder were committed in India every year\nduring the period 1974 to 1977, and if we calculate on the\nbasis of this average, the total number of offences of\nmurder during the period of five years from 1974 to 1978\nwould come to about 85,000. Now, according to the\nstatistical information supplied by the Government of India,\nout of these approximately 85,000 case of murder, there were\nonly 288 in which death sentence was imposed by the sessions\ncourt and confirmed by the High Courts and out of them, in\n12 cases death sentence was commuted by the President and in\n40 cases, by the Governors and death sentence was executed\nin only 29 cases. It will thus be seen that during the\nperiod of five years from 1974 to 1978, there was an\ninfinitesingly small number of cases, only 29 out of an\naggregate number of approximately 85,000 cases of murder, in\nwhich death sentence was executed. Of course, the figures\nsupplied by the\nGovernment of India did not include the figures from the\nStates of A Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal and Delhi\nAdministration but the figures from these three States and\nfrom the Union Territory of Delhi would not make any\nappreciable difference. It is obvious therefore that even\nafter conviction in a trial, there is high degree of\nprobability that death sentence may not be imposed by the\nsessions court and even If death sentence is imposed by the\nsessions court, it may not be confirmed by the High Court\nand even after confirmation by the High Court, it may not be\naffirmed by this Court and lastly, even if affirmed by this\nCourt, it may be commuted by the President of India under\n\nArticle 72\nor by the Governor under\nArticle 161\nof the\nConstitution in exercise of the power of clemency. The\npossibility of execution pursuant to a sentence of death is\ntherefore almost negligible, particularly after the\nenactment of section 354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n1973 and it is difficult to see how in\nthese circumstances death penalty can ever act as a\ndeterrent. The knowledge that . death penalty is rarely\nimposed and almost certainly, it will not be imposed takes\naway whatever deterrent value death penalty might otherwise\nhave. The expectation, bordering almost on certainty, that\ndeath sentence is, extremely unlikely to be imposed is a\nfactor that would condition the behaviour of the offender\nand death penalty cannot in such a situation have any\ndeterrent effect. The risk of death penalty being remote and\nimprovable, it cannot operate as a greater deterrent than\nthe threat of life imprisonment. Justice Brennan and Justice\nWhite have also expressed the same view in Furman v. Georgia\n(supra), namely, that, when infrequently and arbitrarily\nimposed, death penalty is not a greater deterrent to murder\nthan is life imprisonment.\n\nThe majority speaking through Sarkaria, J. has referred\nto a few decisions of this Court in which, according to\nmajority Judges, the deterrent value of death penalty has\nbeen judicially recognised. But I do not think any reliance\ncan be placed on the observations in these decisions in\nsupport of the view that death penalty has a uniquely\ndeterrent effect. The learned Judges who made these\nobservations did not have any socio-legal data before them\non the basis of which they could logically come to the\nconclusion that death penalty serves as a deterrent. They\nmerely proceeded upon an impressionistic in view which is\nentertained by quite a few lawyers, judges and legislators\nwithout any scientific investigation or empiri-\ncal research to support it. It appears to have been assumed\nby these learned judges that death penalty has an additional\ndeterrent effect which life sentence does not possess. In\nfact, the learned judges were-not concerned in these\ndecisions to enquire and determine whether death penalty has\nany special deterrent effect and therefore if they proceeded\non any such assumption, it cannot be said that by doing so\nthey judicially recognised the deterrent value of death\npenalty. It is true that in\nJagmohan\n's case (supra) Palekar\nJ. speaking on behalf of the court did take the view that\ndeath penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect but I do Dot\nthink that beyond a mere traditional belief the validity of\nwhich cannot be demonstrated either by logic or by reason,\nthere is any cogent and valid argument put forward by the\nlearned Judge in support of the view that death sentence has\ngreater deterrent effect than life sentence. The majority\njudges have relied on some of the observations of Krishna\nIyer, J. but it must not be forgotten that Krishna Iyer, J.\nhas been one of the strongest opponents of death penalty and\nhe has pleaded with passionate conviction for 'death\nsentence on death sentence'.\n\nIn\nDalbir Singh & Ors. v. State\nof Punjab\n(supra) he emphatically rejected the claim of\ndeterrence in most unequivocal terms: \".. the humanity of\nour Constitution historically viewed (does not) subscribe to\nthe hysterical assumption or facile illusion that a crime\nfree society will dawn if hangmen and firing squads were\nkept feverishly busy.\" It would not be right to rely on\nstray or casual observations of Krishna Iyer, J. in support\nof the thesis that death penalty has a uniquely deterrent\neffect. It would be doing grave injustice to him and to the\nideology for which he stands. In fact, the entire basis of\nthe judgment of Krishna Iyer, J. in Rajendra Prasad's is\nthat death penalty has not deterrent value and that is only\nwhere the killer is found to be a social monster or a beast\nincapable of reformation that he can be liquidated out of\nexistence. Chinnappa Reddy, J. has also in Bishnu Deo Shaw's\ncase (supra) taken the view that \"there is no positive\nindication that the death penalty has been deterrent\" or in\nother words, \"the efficacy of the death penalty as a\ndeterrent is unproven.\"\n\nThen reliance has been placed by Sarkaria, J. speaking\non behalf of the majority on the observations of Stewart, J.\nin Furman v. Georgia (supra) where the learned Judge took\nthe view that death penalty serves a deterrent as well as\nretributive purpose. In his view, certain criminal conduct\nis so atrocious that society's interest in deterrence and\nretribution wholly outweighs any considerations\nof reform or rehabilitation of the perpetrator and that,\ndespite the on conclusive empirical evidence, only penalty\nof death will provide maximum deterrence. It has also been\npointed out by Sarkaria, J. that in Gregg v. Georgia (supra)\nStewart, J. reiterated the same view in regard to the\ndeterrent and retributive effect of death penalty. But the\nview taken by Stewart, J. cannot be regarded as decisive of\nthe present question as to the deterrent effect of death\npenalty. It is just one view like any other and its validity\nhas to be tested on the touchstone of logic and reason. It\ncannot be accepted merely because it is the view of an\neminent judge, I find that as against the view taken by him,\nthere is a contrary view taken by at least two judges of the\nUnited States Supreme Court, namely. Brennan J. and Marshall\nJ. who were convinced in Gregg v. Georgia (supra) that\n\"capital punishment is not necessary as a deterrent to crime\nin our society.\" It is natural differing judicial\nobservations supporting one view or the other that these\nshould be particularly on a sensitive issue like this, but\nwhat is necessary is to examine objectively and critically\nthe logic and rationale behind these observations and to\ndetermine for ourselves which observations represent the\ncorrect view that should find acceptance with us. The\nmajority Judges speaking through Sarkaria, J. have relied\nupon the observations of Stewart, J. as also on the\nobservations made by various other Judges and authors for\nthe purpose of concluding that when so many eminent persons\nhave expressed the view that capital punishment is necessary\nfor the protection of society, how can it be said that it is\narbitrary and unreasonable and does not serve any rational\npenological purpose. It has been observed by Sarkaria, J:\n\n\"It is sufficient to say that the very fact that persons of\nreason, learning and light are rationally and deeply divided\nin their opinion on this issue, is a ground among others,\nfor rejecting the petitioners' argument that retention of\ndeath penalty in the impugned provision, is totally devoid\nof reason and purpose. If, notwithstanding the view of the\nAbolitionists to the contrary, a very large segment of\npeople, the world over, including sociologists legislators,\njurists, judges and administrators still firmly believe in\nthe worth and necessity of capital punishment for the\nprotection of society......it is not possible to hold that\nthe provision of death penalty as an alternative punishment\nfor murder is unreasonable and not in the public interest. I\nfind it difficult to accept this argument which proceeds\nupon the hypothesis that merely because some lawyers, judges\nand jurists are of the opinion that death penalty\nsub-serves a penological goal and is therefore in public\ninterest, the court must shut its eyes in respectful\ndeference to the views expressed by these scholars and\nrefuse to examine whether their views are correct or not. It\nis difficult to understand how the court, when called upon\nto determine a vital issue of fact, can surrender its\njudgment to the views of a few lawyers, judges and jurists\nand hold that because such eminent persons have expressed\nthese views, there must be some substance in what they say\nand the provision of death penalty as an alternative\npunishment for murder cannot therefore be regarded as\narbitrary and unreasonable. It is to my mind inconceivable\nthat a properly informed judiciary concerned to uphold\nFundamental Rights should decline to come to its own\ndetermination of a factual dispute relevant to the issue\nwhether death penalty serves a legitimate penological\npurpose and rest its decision only on the circumstance that\nthere are sociologists, legislators, judges and jurists who\nfirmly believe in the worth and necessity of capital\npunishment. The court must on the material before it find\nwhether the views expressed by lawyers, judges, jurists and\ncriminologists on one side or the other are well founded in\nlogic and reason and accept those which appear to it to be\ncorrect and sound. The Court must always remember that it is\ncharged by the Constitution to act as a sentinel on the qui\nvive guarding the fundamental rights guaranteed by the\nConstitution and it cannot shirk its responsibility by\nobserving that since there are strong divergent views on the\nsubject, the court need not express any categorical opinion\none way or the other as to which of these two views is\ncorrect. Hence it is that, in the discharge of my\nconstitutional duty of protecting and upholding the right to\nlife which is perhaps the most basic of all human rights, I\nhave examined the rival views and come to the p conclusion,\nfor reasons which I have already discussed, that death\npenalty has no uniquely deterrent effect and does not serve\na penological purpose. But even if we proceed on the\nhypothesis that the opinion in regard to the deterrent\neffect of death penalty is divided and it is not possible to\nsay which opinion is right and which opinion is wrong, it is\nobvious that, in this state of affairs, it cannot be said to\nbe proved that death penalty has an additional deterrent\neffect not possessed by life sentence and if that be so, the\nlegislative provision for imposition of death penalty as\nalternative punishment for murder fail, since, as already\npointed out above, the burden of showing that death penalty\nhas a uniquely deterrent effect and therefore serves a\npenological goal is on the State and\nif the State fails to discharge this burden which lies upon\nit, death penalty as alternative punishment for murder must\nbe held to be arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\nThe majority Judges have, in the Judgment of Sarkaria,\nJ. placed considerable reliance on the 35th Report of the\nLaw Commission and I must therefore briefly refer to that\nReport before I part with this point. The Law Commission set\nout in their Report the following main points that weighed\nwith them in arriving at the conclusion that capital\npunishment does act as a deterrent:\n\n(a) Basically, every human being dreads death.\n\n(b) Death, as a penalty, stands on a totally different\nlevel from imprisonment for life or any other\npunishment. The difference is one of quality, and\nnot merely of degree.\n\n(c) Those who are specifically qualified to express an\nopinion on the subject, including particularly the\nmajority of the replies received from State\nGovernments, Judges, Members of Parliament and\nlegislatures and Members of the Bar and police\nofficers-are definitely of the view that the\ndeterrent object of capital punishment is achieved\nin a fair measure in India.\n\n(d) As to conduct of prisoners released from jail\n(after under going imprisonment for life), it\nwould be difficult lo come to a conclusion,\nwithout studies extending over a long period of\nyears.\n\n(e) Whether any other punishment can possess all the\nadvantages of capital punishment is a matter of\ndoubt.\n\n(f) Statistics of other countries are inconclusive on\nthe subject. If they are not regarded as proving\nthe deterrent effect, neither can they be regarded\nas conclusively disproving it.\n\nSo far as the first argument set out in clause (a) is\nconcerned, I have already shown that the circumstance that\nevery human being dreads\ndeath cannot lead to the inference that death penalty act as\na deterrent. The statement made in clause (b) is perfectly\ncorrect and I agree with they Law Commission that death as a\npenalty stands on a totally different level from life\nimprisonment and the difference between them is one of\nquality and not merely of degree, but I fail to see how from\nthis circumstance an inference can necessarily follow that\ndeath penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect. Clause (c)\nsets out that those who are specially qualified to express\nan opinion on the subject have in their replies to the\nquestionnaire stated their definite view that the deterrent\neffect of capital punishment is achieved in a fair measure\nin India. It may be that a large number of persons who sent\nreplies to the questionnaire issued by the Law Commission\nmight have expressed the view that death penalty does act as\na deterrent in our country, but mere expression of opinion\nin reply to the questionnaire, unsupported by reasons,\ncannot have any evidenciary value. There are quite a number\nof people in this country who still nurture the\nsuperstitions and irrational belief, ingrained in their\nminds by a century old practice of imposition of capital\npunishment and fostered, though not consciously, by the\ninstinct for retribution, that death penalty alone can act\nas an effective deterrent against the crime of murder. I\nhave already demonstrated how this belief entertained by\nlawyers, judges, legislators and police officers is a myth\nand it has no basis in logic or reason. In fact, the\nstatistical research to which I have referred completely\nfalsifies this belief. Then, there are the arguments in\nclauses (d) and (e) but these arguments even according to\nthe Law Commission itself are inconclusive and it is\ndifficult to see how they can be relied upon to support the\nthesis that capital punishment acts as a deterrent. The Law\nCommission states in clause (f) that statistics of other\ncountries are inconclusive on the subject. I do not agree. I\nhave already dealt with this argument and shown that the\nstatistical studies carried out by various jurists and\ncriminologists clearly disclose That there is no evidence at\nall to suggest that death penalty acts as a deterrent and it\nmust therefore be held on the basis of the available\nmaterial that death penalty does not act as a deterrent. But\neven if we accept the proposition that the statistical\nstudies are inconclusive and they cannot be regarded as\nproving that death penalty has no deterrent effect, it is\nclear that at the same time they also do not establish that\ndeath penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect and in this\nsituation, the burden of establishing that death penalty has\nan additional deterrent effect which life sentence does not\nhave and therefore serves a penological purpose\nbeing on the State, it must held that the State has failed\nto discharge the burden which rests upon it and death\npenalty must therefore be held to be arbitrary and\nunreasonable.\n\nThere was also one other argument put forward by the\nLaw Commission in its 35th Report and that argument was that\nhaving regard to the conditions in India to the variety of\nsocial up-bringing of its inhabitants, to the disparity in\nthe level of morality and education in the country, to the\nvastness of its area, to the diversity of its population and\nto the paramount Deed to maintain law and order in the\ncountry at the present juncture, India cannot risk the\nexperiment of abolition of capital punishment. This argument\ndoes not commend itself to me as it is based more on fear\npsychosis than on reason. It is difficult to see how any of\nthe factors referred to by the Law Commission, barring the\nfactor relating to the need to maintain law and order, can\nhave any relevance to the question of deterrent effect of\ncapital punishment. I cannot subscribe to the opinion that,\nbecause the social upbringing of the people varies from\nplace to place or from class to class or there are\ndemographic diversities and variations, they tend to\nincrease the incidence of homicide and even if they do, I\nfail to see how death penalty can counter act the effect of\nthese factors. It is true that the level of education in our\ncountry is low, because our developmental process started\nonly after we became politically free, but it would be\ngrossly unjust to say that uneducated people are more prone\nto crime than the educated ones. I also cannot agree that\nthe level of morality which prevails amongst our people is\nlow. I firmly hold the view that the large bulk of the\npeople in our country, barring only a few who occupy\npositions of political, administrative or economic power,\nare actuated by a high sense of moral and ethical values. In\nfact, if we compare the rate of homicide in India with that\nin the United States, where there is greater homogeneity in\npopulation and the level of education is fairly high, we\nfind that India compares very favourably with the United\nStates. The rate of homicide for the year 1952 was 4.7 in\nthe United States as against the rate of only 2.9 in India\nper 1,00,000 population and the figures for the year 1960\nshow that the rate of homicide in the United States was 5.1\nas against the rate of only 2.5 in India per 1,00,000\npopulation. The comparative figures for the year 1967 also\nconfirm that the rate of homicide per 1,00,000 population in\nthe United States was definitely higher than that in India\nbecause in the United States it was 6.1\nwhile in India it was only 2.6. It is therefore obvious\nthat, despite the existence of the factors referred to by\nthe Law Commission, the conditions in India, in so far as\nthe rate of homicide is concerned, are definitely better\nthan in the United States and I do not see how these factors\ncan possibly justify an apprehension that it may be risky to\nabolish capital punishment. There is in fact statistical\nevidence to show that the attenuation of the area in which\ndeath penalty may be imposed and the remoteness and\ninfrequency of abolition of death penalty have not resulted\nin increase in the rate of homicide. The figures which were\nplaced before us on behalf of the Union clearly show that\nthere was no increase in the rate of homicide even though\ndeath sentence was made awardable only in exceptional cases\nunder section 354 sub-section (3) of the new\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n1973. I must therefore express my\nrespectful dissent from the view taken by the Law Commission\nthat the experiment of abolition of capital punishment,\nwould involve a certain element of risk to the law and order\nsituation.\n\nIt will thus be seen that death penalty as provided\nunder\nsection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code read with section\n354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973\ndoes not subserve any legitimate end of punishment, since by\nkilling the murderer it totally rejects the reformative\npurpose and it has no additional deterrent effect which life\nsentence does not possess and it is therefore not justified\nby the deterrence theory of punishment. Though retribution\nor denunciation is regarded by some as a proper end of\npunishment. I do not think, for reasons I have already\ndiscussed, that it can have any legitimate place in an\nenlightened philosophy of punishment. It must therefore be\nheld that death penalty has no rational nexus with any\nlegitimate penological goal or any rational penological\npurpose and it is arbitrary and irrational and hence\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\nI must now turn to consider the attack against the\nconstitutional validity of death penalty provided under\n\nsection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code read with section 354\nsub-section (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 on\nthe ground that these sections confer an unguided and\nstandardless discretion on the court whether to liquidate an\naccused out of existence or to let him continue to live and\nthe vesting of such discretion in the court renders the\ndeath penalty arbitrary and freakish. This ground of\nchallenge is in my opinion well founded and it furnishes one\nadditional reason\nwhy the death penalty must be struck down as violative of\nArticles A 14 and 21. It is obvious on a plain reading of\n\nsection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code which provides death\npenalty as alternative punishment for murder that it leaves\nit entirely to the discretion of Court whether to impose\ndeath sentence or to award only life imprisonment to an\naccused convicted of the offence of murder. This section\ndoes not lay down any standards or principles to guide the\ndiscretion of the Court in the matter of imposition of death\npenalty. The critical choice between physical liquidation\nand life long incarceration is left to the discretion of the\ncourt and no legislative light is shed as to how this deadly\ndiscretion is to be exercised. The court is left free to\nnavigate in an uncharted sea without any com- pass or\ndirectional guidance. The respondents sought to find some\nguidance in section 354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n1973 but I fail to see how that section\ncan be of any help at all in providing guidance in the\nexercise of discretion. On the contrary it makes the\nexercise of discretion more difficult and uncertain. Section\n354 sub-section (3) provides that in case of offence of\nmurder, life sentence shall be the rule and it is only in\nexceptional cases for special reasons that death penalty may\nbe awarded. But what are the special reasons for which the\ncourt may award death penalty is a matter on which section\n354 sub-section (3) is silent nor is any guidance in that\nbehalf provided by any other provision of law. It is left to\nthe Judge to grope in the dark for himself and in the\nexercise of his unguided and unfettered discretion decide\nwhat reasons may be considered as 'special reasons'\njustifying award of death penalty and whether in a given\ncase any such special reasons exist which should persuade\nthe court to depart from the normal rule and inflict death\npenalty on the accused. There being no legislative policy or\nprinciple to guide the court in exercising its discretion in\nthis delicate and sensitive area of life and death, the\nexercise of discretion of the Court is bound to vary from\njudge to judge. What may appear as special reasons to one\njudge may not so appear to another and the decision in a\ngiven case whether to impose the death sentence or to let\noff the offender only with life imprisonment would, to a\nlarge extent, depend upon who is the judge called upon to\nmake the decision. The reason for this uncertainty in the\nsentencing process is two-fold. Firstly, the nature of the\nsentencing process is such that it involves a highly\ndelicate task calling for skills and talents very much\ndifferent from those ordinarily expected of lawyers. This\nwas pointed out clearly\nand emphatically by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the course of\nthe evidence he gave before the Royal Commission on Capital\nPunishment:\n\n\"I myself think that the bench-we lawyers who be\ncome Judges-are not very competent, are not qualified\nby experience, to impose sentence where any discretion\nis to be exercised. I do not think it is in the domain\nof the training of lawyers to know what to do with a\nfellow after you find out he is a thief. I do not think\nlegal training has given you any special competence. I,\nmyself, hope that one of these days, and before long,\nwe will divide the functions of criminal justice. I\nthink the lawyers are people who are competent to\nascertain whether or not a crime has been committed.\nThe whole scheme of common law judicial machinery-the\nrule of evidence, the ascertainment of what is relevant\nand what is irrelevant and what is fair, the whole\nquestion of whether you can introduce prior crimes in\norder to prove intent-I think lawyers are peculiarly\nfitted for that task. But all the questions that follow\nupon ascertainment of guilt, I- think require very\ndifferent and much more diversified talents than the\nlawyers and judges are normally likely to possess.\"\n\nEven if considerations relevant to capital sentencing were\nprovided by the legislature, it would be a difficult\nexercise for the judges to decide whether to impose the\ndeath penalty or to award the life sentence. But without any\nsuch guidelines given By the legislature, the task of the\njudges becomes much more arbitrary and the sentencing\ndecision is bound to vary with each judge. Secondly, when\nunguided discretion is conferred upon the Court to choose\nbetween life and death, by providing a totally vague and\nindefinite criterion of 'special reasons' without laying\ndown any principles or guidelines for determining what\nshould be considered To be 'special reasons', the choice is\nbound to be influenced by the subjective philosophy of the\njudge called upon to pass the sentence and on his value\nsystem and social philosophy will depend whether the accused\nshall live or die. No doubt the judge will have to give\n'special reasons' if he opts in favour of inflicting the\ndeath penalty, H-but that does not eliminate arbitrariness\nand caprice, firstly because there being no guidelines\nprovided by the legislature, the reasons\nwhich may appeal to one judge as 'special reasons' may not\nappeal to another, and secondly, because reasons can always\nbe found for a conclusion that the judge instinctively\nwishes to reach and the judge can bonafide and\nconscientiously find such reason to be 'special reasons'. It\nis now recognised on all hands that judicial conscience is\nnot a fixed conscience; it varies from judge to judge depen-\nding upon his attitudes and approaches, his predilections-\nand prejudices, his habits of mind and thought and in short\nall that goes with the expression \"social philosophy\". We\nlawyers and judges like to cling to the myth that every\ndecision which we make in the exercise of our judicial\ndiscretion is guided exclusively by legal principles and we\nrefuse to admit the subjective element in judicial decision\nmaking. But that myth now stands exploded and it is\nacknowledged by jurists that the social philosophy of the\njudge plays a not inconsiderable part in moulding his\njudicial decision and particularly the exercise of judicial\ndiscretion. There is nothing like complete objectivity in\nthe decision making process and especially so, when this\nprocess involves making of decision in the exercise of\njudicial discretion. Every judgment necessarily bears the\nimpact of the attitude and approach of the judge and his\nsocial value system. It would be pertinent here to quote\nJustice Cardozo's analysis of the mind of a Judge in his\nfamous lectures on \"Nature of Judicial Process\":\n\n\"We are reminded by William James in a telling\npage of his lectures on Pragmatism that every one of us\nhas in truth an underlying philosophy of life, even\nthose of us to whom the names and the notions of\nphilosophy are unknown or anathema. There is in each of\nus a stream of y tendency, whether you choose to call\nit philosophy or not, which gives coherence and\ndirection to thought and ' t action. Judges cannot\nescape that current any more than other mortals. All\ntheir lives, forces which they do not recognize and\ncannot name, have been tugging at them- inherited\ninstincts, traditional beliefs, acquired convictions; -\nand the resultant is an outlook on life, a conception\nof ' social needs, a sense in Jame's phrase of 'the\ntotal push and pressure of the cosmos,' which when\nreasons are nicely balanced, must determine where\nchoice shall fall. In this mental background every\nproblem finds its setting. We l may try to see things\nas objectively as we please. None-\ntheless, we can never see them with any eyes except our\nown.\"\n\nIt may be noted that the human mind, even at infancy, is no\nblank sheet of paper. We are born with predisposition and\nthe process of education, formal and informal, and, our own\nsubjective experiences create attitudes which effect us in\njudging situations and coming to decisions. Jerome Frank\nsays in his book; \"Law and the Modern Mind\", in an\nobservation with which I find myself in entire agreement:\n\n\"Without acquired 'slants' preconceptions, life\ncould not go on. Every habit constitutes a pre-\njudgment; were those pre-judgments which we call habits\nabsent in any person, were he obliged to treat every\nevent as an unprecedented crisis presenting a wholly\nnew problem, he would go mad. Interests, points of\nview, preferences, are the essence of living. Only\ndeath yields complete dispassionateness, for such\ndispassionateness signifies utter indifference.. An\n'open mind' in the sense of a mind containing no pre-\nconceptions whatever, would be a mind incapable of\nlearning anything, would be that of an utterly emotion-\nless human being.\"\n\nIt must be remembered that \"a Judge does not shed the\nattributes of common humanity when be assumes the ermine.\"\nThe ordinary human mind is a mass of pre-conceptions\ninherited and acquired, often unrecognised by their\npossessor. \"Few minds are as neutral as a sheet of plain\nglass and indeed a mind of that quality may actually fail in\njudicial- efficiency, for the warmer tints of imagination\nand sympathy are needed to temper the cold light of reason,\nif human justice is to be done.\" It is, therefore, obvious\nthat when a Judge is called upon to exercise his discretion\nas to whether the accused shall be killed or shall be\npermitted to live, his conclusion would depend to a large\nextent on his approach and attitude, his predilections and\npre-conceptions, his value system and social philosophy and\nhis response to the evolving norms of decency and newly\ndeveloping concepts and ideas in penological jurisprudence.\nOne Judge may have faith in the Upanishad doctrine that\nevery human being is an embodiment of the Divine and he may\nbelieve with Mahatma Gandhi that every offender can be\nreclaimed\nand transformed by love and it is immoral and unethical to\nkill him, while another Judge may believe that it is\nnecessary for social defence that the offender should be put\nout of way and that no mercy should be shown to him who did\nnot show mercy to another. One Judge may feel that the\nNaxalites, though guilty of murders, . are dedicated souls\ntotally different from ordinary criminals as they are\nmotivated not by any self-interest but by a burning desire\nto bring about a revolution by eliminating vested interests\nand should not therefore be put out of corporeal existence\nwhile another Judge may take the view that the Naxalities\nbeing guilty of cold premeditated murders are a menace to\nthe society and to innocent men and women and therefore\ndeserve to be liquidated. The views of Judges as to what may\nbe regarded as 'special reasons' are bound to differ from\nJudge to Judge depending upon his value system and social\nphilosophy with the result that whether a person shall live\nor die depends very much upon the composition of the bench.\nwhich tries his case and this renders the imposition of\ndeath penalty arbitrary and capricious.\n\nNow this conclusion reached by me is not based merely\non theoretical or a priori considerations. On an analysis of\ndecisions given over a period of years we find that in fact\nthere is no uniform pattern of judicial behaviour in the\nimposition of death penalty and the judicial practice does\nnot disclose any coherent guidelines for ' the award of\ncapital punishment. The Judges have been awarding death\npenalty or refusing to award it according to their own scale\nof values and social philosophy and it is not possible to\ndiscern any consistent approach to the problem in the\njudicial decisions. It is p apparent from a study of the\njudicial decisions that some Judges are readily and\nregularly inclined to sustain death sentences, other are .\nsimilarly disinclined and the remaining waver from case to\ncase. Even in the Supreme Court there are divergent\nattitudes and opinions in regard to the imposition of\ncapital punishment. If a case comes before one Bench\nconsisting of Judges who believe in the social efficacy of\ncapital punishment, the death sentence would in all\nprobability be confirmed but if the same case comes before\nanother Bench consisting of Judges who are morally and\nethically against the death penalty, the death sentence\nwould most likely be commuted to life imprisonment. The\nformer would find and I say this not in any derogatory or\ndisparaging sense, but as a consequence of psychological and\nattitudinal factors operating on the\nminds of the Judges constituting the Bench-'special reasons'\nin the case to justify award of death penalty while the\nlatter would reject any such reasons as special reasons. It\nis also quite possible that one Bench may, having regard to\nits perceptions, think that there are special reasons in the\ncase for which death penalty should be awarded while another\nBench may bonafide and conscientiously take a different view\nand hold that there are no special reasons and that only\nlife sentence should be imposed and it may not be possible\nto assert objectively and logically as to who is right and\nwho is wrong, because the exercise of discretion in a case\nof this kind, where no broad standards or guidelines are\nsupplied by the legislature, is bound to be influenced by\nthe subjective attitude and approach of the Judges\nconstituting the Bench, their value system, individual tone\nof their mind, the colour of their experience and the\ncharacter and variety of their interests and their\npredispositions. This arbitrariness in the imposition of\ndeath penalty is considerably accentuated by the fragmented\nbench structure of our Courts where benches are inevitably\nformed with different permutations and combinations from\ntime to time and cases relating to the offence of murder\ncome up for hearing sometimes before one Bench, sometimes\nbefore another sometimes before a third and so on. Prof.\nBlackshield has in his Article on 'Capital Punishment in\nIndia' published in Volume 21 of the Journal of the Indian\nLaw Institute pointed out how the practice of bench\nformation contributes to arbitrariness in the imposition of\ndeath penalty. It is well-known that so far as the Supreme\nCourt is concerned, while the number of Judges has increased\nover the years, the number of Judges on Benches which hear\ncapital punishment cases has actually decreased. Most cases\nare now heard by two judge Benches. Prof. Blackshield has\nabstracted 70 cases in which the Supreme Court had to choose\nbetween life and death while sentencing an accused for the\noffence of murder and analysing these 70 cases he has\npointed out that during the period 28th April 1972 to 8th\nMarch 1976 only eleven Judges of the Supreme Court\nparticipated in 10% or more of the cases. He has listed\nthese eleven Judges in an ascending order of leniency based\non the proportion for each Judge of plus votes (i.e. votes\nfor the death sentence) to total votes and pointed out that\nthese statistics show how the judicial response to the\nquestion of life and death varies for judge to judge.\" It is\nsignificant to note that out of 70 cases analysed by Prof.\nBlackshield, 37 related to the period subsequent to the\ncoming into force of section 354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode\nof Criminal Procedure\n1973.\nIf a similar\nexercise is performed with reference to cases decided by the\nSupreme A Court after 8th March 1976, that being the date\nupto which the survey carried out by Prof. Blackshield was\nlimited, the analysis will x reveal the same pattern of\nincoherence and arbitrariness, the decision to kill or not\nto kill being guided to a large extent by the com position\nof the Bench. Take for example Rajendra Prasad's case\n(supra) decided on 9th February 1979. In this case, the\ndeath sentence imposed on Rajendra Prasad was commuted to\nlife imprisonment by a majority consisting of Krishna Iyer,\nJ. and Desai, J.A.P. Sen, J. dissented and was of the view\nthat the death sentence should be confirmed. Similarly in\none of the cases before us, namely,\nBachan Singh v. State of\nPunjab\n,(l) when it was first heard by a Bench consisting of\nKailasam and Sarkaria, JJ., Kailasam, J. was definitely of\nthe view that the majority decision in . Rajendra Prasad's\ncase was wrong and that is why 'he referred that case to\nthe Constitution Bench.\n\nSo also in\nDalbir Singh v. State of\nPunjab\n(supra), the majority consisting of Krishna Iyer, J.\nand Desai, J. took the view that the death sentence imposed\non Dalbir Singh should be commuted to life imprisonment\nwhile A.P. Sen, J. struck to the original view taken by him\nin\nRajendra Prasad\n's case and was inclined to confirm the\ndeath sentence. It will thus be seen that the exercise of\ndiscretion whether to inflict death penalty or not depends\nto a considerable extent on the value system and social\nphilosophy of the Judges constituting the Bench.\n\nThe most striking example of freakishness in imposition\nof death penalty is provided by a recent case which involved\nthree accused, namely, Jeeta Singh, Kashmira Singh and\nHarbans Singh. These three persons were sentenced to death\nby the Allahabad High Court by a judgment and order dated\n20th October 1975 for playing an equal part in jointly\nmurdering a family of four persons. Each of these three\npersons preferred a separate petition in the Supreme Court\nfor special leave to appeal against the common judgment\nsentencing them all to death penalty. The special leave\npetition of Jeeta Singh came up for hearing before a bench\nconsisting of Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) Krishna Iyer,\nJ. and N.L. Untwalia, J. and it was dismissed on 15th April\n1976. Then came the special leave petition preferred by\nKashmira Singh from jail and this petition was placed for\nhearing before another bench consisting of Fazal Ali, J. and\nmyself. We granted leave to Kashmira Singh limited to\nthe question of sentence and by an order dated 10th April\n1977 we allowed his appeal and commuted his sentence of\ndeath into one of imprisonment for life. The result was that\nwhile Kashmira Singh's death sentence was commuted to life\nimprisonment by one Bench, - the death sentence imposed on\nJeeta Singh was confirmed by another bench and he was\nexecuted on 6th October 1981, though both had played equal\npart in the murder of the family and there was nothing to\ndistinguish the case of one from that of the other. The\nspecial leave petition of Harbans Singh then came up for\nhearing and this time, it was still another bench which\nheard his special leave petition. The Bench consisted of\nSarkaria and Singhal, JJ. and they rejected the special\nleave petition of Harbans Singh on 1 6th October, 1978.\nHarbans Singh applied for review of this decision, but the\nreview petition was dismissed by Sarkaria, J. and A.P. Sen,\nJ. On 9th May 1980. It appears that though the registry of\nthis court had mentioned in its office report that Kashmira\nSingh's death sentence was already commuted, that fact was\nnot brought to the notice of the court specifically when the\nspecial leave petition of Harbans Singh and his review\npetition were dismissed. Now since his special leave\npetition as also his review petition were dismissed by this\nCourt, Harbans Singh would have been executed on 6th October\n1981 along with Jeeta Singh, but fortunately for him he\nfiled a writ petition in this Court and on that writ\npetition, the court passed an order staying the execution of\nhis death sentence. When this writ petition came up for\nhearing before a still another bench consisting of\nChandrachud, C.J., D.A. Desai and AN. Sen. JJ., it was\npointed out to the court that the death sentence imposed on\nKashmira Singh had been commuted by a bench consisting of\nFazal Ali, J. and myself and when this fact was pointed out,\nthe Bench directed that the case be sent back to the\nPresident for reconsideration of the clemency petition filed\nby Harbans Singh. This is a classic case which illustrates\nthe judicial vagaries in the imposition Of death penalty and\ndemonstrates vividly, in all its cruel and stark reality,\nhow the infliction of death penalty is influenced by the\ncomposition of the bench, even in cases governed by section\n354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n1973.\nThe question may well be asked by the accused: Am I to live\nor die depending upon the way in which the Benches are\nconstituted from time to time ? Is that not clearly\nviolative of the fundamental guarantees enshrined in\n\nArticles 14\nand\n21 ?\nIf we study the judicial decisions given by the courts\nover a number of years, we find Judges resorting to a wide\nvariety of factors in justification of confirmation or\ncommutation of death sentence and these factors when\nanalysed fail to reveal any coherent pattern. This is the\ninevitable consequence of the failure of the legislature to\nsupply broad standards or guidelines which would structure\nand channelise the discretion of the court in the matter of\nimposition of death penalty. Of course, I may make it clear\nthat when I say this I do not wish to suggest that if broad\nstandards or guidelines are supplied by the legislature,\nthey would necessarily cure death penalty of the vice of\narbitrariness or freakishness. Mr. Justice Harlan pointed\nout in Mc Gautha v. California(l) the difficulty of\nformulating standards or guidelines for channelising or\nregulating the discretion of the court in these words \":\n\n\"Those who have come to grips with the hard task\nof actually attempting to draft means of channeling\ncapital sentencing discretion have confirmed the lesson\ntaught by history...To identify before the fact those\ncharacteristics of criminal homicides and their\nperpetrators which call for the death penalty, and to\nexpress these characteristics in language which can be\nfairly understood and applied by the sentencing\nauthority, appear to be tasks which are beyond present\nhuman ability.\"\n\nBut whether adequate standards or guidelines can be\nformulated or not which would cure the aspects of\narbitrariness and capriciousness, the fact remains that no\nsuch standards or guidelines are provided by the legislature\nin the present case, with the result that the court has\nunguided and untrammelled discretion in choosing between\ndeath and life imprisonment as penalty for the crime of\nmurder and this has led to considerable arbitrariness and\nuncertainty. This is evident from a study of the decided\ncases which clearly shows that the reasons for confirmation\nor commutation of death sentence relied upon by the court in\ndifferent cases defy coherent analysis. Dr. Raizada has, in\nhis monumental doctoral study entitled \"Trends in\nsentencing; a study of the important penal statutes and\njudicial pronouncements of the High Courts and the Supreme\nCourt\" identified a large number of decisions of this Court\nwhere inconsis-\ntent awards of punishment have been made and the judges have\nfrequently articulated their inability to prescribe or\nfollow consistently any standards or guidelines. He has\nclassified cases upto 1976 in terms of the reasons given by\nthe court for awarding or refusing to award death sentence.\nThe analysis made by him is quite rewarding and\nilluminating.\n\n(i) one of the reasons given by the courts in a number\nof cases for imposing death penalty is that the\nmurder is \"brutal\", \"cold blooded\", \"deliberate\",\n\"unprovoked\", \"fatal\", \"gruesome\", \"wicked\",\n\"callous\", \"heinous\" or \"violent\". But the use of\nthese labels for describing the nature of the\nmurder is indicative only of the degree of the\ncourt's aversion for the nature or the manner of\ncommission of the crime and it is possible that\ndifferent judges may react differently to these\nsituations and moreover, some judges may not\nregard this factor as having any relevance to the\nimposition of death penalty and may therefore\ndecline to accord to it the status of \"special\nreasons\". In fact, there are numerous cases, where\ndespite the murder being one falling within these\ncategories, the court has refused to award death\nsentence. For example, Janardharan whose appeal\nwas decided along with the appeal of Rajendra\nPrasad had killed his innocent wife and children\nin the secrecy of night and the murder was\ndeliberate and cold blooded, attended as it was\nwith considerable brutality, and yet the majority\nconsisting of Krishna Iyer, J. and D.A. Desai, J.\ncommuted his death sentence to life imprisonment.\nSo also Dube had committed triple murder and still\nhis death sentence was commuted to life\nimprisonment by the same two learned Judges,\nnamely, Krishna Iyer, J. and D.A. Desai, J. It is\ntherefore clear that the epithets mentioned above\ndo not indicate any clearcut well defined\ncategories but are merely expressive of the\nintensity of judicial reaction to the murder,\nwhich may not be uniform in all Judges and even if\nthe murder falls within one of these categories,\nthat factor has been regarded by some judges as\nrelevant and by others, as irrelevant and it has\nnot been uniformly applied as a salient factor in\ndetermining whether or not death penalty should be\nimposed.\n(ii) There have been cases where death sentence has\nbeen A . . awarded on the basis of constructive or\njoint liability arising under sections 34 and 149.\nVide:\nBabu v. State of U.P.\n,(\n1) Mukhtiar Singh v.\nState of Punjab\n,(\n2) Masalt v. State of U.P.\n,(\n3)\nGurcharan Singh v. State - of Punjab\n.(4) But,\nthere are equally a large number of cases whether\ndeath sentence has not been awarded because the\ncriminal liability of the accused was only . under\nsection 34 or Section 149. There are no establi-\nshed criteria for awarding or refusing to award\ndeath sentence to an accused who himself did not\ngive the fatal blow but was involved in the\ncommission of - murder along with other assailants\nunder section 34 or section 149.\n\n(iii)The position as regards mitigating factors also\nshows the same incoherence. One mitigating factor\nwhich -, has often been relied upon for the\npurpose of com- muting the death sentence to life\nimprisonment is the youth of the offender. But\nthis too has been quite arbitrarily applied by the\nSupreme Court. There are . cases such as\nState of\nU.P. v. Suman Das\n,(\n5) Raghubir Singh v. Sate of\nHaryana\n(6) and Gurudas Singh v. State of\nRajasthan(7) where the Supreme Court took into\naccount the young age of the appellant and refused\nto award death sentence to him.\nEqually there are\n\n- cases such as\nBhagwan Swarup v. State of U.P.\n(')\nand Raghomani v. State of U.P.(9) where the\nSupreme Court took the view that youth is no\nground for extenuation of sentence. Moreover there\nis also divergence of opinion as to what should be\nthe age at which an offender may be regarded as a\nyoung man deserving i of commutation. The result\nis that as pointed out\nby Dr. Raizada, in some situations young offenders who\nhave committed multiple murders get reduction in life\nsentence whereas in others, \"where neither the loss of\nas many human lives nor of higher valued properly\" is\ninvolved, the accused are awarded death sentence.\n\n(iv) one other mitigating factor which is often taken into\naccount is delay in final sentencing. This factor of\ndelay after sentence received great emphasis in\nEdiga\nAnnamma v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n,(\n1) Chawla v. State\nof Haryana\n,(\n2) Raghubir Singh v. State of Haryana\n\n(supra) Bhur Singh v. State of Punjab,(\n3) State of\nPunjab v Hari Singh\n(4) and Gurudas Singh v. State of\nRajasthan(5) and in these cases delay was taken into\naccount for the purpose of awarding the lesser\npunishment of life imprisonment.\n\nIn fact, in\nRaghubir\nSingh v. State of Haryana\n(supra) the fact that for 20\nmonths the spectre of death penalty must have been\ntormenting his soul was held sufficient to entitle the\naccused to reduction in sentence.\nBut equally there are\na large number of cases where death sentences have been\nconfirmed, even when two or more years were taken in\nfinally disposing of the appeal; Vide: Rishdeo v. State\nof U.P.,(6) Bharmal Mapa v. State of Bombay(7) and\nother cases given by Dr. Raizada in foot-note 186 to\nchapter III. These decided cases show that there is no\nway of predicting. the exact period of prolonged\nproceeding which may favour an accused. Whether any im-\nportance should be given to the factor of delay and if\nso to what extent are matters entirely within the dis-\ncretion of the court and it is not possible to assert\nwith any definitiveness that a particular period of\ndelay after sentencing will earn for the accused\nimmunity\nfrom death penalty. It follows as a necessary\ncorrolary from these vagaries in sentencing\narising from the factor of delay, that the\nimposition of capital punishment becomes more or\nless a kind of cruel judicial lottery. If the case\nof the accused is handled expeditiously by the\nprosecution, defence lawyer, sessions court, High\nCourt and the Supreme Court, then this mitigating\nfactor of delay is not available to him for\nreduction to life sentence. If, on the other hand,\nthere has been lack of despatch, engineered or\nnatural, then the accused may escape the gallows,\nsubject of course to the judicial vagaries arising\nfrom other causes. In other words, the more\nefficient the proceeding, the more certain the\ndeath sentence and vice-versa.\n\n(v) The embroilment of the accused in an immoral\nrelationship has been condoned and in effect,\ntreated as an extenuating factor in\nRaghubir Singh\nv. State of Haryana\n(supra) and Basant Laxman More\nv. State of Maharashtra(l) while in\nLajar Masih v.\nState of U.P.\n,(2) it has been condemed and in\neffect treated as an aggravating factor. There is\nthus no uniformity l - of approach even so far as\nthis factor is concerned.\n\nAll these facors singly and cumulatively indicate not\nmerely that there is an enormous potential of arbitrary\naward of . death penalty by the High Courts and the Supreme\nCourt but that, .; in fact, death sentences have been\nawarded arbitrarily and freakishly. Vide: Dr. Upendra Baxi's\nnote on \"Arbitrariness of Judicial Imposition of Capital\nPunishment.\n\nProfessor Blackshield has also in his article on\n\"Capital Punishment in India\" commented on the arbitrary and\ncapricious nature of imposition of death penalty and\ndemonstrated forcibly and almost conclusively, that\narbitrariness and uneven incidence are inherent and\ninevitable in a system of capital punishment. He has taken\nthe decision of this Court in\nEdiga Anamma v. State of\nAndhra Pradesh\n(supra) as the dividing line and examined the\njudicial decisions given by this Court subsequent to the\ndecision in\nEdiga\nAnamma\n's case, where this Court had to choose between life\nand death under section 302 of the Indian Renal Code.\n\nThe\ncases sub sequent to the decision in\nEdiga Anamma\n's case\nhave been chosen for study and analysis presumbly because\nthat was the decision in which the court for the first time\nset down some working formula whereby a synthesis could be\nreached between death sentence and life imprisonment and\nKrishna Iyer, J. speaking on behalf of the court, formulated\nvarious grounds which in his opinion, might warrant death\nsentence as an exceptional measure.\n\nBut, despite this\nattempt made in\nEdiga Anamma\n's case to evolve some broad\nstandards or guidelines for imposition of death penalty, the\nsubsequent decisions, as pointed out by Professor\nBlackshield, display the same pattern of confusion,\ncontradictions and aberrations as the decisions before that\ncase.\n\nThe learned author has taken 45 reported decisions\ngiven after\nEdiga Anamma\n's case and shown that it is not\npossible to discern any coherent pattern in these decisions\nand they reveal con tradictions and inconsistencies in the\nmatter of imposition of death penalty. This is how the\nlearned author has summed up his conclusion after an\nexamination of these judicial decisions:\n\n\"But where life and death are at stake,\ninconsistencies which are understandable may not be\nacceptable. The hard evidence of the accompanying \"kit\nof cases\" compels the conclusion that, at least in\ncontemporary India, Mr. Justice Douglas' argument in\nFurman v. Georgia is correct: that arbitrariness and\nuneven incidence are inherent and inevitable in a\nsystem of capital punishment and that therefore-in\nIndian constitutional terms, and in spite of Jagmohan\nSingh- the retention of such a system necessarily\nviolates\nArticle 14\n's guarantee of \"equality before the\nlaw\".\n\nIt is clear from a study of the decisions of the higher\ncourts on the life-or-death choice that judicial adhocism or\njudicial impressionism dominates the sentencing exercise and\nthe infliction of death penalty suffers from the vice of\narbitrariness and caprice.\n\nI may point out that Krishna Iyer, J. has also come to\nthe the same conclusion on the basis of his long experience\nof the sentencing process. He has analysed the different\nfactors which have prevailed with the Judges from time to\ntime in awarding or refusing\nto award death penalty and shown how some factors have\nweighed A with one Judge, some with another, some with a\nthird and so on, resulting in chaotic arbitrariness in the\nimposition of death penalty. I can do no better than quote\nhis own words in\nRajendra Prasad\n's case (supra):\n\n\"Law must be honest to itself. Is it not true that\nsome judges count the number of fatal wounds, some the\nnature of the weapon used, others count the corpses or\nthe degree of horror and yet others look into the age\nor sex of the offendar and even the lapse of time\nbetween the trial Court's award of death sentence and\nthe final disposal. Of the appeal ? With some judges,\nmotives, provocations, primary or constructive guilt,\nmental disturbance and old feuds, the savagery of the\nmurderous moment or the plan which has preceded the\nkilling; the social milieu, the sublimated class\ncomplex and other odd factors enter the sentencing\ncalculas. Stranger still, a good sentence of death by\nthe trial Court is sometimes upset by the Supreme Court\n\n- I; because of law's delays. Courts have been directed\nexecution of murderers who are mental cases, who do not\nfall within the McNaghten rules, because of the insane\nfury - of the slaughter. A big margin of subjectivism,\na preference for old English precedents, theories of\nmodern penology, behavioral emphasis or social\nantecedents, judicial hubris or human rights\nperspectives, criminological literacy -. or fanatical\nreverence for outworn social philosophers burried in\nthe debris of time except as part of history-this h\nplurality of forces plays a part in swinging the\npendulum of sentencing justice erratically.\"\n\nThis passage from the judgment of the learned Judge exposes,\nin language remarkable for its succinctness as well as\neloquence, the vagarious nature of the imposition of death\npenalty and highlights a few of the causes responsible for\nits erratic operation. I find myself totally in agreement\nwith these observations of the learned - Judge.\n\nBut when it was contended that sentencing discretion is\ninherent in our legal system, and, in fact, it is desirable,\nbecause no two cases or criminals are identical and if no\ndiscretion is left to the\ncourt and sentencing is to be done according to a rigid\npredetermined formula leaving no room for judicial\ndiscretion, the sentencing process would cease to be\njudicial and would de-generate into a bed of procrustean\ncruelty. The argument was that having regard to the nature\nof the sentencing process, it is impossible to lay down any\nstandards or guidelines which will provide for the endless\nand often unforeseeable variations in fact situations and\nsentencing discretion his necessarily to be left to the\ncourt and the vesting of such discretion in the court, even\nif no standards or guidelines are provided by the\nlegislature for structuring or challenging such discretion,\ncannot be regarded as arbitrary or unreasonable. This\nargument, plausible though it may seem, is in my opinion not\nwell a founded and must be rejected. It is true that\ncriminal cases do not fall into set behaviouristic patterns\nand it is almost impossible to find two cases which are\nexactly identical. There are, as pointed out by Sarkaria, J.\nin the majority judgment, \"countless permutations and\ncombinations which are beyond the anticipatory capacity of\nthe human calculus\". Each case presents its own distinctive\nfeatures, its peculiar combinations of events and its unique\nconfiguration of facts. That is why, in the interest of\nindividualised justice, it is necessary to vest sentencing\ndiscretion in the court so that appropriate sentence may be\nimposed by the court in the exercise of its judicial\ndiscretion, having regard to the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of a given case, or else the. sentencing\nprocess would cease to be just and rational and justice\nwould be sacrificed at the altar of blind uniformity. But at\nthe same time, the sentencing discretion conferred upon the\ncourt cannot be altogether uncontrolled or unfettered. The\nstrategem which is therefore followed by the legislatures\nwhile creating and defining offences is to prescribe the\nmaximum punishment and in some cases, even the minimum and\nleave it to the discretion of the court to decide upon the\nactual term of imprisonment. This cannot be regarded as\narbitrary or unreasonable since the discretion that is left\nto the court is to choose an appropriate term of punishment\nbetween the limits\nlaid down by\nthe legislature, having\nregard to the distinctive features and the peculiar facts\nand circumstances of the case. The conferment of such\nsentencing discretion is plainly and indubitably essential\nfor rendering individualised justice. But where the\ndiscretion granted to the court is to choose between life\nand death without any standards or guidelines provided by\nthe legislature, the death penalty does become arbitrary and\nunreasonable. The death penalty is\nqualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment.\nWhether Ia sentence of imprisonment is for two years or five\nyears or for life, it is qualitatively the same, namely, a\nsentence of imprisonment, but the death penalty is totally\ndifferent. It is irreversible; it is beyond recall or\nreparation; it extinguishes life. It is the choice between -\nlife and death which the court is required to make and this\nis left to its sole discretion unaided and unguided by any\nlegislative yardstick to determine the choice. The only\nyardstick which may be said to have been provided by the\nlegislature is that life sentence shall be the rule and it\nis only in exceptional cases for special reasons that death\npenalty may be awarded. but it is nowhere indicated by\nlegislature as to what should be regarded as f 'special\nreasons' justifying imposition of death penalty. The awesome\nand fearful discretion whether to kill a man or to let him\nlive is vested in the court and the court is called upon to\nexercise . this discretion guided only by its own perception\nof what may be regarded as 'special reasons' without any\nlight shed by the legislature. It is difficult to appreciate\nhow a law which confers such unguided discretion on the\ncourt without any standards or guidelines on so vital an\nissue as the choice between life and death can be regarded\nas constitutionally valid. If I may quote the words of\nHarlan, J.:\n\n\"our scheme of ordered liberty is based, like the\ncommon law, on enlightened and uniformly applied legal\nprinciples, not on ad hoc notions of what is right or\nwrong in a particular case\"\n\nThere must be standards or principles to guide the court in\nmaking the choice between life and death and it cannot be\nleft to the court to decide upon the choice on an ad hoc\nnotion of what it conceives to be \"special reasons' in a\nparticular case. That is exactly what we mean when we say\nthat the government should be of laws and not y of men and\nit makes no difference in the application of this princi-\nple, whether 'men' belong to the administration or to the\njudiciary. It is a basic requirement of the equality clause\ncontained in\nArticle 14\nthat the exercise of discretion must\nalways be guided by standards or norms so that it does not\ndegenerate into arbitrariness and operate unequally on\npersons similarly situate. Where unguided and unfettered\ndiscretion is conferred on any authority, whether it be the\nexecutive or the judiciary, it can be exercised arbitrarily\nor\ncapriciously by such authority, because there would be no\nstandards k or principles provided by the legislature with\nreference to which the exercise of the discretion can be\ntested. Every form of arbitrariness, whether it be executive\nwaywardness or judicial adhocism is anathema in our\nconstitutional scheme. There can be no equal protection\nwithout equal principles in exercise of discretion.\nTherefore. the equality clause of the Constitution obligate\nthat whenever death sentence is imposed it must be a\nprincipled sentence, a sentence based on some standard or\nprinciple and not arbitrary or indignant capital punishment\nIt has been said that 'a Judge untethered by a text is a\ndangerous instrument, and I may well add that Judge power,\nuncanalised by clear principles, may be equally dangerous\nwhen the consequence of the exercise of discretion may\nresult in the hanging of a human being It is obvious that if\njudicial discretion is not guided by any standard or norms,\nit would degenerate into judicial caprice, which, as is\nevident from the foregoing discussion, has in fact happened\nand in such a situation, unregulated and un-principled\nsentencing discretion in a highly sensitive area involving a\nquestion of life and death would clearly be arbitrary and\nhence violative of the equal protection clause contained in\n\nArticle 14.\nIt would also militate against\nArticle 21\nas\ninterpreted in\nManeka Gandhi\n's case (supra) because no\nprocedure for depriving a person of his life can be regarded\nas reasonable, fair and just, if it vests uncontrolled and\nunregulated discretion in the court whether to award death\nsentence or to inflict only the punishment of life im-\nprisonment. The need for well recognised principles to\ngovern the 'deadly' discretion is so interlaced with fair\nprocedure that unregulated power not structured or guided by\nany standards or principles would fall foul of\nArticle 21.\n\nThe respondents however contendent that the absence of\nany standards or guidelines in the legislation did not\naffect the constitutional validity of the death penalty,\nsince the sentencing discretion being vested in the court,\nstandards or principles for regulating the exercise of such\ndiscretion could always be evolved by the court and the\ncourt could by a judicial fiat lay down standards or norms\nwhich would guide the Judge in exercising his discretion to\naward the death penalty. Now it is true that there are cases\nwhere the court lays down principles and standards for\nguidance in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it\nby a statute, but that is done by the court only in those\ncases where\nthe principles or standards are gatherable from the\nprovisions of the statute Where a statute confers discretion\nupon a court, the statute may lay down the broad standards\nor principles which should guide the court in the exercise\nof such discretion or such standards or principles may be\ndiscovered from the object and purpose of the statute, its\nunderlying policy and the scheme of its provisions and some\ntimes, even from the surrounding circumstances. When the\ncourt lays down standards or principles which should guide\nit in the exercise of its discretion, the court does not\nevolve any new standards or principles of its own but merely\ndiscovers them from the statute. The standards or principles\n\nlaid down by\nthe court in such a case are not standards or\nprinciples created or evolved by l' the court but they are\nstandards or principles enunciated by the Iegislature in the\nstatute and are merely discovered by the court as a matter\nof statutory interpretation. It is not legitimate for the\ncourt to create or evolve any standards or principles which\nare not found in the statute, because enunciation of such\nstandards or principles is a legislative function which\nbelongs to the legislative and not to the judicial\ndepartment. Moreover, it is difficult to see how any\nstandards or principles which would adequately guide the -\nexercise of discretion in the matter of imposition of death\npenalty can be evolved by the court. Sarkaria, J. himself\nhas lamented the impossibility of formulating standards or\nguidelines in this highly ' sensitive area and pointed out\nin the majority judgment:\n\n\".. there is little agreement among penologists\nand jurists as to what information about the crime and\ncriminal is relevant and what is not relevant for\nfixing the dose of punishment for a person convicted of\na particular offence. According to Cessare Beccaria,\nwho is supposed to be the intellectual progenitor of\ntoday's fixed sentencing movement, 'crime are only to\nbe measured by the injury done to society.' But the\n20th Century sociologists do not wholly agree with this\nview. In the opinion of Von Hirsch, the \"seriousness of\na crime depends both on the harm done (or risked) by\nthe act and degree of actor's culpability.\" But how is\nthe degree of that culpability to be measured. Can any\nthermometer be devised to measure its degree ?\nThis passage from the majority judgment provides a most\ncomplete and conclusive answer to the contention of the\nrespon-\ndents that the court may evolve its own standards or\nprinciples for guiding the exercise of its discretion. This\nis not a function which can be satisfactorily and adequately\nperformed by the court more particularly when the judicial\nperception of what may be regarded as proper and relevant\nstandards or guidelines is bound to vary from judge having\nregards to his attitude and approach, his predilections and\nprejudices and his scale of values and social philosophy.\n\nI am fortified in this view by the decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States in Furman v. Georgia\n(supra). The question which was brought before the court for\nconsideration in that Case was whether the imposition and\nexecution of death penalty constituted \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\" within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment as\napplied to the States by the Fourteenth. The court, by a\nmajority of five against four, held that the death penalty\nas then administered in the United States was\nunconstitutional, because it was being used in an arbitrary\nmanner and such arbitrariness in capital punishment was a\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against \"cruel\nand unusual punishment\" which was made applicable to the\nStates by the Fourteenth Amendment. Brennan J. and Marshall,\nJ. took the view that the death - penalty was per se\nunconstitutional as violative of the prohibition of the\nEighth Amendment. Brennan, J. held that the death penalty\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment as it did not\ncomport with human dignity and it was a denial of human\ndignity for a State arbitrarily to subject a person to an\nunusually severe punishment which society indicated that it\ndid not regard as acceptable and which could not be shown to\nserve any penal purpose more effectively than a\nsignificantly less drastic punishment. Marshall, J. stated\nthat the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment because\nit was an excessive and unnecessary punishment and also\nbecause it was morally unacceptable to the people of the\nUnited States. The other three learned Judges namely,\nDouglas, J. Stewart, J. and White, J. did not subscribe to\nthe view that the death penalty was per se unconstitutional\nin all circumstances but rested their judgment on the\nlimited ground that the death penalty as applied in the\nUnited States was unconstitutional. Douglas, J. argued that\n\"we deal with a system of law and of justice that leaves to\nthe uncontrolled discretion of judges or juries the\ndetermination whether defendants committing these crimes\nshould die or be imprisoned. Under these laws no standards\ngovern the selection of the penalty. People live or die\ndependent on the whim of one man or of twelve,\"\nStewart, J. also voiced his concern about the unguided and\nunregulated discretion in the sentencing process and\nobserved: \"...the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot\ntolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under legal\nsystems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly\nand so freakishly imposed.\" The remaining four Judges,\nnamely, Burger, C.J. Blackmun, J. Powell, J. and Rehnquist,\nJ. took the opposite view and upheld the constitutional\nvalidity of the death penalty in its entirety. It will thus\nbe seen that the view taken by the majority decision in this\ncase was that a law which gives uncontrolled and unguided\ndiscretion to the Judge (or the jury) to choose arbitrarily\nbetween death sentence and life imprisonment for a capital\noffence violates the Eighth Amendment which inhibits cruel\nand unusual punishment. Now Sarkaria, J. speaking on behalf\nof the majority, has brushed aside this decision as\ninapplicable in India on the ground that we \"do not have in\nour Constitution any provision like the Eighth Amendment nor\nare we at liberty to apply the test of reasonableness with\nthe freedom with which the Judges of the Supreme Court of\nAmerica are accustomed to apply the 'due process' clause.\" I\nam unable to agree with this reasoning put forward in the\nmajority judgment. I have already pointed out that though\nthere is no explicit provision in our Constitution\nprohibiting cruel and unusual punishment, this Court has in\n\nFrancis Mullin\n's case (supra) held that immunity against\ntorture or cruel and unusual punishment or treatment is\nimplicit in\nArticle 21\nand therefore, if any punishment is\ncruel and unusual, it would be violative of basic human\ndignity which is guaranteed under\nArticle 21.\nMoreover, in\nManeka Gandhi's case (supra) this court has by a process of\njudicial interpretation brought in the procedural due\nprocess clause of the American Constitution by reading in\n\nArticle 21\nthe requirement that the procedure by which a\nperson may be deprived of his life or personal liberty must\nbe reasonable, fair and just.\nDouglas, J. has also pointed\nout in Furman's case (supra) that \"there is increasing\nrecognition of the fact that the basic theme of equal\nprotection is implicit in 'cruel and unusual' punishment. A\npenalty ....should be considered 'unusually' imposed. if it\nis administered arbitrarily or discriminatorily\" and thus\nbrought in the equal protection clause for invalidating the\ndeath penalty.\nIt is also significant to note that despite\nthe absence of provisions like the American Due Process\nClause and the Eighth Amendment, this Court speaking through\nDesai, J. said in\nSunil Batra v. Delhi Administration\n.(1)\n\"Treatment of a human being which offends human\ndignity, imposes avoidable torture and reduces the man\nto the level of a beast would certainly be arbitrary\nand can be questioned under Article 14.. .\" Krishna\nIyer, J. was more emphatic and he observed in the same\ncase.\n\n\"True, our Constitution has no 'due process'\nclause or the VIII Amendment; but, in this branch of\nlaw, after Cooper.. and Maneka Gandhi........... the\nconsequence is the same. For what is punitively\noutrageous, scandalizing unusual or cruel or\nrehabilitatively counter productive is unarguably\nunreasonable and arbitrary and is shot down by\nArticle\nand\n19 \"\n\nIt should be clear from these observations in Sunil Batra's\ncase to which Cbandrachud, C.J. was also a party, that\nSarkaria, J. speaking on behalf of the majority Judges, was\nin error in relying on the absence of the American due\nprocess clause and the Eighth Amendment for distinguishing\nthe decision in Furman's case (supra) and upholding death\npenalty. The decision in Furman's case cannot, therefore, be\nrejected as inapplicable in India. This decision clearly\nsupports the view that where uncontrolled and unregulated\ndiscretion is conferred on the court without any standards\nor guidelines provided by the legislature, so as to permit\narbitrary and uneven imposition of death penalty, it would\nbe violative of both\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\n\nIt may be pointed out that subsequent to the decision\nin Furman's case (supra) and as a reaction to it the\nlegislatures of several States in the United States passed\nstatutes limiting or controlling the exercise of discretion\nby means of explicit standards to be followed in the\nsentencing process. These 'guided discretion' statutes\nprovided standards typically in the form of specific\naggravating and mitigating circumstances that must be taken\ninto account before death sentence can be handed down. They\nalso provided for separate phases of the trial to determine\nguilt and punishment (I) A.l.R. 1978 SC 1675.\nand for automatic appellate review of death sentences. The\nconstitutional validity of some of these 'guided discretion'\nstatutes was challenged in Gregg v. Georgia (supra) and\ncompanion cases and the Supreme Court of the United States\nupheld these statutes on the ground that providing specific\nsentencing guidelines to be followed in a separate post\nconviction phase of the trial would free the sentencing\ndecision of arbitrariness and discrimination. There is\nconsiderable doubt expressed by leading jurists in the\nUnited States in regard to correctness of this decision,\nbecause in their view the guide lines provided by these\nstatutes in the form of specific aggravating and/or\nmitigating circumstances are too broad and too vague to\nserve as an effective guide to discretion. In fact, while\ndealing with the challenge to the constitutional validity of\na 'guided discretion' statute enacted by the Legislature of\nMassachusettes, the Supreme Court of Massachusettes by a\nmajority held in District Attorney for the Suffolk District\nv. Watson (1) that the statute providing for imposition of\ndeath penalty was unconstitutional on the ground that it was\nviolative of\nArticle 26\nof the Declaration of Rights of the\nMassachusettes Constitution which prohibits infliction of\ncruel or unusual punishment. Henneseey, C.J. pointed out\nthat in enacting the impugned statute the Legislature of\nMassachusettes had clearly attempted to follow the mandate\nof the Furman opinion and its progeny by promulgating a law\nof guided and channelled jury discretion, but even so it\ntransgressed the prohibition of\nArticle 26\nof the\nDeclaration of Rights of the State Constitution. The learned\nChief Justice observed: \" .. it follows that we accept the\nwisdom of Furman that arbitrary and capricious infliction of\ndeath penalty is unconstitutional. However, we add that such\narbitrariness and discrimination, which inevitably persists\neven under a statute which meets the demands of Furman,\noffends\nArticle 26\nof the Massachusettes Declaration of\nRights.\" But we are not concerned here with the question as\nto whether the decision in Gregg's case represents the\ncorrect law or the decision of the Massachusettes Supreme\nCourt in Watson's case. That controversy does not arise here\nbecause admittedly neither the\nIndian Penal Code\nnor any\nother provision of law sets out any aggravating or\nmitigating circumstance or any other considerations which\nmust be taken into account in determining whether death\nsentence should be\nawarded or not. Here the sentencing discretion conferred\nupon the court is totally uncontrolled and unregulated or if\nI may borrow an expression from Furman's decision, it is\n'standardless' and unprincipled'.\n\nIt is true that there are certain safeguards provided\nin the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 which are designed\nto obviate errors in the exercise of judicial discretion in\nthe matter of imposition of death penalty. Section 235 sub\nsection (2) bifurcates the trial by providing two hearings\none at the pre-conviction stage and another at the pre-\nsentence stage so that at the second stage following upon\nconviction, the court can gather relevant information\nbearing on the question of punishment and decide, on the\nbasis of such information, what would be the appropriate\npunishment to be imposed on the offender. Section 366 sub-\nsection (1) requires the court passing a sentence of death\nto submit the proceedings to the High Court and when such\nreference is made to the High Court for confirmation of the\ndeath sentence, the High Court may under section 367 direct\nfurther inquiry to be made or additional evidence to be\ntaken and under section 368, confirm the sentence of death\nor pass any other sentence warranted by law or annual or\nalter the conviction or order a new trial or acquit the\naccused. Section 369 enjoins that in every reference so\nmade, the confirmation of the sentence or any new sentence\nor order passed by the High Court, shall, when such court\nconsists of two or more judges, be made, passed and signed\nby at least two of them. Then there is also a proviso in\nsection 379 which says that when the High Court on appeal\nreverses an order of acquittal and convicts the accused and\nsentences him to death, the accused shall have a right to\nappeal to the Supreme Court. Lastly there is an over-riding\npower conferred on the Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nto\ngrant, in its discretion, special leave to appeal to an\naccused who has been sentenced to death. These are\nundoubtedly some safeguards provided by the legislature, but\nin the absence of any standards or principles provided by\nthe legislature to guide the exercise of the sentencing\ndiscretion and in view of the fragmented bench structure of\nthe High Courts and the Supreme Court, these safeguards\ncannot be of any help in eliminating arbitrariness and\nfreakishness in imposition of death penalty. Judicial ad\nhocism or waywardliness would continue to characterise the\nexercise of sentencing discretion whether the Bench be of\ntwo judges of the High Court or of two or three judges of\nthe Supreme Court and arbitrary and uneven incidence of\ndeath\npenalty would continue to afflict the sentencing process\ndespite these procedural safeguards. The reason is that\nthese safeguards are merely peripheral and do not attack the\nmain problem which stems from lack of standards or\nprinciples to guide the exercise of the sentencing\ndiscretion. Stewart, J. pointed out in Gregg's case (supra),\n\"...the concerns expressed in Furman that the penalty of\ndeath not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner\ncan be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that\nthe sentencing authority is given adequate information and\nguidance. As a general proposition these concerns are best\nmet by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at\nwhich the sentencing authority is apprised of the\ninformation relevant to the imposition of sentence and\nprovided with standards to guide its use of the\ninformation.\" The first requirement that there should be a\nbifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is\napprised of the information relevant to the imposition of\nsentence is met by the enactment of section 235 sub-section\n(2), but the second requirement that the sentencing\nauthority should be provided with standards to guide its use\nof the information is not satisfied and the imposition of\ndeath penalty under section 302 of the Indian Penal \"ode\nread with section 354 sub-section (3) of the\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\n, 1973 must therefore be held to be\narbitrary and capricious and hence violative of\nArticles 14\n\nand\n21.\n\nThere is also one other characteristic of death\npenalty that is revealed by a study of the decided cases and\nit is that death sentence has a certain class complexion or\nclass bias in as much as it is largely the poor and the\ndown-trodden who are the victims of this extreme penalty. We\nwould hardly find a rich or affluent person going to the\ngallows. Capital punishment, as pointed out by Warden Duffy\nis \"a privilege of the poor.\" Justice Douglas also observed\nin a famous death penalty case \"Former Attorney Pamsey Clark\nhas said: 'it is the poor, the sick, the ignorant, the\npowerless and the hated who are executed'. \"So also Governor\nDisalle of Ohio State speaking from his personal experience\nwith the death penalty said:\n\n\"During my experience as Governor of Ohio, I found\nthe men in death row had one thing in common; they were\npenniless. There were other common denominators, low\nmental capacity, little or no education, few friends,\nbroken\nhomes-but the fact that they had no money was a\nprincipal factor in their being condemned to death...\"\n\nThe same point was stressed by Krishna Iyer, J. in\nRajendra\nPrasad\n's case (supra) with his usual punch and vigour and in\nhard hitting language distinctive of his inimitable style:\n\n\"Who, by and large, are the men whom the gallows\nswallow. The white-collar criminals and the corporate\ncriminals whose wilful economic and environmental\ncrimes inflict mass deaths or who hire assassins and\nmurder by remote control? Rarely. With a few\nexceptions, they hardly fear the halter. The feuding\nvillager, heady with country liquor, the striking\nworkers desperate with defeat, the political dissenter\nand sacrificing liberator intent on changing the social\norder from satanic misrule, the waifs and strays whom\nsociety has hardened by neglect into street toughs, or\nthe poor householder-husband or wife-driven by dire\nnecessity or burst of tantrums-it is this person who is\nthe morning meal of the macabre executioner.\"\n\n\"Historically speaking, capital sentence perhaps\nhas a class bias and colour bar, even as criminal law\nbarks at both but bites the proletariat to defend the\nproprietariat a reason which, incidentally, explains\nwhy corporate criminals including top executives whom\nby subtle processes, account for slow or sudden killing\nof large members by adulteration, smuggling, cornering,\npollution and other invisible operations, are not on\nthe wanted list and their offending operations which\ndirectly derive profit from mafia and white-collar\ncrimes are not visited with death penalty, while\nrelatively lesser delinquencies have, in statutory and\nforensic rhetoric, deserved the extreme penalty.\"\n\nThere can be no doubt that death penalty in its actual\noperation is discriminatory, for it strikes mostly against\nthe poor and deprived sections of the community and the rich\nand the affluent usually escape from its clutches. This\ncircumstance also adds to the arbitrary and capricious\nnature of the death penalty and renders it unconstitutional\nas being violative of\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\nBefore I part with this topic I may point out that only\nway in which the vice of arbitrariness in the imposition of\ndeath penalty can be removed is by the law providing that in\nevery case where the death sentence is confirmed by the High\nCourt there shall be an automatic review of the death\nsentence by the Supreme Court sitting as a whole and the\ndeath sentence shall not be affirmed or imposed by the\nSupreme Court unless it is approved unanimously by the\nentire court sitting enbanc and the only exceptional cases\nin which death sentence may be affirmed or imposed should be\nlegislatively limited to those where the offender is found\nto be so depraved that it is not possible to reform him by\nany curative or rehabilitative therapy and even after his\nrelease he would be a serious menace to the society and\ntherefore in the interest of the society he is required to\nbe eliminated. Of course, for reasons I have already\ndiscussed such exceptional cases would be practically nil\nbecause it is almost impossible to predicate of any person\nthat he is beyond reformation or redemption and therefore,\nfrom a practical point of view death penalty would be almost\nnor-existent But theoretically it may be possible to say\nthat if the State is in a position to establish positively\nthat the offender is such a social monster that even after\nsuffering life imprisonment and undergoing reformative and\nrehabilitative therapy, he can never be reclaimed for the\nsociety, then he may be awarded death penalty. If this test\nis legislatively adopted and applied by following the\nprocedure mentioned above, the imposition of death penalty\nmay be rescued from the vice of arbitrariness and caprice.\nBut that is not so under the law as it stands to-day.\n\nThis view taken by me in regard to the constitutional\nvalidity of the death penalty under\nArticles 14\nand\nrenders it unnecessary for me to consider the challenge\nunder\nArticle 19\nand I do not therefore propose to express\nany opinion on that question. But since certain observations\nhave been made in the majority judgment of Sarkaria, J.\nwhich seem to run counter to the decisions of this Court in\nR.C Cooper v. Union of India (\n1) and Maneka Gandhi\n's case\n(supra). I am constrained to add a few words voicing my\nrespectful dissent from those observations.\n\nSarkaria, J.\nspeaking on behalf of the majority judges has observed in\nthe present case that the 'form and object test or 'pith and\nsubstance rule' adopted by\nKania, C.J. and Fazal Ali, J. in\nA.K.. Gopalan v. State of\nMadras\n(supra) is the same as the 'test of direct and\ninevitable effect' enunciated in R.C. Cooper's case and\nManeka Gandhi's case and it has not been discarded or\njettisoned by these two decisions.\n\nI cannot look with\nequimanity on this attempt to resucitate the obsolute 'form\nand object test' or 'pith and substance rule' which was\nevolved in\nA.R. Gopalan\n's case and which for a considerable\nnumber of years dwarfed the growth and development of\nfundamental rights and cut down their operational amplitude.\nThis view proceeded on the assumption that certain articles\nin the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters\nand where the requirement of an Article dealing with a\nparticular matter in question is satisfied and there is no\ninfringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by that\nArticle, no recourse can be had to a fundamental right\nconferred by another Article and furthermore, in order to\ndetermine which is the fundamental right violated, the court\nmust consider the pith and substance of the legislation and\nask the question: what is the object of the legislature in\nenacting the legislation; what is the subject matter of the\nlegislation and to which fundamental right does it relate.\n\nBut this doctrine of exclusivity of fundamental rights was\nclearly and unequivocally over-ruled in R.C. Cooper's case\nby a majority of the Full Court, Ray, J. alone dissenting\nand so was the 'object and form test' or 'pith and substance\nrule' laid down in\nA.K. Gopalan\n's case.\nShah, J. speaking on\nbehalf of the majority Judges said in R.C. Copper's case\n(supra)\n\".. it is not the object of the authority making\nthe law impairing the right of a citizen, nor the form\nof action that determines the protection he can claim;\nit is the effect of the law and of the action upon the\nright which attract the jurisdiction of the Court to\ngrant relief. If this be the true view, and we think it\nis, in determining the impact of State action upon\nconstitutional guarantees which are fundamental, it\nfollows that the extent of protection against\nimpairment of a fundamental right is determined not by\nthe object of the Legislature nor by the form of the\naction, but by its direct operation upon the\nindividual's rights.\"\n\n\"We are of the view that the theory that the\nobject and form of the State action determine the\nextent of pro-\ntection which the aggrieved party may claim is not\nconsistent with the constitutional scheme....\"\n\n\"In our judgment, the assumption in A.K Gopalan's\ncase that certain articles in the Constitution\nexclusively deal with specific matters and in\ndetermining whether there is infringement of the\nindividual's guaranteed rights, the object and the form\nof the State action alone need be considered and effect\nof the laws on fundamental rights of the individuals in\ngeneral will be ignored cannot be accepted as correct.\"\n\nThis view taken in R.C. Cooper's case has since then been\nconsistently followed in several decisions of which I may\nmention only a few, namely,\nShambhu Nath Sarkar v. State of\nWest Bengal\n(1);\nHaradhan Saha v. State of West Bengal\n;(\n2)\nKhudiram Das v. State of West Bengal\n(3) and Maneka Gandhi's\ncase (supra).\n\nI cannot therefore assent to the proposition\nin the majority judgment that R.C. Cooper's case and\nManeka\nGandhi\n's case have not given a complete go by to the test of\ndirect and indirect effect, some times described as 'form\nand object test' or 'pith and substance rule' evolved by\nKania, C.J. and Fazal Ali, J. in\nA.K. Gopalan\n's case and\nthat the 'pith and substance rule' still remains a valid\nrule for resolving the question of the constitutionality of\na law assailed on the ground of its being violative of a\nfundamental right. Nor can I agree with the majority\njudgment when it says that it is\nArticle 21\nwhich deals with\nthe right to life and not\nArticle 19\nand\nsection 302\nof the\nIndian Penal Code is therefore not required to be tested on\nthe touchstone of any one or more of the clauses of Article\n\n19. This approach of the majority judgment not only runs\ncounter to the decision in R.C. Cooper's case and other\nsubsequent decisions of this Court including Maneka Gandhi's\ncase but is also fraught with grave danger inasmuch as it\nseeks to put the clock back and reverse the direction in\nwhich the law is moving towards realisation of the full\npotential of fundamental rights as laid down in R.C.\nCooper's ease and\nManeka Gandhi\n's case. It is significant to\nnote that the doctrine of exclusi-\nvity enunciated in\nA.K. Gopalan\n's case led to the property\nrights under\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nand\nbeing treated as\ndistinct and different rights traversing separate grounds,\nbut this view was over turned in Kochune's case (1) where\nthis Court by a majority held that a law seeking to deprive\na person of his property under\nArticle 31\nmust be a valid\nlaw and it must therefore meet the challenge of other\nfundamental rights including\nArticle 19(1)(f).\n\nThis Court\nover ruled the proposition laid down in\nState of Bombay v.\nBhanji Munji\n(2) that\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nread with clause (5)\npostulates the existence of property which can be enjoyed\nand therefore if the owner is deprived of his property by a\nvalid law under\nArticle 31\n, there can be no question of\nexercising any rights' under\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nin respect of\nsuch property. The court ruled that even io a law seeks to\ndeprive a person of his property under\nArticle 31\n, it must\nstill, in order to be valid, satisfy the requirement of\n\nArticle 19 (1)(f)\nread with clause (5). If this be the true\nposition in regard to the inter-relation between\nArticle 19\n(1) (f)\nand\nArticle 31\n, it is difficult to see why a law\nauthorising deprivation of the right to life under\nArticle\nshould not have to meet the test of other fundamental\nrights including those set out in the different clauses of\n\nArticle 19.\nBut even if section 302 in so far as it provides\nfor imposition of death penalty as alternative punishment\nhas to meet the challenge of Article 19. the question would\nstill remain whether the 'direct and inevitable consequence'\nof that provision is to affect any of the rights guaranteed\nunder the Article. That is a question on which I do not wish\nto express any definite opinion.\n\nIt is sufficient for me to\nstate that the 'object and form test' or the 'pith and\nsubstance rule' has been completely discarded by the\ndecision in R.C. Cooper's case and\nManeka Gandhi\n's case and\nit is now settled law that in order to locate the\nfundamental right violated by a statute, the court must\nconsider what is the direct and inevitable consequence of\nthe statute. The impugned statute may in its direct and\ninevitable effect invade more than one fundamental right and\nmerely because it satisfies the requirement of one\nfundamental right, it is not freed from the obligation to\nmeet the challenge of another applicable fundamental right.\n\nThese are the reasons for which I made my order dated\nMay 9, 1980 declaring the death penalty provided under\nsection 302 of the\nIndian Penal Code\nread with section 354 sub-section (3) of\nthe\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 is unconstitutional and\nvoid as being 5 violative of\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\nI must\nexpress my profound regret at the long delay in delivering\nthis judgment but. the reason is that there was a\nconsiderable mass of material which had to be collected from\nvarious sources and then examined and analysed and this took\na large amount of time.
