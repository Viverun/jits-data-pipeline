JUSTICE T NANDAKUMAR SINGH\n\n For the petitioner : Mr. K Paul, Adv\n\n For the respondents : Mr. SC Shyam, CGC for respdt.No.1 & 2\n Mr. S Sen, SC NEHU\n\n Date of hearing : 27.05.2014\n\n Date of Judgment : 04.06.2014\n\n JUDGEMENT AND ORDER\n\n By the impugned order of the North Eastern Hill University (for\n\nshort 'NEHU') Mawlai, Umshing fixed the revised pay of Professors of NEHU\n\nw.e.f. 01.01.2006 according to the fitments table for fixation of salary\n\nprescribed by the University Grants Commission (for short 'UGC') on the\n\nrecommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission; and none of the\n\nprofessors of NEHU, whose revised pay are also fixed similar with that of the\n\npresent petitioner made any whisper against the impugned revised pay i.e.\n\nagainst the impugned revision of pay scales and they are fully satisfied with\n\nthe revision of their pay scales by the NEHU according to the fitments table\n\nfor fixation of salary prescribed by the UGC.\n\n2. The Apex Court (Constitution Bench) coined the words \"litigious\n\nemployment\" in State of Karnataka vs. Umadevi (3): (2006) 4 SCC 1 and\n\nheld that the High Courts acting under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution should\n\nnot, therefore, ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularization or\n\npermanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made regularly and\n\nin terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely, because an employee had\n\ncontinued under cover of an order of the court, which the Apex Court has\n\ndescribed as \"litigious employment\", he would not be entitled to any right to\n\nbe absorbed or made permanent in the service. The courts must be careful in\n\nensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of\n\n Page 2 of 31\n its affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the\n\ninstruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory\n\nmandates. The Apex Court is not encouraging in granting the relief to the writ\n\npetitioner which would unduly interfere with the economic arrangement of its\n\naffairs by the State or its instrumentalities. The Apex Court further held that\n\nthe orders based on sentiments would result in perpetuating illegalities and in\n\nthe \"jettisoning\" of the scheme of the public employment and approving of the\n\norders passed by the authority in mistakes in favour of the employee would\n\nresult in perpetuating illegalities. The ratio laid down by the Apex Court\n\n(Constitution Bench) in Umadevi (3) case (Supra) was also followed by the\n\nApex Court in State of Karnataka & Ors v. G.V. Chandrashekar: (2009) 4\n\nSCC 342.\n\n3. It appears from the pleaded case of the petitioner in the writ\n\npetition that the writ petitioner had interpreted the scheme of revision of pay\n\nof teachers and equivalent cadres in the universities and colleges following\n\nthe revision of pay scales of Central Govt. employees on the\n\nrecommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission under the letter of\n\nthe Govt. of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of\n\nHigher Education, New Delhi dated 31.12.2008 to the Secretary, UGC and\n\nthe fitments table for fixation of salary prepared by the UGC in pursuance to\n\nthe scheme of revision of pay (a) teachers and equivalent cadres and (b)\n\nadministrative posts in the universities and colleges following the revision of\n\npay scales of the Central Govt. employees on the recommendations of the\n\nSixth Central Pay Commission in such a manner that the revision of pay\n\nscales of Professors of NEHU once made by the authority of NEHU, even if it\n\nis provisional, could not be altered to the disadvantage of the petitioner and\n\nalso the petitioner is trying to justify, without any rational reasons, the\n\nprovisional fixation of revised pay of Professors by the University-NEHU\n\n Page 3 of 31\n before receiving the fitments table for fixation of salary prepared by the UGC\n\nvide Resolution No.6 of the 23rd Emergent Meeting of the Executive Council\n\nof NEHU wherein, the Executive Council resolved to approve the\n\nrecommendation of the academic council to accept the revision of pay scales\n\netc. as per MHRD's letter dated 31.12.2008 and the payment of arrears up to\n\n40% of the total arrears be made latest by Wednesday 25th February, 2009\n\nand also the petitioner by relying on the Circular dated 28.07.2011 issued by\n\nthe NEHU claimed for three advance increments for holding Ph.D. degree as\n\ngrant for incentives.\n\n4.

It is the case of the respondents No.3-\n\n6 in their joint affidavit-in-opposition stated that as per the enabling provision\n\nof the MHRD Scheme contained in the letter dated 31st December 2008 and\n\ndirection of the UGC vide its letter dated 28th February 2009, pending receipt\n\nof Fitment Tables for final fixation of revised pay scale in the pay band and\n\nAcademic Grade Pay prepared by the UGC, the basic revised pay scale of\n\nthe writ petitioner had been provisionally fixed at Rs. 51,850/- for the purpose\n\nof facilitating the release of 40% of the arrear, however, on receipt of the\n\nFitment Table the Writ Petitioner had been placed in the appropriate pay\n\nfixation. The representation/appeal of the writ petitioner had been duly\n\nconsidered, however, the same could not be entertained as the writ petitioner\n\nhad been ultimately placed in the appropriate pay fixation to the\n\ncorresponding revised pay scale as per the Fitments Table. It is further\n\nstated that incentive like three advance increments is contemplated purely for\n\nadditional qualification of a teacher of the University, but Ph.D. is a minimum\n\nrequirement for the post of a professor which the Writ Petitioner is holding\n\nand the claim of the writ Petitioner for advance increments for his possessing\n\nPh.D. is totally misconceived. However, it is stated that \"the pay of a directly\n\nrecruited professor shall be fixed at a stage not below Rs. 43,000/- in the pay\n\nband IV of Rs. 37,400-67,000, with applicable AGP of Rs. 10,000/-\" in\n\n Page 12 of 31\n\n respect of Professor recruited on or after 01.01.2006, as would be evident\n\nfrom the gazette notifying the UGC Regulation 2010 where in the letter from\n\nDeputy Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource Development addressed to\n\nUGC printed along with Authenticated Fitment Tables. It is stated that the\n\nFitment Tables are for fixation of pay of existing incumbents who were in\n\nposition as on 01.01.2006.\n\n12. The NEHU in their joint affidavit-in-opposition further stated that\n\n\"the University may take action to adopt the above Government of India\n\nScheme for University and its colleges and payment of pay scales,\n\nenhancement of retirement age and release of 40% arrears during the\n\ncurrent financial year in accordance with these provisions. The commission\n\nwas in the process of finalizing Regulations in consultation with the\n\nstakeholders. The Fitment Tables for fixation of salary was likely to be\n\nreceived from the Central Government shortly which would be circulated to\n\nall Universities and would also be placed on UGC Website. The provisional\n\npayment may be made after taking an Undertaking from every beneficiary\n\nunder the scheme to the effect that any excess payment made on account of\n\nincorrect fixation of pay in the Pay Band or Academic Grade Pay shall be\n\nadjusted against the future payments due. Hence, it is amply clear from the\n\nspirit of the said provisional fixation of pay scale of the writ petitioner that\n\npending receipt of Fitment Tables for final fixation of Pay in the Pay Band or\n\nAcademic Grade Pay by the University, 40% of the arrears was released on\n\nprovisional fixation basis to the beneficiaries on obtaining an Undertaking\n\nfrom such beneficiaries to the effect that in case of incorrect fixation, the\n\nsame shall be adjusted against the future payments due\". The factual matrix\n\nof the subject matter being so, the allegation of \"downgrading\" as leveled by\n\nthe Petitioner holds no merit. The fixation of the Petitioner's Salary at Rs.\n\n51,850/- was a provisional one solely for the purposes of releasing 40% of\n\n Page 13 of 31\n\n the arrears to him pending receipt of Fitment Table from the UGC. The figure\n\nof Rs. 48,870/- was arrived at after final fixation of the Petitioner's pay in the\n\nlight of Fitment Tables received subsequently. Similar exercise was done in\n\ncase of others who were/are similarly placed with the Petitioner as per terms\n\nand conditions of said UGC and Govt. of India, MHRD letters. Hence, in the\n\nlight of the above, describing an appropriate fixation in a grade as\n\n\"downgrading\" by the Petitioner amounts to blatant misinterpretations and\n\ndistortion of facts. In fact, the Petitioner has misinterpreted and\n\nmisrepresented the spirit of the aforesaid letters of the UGC and Govt. of\n\nIndia, thereby misleading the Hon'ble Court. Further, suppression of vital fact\n\nas to the Petitioner himself executing the Undertaking dated 06.03.2009 in\n\norder to receive 40% of arrears based on provisional fixation as mentioned\n\nearlier, speaks volumes of the ulterior motive with which this Writ Petition has\n\nbeen filed. The question of giving Show cause notice for placing the Writ\n\nPetitioner in the appropriate revised pay scale as per the Fitment Table does\n\nnot arise as the same is not a penal action and the University has merely\n\nacted as per the directives of the UGC/MHRD in so far as the fixation of pay\n\nof teachers are concerned in accordance with the approved Fitment Table in\n\nthis regard and for which an Undertaking had been duly executed by the Writ\n\nPetitioner.\n\n13. It is the further case of the NEHU in their joint affidavit-in-\n\nopposition that as per the provision of Scheme of MHRD for pay revision of\n\nCentral University teacher contained in Letter dated 31.12.2008,\n\nrecommendation of UGC the revised pay scale of the Petitioner had been\n\nfixed provisionally for the purpose of releasing 40% of the arrear, however,\n\non receipt of Fitment Table from MHRD the Petitioner had been placed in\n\nappropriate pay fixation corresponding to the revised scale. The\n\nrepresentation/appeal filed by the Petitioner had been duly considered,\n\n Page 14 of 31\n\n however, for reasons as stated above the same could not be entertained.\n\nThe petitioner cannot claim for the advance increments inasmuch as, every\n\nPay Commission used to give incentives in the form of advance increments\n\nespecially to teachers/Assistant Professors for possessing M.Phil and Ph.D\n\nDegrees. However, the Vth Pay Commission did not provide for any advance\n\nincrement for movement into grade of Reader and above for possession of\n\nPh.D Degree because possession of Ph.D has been prescribed as the\n\nminimum requirement/qualification for the aforesaid posts. In the instant\n\ncase, the Petitioner was appointed as Reader in the University on\n\n08.12.1984. Further UGC Regulation 2010 also stipulates that the Ph.D shall\n\nbe mandatory qualification for the appointment of Professor and promotion\n\nas Professor. The Petitioner was appointed as Professor in the University on\n\n12.07.1991, thus on the date on which the writ petitioner was appointed as\n\nReader and Professor, the minimum qualification prescribed by UGC was\n\nPh.D. Therefore, he is not entitled to the incentives of advance increment.\n\n14. It is clear from the joint affidavit-in-opposition filed by the NEHU\n\nthat the UGC under the letter dated 28.02.2009 to the Vice Chancellor,\n\nNEHU, clearly stated that the University may take action to adopt the Govt. of\n\nIndia scheme for University and its colleges and its affiliated colleges and\n\npayment of pay scales, enhancement of retirement age and release of 40%\n\nof the arrears during the current financial year in accordance with these\n\nprovisions and the fitments table for fixation of salary was likely to be\n\nreceived from the Central Govt. very shortly. While awaiting the fitments table\n\nfor fixation of salary, the NEHU provisionally fixed the revised pay scale of\n\nthe petitioner as on 01.01.2006 at Rs.51,850/-+10,000/- and as per the\n\ndirections of the UGC under the said letter dated 28.02.2009, the NEHU had\n\nobtained the undertaking from the petitioner that any excess payment made\n\nto him as a result of incorrect fixation of pay in the revised scale of pay or on\n\n Page 15 of 31\n\n account of any other reason which is detected subsequently will be refunded\n\nby him to the University either by way of adjustment against future payment\n\ndue to him or otherwise as may be decided by the authority.

The UGC also filed affidavit-in-opposition in the present writ\n\npetition. The University Grants Commission (hereinafter to be referred as\n\n\"the Commission\") has been constituted under the provisions of the\n\nUniversity Grants Commission Act, 1956\n (Act No.3 of 1956) which came into\n\nforce w.e.f. 5.11.1956. The Act was enacted to make provisions for the co-\n\nordination and determination of standards in universities. The Commission\n\nunder the provisions of the Act has been entrusted with the duty to take such\n\nsteps as it may think fit for the promotion and co-ordination of university\n\neducation and for the determination and maintenance of standards of\n\nteaching, examination and research in universities. For the said purpose, the\n\n Page 17 of 31\n\n Commission has been vested with the power to recommend to any university\n\nthe measures necessary for the improvement of university education and\n\nadvised the universities upon the action to be taken for the purpose of\n\nimplementation of such recommendation. The Commission is also authorized\n\nto perform such other functions as may be prescribed or as may be deemed\n\nnecessary by the Commission for advancing the cause of higher education in\n\nIndia or as may be incidental or conducive to the discharge of its functions.\n\nSection 26\n of the Act which gives power to the Commission to make\n\nregulations consistent with the Act, permits the Commission to define the\n\nqualifications that should ordinarily be required of any person to be appointed\n\nto the teaching staff of the university, having regard to the branch of\n\neducation in which the applicant is expected to give instruction. The\n\nDepartment of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development,\n\nGovernment of India vide its letter dated 31.12.2008 addressed to the\n\nSecretary, UGC informed regarding the scheme of revision of pay of\n\nteachers and equivalent cadres in universities and colleges following the\n\nrevision of pay scales of Central Government employees on the\n\nrecommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission. In the said letter, it\n\nwas informed to the UGC that the Government of India has decided, after\n\ntaking into consideration the recommendations made by the UGC based on\n\nthe decisions taken at the meeting of the Commission held on 7-8 October,\n\n2008, to revise the pay scales of teachers in the central universities. The\n\nrevision of pay scales of teachers shall be subjected to various provisions of\n\nthe scheme of revision of pay scales as contained in the letter and\n\nregulations to be framed by the UGC in this behalf in accordance with the\n\nscheme given in the letter. The revised pay scales and other provisions of\n\nthe scheme was stipulated in para 1 to 12 of the said letter.\n\n Page 18 of 31\n\n 16. It is further stated that so far as the applicability of the scheme\n\nis concerned, it has been stipulated in para 8 (p) of the letter to the following\n\neffect:-\n\n 8(p)(i) This scheme shall be applicable to teachers and other\n equivalent cadres of Library and Physical Education in all the Central\n Universities and colleges there-under and the institutions deemed to\n be Universities whose maintenance expenditure is met by the UGC.\n The implementation of the revised scales shall be subject to the\n acceptance of all the condition mentioned in this letter as well as\n Regulations to be framed by the UGC in this behalf. Universities\n implementing this scheme shall be advised by the UGC to amend their\n relevant statutes and Ordinances in line with the UGC Regulations\n within three month from the date of issue of this letter.\"\n\n Further, clause 8(P)(v) deals with the applicability of the\n\nscheme to Universities, colleges and other higher educational institutions\n\nwhich comes under the purview of the state legislature and the following has\n\nbeen stipulated:-\n\n 8(P)(V): \"this scheme may be extended to Universities, colleges and\n other higher educational institutions coming under the purview of the\n state legislatures, provided State Governments wish to adopt and\n implement the scheme subject to the following terms and conditions:-\n\n (a) Financial assistance from the Central Government to State\n Governments opting to revise pay scales of teachers and other\n equivalent cadre covered under the Scheme shall be limited to the\n extent of 80% (eighty percent) of the additional expenditure\n involved in the implementation of the revision.\n\n (b) The state government opting for revision of pay shall meet the\n remaining 20% (twenty percent) of the additional expenditure from\n its own sources.\n\n (c) Financial assistance referred to in sub-clause (a) above shall be\n provided for the period from 1.01.2006 to 31.03.2010.\n\n Page 19 of 31\n\n (d) The entire liability on account of revision of pay scales etc. of\n university and college teachers shall be taken over by the State\n Government opting for revision of pay scales with effect from\n 1.4.2010.\n\n (e) Financial assistance from the Central Government shall be\n restricted to revision of pay scales in respect of only those posts\n which were in existence and had been filled up as on 1.01.2006.\n\n (f) State Government taking into consideration other local conditions,\n may also decide in their discretion, to introduce scales of pay\n higher than those mentioned in this Scheme, and may give effect\n to the revised bands/scales of pay from a date on or after\n 1.01.2006; however, in such cases the details of modifications\n proposed shall be furnished to the Central Government and\n Central assistance shall be restricted to the Pay Bands as\n approved by the Central Government and not to any higher scale\n of pay fixed by the State Government (s).\n\n (g) Payment of Central assistance for implementing this scheme is\n also subject to the condition that the entire scheme of revision of\n pay scales, together with all the conditions to be laid down by the\n UGC by way of Regulations and other guidelines shall be\n implemented by State Governments and Universities and Colleges\n coming under their jurisdiction as a composite scheme without any\n modification except in regard to the date of implementation and\n scales of pay mentioned herein above.\n\n17. It is also stated that after receiving the aforesaid letter dated\n\n31.12.2008, the UGC constituted an expert committee to consider the issues\n\nand suggest follow up action as also to frame the regulation as contemplated\n\nin the said letter dated 31.12.2008. Subsequently, in exercise of the powers\n\nconferred under clause (e) and (g) of sub-section (1) of \nSection 26\n of\n\nUniversity Grants Commission Act, 1956 (3 of 1956), and in pursuance of the\n\nMHRD O.M.No. F.23-7/2008-IFD dated 23rd October, 2008, read with\n\n Page 20 of 31\n\n Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure) O.M.No.F.1-1/2008-IC\n\ndated 30th August, 2008, and in terms of the MHRD Notification No.1-\n\n32/2006-U.II/U.I(1) issued on 31st December, 2008 and in supersession of\n\nthe University Grants Commission (Minimum Qualifications Required for the\n\nAppointment and Career Advancement of Teachers in Universities and\n\nInstitutions affiliated to it) Regulations, 2000, issued by University Grants\n\nCommission vide Regulation No. F.3-1/2000 (PS) dated 4th April, 2000,\n\ntogether with all amendments made therein from time to time, the University\n\nGrants Commission framed the University Grants Commission (Minimum\n\nQualifications for Appointment of Teachers and other Academic Staff in\n\nUniversities and Colleges and other Measures for the Maintenance of\n\nStandards in Higher Education) Regulations, 2010.\n\n18. The NEHU and UGC clearly stated in their respective affidavits-\n\nin-opposition that incentives like three increments are contemplated purely\n\nfor additional qualification of a teacher of the University but Ph.D. degree is a\n\nminimum qualification for the post of Professor, which the petitioner is\n\nholding and the claim of the petitioner for advance increments of his\n\npossessing Ph.D. is totally misconceived. There cannot be incentives in the\n\nform of advance increments for possessing minimum qualification of Ph.D.\n\ndegree for the post of Professor. The incentives according to the normal\n\nservice parlance which the ordinary employee or layman understood is that\n\nthe incentives are given to the employee for acquiring additional qualification.\n\nHolding of Ph.D. degree is an additional qualification of a teacher holding the\n\npost of teacher for which Ph.D. degree is not an essential qualification and\n\nthere cannot be incentives in the form of advance increments for holding\n\nminimum essential/basic qualification i.e. Ph.D. degree for the post of\n\nProfessor. The UGC under the letter dated 24.07.2002 to all the Registrars of\n\nthe Universities clarified that these two increments shall not be admissible to\n\n Page 21 of 31\n\n teachers, who were recruited/promoted to a post for which Ph.D. was an\n\nessential qualification. The said letter dated 24.07.2002 of the UGC reads as\n\nfollows:-\n\n \"University Grants Commission\n Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg\n New Delhi-110 002.\n\n F.5-3/2001(PS) 24 July, 2002\n\n The Registrar\n (All Universities & State Governments)\n (As per list attached)\n\n Sir, Madam,\n\n The UGC vide its letter of even number dated 31.8.2001,\n had extended the benefit of two advance increments to\n teachers who acquired Ph.D. during service prior to 1.1.96 and\n who did not get the benefit of any advance increments as per\n earlier Career Advancement Scheme. These advance\n increments were payable with effect from 27.7.98.\n\n It is clarified that these two advance increments shall not\n be admissible to teachers, who were recruited/promoted to a\n post for which Ph.D. was an essential qualification.\n\n Yours faithfully,\n Sd/-\n\n (K.P.

There is no room for interpretation of the incentives in the\n\nmanner the petitioner pleaded in the present writ petition that he would be\n\nentitled to receive the advance increments in the form of incentives for\n\nhaving Ph.D. degree. The said letter dated 24.07.2002 clearly speaks that\n\nthe advance increments shall not be admissible to teachers, who were\n\nrecruited/promoted to a post for which Ph.D. degree was an essential\n\nqualification. It is fairly well settled law that when the legislature has spoken,\n\nthe judges cannot afford to be wiser. (Reference may be made to the\n\ndecision of the Apex Court in \nShri. Mandir Sita Ramji v. Governor of Delhi\n\n Page 22 of 31\n\n & Ors\n reported inAIR 1974 SC 1868). The petitioner, it appears, had\n\nmisunderstood the basic principle of construction of statue while interpreting\n\nthe scheme of revision of pay of teachers and equivalent cadres in the\n\nuniversities following the revision of pay scales of Central Govt. employees\n\non the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission i.e. the said\n\nscheme dated 31.12.2008 and the said Regulations on minimum\n\nqualifications for appointment of teachers and other academic staff in the\n\nuniversities and colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards in\n\nhigher education 2010 and the said fitments table for fixation of salary i.e.\n\nTable 5 to the said UGC Regulations 2010.\n\n20. It is, no doubt, well settled that it is the basic principle of\n\nconstruction of statute that the same should be read as a whole, then chapter\n\nby chapter, section by section and word by word. Recourse to construction or\n\ninterpretation of statute is necessary when there is ambiguity, obscurity, or\n\nin-consistency therein and not otherwise. An effort should be made to give\n\neffect to all parts of the statute and unless absolutely necessary, no part\n\nthereof shall be rendered superfluous or redundant. True meaning of a\n\nprovision of law is to be determined on the basis of what it provides by its\n\nclear language, with due regard to the scheme of law (Reference may be\n\nmade to \nBhavnagar University Vs. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. & Ors\n,\n\nreported in (2003) 2 SCC 111.\n \nIt is cardinal rule of construction that no word\n\nshould be construed redundant or surplus in interpreting the provision of a\n\nstatute or rule (Ref: \nDinesh Chandra Sangma Vs. State of Assam & Ors\n:\n\nAIR 1978 SC 17). The Apex Court in \nState of Maharashtra & Ors. Vs.\n\nSantosh Shanker Acharya\n: (2000) 7 SCC 463 held that it is too well known\n\nprinciple of construction of statute that the legislature engrafted every part of\n\nthe statue for a purpose. The legislative intention is that every part of the\n\nstatute should be given effect. Legislature is deemed not to waste its words\n\n Page 23 of 31\n\n or to say anything in vain and a construction which attributes redundancy to\n\nthe legislature will not be accepted except for compelling reasons.\n \nThe Apex\n\nCourt in \nBhavnagar University Vs. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. & Ors.\n:\n\n(2003) 2 SCC 111 held that it is the basic principle of construction of statute\n\nthat statutory enactment must ordinarily be construed according to their plain\n\nmeaning and no words should be added, altered or modified unless it is\n\nplainly necessary to do so to prevent a provision from being unintelligible,\n\nabsurd, unreasonable, unworkable or totally irreconcilable with the rest of the\n\nstatute.\n\n21. The Apex Court in State of Gujrat & Anr v. Justice R.A.\n\nMehta (Retired) & Ors: (2013) 3 SCC 1 held that:\n\n \"96. In the process of statutory construction, the court must\n construe the Act before it, bearing in mind the legal maxim ut\n res magis valeat quam pereat which means it is better for a\n thing to have effect than for it to be made void, i.e., a statute\n must be construed in such a manner, so as to make it\n workable. Viscount Simon, L.C. in Nokes v. Doncaster\n Amalgamated Collieries Ltd.: 1940 AC 1014: (1940) 3 All ER\n 549 (HL) stated as follows: (AC p.1022)\n\n \"......if the choice is between two interpretations, the\n narrower of which would fail to achieve the manifest\n purpose of the legislation, we should avoid a\n construction which would reduce the legislation to futility\n and should rather accept the bolder construction based\n on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the\n purpose of bringing about an effective result.\"\n\n 97. Similarly in Whitney v. IRC: 1926 AC 37 (HL), it was\n observed as under: (AC p.52)\n\n \"...... A statute is designed to be workable, and the\n interpretation thereof by a court should be to secure that\n object, unless crucial omission or clear direction makes\n that end unattainable.\"\n\n 98. The doctrine of purposive construction may be taken\n recourse to for the purpose of giving full effect to statutory\n provisions, and the courts must state what meaning the statute\n should bear, rather than rendering the statute a nullity, as\n\n Page 24 of 31\n\n statutes are meant to be operative and not inept. The courts\n must refrain from declaring a statute to be unworkable. The\n rules of interpretation require that construction, which carries\n forward the objectives of the statute, protects interest of the\n parties and keeps the remedy alive, should be preferred,\n looking into the text and context of the statute. Construction\n given by the court must promote the object of the statute and\n serve the purpose for which it has been enacted and not efface\n its very purpose. \"The courts strongly lean against any\n construction which tends to reduce a statute to futility. The\n provision of the statute must be so construed so as to make it\n effective and operative.\" The court must take a pragmatic view\n and must keep in mind the purpose for which the statute was\n enacted, as the purpose of law itself provides good guidance to\n courts as they interpret the true meaning of the Act and thus,\n legislative futility must be ruled out. A statute must be\n construed in such a manner so as to ensure that the Act itself\n does not become a dead letter, and the obvious intention of the\n legislature does not stand defeated, unless it leads to a case of\n absolute intractability in use. The court must adopt a\n construction which suppresses the mischief and advances the\n remedy and \"to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for\n continuance of the mischief, and pro privato commodo, and to\n add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true\n intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico\". The court\n must give effect to the purpose and object of the Act for the\n reason that legislature is presumed to have enacted a\n reasonable statute. (Vide: M. Pentiah v.

It may be mentioned in this connection that the first and\n foremost principle of interpretation of a statute in every system\n of interpretation is the literal rule of interpretation. The other\n rules of interpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposive\n interpretation, etc. can only be resorted to when the plain words\n of a statute are ambiguous or lead to no intelligible results or if\n read literally would nullify the very object of the statute. Where\n the words of a statute are absolutely clear and unambiguous,\n recourse cannot be had to the principles of interpretation other\n than the literal rule, vide \nSwedish Match AB vs. Securities\n and Exchange Board of India\n: (2004) 11 SCC 641: AIR 2004\n\n Page 25 of 31\n\n SC 4219.\n \nAs held in \nPrakash Nath Khanna v. C.I.T.\n: (2004) 9\n SCC 686, the language employed in a statute is the\n determinative factor of the legislative intent. The legislature is\n presumed to have made no mistake. The presumption is that it\n intended to say what it has said.\n \nAssuming there is a defect or\n an omission in the words used by the legislature, the Court\n cannot correct or make up the deficiency, especially when a\n literal reading thereof produces an intelligible result, vide \nDelhi\n Financial Corpn. v. Rajiv Anand\n: (2004) 11 SCC 625.\n \nWhere\n the legislative intent is clear from the language, the Court\n should give effect to it, vide \nGovernment of A.P. v. Road\n Rollers Owners Welfare Assn.\n: (2004) 6 SCC 210 and the\n Court should not seek to amend the law in the garb of\n interpretation.\n\n \n46. The rules of interpretation other than the literal rule would\n come into play it there is any doubt with regard to the express\n language used or if the plain meaning would lead to an\n absurdity. Where the words are unequivocal, there is no scope\n for importing any rule of interpretation vide \nPandian Chemicals\n Ltd. v. CIT\n: (2003) 5 SCC 590.\n\n \n47. It is only where the provisions of a statue are ambiguous\n that the court can depart from a literal or strict construction vide\n \nNasiruddin v. Sita Ram Agarwal\n: (2003) 2 SCC 577: AIR\n 2003 SC 1543.\n \nWhere the words of a statue are plain and\n unambiguous effect must be given to them vide \nBhaiji v. Sub-\n Divisional Officer\n: (2003) 1 SCC 692.\"\n\n23. Wisdom and advisability of economic policies are ordinarily not\n\namendable to judicial review unless it can be demonstrated that the policy is\n\ncontrary to any statutory provision or the Constitution. In other words, it is not\n\nfor the courts to consider relative merits of different economic policies and\n\nconsider whether a wiser or better one can be evolved. In matters relating to\n\neconomic issues, the Government has, while taking a decision, right to \"trial\n\nand error\" as long as both trial and error are bona fide and within limits of\n\nauthority. For testing the correctness of a policy, the appropriate forum is\n\nParliament and not the courts. Here the policy was tested and the motion\n\ndefeated in the Lok Sabha on 1-3-2001. (Ref: \nBalco Employees' Union\n\n(Regd) v. Union of India & Ors\n: (2002) 2 SCC 333).\n\n Page 26 of 31\n\n \n24. The policy decision/ or decision of the UGC for revision of pay\n\nscales of teachers on the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay\n\nCommission is not amendable to judicial review unless it can be\n\ndemonstrated that the policy is contrary to any statutory provision or the\n\nconstitution. The Apex Court in \nState of U.P. & Ors v. U.P. State Tax\n\nOfficers Grade II Assn.\n reported in (2003) 6 SCC 250 held that the\n\ndecision of expert body like the pay commission is not ordinarily subject to\n\njudicial review obviously because pay fixation is an exercise requiring to go\n\ninto various aspects of the posts held in various services and nature of duties\n\nof the employees.\n \nThe Apex Court in \nK.T. Veerappa & Ors v. State of\n\nKarnataka\n: (2006) 9 SCC 406 held that Court should interfere with\n\nadministrative decision pertaining to pay fixation and pay parity when they\n\nfind such a decision to be unreasonable, unjust and prejudicial to a section of\n\nemployees and taken in ignorance of material and relevant factors.\n \nPara 13\n\nof the SCC in \nK.T. Verrappa\n's case (Supra) reads as follows:-\n\n \"13. He next contended that fixation of pay and parity in duties\n is the function of the executive and financial capacity of the\n Govt. and the priority given to different types of posts under the\n prevailing policies of the Government are also relevant factors.\n \nIn support of this contention, he has placed reliance on State of\n Haryana v. Haryana Civil Secretariat Personal Staff Assn. and\n \nUnion of India v. S.B. Vohra\n.\n There is no dispute nor can there\n be any to the principles as settled in State of Haryana v.\n Haryana Civil Secretariat Personal Staff Assn. that fixation of\n pay and determination of parity in duties is the function of the\n executive and the scope of judicial review of administrative\n decision in this regard is very limited. However, it is also equally\n well settled that the courts should interfere with administrative\n decisions pertaining to pay fixation and pay parity when they\n find such a decision to be unreasonable, unjust and prejudicial\n to a section of employees and taken in ignorance of material\n and relevant factors.\"\n\n25. It is the further case of the petitioner that the petitioner was not\n\ngiven an opportunity of being heard before taking decision of the NEHU for\n\nrevision of pay scale of the petitioner by the impugned order dated\n\n Page 27 of 31\n\n 04.12.2009. The petitioner clearly misunderstood that in the present case,\n\nthere is no question of reducing pay scale of the petitioner vide impugned\n\norder dated 04.12.2009 as a punishment and in such case, there is no\n\nquestion of giving show cause notice to the petitioner before passing the\n\nimpugned order dated 04.12.2009. Over and above, there is no requirement\n\nof giving prior notice to the employees in the case of taking policy decision or\n\nthe decision in general for the employees by the State Govt. or its\n\ninstrumentalities. The Apex Court in \nBalco Employees' Union\n case (Supra)\n\nheld that employees of such PSUs have no right of pre-decisional notice in\n\ntaking the policy decision involving the pay scales of the employees. Any\n\nconsequential effect of the policy decision the general decision of the\n\nauthority to the conditions of service shall be taken as an incidence of\n\nservice.\n \nParas 48 & 49 of the SCC in \nBalco Employees' Union\n case (Supra)\n\nread as follows:-\n\n \n\"48. Merely because the workmen may have protection of\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution, by regarding BALCO as\n a State, it does not mean that the erstwhile sole shareholder\n viz. Government had to give the workers prior notice of hearing\n before deciding to disinvest. There is no principle of natural\n justice which requires prior notice and hearing to persons who\n are generally affected as a class by an economic policy\n decision of the Government. If the abolition of a post pursuant\n to a policy decision does not attract the provisions of \nArticle 311\n\n of the Constitution as held in \nState of Haryana vs. Des Raj\n Sangar\n: (1976) 2 SSC 844: 1976 SCC (L&S) 336 on the same\n parity of reasoning, the policy of disinvestment cannot be\n faulted if as a result thereof the employees lose their rights or\n protection under \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. In other\n words, the existence of rights of protection under \nArticles 14\n\n and \n16\n of the Constitution cannot possibly have the effect of\n vetoing the Government's right to disinvest. Nor can the\n employees claim a right of continuous consultation at different\n stages of the disinvestment process. If the disinvestment\n process is gone through without contravening any law, then the\n normal consequences as a result of disinvestment must follow.\n\n 49. The Government could have run the industry\n departmentally or in any other form. When it chooses to run an\n industry by forming a company and it becomes its shareholder\n then under the provisions of the \nCompanies Act\n as a\n shareholder, it would have a right to transfer its shares. When\n\n Page 28 of 31\n\n persons seek and get employment with such a company\n registered under the \nCompanies Act\n, it must be presumed that\n they accept the right of the Directors and the shareholders to\n conduct the affairs of the company in accordance with law and\n at the same time they can exercise the right to sell their\n shares.\"\n\n26. It is well settled that when there is a conflict between law and\n\nequity, it is the law which has to prevail. The Apex Court in \nRaghunath Rai\n\nBareja\n's case (Supra) held that:\n\n \"29. ................... that it is well settled that when there is a\n conflict between law and equity, it is the law which has to\n prevail, in accordance with the Latin maxim \"dura lex sed lex\"\n\n which means \"the law is hard, but it is the law\". Equity can only\n supplement the law, but it cannot supplant or override it.\"\n\n27. The Apex Court in \nVidesh Sanchar Nigam Ltd., & Anr v. Ajit\n\nKumar & Ors\n: (2008) 11 SCC 591 held that a bona fide mistake does not\n\nconfer any right on any party and bona fide mistake can be corrected. In that\n\ncase, the respondents are allowed to enjoy wrong payment of D.A. on\n\naccount of some errors or bona fide mistakes; and the said bona fide\n\nmistakes had been corrected.\n \nParas 46 & 47 of the SCC in \nVidesh Sanchar\n\nNigam Ltd.\n case (Supra) read as follows:-\n\n \"46. It is well settled that a bona fide mistake does not confer\n any right on any party and it can be corrected. VSNL vide\n subsequent Office Order bearing Ref. No. HQ-A/01-04/91-PE1\n dated 18-10-1995 had rectified its mistake appearing in earlier\n order dated 3-9-1993 and the said office order was again\n modified by another Office Order bearing No. HQ-8A/01-04/91-\n PE1 dated 19-12-1995 by which Para 2(A) of the Office Order\n dated 18-10-1995 was modified to the extent as stated in the\n earlier part of this judgment. The modified order was a one-time\n exercise for choosing the alternatives of settlement of pension\n and the pensioners were required to submit their consent to the\n\n Page 29 of 31\n\n regional heads in a prescribed format by 15-1-1996. The\n Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances\n and Pension (DP & PW), New Delhi, issued OM dated 22-11-\n 1996 (Annexure P-14) which is the nodal department of the\n Government of India for taking policy decisions on pensionary\n matters sent clarificatory order, a copy thereof was sent to the\n Ministry of Telecommunications, Department of\n Communications, dealing with the subject of payment of\n pension to the employees of erstwhile OCS who were absorbed\n in VSNL.\n\n 47. \nIn view of the above, we are of the opinion that the\n benefit of DR of the CDA scales, which had been given to the\n respondent retirees by mistake at the time of their retirement, is\n not to be given again as clarified by the Government of India\n from time to time in their various office memoranda \nreferred to\n above\n and the respondent retirees are entitled to pension to be\n calculated on emoluments in the IDA pay scales.\"\n\n28. The Apex Court in \nUnion of India & Anr v. Narendra Singh\n:\n\n(2008) 2 SCC 750 held that mistakes are mistakes and they can always be\n\ncorrected by following due process of law. Para 32 of the SCC in \nNarendra\n\nSingh\n's case (Supra) reads as follows:-\n\n \"32. It is true that the mistake was of the Department and the\n respondent was promoted though he was not eligible and\n qualified. But, we cannot countenance the submission of the\n respondent that the mistake cannot be corrected. Mistakes are\n mistakes and they can always be corrected by following due\n process of law. In ICAR v. T.K. Suryanarayan: (1997) 6 SCC\n 766 it was held that if erroneous promotion is given by wrongly\n interpreting the rules, the employer cannot be prevented from\n applying the rules rightly and in correcting the mistake. It may\n cause hardship to the employees but a court of law cannot\n ignore statutory rules.\"\n\n29. For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the considered view\n\nthat the petitioner had utterly failed to make out a case that the revision of\n\npay scale of the petitioner under the decision of NEHU in compliance with the\n\nUGC Regulations, 2010 was in ignorance of material and relevant factors\n\nand also that the NEHU cannot be prevented from correcting the mistake in\n\nthe provisional fixation of the revised pay scale of the writ petitioner.\n\n Page 30 of 31\n\n 30. The writ petition is devoid of merit; and accordingly dismissed.\n\n JUDGE\nLam\n\n Page 31 of 31",
