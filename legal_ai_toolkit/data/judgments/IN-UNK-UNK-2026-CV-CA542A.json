It would be noticed that as per the compromise deed, the\n\n matter with regard to criminal cases as mentioned in paras 2 and 3 (supra)\n\n are also required to be compromised. However, the moot question is\n\n whether this is permissible in law.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n\n 4\n\n 4. This question is no longer res integra in view of the judgment\n\n laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Narinder Singh & Ors. V.\n\n .\n\n State of Punjab & Anr. JT 2014 (4) SC 573, wherein it was held as under:\n\n \"(I) Power conferred under \nSection 482\n of the Code is to be\n\n distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound the\n offences under \nSection 320\n of the Code. No doubt, under \nSection 482\n\n of the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the criminal\n proceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable, where\n\n the parties have settled the matter between themselves. However,\n this power is t to be exercised sparingly and with caution.\n (II) When the parties have reached the settlement and on that\n\n basis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the\n\n guiding factor in such cases would be to secure:\n\n (I) ends of justice, or\n (II) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.\n\n While exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on\n\n either of the aforesaid two objectives.\n\n (III) Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions which\n\n involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences\n like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature\n\n and have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for offences alleged\n to have been committed under special statute like the \nPrevention of\n Corruption Act\n or the of offences committed by Public Servants while\n\n working in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of\n compromise between the victim and the offender.\n (IV) On the other, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and\n pre--dominantly civil character, particularly those arising out of\n commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or\n family disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved\n their entire disputes among themselves.\n\n (V) While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as\n to whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and\n continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great\n oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to\n him by not quashing the criminal cases.\n\n (VI) Offences under \nSection 307\n IPC would fall in the category of\n heinous and serious offences and therefore is to be generally treated\n as crime against the society and not against the individual alone.\n However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because\n there is a mention of \nSection 307\n IPC in the FIR or the charge is\n framed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n\n 5\n\n examine as to whether incorporation of \nSection 307\n IPC is there for\n the sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence,\n\n .\n\n which if proved, would lead to proving the charge under \nSection 307\n\n IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the\n nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the\n vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. Medical\n\n report in respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the\n guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High\n Court can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of\n\n conviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the\n former case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the\n criminal proceedings whereas in the later case it would be\n permissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding the\n\n offence based on complete settlement between the parties. At this\n\n stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the settlement\n between the parties is going to result in harmony between them which\n may improve their future relationship.\n\n (VII) While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section\n 482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a crucial role.\n Those cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the\n\n alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under\n investigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the\n\n settlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is\n because of the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on\n\n and even the charge sheet has not been filed. Likewise, those cases\n where the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the\n evidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court can show\n benevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie\n assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the\n other hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or\n after the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at the stage of\n argument, normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its\n power under Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court\n would be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to\n come a conclusion as to whether the offence under \nSection 307\n IPC\n is committed or not. Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is\n already recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the appellate\n stage before the High Court, mere compromise between the parties\n would not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the\n offender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here\n charge is proved under \nSection 307\n IPC and conviction is already\n recorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of\n sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime.\"\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n\n 6\n\n 5. It would be seen that prior to Narinder Singh's case (supra),\n\n .\n\n \na three Hon'ble Judges Bench had considered the relevant scope of\n\n \nSection 482\n and \n320\n Cr.P.C. in \nGian Singh versus State of Punjab and\n\n another\n (2012) 10 SCC 303 wherein it was held that power of the High\n\n Court in quashing of the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in\n\n exercise of its inherent power is distinct and different from the power of a\n\n Criminal Court for compounding offences under \nSection 320\n Cr.P.C. While\n\n exercising inherent power of quashment under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., the\n\n Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime and its\n\n social impact. It warned the Courts, the High Court for quashing\n\n proceedings in heinous and serious offences of mental depravity, murder,\n\n rape, dacoity etc.\n \nwhich principles have been reported and reaffirmed in\n\n \nNarinder Singh\n's case (supra).\n\n \n6. Now the further question remains whether this Court can\n\n quash the FIR where the petitioners have been charged under Sections\n\n 341, 323, 504, 506, 452 read with \nSection 34\n IPC. This question need not\n\n detained this Court no longer in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court in Dimpey Gujral, W/o \nVivek Gujral and others versus\n\n Union Territory\n through Administrator, UT, Chandigarh and others\n\n (2013) 11 SCC 497 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court seized of a case\n\n seeking quashment of FIR and its consequential proceedings wherein the\n\n accused had been charged under \nSections 147\n, \n148\n, \n149\n, \n323\n, \n307\n, \n452\n\n and \n506\n IPC and the Hon'ble Supreme Court after relying upon the\n\n judgment of \nGian Singh\n's case (supra) held as follows:-\n\n \"7. In certain decisions of this court in view of the settlement\n arrived at by the parties, this court quashed the FIRs though\n some of the offences were non-compoundable. A two Judges'\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n\n 7\n\n Bench of this court doubted the correctness of those decisions.\n Learned Judges felt that in those decisions, this court had\n\n .\n\n permitted compounding of non-compoundable offences. The\n\n said issue was, therefore, referred to a larger bench.\n\n \nThe larger Bench in \nGian Singh v. State of Punjab\n (2012) 10\n\n SCC 303 considered the relevant provisions of the Code and\n the judgments of this court and concluded as under: (SCC\n pp.342-43, para 61)\n\n r to\n \"61. The position that emerges from the above\n discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the\n High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or\n\n complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct\n and different from the power given to a criminal court for\n compounding the offences under Section 320 of the\n Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no\n\n statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\n with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to\n\n secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the\n process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\n\n criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be\n exercised where the offender and victim have settled\n\n their dispute would depend on the facts and\n circumstances of each case and no category can be\n prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the\n High Court must have due regard to the nature and\n gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of\n mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\n etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or\n victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute.\n Such offences are not private in nature and have serious\n impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between\n the victim and offender in relation to the offences under\n special statutes like \nPrevention of Corruption Act\n or the\n offences committed by public servants while working in\n that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for\n quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences.\n But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-\n dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n\n 8\n\n purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising\n from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership\n\n .\n\n or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\n\n matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes\n where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature\n\n and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this\n category of cases, the High Court may quash criminal\n proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\n between the offender and victim, the possibility of\n\n conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of\n criminal case would put accused to great oppression and\n prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him\n\n by not quashing the criminal case despite full and\n\n complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In\n other words, the High Court must consider whether it\n would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to\n\n continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of\n the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of\n\n process of law despite settlement and compromise\n between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to\n\n secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal\n case is put to an end and if the answer to the above\n\n question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well\n within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 8. In the light of the above observations of this court in Gian\n Singh, we feel that this is a case where the continuation of\n criminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of\n law because the alleged offences are not heinous offences\n showing extreme depravity nor are they against the society.\n They are offences of a personal nature and burying them would\n bring about peace and amity between the two sides. In the\n circumstances of the case, FIR No.163 dated 26/10/2006\n registered under \nSection 147\n, \n148\n,\n149\n, \n323\n, \n307\n, \n452\n and \n506\n\n of the IPC at Police Station Sector 3,Chandigarh and all\n consequential proceedings arising there from including the final\n report presented under Section 173 of the Code and charges\n framed by the trial court are hereby quashed.\"\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n\n 9\n\n 7. On the basis of the aforesaid exposition of law, this Court is of\n\n the opinion that this is a case where the continuation of the criminal\n\n .\n\n proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of law because the\n\n alleged offences are not heinous offences showing extreme depravity nor\n\n are they against the society. They are offences of personal nature and\n\n quashing FIR and proceedings would bring out peace between two sides.\n\n 8. In these circumstances, FIR No. 199/2015, dated 10.8.2015,\n\n registered at Police Station, Sarkaghat, District Mandi under \nSections 341\n,\n\n \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n IPC by Smt. Bimla Devi( petitioner herein) against the\n\n respondent No.2 (herein) and criminal case pending in the Court of Ld.\n\n Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sarkaghat, District Mandi, under\n\n \nSections 341\n, \n325\n and \n504\n IPC and private complaint No. 19 of 2015 titled\n\n as Parhalad Chand vs. Bimla Devi and others, pending in the Court of Ld.\n\n Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sarkaghat, District Mandi, under\n\n Sections 323, 452, 504, 506 read with \nSection 34\n of IPC against Smt.\n\n Bimla Devi and others, are quashed. Resultantly, all the consequential\n\n proceedings emanating from the aforesaid FIR and private complaint are\n\n also quashed.\n\n 9. The petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms, so also\n\n the pending application(s) if any. The parties are left to bear their own\n\n costs.\n\n 10. However, before parting, the Court places on record its\n\n gratitude for the valuable assistance rendered by learned Mediator Shri\n\n S.C. Sharma, Advocate in bringing the aforesaid compromise between\n\n the parties.\n\n August 1, 2017. (Tarlok Singh Chauhan),\n (GR) Judge.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP",
