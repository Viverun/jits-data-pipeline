He had taken a loan in the sum of Rs.5600/- from\nsome person. Petitioner/accused Sandeep @ Chhuttan Tiwari\nwas middle man in the matter. On 13-03-2013, deceased\nYogesh Soni had gone to Tehsil office at Narsinghpur\nwhereon accused Chhuttan Tiwari and another person came\nand claimed that deceased was given Rs.10,000/- at the rate\nof 10% per month two months ago; therefore, the loan be\nrepayed immediately. They also threatened to beat him and\ncause harm to his family. Thereon, deceased Yogesh gave the\nregistration card of his motor cycle to him. When the\ndeceased went to re-claim his card, they obtained his\nsignatures on two documents. They caught hold of his shirt-\n collar and slapped him twice. In the result, the deceased\ncommitted suicide by consuming poison on 03-04-2013. Laxmi\nSoni, wife of the deceased, has stated under \nsection 161\n that\nin order to create pressure upon deceased Yogesh, accused\nChhuttan @ Sandeep Tiwari used to misbehave with the\ndeceased and humiliate him publicly and also by visiting his\nhome. Therefore, he was compelled to commit suicide.\nInviting attention of the Court to various judgments, it has\nbeen argued on behalf of the petitioner/accused that even if\nall the allegations made against him are taken at their face\nvalue, his act and conduct would not fall under the ambit of\nabetment of suicide.\n\nLearned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State on the other\nhand has supported the impugned order mainly on the ground\nthat the deceased was given loan at usurious rates of interest\nand he was repeatedly harassed and humiliated by the\naccused for repayment of loan. Therefore, he was compelled\nto commit suicide.\n\nA perusal of record reveals that the deceased has left a\nlongish though incoherent suicide note. During investigation,\nthe police has also recorded the statements of the relatives\nand acquaintances of the deceased. Before his death, he had\nalso written a letter to the Collector, District Narsinghpur,\nstating the reasons for committing suicide. This may also be\ntreated as his dying declaration.\n\nHowever, the question that arises for consideration is\nwhether the conduct of the deceased as brought forth in the\ndying declaration and the statements of witnesses constitute\nabetment of suicide?\n\n \nSection 306\n of the Indian Penal Code reads as follows:\n\nâ306. Abetment of suicide.- If any person commits suicide,\nwhoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term\nwhich may extent to ten years, and shall also be liable to\nfine.â\nTerm abetment has been defined under \nsection 107\n of the\nIndian Penal Code which is as hereunder:\n\nâ107. Abetment of a thing.- A person abets the doing of a\nthing, who-\n\nFirst-Instigates any person to do that thing; or\nSecondly- Engages with one or more other person or persons\nin any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or\nillegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy,\nand in order to the doing of that thing; or\nThirdly-Intentionally aides, by any act or illegal omission, the\ndoing of that thing.â\nIt has been held by the apex Court in the case of \nRamesh\nKumar Vs. State of Chattisgarh\n, (2001) 9 SCC 618 that:\nâTo satisfy the requirement of instigation though it it not\nnecessary that actual words must be used to that effect or\nwhat constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically\nbe suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty\nto incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out.\n\nThe present one is not a case where the accused had by his\nacts or omission or by a continued course of conduct created\nsuch circumstances that the deceased was left with no other\noption except to commit suicide in which case an instigation\nmay have been inferred (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Supreme Court has observed in the case of \nGangula\nMohan Reddy Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh\n, 2010 Cr.L.J.\n2110 (Supreme Court) that:\n\n\"20. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a\nperson or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing.\n\nWithout a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate\n or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.\nThe intention of the Legislature and the ratio of the cases\ndecided by this Court is clear that in order to convict a person\nunder \nSection 306\n, IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to\ncommit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act\nwhich led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option\nand this act must have been intended to push the deceased\ninto such a position that he committed suicideâ.....\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Supreme Court further observed in the case of \nRamesh\nKumar Vs. State of Chhattisgarh\n, (2001) 9 SCC 618 that:\n\nâThe present one is not a case where the accused had by\nhis acts or omissions or by a continued course of conduct\ncreated such circumstances that the deceased was left with\nno option accept to commit suicide in which case an\ninstigation may have been inferred.â\nLikewise in the case of \nMilind Bhagwanrao Godse Vs.\nState of Maharashtra and another\n, (2009) 3 SCC 699, it\nwas observed that:\n\nâThe circumstances enumerated in the suicide note and\noral evidence show that accused created circumstances\nwhich left no option for the wife but to take the extreme step\nof putting an end to her life.â\n\n18. On the same point, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in\nthe case of \nAman Singh Vs. State of M.P.\n, 2005 (2) JLJ 224\nobserved as hereunder:\n\nMore so, in this case the accused has not by his acts or\nomission or by a continued course of conduct created such\ncircumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except\nto commit suicide, in which an instigation may have been inferred.\nIt is pertinent to note that a co-ordinate Bench of this Court\n in the case of \nVed Prakash Vs. State of M.P.\n, 1995 Cr.L.J.\n893, with regard to suicide committed following attempts by\nthe accused to recover his loan held as hereunder:\n\nâThe accused persons were charge-sheeted under \nsection\n306\n read with \nsection 34\n of Indian Penal Code on the basis of\na suicide note left by the deceased in which he had blamed all\nthe five accused and held them responsible for his (suicidal)\ndeath. However, it was found that none of the accused had\ngoaded or urged forward, provoked, incited or urged or\nencouraged the deccased to commit suicide. They merely\ngoaded him to refund repay the amount of loan advanced by\nthem to him. They never intended that the deceased should\ncommit suicide. Moreover, the deceased could have lodged a\nreport against accused who had allegedly tortured him and\nthreatened him to kill. May be, as it sometimes happens, the\npolice officials might have declined to record the report. In\nthat case, he could have moved higher officials. But, instead\nof taking this legal and legitimate action, the deceased\nadopted an escapist course of committing suicide in order to\ntake revenge from his alleged tormentors. No case for\nalleged commission of the was made out against the accused\npersons. The prosecution of the accused would be nothing\nbut abuse of process of law. The charge-sheet filed against\naccused Quashed under \nsection 482\n of Criminal Procedure\nCode.â\nIn the case at hand, it is prima facie established that the\ndeceased had taken a loan in the sum of Rs.5600/- from some\nperson, through the accused. The accused claimed that the\nrate of interest was 10% per month. It is also established that\n the accused used to harass and humiliate the deceased in\npublic and also by visiting his home for repayment of loan.\n\nThe accused had probably taken possession of the Discover\nmotorcycle of the deceased in order to force him to repay the\nloan. However, a perusal of the dying declaration, written in\nhand, reveals that petitioner had also taken loan from three\nor four other persons as well. Accused Chhuttan was\nmisbehaving with the deceased for repayment of money.\nBeing unable to withstand persistent harassment, the\ndeceased committed suicide by consuming poison. However,\nit is clear that the petitioner had no intention of instigating or\ngoading the deceased to commit suicide, for the simple\nreason that with the suicide of the deceased, his chances of\nrecovering money practically vanished. Moreover, he could\nnot conceivably have foreseen that demand for repayment\naccompanied by pressure, would lead the deceased to commit\nsuicide.\n\nThough, the petitioner was harassing and beating the\ndeceased for the purpose of recovery of the amount and had\nalso taken possession of his Discover motorcycle, it cannot be\nsaid that the petitioner by his persistent conduct had created\nsuch a situation where the deceased was left with no option\nbut to commit suicide. He had several options before him; one\nof them was to stand up to the petitioner; other one was to\nhave taken recourse to law against the petitioner. However,\ninstead of exercising any of aforesaid options, he took\nextreme step of consuming poison. He probably had a flaw in\nhis mental make- up which made him more susceptible to\nadversity in life, than a normal person. However, the\n petitioner cannot be held to be legally liable for the same.\nThus, there is no sufficient ground to proceed against\npetitioner Sandeep @ Chhuttan under \nsection 306\n of the\nIndian Penal Code. Consequently, he is entitled to be\ndischarged in respect of aforesaid offence. It is for the trial\nCourt to consider whether any other offence is made out in\nthe facts and circumstances of the case on the basis of the\nmaterial available on record.\n\nIn the result, this criminal revision succeeds in part.\nPetitioner Sandeep @ Chhuttan is discharged in respect of\nthe offence punishable under \nsection 306\n of the Indian Penal\nCode. Learned trial Court is directed to consider the matter\nwith regard to charge afresh and after giving the accused\nperson an opportunity of being heard, frame such charge,\nother than the one under \nsection 306\n of the Indian Penal\nCode, if any, and proceed with the matter accordingly.\n\n (C V SIRPURKAR)\n JUDGE",
