RAMACHANDRA RAO, J.\n\n In this batch of LPAs and Writ Petitions, common questions of\n\n law arise and so they are being disposed off by this common order.\n\n A brief overview of the facts\n\n The respondents in the LPAs (except LPA-558-2019), the\n\n appellants in LPA-558-2019 and the petitioners in the Writ Petitions are\n\n land owners whose lands had been acquired under the \nNational Highway Act,\n\n 1956\n by the National Highway Authority of India (for short 'the NHAI') for\n\n the purpose of widening/four-laning of certain National Highways.\n\n Thereafter, matters were referred to the concerned District\n\n Revenue Officer-cum- Land Acquisition Officer (the Revenue Authority of the\n\n State) (hereinafter referred to as the 'competent authority') and he passed\n\n awards and awarded compensation, but while doing so, he did not grant\n\n benefits akin to those under Section 23, Section 28 and \nSection 34\n of the Land\n\n Acquisition Act, 1894.\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 6 of 45\n\n Writ Petitions were filed in this Court challenging the award of\n\n the competent authority by landowners without approaching the arbitrator\n\n under \nsection 3G (5)\n of the National Highway Act, 1956.\n\n They were partly allowed by a learned Single Judge of this Court\n\n which judgments are challenged by the NHAI in the Letters Patent Appeals\n\n being LPAs-4965-2018, 428-2019, 475-2019, 224-2019, 4968-2018, 280-\n\n 2019, 52-2019.\n\n In LPA-324-2019, the landowners did approach the Arbitrator and\n\n he passed an award under \nsection 3G(5)\n, but the said award was not challenged\n\n by them under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n Instead the land owners filed Writ Petition in this Court which was allowed by\n\n the learned Single Judge. The said order is challenged by the NHAI in the said\n\n LPA.\n\n In LPA-558-2019, the landowners had filed a writ petition\n\n challenging the arbitral award passed on 04.05.2016 by the arbitrator\n\n confirming the order dt.30.04.2012 passed by the competent authority, but the\n\n same was dismissed by the learned Single Judge on the ground that they have a\n\n remedy to challenge the same under \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration and\n\n Conciliation Act, 1996. This judgment is challenged by them in the said LPA.\n\n In CWP-18775-2019, CWP-25229-2019, CWP-14487-2019 and\n\n CWP-18799-2019, the landowners had not approached the statutory Arbitrator\n\n for enhancement of compensation granted by the competent authority under\n\n the National highways Act,1956 and had straight away approached this Court\n\n seeking the benefits akin to those granted under \nSection 23\n and \n28\n of the Land\n\n Acquisition Act, 1894.\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n \n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 7 of 45\n\n Contentions of the land owners\n\n The landowners place reliance on the judgment of the Division\n\n Bench of this Court in M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings vs. Union of\n\n India and Ors.1\n\n In\n M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n (1 supra), a Division\n\n Bench of this Court held that in acquisitions of land under the \nNational\n\n Highway Act, 1956\n, solatium and interest in terms of Section 23(2) and\n\n \nSection 28\n of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 should be granted to landowners\n\n and Section 3-J and Section 3-G of the said Act, which did not provide for\n\n payment of solatium and interest and other statutory benefits similar to the\n\n provisions contained in \nsection 23\n(1-A), \nsection 23(2)\n and \nsection 28\n of the\n\n Land Acquisition Act, 1894, were struck down.\n\n \nThis judgment was approved by the Supreme Court in \nUnion of\n\n India and another vs. Tarsem Singh\n and others2.\n\n \nThe Supreme Court in \nTarsem Singh\n (2 supra) noted that\n\n solatium and interest were awarded to landowners for compulsory acquisition\n\n of their lands for the purpose of National Highways until the National\n\n Highways Laws (Amendment) Act, 1997 was enacted; after the \nLand\n\n Acquisition Act, 1894\n was repealed and the \nRight to Fair Compensation and\n\n Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013\n\n (Act 30 of 2013) came into force, under section 105 of the said Act, a\n\n notification dt.28.08.2015 was issued directing that provisions of the 2013 Act\n\n relating to determination of compensation in accordance with the First\n\n Schedule would be extended to cases of land acquisition under the enactments\n\n 1\n\n 2011(4) R.C.R. (Civil) 375 (DB) dt.28.03.2008\n\n 2\n\n 2019(9) SCC 304\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 8 of 45\n\n specified in the Fourth Schedule; that the \nNational Highways Act, 1956\n was\n\n also mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to the 2013 Act; since the Government\n\n itself is of the view that solatium and interest should be granted even in cases\n\n that arise between 1997 and 2015, it cannot contend that landowners, who\n\n were not granted solatium and interest in arbitral awards, should avail the\n\n remedy under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\n challenging the awards passed under the \nNational Highways Act, 1956\n. It\n\n therefore declared that the provisions of the \nLand Acquisition Act, 1894\n\n relating to solatium and interest contained in \nsection 23\n(1-A), \nsection 23(2)\n\n and interest payable in terms of \nsection 28\n proviso will apply to acquisitions\n\n made under the \nNational Highways Act, 1956\n, and \nsection 3-J\n of the National\n\n Highways Act, 1956 was declared unconstitutional to the extent it did not\n\n grant the said benefits to land owners.\n\n Counsel for the land owners contended:\n\n \na) In a welfare State, statutory authorities are bound to pay adequate\n\n compensation to the land losers; inspite of delay, the High Court can grant\n\n relief since there is a compelling demand for justice; and delay and laches\n\n is not an absolute impediment to deny exercise of discretion in favour of\n\n the land loser when no third party interest is involved. They contended that\n\n no hard and fast rule exists that the High Court should always refuse to\n\n exercise its jurisdiction in favour of a party who moves it after\n\n considerable delay or is otherwise guilty of laches. They relied on the\n\n decision in Tukaram Kana Joshi and Others Vs. MIDC and Others3,\n\n 3\n\n 2013(1) SCC 353\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 9 of 45\n\nVetindia Pharmaceuticals Limited Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and\n\n Another4\n.\n\n \nb) That the decision rendered by a Division Bench of this Court, in M/s\n\n \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n (1 Supra) delivered on 28.03.2008 was\n\n not stayed by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.10695 of 2011 filed\n\n challenging it and the same was disposed of on 03.08.2017 as settled out of\n\n Court. They contended that \nthe said decision\n was binding on the competent\n\n authority and yet in the awards passed in all the matters in this batch after\n\n 28.03.2008 ( some on 23.4.2008 and others on 31.12.2014 and\n\n 21.12.2009), deliberately the competent authority passed awards denying\n\n the benefits under Sections 23(1-A), 23(2) and 28 of the \nLand Acquisition\n\n Act, 1894\n to the land owners who are deprived of land by virtue of\n\n notifications under the NHAI Act, 1956; this was impermissible on the part\n\n of the competent authority and amounts to contempt of the orders passed\n\n by this Court; and technical pleas ought not to be raised by the\n\n appellants/statutory authorities to deny legitimate claims flowing from\n\n statute to land losers.\n\n \nc) Prior to 1997, benefits under \nSections 23\n(1-A), 23(2) and 28 of the \nLand\n\n Acquisition Act, 1894\n were granted to all land losers whose lands were\n\n acquired under the \nLand Acquisition Act, 1894\n for purpose of National\n\n Highways; the State itself had taken a decision that solatium and interest\n\n should be granted even in cases that arise between 1997 when the\n\n amendment was made to the NHAI Act, 1956 and 2015 (as recorded in\n\n \nTarsem Singh\n (2 Supra)); and so the land owners are entitled to the said\n\n 4\n\n 2021(1) SCC 804\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 10 of 45\n\n benefits even if they did not challenge the awards of the competent\n\n authority before the arbitrator under Section 3J(5) of the NHAI Act, 1956\n\n or even if they did not challenge any arbitrator's award passed under the\n\n said provision under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n 1996 and they had directly filed Writ Petitions in this Court. It is\n\n contended that the NHAI cannot discriminate among the landowners and\n\n grant the said benefit to some of them and deny it to others similarly\n\n placed.\n\n \nd) That Supreme Court in \nTarsem Singh\n (2 Supra) (at para 52 of the SCC)\n\n had declined to interfere even in cases where applications under \nSection 34\n\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 had not been filed\n\n challenging the awards of the competent authority under the \nNational\n\n Highways Act,1956\n when the land owners had approached the High Courts\n\n directly under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India as in M/s \nGolden\n\n Iron and Steel Forging\n (1 Supra) ; that remedy under \nSection 34\n of the\n\n Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is not an effective alternative\n\n remedy because the Court cannot modify an erroneous arbitral award as\n\n was held in NHAI Vs. M. Hakeem5 and in other cases and so the writ\n\n petitions filed by them are maintainable.\n\n Contentions of counsel for the NHAI\n\n Shri Chetan Mittal, Senior Counsel for NHAI contends that in\n\n LPAs-4965-2018, 4976-2018, 52-2019, 324-2019, there is more than 10 years\n\n delay on the part of the landowners in challenging the awards passed by the\n\n competent authority; that in LPA-204-2020, 205-2020, there is more than 7 years\n\n delay on the part of the landowners in challenging the awards passed by\n\n 5\n\n 2021 (9) SCC 1\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 11 of 45\n\n the competent authority; that in LPAs-1536-2019, 1537-2019, 1539-2019, and\n\n 1550-2019,there is more than 3 years delay on the part of the landowners in\n\n challenging the awards passed by the competent authority; and on the ground\n\n of laches and delay in seeking relief before this Court, the landowners should\n\n be denied relief and orders of the learned Single Judge granting such relief\n\n should be set aside.\n\n The following is the table submitted by the counsel for the\n\n NHAI:-\n\n LPA No. Date of Date of Award Whether Benefits granted Delay in filing\n Sec. 3-A by competent challenged Writ Petition\n Notification authority before the\n Arbitrator\n ?\n\n LPA-4965-2018 24.12.2004 23.04.2008 No \nSec. 23(2)\n & \n10\n years, 3\n \nSec.28\n of the months, 22 days\n \nL.A.

There is no doubt that the learned Solicitor General, in the\n aforesaid two orders, has conceded the issue raised in these cases. This\n assumes importance in view of the plea of Shri Divan that the impugned\n judgments should be set aside on the ground that when the arbitral awards did\n not provide for solatium or interest, no \nSection 34\n petition having been filed by\n the landowners on this score, the Division Bench judgments that are impugned\n before us ought not to have allowed solatium and/or interest. Ordinarily, we\n would have acceded to this plea, but given the fact that the Government itself is\n of the view that solatium and interest should be granted even in cases that arise\n between 1997 and 2015, in the interest of justice we decline to interfere with\n such orders, given our discretionary jurisdiction under \nArticle 136\n of the\n Constitution of India.

And\n this plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ will\n not normally be exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other\n available remedies unless such action of the State or its\n instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the\n constitutional mandate of \nArticle 14\n or for other valid and legitimate\n reasons, for which the Court thinks it necessary to exercise the said\n jurisdiction.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n In the instant case, the NHAI contends that in view of the remedy\n\n of arbitration contained in \nsection 3G(5)\n of the National Highways Act, 1956\n\n to challenge the award of compensation made by the competent authority\n\n under section 3G(1) of the said Act, this Court ought not to have entertained\n\n 17\n\n 2004 (3) SCC 553\n\n 18\n\n 1998 (8) SCC 1\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 24 of 45\n\n the writ petitions filed by the landowners whose lands were acquired under the\n\n said Act.\n\n \nWe have already noted that a Division Bench of this Court in a\n\n judgment delivered on 28.03.2008 in M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n (1\n\n supra) held that landowners, whose lands are acquired under the \nNational\n\n Highways Act, 1956\n, are entitled to solatium and interest in terms similar to\n\n those contained in \nsection 23(2)\n and \nsection 28\n of the Land Acquisition Act,\n\n 1894.\n\n \nThis was challenged by the NHAI before the Supreme Court, but\n\n the Supreme Court, in Civil Appeal No.10695 of 2011, did not grant any stay\n\n of \nthe said judgment\n.\n\n \nOnly on 03.08.2017, Civil appeal No.10695 of 2011 filed against\n\n the decision of this Court in M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n (1 supra)\n\n was disposed of in terms of a settlement entered into between the parties.\n\n \nThus, the decision of this Court in M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel\n\n Forgings\n (1 supra) was holding the field between 28.03.2008 and 03.08.2017.\n\n \nThe decision in M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n (1 supra)\n\n was later specifically upheld by the Supreme Court in \nTarsem Singh\n (2 supra)\n\n on 19.09.2019 (at para 48).\n\n \nThe Supreme Court in \nSunita Mehra vs. Union of India19\n had\n\n taken the view that solatium and interest should be granted to landowners\n\n whose land is acquired under the \nNational Highways Act, 1956\n whose\n\n proceedings are pending on 28.03.2008 when this High Court pronounced the\n\n judgment in M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n (1 supra).\n\n 19\n\n \n2016 SCC online SC 1128=2019 (17) SCC 672\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 25 of 45\n\n Though the NHAI was a party to the said decisions and the\n\n principle of law \nlaid down in\n M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n (1 supra)\n\n was binding on it, yet in all the awards passed by the competent authority\n\n under \nsection 3G(1)\n of the National Highways Act, 1956 in respect of the\n\n landowners in the instant batch of cases, which awards were passed after\n\n 28.03.2008 (the date of the decision in M/s \nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n\n (1 supra)) ( from April 2008 to 2014), the competent authority did not follow\n\n the said principle and denied solatium and interest in terms akin to that under\n\n \nsection 23(2)\n and \nsection 28\n of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 to them.\n\n The competent authority cannot ignore binding precedents and decide\n\n contrary to it.

It held:\n\n \n\"9. Before we deal with the larger issue, let me put out of the\n\n way the contention that found favour with the High Court in rejecting\n the writ petition. The learned Single Judge as well as the Division\n Bench recalling the observations of this Court in \nAssistant Collector\n of Central Excise v. Jainson Hosiery Industries22\n rejected the writ\n petition observing that \"the petitioner who invokes the extraordinary\n jurisdiction of the court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution must\n have exhausted the normal statutory remedies available to him\". We\n remain unimpressed. Ordinarily it is true that the court has imposed\n a restraint in its own wisdom on its exercise of jurisdiction under\n \nArticle 226\n where the party invoking the jurisdiction has an effective,\n adequate alternative remedy. More often, it has been expressly stated\n that the rule which requires the exhaustion of alternative remedies is\n a rule of convenience and discretion rather than rule of law. At any\n rate it does not oust the jurisdiction of the Court.\n \nIn fact in the very\n decision relied upon by the High Court in \nState of U.P. v.\n Mohammad Nooh23\n it is observed \"that there is no rule, with regard\n to certiorari as there is with mandamus, that it will lie only where\n\n 21\n\n 1985 (3) SCC 267, at page 274\n\n 22\n\n 1979 (4) SCC 22\n\n 23\n\n AIR 1958 SC 86\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 30 of 45\n\n there is no other equally effective remedy\". It should be made\n specifically clear that where the order complained against is alleged\n to be illegal or invalid as being contrary to law, a petition at the\n instance of person adversely affected by it, would lie to the High\n Court under \nArticle 226\n and such a petition cannot be rejected on the\n ground that an appeal lies to the higher officer or the State\n Government. An appeal in all cases cannot be said to provide in all\n situations an alternative effective remedy keeping aside the nice\n distinction between jurisdiction and merits. Look at the fact situation\n in this case. Power was exercised formally by the authority set up\n under the Rules to grant contract but effectively and for all practical\n purposes by the Chief Minister of the State. To whom do you appeal\n in a State administration against the decision of the Chief Minister?\n The clitch of appeal from Caesar to Caesar's wife can only be\n bettered by appeal from one's own order to oneself. Therefore this is\n a case in which the High Court was not at all justified in throwing\n out the petition on the untenable ground that the appellant had an\n effective alternative remedy. The High Court did not pose to itself the\n question, who would grant relief when the impugned order is passed\n at the instance of the Chief Minister of the State. To whom did the\n High Court want the appeal to be filed over the decision of the Chief\n Minister. There was no answer and that by itself without anything\n more would be sufficient to set aside the judgment of the High\n Court.\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n Again in \nCIT v. Chhabil Dass Agarwal24\n, the Supreme Court\n\n declared as under:\n\n \"15. Thus, while it can be said that this Court has recognised\n some exceptions to the rule of alternative remedy i.e. where the\n statutory authority has not acted in accordance with the provisions of\n the enactment in question, or in defiance of the fundamental\n principles of judicial procedure, or has resorted to invoke the\n provisions which are repealed, or when an order has been passed in\n total violation of the principles of natural justice, the proposition \nlaid\n down in\n Thansingh Nathmal case, Titaghur Paper Mills case and\n other similar judgments that the High Court will not entertain a\n\n 24\n\n (2014) 1 SCC 603, at page 610\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 31 of 45\n\n petition under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution if an effective\n alternative remedy is available to the aggrieved person or the statute\n under which the action complained of has been taken itself contains a\n mechanism for redressal of grievance still holds the field.

In the instant case, the Act provides complete machinery for the\n assessment/reassessment of tax, imposition of penalty and for\n obtaining relief in respect of any improper orders passed by the\n Revenue Authorities, and the assessee could not be permitted to\n abandon that machinery and to invoke the jurisdiction of the High\n Court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution when he had adequate\n remedy open to him by an appeal to the Commissioner of Income Tax\n (Appeals). The remedy under the statute, however, must be effective\n and not a mere formality with no substantial relief. \nIn \nRam and\n Shyam Co. v.

In that case, the Supreme Court held that\n\n that delay and laches is only one of the facets to deny exercise of discretion but\n\n it is not an absolute impediment. If the whole thing shocks the judicial\n\n conscience, then the Court should exercise its discretion to entertain the writ\n\n petition, when no third-party interest is involved.

Possession of the land was taken in 1964 but no\n\n compensation was paid to the landowners/petitioners though others similarly\n\n situated were paid compensation in 1966. In 2009, the landowners approached\n\n the High Court which dismissed the writ petition on the ground of delay and\n\n laches but the Supreme Court reversed its decision by giving the above\n\n reasons.

Our Constitution is an organic and\n flexible one. Delay and laches is adopted as a mode of discretion\n to decline exercise of jurisdiction to grant relief. There is another\n facet. The Court is required to exercise judicial discretion. The\n said discretion is dependent on facts and circumstances of the\n cases. Delay and laches is one of the facets to deny exercise of\n discretion. It is not an absolute impediment. There can be\n mitigating factors, continuity of cause action, etc. That apart, if the\n whole thing shocks the judicial conscience, then the Court should\n exercise the discretion more so, when no third-party interest is\n involved. Thus analysed, the petition is not hit by the doctrine of\n delay and laches as the same is not a constitutional limitation, the\n cause of action is continuous and further the situation certainly\n shocks judicial conscience.\n\n \n13. The question of condonation of delay is one of discretion and\n has to be decided on the basis of the facts of the case at hand, as\n the same vary from case to case. It will depend upon what the\n breach of fundamental right and the remedy claimed are and when\n and how the delay arose. It is not that there is any period of\n limitation for the courts to exercise their powers under \nArticle 226\n,\n nor is it that there can never be a case where the courts cannot\n interfere in a matter, after the passage of a certain length of time.\n There may be a case where the demand for justice is so\n compelling, that the High Court would be inclined to interfere in\n spite of delay. Ultimately, it would be a matter within the\n discretion of the Court and such discretion, must be exercised\n fairly and justly so as to promote justice and not to defeat it. The\n validity of the party's defence must be tried upon principles\n substantially equitable. (\nVide P.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of\n T.N.8\n, \nState of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal9\n and \nTridip Kumar\n Dingal v. State of W.B.10\n)\n\n \n14. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to when the High\n Court should refuse to exercise its jurisdiction in favour of a party\n who moves it after considerable delay and is otherwise guilty of\n laches. Discretion must be exercised judiciously and reasonably. In\n the event that the claim made by the applicant is legally sustainable,\n delay should be condoned. In other words, where circumstances\n justifying the conduct exist, the illegality which is manifest, cannot be\n sustained on the sole ground of laches.

Chief Controller of Imports\n and \nExports11, Collector\n (LA) v. Katiji12\n, \nDehri Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District\n Board\n, Bhojpur13, Dayal Singh v. Union of India14 and\n \nShankara Coop. Housing Society Ltd. v. M. Prabhakar15\n.)\n\n 15. \nIn \nH.D. Vora v. State of Maharashtra16\n this Court condoned\n a 30-year delay in approaching the court where it found violation\n of substantive legal rights of the applicant. In that case, the\n requisition of premises made by the State was assailed.\"\n\n \nIn \nVetindia Pharmaceuticals Limited\n (4 supra) the Supreme\n\n Court reiterated the said principle and held that jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n\n of the Constitution of India is equitable in nature, and it is not a mandatory\n\n requirement that every delayed petition under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n\n of India must be dismissed on the ground of delay. It observed:\n\n \n\"15. That brings us to the question of delay. There is no doubt that\n the High Court in its discretionary jurisdiction may decline to exercise\n the discretionary writ jurisdiction on the ground of delay in\n approaching the court. But it is only a rule of discretion by exercise of\n self-restraint evolved by the court in exercise of the discretionary\n equitable jurisdiction and not a mandatory requirement that every\n delayed petition must be dismissed on the ground of delay. \nThe\n Limitation Act\n stricto sensu does not apply to the writ jurisdiction. The\n discretion vested in the court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n therefore has to be a judicious exercise of the discretion after\n considering all pros and cons of the matter, including the nature of\n the dispute, the explanation for the delay, whether any third-party\n rights have intervened, etc. The jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n being\n equitable in nature, questions of proportionality in considering\n whether the impugned order merits interference or not in exercise of\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 37 of 45\n\n the discretionary jurisdiction will also arise. This Court in \nBasanti\n Prasad v. Bihar School Examination Board7\n, after referring to \nMoon\n Mills Ltd. v. M.R. Meher8\n, \nMaharashtra SRTC v. Balwant Regular\n Motor Service9\n and \nState of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal10\n, held that if\n the delay is properly explained and no third-party rights are being\n affected, the writ court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution may\n condone the delay, holding as follows: (Basanti Prasad case7, SCC p.\n 796, para 18)\n \"18. In the normal course, we would not have taken exception to\n the order passed by the High Court. They are justified in saying that a\n delinquent employee should not be permitted to revive the stale claim\n and the High Court in exercise of its discretion would not ordinarily\n assist the tardy and indolent person. This is the traditional view and is\n well supported by a plethora of decisions of this Court. This Court\n also has taken the view that there is no inviolable rule, that, whenever\n there is delay the Court must refuse to entertain a petition. This Court\n has stated that the writ court in exercise of its extraordinary\n jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution may condone the\n delay in filing the petition, if the delay is satisfactorily explained.\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n In \nSukh Dutt Ratra v. State of H.P.25\n recently the Supreme Court\n\n declared in a case where the State deprived a person of property without\n\n following due process of law and sought to contest his case on ground of\n\n laches as under:\n\n \n\"18. There is a welter of precedents on delay and laches which conclude\n either way--as contended by both sides in the present dispute--however, the\n specific factual matrix compels this Court to weigh in favour of the appellant\n landowners. The State cannot shield itself behind the ground of delay and laches\n in such a situation; there cannot be a \"limitation\" to doing justice. This Court in\n a much earlier case -- \nMaharashtra SRTC v. Balwant Regular Motor Service26\n,\n held : (AIR pp. 335-36, para 11)\n \"11. ... 'Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or\n a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either\n because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as\n\n 25\n\n (2022) 7 SCC 508, at page 516\n\n 26\n\n AIR 1969 SC 329\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n [2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\n LPA-4965-2018\n 2018 and connected cases\n\n Page 38 of 45\n\n equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though\n perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it\n would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be\n asserted in either of these cases,\n cases, lapse of time and delay are most material.\n\n But in every case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be\n just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by\n any statute of limitations, the validity of that defenc\n defence must be tried upon principles\n substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are,\n the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which\n might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the\n one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy'\n remedy'.\"\n\n 19. The facts of the present case reveal that the State has, in a clandestine and\n arbitrary manner, actively tried to limit disbursal of compensation as required by\n law, only\n nly to those for which it was specifically prodded by the courts, rather than\n to all those who are entitled. This arbitrary action, which is also violative of the\n appellants' prevailing \nArticle 31\n right (at the time of cause of action),\n undoubtedly warranted\n warranted consideration, and intervention by the High Court, under\n its \nArticle 226\n jurisdiction.\"\n\n \nThe action of the competent authority under \nSection 3G (1)\n of the\n\n National Highways Act,1956 in denying the solatium and interest akin to that\n\n granted under \nSections 23(2)\n and \n28\n of the Land Acquisition Act,1894 inspite\n\n of binding precedents such as M/s Golden\n lden \nIron and Steel Forgings\n (1\n 1 supra)\n\n and \nSunita Mehra\n (19 supra) shocks our judicial conscience, and it seems\n ms that\n\n it is actively trying to limit the quantum of compensation as required by law\n\n being paid to only those for which it is specifically prodde\n prodded\n d by the Courts,\n\n rather than to all those who are entitled, and act arbitrarily.

Ordinarily, we\n would have acceded to this plea, but given the fact that the Government itself is\n of the view that solatium and interest should be granted even in cases that arise\n between 1997 and 2015, in the interest of justice we decline to interfere with\n such orders, given our discretionary jurisdiction under \nArticle 136\n of the\n Constitution of India. We therefore declare that the provisions of the \nLand\n Acquisition Act\n relating to solatium and interest contained in \nSections 23\n(1-A)\n and (2) and interest payable in terms of \nSection 28\n proviso will apply to\n acquisitions made under the \nNational Highways Act\n.

It should be made\n specifically clear that where the order complained against is alleged\n to be illegal or invalid as being contrary to law, a petition at the\n instance of person adversely affected by it, would lie to the High\n Court under \nArticle 226\n and such a petition cannot be rejected on the\n ground that an appeal lies to the higher officer or the State\n Government. An appeal in all cases cannot be said to provide in all\n situations an alternative effective remedy keeping aside the nice\n distinction between jurisdiction and merits. Look at the fact situation\n in this case. Power was exercised formally by the authority set up\n under the Rules to grant contract but effectively and for all practical\n purposes by the Chief Minister of the State. To whom do you appeal\n in a State administration against the decision of the Chief Minister?\n The clitch of appeal from Caesar to Caesar's wife can only be\n bettered by appeal from one's own order to oneself. Therefore this is\n a case in which the High Court was not at all justified in throwing\n out the petition on the untenable ground that the appellant had an\n effective alternative remedy. The High Court did not pose to itself the\n question, who would grant relief when the impugned order is passed\n at the instance of the Chief Minister of the State. To whom did the\n High Court want the appeal to be filed over the decision of the Chief\n Minister. There was no answer and that by itself without anything\n more would be sufficient to set aside the judgment of the High\n Court.\""
