Shri Syed Ali Imam, learned counsel for the applicant is not present. Shri Sanjay Kumar Pal, learned counsel holding brief of Shri Syed Ali Imam, learned counsel for the applicant is not prepared with the matter. \n\nNone appears on behalf of the first informant. Name of counsel for the first informant is shown in the cause list. \n\nThe applicant cannot be bereft of legal aid and the matter cannot be dismissed for non-prosecution in view of the judgement rendered by this Court in \nManeesh Pathak vs. State of U.P.\n in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 18536 of 2020. Shri Vijit Saxena, learned counsel is appointed as amicus curiae to represent the applicant and assist the Court.\n\nBy means of this anticipatory bail application the applicant has prayed to be enlarged on anticipatory bail in Case Crime No. 67 of 2024, under \nSections 306\n, \n498A\n, \n201\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n506\n I.P.C., Police Station-Lalkurti, District-Meerut. \n\nThe bail application of the applicant was rejected by the learned trial court on 30.04.2024. \n\nThe following arguments made by Shri Vijit Saxena, learned counsel on behalf of the applicant, which could not be satisfactorily refuted by Shri Shrawan Kumar Dubey, learned AGA from the record, entitle the applicant for grant of bail: \n\n1. The applicant is the mother-in-law of the deceased. \n\n2. The applicant never tortured the deceased or demanded dowry. \n\n3. The applicant never interfered in the marital life of the deceased and her husband. The applicant is bereaved by the death of her daughter-in-law. \n \n\n4.

The applicant undertakes that she shall not abscond and will fully cooperate in the investigations. The applicant shall not tamper with the evidence nor influence the witnesses in any manner. \n \n\nI see merit in the submissions of the learned counsel for the applicant and hold that the applicant is entitled to be enlarged on anticipatory bail. \n\nIn the light of the preceding discussion and without making any observations on the merits of the case, the anticipatory bail application is allowed. \n\nLet the applicant- Smt Ramo Devi is granted anticipatory bail till the conclusion of the trial in the aforesaid case crime number on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court below.
