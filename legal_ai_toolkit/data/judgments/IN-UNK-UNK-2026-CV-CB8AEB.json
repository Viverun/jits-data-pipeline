No.1360 of\n1990. Though, the special leave petition by the Union of\nIndia is barred by limitation, but in view of the fact that\nthe leave has been granted by this Court at the instance of\nthe private persons and the judgment of the tribunal is\nunder challenge in appeal, it would be meet and proper to\ncondone the delay in filing the special leave petition, and\nwe accordingly condone the same and grant leave therein.\n\n The inter se seniority in the cadre of Senior Clerk\nunder the Railway Administration between the promotees from\nthe grade of Office Clerk (Clerk Grade II) against 66-2/3%\nquota and the in-service graduates, working as Junior\nClerks, who were promoted through a limited departmental\nexamination against 13-1/3% quota is the subject matter of\ndispute. By the impugned order of the tribunal, the\npromotees who were initially promoted on ad hoc basis and\nlater on, whose services were regularised, have been held to\nbe entitled to count their ad hoc period also for the\npurpose of reckoning their seniority in the cadre of Senior\nClerk, whereas, according to the Railway Administration as\nwell as according to the appellants in Civil Appeal No.\n247/97, the criterion for determination of seniority being\nthe date of regular promotion after due process, the ad hoc\nperiod would not count for reckoning the seniority in the\npromotional grade, which is the grade of Senior Clerk in the\ncase in hand. Thus, the sole question that arises for\nconsideration is whether the services rendered by the\npromotees on ad hoc basis in the post of Senior Clerk can be\nallowed to be counted for the purpose of their seniority in\nthe cadre of Senior Clerk?\n\n The cadre of Office Clerk in the scale of Rs.950-1500 is\nfilled up, 66-2/3% by direct recruitment through the agency\nof the Railway Recruitment Board and 33-1/3% by promotion by\nselection of specified Group D staff, the minimum\neducational qualification for a direct recruit being\nmatriculate or its equivalent examination with not less than\n50% marks in the aggregate. The next promotional post is\nthe senior clerk in the scale of pay of Rs.1200-2040. Under\nthe Railway Establishment Manual, Paragraph (174), of the\ntotal vacancies in the grade, 20% of the posts are filled up\nby direct recruitment through the Agency of the Railway\nRecruitment Board, 13-1/3% through a limited departmental\ncompetitive examination from amongst the serving graduates\nclerks in the scale of pay of Rs. 950-1500 through the\nagency of the Railway Recruitment Board and 66-2/3% are\nfilled up by promotion from the Office Clerks. The present\nappellants were appointed on different dates as Office\nClerks (Clerk Grade II) in the year 1981-82, and all of them\nare graduates. The private respondents were non-graduates\nand were serving as Office Clerks in the scale of pay of\nRs.950- 1500. On diverse dates between 9.12.1982 to\n07.1.1984, these private respondents were promoted to the\npost of Senior Clerk on ad hoc basis, as no regular\nrecruitment could be made by holding suitability test,\nbecause of certain stay orders passed by different Courts.\nOn 18.1.85, the appellants were declared suitable for\npromotion to the grade of Senior Clerk against 13-1/3% meant\nfor in-service graduate office clerks. The suitability test\nof the private respondents, who had been promoted on ad hoc\nbasis was held and the result was declared on 28.2.1985.\nThe Railway Administration published a seniority list on\n01.01.88, but the same had not been prepared in accordance\nwith the relevant provisions for determination of seniority,\nas contained in paragraph 302 of the Railway Establishment\nManual. A revised seniority list, therefore, was prepared\non 02.11.89, in which list, the appellants were shown senior\nto the private respondents in the cadre of Senior Clerk, on\nthe basis of the date of regular promotion, after due\nprocess of selection. The private respondents herein,\nchallenged the legality of the aforesaid seniority list by\nfiling O.A. No. 1360/90 in the Central Administrative\nTribunal, Calcutta Bench. By the impugned judgment, the\ntribunal having allowed the O.A. on the conclusion that the\nperiod of ad hoc service of the respondents would count for\ntheir seniority, since the suitability test was delayed by\nthe Administration over which the private respondents had no\nhand and having quashed the seniority list published on\n2.11.89, and the private respondents having been declared\nsenior to the present appellants, the present appeal has\nbeen filed by grant of special leave and the Railway\nAdministration has also filed the special leave petition.\n\n \nMr. L.N. Rao, the learned senior counsel, appearing\nfor the appellants and Mr. P.P.Malhotra, the learned senior\ncounsel, appearing for the Railway Administration, contend\nthat the question of inter se seniority in the cadre of\nSenior Clerk being governed by the provisions contained in\nparagraph 302 of the Railway Establishment Manual and in\ncase of promotees, the criterion for determination of\nseniority being the date of regular promotion, after due\nprocess, the period of service rendered as ad hoc appointees\ncannot be counted for the purpose of seniority and the\ntribunal, therefore, committed serious error in counting the\nsaid ad hoc period and directing the private respondents to\nbe senior to the appellants. It is further contended that\nthe promotion of a railway servant to fill any post, whether\na selection post or a non-selection post being subject to\nhis found fit and only after passing the test, which is\ncondition precedent for being considered fit to hold the\npromotional post and such a test in case of promotees having\nbeen made only in the year 1985 and the results thereof\nhaving been declared only on 28.2.1985, so far as the\nprivate respondents are concerned, the period prior to that\ndate, during which they were holding the promotional post on\nad hoc basis, could not have been counted for determining\ntheir seniority in the cadre of Senior Clerk and the\nimpugned order of the tribunal, therefore is erroneous. It\nwas then contended that in view of the provisions contained\nin the Railway Establishment Manual, providing the procedure\nfor promotion to the post of Senior Clerk, the ad hoc\npromotion given to the private respondents cannot, but be\nheld to be promotion de hors the rules, and the conclusion\nof the tribunal to the contrary, solely on the ground that\nthe suitability test had not been held at regular intervals,\nas provided in paragraph 214(c)(v) of the rules and the\nemployees had no fault, is erroneous. Lastly, it is\ncontended that in view of the decision of this Court in the\ncase of \nAnuradha Mukherjee and Ors. vs. Union of India and\nOrs.\n, 1996(9) S.C.C. 59, clearly indicating that ad hoc\nappointees being appointees de hors the rules, cannot get\ntheir seniority from the date of their ad hoc appointment,\nbut only from the date on which they were actually selected\nand appointed, in accordance with the rules, interpreting\nthe very provisions of the Railway Establishment Manual, the\nimpugned decision of tribunal is unsustainable.\n\n \nMr. P.P. Rao, the learned senior counsel, appearing\nfor the private respondents, on the other hand contended\nthat inaction on the part of the Railway Administration, to\nhold the suitability test for adjudging the eligibility of\nthe Office Clerks for promotion to the post of Senior Clerk\nagainst their quota of 66-2/3% and the promotions granted to\nsuch office clerks on ad hoc basis, who were eligible and\nfound suitable, cannot be a ground for not counting the ad\nhoc period for reckoning seniority in the cadre of Senior\nClerk, when these promotees were otherwise suitable and in\nfact continuously holding the post of Senior Clerk on ad hoc\nbasis till their suitability was adjudged by holding the\ntest. The tribunal, therefore, was justified in reckoning\nthe ad hoc period for the purpose of their seniority in the\ncadre of Senior Clerk. Mr. Rao further contended that\nthese promotees having been promoted on ad hoc basis and\nbeing otherwise duly qualified to hold the promotional post\nand, thereafter having passed the suitability test later on,\nthe past services rendered by them on ad hoc basis has to be\ngiven credit, and the tribunal, therefore was right in its\nconclusion. Mr. Rao also urged that on account of lapses\non the part of the administration in not holding the\nsuitability test at regular intervals, as required under the\nrelevant provisions of the Railway Establishment Manual, the\nrespondents cannot be made to suffer and great injustice\nwould be meted out to them, if the period rendered as ad hoc\nis not taken into account for the purpose of seniority. Mr.\nRao, further urged that the promotees, not having been\npromoted beyond 66-2/3% quota available for them and in\nfact, there having been no impediment for granting regular\npromotion, which was not done because of the latches on the\npart of the Railway Administration in holding the\nsuitability test, there is no rhyme or reason, not to count\nthe ad hoc services for the purposes of seniority in the\npromoted cadre of Senior Clerk. Mr. Rao urged that the\ndecision of this Court in \nAnuradha Mukherjees\n case will\nhave no application to the case in hand as the Court \nin that\ncase\n was not dealing with the fact situation, where the\nAdministration is guilty of not having the suitability test\nat regular intervals, as required under the Establishment\nManual. Mr. Rao lastly submitted that during the pendency\nof this appeal, the competent authority having approved and\nregularised the ad hoc officiating promotion, as a one time\nmeasure and as a special case, as per the letter of the\nChief Personnel Officer dated 17th July, 2000, in the eye of\nlaw, it cannot be said that they continued as ad hoc, and\ntherefore, the conclusion of the tribunal is unassailable.\n\n In view of the rival submissions made by the counsel for\nthe parties, the following questions arise for our\nconsideration:\n\n (a) What is the Rule, which governs the inter se\nseniority between the two competitive claimants in the cadre\nof Senior Clerk?\n\n (b) The so-called ad hoc promotion of the respondents to\nthe cadre of Senior Clerk, whether can be held to be a\nregular promotion, after due process of selection, merely\nbecause the suitability test had not been held at regular\nintervals, as was required to be held under paragraph\n214(c)(v) of the Railway Establishment Manual?\n\n (c) Is it possible to hold that on regular promotion\nbeing given, after adjudging the suitability of the ad hoc\nemployees by holding test, it dates back to the date of ad\nhoc promotion?\n\n \n(d) Can it be said that the earlier decision of this\nCourt in \nAnuradha Mukherjees\n case, will have no application\nto the fact situation of the present case?\n\n So far as the first question is concerned, the post of\nSenior Clerk in the scale of pay of Rs.1200-2040 being\nfilled up by direct recruitment, by promotion and by limited\ndepartmental competitive examination from amongst serving\ngraduates, the provisions of paragraph 302 of the IREM would\ngovern the seniority in the grade. The aforesaid provision\nis extracted herein below in extenso:\n\n 302. Seniority in initial recruitment grades - Unless\nspecifically stated otherwise, the seniority among the\nincumbents of a post in a grade is governed by the date of\nappointment to the grade. The grant of pay higher than the\ninitial pay should not, as a rule, confer on a railway\nservant seniority above those who are already appointed\nagainst regular posts. In categories of posts partially\nfilled by direct recruitment and partially by promotion, the\ncriterion for determination of seniority should be the date\nof regular promotion after due process in the case of\npromotees and the date of joining the working post after due\nprocess in the case of direct recruit, subject to\nmaintenance of inter-se seniority of promotees and direct\nrecruits among themselves. When the dates of entry into a\ngrade of promoted railway servants and direct recruits are\nthe same they should be put in alternate positions, the\npromotees being senior to the direct recruits, maintaining\ninter-se seniority of each group.\n\n Note- In case the training period of a direct recruit is\ncurtailed in the exigencies of service, the date of joining\nthe working post in case of such a direct recruit shall be\nthe date he would have normally come to a working post after\ncompletion of the prescribed period of training.\n\n On a plain reading of the aforesaid provision, it is\ncrystal clear that date of regular promotion after due\nprocess of selection would be the date from which seniority\nin the cadre of Senior Clerk would count. In the case in\nhand, the appointment of the respondents in the cadre of\nSenior Clerk against 66-2/3% quota as well as the\nappointment of the appellants in the said grade against\n13-1/3% quota, through limited departmental competitive\nexamination are by way of promotion from the cadre of Office\nClerk. The inter se seniority, therefore, of these two\ncategory of personnel in the cadre of Senior Clerk, would be\nfrom the date on which each one of them were promoted after\ntheir regular selection by due process of selection. In\nother words, when promotion is given after holding the\nsuitability test, on adjudging the suitability of the\nemployee, then the promotion can be held to be a regular\npromotion and not earlier. In the case in hand, so far as\nthe appellants are concerned, the relevant date would be\n18.1.1985 and so far as the respondents are concerned, the\nrelevant date would be 28.2.1985. The ad hoc services\nrendered by the respondents for different periods from\n9.12.1982 till they were regularly absorbed on adjudging\ntheir suitability by holding test, cannot be reckoned for\nthe purposes of their seniority in the cadre of senior\nclerk. The conclusion of the tribunal is contrary to the\naforesaid provision of the Railway Establishment Manual and\ncannot be sustained.\n\n Coming to the second question, the relevant provision\ndealing with this aspect is paragraph 214 of the Railway\nEstablishment Manual. Paragraph 213 also deals with the\nquestion of promotion. Both the above-said paragraphs are\nquoted herein below in extenso:\n\n 213. Promotion.\n\n (a) A Railway servant may be promoted to fill any post\nwhether a selection post or a non- selection post only if he\nis considered fit to perform the duties attached to the\npost. The General Manager or the Head of Department or\nDivisional Railway Manager may prescribe the passing of\nspecified departmental or other tests as conditions\nprecedent to a Railway servant being considered fit to hold\nspecified post; such rules should be published for the\ninformation of the staff concerned.\n\n (b) Unless specifically provided otherwise, the\npromotion shall be made without any regard for communal or\nracial consideration.\n\n 214.(a) Non-selection posts will be filled by promotion\nof the senior most suitable Railway servant . Suitability\nwhether an individual or a group of Railway Servants being\ndetermined by the authority competent to fill the posts on\nthe basis of the record of service and/or departmental tests\nif necessary. A senior Railway servant may be passed over\nonly if he/she has been declared unfit for holding the post\nin question. A declaration of unfitness should ordinarily\nhave been made sometime previous to the time when the\npromotion of the Railway servant is being considered.\n\n (b)When, in filling of a non-selection post, a senior\nRailway servant is passed over the authority making the\npromotion shall record briefly the reason for such\nsupersession.\n\n (c)In respect of promotion to non-selection post, the\nfollowing principles should be followed:-\n\n (i)Staff in the immediate lower grade with a minimum of\n2 years service in that grade will only be eligible for\npromotion. The service for this purpose includes service,\nif any rendered on ad hoc posts followed by regular service\nwithout break. The condition of two years service should\nstand fulfilled at the time of actual promotion and not\nnecessarily at the stage of consideration.\n\n (ii)The number of eligible staff called for\nconsideration should be equal to the number of existing\nvacancies plus those anticipated during the next four months\ndue to normal wastage (i.e. retirement/superannuation),\nlikely acceptance of request for voluntary retirement, staff\napproved to go on deputation to other units, staff already\nempanelled for the ex-cadre posts, creation of additional\nposts already sanctioned by the competent authority, and\nstaff likely to go out on transfer to other\nRailways/Divisions.\n\n (iii)Where non-selection posts are filled from different\ncategories of staff, no hard and fast limits need be\nprescribed as to the number of the candidates to be admitted\nfrom each eligible category. In cases where posts are to be\nfilled on the quota basis it should be ensured that each\ncategory is adequately represented within the overall number\nof candidates called up. Employees passing the suitability\ntest should only be placed in the select list. Employees\nnot qualifying in the test should not be taken merely to\nmake up the quota fixed.\n\n (iv)An employee who has passed a suitability test once\nneed not be called for the test again and should be eligible\nfor promotion as and when vacancies arise.\n\n (v)A suitability test should be held at the interval\nwhich should not be less than six months. All the eligible\ncandidates as per their seniority including those who failed\nat the last test should be called. The period of six months\nis reckoned from the date of announcement of the result.\n\n (vi)If an employee fails in a suitability test but is\ncalled up again, a suitability test, after a time lag of six\nmonths and he passes the same, he should be given preference\nover his junior who had passed the suitability test earlier\nthan him but is still waiting to be promoted for want of a\nvacancy.\n\n It is thus apparent that a promotion can be given only\nwhen the employee concerned is considered fit to perform the\nduties of the higher post and a person can be considered fit\nonly after he passes the prescribed test held for the\npurpose. The post of Senior Clerk being a non-selection\npost, it is required to be filled up by promotion of the\nsenior-most suitable railway servant in the feeder cadre. A\nsenior railway servant can be superseded when he/she is\ndeclared unfit for holding a promotional post. The rules\nalso further provide that when a senior railway servant is\npassed over, the authority must record briefly the reasons\nfor supersession. The procedure for making promotion to\nnon-selection post has been indicated in paragraph 214(c\n)\n\nreferred to above\n. Clause (iii) of para 214(c),\nunequivocally indicates that the employees only after\npassing the suitability test, should be placed in the select\nlist and further those, who do not pass the qualifying test,\nthey cannot be given promotion merely to make-up the quota\nfixed for them. It is no doubt true that under Clause (v)\nof paragraph 214(c), a suitability test is required to be\nheld at interval, which should not be less than six months.\nBut in a case where such suitability test had not been held,\nas in the case in hand and persons are promoted from the\nJunior Clerk to Senior Clerk, on the basis of their\nseniority on ad hoc basis, such ad hoc promotion by no\nstretch of imagination can be held to be regular promotion\nafter due process of selection. It can be a promotion by\ndue process only when the suitability test, as indicated in\nparagraph 214(c)(iii) is held and the concerned employee\nqualifies the said test. It is necessary in this connection\nto notice some of the decisions relied upon by Mr. Rao,\nappearing for the respondents, in support of the conclusion\nof the tribunal that the suitability test not having been\nheld earlier, ad hoc promotion must be held to be regular\npromotion. \nThe first case which Mr. Rao relied upon is the\ncase of \nG.P.Doval and Ors. vs. The Chief Secretary,\nGovernment of U.P.\n and ors., 1985(1) S.C.R.70. In the said\ncase, the inter-se seniority amongst the Khandsari\nInspectors was the subject matter of dispute. There was no\nrule, governing the inter se seniority and in the absence of\nany specific rule of seniority, governing a cadre of a\nservice, the Court held that length of continuous\nofficiation will provide a more objective and fair rule of\nseniority. It is in this context, this Court had observed\nthat if a stop-gap appointment is made and the appointee\nappears before the Public Service Commission, when the\nlatter proceeds to select the candidates and is selected,\nthere is no justification for ignoring his past service.\nBut this decision will have no application where a rule\nsubsists, governing the inter se seniority in a cadre and in\nthe case in hand, the rule is paragraph 302 of the IREM.\nTherefore, the general principles enunciated in the\naforesaid decision will have no application.\n The next case\nrelied upon by Mr. Rao was the case of S.L.Kaul and Ors.\nvs. Secretary to Govt. of India, Ministry of Information\nand Broadcasting, New Delhi and Ors., 1989 Supp.(1) S.C.C.\n\n147. In this case, the seniority in the cadre of Monitor in\nAll India Radio was the subject matter for consideration.\nThe post of Monitor was upgraded and made equivalent to the\npost of Central Information Service Grade IV and was\nre-designated as Sub- Editors (Monitoring). The Central\nGovernment did the upgradation and enhancement of pay by\norder dated 29th June, 1968. But the relevant schedule was\namended and the posts were included in the Central\nInformation Service Grade IV by Notification dated 9th May,\n1972. It is in this context, this court held that the\nMonitors in All India Radio could be legitimately held to be\nin Central Information Service Grade IV w.e.f. 29.6.1968\nand not from 09.5.1972, as they had been inducted into Grade\nIV of the Central Information Service from 29th June, 1968,\nwhen the post was brought at par with Group IV and the post\nwas re-designated as Sub-Editor and the employees had\nreceived that post and pay after obtaining the approval of\nthe department of Personnel as well as the Union Public\nService Commission. \nIt is in that context, this Court had\nobserved that even though, the actual inclusion of the post\nof Monitor in the Central Information Service was made much\nlater, but the fact remains that they were to all intent and\npurposes, treated as Grade IV post in the Central\nInformation Service with effect from the date when the post\nof Monitor was re-designated with revised pay scales and\nbecame equivalent to Grade IV in the Central Information\nService. Therefore, on account of the lapse on the part of\nthe Government, the employees cannot be made to suffer.\nThis decision also in our considered opinion will have no\napplication inasmuch as under the relevant rules, holding a\ntest and passing of the test is a condition precedent for\npromoting an employee from the Office Clerk to the Senior\nClerk and any promotion in contravention of the same cannot\nbe a promotion on regular basis. The next case relied upon\nby Mr. Rao was the case of \nDevendra Narayan Singh and Ors.\nvs. State of Bihar and Ors.,1996\n(11) S.C.C. 342. In this\ncase the year of allotment of an officer was the subject\nmatter of consideration. The concerned authority had\ncommitted error by not preparing the select list for the\nyear 1983 and pursuant to the directions of the Supreme\nCourt, the appropriate authority on re-consideration,\nincluded the names in the select list for the year 1986.\nThe Court on consideration of the facts of that case came to\nhold that in the eye of law, the select list can be held to\nbe a select list for the year 1983 and, therefore, the year\nof allotment of the employee concerned is required to be\ndetermined on the basis that he was in the select list for\nthe year 1983, though that list was prepared in the year\n1985 and was approved by the Union Public Service Commission\nin the year 1986. We fail to understand, how the aforesaid\njudgment will be of any application to the case in hand,\nwhen because of interim direction in pending cases, regular\npromotion had not been given and the cadre of Senior Clerk\nwas being managed by granting ad hoc promotion to the\nrespondents.\n The next case relied upon by Mr. Rao is the\ncase of Suraj Parkash Gupta and Ors. vs. State of J & K\nand Ors., 2000(7) S.C.C. 561. In the aforesaid case, on\nconsideration of the relevant rules governing the service\nconditions of the Assistant Engineers of the J & K\nGovernment, the Court had observed that ad hoc or temporary\nservice of a person, appointed by transfer as an Assistant\nEngineer or by promotion as an Assistant Executive Engineer\ncan be regularised through the Publics Service Commission\nand Departmental Promotion Committee from an anterior date\nin a clear vacancy in his quota, if he is eligible and found\nsuitable for such transfer or promotion, as the case may be,\nand his seniority will count from that date. The aforesaid\nconclusion was drawn because of the provisions of Rule 23\nand Rule 15 of the J & K Rules but in the case in hand,\nthere is no provision, which has been brought to our notice,\nwhich enables the appointing authority to regularise a\npromotion from an anterior date, though the suitability test\nis held at a later date. In the absence of any such\nprovision in the rules in question, the ratio of the\naforesaid decision, on interpretation of the relevant rules\nof J & K Engineering Rules will have no application. In the\naforesaid premises, we have no hesitation in coming to the\nconclusion that merely because a suitability test had not\nbeen held at regular intervals, an employee promoted on ad\nhoc basis can claim that it is a regular promotion after due\nprocess of selection. As such the seniority of promotees in\nthe cadre of Senior Clerk can be counted only from the date\nof regular promotion, after due process of selection.\n\n So far as the third question is concerned, it is no\ndoubt true that the respondents, who got their ad hoc\npromotion between the period 9th December 1982 to 7th\nJanuary, 1984, were later on found suitable in the test that\nwas held and the result of the said test was published on\n28th February, 1985. It is also true that they had been\ncontinuing from their respective date of ad hoc promotion\ntill they were regularised, after being selected through due\nprocess. But that by itself cannot confer a right on them\nto claim the ad hoc period of service to be tagged on, for\nthe purpose of their seniority inasmuch as there is no\nprovision which says that an employee on being regularly\npromoted, such regular promotion would date back to the date\nof original promotion in the cadre, which might have been on\nad hoc basis. When the service conditions are governed by a\nset of rules, in the absence of any rules, it is difficult\nto hold that regular promotion would date back to the date\nof ad hoc promotion itself. We, therefore, answer the\nquestion in the negative.\n\n \nSo far as the earlier decision of this Court in \nAnuradha\nMukherjees\n case, [1996 (9) S.C.C. 59], is concerned, to\nwhich, one of us (G.B.Pattanaik, J), was a party, the Court\nwas considering the question of seniority in the very cadre,\nas in the case in hand. On consideration of the relevant\nprovisions, it did consider the case of appointees de hors\nthe rules, in paragraph 15 of \nthe said judgment\n, and it was\nheld that appointees de hors the rules can get seniority not\nfrom their initial appointment, but from the date on which\nthey are actually selected and appointed, in accordance with\nthe rules and their appointment and seniority would take\neffect from the date of selection, after due completion of\nthe process.\n \nMr. Rao contends that in the case of \nAnuradha\nMukherjees\n case, the Court had never faced the question of\nnon-holding of suitability test, as required under law. But\nthat in our view, will not change the effect of the\njudgment. The ad hoc promotion made in the present case,\nwithout holding any test for adjudging the suitability, has\nto be held promotion/appointment de hors the rules, and\ntherefore, the ratio of the aforesaid judgment would apply\nalso to the case in hand. Consequently, any period served\nby any promotee prior to 28.2.1985 on ad hoc basis cannot be\ncounted for the purposes of seniority in the cadre of Senior\nClerk.\n\n In view of our conclusion on the aforesaid four\nquestions, we unhesitatingly hold that the impugned judgment\nof the tribunal is wholly unsustainable in law, and we ,\naccordingly set aside the same. Necessarily, therefore, the\nseniority list as on 01.6.1989 and published on 02.11.1989\nis affirmed and O.A.No. 1360 of 1990 stands dismissed.\n\n Before we part with this case, it would be necessary\nalso to examine a situation which arises subsequent to the\nimpugned judgment of the tribunal, while the appeal was\npending in this Court. On behalf of the respondents, an\ninterlocutory application had been filed, appending the\nletters dated 25.2.1999 and 17.7.2000. Mr. P.P. Rao, the\nlearned senior counsel, appearing for the respondents placed\nreliance on the aforesaid document dated 17.7.2000 and\ncontended that the competent authority having approved the\nregularisation of ad hoc officiating promotion, as a one\ntime measure and as a special case, there would not be any\njustification not to treat that period for the purpose of\nseniority and, therefore, the conclusion of the tribunal can\nbe sustained on this ground also. It is true that the\ndocument has come into existence while the appeal was\npending and the appellants have not taken any steps by way\nof amending the memorandum, but the very proposal for\nregularisation of ad hoc period of service, as indicated in\nthe letter of the Divisional Railway Manager dated 25.2.99\nwould establish the purpose behind such regularisation. The\ncompetent authority felt that unless the ad hoc period is\nregularised, future complications, consequent upon the\nretirement may arise. It is, therefore, not to deny any\nretiral benefit, the ad hoc promotion was sought to be\nregularised and the appropriate authority did approve the\nsame as a one time measure with the caution that it should\nnot happen in future. But that would not change the\nprinciple of inter se seniority, which is governed by the\nprovisions, contained in paragraph 302 of the Railway\nEstablishment Manual, which we have already considered and\nanswered. Then again, from the aforesaid letter of approval\ndated 17.7.2000, it is not clearly discernible, as to\nwhether under the order in question, it is the service of\nthese respondents which was sought to be regularised. We\nneed not further delve into the matter, as in our view the\nso-called regularisation of ad hoc officiating promotion\nwould only confer the retiral benefit to the concerned\nemployees and would not count for the purposes of seniority\nin the cadre which has to be determined in accordance with\nthe rules, as already discussed. These appeals are\naccordingly allowed. There would be no order as to costs.\n\n36",

The next promotional post is\nthe senior clerk in the scale of pay of Rs.1200-2040. Under\nthe Railway Establishment Manual, Paragraph (174), of the\ntotal vacancies in the grade, 20% of the posts are filled up\nby direct recruitment through the Agency of the Railway\nRecruitment Board, 13-1/3% through a limited departmental\ncompetitive examination from amongst the serving graduates\nclerks in the scale of pay of Rs. 950-1500 through the\nagency of the Railway Recruitment Board and 66-2/3% are\nfilled up by promotion from the Office Clerks. The present\nappellants were appointed on different dates as Office\nClerks (Clerk Grade II) in the year 1981-82, and all of them\nare graduates. The private respondents were non-graduates\nand were serving as Office Clerks in the scale of pay of\nRs.950- 1500. On diverse dates between 9.12.1982 to\n07.1.1984, these private respondents were promoted to the\npost of Senior Clerk on ad hoc basis, as no regular\nrecruitment could be made by holding suitability test,\nbecause of certain stay orders passed by different Courts.\nOn 18.1.85, the appellants were declared suitable for\npromotion to the grade of Senior Clerk against 13-1/3% meant\nfor in-service graduate office clerks. The suitability test\nof the private respondents, who had been promoted on ad hoc\nbasis was held and the result was declared on 28.2.1985.\nThe Railway Administration published a seniority list on\n01.01.88, but the same had not been prepared in accordance\nwith the relevant provisions for determination of seniority,\nas contained in paragraph 302 of the Railway Establishment\nManual. A revised seniority list, therefore, was prepared\non 02.11.89, in which list, the appellants were shown senior\nto the private respondents in the cadre of Senior Clerk, on\nthe basis of the date of regular promotion, after due\nprocess of selection.

It is further contended that\nthe promotion of a railway servant to fill any post, whether\na selection post or a non-selection post being subject to\nhis found fit and only after passing the test, which is\ncondition precedent for being considered fit to hold the\npromotional post and such a test in case of promotees having\nbeen made only in the year 1985 and the results thereof\nhaving been declared only on 28.2.1985, so far as the\nprivate respondents are concerned, the period prior to that\ndate, during which they were holding the promotional post on\nad hoc basis, could not have been counted for determining\ntheir seniority in the cadre of Senior Clerk and the\nimpugned order of the tribunal, therefore is erroneous. It\nwas then contended that in view of the provisions contained\nin the Railway Establishment Manual, providing the procedure\nfor promotion to the post of Senior Clerk, the ad hoc\npromotion given to the private respondents cannot, but be\nheld to be promotion de hors the rules, and the conclusion\nof the tribunal to the contrary, solely on the ground that\nthe suitability test had not been held at regular intervals,\nas provided in paragraph 214(c)(v) of the rules and the\nemployees had no fault, is erroneous.

The tribunal, therefore, was justified in reckoning\nthe ad hoc period for the purpose of their seniority in the\ncadre of Senior Clerk. Mr. Rao further contended that\nthese promotees having been promoted on ad hoc basis and\nbeing otherwise duly qualified to hold the promotional post\nand, thereafter having passed the suitability test later on,\nthe past services rendered by them on ad hoc basis has to be\ngiven credit, and the tribunal, therefore was right in its\nconclusion. Mr. Rao also urged that on account of lapses\non the part of the administration in not holding the\nsuitability test at regular intervals, as required under the\nrelevant provisions of the Railway Establishment Manual, the\nrespondents cannot be made to suffer and great injustice\nwould be meted out to them, if the period rendered as ad hoc\nis not taken into account for the purpose of seniority. Mr.\nRao, further urged that the promotees, not having been\npromoted beyond 66-2/3% quota available for them and in\nfact, there having been no impediment for granting regular\npromotion, which was not done because of the latches on the\npart of the Railway Administration in holding the\nsuitability test, there is no rhyme or reason, not to count\nthe ad hoc services for the purposes of seniority in the\npromoted cadre of Senior Clerk. Mr. Rao urged that the\ndecision of this Court in \nAnuradha Mukherjees\n case will\nhave no application to the case in hand as the Court \nin that\ncase\n was not dealing with the fact situation, where the\nAdministration is guilty of not having the suitability test\nat regular intervals, as required under the Establishment\nManual. Mr. Rao lastly submitted that during the pendency\nof this appeal, the competent authority having approved and\nregularised the ad hoc officiating promotion, as a one time\nmeasure and as a special case, as per the letter of the\nChief Personnel Officer dated 17th July, 2000, in the eye of\nlaw, it cannot be said that they continued as ad hoc, and\ntherefore, the conclusion of the tribunal is unassailable."

It is in this context, this Court had observed\nthat if a stop-gap appointment is made and the appointee\nappears before the Public Service Commission, when the\nlatter proceeds to select the candidates and is selected,\nthere is no justification for ignoring his past service.\nBut this decision will have no application where a rule\nsubsists, governing the inter se seniority in a cadre and in\nthe case in hand, the rule is paragraph 302 of the IREM.\nTherefore, the general principles enunciated in the\naforesaid decision will have no application.\n The next case\nrelied upon by Mr. Rao was the case of S.L.Kaul and Ors.\nvs. Secretary to Govt. of India, Ministry of Information\nand Broadcasting, New Delhi and Ors., 1989 Supp.(1) S.C.C."

      "text": "147. In this case, the seniority in the cadre of Monitor in\nAll India Radio was the subject matter for consideration.\nThe post of Monitor was upgraded and made equivalent to the\npost of Central Information Service Grade IV and was\nre-designated as Sub- Editors (Monitoring). The Central\nGovernment did the upgradation and enhancement of pay by\norder dated 29th June, 1968. But the relevant schedule was\namended and the posts were included in the Central\nInformation Service Grade IV by Notification dated 9th May,\n1972. It is in this context, this court held that the\nMonitors in All India Radio could be legitimately held to be\nin Central Information Service Grade IV w.e.f. 29.6.1968\nand not from 09.5.1972, as they had been inducted into Grade\nIV of the Central Information Service from 29th June, 1968,\nwhen the post was brought at par with Group IV and the post\nwas re-designated as Sub-Editor and the employees had\nreceived that post and pay after obtaining the approval of\nthe department of Personnel as well as the Union Public\nService Commission. \nIt is in that context, this Court had\nobserved that even though, the actual inclusion of the post\nof Monitor in the Central Information Service was made much\nlater, but the fact remains that they were to all intent and\npurposes, treated as Grade IV post in the Central\nInformation Service with effect from the date when the post\nof Monitor was re-designated with revised pay scales and\nbecame equivalent to Grade IV in the Central Information\nService. Therefore, on account of the lapse on the part of\nthe Government, the employees cannot be made to suffer.\nThis decision also in our considered opinion will have no\napplication inasmuch as under the relevant rules, holding a\ntest and passing of the test is a condition precedent for\npromoting an employee from the Office Clerk to the Senior\nClerk and any promotion in contravention of the same cannot\nbe a promotion on regular basis. The next case relied upon\nby Mr. Rao was the case of \nDevendra Narayan Singh and Ors.\nvs. State of Bihar and Ors.,1996\n(11) S.C.C. 342. In this\ncase the year of allotment of an officer was the subject\nmatter of consideration. The concerned authority had\ncommitted error by not preparing the select list for the\nyear 1983 and pursuant to the directions of the Supreme\nCourt, the appropriate authority on re-consideration,\nincluded the names in the select list for the year 1986.\nThe Court on consideration of the facts of that case came to\nhold that in the eye of law, the select list can be held to\nbe a select list for the year 1983 and, therefore, the year\nof allotment of the employee concerned is required to be\ndetermined on the basis that he was in the select list for\nthe year 1983, though that list was prepared in the year\n1985 and was approved by the Union Public Service Commission\nin the year 1986. We fail to understand, how the aforesaid\njudgment will be of any application to the case in hand,\nwhen because of interim direction in pending cases, regular\npromotion had not been given and the cadre of Senior Clerk\nwas being managed by granting ad hoc promotion to the\nrespondents.\n The next case relied upon by Mr. Rao is the\ncase of Suraj Parkash Gupta and Ors. vs. State of J & K\nand Ors., 2000(7) S.C.C. 561. In the aforesaid case, on\nconsideration of the relevant rules governing the service\nconditions of the Assistant Engineers of the J & K\nGovernment, the Court had observed that ad hoc or temporary\nservice of a person, appointed by transfer as an Assistant\nEngineer or by promotion as an Assistant Executive Engineer\ncan be regularised through the Publics Service Commission\nand Departmental Promotion Committee from an anterior date\nin a clear vacancy in his quota, if he is eligible and found\nsuitable for such transfer or promotion, as the case may be,\nand his seniority will count from that date. The aforesaid\nconclusion was drawn because of the provisions of Rule 23\nand Rule 15 of the J & K Rules but in the case in hand,\nthere is no provision, which has been brought to our notice,\nwhich enables the appointing authority to regularise a\npromotion from an anterior date, though the suitability test\nis held at a later date. In the absence of any such\nprovision in the rules in question, the ratio of the\naforesaid decision, on interpretation of the relevant rules\nof J & K Engineering Rules will have no application. In the\naforesaid premises, we have no hesitation in coming to the\nconclusion that merely because a suitability test had not\nbeen held at regular intervals, an employee promoted on ad\nhoc basis can claim that it is a regular promotion after due\nprocess of selection. As such the seniority of promotees in\nthe cadre of Senior Clerk can be counted only from the date\nof regular promotion, after due process of selection."

      "text": "So far as the third question is concerned, it is no\ndoubt true that the respondents, who got their ad hoc\npromotion between the period 9th December 1982 to 7th\nJanuary, 1984, were later on found suitable in the test that\nwas held and the result of the said test was published on\n28th February, 1985. It is also true that they had been\ncontinuing from their respective date of ad hoc promotion\ntill they were regularised, after being selected through due\nprocess. But that by itself cannot confer a right on them\nto claim the ad hoc period of service to be tagged on, for\nthe purpose of their seniority inasmuch as there is no\nprovision which says that an employee on being regularly\npromoted, such regular promotion would date back to the date\nof original promotion in the cadre, which might have been on\nad hoc basis. When the service conditions are governed by a\nset of rules, in the absence of any rules, it is difficult\nto hold that regular promotion would date back to the date\nof ad hoc promotion itself. We, therefore, answer the\nquestion in the negative."

      "text": "So far as the earlier decision of this Court in \nAnuradha\nMukherjees\n case, [1996 (9) S.C.C. 59], is concerned, to\nwhich, one of us (G.B.Pattanaik, J), was a party, the Court\nwas considering the question of seniority in the very cadre,\nas in the case in hand. On consideration of the relevant\nprovisions, it did consider the case of appointees de hors\nthe rules, in paragraph 15 of \nthe said judgment\n, and it was\nheld that appointees de hors the rules can get seniority not\nfrom their initial appointment, but from the date on which\nthey are actually selected and appointed, in accordance with\nthe rules and their appointment and seniority would take\neffect from the date of selection, after due completion of\nthe process.\n \nMr. Rao contends that in the case of \nAnuradha\nMukherjees\n case, the Court had never faced the question of\nnon-holding of suitability test, as required under law. But\nthat in our view, will not change the effect of the\njudgment. The ad hoc promotion made in the present case,\nwithout holding any test for adjudging the suitability, has\nto be held promotion/appointment de hors the rules, and\ntherefore, the ratio of the aforesaid judgment would apply\nalso to the case in hand. Consequently, any period served\nby any promotee prior to 28.2.1985 on ad hoc basis cannot be\ncounted for the purposes of seniority in the cadre of Senior\nClerk."

      "text": "Before we part with this case, it would be necessary\nalso to examine a situation which arises subsequent to the\nimpugned judgment of the tribunal, while the appeal was\npending in this Court. On behalf of the respondents, an\ninterlocutory application had been filed, appending the\nletters dated 25.2.1999 and 17.7.2000. Mr. P.P. Rao, the\nlearned senior counsel, appearing for the respondents placed\nreliance on the aforesaid document dated 17.7.2000 and\ncontended that the competent authority having approved the\nregularisation of ad hoc officiating promotion, as a one\ntime measure and as a special case, there would not be any\njustification not to treat that period for the purpose of\nseniority and, therefore, the conclusion of the tribunal can\nbe sustained on this ground also. It is true that the\ndocument has come into existence while the appeal was\npending and the appellants have not taken any steps by way\nof amending the memorandum, but the very proposal for\nregularisation of ad hoc period of service, as indicated in\nthe letter of the Divisional Railway Manager dated 25.2.99\nwould establish the purpose behind such regularisation. The\ncompetent authority felt that unless the ad hoc period is\nregularised, future complications, consequent upon the\nretirement may arise. It is, therefore, not to deny any\nretiral benefit, the ad hoc promotion was sought to be\nregularised and the appropriate authority did approve the\nsame as a one time measure with the caution that it should\nnot happen in future. But that would not change the\nprinciple of inter se seniority, which is governed by the\nprovisions, contained in paragraph 302 of the Railway\nEstablishment Manual, which we have already considered and\nanswered. Then again, from the aforesaid letter of approval\ndated 17.7.2000, it is not clearly discernible, as to\nwhether under the order in question, it is the service of\nthese respondents which was sought to be regularised. We\nneed not further delve into the matter, as in our view the\nso-called regularisation of ad hoc officiating promotion\nwould only confer the retiral benefit to the concerned\nemployees and would not count for the purposes of seniority\nin the cadre which has to be determined in accordance with\nthe rules, as already discussed. These appeals are\naccordingly allowed. There would be no order as to costs."
