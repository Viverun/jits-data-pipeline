The present appeal has been filed assailing the order dated 03.02.2006\nvide which the Additional District Judge, Delhi has dismissed the application\nfiled by the appellant under\nOrder IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n,\n1908, seeking setting aside of the ex parte judgment and decree of divorce\npassed between the parties on 14.05.2003 in HMA No.849/2001.\n\n2.

Disputes and differences arose between the parties which led the\nrespondent-husband to file a divorce petition against the appellant on\n27.07.2001 in the Court of District Judge, Saharsa, Bihar.\n\n4. Subsequently, on an application of withdrawal being filed by the\nrespondent husband, the Court at Saharsa returned the Divorce Petition for\nbeing filed in the Court of proper jurisdiction.\n\n5. Thereafter, the respondent filed a Divorce Petition in the District Court,\nDelhi on 15.10.2001 under\nSection 13(1)\n(i-a) and (i-b) of the\nHindu Marriage\nAct, 1955\n[in short 'the Act'] premised on the ground of cruelty and desertion.\nThe summons was issued to the appellant-wife but she refused to accept the\nsame. Based on the report of the process server to the effect that the appellant\nrefused to accept the summons, the appellant-wife was proceeded ex parte in\nthe divorce proceedings on 08.04.2003. Eventually, the divorce petition was\nallowed and an ex parte decree of divorce on the ground of \"desertion\" was\npassed in favour of the respondent-husband and against the appellant-wife, on\n14.05.2003 by the Additional District Judge, Delhi.\n\n6. After about 18 months, on 25.11.2004 the appellant-wife filed an\napplication under\nOrder IX Rule 13 CPC\nalleging that the summons issued by\nthe court in the divorce petition was neither tendered to her nor she refused to\naccept the same. It was pleaded by her that she acquired the knowledge of the\nex parte divorce decree dated 14.05.2003 only on 30.08.2004, when the copy\nof said ex parte divorce decree was filed by the respondent-husband in her\nmaintenance proceedings pending in the Court at Madhepura, Bihar.\nAdditionally, it was pleaded by the appellant-wife that the respondent-husband\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

No. 2023:DHC:2686-DB\n\nhad earlier filed a divorce case in the Court at Saharsa, which was withdrawn\nby him for being filed in the Court at Madhepura in Bihar, therefore, the\ndivorce petition could not have been filed before the District Judge, New Delhi.\n\n7. The respondent filed his reply, pleading that the appellant was having\nknowledge of the Divorce Petition filed by him in Delhi and that he has already\nre-married to Smt. Sanju Devi, D/o of Sh. Ramji Prasad Bhagat on 24.11.2004\nas per Hindu rites and customs.\n\n8. Learned Additional District Judge, Delhi vide impugned order dismissed\nthe application of the appellant-wife under\nOrder IX Rule 13 CPC\non the\nground that the appellant-wife was aware of the divorce petition pending in the\nCourt at Delhi and that the contention that she had not been duly served and\nhad not refused to accept the notice of the petition, cannot be accepted. To\nreturn this finding, the learned Additional District Judge has relied upon the\npleadings and the orders passed in other litigations between the parties wherein\nthere is a specific reference to the divorce petition having been filed by the\nrespondent-husband in the Court at Delhi. The learned Additional District\nJudge also relied upon the cross-examination of the appellant-wife and her\nfather in a petition filed by the appellant-wife seeking maintenance [Misc. Case\nNo.27 /2001] wherein they had admitted about the pendency of the divorce\nproceedings pending between the parties. The material part of the impugned\norder reads as under: -\n\n\"The entire record thus speaks unequivocally to the effect that the\napplicant was aware of the divorce petition pending in the Delhi\nCourts through the anticipatory bail proceedings dated 25.02.2002 in\nthe Court of the Ld.

Case No.27/2001 in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First\nClass, Madhepura. The applicant was also aware of the pendency of\nthe divorce petition at Delhi, in view of order dated 16.09.2002 of the\nHon'ble High Court of Patna in Criminal Misc. No.12273/2002, the\nanticipatory bail application filed by the non-applicant, the applicant\nwas aware of the pendency of a divorce petition other than the divorce\npetition filed by the non-applicant, which was returned on 21.08.2001\nby the Ld. District Judge at Saharsha as being pending on the date\n31.11.2002, as per her statement dated 30.11.2002 in Misc. Case\nNo.27/2001, as per her cross-examination before the Court of the\nJudicial Magistrate, First Class, Madhepura, that the father of the\napplicant Sh. Vijay Kumar Bhagat was also aware of the pendency of\na divorce petition other than the divorce petition already withdrawn,\nas per cross-examination dated 02.12.2002 before the Court of the\nJudicial Magistrate, First Class, Madhepura in Case No.27/2001 and\nthe copy of that divorce petition was with the lawyer of the father of\nthe applicant, as per the cross-examination of Sh. Vijay Kumar\nBhagat.\n\nIt is thus apparent that the contention of the applicant that she was\nnot aware of the pendency of the divorce proceedings in the Court at\nDelhi and had not been duly served with the notice of the petition and\nhad not refused to accept the same cannot be accepted.\"\n\n9. The appellant who appeared in-person has submitted that the respondent-\nhusband has not only played a fraud upon the appellant but has also played\nfraud upon the Hon'ble Court. She submits that the earlier divorce petition was\nfiled by the respondent before the District Judge, Saharsa but the said petition\nwas withdrawn by the respondent stating that the Saharsa District court has no\njurisdiction and only the Madhepura District Court had jurisdiction and\naccordingly, such withdrawal was allowed by the District Judge, Saharsha on\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

She contends that the appellant always had an impression that the\ndivorce petition will be filed only in Madhepura Court, Bihar but the\nrespondent committed fraud by filing the divorce petition in the Court at Delhi.\nShe further submits that she had no knowledge about the divorce petition\npending before the Additional District Judge, Delhi. It is further contended\nthat the appellant was not a party to the anticipatory bail applications filed by\nthe respondent and his family members in Complaint Case No.577/2001,\ntherefore, knowledge cannot be attributed based on the averments made in the\nsaid applications or orders passed therein. She, thus, prayed for setting aside of\nthe impugned order as well as the judgment and decree of divorce dated\n14.05.2003.\n\n10. Per contra, Mr Neeraj Shekhar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe respondent, contends that the service of summons was earlier refused by\nthe appellant and such refusal has been recorded by the postal authorities on\nthe registered cover. Subsequently, the summons was directed to be served\nthrough the District Judge, Madhepura but the appellant again refused to accept\nthe same, therefore, a copy of the same was affixed by the process server on a\nconspicuous part of the appellant's residence. He thus, urged that the appellant\nwas duly served. He further contends that in any case, the defendant had notice\nof the date of hearing in the divorce petition, therefore, the learned Additional\nDistrict Judge has rightly refused to set aside the ex parte decree. To add\nemphasis to his argument, he invited attention of the court to - (i) order dated\n25.02.2002, whereby the anticipatory bail application of the family members of\nthe respondent-husband was dismissed; (ii) anticipatory bail application\nno.27/2002 filed by the respondent in Complaint Case No.577/2001 under\n\nSection 498A\n/\n/\nIPC; (iii) reply filed by the respondent in maintenance\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

He further refers to the statement\nof the appellant dated 30.11.2002 recorded in the Court of Judicial Magistrate,\nFirst Class, Madhepura in Misc. Case No.27/2001 seeking maintenance,\nwherein she has admitted that the respondent has filed a case of divorce against\nher. He also draws the attention of the court to the statement dated 02.12.2002\nof Shri Vijay Kumar Bhagat, father of the appellant, in the same case wherein\nthe appellant's father has admitted about the divorce case having been filed by\nthe respondent and a copy of the divorce case being in possession of their\nadvocate. The learned counsel further contends that not only the respondent\nhas remarried but he has two children from the said wedlock, therefore, the\npresent appeal is infructuous.\n\n11. We have considered the rival submissions made by the appellant\nappearing in-person, as well as, by the learned counsel for the respondent and\nhave examined the record.\n\n12. The mode of delivery of summons through registered/speed post and the\neffect of refusal by the defendant to take delivery of the postal article\ncontaining summons, has been provided in Rule 9 of Order V of the Code,\nwhich after the amendment of 2002, reads as under:-\n\n\"9. Delivery of summons by Court.--(1) Where the defendant resides\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court in which the suit is instituted, or\nhas an agent resident within that jurisdiction who is empowered to\naccept the service of the summons, the summons shall, unless the\nCourt otherwise directs, be delivered or sent either to the proper\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

No. 2023:DHC:2686-DB\n\n(6) The High Court or the District Judge, as the case may be, shall\nprepare a panel of courier agencies for the purposes of sub-rule (1).\"\n\n13. It is clear from the perusal of above provision that one of the modes of\ndelivering of summons as prescribed under Order 5 Rule 9(3) includes service\nthrough registered post acknowledgement due or by speed post. Order 5 Rule\n9(5) specifically provides that if there is a refusal by the defendant to take\ndelivery of the postal article containing summons and the same is received\nback by the Court with an endorsement made by a postal employee to that\neffect, the court issuing summons is obliged to declare that the summons had\nbeen duly served on the defendant.\n\n14. Order V Rule 17 of the Code deals with a somewhat similar situation\nwhere the serving officer tries to serve the summons and the defendant refuses\nto accept or sign the acknowledgement. Order V Rule 17 reads as under:\n\n\"17. Procedure when defendant refuses to accept service, or cannot\nbe found.--Where the defendant or his agent or such other person as\naforesaid refuses to sign the acknowledgment, or where the serving\nofficer, after using all due and reasonable diligence, cannot find the\ndefendant , [who is absent from his residence at the time when service\nis sought to be effected on him at his residence and there is no\nlikelihood of his being found at the residence within a reasonable\ntime] and there is no agent empowered to accept service of the\nsummons on his behalf, nor any other person on whom service can be\nmade, the serving officer shall affix a copy of the summons on the\nouter door or some other conspicuous part of the house in which the\ndefendant ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally\nworks for gain, and shall then return the original to the Court from\nwhich it was issued, with a report endorsed thereon or annexed\nthereto stating that he has so affixed the copy, the circumstances\nunder which he did so, and the name and address of the person (if\nany) by whom the house was identified and in whose presence the\ncopy was affixed.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

The above provision makes it evident that that when the defendant\nrefuses to sign the acknowledgement, the serving officer is obliged to affix a\ncopy of the summons on the outer door or some other conspicuous part of the\nhouse in which the defendant ordinarily resides and is obliged to return the\noriginal summons to the court from which it was issued, with a report endorsed\nthereon or annexed thereto stating that he has so affixed the copy, the\ncircumstances under which he did so, and the name and address of the person\n(if any) by whom the house was identified and in whose presence the copy was\naffixed.\n\n16. Initially summons in the divorce petition was issued to the appellant on\n16.10.2001 for 20.12.2001 but the postal authorities reported that on repeated\nvisits the addressee could not be found. Again, fresh summons was issued on\n20.12.2001 for 07.03.2002 but after repeated visits, the postal authorities gave\nthe report on 17.01.2002 that the addressee had refused to accept the registered\npost. In view of the endorsement of refusal, the service stood effected on the\nappellant but at that juncture the Court did not make a declaration that the\nsummons had been duly served on the appellant, in terms of Order V Rule 9(5)\n\nCPC\n.\n\n17. Summons was then issued on 16.05.2002 but the process issued was not\nreceived back. Vide order dated 28.11.2002, learned Additional District Judge,\nDelhi issued fresh summons for service through registered post, as well as,\nthrough the concerned District Judge, but the same were received back\nunexecuted.\n\n18. Again on 23.01.2003, summons was issued for 08.04.2003 through\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT. APP.(F.C.) 189/2022 Page 9 of 19\n\nASWAL\n\nSigning Date:21.04.2023\n\n14:58:35\n\nN.C. No. 2023:DHC:2686-DB\n\nregistered post, as well as, through the concerned District Judge. The summons\nsent through registered post were received back unexecuted with the report that\n\"lene se inkaar karne par chipka diya\". The process server also tried to serve\nthe appellant but as the appellant had refused to accept the same, therefore, a\ncopy of the summons and the petition, were affixed by him on a conspicuous\npart of the appellant's residence in the presence of two witnesses, namely, Sh.\nSanjeev Kumar and Chowkidar Sh. Paswan. The report of the process server,\nduly affirmed before the Nazir of the Court at Madhepura, is part of the lower\ncourt record. The service was thus, effected on the appellant as per the\nprocedure laid down in Rule 17 of\nOrder V CPC\n.\n\n19. On the basis of the report of the process server, and regard being had to\nthe previous refusal, the learned Additional District Judge, Delhi vide order\ndated 08.04.2003 proceeded ex-parte against the appellant. We are also of the\nview that the procedure adopted for effecting the service on appellant was\nproper and the service was complete. There is no irregularity in the service of\nsummons and the learned Additional District Judge has rightly held that the\nappellant had been duly served with the summons in the divorce petition.\n\n20. There is another aspect of the matter. Even if there is any irregularity in\nthe service of summons, still in view of the second proviso to Rule 13 of Order\nIX an ex-parte decree cannot be set aside on the ground of irregularity in\nservice of summons, if the Court is satisfied that appellant had notice of the\ndate of hearing and had sufficient time to appear in the Court. At this juncture,\nit is apposite to reproduce the provisions of\nOrder IX Rule 13 CPC\n, which\nreads as under:\n\n\"13. Setting aside decree ex parte against defendant.--In any case\nin which a decree is passed ex parte against a defendant, he may\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

No. 2023:DHC:2686-DB\n\napply to the Court by which the decree was passed for an order to set\nit aside; and if he satisfies the Court that the summons was not duly\nserved, or that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from\nappearing when the suit was called on for hearing, the Court shall\nmake an order setting aside the decree as against him upon such\nterms as to costs, payment into Court or otherwise as it thinks fit, and\nshall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit:\n\nProvided that where the decree is of such a nature that it cannot be\nset aside as against such defendant only it may be set aside as against\nall or any of the other defendants also:\n\nProvided further than no Court shall set aside a hdecree passed ex\nparte merely on the ground that there has been an irregularity in the\nservice of summons, if it is satisfied that the defendant had notice of\nthe date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear and answer the\nplaintiff's claim.\n\nExplanation.--Where there has been an appeal against a decree\npassed ex parte under this rule, and the appeal has been disposed of\nan any ground other than the ground that the appellant has\nwithdrawn the appeal, no application shall lie under this rule for\nsetting aside that ex parte decree.\"\n\n21. The Supreme Court in\nParimal Vs. Veena @ Bharti\n, (2011) 3 SCC 345,\nwhile noting the mandatory nature of the second proviso to Rule 13 of\nOrder\nIX CPC\n, observed that the Court shall not set aside the ex parte decree on mere\nirregularity in the service of summons in a case where the defendant otherwise,\nhad notice of the date of hearing and sufficient time to appear in the court. The\nrelevant para 12 of the judgment reads as under :-\n\n\"12. It is evident from the above that an ex parte decree against a\ndefendant has to be set aside if the party satisfies the court\nthat summons had not been duly served or he was\nprevented by sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was called\non for hearing. However, the court shall not set aside the said decree\non mere irregularity in the service of summons or in a case where the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

The legislature in its wisdom, made the second proviso\nmandatory in nature. Thus, it is not permissible for the court to allow\nthe application in utter disregard of the terms and conditions\nincorporated in the second proviso herein.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n22. Now, reverting to the facts of the case at hand; no doubt the factum of\ndivorce petition having been filed by the respondent in the Court at Delhi, has\nbeen mentioned in the - (i) application for anticipatory bail filed by the\nrespondent husband in Case No.577/2001 initiated by the appellant under\n\nSections 498A\n/\n/\nIPC; (ii) order dated 25.02.2002 of Ld. Session Judge,\nMadhepura rejecting the bail application filed by the family members of the\nrespondent/husband in the aforesaid case; (iii) reply to show cause notice\nsubmitted by the respondent in the Misc. No.27/2001 filed by the appellant in\nthe court of CJM, First Class, Madhepura claiming maintenance from the\nrespondent; and (iv) order dated 16.09.2002 passed by the High Court of Patna\nin Crl.Misc.No.12273/2002 granting anticipatory bail to the respondent; but\nthese documents do not indicate other details apropos the divorce petition viz.,\nthe number of the divorce petition, the Court before which it is pending and the\nnext date of hearing. Therefore, on the basis these documents at the best,\nknowledge of the divorce petition pending in the Court at Delhi could be\nattributed to the appellant but it cannot be said with certainty that she had\nnotice of the \"date of hearing\", which is a requirement under the second\nproviso to Rule 13 of\nOrder IX CPC\nfor not setting aside an ex parte decree on\nthe ground of irregularity in the service of summons.\n\n23.

I don't\nknow that when the case of divorce was filed.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n(ii) The relevant part of the statement dated 02.12.2022 of the\nappellant's father, Shri Vijay Kumar Bhagat, reads as under:\n\n\"19.

Advocate sahib has taken the\ncopies etc. of divorce case. It is not correct that divorce case was\nfiled at first.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nConjoint reading of the statements of the appellant and her father makes\nit evident that the appellant has been served with summons and she had handed\nover the copy of the divorce petition to her Advocate, which leads to the\nconclusion that the appellant had the notice of the \"date of hearing\" in the\ndivorce petition and had sufficient time to appear in the Court and answer\nrespondent's claim.\n\n24. Notably, the divorce suit filed in the court at Saharsa was withdrawn by\nthe respondent on 21.08.2001, while the divorce petition was filed by him in\nthe District Court, Delhi on 15.10.2001, therefore, the admission of appellant\nand her father made subsequently in their statements on 30.11.2002 and\n02.12.2002, respectively, as regard the divorce case having been filed by the\nrespondent, undoubtedly alludes to the divorce petition filed in Delhi.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

The contention of the appellant that the respondent withdrew the divorce\npetition filed before the District Judge, Saharsa for filing it before the District\nCourt, Madhepura but the respondent committed fraud upon the appellant by\nfiling it before the District Court in Delhi instead of Madhepura, is also without\nsubstance. The order dated 21.08.2001 of District Judge, Saharsa vide which\nDivorce Petition no.12/2001 was withdrawn from Court at Saharsa does not\nrecord that the divorce petition is being withdrawn for being filed at\nMadhepura. Rather the order mentions that the divorce petition is being\nwithdrawn for being filed before the Court of proper jurisdiction. The material\npart of the said order reads as under :\n\n\"A petition has been filed on behalf of plaintiff/petitioner praying\nthere in that to return the plaint in order to get it filed in a Court of\nproper jurisdiction as there appears no jurisdiction of this case in the\ninstant case. Heard arguments for the Plaintiff/Petitioner.\nSince the plaintiff/Petitioner himself wants to withdraw the suit, let the\nplaint of this suit be returned to him accordingly. Accordingly this suit\nstands disposed of.\"\n\nThe appellant, in any case, could have objected to the territorial jurisdiction of\nthe Court at Delhi to entertain the divorce petition filed by the respondent after\nentering her appearance in the divorce petition, but she chose not to appear\ndespite service and adequate notice of the date of hearing.\n\n27. Another submission of the learned counsel for the respondent is that\nafter seventeen months of the ex-parte decree, the respondent has remarried\nand now has two children from the second marriage - one son aged about 16\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

During the course of arguments, we\nhave specifically put to the appellant whether she admits second marriage of\nthe respondent, to which her reply is evasive. She states that the second\nmarriage of the respondent is not a subject matter of the present appeal and it is\nfor the court to decide about the legal status of the second marriage. The\nappellant did not, however, deny or dispute the factum of the respondent's\nsecond marriage. On the contrary, the respondent through an affidavit dated\n08.08.2007 has placed on record the fact that he has remarried on 24.11.2004.\n\n28. The legal status of the respondent's second marriage and its bearing on\nthe present appeal, however, has to be tested on the anvil of\nSection 15\nof the\nAct, which reads thus:\n\n\"15. Divorced persons when may marry again.--When a marriage\nhas been dissolved by a decree of divorce and either there is no right\nof appeal against the decree or, if there is such a right of appeal, the\ntime for appealing has expired without an appeal having been\npresented, or an appeal has been presented but has been dismissed, it\nshall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again.\"\n\n29. In terms of\nSection 15\nof the Act, either party to the marriage is well\nwithin his or her right to marry when the time for filing an appeal has expired\nwithout an appeal having been preferred, or an appeal has been presented but\nthe same has been dismissed. The bar or impediment to contract a second\nmarriage operates during the pendency of appeal only if an appeal is preferred\nwithin the period of limitation. In other words, the provision enables parties to\nmarry again only after the decree of divorce has become final.\n\n30. The provision of\nSection 15\nof the Act has been subject matter of a\nrecent decision of the Supreme Court in\nKrishnaveni Rai v. Pankaj Rai and\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT. APP.(F.C.) 189/2022 Page 15 of 19\n\nASWAL\n\nSigning Date:21.04.2023\n\n14:58:35\n\nN.C. No.\n2023:DHC:2686-DB\n\nAnr., (2020) 11 SCC 253. In that case the ex-husband of appellant wife\nremarried as no appeal was filed within period of limitation. The appeal was\npreferred by the appellant wife almost one year after the expiry of period of\nlimitation. In this factual backdrop, the Supreme Court held that bar of\nSection\nwas not attracted, it was lawful for the ex-husband to remarry and the\nappeal was infructous from the inception. The relevant extract of the judgment\nreads as under:\n\n\"28.\nSection 15\nclarifies that when a marriage has been dissolved by\na decree of divorce, and there is no right of appeal against the decree,\nor if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired\nwithout an appeal having been preferred, or an appeal has been\npresented but the same has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for\neither party to the marriage to marry again. Had it been the\nlegislative intent that a marriage during the pendency of an appeal\nshould be declared void, Section 11 would expressly have provided so.\n\n29. As held by this Court in\nAnurag Mittal v. Shaily Mishra\nMittal [Anurag Mittal\nv. Shaily Mishra Mittal, (2018) 9 SCC 691 :\n\n(2018) 4 SCC (Civ) 550] , the object of\nSection 15\nis to provide\nprotection to the person who had filed an appeal against the decree of\ndissolution of marriage and to ensure that such appeal was not\nfrustrated. The protection afforded by\nSection 15\nis primarily to a\nperson contesting the decree of divorce. As observed by Bobde, J. in\nhis concurring judgment in\nAnurag Mittal [Anurag Mittal v. Shaily\nMishra Mittal\n, (2018) 9 SCC 691 : (2018) 4 SCC (Civ) 550] : (SCC\npp. 702-703, paras 31 & 33)\n\n\"I am in agreement with the view taken by Nageswara Rao, J. but it is\nnecessary to state how the question before us has already been settled\nby the decision in\nLila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain [Lila Gupta\nv. Laxmi\nNarain, (1978) 3 SCC 258] .\n\nEven when the words of the proviso were\nfound to be prohibitory in clear negative terms -- \"it shall not be\nlawful\", etc., this Court held that the incapacity to marry imposed by\nthe proviso did not lead to an inference of nullity, vide para 9 of\nLila\nGupta [Lila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain\n, (1978) 3 SCC 258] . It is all the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.

No. 2023:DHC:2686-DB\n\nmore difficult to infer nullity when there is no prohibition; where\nthere are no negative words but on the other hand positive words like\n\"it shall be lawful\".\n\nAssuming that a marriage contracted before it\nbecame lawful to do so was unlawful and the words create a\ndisability, it is not possible to infer a nullity or voidness vide paras 9\nand 10 of\nLila Gupta\ncase [\nLila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain\n, (1978) 3 SCC\n258] . ...\n\n***\n\n33. What is held in essence is that if a provision of law prescribes an\nincapacity to marry and yet the person marries while under that\nincapacity, the marriage would not be void in the absence of an\nexpress provision that declares nullity. Quae incapacity imposed by\nstatute, there is no difference between an incapacity imposed by\nnegative language such as \"it shall not be lawful\" or an incapacity\nimposed by positive language like \"it shall be lawful (in certain\nconditions, in the absence of which it is impliedly unlawful)\". It would\nthus appear that the law is already settled by this Court that a\nmarriage contracted during a prescribed period will not be void\nbecause it was contracted under an incapacity. Obviously, this would\nhave no bearing on the other conditions of a valid marriage. The\ndecision in\nLila Gupta\ncase [\nLila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain\n, (1978) 3\nSCC 258] thus covers the present case on law.\"\n\n31. In any case, the bar of\nSection 15\nis not at all attracted in the facts\nand circumstances of this case, where the appeal from the decree of\ndivorce had been filed almost a year after expiry of the period of\nlimitation for filing an appeal.\nSection 15\npermits a marriage after\ndissolution of a marriage if there is no right of appeal against the\ndecree, or even if there is such a right to appeal, the time of appealing\nhas expired without an appeal having been presented, or the appeal\nhas been presented but has been dismissed. In this case, no appeal\nhad been presented within the period prescribed by limitation.\n\n32. The bar, if any, under\nSection 15\nof the Hindu Marriage Act\napplies only if there is an appeal filed within the period of limitation,\nand not afterwards upon condonation of delay in filing an appeal\nunless of course, the decree of divorce is stayed or there is an interim\norder of court, restraining the parties or any of them from remarrying\nduring the pendency of the appeal.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT. APP.(F.C.) 189/2022 Page 17 of 19\n\nASWAL\n\nSigning Date:21.04.2023\n\n14:58:35\n\nN.C. No. 2023:DHC:2686-DB\n\n33. As observed above, the appeal was infructuous for all practical\npurposes, from the inception, since the appellant's ex-husband had\nlawfully remarried after expiry of the period of limitation for filing an\nappeal, there being no appeal till then.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n31. When confronted with\nthe above decision\nin\nKrishnaveni Rai\n(supra),\nthe appellant submits that it will not apply in case where the husband has\nobtained ex parte decree of divorce and that too by committing fraud.\n\n32. It is trite that the dissolution of marriage is complete once the decree is\nmade. A decree of divorce breaks the marital tie and the parties forfeit the\nstatus of husband and wife in relation to each other. Each one becomes\ncompetent to contract another marriage as provided by\nsection 15\nof the Act1.\nIn law the effect of ex parte decree of divorce is not different from a contested\none. Even\nSection 15\nof the Act does not make any distinction between a\ncontested decree and an ex parte decree. Therefore, in case of an ex parte\ndecree of divorce also it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to\nmarry again if no appeal is filed against such decree within the period of\nlimitation.\n\n33. In the present case no appeal was preferred within the period of\nlimitation or even thereafter. The application under\nOrder 9 Rule 13 CPC\nwas\nalso filed after seventeen months from the date of ex parte decree as against\nlimitation period of thirty days from the date of decree as provided under\n\nArticle 123\nof the\nLimitation Act\n, despite the appellant having been duly\nserved with summons.\nIn the circumstances, it was lawful for the respondent\nSmt.

We have already observed that no\nfraud has been committed by the respondent. Summons was also served on the\nappellant as per the procedure prescribed in law. This being the position, an\napplication under\nOrder 9 Rule 13 CPC\nfiled by the appellant a day after the\nsecond marriage was solemnized by the respondent-husband, was infructuous\nfor all practical purposes, from the very inception. So is the present appeal.\n\n34. In view of the above, there is no merit in the appeal and accordingly, the\nsame is dismissed.\n\nVIKAS MAHAJAN, J.\n\nSANJEEV SACHDEVA, J.\n\nAPRIL 21, 2023\nMK\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NARENDRA SINGH MAT.
