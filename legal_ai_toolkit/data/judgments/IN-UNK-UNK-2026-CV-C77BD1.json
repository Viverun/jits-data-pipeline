Roy Barman, learned Addl. P.P.,\n\nappearing for the State-respondent.\n\n Page 2 of 23\n\n3) Prosecution case, as encompassed from the FIR is that\n\none Anima Das lodged a complaint with the O/C, Manu P.S. on\n\n16.03.2015, that her daughter Ranjita Das was given in marriage\n\nwith the appellant Biswajit Bhowmik of East Machli on 24th Sravana,\n\n1421 BS as per Hindu rites and customs. After marriage her\n\ndaughter was taken to her in-laws‟ house. They started to live\n\npeacefully but after one month thereafter her daughter was\n\nsubjected to physical and mental torture on demand of Rs.50,000/-\n\nas dowry by her in-laws. Her daughter informed them about the\n\ntorture over telephone and told that if they failed to pay the said\n\nsum of Rs.50,000/-, then, she would be killed. Under that\n\ncircumstance, the complainant being the mother paid Rs.50,000/-\n\nin cash to her son-in-law in presence of other members of his house,\n\nbut, even after that the in-laws of her daughter pressurized her to\n\npay again a sum of Rs.50,000/- which they also paid to the\n\nappellant on 1st Pousha. It was further stated that during that time\n\nher daughter was 7 months pregnant. She has further complained\n\nthat the appellant had illicit relation with another Chakma lady and\n\nfor that, he used to return home at dead hour of night and when her\n\ndaughter tried to protest, the appellant used to beat her black and\n\nblue. Thereafter, on 23rd Pousha they brought her daughter to their\n\nhome and during that time her daughter unfolded every episode of\n\ntorture. However, on 27th Pousha they again sent their daughter\n\nback to her in-laws‟ house, but her in-laws continued torturing her\n\nphysically as well as mentally. On 15.03.2015 at about 8 A.M., the\n\nin-laws of her house informed them that her daughter was admitted\n\nin Manu hospital in serious condition and requested them to see\n\ntheir daughter. Accordingly, she and her husband went to Manu\n\n Page 3 of 23\n\nhospital and found their daughter lying dead in the morgue of the\n\nhospital. On removal of the clothes from her body, they found injury\n\nmarks on neck and on other different parts of the body and they\n\ncould understand that their daughter was murdered by her husband\n\nand her in-laws.\n\n4) On the basis of this written ejahar, the Officer-in-\n\nCharge of the police station registered a case under \nSection 304B\n of\n\nIPC and subsequently, after investigation, the charge-sheet was\n\nsubmitted by investigating officer against the accused-appellant\n\nunder \nSection 304B\n/\n306\n of IPC.\n\n5) Cognizance of the offence was taken by the learned\n\nSub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Longtharai Valley and after\n\nexhausting all procedures, committed the case to the Court of\n\nlearned Sessions Judge.\n\n6) After perusal of the police report, the learned Sessions\n\nJudge framed the following charges:-\n\n \"Firstly:- That, you being the husband of Smt.\n Ranjita Das on 15/3/2015 and different dates and\n occasions before 15/3/2015 at 34 Card, East Masli under\n Manu P.S. subjected said Smt. Ranjita Das to cruelty\n both physically and mentally by making her harassment\n and causing physical assault with a view to coercing her\n and her parents meet unlawful dowry demand for cash\n money and on account of failure thereof to put her into\n assault and abused her off and on, and thereby\n committed an offence punishable under \nsection 498(A)\n\n of the Indian Penal Code and within my cognizance.\n\n Secondly:- That, you on 15/3/2015 at any time\n before 0800 hours at 34 Card, East Masli under Manu\n P.S. committed dowry death by causing the death of\n Smt. Ranjita Das of your wife and thereby committed an\n\n Page 4 of 23\n\n offence punishable under \nSection 304(B)\n of the Indian\n Penal Code and within my cognizance.\"\n\n7) To substantiate the charge-sheet, the prosecution\n\nhas examined as many as 26 witnesses. On closer of the\n\nprosecution evidence, the accused was examined under \nSection\n\n313\n of CrPC where the appellant denied the incriminating\n\nevidence against him and also did not adduce any evidence in his\n\ndefence.\n\n8) Mr. Samar Das, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant while urging for setting aside the judgment and order\n\nof conviction and sentence has contended that the learned Trial\n\nCourt while convicting and sentencing the accused-appellant\n\nunder \nSection 498A\n of the IPC mainly relied upon the evidence of\n\nthe related witnesses and there is no evidence to substantiate\n\nthat the appellant had demanded Rs.1,00,000/- in two phases as\n\ndowry.\n\n He further submits that evidence is absolutely absent\n\nin regard to the commission of offence under \nSection 304B\n of the\n\nIPC. The prosecution has also placed into service as many as 12\n\ndocuments Exbt-1 to Exbt-12, a hand-sketch map along with\n\nindex was also prepared by the investigating officer indicating\n\nthe place of occurrence.\n\n9) On perusal of the evidence, it reveals that P.W-1,\n\nP.W-4, P.W.-5, P.W.-15 and P.W.-26 are related witnesses of the\n\ndeceased-wife of the appellant being the mother, father, brother\n\nand sisters respectively. To determine sustainability of\n\nconviction, in my considered opinion, the evidence of the related\n\nwitnesses may be evaluated first.\n\n Page 5 of 23\n\n10) P.W.-1, the mother, Smt. Anima Das has deposed\n\nthat her daughter was given in marriage to the appellant\n\naccording to Hindu rites and customs as stated above and after\n\nmarriage her daughter lived happily for one month with her\n\nhusband. After about one month from the date of marriage as\n\nand when she used to telephone her daughter and wanted to talk\n\nwith her son-in-law i.e., the appellant herein, her daughter used\n\nto tell that her husband had not returned home till that time\n\nwhich might be around 11pm or 12 night and when she insisted\n\nher to tell her about the cause, she suddenly broke down and\n\nstarted crying and informed her that her husband was\n\nmaintaining illicit relation with one Menaka Chakma of East Masli.\n\nAt that time, her daughter also informed that the appellant\n\ndemanded Rs.50,000/- for the purpose of vegetable business to\n\nbe paid by the complainant. Hearing this information, they\n\narranged Rs.50,000/- and she carried the amount to the house\n\nof the appellant on the 2nd month of Pousha of that year and\n\nhanded over the amount to the appellant in presence of his\n\nmother. At that time, she stayed back for two days in the house\n\nof her deceased-daughter and on one night, when she was\n\nsleeping with the mother-in-law of her daughter, she suddenly\n\nwoke up and found her daughter walking here and there at dark\n\nnight and seeing that position she also got up with curiosity and\n\nthereafter, she found that the mother of the appellant had locked\n\nthe room of her daughter with lock and key and the key was\n\nkept outside the room so as to enable her son-in-law to enter\n\ninto the room at odd times of the night. When on the following\n\nday, she asked her daughter, she replied that her husband used\n\n Page 6 of 23\n\nto return home at odd hours of night. She informed the issue to\n\nthe father-in-law of her daughter but to no avail. She came back\n\nto her home after staying there for about six days and at that\n\ntime, she also took her daughter along with her. After about 20\n\ndays, the said witness escorted her daughter on her way back to\n\nher matrimonial home. After her return, she was assaulted by\n\nher husband for divulging the fact of his maintaining illicit\n\nrelation with Menaka Chakma and returning home every night at\n\nodd time. At that time her daughter was pregnant for three\n\nmonths. She had paid another Rs.50,000/- with a hope of her\n\ndaughter‟s peace. On day of 28th Phalguna of that year she was\n\ninformed by the father-in-law of her daughter that her daughter\n\nwas ill and admitted to Manu Hospital. When they rushed to\n\nManu hospital, she was telephonically informed by the father-in-\n\nlaw of her daughter to wait at the Manu PS gate and they were\n\ncoming by an auto and thereafter, they went to the hospital by\n\nthat auto along with the father-in-law of her daughter and when\n\nthey got down from the auto at Manu Hospital, the father-in-law\n\nof her daughter, Bimal Bhowmik told her that her daughter\n\nalready expired and hearing that information she became\n\nunconscious and thereafter, when she regained sense, she was\n\ntaken to the police station and at that time two brothers of her\n\nson-in-law were there and they did not allow her to telephone\n\nanybody. She had seen the dead body of her daughter in her\n\nmatrimonial home only at the night of that day. They were not\n\nallowed to shift the dead body and it was cremated there by\n\nthem. She identified the appellant in the dock.\n\n Page 7 of 23\n\n In her cross examination, she has stated that at the\n\ntime of marriage there was no demand for dowry. The\n\ninformation of illness of her daughter was first received\n\ntelephonically by her from the father-in-law of her daughter. She\n\nlodged the FIR in the next morning. On question, she has stated\n\nthat she did not mention in the FIR that her son-in-law used to\n\nreturn home late at night in the odd hours.\n\n11) P.W-4, Sri Rabindra Ch. Das is the father of the\n\ndeceased Ranjita Das. He has stated that one day her daughter\n\ntelephoned his wife that the appellant was having illicit\n\nrelationship with one Chakma lady and his daughter was\n\ndemanded by her husband to arrange Rs.50,000/-. He has\n\nstated that because of the illness of his wife they could not lodge\n\nthe FIR on the day itself and the FIR was lodged on the following\n\nday. Considering the overall circumstances, the said witness has\n\nstated that they suspected that their daughter was killed by the\n\nmembers of the matrimonial house of her daughter.\n\n12) P.W.-15, Smt. Laxmi Das has stated that the\n\ncomplainant Anima Das was the sister-in-law and the deceased\n\nRanjita Das was the daughter of Anima Das. She has stated that\n\nshe was told by the mother of the deceased that Ranjita Das was\n\ntortured by her husband on demand of Rs.50,000/- initially and\n\nthereafter further amount of Rs.50,000/- was paid when the\n\ndeceased was pregnant and altogether Rs.1,00,000/- was paid in\n\ntwo spells to the appellant. The said witness has stated that she\n\nwas told by Anima Das in the hospital that they found injury\n\nmarks in the abdomen, and on the throat and tongue was found\n\nlying outside the mouth.\n\n Page 8 of 23\n\n There has been no substantial cross by the appellant.\n\n13) P.W.-26, Smt. Aparna Rani Das was the elder sister\n\nof the deceased Ranjita Das. She has stated that the husband of\n\nher sister i.e., the appellant had illicit relationship with one\n\nMenaka Chakma and since she was raising objection to that\n\nrelation, her sister was put to torture by the appellant.

Das,\n\nP.W.4, the father of the deceased has not stated that he came to\n\nlearn from his wife that the room of his daughter was usually\n\nbeing locked from outside. He has further stated that it is also\n\nnot mentioned in the 161 \nCrPC\n statement of the Rabindra Ch.\n\nDas that reaching the hospital he found the dead body of his\n\ndaughter and also found the ligature mark in her throat and\n\nlearned that his daughter was killed by her husband. He has\n\nfurther stated in his cross examination that it is not mentioned in\n\n Page 12 of 23\n\nthe 161 \nCrPC\n statement of Rajat Das, P.W.5 that he came to\n\nlearn from his mother that his sister used to be locked in the\n\nroom from outside and also he did not mention in his 161 \nCrPC\n\nstatement that Dipika Roy, P.W.14 told to the SDPO that mother\n\nof Ranjita handed over Rs.1,00,000/- in two spells to the\n\nhusband of Ranjita and he also told to the SDPO that after\n\ngetting information of illness of Ranjita her parents went to the\n\nhospital and found her dead. It has further been confirmed by\n\nthe SDPO in his cross examination that it is not mentioned in the\n\nstatement recorded under \nSection 161\n of CrPC, Smt. Sandhya\n\nDas, P.W.17 that she stated to the I.O that Ranjita was killed by\n\nher husband by tying a cord of sewing machine.\n\n P.W.22 has further confirmed that it is not mentioned\n\nin the 161 statement of \nCrPC\n of Smt. Aparna Rani Das, P.W.26\n\nthat she stated to the I.O that on the previous day of her death\n\ndeceased-Ranjita had told her that she was tortured by the\n\naccused-appellant on previous night.\n\n32) P.W.23, Sri Sumanta Das is the witness who\n\nconducted the videography of the post mortem examination of\n\nthe death body and he submitted the DVD disk. He identified his\n\nsignature in the seizure list.\n\n33) P.W.24, is the seizure witness of the DVD disk he\n\nalso identified his signature in the said seizure list.\n\n34) P.W.-25, Dr Monamita Das has stated that on\n\n15.03.2015 she was posted as medical officer at Manughat CHC.\n\nOn that day she conducted a post mortem examination of dead\n\nbody under Manu PS GD entry No.11 dated 15.03.2015. She\n\nfound that there was a brownish red colour grooved ligature\n\n Page 13 of 23\n\nmark having a maximum weight of 2 centimeter over the upper\n\npart of neck in the front side non-continues from right to left\n\nside. After the post mortem examination, she opined that the\n\ncause of death was due to asphyxia which was ante mortem\n\nhanging in nature. She prepared the report and put her signature\n\non the said report which is marked as Exbt-12 and Exbt-12/1.\n\nMore significantly, the post-mortem report(Exbt.12) does not\n\nindicate any other marks of wounds or injury so that it can be\n\nopined that the victim was subjected to torture which forced her\n\nto commit suicide. There was no sign of any old injury marks in\n\nthe body of the victim so as to enable this Court to come to a\n\nfinding that she was put to torture a couple of days before the\n\ndate of committing suicide.\n\n None of the prosecution witnesses, nonetheless to\n\nsay, even the related witnesses have supported the version of\n\nPW-1 to a particular incident that when she along with her\n\ndaughter, Ranjita returned back to the house of the appellant\n\nfrom the parental house, Ranjita was severely assaulted by the\n\nappellant since she had divulged the fact of his extra-matrial\n\nrelationship with a tribal lady.\n\n Thus, the evidence and relating elements of torture\n\nappeared to be vague and omnibus. The prosecution also has\n\nmiserably failed to establish the fact of the involvement of the\n\nappellant with Menaka. She was neither interrogated nor was\n\nshown as a prosecution witness.\n\n35) On consideration of the evidences and witnesses as\n\nstated above, the learned Trial Court came to the finding and\n\n Page 14 of 23\n\nrecorded the sentence of guilt to the accused-appellant under\n\nSection 498A\n and \n304B\n of IPC as stated above.\n\n36) Being aggrieved by the decision of the said judgment\n\nand conviction of sentence, the appellant has preferred this\n\nappeal before this Court.\n\n37) I have meticulously perused the evidence and\n\nmaterials on record which were considered by the learned Trial\n\nCourt.\n\n38) In Arunava Bhowmik vs. State of Assam reported\n\nin 2005(1) GLT 45, the Gauhati High Court while acquitting the\n\naccused-appellant in that case from the charge of 498A \nIPC\n held\n\nas under:-\n\n \"The second submission of the\n learned counsel for the petitioner is that an offence\n under \nSection 498(A)\n IPC does not cover a single\n incident of altercation or assault between the\n husband and wife.\n\n In this case, there is no allegation against\n the petitioner that he had demanded a colour T.V.\n or harassed the informant for that purpose. There is\n absolutely no evidence that beating or the alleged\n act in question was with the view to compel the\n informant to commit suicide. As a matter of fact,\n there is no evidence of PW 1 that the husband had\n assaulted her on any previous occasion. The witness\n has deposed about the single incident of assault by\n the husband and even if we accept the above\n evidence of PW 1, which is not supported by other\n witnesses, it does not amount to cruelty as defined\n under \nSection 489A\n IPC. We find that the trial court\n as will as the appellate court has failed to appreciate\n the evidence in its proper perspective.\n Both the Courts below also erred in holding that the\n single incident of alleged assault on 04-09-92\n amounts to an offence under \nSection 498A\n IPC.\n Accordingly, we allow this revision and set aside the\n order of conviction and sentence entered against\n the accused petitioner. The accused is acquitted and\n set a liberty forthwith. He need to surrender to the\n bail bonds.\"\n\n39) In \nManju Ram Kalita v. State of Assam\n,\n\nreported in 2010(2) GLT (SC) 27, where the Apex Court\n\n Page 15 of 23\n\nparticularly in paragraphs 21 and 22 had discussed about the\n\nmeaning of „cruelty‟. It is observed that petty quarrels cannot\n\nbe termed as „cruelty‟ to attract the provisions of \nsection\n\n498A\n IPC, causing mental torture to the extent that it\n\nbecomes unbearable may be termed as „cruelty‟ and\n\nultimately set aside the conviction of the appellant therein\n\nunder \nsection 498A\n of the IPC.\n \nThe learned counsel has\n\ndrawn my attention to the relevant paragraphs of \nManju\n\nRam Kalita\n (supra) which are as under:-\n\n \"In Girdhar Shankar Tawade vs. State of\n Maharashtra, AIR2002 SC2078, this Court held that\n „cruelty‟ has to be understood having a specific\n statutory meaning provided in \nSection 498A\n, IPC and\n there should be a case of continuous state of affairs of\n torture by one to another.\n\n \"Cruelty\" for the purpose of \nSection 498A\n, IPC is\n to be established in the context of \nSection 498A\n, IPC as\n it may be a different from other statutory provisions. It\n is to be determined/inferred by considering the conduct\n of the man, weighing the gravity or seriousness of his\n acts and to find out as to whether it is likely to drive\n the women to commit suicide etc. It is to be established\n that the women has been subjected to cruelty\n continuously/ persistently or at least in close proximity\n of time of lodging the complaint. Petty quarrels cannot\n be termed as „cruelty‟ to attract the provisions of\n \nsection 498A\n, IPC.\n\n Causing mental torture to the extent that it\n becomes unbearable may be termed as cruelty.\"\n\n40) I may gainfully refer the decision passed by a\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in Durjoy Debnath alias Dulal\n\nand anr. vs. State of Tripura reported in (2017) 1 TLR\n\n208, this Court while dealing with similar issue has observed\n\nthus in paragraph 18:-\n\n \n\" Before discussing their evidence, we are\n inclined to quote here the observation of the Apex Court\n made in para 48 of the sensational case of \nSharad\n Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra\n, 91984)\n 4SCC 116 which reads as follows:\n\n Page 16 of 23\n\n Before discussing the evidence of the witnesses\n we might mention a few preliminary remarks against the\n background of which the oral statements are to be\n considered. All persons to whom the oral statements are\n said to have been made by Manu when she visited Beed\n for the last time, are close relatives and friends of the\n deceased. In view of the close relationship and affection\n any person in the position of the witness would\n naturally have a tendency to exaggerate or add facts\n which may not have been stated to them at all. Not that\n this is done consciously but even unconsciously the love\n and affection for the deceased would create a\n psychological hatred against the supposed murdered\n and, therefore, the court has to examine such evidence\n with very great care and caution. Even if the witnesses\n were speaking a part of the truth or perhaps the whole\n of it, they would be guided by a spirit of revenge or\n nemesis against the accused person and in this process\n certain facts which may not or could not have been\n stated may be imagined to have been stated\n unconsciously by the witnesses in order to see that the\n offender is punished. This is human psychology and no\n one can help it.\"\n\n41) I have given my anxious thought to the\n\nevidence laid by the witnesses in the instant case\n\nparticularly the evidence of the related witnesses that is the\n\nparents of the deceased-Ranjita as well as her brother and\n\nsister. The complainant has stated that her daughter was\n\nsubjected to physical and mental torture off and on. She has\n\nfurther stated that the appellant had demanded\n\nRs.1,00,000/- for the purpose of his business which she also\n\npaid to the appellant. She has also stated that the appellant\n\nused to maintain extra-martial relationship with a tribal\n\nlady. The evidence of father, brother as well as the sisters\n\nwere the representation of the statement of P.W.1, which\n\nthey have been told by the complainant herein. None of the\n\nrelated witnesses have been able to make any\n\nstatement stating specifically the date and time of torture\n\ninflicted upon the deceased. It is not the case, that they\n\n Page 17 of 23\n\nhave ever lodged any complaint to any authority under the\n\nlaw.\n\n42) Mr. Das, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant has candidly submitted that there must be some\n\nnexus between the torture and the demand of dowry to\n\nattract the provisions of \nSection 498A\n of IPC.\n\n43) \nUnder the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n, the word\n\n\"dowry\" defines in the manner as under:-\n\n \"Definition of 'dowry'.- In that Act, „dowry‟ means\n any property or valuable security given or agreed to be\n given either directly or indirectly-\n\n a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the\n marriage; or\n\n b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by\n any other person, to either party to the marriage or to\n any other person,\n at or before or any time after marriage in connection\n with the marriage of the said parties but does not\n include dower or mahr in the case of person to whom\n the Muslim Personal Law (shariat) applies.\"\n\n44) In \nBachni Devi vs. State of Haryana\n, (2011)\n\n4 SCC 427, the Apex Court, while interpreting the definition\n\nof „dowry‟ given in \nSection 2\n of the Act, has held that the\n\nterm is defined comprehensively to include properties of all\n\nsorts as it takes within its fold \"any property or valuable\n\nsecurity\" given or agreed to be given in connection with\n\nmarriage either directly or indirectly. Thus, the demand of\n\ndowry must have some connection with the marriage and\n\nthe prosecution has to prove that the non-fulfillment of\n\ndemand of dowry leads the accused to cause torture, either\n\nphysically or mentally to drive the woman to commit suicide\n\nor to cause grave injury or danger to life to his wife.\n\n45) Thus, I find force in the submission of the\n\nlearned counsel. Section 498A is related to the demand of\n\n Page 18 of 23\n\n\"dowry\" which is prohibited under the \nDowry Prohibition Act\n\n1961. Even if the statements of the related witnesses are\n\ntaken into account, then, it is surfaced that they have\n\ncategorically stated that the demand had been made by the\n\nappellant to invest the said amount in the business purpose.\n\nThe demand related to „business‟ and demand related to\n\n„dowry‟ is quite distinct. In other words, the demand relating\n\nto the purpose of business cannot not be said to be a\n\ndemand of dowry.\n\n46) It is further revealed from the cross examination\n\nof the SDPO, PW.22 that the relative witnesses and other\n\nneighbour witnesses of the complainant had exaggerated\n\nand improvised the stories of torture and demand of dowry\n\nin course of trial during their recording of evidence which\n\nthey have not stated in their 161 \nCrPC\n statement.\n\n47) Keeping in view the principles \nlaid down in\n\nArunava Bhowmik(supra), \nManju Ram Kalita\n(supra)\n\nand Durjoy Debnath alias Dulal(supra) it appears to be\n\nvery difficult for this Court to arrive at a specific conclusion\n\nthat the deceased-Ranjita Das was subjected to torture\n\nphysically and mentally for demand of dowry by the\n\nappellant and hence, according to me, the ingredients of\n\nSection 498A has not been fulfilled in the facts of the\n\npresent case due to which the conviction under Section\n\n498A cannot be sustained.\n\n48) Now, the question remains whether the\n\nconviction and sentence passed under \nSection 304B\n of IPC\n\n Page 19 of 23\n\nis sustainable in the facts of the present case as declared by\n\nthe learned Trial Court.\n\n49) \nSection 304B\n of IPC reads as under:-\n\n \" 304B. Dowry Death.- (1) Where the death\n of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury\n or occurs otherwise then under normal circumstances\n within seven years of her marriage and it is shown\n that soon before her death she was subjected to\n cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative\n of her husband for, or in connection with , any\n demand for dowry, such death shall be called \"dowry\n death\" and such husband or relatives shall be\n deemed to have caused her death.\n\n [ Explanation- For the purpose of this sub-section,\n \"dowry\" shall have the same meaning as in \nsection 2\n\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961)\n\n 2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be\n punished with imprisonment for a term which shall\n not be less than seven years but which may extend\n to imprisonment for life.\"\n\n50) In order to convict an accused for the offence\n\npunishable under \nsection 304B\n IPC, the following essentials must\n\nbe satisfied:\n\n i) the death of a woman must have been caused\n by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under\n normal circumstances;\n\n ii) such death must have been occurred within\n seven years of her marriage;\n\n iii) soon before her death, the women must have\n been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her\n husband or any relatives of her husband;\n\n iv) such cruelty or harassment must be for, or in\n connection with, demand for dowry.\n\n51) When the above ingredients are established by reliable\n\nand acceptable evidence, such death shall be called dowry death\n\nand such husband or his relatives shall be deemed to have been\n\ncaused her death. If the above mentioned ingredients are\n\nattracted, in view of the special provision under \nSection 113B\n of\n\nthe Evidence Act, 1872, the court shall presume and it shall record\n\nsuch fact as proved unless and until it is disproved by the accused.\n\n Page 20 of 23\n\nHowever, it is open to the accused to adduce such evidence for\n\ndisproving such compulsory presumption as the burden is\n\nunmistakably on him to do so and he can discharge such burden by\n\ngetting an answer through cross examination of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses or by adducing evidence on the defence side.\n\n To attract the provisions of \nSection 304(B)\n IPC, one of\n\nthe main ingredients of the offence which is required to be\n\nestablished is that \"soon before her death\" she was subjected to\n\ncruelty or harassment.\n\n52) Presumption of commission of offence under Section\n\n304(B) is directly related to \nSection 113-B\n of the Evidence Act. A\n\nconjoint reading of both the provisions of law emerges that where\n\nthe wife met with an unnatural death within seven years of\n\nmarriage and had been subjected to cruelty or harassment for/or in\n\nconnection with demand for dowry the court shall presume that\n\nsuch person has caused the dowry death. Besides, to prove the\n\ndeath within seven years of marriage, the prosecution has to\n\nestablish that the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment\n\nsoon before her death and such cruelty or harassment was for\n\ndowry. The expression \"soon before her death\" has not been\n\ndefined in either of the statute, therefore, in each case the Court\n\nhas to analyze the facts and circumstances leading to the death of\n\nthe victim and decide whether there is any proximate connection\n\nbetween the demand for dowry, the act of cruelty or harassment\n\nand the death.\n\n53) \"Soon before\" is a relative term which is required to be\n\nconsidered under specific circumstance of each case and no strait\n\njacket formula can be laid down by fixing any time limit. The term\n\n Page 21 of 23\n\nis not synonymous with the term \"immediately before\" and is\n\nopposite of the expression \"soon after\". This word would imply that\n\nthe interval should not be too long between the time of making the\n\nstatement and the death. Approximate and live link between the\n\neffect of cruelty based on dowry demand and the consequential\n\ndeath is required to be proved by the prosecution. (Reliance is\n\nplaced on Kans raj Vs. State, 2000 (5) SCC 207(para-15).\n\n54) Mere lapse of some time by itself would not provide to\n\nan accused defence, if the course of conduct relating to cruelty or\n\nharassment in connection with the dowry demand is shown to have\n\nexisted earlier in time neither too late nor too stale before the date\n\nof death of the wife. The phrase \"soon before her death\" is an\n\nelastic expression and can refer to a period immediately before her\n\ndeath or within a few days or even a few weeks before it. But the\n\nlegislative intent in providing such a radius of time is to emphasize\n\nthe idea that her death should in all probabilities have been the\n\naftermath of such cruelty or harassment. In other words, there\n\nshould be a perceptible nexus between her death and dowry\n\nrelated harassment or cruelty inflicted on her. It is for the Court to\n\ndecide on the facts and circumstances of each case whether the\n\ninterval would be \"soon before her death\" (reliance is placed on\n\nSatvir Vs. the State\n, reported in 2001 (8) SCC 633).\n\n55) On perusal of the deposition of P.W.1, the mother of\n\nthe victim, it appears that she nowhere has stated the date and\n\ntime or even the period when the appellant had demanded Rs.\n\n50,000/- from the victim. Even if, for argument sake, if the Court\n\nbelieves the statement of the P.W.1 to be true, then also this Court\n\ndoes not find any relation that the demand was made as a matter\n\n Page 22 of 23\n\nof dowry. More specifically to be stated, the demand, if any, was\n\nmade for the purpose of business. Thus, it becomes very difficult\n\nfor this Court to attract the ingredients of \nSection 304B\n IPC as this\n\nCourt has not been able to connect the said demand of Rs.\n\n1,00,000/- to the fact of dowry which is prohibited by law. In\n\nfurtherance thereof, there is no evidence that the victim was\n\nsubjected to torture soon before her death on 15.03.2015. More so\n\nto say prosecution has failed to produce any neighbouring witness\n\nof the appellant to substantiate that Ranjita, the deceased wife was\n\never subjected to torture either by the appellant or any other in-\n\nlaws.\n\n56) In this nature of case, sometimes, conduct of the\n\naccused as well as other in-laws also is required to be noticed. In\n\nthe instant case, the in-laws had rushed to the police station, all of\n\nthem accompanied the victim to the hospital, the father-in-law\n\ninformed the parents of the deceased over telephone and took\n\nthem to the hospital by an auto-rickshaw.\n\n57) On meticulous analysis of the evidence and material on\n\nrecord, it would be very difficult to say that the prosecution has\n\nbeen able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n58) Hence, this Court is inclined to set aside the order of\n\nconviction and sentence passed against the appellant under \nSection\n\n304B\n of IPC as declared by the learned Trial Court. Accordingly, the\n\njudgment and order dated 19.05.2018, whereby the appellant was\n\nconvicted and sentenced under Section 498A and 304B is set aside\n\nand quashed.\n\n Page 23 of 23\n\n59) I have been informed that the appellant at present is in\n\njail. So, he shall be released forthwith if not wanted in connection\n\nwith any other cases. The surety is discharged accordingly.\n\n60) In the result, the appeal is allowed. Send back the\n\nLCRs.\n\n JUDGE\n\n suhanjit",

The witness\n has deposed about the single incident of assault by\n the husband and even if we accept the above\n evidence of PW 1, which is not supported by other\n witnesses, it does not amount to cruelty as defined\n under \nSection 489A\n IPC. We find that the trial court\n as will as the appellate court has failed to appreciate\n the evidence in its proper perspective.\n Both the Courts below also erred in holding that the\n single incident of alleged assault on 04-09-92\n amounts to an offence under \nSection 498A\n IPC.\n Accordingly, we allow this revision and set aside the\n order of conviction and sentence entered against\n the accused petitioner. The accused is acquitted and\n set a liberty forthwith. He need to surrender to the\n bail bonds.\""

Not that\n this is done consciously but even unconsciously the love\n and affection for the deceased would create a\n psychological hatred against the supposed murdered\n and, therefore, the court has to examine such evidence\n with very great care and caution. Even if the witnesses\n were speaking a part of the truth or perhaps the whole\n of it, they would be guided by a spirit of revenge or\n nemesis against the accused person and in this process\n certain facts which may not or could not have been\n stated may be imagined to have been stated\n unconsciously by the witnesses in order to see that the\n offender is punished.
