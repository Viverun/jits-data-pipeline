On the basis of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the Detaining\nAuthority (Respondent no. 2) observed and recorded as under:\n\n\"2. After going through the facts and circumstances in all above-\nmentioned cases, it is clearly established that you i.e. Pabbar Giri @\nVijay are actively involved in trafficking of Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances and you are a habitual offender. Your\npresence in the society is a threat to innocent person of the\nlocality/State/Nation and your activities are prejudicial to society.\n\n3. I am aware that at present you i.e. Pabbar Giri @ Vijay are in\njudicial custody since 12.02.2023 in Case FIR No. 157/23. However,\nconsidering your conscious involvement in illegal trafficking of\ndrugs and psychotropic substances in a repeated manner to the\ndetriment of the society, you have a high propensity to be involved\nin the prejudicial activities in future on being released on bail.\n\n4. In view of the facts mentioned above, I have no hesitation in\narriving at the conclusion that you i.e. Pabbar Giri @ Vijay through\nyour above acts engaged yourself in prejudicial activities of illicit\ntraffic of narcotics and psychotropic substances, which poses serious\nthreat to the health and welfare not only to the citizens of this country\nbut to every citizen in the world, besides deleterious effect on the\nnational economy. The offences committed by you i.e. Pabbar Giri @\nVijay are so interlinked and continuous in character and are of such\nnature that these affect security and health of the nation. The grievous\nnature and gravity of offences committed by you i.e. Pabbar Giri @\nVijay in a well-planned manner clearly establishes your continued\npropensity and inclination to engage in such acts of prejudicial\nactivities. Considering the facts of the present case mentioned in\nforegoing paras, I have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that\nthere is ample opportunity for Pabbar Giri @ Vijay i.e. you to repeat\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 7 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nthe above serious prejudicial acts. Hence, I am satisfied that in the\nmeantime you i.e. Pabbar Giri @ Vijay should be immobilized and\nthere is a need to prevent you i.e. Pabbar Giri @ Vijay from\nengaging in such illicit traffic of narcotic drug and psychotropic\nsubstances in future by detention under\nsection 3(1)\nof Prevention\nof Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\n(PITNDPS) Act, 1988.\n\n5. In view of the overwhelming evidences discussed in foregoing\nparas, detailing how you i.e. Pabbar Giri@ Vijay have indulged in\norganizing the illicit trafficking of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nsubstances as well as have a high propensity to engage in this illicit\nactivity, it is conclusively felt that if you are not detained under\nsection\n3(1)\nof the PITNDPS Act, 1988, you i.e. Pabbar Giri @ Vijay would\ncontinue to so engage yourself in possessing, purchase, sale,\ntransportation, storage, use of narcotics and psychotropic substances\nillegally and handling the above activities, organizing directly in the\nabove activities and conspiring in furtherance of above activities\nwhich amount to illicit trafficking of psychotropic substances under\n\nsection 2(e)\nof the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances (PITNDPS) Act, 1988 in future also. I am,\ntherefore, satisfied that there is full justification to detain you i.e.\nPabbar Giri @Vijay under\nsection 3(1)\nof the Prevention of Illicit\nTraffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988\nwith a view to preventing you i.e. Pabbar Giri@ Vijay from engaging\nin above illicit traffic of narcotics and psychotropic substances\nspecified under schedule to the\nNDPS Act, 1985\n.\n\n6. Considering the magnitude of the operation, the chronicle sequence\nof events, the well-organized manner in which such prejudicial\nactivities have been carried on, the nature and gravity of the offence,\nthe consequential extent of investigation involved including\nscanning/examination of papers, formation of grounds, I am satisfied\nthat the nexus between the dates of incident and passing of the\nDetention Order as well as object of your detention has been well\nmaintained.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 8 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\n\n5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner challenges the aforesaid detention\norder on the following grounds:\n\nA) Non-placing of vital documents before the Detaining Authority\nLearned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner submits that with\nrespect to FIR no. 157/2023, the Petitioner was forcibly picked up by the\nofficers of Delhi police at around 11:30 p.m. on 11th February, 2023 from\nNajafgarh Goushala Road, Krishna Mandir, Nangloi, Delhi and was kept\nin police custody. Further, from there, he alongwith with the co-accused\nPappu Rai was taken near Park Hospital, Keshav Pur Mandi, where both of\nthem were kept in a vehicle. That at around 3:00 p.m., the officers took the\nco-accused Pappu Rai to the aforesaid spot near Park hospital and in the\nmeantime, the other co-accused Geegal Kumar was called over phone to\ncome to the said spot and the Petitioner alongwith the accused person(s)\nwere taken to the concerned Police Station. Therefore, the Petitioner\ncontends that the aforementioned case was planted on him and that he\npossesses a CD containing the CCTV footage to that effect, i.e., of 11th\nFebruary, 2023, which formed a part of judicial record before the Learned\nTrial Court. The same CCTV footage was never placed before the\nDetaining Authority (Respondent no. 2) by the Sponsoring Authority even\nthough the Petitioner drew attention to the said CCTV material through his\nrepresentations.\n\nB) Delay in passing and execution of the Detention Order\nLearned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that in FIR no. 157/2023, the\nPetitioner was arrested on 12th February, 2023 and that the proposal was sent\nby the Sponsoring Authority to the Detaining Authority (Respondent no. 2)\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 9 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\non 8th of December, 2023 with an approximate delay of 10 months, which was\nfurther forwarded to the Screening Committee after approximately one month\nand 20 days, i.e., on 29th January, 2024. It was further submitted that there\nwas no record as to when the Screening Committee accepted the said proposal\nand the impugned detention order was then passed after approximately a\nmonth, i.e., on 21st February, 2024. It is further contended that the said\ndetention order was only executed to the Petitioner after a period of 7 days\nfrom passing of it, i.e., on 27th February, 2024.\nC) Non-application of mind with respect to rigours of\nSection 37\nof the\nNDPS Act\nLearned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Petitioner was arrested for\npossession of commercial quantity and therefore, the rigours of\nSection 37\nof\nthe NDPS Act would come into play, which prohibits any Court from granting\nbail to an accused possessing commercial quantity of narcotic drugs or\npsychotropic substances unless the twin conditions are satisfied.\nSection 37\n\nof the NDPS Act reads as under:\n\n\"37. Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable.--(1)\nNotwithstanding anything contained in the\nCode of Criminal\nProcedure\n, 1973 (2 of 1974),--\n\n(a) every offence punishable under this Act shall be cognizable;\n\n(b) no person accused of an offence punishable for offences under\n\nsection 19\nor\nsection 24\nor\nsection 27A\nand also for offences\ninvolving commercial quantity shall be released on bail or on his\nown bond unless--\n\n(i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to\noppose the application for such release, and\n\n(ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the\ncourt is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for\nbelieving that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not\nlikely to commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause (b) of sub-\n\nsection (1) are in addition to the limitations under the Code of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 10 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or any other law for the time\nbeing in force on granting of bail.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIn the present facts of the matter, the Detaining Authority was already\naware of the Petitioner being in judicial custody and yet the order of detention\nwas passed, as in the grounds of detention served to the Petitioner, in\nparagraph no. 3, the Detaining Authority mentions \"I am aware that at\npresent you i.e., Pabbar Giri@ Vijay are in judicial custody since 12.02.2023\nin case FIR No. 157/23. However, considering your conscious involvement in\nillegal trafficking of drugs and psychotropic substances in a repeated manner\nto the detriment of the society, you have a high propensity to be involved in\nthe prejudicial activities in future on being released on bail.\" However, the\nDetaining Authority was already aware of the rejection of the bail application\nof the Petitioner in FIR No. 157/2023 vide order dated 23rd September, 2023\nby the Learned Special Judge (NDPS), West, Delhi and the fact that the\nPetitioner did not challenge the same. Thus, there was no compelling\nnecessity to pass the detention order after approximately 5 months of rejection\nof the bail application.\n\nD) No live or proximate link\nLearned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that with respect to FIR No.\n157/2023, the Petitioner was arrested on 12th February, 2023; however, the\nDetaining Authority only passed the Detention order after an unexplained\ndelay of approximately one year on 21st February, 2024. Therefore, it is\ncontended that the delay in passing of the impugned detention order has\nsnapped the nexus/live-link between the alleged prejudicial activities of the\nPetitioner and the purpose of \"immobilising\" him or detaining him.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 11 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\n6. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner relies on the\nfollowing judgments:\n\ni.\nSushanta Kumar Banik vs. State of Tripura and Others\nSCC OnLine SC 1333\nii.\nShahid Khan @ Chote Pradhan vs. Union of India and Another\n\n2024:DHC:3012-DB\niii.\n\nSumita @ Manto vs. Union of India\n2003 SCC OnLine Del 294\niv.

Learned Central Government Standing Counsel appearing on behalf\nof Respondent nos. 1 and 2 argued on the lines of the counter-affidavit filed\non their behalf. It was argued that in view of the prejudicial activities of the\npresent Petitioner and his continuous involvement in the\nNDPS Act\n, the\nSponsoring Authority felt the need to prevent him from any other activities\nand therefore, a proposal for his detention was moved on 8 th December,\n2023 and the same was placed before the Screening Committee on 29 th\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 12 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nJanuary, 2024.\n\n8. It is submitted on behalf of the Learned Counsel for the Respondent\nnos. 1 and 2 that the objective of\nPITNDPS Act\nwas to prevent persons of\nsuch propensity to continue with their prejudicial activities despite the fact\nthat there are stringent conditions in the\nNDPS Act\nitself for bail as well as\nquantum of punishments. It was further submitted that there was no delay\nin passing of the detention order inasmuch as the prejudicial activities of\nthe Petitioner as highlighted in the grounds of detention clearly shows his\npropensity to commit such offences in future and therefore in view of aims\nand objectives of the\nPITNDPS Act\n, it was necessary for him to be\nimmobilised. Attention of this Court was drawn to the aims and objectives\nof the\nPITNDPS Act\n, which reads as under:\n\n\"\nAn Act\nto provide for detention in certain cases for the purpose of\npreventing illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances and for matters connected therewith\nWhereas illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances poses a serious threat to the health and welfare of the\npeople and the activities of persons engaged in such illicit traffic have\na deleterious effect on the national economy;\n\nAnd whereas having regard to the persons by whom and the\nmanner in which such activities are organised and carried on, and\nhaving regard to the fact that in certain areas which are highly\nvulnerable to the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances, such activities of a considerable magnitude are\nclandestinely organised and carried on, it is necessary for the\neffective prevention of such activities to provide for detention of\npersons concerned in any manner therewith.\"\n\n9. It is further submitted that the contention of the Petitioner that the\nCCTV footage was not placed before the Detaining Authority is unfounded\ninasmuch as the same is not part of the judicial record. Attention of this\nCourt was drawn to an order dated 3rd March, 2023 passed by the Learned\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 13 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nTrial Court in FIR No. 157/2023 wherein, while disposing of the\napplication under\nSection 91\nof the Cr.P.C. moved by the Petitioner, it was\nobserved as under:\n\n\"Fresh reply regarding the verification of the CTV footage\ncontaining in the CD placed on record on behalf of applicant/\naccused and regarding the preserving of CDR are filed.\nHeard.

Therefore, not placing the same would\nnot have any bearing on the detention order.\n\n10. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent nos. 1 and 2\nsought to distinguish the judgments passed by this Court in Riyazuddin\n(supra) and Amardeep Singh Narang (supra) to submit that the\ndocuments discussed in those judgments were of material in nature and\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 14 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\ntherefore non-consideration of the same by the Detaining Authority was\ntreated to be fatal to the detention order made therein. It is submitted that\nin the present case, the CCTV footage relied upon by the Petitioner is not a\npart of the Trial Court and therefore the said judgments would not be\napplicable in the present case.\nSimilarly, in\nSushanta Kumar Banik\n\n(supra), it is pointed out that delay in passing the detention order was after\nthe grant of bail to the Appellant therein and therefore the said case would\nbe distinct from the present one as the Petitioner had not been granted bail\nin the present case.\n\nANALYSIS AND FINDINGS\n\n11. Heard Learned Counsels for the parties and perused the record.\n\n12. The following dates are relevant for deciding the present petition:\n\na) The Petitioner was arrested in case FIR No. 157/2023 registered at\nP.S. Ranhola on 12th February, 2023.\n\nb) The Petitioner filed a bail application which was dismissed vide\norder dated 23rd September, 2023 by the Learned Special Judge\n(NDPS), West Delhi.\n\nc) The proposal for detention was forwarded by the Sponsoring\nAuthority to the Detaining Authority on 8th December, 2023. It is\npertinent to note that on the said date, there was no application\npending on behalf of the Petitioner seeking bail in the aforesaid FIR.\n\nOn a specific query made by this Court during the course of the\nhearing, the Investigating Officer informed that the other two co-\naccused persons were also in judicial custody and had not been\ngranted bail.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 15 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nd) The detention order was passed on 21st February, 2024.\n\n13. This Court is of the considered opinion that there was considerable\nand unreasonable delay from the date of the arrest of the Petitioner and that\nof sending the proposal for detention. It is also a matter of record, as pointed\nout hereinabove, that the bail application of the Petitioner was dismissed\non 23rd September, 2023 and on the date when the proposal was moved,\ni.e., on 8th December, 2023; no application seeking bail was pending. On\nthe examination of the proposal (annexed with the Status Report filed on\nbehalf of Respondent no. 3), it is observed that the Sponsoring Authority\nhas not given any explanation with regard to the reason for moving the\nproposal in the circumstances where the bail of the Petitioner had already\nbeen dismissed and no application was pending. There is no explanation by\nthe Sponsoring Authority as to reasonable grounds to believe that the\nPetitioner being already in judicial custody and immobilised, would be\nlikely to be released on bail and commit prejudicial activities as alleged in\nthe grounds of detention.\n\n14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nN. Meera Rani vs. State of Tamil\nNadu and Another\n(1989) 4 SCC 418, after reviewing various decisions\non the subject, held as under:\n\n\"11. The contents of the detention order and its accompanying\nannexure clearly show that the detaining authority was aware and\nconscious of the fact that the detenu was already in custody in\nconnection with the Bank dacoity at the time of making the detention\norder. The fact that the detenu's application for grant of bail in the\ndacoity case had been rejected on 22-8-1988 and he was remanded to\ncustody for the offence of bank dacoity punishable under\nSection 397\n\nIPC is also evident from the record. The detention order came to be\nmade on 7-9-1988 on the above grounds in these circumstances. In\nthe detention order the detaining authority recorded its satisfaction\nthat the detenu's preventive detention was necessary to prevent him\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 16 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nfrom indulging in activities prejudicial to maintenance of public order\nin which he would indulge if he was allowed to remain at large. The\nabove quoted paras 18 and 19 of the Annexure to the detention order\nclearly disclose the factual position. However, it may be pointed out\nthat the detention order read along with its annexure nowhere\nindicates that the detaining authority apprehended the likelihood of\nthe detenu being released on bail in the dacoity case and, therefore,\nconsidered the detention order necessary. On the contrary, its\ncontents, particularly those of the above quoted para 18 clearly\nmention that the detenu had been remanded to custody for being\nproceeded against in due course and even though his name was not\nmentioned in the FIR as one of the dacoits who participated in the\ncommission of the armed Bank dacoity yet the documents clearly\nrevealed that the detenu was an active participant in the conspiracy\nto loot the bank in furtherance of which the dacoity was committed;\nand that considerable booty of that crime including weapons, bombs\nand hand grenades were recovered from his possession pursuant to\nthe detenu's confession made after his arrest. These averments in the\ndetention order indicate the satisfaction of the detaining authority\nthat in its view there was ample material to prove the detenu's active\nparticipation in the crime and sharing the booty for which offence\nhe had already been taken into custody. This view of the detaining\nauthority negatives the impression of likelihood of detenu being\nreleased on bail.\n\n*** *** ***\n\n21. A review of the above decisions reaffirms the position which was\nsettled by the decision of a Constitution Bench in Rameshwar Shaw\ncase [AIR 1964 SC 334 : (1964) 4 SCR 921 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ 257] .\nThe conclusion about validity of the detention order in each case was\nreached on the facts of the particular case and the observations made\nin each of them have to be read in the context in which they were\nmade. None of the observations made in any subsequent case can be\nconstrued at variance with the principle indicated in Rameshwar\nShaw case [AIR 1964 SC 334 : (1964) 4 SCR 921 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ\n257] for the obvious reason that all subsequent decisions were by\nBenches comprising of lesser number of Judges. We have dealt with\nthis matter at some length because an attempt has been made for some\ntime to construe some of the recent decisions as modifying the\nprinciple enunciated by the Constitution Bench in Rameshwar Shaw\ncase [AIR 1964 SC 334 : (1964) 4 SCR 921 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ 257] .\n\n22. We may summarise and reiterate the settled principle. Subsisting\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 17 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\ncustody of the detenu by itself does not invalidate an order of his\npreventive detention and the decision must depend on the facts of\nthe particular case; preventive detention being necessary to prevent\nthe detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of\nthe State or to the maintenance of public order etc. ordinarily it is\nnot needed when the detenu is already in custody; the detaining\nauthority must show its awareness to the fact of subsisting custody\nof the detenu and take that factor into account while making the\norder; but, even so, if the detaining authority is reasonably satisfied\non cogent material that there is likelihood of his release and in view\nof his antecedent activities which are proximate in point of time he\nmust be detained in order to prevent him from indulging in such\nprejudicial activities, the detention order can be validly made even\nin anticipation to operate on his release. This appears to us, to be the\ncorrect legal position.\n\n23. Applying the above settled principle to the facts of the present case\nwe have no doubt that the detention order, in the present case, must\nbe quashed for this reason alone. The detention order read with its\nannexure indicates the detaining authority's awareness of the fact\nof detenu's jail custody at the time of the making of the detention\norder. However, there is no indication therein that the detaining\nauthority considered it likely that the detenu could be released on\nbail. In fact, the contents of the order, particularly, the above quoted\npara 18 show the satisfaction of the detaining authority that there\nwas ample material to prove the detenu's complicity in the Bank\ndacoity including sharing of the booty in spite of absence of his\nname in the FIR as one of the dacoits. On these facts, the order of\ndetention passed in the present case on 7-9-1988 and its\nconfirmation by the State Government on 25-10-1988 is clearly\ninvalid since the same was made when the detenu was already in jail\ncustody for the offence of bank dacoity with no prospect of his\nrelease. It does not satisfy the test indicated by the Constitution\nBench in Rameshwar Shaw case [AIR 1964 SC 334 : (1964) 4 SCR\n921 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ 257] . We hold the detention order to be invalid\nfor this reason alone and express no opinion on merits about the\ngrounds of detention.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n15. At this stage, it will be apposite to refer to a judgement of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in\nRajinder Arora vs. Union of India and Others\n(2006) 4\nSCC 796. In the said case, the petitioner therein was arrested on 28th May,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 18 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\n2004 and order of detention was issued on 31 st March, 2005. The Hon'ble\nSupreme Court while taking note of the same, observed and held as under:\n\n\"20. Furthermore no explanation whatsoever has been offered by the\nrespondent as to why the order of detention has been issued after such\na long time. The said question has also not been examined by the\nAuthorities before issuing the order of detention.\n\n21. The question as regards delay in issuing the order of detention has\nbeen held to be a valid ground for quashing an order of detention by\nthis Court in\nT.A. Abdul Rahman v. State of Kerala\n[(1989) 4 SCC\n741 : 1990 SCC (Cri) 76 : AIR 1990 SC 225] stating: (SCC pp. 748-\n49, paras 10-11)\n\"10. The conspectus of the above decisions can be\nsummarised thus: The question whether the prejudicial\nactivities of a person necessitating to pass an order of\ndetention is proximate to the time when the order is\nmade or the live-link between the prejudicial activities\nand the purpose of detention is snapped depends on the\nfacts and circumstances of each case. No hard-and-fast\nrule can be precisely formulated that would be\napplicable under all circumstances and no exhaustive\nguidelines can be\nlaid down in\nthat behalf. It follows\nthat the test of proximity is not a rigid or mechanical\ntest by merely counting number of months between the\noffending acts and the order of detention. However,\nwhen there is undue and long delay between the\nprejudicial activities and the passing of detention order,\nthe court has to scrutinise whether the detaining\nauthority has satisfactorily examined such a delay and\nafforded a tenable and reasonable explanation as to\nwhy such a delay has occasioned, when called upon to\nanswer and further the court has to investigate whether\nthe causal connection has been broken in the\ncircumstances of each case.\n\n11. Similarly when there is unsatisfactory and\nunexplained delay between the date of order of\ndetention and the date of securing the arrest of the\ndetenu, such a delay would throw considerable doubt\non the genuineness of the subjective satisfaction of the\ndetaining authority leading to a legitimate inference\nthat the detaining authority was not really and\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 19 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\ngenuinely satisfied as regards the necessity for\ndetaining the detenu with a view to preventing him from\nacting in a prejudicial manner.\"\n\n22. The delay caused in this case in issuing the order of detention has\nnot been explained. In fact, no reason in that behalf whatsoever has\nbeen assigned at all.\"\n\n16. Learned Division Bench of this Court in\nGurminder Singh @ Lalli\nvs. Union of India and Others\n1999 SCC OnLine Del 85 in a similar\nsituation held as under:\n\n\"6. From the above it is apparent that the detaining authority was\nconscious of the fact that the petitioner was in custody, but it failed\nto point out any material on the basis of which it was led to believe\nthat there was a likelihood of the bail being granted to the petitioner.\nThe inference of the detaining authority does not seem to be grounded\non any cogent material. It is important to note that the petitioner is\nalleged to have committed offences under\nSections 21\nand\nof the\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. It is also clear\nfrom the reading of the grounds of detention that the D.R.I. claims\nto have seized 4.800 kgs. of heroine from the car which was driven\nby the petitioner. Ordinarily, when such a huge quantity of heroine\nis alleged to have been recovered from the custody of a person, there\nis hardly any possibility of his being released on bail in view of the\nprovisions of\nSection 37\nof the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances Act.\n\n7.\nIn\nKamarunnissa v. Union of India and another\n, (1991) 1 S.C.C.\n128, the Supreme Court on review of a large number of decisions laid\ndown that even in the case of a person in custody a detention order\ncan be passed provided the following conditions are satisfied :-\n\n(1) the authority passing the order is aware of the fact that he\nis actually in custody;\n\n(2) the detaining authority has reason to believe on the basis\nof reliable material placed before it that there is a real\npossibility of his being released on bail, and that on being so\nreleased he would in all probability indulge in prejudicial\nactivity; and\n(3) it is essential to detain him to prevent him from indulging\nin prejudicial activities.\n\nTo the same effect are the decisions of the Supreme Court in\nSuraj Pal\nSahu v. State of Maharashtra and others\n, (1986) 4 S.C.C. 378;\nSmt.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 20 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nShashi Aggarwal v. State of U.P. and Others\n, (1988) 1 S.C.C. 436;\nN.\nMeera Rani v. Government of Tamil Nadu and Another\n, (1989) 4\nS.C.C. 418; and\nAnand Prakash v. State of U.P. and Others\n, (1990) 1\nS.C.C. 291.\n\n8. Thus, even in a case where a person is in custody, if the facts and\ncircumstances of the case so demand, detention order can be passed\nfor his detention under the law of preventive detention provided there\nis relevant and creditable material to indicate that he is likely to be\nreleased on bail and is likely to repeat his criminal activities.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n17. It is the case of the Sponsoring Authority itself that the present\nPetitioner is a previous convict under the\nNDPS Act\nand keeping in mind\nthe rigours of\nSection 37\nof the NDPS Act, it was incumbent upon the\nSponsoring Authority as well as the Detaining Authority to apply its mind\non this aspect. The order of detention simply records the fact that the\nPetitioner is in judicial custody and is likely to indulge in prejudicial\nactivities if released on bail; however, there is no satisfaction shown in the\norder of detention as to the likelihood of the Petitioner being released on\nbail in these circumstances. In fact, other co-accused persons had not been\ngranted bail and were in judicial custody.\n\n18. The submissions on behalf of Respondent nos. 1 and 2 with respect to\nthe object of the\nPITNDPS Act\n, is not in dispute. However, the detention order\nshould be in compliance with the procedural safeguards provided in law. The\nsubjective satisfaction of the Detaining Authority is open to judicial review\nby the Constitutional Court.\n\n19. The Courts would normally hesitate to substitute the \"subjective\nsatisfaction\" with its own opinion and interfere with the order of detention;\nhowever, such satisfaction should be after proper application of mind. In case,\nthe Court finds the same being passed on account of non-application of mind,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 21 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nthen the same can be set aside by this Court while exercising its power under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n20.\nIn\nAmeena Begum vs. State of Telangana and Others\n(2023) 9 SCC\n587, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while referring to various judgments with\nrespect to judicial reviewability of a detention order, observed and held as\nunder:\n\n\"15.\nIn\nRameshwar Shaw v. District Magistrate\n,\n\nBurdwan [Rameshwar Shaw v. District Magistrate, Burdwan\n, 1963\nSCC OnLine SC 33 : AIR 1964 SC 334] , a Constitution Bench\nspeaking through Hon'ble P.B. Gajendragadkar, J. (as the Chief\nJustice then was) in course of interdicting an order of detention\npassed under\nSection 3\nof the Detention Act held as follows : (AIR p.\n337, paras 7-8)\n\"7. There is also no doubt that if any of the grounds\nfurnished to the detenu are found to be irrelevant while\nconsidering the application of clauses (i) to (iii) of\n\nSection 3(1)(a)\nand in that sense are foreign to the Act,\nthe satisfaction of the detaining authority on which the\norder of detention is based is open to challenge and the\ndetention order liable to be quashed. Similarly, if some\nof the ground supplied to the detenu are so vague that\nthey would virtually deprive the detenu of his statutory\nright of making a representation, that again may\nintroduce a serious infirmity in the order of his\ndetention. If, however, the grounds on which the order\nof detention proceeds are relevant and germane to the\nmatters which fall to be considered under\nSection\n3(1)(a)\n, it would not be open to the detenu to challenge\nthe order of detention by arguing that the satisfaction of\nthe detaining authority is not reasonably based on any\nof the said grounds.\n\n8. It is, however, necessary to emphasise in this\nconnection that though the satisfaction of the\ndetaining authority contemplated by\nSection 3(1)(a)\nis\nthe subjective satisfaction of the said authority, cases\nmay arise where the detenu may challenge the validity\nof his detention on the ground of mala fides and in\nsupport of the said plea urge that along with other\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 22 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nfacts which show mala fides, the Court may also\nconsider his grievance that the grounds served on him\ncannot possibly or rationally support the conclusion\ndrawn against him by the detaining authority. It is\nonly in this incidental manner and in support of the\nplea of mala fides that this question can become\njusticiable; otherwise the reasonableness or propriety\nof the said satisfaction contemplated by\nSection 3(1)(a)\n\ncannot be questioned before the Courts.\"\n\n*** *** ***\n\n17. In Icchu Devi Choraria v. Union of India [Icchu Devi\nChoraria v. Union of India, (1980) 4 SCC 531 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 25] ,\nthe judicial commitment to strike down illegal detention, even when\nthe petition on which rule was issued did not have the requisite\npleadings, was highlighted in the following words : (SCC p. 538, para\n\n5)\n\"5. ... Where large masses of people are poor, illiterate\nand ignorant and access to the courts is not easy on\naccount of lack of financial resources, it would be most\nunreasonable to insist that the petitioner should set out\nclearly and specifically the grounds on which he\nchallenges the order of detention and make out a prima\nfacie case in support of those grounds before a rule is\nissued or to hold that the detaining authority should not\nbe liable to do any thing more than just meet the specific\ngrounds of challenge put forward by the petitioner in the\npetition. The burden of showing that the detention is in\naccordance with the procedure established by law has\nalways been placed by this Court on the detaining\nauthority because\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution provides\nin clear and explicit terms that no one shall be deprived\nof his life or personal liberty except in accordance with\nprocedure established by law. This constitutional right\nof life and personal liberty is placed on such a high\npedestal by this Court that it has always insisted that\nwhenever there is any deprivation of life or personal\nliberty, the authority responsible for such deprivation\nmust satisfy the court that it has acted in accordance with\nthe law.

On a conspectus of the decisions referred to above and other\ndecisions on preventive detention, we may observe here that the\nargument commonly advanced on behalf of detaining authorities in\nthe early days of the Constitution was that the Court's enquiry ought\nto be confined to whether there is an order of detention or not and the\nmoment such an order, good on its face, is produced, all enquiry into\ngood faith, sufficiency of the reasons or the legality or illegality of the\naction comes to an end. However, with passage of time, and expansion\nand development of law, it is no longer the law that a preventive\ndetention action, howsoever lawful it might appear on its face, cannot\nbe invalidated by the constitutional courts. This is so, as at present,\nthere is no administrative order affecting rights of the subjects that\ncan legitimately claim to be impregnably guarded by a protective\nshield, which judicial scrutiny cannot penetrate.\n\n23. Apart from the aforesaid decisions, multiple decisions have been\nrendered by this Court over the years which provide suitable guidance\nto us to complete the present exercise; however, we wish to conclude\nthis discussion by referring to one decision of this Court delivered\n[Rekha v. State of T.N., (2011) 5 SCC 244 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 596]\nlittle in excess of a decade back by a Bench of 3 Judges.\n\n24.\nIn\nRekha v. State of T.N. [Rekha\nv. State of T.N., (2011) 5 SCC\n244 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 596] , this Court observed that : (SCC pp.\n253-55, paras 21 & 29)\n\"21. It is all very well to say that preventive detention is\npreventive not punitive. The truth of the matter, though,\nis that in substance a detention order of one year (or any\nother period) is a punishment of one year's\nimprisonment. What difference is it to the detenu whether\nhis imprisonment is called preventive or punitive?\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 24 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\n* * *\n\n29. Preventive detention is, by nature, repugnant to\ndemocratic ideas and an anathema to the Rule of law.\nNo such law exists in the USA and in England (except\nduring war time). Since, however,\nArticle 22(3)(b)\nof the\nConstitution of India permits preventive detention, we\ncannot hold it illegal but we must confine the power of\npreventive detention within very narrow limits,\notherwise we will be taking away the great right to\nliberty guaranteed by\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of\nIndia which was won after long, arduous and historic\nstruggles. It follows, therefore, that if the ordinary law\nof the land (the Penal Code and other penal statutes) can\ndeal with a situation, recourse to a preventive detention\nlaw will be illegal.\" [Ed. : It would appear that this\nentire extract from paras 21 and 29 of Rekha, (2011) 5\nSCC 244 : (2011) 2 SCC (Cri) 596, and in particular the\nobservation in para 29, that preventive detention is not\npermissible when the ordinary law of the land can deal\nwith the situation, is per incuriam paras 19 and 32 to 34\nof the Constitution Bench in\nHaradhan Saha v.

There could be little doubt with the thought process that\nalthough the executive would pass an order under the preventive\ndetention laws as a preventive or a precautionary measure, its effect\nviewed strictly from the standpoint of the detenu is simply and\nplainly punitive. Significantly, an order of detention is not relatable\nto an alleged commission of offence which a court is seized of and,\nthus, the conduct of the accused complained of, is yet to be found\nblameworthy; on the contrary, since it relates to an anticipated\noffence based on past conduct, the detenu could well feel that he is at\nthe receiving end of a subjective satisfaction of the executive despite\nhe not being proved to be on the wrong side of the law on any previous\noccasion. If someone loses his liberty and lands up in prison not\nhaving a semblance of a chance to resist or protest, the very\ncircumstance of being put behind bars for such period as specified\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 25 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\nin the order of detention based on an anticipation that an offence is\nlikely to be committed by him seems to be an aspect which does not\nsync with the norms and ethos of our very own Constitution and the\ndecisions of this Court in which the concept of \"life\" has been\nexplained in such a manner that \"life\" has been infused in the\nletters of\nArticle 21 (see Common Cause v. Union of India [Common\nCause v. Union of India\n, (1999) 6 SCC 667 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 1196] ).\nNonetheless, so long clause (3) of\nArticle 22\nof the Constitution itself\nauthorises detention as a preventive measure, there can be no two\nopinions that none can take exception to such a measure being\nadopted and it is only a limited judicial review by the constitutional\ncourts that can be urged by an aggrieved detenu wherefor too, in\nexamining challenges to orders of preventive detention, the Courts\nwould be loath to interfere with or substitute their own reasoning for\nthe subjective satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority. Since\nthe object of a preventive detention law is not punitive but preventive\nand precautionary, ordinarily it is best left to the discretion of the\ndetaining authority.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n[paragraph in bold and underline: emphasis supplied\nby this Court and paragraph underlined: emphasis in the original\njudgement]\n\n21. In the present circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion\nthat there is no live or proximate link between the alleged prejudicial activities\nof the Petitioner and that of passing of the detention order. Further considering\nthe fact that the bail of the Petitioner was rejected and he was already\nimmobilised, the propensity to further indulge in any unlawful activity also\ndid not exist at the time when the impugned order of detention was passed.\n\n22. In view thereof, the order dated 21st February, 2024 is hereby set aside.\n\n23. The present petition is allowed and disposed of accordingly.\n\n24. Pending application(s), if any, also stands disposed of.\n\n25. It is made clear that observation(s) made are with respect to the present\npetition only and not with respect to any cases pending trial against the\nPetitioner.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:BHASKAR\n\nSINGH RAWAT\n\nW.P.(CRL) 2114/2024 Page 26 of 27\n\nSigning Date:14.11.2024\n\n17:19:09\n\n26.
