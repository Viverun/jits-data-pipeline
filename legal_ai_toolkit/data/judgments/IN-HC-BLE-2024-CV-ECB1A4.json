Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by applicant in the instant OA are that\n\napplicant was duly recruited through employment exchange through test and\n\nvide appointment order dated 24.01.1984 (Annexure A-1) engaged as Casual\n\nLabour at Postal Store Depot, Muzaffarpur w.e.f. 26.06.1983. Subsequently,\n\napplicant was enrolled as Muster Roll Mazdoor along with five other\n\nemployees vide order dated 24.01.1984 (Annexure A-2). Thereafter, applicant\n\nPatna was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.1992 vide order dated 24.03.1992\nBench\n\nissued by Superintendent PSD, Muzaffarpur of Post Offices Division.\n\n4. Pursuant to Memo No. PSD/Vacancy Position/Group-D dated\n\n01.11.2007 (Annexure A-3) issued by the respondents, applicant was\n\nrecommended for absorption in departmental cadre against the vacancy created\n\ndue to retirement/death of Group-D w.e.f. 01.11.2007 vide order dated\n\n28.11.2007 (Annexure A-4) and appointed as Temporary Group-D and all\n\nfacilities of Group-D were extended to the applicant. Subsequently, applicant\n\nwas made permanent w.e.f. 01.11.2009 after completion of two years of\n\ncontinuous satisfactory service vide order dated 24.11.2009 (Annexure A-5).\n\n5. It was to dismay of the applicant that vide order dated 04.03.2011\n\napplicant was ordered his relieving with immediate effect. Aggrieved, applicant\n\napproached this Tribunal by way of OA No.148/2011, which was decided on\n\n31.05.2013 along with other connected matters with the reinstatement as TS\n\nCasual Worker prior to issue of order of relieving with same terms and\n\nconditions. Consequent upon the aforesaid Tribunal's order, the respondents\n\ncirculated a Policy decision in pursuance to Hon'ble Supreme Court decision in\n\n3 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nUma Devi's case wherein it has been stipulated that the Casual Labours having\n\nworked for 10 years or more are to be regularized.\n\n6. Applicant, being a low paid employee, approached the respondents\n\npraying for regularization but of no help. Applicant's services were not\n\nregularized despite being covered as per aforementioned policy decision and\n\nfinally he was issued order dated 24.04.2017 by the Superintendent, PSD,\n\nMuzaffarpur permitting him to retire w.e.f. the afternoon on 30.04.2017. After\n\nretirement, applicant is being denied his legitimate claim of pension and other\n\npensionary benefits.\n\nPatna\nBench 7. Applicant has served the respondent department from 26.06.1983 till his\n\nretirement on 30.04.2017 after rendering more than 33 years of service. He was\n\nconferred Temporary Status of Group-D w.e.f. 01.01.1992 (Annexure A-2) and\n\nafter rendering 3 years service, his status became to be at par with Temporary\n\nGroup-D employee. Due to lapse on the part of the respondents, applicant's\n\nservices were not regularized despite categorical policy decision issued by\n\nDepartment and now after retirement, applicant is being denied his pension all\n\nother pensionary benefits in an illegal manner. Resultantly, applicant has been\n\nleft to starve along with his dependents.\n\n8. Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have filed\n\nwritten statement and stated that applicant could not be regularized due to being\n\njunior to other TS Casual Labours. It is further stated that claim of the applicant\n\nfor pensionary and retirement gratuity under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 is not\n\njustifiable on the premise of Clarification No.1 to 8 to OM dated 10.09.1983\n\nregarding grant of temporary status and regularization of casual labours,\n\nclarifies that even after conferment of temporary status, these workers continue\n\nto be Casual Labours. It is also stated that in view of various decisions of\n\n4 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court on the issue on hand, retirement benefits are granted to\n\nemployees having temporary status only after their regularization. Hence,\n\nprovisions of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 are not applicable to the present OA.\n\n9. The sum and substance of case of applicant is that the applicant duly\n\nrecruited employee through employment exchange, faced written exam for\n\nrecruitment. Appointed in due manner as per Constitutional Scheme for\n\nappointment as Casual Labour/Mazdoor in Postal Store Depot, w.e.f.\n\n26.06.1983 vide Office Order dated 24.01.1984 (Annexure A-1).

Respondents recommended and absorbed against vacant post vide Order\nBench\n\ndated 01.11.2007 (Annexure A-3 & A-4) and confirmation and made permanent\n\nvide Order dated 24.11.2009 (Annexure A-5) w.e.f. 01.11.2009. The\n\nrespondents cancelled Order of regularization as well as permanent\n\nappointment vide Order dated 18.02.2011 (Annexure A-6). The applicant\n\napproached this Tribunal in OA No.148/2011 decided vide common Order\n\ndated 31.05.2013 (Annexure A-7). This Tribunal directed continuance of\n\nservice as temporary status casual labour and directed to consider applicant\n\nfor regularization. Respondents kept case of applicant pending in temporary\n\nemployee of Group 'D' with T.S. status till 30.04.2017, date of retirement.\n\nApplicant worked for more than 33 years from 1983 till 30.04.2017 but neither\n\nregularized nor granted pension under Rules, 1965.

Thereafter conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n01.01.1992 rendering continuous long, efficient service all his active life till\nretired on 30.04.2017. The core issue arises before this Tribunal for\ndetermination is:-\n\n\"Whether applicant who was appointed through process as a casual\nlobourer and thereafter conferred the status of temporary employee w.e.f.\n01.01.1992 and retired on 30.04.2017 is entitled to benefit of pension or\nnot?\"\n\nANALYSIS\n\n13. Before dealing with the rival contentions advanced at the Bar. It is\napposite to quote relevant portion of language of the statutory scheme, policy of\nUnion of India Ministry of Communications & I.T., Department of Posts, The\nCentral Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1965, the Central Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules 2021, judgment binding precedents in similar cases,\nin cases of pari-materia provisions passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble\nHigh Courts, our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and Benches of the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal as under:-.\n\n8 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nRULE OF LAW\n(A)(i) The casual labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization\nScheme issued by Department of Posts, Govt. of India dated 12.04.1991 drawn in\ncompliance of Hon'ble Supreme Court directions and approved by his Excellency\nPresident of India relevant portion is reproduced as under for appreciation of the\nCore issue involved in the present OA:-\n\nCasual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularisation)\nScheme : In compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt a scheme was drawn up by this Department in consultation with the\nMinistries of Law, Finance and Personnel and the President has been\npleased to approve the said scheme. The scheme is as follows :-\n\n1. Temporary status would be conferred on all casual labourers in\nemployment as on 29.11.1969 and who continue to be currently\nemployed and have rendered continuous service of at least one\nyear during the year during the year they must have been engaged\nfor a period of 240 days (206 days in the case of offices observing\nfive days week).\n\n2. Such casual workers engaged for full working hours viz 8 hours\nincluding ½ hour's lunch time will be paid at daily rate on the\nbasis of the minimum of the pay scale for a regular Group 'D'\nofficial including DA, HRA with CCA.\n\n3. Benefit of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'\nPatna\nBench employee would be taken into account for calculating per month\nrate wages after completion of one year of service from the date\nof conferment of Temporary Status. Such increment will be taken\ninto account after every one year of service subject to\nperformance of duty for at least 240 days (206 days in\nestablishments observing five days week) in the year.\n\n4. Leave entitlement will be one day for every 10 days' of work\nCasual leave or any other kind of leave except maternity leave,\nwill not be admissible. No encashment of leave is permissible on\ntermination of services for any reason or on the casual labourers\nquitting service.\n\n5. Maternity leave to lady full time casual lanbourers will be\nallowed as admissible to regular Group 'D' employees.\n\n6. 50% of the service rendered under Temporary Status would be\ncounted for the purpose of retirement benefits after regularization\nas a regular Group 'D'. official.\n\n7. Conferment of Temporary Status does not automatically imply\nthat the casual labourers would be appointed as a regular Group\n'D' employees within any fixed time frame. Appointment in\nGroup 'D' vacancies will continue to be done as per the extant\nRecruitment Rules, which stipulate preference to eligible ED\nemployee.\n\n8. After rendering three years' continuous service after\nconferment of temporary status the casual labourers would be\ntreated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees for the\npurposes of contribution to General Provident Fund. They\nwould also further be eligible for the grant of Festival\nAdvance, Flood Advance on the same conditions as are\napplicable to temporary Group 'D' employee provided they\nfurnish two sureties from permanent Government servants of\nthis Department.\n\n9. Their entitlement to Productivity Linked Bonus will continue to\nbe at the rate applicable to casual labourers.\n\n10. Temporary status does not debar dispensing with the service of\nthe casual labourers after following the due procedure.\n\n11. If a labourer with temporary status commits a misconduct and the\nsame is proved in an enquiry after giving him reasonable\nopportunity his services will be dispensed with.\n\n12. Casual labourers may be regularized in units other than recruiting\nunits also subject to availability of vacancies.\n\n9 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\n13. For purpose of appointment as a regular Group 'd' official the\ncasual labourers will be allowed age relaxation to the extent of\nservice rendered by them as casual labourers.\n\n14. The casual labourers can be deployed any where within the\nrecruitment unit /territorial circle on the basis of availability of\nwork.\n\n15. The engagement of the casual labourers will continue to be on\ndaily rates of pay on need basis.\n\n16. The conferment of temporary status has no relation to availability\nof sanctioned regular Group 'D' posts.\n\n17. No recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts except\ncompassionate appointment will be done till casual labourers\nwith the requisite qualification are available to fill up the posts in\nquestion.\n\nFurther action may be taken in regard to the casual labourers by each unit\nas per the above said scheme.

No. 1624/1986 working as substitute\nemployees and casual labourers in the Department of Posts, Govt. of\nIndia claimed relief to treat at par with regular employees and be paid\nsame emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin Para 11 directed as under:-\n\n\" 11 The Temporary Status would be available to the casual\nlabourers in the Postal Department on completion of one year\ncontinuous service with at least 240 days of work (2036 days\nin the case of officers observing five days week) and on\nconferment of temporary status, House Rent Allowance and\nCity Compensatory Allowance shall be admissible. There\nwould be no justification to withhold Maternity Leave as that\nis an obligation of the employer under the law and the state as\nan ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State\nPolicy envisaged in Part-IV of the Constitution should\nprovide the same. After rendering three years of continuous\nservice with temporary status, the casual labouers shall be\ntreated at par with temporary Grade 'D' employees of the\nPatna\nDepartment of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such\nBench benefits as are admissible to Group \"D\" employees on regular\nbasis.\"\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n(ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of Yashwant\nHari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in (1996) 7 SCC 113,\ndealing with question for determination \"whether appellant is entitled to\nany pensionary benefits since total service of more than eighteen years\nwas in quasi-permanent/temporary.\" The Hon'ble Supreme Court has\nheld:-\n\n\"3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for\nthe union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the\nappellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of\nquasi-permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was\nnecessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.\nIt is contended that since the total service of the appellant was\nin quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary\nbenefits.\n\nThere is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was\nnot made permanent even when he had served the Government for\n18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied\nthe pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a\npermanent employee of the government. The appellant having\nserved the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to\ntreat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.\n\nKeeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we\nhold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent\nafter he served the Government for such a long period. The services\nof the appellant shall be treated to be in permanent capacity and he\nshall be entitled to the pensionary benefits. We allow the appeal, set\naside the judgment of the Tribunal and direct the respondents to\ntreat the appellant as having been retired from service on 7.3.1980\nafter serving the Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of\npermanent service) and as such his case for grant of pension be\nfinalized within six months from the receipt of this order. The\nappellant shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date\nof retirement.\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n(iii) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical facts\nand issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain Singh,\nCWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017.

The Hon'ble High\nCourt considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such\nlack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The\nHon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family\nPension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased\nemployee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary\ncapacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary\nemployee.\n\nThe Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of\nfamily pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by\nnotionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for\na period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.\n\n15 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\n15.

The applicant Awadhesh\nPrasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on 13.1.1984 on daily wages, conferred\ntemporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and retired on October, 2019 after 35 years of\ntotal service as temporary status and not been regularized.\n\nThe Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of clause 5 of\nPatna Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66-9/91-SPB.

The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of\norder relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\ncase of\nPrem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others\nreported in\n(2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-\n\n\"35. There are some of the employees who have not been regularized in\nspite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or more years whereas\nthey have been superannuated. As they have worked in work-charged\nestablishment, not against any particular project, their services ought to\nhave been regularized under the Government instructions and even as per\nthe decision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma\nDevi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court in the said decision has laid down that\nin case services have been rendered for more than ten years without the\ncover of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be\nregularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those employees\nwho have worked for ten years or more should have been regularized. It\nwould not be proper to regulate them for consideration of regularisation\nas others have been regularised, we direct that their services be treated as\na regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to\nclaiming any dues of difference in wages had they been continued in\nservice regularly before attaining the age of superannuation. They shall be\nentitled to receive the pension as if they have retired from the regular\nestablishment and the services rendered by them right from the day they\nentered the work-charged establishment shall be counted as qualifying\nservice for purpose of pension.\n\n36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement\nBenefits Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered in the work-charged\nestablishment shall be treated as qualifying service under the aforesaid\nrule for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three\nyears only before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid\naccordingly within three months. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the\nemployees are allowed and filed by the State are dismissed.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n16 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\n(ii) Hon'ble High Court, Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024 in\n\nUnion of India & Ors. vs. Awadhesh Prasad Singh\n(arising out of order\ndated 02.08.2021 in\nOA No.050/00143/2018 Awadhesh Prasad Singh vs.\nUnion of India & Ors.\n). Their Lordships vide order dated 08.04.2024,\nheard the matter at length and observed that no prima facie case made out.\nThereafter vide order dated 20.06.2024 upheld order dated 28.10.2021 in\nOA No.143 of 2018. The present OA on hand also no different.\n\n(b) In the similar and identical situation the learned Coordinate Bench\nChandigarh of the Tribunal recently in October 2023 adjudicated in OA No.\n060/690/2019 (Chandigarh) Santosh Kumar versus Union of India & ors\nallowed OA directing to grant family pension and other retiral benefits of the\ndeceased employee. The learned Tribunal dealt issue \"whether the person\nwho has not been regularized by the respondents the provision of Rule 54 (2)\nof the CCS Pension Rules, 1972 is attracted or not ? The learned Tribunal\nhas considered the matter and examined in detail Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension\nRules, 1972 and observed that provisions are pari materia to Rule 75- Family\nPension Scheme for Railway servants, 1954.\nSo also held that case is covered\nby judgement in case of\nAlka Sharma vs Union of India & ors\n2017 (2)\nSCT (P&H) (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana.\n\nSo also\ncase of\nSr. Superintendent of Post Offices and ors vs Painu Ram\nin CWP.\n\nNo.22990/2014 decided on 23.7.2018 by Hon'ble High Court of Himachal\nPatna Pradesh and reliance has also been placed upon judgement passed by Hon'ble\nBench Supreme Court in case of\nJagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd) and others vs\nMahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd & anr\netc, 1990 supp. SC 113.\n\nSo also\nobserved that case is fully covered by judgement of Hon'ble High Court of\nHimachal Pradesh in matter of\nUnion of India vs Meena Devi\nin CWP No.\n34 of 2014 decided on 23.7.2018.\n\n16. In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue \"applicant casual\nlabour of department of posts obtaining temporary status on 01.01.1992\naccordance with the scheme not regularized retired on 30.04.2017 is entitled to\npension and pensionary benefits.\"\n\n17. Admittedly, applicant was initially engaged as Casual Labourer in year\n1983 retired on 30.04.2017. The department of posts vide instruction dated\n17.5.1989 clarified that all daily wagers working in post offices are to be treated\nas casual labourers. The department of posts has made Scheme known as\nCasual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization)\nScheme effective from 01.10.1989. The scheme provided provisions for\nconferment of temporary status to casual labourers. So also the scheme\nspecified advantages at part with Group 'D' regular employee available on\nconferment of status of temporary employee.\n\n18. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition\nbefore Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nJagrit MazdoorUnion and ors\nversus Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking\nrelief that substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same\nemoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n\n17 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\ntemporary status would be available to the casual labourers in the postal\ndepartment on completion of one year of continuous service with at least 240\ndays of work and on conferment of temporary status. The state as an ideal\nemployer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly\nwith regular employees in the department.\n\n19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in\nJagrit Mazdoor\nUnion\n(supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-\n\n\"After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the\ncasual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of\nthe Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are\nadmissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n20.\nIn compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n(supra). The Department of Posts, Government of\nPatna\nBench\nIndia formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary\nStatus and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been\ndrawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and\nPersonnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously\npleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers\nworking continuously for long period.\n\n21. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and\nbeneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits\nto long continuous working of casual labourers.\n\n22. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on casual\nlabourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant is appointee of year\n1983 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize and ought to have\nbeen regularized before 30.04.2017 accordance with law as regular employee\nfor no fault of applicant made to suffer violating\nArticle 14\n, 21\n, 31A\nand\nof\nthe Constitution of India.\n\n23. The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.1992\npursuant to order dated 24.03.1992 (Annexure A-2) and the statutory binding\nscheme has conferred after 3 years certain advantages to temporary employee as\nprovided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the pay scale for a regular\ngroup'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA. Para 3 provides for benefits of\nincrement at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D' employee after\n\n18 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\ncompletion of one year of service from date of conferment of Temporary status.\nThe Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of increment to a government\nservant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent is clear as noon day in\nformulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and writ in the nature of\nmandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as social legislation to\nenhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The Central Government\nbeing an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policies\nenvisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating temporary status\ncasual labour after long period at par with temporary Group 'D' employee of\nthe Department granting benefits and treating at par with and entitled for such\nbenefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on regular basis. The\nscheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity Leave as to regular\nGroup 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary status for retirement\nPatna\nBench benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on absorption. So also the\nscheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation with harmonious\nconstruction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically provides for conferment\nof temporary group 'D' status after rendering three years continuous service as\ntemporary status.\n\n24. The applicant was conferred temporary status on 01.01.1982 and\naccordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial\nconstruction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant after three\nyears since 01.01.1992 meaning thereby since 01.01.1995 has attained status of\ntemporary Group 'D' employees and regularly contributed to G.P.F. The\napplicant was in capacity of temporary employee. The applicant having\ncontinuously worked as temporary status casual labourer since 26.06.1983 and\non 01.01.1995 is holder of post of temporary employee/quasi permanent status\nand deserves to be dealt fairly by the model employer state accordance with\nguarantee enshrined in the\nArticle 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. This\nTribunal is of the view whereof that it is unfair to continue applicant such a\nlong in temporary post and without considering for regularizing till retirement.\nRespondents regularized applicant in year 2007 but cancelled said order on\n18.02.2011 as there was no vacancy but thereafter in 33 years could not\nregularize.\n\n25. The applicant acquired status of temporary employee Group 'D' of\nDepartment of Posts and it is well settled in law that entitled for such benefits\n\n19 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nas are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis. So also held by\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n(supra).\n\n26. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no\nrecruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers\navailable to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged\nstatutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the\nConstitution of India and applicant husband not regularized as for no fault\ncannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his duty\nand not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take\nadvantages and plea not even considered for regularization available to them\nthat since no regularization no pension etc.\n\nPatna\n\n27. The applicant submitted representation dated 31.10.2017 and filed OA\nBench\nNo.148 of 2011 to allow to participate in absorption to regularize services on\nregular cadre post but no response in spite of decision vide order dated\n31.05.2013. The applicant could not be provided opportunity for regularization\nas Group 'D' through selection in view of limited vacancies kept for selection\nof casual labourers as contained in written statement and averments of OA that\nrespondents not regularized services of applicant. The applicant was never at\nfault for such lack of regularization.\n\n28. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in\nthe O.A that respondents have not regularized services on regular post as per\nlaw on time, in spite of written requests and retired on 30.04.2017 without\nbeing regularized. This Tribunal is of the view since respondents state failed to\ndischarge his statutory duty as per the Scheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even\nonce considered for regularization since 1983. Hence respondents cannot take\nadvantage of own mistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits as not\nregularized deceased employee before retirement. The matter of right, right\naccrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to applicant and he ought\nto have at least considered for regularization before date of superannuation. The\napplicant worked since 1983 till 30.04.2017 almost more than thirty three (33)\nyears in the department.\n\n29. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein\nabove enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated\n\n20 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\n30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I. (5). Benefits of\ncasual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status\nreproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the employee in\nlight of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken away by\nrespondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication & I.T.\nUnion of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of\nimplementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also envisaged\nin D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are\nsubstantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to\nemployee accrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and\ntortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless\nregularized no pensionry benefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not\nbe denied relief claimed.\n\nPatna\nBench\n\n30. The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992\nquoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal\ndepartment with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly\nacquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits admissible to temporary\nGroup 'D' employee such as counting of service for purpose of pension and\nterminal benefits as in case of temporary employees appointed on regular basis\nwhile granting them pension and retirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n31. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are\nregulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The\nRule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death\ngratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as\nare applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS\nPension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension\nand benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2\nCCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired without substantive\nappointment are held entitled for pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Rules 2021.\n\n32. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as\nextracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes\ntemporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021\nare applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So also the\nexplanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6) cases\n\n21 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nof government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil services and\nposts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st December, 2003,\nwho retired or were retired before having been appointed in a substantive\ncapacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the government\nservant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)\nRules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as admissible to any other\npublic servant and respondents have violated fundamental right enshrined in\n\nArticle 14\nand\nof Constitution of India.\n\n33. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years\nservice in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated\n30.11.1992 provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and\nretirement benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status\nPatna\nBench\nfollowed by regularization.\n\n34. The applicant stood retired on 30.04.2017 as temporary employee for no\nfault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge his duties and no\nrebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2021\nand Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension, family pension and\nretirement benefits to temporary employee. The status of employee was at par\nwith regular employee on long continuation on temporary post in welfare state.\nThe Scheme of statutory Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would\nprevail over any policy decision.\n\n35. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it\nclear that applicant who stood retired before having been appointed in a\nsubstantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type of category of\ntemporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension, retirement gratuity,\ndeath gratuity and family pension shall be payable to applicant same scale as\nadmissible to permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to the extent\nprovided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:-\n\n(i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation\nafter having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent\nservice of not less than 10 years.\n\n(ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of\ncontinuous temporary service.\n\n(iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n36. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes\nclarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021\n\n22 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\n(erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of\nwhereof of the affirm view that Government of India, Department of Posts\ninstructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992\nand Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read\nconjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial\nlegislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered\nservice not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes\nentitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the\npart of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension\nRules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers\nthe said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state\nas an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy\nenvisaged in Part IV of the Constitution.\n\nPatna\nBench\n\n37. Thus respondents can not take advantages of their own wrong and lapses\nand for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and applicant entitled to\nreceive pension as if retired from regular establishment and so also held by\nHon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgement in case of\nPrem Singh versus\nState of U.P & Ors\n(2019) 10 SCC 516 reproduced herein above.\n\n38. The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in\ncase of\nUnion of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.\n154 of 2019 decided\non 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in\nO.A. No. 372/2017 (\nBhikhani Devi Vs Union of India\n) as Tribunal relied on\nratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against\nsame.\n\nTheir Lordships in case of\nBhikhani Devi\n(supra) observed that\njudgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none\nof them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that\nthere is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'\nunless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an\nemployee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be\nadmissible.\n\n39. The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the Division\nBench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal issue dealt in\ndetail rules applicable in case of\nUnion of India and ors versus Meena Devi\n@ Meena Kunwar CWJC No.\n7760 of 2015 decided on 08.12.2022,\n\n23 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nreported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 affirming order dated 20.3.2013 in similar OA\nNo. 164/2008 (Patna) and granted benefits of family pension arrears as per Rule\n10 (2) of Rules 1965 and CCS Pension Rules 1972 widow of employee died as\ntemporary employee without being regularized.\n\nThis Tribunal has considered\nthe submissions of the counsel for the parties and in judgement in case of\n\nBhikhani Devi\n(supra) previous cases not referred to the larger bench perused\nthe ratio\nlaid down by\ntheir Lordships in case of\nMeena Devi @ Meena\nKunwar\n(supra) decided on 08.12.2022.

After considering the proposition of law\nprecedent/ratio decidendi has been laid down. This Tribunal is bound by the\nprecedent in\nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n(supra) principle of law laid\ndown interpreting service rules applicable in the case. The present case is also\ncovered by the above binding-ratio decedendi, precedent.\n\nThe preposition of\nlaw as laid down considering relevant service rules in\nMeena Devi @ Meena\nKunwar\n(supra) by Hon'ble High Court Patna constitutes binding precedent\non this Tribunal and present case is also deserves same treatment.\n\n40. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and legal\nissue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding judicial\npronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court\nof Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and\nCoordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present case is no different. This\nTribunal is of the considered opinion that the case of applicant is a covered\nmatter on facts and legal issue involved in the present case and no more res-\n\n24 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nintegra. The applicant is also entitled for the same treatment and consequential\nbenefits envisaged in the Fundamental Right under\nArticle 14\n\n& 21\nof\nConstitution of India guaranteed to the applicant too.\n\n41. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5 of the\nScheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit to casual\nlabourers on completion of three years service in temporary status of Casual\nLabourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme is crystal\nclear that temporary employee is entitled to pension and retirement benefits, if\nhe has completed three years of service in temporary status followed by\nregularization. The applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.1992 and\nnot been regularized by respondents in spite of requests and for no fault stood\nretired on 30.04.2017 and in year 2018 filed OA No.148 of 2011, this Tribunal\nPatna\nBench\ndirected on 31.05.2013 to consider for regularization and present OA filed in\nyear 2018.\n\n42.

It is also submitted that\nRule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a regular\nemployee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari Kakkar\n(supra) has held that it would be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary\nbenefits simply on ground that he was not a permanent employee not\nregularized after served for 18 ½ years.\n\n25 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\n44.\nIn case of Rameshwari Devi versus Union of India, OA No.36 of\n2021 (CAT Patna Bench) vide order dated 17.01.2022 in case of employee\nwith temporary status, placed reliance on judgment of\nYashwant Hari\nKatakkar versus Union of India\n, (1996) 7 SCC 113, order of Principal Bench\nin OA No.1287 of 2000. This Tribunal held that applicant's husband served\ncontinuously as Temporary Status Casual Labour for almost 22 years and not\nbeen regularized for reasons best known to the employer.\nIn O.A.

This Tribunal in case Rameshwari Devi (Supra) vide order\ndated 17.01.2022 directed respondents to process for issuance of Pension\nPayment Order.

No. 164 of 2008 (\nMeena Devi vs.\nUnion of India\n) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC No.7760 of 2015\n(\nUnion of India versus Meena Devi\n) vide judgment dated 08.12.2022,\nHon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension, family pension.\n\nReference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita Devi (Supra) was\nwhether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' -\nwithout regularization was entitled for pension, family pension and benefits this\nTribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as\nregular Group 'D' (MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at\npar with Group 'D' employee and issue pension, family pension and benefits\nwith arrears.\n\n46.\nIn case of\nShiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others\n\nO.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin with issue -\n\n26 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nwhether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as Temporary Status\nat par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled for pension and other\nretirement benefits? Applicant was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post\nand applicant did not accept and continued as Temporary Status and retired as\ntemporary status employee at par with Group 'D'. Applicant started\nemployment as Night Guard on daily basis in Postal Department, conferred\nstatus of Temporary Status, selected as MTS, did not join denied pension,\nfamily pension. This Tribunal in case Shiv Shankar Sah (Supra) considered\norders passed in similar facts in OA No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015\nupheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on\npart of Postal Department not to regularize the services of husband, private\nrespondent in 23 years of service after having granted temporary status at par\nwith Group 'D' employee and conduct of postal department cannot be\nPatna\nBench appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978\nof 2017 upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing\nrespondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under old\npension scheme.\n\n47. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that as per rules\nfor temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on\nregularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service\nafter regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On\nworking for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'\nemployee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not\nregularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of\nrespondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise\nmeeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible\nfor pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order\npassed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not\nregularized and allowed OA for grant of pension. In case of Shiv Chandra Sah\n(Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant\nentitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary\nStatus period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on\n03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service\nand to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\nRespondents challenged order dated 21.02.2022 in identical case on hand titled\n\n27 OA No. /050/0070/2018\n\nShiv Chandra Shah (supra) in CWJC No.1415 of 2023 Union of India vs.\nShiv Chandra Shah, upheld by Hon'ble High Court, Patna vide order dated\n22.08.2024.\n\n48.

This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not\nissue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right\naccrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule\nPatna\nBench\n2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.\nSo also placed reliance in case OA\nNo.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of\n2017 in\nRatneshwar Singh\n(Supra) this Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018,\nallowed OA and directed for fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other\nretiral dues in light of judgment passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and\nCWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA\nNo.372/2017.\n\n49. Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India\n& Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld\nthis Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships\nconsidered argument of respondents department that contention of department\ncannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be\nconstrued that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying\nfor more than 27 years.\n\n50. The present case is similar to cases cited herein above and covered by\nabove precedents.\n\n51.

Relevant\n\nPatna\nparagraphs 39 to 48 for ready reference are reproduced as under:-\n\nBench\n\n39.\nIn\nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n(supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court\nheld that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was\nnot made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½\nyears. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary\nbenefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent\nemployee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances\nappellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the\ngovernment for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be\npermanent capacity and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.\n\n40.\nIn\nKritnarain Singh\n(Supra), Smt Ram Kali Devi (supra),\n\nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n(supra), Division Bench of Hon'ble\nHigh Court Patna examined core issue involved in present OA and their\nLordships upheld the orders passed by this Tribunal in same facts and\nlaw and observed that failure on part of postal department respondents\nnot to regularize services of employees serving for long period can not be\nappreciated and directed respondents to extend benefits of pension, family\npension etc. So also upheld orders of this Tribunal in identical cases.\n\n41. In Shri Painu Ram (supra) Division Bench of Hon'ble High\nCourt of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla dealing with identical issue on\nsimilar facts upheld order dated 31.1.2014 passed by coordinate Bench\nChandigarh of this Tribunal in O.A.
