The\n\nconsequence of the judgment of the Division Bench dated 6 August 2018 is that the\n\nwrit petition instituted by the appellants under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution stands\n\ndismissed. This has given rise to the present batch of appeals. Since similar issues\n\narise, all the appeals were heard together.\n\n2 The appellants were appointed as Patwaris in the Revenue Department on 21\n\nDecember 1993. On 17 June 2011, an advertisement was issued by the State of\n\nRajasthan for holding a departmental examination to select candidates for 93\n\nvacancies in the post of Land Records Inspector1. The vacancies related to the\n\nyears 2008-09 and 2009-10. A fresh advertisement dated 28 January 2013 notified\n\nan increase in the number of vacancies to 155, including the vacancies for 2010-11.\n\nIn response to a query made on 24 December 2014 under the\nRight to Information\n\nAct\n2005, a year-wise bifurcation of the 155 vacancies was provided indicating that:\n\n 67 vacancies arose in 2008-09;\n“LRI”\n 26 vacancies arose in 2009-10; and\n\n 62 vacancies arose in 2010-11.\n\n3 On 16 May 2013, the appellants appeared for the departmental examination\n\nand were declared successful for the post of LRI. On 7 November 2013, a\n\nprovisional seniority list was issued from 1 April 2012. The grievance of the\n\nappellants is that though (in their submission) they were appointed against\n\nvacancies that arose in 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11, their names were not\n\nincluded in the provisional seniority list. On 31 March 2014, the appellants were\n\npromoted as LRIs in pursuance of which they have been working on that post. On\n\n12 March 2015, the Rajasthan Revenue Board2 issued a communication to the\n\nCollector to prepare a list of persons who were appointed as LRIs against vacancies\n\nfor the year 2009-10. The names of the appellants did not find mention in the\n\nseniority list as on 1 April 2012. Orders were issued on 11 June 2015, 6 July 2015\n\nand 6 August 2015 promoting LRIs to the post of Nayab Tehsildar, treating them to\n\nhave been appointed on the post of LRI against the year of promotion in which the\n\nvacancies arose. This was in terms of a notification dated 8 October 2014 by which\n\nRule 171-A of the Rajasthan Land Revenue (Land Records) Rules 1957 3 was\n\namended to change the criterion for determining seniority from the date of\n\ncontinuous officiation on the post of LRI to the recruitment year of promotion. The\n\nappellants were aggrieved by the denial of the benefit of the notification dated 8\n“Board”\n“1957 Rules”\nOctober 2014. Aggrieved by what was perceived as differential treatment, a\n\nrepresentation was submitted on 14 September 2015 to the Chairman of the Board\n\nof Revenue for granting the appellants the benefit of the notification dated 8 October\n\n2014 and placing them in the seniority list against the recruitment year. A final\n\nseniority list, computing seniority as on 1 April 2012 was issued on 12 May 2016 in\n\nterms of Rule 171-A(2). According to the appellants, their names were not included\n\nin the seniority list despite the fact that the recruitment year was 2010-11.\n\n4 This led to the institution of a Writ Petition4 by the appellants before the High\n\nCourt of Rajasthan seeking a direction for the declaration of appointments;\n\npromoting them against the recruitment year of promotion and placing them in the\n\nseniority list issued on 12 May 2016 against the recruitment year of promotion with\n\nconsequential benefits. On 24 April 2017, another final seniority list was issued\n\ndetermining seniority as on 1 April 2014. The appellants claim that they were placed\n\nbelow persons who were promoted against vacancies which arose after the year of\n\nvacancies against which the appellants were promoted. During the pendency of the\n\nWrit Petition, an order was passed by the State of Rajasthan on 8 May 2017\n\nwhereby, persons along with the appellants who were placed in the seniority list\n\ndated 24 April 2017, were sought to be removed from the list and were directed to\nSB Civil Writ Petition No 6530/2016\nbe treated as appointed in 2014-15. This gave rise to a subsequent Writ Petition5\n\nbefore the High Court.\n\n5 By a judgment dated 19 April 2018, the Single Judge allowed the Writ Petition\n\nby setting aside the action of the State in not regarding the year of promotion of\n\nthose, including the appellants, who were selected pursuant to the advertisements\n\ndated 17 June 2011 and 28 January 2013 against vacancies for 2008-09, 2009-10\n\nand 2010-11. The Single Judge held that persons selected under Rule 284(2) of the\n\n1957 Rules through a competitive examination restricted to serving Patwaris were\n\nentitled to be promoted against the vacancies of the respective years subject to their\n\neligibility. The State was accordingly directed to place persons selected in the final\n\nseniority list issued on 12 May 2016 against the recruitment year of promotion with\n\nconsequential benefits.\n\n6 The judgment of the Single Judge has been reversed in appeal by the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court on 6 August 2018.\n\n7 Assailing the judgment of the Division Bench, the appellants moved this Court\n\nin proceedings under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. Pleadings have been\n\ncompleted. We have heard Mr Paras Kuhad, Senior Counsel on behalf of the\n\nAppellants; Dr Manish Singhvi, Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Rajasthan;\nSB Civil Petition No 6299/2017\nMr P N Misra, Senior Counsel, Mr Manoj Swarup, Senior Counsel and Mr Hitendra\n\nNath Rath, Mr Rohit K Singh and Ms Pratibha Jain, Counsel for the contesting\n\nrespondents.\n\n8 In order to appreciate the nature of the controversy in the present batch of\n\nappeals, it is necessary to understand the enabling legal framework. The State of\n\nRajasthan, in pursuance of its powers conferred by\nSection 261(2)\nof the Rajasthan\n\nLand Revenue Act 19566, laid down provisions governing the service conditions of\n\nthe employees of the Land Revenue Department. They were embodied in the 1957\n\nRules. Rule 284 of the 1957 Rules regulates the mode of selection to the post of\n\nLRI. Initially selection was envisaged through direct recruitment and on seniority-\n\ncum-merit. Later, as explained below, a proportion was set apart for in-service\n\ncandidates who passed a competitive departmental examination. Thereafter, direct\n\nrecruitment was abolished. Rule 284 was amended from time to time in the following\n\nmanner:\n\n On 22 September 1977, recruitment to the post was to be made on the basis of\n\ndirect recruitment (50 per cent) and seniority-cum-merit (50 per cent);\n\n On 27 June 1981, the quota for promotion through seniority-cum-merit was\n\nincreased to 65 per cent; 15 per cent was to be through a competitive\n\nexamination amongst serving Patwaris and 20 per cent was to be through direct\n\nrecruitment; and\n“Act 1956”\n On 22 August 1985, promotion through seniority-cum-merit was increased to 80\n\nper cent, while selection through a departmental examination for serving\n\nPatwaris was increased to 20 per cent. The category of direct recruitment was\n\ndeleted.\n\nRule 284, as amended, reads thus:\n\n“284. Selection of candidates for admission to the school in\nthe respective cadre strength shall be made:-\n\n(i) by promotion of Patwaris of the Revenue and Land\nRecords Departments, on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit, for 80% of the vacancies;\n\n(ii) on the basis of a competitive examination which shall\nbe restricted to serving patwaris of Revenue (Land\nRecords) Department who fulfill the conditions of\neligibility as given in Rules 286, for 20% of the\nvacancies. Provided that the minimum age limit for\nsuch patwaris shall be 45 years.”\n\nRule 285 requires the Board to notify the actual number of vacancies that will be\n\nfilled up by recruitment from among the serving Patwaris of the Revenue (Land\n\nRecords) Department and the number to be allotted to the Scheduled Castes and\n\nScheduled Tribes.\n\nRule 286 prescribes the qualifications:\n\n“286. Qualifications - Candidates intending to apply for\nselection must possess the following qualification: -\n\n(i) That he is a patwari of Revenue (Land Records)\nDepartment and has five years of service experience\nas patwari;\n\n(ii) That he has passed Secondary Examination or any\nother equivalent examination recognized by\nGovernment;\n(iii) That he is not above 45 years of age on the first day\nof January, next following the last date fixed for\nreceipt of application for admission to the said\nschool;\n\n(iv) That he is patwar diploma holder or he is exempted\nfrom this diploma as per rules.”\n\nRule 287 requires a competitive examination to be held by the Board for recruitment\n\nfrom amongst serving Patwaris of the Revenue (Land Records) Department for\n\nadmission to the training school in the manner laid down in the 1957 Rules. Rule\n\n288 provides for the submission of applications, the subjects for the examination,\n\npreparation of a list of candidates securing qualifying marks, making of admissions\n\nto the school, reservations, salary during training, grant of diplomas on the passing\n\nof the training examination and the maintenance of a list of successful candidates on\n\nthe basis of the aggregate marks obtained in the examination. Rule 299 provides\n\nthat upon the completion of one year of probation period, candidates would be\n\neligible for being confirmed. Rule 299 stipulates that promotees of the same year\n\nshall rank senior to the direct recruits from serving Patwaris of the same year. Rule\n\n299 contains a reference to direct recruitment though the provision for direct\n\nrecruitment has been done away with in Rule 284.\n\n9 On 22 September 1977, an amendment was made to the 1957 Rules by the\n\nintroduction of Part V-A containing Rules 347-A and 347-B. Rule 347-A provides\n\nthus:\n\n“347-A. Regulation of pay, Leave, allowances, Pension etc.-\nExcept as otherwise provided in these rules, the pay\nallowances, pension, leave and other conditions of service of\nthe Patwaris, Inspectors‟ Land Records and Sadar Qanungos\nshall be regulated by the following rules as amended from\ntime to time:-\n\n1. The Rajasthan Travelling Allowance Rules, 1971;\n\n2. The Rajasthan Civil Services (Unification of Pay\nScales) Rules, 1950;\n\n3. The Rajasthan Civil Services (Rationalisation of Pay\nScales) Rules, 1956;\n\n4. The Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951;\n\n5. The Rajasthan Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules,\n1961;\n\n6. The Rajasthan Civil Services (New Pay) Rules, 1968\n\n7. Any other rules prescribing general conditions of\nservice made by the appropriate authority under the\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India and for\nthe time being in force.\n\n8. Any other general order or amendment in the Rajasthan\nSubordinate Services (Recruitment and other Service\nConditions) Rules 1960, issued by the Department of\nPersonnel shall mutatis mutandis be applicable unless\nany order to the contrary is issued by the Government.”\n\nRule 347-B provides thus:\n\n“347-B Application of Certain miscellaneous Rules. -\nNotwithstanding anything contained in these rules, the\nfollowing rules shall apply to the recruitment and other\nconditions of service of the Patwaris, Inspectors, Land\nRecords and Sadar Qanungos as they apply to other\ncategories of Government servants: -\n\n1. The Rajasthan Civil Services (Absorption of Surplus\nPersonnel) Rules, 1969.\n\n2. The Rajasthan Civil Services (Substantive appointment\nand determination of seniority of temporary employees)\nRules, 1972.\n\n3. The Rajasthan Services (Recruitment by promotion\nagainst vacancies of Earlier Years) Rules, 1972.”\n10 Rule 347-A provides that except as otherwise provided in the rules, pay,\n\nallowances, pension, leave and other conditions of service are to be regulated by\n\nthe rules enumerated under eight categories. Among the rules which have been\n\nenumerated are the Rajasthan Subordinate Services (Recruitment and other Service\n\nConditions) Rules 19607. Any general order or amendment in the 1960 Rules is\n\nmade applicable, mutatis mutandis. Besides this, entry 7 refers to other rules\n\nprescribing general conditions of service made under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution,\n\nfor the time being in force. The opening words of Rule 347-A make the applicability\n\nof the enumerated rules subject to a provision specifically contained in the 1960\n\nRules. On the other hand, Rule 347-B contains an overriding provision under which\n\nnotwithstanding anything contained in the 1957 Rules, conditions of service would\n\nbe governed by certain enumerated rules. Among them are the Rajasthan Services\n\n(Recruitment by promotion against vacancies of earlier years) Rules 19728.\n\n11 A significant distinction which must be noticed between Rule 347-A and Rule\n\n347-B, lies in their prefatory words. Rule 347-A begins with the expression “except\n\nas otherwise provided in these rules”. Rule 347-B commences with the expression\n\n“notwithstanding anything contained in these rules”. The significance of this\n\ndifference in terminology lies in the fact that the rules enumerated in Rule 347-A will\n\ngovern the conditions of service unless a specific provision on the subject is\n\ncontained in the 1960 Rules. On the other hand, the rules which have been\n“1960 Rules”\n“1972 Rules”\nenumerated in Rule 347-B will govern the service conditions irrespective of what is\n\ncontained in the other provisions of the 1957 Rules. To put it differently, the rules\n\nwhich are enumerated in Rule 347-A of the 1957 Rules are made subservient to\n\nprovisions contained in the 1960 Rules. On the other hand, the rules referred to in\n\nRule 347-B of the 1957 Rules have an overriding effect over any other provision\n\ncontained in the 1957 Rules. This is the plain consequence which ensues from the\n\nuse of the expression “except as otherwise provided in these rules” in Rule 347-A as\n\ndistinguished from the expression “notwithstanding anything contained in these\n\nrules” in Rule 347-B. The former is an indication of subservience. The latter is an\n\nindication of overriding effect.\n\n12 Now, it is necessary to analyse the rules adverted to in entries 7 and 8 of Rule\n\n347-A of the 1957 Rules.\n\n13 The 1960 Rules were made to govern the recruitment and other conditions of\n\nservice of persons appointed to the subordinate service in various departments of\n\nthe State other than posts regarding which separate service rules had been or would\n\nbe promulgated. Rule 9 provided for a year-wise determination of vacancies on 1\n\nApril of each year by the appointing authorities. Rule 9 of the 1960 Rules stipulated\n\nthus:\n\n\"9. Determination of Vacancies: - (1) (a) Subject to the\nprovisions of these Rules, the Appointing Authority shall\ndetermine on 1st April every year, the actual number of\nvacancies occurring during the financial year.\n\n(b) Where a post is to be filled in by a single method as\nprescribed in the rule or schedule, the vacancies so\ndetermined shall be filled in by that method.\n\n(c) Where a post is to be filled in by more than one method as\nprescribed in the Rules or Schedule, the apportionment of\nvacancies, determined under clause (a) above, to each such\nmethod shall be done maintaining the prescribed proportion\nfor the overall number of posts already filled in. If any fraction\nof vacancies is left over, after apportionment of the vacancies\nin the manner prescribed above, the same shall be\napportioned to the quota of various methods prescribed in a\ncontinuous cyclic order giving precedence to the promotion\nquota.\n\n(2) The Appointing Authority shall also determine the\nvacancies of earlier years yearwise which were required to be\nfilled in by promotion, if such vacancies were not determined\nand filled earlier in the year in which they were required to be\nfilled in.”\n\n14 On 2 March 2001, the Rajasthan Subordinate Services (Recruitment and\n\nOther Service Conditions) Rules 20019 were notified under the proviso of\nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution. Rule 13 of the 2001 Rules requires the appointing authority to\n\ndetermine the vacancies actually occurring on 1 April of every financial year:\n\n\"13. Determination of vacancies: -\n\n(1) Subject to the Provisions of these rules, the Appointing\nAuthority shall determine on 1st April every year, the actual\nnumber of vacancies occurring during the financial year.\n(2) Where a post is to be filled in by a single method as\nprescribed in the Rule or Schedule, the vacancies so\ndetermined shall be filled in by that method.\n(3) Where a post is to be filled in by more than one method as\nprescribed in Rules or Schedule, the apportionment of\nvacancies, determined under sub-rule (1) above, to each\nsuch method shall be done maintaining the prescribed\nproportion for the overall number of post(s) already filled in. If\nany fraction of vacancies is left over, after apportionment of\nthe vacancies in the manner prescribed above, the same\n“2001 Rules”\nshall be apportioned to the quota of various methods\nprescribed in a continuous cyclic order giving precedence to\nthe promotion quota.\n\n(4) The Appointing Authority shall also determine the\nvacancies of earlier years year wise which were required to\nbe filled in by promotion, if such vacancies were not\ndetermined and filled earlier in the year in which they were\nrequired to be filled in.”\n\nRule 9(1)(c) of the 1960 Rules and Rule 13 of the 2001 Rules require vacancies to\n\nbe apportioned between each method of promotion. Rule 9(2) of the former and\n\nRule 13(4) of the latter requires the determination of vacancies of earlier years which\n\nwere required to be, but were not filled in by promotion, in the year in which the\n\nvacancies should have been filled in.\n\nRule 35 speaks of the eligibility, criteria and procedure for promotion. Rule 35,\n\ninsofar as is material, reads thus:\n\n\"35. Eligibility, Criteria and Procedure for Promotion: -\n\n(1) As soon as the Appointing Authority determined the\nnumber of vacancies under rule 13 of these rules and decides\nthat a certain number of post(s) are required to be filled in by\npromotion, it shall subject to provisions of sub-rule (4),\nprepare a correct and complete list of the senior most\npersons who are eligible and qualified under these rules for\npromotions to the class of post(s) concerned.\n\n(2) the persons enumerated in Column 6 of Schedule shall be\neligible for promotion to posts specified against them in\nColumn 4 subject to their possessing minimum qualification\nand experience on the first day of the month of April of the\nyear of selection as specified in Column 7.\n\n…\n(6) If any subsequent year, after promulgation of these\nrules vacancies relating to any earlier year are\ndetermined under rule 14 which were required to be filled\nby promotion, the Committee shall consider the cases of\nall such persons who would have been eligible in the\nyear to which the vacancies relating irrespective of the\nyear in which the meeting of the Committee is held and\nsuch promotions shall be governed by the criteria and\nprocedure for promotion as was applicable in the\nparticular year to which the vacancies relate and the\nService/Experience of an incumbent who has been so\npromoted, for promotion to higher post for any period\nduring which he/she has not actually performed the\nduties of the post to which he/she would have been\npromoted, shall be counted. The pay of a person who has\nbeen so promoted shall be refixed at the pay which\nhe/she would have derived at the time of his/her\npromotion but no arrears of pay shall be allowed to\nhim/her...\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nUnder Rule 13 of the 2001 Rules, the appointing authority must determine the actual\n\nnumber of vacancies occurring during the financial year on the first day of April of\n\neach year. When a post is filled in by more than one method, the vacancies have to\n\nbe apportioned, to every such method by maintaining the prescribed proportion.\n\nVacancies which were required to be filled in by promotion in earlier years, but which\n\nwere not determined and filled in earlier are similarly required to be determined.\n\nUnder Rule 35(2), eligibility for promotion is defined with reference to the possession\n\nof minimum qualifications and experience on the first day of April of the year of\n\nselection. Under sub-rule (6) of Rule 35, where vacancies of an earlier year are\n\ndetermined as being required to be filled by promotion, the committee is under a\n\nmandate to consider all such persons who would have been eligible in the year to\n\nwhich the vacancies relate, irrespective of the year in which the meeting is held. The\n\ncriteria and procedure for promotion would be governed by what is applicable to the\nyear to which the vacancy related. Significantly, the service or experience of a\n\nperson who has been promoted shall be counted for promotion to a higher post for\n\nany period during which the candidate has not actually performed the duties of the\n\npost. While the pay of a person promoted would be re-fixed, no arrears of pay are\n\nrequired to be given.\n\n15 Rule 347-B of the 1957 Rules contains a reference to the 1972 Rules. The\n\n1972 Rules comprised of six rules, which are extracted below:\n\n\"1. Short title and commencement\n(1) These rules may be called the Rajasthan Services\n(Recruitment by Promotion against Vacancies of earlier\nyears) Rules, 1972.\n\n(2) They shall come into force at once.\n\n2. Where a service rule, regulating recruitment and condition\nof service made under the proviso to Article 309 of the\nConstitution of India, provides for recruitment by both direct\nrecruitment and promotion and where promotion quota of any\nearlier year could not be filled up in the absence of\nrecommendations of the Departmental Promotion Committee\nappointed under the rule pertaining to the Service the\nappointing authority shall determine the number of vacancies\nwhich were required to be filled up by promotion specifying\nthe year with reference to which the vacancies are to be filled\nup.\n\n3. The Departmental Promotion Committee, appointed under\nthe service rules referred to in rule 2 shall make their\nrecommendation within a period of three months from the\ndate the competent authority makes the determination of the\nnumber of vacancies and specifies the year of vacancies of\nearlier years under the said rule whereupon the appointing\nauthority shall giving due regard to the recommendations of\nthe Departmental Promotion Committee, make the\nappointments by promotion in the promotion quota vacancies\nrelevant to the year specified under rule 2.\n\n4. When the appointing authority make appointments by\npromotion under rule 3, it shall specify the year in which such\npromotion shall be deemed to have been made.\n5. Where any vacancy existed in the promotion quota in a\nyear earlier than that in which an appointment by promotion\nwas made on the recommendation of the Departmental\nPromotion Committee the appointing authorities shall modify\nthe appointment order by specifying the year in which such\npromotion shall be deemed to have been made.\n\n6. Where any appointment by promotion has been made\nunder rule 3 or where the appointing authority has specified\nthe year of promotion under rule 5, the person who has been\nso promoted shall not be entitled to claim any arrears of pay\nfor any period during which he has not actually performed the\nduties of the post to which he has been promoted.”\n\nRule 2 contemplates a situation in which the service rules framed under the proviso\n\nto\nArticle 309\nfor regulating recruitment and conditions of service provide for both\n\ndirect recruitment and promotion. Where the promotional quota of any earlier year is\n\nnot filled in the absence of a recommendation of the Departmental Promotion\n\nCommittee10, the appointing authority has to determine the vacancies which were\n\nrequired to be filled up by promotion. Thereupon, the DPC has to make its\n\nrecommendation within three months of the determination by the competent\n\nauthority specifying the number and the year of vacancies. The appointing authority\n\nis then required to make appointments by promotion in the promotion quota\n\nvacancies relevant to the year specified in Rule 2. While making an appointment\n\nunder Rule 3 by promotion, the appointing authority has to specify the year in which\n\nthe promotion shall be deemed to have been made. Consequently, where a vacancy\n\nexisted in the promotion quota in an earlier year, prior to the year in which the\n\nappointment by promotion is made, the appointing authority has to specify the year\n\nin which the promotion shall be deemed to have been made. However, in such a\n“DPC”\ncase, no arrears of pay for the period during which the appointed candidate has not\n\nworked are payable.\n\n16 In order to complete the narration of the relevant provisions, a reference is\n\nnecessary to Rule 171-A of the 1957 Rules which deals with seniority. Rule 171-A,\n\nread as follows insofar as is material prior to its amendment:\n\n“171-A. Seniority. - (1) The seniority of Inspectors, Land\nRecord working in the various districts will be interlaced by\nthe Board of Revenue and the Secretary (Land Records)\nRevenue Board will maintain an up-to-date list of seniority of\nthe Inspectors, Land Records working in the Department.\n\n(2) The seniority of the Inspector, Land Records will be\ndetermined from the date of their continuous officiation on the\npost of Inspector Land Records in the Land Records\nDepartment and/or Inspector in the Settlement/Consolidation\n/Colonization Department or any other equivalent post in such\nDepartments provided such officiation was not fortuitous or ad\nhoc in nature and subject to the condition that they possess a\ndiploma of having passed the Girdawar Qanungo\nExamination:…”\n\nBy an amendment which was notified on 8 October 2014, sub-rule 2 of Rule 171-A\n\nhas been substituted to read thus:\n\n\"(2) The seniority of inspector, Land Records shall be\ndetermined on the basis of recruitment year of promotion on\nthe post of Inspector, Land Records in the Land Records\nDepartment and inspector in the Settlement Department,\nColonisation Department and Consolidation Department.\"\n17 Now, it is in this background, that it becomes necessary to advert to the area\n\nof contest, as it emerges from the rival submissions which have been urged before\n\nthis Court.\n\n18 Mr Paras Kuhad, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellants, submitted thus:\n\n(i) The judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 6 August 2018\n\ndenies to the appellants selected by the „competitive examination route‟, the\n\nbenefit of seniority on the post of LRI, based on the year of vacancy, though\n\npersons who have been promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-merit have\n\nbeen granted seniority on the basis of the year of vacancy;\n\n(ii) Though vacancies arose in years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 on the post\n\nof LRI, selections were not held in time. These vacancies were to be filled up\n\nin the proportion of 80 per cent for seniority-cum-merit and 20 per cent by\n\ncompetitive examination. The selection process for these vacancies was not\n\nheld year-wise and the vacancies for all the three years were clubbed\n\ntogether. Appointment orders for the 80 per cent seniority-cum-merit\n\nvacancies were issued in 2012, while those for the 20 per cent competitive\n\nexam vacancies were issued on 31 March 2014;\n\n(iii) Originally, while drawing up the provisional list on 7 November 2013, LRIs\n\nwho were appointed by seniority-cum-merit were accorded seniority based on\nthe date of appointment as LRIs and were not allowed seniority based on the\n\nyear of vacancy;\n\n(iv) The right to seniority based on the year of vacancy flows statutorily from the\n\nprovisions of the 1972 Rules and the 2001 Rules. These rules provide for\n\n„deemed appointment‟, a „deemed date of officiation / experience‟ and for\n\npromotions that relate back to the year of vacancy;\n\n(v) The seniority-cum-merit promotees filed a petition before the Rajasthan Civil\n\nServices Appellate Tribunal11 which allowed them the benefit of seniority\n\nbased on the year of vacancy. The State of Rajasthan accepted the judgment\n\nof the Tribunal as a result of which the above promotees were, in the final list\n\nof seniority prepared in 2016, accorded seniority based on the year in which\n\nthe vacancy arose;\n\n(vi) The appellants were however denied the benefit upon which they represented\n\nto the Board on 4 September 2015, claiming parity under\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution in the computation of seniority based on the year in which their\n\nvacancies arose;\n\n(vii) The appellants were compelled to file a Writ Petition before the High Court in\n\nwhich the following issues arose for consideration:\n\n“A. Whether or not filling up of vacancies by seniority-\n\ncum-merit and competitive examination are both\nsubsets of appointment by promotion; and\n\nB. If the answer to A is in the affirmative, whether the\nappellants too are entitled to promotion from the year\nin which the vacancies arose on account of the\n“Tribunal”\ninterplay between the Rules of 1957, Rules of 2001\nand the Rules of 1972.”\n\n(viii) Appointment by competitive examination under Rule 284 is also a method of\n\npromotion. This position was accepted by the judgment of the learned Single\n\nJudge and by the Division Bench in appeal upon analysing the provisions of\n\nRule 284;\n\n(ix) On three different occasions, the Department of Personnel of the State\n\nGovernment accepted the position that selection in the case of 20 per cent of\n\nthe vacancies on the basis of a limited competitive examination is a method of\n\npromotion;\n\n(x) As to the interplay between the Rules of 1957, 1960 (as repealed and\n\nsubstituted by the 2001 Rules) and 1972, the Single Judge correctly held that\n\nthe 1957 Rules do not provide for a situation where the selections under Rule\n\n284 are not held in the year in which the vacancies arose. Rules 347-A and\n\n347-B were introduced to obviate such a situation by making the 1960 and\n\n1972 Rules applicable;\n\n(xi) The Division Bench of the High Court held that since Rule 347-B begins with\n\na non-obstante clause, the question of incorporating a principle from some\n\nother rule would not arise if on that subject a parent rule holds the field. This\n\nconclusion of the Division Bench is flawed because:\n(a) Rule 347-B brought about the incorporation of the 1972 Rules as a\n\nresult of which effect has to be given to the latter, even if there is any\n\ninconsistency with the 1957 Rules;\n\n(b) The 1957 Rules are silent on the determination of vacancies and\n\nholding of year-wise promotions;\n\n(c) The 1972 Rules introduced an obligation to determine year-wise\n\nvacancies and to hold year-wise promotions. Where the appointing\n\nauthority has failed to carry out its obligations to do so, it has to issue\n\nan order for deemed appointment from the date on which the vacancy\n\narose. The selections, when held, would be with reference to the year\n\nin which the vacancies arose; and\n\n(d) The 2001 Rules introduced a deeming fiction of service / experience\n\nfrom the date on which the vacancy arose.\n\n(xii) The 1957 Rules are silent in regard to the above conditions of service and\n\nhence, full effect has to be given to the legal fiction, as a result of Rules 347-A\n\nand 347-B. The object of the rule making authority in creating the legal fiction\n\nis to neutralize the adverse effect caused by a lapse of the government to\n\ncarry out its obligations of making year-wise determinations of vacancies and\n\nappointments;\n\n(xiii) As a result of the deeming fiction, persons promoted belatedly, are deemed to\n\nbe appointees of an earlier date, carrying experience from an earlier date. By\n\nvirtue of the fiction, such persons are deemed to be holding the post of LRI\nfrom the date on which they were entitled to hold the post in terms of the\n\naccrual of vacancy. This position has been accepted by the Tribunal and was\n\ngiven effect to by the Board;\n\n(xiv) Rule 284 provides for two streams of promotion: once promoted, promotees\n\nof both streams constitute one class. Both the Tribunal and the State\n\nGovernment found that by virtue of Rule 347-A and Rule 347-B, promotees\n\non the post of LRI are entitled to have their seniority computed and have the\n\nbenefit of seniority and experience from the date of occurrence of the\n\nvacancy. The State cannot accord differential treatment to two different\n\nstreams of promotees since this would be subversive of\nArticle 14;\n\n(xv) The amendment to Rule 171-A on 8 October 2014 is clarificatory. The\n\njudgment of the Tribunal has been acted upon and attained finality. Rule of\n\nlaw principles require that the appellants should not be denied the benefit;\n\n(xvi) The object of Rules 347-A and 347-B is to bring about a uniformity in the\n\nconditions of service for all members of the subordinate staff across the State.\n\nThe appellants cannot be denied the benefit of the 2001 Rules;\n\n(xvii) Depriving them of the benefit of the Rules of 1972 and 2001 would make the\n\nrights of the appellants dependent on the fortuitous event of the date on which\n\nthe selection process was held; and\n\n(xviii) The State cannot escape the consequence of not holding timely selections\n\nand delaying them for years on an end.\n19 Opposing the above submissions, Dr Manish Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the State of Rajasthan submitted:\n\n(i) The 1972 Rules have to be read in conjunction with the 1957 Rules. The 1972\n\nRules make a reference to a DPC. The concept of a DPC applies to\n\npromotions made on the basis of seniority-cum-merit and cannot be equated\n\nwith competitive examinations. The rights of persons who are eligible or those\n\nwho are recommended by the DPC in a particular year are crystalised. The\n\nimportance of the 1972 Rules is that the delay in convening a DPC should not\n\ndeprive persons who are otherwise eligible of their legitimate rights. In\n\ncontrast, the holding of a competitive examination is uncertain. The year of\n\nvacancies has no correlation with the competitive examination. Consequently,\n\nthe deeming fiction relatable to the year of vacancy is confined to persons\n\nwhose rights have crystalised in the year when the DPC was required to have\n\nbeen convened and will not extend to persons selected through competitive\n\nexams. Even the promotees of 2013 have been given substantive\n\nappointments from the date of appointment and not from the year of vacancy;\n\n(ii) The 2001 Rules do not apply per se for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The 2001 Rules do not expressly state that the 1960 Rules have been\n\nrepealed;\n\n(b) The 2001 Rules are not general in nature so as to fall within the\n\npurview of entry 7 of Rule 347-A. The 2001 Rules apply to services\n\nspecified in the schedule thereto and posts of Inspectors / Naib\nTehsildars / Patwaris are not part of the posts specified in the schedule.\n\nThe 2001 Rules are only meant to cover residuary cadres / services\n\nwhich are not already covered by the state / subordinate services;\n\n(c) The 1960 Rules have been repealed, and the 2001 Rules cannot be\n\ntermed as rules providing for general conditions of service;\n\n(d) The 2001 Rules do not apply to regular / state / subordinate /\n\nministerial services which are governed by their own rules. Rule 4(g) of\n\nthe repealed 1960 Rules was all encompassing and covered posts\n\nunder the Rajasthan Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)\n\nRules 195812. The CCA Rules 1958 covered all appointments in\n\nsubordinate / state services. The 2001 Rules are confined to specific\n\ncategories mentioned in the schedule; and\n\n(e) Even if the 2001 Rules apply, the scheme of those rules does not\n\ncontemplate a competitive examination as being a method of\n\npromotion. Part IV of the 2001 Rules deals with the procedure for direct\n\nrecruitment by competitive examinations, while Part V pertains to\n\npromotion. The case of the appellants will not fall within Part V. In the\n\nabsence of any statutory basis, the appellants cannot claim seniority or\n\npromotion from an anterior date. Rule 347-A is subject to the provisions\n\ncontained in the 1957 Rules and hence, if any field is occupied, the\n\nRules of 1960 and 2001 shall not apply. Rule 171-A which provided at\n“CCA Rules 1958”\nthe material time for seniority on the basis of continuous officiation held\n\nthe field.\n\n(iii) The amendment to Rule 171-A which replaced the word “continuous\n\nofficiation” with the expression “recruitment year of promotion”, was effected\n\nin October 2014, whereas the present controversy relates to 2012-13.\n\nContinuous officiation refers to a person actually working on the post and\n\ncannot incorporate the concept of a deeming experience or retrospective\n\nclaim of seniority. The State Government has treated even the promotees on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit from the date of appointment. The situation\n\nhas altered only after the amendment of Rule 171-A in October 2014;\n\n(iv) The requirement of determining year-wise vacancies does not by itself lead to\n\nthe grant of seniority from the date of vacancy. If the State ignores one source\n\nof recruitment for an unreasonable period of time or if its action is mala fide,\n\nthe court can issue a writ of mandamus to make recruitments from the\n\nignored source of recruitment. This was the situation in Jagdish Ch. Patnaik\n\nv State of Orissa13 (“Jagdish Ch. Patnaik”). In the present case, no mala\n\nfides have been urged and the State simply clubbed together vacancies for\n\nthree years to hold a competitive examination; and\n\n(v) The service jurisprudence emanating from\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution provides that seniority has to be reckoned from the date of the\n\nsubstantive appointment. However, if a statutory rule so provides, it can be\n\nreckoned from a retrospective date. Retrospective operation of seniority,\n(1998) 4 SCC 456\nhowever, has to be confined to appointment by promotion and cannot extend\n\nto competitive examinations. Candidates in competitive examinations cannot\n\nbe given seniority from a retrospective date because they are not borne on\n\nthe cadre. Candidates drawn from the source of competitive examinations are\n\nborne on the cadre from the date of substantive appointment after undergoing\n\nprobation and confirmation. In the present case, the appellants were selected\n\nby open competitive examination from Patwaris for the post of LRI. If\n\nretrospective seniority was to be given from the date on which the vacancy\n\narose, it would lead to a situation where a person who is not qualified to take\n\nthe examination on the date when the vacancy arose would get seniority. In\n\nthe present case, some persons were recruited by departmental examinations\n\nfrom the feeder cadre. The statutory rules did not envisage retrospective\n\nseniority from the date when the vacancy had arisen. The grant of seniority is\n\nnot a facet of a fundamental right. Hence, there is no violation of a\n\nfundamental right when a person who takes a competitive examination is\n\ngiven seniority from the date of substantive appointment.\n\n20 Supporting the submissions which were urged on behalf of the State of\n\nRajasthan, Mr P N Misra and Mr Manoj Swaroop, learned Senior Counsel appearing\n\non behalf of the contesting respondents submitted:\n\n(i) Recruitment under clause (i) and (ii) of Rule 284 of the 1957 Rules is from two\n\ndifferent streams: clause (i) provides for seniority-cum-merit, while clause (ii)\nprovides for a competitive departmental examination. The appellants are\n\ngoverned by Rule 284(ii) and only those amongst the serving Patwaris who\n\nqualify and meet the requirements under Rule 286 could appear for an open\n\ncompetitive examination held pursuant to Rules 286-287. After completing\n\ntheir training such persons have to undergo probation. Rule 298(iii) specifies\n\nthat persons who obtain the diploma are not immediately entitled for\n\nappointment since appointment can be granted when vacancies occur on the\n\nbasis of seniority;\n\n(ii) Rule 171-A (2) embodies the criteria of continuous officiation. The private\n\nrespondents are governed by Rule 284(i). They faced a DPC in 2012-13 and\n\nthe recruitment year for them was 1 April 2013. The private respondents are\n\nnot claiming seniority from the year of vacancy. Though for some of them the\n\nDPC was 2009-10, their date of joining as LRI was in the year 2013 as a\n\nresult of which they were given promotion only with effect from 1 April 2013;\n\n(iii) Rule 347-A of the 1957 Rules commences with the expression “except as\n\notherwise provided in these rules”. Rule 7 of the 2001 Rules provides three\n\nsources of recruitment namely - (i) direct recruitment; (ii) promotion; and (iii)\n\ntransfer. Chapter V of the 2001 Rules deals with the procedure for promotion.\n\nThe 2001 Rules provide for promotion on the basis of a DPC and do not\n\ncontemplate a selection of candidates by a limited competitive examination.\n\nThe 2001 Rules will not be applicable to LRIs appointed under the 1957 Rules\n\nand seniority has to be fixed under Rule 171-A;\n(iv) The 1972 Rules apply to promotions which are made on the recommendation\n\nof a DPC hence, if the rules are construed in their entirety, it is evident that\n\nthose rules are applicable to promotions made on the recommendation of a\n\nDPC and not to those selected on the basis of a department examination;\n\n(v) The appellants cannot claim seniority from a date on which they were not\n\nborne on the cadre. The appellants appeared in the competitive exam in 2013\n\nfor advertisements issued in 2011 and 2013. They are not entitled to claim\n\nseniority, as they seek to do, from the year of vacancy; and\n\n(vi) It is well settled that promotion takes effect from the date of promotion and not\n\nfrom the date of the occurrence of the vacancy or the creation of a post.\n\nThe above submissions have been reiterated by the other counsel. We now proceed\n\nto consider the submissions.\n\n21 Part IV of the 1957 Rules provides for a training school for Patwaris and\n\nQanungos. Among the Chapters comprised in Part IV is Chapter III which deals with\n\nadmission, training and examination of candidates to the Patwari school. Rule 284 of\n\nthe 1957 Rules contemplates selection of candidates for admission to the school\n\nfrom two sources. The first, comprised in clause (i) is the promotion of Patwaris of\n\nthe Revenue and Land Records Departments through seniority-cum-merit. The\n\nsecond source in clause (ii) is a competitive examination which is restricted to\n\nserving Patwaris of the Revenue (Land Records) Department who fulfill the\n\nconditions of eligibility in Rule 286. The quota for promotion on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit is 80 per cent, while that for candidates selected on the basis of a\n\ncompetitive examination is 20 per cent. Candidates seeking selection need to fulfill\n\nqualifications prescribed for selection in Rule 286. The requirements of eligibility\n\nmandate, among other things that the candidate must have five years‟ experience as\n\na Patwari. After completion of the training, a candidate will be granted a diploma of\n\nthe training school and a list of successful candidates is maintained in order of\n\nseniority based on the aggregate of marks obtained. The grant of a diploma does\n\nnot entitle a candidate to immediate appointment but makes the candidate eligible to\n\nbe considered as and when a vacancy arises, on the basis of seniority. On the\n\ncompletion of a probationary period of one year, the candidate is eligible for being\n\nconfirmed in terms of Rule 299.\n\n22 Rule 284 indicates that there are two sources of selection on the basis of\n\nwhich admission to the training school is made namely: (i) promotion; and (ii) a\n\ndepartmental examination for in-service Patwaris. The departmental examination is,\n\nas described in-service jurisprudence, a limited departmental examination since\n\nwithin-service candidates who are working as Patwaris with the requisite experience\n\nand who fulfill the conditions of eligibility can only be considered under Rule 284(ii)\n\nread with Rule 286. Rule 284(ii) is evidently not a source of open direct recruitment\n\nsince only in-service candidates fulfilling the conditions of eligibility can apply. The\n\nhistory of Rule 284 indicates that initially there was a 50 per cent quota in 1977 for\n\ndirect recruitment while the balance was for seniority-cum-merit. In 1981, promotion\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit was enhanced to 65 per cent, while 15 per cent\n\nwas to take place on the basis of a limited competitive examination among serving\n\nPatwaris. As a consequence, the quota for direct recruitment was reduced to 20 per\n\ncent. In 1985, the method of direct recruitment was altogether abolished resulting in\n\nan enhancement of the quota for seniority-cum-merit promotion to 80 per cent while\n\nthe balance of 20 per cent was through a limited departmental examination. This\n\nhistory clearly indicates a progressive dilution of the quota that was prescribed for\n\ndirect recruitment until it was eventually abolished altogether. In consequence,\n\nselection within the meaning of Rule 284 is governed by a promotional quota (80 per\n\ncent) based on seniority-cum-merit and a quota for candidates passing a limited\n\ndepartment examination (20 per cent) drawn from those who are serving as\n\nPatwaris.\n\n23 Now, it is in the above context, that both the Single Judge as well as Division\n\nBench in appeal came to the conclusion that the examination which is confined to\n\ncandidates drawn from the feeder category would essentially be a case of\n\naccelerated promotion. The learned Single Judge held:\n\n“…the very fact that at one stage there were three sources for\nselection / appointment, which included that direct\nrecruitment, regular promotion and accelerated promotion is\nsufficient to come to a conclusion that selection through\ncompetitive examination cannot be equated with direct\nrecruitment…”\nThe Single Judge held that the quota of 20 per cent is to be filled up by accelerated\n\npromotion and merely because a competitive examination for entry to the training\n\nschool is envisaged that does not change the status of the selection. Though, the\n\nstreams are different, essentially, the selection is by way of promotion. The Division\n\nBench accepted this analysis of the learned Single Judge, holding:\n\n“…An examination restricted only to the feeder category\nprescribed for promotion by seniority-cum-merit, would\ntherefore essentially be a case of promotion by way of\nselection or accelerated promotion as learned single judge\nhas rightly put and not direct recruitment...”\n\nThe Division Bench noticed that Rule 299 of the 1957 Rules (in the context of the\n\ncompletion of the probationary period) provides that promotees of the same year will\n\nrank senior to the direct recruits from serving Patwaris of the same year. The mere\n\nuse of the expression “direct recruitment” in Rule 299 was held not to render the\n\nsource comprehended in Rule 284(ii) as a source of direct recruitment. For the\n\npurpose of the present proceedings, we accept the correctness of this view which\n\nhas been adopted both by the Single Judge and by the Division Bench. This is also\n\nthe consistent view of the Department of Personnel of the State Government.\n\nHence, we hold that the limited departmental examination for in-service Patwaris\n\nunder Rule 284(ii) is a means of accelerated promotion. Rule 284 provides for\n\nselection by promotion through two streams: one by seniority-cum-merit and the\n\nother on the basis of a limited departmental examination for in-service Patwaris.\n24 Now it is in this context, that it become necessary to evaluate the interplay\n\nbetween the Rules of 1957 more particularly, Rules 171-A, 347-A and 347-B with\n\nthe Rules of 1960, 1972 and 2001. Rules 347-A and 347-B of the 1957 Rules were\n\nintroduced by amendment on 22 September 1977. Rule 347-A stipulates that the\n\npay, allowances, pension, leave and other conditions of service shall be regulated\n\nby the rules, as amended from time to time enumerated in the several entries which\n\nfollow. Among them are other rules for the time being in force, made under the\n\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution prescribing the general conditions of\n\nservice. Any other general order or amendment in the 1960 Rules by the\n\nDepartment of Personnel is to apply mutatis mutandis unless there is an order to the\n\ncontrary issued by the government. However, Rule 347-A indicates that the\n\nprovisions of the enumerated rules do not have overriding effect since the opening\n\nwords contain the phrase “except as otherwise provided in these rules”. Where a\n\nspecific provision is made in the 1957 Rules, that will hence prevail.\n\n25 The 1960 Rules governed the recruitment and conditions of service of\n\npersons appointed to subordinate service posts in various departments, except\n\nwhere there existed separate service rules. Rule 2 provided:\n\n“2. Scope. - These rules shall govern the recruitment and\nother conditions of service in respect of persons appointed to\nthe subordinate service posts in the various departments\nother than posts regarding which separate service rules have\nbeen promulgated or may be promulgated in future.”\nRule 9 of the 1960 Rules required the appointing authority to determine the actual\n\nnumber of vacancies occurring during the financial year, on 1 April every year.\n\nUnder Rule 9, where a post is filled up by more than one method prescribed in the\n\nrules or schedule, an apportionment of vacancies to every such method was to be\n\ndone for maintaining the required proportion. The appointing authority was also duty\n\nbound to determine the year-wise vacancies of earlier years, which were required to\n\nbe filled in by promotion, if such vacancies were not determined and filled earlier in\n\nthe year in which they were required to be filled in. Rule 9 in specific terms\n\ncontemplated a year-wise determination of vacancies, allocation of vacancies to\n\ndifferent methods of appointment and the determination of vacancies of earlier years\n\nwhich were not filled in the relevant year. However, Rule 9 did not, in express terms,\n\nprovide for deemed seniority or a deemed date of promotion.\n\n26 Rule 347-A contemplates that the conditions of service would be governed by\n\nthe provisions contained in the rules enumerated (including the 1960 Rules) unless\n\notherwise provided in the 1957 Rules. Rule 171-A was such a provision\n\ncontemplated by the opening words of Rule 347-A. Until it came to be amended in\n\nOctober 2014, Rule 171-A(2) specifically contemplated that the seniority of the LRIs\n\nwill be determined from the date of their continuous officiation on the post in the land\n\nrecords department or any other equivalent post provided that such officiation was\n\nnot fortuitous or ad hoc in nature. After the amendment, Rule 171-A contemplates\nthat the seniority of Inspectors shall be determined on the basis of the recruitment\n\nyear of promotion. The amendment took effect in October 2014.\n\n27 Mr Paras Kuhad, learned Senior Counsel is justified in his submission that the\n\n1957 Rules did not make a provision specifically for a year-wise determination of\n\nvacancies and that such a provision was embodied in the 1960 Rules. The difficulty\n\nin accepting the sequitur (as learned Counsel portrayed it) of this submission lies in\n\nthe fact that Rule 171-A(2) prior to its amendment expressly incorporated the\n\nprinciple of continuous officiation as the basis for determining seniority of LRIs. This\n\nprinciple, which is specifically embodied in Rule 171-A(2) cannot stand overridden\n\nby any provision to the contrary contained in the 1960 Rules. This is for the reason\n\nthat Rule 347-A expressly stipulates that where there is a specific provision\n\ncontained in the 1957 Rules, that provision will govern.\n\n28 On 2 March 2001, the 2001 Rules were notified under the proviso to\nArticle\nof the Constitution. Rule 2 defines the scope of the 2001 Rules:\n\n“2. Scope. - These rules shall govern the recruitment and\nother conditions of service in respect of persons appointed to\nthe subordinate service posts in the various departments\nother than post(s) regarding which separate service rules\nhave been promulgated or may be promulgated in future.”\nRule 3(h) defines the expression “member of service”:\n\n“(h). „Member of Service‟ means a person appointed in a\nsubstantive capacity to a post in the service under the\nprovisions of these rules or the rules or orders superseded by\nrule 48 and includes a probationer.”\n\nRule 6 defines the constitution of the service:\n\n“6. Constitution of Service-the Service shall consist of-\n\n(a) aII person holding substantively the post(s) or\nrecruited to the Subordinate Service post(s) specified\nin the Schedule or orders issued by the Government\nor the Appointing Authority before the\ncommencement of these rules;\n\n(b) all persons recruited to the service in accordance with\nthe provisions of these rules, except an urgent\ntemporary appointment.”\n\nRule 7 provides for the method of recruitment:\n\n“7. Method of recruitment:- (1) Subject to the provisions\nherein after contained in these rules, recruitment or\nappointment to post(s) in the service shall be made by the\nfollowing methods in the proportion as indicated in the\nSchedule:-\n\n(i) by direct recruitment in accordance with the provisions\ncontained in part-IV of these rules;\n\n(ii) by promotion in accordance with the provisions contained\nin part-V of these rules;\n\n(iii) (a) by transfer from amongst the person(s) holding\nequivalent post(s) in other Department.\n\nprovided that if the post(s) to which transfer is proposed to\nbe made within the purview of the Commission. Such\nperson should have already been approved by the\nCommission on such equivalent post.\n(b) by transfer of persons from any institution that has\nbeen taken over by the State Government with the\ncondition to suitably absorbed its staff:…”\n\nRule 7 contemplates three modes of recruitment, namely:\n\n(i) Direct recruitment in terms of Part IV;\n\n(ii) Promotion in terms of Part V; and\n\n(iii) Transfer.\n\n29 Part IV of the 2001 Rules lays down the procedure for direct recruitment from\n\nRules 22 to 33. Part V provides for the procedure for recruitment by promotion. Rule\n\n13 requires a determination of the actual number of vacancies occurring during a\n\nfinancial year as on 1 April every year. Where a post is filled in by a single method\n\nthen the vacancies as determined shall be filled in by that method. Where more than\n\none method is prescribed posts are filled by apportionment of vacancies. Rule 35\n\napplies to promotions which are carried out by a departmental promotion committee\n\nconstituted under Rule 34. Rule 35(6) requires the committee to consider the cases\n\nof persons who would have been eligible in the year to which the vacancy relates,\n\nirrespective of the year in which the meeting of the committee is held. Such\n\npromotions would be governed by the criteria and procedure applicable in the year\n\nto which the vacancy relates and the service / experience of the incumbent who is\n\npromoted shall be counted for promotion to a higher post for any period during which\n\nthe candidate has not actually performed the duties of the post. Where a limited\ncompetitive examination is being held for accelerated promotion, Rule 35 has no\n\napplication. The procedure for recruitment in Part V of the 2001 Rules does not\n\ncomprehend a situation involving a limited competitive examination for accelerated\n\npromotion. Rule 48 which is the repeal and savings provision stipulates that all rules\n\nand orders relating to matters covered by those rules and in force immediately\n\nbefore the commencement of the rules are repealed. The 2001 Rules contains a\n\nschedule and as we have seen earlier, Rule 6(a) provides that the service shall\n\nconsist of persons holding substantive posts or persons recruited to subordinate\n\nservice posts or persons specified in the schedule, besides persons recruited in\n\naccordance with the provisions of the rules.\n\n30 It is evident from Part V of the 2001 Rules more particularly, the rules\n\ngoverning promotion contained in Rules 34 and 35 that the deeming fiction\n\nenvisaged in Rule 35(6) applies to promotions made under the auspices of a DPC.\n\nIn the case of such promotions, Rule 35 mandates that the committee constituted\n\nunder Rule 34 must consider the cases of persons who were eligible in the year to\n\nwhich the vacancy relates irrespective of the year in which the meeting of the\n\ncommittee is held. The underlying rationale for Rule 35(6) is that on the\n\ndetermination of year-wise vacancies, rights are crystalised with reference to the\n\nyear in which the vacancy has arisen. Consequently, the delay on the part of the\n\nDPC in convening its meeting should not result in a prejudice to those candidates\n\nwho were eligible for promotion and ought to have been promoted but were not\nconsidered with reference to the year in which the vacancy arose. This principle in\n\nRule 35(6) is in the nature of a deeming fiction. Undoubtedly, once a deeming fiction\n\ncomes into being, full effect must be given to its ambit. Equally, a deeming fiction\n\ncan apply to the extent to which and in a situation where the law mandates that it be\n\napplied. In the present case, it is evident that the deeming fiction which applies in\n\nthe context of a DPC having been convened beyond the year in which the\n\npromotional vacancy arose has no application to candidates who are recruited on\n\nthe basis of a competitive examination for the grant of accelerated promotion. There\n\nis a fundamental reason why the deeming fiction cannot be extended to the situation\n\nimplicated in Rule 284(ii). In order to appear in the competitive examination\n\ncontemplated by Rule 284(ii), a candidate must fulfill the conditions of eligibility\n\nprescribed in Rule 286. Rule 286 stipulates that in-service Patwaris must have a\n\nminimum service of five years before they can appear at the competitive\n\nexamination under Rule 284(ii). Conferment of a deemed seniority may result in a\n\nsituation where a candidate secures seniority with effect from an anterior date on\n\nwhich he or she was neither borne on the cadre nor was qualified. Such a\n\nconsequence would be impermissible, at least in the absence of an express\n\nstatutory provision to that effect.\n\n31 A consistent line of precedent of this Court follows the principle that\n\nretrospective seniority cannot be granted to an employee from a date when the\n\nemployee was not borne on a cadre. Seniority amongst members of the same grade\nhas to be counted from the date of initial entry into the grade. This principle emerges\n\nfrom the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in\nDirect Recruit Class II\n\nEngineering Officers’ Association v State of Maharashtra14\n.\n\nThe principle was\n\nreiterated by this Court in\nState of Bihar v Akhouri Sachindra Nath15\nand\nState of\n\nUttaranchal v Dinesh Kumar Sharma16\n.\nIn Pawan Pratap Singh v Reeven\n\nSingh17, this Court revisited the precedents on the subject and observed:\n\n“45. … (i) The effective date of selection has to be understood\nin the context of the service rules under which the\nappointment is made. It may mean the date on which the\nprocess of selection starts with the issuance of advertisement\nor the factum of preparation of the select list, as the case may\nbe.\n\n(ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be\ndetermined as per the service rules. The date of entry in a\nparticular service or the date of substantive appointment is\nthe safest criterion for fixing seniority inter se between one\nofficer or the other or between one group of officers and the\nother recruited from different sources. Any departure\ntherefrom in the statutory rules, executive instructions or\notherwise must be consistent with the requirements of\nArticles\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n(iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from the\nbackdate and if it is done, it must be based on objective\nconsiderations and on a valid classification and must be\ntraceable to the statutory rules.\n\n(iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of\noccurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given\nretrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by the\nrelevant service rules. It is so because seniority cannot be\ngiven on retrospective basis when an employee has not even\nbeen borne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely\naffect the employees who have been appointed validly in the\nmeantime.”\n(1990) 2 SCC 715\n1991 Supp (1) SCC 334\n(2007) 1 SCC 683\n(2011) 3 SCC 267\nThis view has been re-affirmed by a Bench of three judges of this Court in\nP\n\nSudhakar Rao v U Govinda Rao18\n.\n\n32 During the course of the hearing, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellants placed reliance on a decision of a two judge Bench of this Court in\n\nJagdish Prasad v State of Rajasthan19 (“Jagdish Prasad”\n). The issue\nin that case\n\npertained to promotions from the post of District Transport Officer20 to the post of\n\nMotor Vehicle Inspector. Prior to April 1992, candidates were required to pass a\n\nqualifying examination for the post of DTO but by an amendment, the requirement\n\nwas deleted. Under Rule 10 of the Rajasthan Transport Service Rules 197921, the\n\nappointing authority was required to make a year-wise determination of vacancies\n\nand to make an apportionment to each method prescribed for filling up the posts. In\n\ndoing so, the authority was to determine the vacancies of earlier years which were\n\nrequired to be filled up by promotion but were not in fact filled in that year. Rule 24 of\n\nthe 1979 Rules contains sub-rule (11) which is pari materia with Rule 35(6) of the\n\n2001 Rules. Under the 1979 Rules, 50 per cent of the vacancies were allocated for\n\ndirect recruitment and 50 per cent for promotion. This Court noted that the 1979\n\nRules postulated merit to be the criteria for promotion to the higher posts. Right from\n\n1983-84 until 1993-94, no examination was conducted. Faced with the question of\n\ndelay in holding the qualifying examination, this Court observed:\n(2013) 8 SCC 693\n(2011) 7 SCC 789\n“DTO”\n“1979 Rules”\n“29. In light of this, we now come to the conduct of the\nGovernment which we cannot but help to comment upon.\n\nRight from 1983-1984 till 1993-1994 no examination has been\nconducted by the appropriate authority despite the fact that\nthey also issued notifications for holding exams on a few of\nthese occasions. If there was a representation from the\nRajasthan Transport Inspectors' Union, it cannot be\nconsidered as a sufficient cause or reason for not holding the\nexaminations for more than ten years and causing serious\nprejudice to the candidates who might have been sufficiently\nmeritorious to qualify in the exams and be considered for\npromotion to 50% of the posts under the promotion quota. It is\na matter of regret that a Government can take such a stand\nbefore a court of law and expects the Court to accept such a\nsubmission. It is ex facie untenable. Once the rules stand\nclear, the authority concerned is expected to act in\naccordance with law and not to defeat the law. One who\ndefeats the law by his unjustifiable and unsustainable acts is\nliable for the consequences of such default. We fail to\nunderstand why the Government and its entire hierarchy had\nshut its eyes to this gross violation of statutory rules over\nsuch a long period.”\n\nThe process of selection was held to be in violation of the statutory rules. In this\n\nbackground, this Court noticing the illegality in the process, issued directions for\n\nholding a fresh process of selection.\n\n33 Jagdish Prasad is a decision which has been rendered in a situation where\n\nthe 1979 Rules applicable to the Transport department contained a specific\n\nprovision for considering the case for promotion of persons who are eligible in the\n\nyear to which the vacancy relates and who could not be considered as a result of the\n\nfailure of the DPC to convene. The decision related to a situation where the State\n\nGovernment had acted arbitrarily and even mala fide in failing to hold the qualifying\nexamination for a decade on the specious ground that there was a representation\n\nfrom the union. The action of the State was held to be unsustainable because it was\n\ndesigned to defeat the law. This distinguishing feature is absent in the present case.\n\n34 In the present case, we have dealt with the issue of the applicability of the\n\n1960 Rules in the context of determining the principle of seniority. We have held that\n\nin view of the opening words of Rule 347-A, the provisions contained in the 1960\n\nRules would have to give way and be subject to Rule 171-A(2) which provided for\n\ndetermining seniority on the basis of continuous officiation. In the face of Rule 171-\n\nA(2) as it stood prior to amendment, it is not possible to apply a deemed date for\n\ndetermining seniority based on the year of vacancy. Rule 171-A(2) rules out the\n\ngrant of seniority with effect from a date anterior to the date on which the employee\n\nis borne on the cadre.\n\n35 But the submission which now needs to be analysed is whether a different\n\nresult would follow from the application of Rule 347-B of the 1957 Rules. Rule 347-\n\nB, as we have noted, is prefaced with a non-obstante provision. Consequently,\n\nconditions of service which are governed by the rules referred to in the entries of\n\nRule 347-B will govern notwithstanding anything contained in the 1957 Rules.\n\nAmong them is an entry pertaining to the 1972 Rules. Hence, it is necessary to\n\nconsider the applicability of the 1972 Rules. Rule 2 contemplates a situation where\n\nthe service rules regulating recruitment and conditions of service made under the\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution provide for recruitment by both direct\n\nrecruitment and promotion. Where the promotion quota of a previous year cannot be\n\nfilled in due to the absence of a DPC recommendation, the appointing authority is to\n\ndetermine the number of vacancies required to be filled up by promotion with\n\nreference to the year when the vacancies were required to be filled up. In such a\n\nsituation, upon a determination of the vacancies by the appointing authority, the\n\nDPC is required to convene within a stipulated period. Upon the recommendations\n\nof the DPC, the appointing authority must make appointments to promotion quota\n\nvacancies relevant to the year in question. Where a vacancy relates to a year earlier\n\nthan the year in which the appointment has been made, the order of appointment\n\nhas to be modified so as to take effect from the year in which the promotion is\n\ndeemed to have been made. A plain reading of the 1972 Rules indicates that they\n\nenvisage a situation where recruitment is made both by direct recruitment and\n\npromotion and the promotional quota is not filled up in the absence of a DPC\n\nrecommendation. On its terms, Rule 2 of the 1972 Rules has no application to a\n\nsituation such as the present which is governed by Rule 284 of the 1957 Rules.\n\nUnder Rule 284, there is no direct recruitment at all. Rule 2 of the 1972 Rules\n\napplies in a situation where a service rule regulating recruitment “provides for\n\nrecruitment by both direct recruitment and promotion”. In the present case, ex facie\n\nRule 284 of the 1957 Rules is not a provision falling in that category since there is\n\nan absence of a service rule requiring recruitment by direct recruitment and\n\npromotion. The 1972 Rules have no application. Rule 347-B of the 1957 Rules will\n\nhence not come to the aid of the appellants.\n36 The situation, as we have noted has been altered by the rule making authority\n\nwhich amended the provisions contained in Rule 171-A(2) of the 1957 Rules. As a\n\nresult of the amendment, sub-rule (2) came to be substituted with effect from 8\n\nOctober 2014. Post amendment, the seniority of LRIs has to be determined on the\n\nbasis of the recruitment year of promotion. The provision for continuous officiation as\n\nembodied in Rule 171-A(2) prior to the amendment was to the contrary. A deliberate\n\ndeparture has been made in the rules which were modified on 8 October 2014. We\n\ncannot accept the submission that the amendment was clarificatory in nature. The\n\npresent case relates to the exercise conducted prior to the amendment of Rule 171-\n\nA(2).\n\n37 For the above reasons, we are of the view that the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt was justified in coming to the conclusion, though for the reasons which we\n\nhave indicated, that the claim for seniority with reference to the date of the accrual of\n\nthe vacancy will not be maintainable merely on the ground that no competitive\n\nexamination was held in the years in which the vacancies had arisen. The view\n\ntaken by the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court is in accord with the\n\nprinciples of law enunciated in the decisions of this Court and consistent with the\n\nstatutory rules as they held the field at the material time.\n38 For the above reasons, we find no merit in the appeals. The appeals are\n\naccordingly dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Pending application(s), if\n\nany, shall stand disposed of.\n\n….…….……………………...............J.\n[Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\n\n....…….……………………...............J.\n[Indira Banerjee]\nNew Delhi;\n\nAugust 21, 2019.",
