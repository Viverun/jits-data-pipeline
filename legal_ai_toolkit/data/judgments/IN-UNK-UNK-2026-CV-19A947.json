Before dealing with the rival contentions advanced at the Bar.\nIt is apposite to quote relevant portion of language of the statutory scheme,\npolicy of Union of India Ministry of Communications & I.T., Department\nof Posts, The Central Civil Services (Tempor\n (Temporary Services) Rules, 1965,, the\nCentral Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021, judgment binding precedents\nin similar cases, in cases of pari-materia\n materia provisions passed by Hon'ble\nSupreme Court, Hon'ble High Courts, our own Hon'ble High Court Patna\nand Benches of the Central Administrative Tribunal as under:\n\n under:-.\n\n RULE OF LAW\n (A)(i) The casual labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and\n Regularization Scheme issued by Department of Posts, Govt. of India dated\n 12.04.1991 drawn in compliance of Hon'ble Supreme Court directions and\n approved by his Excellency President of India relevant portion is reproduced\n as under for appreciation of the Core issue involved in the present OA:-\n\n Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and\n Regularisation) Scheme : In compliance with the directions of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court a scheme was drawn up by this Department\n in consultation\n ation with the Ministries of Law, Finance and Personnel\n Person\n and the President has been pleased to approve the said scheme. The\n scheme is as follows :-\n\n 1. Temporary status would be conferred on all casual labourers\n in employment as on 29.11.1969 and who continue to be\n currently employed and have rendered continuous service of\n at least one year during the year during the year they must\n have been engaged for a period of 240 days (206 days in the\n case of offices observing five days week).\n\n 2. Such casual workers engaged for full working hours viz 8\n hours including ½ hour's lunch time will be paid at daily rate\n on the basis of the minimum of the pay scale for a regular\n Group 'D' official including DA, HRA with CCA.\n\n // 7 // OA/050/00638/2022\n\n 3. Benefit of increment at the same rate as applicable to a\n Group 'D' employee would be taken into account for\n calculating per month rate wages after completion of one\n year of service from the date of conferment of Temporary\n Status. Such increment will be taken into account after every\n one year of service subject to performance of duty for at\n least 240 days (206 days ys in establishments observing five\n days week) in the year.\n\n 4. Leave entitlement will be one day for every 10 days' of work\n Casual leave or any other kind of leave except maternity\n leave, will not be admissible. No encashment of leave is\n permissible on termination\n mination of services for any reason or on\n the casual labourers quitting service.\n\n 5. Maternity leave to lady full time casual lanbourers will be\n allowed as admissible to regular Group 'D' employees.\n\n 6. 50% of the service rendered under Temporary Status would\n be counted for the purpose of retirement benefits after\n regularization as a regular Group 'D'. official.\n\n 7.

After rendering three years' continuous service after\n conferment of temporary status the casual labourers\n would be treated at par with temporary Group 'D'\n employees for the purposes of contribution to General\n Provident Fund. They would also further be eligible for\n the grant of Festival Advance, Flood Advance on the\n same conditions as are applicable to temporary Group\n 'D' employee provided they furnish two sureties from\n permanent Government servants of this Department.\n\n 9. Their entitlement to Productivity Linked Bonus will continue\n to be at the rate applicable to casual labourers.\n\n 10. Temporary status does not debar dispensing with the service\n of the casual labourers after following the due procedure.\n\n 11. If a labourer with temporary status commits a misconduct\n and the same is proved in an enquiry after giving him\n reasonable opportunity ty his services will be dispensed with.\n\n 12. Casual labourers may be regularized in units other than\n recruiting units also subject to availability of vacancies.\n\n 13.

The engagement of the casual labourers\n labo will continue to be\n on daily rates of pay on need basis.\n\n basi\n\n 16.

No recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts except\n compassionate appointment will be done till casual\n labourers with the requisite qualification are available to fill\n up the posts in question.\n\n Further action may be taken in regard to the casual labourers by each\nunit as per the above said scheme.

The Scheme dated 12.04.1991\n 4.1991 confers temporary status on\ncasual labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989.

The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant\nof increment to a government servant on same scale of pay\n pay. The legislative\nintent is clear as noon day in formulating the sta\n statutory\n tutory scheme dated\n12.4.1991 and writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to\n // 17 // OA/050/00638/2022\n\nenforce the terms as social legislation to enhance social welfare and\nachieve social justice.

So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically provides for\nconferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering th\n three\n ree years\ncontinuous service as temporary status.\n\n19. The applicant was conferred temporary status on 29.11.1989\nand accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial\nconstruction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant after\nthree\n hree years since 29.11.1989 meaning thereby since 29.11.1992 has attained\nstatus of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly contributed to\nG.P.F.

The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory\nterms no recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual\nlabourers available to fill up the posts in question.

The\napplicant was never at fault for such lack of regularization.\n\n23. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by\napplicant in the O.A that respondents have not regularized services on\nregular post as per law on time, in spite of written requests dated\n11.10.2021 and retired on 30.09.2021 without being regularized. This\nTribunal is of the view since respondents state failed to discharge his\nstatutory duty as per the Scheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even once\nconsidered for regularization since 198\n 19822.. Hence respondents cannot take\nadvantage ooff own mistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits as not\nregularized deceased employee before retirement. The matter of right\n right, right\naccrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to applicant and he\nought to have at least considered for regularization before date of\nsuperannuation. The applicant worked since 198\n 1982 till 30.09.2021 almost\nmore than thirty seven (3\n (36)) years in the department.\n\n department\n\n24. The department\n artment of posts issued clarifications some of\nreproduced herein above enumerating advantages of temporary employee.\nSo also policy dated 30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts\nG.I. (5). Benefits of casual labourers on completion of three yyears\n ears service in\ntemporary status reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to\nthe employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken\naway by respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of\nTelecommunication & I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated\n12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of implementation results in failure of\nsocial-economic\n economic justice\n justice.. So also envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of\n // 19 // OA/050/00638/2022\n\nConstitution. These policy, scheme circulars are substantive attempts to\n ocial welfare. The respondents denied to employee accrued rights\nenhance ssocial\nand has led to him and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justice.\nHence plea taken by respondents that unless regularized no pensionry\nbenefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief\nclaimed.\n\n25. The sub-clause\n clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated\n30.11.1992 quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of\nthe postal department with effect from date of completion three years of\nservice in newly acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits\nadmissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of service\nfor purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary\nemployees appointed on regular basis while granting them pen\n pension\n sion and\nretirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n26.

The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension\n Pension Rules\n2021 as extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where\nexcludes temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension\nRules 2021 are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So\nalso the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply\nto (6) cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to\ncivil services and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before\n31st December, 2003, who retired or were retired before havi\n having\n ng been\nappointed in a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be\npayable to the government servant to the extent provided in the Central\nCivil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to\nbenefits as admissible to any other public servant and respondents have\n // 20 // OA/050/00638/2022\n\nviolated fundamental right enshrined in \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of Constitution of\nIndia.\n\n28.

The applicant stood retired on 30.09.2021 as temporary\nemployee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge\nhis duties and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965\nread with Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of\npension, family pensi\n pension\n on and retirement benefits to temporary employee.\nThe status of employee was at par with regular employee on long\ncontinuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory\nRules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy\ndecision.\n\n30. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021\nmakes it clear that applicant who stood retired before having been\nappointed in a substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type\nof category of temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension,\nretirement gratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to\napplicant same scale as admissible to permanent servant under CCS\nPension Rules to the extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:\n\n under:--\n\n (i) On retirement\n ment from service on superannuation or\n invalidation after having rendered continuous\n\n temporary/quasi permanent service of not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years\n of continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event\n ent of death while in service.\n\n31. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory\nschemes clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS\nPension Rules 2021 (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the\nmatter and in view of whereof of the affirm view that Government of India,\nDepartment of Posts instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66\n 66--\n\n9/91-SPB\n SPB-II dated 30.11.1992 and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are\nsocial legislation when read conjointly and harmoniously. The\n The Rules 1965\nand the Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status\n // 21 // OA/050/00638/2022\n\nin department of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly\nacquired temporary status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and\npensionery benef\n benefits.\n\n its. The failure on the part of respondents to implement\nRule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 is failure of social\njustice and social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is\nsubstantive attempts to enhance social welfare aand\n nd state as an ideal\nemployer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in\nPart IV of the Constitution.\n\n32. Thus respondents can not take advantages of their own wrong\nand lapses and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and\n icant entitled to receive pension as if retired from regular establishment\napplicant\nand so also held by Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgement in case\nof \nPrem Singh versus State of U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC 516\nreproduced herein above.\n\n33.

So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017\nupheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing\nrespondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under\nold pension scheme.\n\n39. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above\n above judgments observed that\nas per rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary\nbenefits on regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which\nincludes full service after regularization and 50% service rendered under\ntemporary status. On working for three years as Temporary Status treated at\npar with Group 'D' employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary\nstatus employee is not regularized having served more than 20 years, it can\nonly be due to failure of respondents depa\n department.\n\n rtment. Temporary Status\nemployee officials otherwise meeting conditions for regularization and\npensionary benefits were thus eligible for pension and retirement benefits.\nSo also this Tribunal considered order passed in identical case OA No.143\nof 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not regularized and allowed OA for\ngrant of pension. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah\n (Supra) vide order dated\n21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant entitled for pension\nand pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary Status period as\nQualifying Service and treating his superannuation on 03.11.2018,\nconsidering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service and to\nissue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\n\n40.

In the said circumstances, the combine\n combinedd\noffer made by petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as\nregularized was not accepted by the respondent\n respondent-petitioner\n petitioner for his personal\nletters, but that cannot be construed to mean that he had declined\nregularization on the post he was occupying.
