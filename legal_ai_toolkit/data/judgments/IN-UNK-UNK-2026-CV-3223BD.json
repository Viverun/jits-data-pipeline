Now, the moot question is whether in view of the\n\n involvement of the petitioner in so many cases, can he still\n\n be released on parole.\n\n 7. It is more than settled that the grant of remission\n\n or parole is not a right vested with the prisoner. It is a\n\n privilege available to the prisoner on fulfilling certain\n\n conditions. This is a discretionary power which has to be\n\n exercised by the authorities conferred with such powers\n\n under the relevant rules/regulations. The Court cannot\n\n exercise these powers, though once the powers are\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 7\n\n exercised, the Court may hold that the exercise of powers is\n\n not in accordance with rules.\n\n .\n\n \n8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered in\n\n detail the nature, object, purpose and parameters for grant\n\n of parole subject to which parole can be granted in \nAsfaq\n\n versus State of Rajasthan and others\n, (2017) 15 SCC\n\n 55, wherein it was observed as under:\n\n \"14. Furlough, on the other hand, is a brief release\n from the prison. It is conditional and is given in case\n\n of long term imprisonment. The period of sentence\n\n spent on furlough by the prisoners need not be\n undergone by him as is done in the case of parole.\n Furlough is granted as a good conduct remission.\n\n 15. A convict, literally speaking, must remain in jail\n for the period of sentence or for rest of his life in case\n\n he is a life convict. It is in this context that his release\n\n from jail for a short period has to be considered as an\n opportunity afforded to him not only to solve his\n\n personal and family problems but also to maintain his\n links with society. Convicts too must breathe fresh air\n for at least some time provided they maintain good\n conduct consistently during incarceration and show a\n tendency to reform themselves and become good\n citizens. Thus, redemption and rehabilitation of such\n prisoners for good of societies must receive due\n weightage while they are undergoing sentence of\n imprisonment.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 8\n\n 16. This Court, through various pronouncements, has\n laid down the differences between parole and\n\n .\n\n furlough, few of which are as under:\n\n (i) Both parole and furlough are conditional\n release.\n\n (ii) Parole can be granted in case of short term\n imprisonment whereas in furlough it is granted\n\n in case of long term imprisonment.\n\n (iii) Duration of parole extends to one month\n whereas in the case of furlough it extends to\n\n fourteen days maximum.\n\n (iv) Parole is granted by Divisional\n Commissioner and furlough is granted by the\n\n Deputy Inspector General of Prisons.\n\n (v) For parole, specific reason is required,\n\n whereas furlough is meant for breaking the\n monotony of imprisonment.\n\n (vi) The term of imprisonment is not included in\n\n the computation of the term of parole, whereas\n it is vice versa in furlough.\n\n (vii) Parole can be granted number of times\n whereas there is limitation in the case of\n furlough.\n\n (viii) Since furlough is not granted for any\n particular reason, it can be denied in the\n interest of the society.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 9\n\n \n{See \nState of Maharashtra and Another v. Suresh\n Pandurang Darvakar\n (2006) 4 SCC 776; and State of\n\n .\n\n \nHaryana and Others v. Mohinder Singh\n, (2000) 3\n\n SCC 394.\n\n 17. From the aforesaid discussion, it follows that\n\n amongst the various grounds on which parole can be\n granted, the most important ground, which stands\n out, is that a prisoner should be allowed to maintain\n\n family and social ties. For this purpose, he has to\n come out for some time so that he is able to maintain\n his family and social contact. This reason finds\n\n justification in one of the objectives behind sentence\n\n and punishment, namely, reformation of the convict.\n The theory of criminology, which is largely accepted,\n underlines that the main objectives which a State\n\n intends to achieve by punishing the culprit are:\n\n deterrence, prevention, retribution and reformation.\n When we recognise reformation as one of the\n\n objectives, it provides justification for letting of even\n the life convicts for short periods, on parole, in order\n\n to afford opportunities to such convicts not only to\n solve their personal and family problems but also to\n\n maintain their links with the society. Another\n objective which this theory underlines is that even\n such convicts have right to breathe fresh air, al beit\n for periods. These gestures on the part of the State,\n along with other measures, go a long way for\n redemption and rehabilitation of such prisoners. They\n are ultimately aimed for the good of the society and,\n therefore, are in public interest.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 10\n\n 18. The provisions of parole and furlough, thus,\n provide for a humanistic approach towards those\n\n .\n\n lodged in jails. Main purpose of such provisions is to\n\n afford to them an opportunity to solve their personal\n and family problems and to enable them to maintain\n\n their links with society. Even citizens of this country\n have a vested interest in preparing offenders for\n successful re-entry into society. Those who leave\n prison without strong networks of support, without\n\n employment prospects, without a fundamental\n knowledge of the communities to which they will\n return, and without resources, stand a significantly\n\n higher chance of failure. When offenders revert to\n\n criminal activity upon release, they frequently do so\n because they lack hope of merging into society as\n accepted citizens. Furloughs or parole can help\n\n prepare offenders for success.\n\n 19. Having noted the aforesaid public purpose in\n\n granting parole or furlough, ingrained in the\n\n reformation theory of sentencing, other competing\n public interest has also to be kept in mind while\n\n deciding as to whether in a particular case parole or\n furlough is to be granted or not. This public interest\n also demands that those who are habitual offenders\n and may have the tendency to commit the crime\n again after their release on parole or have the\n tendency to become threat to the law and order of\n the society, should not be released on parole. This\n aspect takes care of other objectives of sentencing,\n namely, deterrence and prevention. This side of the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 11\n\n coin is the experience that great number of crimes\n are committed by the offenders who have been put\n\n .\n\n back in the street after conviction. Therefore, while\n\n deciding as to whether a particular prisoner deserves\n to be released on parole or not, the aforesaid aspects\n\n have also to be kept in mind. To put it tersely, the\n authorities are supposed to address the question as\n to whether the convict is such a person who has the\n tendency to commit such a crime or he is showing\n\n tendency to reform himself to become a good citizen.\n\n 20. Thus, not all people in prison are appropriate for\n\n grant of furlough or parole. Obviously, society must\n\n isolate those who show patterns of preying upon\n victims. Yet administrators ought to encourage those\n offenders who demonstrate a commitment to\n\n reconcile with society and whose behaviour shows\n that aspire to live as law-abiding citizens. Thus, parole\n program should be used as a tool to shape such\n\n adjustments.\n\n 21. To sum up, in introducing penal reforms, the State\n that runs the administration on behalf of the society\n\n and for the benefit of the society at large cannot be\n unmindful of safeguarding the legitimate rights of the\n citizens in regard to their security in the matters of life\n and liberty. It is for this reason that in introducing such\n reforms, the authorities cannot be oblivious of the\n obligation to the society to render it immune from\n those who are prone to criminal tendencies and have\n proved their susceptibility to indulge in criminal\n activities by being found guilty (by a Court) of having\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 12\n\n perpetrated a criminal act. One of the discernible\n purposes of imposing the penalty of imprisonment is\n\n .\n\n to render the society immune from the criminal for a\n\n specified period. It is, therefore, understandable that\n while meting out humane treatment to the convicts,\n\n care has to be taken to ensure that kindness to the\n convicts does not result in cruelty to the society.\n Naturally enough, the authorities would be anxious to\n ensure that the convict who is released on furlough\n\n does not seize the opportunity to commit another\n crime when he is at large for the time-being under the\n furlough leave granted to him by way of a measure of\n\n penal reform.\n\n 22. Another vital aspect that needs to be discussed is\n as to whether there can be any presumption that a\n\n person who is convicted of serious or heinous crime is\n to be, ipso facto, treated as a hardened criminal.\n Hardened criminal would be a person for whom it has\n\n become a habit or way of life and such a person would\n necessarily tend to commit crimes again and again.\n\n Obviously, if a person has committed a serious\n offence for which he is convicted, but at the same\n\n time it is also found that it is the only crime he has\n committed, he cannot be categorised as a hardened\n criminal. In his case consideration should be as to\n whether he is showing the signs to reform himself and\n become a good citizen or there are circumstances\n which would indicate that he has a tendency to\n commit the crime again or that he would be a threat\n to the society. Mere nature of the offence committed\n by him should not be a factor to deny the parole\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 13\n\n outrightly. Wherever a person convicted has suffered\n incarceration for a long time, he can be granted\n\n .\n\n temporary parole, irrespective of the nature of offence\n\n for which he was sentenced. We may hasten to put a\n rider here, viz. in those cases where a person has\n\n been convicted for committing a serious office, the\n competent authority, while examining such cases, can\n be well advised to have stricter standards in mind\n while judging their cases on the parameters of god\n\n conduct, habitual offender or while judging whether\n he could be considered highly dangerous or prejudicial\n to the public peace and tranquillity etc.\n\n \n23. There can be no cavil in saying that a society that\n believes in the worth of the individuals can have the\n quality of its belief judged, at least in part, by the\n\n quality of its prisons and services and recourse made\n available to the prisoners. Being in a civilized society\n organized with law and a system as such, it is\n\n essential to ensure for every citizen a reasonably\n dignified life. If a person commits any crime, it does\n\n not mean that by committing a crime, he ceases to be\n a human being and that he can be deprived of those\n\n aspects of life which constitute human dignity. For a\n prisoner all fundamental rights are an enforceable\n reality, though restricted by the fact of imprisonment.\n {See - Sunil Batra (II) v. State (UT of Delhi) (\n1980) 3\n SCC 488 , Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India\n (\n1978) 1\n SCC 248 and Charles Sobraj v. Superintendent\n Central Jai, Tihar, New Delhi\n, (1978) 4 SCC 104.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 14\n\n 24. It is also to be kept in mind that by the time an\n application for parole is moved by a prisoner, he\n\n .\n\n would have spent some time in the jail. During this\n\n period, various reformatory methods must have been\n applied. We can take judicial note of this fact, having\n\n regard to such reformation facilities available in\n modern jails. One would know by this time as to\n whether there is a habit of relapsing into crime in\n spite of having administered correctional treatment.\n\n This habit known as \"recidivism\" reflects the fact that\n the correctional therapy has not brought in the mind\n of the criminal. It also shows that criminal is hardcore\n\n who is beyond correctional therapy. If the correctional\n\n therapy has not made in itself, in a particular case,\n such a case can be rejected on the aforesaid ground\n i.e. on its merits.\"\n\n 9. Bearing in mind the aforesaid exposition of law, it\n\n is evidently clear that even though the purpose of granting\n\n parole is ingrained in the reformatory theory of sentencing,\n\n however, the other competing public interest has also to be\n\n kept in mind while deciding as to whether in a particular\n\n case parole is to be granted or not. This public interest also\n\n demands that those who are habitual offenders and may\n\n have the tendency to commit the crime again after their\n\n release on parole or have the tendency to become threat to\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP\n\n 15\n\n the law and order of the society, should not be released on\n\n parole.\n\n .\n\n 10. The grant of parole is not a right vested with the\n\n prisoner and is rather a privilege available to the prisoner\n\n on fulfilling certain conditions and in view of the long history\n\n of cases as set out hereinabove, we really do not find any\n\n infirmity with the order passed by the respondents rejecting\n\n the claim of the petitioner for grant of parole.\n\n 11. Consequently, we find no merit in the instant\n\n writ petition and the same is accordingly dismissed, leaving\n\n the parties to bear their own costs. Pending application(s),\n\n if any, also stand disposed of.\n\n (Tarlok Singh Chauhan)\n\n Judge\n\n (Jyotsna Rewal Dua)\n Judge\n 26th June, 2020.\n\n (krt)\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP",
