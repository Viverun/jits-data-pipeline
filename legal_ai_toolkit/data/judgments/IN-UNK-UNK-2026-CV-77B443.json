The factual matrix of the prosecution case is that\n\nthe complainant C.W.1, Smt. Bhagyamma, who is mother\n\nof the deceased Divya, registered the case against the\n\naccused as per Cr.No.220/2014 for the offence punishable\n\nU/s. 498A, 306 of \nIndian Penal Code\n. After completion of\n\ninvestigation the charge sheet was filed against the\n\naccused, for the offence punishable U/s. 498A, 306 of\n\nIndian Penal Code\n. Further it is alleged that the deceased\n\nDivya was staying along with the accused after the\n 3 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nmarriage. That the accused had lost money in Travels\n\nbusiness and had made heavy loans and was not looking\n\nafter the necessities of the deceased and her son. That\n\nthe accused used to pick up quarrel with the deceased\n\nstating that just because theirs was a love marriage, his\n\nrelatives are not in touch with him and was telling the\n\ndeceased to take poison or hang herself and die. That on\n\n01.05.2014 at 10.45 to 11.00 a.m in the house of\n\naccused, the deceased had committed suicide by tying\n\nsaree to the roof angle top by hanging herself. Hence, the\n\naccused abetted the deceased to commit suicide by\n\nsubjecting her to physical and mental cruelty, instigating\n\nher to die and thereby the accused committed the offence\n\nas alleged, is the case of the prosecution.\n\n 3. As discussed herein above, on the complaint of\n\nC.W.1, Bhagyamma, the mother of the deceased, the\n\ncomplainant police registered this case and after\n\ncompletion of investigation, filed charge sheet against the\n 4 S.C.No.825/2014\n\naccused before the learned Magistrate. At the initial stage\n\nthe accused was arrested and later was released on bail.\n\n 4. In pursuance of service of summons, the accused\n\nappeared through his counsel before the learned\n\nMagistrate and got enlarged on bail. The learned\n\nMagistrate furnished copy of charge sheet to the accused\n\nand hence, the provision of \nSec.207\n of Cr.P.C. was\n\ncomplied with. As the offence charge-sheeted against the\n\naccused is exclusively triable by the sessions court, the\n\nlearned Magistrate acting under \nsection 209\n of Cr.P.C. has\n\ncommitted this case to Hon'ble Principal District and\n\nSessions Court, Bengaluru and later Hon'ble Principal\n\nDistrict and Sessions Court has sent this case to this\n\nCourt for trial and hence, the matter is taken up before\n\nthis Court accordingly for further proceedings. The\n\naccused was already on bail and later was present before\n\nthis court.\n\n 5. My predecessor had framed charges against the\n\naccused for the offence punishable under \nsection 498A\n,\n \n5\n S.C.No.825/2014\n\n306 of \nIndian Penal Code\n, on 28.11.2014, to which\n\naccused has pleaded not guilty and thereby he has\n\nclaimed to be tried of the said offences.\n\n 6. In support of the case of prosecution out of the\n\n19 witness cited in the charge sheet 10 witnesses are\n\nexamined by the prosecution, as P.W.1 to P.W.10. The\n\nprosecution has got marked 11 documents at Ex.P.1 to\n\nEx.P.11 and one Material Object was marked as M.O.No.1.\n\nAfter closing the evidence of prosecution, this Court has\n\nrecorded the statement of accused under \nsection 313\n of\n\nCr.P.C, for which the accused has denied the\n\nincriminating materials forthcoming against him in the\n\nevidence of prosecution witnesses as false. Further the\n\naccused has chosen to submit evidence on his behalf\n\nand got examined as D.W.1 and also got marked one\n\ndocument which is marked as Ex.D.1.\n\n 7. Heard the argument of the learned Public\n\nProsecutor, that in all, 10 witness have been examined\n\nand 11 exhibits marked and one material objects also\n 6 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nmarked. That the portion of P.W.1 will count for 304B,\n\nthat there is injury on the neck of the victim. That the\n\nvictim had problem. The sequence of eivdence, changing\n\nof residence, not able to work, so demanded dowry shows\n\nthe act of the accused. That P.W.1 is the mother of\n\nC.W.11 and 12. P.W.1 has mentioned that her daughter\n\nwas not taken care of. That women is mother of house,\n\nshe has to be taken care of. That the case against the\n\naccused is proved beyond reasonable doubt and hence,\n\nthe accused be convicted for the offences charged is the\n\nargument of the Learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n 8. Heard the argument of the defence counsel,\n\nSri.N.Prashant, Advocate, who has vehemently argued\n\nthat C.W.4 turned hostile, C.W.10, 8, 5, 11, 12, 16, 18 are\n\ngiven up. C.W.13 and 14 are eye witnesses. C.W.13 is\n\ngiven up and C.W.14 has turned hostile. C.W.16 is Doctor,\n\nC.W.7,8 and 9 are blood relatives. That the marriage of\n\naccused and the deceased was a love marriage. This\n\nmarriage was inter-caste marriage. That regarding loan\n\nthere is no wisper in the complaint and Investigating\n 7 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nOfficer has not made proper investigation and added\n\ntheir names. That the deposition of P.W.5 cannot be\n\ntrusted. P.W.3 is the sister. That the deceased had made\n\nloan and so the accused is innocent. Mahajar and post-\n\nmortem are not proved. That the deceased had a traveling\n\nagency. The material object is mentioned as saree but one\n\nveil is produced as M.O and if the material object is\n\nirrelevant, then conviction can not be granted. That one\n\nchild was born and now is with the accused. That if 498A\n\nof \nIPC\n is not proved then 306 of \nIPC\n cannot be said to be\n\nproved. That the ingredient of sec 306 of \nIndian Penal\n\nCode\n is not proved and prosecution has failed to prove the\n\ncase beyond all reasonable doubt. That the deposition\n\ndoes not bring in ambit of \nSection 498A\n, \n306\n of I.P.C and\n\nhence the accused be acquitted is the argument of the\n\ncounsel for the accused.\n\n 9. Perused all the oral and documentary evidence on\n\nrecord. Now the points that arise for my consideration are:\n\n 1.\n Whether the prosecution proves\n beyond all reasonable doubt that the\n accused gave physical and mental\n\n 8 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n harassment to deceased after the\n marriage and thereby the accused has\n committed the offence punishable\n u/sec. 498A of \nIPC\n?\n\n 2. Whether the prosecution further\n proves beyond all reasonable doubt that\n the deceased without bearing with the\n ill-treatment and harassment on\n 01.05.2014 in between 10.45 to 11.00\n p.m in the house of accused, had\n committed suicide by hanging to the\n roof top angle with saree and accused\n abetted the deceased to commit suicide\n and thereby the accused has committed\n the offence punishable under \nSection\n 306\n of IPC?\n\n 3. What order?\n\n 10. After hearing the arguments of both the parties\n\nand on considering all the oral and all the documentary\n\nevidence on record, my findings on the above points are as\n\nhereunder:\n\n Point No.1 : In the negative\n Point No.2 : In the negative\n Point No.3 : As per final order\n for the following:\n\n :R E A S O N S:\n\n 11. Points No.1 and 2: The points no. 1 and 2 are\n\ntaken up together as they are related to each other and to\n\n 9 S.C.No.825/2014\n\navoid repetition in the discussion. As stated herein above,\n\nit is not in dispute that the complainant C.W.1\n\nBhagyamma, is the mother of the deceased Divya and also\n\nthat accused is the husband of the deceased.\n\n 12. The offence charged against the accused is\n\nUnder \nSection 498A\n and \n306\n of Indian Penal Code.\n\nHence, unless the prosecution proves beyond all\n\nreasonable doubt that when the deceased was residing\n\nwith the accused , the accused instigated the deceased to\n\ndie and thereby the accused subjected the deceased to\n\nphysical and mental cruelty, thereafter without bearing\n\nsuch ill-treatment by the accused, the deceased\n\ncommitted suicide by tying a saree to the roof top angle,\n\nno case can be made out against the accused for the\n\noffence charged. In this background, the evidence\n\nforthcoming from the prosecution should be considered\n\nfor proving the offences charged against the accused.\n\n 13. As stated herein above, the prosecution was set\n\ninto motion against the accused on the complaint of\n\n 10 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nC.W.1, Smt.Bhagyamma, the mother of the deceased,\n\nregistered the case against the accused as per\n\nCr.No.220/2014 for the offence punishable under \nSection\n\n498A\n and \n306\n of Indian Penal Code. After completion of\n\ninvestigation the charge sheet was filed against the\n\naccused for the offence punishable under \nSection 498A\n\nand \n306\n of Indian Penal Code. Hence, the accused abetted\n\nthe deceased to commit suicide by subjecting her to\n\nphysical and mental cruelty instigating her to die and\n\nthereby the accused committed the offence as alleged, is\n\nthe case of the prosecution.\n\n 14. The legal position assigned for the offence\n\nfalling under \nSection 498A\n and \n306\n of Indian Penal Code\n\nhas to be looked into. Bearing in mind the above said\n\nlegal position, I have perused the evidence on record to\n\nfind out whether the prosecution has proved the charges\n\nleveled against the accused.\n\n 15. On going through the evidence adduced by the\n\nprosecution witness, it reveals that P.W.1 is complainant,\n\n 11 S.C.No.825/2014\n\none Smt. Bhagyamma, who is the mother of the deceased\n\ndivya. She states that C.W.9, 11 and 12 are her children.\n\nThat the deceased divya is her 6th daughter. That the\n\ndeceased and the accused are husband and wife and their\n\nmarriage was solemnized at Dharmastala, later there was\n\nreception at shivasagar hotel at double road. That they\n\nwere staying in a rented house in Girinagara. That\n\nwhenever her daughter came home, she was crying. That\n\nthe accused was forcing her to bring money from her\n\nparents house. That the witness had borrowed from her\n\nrelatives and given the accused about four and a half\n\nlakh. But even then the accused did not take care of her.\n\nLater they started to stay at vijayanagara and then at\n\nKamashipalaya and later at Dasarahalli. That later she\n\ncame to know about the death of the deceased and they\n\nwent and saw that her daughter had hanged and\n\ncommitted suicide. That she gave the complaint, which is\n\nmarked as Ex.P.1 and the witness signature is marked as\n\nEx.P.1(a). That the police had drawn the mahazar and the\n\ndead body of the deceased was sent to Victoria hospital.\n\n 12 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nThat the accused was not paying the rent of the house\n\nand also he was not doing any work.\n\n 16. During the cross-examination of P.W.1, she\n\nadmitted the suggestion that the marriage of the deceased\n\nwith the accused is an inter-caste marriage. That in there\n\nfamily there was no inter-caste marriage. This witness\n\nadmitted that there was opposition by the family members\n\nfor the inter-caste marriage. That the accused belonged\n\nto scheduled caste is admitted by the witness. That the\n\nmother of the witness by name Paapamma, was taking\n\ncare of her and was fostering her. That the deceased was\n\ntelling the matters of her life with the mother of the\n\nwitness. That the house of the deceased from Dasarahalli\n\nto her house was about 7 to 8 kilometers far. That the\n\nwitness is working as maid and earning around\n\nRs.1,500/-. That she spends the money on her daughter's\n\nand grandchildren. That she works for 2 hours in the\n\nhouse of other people. That she has taken loan from\n\nSuguna, Mahesh, Amool, Ramanna, Jagga, Ravikumar\n\nand Paapamma. That her mother had given her younger\n\n 13 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nsisiter's golden chain and ear rings to the deceased. That\n\nthe same is not mentioned in the complaint. That the\n\npeople who gave loan were calling her on phone and\n\nasking her repay the loan. That no body had given her\n\nany trouble. That she came to know about the death of\n\nthe daughter at about 10.30 a.m and at about 11.00 a.m\n\nthey came near the house of the accused. That about\n\n1.30 p.m they went to the police station and the police\n\nwrote down what she told them. That she has signed in\n\nthe complaint and that the police have not inserted\n\nanything other than she told them in the complaint. That\n\nshe did not get the complaint read out about the matter in\n\nit. That who wrote the complaint exactly is not know to\n\nher. That she has not given any complaint against this\n\naccused prior to this complaint. That the deceased has\n\nnot given any complaint against the accused to the police.\n\nThat the accused would not consume alcohol and smoke\n\nthat she would come to know. That the marriage of the\n\ndeceased and the accused was a love marriage. That the\n\nmarriage relationship between the two was not at all\n\n 14 S.C.No.825/2014\n\ncordial. That whenever she went to the house of the\n\naccused, her daughter would be sad. That there were\n\ninjuries on the body of the deceased. That there was\n\nwound on the cheek. That in order to reach the house of\n\nthe accused, she taken around one hour time. That\n\nbefore she could reach, the neighbors had already\n\ninformed the police. This witness has denied other\n\nsuggestion put to her by the defense counsel.\n\n 17. On considering the papers on record and the\n\nevidence adduced by P.W.1, it is relevant to note that as\n\nextracted from the deposition,\n\n \"ಸಸಗಸಣ, ಮಹಹಶ‍, ಅಮಸಲ, ರಮಣಣ, ಜಗಗ,\n ರವಕಸಮರ, ಪಪಮ ಮ ಇವರರದ ಸಲ ಪಡದದವ.\"\n\n Further that:\n\n \"ದದರನಲರಸವ ವಷಯಗಳನಸ ನ ನನಸ ಒದ\n ಲ\n ತಳದಸಕದರಡಲ. ಸಕಯಸ ಪನನ ಹಹಳ‍ಸತತಳ ದದರನಸ ನ\n ಯರಸ ಬರದರಸ ಅನಸ ನ ವದಸ ನನಗ ನಖರವಗ ಗದತತಲಲ.\n\n ಈ ಫಟನಗರತ ಮಸರಚ ನನಸ ಪಹಲಸರಗ ಆರದಹಪಯ\n ವರಸದದ ಯವದಹ ದದರಸ ಕದಟಟಲಲ. ನನನ ಮಗಳಸ\n ಆರದಹಪಯಸ ಅವಳಗ ಕರಸಕಸಳ ಕದಡಸತತದದ ಬಗಗ\n ಯವದಹ ದದರನಸ ನ ಪಲಹಸರಗ ಕದಟಟಲಲ.\"\n\n The reading of the complaint reveals that the\n\ncomplainant had given around four and a half lakh to the\n\n 15 S.C.No.825/2014\n\naccused and also that accused was not doing any work\n\nand deceased was working. P.W.1, being the complainant\n\nand mother of the deceased Divya, has also stated that\n\nwhenever her daughter came home, she was crying. Also\n\nthat P.W.1 had borrowed from her relatives and given the\n\naccused about four and a half lakh. That she has taken\n\nloan from Suguna, Mahesh, Amool, Ramanna, Jagga,\n\nRavikumar and Paapamma. None of these persons are\n\nmade as witness in this case to substantiate their say of\n\nP.W1. Further, there are no document to show the loan\n\ntransaction was made by her for an amount of four and a\n\nhalf lakh. Further her mother had given her younger\n\nsister's golden chain and ear rings to the deceased and\n\nthe same is not mentioned in the complaint, goes to show\n\nthat the version of this witness cannot be believed in toto\n\nunless supported by other material witness. Further the\n\nwitness during the cross-examination states that she did\n\nnot get the complaint read out from the writer and prior to\n\nthis complaint there was no other complaint registered\n\nagainst this accused by the complainant or the deceased,\n\n 16 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nalso creates doubt in the case of the prosecution. Further\n\nthere are no documents, to show the monetary\n\ntransaction between the accused and the deceased or the\n\ncomplainant and the accused, to support the case of the\n\nprosecution. The men's-rea for driving the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide has to established by the evidence of the\n\nmaterial witness and corroborated. Hence, the evidence of\n\nthe complainant has to be corroborated with the evidence\n\nof the other material witnesses to prove the charges\n\nframed against the accused and the abatement of the\n\naccused has to be proved to establish the case of the\n\nprosecution.\n\n 18. Further, the spot pancha witness is examined is\n\nP.W.8, who is C.W.3, one by name Lokesh. He worked\n\nin garage and he states that from last 20 years he is\n\nresiding at Kamakshipalya. That Kamakshipalya police\n\nhave not called him to do mahazar and no mahazar has\n\nbeen made in his presence. That he identified the\n\nsignature on the spot mahazar which is marked as Ex.P5\n\nand his signature as Ex.P5(a). That he does not know\n\n 17 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nwhat is written in panchanama and stated that 2 years\n\nago when he visited the police station he had signed. This\n\nwitness turned hostile and at this juncture the Learned\n\nPublic Prosecutor was permitted to cross-examine this\n\nwitness. This witness has denied the suggestion put to\n\nhim by the Learned Public Prosecutor. Hence the only one\n\nspot pancha witness, who was examined by the\n\nprosecution, has turned hostile and not at all supported\n\nthe case of the prosecution. This witness was not of any\n\nhelp to the prosecution.\n\n 19. Further, Inquest panchanama witnesses are\n\nPW.2, P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.7. Among them, P.W.2 is\n\nC.W.6, one by name Prabhakar, who is working as coolie.\n\nHe states that on 03.04.2014 the dead body of deceased\n\nwas kept in the Victoria Hospital mortuary, at that time\n\nthe police have taken his signature and another person\n\nhas also signed in the panchanama. That the said\n\npanchanama is marked as Ex.P.2 and the signature of the\n\nwitness is marked as Ex.P.2(a). That there was a wound\n\nnear the neck of the deceased.\n\n 18 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n 20. During the cross-examination he states that\n\nthe mother of the deceased is residing in his neighbor.\n\nThat the police have not given any written notice. That he\n\nis the native of mysore. That he works in a place called\n\nAdugodi. That he works in shifts from afternoon 2.00 to\n\nnight 10.00p.m. That he has signed the panchanama at\n\nthe time of inquest and has not read the panchanama.\n\nThat police asked him to sign on the pachanama and he\n\nhas signed. That he has not observed the jewels on the\n\nbody and does not know to which direction dead body was\n\nplaced. That the said panchanama is marked as Ex.P.2\n\nand police has taken his signature and another person.\n\nThat other than wound near the neck of the deceased, he\n\nhas not observed any other wound. That he has signed\n\nthe inquest at the time of inquest and has not read it. On\n\nconsidering the evidence of P.W.2, although the witness\n\nhas signed the inquest, he stating that he has not read it,\n\ncreates doubt on the case of the prosecution. Further,\n\nbecause the police told him to sing he has signed also\n\ncreates doubt on the case of the prosecution.\n\n 19 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n 21. Another inquest pancha is P.W.3, who is C.W 7,\n\none by name Manjula, who is sister of the deceased who\n\nhas given the statement to the thasildaar during the\n\ninquest. She states that accused is her deceased sister's\n\nhusband. That the marriage of the accused and deceased\n\ntook place at Dharmasthala on 31.05.2010 and were\n\nstaying in Girinagar. That after the marriage accused\n\nused to harass the deceased to get money from her\n\nparents house and the mother and brother of the\n\ndeceased had taken loan and given to the accused. That\n\naccused and the deceased has personally gone and\n\ncollected the amount from Suguna and her sister. That\n\naccused used to harass the deceased stating that after\n\nmarrying her he lost everything and to go and die. That\n\naccused was not going to work properly and was not\n\nproviding basic necessities to the family or paying rent\n\nand hence accused and deceased used to take loan from\n\nothers. That the deceased used to tell everything to the\n\nwitness through telephone and when deceased visited\n\n 20 S.C.No.825/2014\n\ntheir house. That on 01.05.2014 the deceased hanged\n\nherself in the house of the accused and the deceased\n\nbrother Venkatesh informed the same to the witness.\n\nThat when witness and her husband went to the place,\n\naccused was there at home and the deceased had hanged\n\nherself with a veil and the same has been told in front of\n\nThasildar.\n\n 22. During the cross-examination of P.W.3, she\n\nstates that the house of the accused is 2 to 3 kilometers\n\nfar from her house and if traveled in vehicle, one could\n\nreach the accused's house in 15 to 20 minutes. That her\n\ndeceased sister and accused were in love with each other\n\nfor 1 to 2 years and later got inter-caste marriage. That\n\nshe has not given any document related to their marriage\n\nto the I.O. That the deceased and accused stayed at\n\nrented house for about 7 months in Vijaynagar and later\n\nat Dasarahalli where the deceased committed suicide.\n\nThat the accused used to harass the deceased and there\n\nwas no complaint given against him to the police. That\n\nthe witness was working on contract basis as computer\n\n 21 S.C.No.825/2014\n\noperator and working hours was from 10.00 a.m to 5.30\n\np.m. That the accused and the deceased have made loans\n\nnearly 4 to 5 lakhs. That they might have received\n\namount of Rs.2,25,000/- from Suguna, Rs.75,000/- from\n\nAmala. That the mother of the witness and aunty has\n\ngiven gold ornaments, her grandmother has given\n\nRs.50,000/- along with one pair earrings to the deceased\n\nand the accused. That the persons who had given money\n\nused to telephone the deceased and ask for amount and\n\nthe deceased used to take time to return the said amount.\n\nThat the deceased used to discuss everything with her\n\ngrandmother. That the brother of this witness informed at\n\n11.00 a.m and she came with her husband at 11.15 to the\n\nhouse of the accused. That the police took accused and\n\nthis witness statement has been recorded at Victoria\n\nhospital. That this witness denied all other suggestions\n\nput to her by the defense counsel.\n\n 23. On considering the papers on record and the\n\nevidence adduced by P.W.3, it is relevant to note that as\n\nextracted from the deposition,\n\n 22 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n \" ಆರದಹಪ ಮತಸತ ನನನ ತರಗ ತಗದಸಕದರಡರಸವ ಸಲ\n ಅರದಜಸ 4-5 ಲಕ ಆಗರಬಹಸದಸ. ಸಸಗಸಣ ಇವಳಸ\n 2,25,000/- ಸಲ ಕದಟಟ ರಬಹಸದಸ, ಅಮಲ ಇವಳಸ\n 75,000/- ಸಲವನಸ\n ನ ಆರದಹಪಗ ಕದಟಟರಬಹಸದಸ.\n\n further that:\n\n \"ಸಲ ಕದಟಟವರಸ ದವವ ಇವಳಗ ಫಹನ‍ ಮಡ\n ಸಲವನಸ ನ ಮರಸಪವತ ಮಡಸವರತ ಕಹಳಸತತದದರಸ.\n ಸಲ ಮರಸಪವತ ಮಡದ ಕರಣದರದ ನನನ ತರಗ\n ಮನಸಸ ಗ ನದಹವಗತಸತ. ನನನ ತರಗ ಅವಳಗಹನದರದ\n ಕಷಟ ಆದರ ನನನ ಅಜಜಯ ಹತತರ ಹಹಳಸತತದದಳಸ.\n\n On considering the depositions of P.W.3, who is the\n\nsister, she states that the deceased had made loan and\n\nthe people who gave loan were asking her to repay the\n\nsame and deceased used to take time to repay. Whereas\n\nthe mother of the deceased who is P.W.1 has mentioned in\n\nher deposition that people who gave loan to deceased, no\n\nbody had given her any trouble. The deposition of the\n\nP.W.1 and P.W.3 are not same. Further, P.W.3 mentioning\n\nthat due to the reason of repayment of loan the deceased\n\nwas upset has to be considered here. Although there is\n\nloan made by and the people were telephoning the\n\ndeceased to return it, now the question is whether the\n\n 23 S.C.No.825/2014\n\naccused had abetted the same and what is the role of this\n\naccused in the abatement to commit suicide.\n\n 24. Further another inquest pancha is P.W.4, who is\n\nC.W.4, one by name Vajramuni residing at Tilaknagara.\n\nHe is the House owner, he states that the deceased and\n\nthe accused were staying as tenant in his building. That\n\nnearly one year back the police have taken the signature\n\nof his and another person on the inquest, in Victoria\n\nHospital mortuary and the said panchanama is marked as\n\nEx.P.2 and the signature of the witness is marked as\n\nEx.P.2(b). He states that there was a wound near the\n\nneck of the deceased.\n\n 25. During the cross-examination of P.W.4, he\n\nstates that he stays at Bannerghatta, SRK Garden, he\n\ngoes to work at 6.00a.m and return home at 9 or\n\n10.00p.m. That the police have not given any written\n\nnotice to attend panchanama. That he denied that police\n\nhas not done panchanama in front of him. That he was\n\ninformed that the deceased had committed suicide and he\n\n 24 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nhas signed the panchanama. This witness denied other\n\nsuggestion put to him by the defence counsel. On\n\nconsidering the depositions of this witness and the\n\ninquest, An inquest is an inquiry into the circumstances\n\nsurrounding a death. This witness was again not of much\n\nhelp to the case of the Prosecution, as nothing much\n\nincriminating was elicited by the mouth of this witness.\n\n 26. Further P.W.7, who is C.W.15, one by name\n\nGopalaswamy. He is the Retired Thasildaar who has\n\nconducted the inquest proceedings. He states that from\n\n30.09.2013, he is working as Special Thasildar, Bangalore\n\nNorth Taluk. That on 01.05.2014 he received request\n\nletter to inquest the body of the deceased Divya, W/o\n\nMahesh, from Kamakshipalya Police Station. That the\n\nrequest letter has been marked as Ex.P4 and the\n\nsignature of the witness is marked as Ex.P4(a). That he\n\nconducted the inquest at Victoria Hospital on 02.05.2014\n\nfrom 9.00 to 11.30a.m in front of witnesses Vajramuni,\n\nE.Mahesh and P.Prabhakar. That during the inquest it\n\n 25 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nwas found that there was nearly 9 inch ligature mark on\n\nthe neck of the deceased from left ear to right ear. That\n\nduring the inquest, P.W.3, Manjula has given statement to\n\nthis witness that due to the dowry harassment by the\n\naccused the deceased had committed suicide. That\n\nInquest report has been marked as Ex.P2 and signature of\n\nthe witness is marked as Ex.P2(c).\n\n 27. During the cross-examination of P.W.7, he has\n\nstated that he does not know the color of the ligature\n\nmark but the ligature mark was 1 ½ to 2 inch in width.\n\nThat during the inquest the relatives of the deceased were\n\npresent and he has not recorded the statements of other\n\nrelatives of the deceased, as there was no necessity for the\n\nsame. He stated that the head of the deceased was placed\n\ntowards the east and legs towards the west. This witness\n\nstated that he cannot mention the check-bandi of the\n\nplace of inquest. Further, that there were no other marks\n\nfound on the body and also there were no ornaments on\n\nthe body. That he conducted the inquest at Victoria\n\nhospital from 9.00 to 11.30p.m. That he does not know\n\n 26 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nwho has sent the Ex.P4, requisition letter and he has\n\nreceived Ex.P4 after signing. The witness denied the\n\nsuggestion that he has not gone to victoria hospital and\n\nconducted inquest as per Ex.P2 and denied other\n\nsuggestion put by the defense counsel. He stated that he\n\ndoes not remember which type of cloth was there on the\n\nbody of the deceased. That the deceased was of dark\n\ncomplexion and tongue was protruding out. That the\n\nphotos of the dead body was not taken because he did not\n\nfind it necessary. On considering the depositions of P.W7\n\nand the relevant papers on record, it goes to show that he\n\nis the Thashidaar, who has conducted the inquest\n\nproceeding. This witness stated that he cannot mention\n\nthe check-bandi of the place of inquest. Further, that\n\nthere were no other marks found on the body and also\n\nthere were no ornaments on the body. He stated that he\n\ndoes not remember which type of cloth was there on the\n\nbody of the deceased can be noted here. Further, it is\n\nrelevant to note that the evidence of public servants\n\ncannot be disbelieved that they are interested in the\n\n 27 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nsuccess of the prosecution. But based only on the\n\nevidence of this witness alone, the guilt of the accused\n\ncannot be concluded.\n\n28. Other witnesses are P.W.5, P.W.6. Among them, P.W.5\n\nis C.W.9, one by name Venkatesh. He is the brother of the\n\ndeceased and states that P.W.1 is his mother and P.W.8 is\n\nhis brother and accused is the husband of his deceased\n\nsister Divya. That the marriage of the accused and\n\ndeceased took place at Dharmasthala on 31.05.2010 and\n\nwere staying at Girinagar and now at Dasarahalli. That\n\naccused was not working anywhere and used to harass\n\nhis deceased sister. That accused used to send the\n\ndeceased to her parents house to get money every month.\n\nThat accused was not providing basic necessities to the\n\nfamily, paying rent. That on 01.05.2014 at 11.30 a.m\n\naccused telephoned witness and informed that deceased\n\nhanged herself. That when witness visited that house of\n\nthe accused his sister had committed suicide by hanging\n\nherself.\n\n 28 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n 29. During the cross-examination P.W5, he states\n\nthat he works at BTM Layout and his work is from\n\n9.30a.m to evening 5.30p.m. That after the marriage the\n\ndeceased and the accused were staying in Girinagar for 6\n\nmonths and 3 years at Dasarahalli. That he does not\n\nknow whether his deceased sister had filed maintenance\n\ncase against the accused. That the accused had told this\n\nwitness that he was working at Tours and Travels and\n\nearning Rs.20,000/- per month. That when he visited the\n\ndeceased house at 11.30a.m the accused was present in\n\nthe house and was talking to someone on the mobile.\n\nThat the police came and took the accused on the\n\ncomplaint of the house owner. Further that the deceased\n\nhad informed this witness about the harassment given to\n\nher and the same has been told in front of the police.\n\nThat the deceased and the accused are of different caste\n\nand this witness does not know how many years they were\n\nin love before marriage. That the accused and deceased\n\nhave visited the house of the witness nearly 20 times.\n\nFurther he denied all other suggestions put to him.\n\n 29 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n 30. On considering the papers on record and the\n\nevidence adduced by P.W.5, it is relevant to note that as\n\nextracted from the deposition,\n\n \"ಆರದಹಪಯಸ ಟದರಸ‍ ಮತಸತ ಟಟವಹವಸನಲ ಕಲಸ ಮಡಸತತದದ.\n\n ಪಹಲಸರಸ ಘಟನ ಸದಳಕಕ ಬರದಸ ಆರದಹಪಯನಸ ನ\n ಕರದಸಕದರಡಸ ಹದಹದರಸ. ಮನಯ ಮಲಹಕ\n ಪಹಲಸರಗ ದದರಸ ಕದಟಟದದ.\"\n\n Further that,\n\n \"ನನನ ತರಗ ದವವ ಚಕಕವಳಗನರದ ಅವಳ ಅಜಜಯ ಮನಯಲ\n ಬಳದದದಳಸ. ಆಕಯಸ ಎಲ ಲ ವಷಯಗಳನಸ ನ ತನನ ಅಜಜಯ\n\n ಹತತರ ಹಹಳಸತತದದಳ‍ಸ. ಅದಹ ರಹತ ಅಜಜಗದ ಸಹ ದವವಳ ಮಹಲ\n ಪಟಹತ ಇತಸತ.\"\n\n This witness stating that the deceased was close to\n\nthe grandmother and she was telling everything to her but\n\ngrandmother is not made witness by witness, creates\n\ndoubt on the case of the prosecution. Further, the\n\nevidence of this witness has to be corroborated with the\n\nevidence of other witnesses. Nothing much incriminating\n\nwas elicited by the mouth of this witness.\n\n 31. Further, P.W.6 is C.W.14, one by name\n\nRamappa. Who is the house owner and resides in\n\n 30 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nDasarahalli. He states that his house is at Dasarahalli\n\nand has given 4 houses for rent. That the accused and\n\nhis deceased wife were staying on the first floor of his\n\nbuilding for 3 to 4 months. That he does not know about\n\nthe relationship between the accused and the deceased\n\nand does not know the reason for the deceased to commit\n\nsuicide and has not given any statement in front of the\n\npolice. This witness turned hostile and at this juncture\n\nLearned Public Prosecutor was permitted to cross-\n\nexamine this witness. This witness has denied the\n\nsuggestion put to him by the Learned Public Prosecutor.\n\nOn considering the deposition of this witness and the\n\nstatement, it goes to show that he has not deposed\n\nanything as per the statement and turned hostile thereby\n\nbenefiting the accused on the other hand. Further, he\n\nbeing an independent witness and also the house owner,\n\nhas not at all supported the case of the prosecution. This\n\nwitness was not of much help to the prosecution.\n\n 32. Further, Police witnesses are P.W.9 and P.W.10.\n\nAmong them P.W.9 is C.W.17, one by name Rajanna. He\n\n 31 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nis working as Head Constable. He states that he is\n\nworking in Kamakshipalya Police station since 4 years.\n\nThat on 02.05.2014 in Kamakshipalya Crime\n\nNo.220/2014, on the order of the I.O he has taken the\n\ndead body of the deceased to Victoria hospital and got\n\ndone the post mortem and later handed over the dead\n\nbody to the brother of the deceased and collected the\n\nacknowledgment.\n\n33. During the cross-examination this witness has stated\n\nthat there was ligature mark around the neck and he does\n\nnot know the measurement of the same. Nothing much\n\nincriminating was elicited by the mouth of this witness.\n\nHence, it cannot be said that the charges framed on the\n\naccused can be proved by the evidence of this witness\n\nalone.\n\n 34. Further, the Investigating Officer is P.W.10, who\n\nis C.W.19, one by name Boraiah D.B. He states that he\n\nwas working as SI at Kamakshipalya Police Station during\n\nthe year 2014 to May 2015. That on 01.05.2014, he\n\nreceived complaint from P.W.1. That he filed registered\n\n 32 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nthe complaint\n u/s.306\n of Indian Penal Code in Crime\n\nNo.220/2014. That the said complaint is marked as\n\nEx.P1 and his signature as Ex.P1(b). FIR is at Ex.P6 and\n\nthe signature is marked as Ex.P6(a). That when he visited\n\nthe spot, P.W.1 was present there and he drew\n\npachanama in the presence of panchas which is at Ex.P5\n\nand his signature is at Ex.P5(b). That he sent requisition\n\nto the Thasildaar and the dead body was sent to victoria\n\nhospital. That later after conducting the inquest and post\n\nmortem the body was handed over to the family. The\n\nsaree used to commit suicide was red and cement colour\n\nand the same was handed over by P.W.9 and the same is\n\ninserted in P.F.No.95/2014. That the said P.F is marked\n\nas Ex.P7. That the accused was arrested on 02.05.2014\n\nand produced before the Hon'ble court. That on\n\n02.05.2014 C.W.13, 14, 8, 9, 10, 11 &12 statements were\n\nrecorded. That on 20.05.2014 P.C. 6408 brought post\n\nmortem report which is at Ex.P8 and Ex.P8(a) is witness\n\nsignature. That the saree used by the deceased Divya is\n\nmarked as M.O.1 and the marriage invitation is marked as\n\n 33 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nEx.P9, Ex.P10 & Ex.P11 are photographs. That after\n\ncompletion of the investigation he has submitted the\n\ncharge sheet.\n\n 35. During the cross-examination, P.W.10 states\n\nthat he has not taken women PC during the panchanama.\n\nBut at the time of panchanama women PC was not at that\n\nspot. That women PC by name Smt.Rekha Devi is\n\nworking in his concerned police station. That during the\n\npanchanama women constable was present. That her\n\nsignature is not taken on the panchanama and he had no\n\nhindrance to take her signature. That the said women PC\n\nis not shown as witness in the charge sheet. Witness\n\nstates that the complaint was written by the complainant.\n\nThat he did not come to know what work the deceased\n\nwas doing and he did not investigate in that regard. The\n\nwitness admitted the suggestion that in the complaint and\n\nmarriage invitation card the places shown is different. To\n\nthe suggestion put by the defence counsel witness states\n\nhe does not know whether the dates are also shown\n\ndifferent. That he has not issued any notice to Dinesh\n\n 34 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nand Lokesh before going to spot mahazar in order to do\n\nthe spot mahazar. That the witnesses were present at the\n\nspot. That he had taken the photographer to take the\n\nphotos. That he does not remember the color of the bed.\n\nThat he has called the witnesses to the station and taken\n\nthe statement and they all were called on the same day.\n\nThis witness denied other suggestions put to him. That\n\nthe deceased has used saree to commit suicide but he\n\ncannot say the measurement and he has not mentioned it.\n\nThat he cannot say who got the dead body down. The\n\nwitness admitted the suggestion that after detaching the\n\ndead body, saree was cut into two pieces and the same is\n\nproduced. That he has not mentioned the measurement of\n\nthe two pieces of the saree which was cut. That no\n\nphotographs were taken after the body was detached from\n\nthe hanging position. This witness admitted the\n\nsuggestion that the photographer is not made a witness.\n\nThe witness admitted the suggestion that as per law the\n\nphotographer has to made a witness but he was not made\n\nso. That he has mentioned that the private parts of the\n\n 35 S.C.No.825/2014\n\ndeceased were intact. That saree is usually 6 meters in\n\nlength and not 9 meters. The saree measurement is not\n\ntaken by him. This witness denied other suggestions put\n\nto him.\n\n 36. On considering the papers on record and the\n\nevidence adduced by P.W.10, it is relevant to note that as\n\nextracted from the deposition,\n\n \"ಯವ ಕರಣಕಕ ಮಮತಳಸ ತಹರಕದರಡಳಸ\n ಎರಬಸದನಸ\n ನ ತಳದಸಕದಳಸಳ ವ ಸಲಸವಗ ಮಮತಳಸ ಯವ\n ಕಲಸ ಮಡಸತತದದಳಸ ಎರದಸ ನನಸ ತಳದಸಕದಳಳಬಹಕಗತಸತ\n ಎರದರ ಸರಯಲಲ.\"\n\n \"ಪರಚನಮ ಮಡಲಸ ನನಸ ಮಹಳ ಪಹದಯನಸ ನ\n ನನನ ಜದತ ಕರದಸಕದರಡಸ ಹದಹಗರಲಲಲ. ಸದರ\n ಪರಚನಮ ಮಡಸವಗ ಮಹಳ ಪಹದ ಹಜರದದರಸ\n ಎರದರ ನಜ.\"\n\n Further that,\n\n ದ ,\n \" ಮಮತ ದವವ ಸಹರಯರದ ನಹಣ‍ಸ ಬಗದಸಕದರಡದಸ\n ಅದರ ಅಳತಯನಸ ನ ನನಸ ಹಹಳಲಸ ಆಗಸವದಲಲ ಮತಸತ\n ನ ನಮದದಸ ಮಡಲಲ ಎರದರ ಸರ.\"\n\n ಅದನಸ\n\n Further that,\n\n \"ಶವವನಸನ ನಹಣಸ ಬಗದ ಸಸತಯರದ ಸಹರಯನಸ ನ\n ದ , ಅದರ ಎರಡದ ಭಗಗಳನಸ\n ಕತತರಸ ಇಳಸದಸ ನ ಹಜರಸ\n ಮಡದವ ಎರದರ ಸರ. ಕನದನಸ ಪ ಟಕರವಗ\n ಫಹಟದಹ ನ ಸಕ ಮಡಬಹಕಗತಸತ, ಆದರ\n ತಗದವರನಸ\n\n 36 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n ಮಡಲಲ, ಅವರನಸ ನ ಸಕಯನನಗ ಮಡಲಸ ತದರದರ\n ಇರಲಲಲ ಎರದರ ಸರ.\"\n\n On considering the evidence of P.W.10, it is evident\n\nto note that, this witness being the Investigating Officer,\n\nhas not at all investigated about what work deceased was\n\ndoing, the evidence of public servants cannot be\n\ndisbelieved that they are interested in the success of the\n\nprosecution. But based only on the evidence of this\n\nwitness, the guilt of the accused persons cannot be\n\nconcluded.\n\n 37. After closing of the prosecution side witness,\n\nthe accused has entered the witness box and given his\n\nevidence. The defence witness is accused himself who is\n\nD.W.1 by name Mahesh. He states that he is working as\n\na coolie. That the deceased Divya was his wife. That their\n\nmarriage was a love marriage and inter-caste marriage\n\nand was solemnized on 30.5.2010 at Dharmastala. That\n\nthe family members of the deceased did not come to the\n\nweeding as they did not like the same. That after the\n\nmarriage he was residing at Vijayanagara. That they were\n\n 37 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nliving cordially. That the deceased was grown along with\n\nher grandmother Smt.Paapamma. That he has a boy born\n\nout of the marriage relationship. That he is earning what\n\nis sufficient to his life. That his wife had a desire to start\n\na travelling agency. That because of which even when he\n\nrejected it, she had made loan from others. That the said\n\ntraveling agency is in the name of the deceased as 'Divya\n\nTravels'. That there was no profit from the agency. The\n\npeople who had given loan were pressurizing her to return\n\nthe money, so the deceased was felling very sad. That the\n\ndeceased was mentioning that she will not be alive. That\n\nhe used to console her. That on the day of the death,\n\nthere was naming ceremony of the son of accued and he\n\nhad been to the shop to bring items. That when he came\n\nback, the door was closed and he had knocked. That on\n\nseeing from the window the deceased had hanged herself.\n\nThat he informed the brother of the deceased by name\n\nSunil. The permit of the traveling agency is marked as\n\nEx.D.1. That the reason behind her death are the people\n\nwho gave the loan and forcing her. That because he got\n\n 38 S.C.No.825/2014\n\ninter-caste marriage and he belongs to scheduled caste, a\n\nfalse complaint has been lodged on him. That his son by\n\nname Chiranjeevi, is in his care. That he is not related to\n\nthis case.\n\n 38. During the cross-examination of D.W.1 by the\n\nLearned Public Prosecutor, he states that he saw the\n\ndeceased in one wedding of his friend and then they fell in\n\nlove and later got married. That only one brother Sunil,\n\nhad come to their wedding. That the parents of the\n\ndeceased were not interested in this wedding. That he\n\nhad told about his caste. That the deceased had made\n\naround three lakh loan for the traveling agency. That\n\nthere was no profit out of it. That he was earning around\n\ntwenty thousand income. That he used to give all the\n\nmoney to the deceased. This witness admitted the\n\nsuggestion that he is not having the details of the loan\n\nmade and no documents is given. That the deceased had\n\nmade loan after the marriage with him. This witness\n\nadmitted the suggestion that if any loan is to be made,\n\ndeceased has to ask him and then do the loan. Further\n\n 39 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nadmitted that the deceased had told about the loan to the\n\naccused. That how much loan was told to him and he\n\nhad said no to it. That how much profit would be earned\n\nwas not told to me. This witness admitted the suggestion\n\nthat if how much loan is made, how much profit is\n\nreceived is not known to him. That the deceased had told\n\nhim that she will repay the loan amount and he need not\n\nworry about it. That when the people who gave the loan\n\nwere asking the repayment, they had told that they will\n\nrepay little by little. That when he would be in the house,\n\nthe people who gave loan were calling the deceased on\n\nphone and harassing her. That other then him, no one\n\nhas heard about the harassment given by the people over\n\nphone for repayment. That on the day of the incident, the\n\nnaming ceremony of his son was scheduled. That the\n\ndeceased had joy about the birth of the son. That the\n\ndeceased had no any worry about the family matters. The\n\nwitness admitted the suggestion that no witness had come\n\nto the court in order to say about the harassment given by\n\n 40 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nthe people who gave loan. This witness has denied other\n\nsuggestions put to him by the Learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n 39. On considering the deposition and the relevant\n\npapers on record of D.W.1, it goes to show that he is the\n\nhusband and accused in this case. Further that the\n\ndeceased was running a 'traveling agency' which was in\n\nher name. The document Ex.D.1 which is Permit in\n\nrespect of a contract carriage issued by the Regional\n\nTransport Authority, Bangaluru. It is in her name and is\n\nthe permit to one motor cab with 5 passengers capacity\n\nissued on 26.5.2011, about three years prior to the death\n\nof the deceased. Further, he is not having the details of\n\nthe loan made and no documents is given again raises\n\ndoubt. The prosecution was not successful to elicite\n\nanything much incriminating in the case. The fact that no\n\nperson who gave loan, is made a witness in this case\n\nraises doubt about the case of the prosecution.\n\n 40. Further the counsel for accused has produced\n\ndecisions reported in:\n\n 41 S.C.No.825/2014\n\n (a) In Crl.A.No.1567/2007 (Kantilal Martaji Pandor\nvs. State of Gujurat & Anr.\n\n \" She had decided to jump into the well\n leaving the child and accused behind,\n therefore the act of the suicide appears\n to be intentional act to get rid of the\n frequent insult, ignorance and\n exploitation.\"\n\n The Hon'ble High Court in the present\n case has already held that the appellant\n was not guilty of abetting the suicide of\n the deceased and was therefore not\n guilty of the offense under \nSec.306\n\n Indian Penal Code.\n\n This finding of the Hon'ble High Court\n was based on the evidence of the father,\n mother, sister and another relative of the\n deceased who deposed on the basis of\n inter alia.

The Ex.P.8 is the post mortem report, it is evident\n\nthat no other injuries are seen on the body of the\n\ndeceased except the ligature mark and opinion of the\n\nDoctor, in the post mortem report mentions \"Death was\n\ndue to Asphyxia as a result of hanging\". P.W.1\n\ndeposed that there were injuries on the body of the\n\ndeceased and that there was wound on the cheek. But\n\n 45 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nthe Postmortem report does not mention it . Further the\n\nin the inquest P.W.7, the Thasildaar has not told any\n\nthing in this regard. P.W.2 and P.W.4 also mentioned\n\nsame. Hence, the say of P.W.1 cannot be believed in toto.\n\nFurther, that there are not other injury marks on the\n\nbody of the deceased is taken note of which goes to show\n\nthat there were no physical harm being caused to the\n\ndeceased. So the prosecution has to prove the abatement\n\nof the accused in this case and the ill treatment meted to\n\nthe deceased by the accused. Hence, entire material of the\n\nprosecution has to be considered and to prove the charges\n\nlaid against the accused as per \nsection 498A\n and \n306\n of\n\nIndian Penal Code. Based only on the evidence of P.W.1,\n\nP.W.3, P.W.5 and P.W.8, who are family members of the\n\ndeceased, mother, sister and brothers, the conclusion\n\ncannot be drawn for the charges levied against the\n\naccused. P.W.1 deposed around four and a half lakh was\n\ngiven to the accused and that he was not doing any work\n\nand deceased was working, But the Investigating Officer,\n\nhas not shone any progress in this area during the\n\n 46 S.C.No.825/2014\n\ninvestigation and deposed the same during the cross-\n\nexamination. Further, without the documentary evidence\n\navailable about the loan transaction and nor any person\n\nwho gave loan examined by the prosecution, it creates\n\ndoubt on the case of the prosecution. P.W.8 who is the\n\nspot pancha witness, the only one spot pancha witness\n\nexamined by the prosecution has turned hostile and not\n\nat all supported the case of the prosecution. P.W.2 who is\n\nthe inquest panchanama witness, deposed that though\n\nhe as signed the panchanama, he has not read the same\n\nand police asked him to sign so he signed, this again\n\nraises doubt on the case of the prosecution. P.W.3 who is\n\nthe sister deposed that accused used to harass the\n\ndeceased and there was no complaint given against him to\n\npolice is taken note of. Further P.W.3 deposed that\n\naccused and deceased might have received an amount of\n\nRs.2,25,000/- from Suguna and Rs.75,000/- from Amala,\n\nshows that she is not sure of it. Further without any\n\ndocumentary or any witness who gave loan being\n\nexamined, it creates doubt on the case of the prosecution.\n\n 47 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nFurther, P.W.3 deposed that deceased used to discuss\n\neverything with her grandmother, and the said\n\ngrandmother not being examined, creates doubt on the\n\ncase of the prosecution. It can be noted that P.W.6, who\n\nis house owner, an independent witness, has turned\n\nhostile and deposed that he does not know about the\n\nrelationship between the accused and the deceased,\n\nfurther, he does not know the reason the deceased\n\ncommitted suicide, this also creates doubt on the version\n\nof the prosecution. P.W.10 who is the Investigating Officer,\n\nhas deposed that in the complaint and the marriage\n\ninvitation card the places show is different. P.W.1, P.W.2\n\nand P.W.5 the maternal family members of the deceased\n\ndeposed that the marriage of the deceased with the\n\naccused was arranged on 31.5.2010. But on perusal of\n\nEx.P. 9 the marriage was held on 30.5.2010 and D.W.1\n\nhas mentioned it correct. The spot mahajar witness has\n\nnot supported the case of the prosecution. It is evident to\n\nnote that the spot panchanama which is at Ex.P.5 is not\n\nsupported by the Mahazar witness. But the say of the\n\n 48 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nwitness has to be corroborated to the evidence adduced by\n\nother witness. Here in this case the prosecution was not\n\nsuccessful to establish the charges framed against the\n\naccused. The ingredient of \nsection 498A\n and \n306\n of I.P.C\n\nare not proved by the prosecution beyond all reasonable\n\ndoubt. Thus it is clear that the P.W.1, who is mother of\n\nthe deceased, only suspected about the accused that the\n\ndeceased would have committed suicide due to ill-treated\n\nby the accused. Therefore, on considering the entire\n\nevidence and papers on record, there is absolutely no\n\nmaterial against the accused to prove that the accused\n\nsubjected the deceased to any kind of ill-treatment and\n\nharassment and thereby due to any such ill-treatment\n\nand the harassment, the deceased committed suicide.\n\nHence, the question of accused abetting the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide does not arise. Moreover, prosecution is\n\nnot able to explain why pancha witness P.W.8 and\n\nindependent witness/house owner P.W.6 have turned\n\nhostile. P.W.1 being mother of the deceased, without the\n\nsupport of any evidence of independent witnesses, the\n\n 49 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nevidence of P.W.1 does not merit consideration as the\n\nP.W.6 and P.W.8 have turned hostile. There is absolutely\n\nno material forthcoming in the evidence of P.W.2, P.W.3,\n\nP.W.4 and P.W.7 to prove the inquest which is at Ex.P.2.\n\nMore over the Inquest panchanama at Ex.P.2 is not\n\nsupported by any of the independent witnesses. None of\n\nthe independent witness have given their evidence in\n\nfavour of the prosecution and in turn supported the\n\naccused to get the benefit of doubt. P.W.7 and 10 are the\n\nofficial witness and based only on the evidence of this\n\nwitness alone, charges cannot be proved.\n\n 42. Hence, from the discussion made herein above,\n\nthe Investigation Officer has not gone ahead to show what\n\nprogress was made with regard to the investigation in\n\nidentifying persons who had given the loan to the\n\ndeceased. Further he has not made the investigation\n\nabout what work the deceased was doing prior to her\n\ndeath. This raises doubt on the case of the prosecution.\n\nFurther the document Ex.D.1, which is the produced by\n\n 50 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nthe defense counsel goes to show that there was a motor\n\ncab permit availed by the deceased. But, this aspect was\n\ndropped by the Investigating Officer during the\n\ninvestigation as admitted by him during the cross-\n\nexamination. The depositions of P.W.2, 4, 6, 7, 9 do not\n\nbring out anything much incriminating against the\n\naccused. The say of the witness has to be corroborated to\n\nthe evidence adduced by other witness. Here in this case\n\nthe prosecution was not successful to establish the\n\ncharges framed against the accused under \nsection 498A\n\nand \n306\n of Indian Penal Code. Even the owner of the\n\nhouse, has turned hostile and not adduced in the favour\n\nof the prosecution. The ingredient of \nsection 498A\n and\n\n306\n of I.P.C are not proved by the prosecution beyond all\n\nreasonable doubt, that the accused abetted the\n\ncommission of suicide. The fact that the marriage of the\n\ndeceased and the accused was a result of love and was\n\ninter-caste marriage is admitted by witness and the\n\naccused. And the fact that none of the family members of\n\nthe deceased attended the wedding, shows that all was\n\n 51 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nnot right in the relationship of the deceased family and\n\nthe accused during the marriage. The independent\n\nwitnesses have turned hostile to the case of prosecution.\n\nThe inquest panchanama at Ex.P.2 and the spot mahazar\n\nat Ex.P.5 are not proved by the prosecution by\n\nexamination of the concerned witnesses. Only on the\n\nbasis of evidence of Investigating Officer, P.W.10, no case\n\ncan be made out against the accused for the offence\n\ncharged. Therefore, doubt arises regarding the case\n\nalleged against the accused. It is well settled principle of\n\nlaw that the accused is entitled to the benefit of such\n\ndoubt. Hence, the prosecution has utterly failed to prove\n\nbeyond all reasonable doubt that the accused subjected\n\nthe deceased to any physical and mental harassment or\n\ncruelty and that the accused abetted the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide. Consequently, the prosecution has failed\n\nto prove point No.1and 2, and therefore, the point No.1\n\nand 2 are answered in the Negative.\n\n 43. Point No.3: From the discussion made herein\n\nabove, it is clear that the accused deserves to be acquitted\n\n 52 S.C.No.825/2014\n\nof the offence charged against him in this case. In the\n\nresult, therefore, I proceed to pass the following:\n\n OR D E R\n\n Acting under \nSection 235(1)\n of\n Cr.P.C. the accused is hereby acquitted of\n the offences punishable under \nSection\n 498A\n and \n306\n of Indian Penal Code.\n The bail bond executed by the\n accused and the surety bond shall stand\n canceled.\n\n The property/saree at M.O.1 is\n ordered to be destroyed after expiry of\n appeal period as it is worthless.\n\n(Dictated to Stenographer directly on the computer, corrected by me and then\npronounced in open Court on this the 4th day of September, 2020)\n\n (Smt.
