He found that said deceased Keshav was cleaning\n\nthe car of its owner at about 1:00 p.m. on the ill-fated day. After cleaning\n\nthe car, he put it in reverse gear and after taking turn, the car hit the\n\nflower pots, which were kept in front of the house of the petitioner and\n\n1 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:17 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 2\n\nthose were broken.\n\nIt is further alleged that thereafter, the owner of the house\n\nknown as Kher came out of the house and took out Keshav deceased from\n\nthe car and threaten him and gave him him blows and used abusive\n\nlanguage against him. The petitioner also demanded price of the broken\n\nflower pots. It is further alleged that the petitioner caught hold of the\n\ndeceased from his hair who fell on the ground and all this was witnessed\n\nby the above said Deepak Malhotra. He tried to pacify the petitioner but\n\nthe petitioner also used bad words qua him and also threatened Deepak\n\nMalhotra .\n\nThereafter, Keshav deceased went to his room and at about\n\n3:00 p.m. it was found that he was hanging and committed suicide. On his\n\nstatement, FIR was registered.\n\nAfter completion of investigation, the challan was submitted\n\nbefore the Area Magistrate .\n\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through\n\nthe record.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the\n\npetitioner and the deceased were known to each other; as per allegations\n\nin the FIR, the deceased hit the car in the house of the petitioner, due to\n\nwhich, it caused damage to the flower pots and the petitioner demanded\n\nprice of the broken flower pots. It was tortuous act of the deceased and\n\ndue to this reason, there was an altercation between the petitioner and the\n\ninformant. There is no proximate nexus between the act of the deceased\n\nand commission of suicide and the petitioner has been falsely implicated\n\n2 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 3\n\non behalf of his neighbour Deepak Malhotra.\n\nIt has been further argued that in fact the deceased\n\ncommitted suicide due to the conduct of his owner Shri Deepak Malhotra\n\nbut in order to save his skin, the informant has projected a false story and\n\ngot lodged the FIR against the petitioner from one Mr. Bishan Kumar\n\nwho is the relative of the deceased.\n\nIt has been further argued that in fact on 17.1.2016, i.e., the\n\nill-fated day, the petitioner had gone to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib Ji, New\n\nDelhi and distributed langer to the first batch and he saw one Nepali\n\ndomestic help in front of his house in his car, who was in the process of\n\ndriving back the car in front portion of the house of the petitioner, as a\n\nresult of which, four flower pots placed outside the house were totally\n\nsmudged and the petitioner reprimanded him and went inside his house.\n\nEven the petitioner was not known about the incident.\n\nIt has been further argued that there was absolutely neither\n\nany intention nor mens rea with regard to reprimanding the deceased and\n\nfrom a bare perusal of the material available on the record, no offence is\n\nmade out with regard to abetment to suicide and there is absolutely no\n\nnexus between the acts of the petitioner and the suicide by the deceased.\n\nAccording to him, prima facie, no case is made out against the petitioner\n\nto face trial for offence under\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code.\nIn\n\nsupport of his contentions, he placed reliance on the judgments of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nMadan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat &\n\nanr\n; 2010 (\n8) SCC 628, M. Mohan v. State Tr. Dy. Supdt. Of Police\n;\n\n2011 (3) SCC 626, Ramesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh; 2001 (4)\n\n3 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 4\n\nRCR (Criminal) 537, Rajesh v.

State of Haryana and another\ndecided on\n\n22.5.2018.\n\nOn the other hand, learned State counsel has vehemently\n\ncontended that the petitioner not only reprimanded the deceased but also\n\nabused him, given blows and demanded the price of dismantled flower\n\npots and the acts, omission and commission of the petitioner amounts to\n\ninstigation.\n\nThis Court has given its thoughtful consideration to the rival\n\ncontentions.\n\nThe suicide is as old as civilization itself. It is self murder or\n\nself destruction or self killing and it is done in many ways in which life\n\nitself can be destroyed. The reasons for the same are also numberless.\n\nNow-a-days, most of unfortunate deaths of persons occur due to the\n\ntrivial matters, such as road-rage incidents, undue anguish and even street\n\nquarrels.\n\nSection 306\nof the Indian penal code penalises abetment of\n\nsuicide.\nSection 306\nprescribes punishment for \"abetment of suicide\"\n\nwhile\nsection 309\npunishes attempt to commit suicide. Abetment of\n\nattempt to commit suicide is outside the preview of\nsection 306\nand it is\n\npunishable only under 309 read with\nsection 107\nof IPC. Thus even\n\nwhere the punishment for attempt to commit suicide is not considered\n\ndesirable, its abetment is made a penal offence.\nSection 306\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code penalises abetment of suicide.\n\n4 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 5\n\nSection 306\nreads as : Abetment of suicide - If any person\n\ncommits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be\n\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term not\n\nexceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\"\n\nFor conviction under this section, the prosecution has to\n\nprove that :\n\n1. The deceased committed suicide,\n\n2. The accused instigated or abetted for committing suicide,\n\nand\n\n3. Mens-Rea of the accused.\n\nABETMENT is an offence as defined under\nsection 107\nof\n\nIndian Penal Code, 1860. Abetment in its literal sense means,\n\nthe instigation of a person to do (or not to do) an act in a certain way, or\n\naid given by some person to another either of his own accord or under the\n\nprovisions governing joint and constructive liability. Abetment involves a\n\nmental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in\n\ndoing of a thing.\n\nAbetment of suicide involves a mental process of instigating\n\na person or intentionally aiding a person in committing suicide. Without a\n\npositive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing\n\nsuicide, conviction cannot be sustained.\n\nThe intention of the legislature is very much clear that in\n\norder to convict a person under\nsection 306\nIPC, there has to be a clear\n\nmens-rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or a direct\n\nact which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that\n\n5 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 6\n\nact must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position\n\nthat he committed suicide. No straight jacket formula can be laid down to\n\nfind out as to whether in a particular case there has been instigation,\n\nwhich forced the person to commit suicide. In a particular case, there may\n\nnot be direct evidence in regard to instigation, which may have direct\n\nrelationship between\nsection 306\nand\nSection 107\n. Therefore, in such a\n\ncase, an inference has to be drawn from the circumstances and it is to be\n\ndetermined whether circumstances had been such, which in fact had\n\ncreated the situation that person committed suicide. In order to convict a\n\nperson under\nsection 306\n, IPC, there has to be a clear mens-rea to commit\n\nthe offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the\n\ndeceased to commit suicide seeing no option and this act must have been\n\nintended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed\n\nsuicide.\n\nIn the case in hand, it is undisputed that the petitioner had no\n\nprior enmity either with the deceased (who was a domestic help with\n\nDeepak Malhotra) or his master.\n\nOn a bare perusal of the material available on the record, it\n\ntranspires that it was a street quarrel between the deceased and the\n\npetitioner, which erupted due to the tortuous act of the deceased. The\n\ndeceased appeared to be a minor. Probably he was not having any driving\n\nlicence and it seems that he did not know driving. He drove the car in\n\nreverse motion which hit some part of the house of the petitioner and\n\ndismantled some flower pots belonging to the petitioner.\n\n6 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 7\n\nIt is alleged that the petitioner abused him, reprimanded him\n\nand demanded price of the dismantled flower pots.\n\nIf we go through the entire incident, then the main ingredient\n\nof the offence of abetment i.e. mens rea is missing. A person aggrieved\n\nby the tortuous act of the wrong-doer can claim and demand\n\ncompensation of the wrong done to his property. If he demands so and\n\nthe wrong door commits suicide, it does not amount to abetment to\n\nsuicide. Similarly, use of abusive language alone without any mens rea\n\ndoes not amount to abetment to suicide.\n\nIn\nP. Sreenivasulu v. State of A.P.\n; 2004 Criminal Law\n\nJournal 2718, when there was a dying declaration of the deceased that the\n\naccused abused her and she committed suicide,it has been observed in\n\npara 14 as under : -\n\n\"14. I am of the considered view that abuses cannot amount\n\nto abetment, unless something more is done in pursuance of\n\nthe said act of abuses. I am also of the consider view that the\n\npresent case does not fall under\nSection 306\n, I.P.C. as there\n\nis no abetment to commit suicide. In fact no charge has been\n\nframed and the accused was not made aware of the offence\n\nfor which he was tried. It is the duty of the Court to make the\n\naccused aware of the offence for which he is being tried, lest\n\nit may cause prejudice to the accused. If the Court below\n\nfeels that the case had been made out under\nSection 306\n,\n\nI.P.C. it ought to have framed a charge under\nSection 306\n,\n\nI.P.C. and recorded the plea of the accused and then\n\n7 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 8\n\nproceeded with further trial, instead of giving punishment\n\ndirectly for the offence under\nSection 306\n, I.P.C. More so,\n\nduring the course of 313, Cr. P. C. examination the accused\n\nwas not questioned regarding the alleged offence under\n\nSection 306\n, I.P.C. which caused prejudice to the accused. In\n\nthis case P.Ws. 1 to 3 state that it is a stove accident. The\n\ndying declaration recorded by the Magistrate shows that\n\nbecause of the abuses of the accused, she committed suicide\n\nby pouring kerosene over herself and setting fire. In fact\n\nthere is no abetment to commit suicide. I am of the\n\nconsidered opinion that uttering of abuses will not amount to\n\nprovocation to commit suicide and it does not constitute\n\nabetment. It is contended that after the police have given the\n\nrequisition to record dying declaration, the case was\n\nregistered. Hence, there is every possibility of anti-dating\n\nF.I.R. In my opinion, no offence is made out under\n\nSection 306\n, I.P.C. and there is no need to advert to\n\ninvestigation aspect, as it loses much of its importance.\n\nThe instigation is a part of abetment but instigation requires\n\nthe mental element of intention as well as mens rea.\n\nThe term instigation under\nsection 107\nIPC has been\n\nexplained in Chitresh Kumar Chopra v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi,\n\n2009(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 196 : (2009) 16 SCC 605: (2010) 3 SCC\n\n(Crl.) 367) as follows:\n\n8 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 9\n\n\"16. Speaking for the three-Judge Bench in Ramesh Kumar case\n\n[2001(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 537 : (2001) 9 SCC 618 : 2002 SCC\n\n(Cri) 1088], R.C. Lahoti, J. (as His Lordship then was) said that\n\ninstigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to\n\ndo \"an act\". To satisfy the requirement of \"instigation\", though it is\n\nnot necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what\n\nconstitutes \"instigation\" must necessarily and specifically be\n\nsuggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite\n\nthe consequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the\n\naccused had, by his acts or omission or by a continued course of\n\nconduct, created such circumstances that the deceased was left with\n\nno other option except to commit suicide, in which case, an\n\n\"instigation\" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a fit of\n\nanger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually\n\nfollow, cannot be said to be instigation.\n\n17. Thus, to constitute \"instigation\", a person who instigates\n\nanother has to provoke, incite, urge or encourage the doing of an\n\nact by the other by \"goading\" or \"urging forward\". The dictionary\n\nmeaning of the word \"goad\" is \"a thing that stimulates someone\n\ninto action; provoke to action or reaction\" (see Concise Oxford\n\nEnglish Dictionary); \"to keep irritating or annoying somebody until\n\nhe reacts\" (see Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Edn.).\"\n\nWords uttered in a fit of anger or omission without any\n\nintention cannot be termed as instigation.\n\nIn\nRajesh v. State of Haryana\n; 2019 (1) RCR (Criminal)\n\n9 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 10\n\n847, it has been observed in para 8 as under : -\n\n\"8. Conviction under\nsection 306\nIPC is not sustainable on\n\nthe allegation of harassment without there being any positive\n\naction proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the\n\naccused, which led or compelled the person to commit\n\nsuicide. In order to bring a case within the purview of\n\nsection 306\nIPC, there must be a case of suicide and in the\n\ncommission of the said offence, the person who is said to\n\nhave abetted the commission of suicide must have played an\n\nactive role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to\n\nfacilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of\n\nabetment by the person charged with the said offence must\n\nbe proved and established by the prosecution before he could\n\nbe convicted under\nsection 306\nIPC.\"\n\nIn\nGurcharan Singh v. State of Punjab\n; 2017 (1) RCR\n\n(Criminal) 118, Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed in para 28 to 30 as\n\nunder : -\n\n\"28. The pith and purport of\nSection 306\nI.P.C. has since\n\nbeen enunciated by this Court in\nRandhir Singh v. State of\n\nPunjab\n2004(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 740 : (2004)13 SCC 129,\n\nand the relevant excerpts therefrom are set out hereunder.\n\n\"12. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating\n\na person or intentionally aiding that person in doing of\n\na thing. In cases of conspiracy also it would involve\n\n10 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 11\n\nthat mental process of entering into conspiracy for the\n\ndoing of that thing. More active role which can be\n\ndescribed as instigating or aiding the doing of a thing\n\nis required before a person can be said to be abetting\n\nthe commission of offence under Section 306 I.P.C.\n\n13.\nIn\nState of W.B. v. Orilal Jaiswal\n, 1994(3) R.C.R.\n\n(Criminal) 186 : (1994) 1 SCC 73, this Court has\n\nobserved that the courts should be extremely careful\n\nin assessing the facts and circumstances of each case\n\nand the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose\n\nof finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim\n\nhad in fact induced her to end the life by committing\n\nsuicide. If it transpires to the court that a victim\n\ncommitting suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary\n\npetulance, discord and differences in domestic life\n\nquite common to the society to which the victim\n\nbelonged and such petulance, discord and\n\ndifferences were not expected to induce a similarly\n\ncircumstanced individual in a given society to commit\n\nsuicide, the conscience of the court should not be\n\nsatisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged\n\nof abetting the offence of suicide should be found\n\nguilty.\"\n\n29. Significantly, this Court underlined by referring to its\n\nearlier pronouncement in\nOrilal Jaiswal\n(supra) that courts\n\n11 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 12\n\nhave to be extremely careful in assessing the facts and\n\ncircumstances of each case to ascertain as to whether cruelty\n\nhad been meted out to the victim and that the same had\n\ninduced the person to end his/her life by committing suicide,\n\nwith the caveat that if the victim committing suicide appears\n\nto be hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and\n\ndifferences in domestic life, quite common to the society to\n\nwhich he or she belonged and such factors were not expected\n\nto induce a similarly circumstanced individual to resort to\n\nsuch step, the accused charged with abetment could not be\n\nheld guilty.\n\nThe above view was reiterated in\nAmalendu Pal\n\n@ Jhantu v. State of West Bengal\n2010(1) R.C.R.\n\n(Criminal) 643 : 2010(1) Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.)\n\n184 : (2010) 1 SCC 707.\n\n30. That the intention of the legislature is that in order to\n\nconvict a person under\nSection 306\nI.P.C., there has to be a\n\nclear mens rea to commit an offence and that there ought to\n\nbe an active or direct act leading the deceased to commit\n\nsuicide, being left with no option, had been propounded by\n\nthis Court in\nS.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan\n(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 66 : 2010(4) Recent Apex Judgments\n\n(R.A.J.) 629 : (2010) 12 SCC 190.\"\n\nSo far as the quashing of the FIR and consequential\n\nproceedings are concerned, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nState of\n\n12 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 13\n\nHaryana and others v.

Where the uncontroverted allegations made\n\nin the FIR or complaint and the evidence\n\ncollected in support of the same do not disclose\n\nthe commission of any offence and make out a\n\ncase against the accused.\n\n4. Whether, the allegations in the F.I.R. do not\n\nconstitute a cognizable offence but constitute\n\nonly a non-cognizable offence, no investigation\n\nis permitted by a police officer without an order\n\nof a Magistrate as contemplated under\nSection\n\n155 (2)\nof the Code.\n\n5. Where the allegations made in the F.I.R. or\n\ncomplaint are so absurd and inherently\n\nimprobable on the basis of which no prudent\n\nperson can ever reach a just conclusion that\n\nthere is sufficient ground for proceeding against\n\nthe accused.\n\n6. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted\n\nin any of the provisions of the Code or the\n\nconcerned Act (under which a criminal\n\n14 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 15\n\nproceeding is instituted) to the institution and\n\ncontinuance of the proceedings and/or where\n\nthere is a specific provision in the Code or the\n\nconcerned Act, providing efficacious redress for\n\nthe grievance of the aggrieved party.\n\n7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly\n\nattended with mala fide and/or where the\n\nproceeding is maliciously instituted with an\n\nulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the\n\naccused and with a view to spite him due to\n\nprivate and personal grudge.\"\n\nIn the instant case, the element of instigation is completely\n\nmissing.

He was the lawful owner of the flower pots.\n\nHe reprimanded the deceased for the loss caused by the latter's act and in\n\ncase he demanded cost of the broken flower pots, it was his right and it\n\nwill never be taken as an instigation to commit suicide. Similarly, if he\n\nhad lost his tamper on seeing damage to his property and called names to\n\ndeceased, it will not amount to instigation. Thus, FIR as well as\n\nsubsequent proceedings arising out of the FIR qua the petitioner are\n\nnothing but the abuse of the process of law and those are not tenable and\n\nliable to be quashed.\n\nConsequently, by exercising the powers under\nSection 482\nof\n\nthe Code, this Court quashes FIR No.15 dated 17.1.2016 registered at\n\nPolice Station DLF Phase-I, Gurgaon, Haryana and all the\n\n15 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\nCRM-M-8661-2016 16\n\nconsequent/subsequent proceedings qua the petitioner.\n\nThus, the present petition stands accepted accordingly.\n\n( RAJ SHEKHAR ATTRI)\nJuly 22, 2019 JUDGE\nParitosh Kumar\n\nWhether speaking/reasoned: Yes/No\nWhether Reportable: Yes/No\n\n16 of 16\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::",
