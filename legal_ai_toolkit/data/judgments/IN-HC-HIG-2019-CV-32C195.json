Since the issue involved is common, all these Petitions\n\ncan be disposed of by a common order.\n\n3. By these Petitions filed under\nArticles 226\nand\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India, the petitioners are challenging the\n\njudgment and order passed by the Presiding Officer, Labour Court\n\nNo.1, Kolhapur, dated 20th March, 2015 in Reference (IDA) No.6\n\nof 2009.\n\n4 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 5 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\n4. For convenience, the facts in Writ Petition No. 11076\n\nof 2015 are referred.\n\n5. The petitioner was working as a Core Maker from\n\n26/7/1983 with the respondents on monthly wages of Rs.3500/-.\n\nIt is petitioner's case that he was made to forcibly resign with\n\neffect from 1/12/2002. Terminal dues were calculated in wrong\n\nmanner and petitioner was illegally terminated from the services.\n\nAccording to petitioner, the said termination was effected on false\n\npretext that the Company is going to close down. The petitioner's\n\nsignature was obtained without explaining the terms, conditions\n\nand all that was written on the resignation letter. The petitioner\n\nalso disputed the calculation of the amount of gratuity. According\n\nto petitioner, 15% illegal deduction was made from the amount\n\nthat was paid to the petitioner as and by way of final settlement.\n\nThe petitioner therefore approached the Conciliation Officer under\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the said\n\nAct of 1947' for short) sometime in the year 2007. The\n\nConciliation Officer referred the dispute to the Labour Court\n\nunder\nSection 10(1)(c)\nread with\nSection 12 (5)\nand\nof the\n\n5 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 6 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\nsaid Act of 1947 for adjudication of dispute. The Labour Court by\n\nthe impugned award dated 20th March, 2015 was pleased to reject\n\nthe Reference on the ground that there is a delay of five years in\n\napproaching the authorities. The Reference is also rejected on\n\nmerits in as much as according to the Labour Court, there was a\n\nsettlement dated 12/7/2004 entered into by recognised Union\n\nunder which all the employees had received benefits towards full\n\nand final settlement of their claims.\n\n6. Learned Counsel for the petitioners firstly urged that\n\nunder\nSection 10(1)\nof the Act of 1947, an employee can\n\napproach the authorities under the Act of 1947 any time. No\n\nlimitation is stipulated. He would submit that the resignations\n\nwere obtained forcibly in the year 2002. Thereafter the settlement\n\nwhich is not binding on the petitioner was entered into by\n\nrecognised Union on 12/7/2004. According to him, the Labour\n\nCourt has wrongly considered the delay to be of five years. He\n\nsubmitted that the Labour Court has adopted a hyper technical\n\napproach while refusing to condone delay. Relying on the decision\n\nof the Apex Court in the case of\nRaghubir Singh vs. General\n\n6 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 7 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\nManager, Haryana Roadways, Hissar reported in (2014) 10\n\nSCC 301, learned Counsel would submit that the delay need not\n\ncome in the way of the employees as in any case the ultimate\n\nreliefs can be moulded suitably. He would further submit that the\n\nsettlement is not binding as the same is not in accordance with\n\nlaw. Learned Counsel, relying upon the judgment and order of the\n\nIndustrial Court in respect of similar situate employees, would\n\ncontend that the Labour Court having allowed the claim of similar\n\nsituate employees in Reference (IDA) Nos.89 to 95, 97 to 122, 146\n\nand 148 of 2003, even these applications deserve to be allowed.\n\n7. In the course of challenge raised by Management to\n\nthe exparte award of Labour Court in respect of similar situated\n\nemployees in this Court, it is pointed out that the Management\n\nentered in out of Court settlement with similar situate employees\n\nand paid the employees 50% of the back-wages as awarded by the\n\nLabour Court. He would therefore submit that even the petitioners\n\nare entitled to similar reliefs.\n\n8. Learned Counsel for respondents on the other hand\n\nwould submit that the claim of the petitioners is hit by delay and\n\n7 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 8 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\nlaches. He would invite my attention to the statement of claim\n\nwhere the petitioner has come with the case that he resigned in\n\nthe year 2002. Furthermore the settlement of the year 2004 is not\n\na subject matter of the reference and therefore, according to him,\n\nthe Labour Court is justified in calculating the delay from the year\n\n2002 onwards. He would submit that no doubt, limitation is not\n\nprescribed for making a claim, but nonetheless the employee\n\nconcerned has to approach for redressal of his grievance within a\n\nreasonable time. Learned Counsel would rely upon the decision of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of\nPrabhakar vs. Joint Director,\n\nSecriculture Department\n& anr. reported in 2016 (1) ALL MR\n\n486 (S.C.), to contend the parameters to be kept in mind while\n\nconsidering the aspect of delay.\n\n9. Learned Counsel would also rely upon the decision of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh & ors. vs.\n\nArvind Kumar Srivastava & ors. reported in (2015) 1 SCC 347\n\nin support of his submission that the petitioners have to be treated\n\nas fence-sitters, as they approached the Labour Court only after\n\ntheir counterparts succeeded in the efforts in a claim made by\n\n8 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 9 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\nthem before the Labour Court. According to learned Counsel, the\n\npresent is a fit case where laches and delays, and/or the\n\nacquiescence, would be a valid ground to dismiss their claim. He\n\nwould moreover submit that the evidence on record would clearly\n\nindicate that the petitioners have even received the provident fund\n\ndues on the premise that the petitioners have tendered\n\nresignations.\n\n10. I have heard learned Counsel for the parties. I have\n\ngone through the Memo of Petition, annexures to the Petition and\n\nthe impugned order.\n\n11. It is the case of the petitioner that he tendered his\n\nresignation in December 2002. Thereafter, recognised Union\n\nentered into settlement in the year 2004 in terms of which the\n\nterminal dues of all the employees were settled. Some of the\n\nsimilar situate employees had approached the Labour Court in the\n\nyear 2003 itself by filing Reference IDA Nos.89 to 95, 97 to 122,\n\n146 and 148 of 2003 for the similar reliefs as claimed by the\n\npetitioners. By a common award dated 28/2/2006 the claim of\n\n9 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 10 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\nthose workmen was allowed and the similar situate workmen\n\nwere directed to be reinstated with continuity of service and with\n\nfull back-wages. This according to the Management was an\n\nexparte award. The respondent - Company filed Miscellaneous\n\nApplication for setting aside the exparte award. The same came to\n\nbe rejected by the Labour Court on 27/2/2007. Thereafter, the\n\nManagement filed Writ Petition No. 1708 of 2007 in this Court\n\nchallenging the exparte order. In this Court a settlement was\n\narrived at between the Management and the workers in the said\n\nWrit Petition No. 1708 of 2007 where the company agreed to pay\n\n50% back-wages awarded by the Labour Court.\n\n12. It is thus apparent that it is only after the similar\n\nsituate workers succeeded in the Reference before the Labour\n\nCourt and after the application for setting aside the exparte order\n\nwas rejected by the Labour Court, that the petitioners approached\n\nthe Conciliation Officer only in the year 2007. In this view of the\n\nmatter, this case would stand squarely covered by the decision of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh & ors.\n\n(supra). In paragraph 22.2, their Lordships observed thus :\n\n10 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 11 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\n22.2. However, this principle is subject to well recognized\nexceptions in the form of laches and delays as well as acquiescence.\n\nThose persons who did not challenge the wrongful action in their\ncases and acquiesced into the same and woke up after long delay only\nbecause of the reason that their counterparts who had approached the\nCourt earlier in time succeeded in their efforts, then such employees\ncannot claim that the benefit of the judgment rendered in the case of\nsimilarly situated persons be extended to them. They would be treated\nas fence-sitters and laches and delays, and/or the acquiescence, would\nbe a valid ground to dismiss their claim.\n\n13. The petitioners in the statement of claim clearly made\n\nout a case that they resigned with effect from 2002. According to\n\nthem, the resignation is forced. In my opinion, the fact that the\n\npetitioners approached the Labour Court raising the demand only\n\nafter their counterparts succeeded in their efforts compels me to\n\ncome to a conclusion that the reference suffered laches and delay\n\nwhich was valid ground to dismiss the petitioners' claim. It would\n\nalso be pertinent to mention that though no limitation is\n\nprescribed for making a claim under the Act of 1947, this is a fit\n\ncase to dismiss the claim raised by the petitioners on the ground\n\nof delay. The petitioners by not challenging the wrongful claim in\n\ntheir cases and having acquiesced into the same, woke up after\n\nlong delay only because of the reason that their counterparts\n\nsucceeded in their efforts, then these petitioners cannot claim the\n\n11 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 12 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\nbenefit of the judgment rendered in the case of similarly situated\n\npersons be extended to them.\n\n14. A profitable reference can be made to the observations\n\nof the Apex Court in the case of\nPrabhakar\n(supra) in paragraph\n\n26 which reads thus :-\n\n26. The aforesaid case law depicts the following :\n\n(a) Law of limitation does not apply to the proceedings\nunder the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n.\n\n(b) The words 'at any time' used in\nSection 10\nwould\nsupport that there is no period of limitation in making an order\nof reference.\n\n(c) At the same time, the appropriate Government has to\nkeep in mind as to whether the dispute is still existing or live\ndispute and has not become a stale claim and if that is so, the\nreference can be refused.\n\n(d) Whether dispute is alive or it has become stale/non-\n\nexistent at the time when the workman approaches the\nappropriate Government is an aspect which would depend\nupon the facts and circumstances of each case and there\ncannot be any hard and fast rule regarding the time for making\nthe order of reference.\"\n\n15. It would also be material to refer to paragraph 38 of\n\nthe said decision\nwhich reads thus :\n\n38. Likewise, if a party having a right stands by and sees another\nacting in a manner inconsistent with that right and makes no objection\nwhile the act is in progress he cannot afterwards complain. This\nprinciple is based on the doctrine of acquiescence implying that in\nsuch a case party who did not make any objection acquiesced into the\nalleged wrongful act of the other party and, therefore, has no right to\ncomplain against that alleged wrong.\"\n\n12 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 13 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\n16. In my opinion the view of the Labour Court in\n\nrejecting the claim on the ground of delay, laches and\n\nacquiescence cannot be said to be perverse or erroneous.\n\n17. Though learned Counsel for the petitioners would\n\ncontend that the Labour Court was not justified in calculating the\n\ndelay from 2002 onwards as the settlement is of the year 2004, I\n\nfind from the statement of claim that the petitioners themselves\n\nhave made a claim for reinstatement on the basis of the\n\nresignation which is submitted in December, 2002 which\n\naccording to the petitioners was obtained by force and\n\nmisrepresentation. In the statement of claim there is no challenge\n\nto the settlement of the year 2004 nor is the Reference made on\n\nthe basis of the settlement of 2004.\n\n18. In this view of the matter, I do not find any reason to\n\ninterfere with the impugned order.\n\n19. Even before the matter was heard I had put it to the\n\nlearned Counsel for the respondents if some ex-gratia amount\n\n13 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 14 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\ncould be offered to each of the petitioner in view of the fact that\n\nthey had entered into a settlement with the petitioners'\n\ncounterparts. Learned Counsel for respondents, on instructions,\n\nstated that the respondents are willing to pay an ex-gratia amount\n\nof Rs.25,000/- to each of the petitioner. Learned Counsel for the\n\npetitioners then rejected this offer and proceeded to argue on\n\nmerits.\n\n20. After the order was dictated, learned Counsel for the\n\npetitioners, on instructions, pleaded that they are willing to settle\n\nthe matter and that they would accept Rs.50,000/- each towards\n\nfull and final settlement of their claim. Learned Counsel for the\n\nrespondents in all fairness submits that despite dismissal of these\n\nPetitions, he is still willing to stand by his earlier offer of\n\nRs.25,000/-. Learned Counsel for the respondents in his usual\n\nfairness submitted that though he has no instructions to increase\n\nthe offer, he would leave it to this Court to determine the ex-\n\ngratia amount payable to the petitioners which he assures the\n\nrespondents would abide by. In the interest of justice I am inclined\n\nto accept the proposal made by the learned Counsel for the\n\n14 of 15\n\n::: Uploaded on - 07/05/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 07/04/2020 20:25:53 :::\n\nThis Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 04/06/2019\n\nDDR 15 901. wp 11078-15.doc\n\npetitioners. As agreed by learned Counsel for petitioners, this ex-\n\ngratia amount of Rs.50,000/- payable to each of the petitioner by\n\nthe respondents is towards full and final settlement of their claim.\n\nThe respondents to pay the ex-gratia amount of Rs.50,000/- to\n\neach of the petitioners within a period of 8 weeks from today.\n\n21.
