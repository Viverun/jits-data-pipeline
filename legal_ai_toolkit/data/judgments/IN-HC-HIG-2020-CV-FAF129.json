The petitioners in all these cases were selected and appointed by the\n\nvery same process of selection based on a select list published in the year 2008.\n\nTheir selection was under challenge before this Court in W.P(C).No.37082 of 2007\n\nand also before the Lok Ayukta. Due to the interim order passed by this Court on\n\n30.06.2009 in W.P.(C) No.37082 of 2007 directing that none of the appointees\n\nshall be promoted until further orders pending disposal of the Writ Petition, none\n\nof them were granted promotion. As per judgment dated 21.02.2017 in W.P.(C)\n\nNo.491 of 2012 and connected cases, this Court upheld their selection and directed\n\nthe University to grant all the benefits to the appointees including promotion in\n\npreference to their juniors. University thereafter issued orders granting promotion\n\nto the cadre of Senior Grade Assistants, Selection Grade Assistants and Section\n\nOfficers. Brief facts in each of the cases are the following:\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 27\n\n2. W.P(c).No.1366/2018\n\n2.1. This Writ Petition was filed on 12.01.2018 aggrieved by the promotions\n\ngranted to respondents 4 to 34 as Selection Grade Assistants and as Section\n\nOfficers in preference to them. They are challenging Ext.P1 order dated\n\n23.02.2017 and Ext.P2 order dated 16.08.2017, to the extent respondents 4 to 34\n\nwere granted promotion as Selection Grade Assistants in preference to them. They\n\nclaimed that they had completed their probation in May/June, 2009 after passing\n\nthe departmental tests in January, 2009 and they became eligible for promotion as\n\nSenior Grade Assistants in June 2009, as shown in Ext.P3 list. At the same time,\n\neven though the party respondents had passed the departmental tests only in July,\n\n2009, as shown in Ext.P4 list, they were granted promotion as Section Officers\n\noverlooking the petitioners. Aggrieved by those promotions, the petitioners had\n\nsubmitted a representation before the Vice Chancellor on 27.02.2017. Thereupon\n\nthe Vice Chancellor constituted an Anomaly Rectification Committee (ARC)\n\ncomprising Joint Registrar, Administration, Joint Registrar (Finance), Deputy\n\nRegistrar Administration I, Assistant Registrar Administration I and Section\n\nOfficer, Finance III Section, in order to examine and report the anomalies. The\n\nARC submitted Ext.P5 report to the Vice Chancellor on 17.05.2017 recommending\n\nto grant promotion to Assistants of 2008 batch to the cadre of Senior Grade w.e.f\n\n03.12.2009 and to Selection Grade w.e.f 01.04.2011. The Vice Chancellor called\n\nfor objections on the report to be submitted before 31.05.2017. After examining\n\nthe objections the committee submitted a draft proposal on 28.06.2017; the Vice\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 28\n\nChancellor on 06.07.2017 directed the committee to submit a comprehensive\n\nreport after verifying all the available records. Thereafter, the ARC submitted\n\nExt.P6 report on 10.8.2017, in which the promotions granted to respondents 4 to\n\n34 in Exts.P1 and P2 orders were found to be wrong and therefore placed them in\n\nthe list in accordance with the date on which they passed the departmental test. As\n\nno steps were taken to revise the promotions in tune with Ext.P6 report, the\n\npetitioners filed W.P(c).No.30240/2017 seeking directions to the University to\n\npromote the petitioners as Selection Grade Assistants with effect from the date of\n\nExt.P1 in accordance with Ext.P6 report. This Court as per Ext.P7 judgment dated\n\n13.10.2017 directed the University to call for and obtain objections against the\n\nreport and to take a final decision within a further period of one month and to\n\neffect promotions without any further delay.\n\n2.2. But the Vice Chancellor (who is personally impleaded as 3rd\n\nrespondent), instead of implementing Ext.P6 report, sought for the opinion from\n\nthe Legal Adviser of the University. The Legal Adviser opined that the date of\n\nvacancies should be unified considering the date of joining of the last incumbent of\n\n2008 batch. Thereafter, Ext.P8 order was issued on 03.01.2018, revising the\n\npromotions, after unifying the date of occurrence of vacancy as 03.07.2010.\n\nPetitioners submitted that due to unification of vacancies, respondents 4 to 34, who\n\nhad acquired test qualification much after the petitioners, were enabled to retain\n\ntheir illegal promotions. The petitioners are therefore challenging Ext.P8 order\n\ndated 03.01.2018 pointing out that the promotions are granted without considering\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 29\n\nthe date of occurrence of vacancies and the qualification of the Assistants as on the\n\ndate of occurrence of vacancy, contrary to the settled law as laid down in the\n\njudgments of the Full Bench in\nJames Mathew v. Chief Justice\n[1977 KLT 622],\n\nVarghese v. State of Kerala [1981 KLT 458], etc. The petitioners pointed out that\n\nthe Committee had found that the petitioners, who got test qualified much before\n\nrespondents 4 to 34 got qualified, were entitled to be promoted in preference to the\n\nparty respondents taking note of their qualification as on the date of occurrence of\n\nvacancies. It is stated that as per statute 2, Chapter 4 of the Kerala University First\n\nStatute, 1977 the provisions under the KS&SSR as amended from time to time are\n\napplicable to the non teaching staff of the University. As per Rule 28(b)(iA )of\n\nPart II KS&SSR when a select list is prepared subsequent to the occurrence of\n\nvacancy, a person who was not qualified for inclusion in the select list at the time\n\nof occurrence of vacancy shall not be included in the select list and in case nobody\n\nwas qualified at the time of occurrence of vacancy, then the person who gets test\n\nqualified first shall be promoted. Petitioners have also alleged that the 3rd\n\nrespondent, who was holding the post of Vice Chancellor, had been showing undue\n\nfavouritism towards respondents 4 to 34, in order to deny the legitimate right of\n\nthe petitioners.\n\n2.3. Respondents 4 to 34 have filed separate Writ Petitions challenging the\n\nsubsequent proceedings. Respondents 18, 13, 5, 26, 29 and 32 have filed W.P.(C)\n\nNo.9290 of 2018; respondents 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 22, 25, 27, 31 and 34 have filed\n\nW.P.(C) No.4755 of 2019; respondents 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 28 and 33 have\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 30\n\nfiled W.P.(C) No.6297 of 2019 when another ARC was constituted by the\n\nsuccessor Vice Chancellor and a list of eligible persons for promotion with\n\nreference to the date of acquisition of test qualification is prepared, based on that\n\nreport, in which the petitioners in W.P.(C).No.1366 of 2018 were found eligible for\n\npromotion in preference to the party respondents.\n\n3. W.P(C)No.5731 of 2018\n\n3.1. Petitioners in this case also have passed the departmental tests much\n\nearlier and after examining their complaints the ARC had recommended their\n\npromotion in preference to those who acquired test qualification subsequent to\n\nthem. Pointing out that vacancies were available at the time of their entry in\n\nservice itself they claimed promotion as soon as they acquired the test\n\nqualification, irrespective of seniority. They alleged that as per order dated\n\n23.02.2017, promotions were granted without applying the proviso to Rule 28(a)(i)\n\nof KS&SSR; the petitioners submitted representations before the Vice Chancellor;\n\nexplaining the proceedings of the ARC and pointing out that the seniority was\n\ncorrectly assigned to them in the report dated 10.08.2017 of the ARC, the\n\npetitioners alleged that instead of accepting and acting upon the said\n\nrecommendations in the reports dated 10.08.2017 and 04.11.2017, the University\n\nwent on with promotions based on seniority alone. It was alleged that instead of\n\ngranting promotions based on the reports, the Vice Chancellor sought legal opinion\n\nand on the basis of Ext.P7 legal opinion given without examining the relevant\n\nrecords, the University issued the order dated 03.01.2018, whereby the petitioners\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 31\n\nwere brought down and those who acquired test qualification subsequent to them\n\ngot promotion in preference to them. Pointing out that the syndicate had in the\n\nmeeting held on 31.05.1963, as per Ext.P9 minutes, decided to make Ext.P8 order\n\nissued by the Government on 14.01.1963 applicable to the University, whereby an\n\nAssistant has to pass the account test lower and Secretariat manual test for\n\nprobation and promotion. The petitioners alleged that in case all the relevant\n\nrecords were brought to the notice of the legal adviser, he would have supported\n\nthe recommendations of the ARC to effect promotions from 22.05.2009, when the\n\npetitioners and others were having test qualification, etc. The petitioners are\n\naggrieved by the proceedings pursuant to the legal opinion.\n\n4. W.P.(C) No.8866 of 2018:\n\n4.1. Respondent no.30 in W.P.(C) No.1366/2018, is the petitioner herein\n\nwho is supporting the legal opinion and seeks directions to the University to take\n\naction in tune with the legal opinion stating that test qualification is not necessary\n\nfor promotion.\n\n5. W.P(c).No.9290/2018\n\n5.1. The petitioners in this Writ Petition are respondents 18, 13, 5, 26, 29\n\nand 32 respectively in W.P.(C).No.1366 of 2018, who were granted promotion as\n\nSection Officers. According to them, the University had, as per circular dated\n\n01.10.2013, issued a provisional gradation list of non-teaching staff in the category\n\nof Assistants and above upto that of Joint Registrars as on 01.07.2013 and had\n\ncalled for objections to be reached on or before 31.10.2013. Thereafter, Ext.P2\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 32\n\nfinal gradation list was published on 23.02.2017, after this Court upheld the\n\nselection as per common judgment dated 21.02.2017. The petitioners claimed that\n\nbased on the said seniority list, promotions were granted to them and several\n\nothers, as per Ext.P3 order dated 23.02.2017, as Senior Grade Assistants and\n\nSelection Grade Assistants and further promotion as Section Officers to 52\n\npersons.\n\n5.2. As several complaints were received against those promotions, the\n\nVice Chancellor constituted an ARC to examine the complaints; ARC, after\n\nhearing all the parties, submitted Ext.P4 report dated 17.05.2017, recommending\n\nto postpone the date from which promotions were made to the post of Senior\n\nGrade Assistants from 22.5.2009 to 3.12.2009 stating that there was no exigency in\n\nservice or public interest involved necessitating promotions on 22.05.2009, as\n\ncontemplated in Statute 12 Part II Chapter 4 of the Kerala University First\n\nStatutes, 1977 and that promotions could be effected only w.e.f 03.12.2009 - the\n\ndate on which the seniors were superseded by the juniors. It was also\n\nrecommended that there should be a gap of one year from the date of promotion\n\nfrom Senior Grade to Selection Grade applying proviso to Rule 28(a)(i) of\n\nKS&SSR; various objections were submitted against the said report with respect to\n\nthe date of occurrence of substantive vacancies, ratio to be maintained,\n\nrequirement of test qualification for promotion, etc; the ARC submitted Ext.P5\n\nfinal report to the Vice Chancellor on 10.8.2017 and that final report was made\n\navailable for scrutiny and verification.\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 33\n\n5.3. According to the petitioners, the ARC had recommended to promote\n\nseveral employees even before completion of the one year period of probation and\n\nfor further promotions, while excluding several persons for the purpose of\n\npromotion. At that stage, petitioners 1 to 7 in W.P.(C) No.1366 of 2018 approached\n\nthis Court filing W.P(c).No.30240/2017, seeking implementation of the\n\nrecommendations in Ext.P5 report, when this Court issued time bound direction to\n\nthe University to take a final decision in the matter and to effect promotions.\n\n5.4. The Vice Chancellor thereupon referred the matter to the legal advisor\n\nfor his opinion and the legal advisor opined that acquisition of test qualification\n\ncannot be insisted for probation or promotion, as no such tests were seen\n\nprescribed and no such provisions for the same were incorporated in the special\n\nrules in the schedule to the Kerala University First Ordinances, 1978. The Legal\n\nAdviser opined that promotions shall be granted reckoning the date of occurrence\n\nof vacancy as 03.07.2010, so that equal opportunity can be granted to all the\n\nAssistants of 2008 batch. Thereafter, the University issued Ext.P7 order on\n\n03.01.2008 stating that as the last incumbent of the 2008 batch joined service on\n\n03.07.2008, it would be proper to effect promotion by reckoning the date of\n\noccurrence of vacancy as on 03.07.2010, granting promotions to the post of Senior\n\nGr.Assistants from 03.07.2010 onwards and to the post of Selection Grade\n\nAssistants from 03.07.2011 onwards. In the meanwhile, the petitioners in\n\nW.P(c).No.30240/2017 along with another filed W.P(C).No.1366 of 2018, seeking\n\nimplementation of Ext.P5 report of the ARC and challenging any further action\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 34\n\nbased on the legal opinion. This Court had passed an interim order staying all\n\nfurther promotions based on Ext.P7 proceedings.\n\n5.5. Whileso the University issued Ext.P8 circular on 13.03.2018, stating\n\nthat a new committee was constituted to examine the complaints received against\n\nthe promotions ordered in Ext.P7 order, with reference to the service book, the\n\ndate of passing departmental tests, the date of eligibility for promotion, etc. and\n\nthat committee has prepared a list of Assistants to be promoted as Senior Grade\n\nand Selection Grade Assistants and also as Section Officers. All those who were\n\npromoted/reverted as per Ext.P7 order were directed to examine the list which was\n\nkept in the section and to file objections, if any, along with supporting documents,\n\non or before 19.03.2018. As per the list annexed to the circular it was proposed to\n\nlower down the seniority of petitioners 1 and 2 in the post of Section Officers and\n\nto revert petitioners 3 to 6 from the post of Section Officers to that of Selection\n\nGrade Assistants.\n\n5.6. Pointing out that the new ARC was constituted when the new Vice\n\nChancellor took charge when the previous Vice Chancellor had already settled the\n\nmatter, the petitioners approached this Court filing this Writ Petition at that stage\n\nchallenging Ext.P8 circular dated 13.03.2018.\n\n5.7. On 27.03.2018, this Court passed an interim order directing that\n\nfinalisation of the proceedings based on Ext.P8 circular shall be made only after\n\nobtaining permission of this Court, while permitting the proceedings to go on.\n\nThereafter, the ARC submitted its report and the matter was placed before the\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 35\n\nStanding Committee of the Syndicate on staff and Equipment and the Standing\n\nCommittee recommended to accept the report. The Syndicate, in its meeting held\n\non 10.05.2018 considered the matter and resolved to accept the recommendation,\n\nas per Ext.P11 minutes. Pursuant to the report of the new ARC and the decision of\n\nthe syndicate, the University issued Ext.P12 list of employees proposed to be\n\npromoted.\n\n5.8. According to the petitioners, Ext.P12 list of promotees is issued in\n\nviolation of the interim order passed by this Court on 27.03.2018. The petitioners\n\nthereupon got the Writ Petition amended incorporating the challenge against\n\nExts.P10 to P12. They are challenging Ext.P8 circular and Exts.P10 to P12\n\nproceedings. According to the petitioners, Ext.P8 circular is issued in order to\n\nover-reach the direction in Ext.P6 judgment.\n\n5.9. According to the petitioners, Ext.P7 proceedings have become final\n\nand constitution of another ARC was unnecessary; the resolution of the syndicate\n\nreferred to in Ext.P10 report of the ARC, that the Government order dated\n\n14.01.1963, prescribing Manual of Office Procedure and account test lower for\n\npromotion to higher post, was made applicable, cannot have any relevance once\n\nthe\nKerala University Act, 1974\nwas enacted repealing the earlier Act. After the\n\nKerala University First Statutes, 1977 and the Kerala University First Ordinances,\n\n1978 were promulgated prescribing the service conditions of the employees of the\n\nUniversity, the resolution of the syndicate adopting the Government order would\n\nnot have any effect, as there are specific provisions relating to the qualification,\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 36\n\nmethod of appointment, etc. of the Assistants in the Statutes as well as Ordinance.\n\nIt is also their case that even the decision of the syndicate dated 30.03.1963 never\n\nformed part of the order. The petitioners are therefore challenging the Ext.P8\n\ncircular and Exts.P10 to P12 proceedings.\n\n6. W.P.(C) No. 4755/2019\n\n6.1. Respondents 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 28 and 33 in W.P.C).No.1366\n\nof 2018 are the petitioners. Petitioners, who are 10 in number, were working as\n\nSection Officers. In Ext.P1 gradation list they were ranked as Sl.Nos.36, 41, 58,\n\n64, 77, 95, 117, 125, 142 and 152 respectively. In Ext.P2 final gradation list also\n\ntheir rank continued to be the same. Petitioners 1 to 6 were promoted as Section\n\nOfficers and 7 to 10 were promoted as Selection Grade Assistants as per Ext.P3\n\norder dated 23.02.2017. They were subsequently promoted as Section Officers; all\n\nof them completed their probation within a period of one year of their joining duty;\n\nall of them passed the departmental tests namely, Account test (lower/higher) and\n\nSecretariat Manual within a period of two years, though there is no requirement for\n\nthe same for promotion. According to them, the promotions are to be made in\n\naccordance with seniority irrespective of the date of passing the departmental tests.\n\n7. W.P.(C) No. 6297 of 2019\n\n7.1. Petitioners are respondents 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 28 and 33 in\n\nW.P.(C) No.1366 of 2018. They are assigned ranks between 14 and 85 in the\n\ngradation list. Petitioners 9 and 10 were promoted as Section Officers as per order\n\ndated 16.08.2017. Their claim is that promotion granted on the basis of seniority is\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 37\n\nnot liable to be varied on the basis of date of acquisition of test qualification. As in\n\nthe case of petitioners in W.P.(C) No.9290/2018 and W.P.(C) No. 4755/2019, the\n\ncontention of the petitioners herein is also more or less similar. All of them submit\n\nthat the seniority assigned to them in the final gradation list was never under\n\nchallenge. According to them, passing the departmental test is not necessary for\n\npromotion from the post of Assistants, as there is no ordinance by which syndicate\n\nprescribed any test qualification and therefore they are entitled to be promoted on\n\nthe basis of the seniority assigned in the final gradation list. Relying on the\n\njudgment in W.A.No.989/2008, they have stated even a resolution passed by the\n\nsyndicate will not substitute the requirement of an ordinance for prescription of the\n\ndepartmental test. According to them, the decision taken by the syndicate on\n\n11.07.2018 and the order passed by the University on 16.08.2018 to promote the\n\nAssistants as Senior Grade Assistants on the basis of the date of acquiring test\n\nqualification, are illegal. By those orders 162 Assistants were promoted as Senior\n\nGrade Assistants with effect from dates falling between 10.07.2009 and\n\n20.08.2016. It is also their case that those promotions have been effected unsettling\n\ntheir settled seniority. According to them, the Government Order or general rules\n\ncannot be made applicable to the employees of the University as the service\n\nconditions are governed by independent statutes. All of them support the opinion\n\ntendered by Legal Adviser of the University and support the promotions granted as\n\nper order dated 03.01.2018 and challenge the constitution of a new ARC thereafter\n\nand the action taken based on the recommendations therein, to grant promotions\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 38\n\nbased on the date of acquiring of test qualification.\n\n7.2. The additional respondents who got impleaded in the aforesaid Writ\n\nPetitions have filed counter affidavits. Some of them have filed separate Writ\n\nPetitions also. According to them, it is necessary to have the test qualification. It is\n\ntheir contention that none of the petitioners had raised any contention that test\n\nqualification is not required in any of the representations or objections and it is for\n\nthe first time that they raised such contention before this Court.\n\n8. Counter Affidavit by the University:\n\n8.1. In the counter affidavit filed in W.P(C).No.9290/2018 and 4755/2019,\n\nthe University has stated the following: In the provisional gradation list as on\n\n01.07.2013, published and circulated on 01.10.2013, those Assistants who joined\n\nin 2008 were included at sl.no.26 to 203 among the Assistants. Since all of them\n\nwere continuing in the entry cadre because of the interim order in\n\nW.P(C).No.37082/2007, they were included on the basis of advice seniority with a\n\nrider that their appointment and seniority would be subject to the final disposal of\n\nW.P(C).No.37082/2007. Ext.P2 final gradation list was also published with the\n\nvery same rider, in accordance with the same status as on 01.07.2013, when the\n\nWrit Petition was pending, after considering the complaints received and effecting\n\ncorrections, but without considering whether they passed the departmental test or\n\nnot. As per order dated 23.02.2017 promotions were granted to those whose\n\nprobation was declared and had passed the departmental tests.\n\n8.2. In view of the large number of complaints received against those\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 39\n\npromotions, the Vice Chancellor ordered that a committee be constituted to look\n\ninto the complaints. That committee submitted its first report on 17.05.2017.\n\nOn directions of the Vice Chancellor to call for objections on it and to examine the\n\nsame with reference to connected files, the ARC again examined the same and\n\nsubmitted another report on 28.06.2017. It is stated that the report was found to\n\nbe vague; the objections against it and recommendations on it were not seen listed\n\nout or examined in the light of relevant rules, specific recommendations for\n\nclearing objections submitted and available records. The committee was again\n\ndirected to submit a comprehensive report with specific recommendations for\n\nrectifying the anomalies, after considering all those objections, after verification of\n\nrelevant records including those, based on which the initial proposal was made for\n\npromotion. Thereafter, the ARC submitted its report on 10.08.2017. Objections\n\nwere called for on it and after considering the objection received against that\n\nreport, the Vice Chancellor again directed the ARC to furnish clarifications on the\n\nobjections. The ARC submitted its clarifications and recommended that legal\n\nopinion be obtained on the matter from the Legal Adviser. As the reports submitted\n\nby the ARC on different dates were contradictory and rival claims were made by\n\nthe parties, the matter required careful examination; the University thereafter\n\nissued order dated 03.01.2018 in the light of the legal opinion and granted one\n\nmonth's time to the incumbents to submit their option for fixation; University\n\nexamined about 50 complaints received against the order dated 03.01.2018 when it\n\nwas found that the ARC had applied different yardsticks on different occasions for\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 40\n\narriving at its conclusions. In those circumstances, the Vice Chancellor ordered\n\nconstitution of a new committee to examine the objections. Thereafter, a new\n\ncommittee was constituted with senior officials from administration and financial\n\nwings; the new committee was directed to state the eligible date of promotion of\n\nthe incumbents to various categories based on the relevant rules and publish a list\n\nafter verifying the Service Books and ascertaining the actual date of passing the\n\ndepartmental tests. As directed, the new committee submitted a list of persons on\n\n13.03.2018.\n\n8.3. In view of the interim order passed in W.P.(C) No. 9290 of 2018 on\n\n27.03.2018, final orders could not be passed pursuant to the report, while\n\npermitting further action on the basis of the report. The committee thereafter\n\nsubmitted its report on 24.04.2018 and the syndicate considered the same in its\n\nmeeting held on 05.05.2018 and resolved to accept the report. It is stated that\n\npromotions are thereafter made after getting permission from this Court.\n\n8.4. The petitioners in W.P(C).No.4755/2019 passed the Account Test only\n\nin January, 2009 and July, 2009. Their probation was declared after they completed\n\none year's duty and thereafter they passed obligatory departmental test for\n\nprobation. Probation of petitioners 1 to 4, 7, 9 and 10 was extended beyond one\n\nyear from the date of joining since they had not acquired obligatory departmental\n\ntest. They had not challenged the requirement of pass in the departmental tests for\n\ndeclaration of probation and the preparation of the list. The University had issued\n\na circular calling for the details regarding the date of passing the test before\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 41\n\n9.6.2009 for publishing the list of Assistants who were qualified for the period\n\nupto and during December, 2008/January, 2009. Thereafter, as per circular\n\ndated.21.12.2010 a list of 152 Assistants was published including only those\n\nAssistants who had cleared the departmental test. At that time, the petitioners did\n\nnot challenge the said list.\n\n8.5. Regarding the staff structure of Assistants in the University, the\n\nrequirement of test qualification, etc. the version of the University is the following:\n\nAs per Kerala University First Ordinances, 1978, there are 4 grades in the cadre of\n\nAssistants : Sl.No.18A - Selection Grade Assistant, Sl.No.19 - Senior Grade\n\nAssistant, Sl.No.20 - Assistant Grade I and Sl.No.21 - Assistant Gr.II. Ratio\n\nbetween the 4 grades is 1:1:1:1. Promotion to the post of Assistant Grade I is made\n\nfrom suitable Assistants Grade II on the basis of seniority and merit and pass in the\n\nprescribed tests as technical qualification; the cadre ratio was refixed as 1:1:1 as\n\nper pay revision order 2004 which was implemented by the University as per order\n\n28.6.2006. No amendments were made to the University First Ordinance, 1978 in\n\ntune with the pay revision orders. When the ordinance was amended as per gazette\n\nnotification dated 19.04.2013, qualification and method of recruitment against\n\nsl.no.21 - Assistant Gr.II were modified w.e.f 12.4.2013; but when it was approved\n\nby the senate in its meeting held on 21st and 22nd of February, 2017, it was\n\nspecified that promotion to the post of Senior Grade Assistant is done from\n\nsuitable Assistants on the basis of seniority and merit and pass in the prescribed\n\ntests and qualification; the post of Assistant Gr.I is deleted and Assistant Gr.II is\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 42\n\nrenamed as Assistant in the amendment proposal. The University has forwarded\n\nthe amendment proposal to the Chancellor on 04.04.2017. As per Statute 10 of\n\nChapter 4 of Part II of the Kerala University First Statutes, 1977 the University\n\nemployees shall be required to pass such departmental tests or examinations within\n\nsuch period as may be prescribed by the Syndicate within the period of probation.\n\nThe syndicate had in its meeting held on 31.05.1963 and 01.06.1993 resolved that\n\nG.O(P) No.22 dated 14.01.1963 ([Ext.R1(a)], would be made applicable to the\n\nUniversity with effect from 14.01.1963. As per this order, for promotion to higher\n\nposts, pass in Secretariat Office Manual Test is required for declaration of\n\nprobation and pass in Account Test lower also is required. As per Ext.R1(b)\n\nresolution, the syndicate had resolved to make the said order applicable to the\n\nUniversity employees. It is stated that Ext.R1(b) decision of the syndicate is not\n\nreplaced by the statutes ordinances, regulations, rules or bye-laws or orders issued\n\nby the University.\n\n8.6. The syndicate had in its meeting held on 19.02.1966, resolved to give\n\nexemption to the employees who completed 45 years of age on 14.1.1963 from\n\npassing the tests in Secretariat Office Manual Test and Account Test lower. In the\n\nmeeting held on 25.2.1967 it was resolved to fix the ratio between Assistant Gr.I\n\nand II as 2:1 and 64 posts of Assistant Gr.II were upgraded as Gr.I post. As per the\n\ntransitory provisions of\nChapter IX of the Kerala University Act, 1974\n, the\n\nStatutes, Ordinances, Regulations, Rules, Orders and Bye-laws in force\n\nimmediately before the commencement of the Act shall continue to be in force so\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 43\n\nfar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act until they are\n\nreplaced by the Statutes, Ordinances, Regulations, Rules, Bye-laws or orders\n\nframed under the Act. Annex.R1(b) resolution of the syndicate prescribes the\n\ndepartmental test and the same is not replaced by the Statutes, Ordinances,\n\nRegulations, Rules, bye-laws or orders till date. The syndicate had in its meeting\n\nheld on 1.12.1984 resolved to implement G.O(P).No.309/84 dated.31.08.1984 in\n\nthe University, by which persons who attained the age of 50 years on or after\n\n25.08.1981 are eligible for permanent exemption from passing the obligatory\n\ndepartmental tests for all purposes such as promotion, appointment of full member\n\nof service etc. irrespective of their total period of service.\n\n8.7. It is stated that the consistent stand taken by the University is that pass\n\nin the departmental test is necessary for promotion of Assistant Grade II to Grade I\n\nand eligibility for such promotion has to be determined with reference to the dates\n\nof occurrence of the vacancies. This stand is reflected from O.P.No.4643/2003\n\nwherein this Court recorded the submission made by the University that a pass in\n\nthe departmental test is an essential qualification for promotion as Assistant Gr.I.\n\n9. Counter Affidavit by Additional 3rd respondent in W.P.(C) No.\n\n4755/2019:\n\n9.1. The party respondents in W.P.(C).Nos.9290/2018 and 4755 of 2019\n\nhave filed counter affidavits. It is stated that the gradation list was finalised\n\nwithout taking into account the final disposal of W.P.(C) No.37082/2007. There is\n\nnothing in the gradation list to show the declaration of probation, confirmation of\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 44\n\nservice or eligibility for promotion; the incumbents were placed in the order of\n\ndate of entry in service. Immediately after the disposal of the Writ Petitions\n\nchallenging the 2008 selection, the University issued orders granting promotion in\n\naccordance with the date of completion of probation in the entry cadre and date of\n\npassing the mandatory departmental tests. But further promotion to the posts of\n\nAssistant Selection Grade and Section Officer was effected in total disregard of\n\nrules and seniority. On the basis of representations submitted by additional\n\nrespondents and others, an anomaly rectification committee was constituted and\n\neven after reports were submitted on 10.08.17 and 04.11.2017, the matter was\n\nbeing dragged despite the direction of this Court in the judgment in\n\nW.P(c).No.30240/2017 to final decision and to effect promotions without any\n\ndelay. Thereafter, they sought legal opinion and orders were issued based on\n\nopinion tendered in disregard of the decision taken by the syndicate in the year\n\n1963 to adopt the Government order, which prescribed the test qualifications.\n\nPersons like the additional 3rd respondent have therefore filed W.P.(C) No.1366 of\n\n2018 and 5741/2018 for implementation of the report instead of proceeding on the\n\nbasis of the legal opinion. They have also pointed out that those who claim\n\npromotions without test qualification had approached the University pointing out\n\nthe date on which they passed the test and they never raised a claim that pass in\n\ndepartmental test is not necessary. It is stated that under\nSection 82(3)\nof the\n\nKerala University Act, 1974, the statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules, bye-laws\n\nand orders in force immediately before the commencement of the Act shall\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 45\n\ncontinue to be in force in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of\n\nthe Act, until they are replaced by the statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules, bye-\n\nlaws or orders framed under the Act; the decision of the syndicate adopting the\n\nGovernment order prescribing the test qualification is not replaced by any statute,\n\nordinance, rule, regulation, bye-laws or order and the said prescription is not\n\ninconsistent with any of the provisions in the\nUniversity Act, 1974\nand the same\n\ncontinues to be in force even now. They have produced Ext.R3(c) representation\n\ndated 26.05.2014 submitted before the Vice Chancellor by those who object to the\n\nrequirement of test qualification, stating that they have passed the required tests\n\nand acquired qualifications for promotion as Senior Assistant. It is stated that all of\n\nthem were very well aware of the requirement. Petitioners 1, 5 and 7 to 9 in W.P\n\n(c).No.4755 of 2019 are signatories to Ext.R3(c) representation. It is also stated\n\nthat 2 of them had approached this Court filing W.P(c).No.10644/2015 seeking\n\ndirections to the University to grant them promotions provisionally and subject to\n\ndisposal of W.P(c).No.37082/2007, when they did not have any such claim and\n\nUniversity has also been insisting test qualification as a condition for declaring\n\nprobation as well as promotion.\n\n10. Counter Affidavit filed by additional respondents 8 and 9 in W.P.\n\n(C) No. 9209 of 2018:\n\n10.1. When the University was governed by the Kerala University Act,\n\n1957, qualification of non-teaching staff was fixed in Chapter LVIII of Part III of\n\nUniversity Employees (Other than Teachers) Service Condition Ordinance issued\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 46\n\nunder Act 14/57, Clause 14 thereof provided that University employees will be\n\nrequired to pass such departmental tests as may be prescribed by the Syndicate. On\n\n31.5.1963/01.06.1963, the Syndicate, as per decision No.139 resolved to follow\n\nthe Government order dated 14.01.1963, according to which, the pass in Account\n\nTest (Lower) would be a mandatory qualification for Lower Division Clerk post\n\nand pass in Secretariat Office Manual Test would be made mandatory for\n\ndeclaration of probation in LDC. On 25.02.1967, the syndicate resolved to\n\npromote only those Assistant Gr.II who have passed the required departmental test.\n\nAs per Section 75(2) of Chapter IX of Kerala University Act, 1969 all Statute,\n\nRules, Ordinance and Bye-laws which were in force immediately before the\n\ncommencement of that Act, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the\n\nprovisions of this Act, would continue to be in force until they are replaced by the\n\nStatutes, Ordinances, Rules or Bye-laws framed under that Act. As per the\n\nschedule attached to Chapter XIV of the Kerala University First Ordinance 1972\n\nwhich deals with scale of pay, qualification etc. of various posts in the University,\n\npass in the prescribed test was stipulated as the technical qualification for\n\npromotion to the post of Assistant Gr.I from among suitable Assistant Gr.II on the\n\nbasis of seniority and merit. Section 82(3) of Chapter IX of Kerala University Act,\n\n1974 is similar to\nSection 75(2)\nof the Kerala University Act, 1969. As per Statute\n\n2 of Chapter 4 of the Kerala University First Statute, 1977, the provisions of\n\nKS&SSR 1958, as amended from time to time, shall apply to the University\n\nemployees. As per Statute 10, the University employees are required to pass such\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 47\n\ndepartmental tests or examinations within such period as may be prescribed by the\n\nSyndicate within the period of probation. Under the provisions in the schedule to\n\nKerala University First Ordinance 1978, pass in the prescribed test is mandatory\n\nfor promotion of Assistant Gr.II as Assistant Gr.I. The syndicate in its meeting held\n\non 01.12.1984 resolved to implement the amendment of KS&SSR effected as per\n\nG.O.(P)No.309/84, GAD dated 31.08.1984, according to which, a person who\n\nattained the age of 50 years on or after 25.08.1981 is eligible for permanent\n\nexemption from passing obligatory departmental test for all purposes. In the\n\namendment proposal approved by the Senate of the University in the meeting held\n\non 21.02.2017 it is stated that promotion to the post of Senior Grade Assistant is\n\nmade from suitable Assistants on the basis of seniority and merit and pass in the\n\nprescribed test as technical qualification. In that meeting, Assistant Gr.II was\n\nredesignated as Assistant, while deleting the post of Assistant Gr.I. It is stated that\n\nin reply to the query made in the Legislative Assembly interpellation on\n\n30.01.2018, the answer of the University was that pass in Secretariat Office\n\nmanual Test is necessary for declaration of probation and pass in Account Test\n\n(Lower) is necessary for promotion. It is also stated that in the judgment dated\n\n04.04.2007 in WP(C) No.1544/2007 when the question relating to promotion to\n\nthe post of Assistant Gr.I came up for consideration, it was held that promotion to\n\nthe post of Assistant Gr.I from Gr.II could be granted to those who are test\n\nqualified and their eligibility for such promotion has to be determined with\n\nreference to the date of occurrence of vacancies.\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 48\n\n11. Similar contentions were raised by all the Assistants who passed the\n\ntest qualification at the earliest point of time.\n\n12. W.P(c).No.4267/2020\n\n12.1. The petitioner claims promotion on the ground that he completed\n\nprobation on 25.05.2019. It is stated that he has submitted a representation\n\nrequesting for promotion as Section Officer, pointing out the date of completion of\n\nprobation on 25.05.2009. It is stated that he got relieved from the University and\n\njoined KSFE on 05.10.2016. Thereafter, on the basis of his request, he was\n\npermitted to rejoin duty in the University on 23.06.2018. He was promoted as\n\nSr.Gr. and Sel.Grade Assistant as per order dt.30.11.2018 (Ext.P7). His case is that\n\nhe passed the Account Test and Secretariat Office Manual Test in January, 2009\n\nitself.\n\n13. Heard learned Senior Counsel Sri Jaju Babu, M/s S.P.Aravindakshan\n\nPillai, Sri P.C.Sasidharan, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.(C)\n\n9290/2018, 4755/2019, 6297/2019 respectively, who claim that test qualification is\n\nnot necessary; M/s V.P.Seemanthini and P.Ravindran, the learned Senior Counsel\n\nand M/s Nandakumar, M.Sreekumar, who appear for the parties who claim that\n\ntest qualification is necessary/for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.1366 of 2018 and\n\n5731 of 2018, Sri Thomas Abraham the learned Standing Counsel for the\n\nUniversity and all other learned Counsel who appeared for the parties.\n\n14. On consideration of the rival contentions advanced on both sides\n\nespecially as to requirement of test qualification it is necessary to examine the\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 49\n\nrelevant provisions in the University Act, Statute, ordinances, etc. of the Kerala\n\nUniversity.\n\nOrdinance 3 of Chapter XVII of the Kerala University First Ordinance 1978,\nwhich deals with the qualification and method of appointment of non-teaching\nstaff reads as follows:\n\n\"3.

Under Statute 10, they\n\nhave to pass the test prescribed by the syndicate. Going by the definition of\n\n\"prescribed\" under\nSection 2(14)\n, such prescription of test can only be, by way of\n\nAct, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule or byelaw. The manner in which service\n\nconditions of non-teaching staff can be fixed, the manner in which ordinance can\n\nbe made, etc. are given in\nSections 36\n,\nand\nof the Act, which read as follows:\n\n\"36. Ordinances:- Subject to the provisions of this Act and the Statutes, the\n\nSyndicate shall have power to make Ordinances providing for all or any of the\n\nfollowing matters, namely:-\n\nxxxx\n\n(d) the fixation of the scales of pay of various posts in the University and the\n\nterms and conditions of service of officers of the University; and\n\n37. Procedure for making ordinances:- (1) All Ordinances made under this Act\n\nshall have effect from such date as the Syndicate may direct, but every\n\nOrdinance so made and the repeal of any Ordinance shall be laid before the\n\nSenate during its next succeeding meeting.\n\n(2) If any Ordinance or repeal of an Ordinance is not laid before the Senate as\n\nrequired by sub-section (1), the Ordinance shall lapse or, as the case may be,\n\nthe Ordinance repealed shall revived, after the next succeeding meeting of the\n\nSenate.\n\n(3) Subject to the provisions of sub-sections(1) and (2), the procedure to be\n\nfollowed in making, amending or repealing Ordinances shall be prescribed by\n\nthe Statutes.\n\n(4) No Ordinance involving expenditure shall be valid or come into force until\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 52\n\nassented to by the Chancellor.\n\n41. Publication in the Gazette:- All Statutes, Ordinances and Regulations made\n\nunder this Act shall be published in the Gazette.\"\n\n15. From the counter affidavits it is seen that on 3.05/01.06.1963 the\n\nSyndicate had taken Ext.R3(b) decision no.139 that G.O.(P) 22 dated 14.1.1963\n\n[produced as Ext.R3(a) along with I.A.No.1/2019 by additional 3 rd respondent in\n\nW.P.(C) No.9290/2018] shall be made applicable to the University with effect from\n\n14.01.1963. The minutes of that was confirmed in the meeting held on 1963. The\n\norder dated 14.01.1963 provides that LD clerks have to pass account test (lower)\n\nand Secretariat Office Manual test during their probation and promotion. It is seen\n\nthat when the syndicate took the decision on 31.05/01/06/1963, the Kerala\n\nUniversity Act, 1957 was in force. Clause 14 of Chapter LVIII of the Ordinances\n\nUniversity of Kerala Ordinances framed under\nSection 26\nof the 1957 Act read as\n\nfollows:\n\n\" 14.Tests or examinations:\n\nUniversity employees would be required to pass such departmental account and other\n\ntests or examinations as may be prescribed by the syndicate. The syndicate may also lay\n\ndown the rules regarding the periods within which the tests should be passed, the\n\nconsequences of not passing the tests and other cognate matters.\"\n\nIt is also seen that the University had issued an order dated 09.01.1967 fixing a\n\nratio of 2:1 between 1st and 2nd Grade Assistants. In this order it was also ordered\n\nas follows:\n\n\" The promotions of Assistants Grade II to Grade I will be subject to the conditions\n\nstipulated in the last para of the University order cited above, viz, they will be exempted\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 53\n\nfrom test qualifications required under the rules for a period of one year or till after two\n\nexaminations are over and their results published whichever is later: increments being\n\nsanctioned only after they have passed the tests. Employees thus promoted would be\n\nreverted if they do not pass the tests within the period of exemption and the service put in\n\nas first grade Assistants till the date of reversion will not be counted for seniority or\n\npromotion thereafter.\"\n\nFrom this order dated 09.01.1967, it is clear that for the purpose of promotion a\n\ntest was to be passed and failure to pass the test will result in reversion. The order\n\nreferred to in that order is U.O.No. Ad.A5-77/66 dated 09.01.1967. The minutes of\n\nthe meeting of the syndicate held on 25.02.1967 would show that while according\n\nsanction to fix the ratio of 2:1 between Grade I and II of Assistants with effect\n\nfrom 01.08.1966 it was also resolved to promote the incumbents giving exemption\n\nfor one year or till they get two chances to appear in the examination and also to\n\nrevert them in the event of failure to pass the test within the said period. The\n\nUniversity issued the order dated 09.01.1967, incorporating those decisions. The\n\nsaid minutes would also show that promotion to the vacancies of 1 st grade\n\nAssistants shall be granted only to those who passed the required departmental\n\ntest. But it is also relevant to note that there was no order passed by the University\n\nin tune with the decision taken by the syndicate on 31.05/01.06.1963, referring to\n\nthe test qualifications required. It is also seen that the 1957 Act was repealed and\n\nin its place the\nKerala University Act, 1969\n, came into force on 28.02.1969.\n\nSection 75(2)\nof the Act read as follows:\n\n\" (2) The Statutes, Ordinances, Rules and Byelaws in force immediately before the\ncommencement of this Act shall in so far as they are not inconsistent with the\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 54\n\nprovisions of the Act, continue to be in force until they are replaced by the Statutes,\nOrdinances, Rules or Byelaws framed under this Act.\"\n\nThe Kerala University First Ordinances, 1972 was framed under\nSection 76\nof the\n\n1969 Act. Clause 3 thereof which provided for repeal read as follows:\n\n\"76(3). Repeal. (1) The ordinances made under the Kerala University Act, 1957(14 of\n\n1957) in so far as matters for which provisions has been made in these ordinances shall\n\nstand repealed;\n\nProvided that any order made or action taken under the Ordinances so repealed shall\n\nbe deemed to have been made or issued under the corresponding provisions of these\n\nordinances.\n\nProvisions in the ordinances made under the Kerala University Act, 1957(14 of\n\n1957) which are not repealed by these Ordinances or by the Kerala University First\n\nStatutes, 1972 shall stand abrogated when Regulations are framed under\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Act.\n\nIn the schedule to the Kerala University First Ordinance 1972, the post of Assistant\n\nGr.I is at sl. no.13 and Assistant Grade II at sl.no 14. The method of appointment\n\nto the post of Assistant Grade I , as given in the schedule was:\n\n\"by promotion of suitable Assistant gr II on the basis of seniority and merit) . Qualification\n\nis \"pass in prescribed test.\"\n\nKerala University Act, 1974\n(Act 17 of 1974) came into force thereafter on\n\n27.07.1974 and the 1969 Act was repealed.\nSection 82\nwhich relates to transitory\n\nprovisions, provides in Subsection 3 as follows:\n\n82(3). The Statutes, Ordinances, Regulations, Rules, Byelaws and Orders in force\n\nimmediately before the commencement of this Act shall in so far as they are not\n\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Act, continue to be in force until they are replaced\n\nby the Statutes, Ordinances, Regulations, Rules, Byelaws or Orders framed under this\n\nAct.\"\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 55\n\nThe question to be considered is whether that decision of syndicate in its meeting\n\nheld on 31.05/01.06.1963 or the University order of 09.01.1967 or the order of\n\n01.08.1966 referred to therein would continue to be in force even after the repeal\n\nof several enactments after effectuation of\nKerala University Act, 1974\nand the\n\nstatutes and ordinances made thereunder. The decision as well as the University\n\nOrder was taken/issued at a time when the 1957 Act was in force. When the 1969\n\nAct was enacted,\nSection 75\nhad only provided for the continuance of ordinances,\n\nstatutes, ordinances, rules and bye-laws in force. There is no provision which\n\nprovides for enforcement of a decision of the syndicate even after repeal of the\n\nAct. Though the 1974 Act provides for continuance of orders also, such a\n\nprovision is not seen either in 1969 or 1972 Act. The meaning of \"prescribed\"\n\ncontinues to be the same in all the Acts. Moreover, going by\nSection 14\n, the\n\nsyndicate can prescribe a test only by way of Act, statute, ordinance, regulation,\n\nrule or bye-law. There is no provision in the Act, Statute, ordinance, regulation or\n\nbye-law which provides for the test qualifications which the Assistants have to\n\npass for probation or for promotion. Under Statute 2, which provisions in\n\nKS&SSR are applicable only to the extent it is not provided in the Statutes. When\n\nstatute 10 provides that test qualified hands shall be promoted, it is for the\n\nsyndicate to prescribe which are the tests to be passed and also the duration within\n\nwhich it should be passed, the provisions in KS&SSR would not apply.\n\n16. In this context the judgment dated 27.08.2008 of this Court in\n\nW.A.No.989/2008 (P.K.Santhamma V Smt. Krishnakumari & others) relied on by\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 56\n\nthe employees who claim that test qualification is not necessary, is relevant. The\n\nissue which arose in that case was with respect to the qualification viz National\n\nApprenticeship certificate in Printing was not incorporated as a qualification\n\nprescribed in the ordinance, for appointment as Foreman. Though it was found that\n\nthe Government had issued an order recognising NAC in the relevant trade as\n\nequivalent to KGTE certificate (Higher) in composing, Printing and the syndicate\n\nhad taken a decision to that effect, no corresponding amendment was carried out in\n\nthe ordinance and even the decision of the syndicate was taken subsequent to the\n\ndate of occurrence of vacancy. Referring to the provisions contained in\nSection 36\n\nwhich empowers syndicate to make ordinances relating to fixation of pay as well\n\nas conditions of service of officers of the University, the procedure for making\n\nordinances under\nSection 37\nof the Act, the requirement to place it before the\n\nsenate in the next meeting and the requirement under\nSection 41\nof the Act for\n\npublication of such Ordinance in the official gazette, this Court found that no such\n\nordinance was made/no amendment was brought about to the existing ordinance,\n\nincorporating the qualification in tune with the order issued by Government or the\n\ndecision taken by the syndicate. It was also found that there was no provision also\n\nin the ordinance to accept any equivalent qualification. It was found that the\n\nresolution passed by the syndicate was not seen as proposed as Ordinance and it\n\nwas not placed before the next meeting; and it was not published in the official\n\ngazette, as required under\nSections 37\nand\nof the Act. It was held that the\n\nsyndicate could not have legislated through an executive order that the order\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 57\n\nissued by the Registrar of the University cannot be treated as an amendment to the\n\nqualification prescribed in the schedule annexed to the Kerala University First\n\nOrdinance, 1978.\n\n17. The contention of the University as well as the employees who passed\n\nthe departmental test at the earliest point of time that all the employees before this\n\nCourt have acquired the test qualification; they did not raise any objection against\n\nthe pass in the tests in any of their earlier representation, etc. and in the cases\n\nwhich this Court considered, the absence of test qualification was never raised, etc.\n\ncannot be accepted. In any of the cases considered by this Court, a contention as to\n\nthe absence of provision in the ordinance or statute regarding test qualification was\n\nnot raised or considered. In para.6 of the judgment in O.P. No.4643 of 2003 (S\n\nMuthukrishnan's case), this Court observed that \"6. Thus, I have to proceed on the\n\nbasis that for promotion to the post of Assistant Gr I, a pass in departmental test is\n\nan essential qualification and only those who have passed the Departmental Test\n\nwill be considered for promotion\". Seeing that 101 vacancies of Assistant Gr.I\n\nwere created on 01.03.1992, this Court held that only those Assistant Gr II who\n\nwere test qualified as on 01.03.1992 alone would have been promoted with effect\n\nfrom that date and seniors who were not test qualified were not entitled to be\n\npromoted against those vacancies when there were qualified juniors. Though the\n\njudgment relates to promotion to the post of Assistant Gr.I, none of the parties\n\ntherein had raised any claim regarding the requirement of prescription of test\n\nqualification. Therefore, the said judgment or the judgment dated 06.01.2010 in\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 58\n\nW.A.No.1544 of 2007 dismissing the appeal would not show whether the test\n\nqualification was prescribed or not.\n\n18.\nIn the judgment in\nVijayakumar S & others v. State of Kerala &\n\nothers\n: 2018(4)KHC 16, the Division Bench was considering a case where juniors\n\nwere assigned seniority over test qualified juniors. There the vacancies of Auditor\n\nGr.I which arose consequent to restructuring, were filled up by provisional\n\npromotions at a time when nobody with test qualification was available. Seniority\n\nre-arranged thereafter with reference to date of declaration of probation was\n\nupheld, repelling the claim under the proviso to Rule 28(a)(i) of KS&SSR,\n\nobserving that the same was applicable only in the case of test qualified seniors.\n\n19. Therefore, it is seen that the test qualification is not so far prescribed\n\nby the syndicate in the manner in which it is to be prescribed. It is for the\n\nUniversity to take appropriate action to incorporate the test qualifications as a pre-\n\ncondition for probation and promotion, in accordance with law. Though it looks\n\nawkward that the Assistants in the University do not require pass in departmental\n\ntests and it is difficult to accept this factual situation, in the absence of any material\n\nor even any judgment to support, a long standing practice alone which all the\n\nparties accepted all along, this Court is not in a position to conclude that test\n\nqualification need not be prescribed as defined in\nSection 2(14)\nof the Act.\n\n20. The Writ Petitions are ordered as follows:\n\nIt is declared that there is no provision in the University Act, Statutes or\n\nOrdinances governing the Assistants/Assistant Gr.II working in the Kerala\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 59\n\nUniversity which prescribes test qualification either for probation or promotion to\n\nhigher posts. The University shall take further action accordingly. All proceedings\n\ngranting promotion with reference to the date of acquisition of test qualification\n\nshall be revised and promotions shall be granted on the basis of seniority. Entire\n\nprocess shall be completed within a period of two months from the date of receipt\n\nof a copy of the judgment.\n\nSd/-\n\n(P.V.ASHA, JUDGE)\n\nrtr/\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 60\n\nAPPENDIX OF WP(C) 1366/2018\nPETITIONERS' EXHIBITS:\n\nEXHIBIT P1 TRUE COPY OF ORDER DATED 23.02.2017 ISSUED\nBY THE 1ST RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P2 TRUE COPY OF ORDER DATED 16.08.2017 ISSUED\nBY THE 1ST RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P3 TRUE COPY OF THE LIST OF ASSISTANTS\nELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION IN JUNE 2009.\n\nEXHIBIT P4 TRUE COPY OF THE LIST OF ASSISTANTS WHO\nPASSED THE DEPARTMENTAL TEST AFTER JUNE\n2009.\n\nEXHIBIT P5 TRUE COPY OF THE REPORT OF THE ANOMALY\nRECTIFICATION COMMITTEE DATED 17.05.2017.\n\nEXHIBIT P6 TRUE COPY OF THE REPORT OF THE ANOMALY\nRECTIFICATION COMMITTEE DATED 10.08.2017.\n\nEXHIBIT P7 TRUE COPY OF JUDGMENT IN W.P.(C) NO.30240\nOF 2017 DATED 13.10.2017.\n\nEXHIBIT P8 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THE 1ST\nRESPONDENT DATED 03.01.2018.\n\nRESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS\n\nEXT.R1(a) TRUE COPY OF THE GOVERNMENT ORDER NUMBERED\nAS G.O(P).NO.22 DATED 14.1.1963.\n\nEXT.R1(b) TRUE COPY OF THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF\nTHE SYNDICATE HELD ON 31.5.1963 &\n01.06.1963.\n\nEXT.R1(c) TRUE COPY OF THE REPORT PREPARED BY THE\nCOMMITTEE AFTER VERIFYING THE SERVICE BOOKS\nOF EMPLOYEES CONCERNED AND OTHER RELEVANT\nRECORDS.\n\nEXT.R1(d) TRUE COPY OF THE LIST OF EMPLOYEES TO BE\nPROMOTED TO HIGHER POSTS, I.E ASSISTANT\nSENIOR GRADE, ASSISTANT SELECTION GRADE AND\nSECTION OFFICER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\nREPORT OF THE ANOMALY RECTIFICATION\nCOMMITTEE.\n\nW.P(C).No.1366/2018 & c/cases 61\n\nAPPENDIX OF WP(C) 5731/2018\nPETITIONERS' EXHIBITS:\n\nEXHIBIT P1 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER NO.
