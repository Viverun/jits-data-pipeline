Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) was\n\nalso present there and he again told him that both the appellants have\n\ncommitted murder of deceased by chopping his neck by means of sharp\n\nedged weapon (Katta).\n\n3.1 Sarpanch - Kamal @ Komal Prasad Patel (PW-10) informed about the\n\nincident at Police Station - Shivrinarayan, Inspector - Ravindra Kumar\n\nAnant (PW-13) immediately reached to the spot, where on being information\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n-4-\n\ngiven by complainant Prem Lal Sahu (PW-1), lodged Dehati Merg Intimation\n\n(Ex.P-1) and Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P-2).

Blood stained articles and clothes were seized\n\nfrom them. Spot map was also got prepared from concerned Patwari. After\n\nincident, the appellants had recorded their version about the causing\n\nincident and they also viral it through social media, it also received by\n\nGopichand Sahu (PW-3), hence, that viral video was retrieved in a Compact\n\nDist ('CD') and the same was seized vide seizure memo Ex.

After prosecution evidence, statement of accused persons were\n\nrecorded under\nSection 313\nof Cr.P.C., in which, they pleaded their\n\ninnocence and false implication. Apart from that, they have not\n\nexamined any defence witness on their behalf. They have exhibited\n\nfour documents i.e. application written by police for postmortem of the\n\ndeceased (Ex.D-1), Rojnamchasanha (Ex.D-2). Subsequently police\n\nstatement recorded 161\nCr.P.C\n. of Gajendra and Gopichand Sahu has\n\nalso been marked as Ex. D-1 & D-2.\n\n7. The trial Court after appreciating oral and documentary\n\nevidence on record, vide its impugned judgement convicted the\n\nappellant under Sections 302 read with\nSection 34\nof the IPC and\n\nawarded death sentence, as mentioned in the opening paragraph of\n\nthis judgment and further, made reference to this Court for\n\nconfirmation of death sentence awarded to the appellants/accused.\n\n8. The learned trial Court in order to convict the appellants herein\n\nhas found proved the following facts: -\n\n➢ There are five eye witnesses to the incident namely Ramjag\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 10 -\n\nSahu (PW-2), Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3), Ganesh Ram Patel\n\n(PW-7), Rajendra (PW-8) and Gajendra Kumar Sahu (PW-9),\n\nwho have seen the appellants assaulting deceased Bhagwat\n\nSahu by means of sharp edged weapon (Katta) and even when\n\nGopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) & Gajendra Kumar Sahu (PW-9) tried\n\nto intervene, then appellants also run towards them to kill them.\n\n➢ After commission of incident, appellants recorded their versions\n\nabout causing / committing murder of Bhagwat Sahu in mobile\n\nphone of appellant - Sunil and they themselves viral it through\n\nsocial media, which was received also by Gopi Chand Sahu\n\n(PW-3) in his mobile and that mobile video was retrieved from\n\nmobile of Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3), which has been proved by\n\nthe prosecution.\n\n➢ Incident was recorded in CCTV camera situated in the house of\n\nDev Prasad Sahu (PW-12) and its footage was retrieved in pen\n\ndrive, which has also been proved by the prosecution and both\n\nthe videos i.e. retrieved in CD (Article A-2) and Pen drive (Article\n\nA-1) also proved that murder of Bhagwat Sahu by both the\n\nappellants.\n\n➢ Articles i.e. blood stained clothes seized from both the\n\nappellants, sharp edged weapon seized from appellant Sohit\n\nand electric tester & knife seized from Sunil are containing blood\n\nstained.\n\n➢ Appellants have committed crime in a most cruel and inhuman\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 11 -\n\nmanner, which is an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical,\n\nrevolting and dastardly manner, where their act affects the entire\n\nfibre of the Society, therefore, crime committed by accused\n\npersons is in the category of 'the rarest of rare case'.\n\n9. Feeling aggrieved with the impugned judgment of conviction &\n\norder of sentence awarded to the appellants, they have preferred\n\nCriminal Appeal Nos. 1625 of 2022 & 1864 of 2022, respectively under\n\nSection 374(2)\nof the CrPC challenging their conviction for the\n\naforesaid offences, particularly against the capital punishment\n\nawarded to them. However, the learned Additional Sessions Judge in\n\ncompliance with the provisions contained in\nSection 366(1)\nof the\n\nCrPC, submitted the sentence of death to this Court for confirmation\n\nand this is how the appellants alongwith reference have been clubbed\n\ntogether, heard together and are being disposed of by this common\n\njudgment.\n\n10. Mr. Ravindra Sharma, Mr. Vineek Kumar Pandey & Mr. Sumit\n\nJhanwar, learned counsel appearing for the accused/appellants would\n\nsubmit that deceased in the instant case is Bhagwat Sahu and all the\n\nsubstantive witnesses including eye-witnesses in the instant case, are\n\nrelative of deceased, as they are of same caste \"lkgw\", therefore, it\n\ncannot be ruled out that alleged eye-witnesses are concocted. He\n\nwould further submit that appellants have been falsely implicated in\n\nthe case only because there was some dispute between the\n\nappellants and the deceased with regard to sale consideration of the\n\nland, which was allegedly sold through the deceased. It is further\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 12 -\n\nsubmitted that alleged video footage collected from mobile of\n\nGopichand Sahu and CCTV camera situated in the house of Dev\n\nPrasad Sahu (PW-12) are also concocted. Alleged CCTV footage was\n\nnot reliable, as there was difference of time of incident and time\n\nrecorded in CCTV footage. They would further submit that the\n\nprosecution has failed to prove that alleged articles seized from the\n\nappellants are contained human blood, only finding blood in articles\n\ncannot prove that, it was of deceased person or any particular person.\n\nFurther, there are various discrepancies in the evidence adduced by\n\nthe prosecution particularly with regard to number of injuries inflicted\n\nto the deceased in an occular and medical evidence adduced by the\n\nprosecution, Hence, it is prayed that appeals may be allowed and\n\nrelief, as sought for, may be granted to the appellants. Both the\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the appellants would further submit\n\nthat, for the sake of argument if it is found that appellants have\n\ncommitted alleged crime, despite that it is a case of single murder\n\nonly, that too, as per prosecution itself appellants, being poor villages,\n\nsold their land through deceased but the sale consideration was not\n\ngiven to them, hence, considering the fact situation of the case and\n\nlaw laid down by the Apex Court, it cannot be said that it is a case of\n\n\"rarest of rare\" but learned trial Court being over-sensitive has\n\nawarded capital punishment, without affording opportunity of hearing\n\nto the appellants to adduce evidence on the question of sentence,\n\nparticularly, in respect of rehabilitation and reformation of the accused\n\nand the State has also not proved such facts against the appellants,\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 13 -\n\ntherefore, capital punishment awarded to the appellants is liable to be\n\ncommuted to life sentence, in case, this Court comes to the\n\nconclusion and records finding that offence under\nSection 302\nof IPC\n\nestablished beyond doubt by the prosecution, as such, the reference\n\nbe rejected and appeals be allowed by setting aside impugned\n\njugdment of the trial Court convicting the appellants under\nSection 302\n\nof the IPC and sentencing them with capital punishment, as stated\n\nabove.\n\n11. Per contra, Mrs. Madhunisha Singh, learned Deputy Advocate\n\nGeneral for the State would submit that case of the prosecution is fully\n\nrest on the deposition of five eye-witnesses to the incident, who have\n\nunequivocally supported the case of the prosecution. It is further\n\nsubmitted that although some of the eye-witnesses are belonging to\n\nthe caste of deceased, but only on that ground, their deposition cannot\n\nbe discarded. Further after commission of crime, appellants had\n\nrecorded their versions in the mobile phone of appellant - Sunil, and\n\nthey themselves viral it through social media, which was retrieved\n\nfrom the mobile phone of Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) and live incident\n\nwas also recorded in the CCTV camera situated in the house of Dev\n\nPrasad Sahu (PW-12), which was retrieved in Pen Drive and both\n\nfootages were seen in the court during trial in presence of\n\nInvestigating Officer, accused persons and their counsels, which has\n\nbeen discussed in detail by the learned trial Court, likewise, blood\n\nstained clothes and weapons were also seized from appellants, which\n\nhas been proved by the prosecution. Thus, aforesaid electronic\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 14 -\n\nevidence and FSL report also support the deposition of eye-witnesses\n\nthat appellants are the persons, who committed murder of deceased -\n\nBhawgwat Sahu, hence, it is prayed that impugned judgment passed\n\nby the trial Court is well merited, which does not call for any\n\ninterference of this Court.\n\n12 . We have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered\n\ntheir rival submissions made herein-above and also went through the\n\nrecord of the trial Court thoroughly and extensively.\n\n13. Instant case of the prosecution rests in three sets of evidence;\n\nfirstly eye-witness account, secondly circumstantial evidence i.e.\n\nseizure of blood stained weapons and clothes from the appellants at\n\nthe behest of their memorandum statement; thirdly Electronic\n\nEvidence.\n\n14. Learned trial Court has held in the impugned judgment that\n\nprosecution has proved those evidence against the appellants and\n\nrelying on the same has convicted them.\n\n15. Prem Lal Sahu (PW-1), who is father of deceased - Bhagwat\n\nSahu, has deposed in his court statement that after receiving\n\ninformation over phone from Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) that the\n\nappellants are assaulting his son Bhagwat Sahu by means of sharp\n\nedged weapon (Katta)on his head and neck, he immediately rush to\n\nthe spot where he saw the dead body of his son. He has also proved\n\nthat he lodged un-numbered merg report (Ex.P-1), Dehati Nalishi\n\n(Ex.P-2) and FIR (Ex.P-6), which are well supported by Ravindra\n\nKumar Anant (PW-13), who recorded aforesaid documents.\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 15 -\n\n16. Ravindra Kumar Anant (PW-13), who is the Investigating Officer\n\nof the case, has proved in his deposition that after preparation of\n\ninquest request (Ex.P-5), he sent dead body of deceased for\n\npostmortem to CHC, Shivrinarayan where Dr. Anvita Dhruw (PW-5)\n\nconducted postmortem over dead body of the deceased. As per\n\npostmortem report (Ex.P-16), which has been proved by Dr. Anvita\n\nDhruw (PW-5), she has found following injuries on the person of the\n\ndeceased :-\n\n(i) An incised wound measuring 15 x 3 inches cutting\n\nthe neck, only 4 inches of neck was remained intact.\n\n(ii) An incised wound measuring 4 x1 inches over right\n\nclavicular region.\n\n(iii) An incised wound measuring 7 x 1 inches below\n\nclavicular region.\n\n(iv) An incised wound measuring 7 X1 inches over\n\nright side of the chest.\n\n(iv) An incised wound measuring 12 x 5 inches from\n\nleft chin to left external pinna.\n\n(v) Bandage over left foot, found old healed abrasion.\n\n17. Thus, the postmortem report (Ex.P-16) itself shows that neck of\n\nthe deceased was almost chopped and only left 4 inches was\n\nremained intact. Dr. Anvita Dhruw (PW-5) has further opined that\n\ncause of death was excessive haemorrhage due to cutting of neck\n\nand major blood vessels of neck, she has also opined that nature of\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 16 -\n\ndeath is homicidal. The manner in which, almost whole neck of\n\ndeceased was chopped brutally and Doctor has opined that nature of\n\ndeath of deceased is homicidal, we are of the considered view that\n\nlearned trial Court has rightly held proved that death of deceased\n\nBhhagwat Sahu is homicidal, hence, we affirmed the aforesaid finding\n\nof fact recorded by the trial Court.\n\n18. Now, the next question for consideration would be whether the\n\naccused-appellants herein are the perpetrator of causing homicidal\n\ndeath of deceased ?\n\n19. In this regard, as has been stated above that case of the\n\nprosecution rests in three sets of evidence i.e. direct evidence of eye-\n\nwitnesses, circumstantial evidence i.e. memorandum and seizure of\n\nblood stained clothes & weapons, and electronic evidence.\n\nDirect evidence / Eye-witnesses account\n\n20. Ramjag Sahu (PW-2), Gopichand Sahu (PW-3), Ganesh Ram\n\nPatel (PW-7), Rajendra (PW-8) & Ganendra Kumar Sahu (PW-09) are\n\nthe eye-witnesses to the incident.\n\n21. Ramjag Sahu (PW2) has deposed in his court statement that\n\nwhen he came from Raipur to his house, then he saw that in-front of\n\nhis house, appellants assaulting deceased Bhgawat Sahu. He has\n\nalso stated that appellant Sohit was assaulting upon the deceased by\n\nmeans of Katta (sharp edged weapon). He has also stated that when\n\nGajendra Kumar Sahu (PW-9) and Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) went\n\nthere and tried to intervene, then appellants also run towards them to\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 17 -\n\nassault them. Hence, they run away. In cross-examination, although\n\nhe has admitted that at the time of incident, he was not knowing the\n\nappellants by their names, but this could not be a ground to discard\n\nhis whole statement, rather suggestion taken from him in\n\nparagraph 6 that after assaulting neck of deceased by Katta, he fell\n\ndown, which this witness has admitted. This fact also corroborates his\n\ndeposition that he was present on the spot and has seen the incident.\n\n22. Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) & Gajendra Kumar Sahu (PW-9) have\n\nstated in their deposition recorded before the trial Court that at the\n\ntime of incident, there was corona vaccination programme was going\n\non, in the Government School, hence, they were sitting there and the\n\ndeceased was also present there. Gopichand Sahu (PW-3) has stated\n\nthat on being received phone call, deceased - Bhagwat Sahu went\n\nfrom there and after sometime, they listen scream and they went\n\nthere, then they saw that appellants were assaulting the deceased. He\n\nhas also stated that appellant - Sohit was assaulting the deceased by\n\nsharp edged weapon (Katta) whereas appellant Sunil was holding the\n\ndeceased and when they tried to intervene, the appellants tried to\n\nassault also to them, hence, they run away from the spot.\n\n23. Ganesh Ram Patel (PW-7) has also stated in his deposition\n\nthat he alongwith deceased and various other persons were present in\n\nthe Vaccination Centre, deceased went from there and after\n\nsometime, after hearing scream, he saw that appellants are assaulting\n\nthe deceased by means of katta & screw-driver.\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 18 -\n\n24. Rajendra (PW-8), who is also eye-witness to the incident, has\n\nstated in his deposition that after listening scream, when he went\n\nbehind his house, then, he saw that both the appellants were\n\nassaulting the deceased. He has also stated that appellant - Sohit\n\nwas assaulting the deceased by katta (sharp edged weapon) on his\n\nneck whereas appellant Sunil was holding his both the hands. He has\n\nalso stated that, at that time appellant Sohit Kewat was asking Sunil\n\nKenwat that \"ejhl /ku ugh js (vFkkZr~ ejk ;k ugha/ died or not)\". He has also\n\nstated that Ramjag Sahu (PW-2) was also witnessing from the gate of\n\nhis house. He has denied the suggestion that appellants had\n\nassaulted 30-40 times, but he has stated that he has seen only 2 - 3\n\nassaults. The manner in which, this witness has cross-examined does\n\nnot rebut his statements made in examination-in-chief that he is the\n\neye-witness to the incident, rather he has further stated in cross-\n\nexamination that after committing murder of deceased, appellants\n\nclimbed over the water tank, from where the police bring them down,\n\nwhich has also been corroborated by Investigating Officer Ravindra\n\nKumar Anant (PW-13) in para 4 of this deposition.\n\n25. Thus, aforesaid eye-witnesses to the incident have clearly\n\nstated that the appellants are the persons, who assaulted the\n\ndeceased by means of katta (sharp edged weapon) and in that\n\nincident, appellant Sohit chopped the neck of deceased by means of\n\nkatta and appellant Sunil also played active role in commission of\n\nalleged murder by assaulting and holding the deceased.\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 19 -\n\n26. Although, there are some discrepancies in the statements of the\n\neye witnesses particularly with regard to the factum and manner of\n\nassault and at that time appellant Sunil was holding his (deceased)\n\nhands or not ? But, the trial Court has rightly considered this aspect in\n\nparagraphs 27 & 28 of its judgment that presence of all the eye-\n\nwitnesses on the spot and witnessing the commission of crime by\n\naccused persons is not under dispute as they have not challenged\n\ntheir presence on the spot and witnessing the commission of crime\n\neither by cross-examination or by putting any suggestion during their\n\nrespective cross-examination. Learned trial Court has also rightly held\n\nthat different witnesses may watch the occurrence at different point of\n\ntime, when accused persons are in different role and when appellant\n\nSunil might had assaulting the deceased at one point of time and\n\nholding his hand at different point of time and standing at different\n\ntime, which was seen by eye-witnesses in different point of times,\n\ntherefore, alleged contradictions cannot be termed as vital to discard\n\ndeposition of eye witnesses.\n\n27. Learned counsel appearing for the appellants argued that\n\ndeceased and most of the eye witnesses to the incident are of a\n\nperson of same caste, hence, they are concocted and, as such, their\n\nevidence is not reliable.\n\n28. It is well settled principle of law that evidence of a \"related\n\nwitnesses\" cannot be discarded only on the ground of relationship.\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 20 -\n\n29. The Supreme Court in the case of\nRupinder Singh Sandhu\n\nVs. State of Punjab and others\nreported in (2018) 16 SCC 475 has\n\nheld as under :-\n\n\"50. The fact that Pws 3 and 4 are related to the\n\ndeceased Gurnam Singh is not in dispute. The\n\nexistence of such relationship by itself does not\n\nrender the evidence of Pws 3 and 4 untrustworthy.\n\nThis Court has repeatedly held so and also held that\n\nthe related witnesses are less likely to implicate\n\ninnocent persons exonerating the real culprits.\"\n\n30. The Supreme Court in case of\nShamim v. State (Government of\n\nNCT of Delhi\n), reported in (2018) 10 SCC 509 has held as under :-\n\n\"9. In a criminal trial, normally the evidence of the\n\nwife, husband, son or daughter of the deceased, is\n\ngiven great weightage on the principle that there is\n\nno reason for them not to speak the truth and shield\n\nthe real culprit.........\"\n\n31. The Supreme Court in case of\nRizan and another v. State of\n\nChhattisgarh\nthrough the Chief Secretary, Govt. of\n\nChhattisgarh , Raipur, Chhattisgarh reported in (2003) 2 SCC 661\n\nhas held as under :-\n\n\"6. We shall first deal with the contention regarding\n\ninterestedness of the witnesses for furthering\n\nprosecution version. Relationship is not a factor to affect\n\ncredibility of a witness. It is more often than not that a\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 21 -\n\nrelation would not conceal actual culprit and make\n\nallegations against an innocent person. Foundation has\n\nto be laid if plea of false implication is made......\"\n\n32. In the instant case, although some of eye witnesses to the incident\n\nare of the same caste of deceased but Ganesh Ram Patel (PW-7) &\n\nRajendra (PW-8) are not of the caste of deceased. Further, only\n\nbecause of having same caste, statements of the eye- witnesses\n\ncannot be discarded assuming therein that they are \"related\n\nwitnesses\". If it is supposed for the sake of argument, then question\n\narise that as to why \"related witnesses\" would spare the real culprit in\n\norder to falsly implicate some innocent person ? Further, there is\n\ndifference between \"related witnesses\" and \"interested witnesses\".\n\n\"Interested witness\" is a witness, who is vitally interested in conviction\n\nof a person due to previous enmity.\n\n33. \"An Interest witness\" has been defined by the Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of\nMohd. Rojali Ali and others Vs. State of Assam ,\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs Through Secretary\nreported in (2019) 19\n\nSCC 567 and held as under:-\n\n\"10. As regards the contention that all the eye-\n\nwitnesses are close relatives of the deceased, it is\n\nby now well settled that a related witness cannot be\n\nsaid to be an 'interested' witness merely by virtue of\n\nbeing a relative of the victim. This Court has\n\nelucidated the difference between 'interested' and\n\n'related' witnesses in a plethora of cases, stating\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 22 -\n\nthat a witness may be called interested only when\n\nhe or she derives some benefit from the result of a\n\nlitigation, which in the context of a criminal case\n\nwould mean that the witness has a direct or indirect\n\ninterest in seeing the accused punished due to\n\nprior enmity or other reasons, and thus has a\n\nmotive to falsely implicate the accused ......\"\n\n34. This difference has further been reiterated by the Apex Court in\n\nthe case of Ganpati v. State of Tamilnadu 1 by referring to 3-judges\n\nbench decision in\nState of Rajasthan vs. Kalki\n2.\n\n35. As has been stated above that in the instant case some of the\n\neye-witnesses namely Ramjag Sahu (PW-2), Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3)\n\n& Gajendra Kumar Sahu (PW-9) belonged to caste of the deceased,\n\nbut only on this count, their deposition cannot be held untrusworthy.\n\nFurthermore, there are other eye witnesses belonging to the different\n\ncaste, hence, contention putforth by learned counsel for the appellants\n\nto disbelieve the deposition of eye witnesses are not sustainable.\n\nMemorandum statement and seizure of clothes & weapon\nfrom the appellants.\n\n36. It has been proved by the Investigating Officer Ravindra Kumar\n\nAnant (PW-13) & Dhannu Ram Sahu (PW-11) that on the basis of\n\nmemorandum statement (Ex.P-19) of appellant - Sunil, one blood\n\nstained tester, one knife used for cutting vegetables, one sweater (blue\n\ncolour), full pant, which he was wearing and one mobile of OPPO\n\n1 Criminal Appeal Nos. 1312 of 2008 & 1313 of 2008\n2 1981 SCC (2) 752\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 23 -\n\ncompany A -55 was seized from him vide Ex.P-18. It has further been\n\nproved by aforesaid witnesses that on the basis of memorandum\n\nstatement (Ex.P-20) of appellant - Sohit, one sharp edged weapon of\n\niron \"Katta\" , jeans pant, full pant, tea shirt, which he was wearing during\n\nincident and one mobile A-54 of Oppo company was seized from him\n\nvide Ex.P-17.\n\n37. FSL report (Ex.29) shows that clothes of deceased, which were\n\nseized, from Constable vide Ex.P-25, contains human blood except\n\nplain soil (marked as \"A\"). It has been reported in FSL report that\n\nhuman blood was found in Katta (\"D\") & jeans pant (\"E\") seized from the\n\nappellant - Sohit and human blood was also reported to be found in\n\nelectronic tester (H), knife (I), Sweater (J-1) and full pant (J-2) seized\n\nfrom appellant Sunil. Since blood group could not have been reported\n\nin FSL report / serological report, therefore, learned trial Court has held\n\nthat since group of human blood on Article B, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, D, E,\n\nH, I, J1 & J2 has not found to be reported, therefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat blood found on aforesaid articles are of the deceased. Learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants supported aforesaid finding of learned trial\n\nCourt and stated that in absence of serological report, vide those\n\narticles, appellants cannot be connected in the commission of instant\n\ncrime.\nIn this regard, counsel for the appellants relied upon the decision\n\nof the Supreme Court in the matter of Sattatiya alias\nSatish Rajanna\n\nKartalla v. State of Maharashtra\n3 (2008) 3 SCC 210\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 24 -\n\n38.\nIn Sattatiya alias\nSatish Rajanna Kartalla\n(supra), the two-\n\nJudges Bench of the Supreme Court has held that as per the chemical\n\nexaminer's report the bloodstains found on the shirt, pants and half\n\nblade were those of human blood, the same could not be linked with the\n\nblood of the deceased and thereby there was serious lacuna in the\n\nprosecution story.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, in\nBalwan Singh Vs.\n\nState of Chhattisgarh and another\n4 (three-Judges Bench), has\n\nconsidered the decision in Sattatiya alias\nSatish Rajanna Kartalla\n\n(supra) in paragraph 12 of its report and also noticed the Constitution\n\nBench decision in the matter of\nRaghav Prapanna Tripathi v. State of\n\nU.P.\n5 and summarised the law relating to effect of failure to establish\n\norigin of blood as being of human origin and/or its blood group and held\n\nthat the same has to be ascertained in the facts and circumstances of\n\neach case, and there is no fixed formula for the same.\n\nIt has been\n\nobserved in paragraphs 15, 16, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the report -\n\nBalwan Singh\n(supra) as under: -\n\n\"15. We are also conscious of the fact that, at times, it\nmay be very difficult for the serologist to detect the origin of\nthe blood due to the disintegration of the serum, or\ninsufficiency of bloodstains, or haematological changes,\netc. In such situations, the court, using its judicious mind,\nmay deny the benefit of doubt to the accused, depending\non the facts and circumstances of each case, if other\nevidence of the prosecution is credible and if reasonable\ndoubt does not arise in the mind of the court about the\ninvestigation.\n\n16. Thus, in\nR. Shaji v. State of Kerala\n6, this Court had\nobserved:\n\n4 (2019) 7 SCC 781\n5 AIR 1963 SC 74\n6 (2013) 14 SCC 266\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 25 -\n\n\"31. A failure by the serologist to detect the origin of\nthe blood due to disintegration of the serum does not\nmean that the blood stuck on the axe could not have\nbeen human blood at all. Sometimes it is possible,\neither because the stain is insufficient in itself, or due\nto haematological changes and plasmatic coagulation,\nthat a serologist may fail to detect the origin of the\nblood in question. However, in such a case, unless\nthe doubt is of a reasonable dimension which a\njudicially conscientious mind may entertain with some\nobjectivity, no benefit can be claimed by the accused\nin this regard. Once the recovery is made in\npursuance of a disclosure statement made by the\naccused, the matching or non-matching of blood\ngroup(s) loses significance.\"\n\n(emphasis in original)\n\n20. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the\naccused would be in a disadvantageous position in case if\nthe aforementioned dictum\nlaid down by\nthis Court in R.\nShaji, Gura Singh7, Jagroop Singh8 and Teja Ram9 relating\nto the bloodstains is applied in each and every case. Non-\nconfirmation of blood-group or origin of the blood may\nassume importance in cases where the accused pleads a\ndefence or alleges mala fides on the part of the\nprosecution, or accuses the prosecution of fabricating the\nevidence to wrongly implicate him in the commission of the\ncrime.\n\n21.\nIn\nJohn Pandian v. State10\n, this Court, on facts,\nobserved that the evidence of recovery of weapons was\ncredible. The forensic science laboratory (FSL) report had\ndisclosed that the blood was of human origin. The Court\nproceeded to conclude that since the evidence of recovery\nof weapon was proved to the satisfaction of the Court, it\nwas sufficient that the prosecution had proved that the\nbloodstains were of human origin, even though the blood\ngroup could not be ascertained.\n\n22. The cases discussed above highlight the burden that\nthe prosecution would ordinarily have to discharge,\nGura Singh v. State of Rajasthan\n, (2001) 2 SCC 205\n8 Jagroop Singh v. State of Punjab, (\n2012) 11 SCC 768\n9 State of Rajasthan v. Teja Ram\n, (1999) 3 SCC 507\n10 (2010) 14 SCC 129\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 26 -\n\ndepending on the other facts and circumstances of the\ncase, for the evidence relating to recovery to be considered\nagainst the accused. At the same time, as mentioned\nabove, we are conscious of the fact that it may not always\nbe possible to inextricably link the bloodstains on the items\nseized in recovery to the blood of the deceased, due to the\npossibility of disintegration of bloodstains on account of the\ntime-lapse in carrying out the recovery. For this reason, in\n\nPrabhu Dayal v. State of Rajasthan\n11, where one of us\n(Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J.) had the occasion to author\nthe judgment, this Court, relying on Teja Ram, had held that\nthe failure to determine the blood group of the bloodstains\ncollected from the scene of offence would not prove fatal to\nthe case of the prosecution.\n\nIn\nPrabhu Dayal\ncase,\nalthough the FSL report could not determine the blood\ngroup of the bloodstains on account of disintegration, the\nreport clearly disclosed that the bloodstains were of human\norigin, and the chain of circumstantial evidence was\ncompleted by the testimonies of the other witnesses as well\nas the reports submitted by the ballistic expert and the\nforensic science laboratory regarding the weapon used to\ncommit murder.\n\n23. From the aforementioned discussion, we can\nsummarise that if the recovery of bloodstained articles is\nproved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution, and if\nthe investigation was not found to be tainted, then it may be\nsufficient if the prosecution shows that the blood found on\nthe articles is of human origin though, even though the\nblood group is not proved because of disintegration of\nblood. The Court will have to come to the conclusion\nbased on the facts and circumstances of each case, and\nthere cannot be any fixed formula that the prosecution has\nto prove, or need not prove, that the blood groups match.\"\n\n39. Reverting to the facts of the instant case, it is apparent that in the\n\ninstant case, there are so many eye-witnesses, who have proved in their\n\ndeposition that they have seen committing murder of deceased by both\n11 (2018) 8 SCC 127\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 27 -\n\nthe appellants and it has also been proved by the prosecution that human\n\nblood stained weapon, clothes and other articles have been seized at the\n\nbehest of the appellants. It has also been proved by Rajendra (PW-8) and\n\nRavindra Anant (PW-13) that after killing deceased, appellants were\n\nclimed on water tank, from where they were got down by the police and\n\nother officials and, thereafter, at their behest blood staind clothes and\n\nweapons were seized from them, just within 4- 5 hours of the incident, till\n\nthat, they were well within the site of the villagers. Therefore, considering\n\naforesaid facts and the principles of law\nlaid down in\n\nBalwan Singh\n\n(Supra), since FSL report (Ex.P-29) has clearly disclosed that blood\n\nstained weapons and clothes have been seized from the appellants i.e.\n\nKatta (D), jeans pant (E), seized from appellant - Sohit whereas electronic\n\ntester (H), knife (I), sweater (J1) and full pant (J2) seized from appellant\n\nSunil, therefore, FSL report very well support the deposition of eye-\n\nwitnesses that they caused murder of deceased and, therefore, in light of\n\nlaw\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in the case of\nBalwan Singh\n(Supra), non\n\n- cofirmation of blood group would not be fatal to the prosecution case as\n\nheld by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the case of\nJohn\n\nPandian\n(supra).\n\n40. In view of the foregoing discussion, we set-aside the observation\n\nmade by learned trial Court that FSL report (Ex.P-29) is not helpful to the\n\ncase of the prosecution and held that it also supports the deposition of\n\neye-witnesses to the incident that the appellants are the perpetrator of the\n\ncrime and they caused murder of the deceased.\n\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 28 -\n\nElectronic Evidence\n\n41. Ravind Kumar Anant (PW-13), who is Investigating Officer of the\n\ncase, has stated in his deposition that the incident was recorded in CCTV\n\ncamera situated in the house of Dev Prasad Sahu (PW-12) and with the\n\nhelp of Vikki Kaiwart (PW-4), footage of incident was retrieved in pen-\n\ndrive from the receiver of aforesaid CCTV by giving Notice under\nSection\nof Cr.P.C. (Ex.P-21) to Dev Prasad Sahu (PW-12). This fact has also\n\nbeen proved by Vikki Kaiwartya (PW-4) & Dev Prasad Sahu (PW-12).\n\nAforesaid pen-drive was seized vide Ex.P-14 from Dev Prasad Sahu\n\n(PW-12) and the said pen drive has been marked as Article A-1.\n\n42. After commission of murder of deceased, appellants have suited a\n\nVideo from mobile phone of accused/appellant - Sunil Kumar i.e. Article\n\nA-3 and viral the same on social media. In that video, they have\n\nconfessed the murder of Bhagwat Sahu. Through social media, that\n\nconfessional statement was also reached in the mobile phone of Gopi\n\nChand Sahu (PW-3) and during course of investigation, that video was\n\ndown loaded in Compact Disk (CD) and that CD was seized vide seizure\n\nmemo (Ex.P-12) by Investigating Officer - Ravindra Kumar Anant\n\n(PW-13). Aforesaid facts have been proved by Investigating Officer\n\nRavindra Kumar Anant (PW-13), Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) and Ganesh\n\nRam Patel (PW-7) also. That 'CD' has been marked as Article A-2.\n\n43. Aforesaid articles i.e. Pen Drive (Article A-1) & CD (Article A-2)\n\nhave been seized by collecting certificate from concerned person in\n\ncompliance of\nSection 65-B\nof the Evidence Act. This fact has also been\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 29 -\n\nproved by Vikki Kaiwart (PW-4) and Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3), who gave\n\naforesaid certificate.\n\n44. Learned trial Court has discussed about electronic evidences\n\nadduced by prosecution in detail in para 35 to 48 of the impugned\n\njudgment, particularly, with regard to Pen Drive (Article A-1) and CD\n\n(Article A-2).\n\n45. In paragraph 42 of the judgment, learned trial Court has observed\n\nthat during trial, aforesaid articles i.e. Article-1, Article-2 alongwith mobile\n\nphone of accused Sunil Kewat Article-3 & Mobile phone of accused Sohit\n\nKewat Article-7 were played in the Court in presence of accused\n\npersons, their counsel & Investigating Officer Ravindra Anant (PW-13)\n\nand after watching the same, Investigating Officer - Ravindra Kumar\n\nAnant (PW-13) has specifically stated that the person assaulting with\n\nkatta is accused Sohit and other assailant is accused Sunil Kewat. In\n\nthis regard, specific question was put to both the accused/appellants in\n\ntheir statements under\nSection 313\nof Cr.P.C., but they have simply\n\nstated that the video is fabricated. Although some difference of time of\n\nincident, as has been recorded in CCTV footage and as has been\n\nprojected in the case of prosecution, is pointed out by learned defence\n\ncounsel, but it is not found to be vital to discard aforesaid evidence, as\n\ndue to technical glitch, power-cut, etc. setting of time got disturbed in\n\nsuch electronic devices.\n\n46. As has been stated above that, learned trial Court has discussed in\n\ndetail in paragraphs 35 to 48 of its judgment with regard to aforesaid\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 30 -\n\nelectronic evidence and its contents. After having due consideration, We\n\naffirmed the finding of learned trial Court that aforesaid electronic\n\nevidence also support the deposition of eye witnesses to the incident that\n\nthe appellants are the persons, who caused brutal murder of deceased\n\nby chopping his neck including vital blood vessels and due to such\n\nassault, only about some portion of his neck was left intact with the body\n\nof deceased.\n\n47. Eye witnesses to the incident deposed that appellant Sohit\n\nchopped the neck of deceased by sharp edged weapon katta and as per\n\ndeposition of Ramjag Sahu (PW-2), Gopi Chand Sahu (PW-3) and\n\nRajendra (PW-8) while assaulting by appellant Sohit, appellant Sunil was\n\nholding the deceased. Ganesh Ram Patel (PW-7) has also deposed that\n\ndeceased was also assaulted by screw-driver (Pechkas) [Tester], blood\n\nstained such devices have been seized from appellant Sunil. Thus,\n\nthese facts specifically proved full and active involvement of appellant\n\nSunil Kumar in commission of murder of deceased.\n\n48. Thus, after appreciating the entire occular, electronic and seizure /\n\ncircumstantial evidence alongwith other documents available on record,\n\nwe do not find any illegality or infirmity in appreciation of evidence\n\navailable on record or arriving at a conclusion as to the guilt of appellants\n\nby learned trial Court that both the appellants are the perpetrator of\n\ncausing brutal murder of deceased Bhagwat Sahu. Hence, finding\n\nrecorded by learned trial Court in this regard does not warrant\n\ninterference of this Court. We accordingly herein affirm the conviction of\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 31 -\n\nthe appellants recorded under Section 302 read with\nSection 34\nof the\n\nIPC.\n\n49. Now the next question to be considered is that, whether capital\n\npunishment awarded by learned Additional Sessions Judge to the\n\nappellants that they be hanged to death, till their death is in accordance\n\nwith settled principle of law ?\n\n50. In this regard, it is to be considered that whether this case falls\n\nunder the category of \"rarest of rare case\" justifying capital punishment ?\n\n51. For the offence of murder only sentence provided in\nSection 302\nof\n\nIPC are death penalty or imprisonment for life.\n\n52. Their Lordships of the Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of judgments\n\nhave laid down principles for awarding capital punishment, for which,\n\nbalance between aggravating circumstances and mitigating\n\ncircumstances has to be struck. Whereas other factors have also to be\n\ntaken into consideration like age of accused, possibility of reformation\n\nand lack of intention of murder, etc.\n\n53. For awarding such punishment, law also requires from the Courts to\n\nassign special reason in accordance with sub-section (3) of\nSection 354\nof\n\nthe CrPC, which reads as under :-\n\n\"S. 354 (3): When the conviction is for an offence\n\npunishable with death or, in the alternative, with\n\nimprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of\n\nyears, the judgment shall state the reasons for the\n\nsentence awarded, and, in the case of sentence of\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 32 -\n\ndeath, the special reasons for such sentence.\"\n\n54. The provisions of\nSection 354 (3)\nof the CrPC specifically\n\nenvisazed the legislative concerned and the conditions which needs to\n\nbe satisfied prior to imposition of capital punishment. The words 'in case\n\nof sentence of death, special reason for such sentence' unambiguously\n\ndemonstrate the commands of legislature that such reasons have to be\n\nrecorded for imposing punishment of death sentence i.e. the Court is\n\nrequired to hold that it is a case of 'rarest of rare' warranting imposition\n\nof only death sentence.\n\n55. The Supreme Court in the matter of\nManoj and others v. State\n\nof Madhya Pradesh12\nreviewing the entire case laws on the point\n\nbeginning from\nBachan Singh\n(supra) held in paragraph 204 as under: -\n\n\"204. Mitigating factors in general, rather than excuse or\nvalidate the crime committed, seek to explain the surrounding\ncircumstances of the criminal to enable the judge to decide\nbetween the death penalty or life imprisonment. An illustrative\nlist of indicators first recognised in Bachan Singh 11 itself:\n\n\"Mitigating circumstances.--In the exercise of its discretion in\nthe above cases, the court shall take into account the following\ncircumstances:\n\n(1) That the offence was committed under the influence of\nextreme mental or emotional disturbance.\n\n(2) The age of the accused. If the accused is young or old, he\nshall not be sentenced to death.\n\n(3) The probability that the accused would not commit criminal\nacts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to\nsociety.\n\n12 2023 (2) SCC 353\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 33 -\n\n(4) The probability that the accused can be reformed and\nrehabilitated. The State shall by evidence prove that the\naccused does not satisfy the conditions (3) and (4) above.\n\n(5) That in the facts and circumstances of the case the\naccused believed that he was morally justified in committing\nthe offence.\n\n(6) That the accused acted under the duress or domination of\nanother person.\n\n(7) That the condition of the accused showed that he was\nmentally defective and that the said defect impaired his\ncapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.\"\n\nThese are hardly exhaustive; subsequently, this court in\nseveral judgments has recognised, and considered\ncommutation to life imprisonment, on grounds such as young\nage13, socio-economic conditions14, mental illness15, criminal\nantecedents16, as relevant indicators on the questions of\nsentence. Many of these factors reflect demonstrable ability or\nmerely the possibility even, of the accused to reform (i.e. (3)\nand (4) of the Bachan Singh list), which make them important\nindicators when it comes to sentencing.\"\n\nTheir Lordships further emphasised the need for pre-sentence\n\nhearing - opportunity and obligation to provide material on the\n\naccused and in paragraphs 211 and 212 held as under: -\n\n\"211. However, this too, is too little, too late and only offers\na peek into the circumstances of the accused after\nconviction. The unfortunate reality is that in the absence of\nwell-documented mitigating circumstances at the trial\nlevel, the aggravating circumstances seem far more\ncompelling, or overwhelming, rendering the sentencing\ncourt prone to imposing the death penalty, on the basis of\nMahesh Dhanaji Shinde v. State of Maharashtra\n(2014) 4 SCC 292, Gurvail Singh v. State of\nPunjab (2013) 2 SCC 713, etc.\nMulla and another v. State of U.P.\n(2010) 3 SCC 508;\nKamleshwar Paswan v. U.T.

State of Maharashtra\n, (2010) 1 SCC 775\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 34 -\n\nan incomplete, and hence, incorrect application of the\nBachan Singh test.\n\n212. The goal of reformation is ideal, and what society\nmust strive towards - there are many references to it\npeppered in this court's jurisprudence across the decades\n\n- but what is lacking is a concrete framework that can\nmeasure and evaluate it. Unfortunately, this is mirrored by\nthe failure to implement prison reforms of a meaningful\nkind, which has left the process of incarceration and\nprisons in general, to be a space of limited potential for\nsystemic reformation. The goal of reformative punishment\nrequires systems that actively enable reformation and\nrehabilitation, as a result of nuanced policy making. As a\nsmall step to correct these skewed results and facilitate\nbetter evaluation of whether there is a possibility for the\naccused to be reformed (beyond vague references to\nconduct, family background, etc.), this court deems it\nnecessary to frame practical guidelines for the courts to\nadopt and implement, till the legislature and executive,\nformulate a coherent framework through legislation.\nThese guidelines may also offer guidance or ideas, that\nsuch a legislative framework could benefit from, to\nsystematically collect and evaluate information on\nmitigating circumstances.\"\n\nThereafter, their Lordships issued practical guidelines to collect\n\nmitigating circumstances and observed in paragraphs 213 to 217 as\n\nunder: -\n\n\"213. There is urgent need to ensure that mitigating\ncircumstances are considered at the trial stage, to avoid slipping\ninto a retributive response to the brutality of the crime, as is\nnoticeably the situation in a majority of cases reaching the\nappellate stage.\n\n214. To do this, the trial court must elicit information from the\naccused and the state, both. The state, must - for an offence\ncarrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce\nmaterial which is preferably collected beforehand, before the\nSessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 35 -\n\nevaluation of the accused. This will help establish proximity (in\nterms of timeline), to the accused person's frame of mind (or\nmental illness, if any) at the time of committing the crime and offer\nguidance on mitigating factors (1), (5), (6) and (7) spelled out in\nBachan Singh. Even for the other factors of (3) and (4) - an onus\nplaced squarely on the state - conducting this form of psychiatric\nand psychological evaluation close on the heels of commission of\nthe offence, will provide a baseline for the appellate courts to use\nfor comparison, i.e., to evaluate the progress of the accused\ntowards reformation, achieved during the incarceration period.\n\n215. Next, the State, must in a time-bound manner, collect\nadditional information pertaining to the accused. An illustrative,\nbut not exhaustive list is as follows:\n\na) Age\n\nb) Early family background (siblings, protection of parents, any\nhistory of violence or neglect)\n\nc) Present family background (surviving family members, whether\nmarried, has children, etc.)\n\nd) Type and level of education\n\ne) Socio-economic background (including conditions of poverty or\ndeprivation, if any)\n\nf) Criminal antecedents (details of offence and whether convicted,\nsentence served, if any)\n\ng) Income and the kind of employment (whether none, or\ntemporary or permanent etc);\n\nh) Other factors such as history of unstable social behaviour, or\nmental or psychological ailment(s), alienation of the individual\n(with reasons, if any) etc.\n\nThis information should mandatorily be available to the trial court,\nat the sentencing stage. The accused too, should be given the\nsame opportunity to produce evidence in rebuttal, towards\nestablishing all mitigating circumstances.\n\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 36 -\n\n216. Lastly, information regarding the accused's jail conduct and\nbehaviour, work done (if any), activities the accused has involved\nthemselves in, and other related details should be called for in the\nform of a report from the relevant jail authorities (i.e., probation\nand welfare officer, superintendent of jail, etc.). If the appeal is\nheard after a long hiatus from the trial court's conviction, or High\nCourt's confirmation, as the case may be - a fresh report (rather\nthan the one used by the previous court) from the jail authorities is\nrecommended, for an more exact and complete understanding of\nthe contemporaneous progress made by the accused, in the time\nelapsed. The jail authorities must also include a fresh psychiatric\nand psychological report which will further evidence the\nreformative progress, and reveal post-conviction mental illness, if\nany.\n\n217. It is pertinent to point out that this court, in\nAnil v. State of\nMaharashtra17\nhas in fact directed criminal courts, to call for\nadditional material:\n\n\"Many a times, while determining the sentence, the courts take it\nfor granted, looking into the facts of a particular case, that the\naccused would be a menace to the society and there is no\npossibility of reformation and rehabilitation, while it is the duty of\nthe court to ascertain those factors, and the State is obliged to\nfurnish materials for and against the possibility of reformation and\nrehabilitation of the accused. The facts, which the courts deal\nwith, in a given case, cannot be the foundation for reaching such\na conclusion, which, as already stated, calls for additional\nmaterials. We, therefore, direct that the criminal courts, while\ndealing with the offences like\nSection 302\nIPC, after conviction,\nmay, in appropriate cases, call for a report to determine, whether\nthe accused could be reformed or rehabilitated, which depends\nupon the facts and circumstances of each case.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nWe hereby fully endorse and direct that this should be implemented\n\nuniformly, as further elaborated above, for conviction of offences that carry\n\nthe possibility of death sentence.\"\n\n17 (2014) 4 SCC 69\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 37 -\n\n56. Reverting to the facts of the instant case, learned trial Court has\n\nstated aggravating circumstances of instant case in paragraph 57 of its\n\njudgment and holding therein that appellants have murdered Bhagwat Sahu\n\nin day-light and there is no reason to believe that they can be reformed or\n\nrehabilitated and they are likely to continue criminal act of violence. Learned\n\ntrial Court further observed that appellants are menace to the society, as\n\nthey have committed instant crime in a most cruel and inhuman manner\n\nwhich is an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting and dastardly\n\nmanner, where his act affects the entire moral fibre of the society, hence,\n\nlearned trial Court by holding the case in the category of \"rarest of rare\n\ncase\" has awarded capital punishment to both the appellants.\n\n57. Considering the aforesaid practical guidelines issued by the Supreme\n\nCourt in case of\nManoj & others\n(Supra), it is apparent from the record of\n\ntrial that it has awarded capital punishment without taking consideration the\n\nprobability of the appellants to be reformed and rehabilitated and has only\n\ntaken into consideration the brutleness of crime and the manner in which, it\n\nwas committed, but has not been given effective opportunity of hearing on\n\nthe question of sentence to the appellants. No evidence was brought on\n\nrecord on behalf of the prosecution to reach conclusion to the Court that\n\nappellants cannot be reformed or rehabilitated, while producing evidence,\n\nno such evidence has been adduced by the State / prosecution about their\n\nnegative conduct in jail. No adequate opportunity has been given to the\n\nappellants also, that why capital punishment should not be given to them, as\n\non the same day, learned trial Court held guilty and awarded capital\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 38 -\n\npunishment to them. Although, in the instant case, appellants have caused\n\nbrutal murder of deceased by chopping his neck, but there is no evidence\n\non record that the appellants cannot be reformed or rehabilitated or they are\n\nhaving huge criminal antecedents. Though act of the appellants shocks the\n\nconscious of the society at large, but, yet, in the facts & circumstances of\n\nthe case, upon thoughtful consideration, we are of the view that extreme\n\nsentence of death penalty is not warranted in the instant case and this case\n\nis not fall in the category of \"rarest of rare case\" in the principles of law\nlaid\n\ndown by\nApex Court. In our considered view, imprisonment for life would be\n\ncomplete, adequate and would meet the ends of justice. Therefore, we\n\ndirect commutation of death sentence into imprisonment for life.\n\n58. Consequently, Cr. Ref. No. 1/2022 made by 1 st Additional Sessions\n\nJudge, Janjgir, District Janjgir-Champa to the extent of confirmation of\n\nimposition of death sentence to both the appellants is rejected\n\naccordingly.\n\n59. However, Criminal Appeal No. 1625 of 2022 filed on behalf of Sunil\n\nKewat and Criminal Appeal No. 1864 of 2022 filed on behalf of Sohit\n\nKumar Kewat, are partly allowed. Conviction of both the appellants\n\nunder Section 302 read with\nSection 34\nof the IPC are maintained, but,\n\nsentence of death is commuted to life imprisonment by maintaining the\n\nfine amount. We further direct that if fine amount is not paid, then they\n\nbe remained in jail for a further period of six months.\n\nNeutral Citation\n2023:CGHC:22546-DB\n\n- 39 -\n\n60. We direct the Registrar (Judicial) to send a duly attested copy of\n\nthis judgment to the concerned Court of Session as mandated under\n\nSection 371\nof the CrPC for compliance / needful. Record of trial Court\n\nalso be returned forthwith.\n\nSd/- Sd/-\n(N.K.
