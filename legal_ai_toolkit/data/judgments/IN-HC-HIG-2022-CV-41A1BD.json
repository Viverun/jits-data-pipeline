Brief facts of the present case are as under:-\n\n3.1 That the original plaintiff - Khushalbhai Chhotabhai Patel\n\nfiled Special Civil Suit No.536 of 1982 seeking division and/or\n\npartition of ancestral property and to handover the legal\n\npossession of the suit property. The plaintiff, defendant no.1 and\n\ndeceased Umedbhai Chhotabhai Patel are the real brothers.\n\nChhotabhai Amdubhai Patel was holding various agricultural\n\nlands and property in Village: Bhayali. That after the death of\n\nChhotabhai, one Lambha Lekh (family settlement) dated\n\n27.03.1950 was executed between the mother - Jivaben and\n\nthree brothers and the property was divided as per the Lambha\n\nLekh. The deceased Umedbhai had executed a registered sale\n\ndeed on 10.05.1961 and accordingly he became the owner and\n\ncame into possession of the share, which belonged to deceased\n\nUmedbhai. In the said Lambha Lekh, the brothers and mother -\n\nJivaben had made arrangement for maintenance of the mother\n\nand after the death of Jivaben, the share of the mother was\n\ndivided between all the brothers. The defendant no.1 filed a\n\nPage 3 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nrevenue case before the Revenue Authority claiming to be the\n\ntenant of the suit property, which had come into the share of the\n\nplaintiff and deceased Umedbhai. The claim of the defendant\n\nwas rejected and revenue proceedings culminated in favour of\n\nthe plaintiff. The division of the agricultural property had not\n\ntaken place and defendant no.1 used to raise dispute including\n\ncriminal case and restrained the plaintiff in cultivating the land\n\nwhich had come into his share and this had caused to file the\n\nsuit. The original plaintiff filed Special Civil Suit No.536 of 1982\n\nfor division / partition of the ancestral property and for\n\npermanent injunction before the Civil Court, Senior Division,\n\nVadodara (hereinafter be referred to as the \"Trial Court\").\n\n3.2 The Trial Court having regard to the pleadings of the\n\nparties framed the following issues vide Exhibit 161.\n\n(1) Whether the plaintiff proves that after the death of\nChhotabhai, the property of the Chhotabhai was\ndivided between Jivaben, Umedbhai, plaintiff and\ndefendant No.1 as per Lambha Lekh dated\n27.03.1950 as alleged?\n\n(2) Whether the plaintiff proves that he has got 2/3 share\nin the H.U.F. property as alleged?\n\nPage 4 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n(3) Whether the plaintiff proves that the suit is barred\nunder law of limitation?\n\n(4) Whether the defendants prove that they have\nbecome the owners by adverse possession?\n\n(5) Whether the suit is bad for misjoinder of the parties?\n(6) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for getting the\npossession of the suit property as described in plaint\nat para 11(1)?\n\n(7) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim relief as\nprayed?\n\n(8) What order and decree?\n\n3.3 The issues framed by the Trial Court referred to above\n\ncame to be answered as under:-\n\n(1) In the negative;\n\n(2) In the affirmative:\n\n(3) In the negative;\n\n(4) In the negative;\n\n(5) In the negative;\n\n(6) In the affirmative;\n\n(7) In the affirmative;\n\n(8) As per final order;\n\n3.4 The Trial Court, on appreciation of the oral as well as\n\ndocumentary evidence on record, decreed the suit with cost and\n\nPage 5 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nthe defendants were ordered to handover the suit property as\n\nprayed in para-11 of the plaint within six months and if the\n\ndefendants fail to comply with an order they will be at liberty to\n\nask for the further relief for the appointment of the Court\n\nCommissioner regarding the compliance after the completion of\n\nsix months. Further, regarding relief of mense profit, the Trial\n\nCourt dismissed the same.\n\n3.5 The Trial Court, while deciding the suit, has observed in\n\nparagraphs no.6, 7 and 8 as under:-\n\n\"6. As far as the issue no.1 is concerned, the burden of\nproof lies on the plaintiff to prove it that HUF property is\nbelonging to Chhotabhai Amthabhai divided between the\nbrothers as per Lambha Lekh dated 27.03.1950. As per the\nsay of the plaintiff, his father was expired before long time\nand widow of deceased Chhotabhai Amthabhai is Jiviben\nwho is known as Jibaben and he has divided the suit\nproperty as per Lambha Lekh dated 27.03.1950. The\nLambha Lekh is produced and proved at Exh.31 and\nlooking to the Lambha Lekh, it appears that the property is\ndivided but the said Lambha Lekh is not registered and\nlooking to the Lambha Lekh, it appears that the property is\nan agricultural land and it belongs to S.No.648, 168 and\n171/1 and other are fragment land and the provisions of\nthe Fragmentation law is applicable as agricultural land is\n\nPage 6 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ndivided into various parts and the parts have gone to three\nbrothers. Looking to the entire record of this matter, it\nappears to me that no doubt, the Lambha Lekh is executed\nbut no action has taken place pertaining to the division of\nthe property as per Lambha Lekh and has not been divided\nas Lambha Lekh hence issue no.1 in negative.\n\n7. As far as issue no.2 is concerned, there is no dispute\nbetween the parties that the plaintiff and deceased\nBhikhabhai was real brothers and defendant nos.2 to 5 are\nlegal heirs of deceased Bhikhabhai and they have got the\ninterest in the property of their father. As the plaintiff has\npurchased the property from Umedbhai it was purchased\nby the plaintiff which can be seen at Exh.84. Hence, the\nplaintiff has become the owner of 2/3 share of the property\nand his mother was expired hence by Hindu Succession\nright, the plaintiff is getting 1/2 share of the property of\nthe deceased mother Jiviben. Moreover, defendant no.1\nhad raised some dispute pertaining to the said property\nwhich was dismissed by the Revenue Officer, regarding the\ncontention as to a tenant. The deposition of the defendant\nin revenue proceedings is produced at Exh.90 wherein the\ndefendant has admitted that the plaintiff has got 2/3 right\nin the suit property hence reply of issue no.2 comes in\naffirmative. Moreover, the suit property is belonging to the\nancestral one and there is no dispute between the parties.\nMoreover, in the written statement also, the defendant\nnever contended that the suit property is not an ancestral\none. The defendant is examined at Exh.122 wherein the\ndefendant has agreed that property No.171/1, 1156,\n1628/2 and 1686 are belonging to Chhotabhai Amthabhai.\n\nPage 7 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nMoreover, it is admitted that the house No.550 was\npurchased by Chhotabhai Amthabhai hence one thing is\ncrystal clear that the entire suit property was belonging to\nancestral one hence I have no hesitation in quote here that\nthe suit property is belonging to the Hindu Undivided\nProperty and as per the division made in the Lambha Lekh\ndated 27.03.1950 some property had gone in the part of\nthe plaintiff, defendant and deceased Umedbhai and as per\nthe sale deed as proved by the plaintiff, the plaintiff has\npurchased the property which has gone to Umedbhai and\nmore particularly after the death of mother Jiba 1/2\nproperty have gone in the favour of the plaintiff hence the\nplaintiff has got 2/3 part of the share of the entire suit\nproperty as described in the Lambha Lekh hence reply of\nissue no.2 comes in affirmative.\n\nAs far as issue no.3 is concerned, the defendant has raised\na contention regarding the provision of the\nLimitation Act\n,\nas suit is barred under law of limitation. For that purpose\none thing can be seen that no doubt, that the Lambha Lekh\nis not registered but as per the execution of the Lambha\nLekh, all the parties were having the possession of the\nproperties regarding the averments made in the Lambha\nLekh and whatever, the property had gone in favour of all\nbrothers and mother they were enjoying the property but\nthe dispute had raised in the year 1982. The defendant\nno.1 quarreled with the plaintiff and fractured was also\nmade to the plaintiff and defendant no.1 was convicted by\nthe Court of law and it can be seen that in the year 1982,\nthe defendant no.1 has taken the possession of the\nproperty hence one thing is crystal clear to note that on\n\nPage 8 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n13.06.1982, the defendant no.1 had taken the possession.\nOne another thing can be noted from Exh.37 to 42 utara\nwhich can be seen that property had gone in favour of the\nplaintiff and a possession has been cited separately and\nagricultural right is also cited in 7/12 utara. In the year\n1982 the plaintiff was having the possession of the two\nlands in supporting their contentions they had proved and\nproduced a revenue receipt at mark 61 to 82 which are\nbelonging for the year 1982-83 which can be presumed\nthat the plaintiff was cultivating the suit land. Moreover,\nthe plaintiff was pleased to sell the cotton to the Varnama\nGroup Society which is in the year 1982 hence one thing is\ncrystal clear to note that the plaintiff was having the\npossession of the suit property till 1982. Moreover, the\nplaintiff has produced a tax assessment, copy of it\nproduced at Exh.96 which year of 1981-82 the property\nwas running in the name of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has\npaid which can be seen by receipt at Exh.62 & 63 hence\nthere is no hesitation to hold that the plaintiff was having\nthe possession of the suit property right from Lambha Lekh\nto 1982. While in the written statement, the defendant has\nraised the contention that the plaintiff has got monetary\nright but nothing has been proved in deposition and by the\ndocumentary evidence. Moreover, no documentary\nevidence is proved by the plaintiff that he has right over\nthe suit property from 1950 hence the provision of the law\nof limitation proved in this case hence the suit was filed in\nthe year 1982, in the year 1982 the plaintiff dispossessed\nby the defendant. Hence this issue is not proved by the\ndefendant. Hence, issue nos.3 & 4 come in negative.\n\nPage 9 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n8. As far as issue no.5 is concerned, the defendant no.2\nto 5 have been joined as a defendant they are the legal\nheirs of defendant no.1. To avoid the technicalities and at\nthe time of handing over the possession of legal heirs may\nput some hurdles hence the plaintiff was pleased to join\nthem as defendant hence the present suit is not bad for\nmisjoinder of the parties. One thing is crystal clear that as\nfar as the suit property is concerned, the present suit is not\nbarred by law of limitation as well as adverse possession.\nMoreover, the provision of the Fragmentation Act is not\napplicable in this matter. Moreover, it is proved that the\npresent plaintiff was having the possession over the suit\nproperty right from 1952 to 1982 hence the plaintiff is\nentitled to claim the relief as prayed. The plaintiff's L.A.\nMr.Y. M. Pandya produced the case of Girijanandini Devi\nVs. Bijendra Narain Choudhary, AIR 1967 SC 1124 wherein\nthe provision of the Hindu law is provided that it is held\nthat the rights of the coparceners are defined when there\nis partition. Partition consists in defining the share of the\ncoparceners in the joint property actual division of the\nproperty by metes and bounds is not necessary to\nconstitute partition. Once the shares are defined, whether\nby agreement between the parties or otherwise, partition\nis complete. Mr. Pandya argued before me that Lambha\nLekh is proved it is not necessary that as per the Lambha\nLekh the possession was handed over. But one thing is\ncrystal clear to note that the partition of the suit property\nhas really taken place. As far as relief prayed at para 7, 8\nare concerned, it is held that the plaintiff is entitled to get\nthe relief.\"\n\nPage 10 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n3.6 Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned\n\njudgment and decree passed by the Trial Court, the original\n\ndefendants preferred Regular Civil Appeal No.43 of 2008 before\n\nthe District Court, Vadodara [hereinafter referred to as the \"first\n\nAppellate Court\"] wherein the First Appellate Court framed the\n\nfollowing issues at Exhibit 161.\n\n(1) Whether the Trial Court committed error in\nconcluding that the plaintiff / opponent has 2/3rd\nshare in the H.U.F. property as alleged?\n\n(2) Whether the the Trial court committed error in\nrejecting the plea of adverse possession raised by the\nappellant / defendant?\n\n(3) Whether the Trial Court committed any error in\nconcluding that the suit is within the period of\nlimitation?\n\n(4) Whether the Trial Court committed any error in\npassing order to the effect that the plaintiff shall be at\nliberty to ask for appointment of Court commissioner\nregarding the compliance, though Sec.54 of the Civil\nProcedure Code provides partition of estate or\nseparate of share on the basis of decree shall be\nmade by Collector or any Subordinate Officer of the\nCollector?\n\nPage 11 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n(5) Whether the judgment and decree passed by the Trial\nCourt is erroneous, illegal and without appreciation of\nevidence are required any interference?\n\n3.7 The points determined by the first Appellate Court referred\n\nto above came to be answered as under:-\n\n(1) In negative;\n(2) In negative;\n(3) In negative;\n(4) Partly in affirmative;\n(5) In negative;\n\n3.8 The first Appellate Court, while deciding the appeal, has\n\nobserved in paragraphs no.14.1, 14.2, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24,\n\n25, 26, 27 and 28 as under:-\n\n\"14.1 The trial Court has recorded in the impugned\njudgment that, there is no dispute between the parties\npertaining to Lambha Lekh in the year 1950. The Lambha\nLekh is produced and proved vide Ex.31. The Trial Court\nanswered issue No.1 with regard to division of suit property\non the basis of Lambha Lekh dated 27.3.1950, in Negative.\nHowever the Trial Court has recorded that, the Lambha\nLekh is produced and proved at Ex.31 and looking to the\nLambha Lekh it appears that, the property is divided but\nLambha Lekh is not registered, and land is agricultural land\n\nPage 12 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nand answers issue No.1 in negative but further records\nthat, the Lambha Lekh is executed but no action pertaining\nto division of property as per Lambha Lekh has taken\nplace.\n\n14.2 Under these circumstances, this Court is required to\nconsider as to whether there was execution of Lambha\nLekh and whether the parties had decided to divide the\nshare as per Lambha Lekh or not ? As per Lambha Lekh\n(Ex.31), all the three sons of Chhotabhai Patel i.e.\nUmedbhai Patel, Bhikhabhai Patel and Khushalbhai Patel\ndecided to distribute suit property which is recorded in\nLambha Lekh. It is stated that, Umedbhai will get the\nproperty as per condition No.1, Bhikhabhai will get\nproperty as per condition No.2 and Khushalbhai will get\nproperty as per condition No.3 and it is also recorded that,\nrest of the property remains undistributed and is kept for\nthe maintenance of their mother and after the death of\ntheir mother, the property would be divided equally\namongst the three brothers. The Lambha Lekh is signed by\nUmedbhai Patel, Bhikhabhai Patel and Khushalbhai Patel.\nThe Ld. Trial Court has specifically recorded that the\nLambha Lekh is proved. This Court records its concurrence\nwith the findings of the Trial Court. The fact with regard to\nthe execution of Lambha Lekh, each brother agreed 1/3rd\nshare in suit property, is not only proved as recorded\nherein above, but also considering the subsequent\nproceedings which were initiated between the brothers,\nmore particularly by defendant Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai\nPatel.\n\nPage 13 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n15. Ex.84 is the copy of registered sale deed executed by\nUmedbhai Chhotabhai Patel in favour of Khushalbhai\nChhotabhai Patel (Plaintiff). Description of the property in\nthe above registered sale deed describes the property as\nagricultural land bearing Survey No.172 and named\n\"Dibatiyu\", ad-measuring 5.5 Vigha, agricultural land\nbearing Survey No.648 and named \"Ankoliyu\",\nadmeasuring 5.5 Vigha and one house in village Bhaiyali. It\nalso appears from this sale deed that, Umedbhai had 1/3rd\nshare as similarly recorded in Lambha Lekh dated\n27.03.1950 in condition No.1 of the said Lambha Lekh. By\nthe said registered sale deed the fact with regard to\ndivision of share i.e. 1/3rd share of each brother stands\nconcluded from the Lambha Lekh as well as from the\nregistered sale deed executed by Umedbhai Patel. This fact\nis further fortified considering the judgment and decree\nrecorded below RCS No.67/1963, which was filed by\ndeceased - Umedbhai Chhotabhai Patel against plaintiff -\nKhushalbhai Chhotabhai Patel. The suit was filed by\nUmedbhai Chhotabhai Patel against Khushalbhai\nChhotabhai Patel seeking cancellation of sale deed dated\n10.5.1961 and the said suit was dismissed. Against this\nJudgment and Decree, deceased - Umedbhai Chhotabhai\nPatel had preferred Civil Appeal No.112/1966 and the said\nappeal was dismissed with cost vide order dated 8.8.1967\nby the 2nd Extra Assistant Judge, Baroda. The copy of\nJudgment and order dated 8.8.1967 recorded below Civil\nAppeal No.112/66 is produced vide Ex.87. Nothing is\nbrought on record as to whether there were further\nchallenge to the order passed in above referred appeal and\nthe said decision has attained finality, meaning thereby to\n\nPage 14 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nbelieve that, the plaintiff Khushal Chhotabhai had\npurchased share of Umedbhai by way of registered sale\ndeed as established from the above referred two decisions\nof the Civil Court as well as Appellate Court which were\npreferred by Deceased Umedhai Chhotabhai Patel.\n\n15.1 The fact with regard to each brother had 1/3rd suit\nproperty is not only proved from above referred discussion,\nbut is further emerging from the very proceedings initiated\nby Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai Patel (Appellant/ Defendant).\nEx.89 is a copy of order dated 8.10.1976 passed by the\nMamlatdar and ALT, Vadodara, in Case No.1781/1975\nwherein Bhikhabhai had claimed that he holds possession\nof his 1/3rd share and the opponent Khushal and Umedbhai\nholds 2/3rd Share and Bhikhabhai had claimed relief to\ndeclare him as tenant of the 2/3rd share which belonged to\nKhushalbhai and Umedbhai. The claim of Bhikhabhai with\nregard to tenancy is rejected by the Mamlatdar's Order\ndated 8.10.1976 (Ex.89).\n\n16. Ex.90 is the copy of deposition of Bhikhabhai\nChhotabhai Patel recorded in proceedings U/s.70B of the\nTenancy Act. On reading deposition of the Bhikhabhai\nChhotabhai Patel, he has stated that, opponents are his\nreal brothers and he is cultivating 2/3rd share which\nbelongs to his two brothers. Thus admission on the part of\nBhikhabhai makes it clear and prove that, there were three\nbrothers having equal share i.e. 1/3rd share in the said\nproperty. He has also stated that, the property is divided\nand shares are divided separately amongst three brothers.\nHe has admitted that, the names of his brothers are\n\nPage 15 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nrecorded in the Revenue Records. He has also admitted\nthat, 1/3rd share is recorded in his name and 2/3rd share is\nrecorded in the name of opponent No.1 i.e. in the name of\nplaintiff Khushalbhai. This deposition is recorded on\n3.2.1976 in proceedings before the additional Mamlatdar\nunder the\nTenancy Act\n.\n\n17. Ex.91 is the copy of RCS No.1780/1981, which was\npreferred by Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai Patel (Appellant /\nDefendant) against Khushalbhai C. Patel (Plaintiff/\nOpponent), wherein the Additional Mamlatdar has recorded\nthat, the opponent i.e. Khushalbhai is cultivating the land\nin question and rejected the claim of Bhikhabhai\nChhotabhai Patel and further ordered to record the name\nin Revenue Records in Survey No.7/1B, 168, 171/1,\n648,1156/2, 1628/2 and 1686. The above order was also\nchallenged by appellant/ defendant Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai\nPatel by way of RTS Appeal No.34/1981, which was also\nrejected and order passed by the Mamlatdar was\nconfirmed by Dy. Collector vide order dated 25.11.1983.\nThe documentary evidence produced in the nature of tax\nassessment, Revenue Records makes it clear that, the\nproperty was in the possession and was recorded in the\nname of the Plaintiff - Khushalbhai Chhotabhai Patel.\n\n20. One of the contention raised by the appellant is to the\neffect that, the Trial Court did not consider that, the\nappellant/ defendant had become owner of the suit\nproperty by adverse possession. To deal with the above\ncontention with regard to adverse possession, it would be\nrelevant to note that, the appellant/ defendant is claiming\n\nPage 16 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nadverse possession with the co-owners who are real\nbrothers. It is settled position of law that, there could be no\nadverse possession between coowners, unless there has\nbeen a denial of title and an ouster to the knowledge of the\nother.\n\n21. In the present case as recorded herein above, on one\nhand it is admitted by the appellant/ defendant before the\nRevenue Authorities that all the brothers were having\nequal shares and even it was his specific contention before\nthe Revenue Authority under the tenancy proceedings\nthat, he is holding his 1/3rd share and is in possession of\n2/3rd share of his two brothers i.e. 1/3rd share of\nKhushalbhai and 1/3rd share of deceased Umedbhai. The\nappellant / original defendant Bhikhabhai claimed adverse\npossession of 2/3rd share, however, there 18 Regular Civil\nAppeal No.43/2008 is no evidence to prove the plea of\nadverse possession. To deal with the contention of adverse\npossession, it would be relevant to refer case law on this\nissue.\n\n21.1 The Hon'ble Apex Court in recent decision in case of\nNanjegowda @ Gowda (dead) by legal heirs Vs.\nRamegowda, 2018(1), SCC 574, in the said case the suit\nwas for declaration of title over part of family property.\nDefendant admitting oral partition in the family and its\nimplementation. The defendant failed to independently\nestablish his case by leading cogent evidence and decree\nwas passed in the favour of plaintiff and the said decree\nwas upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court. In the said case,\nclaim of adverse possession was also raised and the\n\nPage 17 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nHon'ble Apex Court has held that, there cannot be adverse\npossession amongst members of one family for want of\nanimus among them for land belonging to their family.\"\n\n21.2 The three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\ncase of\nP.

Lakshmi Reddy\n, while\nexamining the necessary conditions for applicability of\ndoctrine of ouster to the share of co-owners held that,\n\n\"The ordinary classical requirement of adverse possession\nis that, it should be nec vi nec clam nec precario.\n\n[See\nSecretary of State for\nIndia Vs. Debendra Lal Khan\n, AIR\n1934, SC 23), 82].\"\n\nThe possession required must be adequate, in continuity,\nin publicity and in extent to show that, it is possession\nadverse to the competitor. But it is well settled that, in\norder to establish adverse possession of one co-heir\nagainst another it is not enough to show that, one out of\nthem is in sole possession and enjoyment of the profits of\nthe properties. Ouster of that non-possession co-heir by\nthe co-heir in possession who claims his possession to be\nadverse, should be made out. The possession of one heir is\nconsidered, in law, as possession of all the co-heirs. When\none co-heir is found to be in possession of the properties, it\nis presumed to be on the basis of joint title. The co-heir in\npossession cannot render his possession adverse to the\nother co-heir not in possession merely by any secret,\nhostile, animus on his own part in derogation of other co-\nheirs title. It is settled rule of law that as between co-heirs\nthere must be evidence of open assertion of hostile title,\n\nPage 18 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ncoupled with exclusive possession and enjoyment by one\nof them to the knowledge of the other, so as to constitute\nouster. The above referred observation are made and\nreferred by the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Nagabhusha\nNammal (D) by legal heirs Vs. C. Chandikeswara Lingam,\nAIR 2016 SC 1134. In view of the above principle with\nregard to adverse possession,there being no evidence to\nsupport the contention, this Court do not finds any merits\nin the contentions raised by the appellant/ defendant and\naccordingly point No.2 is answered in negative.\n\n23. The plaintiff in his plaint has stated that, the cause to\nfile the suit aroused when the Mamlatdar did not accept\nthe division of suit property as per Lambha Lekh. The\ncause aroused on 23.8.1982 as the Mamlatdar did not\naccept division and there were continuous disputes\nbetween the brothers and therefore he filed suit in the year\n1982. The defendant / appellant has raised the issue of\nlimitation in his written statement by stating that, the suit\nis filed beyond period of limitation of period of 12 years. On\ngoing through the evidence which is produced by the\nrespective parties, it appears that, each brother was\nholding 1/3rd share in the said property and all the\nbrothers were enjoying the 20 Regular Civil Appeal\nNo.43/2008 property and were in the possession of the suit\nproperty as per their share. The dispute is said to have\narise in the year 1982 and this gave the cause of filing the\nsuit. The Revenue Records also discloses that, the plaintiff\nwas in possession of his share as well as share of deceased\n\n- Umedbhai which plaintiff had purchased by way of\nregistered sale deed and defendant was in possession of\n\nPage 19 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nhis 1/3rd share. The appellant / defendant - Bikhabhai\nChhotahai Patel had initiated various proceedings before\nthe Revenue authority, Mamlatdar claiming 2/3rd share as\ntenant which belong to plaintiff - Khushalbhai and\nUmedbhai which is not tilted in favour of the\nappellant/defendant.\n\n24. Ex.27 to Ex.42 are the extracts of Revenue records\nwhich establish that, the property had come in favour of\nthe plaintiff and even possession is recorded separately in\n7/12 extract. It also appears from the revenue receipt\nproduced under Mark-61 to Mark-82 that, plaintiff was in\npossession of the two lands. The other documentary\nevidence in the form of Tax Assessment copy (Ex.96),\nReceipt (Ex.62 and 63) discloses that, the plaintiff/\nopponent - Khushalbhai was in possession of the suit\nproperty upto year 1982. The defendant on the other hand\nexcept raising contentions that, suit is barred by limitation\nhas not been able to prove that, how suit is barred by\nlimitation. In view of the above, discussion this Court, do\nnot find any error or illegality in the findings of the Trial\nCourt that, the suit is not barred by limitation.\n\n25. The appellant/defendant has raised issue in this appeal\nthat to the Trial Court while passing impugned judgment\nhas ignored provisions of Sec.54 and Order-20 Rule-18(2)\nand though the competent authority would be the Collector\nor any Gazetted Officer or Subordinate of Collector, who\nwill partition or separate the share in case of decree of\npartition of undivided estate. It is stated that, the trial\nCourt committed error in ordering to comply with the order\n\nPage 20 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\npassed in the judgment and it would be open for the\nplaintiff to seek further relief for appointment of Court\nCommissioner regarding the compliance after completion\nof six months.\n\n26.\nSec.54\nof CPC deals with the partition of estate or\nseparation of share. It provides that, where ever the\ndecree is for partition of undivided estate, access to\npayment or separation of share the same shall be made by\nthe Collector or any Gazetted Officer Subordinate Officer to\nthe Collector.\n\n27. Order-20, Rule-18 deals with the procedure in case of\ndecree in suit for partition of property or separate\npossession of a share. Rule-18 also provides separation or\npartition to be made by the Collector or Gazetted Officer\nSubordinate of the Collector deputed by him in his behalf\nin consonance with the provisions of Sec.54. To this extent\nthis Court finds that, the Trial Court could not have granted\nliberty to apply for Court Commissioner, when Sec.54 and\nOrder-20 Rule-18 provides specific provisions in connection\nwith partition. Even Learned Advocate Mr. Pandya for the\nOpponent has stated that, he have no objection if the\ndecree of the trial court is effected as per the provision of\nSection 54 and Order-20 Rule-18\nof the CPC\n. To this extent\nthe operative order which grants liberty to apply for Court\nCommissioner requires to be interfered considering the\nprovisions of Sec.54 and Order-20 Rule-18 and it is\nmodified to the extent that, the decree shall be effected as\nper the provisions of Sec.54 and Order-20 Rule-18 of Civil\nProcedure Code.\n\nPage 21 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n28. In view of the above discussion and re-appreciation of\nevidence recorded before the Trial Court, this Court do not\nfinds any error, illegality in the Judgment and records its\nconcurrence with the findings and Judgment of the Trial\nCourt, except with modification as discussed in point No.4.\nThe points raised in this appeal i.e. point Nos.1, 2 and 3 are\nanswered in negative, point No.4 is answered partly in\naffirmative and the appeal being devoid of merits, point\nNo.5 is also answered in negative.

Mr.Shah, learned senior counsel for Mr.Majmudar, learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants submitted that the Courts below have\n\ncommitted an error in interpreting the Lambha Lekh, which\n\nnever established the partition amongst the family members and\n\nsigned by the members of Hindu Undivided Family. He submitted\n\nthat the contention of the original plaintiff itself was contrary to\n\nthe evidence and the averment made in the plaint vis-a-vis\n\nPage 23 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ndocumentary evidence / sale deed produced and relied upon by\n\nhim for accepting the rights regarding survey no.171/1 as the\n\ndocuments produced by the plaintiff in the nature of sale deed of\n\n1961 is in respect of survey no.172 and the said survey number\n\nwas not owned and occupied by the plaintiff / defendant and\n\ntheir predecessor-in-title. He submitted that the Courts below\n\nbelieved survey no.171/1 as part of the Joint Family Property,\n\nthough the same was self-acquired property of Bhikhabhai\n\nChhotabhai at his own sale consideration in the name of\n\nUmedbhai Chhotabhai. He has submitted that the Courts below\n\ncommitted error in interpreting the documentary evidence as\n\nhouse no.815 (new no.990) city survey no.113, 815/1 - Vada\n\nLand having panchayat no.991 (new number) city survey\n\nno.1102 was purchased by Umedbhai Patel. He submitted that in\n\nview of the above facts, the appeal deserves allowed.\n\n6.1. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants\n\nsubmitted that Special Civil Suit No.536 of 1982 came to be filed\n\nby Khushalbhai Chhotabhai Patel, against Bhikhabhai\n\nChhotabhai, Vinodbhai Bhikhabhai Patel, Thakorbhai Bhikhabhai\n\nPage 24 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nPatel and Bharatbhai Bhikhabhai Patel. He submitted that the\n\noriginal plaintiff, original defendant no.1 and Umedbhai\n\nChhotabhai Patel were the real brothers and after the death of\n\nChhotabhai Amthabhai Patel i.e. father of original plaintiff -\n\nKhushalbhai, a Lambha Lekh dated 27.03.1950 came to be\n\nexecuted and the plaintiff had preferred the suit on the basis of\n\nthe Lambha Lekh which came to be executed for arrangement of\n\nvarious properties amongst the legal heirs and representatives of\n\ndeceased Chhotabhai. He submitted that the plaintiff filed the\n\nsuit on the basis of the fact that if Lambha Lekh was not being\n\nconsidered or accepted or believed by the Court, then the\n\nproperties mentioned in the plaint as well as Lambha Lekh be\n\npartitioned amongst the plaintiff and defendants. While referring\n\nto the paper-book, he submitted that the suit was filed seeking\n\npartition of the properties and the cause of action arisen for\n\nseeking partition by metes and bounds through the revenue\n\ndepartment, as at the relevant point of time, on passing of the\n\npreliminary decrees, on declaration of the respective shares of\n\nthe concerned plaintiff - defendant, the actual physical\n\npossession and actual demarcation of respective portion of\n\nPage 25 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nshares was to be done through the revenue department. He also\n\nreferred to para-11, 11(2), 11(3) and 11(6) of the prayers clause\n\nand submitted that the said prayers are in respect of seeking\n\npartition of the properties as mentioned in the suit. It is\n\nsubmitted that even the Lambha Lekh at Exhibit 31 is an\n\nunregistered document. He further submitted that original\n\ndefendants have filed written statement to the plaint and\n\ncounter affidavit to the interim injunction application denying all\n\nthe averments and contentions and contended that no partition\n\nhad ever taken place. He submitted that the judgment and\n\ndecree passed by the Trial Court provided that division of\n\nancestral properties and/or partition of the said properties and\n\npermanent injunction and thus, the nature of the suit itself was\n\nconsidered as a suit for division of ancestral properties and\n\npartition of the properties.\n\n6.2 It is submitted that the Trial Court has observed in para-6\n\nof the judgment and decree that no doubt, the Lambha Lekh was\n\nexecuted but no action has taken place pertaining to the division\n\nof the properties as per the Lambha Lekh and has not been\n\nPage 26 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ndivided as per the Lambha Lekh. He submitted that the findings\n\nof the Trial Court have become final and after giving the\n\nreasoning, the suit came to be decreed and possession is\n\nordered to be handed over to the concerned plaintiffs and, thus,\n\nthe reasons assigned by the Trial Court are contradictory to law.\n\nHe submitted that the defendants stated that no Lambha Lekh\n\nwas executed and no partition had taken place on the basis of\n\nthe said document and the same is not a document which\n\nprovides for division of properties amongst the coparcener of the\n\nHindu Undivided Family. He submitted that the deposition of the\n\nplaintiff at Exhibit 30 is required to be considered and the\n\ndeposition of the defendant in respect of\nSection 70(b)\nof the\n\nTenancy Act is very much relevant. It is submitted that in view of\n\nthe statutory provisions of\nSection 17\nof the Indian Registration\n\nAct, the Lambha Lekh could not be considered as a document,\n\nwhich declares the division of the respective shares in their\n\nrespective properties amongst the coparcener of Hindu\n\nUndivided Family. He submitted that neither there is any\n\nchallenge made to the findings of the Trial Court nor any cross-\n\nobjections have been filed by the original plaintiff as it ought to\n\nPage 27 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nhave been done under Order XXXIX Rule 22 of the Civil\n\nProcedure Code. He submitted that in view of the findings on\n\nissue No.1 and issue no.2, the decree could not have been\n\npassed and the suit could not have been allowed and, therefore,\n\nthe judgment and decree of the Trial Court which came to be\n\nconfirmed by the first Appellate Court deserves to be quashed\n\nand set aside. He submitted that the plaintiff failed to make out\n\nany averments in the plaint and to lead oral as well as\n\ndocumentary evidence as to what had happened to the\n\nproperties which had gone into the share of Jibaben @ Jiviben. He\n\nsubmitted that as per the settled proposition of law, in a suit for\n\ndecree of partition, the Trial Court ought to have passed the\n\npreliminary decree by which the respective shares in the\n\nproperties ought to have been declared and, thereafter, the\n\nfurther orders ought to have been passed for actual physical\n\ndivision of the share of the concerned coparcener and,\n\nthereafter, the final decree for physical division be metes and\n\nbounds was required to be passed. He also submitted that the\n\npreliminary decree and final decree have been passed\n\nsimultaneously which is serious error cropped-up by both the\n\nPage 28 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nCourts below. While referring to the deposition of the defendants\n\nat page no.105 and page-93, he submitted that it is clearly\n\nestablished that the defendant stated that the defendants are in\n\npossession of the entire lands since 1951-1952 and no partition\n\ncould be said to have effected, however, the said aspects have\n\nnot been considered by both the Courts below. He has submitted\n\nthat various civil proceedings had taken place between the two\n\nother brothers, however, the defendants were not parties to the\n\nsuit and sale transaction which had taken place was without the\n\nconsent of the defendants and, therefore, the sale transactions\n\nwas null and void and, therefore, the judgment and decree\n\npassed in earlier suit would not be binding to the present\n\nappellants - original defendants. He further submitted that the\n\nplaintiff approached before the revenue authority on 02.09.1976\n\nand considering the averments made in para-7, para-14 and\n\nLambha Lekh, it appears that the suit was barred by law of\n\nlimitation as the limitation was started from 27.03.1950 and the\n\nsame had continued to remain in force and the suit was filed on\n\n30.12.1982, which came to be barred by law of limitation. He has\n\nsubmitted that considering\nArticle 113\nof the\nLimitation Act\n, the\n\nPage 29 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nsuit for partition ought to have been filed within a period of three\n\nyears and the suit for possession ought to have been filed within\n\nthe period of three years from the date of the so-called Lambha\n\nLekh. He has submitted that survey no.171/1 was never sold by\n\none of the brother - Umedbhai to the plaintiff, however, the\n\ndecree provides the same and, therefore, there is serious error\n\ncropped-up while passing the decree. He has submitted that the\n\nprovisions of Section 103 of the Civil Procedure Code, this Court\n\ncan interfere with the findings of facts in a given case if finding\n\nof question of law is erroneous and if Trial Court's decree is\n\nperverse or without considering the pleadings and relevant\n\nevidence or on erroneous approaches or requires constructions\n\nof documents. He lastly submitted that in view of the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, the appeal deserves to be allowed.\n\n6.3 In support of his arguments, Mr.Shah, learned senior\n\ncounsel relied upon the following decisions.\n\n(\n1) Ramabhai Shamalbhai Patel and another Vs.

Mr.Thakore, learned senior counsel for Ms.Jani, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the respondent - original plaintiff. He\n\nsubmitted that Trial Courts below have not committed any error\n\nwhile passing the impugned orders. He submitted that\n\nChhotabhai Amthabhai Patel died in the year 1950, Jibaben Wd/o.\n\nChhotabhai Patel died in the year 1961 and their legal heirs are\n\nKhushalbhai - original plaintiff and Bhikhabhai - original\n\ndefendant. He submitted that the present appeal is against the\n\nconcurrent findings recorded by both the Courts and when the\n\nCourts below have, after appreciating the oral as well as\n\ndocumentary evidence and after considering the arguments\n\nadvanced by all the parties passed the orders and, therefore, this\n\nCourt cannot go into the question of facts arising in the matter\n\nand interference with such findings of facts is impermissible or\n\nre-appreciation of the evidence and the present appeal is not\n\nrequired to be entertained and called for any interference. He\n\nPage 32 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nsubmitted that Lambha Lekh is not a document effecting\n\npartition, but is a document merely recording the oral partition\n\nwhich had taken place between the parties; the law in this issue\n\nis well settled only a document effecting partition is mandatorily\n\nregisterable under\nSection 17\nof the Registration Act 1908 and\n\nsince Lambha Lekh is not mandatorily registerable, the bar\n\nunder\nSection 49\nof the Registration Act, 1908 would not come\n\ninto play. Learned senior counsel pointed out that on existence\n\nand execution of Lambha Lekh of 1950 affected in the year 1982\n\nand even the defendant also contended before the concerned\n\nTrial Court that when considering the adverse possession, he\n\nbecame the owner of the parcel of land by virtue of the adverse\n\npossession as he is cultivating the land since 1950-1952. He\n\nsubmitted that the defendants have not challenged the same\n\nbefore any of the authority and it is hit the provisions of the\n\nlimitation and barred by law of limitation. He submitted that the\n\ncontention with regard to the suit was barred by law of limitation,\n\nthe Trial Court has rightly dealt with the said contention in issue\n\nno.3 and issue no.4. He submitted that the family settlement\n\narrived at in 1950 and it put into force in 1982 and since the\n\nPage 33 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ndefendants have forcefully dispossessed the plaintiff from the\n\nparcel of land, he filed the suit in the year 1982 and prayed for\n\nthe partition taken place in the year 1950 and the Trial Court has\n\nrightly appreciated and dealt with in issue no.3 and issue no.4.\n\nHe also submitted that the first Appellate Court has, while\n\nrecording the concurrent findings in with the judgment and\n\ndecree of the Trial Court, rightly dealt with the evidence in its\n\ntrue and proper spirit as observed in paragraph no.28 of the\n\njudgment and order and, therefore, no interference is called for.\n\n7.1 Mr.Thakore, learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\nrespondents has relied upon the following decisions:-\n\n(\n1) Gurnam Singh and others Vs.

At the time of admission of this Appeal, the following\nsubstantial questions of law were formulated.\n\n(i) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the\ncase,\nSection 8\nof the Limitation Act would override the\nprovisions of\nSections 6\nand\nthereof?\n\n(ii) Whether the limitation for the plaintiff's Suit would be\ngoverned by\nArticle 110\nof the\nLimitation Act\n?\n\n(iii) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case,\neven if the Suit is otherwise time barred the reliefs sought\nby the plaintiff in respect of his share in the property of\nRavjibhai-defendant No.1, who died pending the Appeal,\nwould not be time barred?\n\n7.3 The contention that there is no limitation for partition\nsuit thus rests here being without any substance. In this\ncase as the cause of action accrued in the year 1968, the\nplaintiffs' partition suit was subjected to three years period\n\nPage 35 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nof limitation under\nArticle 113\nof the\nLimitation\nAct\nand\nSection 6\nread with\nSection 8\nof the Limitation Act\nwould apply.\"\n\n10.\nIn the case of\nKrishna Pillai Rajasekharam Nair\n(supra),\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed in paragraph no.22 as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"22. In our opinion, the suit filed in the present case being\na suit for partition primarily and predominantly and the\nrelief of redemption having been sought for only pursuant\nto the direction made by the High Court in its order of\nremand, the limitation for the suit would be governed\nby\nArticle 120\nof Limitation Act, 1908. For a suit for\npartition the starting point of limitation is - when the right\nto sue accrues, that is, when the plaintiff has notice of his\nentitlement to partition being denied. In such a suit, the\nright of the redeeming co- mortgagor would be to resist the\nclaim of non-redeeming co- mortgagor by pleading his right\nof contribution and not to part with the property unless the\nnon-redeeming co-mortgagor had discharged his duty to\nmake contribution. This equitable defence taken by the\nredeeming co-mortgagor in the written statement would\nnot convert the suit into a suit for contribution filed by the\nnon-redeeming co- mortgagor.\"\n\n11.\nIn the case of\nRaghunath Das\n(supra), the Apex Court\n\nPage 36 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nhas observed in paragraph no.9 as under:-\n\n\"9. We are unable to accept the decision of the High\nCourt as correct. The High Court overlooked the fact that\nso far as the G. P. Notes were concerned the decree upon\nthe award only declared the rights of the parties. Under the\ndecree Raghunath Das was entitled to have G. P. Notes of\nthe value of Rs. 13,200 endorsed in the names of himself\nand Mst. Daropadi out of the G. P. Notes of the value of Rs.\n26,500. The award or the decree thereon did not actually\ndivide the G. P. Notes by specifying which particular G. P.\nNotes were to be endorsed in the names of Gokul Chand\nand Mst. Daropadi or which of them were to be endorsed in\nthe names of Raghunath Das and his mother. Until the G.\nP. Notes were actually divided, either by consent of parties\nor by the decree of the court, neither of the brothers could\nclaim any particular piece of G. P. Notes as his separate\nproperty or ask for delivery of any particular C. P. Notes in\nspecie. Gokul Chand not being agreeable to come to an\namicable division of the G. P. Notes, Raghunath Das had\nperforce to seek the assistance of the court and pray that\nthe entire lot of C. P. Notes of the value of Rs. 26,500 be\ndivided by or under the directions of the court into two lots\nand one lot making up the value of Rs. 13,200 be endorsed\nin favour of him (Raghunath Das) and his mother by or on\nbehalf of Gokul Chand and then delivered to him, the\nplaintiff. He could not in his plaint claim that particular\npieces of G. P. Notes making up the value of Rs. 13,200 be\ndelivered to him in specie. This being the true position, as\nwe conceive it, Raghunath Das's suit cannot possibly be\n\nPage 37 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nregarded as a suit for a \" specific moveable property \".\n\nThat expression is apt only to cover a suit wherein the\nplaintiff can allege that he is entitled to certain specific\nmoveable property and/or of which he is presently entitled\nto possession in specie and which the defendant has\nwrongfully taken from him and/or is illegally withholding\nfrom him. That is not the position here. It should be\nremembered that the two brothers were entitled to the G.\nP. Notes of the value of Rs. 26,500 originally as joint\ncoparceners and thereafter, when the decree upon the\naward had been passed, as tenants- in-common. Until\nactual partition by consent of the parties or by court Gokul\nChand, who held the custody of the G. P. Notes, could not\nbe said to have taken them wrongfully from Raghunath\nDas and his possession of them could not be said to be or\nto have become unlawful. These considerations clearly\ndistinguish this case from the case of\nGopal Chandra Bose\nv. Surendra Nath Dutt\non which the High Court relied\nbecause\nin that case\nthe defendant had no right to or\ninterest in the G. P. Notes in question and had no right to\nretain possession thereof. Therefore, to the present\nsituation the terminus a quo specified in the third column\nof\nArt. 49\ncan have no application. It is now well\nestablished that a suit by an heir against other heirs to\nrecover his share of the moveable estate of a deceased\nperson is not one for (1) (1908) XII C. W. N. 1010 specific\nmoveable property wrongfully taken such as is\ncontemplated by Art 49, but is governed by\nArt. 120.\nSee\nMohomed Riasat Ali v. Mussumat Hasin Banu (1). The only\ndifference between the facts of that case and those of the\npresent case is that here the rights of the parties had been\n\nPage 38 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ndeclared by the decree upon the award but that\ncircumstance does not appear to us to make any material\ndifference in the application of the principle laid down by\nthe Judicial Committee. The substance of the plaintiff's\nclaims in both cases is for separating his share out of the\nestate and for allotment and delivery to him of his share so\nseparated. In short such a suit is nothing but a suit for\npartition or division of the moveable properties held jointly\nor as tenants-in-common by the parties and there being no\nspecific Article applicable to such a suit it must be\ngoverned by\nArt. 120.\n\n12.\nIn the case of\nSaraswatiben Kantilal Patel\n(supra), this\n\nCourt (Coram: Hon'ble Ms.Justice Harsha Devani) has observed in\n\nparagraphs no.23 and 26 as under:-\n\n\"23. Thus, the Limitation Act does not prescribe any period\nof limitation for a suit for partition. The Supreme Court in\nthe case of\nKrishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair v. Padmanabha\nPillai\n(supra) was of the opinion that the suit filed in the\nsaid case being a suit for partition, the limitation for the\nsuit would be governed by\nArticle 120\nof the Limitation Act,\n1908. For a suit for partition, the starting point of limitation\nis - when the right to sue accrues, that is, when the\nplaintiff has notice of his entitlement to partition being\ndenied. Therefore,\nArticle 110\nof the\nSchedule to the\nLimitation Act, 1963\nwhich prescribes the period of\nlimitation in case of a suit by a person excluded from a\njoint family property to enforce a right to share therein\n\nPage 39 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nwould not be applicable to a suit for partition. In the light of\n\nthe above decision\nof the Supreme Court, the applicable\nprovision would be\nArticle 113\nof the\nSchedule to the\nLimitation Act, 1963\nwhich corresponds to\nArticle 120\nof\nthe Limitation Act, 1908 and provides for a limitation of\nthree years from the date when the right to sue accrues.\nAccordingly, in the case at hand, the limitation would start\nrunning from the date of the plaintiffs' knowledge of denial\nof entitlement to partition.\n\n26. 26. As discussed hereinabove, the limitation in the\npresent case for instituting a suit for partition would be\nthree years from the date of knowledge of the plaintiffs of\ndenial of their entitlement to partition, which may be taken\nto be the date of filing of the present suit. As noticed\nearlier, the suit was instituted in the year 2008 whereas\nthe application under rule 17 of Order VI of the Code was\nfiled on or about 28th July, 2014, that is, after a period of\nmore than five years. Testing the facts of the present case\nin the light of the law\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in\n\nKrishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair v. Padmanabha Pillai\n\n(supra), the amendment application which has been filed\nafter a period of more than five years from the date of the\nplaintiffs' knowledge of the denial of their entitlement to\npartition, is clearly barred by limitation.\n\nIn\nRevejeetu\nBuilders & Developers v. Narayanaswamy & Sons\n, (2009)\n10 SCC 84, the Supreme Court has inter alia held that as a\ngeneral rule, the court should decline amendments if a\nfresh suit on the amended claims would be barred by the\nlimitation on the date of application.\"\n\nPage 40 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n13.\nIn the case of\nIlloth Valappil Ambunhi\n(supra), the Apex\n\nCourt has observed in paragraphs no.14, 21 to 27 as under:-\n\n\"14. It is now well settled that perversity in arriving at a\nfactual finding gives rise to a substantial question of law,\nattracting intervention of the High Court under\nSection 100\n\nCPC.\n\n\"21. The High\nCourt further held\n: (Chuzhali raman\n\nKarnavan v. Illoth Valappil Ambunhi\n, 2009 SCC Online Ker\n6802 para 8)\n\n8. In the decisions relied on by the learned counsel for\nthe respondent it has been held that there cannot be a\npresumption regarding acceptance of the gift, be it not\nonerous and that there must be some evidence to show\nthat the gift was accepted during the life time of the donor\nbut, what is stated in those decision is concerning the\npresumption as to the acceptance of the gift. But when the\ndocument itself recited that the possession of the property\nwas given to the donee, then, a presumption of acceptance\nof gift would arise in favour of the donee.\n\n22. The proposition of law that when the document of\ntransfer by gift records delivery of possession, a\npresumption of acceptance would arise, in the absence of\novert repudiation of the gift, by and/or on behalf of the\ndonee, is unexceptionable. As held by the High Court,\nwhen the deed itself said that the possession of the\nproperty was given to the donee, the burden of proving,\n\nPage 41 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nthat the said recital was not correct, lay on the party who\nasserted so. In our view, the law has correctly been\nappreciated and enunciated by the High Court.\n\n23. The High Court took note of the recital to the effect\nthat Karnavan (Malingan Chuzhali Ashari) acting on behalf\nof the Bhandaram was to enjoy the property from the date\nof the gift, which was strong evidence of transfer of\npossession.\n\n24. The High Court rightly found that there was no\ndirection in the gift deed which made the gift onerous as\nunderstood in\nSection 127\nof the Transfer of Property Act.\nIn all fairness to the appellants, this has not even been\nargued before the High court. The gift not being onerous,\nthere was no reason why Malingan Chuzhali Ashari should\nnot have accepted the gift on behalf of the Bhandaram.\n\n25. The High Court held: (Chuzhali raman\nKarnavan v.\nIlloth Valappil Ambunhi\n, 2009 SCC Online Ker 6802 para 6)\n\n6.......It is indisputable that an idol is to be treated as a\nminor for all legal purposes. Hence, the acceptance of the\ngift as per Ext. A1 could be by any person on behalf of the\ndonee. It is not disputed that Malingan Chuzhali Ashari was\nthe Karnavan of the Tharawad during the time of Ext.A1\nand that along with Malingan Chuzhali Ashari, the donor\n(Raman Aithan Ashari) was also a trustee of the\nBhandaram.\n\n26. As noted by the High Court, there is no dispute that\n\nPage 42 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nMalingan Chuzhali Ashari and the donor Raman were\ntrustees of the Bhandaram (donee) at the time of\nexecution of deed of gift. The fact that nothing was done\nby Raman or any other trustee of the Bhandaram to\nrepudiate the gift in itself shows that the deed of gift was\nduly accepted by the Bhandaran.\n\n27. The High Court rightly held that the Courts below had\nproceeded on the wrong assumption that even in spite of\nthe recitals in Exh. A1, being the deed of gift and the\nadmitted facts of the case, the burden of proof was on the\nrespondents to show that the gift had been accepted. The\nfindings of the Trial Courts and the First Appellate Court\nwere based on a wrong assumption of law regarding the\npossession of an idol in the eye of law and the relevant\nrecitals in Exh. A1 (deed of gift).\"\n\n14.\nIn the case of\nUma Pandey\n(supra), the Apex Court has\n\nobserved in paragraph no.12 to 18 as under:-\n\n\"12. In our considered opinion, the High Court erred in\ndismissing the second appeal in limine on the ground that\nit did not involve any substantial question(s) of law.\n\n13. In our view, the appeal did involve substantial\nquestion(s) of law within the meaning of\nSection 100\nof the\nCode of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as\n'the Code') and, therefore, it should have been admitted\nfor final hearing on the substantial question(s) of law\narising in the case.\n\nPage 43 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n14. It is not in dispute that the defendants (respondents)\nfiled one document(EX-A)-(Annexure-P-1 of SLP). This\ndocument was relied on and appreciated by the two Courts\nbelow for deciding the rights of the parties. The Trial Court\ndecreed the suit and the First Appellate Court reversed it\non appreciating the evidence including EX-A.\n\n15. It is a settled principle of law that interpretation of\nany document including its contents or its admissibility in\nevidence or its effect on the rights of the parties to the Lis\nconstitutes a substantial question(s) of law within the\nmeaning of Section 100 of the Code.\n\n16. Whenever such question arises in the second appeal\nat the instance of the appellant, it deserves admission on\nframing appropriate substantial question(s) on such\nquestions to enable the High Court to decide the appeal on\nmerits bi-party.\n\n17. In this case, it was all the more reason for the High\nCourt to have admitted the appellants' second appeal\nbecause the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court had\ntaken into consideration the document - Ex-A for deciding\nthe Lis involved in the case.\n\n18. In the light of the foregoing discussion, we cannot\nconcur with the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by\nthe High Court as, in our view, it wrongly dismissed\nappellants' second appeal in limine.\"\n\nPage 44 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n15.\nIn the case of\nAbdul Raheem\n(supra), the Apex Court has\n\nobserved in paragraphs no.10 to 12 as under:-\n\n\"10. A substantial question of law ordinarily would not\narise from the finding of facts arrived at by the trial court\nand the first appellate court. The High Court's jurisdiction\nin terms of Section 100 of the Code is undoubtedly limited.\n\n11. The question as to whether the plaintiff was ready\nand willing to perform its part of contract by itself may not\ngive rise to a substantial question of law. Substantial\nquestion of law should admittedly be formulated relying on\nor on the basis of findings of fact arrived at by the trial\ncourt and the first appellate court.\n\n12. However, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that\nconsideration of irrelevant fact and non-consideration of\nrelevant fact would give rise to a substantial question of\nlaw. Reversal of a finding of fact arrived at by the first\nappellate court ignoring vital documents may also lead to a\nsubstantial question of law. In vidhyadhar v. Manikrao,\n(1999) 3 SCC 573 this court held: 9SCC p.586, para 23)\n\n\"23. The findings of fact concurrently recorded by the trial\ncourt as also by the lower appellate court could not have\nbeen legally upset by the High court in a second appeal\nunder\nSection 100\nCPC unless it was shown that the\nfindings were perverse being based on no evidence or that\non the evidence on record, no reasonable person could\nhave come to that conclusion.\"\n\nPage 45 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n16.\nIn the case of\nPatel Ramanbhai Mathurbhai\n(supra), the\n\nApex Court has observed in paragraphs no.27 to 37 as under:-\n\n\"27.\nSection 100\nCPC provides for a second appeal only on\nthe substantial question of law. Generally, a Second Appeal\ndoes not lie on question of facts or of law.\n\n28.\nIn\nState Bank of India & Ors. v. S. N. Goyal\n, 2008 Air\n(SC) 2594, the Supreme Court explained the terms\n\"substantial question of law\" and observed as under:\n\n\"The word 'substantial' prefixed to 'question of law' does\nnot refer to the stakes involved in the case, nor intended to\nrefer only to questions of law of general importance, but\nrefers to impact or effect of the question of law on the\ndecision in the lis between the parties. 'Substantial\nquestions of law' means not only substantial questions of\nlaw of general importance, but also substantial question of\nlaw arising in a case as between the parties. ....... any\nquestion of law which affects the final decision in a case is\na substantial question of law as between the parties. A\nquestion of law which arises incidentally or collaterally,\nhaving no bearing on the final outcome, will not be a\nsubstantial question of law. There cannot, therefore, be a\nstraitjacket definition as to when a substantial question of\nlaw arises in a case\"\n\nSimilarly, in\nSir Chunilal V. Mehta & Sons Ltd. V. Century\nSpinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\n, 1962 AIR (SC) 1314,\n\nPage 46 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nthis Court for the purpose of determining the issue held:\n\n\"The proper test for determining whether a question of law\nraises in the case is substantial, would, in our opinion, be\nwhether it is of general public importance or whether it\ndirectly and substantially affects the rights of the parties..\"\n\n29.\nIn\nVijay Kumar Talwar v. Commissioner of Income\nTax, New Delhi\n, 2011 1 SCC 673, this Court held that, a\npoint of law which admits of no two opinions may be a\nproposition of law but cannot be a substantial question of\nlaw. To be 'substantial' a question of law must be\ndebatable, not previously settled by law of the land or a\nbinding precedent, and must have a material on the\ndecision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as the\nrights of the parties before it are concerned. To be a\nquestion of law 'involving in the case' there must be first a\nfoundation for it laid in the pleadings and the question\nshould emerge from the sustainable findings of fact arrived\nat by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that\nquestion of law for a just and proper decision of the case. It\nwill, therefore, depend on the facts and circumstances of\neach case, whether a question of law is a substantial one\nor not; the paramount overall consideration being the need\nfor striking a judicious balance between the indispensable\nobligation to do justice at all state and impelling necessity\nof avoiding prolongation in the life of any lis.\" (See also:\n\nRajeshwari v. Puran Indoria\n, 2005 7 SCC 60).\n\n30. The Court, for the reasons to be recorded, may also\nentertain a second appeal even on any other substantial\n\nPage 47 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nquestion of law, not formulated by it, if the Court is\nsatisfied that the case involves such a question. Therefore,\nthe existence of a substantial question of law is a sine qua\nnon for the exercise of jurisdiction under the provisions of\n\nSection 100\nCPC. The second appeal does not lie on the\nground of erroneous findings of facts based on\nappreciation of the relevant evidence.\n\nThere may be a question, which may be a \"question of\nfact\", \"question of law\", \"mixed question of fact and law\".\nQuestion means anything inquired; an issue to be decided.\nThe \"question of fact\" is whether a particular factual\nsituation exists or not. A question of fact, in the Realm of\nJurisprudence, has been explained as under:\"\n\n\"A question of fact is one capable of being answered by\nway of demonstration. A question of opinion is one that\ncannot be so answered. As answer to it is a matter of\nspeculation which cannot be proved by any available\nevidence to be right or wrong.\" (Vide: Salmond, on\nJurisprudence, 12th Edn.

Ramendra Narayan Roy &\nOrs.\n[AIR 1947 PC 19], the Privy Council has provided the\nguidelines as in what cases the second appeal can be\nentertained, explaining the provisions existing prior to the\namendment of 1976, observing as under:\n\n\".....that miscarriage of justice means such a departure\n\nPage 48 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nfrom the rules which permeate all judicial procedure as to\nmake that which happen not in the proper sense of the\nword 'judicial procedure' at all. That the violation of some\nprinciples of law or procedure must be such erroneous\nproposition of law that if that proposition to be corrected,\nthe finding cannot stand, or it may be the neglect of some\nprinciple of law or procedure, whose application will have\nthe same effect. The question whether there is evidence\non which the Courts could arrive at their finding, is such a\nquestion of law.\n\n'That the question of admissibility of evidence is a\nproposition of law but it must be such as to affect\nmaterially the finding.

Commissioner\nof Income Tax, Bombay\n[AIR 1957 SC 852], the Supreme\nCourt considered a large number of its earlier judgments,\nincluding\nSree Meenakshi Mills Ltd., Madurai v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Madras\n[AIR 1957 SC 49],\nand held that where the question of decision is whether\n\nPage 49 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ncertain profit is made and shown in the name of certain\nintermediaries, were, in fact, profit actually earned by the\nassessee or the intermediaries, is a mixed question of fact\nand law. The\nCourt further held\nthat inference from facts\nwould be a question of fact or of law according as the point\nfor determination is one of pure fact or a \"mixed question\nof law and fact\" and that a finding of fact without evidence\nto support it or if based on relevant or irrelevant matters,\nis not unassailable.\n\n34. There is no prohibition to entertain a second appeal\neven on question of fact provided the Court is satisfied that\nthe findings of the courts below were vitiated by non-\nconsideration of relevant evidence or by showing\nerroneous approach to the matter and findings recorded in\nthe court below are perverse. (Vide: Jagdish Singh v. Nathu\nSingh, AIR 1992 SC 1604; Smt. Prativa Devi (Smt.) v. T.V.\nKrishnan, (1996) 5 SCC 353;\nSatya Gupta (Smt.) @ Madhu\nGupta v.

Shakuntala\n[AIR 2002 SC 1428], the\nSupreme Court held that it is permissible to interfere even\non question of fact but it may be only in \"very exceptional\ncases and on extreme perversity that the authority to\nexamine the same in extenso stands permissible it is a\nrarity rather than a regularity and thus in fine it can thus\n\nPage 50 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nbe safely concluded that while there is no prohibition as\nsuch, but the power to scrutiny can only be had in very\nexceptional circumstances and upon proper\ncircumspection.\"\n\nSimilar view has been taken in the case\nof\nKashmir Singh v. Harnam Singh & Anr.\n, AIR 2008 SC\n1749.\n\n36. Declaration of relief is always discretionary. If the\ndiscretion is not exercised by the lower court \"in the spirit\nof the statute or fairly or honestly or according to the rules\nof reason and justice\", the order passed by the lower court\ncan be reversed by the superior court. (See:\nMysore State\nRoad Transport Corporation v. Mirja Khasim Ali Beg & Anr.\n,\nAIR 1977 SC 747).\n\n37. There may be exceptional circumstances where the\nHigh Court is compelled to interfere, notwithstanding the\nlimitation imposed by the wording of\nSection 100\nCPC. It\nmay be necessary to do so for the reason that after all the\npurpose of the establishment of courts of justice is to\nrender justice between the parties, though the High Court\nis bound to act with circumspection while exercising such\njurisdiction. In second appeal the court frames the\nsubstantial question of law at the time of admission of the\nappeal and the Court is required to answer all the said\nquestions unless the appeal is finally decided on one or\ntwo of those questions or the court comes to the\nconclusion that the question(s) framed could not be the\nsubstantial question(s) of law. There is no prohibition in law\nto frame the additional substantial question of law if the\nneed so arises at the time of the final hearing of the\n\nPage 51 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nappeal.\n\n17.\nIn the case of\nGurnam Singh\n(supra), the Apex Court has\n\nobserved in paragraphs no.14 an 15 as under:-\n\n\"14. When a substantial question of law can be said to\nhave arisen, has been dealt with and considered by this\nCourt in the case of Ishwar Dass Jain (Supra). In the\naforesaid decision, this Court has specifically observed and\nheld :\n\nUnder\nSection 100\nCPC, after the 1976 amendment,\nit is essential for the High Court to formulate a substantial\nquestion of law and it is not permissible to reverse the\njudgment of the first appellate court without doing so.\nThere are two situations in which interference with findings\nof fact is permissible. The first one is when material or\nrelevant evidence is not considered which, if considered,\nwould have led to an opposite conclusion. The second\nsituation in which interference with findings of fact is\npermissible is where a finding has been arrived at by the\nappellate court by placing reliance on inadmissible\nevidence which if it was omitted, an opposite conclusion\nwas possible. In either of the above situations, a\nsubstantial question of law can arise.\n\n15. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the\naforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand, we are\nof the opinion that the High Court has erred in re\nappreciating the evidence on record in the second appeal\n\nPage 52 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nunder\nSection 100\nof the CPC. The High Court has\nmaterially erred in interfering with the findings recorded by\nthe First Appellate Court, which were on re-appreciation of\nevidence, which was permissible by the First Appellate\nCourt in exercise of powers under\nSection 96\nof the CPC.\n\nCogent reasons, on appreciation of the evidence, were\ngiven by the First Appellate Court. First Appellate Court\ndealt with, in detail, the so called suspicious circumstance\nwhich weighed with the learned Trial Court and thereafter\nit came to the conclusion that the Will, which as such was a\nregistered Will, was genuine and do not suffer from any\nsuspicious circumstances. The findings recorded by the\nFirst Appellate Court are reproduced hereinabove.\nTherefore, while passing the impugned judgment and\norder, the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction while\ndeciding the second appeal under\nSection 100\nCPC.\"\n\n18.\nIn the case of\nSyeda Rahimunnisa\n(supra), the Apex\n\nCourt has observed in paragraphs no.25 to 28 as under:-\n\n\"25. A three-judge Bench of this Court in the case of\n\nSantosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari\nspeaking through\nR.C. Lahoti, J. (as his Lordship then was) examined the\nscope of\nSection 100\nCPC in detail and laid down the\nfollowing propositions in paras 9, 10, 12 and 14 as under:\n\n(SCC pp.185-88)\n\n\"9. The High Court cannot proceed to hear a second appeal\nwithout formulating the substantial question of law\ninvolved in the appeal and if it does so it acts illegally and\n\nPage 53 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nin abnegation or abdication of the duty cast on Court. The\nexistence of substantial question of law is the sine qua non\nfor the exercise of the jurisdiction under the amended\nSection 100 of the Code. (See Kshitish Chandra Purkait v.\n\nSantosh Kumar Purkait (1997) 5 SCC 438, Panchugopal\nBarua v. Umesh Chandra Goswami\n(\n1997) 4 SCC 413\nand Kondiba Dagadu Kadam v. Savitribai Sopan\nGujar\n(1999) 3 SCC 722)\n\n10. At the very outset we may point out that the memo of\nsecond appeal filed by the plaintiff-appellant before the\nHigh Court suffered from a serious infirmity. Section 100 of\nthe Code, as amended in 1976, restricts the jurisdiction of\nthe High Court to hear a second appeal only on\n\"substantial question of law involved in the case\". An\nobligation is cast on the appellant to precisely state in the\nmemorandum of appeal the substantial question of law\ninvolved in the appeal and which the appellant proposes to\nurge before the High Court. The High Court must be\nsatisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in\nthe case and such question has then to be formulated by\nthe High Court. Such questions or question may be the one\nproposed by the appellant or may be any other question\nwhich though not proposed by the appellant yet in the\nopinion of the High Court arises as involved in the case and\nis substantial in nature. At the hearing of the appeal, the\nscope of hearing is circumscribed by the question so\nformulated by the High Court. The respondent is at liberty\nto show that the question formulated by the High Court\nwas not involved in the case In spite of a substantial\nquestion of law determining the scope of hearing of second\n\nPage 54 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nappeal having been formulated by the High Court, its\npower to hear the appeal on any other substantial question\nof law, not earlier formulated by it, is not taken away\nsubject to the twin conditions being satisfied: (i) the High\nCourt feels satisfied that the case involves such question,\nand (ii) the High Court records reasons for its such\nsatisfaction.\n\n12. The phrase \"substantial question of law\", as occurring\nin the amended Section 100 is not defined in the Code. The\nword substantial, as qualifying \"question of law\", means --\nof having substance, essential, real, of sound worth,\nimportant or considerable. It is to be understood as\nsomething in contradistinction with -- technical, of no\nsubstance or consequence, or academic merely. However,\nit is clear that the legislature has chosen not to qualify the\nscope of \"substantial question of law\" by suffixing the\nwords \"of general importance\" as has been done in many\nother provisions such as Section 109 of the Code or\nArticle\n133(1)(a)\nof the Constitution. The substantial question of\nlaw on which a second appeal shall be heard need not\nnecessarily be a substantial question of law of general\nimportance. In Guran Ditta v. T. Ram Ditta (AIR 1928 PC\n\n172), the phrase \"substantial question of law\" as it was\nemployed in the last clause of the then existing\nSection\nCPC (since omitted by the\nAmendment Act, 1973\n)\ncame up for consideration and their Lordships held that it\ndid not mean a substantial question of general importance\nbut a substantial question of law which was involved in the\ncase as between the parties.\nIn Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &\nSons Ltd. v. Century Spg. and Mfg. Co. Ltd.(AIR 1962 SC\n\nPage 55 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n1314) the Constitution Bench expressed agreement with\nthe following view taken by a Full Bench of the Madras\nHigh Court in\nRimmalapudi Subba Rao v. Noony\nVeeraju\n(AIR 1951 Mad 969): (\nChunilal V. Mehta\ncase, AIR\np. 1318 para 5)\n\n5....when a question of law is fairly arguable, where there\nis room for difference of opinion on it or where the Court\nthought it necessary to deal with that question at some\nlength and discuss alternative views, then the question\nwould be a substantial question of law. On the other hand\nif the question was practically covered by the decision of\nthe highest court or if the general principles to be applied\nin determining the question are well settled and the only\nquestion was of applying those principles to the particular\nfacts of the case it would not be a substantial question of\nlaw.\"\n\nAnd laid down the following test as proper test, for\ndetermining whether a question of law raised in the case is\nsubstantial: (AIR p. 1318, para 6)\n\n6....The proper test for determining whether a question of\nlaw raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion,\nbe whether it is of general public importance or whether it\ndirectly and substantially affects the rights of the parties\nand if so whether it is either an open question in the sense\nthat it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy\nCouncil or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty\nor calls for discussion of alternative views. If the question is\nsettled by the highest court or the general principles to be\n\nPage 56 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\napplied in determining the question are well settled and\nthere is a mere question of applying those principles or\nthat the plea raised is palpably absurd the question would\nnot be a substantial question of law.\"\n\n14. A point of law which admits of no two opinions may be\na proposition of law but cannot be a substantial question of\nlaw. To be \"substantial\" a question of law must be\ndebatable, not previously settled by law of the land or a\nbinding precedent, and must have a material bearing on\nthe decision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as\nthe rights of the parties before it are concerned. To be a\nquestion of law \"involving in the case\" there must be first a\nfoundation for it laid in the pleadings and the question\nshould emerge from the sustainable findings of fact arrived\nat by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that\nquestion of law for a just and proper decision of the case.\nAn entirely new point raised for the first time before the\nHigh Court is not a question involved in the case unless it\ngoes to the root of the matter. It will, therefore, depend on\nthe facts and circumstance of each case whether a\nquestion of law is a substantial one and involved in the\ncase, or not; the paramount overall consideration being the\nneed for striking a judicious balance between the\nindispensable obligation to do justice at all stages and\nimpelling necessity of avoiding prolongation in the life of\nany lis\".\n\n26. Again in the case of\nThiagarajan And Others vs. Sri\nVenugopalaswamy B. Koil And Others\nreported in 2004 (5)\nSCC 762, a two Judge Bench of this Court in paragraphs 17,\n\nPage 57 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n24, 25 and 26 observed as under:\n\n\"17. Sub-section (5) of\nSection 100\nCPC says that the\nappeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and\nthe respondent shall at the hearing of the appeal be\nallowed to argue that the case does not involve such a\nquestion. The proviso states that nothing in this sub-\nsection shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power\nof the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal\non any other substantial question of law not formulated by\nit if it is satisfied that the case involves such question. In\nthe instant case, the High Court at the time of final hearing\nformulated five more questions of law as extracted above\nafter hearing the counsel for both sides having miserably\nfailed to record the reasons for formulating the other\nsubstantial questions of law.\n\n24. In our opinion, the High Court has erred in holding that\nthe appellants have failed to establish their title to the suit\nproperty evidently without appreciating the evidence on\nrecord in its proper perspective by making only reference\nto portions of evidence having once decided to\nreappreciate the evidence. The High Court, in our opinion,\nought to have examined the entire evidence both oral and\ndocumentary instead of only a portion thereof especially\nwhile deciding to look into and reappreciate the evidence\ndespite the limited scope under\nSection 100\nCPC. In our\nview, the learned Single Judge of the High Court has\nexceeded his jurisdiction in reassessing, reappreciating\nand making a roving enquiry by entering into the factual\narena of the case which is not the one contemplated under\n\nPage 58 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nthe limited scope of jurisdiction of a second appeal under\n\nSection 100\nCPC.\n\n25. In the present case, the lower appellate court fairly\nappreciated the evidence and arrived at a conclusion that\nthe appellants' suit was to be decreed and that the\nappellants are entitled to the relief as prayed for. Even\nassuming that another view is possible on a reappreciation\nof the same evidence, that should not have been done by\nthe High Court as it cannot be said that the view taken by\nthe first appellate court was based on no material.\n\n26. To say the least the approach of the High Court was\nnot proper. It is the obligation of the courts of law to\nfurther the clear intendment of the legislature and not\nfrustrate it by excluding the same. This Court in a catena of\ndecisions held that where findings of fact by the lower\nappellate court are based on evidence, the High Court in\nsecond appeal cannot substitute its own findings on\nreappreciation of evidence merely on the ground that\nanother view was possible\". (emphasis in original)\n\n27. Reverting to the facts of the case at hand and\nkeeping in view the aforesaid principles of law in mind, we\nfind that the High Court while admitting the second appeal\nhad formulated the following questions:\n\n1. Whether the finding of the Court below, that the suit\nsite on O.S.No.53/93 in S.No.35/5, Ex.C.I AI and the leased\nsite, surrendered by P.W.6 in S.No.35/5 CI A 19 arc one and\nthe same, is vitiated by its failure to consider the\n\nPage 59 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nadmissions of D.W.I and the relevant documentary\nevidence, which establish that there was a sub-division of\nS.No.35/5, the suit site is S.No.35/5, CI Ex.A.I being a\nGovernment poramboke land and the site of the defendant\nclassified as a \"Darga Burial Ground Mosque\", each distinct\nand different from the other? Admissions of D.W. 1:\n\n2 Whether the Court below have failed to see that\nEx.A.2 (Gift deed being a thirty year old document, the\npresumption under\nSection 90\nof Evidence Act applies,\nboth with regard to execution and attestation, and as such\nthe opinion of the trial Court that it is suspicious document,\nis untenable and unsustainable in law?\n\n3. Whether the lower appellate Court erred in law in not\nframing proper points for consideration, on the validity of\nEx.A.2 gift deed and the sub- division of suit property\nS.No.35/5 C1A1, as required under Order 41 Rule 31 C.P.C.\n\nand as such the Judgment of the lower appellate Court as a\nfinal Court of fact is vitiated by errors of law?\n\n4. Whether the lower appellate Court has erred in law,\nin holding that Ex.A2 gift deed is invalid, because the\nproperty gifted is poramboke, when the Government itself\n(second defendant) has not disputed either the long\npossession or possessory title of the plaintiff of the suit\nproperty?\n\n5. Whether the lower appellate Court has erred in law\non the question of title, merely by adverting to Ex.A.3,\nEx.A.4, Ex.A.5 - tax receipts, and the entire reasoning is\n\nPage 60 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nbased on mere guess work ignoring the relevant and\nclinching documentary evidence?\n\n6. Whether the finding of the lower appellate Court that\nP.W.6 (plaintiff's son) did not vacate the site even after the\nlease period of the site S.No.35/5 C1A19 of D.I is not based\non any evidence except the word of D.W.2 (no witnesses\nwee examined) and the conclusion reached by it that the\nsuit site in O.S.No.53/93 and the leased site are the same,\nis contrary to the evidence on record?\n\n7. Whether the lower appellate Court has erred in law in\nits failure to consider the admission of D.W.2 himself that\nhis father encroached into the plaintiff's site and was\nissued B-Memos and paid the penalty, which conclusively\nestablishes that the two sites are different and not one and\nthe same?\n\n8. Whether the very approach of the lower appellate\nCourt is essentially erroneous and its findings are liable to\nbe set aside (\nJagdish Singh v. Natthu Singh\nAIR 1992 S.C.,\n1604)?\n\n28. In our considered opinion, the aforementioned\nquestions cannot be regarded as satisfying the test of\nbeing a \"substantial questions of law\" within the meaning\nof\nSection 100\nof CPC. These questions, in our view, are\nessentially questions of fact. In any event, the second\nappeal did not involve any substantial questions of law as\ncontemplated under\nSection 100\nof CPC and lastly no case\nwas made out by the respondents before the High Court\n\nPage 61 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nfor remanding of the case to the trial court for de novo trial\nin all the civil suits. This we say for following reasons.\n\n19.\nIn the case of\nPanchugopal Barua\n(supra), the Apex\n\nCourt has observed in paragraphs no.7 and 8 as under:-\n\n\"7. A bare look at Section 100.\nCode of Civil\nProcedure\nshows that the jurisdiction of the High Court to\nentertain a second appeal after the 1976 amendment is\nconfined only to such appeals as involve a substantial\nquestion of law, specifically set out in the memorandum of\nappeal and formulated by the High Court. Of course, the\nproviso to the Section shows that nothing shall be deemed\nto take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for\nreasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other\nsubstantial question of law, not formulated by it, if the\nCourt is satisfied that the case involves such a question.\nThe proviso presupposes that the Court shall indicate in its\norder the substantial question of law which it proposes to\ndecide even if such substantial question of law was not\nearlier formulated by it. The existence of a \"substantial\nquestion of law\" is thus, the sine qua non for the exercise\nof the jurisdiction under the amended provisions of Section\n100, C. P. C.\n\n8. Generally speaking, an appellant is not to be allowed\nto set up a new case in second appeal or raise a new issue\n(otherwise than a jurisdictional one ), not supported by the\npleadings or evidence on the record and unless the appeal\n\nPage 62 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\ninovles a substantial question of law, a second appeal shall\nnot lie to the High Court under the amended provisions. In\nthe present case, no such question of law was formulated\nin the memorandum of appeal in the High Court and\ngrounds (6) and (7) in the memorandum of the second\nappeal on which reliance is placed did not formulate any\nsubstantial question of law. The learned single Judge of the\nHigh Court also, as it transpires from a perusal of the\nJudgement under appeal, did not formulate any substantial\nquestion of law in the appeal and dealt with the second\nappeal, not on any substantial question of law, but treating\nit as if it was a first appeal, as of right, against the\nJudgement and decree of the subordinate Court. The\nintendment of the legislature in amending\nSection\n, Code of Civil Procedure was, thus, respected in its\nbreach. Both the trial Court and the lower Appellate Court\nhad decided the case only on questions of fact, on the\nbasis of the pleadings and the evidence led by the parties\nbefore the trial Court. No pure question of law nor even a\nmixed question of law and fact was urged before the trial\nCourt or the First Appellate Court by the respondent. The\nHigh Court was, therefore, not justified in entertaining the\nsecond appeal on an altogether new point, neither pleaded\nnor canvassed in the subordinate Courts and that too by\noverlooking the changes brought about in\nSection\n, Code of Civil Procedure by the Amendment Act of\n1976 without even indicating that a substantial question of\nlaw was required to be resolved in the second appeal. To\nsay the least, the approach of the High Court was not\nproper. It is the obligation of the Courts of law to further\nthe clear intendment of the legislature and not to frustrate\n\nPage 63 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nit by ignoring the same.\n\n20.\nIn the case of\nKondiba Dagadu Kadam\n(supra), the Apex\n\nCourt has observed in paragraphs no.3 to 7 as under:-\n\n\"3. After the amendment a second appeal can be filed\nonly if a substantial question of law is involved in the case.\nThe memorandum of appeal must precisely state the\nsubstantial question of law involved and the High Court is\nobliged to satisfy itself regarding the existence of such\nquestion. If satisfied, the High Court has to formulate the\nsubstantial question of law involved in the case. The\nappeal is required to be heard on the question so\nformulated. However, the respondent at the time of the\nhearing of the appeal has a right to argue that the case in\nthe court did not involve any substantial question of law.\nThe proviso to the Section acknowledges the powers of the\nHigh Court to hear the appeal on a substantial point of law,\nthough not formulated by it with the object of ensuring\nthat no injustice is done to the litigant where such question\nwas not formulated at the time of admission either by\nmistake or by inadvertence.\n\n4. It has been noticed time and again that without\ninsisting for the statement of such substantial question of\nlaw in the memorandum of appeal and formulating the\nsame at the time of admission, the High Courts have been\nissuing notices and generally deciding the second appeals\nwithout adhering to the procedure prescribed\nu/s. 100\n,\nCode of Civil Procedure. It has further been found in a\n\nPage 64 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nnumber of cases that no efforts are made to distinguish\nbetween a question of law and a substantial question of\nlaw. In exercise of the powers under this Section the\nfindings of fact of the 1st appellate Court are found to have\nbeen disturbed. It has to be kept in mind that the right of\nappeal is neither a natural nor an inherent right attached\nto the litigation. Being a substantive statutory right, it has\nto be regulated in accordance with law in force at the\nrelevant time. The conditions mentioned in the Section\nmust be strictly fulfilled before a second appeal can be\nmaintained and no court has the power to add to or\nenlarge those grounds. The second appeal cannot be\ndecided on merely equitable grounds. The concurrent\nfindings of facts howsoever erroneous cannot be disturbed\nby the High Court in exercise of the powers under this\nSection. The substantial question of law has to be\ndistinguished from a substantial question of fact. This\nCourt in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons Ltd. V/s. Century\nSpinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1314\nheld that :-\n\n\"The proper test for determining whether a question of law\nraised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion, be\nwhether it is of general public importance or whether it\ndirectly and substantially affects the rights of the parties\nand if so whether it is either an open question in the sense\nthat it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy\nCouncil or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty\nor calls for discussion of alternative views. If the question is\nsettled by the highest Court or the general principles to be\napplied in determining the question are well settled and\n\nPage 65 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nthere is a mere question of applying those principles or\nthat the plea raised is palpably absurd the question would\nnot be a substantial question of law.\"\n\n5. It is not within the domain of the High Court to\ninvestigate the grounds on which the findings were arrived\nat, by the last court of fact, being the first appellate Court.\nIt is true that the lower appellate Court should not\nordinarily reject witnesses accepted by the trial Court in\nrespect of credibility but even where it has rejected the\nwitnesses accepted by the trial court, the same is no\nground for interference in second appeal when it is found\nthat the appellate Court has given satisfactory reasons for\ndoing so. In a case where from a given set of\ncircumstances two inferences are possible, one drawn by\nthe lower appellate Court is binding on the High Court in\nsecond appeal. Adopting any other approach is not\npermissible. The High Court cannot substitute its opinion\nfor the opinion of the first appellate Court unless it is found\nthat the conclusions drawn by the lower appellate Court\nwere erroneous being contrary to the mandatory\nprovisions of law applicable or its settled position on the\nbasis of pronouncements made by the apex Court, or was\nbased upon inadmissible evidence or arrived at without\nevidence.\n\n6. If the question of law termed as substantial question\nstands already decided by a larger bench of the High Court\nconcerned or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court\nor by the Supreme Court, its merely wrong application on\nfacts of the case would not be termed to be a substantial\n\nPage 66 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nquestion of law. Where a point of law has not been pleaded\nor is found to be arising between the parties in the\nabsence of any factual format, a litigant should not be\nallowed to raise that question as substantial question of\nlaw in second appeal. The mere appreciation of the facts,\nthe documentary evidence or the meaning of entries and\nthe contents of the document cannot be held to be raising\na substantial question of law. But where it is found that the\nfirst appellate Court has assumed jurisdiction which did not\nvest in it, the same can be adjudicated in the second\nappeal, treating it as substantial question of law. Where\nthe first appellate Court is shown to have exercised its\ndiscretion in a judicial manner, it cannot be termed to be\nan error either of law or of procedure requiring interference\nin second appeal. This Court in Reserve Bank of\nIndia V/s. Ramakrishna Govind Morey, AIR 1976 SC 830 :\n\n(1976 Lab IC 575) held that whether trial Court should not\nhave exercised its jurisdiction differently is not a question\nof law justifying interference.\"\n\n21.\nIn the case of\nRoshan Singh\n(supra), the Apex Court has\n\nobserved in paragraph no.12 as under:-\n\n\"12.

Where the High Court is satisfied that in any case\n\nany substantial question of law is involved it shall formulate that\n\nquestion under sub-section (4) and the second appeal has to be\n\nheard on the question so formulated as stated in sub-section (5)\n\nof Section 100. Meaning thereby unless there is substantial\n\nquestion involved in the present appeal or it is framed by the\n\nPage 68 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nCourt, the appeal cannot be entertained or heard by the High\n\nCourt.\n\n24. Considering the proviso of Section 100 is to the effect that\n\nnothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or\n\nabridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be\n\nrecorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law,\n\nnot formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such\n\nquestion. It is abundantly clear that when a question of law is\n\nfairly arguable, where there is room for difference of opinion on it\n\nor where the Court thought it necessary to deal with that\n\nquestion at some length and discuss alternative views, then the\n\nquestion would be a substantial question of law. On the other\n\nhand if the question was practically covered by the decision of\n\nthe highest court or if the general principles to be applied in\n\ndetermining the question are well settled and the only question\n\nwas of applying those principles to the particular facts of the\n\ncase it would not be a substantial question of law. In the present\n\nappeal, learned counsel has suggested the following questions of\n\nlaw:\n\nPage 69 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n1. Whether the Lambha Khat in question is admissible in\nevidence without the same being registered as\nrequired under law?\n\n2. Whether the Courts below have materially erred in\nconstruing the documents on record, more\nparticularly the Lambha Khat in question?\n\n3. Whether the reliefs as granted by the Courts below\ncould have been granted in view of the frame of the\nsuit and the documents on record?\n\n4. Whether the decree as passed by the Courts below\nwithout firstly adjudicating the exact shares of parties\nand exactly demarcating the properties in question, is\nin violation of the provisions of law?\n\n5. Whether the alleged sale deed, Exh.84 is valid under\nlaw and binding to the Appellants?\n\n6. Whether the suit of the Plaintiff is barred by law of\nlimitation?\n\n7. Whether the Courts below have materially erred in\nrecording various findings on the basis of the\nproceedings before the Revenue authorities, without\nindependently appreciating the evidences tendered\non record?\n\n8. Whether the Appellant can be considered to have\nperfected their title by adverse possession against\nthe Respondents?\n\n25. It is profitable to referred to the decision of the Apex Court\n\nin the case of\nK.Arumuga Velaiah Vs. P. R. Ramasamy and\n\nanother\n, reported in (2022) 3 SCC 757 wherein the Apex\n\nPage 70 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nCourt, while referring to its earlier decision in the case of\nKale\n\nVs. Director of Consolidation\nreported in (1976) 3 SCC 119,\n\nhas observed in paragraphs no.33, 34, 35, 36, 44, 46 and 48 as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"33.\nKale and Ors. v. Deputy Director of Consolidation\n, is\na case which had a checkered history in which a discussion\non the effect and value of family arrangements entered\ninto between the parties with a view to resolve disputes\nonce and for all, came up for consideration. It was\nobserved that in the case of a family settlement, usually\nthere would be an agreement which is implied from a long\ncourse of dealing, but such an agreement would be\nembodied or effectuated in a deed to which the\nterm family arrangement is applied. Such a family\narrangement is not applicable to dealings between\nstrangers but is in the context of maintaining the interest\nand peace of the members of the family.\n\n34.\nIn paragraph 10 of\nthe said judgment\n, this Court has\nadumbrated on the essentials of a family settlement which\ncould be usefully extracted as under: (\nKale\ncase, SCC pp.\n126-27)\n\n\"10. In other words to put the binding effect and the\nessentials of a family settlement in a concretized form, the\nmatter may be reduced into the form of the following\npropositions:\n\n(1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to\n\nPage 71 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nresolve family disputes and rival claims by a fair and\nequitable division or allotment of properties between the\nvarious members of the family;\n\n(2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should\nnot be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence;\n(3) The family arrangements may be even oral in which\ncase no registration is necessary;\n\n(4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary\nonly if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced\ninto writing. Here also, a distinction should be made\nbetween a document containing the terms and recitals of a\nfamily arrangement made under the document and a mere\nmemorandum prepared after the family arrangement had\nalready been made either for the purpose of the record or\nfor information of the Court for making necessary\nmutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not\ncreate or extinguish any rights in immoveable properties\nand therefore does not fall within the mischief of\nSection\n17(2)\n[sic (\nSection 17(1)(b)\n?] of the\nRegistration Act\nand is,\ntherefore, not compulsorily registrable;\n(5) The members who may be parties to the family\narrangement must have some antecedent title, claim or\ninterest even a possible claim in the property which is\nacknowledged by the parties to the settlement.\n\nEven if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but\nunder the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its\nclaims or titles in favour of such a person and\nacknowledges him to be the sole owner, then the\nantecedent title must be assumed and the family\narrangement will be upheld, and the Courts will find no\ndifficulty in giving assent to the same;\n\nPage 72 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n(6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which\nmay not involve legal claims are settled by a bona fide\nfamily arrangement which is fair and equitable the family\narrangement is final and binding on the parties to the\nsettlement. (emphasis in original)\n\n35. After reviewing several judgments of this Court, the\nPrivy Council and other High Courts, this Court in\nparagraph 20 indicated the following propositions: (\nKale\n\ncase, SCC p. 130)\n\n\"20....We would, therefore return the reference with a\nstatement of the following general propositions:\n\n(1) A family arrangement can be made orally.\n\n(2) If made orally, there being no document, no question\nof registration arises.\n\n(3) If though it could have been made orally, it was in\nfact reduced to the form of a \"document\" registration\n(when the value is Rs. 100 and upwards) is necessary.\n\n(4) Whether the terms have been \"reduced to the form of\na document\" is a question of fact in each case to be\ndetermined upon a consideration of the nature and\nphraseology of the writing and the circumstances in which\nand the purpose with which it was written.\n\n(5) If the terms were not \"reduced to the form of a\ndocument\", registration was not necessary (even though\n\nPage 73 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nthe value is Rs. 100 or upwards); and, while the writing\ncannot be used as a piece of evidence for what it may be\nworth, e.g. as corroborative of other evidence or as an\nadmission of the transaction or as showing or explaining\nconduct.\n\n(6) If the terms were \"reduced to the form of a\ndocument\" and, though the value was Rs. 100 or upwards,\nit was not registered, the absence of registration makes\nthe document inadmissible in evidence and is fatal to proof\nof the arrangement embodied in the document.\n\n36. Ultimately, this Court held that the family\narrangement in the nature of a compromise which was\nconsidered\nin that case\ndid not require registration. It was\nfurther held that since the existence of the family\narrangement was admitted\nin that case\n, the same was\nbinding on the principle of estoppel. Also, even if the family\narrangement could not be registered it could be used for\ncollateral purpose, i.e. to show the nature and character of\npossession of the parties in pursuance of the family\nsettlement and also for the purpose of applying the rule of\nestoppel which flowed from the conduct of the parties,\nwho, having taken benefit under the settlement for seven\nyears, later tried to resile from the settlement.\n\n44. For a better understanding of the same it would be\nuseful to refer to\nsection 17 (1) (e)\nand\n17 (2) (v)\nas under:\n\n17. Documents of which registration is compulsory. (l) The\nfollowing documents shall be registered, if the property to\n\nPage 74 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nwhich they relate is situate in a district in which, and if\nthey have been executed on or after the date on which,\nAct No. XVI of 1864, or the\nIndian Registration Act, 1866\n, or\nthe\nIndian Registration Act, 1871\n, or the\nIndian\nRegistration Act, 1877\n, or this Act came or comes into\nforce, namely:-\n\n* * *\n\n(b) other non testamentary instruments which purport or\noperate to create, declare, assign, limit or\nextinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title\nor interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of\none hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immovable\nproperty;\n\n* * *\n\n(2) Nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (l)\napplies to:\n\n(v) any document other than the documents specified in\nsub section (1-A) not itself creating,\n\ndeclaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing any right,\ntitle or interest of the value of one hundred rupees and\nupwards to or in immovable property, but merely creating\na right to obtain another document which will, when\nexecuted, create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any\nsuch right, title or interest.\"\n\n46. In the instant case exhibit B 13 award is more in the\n\nPage 75 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nnature of a memorandum of understanding, a mere\nagreement of the steps to be taken in future for the\ndivision of the properties. Hence, the said document did\nnot require registration under\nSection 17 (1) (b)\nof the Act\nas under the said document no creation of rights in any\nspecific joint family property was effected. Hence the\nsecond limb of the contention of the appellant is\naccordingly answered.\n\n48. In our view, Ext. B-13 did not require registration.\n\n26. It is profitable to referred to the decision of the Apex Court\n\nin the case\nKashmir Singh Vs. Harnam Singh\nreported in\n\n(2008) 12 SCC 786 wherein the Apex Court has observed in\n\nparagraphs no.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15 as under:-\n\n\"9. It has been noted time and again that without insisting for\nthe statement of such a substantial question of law in the\nmemorandum of appeal and formulating the same at the time of\nadmission, the High Courts have been issuing notices and generally\ndeciding the second appeals without adhering to the procedure\nprescribed u/s. 100 of the Code. It has further been found in a\nnumber of cases that no efforts are made to distinguish between a\nquestion of law and a substantial question of law. In exercise of the\npowers under this section in several cases, the findings of fact of\nthe first appellate court are found to have been disturbed. It has to\nbe kept in mind that the right of appeal is neither a natural nor an\ninherent right attached to the litigation. Being a substantive\nstatutory right, it has to be regulated in accordance with law in\nforce at the relevant time. The conditions mentioned in the section\n\nPage 76 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nmust be strictly fulfilled before a second appeal can be maintained\nand no court has the power to add or to enlarge those grounds. The\nsecond appeal cannot be decided on merely equitable grounds. The\nconcurrent findings of facts will not be disturbed by the High Court\nin exercise of the powers under this section. Further, a substantial\nquestion of law has to be distinguished from a substantial question\nof fact. This Court in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons Ltd. V/s.\nCentury Spg. & Mfg. Co. Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1314 held that :\n\n\"The proper test for determining whether a question of law\nraised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion, be\nwhether it is of general public importance or whether it\ndirectly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and\nif so whether it is either an open question in the sense that it\nis not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or\nby the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or calls for\ndiscussion of alternative views. If the question is settled by\nthe highest court or the general principles to be applied in\ndetermining the question are well settled and there is a\nmere question of applying those principles or that the plea\nraised is palpably absurd the question would not be a\nsubstantial question of law.\"\n\n10. It is not within the domain of the High Court to\ninvestigate the grounds on which the findings were arrived\nat, by the last court of fact, being the first appellate court. It\nis true that the lower appellate court should not ordinarily\nreject witnesses accepted by the trial court in respect of\ncredibility but even where it has rejected the witnesses\naccepted by the trial court, the same is no ground for\ninterference in second appeal when it is found that the\nappellate court has given satisfactory reasons for doing\nso. In a case where from a given set of circumstances two\ninferences of fact are possible, one drawn by the lower\nappellate court will not be interfered by the High Court in\nsecond appeal. Adopting any other approach is not\n\nPage 77 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\npermissible. The High Court will, however, interfere where it\nis found that the conclusions drawn by the lower appellate\ncourt were erroneous being contrary to the mandatory\nprovisions of law applicable or its settled position on the\nbasis of pronouncements made by the Apex Court, or was\nbased upon inadmissible evidence or arrived at by ignoring\nmaterial evidence.\n\n11. The question of law raised will not be considered as a\nsubstantial question of law, if it stands already decided by a\nlarger Bench of the High Court concerned or by the Privy\nCouncil or by the Federal Court or by the Supreme Court.\nWhere the facts required for a point of law have not been\npleaded, a litigant should not be allowed to raise that\nquestion as a substantial question of law in second\nappeal. Mere appreciation of facts, the documentary\nevidence or the meaning of entries and the contents of the\ndocuments cannot be held to be raising a substantial\nquestion of law. But where it is found that the first appellate\ncourt has assumed jurisdiction which did not vest in it, the\nsame can be adjudicated in the second appeal, treating it as\na substantial question of law. Where the first appellate court\nis shown to have exercised its discretion in a judicial\nmanner, it cannot be termed to be an error either of law or\nof procedure requiring interference in second appeal. This\nCourt in Reserve Bank of India V/s. Ramkrishna Govind\nMorey, 1976 1 SCC 803 held that whether the trial court\nshould not have exercised its jurisdiction differently is not a\nquestion of law justifying interference.(See: Kondiba Dogadu\nKadam V/s. Savitribai Sopan Gujar and Others, 1999 3 SCC\n\n722).\n\n12. The phrase \"substantial question of law\", as occurring\nin the amended Sec. 100 is not defined in the Code. The\nword substantial, as qualifying \"question of law\", means of\nhaving substance, essential, real, of sound worth, important\n\nPage 78 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nor considerable. It is to be understood as something in\ncontradistinction with technical, of no substance or\nconsequence, or academic merely. However, it is clear that\nthe legislature has chosen not to qualify the scope of\n\"substantial question of law\" by suffixing the words \"of\ngeneral importance\" as has been done in many other\nprovisions such as\nArt. 133(1)(a)\nof the Constitution. The\nsubstantial question of law on which a second appeal shall\nbe heard need not necessarily be a substantial question of\nlaw of general importance. In Guran Ditta V/s. T. Ram Ditta,\nAIR 1928 PC 172, the phrase 'substantial question of law' as\nit was employed in the last clause of the then existing Sec.\n100 (since omitted by the\nAmendment Act, 1973\n) came up\nfor consideration and their Lordships held that it did not\nmean a substantial question of general importance but a\nsubstantial question of law which was involved in the case.\n\nIn\nSri Chunilal\n's case (supra), the Constitution Bench\nexpressed agreement with the following view taken by a full\nBench of the Madras High Court in Rimmalapudi Subba Rao\nV/s. Noony Veeraju, AIR 1951 Mad 969:\n\n\"When a question of law is fairly arguable, where there is\nroom for difference of opinion on it or where the Court\nthought it necessary to deal with that question at some\nlength and discuss alternative views, then the question\nwould be a substantial question of law. On the other hand if\nthe question was practically covered by the decision of the\nhighest court or if the general principles to be applied in\ndetermining the question are well settled and the only\nquestion was of applying those principles to the particular\nfacts of the case it would not be a substantial question of\nlaw.\"\n\n13. This Court laid down the following test as proper test,\nfor determining whether a question of law raised in the case\nis substantial as quoted in\nSir Chunilal\n's case (supra).\n\nPage 79 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n15. To be \"substantial\" a question of law must be\ndebatable, not previously settled by law of the land or a\nbinding precedent, and must have a material bearing on the\ndecision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as the\nrights of the parties before it are concerned. To be a\nquestion of law \"involving in the case\" there must be first a\nfoundation for it laid in the pleadings and the question\nshould emerge from the sustainable findings of fact arrived\nat by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that\nquestion of law for a just and proper decision of the case. An\nentirely new point raised for the first time before the High\nCourt is not a question involved in the case unless it goes to\nthe root of the matter. It will, therefore, depend on the facts\nand circumstance of each case whether a question of law is\na substantial one and involved in the case, or not; the\nparamount overall consideration being the need for striking\na judicious balance between the indispensable obligation to\ndo justice at all stages and impelling necessity of avoiding\nprolongation in the life of any lis. (See :Santosh Hazari V/s.\nPurushottam Tiwari (deceased) by Lrs., 2001 3 SCC 179).\n\n27. Considering the questions suggested by the learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellants, it does not require any\n\nfurther hearing or re-determination. The question is practically\n\ncovered by the decision of the highest court and/or there is no\n\nfurther determination of any of the questions suggested by the\n\nlearned counsel is required. Considering the test which is\n\nenumerated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nSir Chunilal\n's case\n\nPage 80 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n(supra) for determining whether a question of law raised in a\n\ngiven case is substantial question. The substantial question of\n\nlaw must be debatable, not previously settled by law of the land\n\nor a binding precedent, and must have a material bearing on the\n\ndecision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as the rights\n\nof the parties before it are concerned. To be a question of law\n\n\"involving in the case\" there must be first a foundation for it laid\n\nin the pleadings and the question should emerge from the\n\nsustainable findings of fact arrived at by court of facts and it\n\nmust be necessary to decide that question of law for a just and\n\nproper decision of the case. An entirely new point raised for the\n\nfirst time before the High Court is not a question involved in the\n\ncase unless it goes to the root of the matter. It will, therefore,\n\ndepend on the facts and circumstance of each case whether a\n\nquestion of law is a substantial one and involved in the case, or\n\nnot; the paramount overall consideration being the need for\n\nstriking a judicious balance between the indispensable obligation\n\nto do justice at all stages and impelling necessity of avoiding\n\nprolongation in the life of any lis.\n\nPage 81 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\n28. The principles relating to Section 100 relevant for this case\n\nmay be summarized thus:-\n\n(i) An inference of fact from the recitals or contents of a\ndocument is a question of fact. But the legal effect of\nthe terms of a document is a question of law.\n\nConstruction of a document involving the application\nof any principle of law, is also a question of law.\nTherefore, when there is misconstruction of a\ndocument or wrong application of a principle of law in\nconstruing a document, it gives rise to a question of\nlaw.\n\n(ii) The High Court should be satisfied that the case\ninvolves a substantial question of law, and not a mere\nquestion of law. A question of law having a material\nbearing on the decision of the case (that is, a\nquestion, answer to which affects the rights of parties\nto the suit) will be a substantial question of law, if it is\nnot covered by any specific provisions of law or\nsettled legal principle emerging from binding\nprecedents, and, involves a debatable legal issue. A\nsubstantial question of law will also arise in a contrary\nsituation, where the legal position is clear, either on\naccount of express provisions of law or binding\nprecedents, but the court below has decided the\nmatter, either ignoring or acting contrary to such legal\nprinciple. In the second type of cases, the substantial\nquestion of law arises not because the law is still\ndebatable, but because the decision rendered on a\n\nPage 82 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nmaterial question, violates the settled position of law.\n\n29. Therefore, in the general rule, High Court will not interfere\n\nwith concurrent findings of the Courts below. But it is not an\n\nabsolute rule. Some of the well recognized exceptions are where\n\n(i) the courts below have ignored material evidence or acted on\n\nno evidence; (ii) the courts have drawn wrong inferences from\n\nproved facts by applying the law erroneously; or (iii) the courts\n\nhave wrongly cast the burden of proof. When we refer to\n\n'decision based on no evidence', it not only refers to cases where\n\nthere is a total dearth of evidence, but also refers to any case,\n\nwhere the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable\n\nof supporting the finding.\n\n30. In view of the aforesaid settled principles, it appears that\n\nthe both the Courts below have not committed any error either\n\non facts or on law. As per the decision of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of\nGurnam Singh\n(supra), framing of substantial question\n\nof law is a sine qua non for the exercise of the jurisdiction under\n\nSection 100 of the Code. Considering the issue involved in the\n\npresent appeal and the contentions raised on the basis of the\n\nPage 83 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nfactual aspects of the matter, this Court not thought it fit to enter\n\ninto the factual aspects which does not involved any substantial\n\nquestion of law.\nIt is also relevant to note here that the re-\n\nappreciation of the evidence is impermissible by this court while\n\nexercising the jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code.\n\n31. Considering all the contentions raised in the appeal, this\n\nCourt has no hesitation to show that in the present appeal no\n\nsubstantial question is involved as the question suggested by the\n\nappellants with regard to more or less re-appreciation of the\n\nevidence recorded by the Trial Court which is permissible under\n\nthe jurisdiction of Section 100 of the Code.\n\n32. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case,\n\nsubmissions canvassed by the learned counsel for the respective\n\nparties and the decisions cited at the Bar, I find no reason to\n\nentertain the present appeal.\n\n33. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal fails and it is\n\naccordingly dismissed. The Trial Court shall direct to implement\n\nthe impugned judgment and decree in its true spirit and hand\n\nPage 84 of 85\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022\n\nC/SA/365/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022\n\nover the possession to the original plaintiffs within three months\n\nfrom the date of receipt of the copy of the order, if it is not\n\nhanded over by the defendants by metes and bounds.\n\n34. In view of the disposal of the main appeal, connected civil\n\napplications shall stand disposed of. Interim relief, if any, granted\n\nearlier shall stand vacated forthwith.\n\nSd/-\n\n(HEMANT M. PRACHCHHAK,J)\n\nFURTHER ORDER\n\nAfter pronouncement of the judgment, the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the appellants has requested to stay the\n\nimplementation and operation of the judgment. However, it\n\nseems that the stay is operating since 1982 and they are fighting\n\nfor the cause and, therefore, the request made by learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellants is not just and proper.\n\nHence, the request is not accepted.\n\nSd/-\n\n(HEMANT M.
