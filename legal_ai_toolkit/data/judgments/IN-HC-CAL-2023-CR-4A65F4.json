  "text": "Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side)\n\nMohammed Chand vs Unknown on 2 November, 2023\n\n02.11.2023\nCourt No.8\n(D/L 02)\n(AK) CRM (NDPS) 1802 OF 2023\n\nIn Re: An application for bail under\nSection 439\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 filed on 25.10.2023 in connection with\nNDPS Case No. 38 of 2019 arising out of NCB Crime No.\n23/NCB/KOL/2019 dated 13.12.2019 under\nSection 8(c)\nread with\n\nSection 20(b)(ii)(C)\n//\n27A\n/\n/\nof the N.D.P.S. Act, 1985.\n\nAnd\n\nIn the matter of: Mohammed Chand\n... Petitioner.\n\nMr. Malay Bhattacharyya\n... for the petitioner.\n\nMr. Dhiraj Trivedi,\nMr. Sagar Saha\n... for the NCB.\n\n1.\nHeard Shri Malay Bhattacharyya, learned counsel for the\n\napplicant and Shri Dhiraj Trivedi, learned Deputy Solicitor General,\n\nGovernment of India.\n\n2. This is the fourth time that bail application has been filed by the\n\napplicant praying for bail in NDPS Case No. 38 of 2019 arising out of\n\nNCB Crime No. 23/NCB/KOL/2019 dated 13.12.2019 under\nSection\n\n8(c)\nread with\nSection 20(b)(ii)(C)\n//\n27A\n/\n/\nof the N.D.P.S. Act,\n\n1985 pending in the Court of Judge, Special Court/Additional District\n\nJudge, 4th Court, Malda.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is\n\nlanguishing in jail since 11.10.2019 and charges have not yet been\n\nframed. He submits that on account of such a long delay in framing\nthe charges, the applicant deserves to be enlarged on bail. He further\n\nsubmits that other co-accused persons have been granted bail.\n\n4. Learned Deputy Solicitor General, Government of India has\n\nvehemently opposed the bail. He submits that the delay in framing of\n\nthe charges is totally attributable to the applicant. He submits that\n\nbail application of the applicant was rejected thrice by orders dated\n\n06.05.2022, 23.02.2023 and 06.07.2023. He submits that the Court\n\nmay also peruse true copy of the order sheet filed along with the bail\n\npetition which discloses that original records of the case remained with\n\nthe High Court and it was returned only to the Trial Court on\n\n28.08.2023. The records were summoned at the instance of the\n\napplicant in CRR No. 2421 of 2022. He further submits that against\n\nthe order dated 09.07.2020 passed in CRM 4519 of 2020 with CRAN\n\n2671 of 2020 regarding extension of period, the petitioner preferred a\n\nSpecial Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No. 5966 of 2020. He submits that the\n\napplicant is the driver of the truck from which 391.40 kg ganja was\n\nrecovered and thus the applicant was the person in charge of the\n\nvehicle from which ganja was recovered. The case of the co-accused\n\nstands on a different footing and no parity can be claimed on that\n\nbasis.\n\n5. We have carefully considered the submissions of the parties.\n\n6. We find that the bail application of the applicant was rejected\n\nthrice by this Court by order dated 06.05.2022 in CRM 3886 of 2021,\norder dated 23.02.2023 in CRM (NDPS) 276 of 2023 and order dated\n\n06.07.2023 in CRM (NDPS) 1067 of 2023.\n\n7. The most recent rejection of the bail application of the applicant\n\nis dated 26.07.2023. No new circumstances have neither been brought\n\nto our notice, nor have been argued.\n\n8. Under the circumstances, we do not find the present case to be\n\na fit case for grant of bail. Accordingly, the bail application of the\n\napplicant is rejected.\n\n9. However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case,\n\nwe expect that the trial shall be concluded by the Trial Court\n\nexpeditiously, preferably within a year.\n\n10. Subject to the above observation, the bail application is rejected.\n\n(SURYA PRAKASH KESARWANI, J.)\n\n(SABYASACHI BHATTACHARYYA, J.)",
