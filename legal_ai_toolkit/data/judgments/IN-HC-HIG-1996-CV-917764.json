Celine Thomas\n\n(2005 KHC 1841) and State Bank of Travancore and Others\n\nv. P.Gopinathan Nair and Others (W.A.No.2185 of 2009\n\ndecided on 10th June, 2011). By the referring order\n\ndated 08.02.2016, the Division Bench made a reference to\n\na larger Bench for authoritative pronouncement on the\n\nwhole issue, in consequence of which the matter has been\n\nplaced before this Full Bench.\n\n2. For answering the reference, it is necessary\n\nto note the facts of both the Original Petitions.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 2 :-\n\nO.P.No.20427 of 1997\n\n3. Petitioner who was working as an Officer in the\n\nCanara Bank retired from service on attaining the age of\n\nsuperannuation on 31.08.1993. Salary revision for\n\nOfficers of Public Sector Banks was discussed by the\n\nIndian Banks' Association (IBA) High Power Committee and\n\nrepresentatives of Officers of Organisations of Public\n\nSector Banks. An agreement dated 23.06.1995 was\n\nentered between the IBA and All India Bank Officers\n\nConfederation wherein various recommendations were made\n\nregarding scales of pay, fitment, dearness allowance,\n\nhouse rent allowance, city compensatory allowance,\n\nprovident fund, advance increment, gratuity and some\n\nother benefits. The agreement also fixed different dates\n\nfor extending various benefits as recommended by the\n\nagreement. Clause 15 of the agreement provided that\n\nscales of pay and dearness allowance shall be revised\n\nfrom 01.07.1993 whereas for entitlement of gratuity,\n\nmedical aid, hospitalisation expenses, second stagnation\n\nincrement in scale III and certain other allowances,\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 3 :-\n\nthe date fixed was 01.11.1994. The petitioner who had\n\nretired on 31.08.1993 although was given the benefit of\n\nrevision of scales of pay and dearness allowance with\n\neffect from 01.07.1993, he was not entitled for gratuity\n\nwhich was made effective from 01.11.1994. Petitioner\n\ndemanded payment of arrears of gratuity due to him on\n\nthe revised scales of pay effected from 01.07.1993, but\n\nthe Bank declined to pay the same on the premise that\n\nas per the proviso to Regulation 46(2) of the Canara\n\nBank (Officers') Service Regulations, 1979 amended in\n\npursuance of the wage settlement, the gratuity payable\n\nto the Officers who retired between 01.07.1993 and\n\n31.10.1994 is to be calculated based on the pre-\n\nrevised scales. Reply dated 27.08.1997 was sent by the\n\nBank to the petitioner rejecting the request for payment\n\nof gratuity based on the revised pay scale.\n\nPetitioner alleging discrimination and unfair treatment\n\nhas filed the Original Petition praying for the\n\nfollowing reliefs:\n\n\"(a) Call for the records relating to Ext.P4 and\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 4 :-\n\ndeclare that part of Ext.P4 amendment which denies\n\ngratuity on the basis of revised basic pay effective from\n\n01.07.1993, to the petitioner and officer employees who\n\nretired during the period 1.7.1993 to 31.10.1994, as\n\nunconstitutional and invalid.\n\n(b) Declare that petitioner is entitled to get\n\ngratuity on the basis of his revised Basic Pay effective\n\nfrom 1.7.1993.\n\n(c) Issue a writ in the nature of Mandamus or\n\nany other appropriate writ, direction or order directing the\n\nrespondent to calculate the gratuity payable to petitioner\n\non the basis of his revised basic pay effective from\n\n1.7.1993 and to pay the petitioner arrears of gratuity\n\nthereof after deducting the gratuity already paid to him,\n\nwith interest at 18% per annum from 16.8.1997 till the\n\ndate of payment.\n\n(d) Issue such other writ, direction or order as\n\nthis Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the\n\ncircumstances of the case.\n\n(e) Award the costs of the petitioner in these\n\nproceedings.\"\n\nO.P. No.3489 of 1997\n\n4. Petitioners who are 18 in number were working\n\nas Officers of the State Bank of Travancore retired\n\nfrom service on attaining the age of superannuation on\n\nvarious dates between 01.07.1993 and 30.10.1994.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 5 :-\n\nSubsequent to the retirement of the petitioners, pay\n\nrevision with regard to various benefits an agreement\n\nwas arrived at between the IBA and the Confederation on\n\n23.06.1995 extending various benefits as noted above.\n\nAlthough all the petitioners received the pensionary\n\nbenefits on the revised scales of pay with effect from\n\n01.07.1993, they were not given any benefit regarding\n\ngratuity. Payment of gratuity is governed by the State\n\nBank of Travancore (Officers) Service Regulations, 1979\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 1979 Regulations).\n\nPetitioners claimed that they are entitled to be paid\n\ngratuity on the basis of revised basic pay drawn by them\n\nand pay having been revised with effect from 01.07.1993\n\nand they having been paid arrears of pay, they are\n\nentitled to get arrears of gratuity on the revised pay\n\neffective from 01.07.1993, hence all the petitioners are\n\nentitled to get arrears of gratuity due to them on their\n\nrevised scales of pay after deducting the gratuity\n\nalready paid. There is artificial classification\n\nbetween the Officers of the Bank who retired between\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 6 :-\n\n01.07.1993 and 31.10.1994 and those who retired on or\n\nafter 01.11.1994. Both of them formed a unified class,\n\nhence non-payment of the benefit on the revised pay\n\nscale for computation of gratuity is arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory and violative of the principles of\n\nequality. Petitioners in the Writ Petition prayed for\n\nthe following reliefs:\n\n(a) Declare that the petitioners are entitled to get\n\ngratuity under Exts.P3 and P4 Regulations calculated on\n\nthe basis of their revised Basic Pay effective from\n\n1.7.1993.\n\n(b) Issue a writ in the nature of Mandamus or\n\nany other appropriate writ, direction or order directing the\n\nrespondent to calculate the gratuity payable to petitioners\n\nunder Exts.P3 and P4 Regulations on the basis of their\n\nrevised basic pay effective from 1.7.1993 and to pay the\n\npetitioners arrears of gratuity thereof after deducting the\n\ngratuity already paid to them, with interest at 18% per\n\nannum from 1.8.1995 till the date of payment.\n\n(c) Issue an interim order directing the\n\nrespondent to calculate the gratuity payable to petitioners\n\nunder Exts.P3 and P4 Regulations on the basis of their\n\nrevised basic pay effective from 1.7.1993 and to pay the\n\npetitioners arrears of gratuity thereof after deducting the\n\ngratuity already paid to them, pending final disposal of the\n\nOriginal Petition.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 7 :-\n\n(d) Issue such other writ, direction or order as\n\nthis Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the\n\ncircumstances of the case\n\nand\n\n(e) Award the costs of the petitioners in these\n\nproceedings.\"\n\n5. Originally, the petitions were heard by a\n\nlearned Single Judge. Before the learned Single Judge,\n\nDivision Bench judgment of this Court in Syndicate Bank\n\nv. Celine Thomas (supra) decided on 08.08.2005 was\n\ncited. The learned Single Judge referring to two\n\njudgments of the Apex Court in State of Punjab and\n\nothers v. Amar Nath Goyal and Others ([2005] 6 SCC 754)\n\nand State of Bihar and Others v. Bihar Pensioners Samaj\n\n([2006] 5 SCC 65) took the view that the judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench in Syndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas\n\n(supra) requires a second look in the light of the later\n\njudgments of the Apex Court. By Order dated 28.05.2007,\n\nthe learned Single Judge adjourned the matter to be\n\nheard by a Division Bench. The matter was then taken\n\nup by the Division Bench which in turn by Reference\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 8 :-\n\nOrder dated 08.02.2016 referred the matter to be placed\n\nbefore a larger Bench in view of the subsequent\n\nDivision Bench decision of this Court in State Bank of\n\nTravancore and Others v. P.Gopinathan Nair and Others\n\n(W.A.No.2185 of 2009 decided on 10th June, 2011).\n\n6. We have heard Shri. Ashok B.Shenoy, learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners, Shri. P.Ramakrishnan,\n\nlearned counsel for the State Bank of Travancore and\n\nSmt. Shahna Karthikeyan the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the Canara Bank.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioners in support\n\nof the Writ Petitions contended that benefit of\n\nrevision of pay scale having been granted with effect\n\nfrom 01.07.1993 and the petitioners having received\n\narrears on the revised pay scale, the said pay scale\n\nought to have been taken into consideration for\n\ncomputation of gratuity. Since the emoluments which is\n\nthe basis for computing gratuity stood revised, the\n\nnon-payment of gratuity on the basis of revised pay\n\nscale is arbitrary and discriminatory, there is no\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 9 :-\n\nrationale for extending the benefit of revised gratuity\n\nonly with effect from 01.11.1994 and when the pay scale\n\nhas been revised with effect from 01.07.1993, all\n\nbenefits should have been extended from the aforesaid\n\nday. It is submitted that computation of gratuity is\n\nbased on statutory regulations, namely, the 1979\n\nRegulations which Regulations provided for computation\n\nof gratuity, hence by a non-statutory order/instrument,\n\nthe statutory provisions of Regulations for computation\n\nof gratuity cannot be modified. Pay revision which was\n\neffected on the basis of an agreement can in no manner\n\naffect any statutory Regulation. It is submitted that no\n\nmaterial has been placed before the Court to the effect\n\nthat the State Bank of Travancore has amended the\n\nStatutory Regulations in accordance with the agreement\n\narrived at, whereas the agreement contemplated amendment\n\nin the Statutory Regulations of different Banks. It is\n\nsubmitted that non-payment of gratuity to those who\n\nretired between 01.07.1993 and 31.10.1994 and payment\n\nof revised gratuity to those who retired after\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 10 :-\n\n01.11.1994 is without any rationale, it is\n\ndiscriminatory, arbitrary and violative of\nArticle 14\n\nof the Constitution of India. Learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners in support of the arguments placed reliance\n\non the judgments of the Apex Court in D.S.Nakara v.\n\nUnion of India ([1983] 1 SCC 305), Chairman, Railway\n\nBoard and Others v. C.R.Rangadhamaiah ([1997] 6 SCC\n\n623), Syndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (2005 KHC 1841)\n\nand LIC of India v. Retired LIC Officers Association\n\n([2008] 3 SCC 321).\n\n8. Learned counsel appearing for the State Bank of\n\nTravancore refuting the submissions of the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners contended that entitlement\n\nof gratuity of the petitioners is crystalized on the\n\ndate of retirement and as per a Statutory Regulation,\n\ntheir gratuity was computed and paid. Subsequent\n\nrevision of pay scale which was enforced with effect\n\nfrom 01.07.1993 can have no effect on payment of\n\ngratuity to the petitioners since the agreement itself\n\nfixed a date for extending the benefit of revised\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 11 :-\n\ngratuity, i.e., with effect from 01.11.1994. When the\n\nbenefits of revision of pay scale, gratuity and other\n\nallowance have been given under a negotiated\n\nsettlement, it is not open for the petitioners to claim\n\nbenefit of part of the agreement and negate another\n\npart of the agreement. The entire settlement has to be\n\naccepted in toto. It is submitted that benefit of the\n\n1979 Regulations for computation of gratuity has already\n\nbeen pressed into service while computing gratuity of\n\npetitioners and making payment of gratuity to the\n\npetitioners on the basis of the existing pay scale.\n\nThere is no further right in the petitioners to claim\n\nredetermination of the gratuity, even if there is any\n\nsubsequent enhancement in the pay scale. Learned counsel\n\nfor the State Bank of Travancore further contended that\n\nthere was amendment also made in the 1979 Regulations\n\nincorporating the terms of settlement. However, even if\n\nit is assumed that no amendments were carried out\n\nwithin the time, that shall not make any difference\n\nregarding the claim of petitioners for revised gratuity.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 12 :-\n\nLearned counsel for the State Bank of Travancore relied\n\non the judgment of the Apex Court in\nState Government\n\nPensioners' Association and Others v. State of Andhra\n\nPradesh\n([1986] 3 SCC 501), State of Punjab v. Amar Nath\n\nGoyal ([2005] 6 SCC 754), State of A.P. v. A.P.\n\nPensioners' Association ([2005] 13 SCC 161) and Sudhir\n\nKumar Consul v. Allahabad Bank ([2011] 3 SCC 486) and\n\nthe Division Bench judgment of this Court in State Bank\n\nof Travancore and Others v. P.Gopinathan Nair and Others\n\n(W.A.No.2185 of 2009 decided on 10th June, 2011).\n\n9. Learned counsel for the Canara Bank has adopted\n\nthe submissions made by the learned counsel for the\n\nState Bank of Travancore. It is further submitted by the\n\nlearned counsel for the Canara Bank that in so far as\n\nthe Canara Bank is concerned, Regulation 1979 was\n\namended incorporating different recommendations made\n\nin the settlement. Statutory provisions having been\n\namended petitioners had no claim regarding revision of\n\ngratuity. It is further submitted that fixation of\n\ndate for extending the benefit of revision of pay scale\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 13 :-\n\nand benefit of revision of gratuity are neither\n\narbitrary nor discriminatory. Petitioners' challenge to\n\nthe Regulation 46 providing for different dates for\n\nimplementation of benefit of pay scale and gratuity are\n\nto be rejected on the same ground.\n\n10. We have considered the submissions made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the parties and perused the records.\n\n11. The two Division Bench judgments, i.e.,\n\nSyndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (2005 KHC 1841) and\n\nState Bank of Travancore and Others v. P.Gopinathan Nair\n\nand Others (W.A.No.2185 of 2009 decided on 10th June,\n\n2011) were although cases which were on the same issue,\n\ni.e., claim for benefit of revised gratuity on the\n\nground of enforcement of pay revision with effect from\n\n01.07.1993, the Division Bench in Syndicate Bank v.\n\nCeline Thomas (supra) has held that non-payment of\n\ngratuity is arbitrary and discriminatory and the\n\nclassification between two classes of retirees, i.e.,\n\none those who retired between 01.07.1993 and 31.10.1994\n\nand the other those who retired on or after 01.11.1994\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 14 :-\n\nin so far as payment of gratuity is concerned is\n\narbitrary and violative of\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. To the contrary, the subsequent\n\nDivision Bench in State Bank of Travancore and Others\n\nv. P.Gopinathan Nair and Others (W.A.No.2185 of 2009\n\ndecided on 10th June, 2011) has upheld the non-payment of\n\nrevised gratuity to those who retired between 01.07.1993\n\nand 31.10.1994 and held that there is no occasion for\n\nholding the cut off dates as arbitrary or\n\ndiscriminatory. Thus the issue before us is as to\n\nwhich of the above two Division Bench decisions lays\n\ndown the correct law since the the issue before the\n\naforesaid Division Bench and these Original Petitions is\n\none and the same.\n\n12. Before proceeding further, it is useful to\n\nrefer the aforesaid two Division Bench judgments in some\n\ndetail.\n\n13. In Syndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (supra) the\n\npetitioners retired during the period between 01.07.1993\n\nand 31.10.1994. Payment of gratuity was regulated by the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 15 :-\n\nStatutory Regulations applicable to the Syndicate Bank.\n\nClause 46 of the Regulations provided for payment of\n\ngratuity. Apart from the Syndicate Bank, cases of\n\nemployees from the Central Bank were also before the\n\nCourt. In the Statutory Regulations of the Syndicate\n\nBank amendments were made in the Regulations as noted in\n\nparagraph 5 of the judgment which is quoted as follows:\n\n\"5. The said statutory regulations provide, Payment\n\nof Gratuity, in Clause.46 as follows:\n\nGratuity:\n\n46.1) Every Officer shall be eligible for gratuity on:\n\na) Retirement,\n\nb) Death,\n\nc) Disablement rendering him unfit for further service as\n\ncertified by a Medical Officer approved by the Bank,\n\nd) Resignation after completing ten years of continuous\n\nservice, or\n\ne) Termination of service in any other way except by way\n\nof punishment after completion of 10 years of service.\n\n2) The amount of gratuity payable to an Officer shall be\n\none month's pay for every completed year of service,\n\nsubject to a maximum of 15 months' pay.\n\nProvided that where an officer has completed more than 30\n\nyears of service, he shall be eligible by way of gratuity for\n\nan additional amount at the rate of one half of a month's\n\npay for each completed year of service beyond 30 years.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 16 :-\n\nProvided further that pay for the purpose of Gratuity for an\n\nOfficer who ceased to be in service during the period 1-7-\n\n1993 to 31-10-1994 shall be with regard to scale of pay as\n\nspecified in Sub-Regulation (1) of Regulation.4.\"\n\n5. When we come to the case of Central Bank of India, the\n\nonly difference is that the last proviso is absent. Payment\n\nof Gratuity in terms of this provision is a statutory benefit.\n\nThat cannot be disputed. A person becomes eligible for\n\ngratuity; (a) on retirement, b) on death, (c) on\n\ndisablement, (d) on resignation and (e) on termination of\n\nservice and the amount payable \"shall be one month's pay\n\nfor every completed year of service, subject to a\n\nmaximum of 15 months' pay.\" There is further provision\n\nwith regard to payment of gratuity in respect of those who\n\ncompleted service of more than 30 years.\"\n\nWith regard to the Central Bank the proviso as was added\n\nin Regulation 46 of the Regulations was absent. The\n\nissue before the Court was noted in paragraph 6 which is\n\nto the following effect:\n\n\"6. Therefore, gratuity shall have to be\n\ncomputed on the basis of monthly pay eligible for an\n\nemployee. Whether that is the pay as on the date of\n\nretirement actually drawn by him or the pay to which\n\nhe becomes entitled, in case a revision takes place\n\nwith retrospective effect is the point to be considered.\n\nIt is contended based on a clause contained in the\n\nMemorandum of Understanding dated 23.6.1995 that\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 17 :-\n\nin respect of those who retired from service between\n\n1.11.1992 and 30.10.1994, gratuity paid would not\n\nbe revisable, on account of pay revision ordered with\n\nretrospective effect from 1.11.1992, with\n\ncorresponding monetary benefit on 1.7.1993.\"\n\nThe Division Bench had taken the view that the\n\nMemorandum of Understanding cannot meddle with the\n\nstatutory prescriptions. The following was laid down in\n\nparagraph 7:\n\n\"7. Memorandum of Understanding cannot meddle\n\nwith the statutory prescriptions. Nobody can agree by way\n\nof a settlement at the behest of an organisation taking\n\naway the benefit conferred on individuals by way of\n\nstatutes or statutory rules. There need not have any\n\nauthority to substantiate this. Statutory prescriptions\n\ncrystallize the rights in favour of the subjects of that\n\nstatute. It cannot be varied to their disadvantage unless\n\notherwise by amendment to the statute. Of course, in the\n\ncase of regulation governing the employees of the\n\nSyndicate Bank, the regulation has been amended as\n\nprovided in the last proviso to Clause.46 quoted above.\n\nBut, that amendment had been incorporated far later than\n\nthe date of retirement of the petitioners in O. P. No. 3502\n\nof 2002 and no provision in the parent statute enabling\n\nretrospective amendment is brought to our notice.\n\nTherefore, such amendment can have only prospective\n\neffect affecting those who retried later than such\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 18 :-\n\namendment. But going by the words contained in that\n\nprovision it cannot affect even such persons. So, that\n\namendment will not adversely affect any of the statutory\n\nbenefit entitled to the petitioners in O. P. No. 3502 of\n\n2000.\"\n\nThe Division Bench accepted the arguments of the\n\npetitioners that the classification between those who\n\nretired between 01.07.1993 and 31.10.1994 and those who\n\nretired on or after 01.11.1994 is arbitrary. The\n\nfollowing was observed in paragraphs 10 and 13:\n\n\"10. On the other hand, it is submitted by the writ\n\npetitioners that going by the statutory regulations, the\n\ngratuity has to be quantified based on the pay. Pay means\n\npay entitled as on the date of retirement. When a\n\nsubsequent pay revision with retrospective effect has come\n\ninto effect and payment has been accorded in terms of\n\nsuch retrospective pay revision, the pay to be reckoned for\n\nthe purpose of quantifying gratuity shall be such revised\n\npay which has been actually paid to them by the employer.\n\nIt is further submitted that even on the date of retirement\n\npay revision was on the anvil by reason of the discussion\n\nwith the association. Any delay in arriving at an\n\nunderstanding cannot on any account transgress into the\n\nstatutory entitlement for gratuity. Therefore, whatever\n\nclauses contained in the Memorandum of Understanding for\n\nrevision of pay to restrict the quantum of gratuity only to\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 19 :-\n\nthose retired on or before 1.11.1994 cannot have any\n\nbinding effect. It is further contended that even though the\n\nMemorandum of Understanding was arrived at on\n\n23.6.1995, in respect of those bank employees retired\n\nbetween 1.11.1994 and 23.6.1995, the revised gratuity is\n\npaid. So in such circumstances, those who retired between\n\n1.11.1992 and 31.10.1994 should not have been excluded\n\nfrom this benefit. This amounts to mini classification of\n\nhomogenous class violating the rights enshrined under\n\nArt.14\nof the Constitution. So, the learned single Judge was\n\nperfectly justified in directing payment of gratuity based\n\non revised scale of pay.\n\n13. The mini classification, which is complained of,\n\nis a serious one. Even admittedly by the Banks concerned,\n\nthough they have entered into Memorandum of\n\nUnderstanding only on 23.6.1995, revised gratuity based\n\non the revised pay had been given to those who retired\n\nprior to 23.6.1995, but on or later than 1.11.1994. At the\n\nsame time revision of pay scales takes effect from\n\n1.11.1992. In such circumstances, denial of the very same\n\nbenefits to those who retired between 1.11.1992 to\n\n1.11.1994 amounts to mini classification offending the\n\nmandate of\nArt.14\nof the Constitution of India. No nexus is\n\npointed out for bringing any classification between those\n\nwho retired between 1.4.1992 and 31.10.1994 and those\n\nwho retired between 1.11.1994 and 23.6.1995. Both these\n\nartificial groups of retirees had retired from service prior to\n\nthe date of arriving at the Memorandum of Understanding,\n\nbut after the date of retrospectivity to the MoU. They\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 20 :-\n\ntherefore form themselves into one class as all of them\n\nretired later than the giving effect to the pay revision by\n\nthe Memorandum of Understanding. When persons forming\n\nsame class are treated differently it violates\nArt.14\nof the\n\nConstitution denying them equal protection of law and\n\nequality before law. Denial of gratuity to the writ\n\npetitioners is therefore discriminatory. Consequently, on\n\nthat reason atone, we have to sustain the view taken by\n\nthe learned single Judge.\"\n\n14. Now coming to the judgment in State Bank of\n\nTravancore and Others v. P.Gopinathan Nair and Others\n\n(W.A.No.2185 of 2009 decided on 10th June, 2011), the\n\nrespondent retired from service on 30.06.1993. He\n\nclaimed commuted value of pension, gratuity and grant of\n\narrears pension, salary etc., on the basis of pay\n\nrevision from 01.11.1992 with 18% interest. Learned\n\nSingle Judge allowed the Writ Petition against which the\n\nBank had filed the appeal. The Division Bench has noted\n\ncertain clauses of the joint note (which evidenced the\n\nconclusions of discussion between the Indian Banks'\n\nAssociation and the various Organisations of the\n\nOfficers of Public Sector Banks). The Division Bench\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 21 :-\n\nalso noted the effective dates given in paragraph 15 of\n\nthe settlement where although pay revision was\n\nprescribed from 01.07.1993, gratuity was made admissible\n\nwith effect from 01.11.1994. The Division Bench also\n\nnoticed the earlier Division Bench judgment in\n\nSyndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (supra). But before the\n\nDivision Bench only short notes of the case were cited.\n\nThe Division Bench held that the agreement which was\n\nentered between the Indian Banks' Association and\n\nOfficers of the Banks was more or less a settlement.\n\nThe following was observed in paragraph 10, 11 and 12:\n\n\"10. The legal relationship between an employer and\n\nan employee is contractual. However under the\n\nConstitution, in the context of employment under the\n\nState, the legal relationship is described to be one of\n\n\"status\" and normally regulated by law. Even in the context\n\nof employment by private employers (non-state), terms\n\nand conditions of such employment can always be the\n\nsubject matter of legislation by a competent legislature.\n\nHowever in the absence of any specific legislation or the\n\nexistence of any other instrument, which has the force of\n\nlaw regulating the terms of employment, the terms and\n\nconditions of the employment are always the subject\n\nmatter of a contract between the employer and employee.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 22 :-\n\nIn the context of certain categories of the persons\n\nemployed in industrial establishments, having regard to the\n\nnature and scale of the employment and the need to\n\nprotect the interest of the employees who generally have\n\nan unequal bargaining power compared to the employer,\n\nthe service conditions are regulated in this country in the\n\nmanner provided under the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\nand\n\nvarious other allied enactments governing the field. Officers\n\nof the Banks such as the respondent herein do not strictly\n\nfall within the definition of \"workmen\" as defined under the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act\nor other allied enactments.\n\nNotwithstanding such legal position, the magnitude of work\n\nforce in the category of officers employed under various\n\nbanks in the country gives them a certain amount of\n\ncollective bargaining power with the employers, that is the\n\nBanks. Obviously in a bid to secure a peaceful and\n\ncongenial environment, the Banks and the Officers'\n\nAssociation thought it fit to have a settlement of the\n\nvarious conditions of service of the officers of the Banks\n\nthrough negotiations. Such negotiations fructified into\n\nExt.P4 joint note. Therefore, the rights and obligations of\n\nthe parties to the joint note emanate from the said\n\ndocument alone which in substance is akin to a settlement\n\nunder\nSection 18\nof the Industrial Disputes Act.\n\n11. In adjudicating the claim like the one raised by\n\nthe respondent herein, in our opinion, the Court is required\n\nonly to look at the document (Ext.P4 in the instant case)\n\nwhich creates the rights and obligations and reliance upon\n\nother documents like the staff circular No.36/95 in our\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 23 :-\n\nview is not legally permissible. If the rights and obligations\n\nof the parties emanate out of Ext.P4 document, the\n\ndocument is to be interpreted to ascertain the rights and\n\nobligations flowing out of the said document in the light of\n\nthe settled principles of interpretation of documents alone.\n\nOne of the settled principles of interpretation of the\n\ndocuments is that one external evidence is inadmissible\n\nwith respect to the content of a document. The principle\n\ncontained in\nSection 91\nof the Evidence Act in our opinion\n\nsquarely is applicable to the case on hand.\nSection 91\nof\n\nthe Evidence Act in so far as it is relevant reads as\n\nfollows:-\n\n91. Evidence of terms of contracts,\ngrants and other dispositions of property\nreduced to form of documents:-\n\nWhen the terms of contract, or of a\ngrant, or of any other disposition of property\nhave been reduced to the form of a\ndocument, and in all cases in which any\nmatter is required by law to be reduced to the\nform of a document, no evidence shall be\ngiven in proof of the terms of such contract,\ngrant or other disposition of property, or of\nsuch matter, except the document itself, or\nsecondary evidence of its contents in cases in\nwhich secondary evidence is admissible under\nthe provisions hereinbefore contained.\n\n12. It can be seen from the above where the terms\n\nof contract are reduced to the form of a document, no\n\nevidence in proof of the terms of such contract is\n\nadmissible. Irrespective of the fact whether Section 91 is\n\napplicable to the document such as Ext.P4, in our opinion,\n\nthe principle underlying\nSection 91\nof the Evidence Act\n\nshould govern the situation. The rights emanating from\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 24 :-\n\nExt.P4 cannot either be enlarged or curtailed by either of\n\nthe parties to the settlement evidenced by Ext.P4\n\nunilaterally. Assuming for the sake of argument that the\n\nintention of the author of staff circular No.36/95 is that the\n\narrears due to the officers of the appellant Bank are\n\nrequired to be paid with effect from November, 1992. Such\n\nan intention in our opinion cannot either bind the Bank\n\nwhich is a body corporate nor create any right in favour of\n\nthe officers of the Bank.\"\n\nThe Division Bench also observed that the judgment in\n\nSyndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (supra) was based on the\n\ndoctrine of classification whereas it overlooked the\n\nfact that such classification if any is the result of\n\na negotiated settlement of the parties but not made by\n\nany statute or statutory instrument which derives its\n\nauthority from the coercive power of the State. It\n\nfurther held that the invocation of\nArticle 14\nin the\n\ncontext of the negotiated settlement in question was\n\nuncalled for. The following was observed in paragraph\n\n15:\n\n\"15. The subject matter for discussion in the said\n\njudgment is the same joint statement which is the subject\n\nmatter of discussion in the instant judgment. The Division\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 25 :-\n\nBench applied the doctrine of classification and found the\n\nsame offensive of\nArticle 14\noverlooking the fact that such\n\nclassification if any is a result of a negotiated settlement of\n\nthe parties but not made by any statute or statutory\n\ninstrument which derives its authority from the coercive\n\npower of the State. The invocation of\nArticle 14\nin the\n\ncontext of the negotiated settlement in question in our\n\nopinion is uncalled for.\"\n\n15. Facts leading to pay revision and revision of\n\nother benefits with regard to Officers of the Public\n\nSector Banks now needs to be noted to appreciate the\n\nissues. For salary revision for Officers, the IBA High\n\nPower committee held discussion with Officers\n\nOrganizations. A joint note dated 23.06.1995 was\n\nprepared and signed by the IBA High Power Committee as\n\nwell as different Officers Organizations. Annexure-I of\n\nthe joint note contained the outcome of the discussions\n\nand recommendations. The joint note further stated that\n\nrecommendation be made to Public Sector Banks to\n\ninitiate the process of amendment of the Regulations to\n\ngive effect to what is stated in Annexure-I. The first\n\nthree paragraphs and the last paragraph of the joint\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 26 :-\n\nnote are as follows:\n\n\"The IBA's High power committee for discussions\n\nwith officers' Organisations held several rounds of\n\ndiscussions with the representatives of the officers'\n\norganizations on the salary revision for officers in public\n\nsector banks. During these discussions common views\n\nhave emerged between the two sides. The outcome of\n\nsuch discussions acceptable to both sides in given in the\n\nAnnexure-I.\n\nThe representatives of the officers' Organisations\n\nstate that the outcome of the discussions as given in the\n\nAnnexure-I was in full satisfaction of their demands raised\n\nduring the discussions in this regard and the existing service\n\ncondition be modified to that extent. The residual issues\n\nshall be taken up for discussions as early as possible.\n\nThe IBA agree that it shall recommend to the public\n\nsector banks to initiate the process to amend the Officers'\n\nService regulations, to give effect to what is stated in the\n\nAnnexure-I. The IBA shall also recommend to the\n\nGovernment of India to approve the amendments and to\n\nissue appropriate guidelines necessary for this purpose.\n\n..........\n\nThe representatives of Officers' organizations have\n\nsuggested that pending formal amendments to the\n\nofficers Service regulations as per procedure laid down\n\nunder\nSection 19\n(!0 of the Banking companion\n\n(acquisition and Transfer of undertaking) Act, 1970/1980,\n\nthe IBA may advise the banks to disburse immediately an\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 27 :-\n\nand too amount, equivalent to the nest arrears payable\n\nfor the period November, 1992 to June, 1995 and\n\ncontinue to pay revised salary and allowances on and too\n\nbasis. The IBA has agreed to make appropriate\n\nrecommendations t the Government in this regard for its\n\nconsideration.\"\n\nAnnexure-I to the joint note contained various\n\nrecommendations. Paragraph 15 of the joint note\n\ncontained a heading \"Date of Effect\". Various benefits\n\nwere recommended to be effected from different dates.\n\nIt is useful to quote paragraph 15 of the joint note:\n\n\"15. Date of Effect\n\nFor payment of arrears, the benefits under various\n\nprovisions as above shall be effective from the dates\n\nspecified hereunder:-\n\nW.E.F.\n\n(i) House Rent Allowance on\n\nrevised basic pay 1.11.1992\n\n(ii) Scales of Pay and\n\nDearness Allowance 1.07.1993\n\n(iii) City Compensatory Allowance,\n\nProvident Fund, Advance Increment\n\nand Fixed Personal Allowance 1.11.1993\n\n(iv) Gratuity, Medical Aid,\n\nHospitalisation Expenses, Second\n\nStagnation Increment in Scale III,\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 28 :-\n\nProfessional Qualification Allowance\n\nRecovery of House/Furniture Rent 1.11.1994\n\n(v) Categorisation of Branches May, 1995\n\n(vi) Halting Allowance 1.06.1995.\"\n\n16. Service Conditions of different Public Sector\n\nBanks were regulated by various Statutory Regulations\n\nframed under different Statutes. With regard to Canara\n\nBank, Canara Bank (Officers') Service Regulations, 1979\n\nwere framed in exercise of the power conferred under\n\nSection 19(2)\nof the Banking Companies (Acquisition and\n\nTransfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970.\nRegulation 3(e)\n\ndefined \"Emoluments\" which meant the aggregate of\n\nsalary and allowances, if any.\nRegulation 4\nprovided\n\nfor Grade and Scales of pay. Regulation 46 provided for\n\ngratuity. In view of the recommendation by the IBA dated\n\n23.06.1995 as noted above, the Regulations were amended\n\nto be in tune with the recommendation by settlement\n\ndated 23.06.1995. It is useful to refer to\nRegulation\nas amended which is as follows:\n\n\"\nRegulation 4(1)\nGrades and Scales of payment\n\nOn and from 1.11.1987, the scales of pay specified\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 29 :-\n\nagainst each grade shall be under:\n\n(a) Top Executive Grade:\n\nScale VII - Rs.6400 - 150 - 7000\n\nScale VI - Rs.5950 - 150 - 6050\n\n(b) ...\n\n(c ) ...\n\n(d) .....\n\n(2) On and from 1.7.1993, the scales of pay\n\nspecified against each grade shall be as under:\n\n(a) Top Executive Grade:\n\nScale VII Rs.12650 - 300 - 13250 - 350 - 13600 -\n\n400 -14000\n\nScale VI - Rs.11450 - 300 - 12650\n\n(b) ......\n\n(c) .....\n\n(d) ....\n\nRegulation 46(2) which provided for gratuity was also\n\namended and a proviso, viz., second proviso was added\n\nwhich is to the following effect:\n\n\"46(2). The amount of gratuity payable to an\n\nOfficer shall be one month's pay for every completed year\n\nof service, subject to a maximum of 15 months' pay.\n\nProvided that where an Officer has completed more\n\nthan 30 years of service, he shall be eligible by way of\n\ngratuity for years of service, he shall be eligible by way of\n\ngratuity for an additional amount at the rate of one half of\n\na month's pay for each completed year of service beyond\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 30 :-\n\n30 years.\n\nProvided further that pay for the purposes of\n\nGratuity for an Officer who ceased to be in service during\n\nthe period 1.7.1993 to 31.10.1994 shall be with regard to\n\nscale of pay as specified in sub-regulation (1) of regulation\n\n4.\n\nNote:\n\nIf the fraction of service beyond completed years of\n\nservice is 6 months or more, gratuity will be paid prorate\n\nfor the period.\"\n\nThe second proviso provided that Officers who ceased to\n\nbe in service during the period from 01.07.1993 to\n\n31.10.1994, for the purpose of gratuity, shall be\n\nentitled to scale of pay as specified in\nRegulation 4\n\n(1)\nmeaning thereby they shall be entitled to the\n\nunrevised scale of pay. Statutory Regulation thus\n\nincorporated the provision of settlement.\n\n17. State Bank of Travancore (Officers') Service\n\nRegulations, 1979 were framed in exercise of the powers\n\nconferred under\nSection 64\nof the State Bank of India\n\nSubsidiary Banks) Act, 1959.\nRegulation 3(f)\ndefines\n\n\"Emoluments\" to mean the aggregate of salary and\n\nallowances, if any.

There is an issue between the parties as to\n\nwhether Regulation 49 was amended after joint note dated\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 32 :-\n\n23.06.1995 or not. Learned counsel for the Banks\n\nsubmitted that amendments were carried out which is\n\nrefuted by the learned counsel for the petitioners.\n\n19. There is another Regulation, viz., State Bank\n\nof Travancore (Payment of Gratuity to Employees)\n\nRegulations, 1972.\nRegulation 2(d)\ncontemplated\n\n\"gratuity fund\" which is as follows:\n\n\"2. In these Regulations, unless the context\n\notherwise requires:\n\n....\n\n(d) the Gratuity Fund means the gratuity fund\n\nas may be defined in the Gratuity Trust Deed that may be\n\nexecuted by the Bank and till such deed is executed such\n\nprovisions that the Bank may have or hereafter make,\n\nfor payment of gratuity to its employees.\"\n\nRegulations 11 and 12 deals with gratuity.\nRegulation\ndeals with the amount admissible which is as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"(13) Without prejudice to the provisions of\n\nregulations No.12, the amount of gratuity admissible to an\n\nemployee shall be:-\n\n(a) a sum equal to one month's pay for each\n\ncompleted year of service in the Bank subject to a\n\nmaximum of 15 months' pay and\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 33 :-\n\n(b) an additional sum equal to half month's pay in\n\nrespect of each completed year of service in the Bank in\n\nexcess of 30 years.\n\n(c) service rendered beyond the completed years\n\nof service shall also be reckoned for gratuity purpose if it is\n\n6 months and more but less than one year for the purpose\n\nreferred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above.\n\nProvided that if the amount of gratuity payable to an\n\nemployee in accordance with the provisions of the\n\npayment of\nGratuity Act, 1972\nor any statutory\n\nmodification thereof for the time being in force is higher\n\nthan the amount of gratuity admissible to an employee\n\ndetermined in pursuance of clauses (a), (b), and (c)\n\nhereinabove, the employee shall be entitled to be paid\n\nsuch higher amount payable to him in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of the payment of\nGratuity Act\n.\"\n\n20. As noted above, the issue to be considered in\n\nthis case is as to whether denial of benefit of gratuity\n\non the basis of revised pay scale with effect from\n\n01.07.1993 to the petitioners is arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory and violative of\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Paragraph 15 of Annexure-I to the\n\njoint note dated 23.06.1995 provided the date of effect\n\nof the extended benefit of gratuity and certain other\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 34 :-\n\nbenefits only with effect from 01.11.1994. The\n\npetitioners who retired between 01.07.1993 and\n\n31.10.1994 and were denied benefit of re-computation of\n\ngratuity have come up in the Writ Petition complaining\n\nthe action as discriminatory and arbitrary. Division\n\nBench judgment of this Court in Syndicate Bank v. Celine\n\nThomas (supra), the correctness of which is to be\n\nexamined has held the denial of gratuity based on the\n\nrevised pay scale as arbitrary and violative of\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India. The Division Bench held\n\nthat the mini classification between those who retired\n\nbetween 01.07.1993 and 31.10.1994 and those who retired\n\non or after 01.11.1994 offends\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution. In paragraph 13 of the judgment as quoted\n\nabove, reasons were given by the Division Bench.\n\nAnother reason given by the Division Bench is that the\n\nmemorandum of understanding (23.06.1995) cannot meddle\n\nwith the statutory prescriptions. The Division Bench\n\nin Syndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (supra) was\n\nconsidering the Regulation framed by the Syndicate Bank,\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 35 :-\n\nRegulation 46 of the 1979 Regulations regarding payment\n\nof gratuity. After the settlement dated 23.06.1995\n\nRegulation 46 was amended by adding second proviso in\n\nthe Regulation which has been quoted by the Division\n\nBench in paragraph 5 which has already been quoted.\n\n21. The issue of fixing a cut off date for grant\n\nof various retiral benefit and whether such fixation\n\nviolates\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution have\n\ncome up for consideration before the Apex Court in\n\nlarge number of cases. The Apex Court has considered the\n\nfacts and issues in each case and explained the\n\nprinciples to find out as to when the fixation of a cut\n\noff date or denial of a particular benefit has to be\n\ntreated as violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Cases arising out of similar\n\nfacts also came for consideration before the Apex Court.\n\nTo find out the ratio laid down in above cases, we need\n\nto refer a few judgments of the Apex Court in detail.\n\n22. The first judgment on which reliance has been\n\nplaced by the learned counsel for the petitioners is\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 36 :-\n\nD.S.Nakara and Others v. Union of India ([1983] 1 SCC\n\n305) which needs to be noted in detail. In the\n\naforesaid case, Government of India, Ministry of\n\nFinance issued Office Memorandum dated 25.05.1979\n\nwhereby the formula for computation of pension was\n\nliberalised but made it applicable to Government\n\nservants who were in service on 31.03.1979 and retired\n\nfrom service on or after that date. The formula\n\nintroduced a slab system for computation of pension.\n\nPrior to the above liberalisation, average emoluments\n\nof 36 months' service provided the measure of pension\n\nbecause the pension was related to the average 36\n\nmonths' just preceding the retirement. By the\n\nliberalaised scheme average emoluments of 10 months\n\npreceding the date of retirement has to be taken for\n\ncomputation of pension, a slab system for computation\n\nof average pension has been introduced and ceiling was\n\nraised. However, the pensioner who retired prior to the\n\nspecified date, i.e., 31.03.1979 had to earn pension on\n\nthe average emoluments of 36 months' salary just\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 37 :-\n\npreceding the date of retirement which naturally was\n\nlower and the slab system and enhanced ceiling was not\n\navailable to them. Petitioners, who had retired prior to\n\n31.03.1979 challenged the aforesaid decision of\n\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance contending\n\nviolation of\nArticle 14\nand it was contended that the\n\nretirees prior to 31.03.1979 and those who retired after\n\n31.03.1979 forms a homogeneous class and discrimination\n\nbetween them regarding computation of pension is\n\narbitrary and discriminatory. Question which was raised\n\nbefore the Apex Court was noted in paragraph 2 of the\n\njudgment which is as follows:\n\n\"2. Do pensioners entitled to receive\n\nsuperannuation or retiring pension under Central Civil\n\nService (Pension) Rules, 1972 ('1972 Rules' for short)\n\nform a class as a whole? Is the date of retirement a\n\nrelevant consideration for eligibility when a revised\n\nformula for computation of pension is ushered in and\n\nmade effective from a specified date? Would differential\n\ntreatment to pensioners related to the date of retirement\n\nquo the revised formula for computation of pension\n\nattract\nArt.14\nof the Constitution and the element of\n\ndiscrimination liable to be declared unconstitutional as\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 38 :-\n\nbeing violative of\nArt.14?\nThese and the related questions\n\ndebated in this group of petitions call for an answer in the\n\nbackdrop of a welfare State and bearing in mind that\n\npension is a socio economic justice measure providing\n\nrelief when advancing age gradually but irrevocably\n\nimpairs capacity to stand on one's own feet.\"\n\n23. In the above case, the Apex Court had stated\n\nthe entire history of payment of pension and considered\n\nthe object and purpose of pension. While elaborating\n\nthe goals and objects of pension, the following was\n\nstated in paragraph 26:\n\n26. Let us therefore examine what are the goals\n\nthat pension scheme seeks to subserve? A pension\n\nscheme consistent with available resources must provide\n\nthat the pensioner would be able to live: (i) free from\n\nwant, with decency, independence and self respect, and\n\n(ii) at a standard equivalent at the pre-retirement level.\n\nThis approach may merit the criticism that if a developing\n\ncountry like India cannot provide an employee while\n\nrendering services a living wage, how can one be assured\n\nof it in retirement? This can be aptly illustrated by a small\n\nillustration. A man with a broken arm asked his doctor\n\nwhether he will be able to play the piano after the cast is\n\nremoved. When assured that he will, the patient replied,\n\n'that is funny, I could not before'. It appears that\n\ndetermining the minimum amount required for living\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 39 :-\n\ndecently is difficult, selecting the percentage representing\n\nthe proper ratio between earnings and the retirement\n\nincome is harder. But it. is imperative to note that as self\n\nsufficiency declines the need for his attendance or\n\ninstitutional care grows. Many are literally surviving now\n\nthan the past. We owe it to them and ourselves that they\n\nlive, not merely exist. The philosophy prevailing in a given\n\nsociety at various stages of its development profoundly\n\ninfluences its social objectives. These objectives are in\n\nturn a determinant of a social policy. The law is one of the\n\nchief instruments whereby the social policies are\n\nimplemented and\n\n'pension is paid according to rules which can\nbe said to provide social security law by\nwhich it is meant those legal mechanisms\nprimarily concerned to ensure the provision\nfor the individual of a cash income adequate,\nwhen taken along with the benefits in kind,\nprovided by other social services (such as\nfree medical aid) to ensure for him a\nculturally acceptable minimum standard of\nliving when the normal means of doing so\nfailed', (sec Social Security law by Prof. Harry\nCalvert, p. 1).\"\n\n24. The Apex Court held that pension is not only\n\ncompensation for loyal service rendered in the past,\n\nbut pension also has a broader significance, in that it\n\nis a measure of socio-economic justice which inhers\n\neconomic security in the fall of life. The following\n\nwas observed in paragraph 29:\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 40 :-\n\n\"29. Summing up it can be said with confidence\n\nthat pension is not only compensation for loyal service\n\nrendered in the past, but pension also has a broader\n\nsignificance, in that it is a measure of socio economic\n\njustice which inheres economic security in the fall of life\n\nwhen physical and mental prowess is ebbing\n\ncorresponding to aging process and, therefore, one is\n\nrequired to fall back on savings, One such saving in kind\n\nis when you gave your best in the hey day of life to\n\nemployer, in days of invalidity, economic security by way\n\nof periodical payment is assured. The term has been\n\njudicially defined as a stated allowances or stipend made\n\nin consideration of past service or a surrender of rights or\n\nemolument to one retired from service. Thus the pension\n\npayable to a Government employee is earned by\n\nrendering long and efficient service and therefore can be\n\npaid to be a deferred portion of the compensation or for\n\nservice rendered. In one sentence one can say that the\n\nmost practical raison d'etre for pension is the inability to\n\nprovide for oneself due to old age. One may live and\n\navoid unemployment but not senility and penury if there\n\nis nothing to fall back upon.\"\n\n25. In the above background the Apex Court examined\n\nthe Office Memorandum dated 25.05.1979 and held that\n\nclassification between those who retired prior to\n\n31.03.1979 and those who retired after that date is\n\narbitrary and has no nexus to the object to be achieved.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 41 :-\n\nIn paragraph 42, the Apex Court held the division\n\narbitrary and unprincipled in the following words:\n\n\"42. If it appears to be undisputable, as it is does\n\nto us that the pensioners for the purpose of pension\n\nbenefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a\n\nhomogeneous class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an\n\neligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of revision, and\n\nwould such Classification be founded on some rational\n\nprinciple? The classification has to be based, as is well\n\nsettled, on some rational principle and the rational\n\nprinciple must have nexus to the objects sought to be\n\nachieved. We have set out the objects underlying the\n\npayment of pension. If the State considered it necessary\n\nto liberalise the pension scheme, we find no national\n\nprinciple behind it for granting these benefits only to those\n\nwho retired subsequent to that date simultaneously\n\ndenying the same to those who retired prior to that date.\n\nIf the liberalisation was considered necessary for\n\naugmenting social security in old age to Government\n\nservants then those who retired earlier cannot be worst\n\noff than those who retire later. Therefore, this division\n\nwhich classified pensioners into two classes is not based\n\non any rational principle and if the rational principle is the\n\none of dividing pensioners with a view to giving something\n\nmore to persons otherwise equally placed, it would be\n\ndiscriminatory. To illustrate, take two persons, one retired\n\njust a day prior and another a day just succeeding the\n\nspecified date. Both were in the same pay bracket, the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 42 :-\n\naverage emolument was the same and both had put in\n\nequal number of years of service. How does a fortuitous\n\ncircumstance of retiring a day earlier or a day later will\n\npermit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension.\n\nOne retiring a day earlier will have to be subject to ceiling\n\nof Rs. 8,100/- p. a. and average emolument to be worked\n\nout on 36 months' salary while the other will have a ceiling\n\nof Rs. 12,000/- p.a. and average emolument will be\n\ncomputed on the basis of last ten months average. The\n\nartificial division stares into face and is unrelated to any\n\nprinciple and whatever principle, if there be any, has\n\nabsolutely no nexus to the objects sought to be achieved\n\nby liberalising the pension scheme. In fact this arbitrary\n\ndivision has not only no nexus to the liberalised pension\n\nscheme but it is counter productive and runs counter to\n\nthe whole gamut of pension scheme. The equal treatment\n\nguaranteed in\nArt.14\nis wholly violated in as much as the\n\npension rules being statutory in character, since the\n\nspecified date, the rules accord differential and\n\ndiscriminatory treatment to equals in the matter of\n\ncommutation of pension. A 48 hours difference in matter\n\nof retirement would have a traumatic effect. Division is\n\nthus both arbitrary and unprincipled. Therefore, the\n\nclassification does not stand the test of\nArt.14.\"\n\n26. However, it is relevant to note that the Apex\n\nCourt held that even though persons who retired on\n\n31.03.1979 are entitled to take benefit of the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 43 :-\n\nliberalised pension scheme, they are not entitled to\n\nclaim any arrears of pension. The following was laid\n\ndown in paragraph 49:\n\n\"49. But we make it abundantly clear that arrears\n\nare not required to be made because to that extent the\n\nscheme is prospective. All pensioners whenever they\n\nretired would be covered by the liberalised pension\n\nscheme, because the scheme is a scheme for payment of\n\npension to a pensioner governed by 1972 Rules. The date\n\nof retirement is irrelevant. But the revised scheme would\n\nbe operative from the date mentioned in the scheme and\n\nwould bring under its umbrella all existing pensioners and\n\nthose who retired subsequent to that date. In case of b\n\npensioners who retired prior to the specified date, their\n\npension would be computed afresh and would be payable\n\nin future commencing from the specified date. No arrears\n\nwould be payable. And that would take care of the\n\ngrievance of retrospectivity. In our opinion, it would make\n\na marginal difference in the case of past pensioners\n\nbecause the emoluments are not revised. The last revision\n\nof emoluments was as per the recommendation of the\n\nThird Pay Commission (Reghubar Dayal Commission). If\n\nthe emoluments remain the same, the computation of\n\naverage emoluments under amended R.34 may raise the\n\naverage emoluments, the period for averaging being\n\nreduced from last 36 months to last 10 months. The slab\n\nwill provide slightly higher pension and if someone\n\nreaches the maximum the old lower ceiling will not deny\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 44 :-\n\nhim what is otherwise justly due on computation. The\n\nwords \"who were in service on 31st March, 1979 and\n\nretiring from service on or after that date\" excluding the\n\ndate for commencement of revision are words of limitation\n\nintroducing the mischief and are vulnerable as denying\n\nequality and introducing an arbitrary fortuitous\n\ncircumstance can be severed without impairing the\n\nformula. Therefore, there is absolutely no difficulty in\n\nremoving the arbitrary and discriminatory portion of the\n\nscheme and it can be easily severed.\"\n\n27. One more aspect which was examined by the\n\nConstitution Bench in the above case was the financial\n\nimplication in such matters. The Apex Court made the\n\nfollowing pertinent observations in paragraph 63:\n\n\"63. The financial implication in such matters has\n\nsome relevance... ..Therefore, we are satisfied that the\n\nincreased liability consequent upon this judgment is not\n\ntoo high to be unbearable or such as would have\n\ndetracted the Government from covering the old\n\npensioners under the scheme.\"\n\n28. The Apex Court had also noted in the said case\n\nthat there is no such fund as pension fund and the\n\npension being non-contributory, liability of the State\n\ncontinues to pay pension till life.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 45 :-\n\n29. It is relevant to note that in D.S. Nakara's\n\ncase, the Apex Court was considering the question of\n\nbenefit to be extended to the retirees of a specified\n\ndate of liberalised pension. The formula for computation\n\nof liberalised pension was held to be applicable to\n\nretirees prior to the specified date and subsequent to\n\nit. However, liberalised formula was to be applied on\n\nthe emoluments which were received by the retirees\n\nprior to the date and only benefit extended was for\n\ncomputation. In the present case we are concerned with\n\nthe entitlement of gratuity. We shall notice a little\n\nlater how it is different from computation of pension.\n\n30. Judgment of the Apex Court which has been\n\nrelied on by the learned counsel for the Bank relating\n\nto payment of gratuity needs to be noted is\nState\n\nGovernment Pensioners' Association and Others v. State\n\nof Andhra Pradesh\n([1986] 3 SCC 501). In\nthe above case\n\na large number of employees retired prior to\n\n01.04.1978. By a Government Order dated 26.03.1980, the\n\nprinciple for computation of gratuity was liberalised.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 46 :-\n\nThe issue which arose for consideration has been noted\n\nby the Apex Court in paragraph 1 of the judgment which\n\nis to the following effect:\n\n\"Does that part of the provision which provides for\n\npayment of a larger amount of gratuity with prospective\n\neffect from the specified date offend\nArt. 14\nof the\n\nConstitution of India? Whether gratuity must be paid on\n\nthe stepped up basis, to all those who have retired before\n\nthe date of the upward revision, with retrospective effect,\n\neven if the provision provides for prospective operation, in\n\norder not to offend\nArt. 14\nof the Constitution of India? A\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh says ,\n\nno'. In our opinion it rightly says so. The petitioners,\n\nerstwhile Government employees who had retired \"before\"\n\nApril 1, 1978, inter alia claimed and contended before the\n\nHigh Court that they were entitled to the benefit of the\n\nGovernment order No. 88 dated 26th March, 1980\n\nproviding that :\n\n\"(b) Retirement gratuity may be 1/3rd of pay drawn\nat the time of retirement for every 6 monthly service\nsubject to maximum of 20 months pay limited to Rs.\n\n30,000/-.\"\n\nThe said order in so far as gratuity is concerned is made\n\neffective from 1st April, 1978. Says the High Court :-\"\n\n31. The Apex Court in the aforesaid case held that\n\nthe Revised Pension Rules 1980 are not admissible to\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 47 :-\n\nthose who retired prior to 01.04.1978 because at the\n\ntime of retirement they were governed by the then\n\nexisting rules and their gratuity was calculated and\n\npaid. The following was further observed in paragraph 1:\n\n\"In our opinion, the arrears relating to gratuity benefit\n\ncomputed according to the Revised Pension Rules of 1980\n\nmay not be paid to the pensioners that retired prior to 1-4-\n\n1978 because at the time of retirement they were governed\n\nby the then existing Rules and their gratuity was calculated\n\non that basis. The same was paid. Since the revised scheme\n\nis operative from the date mentioned in the scheme, i.e. 1-4-\n\n1978, the continuing rights of the pensioners to receive\n\npension and family pension must also be revised according to\n\nthat scheme. But the same cannot be said with regard to\n\ngratuity, which was accrued and drawn. The reason why their\n\nLordships of the Supreme Court in Nakara's case, AIR 1983\n\nSC 130 refused to grant arrears to the pensioners that retired\n\nprior to the stipulated date would ipso facto apply for refusing\n\nto grant the revised gratuity, since that would amount to\n\nasking the State Government to pay arrears, relating to\n\ngratuity after revising them according to the new scheme for\n\nthose that retired prior to 1-4-1978 and that would amount\n\nto giving retrospective effect to the A.P. Revised Pension\n\nRules, 1980, which came into effect from 29-10-1979 and in\n\nthe case of Part II of those Rules from 1-4-1978. The scheme\n\nis prospective and not retrospective.\"\n\n32. The High Court in the aforesaid case dismissed\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 48 :-\n\nthe Writ Petition filed by the employees which judgment\n\nwas challenged in the Apex Court. The Apex Court\n\napproved the view of the High Court. Revision of\n\ngratuity from a specified date was upheld by the Apex\n\nCourt. It was held that such revision of gratuity by\n\na specified date cannot be in any manner violative of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. The following was held\n\nin paragraph 2:\n\n\"2. We fully concur with the view of the High\n\nCourt. The upward revision of gratuity takes effect from\n\nthe specified date (April 1, 1978) with prospective effect.\n\nThe High Court has rightly understood and correctly\n\napplied the principle propounded by this Court in Nakara's\n\ncase AIR 1983 SC 130. There is no illegality or\n\nunconstitutionality (from the platform of\nArt.14\nof the\n\nConstitution of India) involved in providing for prospective\n\noperation from the specified date. Even if that part of the\n\nNotification which provides for enforcement with effect\n\nfrom the specified date is struck down the provision can\n\nbut have prospective operation not retrospective\n\noperation. In that event (if the specified date line is\n\neffaced), it will operate only prospectively with effect from\n\nthe date of issuance of the notification since it does not\n\nretrospectively apply to all those who have already retired\n\nbefore the said date. In order to make it retrospective so\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 49 :-\n\nthat it applies to all those who retired after the\n\ncommencement of the Constitution on 26th January, 1950\n\nand before the date of issuance of the notification on 26th\n\nMarch, 1980, the Court will have to rewrite the\n\nnotification and introduce a provision to this effect saying\n\nin express terms that it shall operate retrospectively.\n\nMerely striking down (or effacing) the alleged offending\n\nportion whereby it is made effective from the specified\n\ndate will not do. And this, the Court cannot do. Besides,\n\ngiving prospective operation to such payments cannot by\n\nany stretch of imagination be condemned as offending\n\nArt. 14.\nAn illustration will make it clear. Improvements in\n\npay scales by the very nature of things can be made\n\nprospectively so as to apply to only those who are in the\n\nemployment on the date of the upward revision. Those\n\nwho were in employment say in 1950, 1960 or 1970,\n\nlived, spent, and saved, on the basis of the then\n\nprevailing cost of living structure and pay scale structure,\n\ncannot invoke\nArt. 14\nin order to claim the higher pay\n\nscale brought into force say, in 1980. If upward pay\n\nrevision cannot be made prospectively on account of\nArt.\n, perhaps no such revision would ever be made. Similar\n\nis the case with regard to gratuity which has already been\n\npaid to the petitioners on the then prevailing basis as it\n\nobtained at the time of their respective dates of\n\nretirement. The amount got crystallized on the date of\n\nretirement on the basis of the salary drawn by him on the\n\ndate of retirement. And it was already paid to them on\n\nthat footing. The transaction is completed and closed.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 50 :-\n\nThere is no scope for upward or downward revision in the\n\ncontext of upward of downward revision of the formula\n\nevolved later on in future unless the provision in this\n\nbehalf expressly so provides retrospectively (downward\n\nrevision may not be legally permissible even). ...\"\n\n33. The Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex\n\nCourt in D.S.Nakara's case (supra) was considered by\n\nanother Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in\nKrishena\n\nKumar v. Union of India\n([1990] 4 SCC 207) especially on\n\nthe ratio of\nthe said judgment\n. In the aforesaid case,\n\npetitioners were the employees who retired from Railway\n\nand were in receipt of provident fund benefits.\n\nProvident Fund Scheme was current in the Railways since\n\nlong. In the year 1957 Provident Fund Scheme was\n\nreplaced by a pension scheme. Employees who entered into\n\nRailway service on or after April 1, 1957 were\n\nautomatically covered by the scheme. Those employees who\n\nwere already in service on April 1, 1957 were given an\n\noption either to retain the Provident Fund benefits or\n\nto switch over to the pensionary benefits. The pension\n\nscheme was liberalised on several occasions. The\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 51 :-\n\nRailway had even subsequent to 1957 gave option to the\n\nprovident fund retirees to opt for the pension scheme.\n\nPetitioners have not opted for pension. Challenge in\n\nthe Writ Petition was that Railway by various\n\nNotifications, last being 08.05.1987 gave fresh option\n\nto some of the provident fund retirees while denying the\n\nbenefit to the other provident fund retirees who were\n\nidentically placed but were separated from the rest by\n\nthe arbitrary cut off date. It was contended that the\n\nspecified date in the Notification giving option having\n\nformed the basis for discrimination between the\n\nsimilarly placed provident fund retirees which was\n\narbitrary and against the objects to be achieved and is\n\nclearly violative of\nArticle 14.\n\nHeavy reliance was\n\nplaced on D.S.Nakara's case (supra) by the petitioners\n\nin\nKrishena Kumar\n's case (supra). In the context of\n\nprecedent, the Apex Court made the following\n\nobservations in paragraphs 19 and 20:\n\n\"19. The doctrine of precedent, that is being\n\nbound by a previous decision, is limited to the decision\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 52 :-\n\nitself and as to what is necessarily involved in it. It does\n\nnot mean that this Court is bound by the various reasons\n\ngiven in support of it, especially when they contain\n\n\"propositions wider than the case itself required.\" This was\n\nwhat Lord Selborne said in Caledonian Railway Co. v.\n\nWalker's Trustees (1882 (7) AC 259) and Lord Halsbury in\n\nQuinn v. Leathem, 1901 AC 495 (502). Sir Frederick\n\nPollock has also said: \"Judicial authority belongs not to the\n\nexact words used in this or that judgment, nor even to all\n\nthe reasons given, but only to the principles accepted and\n\napplied as necessary grounds of the decision.\"\n\n20. In other words, the enunciation of the reason\n\nor principle upon which a question before a Court has\n\nbeen decided is alone as a precedent. The ratio decidendi\n\nis the underlying principle, namely, the general reasons or\n\nthe general grounds upon which the decision is based on\n\nthe test or abstract from the specific peculiarities of the\n\nparticular case which gives rise to the decision. The ratio\n\ndecidendi has to be ascertained by an analysis of the facts\n\nof the case and the process of reasoning involving the\n\nmajor premise consisting of a pre existing rule of law,\n\neither statutory or judge - made, and a minor premise\n\nconsisting of the material facts of the case under\n\nimmediate consideration. If it is not clear, it is not the\n\nduty of the Court to spell it out with difficulty in order to\n\nbe bound by it. In the words of Halsbury, 4th Edn., Vol.\n\n26, para 573:\n\n\"The concrete decision alone is binding between the\nparties to it but it is the abstract ratio decidendi, as\nascertained on a consideration of the judgment in relation\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 53 :-\n\nto the subject matter of the decision, which alone has the\nforce of law and which when it is clear it is not part of a\ntribunal's duty to spell out with difficulty a ratio decidendi\nin order to be bound by it, and it is always dangerous to\ntake one or two observations out of a long judgement and\ntreat them as if they gave the ratio decidendi of the case.\nIf more reason than one are given by a tribunal for its\njudgment, all are taken as forming the ratio decidendi.\"\n\n34. Referring to D.S. Nakara's case the Apex Court\n\nheld that in D.S. Nakara's case, the court had treated\n\nthe pension retirees in a homogeneous class and the\n\nprovident fund retirees were not in mind. The Apex\n\nCourt held that in D.S. Nakaras case it was never held\n\nthat both the pension retirees and the provident fund\n\nretirees formed a honogenous class and that any further\n\nclassification among them would be violative of Article\n\n14. The Apex Court in\nKrishena Kumar\n's case (supra)\n\nheld that rights by the Government in respect of\n\nprovident fund is finally crystalised on the date of\n\nretirement whereas under the pension scheme the\n\nGovernment's obligation does not begin until the\n\nemployee retires. Rules governing provident fund are\n\nentirely different from the Rules governing pension.\n\nThe following was observed in paragraph 32:\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 54 :-\n\n\"32. In Nakara (AIR 1983 SC 130) it was never\n\nheld that both the pension retirees and the P. F. retirees\n\nformed a homogeneous class and that any further\n\nclassification among them would be violative of\nArt. 14.\n\nOn the other hand the Court clearly observed that it was\n\nnot dealing with the problem of a \"fund\". The Railway\n\nContributory Provident Fund is by definition a fund.\n\nBesides, the Government's obligation towards an\n\nemployee under C. P. F. scheme to give the matching\n\ncontribution begins as soon as his account is opened and\n\nends with his retirement when his rights qua the\n\nGovernment in respect of the Provident Fund is finally\n\ncrystallized and thereafter no statutory obligation\n\ncontinues. Whether there still remained a moral obligation\n\nis a different matter. On the other hand under the Pension\n\nScheme the Government's obligation does not begin until\n\nthe employee retires when only it begins and it continues\n\ntill the death of the employee. Thus, on the retirement of\n\nan, employee Government's legal obligation under the\n\nProvident Fund account ends while under the Pension\n\nScheme it begins. The rules governing the Provident Fund\n\nand its contribution are entirely different from the rules\n\ngoverning pension. it would not, therefore, be reasonable\n\nto argue that what is applicable to the pension retirees\n\nmust also equally be applicable to P. F. retirees. This being\n\nthe legal position the rights of each individual P. F. retiree\n\nfinally crystallised on his retirement whereafter no\n\ncontinuing obligation remained while, on the other hand,\n\nas regards pension retirees, the obligation continued till\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 55 :-\n\ntheir death. The continuing obligation of the State in\n\nrespect of pension retirees is adversely affected by fall in\n\nrupee value and rising prices which, considering the\n\ncorpus already received by the P. F. retirees they would\n\nnot be so adversely affected ipso facto. It, cannot,\n\ntherefore, be said that it was the ratio decidendi in Nakara\n\nthat the State's obligation towards its P. F. retirees must\n\nbe the same as that towards the pension retirees. An\n\nimaginary definition of obligation to include all the\n\ngovernment retirees in a class was not decided and could\n\nnot form the basis for any classification for the purpose of\n\nthis case. Nakara cannot, therefore, be an authority for\n\nthis case.\"\n\n35.\nIn another Constitution Bench judgment in\n\nIndian Ex-Services League v. Union of India\n([1991] 2\n\nSCC 104), the Apex Court had again occasion to consider\n\nthe ratio of D.S.Nakara's case. Writ Petition was filed\n\nby ex-servicemen. The liberalised pension formula was\n\nmade applicable by the Government of India, Ministry of\n\nFinance dated 05.05.1979 also to the members of the\n\nArmed Forces. Apart from other claims in some of the\n\nWrit Petitions before the Apex Court claim for payment\n\nof gratuity on the ground of liberalised pension was\n\nalso raised by the pre-April 1978 retirees. Apex Court\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 56 :-\n\nheld that the concept of gratuity is different from\n\npension and claim of gratuity can be made only on the\n\ndate of retirement on the basis of salary drawn on the\n\ndate of retirement and the said amount being already\n\npaid, transaction was completed and closed. Following\n\nwas observed in paragraph 21:\n\n\"21. One of the prayers made in these writ\n\npetitions is for grant of same Death cum Retirement\n\nGratuity to the pre-1-4-1979 retirees as to the post-1-4-\n\n1979 retirees. A similar claim was rejected by this Court in\n\nState Government Pensioners' Association v. State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n1986 (3) SCC 501 (AIR 1986 SC 1907) on\n\nthe ground that the claim for gratuity can be made only on\n\nthe date of retirement on the basis of the salary drawn on\n\nthe date of retirement and being already paid on that\n\nfooting the transaction was completed and closed. It could\n\nthen not be reopened as a result of the enhancement\n\nmade at a later date for persons retiring subsequently.\n\nThis concept of gratuity being different from pension has\n\nalso been reiterated by the Constitution Bench in\nKrishena\n\nKumar\n's case (AIR 1990 SC 1782). With respect, we are in\n\nfull agreement with this view. This claim of the petitioners\n\nalso, therefore, fails.\"\n\nThe Apex Court\nin\nthe above case\nhas quoted with\n\napproval earlier judgment of the Apex Court in State\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 57 :-\n\nGovernment Pensioners' Association v. State of A.P.\n\n(supra) which we have already noted above.\n\n36. Another judgment which is relevant to be\n\nnoticed is Union of India v. P.N. Menon ([1994] 4 SCC\n\n68). In the above case, the respondent had retired prior\n\nto 30.09.1977. Office Memorandum dated 25.05.1997 was\n\nissued by the Government of India treating portion of\n\nthe dearness allowance as pay for the purpose of\n\nretirement benefits in respect of Government servants\n\nwho retired on or after 30.09.1977. Petitioners filed\n\nWrit Petition in the High Court claiming that the said\n\nbenefit should also be extended to the all retired\n\nGovernment servants including those who retired prior to\n\n30.09.1977. Petitioners placed reliance on the judgment\n\nin D.S. Nakara's case and contended that the\n\nclassification between retirees prior to 30.09.1977 and\n\nsubsequent to 30.09.1977 is arbitrary and violative of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. The Apex Court\n\nheld in the said case that due to many constraints it\n\nis not always possible for the Government to extend the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 58 :-\n\nsame benefit to one and all irrespective of\n\nsuperannuation and a scheme implemented with cut of\n\ndate cannot be held to be violative of\nArticle 14\n,\n\nwhich is fully sustainable. In paragraph 8, the\n\nfollowing has been stated:\n\n\"8. Whenever the Government or an authority,\n\nwhich can be held to be a State within the meaning of\n\nArt.12\nof the Constitution frames a scheme for persons\n\nwho have superannuated from service, due to many\n\nconstraints, it is not always possible to extend the some\n\nbenefits to one and all, irrespective of dates of\n\nsuperannuation. As such any revised scheme in respect of\n\npost retirement benefits, if implemented with a cut off\n\ndate, which can be held to be reasonable and rational in\n\nthe light of\nArt.14\nof the constitution need not be held to\n\nbe invalid. It shall not amount to 'picking out a date from\n\nthe hat' as was said by this Court in the case of\nD. R Nim\n\nv. Union of India\n, AIR 1967 SC 1301, in connection with\n\nfixation of seniority. Whenever a revision takes place, a\n\ncut off date becomes imperative, because the benefit 'has\n\nto be allowed within the financial resources available with\n\nthe Government.\"\n\n37. Another judgment which is to be noticed is\n\nState of Punjab v. Amar Nath Goyal\n([2005] 6 SCC 754).\n\nIn\nthe above case\n, respondents were employees of the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 59 :-\n\nGovernment of Punjab who retired during 31.07.1993 to\n\n31.03.1995. A Circular was issued by the Government on\n\n13.12.1996 under which a Government employee who\n\nretired/died on or after 01.04.1995 is entitled to get\n\ngratuity on the basis of addition of a portion of the\n\ndearness allowance to the basic pay which benefit was\n\nrefused to the respondents, hence they filed the Writ\n\nPetition in the High Court. The High Court partially\n\nallowed the Writ Petition and held that those employees\n\nwho retired on or after 01.07.1993 shall be entitled to\n\nget higher amount, consequent to the merger of a\n\nportion of dearness allowance to the basic pay.\n\nJudgment of the High Court was challenged by the State\n\nof Punjab. Before the Apex Court, the argument was made\n\non the ground of violation of\nArticle 14\nin so far as\n\nthe employees who retired prior to 01.04.1995 and those\n\nwho retired thereafter.\n\nReliance was placed on the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in\nD.S. Nakara\n's case. In\n\nparagraph 22, the Apex Court had noted the contention of\n\nthe parties which is extracted below:\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 60 :-\n\n\"22. The thrust of the arguments by the learned\n\ncounsel on behalf of the employees has been on the\n\nalleged violation of\nArt.14\nof the Constitution. They\n\ncontend that the decision of the Central\n\nGovernment/State Governments to make available the\n\nincreased quantum of gratuity (with revised ceiling) only\n\nto employees, who retired or died on or after 1-4-1995, is\n\ndiscriminatory and arbitrary. They also contend that all\n\nretirees/dead persons form a homogeneous class and any\n\ndiscrimination or distinction between retirees/dead\n\npersons prior to 1-4-1995 and those who retired/died on\n\nor after 1-4-1995 had no rational basis, nor was intended\n\nto serve any purpose. Heavy reliance was placed on the\n\njudgment of this Court in D.S. Nakara v. Union of India1\n\n(\"D. S. Nakara\"). We are afraid that the refrain of D. S.\n\nNakara (1983 (1) SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145) has\n\nbeen played too often to retain its initial charm, which has\n\nbeen worn thin by subsequent dicta.\"\n\n38. The Apex Court did not accede to the argument\n\nof the petitioner that decision of the Government to\n\nlimit the benefit who retired after 01.04.1995 is\n\neither irrational or arbitrary. The Apex Court further\n\nheld that the financial and economic implications are\n\nalso relevant and germane for any policy decision. The\n\nfollowing was observed in paragraphs 26, 32 and 37:\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 61 :-\n\n\"26. It is difficult to accede to the argument on\n\nbehalf of the employees that a decision of the Central\n\nGovernment/State Governments to limit the benefits only\n\nto employees, who retire or die on or after 1-4-1995,\n\nafter calculating the financial implications thereon, was\n\neither irrational or arbitrary. Financial and economic\n\nimplications are very relevant and germane for any policy\n\ndecision touching the administration of the Government,\n\nat the Centre or at the State level.\n\n32. The importance of considering financial\n\nimplications, while providing benefits for employees, has\n\nbeen noted by this Court in numerous judgments\n\nincluding the following two cases. In State of Rajasthan v.\n\nAmrit Lal Gandhi (1997 (2) SCC 342 : 1997 SCC (L&S)\n\n512 : AIR 1997 SC 782) this Court went so as far as to\n\nnote that:\n\n\"Financial impact of making the\nRegulations retrospective can be the sole\nconsideration while fixing a cutoff date. In\nour opinion, it cannot be said that this cutoff\ndate was fixed arbitrarily or without any\nreason. The High Court was clearly in error in\nallowing the writ petitions and substituting\nthe date of 1-1-1986 for 1-1-1990.\" (Ibid\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n37. In the instant case before us, the cutoff date\n\nhas been fixed as 1-4-1995 on a very valid ground,\n\nnamely, that of financial constraints. Consequently, we\n\nreject the contention that fixing of the cutoff date was\n\narbitrary, irrational or had no rational basis or that it\n\noffends\nArt.14.\"\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 62 :-\n\n39. Thus in the above case the challenge to the cut\n\noff date for extending the benefit of merger of dearness\n\nallowance into pay which consequently increases the\n\ncomputation of gratuity with a specified date was upheld\n\nand was not held to be violative of\nArticles 14\nand\n16.\n\n40. Another judgment which needs to be noted is\n\nState of A.P. v. A.P. Pensioners' Association\n([2005] 13\n\nSCC 161). The State of Andhra Pradesh constituted a Pay\n\nRevision Commission which recommended revision of pay\n\nscale notionally from 01.07.1998 with financial benefits\n\nfrom 01.04.1999. Government Order dated 11.08.1999 was\n\nissued which provided that persons who retired between\n\n01.07.1998 and 31.03.1999 shall also be eligible for the\n\nrevised pay scales, 1999. The notional pay fixed in the\n\nrevised pay scales shall in such cases count towards\n\npensionary benefits. But no Government employee shall be\n\nentitled to any monetary benefit for any period prior to\n\n01.04.1999. Original Applications were filed before the\n\nAdministrative Tribunal by the retired employees who had\n\nretired between the period 01.07.1998 and 01.04.1999\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 63 :-\n\npraying for payment of pensionary benefits including\n\ncommutation, pension, gratuity and encashment of leave.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the applicants were not entitled\n\nto gratuity and encashment of earned leave based on\n\ntheir notional pay fixed in the revised scale of pay.\n\nBut they were held to be eligible for commutation of\n\npension. Both the State as well as the employees filed\n\nWrit Petitions before the High Court. The High Court\n\ndismissed the Writ Petition filed by the State while the\n\nWrit Petition filed by the employees were allowed. The\n\nState filed a Special Leave Petition before the Apex\n\nCourt. Similar submission which is sought to be raised\n\nin the present case was raised before the Apex Court\n\nchallenging the cut off date, 01.04.1999 for giving\n\npensionary benefits. It is useful to quote paragraph 19\n\nof the judgment which contained the relevant\n\nsubmissions:\n\n\"19. Mr. Uday Umesh Lalit, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the Respondents, on the other\n\nhand, supported the judgment of the High Court\n\ncontending that it is not a case where 1.4.1999 was fixed\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 64 :-\n\nas a cut off date for the purpose of grant of terminal\n\nbenefits in terms of the rules. The rules, it was urged,\n\nread as a whole would clearly point out that the same had\n\ncome into force with effect from 1.7.1998 wherefor a legal\n\nfiction has been created and in that view of the matter,\n\nalthough the monetary benefit was to be paid with effect\n\nfrom 1.4.1999, the entitlement to the scale of pay for all\n\npurposes including that of computation of the amount of\n\ngratuity as also commutation of pension, etc. cannot be\n\ndenied. Other GOMs Nos. 156,157, 158 and 206 issued\n\nafter GO No. 114, having not been issued under the\n\nproviso to\nArt.309\nof the Constitution of India, whereas\n\nGO NO. 114 having been so issued, the same could not\n\nwhittle down the effect of a statutory rule. In any event,\n\nthe said GOMs have been declared ultra vires by the\n\nTribunal which finding has not been set aside by the High\n\nCourt.\"\n\n41. The Apex Court held that those employees who\n\nretired between the period 01.07.1998 and 01.04.1999\n\nwould have received the actual benefit calculated in\n\nterms of the said Rule and the submission of the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents that they became entitled to\n\nget enhanced pay and gratuity from 01.07.1998 was\n\nrejected. The Apex Court made the following observations\n\nin paragraph 28:\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 65 :-\n\n\"28. Computation of retirement gratuity payable to\n\na Government servant is, therefore, required to be done\n\non the basis of the formula laid down therein. A bare\n\nperusal of the aforementioned rule clearly shows that for\n\nthe purpose of computation either 1/4th of the\n\nemolument for each completed six monthly period of\n\nservice, or 3/16th of emoluments for each completed six\n\nmonthly period of service, is to be taken into\n\nconsideration. Such emoluments necessarily were payable\n\neither immediately before the date of retirement or the\n\ndate of death. On 1.4.1999, in view of the clear\n\nexpressions contained in the aforementioned GO No. 114,\n\nthose employees who retired between the period\n\n1.7.1998 and 1.4.1999 would have received the actual\n\nbenefit calculated in terms of the said rule. The\n\nsubmission of Mr. Lalit to the effect that they became\n\nentitled to enhanced pay and, therefore, to enhanced\n\ngratuity from 1.7.1998 is not wholly correct. They became\n\nentitled thereto but only notionally for the purpose of\n\ncalculation of such recurring liability of the State which\n\nbecame payable with effect from 1.4.1999. The High\n\nCourt has heavily relied upon the purported legal fiction\n\ncreated in the said rule to the effect that the same would\n\ncome into force with effect from 1.7.1998. The legal\n\nfiction undoubtedly is to be construed in such a manner\n\nso as to enable a person, for whose benefit such legal\n\nfiction has been created, to obtain all consequences\n\nflowing therefrom.\"\n\n42. It was stated by the Apex Court that the rule\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 66 :-\n\nnot only created a legal fiction but also provided the\n\noperation of limitation thereof. It was held that the\n\nRule itself provided a limitation for operation, the\n\nconsequences flowing from the legal fiction have to be\n\nunderstood in the light of the limitations prescribed.\n\nThe following was\nlaid down in\nparagraph 30:\n\n\"30. The case at hand indeed poses a different\n\nproblem. Although like Gurupad Khandappa Magdum\n\n(supra) a notional revision of pay was to be considered as\n\nif the same took effect from 1.7.1998, but the rule went\n\nfurther and stated that actual monetary benefit thereof\n\nshall be given with effect from 1.4.1999. The rule,\n\ntherefore, not only creates a legal fiction but also provides\n\nthe limitations in operation thereof. If the effect of the\n\nlegal fiction is extended in the manner suggested by Mr.\n\nLalit, clause (4) of the rule will become otiose. In other\n\nwords, all the consequences ordinarily flowing from a rule\n\nwould be given effect to if the rule otherwise does not\n\nlimit the operation thereof. If the rule itself provides a\n\nlimitation on its operation, the consequences flowing from\n\nthe legal fiction have to be understood in the light of the\n\nlimitations prescribed. Thus, it is not possible to construe\n\nthe legal fiction as simply as suggested by Mr. Lalit.\"\n\n43. Ultimately in paragraph 41, the Apex Court held\n\nthat the intention of the State was not to grant any\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 67 :-\n\nbenefit towards payment of gratuity even in relation to\n\nthose employees who had retired in between 01.07.1998\n\nand 31.03.1999. The following was held in paragraph 41:\n\n\"41. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the\n\nintention of the State was not to grant any benefit\n\ntowards payment of gratuity even in relation to those\n\nemployees who had retired in between 1.7.1998 and\n\n31.3.1999.\"\n\n44. The above case fully supports the submission\n\nraised by the learned counsel for the Banks. In the\n\nabove case also the pay scale was revised with effect\n\nfrom 01.07.1998 but the rule contemplated that no\n\nbenefit towards gratuity between the period 1st April,\n\n1998 and 31.03.1999 shall be payable. The argument that\n\nrevision of pay scale from 01.07.1998 creates a legal\n\nfiction and it has to be deemed that those employees who\n\nreceived higher revised pay scale and that should also\n\ncount towards receiving monetary benefits by the\n\nretired employees during the relevant period was\n\nrejected on the ground that the rules itself contained\n\na limitation which has to be given effect to.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 68 :-\n\n45. Another judgment which closely resembles with\n\nthe facts of the present case is the judgment in State\n\nof Bihar v. Bihar Pensioners Samaj ([2006] 5 SCC 65).\n\nThe State of Bihar issued a Notification dated\n\n19.04.1990 regulating pension, family pension and death-\n\ncum-retirement gratuity. The effective date of\n\nnotification was fixed as 01.01.1986. However, the\n\nNotification declared that financial benefits of\n\nrevision of pay should be only with effect from March,\n\n1989 and no arrears will be paid from 01.03.1989. Apart\n\nfrom the pension, the notification also revised death-\n\ncum-retirement gratuity but again no revision of death-\n\ncum-retirement gratuity was made in respect of\n\nGovernment servants who retired/died in harness on or\n\nafter 01.01.1986 and upto 28.02.1989. The Association of\n\nthe employees filed a Writ Petition challenging the\n\nNotification. The High Court quashed the Notification\n\nand directed the Government to take a decision in\n\naccordance with law. Judgment of the High Court was\n\nchallenged in the Apex Court and the Special Leave\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 69 :-\n\nPetition was summarily rejected. On 15.12.2000 the\n\nGovernor of Bihar issued an Ordinance, namely, the Bihar\n\nState Government Employees Revision of Pension, Family\n\nPension and Death-cum-Retirement Gratuity (Validation\n\nand Enforcement) Ordinance, 2000. The said Ordinance was\n\nsubsequently replaced by the Bihar Act 3 of 2001. The\n\nsaid Act validated the revision of pension and gratuity\n\nin accordance with the Notification as mentioned above.\n\nWrit Petition was filed by the Bihar Pensioners Samaj\n\nwhich was allowed and the Validation Act was struck\n\ndown. Appeal was filed by the State of Bihar.\n\nProvisions of Section 4 of the Validation Act has been\n\nextracted in paragraph 15 of the judgment, which is to\n\nthe following effect:\n\n\"15. In our view, the contention is unsound. In\n\nany event, we need not pursue this contention any\n\nfurther, as the Division Bench of the High Court had itself\n\ntaken the view that it was perfectly open to the State\n\nGovernment to fix 1-3-1989 as the effective date of the\n\nnotifications and, in any event, the two earlier judgments\n\nof the Division Benches had merely directed the State\n\nGovernment to consider the issue in the light of the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 70 :-\n\njudgments. What is more relevant to us today is that,\n\nafter considering the effect of the two judgments, the\n\nState Legislature passed \"the Validation Act\" in which the\n\nvalidating\nS.4\nand\nread as under:\n\n\"4. Validation of revision of\npension/gratuity. -- Notwithstanding any\njudgment, decree or order of any court,\ntribunal or authority the Government\nResolutions Nos. 1853(F) and 1854(F) both\ndated 19-4-1990 would be deemed to have\nbeen enforced from 1-3-1989 and the\nbenefits of pension/family pension and\ngratuity given to the government employees\nunder the said two resolutions would be\ndeemed to have been due to the employees\nw.e.f. 1-3-1989 only and the said date would\nbe deemed always to have been the cut off\ndate for the said two resolutions.\n\n5. Overriding effect of the Act. --\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary\ncontained in any judgment, decree or order\npassed by any court, tribunal or authority\nand in any other law for the time being in\nforce the provisions of this Act shall prevail\nand have effect.\"\n\n46. The Apex Court set aside the judgment of the\n\nHigh Court and held that fixation of the cut off date\n\nfor payment of the revised benefits under the two\n\nnotifications concerned was not arbitrary and fixing of\n\na cut-off date for granting of benefits is well within\n\nthe powers of the Government. It was further held that\n\nfinancial constraints is also a valid ground for\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 71 :-\n\nintroducing a cut-off date. The following was observed\n\nin paragraphs 17 and 18:\n\n\"17. We think that the contention is well founded.\n\nThe only ground on which\nArt.14\nhas been put forward by\n\nthe learned counsel for the respondent is that the fixation\n\nof the cut off date for payment of the revised benefits\n\nunder the two notifications concerned was arbitrary and it\n\nresulted in denying arrears of payments to certain\n\nsections of the employees. This argument is no longer res\n\nIntegra. It has been held in a catena of judgments that\n\nfixing of a cut off date for granting of benefits is well\n\nwithin the powers of the Government as long as the\n\nreasons therefor are not arbitrary and are based on some\n\nrational consideration.\n\n18. A supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of\n\nthe State Government by Mukesh Nandan Prasad dated 9-\n\n9-2002 brings out in para 8 that the total amount of\n\nfinancial burden, which would arise as a result of making\n\neffective the payments from 1-1-1986 would be about\n\n2038.34 crores. In other words, the State Government\n\ndeclined to pay the arrears from 1-1-1986 on the ground\n\nof financial consideration, which, undoubtedly, is a very\n\nmaterial consideration for any administration.\nIn\nState of\n\nPunjab v. Amar Nath Goyal\n(2005 (6) SCC 754) this Court\n\nhad occasion to consider the very same issue. After\n\nreferring to a number of other authorities, it was held that\n\nfinancial constraints could be a valid ground for\n\nintroducing a cut off date while introducing a pension\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 72 :-\n\nscheme on revised basis. Thus, refusal to make payments\n\nof arrears from 1.1.1986 to 28-2-1989 on the ground of\n\nfinancial burden cannot be held to be an arbitrary ground\n\nor irrational consideration. Hence, the argument based on\n\nArt.14\nof the Constitution must fail.\"\n\n47. Now we proceed to consider the other judgments\n\nrelied on by the learned counsel for the petitioners.\n\nWe have already noticed in detail the Division Bench\n\njudgment in Syndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (2005 KHC\n\n1841).\n\n48. Next judgment relied on by the learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioners is Chairman, Railway Board v.\n\nC.R.Rangadhamaiah [1997] 6 SCC 623), a Constitution\n\nBench judgment. In the above case, challenge was made to\n\nthe Notification issued by the Railway Administration\n\nmaking amendments in Rule 2544 of Indian Railway\n\nEstablishment Code. The provision of Rule 2544 provided\n\nthat for the purpose of calculation of average\n\nemoluments actual amount of running allowance drawn by\n\na railway servant during the month limited to maximum\n\n75% has to be taken into consideration. The said rule\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 73 :-\n\nwas amended. Letter dated 17.07.1981 was issued by the\n\nRailway Board communicating the decision that for the\n\npurpose of retirement benefits 55% of the basic pay\n\nshall be taken into account and the said provision was\n\nmade applicable to 1st April, 1979. The said letter has\n\nbeen noticed in paragraph 6 of the judgment which is to\n\nthe following effect:\n\n\"6. By letter of the Railway Board dated July 17,\n\n1981 the decisions taken on the recommendations of its\n\nCommittee on Running Allowances were communicated.\n\nIn the said letter it was stated :\n\n\"3.23. Reckoning of Running Allowance as Pay. (i)\n\nFor the specified purposes for which running allowance is\n\nreckoned as Pay at present, 30% of the basic pay of the\n\nrunning staff concerned will be reckoned except as\n\nbelow :\n\n(a) for the purpose of retirement benefits, 55% of\n\nbasic pay will be taken into account. This provision will be\n\nmade applicable retrospectively from 1-4-1979 so that\n\nthose running staff who have already retired with effect\n\nfrom that date or afterwards will also have their\n\nretirement benefits recalculated and resettled.\n\n(ii) xxxx xxxx xxxx\"\n\n49. Earlier letter dated 22.03.1976 was issued by\n\nthe Railway Board where the decision regarding\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 74 :-\n\nmodification of the existing rules pertaining to\n\ntreatment of running allowance was also indicated. Writ\n\nPetitions were filed before the Delhi High Court which\n\nwere subsequently transferred to Central Administrative\n\nTribunal which were allowed and order of the Railway\n\nBoard dated 23.06.1976 was quashed. Notification dated\n\n05.12.1988 was issued by the Railway Board amending Rule\n\n2544 by which certain amendments were made which\n\namendment reduced the running allowance to the maximum\n\nof 45% and was made effective from 01.04.1979. In\n\nparagraph 8 of the judgment amendments have been\n\nextracted which are to the following effect:\n\n\"8. No steps were taken by the Railway\n\nAdministration to challenge the correctness of the said\n\njudgment of the Tribunal and it has become final. After\n\nthe said decision of the Tribunal, the impugned\n\nnotifications were issued on December 5, 1988.\n\nNotification No. G.S.R. 1143 (E) is as follows :\n\n\"G.S.R. 1143 (E) :- In exercise of the powers\n\nconferred by the proviso to\nArt.309\nof the Constitution,\n\nthe President is pleased to amend R.2544 of Indian\n\nRailway Establishment Code, Volume II (Fifth Reprint) as\n\nin the Annexure.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 75 :-\n\nThis amendment will be effective from 1-1-1973.\n\nANNEXURE\n\nR.2544\n\nSub-rule g(i) and g(ii) may be substituted by the\n\nfollowing :\n\ng(i) \"For the purpose of calculation of average\n\nemoluments :- actual amount of running allowance drawn\n\nby the Railway servant during the month limited to a\n\nmaximum of 45% of pay, in the revised scales of pay\".\n\ng(ii) \"For the purpose of gratuity and / or death\n\ncum retirement gratuity :- the monthly average of\n\nrunning allowances drawn during the 365 days of running\n\nduty immediately preceding the date of quitting service\n\nlimited to 45% of average pay drawn during the same\n\nperiod, in the revised scale of pay.\"\n\nNotification No. G.S.R. 1144 (E) is as under :\n\n\"G.S.R. 1144 (E) :- In exercise of the powers\n\nconferred by the proviso to\nArt.309\nof the Constitution,\n\nthe President is pleased to amend R.2544 of the Indian\n\nRailway Establishment Code, Volume II (Fifth reprint) as\n\nin the Annexure.\n\nThe amendment will be effective from 1-4-1979.\n\nANNEXURE\n\nR.2544\n\nSub-rule g(i) and g(ii) may be substituted by the\n\nfollowing :\n\ng(i) \"For the purpose of calculation of average\n\nemoluments :- 55% of basic average pay, in the revised\n\nscales of pay, drawn during the period;\"\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 76 :-\n\ng(ii) \"For the purpose of gratuity and / or death\n\ncum retirement gratuity :- 55% of basic average pay, in\n\nthe revised scales of pay, drawn during the period.\"\n\n50. Question which was up for consideration before\n\nthe Apex Court has been extracted in paragraph 14 which\n\nis to the following effect:\n\n\"14. The question which, therefore, needs to be\n\nexamined is whether the amendments made in R.2544 by\n\nthe impugned notifications, to the extent they have been\n\ngiven effect from January 1, 1973 and April 1, 1979, can\n\nbe treated as a valid exercise of the power to make rules\n\nunder the Proviso to\nArt.309\nof the Constitution.\"\n\n51. The Apex Court after examining the amendment\n\nheld that the rule which seeks to reverse from an\n\nanterior date a benefit which has been granted or\n\navailed as being violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India to the extent it operates\n\nretrospectively. The following was laid down in\n\nparagraphs 20, 25 and 28:\n\n\"20. It can, therefore, be said that a rule which\n\noperates in futuro so as to govern future rights of those\n\nalready in service cannot be assailed on the ground of\n\nretrospectivity as being violative of\nArt.14\nand\nof the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 77 :-\n\nConstitution, but a rule which seeks to reverse from an\n\nanterior date a benefit which has been granted or availed,\n\ne.g., promotion or pay scale, can be assailed as being\n\nviolative of\nArt.14\nand\nof the Constitution to the extent\n\nit operates retrospectively.\n\n25. In these cases we are concerned with the\n\npension payable to the employees after their retirement.\n\nThe respondents were no longer in service on the date of\n\nissuance of the impugned notifications. The amendments\n\nin the rules are not restricted in their application in futuro.\n\nThe amendments apply to employees who had already\n\nretired and were no longer in service on the date the\n\nimpugned notifications were issued.\n\n28. It has also been laid down by this Court that\n\nthe reckonable emoluments which are the basis for\n\ncomputation of pension are to be taken on the basis of\n\nemoluments payable at the time of retirement. (See :\n\nIndian Ex-services League v. Union of India\n, 1991 (1) SCR\n\n158 at p. 173 : 1991 AIR SCW 327 at p. 339).\"\n\n52. Ultimately, the Apex Court stuck down the said\n\namendments by stating the following in paragraphs 32 and 33:\n\n\"32. It is no doubt true that on December 5, 1988\n\nwhen the impugned notifications were issued, the rights\n\nguaranteed under\nArt.31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\nwere not\n\navailable since the said provisions in the Constitution\n\nstood omitted with effect from June 20, 1979 by virtue of\n\nthe Constitution (Forty fourth\nAmendment) Act, 1978\n. But\n\nthe notifications G.S.R. 1143 (E) and G.S.R. 1144 (E)\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 78 :-\n\nhave been made operative with effect from January 1,\n\n1973 and April 1, 1979 respectively on which dates the\n\nrights guaranteed under\nArt.31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\nwere\n\navailable. Both the notifications insofar as they have been\n\ngiven retrospective operation are, therefore, violative of\n\nthe rights then guaranteed under\nArt.19(1)\nand\n31(1)\nof\n\nthe Constitution.\n\n33. Apart from being violative of the rights then\n\navailable under\nArt.31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\n, the impugned\n\namendments, insofar as they have been given\n\nretrospective operation, are also violative of the rights\n\nguaranteed under\nArt.14\nand\nof the Constitution on the\n\nground that they are unreasonable and arbitrary since the\n\nsaid amendments in R.2544 have the effect of reducing\n\nthe amount of pension that had become payable to\n\nemployees who had already retired from service on the\n\ndate of issuance of the impugned notifications, as per the\n\nprovisions contained in R.2544 that were in force at the\n\ntime of their retirement.\"\n\n53. The above judgment of the Apex Court has no\n\napplication to the present case. Present is not a case\n\nof reducing any retiral benefit which was admissible to\n\nthe Writ Petitioners. Gratuity which was crystalised at\n\nthe time of retirement of petitioners was computed and\n\npaid. Present is a case where petitioners were asking\n\nenhanced payment of gratuity on the ground of pay\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 79 :-\n\nrevision. The above\ncase has no application\nwhich is\n\nclearly distinguishable.\n\n54. Next judgment which has been relied on by the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioners is LIC of India v.\n\nRetired LIC Officers Association ([2008] 3 SCC 321).\n\nQuestion up for consideration was whether the Chairman\n\nof the Life Insurance Corporation can issue instructions\n\nin terms of Regulation 51 of the Life Insurance\n\nCorporation of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960 with\n\nregard to gratuity. The LIC effected revision of scales\n\nof pay for the period from 01.08.1992 to 01.07.1994.\n\nDifferent cut off dates were fixed for grant of\n\ndifferent nature of allowances as also the pay. The\n\nChairman of the LIC in purported exercise of his power\n\nunder Regulation 51 issued an order fixing 01.04.1993 as\n\nthe cut off date for revision of pay and 01.08.1994 as\n\nthe cut off date for the purpose of payment of gratuity\n\non the basis of revised pay. However, so far as those\n\nemployees who had retired prior to 01.08.1994 are\n\nconcerned, they were directed to be entitled to reduced\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 80 :-\n\ngratuity based on unrevised scale of pay with effect\n\nfrom 01.04.1993 and arrears of pay were directed to be\n\npaid only with effect from 01.08.1994. The High Court\n\nupheld the validity of the instructions issued by the\n\nChairman. Claim of the respondent were allowed in part\n\nby the learned Single Judge. The judgment of the\n\nlearned Single Judge was extracted in paragraph 6 which\n\nis to the following effect:\n\n\"6. The claim of Respondent No. 1 was allowed\n\nin part by a learned Single Judge of the High Court by his\n\norder dated 8th July, 2003 holding:\n\n\"A reading of Ext. P3 (instructions\nissued by the Chairman for supplementary of\nRevisionist in respect of class I officers and\nclaimed IV will definitely go to show that it\ncannot operate as far as the claims for\ngratuity is concerned. It is admitted that at\nleast certain officers, represented by the\npetitioner Association were deemed as\nhaving revised salary from April, 1993\nonwards. In that view, at the time of\nretirement, they were deemed as getting a\nsalary which alone could have been taken\nnotice of for computing gratuity, if Regulation\nNo. 77 has any application. It is definite that\nthe restriction in Ext. P3 and benevolence in\nRegulation No. 77 could not have coexisted\nbecause the Corporation is offering gratuity\nat the rate less than the amount an\nemployee had notionally drawn at the time of\ntheir respective retirement. It is also\npertinent to note that when powers were\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 81 :-\n\nconferred on the Chairman under Regulation\nNo. 51(2), specific reference was there about\nthe incidents of DA and other allowances.\nThere is no reference to any alteration\npermissible in respect of gratuity. It leads to\nthe position that the regulation did not permit\nthe Chairman to disturb criterian for gratuity\npayment by exercise of powers under\nRegulation No. 51(2).\"\n\nIt was further held:\n\n\"There was no power on the part of the Bank\nManagement in that case to disturb the\nsettlement, and the gratuity was to be paid\non the basis of last drawn pay. Likewise, in\nthe present case, it would not have been\npermissible for the Chairman to unsettle the\nbenefits that had been spoken to by\nRegulation No. 77 while issuing Ext. P3\norder.\"\n\n55. Decision of the learned Single Judge was\n\naffirmed by the Division Bench. The LIC filed an\n\nappeal challenging the said judgment. In paragraph 10\n\nof the judgment Regulation 51 was extracted which is to\n\nthe following effect:\n\n\"10. Appellant Corporation in exercise of its\n\npowers conferred upon it by clauses (b) and (bb) of sub-\n\nsection (2) of\nS.49\nof the Life Insurance Corporation Act,\n\n1956, with the previous approval of the Central\n\nGovernment, made Regulations known as \"Life Insurance\n\nCorporation of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960 (in short\n\n'the Regulations'). Chapter IV of the said Regulations deal\n\nwith \"Pay and Allowances\". Regulation 51 thereof reads as\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 82 :-\n\nunder:\n\n51. \"Scales of Pay:(1) The scales of\npay, dearness allowance and other\nallowances (wherever payable) applicable to\nthe employees of the Corporation in India\nshall be as prescribed in Schedule II hereto.\n\n(1A) The basic pay and other allowance\nadmissible from time to time to an employee\nbelonging to Class II shall be regulated in\naccordance with the provisions contained in\nSchedule III.\n\n(2) Whereas the scales of pay, dearness\nallowance or other allowances applicable to\nthe employees of the Corporation or any\nclass of them are revised in pursuance of any\naward, agreement or settlement, or\notherwise, the method of fixation of pay in\nthe new scales, the eligibility for the benefit\nof revision, the date from which the revision\nshall apply, and other matters connected\ntherewith or incidental thereto shall be\nregulated by instructions issued by the\nChairman in this behalf.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\"\n\n56. Question before the Apex Court was whether the\n\npower conferred on the Chairman can be exercised with\n\nregard to the payment of gratuity which is otherwise\n\ncovered by the Regulation 77. In paragraphs 12, 18 and\n\n19, the following has been stated:\n\n\"12. Regulation 51 indisputably confers power\n\nupon the Chairman to fix a date from which the revision in\n\npay shall apply. It applies to pay, dearness allowance and\n\nother allowances applicable to the employees of the\n\nCorporation. The question, as would appear from the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 83 :-\n\ndiscussions made hereinafter, is as to whether the\n\nexpression \"the date from which the revisions shall apply,\n\nand other matters connected therewith or incidental\n\nthereto\", would also include the matter relating to\n\npayment of gratuity which is otherwise covered by\n\nRegulation 77 thereof.\n\n18. It may be true, as was contended by Mr.\n\nPatwalia, that the cut off dates were fixed upon holding\n\nnegotiations with the Unions. However, the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Chairman to fix a cut off date is in question in terms of\n\nsub regulation (2) of Regulation 51. Instructions have\n\nbeen issued under the said provision alone. Instructions\n\nnot only cover the scales of pay from a particular date but\n\ndifferent dates have been fixed for different types of\n\nallowances. We have noticed hereinbefore that whereas\n\ndearness allowance and some other allowances, as for\n\ninstance 'house rent allowance' and 'city compensatory\n\nallowance' are envisaged by IInd Schedule appended to\n\nthe said Regulations, the other allowances, and for\n\ninstance, the 'Provident Fund' and 'Gratuity' have nothing\n\nto do therewith. Provident Fund and Gratuity are ordinarily\n\ngoverned by the Acts enacted by the Parliament, subject\n\nto the conditions contained therein.\n\n19. Regulation 77 of the Regulations, specifies\n\nthe employees who would be entitled to payment of\n\ngratuity. Clause (2) of Regulation 77 provides for the\n\nmanner in which the amount of gratuity shall be payable.\n\nNeither the payment of Provident Fund nor the payment of\n\nGratuity is thus covered by the provisions contained in\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 84 :-\n\nChapter IV of the Regulations.\"\n\n57. In paragraph 26, the following has been stated:\n\n\"26. The Chairman of the Corporation has himself\n\ngiven a retrospective effect to revision in scales of pay.\n\nSuch a retrospective effect has also been given so as to\n\nbenefit a class of employees. The employees, irrespective\n\nof the fact whether they had superannuated or not, were\n\ngiven the benefit of arrears of pay from 1st August, 1993.\n\nBy reason of grant of such benefit both to serving\n\nemployees as also the superannuated employees, both\n\nthe class of employees became entitled thereto as of\n\nright. If by reason thereof, even a retired employee, as\n\non the date of retirement, became entitled to the benefit\n\nof the revised scale of pay, the same for all intent and\n\npurpose must be taken to be the permanent basic pay,\n\napart from other allowances, if any, which are required to\n\nbe taken into consideration for the purpose of\n\ncomputation of the amount of gratuity.\n\n58. The observations made in paragraph 26 does\n\nappear to hold that when the benefit of arrears of pay\n\nwas given from 01.08.1993, those employees who retired\n\nbecame entitled to the benefit of revised scales of pay.\n\nHowever, there are two reasons due to which the above\n\ncase has to be held as distinguishable from the facts\n\nof the present case. The reasons are: (i) in the above\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 85 :-\n\ncase it was held that Chairman of the LIC could not have\n\nexercised any power under Regulation 51(2) with regard\n\nto gratuity which was payable according to computation\n\nunder Regulation 77 and it is clear from the facts of\n\nthe case that revision of scales of pay was made during\n\nthe period from 01.04.1993 and the Chairman has issued\n\ndirection fixing different cut off dates for different\n\nnature of allowances. The Apex Court had noticed the\n\nquestion which was to be answered in paragraph 1 which\n\nis to the following effect:\n\n\"1. Jurisdiction of the Chairman of the Life\n\nInsurance Corporation of India (Corporation) to issue\n\ninstructions in terms of Regulation 51 of the Life\n\nInsurance Corporation of India Class I Officers (Revision\n\nof Terms and Conditions of Service) Instructions, 1996 is\n\nin question in this appeal which arises out of a judgment\n\nand order dated 29th September, 1995 passed by a\n\nDivision Bench of the Kerala High Court in Writ Appeal\n\nNo.32 of 2004.\"\n\n59. Paragraphs 18 and 19 as extracted above made\n\nit clear that the Chairman has no power to issue any\n\norder under Regulation 51 regulating the gratuity. It\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 86 :-\n\nwas held by the Apex Court that the power of sub\n\ndelegatee is more restricted and a delegatee cannot act\n\nin violation of the statute. Further a sub-delegatee\n\ncannot exercise any power which is not meant to be\n\nconferred upon him by reason of statutory provisions.\n\nIn paragraph 28, the following was stated:\n\n\"28. Contention of Mr. Patwalia that the\n\nChairman of the Corporation having power even to\n\nfix the cut off dates for different purposes, the\n\njurisdiction exercised by him to do so for payment\n\nof gratuity, which has a direct nexus with the\n\nrevised pay of scale cannot be accepted. Once he\n\nfixes a cut off date for the purpose of giving effect\n\nto the agreement vis a vis the payment of arrears\n\nin terms thereof, he cannot exercise further\n\njurisdiction in respect of a matter which is not\n\ncontrolled by Chapter IV but is controlled by other\n\nprovisions of statutes and Parliament Acts\n\ngoverning the field. A delegatee must exercise its\n\npowers within the four corners of the statute. The\n\npower of a sub delegatee is more restricted. A\n\ndelegatee cannot act in violation of a statute. A sub\n\ndelegatee cannot exercise any power which is not\n\nmeant to be conferred upon him by reason of\n\nstatutory provisions. It must conform not only to\n\nthe provisions of the Regulations and the Act but\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 87 :-\n\nalso other Parliamentary Acts. (See - Kurmanchal\n\nInst. of Degree and Diploma and Others v.\n\nChancellor, M.J.P. Rohilkhand Univ. and Others,\n\n2007 KHC 3640 : 2007 (6) SCC 35 : AIR 2007 SC\n\n2253, Kerala Samsthana Chethu Thozhilali Union v.\n\nState of Kerala and Others, 2006 KHC 536 : 2006\n\n(4) SCC 327 : 2006 (2) KLT 270 : ILR 2006 (3)\n\nKer. 65 : JT 2006 (5) SC 41 : 2006 (3) LLN 124 :\n\n2006 (2) CLR 15 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 796, Bombay\n\nDyeing and Mfg.

Municipal Corporation of\n\nGreater Bombay and Another\n, 1989 Supp (1) SCC\n\n347 : 1989 (72) STC 150 : 1989 (21) ECC 24).\n\n60. Thus\nthe above case\nprincipally turns on the\n\nfinding that the Chairman could not have issued any\n\nexecutive instruction in exercise of the powers under\n\nRegulation 51 for fixing the cut off date for payment of\n\ngratuity. Hence benefit of payment of gratuity from the\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 88 :-\n\ndate of revision of pay scale was extended. In the\n\npresent case there is no such issue that the pay\n\nrevision and various dates for extending benefits were\n\nbeyond the power of settlement which was entered into\n\nbetween IBA and Officers of the Public Sector Banks. In\n\nthe present case revision of pay scale as well as fixing\n\ncut off date for extending benefit of gratuity has been\n\ndone by the orders issued by the banks and there is no\n\nchallenge to the settlement. The question as to whether\n\nthe joint note dated 23.06.1995 violates any statutory\n\nprovision shall also be considered hereinafter\n\nseparately. (ii) Chairman was held to be sub-delegatee\n\nin the subordinate legislation, i.e. LIC Regulation,\n\n1960 and that he could not exercise the power beyond his\n\ndelegation.\n\n61. In view of the aforesaid facts, the above\n\njudgment is distinguishable.\n\n62. From the above discussion, it is clear that\n\nfixation of cut off date for extending benefit of\n\ngratuity from a different date as compared to revision\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 89 :-\n\nof pay scale can neither be said to be arbitrary,\n\ndiscriminatory nor violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof\n\nthe Constitution. Fixation of such cut off date have\n\nalready been upheld by the Apex Court in\nState Govt.\n\nPensioners' Association v. State of A.P.\n,\nState of A.p.\n\nV. A.P. Pensioners' Association\nand State of Bihar v.\n\nBhiar Pensioners Samaj (supra). Thus, we do not find\n\nany illegality on the ground of fixation of cut off date\n\nas 01.11.1994 for extending the benefit of gratuity in\n\nthe present case.\nThus, the view of the Division Bench\n\nin Syndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (supra) holding cut\n\noff as arbitrary cannot be approved.\n\n63. Petitioners in O.P. No.20427 of 1997 has also\n\nchallenged the second proviso to Regulation 46(2) which\n\nproviso was added in Regulation 46(2) after joint note\n\ndated 23.06.1995 and was in accordance with the said\n\nsettlement. The proviso held that those Officers who\n\nceased to be in service during the period 01.07.1993 to\n\n31.10.1994 shall receive gratuity with regard to scale\n\nof pay as applicable at the time of their retirement and\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 90 :-\n\nshall not get the benefit of revised pay scale. We\n\nhaving already found the classification valid and the\n\nrespondents having power to fix a cut off date for\n\nextending benefit of gratuity, challenge to the second\n\nproviso to Regulation 46(2) of the Canara Bank\n\nRegulations, 1979 also fails.\n\n64. One more submission which is raised by the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioners is that Regulation\n\n1979 of the State Bank of Travancore has not been\n\namended in accordance with the joint note dated\n\n23.06.1995. The said submission has been refuted by the\n\nlearned counsel for the Bank and he submitted that\n\namendment were also carried out in the Regulation in\n\npursuance of the joint note. But the amendment having\n\nnot been produced before us, we proceed to examine the\n\nsaid submission on the premise that amendments have not\n\nbeen carried out. Further, whether the joint note dated\n\n23.06.1995 violates any statutory provisions of 1979\n\nRegulation is another issue to be answered.\n\n65. Regulation 46(2) of the 1979 Regulation\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 91 :-\n\nprovides for computation of gratuity. There is no\n\ndispute in the present case that according to\n\nRegulation 46 as existing at the time of retirement, the\n\ngratuity was paid to them. The Constitution Bench of the\n\nApex Court in\nIndian Ex-Services League v. Union of\n\nIndia\n(supra) had laid down that claim for gratuity can\n\nbe made only on the date of retirement on basis of the\n\nsalary drawn on the date of retirement and after\n\nreceiving the payment of gratuity on that footing the\n\ntransaction was treated as complete and closed\n\n(paragraph 21 of the judgment). Joint note and\n\nsettlement dated 23.06.1995 revised the pay scale and\n\ngave benefits of gratuity to those employees who retired\n\non or after 01.11.1994. The benefit of pay revision\n\nwhich have been extended to the petitioners by a\n\nsubsequent settlement between the Management and\n\nOfficers Organisations which gives some benefits to them\n\ncannot be said to violate any provisions of statutory\n\nregulation. Similarly, giving any particular benefit\n\nwith effect from 01.11.194, i.e., financial benefit of\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 92 :-\n\ngratuity cannot be said to violate any provisions of\n\nstatutory regulation when the right of petitioners to\n\nreceive gratuity was crystalised on the date of\n\nretirement and they had already received gratuity. We\n\nthus are of the view that giving various benefits with\n\ndifferent dates to the petitioners under the settlement\n\ndated 23.06.1995 cannot be said to be violative of any\n\nprovisions of the 1979 Regulation. Thus, the above\n\nargument has to be rejected.\n\n66. There is one more reason due to which the\n\nchallenge by the petitioners cannot be accepted. From\n\nthe facts brought on record it is clear that benefits\n\nof pay revision and extension of other benefits were\n\nextended on the basis of the joint note and settlement\n\ndated 23.06.1995 after series of discussion with IBAs\n\nand Officers of the Public Sector Banks and all having\n\nagreed for the said benefits and the manner of extension\n\nof such benefits, recommendation was made which was\n\naccepted by the Management and orders were issued\n\nthereunder. Although the joint note and settlement dated\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 93 :-\n\n23.06.1995 cannot be said to be a \"settlement\" within\n\nthe meaning of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n, the\n\nprinciples laid down with regard to the ground for\n\nchallenge of a \"settlement\" can also be applied to the\n\nsettlement entered between the IBA and Officers of the\n\nPublic Sector Banks. The Apex Court in\nHerbertsons\n\nLimited v. The Workmen of Herbertsons Limited and Others\n\n([1976] 4 SCC 736) had occasion to consider the nature\n\nof settlement entered into between the workmen and\n\nManagement under the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n.\n\nThe Apex Court held that settlement has to be taken as a\n\npackage deal and when labour has gained in the matter of\n\nwages and if there is some reduction in the matter of\n\ndearness allowance so far as the award is concerned, it\n\ncannot be said that the settlement as a whole is unfair\n\nand unjust. The following observations were made in\n\nparagraph 21:\n\n\"21. ...... When, therefore, a negotiations\n\ntake place which have to be encouraged,\n\nparticularly between labour and employer in the\n\ninterest of general peace and well being there is\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 94 :-\n\nalways give and take. Having regard to the nature\n\nof dispute, which was raised as back as 1968, the\n\nvery fact of the existence of a litigation with regard\n\nto the same matter which was bound to take some\n\ntime must have influenced both the parties to come\n\nto some settlement. The settlement has to be taken\n\nas a package deal and when labour has gained in\n\nthe matter of wages and if there is some reduction\n\nin the matter of dearness allowance so far as the\n\naward is concerned, it cannot be said that the\n\nsettlement as a whole is unfair and unjust.\"\n\n67. Further the Apex Court held that the\n\nsettlement cannot be judged on the touchstone of the\n\nprinciples which are\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court for\n\nadjudication. The following was stated in paragraph 24:\n\n\"24....The settlement, therefore, cannot be\n\njudged on the touchstone of the principles which\n\nare\nlaid down by\nthis Court for adjudication.\n\n68. Lastly, the Apex Court held that the settlement\n\ncannot be in bits and pieces and the settlement has to\n\nbe accepted or rejected as a whole. The following was\n\nobserved in paragraph 27:\n\n\"27. It is not possible to scan the settlement\n\nin bits and pieces and hold some parts good and\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 95 :-\n\nacceptable and others bad. Unless it can be\n\ndemonstrated that the objectionable portion is such\n\nthat it completely outweighs all the other\n\nadvantages gained the Court will be slow to hold a\n\nsettlement as unfair and unjust. The settlement has\n\nto be accepted or rejected as a whole and we are\n\nunable to reject it as a whole as unfair or\n\nunjust.....\"\n\n69. The Apex Court in\nReserve Bank of India v.\n\nC.N.Sahasranaman\n([1986 (supp)] SCC 143) has held that\n\nsettlement of disputes by direct negotiations or\n\nsettlement through collective bargaining is always to be\n\npreferred. The following was\nlaid down in\nparagraph 60:\n\n\"60. It is well to bear in mind the fact that\n\nsettlement of disputes by direct negotiations or\n\nsettlement through collective bargaining is always to\n\nbe preferred for it is best suited for industrial peace\n\nwhich is the aim of legislation for settlement of\n\nlabour disputes. See the observations in\nNew\n\nStandard Engineering Co. Ltd. v. N. L. Abhyankar\n,\n\nAIR 1978 SC 982 at P. 984 : 1978 (2) SCR 798.\n\nThis view has again been reiterated by this Court in\n\nTata Engineering and Locomotive v. Their Workmen\n,\n\nAIR 1981 SC 2163 : 1982 (1) SCR 929. The order of\n\nthis Court dated 2nd May, 1984 and the referendum\n\nand the result thereof have been set out\n\nhereinbefore.\"\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 96 :-\n\n70. The Division Bench judgment of this Court in\n\nState Bank of Travancore and Others v. P.Gopinathan Nair\n\nand Others (W.A.No.2185 of 2009 decided on 10th June,\n\n2011) had also taken the view that invocation of\nArticle\nin the context of negotiated settlement was uncalled\n\nfor and on the aforesaid ground it did not agree with\n\nthe earlier Division Bench judgment in Syndicate Bank\n\nv. Celine Thomas (2005 KHC 1841).\n\n71. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of\n\nthe opinion that extending the benefit of gratuity only\n\nwith effect from 01.11.1994 to the Officers of the Banks\n\ncan neither be said to be arbitrary, discriminatory nor\n\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n\n72. We thus hold that the Division Bench judgment\n\nin Syndicate Bank v. Celine Thomas (2005 KHC 1841) does\n\nnot lay down the correct law and the judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench in State Bank of Travancore and Others v.\n\nO.P Nos.3489 & 20427 of 1997\n\n-: 97 :-\n\nP.Gopinathan Nair and Others (W.A.No.2185 of 2009\n\ndecided on 10th June, 2011) lays down the correct law\n\nand is approved.\n\n73. The Reference is answered accordingly.\n\nIn the result, both the Original Petitions are\n\ndismissed.\n\nASHOK BHUSHAN,\nCHIEF JUSTICE.\n\nA.M.SHAFFIQUE,\nJUDGE.\n\nA.K. JAYASANKARAN NAMBIAR,\nJUDGE.\n\nvsv",
