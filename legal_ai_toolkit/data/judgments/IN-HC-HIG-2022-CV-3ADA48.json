JUSTICE ASHUTOSH J. SHASTRI\n\nDate : 08/06/2022\n\nORAL ORDER\n\n1. By way of present petition under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996, petitioner has prayed for the following\nreliefs:-\n\n(a) Appoint an independent Arbitrator for Resolution of dispute\narising out of License Agreement annexed at Annexure-C to\nthe Petition;\n\n(b) Any other and further relief deemed just and proper be\ngranted in the interest of justice.\n\n2. The background of facts which has given rise to present\npetition is that petitioner company is incorporated under the\nprovisions of the\nCompanies Act, 2013\nas a Private Limited company.\nThe respondent, which is a body corporate, created under the Airport\nAuthority of India, 1994 has floated tenders for food court facility in\nDomestic Terminal at S.V.P.I. Airport, Ahmedabad and in response\nthereto, petitioner's bid found to be eligible was accepted by the\nauthority. On 20.3.2018, respondent issued an award of license for\nfood court facility in Terminal-1 at S.V.P.I, Airport and executed a\n\nPage 1 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nlicense agreement on 9.4.2018. Initial period of license was fixed as\none year from 19.5.2018 to 18.5.2019 and then by virtue of\namendments, extended upto 30.6.2020 on the terms and conditions\nwhich are fixed.\n\n3. By virtue of said terms of license agreement, petitioner had to\npay monthly license fee of Rs.20,07,000/- + GST and other applicable\ntaxes and had to deposit a sum of Rs.47,36,520/-, equal to two\nmonths license fee as a security deposit in the form of Demand Draft/\nPay Order/ Bank Guarantee in favour of the respondent payable at\nAhmedabad.\n\n4. It is the case of the petitioner that pursuant to the said\nexecution of the license agreement dated 20.3.2018, on 27.3.2018,\nbank guarantee was issued of Rs.47,36,520/- and expiry date of bank\nguarantee was made upto 30.6.2020 in view of extension. Due to\ncertain layouts and orientation of outlet, the authority said to have\nrevised the layout vide email dated 19.4.2018 and respondent\nchanged the location and handed over new location to the petitioner\non 18.5.2018. According to the petitioner, there was a delay of 60\ndays in handing over the site by respondent. On account of multiple\ndifferences, as stated in the petition, opening of outlet got delayed by\na further period of more than 45 days and as such, petitioner made a\nrequest for refund of the license fee charged with respect to that\nperiod, but said request was rejected by email communication dated\n10.9.2020. Then the license agreement tenure by efflux of time got\nterminated on 30.6.2020.\n\n5. It is the case of the petitioner that after such termination by\nefflux of time, petitioner forthwith delivered the possession and since\nthere was no means of access the premises, assets and material of\nthe petitioner lying in such premises, an attempt was made to\n\nPage 2 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nexplore the possibility of extension of terms of license agreement and\nas such, petitioner did not remove its assets of more than rupees one\ncrore lying at the Airport premises at the time of handing over the\npossession and then extension in the form of email exchanged\nbetween the parties and by that time, pandemic effect of Covid-19\nprevailed. As a result of this, petitioner was unable to remove its\ngoods and other material. Even respondent on account of limited\noperational activities at the Airport due to Covid-19 pandemic and in\nview of various Government guidelines, did not consider it necessary\nto request the petitioner to remove its assets lying at the Airport.\n\n6. Surprisingly, according to the petitioner, on 18.9.2020,\nrespondent raised invoice for the month of April to June 2020 and\ndue to payments have also been prescribed, same was shared vide\nemail dated 22.9.2020 and then according to petitioner, respondent\nauthority had wrongly raised invoices for the period beyond the\nlicense period and on the contrary, petitioner is entitled to seek\nadjustment of an amount to the extent of Rs.13,54,454.84 and by\ngiving details in the petition, it has been mentioned by petitioner that\nonly an amount of Rs.1,01,895.56 remained to be paid to the\nrespondent. Payment of such amount was processed by petitioner on\n26.9.2020. But, then, in view of this conflict, an attempt was made to\nreconcile or resolve the issue. However, it appears that same has not\nattained any result and by raising the issues related to the amount\npayable by petitioner, when an attempt was made to encash the bank\nguarantee by respondent, petitioner filed Civil Misc. Application\nNo.265 of 2020 before learned City Civil Court, Ahmedabad under\n\nSection 9\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking\ninterim relief basically against encashment of bank guarantee. On\nappreciation of evidence of facts, learned City Civil Court, vide order\ndated 30.9.2020, granted an interim relief in favour of the petitioner\nand said order has been extended from time to time. According to the\n\nPage 3 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\npetitioner, respondent had been in breach of various obligations\nunder the license agreement, whereas respondent is having a stand\ncontrary and in that situation, petitioner was constrained to invoke\nclause 18 of the license agreement on 29.12.2020, so as to see that\ndifferences/ disputes to be resolved between the parties through\narbitration and for that purpose, name was also proposed of Hon'ble\nMr. Justice K.M. Thaker (retired former Judge of Gujarat High Court)\nto act as a sole Arbitrator but, then upon receipt of said notice,\naccording to petitioner, said request was not acceded to vide\ncommunication dated 16.2.2021 and in turn, respondent authority\nrequested the petitioner to give acceptance to clause 18(a), (b) and\n\n(c) and to deposit the disputed amount for constitution of the\nDispute Resolution Committee.\n\n7. It is the case of the petitioner that on 17.2.2021, an email was\nsent by the petitioner disputing the contents of the letter dated\n16.2.2021 and insisted for arbitration, has contended that it is a\nsettled position of law that clauses deterring a party from invoking\narbitration and requiring it to pre-deposit certain sums before\ninitiation of arbitration proceedings are arbitrary and\nunconstitutional and have got effect of discouraging the arbitration\nand as such, setting up of the Dispute Resolution Committee at the\nAirports is not a mandatory condition and as such, clause 18 which\nhas been tried to be pressed into service by respondent and insisting\nfor pre-deposit of disputed claimed is absolutely arbitrary and\nunconstitutional. As a result of this, for seeking an appointment of an\nindependent Arbitrator for resolution of the dispute arising out of the\nlicense agreement, present petition under\nSection 11\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is brought before the Court.\n\n8. When petition came up for consideration on initial hearing on\n5.3.2021, Coordinate Bench of this Court was pleased to issue notice\n\nPage 4 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nupon respondent and after completion of the pleadings, lastly, the\nmatter was heard by the Court upon request of both learned\nadvocates and arguments were concluded.\n\n9. Learned senior advocate Mr. Navin Pahwa appearing with\nlearned advocate Mr. Nachiket A. Dave has vehemently contended\nthat the stand of the authority is absolutely arbitrary, irrational and\nsmacks with malafides and as such, the relief prayed for deserves to\nbe granted.\n\n10. Learned senior advocate Mr. Pahwa has submitted that though\nthere was a serious dispute with regard to change of location and\nbelated handing over of possession of the site in question, petitioner\nhad to suffer a lot and by referring to the contents of the petition, has\nsubmitted that unauthorirzedly and arbitrarily, a huge amount is\nclaimed by the respondent which in no circumstance is liable to be\npaid by petitioner. According to Mr. Pahwa, the only amount which is\npayable is Rs.1,01,895.56 and nothing beyond but as against the\nhuge amount is claimed by the authority. In fact, while demanding\namount through email communication in the month of September\n2020, several amounts which were required to be adjusted as noted\ndown in para 2.15, have not at all been considered and instead, in an\narbitrary manner, insisted for recovery.\n\n11. Learned senior advocate Mr. Pahwa has submitted that in fact,\nlooking to the chronology of events, as stated in the body of the\npetition, stand of the authority of insisting for pre-deposit of the\ndisputed amount and to insist for approaching the Dispute Resolution\nCommittee is absolutely impermissible and clause contained therein\nitself is unconstitutional and arbitrary and as such, it is not open for\nrespondent authority even to refuse to refer the dispute to\narbitration independently as suggested by the petitioner. The\n\nPage 5 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nauthority has acted as a power charged authority by refusing the\nrequest for appointment of Hon'ble former Judge of Gujarat High\nCourt and has dragged on the issue which has got effect of\nfrustrating the very object for creation of arbitration forum. That\nbeing so, by discarding the stand of the authority, the relief prayed\nfor may be considered. Mr. Pahwa has vehemently contended that\nthere are series of decisions in which a view is taken on\ninterpretation of these very clauses and relying upon the same, has\nrequested the Court to appoint an independent Arbitrator to resolve\nthe grievance of the petitioner. Following are the decisions pressed\ninto service by learned senior counsel Mr. Pahwa for seeking\nappointment of an independent arbitrator:-\n\n(1) DURO FELGUERA, S.A Versus GANGAVARAM PORT\nLIMITED [2017)9 SCC 729];\n\n(2) MAYAVATI TRADING PVT.

By referring to the aforesaid decisions, learned senior counsel\nMr. Pahwa has reiterated to grant the relief as prayed for in the\npetition.\n\n13. As against this stand of the petitioner, learned advocate Ms.\nHarshal Pandya appearing on behalf of respondent Airport Authority\nhas vehemently opposed the petition by contending that with open\neyes, petitioner has filled in the tender which was accepted by the\nauthority and from that initial movement itself, petitioner was aware\nabout the terms and conditions of the agreement and also with open\neyes, executed not only the license agreement, but even on its own\n\nPage 7 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nvolition executed the extension agreement and document about\nreading the terms as well and as such now it is not open for the\npetitioner to raise any grievance which is nothing but an\nafterthought theory.\n\n14. Learned advocate Mr. Pandya has contended that one sided\nversion which has been tried to be canvassed by petitioner is far\nfrom truth. In fact, there is no unilateral change of location at any\npoint of time. On the contrary, after receipt of the award letter,\nofficials of the petitioner company visited the site on 2.4.2018 and\nsubmitted that there should be a decent gap between the food court\nand the executive lounge and the plans related to it have also been\nexchanged and then request of acceptance was materialized and as\nsuch, revised layout of 'L' shape, was not a unilateral decision of\nrespondent authority. On the contrary, upon personal visit by officers\nof the company, time and again, design was requested to be\nsubmitted for approval of Airport Authority of India (AAP) and as\nsuch, when details were shared about layout indicating the location\netc., subsequently, petitioner did not provide in time its design of\nfood court for approval and as such, it is absolutely incorrect to say\nthat respondent authority had changed the location on their own.\nSaid fact is seriously in dispute.\n\n15. Learned advocate Ms. Pandya submitted that so far as delay,\nas alleged in the petition is concerned, same is also not correct in\nview of the fact that date of handing over the side is specifically\nmentioned as 18.5.2018 with necessary notes and details and as\nsuch, question of delay gestation period does not arise at all.\n\n16. Learned advocate Ms. Pandya on instructions has further\nseriously commented that petitioner after termination of license\nagreement by efflux of time on 30.6.2020 did not remove material\n\nPage 8 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\ndeliberately from the Airport premises and on the contrary, the\npremises were locked by petitioner and, keys were not handed over\nto respondent and peaceful possession had also not been given,\nwhich had constrained the respondent to make a request vide letter\ndated 9.9.2020 to handover quiet and peaceful possession and as\nsuch, the claim which has been generated by respondent authority is\njust and proper. Petitioner was aware about non-extension and\ntermination of contract by efflux of time in their own communication\ndated 3.7.2020. But, with a view to see that authority did not remove\narticles and allowed the license to be run by new operators and that\nwas the conduct which has been considered by the authority while\nraising invoices which are just and proper.\n\n17. Learned advocate Ms. Pandya submitted that petitioner had\nnot cleared the outstanding amount nor even extended the bank\nguarantee nor vacated the premises and as such, the authority was\nleft with no other option but to raise demand upto the month of\nSeptember 2020, i.e. from July to September. It has been\nemphatically submitted that interim order which has been passed by\nthe Court below, i.e. learned City Civil Court, against encashment of\nbank guarantee was an ex-parte ad-interim relief and as such,\npetitioner cannot create an impression that even the Court has found\nfavour with petitioner. In fact, with open eyes, when petitioner has\nentered into an agreement without any demur, even extension was\nalso sought and when payment issue comes up, all these niceties are\nprojected by petitioner which conduct itself speaks volumes about\nthe intent of petitioner.\n\n18. According to Ms. Pandya, in the agreement itself, there is a\nspecific mechanism contained which relates to the resolution of\ndispute amongst the parties and said clause 29 as a part of General\nConditions which has been accepted by the petitioner cannot be\n\nPage 9 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\ndeviated, and as such, when the authority has provided clearly the\ndispute resolution mechanism, it is hardly open for petitioner to seek\nan independent arbitration forum de hors the terms of the\nagreement.\n\n19. Learned advocate Ms. Pandya has submitted that\nsaid clause and precondition contained in the terms have to be\nscrupulously observed by petitioner and during contract period nor\neven till date, said clause has been challenged in the petition and\nsimple relief is sought to appoint an independent arbitrator and as\nsuch, in view of the fact, that Court cannot travel beyond the relief,\nthe petition under\nSection 11\ndoes not deserve to be entertained in\nview of this peculiar background of fact.\n\n20. According to learned advocate Ms. Pandya, specific mechanism\nwhich has been provided cannot be bypassed by petitioner but even\nif stand of the petitioner to be accepted then also, looking to the\nlimited scope of\nSection 11\n, petitioner cannot insist for appointment\nof an independent arbitrator. However, at last, Ms. Pandya has\nsubmitted that if the Court is not inclined to accept the stand of the\nAirport Authority, then\nin that case\n, alternatively instead of name\nwhich has been suggested by petitioner, anyone out of following\nnames may be appointed nominated as arbitrator and for that\npurpose, suggested to appoint Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.S. Jhaveri,\nHon'ble Mr. Justice M.D. Shah and Hon'ble Mr. Justice J.C.\nUpadhayay, former Judges of this High Court, but has submitted that\nthis is in alternative to the stand which has been taken by her in the\npresent proceedings and has left to the discretion of the Court.\n\n21. Having heard learned advocates appearing for the parties and\nhaving gone through the position prevailing on record, before\ndealing with the request of the petitioner, the law on the issue for\n\nPage 10 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nappointment of arbitrator deserves consideration. The object of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nis to see that the grievance\ncan be resolved at the earliest point of time. While framing the\nenactment, it was felt that the economic reforms taking place in the\nCountry may not become fully effective if the laws dealing with the\nsettlement of both domestic and international commercial dispute\nremains out of tune with such reforms. Considering conciliation like\narbitration was also getting worldwide recognition as an instrument\nfor settlement of disputes and as such, with the main object to make\nprovisions for an arbitral procedure which may be fair, efficient and\ncapable of meeting the needs of specific arbitration and to minimize\nthe supervisory role of courts for the arbitral process and to permit\nthe Arbitral Tribunal to use the mediation, conciliation and/or other\nproceedings during the arbitral proceedings in the settlement of\ndisputes, the Act has been enacted.\n\n22. Amongst various provisions under the\nScheme of Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996\n, and amended thereafter, since we are\nconcerned with an issue related to appointment of an independent\narbitrator under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n1996, the proposition relates to that is the central issue.\n\n23. While dealing with the question which crop up for\nconsideration before the Hon'ble Apex Court in the year 2017 as to\nwhether the Chief Justice or any other person designated by him is\nbound to nominate arbitrator as specified in the agreement for\narbitration while exercising power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It was observed that Chief\nJustice or designated Judge of the High Court, if circumstances so\nwarrant is free to appoint an independent arbitrator having due\nregard to qualification and other aspects as required under the\n\nPage 11 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nprovisions. While coming to this conclusion, the Hon'ble Apex Court\nin the case of\nUnion of India v. Besco Limited\nreported in (2017)\n14 SCC 187 has dealt with several decisions delivered in past by the\nHon'ble Apex Court and after considering this, the aforesaid\nconclusion is derived, which the Court deems it proper to reproduce\nhereunder:-\n\n\"8. On the facts of the present case, one wonders whether the\nissue actually arose or not. Clause 2900 of the Standard\nConditions of Contract no doubt provides that the sole\narbitrator shall be Gazetted Railway Officer but in Clause 19.0\nof the agreement dated 16.01.2012 executed between the\nparties, it is clearly stipulated that the contract shall be\ngoverned by the General Conditions and Special Conditions of\nContract. Clause 19.0 specifically provides that \"..... the\ncontract shall be governed by the General Conditions and\nSpecial Conditions of Contract.....\"\n\n24. Further, when the arbitration clause contained under the\nagreement is enforceable or not is also to be looked into to the\nlimited extent while exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11\nof the\nAct. Here, on the case on hand, the relevant clause which is\ncontained in the License Agreement is Clause 18 which reads as\nunder :-\n\n\"Clause-18: All disputes and differences arising out of or in any\nway touching or concerning this Agreement (except those the\ndecision whereof is otherwise herein before expressly provided\nfor or to which the Airports Authority of India, 1994 as\namended by Act, 2003 and the rules framed thereunder\n(Chapter VIA - Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants etc. of\nAirport Premises) which are now enforced or which may\nhereafter come into force are applicable, shall be in the first\ninstance, be referred to a Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC)\nsetup at the airports, for which a written application should be\nsubmitted by the party and the points clearly spelt out. In case\nthe dispute is not resolved within 45 days of reference, then\nthe case shall be referred to the sole arbitration of a person, to\nbe appointed by the Tender Accepting Authority under\n\nPage 12 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\ndelegation of power. The award of the arbitrator so appointed\nshall be final and binding on the parties.\nThe Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\nshall be applicable. Once the arbitration\nclause has been invoked, the DRC process will cease to be\noperative.\n\nIt will be no bar that the Arbitrator appointed as aforesaid is or\nhas been an employee of the Authority and the Award of the\nArbitrator will not be challenged or be open to question in any\nCourt of Law, on this account. The Venue of Arbitration shall\nbe RHQ, WR Mumbai.\n\n(a) The case shall be referred to the Sole Arbitrator by the\nChairman/Member of the Authority subject to the condition\nthat the license shall have to deposit the disputed amount\nwith AAI as condition precedent before making reference to\nthe Arbitrator for adjudication of dispute.\n\n(b) Similarly before making a reference to the Dispute\nResolution Committee, the licensee will have to first deposit\nthe disputed amount with AAI and the consent shall have to\nbe obtained from the licensee for acceptance of the\nrecommendations of the Dispute Resolution Committee.\n\n(c)During the arbitral and Dispute Resolution proceedings the\nlicensee(s) shall continue to pay the full amount of license\nfees/dues regularly as per the award/ agreement and\nperform all covenants of the agreements.\n\n(d) The licensee(s) undertake to pay the full amount of\nlicense fee/dues regularly as per the award/agreement and\nperform all the covenants of the agreement even he/they\nhave requested for appointment of Arbitrator and/or during\nthe course of arbitral proceedings.\"\n\n25. By virtue of aforesaid clause what has been narrated is that at\nthe first instance, the dispute or difference is to be referred to a\nDispute Resolution Committee (DRC) set up at the Airports in the\nmanner which is stipulated in this clause and then if the said dispute\nis not resolved within 45 days then there shall be an appointment of\na sole arbitrator of a person to be appointed by Tender Accepting\nAuthority and there is no bar that the arbitrator so appointed is or\n\nPage 13 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nhas been an employee of the authority and as such, the award of the\narbitrator will not be challenged. So by virtue of this clause, the first\napproach is to DRC then to be referred to the sole arbitrator who\nmay be an employee and would be appointed by the Tender\nAccepting Authority only. This clause also contained the same view,\nsame condition precedent by virtue of which before approaching the\nDispute Resolution Committee, the licensee shall have to first deposit\nthe disputed amount with AAI and later on the process will be\nundertaken. Further, by virtue of Clause 22 of the License\nAgreement, the authority and the licensee are bound to by General\nTerms and Conditions stipulated in Annexure-III. The said Annexure-\nIII attached to the License Agreement is also referring to similar\nterms as that of Clause 18 and since the said terms contained in\nClause 22 is almost similar, the same is not being reproduced\nhereunder, but the process which has been indicated is very same\nprocess.\n\n26. It appears from the record that moment the dispute arose\nbetween the present parties to the agreement, protest appears to\nhave been made by the petitioner specifically indicating that this\nclause is not having any sound legal force and is arbitrary and\nunconstitutional and as such, on 29.12.2020, the petitioner wrote a\nletter to the authority to appoint one retired Hon'ble High Court\nJudge as a sole arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute which arose\nbetween the petitioner and the respondent, but then, in a\ncommunication dated 16.02.2021, the respondent authority has\nspecifically refused to agree to such suggestion made by the\npetitioner on the terms that the said mode is impermissible by virtue\nof Clause 18 (a)(b) & (c ) of the License Agreement and as such,\nbefore processing the same, the petitioner has to approach DRC on\nstipulated conditions, the same appears to have been promptly\n\nPage 14 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nresisted by the petitioner vide communication dated 17.02.2021 on\nthe premise that the said clause and the conditions contained therein\nis absolutely arbitrary and unconstitutional and as such, the same\nwould not be thrust upon and reiterated to give consent to\nappointment of sole arbitrator.\n\n27. So in the aforesaid terms, a short controversy cropped up in\nthe proceedings is that on one hand, a specific process is stipulated\nby the Tender Inviting Authority i.e. the respondent and on the other\nhand, upon dispute being raised a request is made to appoint an\nindependent arbitrator by virtue of exercise of power under\nSection\nof the Act and such course whether permissible or not, is the\nquestion for consideration before the Court. In light of the aforesaid\nobject of\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n, as stated herein-before,\nand in view of the stand of the authority that with attached\nconditions of pre-depositing, the first approach should be before DRC\nto resolve the dispute and then in case of failure, to be referred to an\narbitrator who may be an employee of the authority and the same\ncan be appointed by the authority only whether this circumstance is\nvalid or not is an issue for consideration. Hence, in this context, yet\nagain it would be profiteering for the Court to have an assistance\nfrom few proposition propounded by Hon'ble Apex Court which\ndeserves to be considered.\n\n28. First of all a perusal of the relevant clause contained in the\npetition is to appoint an independent Arbitrator for resolution of the\ndispute arising out of License Agreement at Annexure-C. The said\nLicense Agreement contains several stipulations which stipulations\nare not requested and prayed to be declared as arbitrary or no\nrequest is made to set aside the said conditions. In the context of\nthis, a perusal of License Agreement clearly indicates that the same\n\nPage 15 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nhas been specifically signed in the presence of witness and executed\non 09.04.2018. The terms of the said License Agreement are in\naddition to Condition no. 18 as further stipulated in Clause 22 that\nthe conditions which are reflecting even in Annexure-III are also\nbinding on the parties. The said Clause 22 reads as under :\n\n\"Clause 22- The Authority and the Licensee further agree that\nthey are bound by the General Terms and Conditions found in\nAnnexure-III annexed hereto, Special Terms and Conditions\nfound in Annexure-IV and Award letter dated 20.03.2018\nAnnexure-X annexed hereto.\"\n\n29. Correspondingly, if Annexure-III which consists of general\nTerms and Conditions is also very specific and in the form of\ncondition no. 29, similar terms as that of Clause 18 of License\nAgreement is incorporated. Anneure-IV is the Special Terms and\nConditions which also with open eyes agreed upon by the petitioner.\nAs a part of the tender acceptance conditions, the petitioner is also\nrequired to give acceptance letter in the form of Annexure-VI, which\nis attached to the petition compilation at page 46. The said\nacceptance letter about tender conditions appears to have been\nexecuted by the petitioner and reading of second condition out of\nothers would make it clear that the petitioner has unconditionally\naccepted the tender conditions and the same has been clearly\nunderstood by the petitioner. Condition no. 2 of 4 also deserves to be\nquoted hereunder :-\n\n\"2. I/We hereby unconditionally accept the tender conditions of\nAAI's tender documents in its entirety for the above facility.\n\n4. I/We have carefully read and understood the terms and\nconditions of the license as contained in Tender Documents\nissued by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) including the\nfollowing\n\na) Earnest Money Deposit of Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees Two\n\nPage 16 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nlakhs and fifty thousand only) liable to be forfeited by\nAAI, if on award of license, I/We do not accept the award\nor do not fulfill any of the conditions stipulated in tender\ndocuments, within prescribed time.\n\nb) On account of non-acceptance of award or on account\nof non-completion of tender conditions with the\nprescribed time, I/We shall be debarred by AAI for a\nperiod of one (1) year.\n\nc) In case the documents submitted by my/our firm along\nwith tender are false/incorrect, the tender of my/our firm\nwill be liable to be rejected without assigning any\nreasons. In addition, AAI reserves its right to forfeit the\nEMD of my/our firm and debar my/our firm from\nparticipation in the further tender of AAI.\"\n\n30. In the background of aforesaid situation which the petitioner\nhas bound himself and the same is not disputed, it appears that the\nsaid conditions are to be observed by the petitioner.\n\n31. It is a trite law that it is the domain of Tender Inviting\nAuthority to impose condition according to their requirement and in\nthat sphere, there is hardly any scope of judicial review unless it is\nchallenged before the Court and it is also quite well propounded that\nit is not open for the Court to rewrite the terms and conditions of the\ncontract which the authority has executed. In the very recent past,\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court while dealing with the judicial review in\ncontractual matters has clearly propounded the scope of\ninterference. On analysis of various decisions of past, the Hon'ble\nApex Court in M/s. N.G. Projects Limited v. M/s. Vinod Kumar\nJain & Ors., delivered in Civil Appeal No. 1846 of 2022 decided\non 21.03.2022 has clearly propounded that interference in contract is\nillegal, unwarranted, unless it is manifestly arbitrary or unjust and\nhas conveyed in no uncertain terms that there are inheritance\nlimitations in exercising power of judicial review since the\nGovernment is a guardian of finances of the State and it is expected\n\nPage 17 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nto protect the financial interest of the State and the duty of the Court\nis just to confine itself to few parameters. While opining this, the\nHon'ble Apex Court has also relied upon the decision delivered by\nthe three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nGalaxy Transport Agencies v. New J.K. Roadways\nreported in\n2020 SCC Online SC 1035 which Bench reiterated that the\nauthority which authors the tender document is the best person to\nunderstand and appreciate its requirements and even its\ninterpretation should not be second-guessed by a court in judicial\nreview proceedings and while observing this, the Hon'ble Apex Court\nhas made certain observations in paragraph 22 contained in\nparagraph 16 of\nthe said decision\nsince relevant the Court would like\nto reproduce hereunder:-\n\n\"22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended\nto prevent arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness,\nbias and mala fides. Its purpose is to check whether\nchoice or decision is made \"lawfully\" and not to check\nwhether choice or decision is \"sound\". When the power\nof judicial review is invoked in matters relating to\ntenders or award of contracts, certain special features\nshould be borne in mind. A contract is a commercial\ntransaction. Evaluating tenders and awarding contracts\nare essentially commercial functions. Principles of equity\nand natural justice stay at a distance. If the decision\nrelating to award of contract is bona fide and is in public\ninterest, courts will not, in exercise of power of judicial\nreview, interfere even if a procedural aberration or error\nin assessment or prejudice to a tenderer is made out.\nThe power of judicial review will not be permitted to be\ninvoked to protect private interest at the cost of public\ninterest, or to decide contractual disputes. The tenderer\nor contractor with a grievance can always seek damages\nin a civil court. Attempts by unsuccessful tenderer with\nimaginary grievances, wounded pride and business\nrivalry, to make mountains out of molehills of some\ntechnical/procedural violation or some prejudice to self,\nand persuade courts to interfere by exercising power of\njudicial review, should be resisted. Such interference,\n\nPage 18 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\neither interim or final, may hold up public works for\nyears, or delay relief and succor to thousands and\nmillions and may increase the project cost manifold.\nTherefore, a court before interfering in tender, or\ncontractual matters in exercise of power of judicial\nreview, should pose it itself the following questions:\n\n(i) Whether the process adopted or decision\nmade by the authority is mala fide or\nintended to favour someone;\n\nor\n\nWhether the process adopted or decision made is\nso arbitrary and irrational that the court can say:\"\n\nthe decision is such that no responsible authority\nacting reasonably and in accordance with relevant\nlaw could have reached\";\n\n(ii) Whether public interest is affected.\n\nIf the answers are in the negative, there should be no\ninterference under\nArticle 226.\nCases involving\nblacklisting or imposition of penal consequences on a\ntender/contractor or distribution of State largesse\n(allotment of sites/shops, grant of licenses, dealerships\nand franchises) stand on a different footing as they may\nrequire a higher degree of fairness in action.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\"\n\n32. And after analysis of series of decisions, the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt has observed an interference of writ Court in what\ncircumstances.\n\n\"23. In view of the above judgments of this Court, the Writ\nCourt should refrain itself from imposing its decision over the\ndecision of the employer as to whether or not to accept the bid\nof a tenderer. The Court does not have the expertise to\nexamine the terms and conditions of the present day economic\nactivities of the State and this limitation should be kept in\nview. Courts should be even more reluctant in interfering with\ncontracts involving technical issues as there is a requirement\nof the necessary expertise to adjudicate upon such issues. The\napproach of the Court should be not to find fault with\nmagnifying glass in its hands, rather the Court should examine\n\nPage 19 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nas to whether the decision-making process is after complying\nwith the procedure contemplated by the tender conditions. If\nthe Court finds that there is total arbitrariness or that the\ntender has been granted in a mala fide manner, still the Court\nshould refrain from interfering in the grant of tender but\ninstead relegate the parties to seek damages for the wrongful\nexclusion rather than to injunct the execution of the contract.\nThe injunction or interference in the tender leads to additional\ncosts on the State and is also against public interest.\nTherefore, the State and its citizens suffer twice, firstly by\npaying escalation costs and secondly, by being deprived of the\ninfrastructure for which the present-day Governments are\nexpected to work.\n\n25. In view thereof, we find that the action of the respondent in\nsetting aside the letter of acceptance granted to the appellant\nsuffers from manifest illegality and cannot be sustained.\nConsequently, the appeal is disposed of with a direction to the\nrespondent State to allow the appellant to resume and\ncomplete the work by excluding the period spent in the stay of\nexecution of the contract.\n\n26. A word of caution ought to be mentioned herein that any\ncontract of public service should not be interfered with lightly\nand in any case, there should not be any interim order\nderailing the entire process of the services meant for larger\npublic good. The grant of interim injunction by the learned\nSingle Bench of the High Court has helped no-one except a\ncontractor who lost a contract bid and has only caused loss to\nthe State with no corresponding gain to anyone.\"\n\n33. In view of this recent pronouncements also, in absence of any\nprayer in respect of terms and conditions being arbitrary or\nirrational, the Court sitting in jurisdiction under\nSection 11\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act cannot examine the validity of the\nterms which are unequivocally with open eyes have been accepted\nand here in the case on hand, not only the terms at the initial stage\nafter thorough understanding have been accepted but even extension\nwas also sought for and granted on the very basic terms and the\nsame have been accepted without any demur at any point of time in\npast.\n\nPage 20 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\n34. As said earlier, the scope of\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act is very limited in which the Court has to examine the\nacceptance of arbitration clause itself and nothing more or nothing\nless.\n\n35. Yet in another decision of the recent past of Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of\nOriental Insurance Company Limited v.\nNarbheram Power And Steel Private Limited\nreported in (2018)\n6 SCC 534, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has clearly propounded\nthat it is not open for the Court to rewrite the terms of the contract\nand the related observations contained in paragraph 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 and\n10 are reproduced hereunder :\n\n\"9.1. In General Assurance Society Ltd., the Constitution\nBench, while dealing with the contract of Insurance, has\nopined that such a contract is entered into on the basis of\ncommercial transactions and while interpreting the documents\nrelating to a contract of insurance, the duty of the court is to\ninterpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the\nparties because it is not for the court to make a new contract,\nhowsoever reasonable.\n\n9.2. In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., a two-Judge Bench has\nopined that insurance policy has to be construed having\nreference only to the stipulations contained in it and no\nartificial far-fetched meaning could be given to the words\nappearing in it.\n\n9.3. In United India Insurance Co. Ltd., the Court has ruled\nthat the terms of the policy shall govern the contract between\nthe parties and they are bound to abide by the definitions\ngiven therein. That apart, the expression appearing in the\npolicy should be given interpretation with reference to the\nterms of the policy and with reference to the definitions given\nin any other law because the parties have entered into the\ncontract with eyes wide open.\n\n10. The aforesaid principles are in the realm of settled position\nof law. The natural corollary of the said propositions is that the\n\nPage 21 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nparties are bound by the clauses enumerated in the policy and\nthe court does not transplant any equity to the same by\nrewriting a clause. The court can interpret such stipulations in\nthe agreement. It is because they relate to commercial\ntransactions and the principle of unconscionability of the terms\nand conditions because of the lack of bargaining power does\nnot arise. The said principle comes into play in a different\nsphere.\"\n\n36. In this very decision, the relevant observation contained in\nparagraph 23 and 25 are also worth to be taken note of hence\nreproduced hereunder :-\n\n\"23. It does not need special emphasis that an arbitration\nclause is required to be strictly construed. Any expression in\nthe clause must unequivocally express the intent of arbitration.\nIt can also lay the postulate in which situations the arbitration\nclause cannot be given effect to. If a clause stipulates that\nunder certain circumstances there can be no arbitration, and\nthey are demonstrably clear then the controversy pertaining to\nthe appointment of arbitrator has to be put to rest.\n\n25. The aforesaid communication, submits the learned senior\ncounsel for the respondent, does not amount to denial of\nliability under or in respect of the policy. On a reading of the\ncommunication, we think, the disputation squarely comes\nwithin Part II of Clause 13. The said Part of the Clause clearly\nspells out that the parties have agreed and understood that no\ndifferences and disputes shall be referable to arbitration if the\ncompany has disputed or not accepted the liability. The\ncommunication ascribes reasons for not accepting the claim at\nall. It is nothing else but denial of liability by the insurer in\ntoto. It is not a disputation pertaining to quantum. In the\npresent case, we are not concerned with regard to whether the\npolicy was void or not as the same was not raised by the\ninsurer. The insurance-company has, on facts, repudiated the\nclaim by denying to accept the liability on the basis of the\naforesaid reasons. No inference can be drawn that there is\nsome kind of dispute with regard to quantification. It is a\ndenial to indemnify the loss as claimed by the respondent.\nSuch a situation, according to us, falls on all fours within the\nconcept of denial of disputes and non-acceptance of liability. It\nis not one of the arbitration clauses which can be interpreted\n\nPage 22 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nin a way that denial of a claim would itself amount to dispute\nand, therefore, it has to be referred to arbitration. The parties\nare bound by the terms and conditions agreed under the policy\nand the arbitration clause contained in it. It is not a case\nwhere mere allegation of fraud is leaned upon to avoid the\narbitration.\nIt is not a situation where a stand is taken that\ncertain claims pertain to excepted matters and are, hence, not\narbitrable. The language used in the second part is absolutely\ncategorical and unequivocal inasmuch as it stipulates that it is\nclearly agreed and understood that no difference or disputes\nshall be referable to arbitration if the company has disputed or\nnot accepted the liability. The High Court has fallen into grave\nerror by expressing the opinion that there is incongruity\nbetween Part II and Part III. The said analysis runs counter to\nthe principles\nlaid down in\nthe three-Judge Bench decision in\n\nThe Vulcan Insurance Co. Ltd\n(supra). Therefore, the only\nremedy which the respondent can take recourse to is to\ninstitute a civil suit for mitigation of the grievances. If a civil\nsuit is filed within two months hence, the benefit of\nSection 14\n\nof the Limitation Act, 1963 will ensure to its benefit.\"\n\n37. Further, it is also a clear proposition that principle of waiver\ncannot be applied when the question of public interest comes into.\nNow. In the backdrop of aforesaid principles even it is well\npropounded that the scope of exercising jurisdiction under\nSection\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and the scope of extra\nordinary jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution are\naltogether different and\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act is requiring the Court only to look into the existence\nof arbitration clause. Had there been a petition under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution of India, the Court would have probably examine the\narbitrariness as alleged in the terms of contract, but here is a\npetition smartly placed simply under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act to appoint an independent arbitrator to resolve\nthe grievance without there being process through the Specific\nTerms and Conditions contained in clause 18 of the License\nAgreement.\n\nPage 23 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\n38. A close perusal of condition no. 18 which is unequivocally\naccepted for which the petitioner is bound to follow is firstly\nrequiring the petitioner to approach the Dispute Resolution\nCommittee (DRC) setup at Airports with written application and then\nif the dispute is not resolved within 45 days then the question would\ncome up for referring the matter to the sole arbitrator to be\nappointed by the Tender Inviting Authority. So the question of\nappointment of arbitrator would come at a later stage and not before\napproaching DRC. Now for approaching DRC, terms are clearly set\nup and certain steps to be taken by the petitioner and this condition\nwas very much prevailing right from day one when the petitioner\nentered into contract and as such, without complying the\nrequirement of approaching DRC, the petitioner cannot avoid the\nsteps and directly request for appointment of an independent\narbitrator and if this be entertained it would be allowing the\npetitioner to circumvent the process of terms which are clearly\ndeduced in writing and well accepted by the petitioner. The Court in\nabsence of challenge to this terms being arbitrary or unconstitutional\ncannot allow the parties to circumvent the terms which are well\naccepted and emphaized and as such, the Court is of the considered\nopinion that the question of appointing independent arbitrator in this\nbackground fact would not be safely to be answered and if the same\nwould tantamount to allow the parties to go and flout the terms\nwhich are specifically understood to be complied with, the Court\ncannot be a party to such kind of strategic move of the petitioner in\nthe absence of any challenge.\n\n39. In almost similar circumstance while dealing with the issue\nrelated to arbitration clause in the case of Punjab State Water\nSupply and Sewerage Board in Civil Appeal No. 2713 of 2019\ndecided on 11.03.2019 initially the concerned appellant had\n\nPage 24 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nrequested for appointment of arbitrator and sought waiver of ten\npercent deposit fee which was condition precedent and after having\nreceived no response, the appellant had filed Civil Writ Petition no.\n18917 of 2016 before the High Court of Punjab & Haryana and the\nsaid writ petition was dismissed vide judgment and order dated\n14.09.2016 inter alia stating that such tender conditions can in no\nway said to be arbitrary or unreasonable and then a substantive writ\npetition appears to have been filed for challenging the validity of that\npart of the condition which was numbered as Civil Writ Petition No.\n4882 of 2017 and in that context the Hon'ble Apex Court then has\nexamined the issue and struck down clause 25(viii) of the notice\ninviting tender and observed that clause being severable from the\nrest of Clause 25 will not affect the remaining parts of Clause 25. The\nrelevant extract of the part contained in paragraph 3, 4 and 28 are\nreproduced hereunder :\n\n\"3. The Appellant had entered into similar contracts with\nRespondent No.2 which contained the same arbitration clause.\nIt had therefore addressed letters to Respondent No. 2 with\nregard to appointment of arbitrator in those matters and\nsought for waiving the 10% deposit fee. After having received\nno response, the Appellant had filed a writ petition, being Civil\nWrit Petition No. 18917 of 2016, before the High Court of\nPunjab and Haryana. This writ petition was dismissed by a\njudgment dated 14.09.2016 stating that such tender condition\ncan in no way be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable.\n\n4. On 08.03.2017, the Appellant approached the High Court of\nPunjab and Haryana challenging the validity of this part of the\narbitration Clause by filing Civil Writ Petition No. 4882 of\n2017. The High Court in the impugned judgment merely\nfollowed the earlier judgment and dismissed this writ petition\nas well.\n\n28. For all these reasons, we strike down Clause 25(viii) of the\nnotice inviting tender. This Clause being severable from the\nrest of Clause of 25 will not affect the remaining parts of\nClause 25. The judgment of the High Court is set aside the\n\nPage 25 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nappeal allowed.\"\n\n40. So the entire observations in\nthe said judgment\nhave been in\nthe context of later part of challenge in a substantive petition\nassailing the validity and the part of the arbitration clause, whereas\nhere on the case on hand, a simple prayer is made to appoint an\nindependent arbitrator. Neither this prayer till date of the final\narguments have been requested to be amended nor the terms of the\ncontract have questioned about its validity and as such, the Court\ncannot travel beyond the relief which has been sought in the petition\nand this petition being simply a petition under\nSection 11\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, and not under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India, the Court is not inclined to even mould the\nrelief and set aside or declare the conditions of the contract as\ninvalid in absence of any relief. Accordingly, in the considered\nopinion of this Court, the petitioner is bound to observe the terms\nand the conditions of the contract and then the question would arise\nfor referring the matter to arbitrator. Had there been petition under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India, the Court would have\nexamine probably the grievance which is voiced out in the oral\nsubmissions about the validity of the conditions, but in the peculiar\nbackground of this fact, the Court would not like to exercise such\njurisdiction which otherwise is not called for to be exercised.\n\n41. At this stage, the assertions which have been made in the\npetition by the petitioner are also seriously disputed version which\nthe Court may not dwell into for its adjudication. For example the\npetitioner has stated on oath in paragraph 2.9 that it has handed\nover the possession of the premises forthwith upon the License\nAgreement being terminated by efflux of time on 30.06.2020, but the\nassets are lying in such premises. Now this assertion has been\nstoutly controverted by the authority in paragraph 10 of the affidavit-\n\nPage 26 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nin-reply on page 144 clearly pointing out that not only the petitioner\nhas not cleared the outstanding dues nor even extended the bank\nguarantee, but has also not vacated the premises and has submitted\nin paragraph 7 of the said affidavit that not only the possession was\nnot delivered back to the authority after termination of contract, but\neven did not remove the material lying in the Airport premises and\nhas locked the premises and keys have not been handed over to the\nauthority and as such, has clearly flouted one of the conditions of the\nLicense Agreement as well and despite the fact that specific request\nwas made by the respondent vide communication dated 09.09.2020\nrequesting to hand quiet and peaceful possession, same has not been\ndone and as such, the authority was constrained to ask for dues even\nfor subsequent period i.e. upto September, 2020 on account of\npossession having not been handed over. So in this context it is the\nassertion of the authority that the petitioner is liable to pay dues to\nthe extent of 2,09,01,768/- but instead keeping all circumstances in\nmind, including Covid pandemic effect has raised invoice only to the\nextent of Rs.51,95,505/- and as such, the conduct of the petitioner is\nalso appearing to be not trustworthy even as per the respondent\nauthority and as such, all these issues about the conduct of the\npetitioner and the circumstances related to it are not to be examined\nin simple petition under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act and hence, conjoint effect of records of case and the\nsubmissions made by the learned counsel appearing for both the\nsides, it appears that the question of appointment of independent\nauthority at this stage. The question of appointment of arbitrator\nwould come into effect when all other terms precede to such are\nbeing observed by the petitioner and that having not done, at this\nstage the Court would not like to allow the petitioner to circumvent\nthe process unless.\n\nPage 27 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\n42. Further, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has\n\nsubmitted that the discretion is left with the authority to appoint an\narbitrator of its own choice may be an employee as well, but that\nstage having not reached; it is not open for the petitioner to agitate\nat this stage. The Court would like to quote certain observations\ncontained in the decision delivered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\ncase of\nPress Council of India v. Union of India and Anr.\n,\nreported in (2012) 12 SCC 329, where the Court cannot travelled\nbeyond the relief and the said observation contained in paragraph 6\nwould with full emphasis apply here when this petition is basically\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and not\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India. The said paragraph 6\nreads thus:\n\n\"6. Having gone through the prayers in the writ petition and\nthe orders passed by the High Court, we are of the opinion that\nthe High Court ought not to have issued the aforesaid direction\nfor the sole and simple reason that the prayers int eh writ\npetition were entirely different from the order passed by the\nHigh Court and the order passed by the High Court as\naforesaid is also not in consonance with the prayers so made.\nOn this short ground alone, the appeals are required to be\nallowed and they are allowed accordingly and the order passed\nby the High Court is set aside. We clarify that we have not\ngone into other issues raised by the appellants in these\nappeals. Ordered accordingly.\"\n\n43. In view of the aforesaid discussion and in view of the peculiar\nbackground of facts and the conduct of the petitioner, this is not a fit\ncase in which the Court can allow the petitioner to simply\ncircumvent the process of resolution of dispute which has been\nspecifically agreed upon and signed by him.\n\n44. In this background of fact and having gone through the\ndecisions which have been cited by the learned counsel appearing for\n\nPage 28 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nthe petitioner the circumstances prevailing on record are altogether\ndifferent and peculiar in nature. The object and purpose of bringing\nthis petition of the petitioner is also self-explanatory to avoid\ncompliance of his obligation and as discussed above, those decisions\nwhich have been referred to and relied upon are in different\ncontextual facts situation, same are not assisting the petitioner to\nclaim relief as prayed for in the petition. Hence, having gone\nthrough the said decisions which have been cited by the learned\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner, the Court is of the opinion that\nthe same are not coming to the rescue of the petitioner from\nachieving the object for which the petitioner has brought petition at\nthis stage without approaching DRC. On the contrary, from the\npleadings and the annexures, the petitioner has not approached or\nmade any attempt at first instance to approach DRC which would\nclearly indicate that the intention of the petitioner is to avoid the\nterms of the contract and to keep him away from its obligation to\nobserve. Hence, this being a different background of facts, the\njudgments which have been pointed out no doubt reflecting salutary\nprinciple, but the Court is unable to apply the same to extend the\nrelief to the petitioner.\n\n45. No doubt the object of\nArbitration Act\nto encourage a speedy\nresolution dispute amongst the parties and to see that minimum\nintervention of judicial forum would take place in dispute resolution,\nbut under the guise of such object of the act and the parameters of\njurisdiction under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\nthe Court would not like to encourage such kind of litigant who are\nout to circumvent the process of dispute resolution once having\nagreed upon in a specific terms with open eyes and then turn around\nto contend that such terms are arbitrary or unconstitutional without\npraying also and thereto in a proceedings which are not in extra\n\nPage 29 of 30\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Dec 24 18:23:31 IST 2022\n\nC/IAAP/36/2021 ORDER DATED: 08/06/2022\n\nordinary jurisdiction. Hence, despite the aforesaid object, this is not\na fit case in which the petitioner can take undue advantage of the\nobject of the Act. Hence, the Court would like to refrain from\nexercising jurisdiction in this specific background of facts under\n\nSection 11\nof Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Accordingly the\npetition being devoid of merit stands dismissed. Notice is discharged\nwith no order as to costs.\n\n(ASHUTOSH J.
