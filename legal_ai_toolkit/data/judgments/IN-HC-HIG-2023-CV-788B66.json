Pursuant to the aforesaid notification, the Government of Tamil Nadu\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n20/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nissued G.O. (Ms) No. 181, School Education (C2) Department 15.11.2011, in\n\nwhich the Teachers Recruitment Board (in short, “the TRB”) was designated as\n\nthe Nodal Agency for conducting the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) in the\n\nState of Tamil Nadu. Subsquently, another G.O., viz., G.O. (Ms) No. 90,\n\nSchool Education (Q) Department 28.03.2012, came to be passed, to the\n\nfollowing effect:\n\n\"....In the G.O. (Ms) No. 181, School Education (C2) Department, dated\n15.11.2011, the Government has changed the recruitment policy for\nrecruitment of Secondary Grade Teachers and Graduate Assistants.\nHenceforth, the recruitment will be based on written examination, namely,\nTeacher Eligibility Test in accordance with the guidelines issued by the\nNational Council for Teacher Education. The qualifying candidates of the\nTeacher Eligibility Test will be recruited based on marks, communal rotation\nand certificate verification.\n\n2.However, with respect to the recruitment of Secondary Grade Teachers, the\nstate-wide seniority in employment exchange registration will continue till the\ndisposal of the Special Leave Petition filed in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nSubsequently, in GO. Ms. No. 244 School Education [EE(3)2] Department\n\ndated 30.11.2013, it was clarified that the Government has examined the\n\nmatter and directed the Teachers Recruitment Board to follow the procedure for\n\nselection of Secondary Grade Teachers also on the basis of the marks obtained\n\nin TET.\n\n4. Thus, as per the G.Os. referred to above, possessing TET\n\nqualification has become essential and mandatory for the teaching faculties\n\nfrom 23.08.2010 (subsequently extended by NCTE notification to 29.07.2011)\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n21/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nin the State.\n\n5. The Nodal Agency (TRB) in the State of Tamil Nadu, has conducted\n\nTET examination for the first time on 12.07.2012 from which it could be\n\ninferred that no person, who had passed the TET, would have been available to\n\nbe appointed during the period from 23.08.2010 to 12.07.2012 as a teacher. It\n\nis in that backdrop that the first and second proviso to clause (2) of\nSection 23\n\nof the RTE Act enable those teachers, who were appointed during that period,\n\nto pass the TET by 31.03.2019 for their continuance in the post.\n\n6. Though there is a requirement in the Notification No.76-4/2010\n\n/NCTE/Acad dated 11.02.2011 published by the NCTE that the TET should be\n\nconducted atleast once in every year and there will be no restriction on the\n\nnumber of attempts a person can take for acquiring a TET Certificate and a\n\nperson who has qualified the TET may also appear again for improving his/her\n\nscore, it has been brought to notice that the TET has not been conducted\n\nannually in the State of Tamil Nadu except on 14.10.2012, 17.08.2013,\n\n18.08.2013, 29.04.2017, 30.04.2017, 08.06.2019 and 09.06.2019. Thus,\n\ntaking this situation that TET had not been conducted in the years 2014, 2015,\n\n2016 and 2018, the persons appointed during the period from 23.08.2010 to\n\n12.07.2012 have claimed exemption from passing TET, particularly when it is\n\nnot in dispute that the TET has been conducted during the years 2012, 2013\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n22/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nand 2017 and they have had sufficient opportunity to prepare and appear for\n\nthe TET during the said period.\nIn this context, the Division Bench of this\n\nCourt in\nState of Tamil Nadu v. R.Arivazhagan (Order\ndated 24.01.2017 in\n\nW.A. No. 1126 of 2016 etc., batch) had taken note of those aspects of the\n\nmatter and held as follows:\n\n\"42.Accordingly, to meet the ends of justice, the writ appeals and the writ\npetitions are disposed with the following directions:\n\n(i)The Teachers herein, who have been appointed subsequent to the\nissuance of the Government Order, are granted one opportunity to appear\nfor the Teacher Eligibility Test to be conducted by the Teachers Recruitment\nBoard and in the event of their passing in the Teacher Eligibility Test, their\nappointments shall be approved else, they have no other option but to quit\nthe service/ousted from service;\n\n(ii)Till the results are published, the Government shall pay the salary to the\nTeachers, who are in service of the aided institutions, for the service\nrendered by them and in the cases where salary was not paid the same\nshall be paid along with arrears, if any, forthwith;\n\n(iii)Learned Advocate General submitted that salary has been paid to most\nof the Teachers and only a few were not paid, for want of particulars. In\nsuch a case, the Teachers whose salary have not been paid for want of\nparticulars, they shall furnish the requisite particulars immediately, so as\nto enable the Government pay the salary immediately.\n\n(iv)Insofar as W.P. No. 7953 of 2015 is concerned, though the writ\npetitioner has qualified with a pass in Teacher Eligibility Test during 2013,\nshe has not been paid the difference of salary from the date of\nappointment, till the date of passing of the Teacher Eligibility Test. In view\nof the discussions aforesaid, the Government is directed to pay the\ndifference of salary within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt\nof a copy of this order; and\n\n(v)The Teachers Recruitment Board is directed to take note of the above\nobservations and to issue notification for conducting Teacher Eligibility\nTest on or before the end of February 2017, indicating the date of exam to\nbe either in the last week of March 2017 or in the first week of April 2017.\"\n\n7.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis With this introductory background, the averments raised in the\n\n23/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nappeals as well as the writ petitions are required to be dealt with,\n\nindependently. The pleadings have been arranged for narration on the basis of\n\nthe issues that arise for consideration as referred to at the first instance, Issue\n\nNo. (i) being covered by W.A.No. 2795/2022, W.P. Nos.3364 & 3368 of 2023,\n\nand Issue No. (ii) being covered by W.A.Nos.313, 833, 1891, 2050, 2082,\n\n2617 of 2022 & WA.Nos.19, 31, 32 & 36 of 2023.\n\n8. W.A. No. 2795 of 2022\n\n8.1. The appellants are aggrieved by the order dated 20.10.2012 passed\n\nby the learned Judge in WP No. 19587 of 2022 filed by them.\n\n8.2. The appellants have filed WP No. 19587 of 2022 praying to quash\n\nthe order dated 11.07.2022 of the second respondent insofar as it relates to\n\npostponing of the promotion counselling scheduled to be held on 14.07.2022\n\nand 15.07.2022 for the post of B.T. Assistant from among the Secondary\n\nGrade Teachers and after quashing the said order dated 11.07.2022, sought for\n\na consequential direction to the second respondent to instruct all the Chief\n\nEducational Officers to conduct the promotion counselling for the post of B.T.\n\nAssistant in High Schools and Higher Secondary Schools from the post of\n\nSecondary Grade Teachers, within a time frame.\n\n8.3. Even though the learned Judge allowed the writ petition and quashed\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n24/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nthe order dated 11.07.2022 of the second respondent with a further direction to\n\nconduct promotion counselling, the appellants are aggrieved by the observation\n\nmade by the learned Judge to the effect that teachers without TET are not\n\nentitled to continue in service in the schools/educational institutions and are not\n\nentitled for promotion to BT Assistants from the cadre of secondary grade\n\nteachers unless they qualify for TET.\n\n8.4. According to the appellants, the learned Judge went beyond the\n\nscope of the writ petition and issued such directions which had adversely\n\naffected their right to continue in service. The appellants have filed the writ\n\npetition only against the postponement of the promotion counselling inasmuch\n\nas they are continuing in the post of Secondary Grade Teachers without being\n\npromoted to the post of B.T. Assistant by citing the non-possession of TET.\n\nWhen the appellants sought for a direction to the respondents to expeditiously\n\nconduct the promotion counselling, the learned Judge overstepped and held\n\nthat those who did not possess TET are not entitled to promotion and continue\n\nin service. Such finding will have a cascading effect in their continuing in\n\nservice. The appellants further stated that they were appointed from 1991 to\n\n2011 on various dates and they are continuing in service without promotion.\n\nOn the other hand, those who were appointed after the appellants have climbed\n\nthe promotion ladder and are holding higher posts. It is also stated by the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n25/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nappellants that they are not required to pass TET at all inasmuch as they were\n\nappointed much prior to the issuance of G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011 as\n\nwell as the conduct of TET for the first time in the State; and that, this\n\nHonourable Court had passed several orders holding that pass in TET is\n\ncompulsory only for direct recruitment to the post of B.T. Assistants and not\n\nfor those who are seeking promotion to the said post. The appellants further\n\nstated that there was no condition imposed in their order of appointment.\n\nHowever, by virtue of the notification dated 23.08.2010, they are required to\n\npass TET as a condition precedent for promoting them to higher post. Such a\n\ncondition is conspicuously absent in the order of appointment issued to the\n\nappellants and therefore, they cannot be directed to complete TET as a\n\ncondition precedent for conferment of promotion or for the purpose of\n\ncontinuing in service. In any event, when there are several orders cited on\n\nbehalf of the appellants and the learned Judge did not agree with the decisions\n\nrendered by this Court in the earlier orders, judicial discipline demands that the\n\nmatter ought to have been referred to a Division Bench. Instead, the learned\n\nJudge observed that those who did not possess TET has to be shown the exit\n\ndoor and they are not having any right to remain in service. Such an\n\nobservation made by the learned Judge is legally not sustainable. Further, the\n\nGovernment issued G.O. (Ms.) No. 13, School Education [S.E 3(1)]\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n26/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nDepartment dated 30.01.2020 whereby the Special Rules for the Tamil Nadu\n\nSchool Educational Subordinate Service, was published. Even in the said\n\nGovernment Order, it was only stated that TET is necessary for appointment of\n\na graduate teacher, however, it cannot be insisted in the case of promotion to\n\nthe post of B.T. Assistant. The said Government Order in G.O. (Ms.) No.13,\n\nSchool Education Department dated 30.01.2020 was not challenged and\n\ntherefore also, the order passed by the learned Judge required to be interfered\n\nwith by this Court. Accordingly, the appellants prayed for allowing this appeal.\n\n8.5. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants in W.A.No.2795 of\n\n2022 would contend that the appellants were appointed as Secondary Grade\n\nTeachers between 1991 and 2011 on various dates and they have rendered\n\nmore than two decades of service without any promotion. However, during the\n\ncourse of their service, NCTE has made TET qualification mandatory for all\n\nappointments from the date of the notification on 23.08.2010. It was also made\n\nclear that for appointments made prior to the notification, possessing TET is\n\nnot required.\n\n9. WP Nos. 3364 & 3368 of 2023:\n\n9.1. WP No. 3364 of 2023 is filed by TET Passed Candidates Welfare\n\nAssociation, while WP No. 3368 of 2023 has been filed by one Sakthivel. Both\n\nthese writ petitions have been filed to issue a Writ of Declaration declaring that\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n27/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nthe Special Rules for the Tamilnadu School Educational Subordinate Service\n\nissued in G.O. Ms. No.13, School Education Department dated 30.01.2020\n\ninsofar as it prescribes \"a pass in TET only for direct recruitment for the post of\n\nBT Assistant and not for promotion thereto in Annexure-I (referred to in Rule\n\n6)\" is illegal being ultra vires the\nRight of Children to Free and Compulsory\n\nEducation Act, 2009\nand the Rules framed thereunder and the NCTE\n\nnotifications dated 23.08.2010 and 29.07.2011.\n\n9.2. According to the petitioner in WP No.3364 of 2023, it is a registered\n\nassociation and they have been espousing the cause of candidates who have\n\npassed TET. It is stated that NCTE issued the notification dated 23.08.2010\n\nprescribing minimum qualification for being appointed as a Teacher for\n\nimparting teaching to students studying Classes I to V (secondary grade\n\nteachers) and Classes VI to VIII (B.T. Assistants). As per the notification dated\n\n23.08.2010, the teachers appointed prior to the notification need not pass TET.\n\nHowever, by a subsequent notification dated 29.07.2011, amendments were\n\nmade to the notification dated 23.08.2010 in which also, the requirement to\n\npass TET has become necessary for the purpose of appointment. The\n\nGovernment also issued G.O. Ms. No.173, dated 08.11.2011 framing the Tamil\n\nNadu Right of Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011 followed by\n\nanother order in G.O. (Ms.) No.181 dated 15.11.2011 appointing TRB as the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n28/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nnodal agency to conduct TET exam. As per the orders of the Government,\n\npassing TET is mandatory for all secondary grade teachers as well as BT\n\nAssistants in the State.\n\n9.3. It is further stated by the petitioners that pursuant to the orders of the\n\nGovernment, TRB has conducted several TET exams and the results declared\n\nin those examinations were the subject matter of various litigations before this\n\nCourt. However, it is clear that no selection shall be made to the post of\n\nSecondary Grade Teachers and BT Assistants without the TET qualification\n\nand no approval for any appointment was given by the educational agency in\n\nfavour of those who do not pass TET.\n\n9.4. The petitioners, in unison, would state that the Government of Tamil\n\nNadu has now framed Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Elementary Education\n\nSubordinate Service in GO Ms. No.12, School Education [EE1(1)] Department\n\ndated 30.01.2020 and Special Rules for the Tamil Nadu School Educational\n\nSubordinate Service vide G.O. Ms. No.13, School Education [S.E 3(1)]\n\nDepartment dated 30.01.2020. In the aforesaid Government Orders, while\n\nprescribing qualification for the post of Graduate Teacher (BT Assistant) in\n\nAnnexure I (as referred to in Rule 6) of the Special Rules, it was specified that\n\n\"a pass in TET\" is mandatory only for direct recruitment. As far as the mode of\n\nappointment, it was stated that the post of BT Assistant/Graduate Teacher can\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n29/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nbe filled by way of transfer, promotion or direct recruitment, meaning thereby,\n\nfor transfer and promotion, the in-service candidates in the post of Secondary\n\nGrade Teachers can be considered even without TET qualification for\n\npromotion to the post of BT Assistant.\n\n9.5. The grievance of the writ petitioners is that such a prescription to\n\npromote the in-service candidates to the higher post without TET qualification\n\nis against the spirit of\nRTE Act\nand the Rules made thereunder. Therefore,\n\nchallenging G.O. Ms. No.12, School Education Department dated 30.01.2020,\n\nthe petitioner Association has earlier filed WP (MD) No. 9707 of 2022 before\n\nthis Court. Similarly, another writ petition in WP (MD) No. 9708 of 2022 was\n\nfiled by one K. Rajasekaran. Both the writ petitions were taken up for hearing\n\non 11.05.2020 and an interim order was granted to the effect that any\n\npromotion order passed by the official respondents will be subject to the\n\noutcome of the final order to be passed in the writ petitions.\n\n9.6. During the pendency of the writ petitions, the Commissioner of\n\nSchool Education has passed an order dated 30.06.2022 directing all the Chief\n\nEducational Officers to prepare a panel in the category of Secondary Grade\n\nTeacher for promotion to the post of BT Assistant. Challenging the said order\n\ndated 30.06.2022, the petitioner in WP No. 3368 of 2023 has earlier filed WP\n\nNo. 17895 of 2022 to quash the proceedings dated 30.06.2022 of the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n30/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nCommissioner of School Education, Chennai, insofar as it relates to promotion\n\nto the post of B.T. Assistant from those unqualified candidates without passing\n\nTET by conducting promotion counselling. In connection with the same\n\ndispute, some of the in-service candidates have also filed WP No. 19587 of\n\n2022 challenging the order dated 11.07.2022 of the Commissioner of School\n\nEducation, Chennai postponing the promotion counselling scheduled to be held\n\non 14.07.2022 and 15.07.2022 for the post of B.T. Assistant from the post of\n\nSecondary Grade Teacher as per the proceedings dated 30.06.2022 and to\n\ndirect the Commissioner of School Education to instruct all the Chief\n\nEducational Officers to conduct promotion counselling for promotion to the\n\npost of B.T. Assistant. Both the WP No.17895 of 2022 and WP No. 19587 of\n\n2022 were taken up for hearing and by order dated 20.10.2022, WP No. 17895\n\nof 2022 filed by the TET passed candidate Sakthivel was allowed and WP No.\n\n19587 of 2022 was dismissed.\n\n9.7. As against the common order dated 20.10.2022, the petitioners in\n\nWP No. 19587 of 2022 have filed Writ Appeal No. 2795 of 2022 before this\n\nCourt, wherein the petitioner in WP No. 3364 of 2023 impleaded themselves as\n\nparty respondent and opposed the writ appeal by stating that in-service\n\ncandidates, who do not possess TET qualification cannot be conferred with\n\nfurther promotion. According to the writ petitioners, number of in-service\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n31/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ncandidates do not possess TET qualification, however, they are asserting a right\n\nfor promotion to the post of B.T. Assistant. If promotion to the post of B.T.\n\nAssistant is made from among unqualified secondary grade teachers, who do\n\nnot pass TET, the qualified persons, who have passed TET, will be deprived of\n\ntheir legitimate right of appointment and promotion. The unqualified in-service\n\ncandidates solely rely upon G.O. Ms. Nos. 12 and 13 dated 30.01.2020 for\n\nconferment of promotion to the post of B.T. Assistant without possession of\n\nTET and therefore, challenging the aforesaid orders of the Government, these\n\nwrit petitions in WP Nos. 3364 & 3368 of 2023 have been filed.\n\n9.8. A counter affidavit has been filed in WP No. 3368 of 2023 by the\n\nJoint Director (Personnel), Commissioner of School Education, Chennai\n\ncontending inter alia that number of candidates, who do not possess the\n\nmandatory TET, have been appointed in Government aided school and\n\ntherefore, their appointments are not approved by the Department. However,\n\non the basis of interim order passed by this Court in the writ petitions filed by\n\nsuch candidates, they continue to remain in service and on the basis of such\n\norders, temporary appointments have been given by the Department to the\n\nnonqualified teachers. It is stated in the counter affidavit that the nodal agency\n\nnamely TRB has conducted TET examination on 03.06.2012 in which\n\n3,05,405 candidates appeared, but only 1735 passed the examination.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n32/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nSubsequently, TET examination was conducted on various dates in which very\n\nfew have passed the examination. It is further stated that the State Government\n\nstrictly adheres to the provisions of\nRTE Act, 2009\nwhich made it mandatory\n\nfor all those teachers, both secondary grade teachers as well as B.T. Assistant\n\nappointed on or after 01.04.2020 to acquire TET qualification. As far as\n\nGovernment Schools are concerned, only those candidates, who passed TET,\n\nalone are appointed after the coming into force of the said Act. The teachers\n\nappointed in the minority aided schools claim that they need not acquire TET\n\nin view of the order passed by the Constitutional Bench of the Honourable\n\nSupreme Court in\nPramati Educational and Cultural Trust and others v.\n\nUnion of India\n[(2014) 8 SCC 1]. However, the issue that was dealt with\nin\n\nthat case\nrelates to reservation of 25% of seats in the schools for the children\n\nbelonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections of the society and\nthe said\n\ndecision\nhas no application to their case.\n\n9.9. With reference to the Judgment passed in W.A.(MD)No.859 of 2019\n\nfiled by Tmt. B. Annie Packiarani Bai, the Department has filed SLP (C) Diary\n\nNo. 17702 of 2021 before the Honourable Supreme Court and it is pending. In\n\nanother batch of cases in W.A. No. 1723 of 2019 filed against the order dated\n\n30.04.2019 in WP No. 13306 of 2019, the Division Bench of this Court has\n\ndirected the Department to issue show cause notice to those who have not\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n33/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\npassed TET. However, this Court, by an order dated 16.05.2019, granted\n\ninterim injunction restraining the Educational authorities from terminating the\n\nteachers pending disposal of the writ appeals. Thus, according to the\n\nrespondent authorities, the prayer made in the writ petitions is devoid of merits\n\nand is liable to be rejected.\n\n10. Writ Appeal Nos. 313 and 833 of 2022\n\n10.1. These appeals arise out of the common order dated 29.07.2021\n\npassed by the learned Judge in WP Nos. 23999 and 24003 of 2019.\n\n10.2. Both the aforesaid writ petitions have been filed for issuing a Writ of\n\nMandamus forbearing the respondents therein from insisting passing of TET\n\nand to direct the respondents to continue to make salary, including annual\n\nincrement, incentive increment and other service benefits to them.\n\n10.3. According to the writ petitioners, they were appointed as B.T.\n\nAssistant on 15.06.2011 and 29.07.2011 respectively and their appointment\n\nhas also been approved by the educational agency. While so, after their\n\nappointment, the Government issued G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education\n\nDepartment dated 15.11.2011 appointing TRB as nodal agency to conduct\n\nTET. Therefore, the writ petitioners who were appointed prior to the issuance\n\nof G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011, are not required to complete TET or the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n34/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nacquisition of TET qualification cannot be put against them for the purpose of\n\nconferment of annual increment, incentive and other service benefits. However,\n\nthe school, where they were employed, are refusing to pay salary and other\n\nmonetary benefits to them by citing non-possession of TET.\n\n10.4. The learned Judge, on considering the rival submissions, held that\n\nthe petitioners, who were appointed on 15.06.2011 and 29.07.2011, cannot be\n\ninsisted to possess TET qualification as prescribed by NCTE. The learned\n\nJudge also, by placing reliance on the order dated 30.07.2020 passed by this\n\nCourt in WP (MD) Nos. 8313 of 2020 etc., batch in Mrs. D. Raja Malar vs.\n\nThe State of Tamil Nadu, Department of School Education and others, held\n\nthat the writ petitioners were appointed prior to issuance of G.O. Ms. No.181\n\ndated 15.11.2011 and they are not required to pass TET as a condition\n\nprecedent for payment of salary and other monetary benefits. Accordingly, a\n\ndirection was issued to the respondents therein to pay the salary, including\n\nannual increment and other incentives payable to the writ petitioners within a\n\nperiod of eight weeks. Aggrieved by the common order dated 29.07.2021\n\npassed by the learned Judge in WP Nos. 23999 and 24003 of 2019, the present\n\nintra-court appeals in W.A. Nos. 313 and 833 of 2022 are filed.\n\n10.5. Assailing the order dated 29.07.2021 of the learned Judge, it is\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n35/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ncontended by the appellants that the appointment of the writ petitioners\n\nwithout possession of TET would be considered as without adequate\n\nqualification and it is against the prescription of minimum qualification under\n\nthe\nRTE Act, 2009\n. The learned Judge, while allowing the writ petitions, did\n\nnot consider that sufficient and adequate time has been given to the teachers\n\nlike the writ petitioners to acquire TET, however, they did not possess such\n\nqualification. After coming into force of the\nRTE Act, 2009\n, acquisition of TET\n\nqualification is mandatory for appointment as teachers. Even though the writ\n\npetitioners were appointed in the year 2011, till this date, they have not chosen\n\nto acquire such qualification and therefore, it shall be deemed that they are\n\ncontinuing in service as B.T. Assistant without the mandatory qualification\n\nprescribed under the\nRTE Act, 2009\n. While so, the order passed by the learned\n\nJudge, directing the appellants to pay the writ petitioners their salary, annual\n\nincrements and other incentives is not proper and hence, prayed for setting\n\naside the same by allowing the writ appeals.\n\n11. W.A. No. 1891 of 2022\n\n11.1. This appeal arises out of the order dated 22.10.2021 passed by the\n\nlearned Judge in WP No. 22221 of 2021.\n\n11.2. The aforesaid writ petition was filed by one K.A. Karpagam, praying\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n36/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nto issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the appellants to sanction annual\n\nincrement to her in the post of B.T. Assistant (Science-Zoology) in the second\n\nrespondent school from the year 2016 without reference to passing TET with\n\nall consequential benefits.\n\n11.3. According to the writ petitioner, she was appointed as B.T. Assistant\n\nin Sri Sarada Vidyalaya Higher Secondary School for Girls, Fairlands, Salem\n\non 19.03.2011 and her appointment was also approved by the educational\n\nauthorities on 24.05.2011. In the meanwhile, based on G.O. Ms. No.181 dated\n\n15.11.2011, making TET qualification mandatory, the writ petitioner has not\n\nbeen paid annual increments payable to her. The writ petitioner further stated\n\nthat she was appointed on 19.03.2011, prior to issuing G.O. Ms. No.181 dated\n\n15.11.2011 and therefore insisting her to pass TET. as a condition precedent\n\nfor payment of annual increment and other benefits. is illegal.\n\n11.4. The learned Judge, by the order dated 22.10.2021, allowed WP No.\n\n22221 of 2021 filed by the writ petitioner by placing reliance on the earlier\n\norder passed by this Court in WP No. 20013 of 2021 and held that as per\n\nSection 23\nof the RTE Act, a teacher, who did not possess the minimum\n\nqualification shall acquire it within a period of five years, however,\n\nconsequences of not obtaining such qualification has neither been prescribed in\n\nthe Act nor the Rules and Government Orders. It was further held that as long\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n37/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nas the petitioner was working as a teacher, she is entitled to all the benefits that\n\nare available to the regular teachers as per the Rules.\n\n11.5. Assailing the order dated 22.10.2021 passed in WP No. 22221 of\n\n2021, it is contended on behalf of the appellants that minimum qualification to\n\nbe possessed by a Teacher has been laid down by NCTE in exercise of powers\n\nconferred under\nSection 23(1)\nof The Right of Children to Free and\n\nCompulsory Education Act, 2009. The writ petitioner admittedly did not\n\npossess the minimum qualification prescribed by NCTE within five years from\n\nthe date of commencement of the Act in the year 2009. Even the Government\n\nhas passed the order in G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education Department dated\n\n15.11.2011 to the effect that teachers to be recruited in future for the\n\nelementary segment must have passed TET. Therefore, as per the order of the\n\nGovernment, it is mandatory for the writ petitioner to possess TET and she\n\ncannot be permitted to state that her appointment was made prior to the\n\nissuance of the Government Order. Even the five years time limit prescribed\n\nunder\nSection 23 (2)\nhas lapsed but the writ petitioner did not acquire TET\n\nqualification. When the continuance of the writ petitioner in service itself is\n\nillegal, the learned Judge ought not to have issued a Mandamus directing the\n\nappellants herein to confer her all the consequential monetary benefits such as\n\nannual increment etc.\nIn this context, the appellants have relied on the order\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n38/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ndated 24.03.2022 passed by this Court in WP No. 28284 of 2021 etc., in\n\nK. Vasudevan v. The Principal Secretary, School Education Department and\n\nothers\n, wherein it was held that merely because the writ petitioners'\n\nappointment was made prior to the issuance of the Government Order and their\n\nappointments were also ratified by the educational authorities, it will not confer\n\nthem the right to get annual increment etc. Thus, according to the appellants,\n\nwhen the writ petitioner did not possess the requisite mandatory qualification,\n\nshe is not entitled to annual increment and other incentives and hence, the\n\norder of the learned Judge dated 22.10..2021 made in WP.No.22221 of 2021\n\nwill have to be set aside by allowing this appeal.\n\n12. W.A. No. 2050 of 2022\n\n12.1. This appeal arises out of the order dated 29.09.2021 passed by the\n\nlearned Judge in WP No. 20911 of 2021.\n\n12.2. The aforesaid writ petition has been filed praying to issue a Writ of\n\nMandamus directing the appellants to sanction annual increment to the writ\n\npetitioner in the post of B.T. Assistant (Maths) from the year 2018 and also to\n\npay incentive increment for having acquired M.Sc., Mathematics without\n\nreference to passing of TET.\n\n12.3. According to the writ petitioner, he was appointed as B.T. Assistant\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n39/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\non 12.09.2011 and he joined the said post on 12.12.2011 and that, his\n\nappointment was also approved by the educational authorities. It was further\n\nstated that after his appointment as B.T. Assistant, on 12.09.2011, the\n\nGovernment issued G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011 making it mandatory\n\nfor the Secondary Grade Teachers and B.T. Assistant to possess TET. In any\n\nevent, when he was appointed much earlier to the passing of the Government\n\nOrder, the writ petitioner cannot be insisted to pass TET as a condition\n\nprecedent for continuing in service or payment of his annual increment and\n\nother incentives.\n\n12.4. The learned Judge, on consideration of the rival submissions, held\n\nthat\nSection 23\nof the RTE Act makes it clear that a Teacher, who, at the\n\ncommencement of the Act did not possess the minimum qualification, shall\n\nacquire such qualification within five years. However, the consequences of not\n\nobtaining such qualification has neither been prescribed in the Act nor in the\n\nRules or the Government Orders. As long as the writ petitioner continues to\n\nwork as a Teacher, he is entitled for his salary and other incentives.\n\nAccordingly, the learned Judge allowed the writ petition No. 20911 of 2021 on\n\n29.09.2021. Aggrieved by the same, W.A. No. 2050 of 2022 is filed by the\n\nappellants.\n\n12.5. In the grounds of writ appeal, it is stated that the learned Judge did\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n40/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nnot consider the fact that adequate time has been granted to the candidates,\n\nincluding the writ petitioner, to acquire TET qualification. The writ petitioner,\n\nwho joined services on 12.09.2011, did not pass TET till the date of filing the\n\nwrit petition. When a statute prescribes a particular qualification as a minimum\n\nqualification for holding a post, the writ petitioner cannot be given any\n\nexemption from possessing such qualification. In any event, the appointment of\n\nthe writ petitioner or continuance of his service without the mandatory TET\n\nqualification cannot be countenanced. In such circumstances, the learned Judge\n\nought not to have directed the appellants to confer all the monetary benefits\n\npayable to the writ petitioner. Therefore, the appellants sought to allow this\n\nwrit appeal.\n\n13. W.A. No. 2082 of 2022\n\n13.1. This appeal arises out of the order dated 29.09.2021 passed by the\n\nlearned Judge in WP No. 20913 of 2021.\n\n13.2. The aforesaid writ petition has been filed praying to issue a Writ of\n\nMandamus directing the appellants to sanction annual increment to the writ\n\npetitioner in the post of B.T. Assistant (Maths) from the year 2018 and also to\n\npay incentive increment for having acquired M.Sc., Mathematics without\n\nreference to passing of TET.\n\n13.3. According to the writ petitioner, he was appointed as B.T. Assistant\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n41/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\non 08.09.2011 and his appointment was also duly approved by the educational\n\nauthorities on 27.12.2011. However, just prior to his appointment on\n\n08.09.2011, the NCTE has issued the notification dated 27.09.2011, amending\n\nthe earlier notification dated 28.08.2010. As per the notification dated\n\n27.09.2011, passing of TET is considered as one of the eligibilities for\n\nappointment to the post of teacher taking classes from Standards I to VIII. It is\n\nthe stand of the writ petitioner that after his appointment to the post of B.T.\n\nAssistant, the notification dated 27.09.2011 has been issued by NCTE and\n\ntherefore, he is not required to pass TET.\n\n13.4. The learned Judge allowed the writ petition by stating that as long as\n\nthe writ petitioner is in service, he is entitled for all the monetary benefits\n\nattached to the post and he cannot be deprived of the same. Therefore, the\n\nlearned Judge allowed the writ petition and directed the appellants to confer all\n\nthe monetary benefits to the writ petitioner.\n\n13.5. Assailing the order passed by the learned Judge, it is contended on\n\nbehalf of the appellants that adequate time has been granted to the candidates\n\nincluding the writ petitioner, to acquire TET qualification. The writ petitioner\n\nwho joined the service during the year 2011, did not pass TET till the date of\n\nfiling the writ petition. When a statute prescribes a particular qualification as a\n\nminimum qualification for holding a post, the writ petitioner cannot be given\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n42/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nany exemption from possessing such qualification. In any event, the\n\nappointment of the writ petitioner or continuance in service without the\n\nmandatory TET qualification cannot be countenanced. In such circumstances,\n\nthe learned Judge ought not to have directed the appellants to confer all the\n\nmonetary benefits payable to the writ petitioner and hence, prayed for quashing\n\nthe same.\n\n14. W.A. No. 2617 of 2022\n\n14.1. The appellants are aggrieved by the order dated 28.04.2022 passed\n\nby the learned Judge, dismissing their writ petition No. 35487 of 2019.\n\n14.2. The appellants have filed the aforesaid writ petition praying to issue\n\na Writ of Mandamus forbearing the respondents from insisting passing of TET\n\nfor their appointment in the fifth respondent school on 10.12.2010 and\n\n22.01.2011 respectively prior to G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education\n\nDepartment dated 15.11.2011 and consequently direct the respondents to\n\ncontinue to make payment of salary, including other service benefits with\n\nannual increment.\n\n14.3. Before the learned Judge, on behalf of the writ petitioners-appellants,\n\nit was contended that the Government of Tamil Nadu issued G.O. (Ms.)\n\nNo.244, School Education (EE3(2)) Department dated 30.11.2013 in\n\ncompliance with the order passed by the Honourable Supreme Court and\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n43/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ntherefore, they are not required to pass TET as a condition precedent for\n\ncontinuing in the post to which they are appointed. However, the learned Judge\n\nrefused to accept such a plea by holding that the writ petitioners were\n\nappointed in an Aided School, which is receiving aid from the State\n\nGovernment. On the other hand, the order passed by the Honourable Supreme\n\nCourt confers certain protection to the teachers appointed through the TRB in\n\nGovernment Schools. It was further held that TET has become mandatory to be\n\nacquired and the writ petitioners cannot claim exemption on any ground. The\n\nappointment of the writ petitioners as teachers in the fifth respondent school\n\nhas been made on 10.12.2010, 10.12.2010 and 22.01.2011 respectively, after\n\nthe notification dated 23.08.2010 was issued by the NCTE under\nSection 23\n\n(1)\nof the RTE Act. Therefore, the writ petitioners cannot be granted exemption\n\nfrom passing TET and they are equally governed by the mandate contained in\n\nclause 5 (a) of the notification dated 23.08.2010 issued by the NCTE. Further,\n\nthe writ petitioners have not passed the TET till the extended time on\n\n31.03.2019 or on 08.06.2019 and 09.06.2019. Therefore, the learned Judge\n\ndismissed the writ petition filed by the writ petitioners/appellants.\n\n14.4. According to the appellants, they were appointed in accordance with\n\nthe Special Rules which was in force, without reference to TET. The\n\nappointment of the writ petitioners were also approved by the educational\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n44/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nauthority. The appellants have also received salary and other monetary benefits,\n\nas applicable till December 2019. However, the fourth respondent orally\n\nintimated the writ petitioners that they will not be paid the monetary benefits\n\nattached to the post due to non-passing of TET. The notification issued by\n\nNCTE on 11.02.2011 specifically states in Clause 9 that the Government\n\nshould give weightage to the TET scores in the recruitment process, meaning\n\nthereby, passing of TET is mandatory during the selection for recruitment of\n\nthe post and it is not applicable to those who were already appointed, like the\n\nwrit petitioners-appellants. Therefore, the qualification prescribed under\n\nSection 23 (1)\ncannot be put against the writ petitioners who were appointed\n\nmuch prior to the conduct of TET by the nodal agency for the first time in the\n\nState. Even thereafter, the Government issued G.O. Ms. No.90 dated\n\n28.03.2012 changing the policy for recruitment of secondary grade teacher and\n\nGraduate Assistant by stating that \"henceforth the recruitment will be based\n\non written examination in TET in accordance with guidelines framed by\n\nNCTE.\" Thus it is evident that the notification issued by the NCTE as well as\n\nthe Government would indicate that TET cannot be insisted against those\n\ncandidates like the writ petitioners-appellants, who were appointed much prior\n\nto G.O. Ms. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011, G.O. Ms. No.90 dated 28.03.2012 and\n\nprior to conducting TET in the State for the first time. Therefore also, the writ\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n45/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\npetitioners- appellants are not required to pass TET.\n\n14.5. On behalf of the appellants, reference was made to the earlier orders\n\npassed by this Court in WP No. 1126 of 2016 dated 24.01.2017 wherein it was\n\nheld that TET cannot be insisted to those candidates who were appointed much\n\nafter the issuance of G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011. Further, the\n\nHonourable Supreme Court passed an order protecting those teachers\n\nappointed prior to G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011 and therefore, the\n\nlearned Judge ought to have allowed the writ petition filed by the writ\n\npetitioners-appellants.\n\n15. Writ Appeal Nos. 19, 31, 32 and 36 of 2023\n\n15.1. These four appeals are filed by the State, assailing the common order\n\ndated 22.10.2021 passed by the learned Judge in WP Nos.22545, 22550,\n\n22554 and 22556 of 2021 respectively.\n\n15.2. The writ petitions namely WP Nos. 22545, 22550, 22554 and 22556\n\nof 2021 have been filed by The Headmistress and Correspondent of St.\n\nJoseph's Higher Secondary School, Chennai against an order dated 02.09.2021\n\npassed by the District Educational Officer, St. Thomas Mount, Chennai,\n\nrefusing to approve the appointment of the Teachers appointed by the writ\n\npetitioner to the post of B.T. Assistant for non-possessing TET.\n\n15.3. According to the writ petitioner, St. Joseph's Higher Secondary\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n46/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nSchool, Vettuvankeni, Chennai - 600 115, is one among the several schools\n\nfounded and administered by Congregation of the Sisters of St. Anne,\n\nTiruchirapalli. The said school, which is a minority educational institution, was\n\nestablished in the year 1978 and presently it is imparting education to children\n\nfrom Standards VI to XII. It was further stated that there are 31 teachers viz., 1\n\nHeadmistress, 2 Tamil Pandits, 10 BT Assistants, 15 Secondary Grade\n\nTeachers, 2 Physical Education Teachers and 1 Sewing Mistress working in the\n\nschool. The teaching staff working in the school is in accordance with the\n\nstudent strength and staff fixation done during the academic year 2019-2020.\n\nWhile so, due to retirement of the teaching staff, they have appointed four\n\nteaching staff in the sanctioned post and upon their appointment, necessary\n\nproposal was sent for ratification of their appointment. While so, the District\n\nEducational Officer, St. Thomas Mount returned the proposal submitted by the\n\npetitioner School by citing an interim order dated 09.04.2019 passed by the\n\nMadurai Bench of this Court in WA (MD)No. 76 of 2019 etc., batch and also\n\nG.O. Ms. No.165, School Education Department dated 17.09.2019. According\n\nto the writ petitioner, the reliance made to the interim order dated 09.04.2019\n\nis legally not sustainable inasmuch as it has culminated in passing final order\n\ndated 31.03.2021 in WA (MD) No. 76 of 2019 etc., batch upholding the\n\nvalidity of G.O. Ms. No.165, School Education Department dated 17.09.2019\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n47/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nas not operative.\n\n15.4. The learned Judge, upon hearing the counsel for both sides, placing\n\nreliance on the earlier order dated 31.03.2021 in WA (MD) No. 76 of 2019,\n\nallowed the writ petitions filed by the Writ Petitioner School by a common\n\norder dated 22.10.2021. Aggrieved by the same, the present intra-court appeals\n\nare filed.\n\n15.5. The appellants would state that the learned Judge allowed the writ\n\npetitions on the ground that G.O. Ms. No.165, School Education Department\n\ndated 17.09.2019 was ordered to be in-operative by the judgment dated\n\n30.03.2021 in W.A. (MD) No. 76 of 2019 etc. batch. However, the\n\nGovernment has filed Special Leave Petition before the Honourable Supreme\n\nCourt in which an order of interim stay was granted on 14.03.2022. Even\n\notherwise, the teachers appointed by the writ petitioner/School did not possess\n\nTET qualification when they were appointed during the year 2020-2021. When\n\nthe minimum educational qualification prescribed for a teaching faculty is a\n\npass in TET and it is being adopted at the national level, the writ petitioner\n\ncannot seek to dispense with such mandatory qualification to be possessed by\n\nthe teaching faculty. It is in those circumstances, the District Educational\n\nOfficer, St. Thomas Mount has rightly returned the proposals sent by the writ\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n48/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\npetitioner School for approval of appointment of their teacher.\n\n15.6. The appellants would further state that this Court, in the order dated\n\n07.04.2022 made in WP No. 28284 of 2021 referred to the decision of\n\nHonourable Supreme Court in\nUnaided Private School of Rajasthan v. Union\n\nof India\n[2012 (6) Supreme Court Cases 1] wherein it was held that the\n\nRights of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009\nis\n\nconstitutionally valid.\nThe Act\nis applicable to the writ petitioner school and the\n\nappointment of the teachers without the mandatory TET qualification cannot be\n\nratified by the educational authorities. Therefore, the appellants would pray for\n\nsetting aside the common order dated 22.10.2021 passed by the learned Judge\n\nin the writ petitions.\n\nII. SUBMISSIONS OF COUNSELS\n\n16.1. Mrs. Nalini Chidambaram, learned Senior counsel appearing for the\n\nappellants in W.A. No. 2795 of 2022 submitted that the appellants were\n\nappointed as Secondary Grade Teachers on various dates between the years\n\n1991 and 2011. Their appointment is governed by the Tamil Nadu Educational\n\nSubordinate Service. While so, after two decades of the appointment of the\n\nappellants, on 26.08.2009, Parliament has passed the\nRight of Children to Free\n\nand Compulsory Education Act, 2009\n(Act 35 of 2009) to provide for free and\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n49/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ncompulsory education to all children of the age 6 to 14 year.\nThe Act\nreceived\n\nthe assent of the President on 26.08.2009. Thereafter, on 23.08.2010, in\n\nexercise of powers conferred under\nSection 23(1)\nof the RTE Act, the NCTE\n\nissued a notification dated 23.08.2010 prescribing minimum educational\n\nqualification for appointment of teacher to impart classes to students studying\n\nin Classes I to VIII. However, even as per the NCTE Regulations which was in\n\nforce in the year 2001, TET was not mandatory.\n\n16.2. In line with the enactment of the\nRTE Act\n, the Government of Tamil\n\nNadu issued G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education Department dated\n\n15.11.2011 making TET mandatory for appointment of teacher. It is in those\n\ncircumstances, when Civil Appeal Nos. 6186 to 6187 of 2008 were taken up\n\nfor hearing by the Honourable Supreme Court on 05.09.2013, it was held that\n\n\"the Teachers who were appointed prior to G.O. dated 15.11.2011 will remain\n\nprotected\". Thus, all the teachers appointed prior to 15.11.2011 are protected\n\nand their services shall not be terminated for not passing TET as per the order\n\npassed by the Honourable Supreme Court.\n\n16.3. Notwithstanding the above position, the Directorate of School\n\nEducation issued a notification dated 01.10.2014 stating that TET is\n\ncompulsory for all the teachers in service and directed that within five years of\n\ntheir appointment as BT Assistant, they should pass TET. According to the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n50/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nlearned Senior counsel for the appellants, TET can be insisted to those who are\n\ndirectly recruited to a teaching post and it cannot be insisted on the appellants\n\nwho have been appointed between 1991 to 2011 and had completed two\n\ndecades of service. While so, the observation made by the learned Judge in the\n\norder dated 20.10.2022, which is impugned in Writ Appeal No. 2795 of 2022\n\nthat the teachers who do not possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET\n\nare not entitled to continue in service in the schools/educational institutions is\n\nlegally not sustainable.\n\n16.4. The learned Senior counsel for the appellants further referred to the\n\norder dated 05.09.2013 passed by the Honourable Supreme Court in Civil\n\nAppeal Nos.6186 and 6187 of 2008 (State of Tamil Nadu and another v.\n\nUnemployed Sec. Grade Teach. Welfare Association and others) wherein it\n\nwas held as follows:\n\n\"That the teachers who were appointed prior to the G.O. dated 15.11.2011\nwill remain protected and as far as the transfers sought by the teachers\noutside their Districts are concerned, it is for them to apply to the authority\nconcerned and the authority concerned will consider their applications in\naccordance with law.\n\n16.5. According to the learned Senior counsel, in the light of the above\n\nobservations made by the Honourable Supreme Court, the Teachers, who did\n\nnot pass TET and who were appointed prior to 15.11.2011 are protected and\n\nthat, insisting them to pass TET as a condition precedent for conferring\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n51/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\npromotion to higher post is unjustified.\n\n16.6. The learned Senior counsel also placed reliance on the decision of the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in The Secretary to Government, Government of\n\nTamil Nadu, Education Department, Fort St. George and others v. S.\n\nJeyalakshmi and others [(2016) 4 Law Weekly 841] wherein it was\n\ncategorically held in para No.55 that when once a person is appointed as\n\nteacher after being found eligible as on the date of his or her appointment, he\n\ncannot be expected to write an examination and to qualify himself in such\n\nexamination at a later point of time. The Division Bench also directed the\n\nGovernment to seek necessary clarification from the NCTE in the light of such\n\nobservation made inter alia as to whether the prescription of minimum\n\nqualification of TET can be made applicable prospectively for the Teachers who\n\nwere appointed subsequent to the date of the issue of Government Order in\n\nboth non-minority and minority institutions so as to benefit the Teachers who\n\nhave been serving for quite a long time. This observation of the Division Bench\n\nof this Court would make it very clear that insisting TET for those who were\n\nappointed long back, prior to the advent of\nRTE Act\nor to deny them the\n\nlegitimate promotion, is uncalled for.\n\n16.7. The learned Senior counsel for the appellant further relied on the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n52/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\norder dated 08.03.2019 passed by one of us (R. Mahadevan, J) in WP (MD)\n\nNos. 5626 to 5630 of 2017 etc., batch, wherein it was held that the cut off date\n\nfor acquiring the TET qualification is 27.09.2011 and the teachers who were\n\nappointed prior to that date need not pass TET. Even in the case of teachers\n\nwho were appointed after that date, if the advertisement to initiate the process\n\nof appointment of teachers was made prior to that date, then their\n\nappointments can also be in accordance with NCTE Regulations, 2001 and\n\nthey need not acquire the TET qualification. Thus, the learned senior counsel\n\nsought to quash the order of the learned Judge by allowing this writ appeal.\n\n17.1. Ms. N. Kavitha Rameshwar, learned counsel appearing for the TET\n\npassed Candidates Welfare Association/Petitioners in WP Nos. 3364 and 3368\n\nof 2023, as also the impleaded respondents in W.A.No. 2795 of 2022, would\n\ncontend that a BT Assistant or a Graduate Teacher could be appointed either by\n\ndirect recruitment or by transfer or by promotion. Adding further, the learned\n\ncounsel submitted that the necessary qualification for the post of BT Assistant\n\nis an Under graduation and B.Ed. degree and a pass in TET. The Tamilnadu\n\ngovernment has now framed Special Rules for Tamilnadu Elementary\n\nEducational Subordinate Service vide GO.Ms.No. 12 School Education (EE(1))\n\nDepartment dated 30.01.2020 and Special Rules for the Tamilnadu School\n\nEducational Subordinate Service vide GO Ms. No.13 School Education\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n53/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n(S.E3(1)) Department dated 30.01.2020. The said Rules while prescribing\n\nqualifications for Graduate Teacher (BT Assistant) in its Annexure I (as\n\nreferred to in Rule 6) of the Special Rules specifies “a pass in TET” only for\n\ndirect recruitment. However, the mode of appointment to the said post of BT\n\nAssistant/ Graduate Teacher is mentioned as transfer, promotion or direct\n\nrecruitment. This would mean that for transfer and promotion, the Government\n\nis open to promoting Secondary Grade Teachers without TET qualification as\n\nBT Assistants. The same is against the\nRTE Act\nand the Rules framed\n\nthereunder and the notifications issued by the respondents 2 and 3 from time to\n\ntime apart from being unconstitutional.\n\n17.2. The learned counsel also submitted that as the NCTE Notifications\n\nprescribing the qualifications did not mention or make any distinction in the\n\nqualifications on the basis of the mode/channel of appointment, the State\n\nGovernment cannot make such an artificial distinction and that, it would be\n\nbeyond the competence of the State Legislature to do the same as the field is\n\nalready occupied by Parliamentary legislation under Entry 66 of the Union\n\nList. In this context, the learned counsel contended that when once the field is\n\noccupied by Parliamentary legislation and the subject relates to an entry falling\n\nwithin the exclusive domain of the Parliament under the Union List, the State\n\nLegislature has intended to legislate on a subject in respect of which it has no\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n54/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nlegislative competence, and thus the doctrine of colorable legislation is\n\nattracted to the present case. The learned counsel relied on the Constitution\n\nBench judgment of the Supreme Court in\nK.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo and\n\nOrs. v. State of Orissa\n[(1954) 1 SCR 1], to substantiate her argument that\n\nonce a legislature does not have competence to enact law on a particular\n\nsubject, it cannot do indirectly what cannot be done directly. She further\n\nsubmitted that the impugned Rules are illegal and ultravires the\nRTE Act\nand\n\nthe Rules framed thereunder and also the notifications dated 23.08.2010 &\n\n29.07.2011, issued by the NCTE which prescribe TET as a mandatory\n\neligibility criteria for the post of BT Assistant and that, the impugned\n\nprovisions while prescribing the mode of appointment to the post of Graduate\n\nTeacher as either by transfer, promotion or by direct recruitment, cannot\n\nrestrict TET as an essential eligibility criteria only for direct recruitment, when\n\nthe NCTE notifications issued under the\nRTE Act\nmake TET mandatory for\n\nappointment to the post of BT Assistant/Graduate Teacher.\n\n17.3. The learned counsel would further contend that the impugned Rules\n\nare a colourable exercise of legislative power to the extent that it prescribes “a\n\npass in Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)” only for direct recruitment for the post\n\nof BT Assistant and not for promotion thereto in Annexure-I (referred to in\n\nRule 6) as the same ultravires the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n55/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nEducation Act\n2009 and the Rules framed thereunder and the NCTE\n\nNotification dated 23.08.2010 & 29.07.2011, and hence violative of\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\nSection 23\nof the RTE Act makes it\n\nmandatory that the minimum qualification prescribed by the academic\n\nauthority is necessary for being appointed as teacher to teach classes 1 to 8. A\n\ngraduate Teacher to teach classes 6 to 8 must also possess the necessary\n\nqualification prescribed by the academic authority. The NCTE, the academic\n\nauthority had prescribed TET as minimum qualification for being appointed as\n\nteacher. The impugned provisions are directly contrary to the above legal\n\nprovisions and hence, liable to be declared as illegal.\n\n17.4. The learned counsel also placed reliance on the NCTE Regulations\n\n2001 to buttress her case that even earlier the NCTE has intended to follow the\n\nqualifications for the respective posts in cases where there is movement from a\n\nlower to a higher or next level post in cases of already appointed persons.\n\nFurther, a perusal of the Rules made by various States on the basis of the\n\nNCTE Notifications prescribing qualifications, including a pass in TET, would\n\nshow that the said qualifications have been applied to both direct recruitment\n\nas well as to promotion to the post of BT Assistants. Also, the Order in Special\n\nAppeal No.737/2018, (Allahabad High Court) dated 04.09.2018 has been\n\npressed in to service by the learned counsel to contend that the very same\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n56/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nquestion arose before the Allahabad High Court and the Court has affirmed\n\nthat the qualifications prescribed by the NCTE including a pass in TET apply\n\nto all appointments made after the cutoff date, i.e. 29.07.2011, including to\n\npromotion to BT Assistant/Graduate Teacher.\n\n17.5. The learned counsel submitted that the impugned Rules would create\n\na situation where those appointed by direct recruitment to the post of BT\n\nAssistant would be TET qualified while those appointed through promotion\n\nwould be unqualified in respect of TET, thereby defeating the provisions of the\n\nRTE Act\nthat seeks to uniformly increase the standard of teaching and\n\neducation while ensuring the right to education under\nArticle 21-A\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n17.6. Lastly, the learned counsel would contend that though all the\n\nmembers of the petitioner Association aspire for direct recruitment and the\n\nRules contemplate 50 percent of appointments to BT Assistant through direct\n\nrecruitment and 48 percent through promotion and the remaining 2 per cent by\n\ntransfer from among categories mentioned therein, the writ petitioners and\n\nothers are aggrieved by the impugned Rules on account of the fact that while\n\nthe Government has not made any direct recruitment for a decade, it keeps\n\nfilling up all vacant positions of BT/Graduate Assistants through promotion\n\nfrom among candidates not possessing a pass in TET and that, the Government\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n57/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nhas not maintained the requisite quota for direct recruits, thereby meaning that\n\nunqualified candidates are being promoted while qualified candidates are\n\nwaiting in the queue endlessly without employment and thus, the challenge is\n\nto the Rules relating to promotion.\n\n17.7. That apart, Ms. Kavitha Rameshwar, learned counsel for the writ\n\npetitioners, placed reliance on several judgments with regard to the issue\n\nrelating to the maintainability of the writ petition filed by a registered\n\nAssociation. It is her contention that the Association represents the unemployed\n\nteachers who are eligible and qualified and cannot be expected to individually\n\nknock the doors of the Court as they suffer from financial disability and the\n\nnature of their grievances are the same.\n\n18.1. Mr. Silambannan, learned Additional Advocate General appearing for\n\nthe State would contend that after the advent of\nRTE Act\nand appointment of\n\nTRB as nodal agency to conduct TET in the State, the teachers were required to\n\npass the examination conducted by TRB within five years from 01.04.2010 to\n\n31.03.2015. However, the deadline to pass the TET has been extended until\n\n31.03.2019. Thus, nine years’ time was given to the teachers to acquire the\n\nqualification, but several teachers have not acquired the TET qualification. He\n\nwould also submit that without such qualification, appointments were made in\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n58/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nGovernment Aided Schools and therefore, the educational agency did not\n\napprove their appointment. But, those teachers whose appointments have not\n\nbeen approved or who were not paid the monetary benefits such as annual\n\nincrement etc., have approached this Court with various writ petitions and\n\nobtained orders in their favour.\n\n18.2. According to the learned Additional Advocate General, the State\n\nGovernment scrupulously adheres to the provisions of\nRTE Act\nand insists the\n\nteaching faculty to pass TET as mandated under the\nRTE Act\n. So far as the\n\nGovernment Schools are concerned, only the TET passed teachers are\n\nappointed through TRB after the coming into force of the\nRTE Act\n. At the same\n\ntime, the learned Additional Advocate General made reference to clauses 4 and\n\n5 of the notification dated 23.08.2010 issued by NCTE stating that those\n\nteachers appointed on or after 3rd September 2001 i.e., the date on which the\n\nNCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualification for Recruitment of Teachers\n\nin Schools) Regulations, 2001 (as amended from time to time) came into force\n\nin accordance with that Regulation.\n\n18.3. The learned Additional Advocate General further submitted that\n\npromotion to the teachers in Government Schools is governed by the relevant\n\nService Rules namely Tamil Nadu School Education Subordinate Service Rules\n\nor Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary Educational Service Rules. In none of the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n59/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\naforesaid Rules it was prescribed that passing of TET for promotion of teachers\n\nto other categories is mandatory. Therefore, the teachers appointed before\n\n01.04.2010 were exempted from passing TET. At the same time, those who are\n\nrecruited directly to the post of B.T. Assistant after the said date must have\n\npassed TET. It is further submitted by the learned Additional Advocate General\n\nthat whenever a new legislation or rule is introduced, it will only have\n\nprospective effect unless otherwise specifically notified that it will come into\n\nforce from a particular date. In the present case, the\nRTE Act\nwas enacted on\n\nand from 01.04.2010. Therefore, the teachers appointed much prior to the\n\ncoming into force of the said Act are not required to clear TET and they are\n\nexempted from passing the TET.\n\n18.4. With respect to promotion, it is submitted by the learned Additional\n\nAdvocate General that once a teacher has been directly recruited under the\n\ngoverning Service Rules, his or her promotion or career prospects have to be\n\ndecided only based on the Rules which were in force on the date of his or her\n\nappointment. As such, those who were appointed much prior to the coming\n\ninto force of the Act are exempted from passing TET and consequently, they\n\nare entitled for further promotion based on their seniority and merits.\n\n19.1. Mr. G. Sankaran, learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellants\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n60/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nin W.A. No. 2617 of 2022 submitted that the appellants were appointed on\n\n10.12.2010, 10.12.2010 and 22.01.2011 in the fifth respondent school. They\n\nwere appointed in the vacancies that arose on 01.06.2009 due to retirement of\n\nteachers. The fifth respondent school, upon obtaining permission during\n\nSeptember 2010 and on 28.12.2010 respectively appointed the appellants. The\n\nappointment of the appellants were also approved by the educational\n\nauthorities on 24.02.2011. Thus, the appellants were appointed in accordance\n\nwith the Special Rules without reference to TET. In the orders of appointment\n\nissued to the appellants, there was no pre-condition imposed to pass TET.\n\nWhile so, in the year 2019, the appellants were orally informed that they will\n\nnot be eligible for payment of annual increment etc., for not passing TET.\n\n19.2. The learned Senior counsel for the appellants invited the attention of\n\nthis Court to the notifications dated 23.08.2010 and 11.02.2011 issued by\n\nNCTE and submitted that the directions contained therein can be made\n\napplicable only to the appointments to be made and not to those who were\n\nalready appointed. He had drawn the attention of this Court to clause 9 of the\n\nnotification dated 11.02.2011 of the NCTE wherein it was stated that the\n\nGovernment should give weightage to the TET scores in the recruitment\n\nprocess, meaning thereby, TET can be insisted only to those who are newly\n\nrecruited or appointed. Even the State Government in G.O. Ms. No. 90, School\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n61/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nEducation Department dated 28.03.2012 has directed that \"henceforth, the\n\nrecruitment will be based on written examination, namely TET in accordance\n\nwith the guidelines issued by NCTE.\" The words \"henceforth\" employed in\n\nG.O. (Ms) No. 90, dated 28.03.2012 will make it amply clear that TET can be\n\ninsisted only for the appointments to be made by resorting to a recruitment\n\nprocess and not to those who were already recruited and are in service.\n\nHowever, the learned Judge had concluded that the appointment of the\n\nappellants is after 23.08.2010, the date on which the NCTE issued the\n\nnotification prescribing minimum educational qualification to be possessed by\n\nthe Teachers in Classes I to VIII. The learned Judge further held that the\n\nprocess of appointment was initiated after 23.08.2010 and therefore, the\n\nappellants will not fall under the exempted category of cases. However, the\n\nlearned Judge did not take note of the fact that as on 23.08.2010, the TRB has\n\nnot conducted any TET examination and there are no qualified person available\n\nwith TET qualification to be appointed as Teacher. While so, the learned Senior\n\ncounsel submits that the appellants will come under the exempted category and\n\nconsequently, passing of TET cannot be insisted against them.\n\n19.3.\nIn support of his contention, the learned Senior counsel invited the\n\nattention of this Court to the decision of this Court dated 30.07.2020 passed in\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n62/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nWP (MD) No. 8313 of 2020 etc., in the case of\nD.Raja Malar v. State of\n\nTamil Nadu and others\n, where, in similar circumstances, this Court held as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"15.Therefore, it has become quite clear that the appointment of the\npetitioners as on 17.09.2010, 20.06.2011 and 20.06.2011 having been\napproved by the third respondent through the said approval order, the\napplicability of the prescription made by NCTE to have such qualification,\ninsofar as the petitioners are concerned, cannot be made or applied.\nTherefore, the said reason cited in the impugned order by the third\nrespondent, in the considered opinion of this Court, may not hold good.\nTherefore, on that reason, the petitioners service benefit like annual\nincrement cannot be denied.\n\n16.Moreover, once the appointments are approved by the authority and the\nsame still holds good, the petitioners have been brought under regular time\nscale of pay. When that being the position, the annual increment is part and\nparcel of the time scale of pay system being adopted for government\nemployees/Teachers of the Government is concerned and when such is the\nposition, the third respondent cannot insist upon any Government Order,\nwhich cannot be created by the petitioners.\n\n17.Moreover, if at all any such request is made by the petitioners for annual\nincrement, that should have been decided by the respondents by taking into\naccount the relevant Rule position, Service Law and the Government Order,\nif any available with the respondents, instead, off late, it has become a\npractice that some of the officials/authorities would raise a question that, in\norder to get the benefit sought for by the employees/Teacher/incumbent,\nwhether any Government Order is available in their favour.\n\n19.4. The learned Senior counsel also placed reliance on the order dated\n\n29.09.2021 passed in WP No. 20911 of 2021 as well as the order dated\n\n20.12.2021 passed in WP No. 25138 of 2021, wherein this Court issued a\n\nMandamus directing the respondents therein to continue to pay the annual\n\nincrement and other monetary benefits to the petitioners therein without\n\ninsisting TET.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n63/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n19.5. The learned Senior counsel for the appellants further relied on the\n\norder passed by the Madurai bench of this Court in WP (MD) Nos. 5626 to\n\n5630 of 2017 etc., batch. According to the learned Senior counsel, the common\n\nprayer sought for in those writ petitions is to issue a Writ of Mandamus to\n\nforbear the official respondents from insisting the writ petitioners to pass TET\n\nfor continuing their service as B.T. Assistant in the respondents schools. All the\n\nwrit petitioners in those cases were admittedly appointed before issuance of\n\nnotification and their appointments were also approved by the Educational\n\nAuthorities. While so, it was contended on their behalf that when their\n\nappointment is proper, they cannot be compelled to write TET as a condition\n\nprecedent for continuing in their service. This Court, upon examining the fact\n\nas to whether the writ petitioners, who were appointed before the cutoff date\n\nare entitled to get exemption from passing TET, after an in-depth analysis of\n\nthe same, held that the writ petitioners are entitled to seek exemption from\n\npassing TET, as they were appointed prior to the cutoff date and the\n\nrespondents were directed not to insist TET certificate from the writ petitioners\n\nas a condition precedent for their continuance in service as B.T. Assistants.\n\n19.6. Reliance was also placed on the decision of the Division Bench of\n\nthis Court in\nThe Secretary to Government, Government of Tamil Nadu,\n\nEducation Department and others v. S. Jeyalakshmi and another\n[2016 (4)\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n64/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nLaw Weekly 841]. In that case, this Court had an occasion to consider as to\n\nwhether the teachers, who were appointed prior to the Government Order\n\nintroducing TET as a condition, are required to acquire TET qualification\n\nwithin a period of five years so as to continue in their service. The Division\n\nBench of this Court, in Para Nos. 55 to 58 held as follows:\n\n\"55. A reading of the qualifications extracted above would clearly show that\nthe B.T. Assistants are being appointed only if they are qualified and\npossessed with Teachers Training Certificate. As per G.O. Ms. No.181\ndated 18.11.2011, Secondary Grade Teachers are being appointed only if\nthey are qualified and possessed with Diploma in Teachers Education. Thus,\nit is evident that the persons who underwent either Teachers Training course\nor Diploma in Teachers Education alone are eligible for appointment either\nas B.T. Assistants or Secondary Grade Teachers as the case may be.\nTherefore, there cannot be an iota of doubt as to their eligibility for\nappointment as Teachers. Once they are appointed as Teachers after having\nbeen found eligible as on the said date of their appointment, they cannot be\nexpected to write an examination and to qualify in such examination at a\nmuch later point of time.\n\n56. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the Government may seek\na clarification from the NCTE, in the light of what is stated in the preceding\nparagraph, whether the prescription of minimum qualification of TET can\nbe made applicable prospectively for the Teachers who were appointed\nsubsequent to the date of the issue of G.O., in both non-minority and\nminority institutions and not retrospectively as the same would cause undue\nhardship to the Teachers who have been serving for a quite a long time.\n\n57. In case of NCTE clarifying that G.O. can be given prospective effect, the\nGovernment, in its wisdom, may think of conducting refresher course for the\nTeachers who were appointed prior to the issue of G.O., during the annual\nvacation, instead of insisting for qualifying in TET, since the Teachers have\nalready undergone either Teachers Training Course or Diploma in Teachers\nEducation, as the case may be, as per the\nEducation Act\nof the State.\nMoreover, we are of the opinion that asking the Teachers who have been\nappointed after having found eligible and working for quite a long time, to\nundergo TET examination and to pass the same at this stage, would be\nnothing but imposing upon them a task, which they have already achieved\nby passing the requisite tests for getting appointed. Further, an uncertainty\nalso would get created in the minds of the Teachers that lest they pass the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n65/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nTET examination, their career would be hanging in balance as the\nDamocles Sword. Keeping the above in mind, the Government may, in\nconsultation with NCTE, formulate a scheme for conducting refresher\ncourse for those Teachers who were appointed prior to the issue of G.O., as\nthis would set at rest the uncertainty that would otherwise get created in the\nminds of the persons already in employment.\n\n58. In our opinion, non qualifying in TET by the Teachers already in service\nshould not defeat the object of the Government to provide quality and\nstandard education and therefore, the Government may, in the alternative,\nconduct a refresher course and also some interactive sessions during\nannual vacation, in order to ensure and enhance the quality of education.\"\n\n19.7. By placing reliance on the aforesaid decision, the learned Senior\n\ncounsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants are governed by the\n\nconditions imposed or the Rule prevailing as on the date of their appointment\n\nand hence, they cannot be compelled to pass TET which was introduced much\n\nafter their appointment. With these submissions, the learned Senior counsel\n\nprayed for allowing this appeal.\n\n20. Mr. V. Ashok Kumar, learned Central Government Counsel\n\nappearing for the first respondent in WP Nos. 3364 and 3368 of 2023 would\n\nsubmit that the\nRight of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009\n\n(Amendment Act, 2012\n) which represents the consequential legislation\n\nenvisaged under\nArticle 21-A\nof the Constitution of India came into force on\n\n01.04.2010. Subsequently, the Central Government formulated the Central\n\nRTE Rules, 2010 which could be adopted by the Union Territories not having\n\nthe legislative Assembly. The Government of India also formulated the model\n\nRTE Rules, which were to be adopted by the concerned State based on the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n66/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nground realities prevailing in the particular State.\nSection 23\nof the RTE Act,\n\nprescribes the qualification for appointment and the terms and conditions of\n\nservice of teachers.\nSection 23 (2)\nconfers relaxation for teachers who were\n\nappointed or in position as on 31st March 2015, which means that this clause\n\napplies on those teachers who are in-service as on 31st March 2015. Further,\n\nas per\nSection 23 (2)\n, the relaxation can be given only in academic\n\nqualifications in a case where a State does not have adequate institutions\n\noffering course or training in Teachers Education. Even such relaxation can be\n\nconferred till 31st March 2019 and not thereafter. He would further submit that\n\nTET is mandated by NCTE and therefore, the question of relaxation in TET is\n\nnot covered under the above mentioned sections of the\nRTE Act\n. The Central\n\nGovernment has authorised the NCTE to lay down certain minimum\n\nqualification to be possessed by a person to become eligible for appointment of\n\na teacher. Accordingly, the NCTE issued a notification dated 23.08.2010 and\n\none of the essential qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as\n\na teacher is that he or she should pass TET which will be conducted by the\n\nappropriate Government. In effect, the learned Central Government Counsel\n\nsubmitted that the recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers\n\nare primarily in the domain of respective State Governments and Union\n\nTerritory Administrations. As per the\nRTE Act\n, it is for the appropriate\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n67/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nGovernment to take a decision on employment of teachers in accordance with\n\nthe provisions of the\nRTE Act, 2017\n.\n\n21. Mr. Karthikeyan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in\n\nCMP Nos. 6050 and 6349 of 2023, which were filed to implead themselves as\n\nparty respondents in W.A. No. 2795 of 2022, would contend that the\n\npetitioners were appointed as Teachers during 1995 to 2001 on various dates\n\nand they cannot be brought within the fold of TET. The petitioners are working\n\nas such for more than 25 years and are waiting for their legitimate promotion\n\nto the post of B.T. Assistant. However, by citing the non-passing of TET, they\n\nare deprived of their legitimate promotion, which is unjustified. The provisions\n\ncontained under the\nRTE Act\nor the notifications issued by NCTE prescribing\n\nminimum educational qualification vis-a-vis a pass in TET cannot be put\n\nagainst the petitioners to deny them their legitimate promotion. He placed\n\nreliance on the order passed by the Government in G.O. Ms. No.171, School\n\nEducation Department dated 18.08.2008 and contends that if the petitioners\n\nare given promotion from the post of Secondary Grade Teacher to B.T.\n\nAssistant, the post which they have held (Secondary Grade Teacher) will\n\nautomatically be converted as B.T. Assistant in which event no one will be\n\nprejudiced. The learned counsel therefore prayed for allowing the impleading\n\npetitions and to direct the Government to conduct the promotion counselling to\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n68/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nthe petitioners to the post of B.T. Assistant without insisting TET.\n\n22. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for all the parties at\n\nlength and also perused the materials placed on record.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION & FINDINGS\n\nA. W.A. No. 2795/2022 & W.P. Nos. 3364 and 3368/2023\n\n23. The writ appeal arises out of the order of the Learned Judge wherein\n\nit has been held that the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) shall be an essential\n\neligibility criteria for those aspiring to be promoted as Graduate Teachers/ BT\n\nAssistants from the post of Secondary Grade Teachers. Apart from the various\n\nsubmissions made by the appellants, who were the writ petitioners originally,\n\nseeking promotion to the post of BT Assistant from the post of Secondary\n\nGrade teacher without insistence on TET, it is pertinent to mention that under\n\nthe Special Rules for the Tamil Nadu School Educational Subordinate Service\n\nissued vide GO. Ms. No. 13 School Education [S.E.3 (1)] dated 30.01.2020, it\n\nhas been stipulated that for the post of Graduate Teacher/ B.T. Assistant, a pass\n\nin Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is mandatory only for direct recruitment as\n\nmentioned in Annexure I to the Special Rules, as referred to in Rule 6 of the\n\nsaid Rules. The said Rules have been made by the State Government under\n\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n69/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n24. It is also pertinent to mention that while heavy reliance has been\n\nplaced by the appellants on the said Rules which lends assistance to the sheet\n\nanchor of their case that TET as an eligibility criteria is required to be fulfilled\n\nonly in the case of direct recruitment to the post of BT Assistant, the Learned\n\nJudge has, even in the face of the said Special Rules, adopted the view that it is\n\nmandatory even for promotion to the post of BT Assistant from the category of\n\nsecondary grade teacher after the coming into force of the\nRTE Act, 2009\nand\n\nthe NCTE notifications issued pursuant thereto. In the light of the operation of\n\nthe Special Rules as stated above, stating that a pass in TET is required only\n\nfor direct recruitment to the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant, the natural\n\noutcome should be that in the absence of a challenge to the Rules, the position\n\nstated in the Rules would have to be applied. However, while the said Rules\n\nhad not been subject to challenge before the Learned Judge, the said Rules\n\nhave now been challenged by way of two writ petitions and therefore, the moot\n\nquestion would now be on the validity or otherwise of the said Special Rules.\n\nThe entire issue therefore now narrows down to the validity or otherwise of the\n\nsaid Special Rules which have now been challenged before us. Once we\n\npronounce upon the validity of the said rules, all the issues including the\n\ncorrectness of the order passed by the Learned Judge in the present writ\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n70/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nappeal, would stand settled.\n\n25. The essential question therefore relates to the determination of the\n\nvalidity of the Special Rules (hereinafter referred to as “the impugned Rules”)\n\nby which it has been prescribed that for the post of Graduate Teacher/BT\n\nAssistant, a pass in Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is mandatory for direct\n\nrecruitment alone. Two writ petitions have been filed challenging the vires of\n\nthe said Rules, one of them being by a registered Association that espouses the\n\ncause of all candidates who have passed TET, and the other petition by an\n\nindividual who is an aspirant for the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant, by\n\ndirect recruitment.\n\nTHE RTE ACT, 2009 & THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON TET AS AN\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\n\n26.\nThe Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009\n\nwas passed with the avowed objective of ensuring free and compulsory\n\neducation to all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years, pursuant to\nArticle\n\n21-A\ninserted by the Constitution (86th amendment) 2002 which provides for\n\nfree and compulsory education of all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years\n\nas a fundamental right.\nThe RTE Act\nalso aimed at raising the standard of\n\neducation, and came into force on 01.04.2010.\nUnder the Act\n, the term ‘school’\n\nis defined as follows:\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n71/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n“2(n) “School” means any recognized school imparting elementary\neducation and includes –\n\n(i)a school established, owned or controlled by the appropriate\nGovernment or a local authority;\n\n(ii)an aided school receiving aid or grants to meet whole or part of its\nexpenses from the appropriate Government or the local authority;\n\n(iii)a school belonging to specified category; and (iv) an unaided school\nnot receiving any kind of aid or grants to meet its expenses from the\nappropriate Government or the local authority.”\n\n27. At the commencement of the Act, under\nSection 23\nof the Act, it has\n\nbeen stated as follows:\n\n“23. Qualifications for appointment and terms and conditions of service\nof teachers.—\n(1) Any person possessing such minimum qualifications, as\nlaid down by\n\nan academic authority, authorised by the Central Government, by\nnotification, shall be eligible for appointment as a teacher.\n(2) Where a State does not have adequate institutions offering courses or\ntraining in teacher education, or teachers possessing minimum\nqualifications as laid down under sub-section (1) are not available in\nsufficient numbers, the Central Government may, if it deems necessary, by\nnotification, relax the minimum qualifications required for appointment\nas a teacher, for such period, not exceeding five years, as may be\nspecified in that notification:\n\nProvided that a teacher who, at the commencement of this Act, does not\npossess minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-section (1), shall\nacquire such minimum qualifications within a period of five years.”\n\n28. Thereafter, by Notification dated 31.03.2010, the 1st respondent\n\nappointed the 2nd respondent NCTE as the academic authority to lay down the\n\nminimum qualifications for a person to be eligible to be appointed as a teacher.\n\nOn 08.10.2010, the 1st respondent by virtue of powers conferred under\nSection\nof the Act, framed Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education\n\nRules 2010. Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the National Council\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n72/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nTeacher Education (NCTE) issued a notification dated 23.08.2010 prescribing\n\nthe minimum qualifications for teachers from Classes I to V- ‘Secondary Grade\n\nTeachers’ as well as for Classes VI to VIII- ‘BT Assistant’. Apart from\n\nprescribing the minimum educational qualifications, the important eligibility\n\ncriteria added by way of the notification is – “Pass in Teacher Eligibility Test\n\n(TET)”. This notification stated under paragraph 4 that teachers appointed\n\nprior to the date of this notification need not acquire the minimum qualification\n\nprescribed by the notifications. Under para 5 it has been stated that those\n\nteachers appointed after date of this notification, but in whose case the process\n\nof appointment was initiated prior to the date of this notification would also be\n\nexempt from acquiring the minimum qualifications including Teacher Eligibility\n\nTest (TET) as prescribed under Para 1 of the notification. The said Para 5 of\n\nthe notification dated 23.08.2010 came to be amended by the notification of\n\nthe NCTE dated 29.07.2011 whereby Para 5 was substituted by Para 5(a) with\n\nthe same provision while shifting the cut off date from 23.08.2010 to\n\n29.07.2011, meaning thereby that where the Government, Local Authority or\n\nSchool issued the advertisement to initiate the process of appointment prior to\n\nthe date of this notification i.e., 29.07.2011, such appointments may also be\n\nmade in accordance with the NCTE Regulations 2001 i.e., exempting them\n\nfrom acquiring TET for appointment as the teacher. The NCTE Notification\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n73/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ndated 11.02.2011 issued guidelines relating to conduct of TET. In Para 3 of the\n\nsaid Guidelines (though subsequently amended in notification dated\n\n29.07.2011 and the reason for same is not understood), the rationale for\n\nincluding the TET as minimum qualification can be seen, and the same is\n\nreproduced:\n\n“3. The rationale for including the TET as a minimum qualification for a\nperson to be eligible to be appointed as a teacher is as under:\n\n(i) It would bring national standards and benchmark of teacher quality in the\nrecruitment process;\n\n(ii) It would induce teacher education institutions and students from these\ninstitutions to further improve their performance standards;\n\n(iii) It would send a positive signal to all stakeholders that the Government lays\nspecial emphasis on teacher quality.”\n\n29. Thereafter, the State Government framed the Tamil Nadu Right of\n\nChildren to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011 vide GO. Ms. No.\n\n173 dated 08.11.2011. The State Government issued GO.Ms.No. 181 dated\n\n15.11.2011, appointing Teachers Recruitment Board (hereinafter called ‘TRB’)\n\nas the nodal agency to conduct TET exams. The said GO makes it very clear in\n\ncategorical terms that passing of TET is mandatory for all Secondary Grade\n\nTeachers and BT Assistants in Tamil Nadu.\n\nMAINTAINABLITY OF THE WRIT PETITIONS IMPUGNING THE\n\nSPECIAL RULES\n\n30. At the outset, as an objection has been raised to the maintainability\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n74/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nof the writ petition by an Association, it is only appropriate that we deal with\n\nthe said issue first. The issue whether a writ petition is maintainable at the\n\ninstance of an Association is now no longer res integra and the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has made authoritative pronouncements laying down broad\n\nguidelines on the said issue in various judgements, most of which have been\n\nrelied upon by the counsel for the petitioner in the writ petition impugning the\n\nSpecial Rules. The following judgments have been referred to by the Learned\n\ncounsel for the writ petitioner:\n\n(i)Akhil Bharatiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh (Railway)\n\nrepresented v. Union of India and Others [1981 (1) SCC 246]\n\n(ii)West Bengal Head masters’ Association and ors. v. Union of\n\nIndia (UOI) and Others [AIR 1983 Cal 448]\n\n(\niii)Umesh Chand Vinod Kumar and others v. Krishi Utpadan\n\nMandi Samiti and others\n[AIR 1984 All 46]\n\n(\niv)D.C.Wadhwa and others v. State of Bihar and others\n[AIR\n\n1987 SC 579]\n\n(\nv)State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur v. State Bank of Bikaner and\n\nJaipur Employees Association and others\n[MANU/TN/0293/1991]\n\n(vi)Confederation of Ex-servicemen Associations and Others v.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n75/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nUnion of India (UOI) and Others [AIR 2006 SC 2945]\n\n(vii)Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Tribes Employees Association v.\n\nAditya Pratap Bhanj Dev and Others [MANU/AP/0696/2001], and\n\n(\nviii)Tamilnadu Co-operative Subordinate Officers’ Association v.\n\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu [MANU/TN/0876/2003\n]\n\n31. While it may not be necessary to extract all the above judgments, the\n\nlaw\nlaid down in\n\nState Bank of Bikaner\n's case (cited above) by this court,\n\nsuccinctly states as follows:\n\n“8.Before the learned single Judge, several contentions were raised, one\nwith respect to the defence of party, the other with respect to the nature of\nthe relief and the third with respect to any right of the members of the writ\npetitioner-Association to claim anything in the name of interest beyond\nwhat had been stipulated under\nRegulation 12\naforesaid. Learned Single\nJudge has held :\n\n\"Keeping in trend with the pronouncements of the Supreme Court, it\nis not possible to throw out the writ petition at the threshold itself on\nthe sole ground that it has been filed by an association of\nemployees, without going into the merits of the other contentions.\nEven otherwise, the second petitioner is an individual employees\nand he must be deemed to be directly interested in and affected by\nthe proposed action of the respondents. Besides, the first petitioner\nis a registered trade union, and it is stated that it has got\nmembership of about 5,000, who are all employees of the second\nrespondent all over India. It cannot be stated that the rights of its\nmembers would not be affected by the proposed action of the\nrespondent. The writ laid by the first petitioner, as representing a\nlarge body of employees of the second respondent whose rights and\ninterest are likely to be affected, must be held to be competent.\nRepresentative actions even in Writ jurisdiction cannot be thrown\nout on the simple ground that the body which represents the cause\nof its members on roll is not by itself affected. It would suffice the\npurpose if the rights of its members are affected; and then, as\nobserved by the Supreme Court, collective proceedings are\npermissible instead of driving each individual employee affected to\nfile an independent writ, which would result only in plurality of\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n76/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nlitigation on the common question. The Supreme Court was\nprepared to countenance a non-recognised association maintaining\na writ petition. As observed earlier, the first petitioner is a\nRegistered trade union and it can legitimately, as representing its\nmember, employees of the second respondent, give vent to their\ngrievance and seek redress and relief, as representing their cause.\"\n\nFor us to say, if at all it is necessary, that, this is the most correct view is\nnot a mere formality. Learned single Judge has not come to the said\nconclusion without examining the scope of the writ action by a body of\nindividual members, who together joined as an Association for such\naction, which is in the interest of all the members. He has rightly\ndistinguished the cases of\nN.A. District Pawn Brokers' Association v.\nSecretary to Government of India\n, 1975 I MLJ 290;\nC. I. Kannan v. E.S.I.\nCorporation MANU/TN/0205/1968\n: (1968) I LLJ 770 Mad and M.\nRamaswami v. Government of Tamil Nadu (Writ Appeal No. 472 of 1976,\nJudgment dated August 11, 1980) and relied upon the statement of law in\nthe case of F.C.K.U. (Registered).\nSindri v. Union of India\nMANU/SC/0010/1980 : (1981) I LLJ 193 SC and A.B.S.K. Sangh (Rly.) v.\nUnion of India MANU/SC/0058/1980 : (1981) I LLJ 209 SC . The law on\nthe subject has been candidly stated by the Supreme Court in the last of\nthem that MANU/SC/0058/1980 : (1981) I LLJ 209 SC at 230\" a technical\npoint of this kind has to be overruled for the reasons that a large body of\npersons with a common grievance can always approach the Court on\nprinciple, \"our current procedural jurisdiction is not of individualistic\nAnglo-Indian mould. It is broad-based and people-oriented and envisions\naccess to justice through 'class actions,' 'public interest litigation' and\n'representative proceedings'. Indeed, little Indians in large numbers\nseeking remedies in Court through collective proceedings; instead of being\ndriven to an expensive plurality of litigations, is an affirmation of\nparticipative justice in our democracy. We have no hesitation in holding\nthat the narrow concept of 'cause of action', and 'person aggrieved' and\nindividual litigation is becoming obsolescent in some jurisdictions. It must\nfairly be stated that the learned Attorney General has taken no objection to\na non-recognised association maintaining the writ petitions.\" In the instant\ncase, the Association is a recognised body as a trade union of the\nemployees.”\n\nThus, the principle that emerges from the above is that a body of individuals,\n\nwho have a common grievance and by reason of some disability, or incapacity,\n\nare not in a position to approach the court individually, a writ petition is\n\ncertainly maintainable by an association.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n77/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n32. In the present case, the writ petition has been filed by an association\n\nwhich espouses the cause of its members who are all persons who have cleared\n\nthe teacher eligibility test and have been unemployed while waiting for direct\n\nrecruitment to the post of BT Assistant for more than a decade now. It has also\n\nbeen mentioned in the affidavit that it is one of the most prominent associations\n\nwhose members are qualified persons eligible to be appointed as teachers and\n\nwho possess a pass in TET. When the grievance of all the members of the\n\npetitioner Association is common, it would be to stand on technicality to say\n\nthat each one of those members and each one of the members of the public\n\nwho have a common grievance should have approached the court individually,\n\nand that the Association cannot represent its members in a case of this nature.\n\nSuch a hyper technical approach would amount to a negation of justice and this\n\nCourt is clearly not in favour of such an approach, especially in the light of the\n\npronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.\n\n33. With respect to the other writ petition filed by an individual who is\n\nan aspirant for direct recruitment to the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant,\n\nthe objection raised by the State Government was that as the Rules stipulate a\n\nquota of 50% for direct recruitment and the remaining for appointment by\n\npromotion and transfer, the petitioner cannot have any grievance with respect\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n78/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nto the manner in which appointment is made by promotion from the post of\n\nSecondary Grade Teacher to the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant. In this\n\nregard, the counsel for the petitioner had stated that while the Rules specify a\n\nquota of 50% for direct recruitment, it is a fact that in the state of Tamil Nadu,\n\nas admitted by the state government, direct recruitment to the post of Graduate\n\nTeachers/BT Assistants, after the coming into force of the\nRTE Act\nand NCTE\n\nnotifications, has not been made after 2013. The state government also has not\n\ncome out with a clear picture as to the number of vacancies available in the\n\npost of Graduate teachers and the number of posts for direct recruitment as\n\nagainst the number of posts/vacancies available for promotion. It is the case of\n\nthe petitioner that while the state government is wanting to promote more and\n\nmore secondary grade teachers as graduate teachers without insistence on TET,\n\nwhile also filling up several vacancies by temporary appointments without\n\ninsistence on TET, the posts which are supposed to be earmarked for direct\n\nrecruitment to the post of graduate teachers are also being taken up, and by\n\nreason of their being qualified and yet being unemployed for the past 10 years\n\nand more, and inspite of which, when the impugned Rules stipulate that TET is\n\nan essential criterion for appointment only for direct recruitment and not for\n\npromotion or other modes of appointment, it will definitely affect their rights.\n\nAfter giving our anxious consideration to the grievances expressed by the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n79/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\npetitioners in the writ petitions, this court is convinced that the writ by an\n\nassociation which is espousing the common grievances of all similarly placed\n\npersons who are qualified and unemployed, as well as the writ petitioner in WP\n\nNo.3368 of 2023, is maintainable and the said writ petitions cannot be thrown\n\nout at the threshold on the ground of non-maintainability. Besides, the right to\n\nequality of opportunity in public employment under\nArticle 16\nas a facet of\n\nArticle 14\n, is a cherished fundamental right that furthers the solemn ideals of\n\nequality and justice as envisaged in our Constitution. This Court while dealing\n\nwith a matter of public employment under\nArticle 16\n, cannot reject the petitions\n\non hyper technical ground of non-maintainability.\n\nVALIDITY OF THE IMPUGNED RULES\n\n34. Coming to the merits of the case, the validity of the impugned Rules\n\nhas to be tested on the anvil of the legislative competence of the State\n\nLegislature to issue them in the teeth of the parliamentary legislation, viz. the\n\nRTE Act\n2009 and the NCTE notifications prescribing the minimum eligibility\n\nrequirement for the post of Graduate Teacher, the NCTE being the designated\n\nacademic authority under the Act. It is seen that under Entry 66 of List I in\n\nSchedule VII to the Constitution, the legislative head mentioned is –\n\n‘Coordination and determination of standards in institution for higher\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n80/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\neducation or research and scientific and technical institutions’. Also,\n\n‘Education, including technical education, medical education and universities,\n\nsubject to the provisions of entries 63,64,65 and 66 of List I; vocational and\n\ntechnical training of labour’, as a head of legislation is found in Entry 25 of\n\nList III (Concurrent list) under Schedule VII to the Constitution of India. Entry\n\n66 of List I deals with coordination and determination of standards of higher\n\neducation. Teacher education has been legislated upon by the Union\n\ngovernment by way of parliamentary legislation by virtue of the\nRTE Act\n2009.\n\nUnder the Act\n, the NCTE which has been designated as the academic authority,\n\nhas issued notifications prescribing the minimum eligibility criteria for the post\n\nof Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant and the same is binding on all state\n\ngovernments unless the law to the contrary has been made by the state\n\ngovernment in accordance with\nArticle 254\nof the Constitution. Here again, the\n\nlegislative head as stated in Entry 25 of List III, has been made subject to Entry\n\n66, List I and hence, the area available for the State to legislate in the arena of\n\nteacher education is diminished to the point of non-availability. In the present\n\ncase, it is seen that the state of Tamil Nadu is not governed by any specific\n\nlegislation or statute dealing with teacher education and therefore, the further\n\nquestion of the same being either contrary or repugnant to the provisions of the\n\nRTE Act\nand the consequential or pursuant subordinate legislation does not\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n81/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\narise. In other words, the parliamentary legislation as well as the subordinate\n\nlegislation made pursuant thereto are binding on the state government in the\n\nabsence of a plenary legislation made by the state legislature pursuant to its\n\npower under the Concurrent List, which again is subject to the parliamentary\n\nlegislation made under Entry 66, List I. It is in this background that one will\n\nhave to test the validity of the impugned Rules. A perusal of the NCTE\n\nnotification made pursuant to the\nRTE Act\nwould make it clear that the NCTE\n\nhas prescribed eligibility criteria in terms of educational qualification as also a\n\npass in the teacher eligibility test for appointment to the post of graduate\n\nteacher. As pointed out rightly by the counsel for the petitioners in the writ\n\npetitions challenging the vires of the impugned Rules, the mode of appointment\n\nor the channel of appointment whether by direct recruitment or promotion or\n\ntransfer has not been specified in any of the prescribed qualifications made by\n\nthe NCTE. What has been prescribed by the NCTE is the eligibility criteria for\n\nappointment by whatever means/mode to the posts of Graduate Teacher/BT\n\nAssistant. On the contrary, it is seen that the impugned Rules while apparently\n\nadopting the eligibility criteria as mentioned by the NCTE, has now attempted\n\nto restrict the eligibility criteria of passing the teacher eligibility test only to\n\ndirect recruitment. The very same impugned Rules also specify that 50% of the\n\nappointments to the postgraduate teacher are to be made by direct recruitment,\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n82/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nwhile 48% is to be made by promotion and the remaining 2% by transfer from\n\nother posts as specified in the Rules made therein. When the Academic\n\nAuthority designated under the parliamentary legislation has not made\n\ndistinction in the eligibility criteria on the basis of the channel or mode of\n\nappointment, it is not legally permissible for the state government to prescribe\n\nor make modifications which are contrary to what has been prescribed by\n\nsubordinate legislation made pursuant to the parliamentary legislation which\n\nholds the field.\n\n35.\nIn this context, the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nUnion\n\nof India (UOI) and Ors. v. Shah Goverdhan L. Kabra Teachers College\n\n[(23.10.2002 - SC) : MANU/SC/0882/2002], where the issue was one related\n\nto legislative competence of the State to alter or dilute the parliamentary\n\nlegislative provisions in teacher education, is of relevance and is extracted\n\nhereunder for easy reference:\n\n“6. In view of the rival submissions at the bar, the question that arises for\nconsideration is whether the impugned legislation can be held to be a law\ndealing with coordinated development of education system within Entry 66\nof the List I of the Seventh Schedule or it is a law dealing with the service\nconditions of an employee under the State Government. The power to\nlegislate is engrafted under\nArticle 246\nof the Constitution and the various\nentries for the three lists of the Seventh Schedule are the \"fields of\nlegislation\". The different entries being legislative heads are all of\nenabling character and are designed to define and delimit the respective\nareas of legislative competence of the Union and the State legislature.\nThey neither impose any restrictions on the legislative powers nor\nprescribe any duty for exercise of the legislative power in any particular\nmanner. It has been a cardinal principle of construction that the language\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of the entries should be given the widest scope of which their meaning is\n\n83/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nfairly capable and while interpreting an entry of any List it would not be\nreasonable to import any limitation therein. The rule of widest\nconstruction, however, would not enable the legislature to make a law\nrelating to a matter which has no rational connection with the subject\nmatter of an entry. When the vires of enactment is challenged, the court\nprimarily presumes the constitutionality of the statute by putting the most\nliberal construction upon the relevant legislative entry so that it may have\nthe widest amplitude and the substance of the legislation will have to be\nlooked into. The Court sometimes is duty bound to guard against\nextending the meaning of the words beyond their reasonable connotation\nin anxiety to preserve the power of the legislature.\n\n7. It is further a well-settled principle that entries in the different lists\nshould be read together without giving a narrow meaning to any of them.\n\nPower of the Parliament as well as the State legislature are expressed in\nprecise and definite terms. While an entry is to be given its widest meaning\nbut it cannot be so interpreted as to over-ride another entry or make\nanother entry meaningless and in case of an apparent conflict between\ndifferent entries, it is the duty of the court to reconcile them. When it\nappears to the Court that there is apparent overlapping between the two\nentries the doctrine of \"pith and substance\" has to be applied to find out\nthe true nature of a legislation and the entry with which it would fall. In\ncase of conflict between entries in List I and List II, the same has to be\ndecided by application of the principle of \"pith and substance\". The\ndoctrine of \"pith and substance\" means that if an enactment substantially\nfalls within the powers expressly conferred by the Constitution upon the\nlegislature which enacted it, it cannot be held to be invalid, merely because\nit incidentally encroaches on matters assigned to another legislature.\nWhen a law is impugned as being ultra-vires of the legislative competence,\nwhat is required to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation.\nIf on such an examination it is found that the legislation is in substance\none on a matter assigned to the legislature then it must be held to be valid\nin its entirety even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are\nbeyond its competence. In order to examine the true character of the\nenactment, the entire Act, its object and scope and effect, is required to be\ngone into. The question of invasion into the territory of another legislation\nis to be determined not by degree but by substance. The doctrine of \"pith\nand substance' has to be applied not only in cases of conflict between the\npowers of two legislatures but in any case where the question arises\nwhether a legislation is covered by particular legislative power in exercise\nof which it is purported to be made.\n\n8. Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles of rule of construction if the\nprovisions of the impugned statute, namely, the\nNational Council of\nTeacher Education Act, 1993\nare examined and more particularly\nSection\n17(4)\nthereof which we have already extracted, the conclusion is\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis irresistible that the statute is one squarely dealing with coordination and\n\n84/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ndetermination of standards in institutions for higher education within the\nmeaning of Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule. Both Entries 65 and\n66 of List I empower the Central Legislature to secure the standards of\nresearch and the standards of higher education. The object behind being\nthat the same standards are not lowered at the hands of the particular\nState or States to the detriment of the national progress and the power of\nthe State legislature must be so exercised as not to directly encroach upon\npower of Union under Entry 66. The power to coordinate does not mean\nmerely the power to evaluate but it means to harmonics or secure\nrelationship for concerted action. A legislation made for the purpose of\ncoordination of standards of higher education is essentially a legislation\nby the Central legislature in exercise of its competence under Entry 66 of\nList I of the Seventh Schedule and Sub-section (4) of\nSection 17\nmerely\nprovides the consequences if an institution offers a course or training in\nteacher education in contravention of the Act though the ultimate\nconsequences under Sub-section (4) of\nSection 17\nmay be that unqualified\nteacher will not be entitled to get an employment under the State or\nCentral Government or in a university or in a college. But by no stretch of\nimagination the said provision can be construed to mean a law dealing\nwith employment as has been held by the High Court in the impugned\njudgment.\n\n9. In our considered opinion, the High Court committed gross error in\nconstruing the provisions of Sub-section (4) of\nSection 17\nof the Act to\nmean that it is a legislation dealing with recruitment and conditions of\nservices of persons in the State service within the meaning of Proviso to\n\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution. The High Court committed the aforesaid\nerror by examining the provisions of Sub-section (4) on its plain terms\nwithout trying to examine the true character of the enactment which has to\nbe done by examining the enactment as a whole, its object and scope and\neffect of the provisions. Even, the High Court does not appear to have\napplied the doctrine of \"pith and substance\" and, thus, committed the\nerror in interpreting the provisions of Sub-section (4) of\nSection 17\nto\nmean to be a provision dealing with conditions of service of an employee\nunder the State Government.\n\n10. In the aforesaid premises, the conclusion of the High Court that\n\nSection 17(4)\nis ultra-vires being beyond the competence of the Union\nlegislature cannot be sustained and the said conclusion is accordingly set\naside. On examining the statute as a whole and on scrutiny of the object\nand scope of the statute, we have no manner of doubt that even Sub-\nsection (4) of\nSection 17\nis very much a law dealing with the coordination\nand determination of standards in institution for higher education coming\nwithin Entry 66 of the List III of the Seventh Schedule and, thus, the Union\nlegislature did have the competence for enacting the said provision.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n85/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n11. We are also of the further opinion that the de-recognition of the B.Ed\n(Vacation Course) cannot be nullified on the ground of failure to comply\nwith the principle of natural justice. In the judgment under challenge, the\nHigh Court has held also that when the institution is imparting the B.Ed.\n(Vacation Course) then National Council for Teacher Education could not\nhave refused to recognise the said course. We are unable to accept this\nreasoning inasmuch as the NCTE is an expert body created under the\nprovisions of the National Council for\nTeacher Education Act, 1993\nand\nthe Parliament has imposed upon such expert body the duty to maintain\nthe standards of education, particularly, in relation to the teachers\neducation. Education is the backbone of every democracy and any\ndeterioration in the Standard of teaching in the B.Ed course would\nultimately produce sub-standard prospective teachers who would be\nteaching in schools and colleges throughout the country and on whose\nefficiency the future of the country depends. Inasmuch as the teacher\nhimself has received a sub-standard education it is difficult to expect from\nhim a higher standard of teaching to the students of the schools or other\ninstitutions. It is from this perspective, the conclusion of an expert body\nshould not be lightly tinkered with by court of law without giving due\nweightage to the conclusion arrived at by such expert body. From this\nstandpoint, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court\ncommitted error in holding that there was no reasonable justification for\nnot recognising the B.Ed (Vacation course) which was being imparted by\nthe institution of Shah Goverdhan Lal Kabra Teachers College. In the\naforesaid premises, we set aside the impugned Judgment of High Court\nand allow this appeal.”\n\n36. Also, in\nState of Maharashtra v. Sant Dyaneshwar Shikshan\n\nShastra Mahavidyalaya and Ors.\n[(31.03.2006 - SC):\n\nMANU/SC/1756/2006], it has been stated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as\n\nfollows:\n\n“20. The learned Counsel for various colleges supported Mr. Raju\nRamachandran on interpretation and application of the provisions of the\nAct and final decision of the High Court. They, however, had taken other\ncontentions as well. According to them, the State has no locus standi to\nchallenge the decision of NCTE. The State cannot be said to be \"person\naggrieved\" or \"aggrieved party\" so as to challenge the decision of NCTE.\nIf the decision is against the college, it is only the college which has\n'standing' to impugn\nthe said decision\n. The High Court, therefore, in the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nsubmission of the learned Counsel for colleges, ought to have dismissed\n\n86/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nthe petition filed by the State as not maintainable without entering into the\nmerits of the matter. It was also submitted that under the scheme of the\nConstitution, particularly\nArticles 245\n, 246\n, 248\nand\nread with\nSchedule VII thereof, only Parliament has power of co-ordination and\ndetermination of standards in institutions for higher education or\nresearch, scientific and technical institutions. State Legislatures have no\nauthority to enact any law in the field covered by Entry 66 of List I of\nSchedule VII. Obviously, therefore, State Government has no authority to\ntake a policy decision in respect of the subjects covered by Entry 66 of List\nI of Schedule VII for which a specific enactment has been made by\nParliament and under the said Act authority has been granted to NCTE to\ntake an action. As to Regulations and Guidelines, it was submitted that\nunder the Act power has been conferred on NCTE. It is, therefore, only\nNCTE, which can consider the question and take appropriate decision\nunder the Act and it is not open to NCTE to make Regulations or frame\nGuidelines empowering the State Government to undertake such exercise.\nAccording to the counsel, therefore, even if Regulations are framed or\nGuidelines made, they are not in consonance with the Act and there is\nabdication of power by NCTE in favour of State Government which is hit\nby the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation. Regulations\npermitting such excessive / impermissible delegation must be declared\ninconsistent with the parent Act as also ultra vires and unconstitutional.\nThe counsel also submitted that so-called policy decision of the State\nGovernment is arbitrary and unreasonable and would be hit by Clause (g)\nof\nArticle 19(1)\nof the Constitution which allows all citizens to have the\nright to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or\nbusiness, otherwise legal and lawful.\nArticle 19(6)\ncannot be invoked by\nthe State as total prohibition to open B.Ed. college can never be said to be\nin the interest of general public and would not fall within \"reasonable\nrestriction\" permissible under the said provision. It is also violative of\n\nArticle 21A\nas inserted by the\nConstitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act,\n. Over and above constitutional inhibitions, the order dated 28th\nDecember, 2004 is arbitrary and unreasonable inasmuch as\nconsiderations which weighed with the State Government relating to\nemployment of B.Ed. teachers were totally irrelevant and extraneous.\nTaking education and getting employment are two different things. The\ncolleges are not claiming any grant or financial aid from the State, nor do\nthey give any assurance or guarantee to students admitted to B.Ed.\ncolleges that the State will give them employment. It is, therefore, not\nopen to the State Government to refuse to grant NOC because the State is\nnot able to give employment to teachers after they get B.Ed. degree. There\nare several Arts, Commerce and Science colleges in the State in which\nstudents take education and get degrees of B.A., B.Com. or B.Sc. It is not\neven the case of the State that all those students got employment at one or\nthe other place. Thus, the so-called policy decision of the State\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Government not to grant NOC to B.Ed. colleges is totally irrational. It\n\n87/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nwas also submitted by the respondents that they had made huge\ninvestments and if at this stage they will be refused permission,\nirreparable injury and loss would be caused to them. Finally, it was\nsubmitted that since the decision of NCTE is legal, lawful and in\nconsonance with the provisions of the Act as also consistent with the law\n\nlaid down by\nthis Court in several judgments, the order passed by the\nHigh Court deserves to be upheld by allowing the institutions to open\nB.Ed. colleges from the year 2005-06 as has been done by NCTE. If this\nCourt considers it appropriate, specific direction may be issued to the\nrespondents to conduct extra classes/lectures and to hold\nsupplementary/additional examination. Once the action of NCTE is found\nto be lawful and the decision of the State Government bad, no prejudice\nshould be caused to the institutions.\n\n21. Before we deal with the contentions of the parties, it would be\nappropriate if we refer to the relevant provisions of law. Part XI of the\nConstitution deals with relations between Union and States. Chapter I\nthereof relates to legislative relations and distribution of legislative\npowers.\nArticle 245\nenables Parliament to make laws for the whole or any\npart of territory of India. Similarly, a Legislature of a State has power to\nmake laws for the whole or any part of the State.\nArticle 246\nprovides for\ndistribution of legislative power between Parliament and Legislatures of\nStates and reads thus:\n\n246. Subject-matter of laws by Parliament and by the Legislatures\nof States-(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3),\nParliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any\nof the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this\nConstitution referred to as the \"Union List\").\n\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament and,\nsubject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power\nto make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List\nIII in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the\n\"Concurrent List\").\n\n(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has\nexclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof\nwith respect to any of the mattes enumerated in List II in the\nSeventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the 'State\nList').\n\n(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter\nfor any part of the territory of India not included [in a State]\nnotwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the\nState List.\n\nWhereas\nArticle 248\nprovides for residuary power of Legislature,\n\nArticle 254\ncovers cases of inconsistency between laws made by\nParliament and by Legislatures of States.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n88/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n22. Schedule VII to the Constitution comprises of three Lists: (i) Union\nList, (ii) State List and (iii) Concurrent List. While exclusive power to\nenact laws lies with Parliament under List I, the power to enact laws\nunder List II is with the State Legislatures. In respect of subjects falling\nunder List III, it is open to Parliament as well as State Legislatures to\nenact laws subject to the provisions of\nArticles 254.\n\n22.1 Entries 63 to 66 of List I of Schedule VII relate to higher education.\nEntry 66 which is relevant reads thus:\n\n66. Co-ordination with determination of standards in institutions for\nhigher education or research and scientific and technical intuitions\n\n22.2 Entry 11 of List II inter alia included university education. It was\nomitted by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976 and became part\nof Entry 25 of List III (Concurrent List). Entry 25, as originally stood\nread as under:\n\n25. The vocational and technical training of labour.\nAfter the amendment of 1976, the Entry as it stands now reads thus:\n\n25. Education, including technical education medical education and\nuniversities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List\nI; vocational and technical training of labour.\n\n23. The National Council for Teacher Training Act, 1993 has been\nenacted by Parliament and deals with teacher's education. It came into\nforce with effect from July 1, 1995. The Preamble of the Act is relevant\nand reads thus:\n\nAn Act\nto provide for the establishment of a National Council for\nTeacher Education with a view to achieving planned and co-\nordinated development of the teacher education system throughout\nthe country, the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and\nstandards in the teacher education system and for matters\nconnected therewith.\n\n24.\nSection 2\nis definition clause wherein various terms have been\ndefined. \"Council\" is defined as the National Council for Teacher's\nEducation established under Sub-section (1) of\nSection 3\nof the Act.\n\n\"Institution\" has been defined as \"an institution which offers courses for\ntraining in teacher's education\". \"Teacher education\" is defined thus:\n\nTeacher education means programmes of education, research or training\nof persons for equipping them to teach at pre-primary, primary,\nsecondary and senior secondary stages in schools, and includes non-\nformal education, part-time education, adult education and\ncorrespondence education.”\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n89/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n37.\nIn\nMaa Vaishno Devi Mahila Mahavidyalaya v. State of U.P. and\n\nOrs.\n[(13.12.2012 - SC) : MANU/SC/1102/2012], it has been held by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court that\n\n“43.Now, we may examine some of the judgments of this Court which\nhave dealt with these aspects. In the case of State of Tamil Nadu and Anr.\n\nv. Adhiyaman Educational and Research Institute and Ors.\nMANU/SC/0709/1995 : (1995) 4 SCC 104, the Supreme Court while\ndiscussing various aspects in regard to constitutional validity of\nTamil\nNadu Private College Regulation Act, 1976\nand the provisions of the All\nIndia Council for Technical Education Act clearly spelled out the\npreferential role of the Council as under:\n\n22. The aforesaid provisions of the Act including its preamble\nmake it abundantly clear that the Council has been established\nunder the Act for coordinated and integrated development of the\ntechnical education system at all levels throughout the country and\nis enjoined to promote qualitative improvement of such education\nin relation to planned quantitative growth. The Council is also\nrequired to regulate and ensure proper maintenance of norms and\nstandards in the technical education system. The Council is\nfurther to evolve suitable performance appraisal system\nincorporating such norms and mechanisms in enforcing their\naccountability. It is also required to provide guidelines for\nadmission of students and has power to withhold or discontinue\ngrants and to de-recognise the institutions where norms and\nstandards\nlaid down by\nit and directions given by it from time to\ntime are not followed. This duty and responsibility cast on the\nCouncil implies that the norms and standards to be set should be\nsuch as would prevent a lopsided or an isolated development of\ntechnical education in the country.\n\n...It is necessary to bear this aspect of the norms and standards to\nbe prescribed in mind, for a major debate before us centered\naround the right of the States to prescribe standards higher than\nthe one\nlaid down by\nthe Council. What is further necessary to\nremember is that the Council has on it representatives not only of\nthe States but also of the State Universities. They have, therefore,\na say in the matter of laying down the norms and standards which\nmay be prescribed by the Council for such education from time to\ntime. The Council has further the Regional Committees, at\npresent, at least, in four major geographical zones and the\nconstitution and functions of the Committees are to be prescribed\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis by the Regulations to be made by the Council. Since the Council\n\n90/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nhas the representation of the States and the provisional bodies on\nit which have also representation from different States and\nregions, they have a say in the constitution and functions of these\nCommittees as well....\n\n44. Further, the Court, while noticing the inconsistency between the\nCentral and State statutes or the State authorities acting contrary to the\nCentral statute, held as under:\n\n41. (vi) However, when the situations/seats are available and the\nState authorities deny an applicant the same on the ground that\nthe applicant is not qualified according to its standards or\nqualifications, as the case may be, although the applicant satisfies\nthe standards or qualifications\nlaid down by\nthe Central law, they\nact unconstitutionally.\nSo also when the State authorities de-\n\nrecognise or disaffiliate an institution for not satisfying the\nstandards or requirement\nlaid down by\nthem, although it satisfied\nthe norms and requirements\nlaid down by\nthe Central authority,\nthe State authorities act illegally.\n\nXXX\n\n43. As a result, as has been pointed out earlier, the provisions of\nthe Central statute on the one hand and of the State statutes on the\nother, being inconsistent and, therefore, repugnant with each\nother, the Central statute will prevail and the de-recognition by the\nState Government or the disaffiliation by the State University on\ngrounds which are inconsistent with those enumerated in the\nCentral statute will be inoperative.\n\n45. Still, in another case of\nJaya Gokul Educational Trust v.\nCommissioner and Secretary to Government Higher Education Deptt.,\nThiruvananthapuram, Kerala State and Anr. MANU/SC/0269/2000\n:\n\n(2000) 5 SCC 231, the Court reiterating the above principle, held as\nunder:\n\n22. As held in the\nTamil Nadu\ncase AIR 1995 SCW 2179, the\nCentral Act of 1987 and; in particular,\nSection 10(K)\noccupied the\nfield relating the `grant of approvals' for establishing technical\ninstitutions and the provisions of the Central Act alone were to be\ncomplied with. So far as the provisions of the\nMahatma Gandhi\nUniversity Act\nor its statutes were concerned and in particular\nstatute 9(7), they merely required the University to obtain the\n`views' of the State Government. That could not be characterised\nas requiring the \"approval\" of the State Government. If, needed,\nthe University statute could be so interpreted, such a provision\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis requiring approval of the State Government would be repugnant to\n\n91/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nthe provisions of\nSection 10(K)\nof the AICTE Act, 1987 and would\nagain be void.\n\nAs pointed out in the\nTamil Nadu\ncase there were\nenough provisions in the Central Act for consultation by the\nCouncil of the AICTE with various agencies, including the State\nGovernments and the Universities concerned. The State Level\nCommittee and the Central Regional Committees contained\nvarious experts and State representatives. In case of difference of\nopinion as between the various consultees, the AICTE would have\nto go by the views of the Central Task Force. These were sufficient\nsafeguards for ascertaining the views of the State Governments\nand the Universities.\n\nNo doubt the question of affiliation was a\ndifferent matter and was not covered by the Central Act but in the\n\nTamil Nadu\ncase, it was held that the University could not impose\nany conditions inconsistent with the\nAICTE Act\nor its Regulation\nor the conditions imposed by the AICTE. Therefore, the procedure\nfor obtaining the affiliation and any conditions which could be\nimposed by the University, could not be inconsistent with the\nprovisions of the Central Act. The University could not, therefore,\nin any event have sought for `approval' of the State Government.\n\n46. This view of the Supreme Court was reiterated with approval by a\nlarger Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of\nState of Maharashtra v.\nSant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya and Ors.\nMANU/SC/1756/2006\n: (2006) 9 SCC 1. While discussing in detail the\nvarious legal issues in relation to grant of affiliation/ recognition to the\ninstitution and permission to start a new college, the Court held as under:\n\n53. The Court then considered the argument put forward on behalf\nof the State that while it would be open for the Council to lay down\nminimum standards and requirements, it did not preclude the State\nfrom prescribing higher standards and requirements.\n\n54. Negativing the contention, the Court quoted with approval the\nfollowing observations of B.N. Rau, J. in\nG.P. Stewart v. Brojendra\nKishore Roy Chaudhury (MANU/WB/0202/1939\n: AIR 1939 Cal.\n628 : 43 CWN 913):\n\nIt is sometimes said that two laws cannot be said to be properly\nrepugnant unless there is direct conflict between them, as when one\nsays `do' and the other 'don't', there is no true repugnancy,\naccording to this view, if it is possible to obey both the laws. For\nreasons which we shall set forth presently, we think that this is too\nnarrow a test; there may well be cases of repugnancy where both\nlaws say `don't' but in different ways. For example, one law may\nsay `no person shall sell liquor by retail, that is, in quantities of\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis less than five gallons at a time' and another law may say, 'no\n\n92/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nperson shall sell liquor by retail, that is, in quantities of less than\nten gallons at a time'. Here, it is obviously possible to obey both\nlaws, by obeying the more stringent of the two, namely, the second\none; yet it is equally obvious that the two laws are repugnant, for\nto the extent to which a citizen is compelled to obey one of them,\nthe other, though not actually disobeyed, is nullified.\nXXX\n\n64. Even otherwise, in our opinion, the High Court was fully\njustified in negativing the argument of the State Government that\npermission could be refused by the State Government on \"policy\nconsideration\". As already observed earlier, policy consideration\nwas negatived by this Court in Thirumuruga Kirupananda Variyar\nThavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Educational and\nCharitable Trust v. State of Tamil Nadu MANU/SC/0601/1996 :\n\n1996 DGLS (soft) 327 : 1996 (3) SCC 15 : JT 1996 (2) SC. 692 as\nalso in Jaya Gokul Educational Trust.\n\nXXX\n\n74. It is thus clear that the Central Government has considered the\nsubject of secondary education and higher education at the\nnational level.\nThe Act\nof 1993 also requires Parliament to\nconsider teacher-education system \"throughout the country\".\n\nNCTE, therefore, in our opinion, is expected to deal with\napplications for establishing new Bed colleges or allowing increase\nin intake capacity, keeping in view the 1993 Act and planned and\ncoordinated development of teacher-education system in the\ncountry. It is neither open to the State Government nor to a\nuniversity to consider the local conditions or apply \"State policy\"\n\nto refuse such permission. In fact, as held by this Court in cases\nreferred to hereinabove, the State Government has no power to\nreject the prayer of an institution or to overrule the decision of\nNCTE. The action of the State Government, therefore, was\ncontrary to law and has rightly been set aside by the High Court.\n\n47. The above enunciated principles clearly show that the Council is the\nauthority constituted under the Central Act with the responsibility of\nmaintaining education of standards and judging upon the infra-structure\nand facilities available for imparting such professional education. Its\nopinion is of utmost importance and shall take precedence over the views\nof the State as well as that of the University. The concerned Department\nof the State and the affiliating University have a role to play but it is\nlimited in its application. They cannot lay down any guideline or policy\nwhich would be in conflict with the Central statute or the standards laid\ndown by the Central body. State can frame its policy for admission to\nsuch professional courses but such policy again has to be in conformity\nwith the directives issued by the Central body. In the present cases, there\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis is not much conflict on this issue, but it needs to be clarified that while the\n\n93/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nState grants its approval, and University its affiliation, for increased\nintake of seats or commencement of a new course/college, its directions\nshould not offend and be repugnant to what has been laid down in the\nconditions for approval granted by the Central authority or Council.\nWhat is most important is that all these authorities have to work ad idem\nas they all have a common object to achieve i.e. of imparting of education\nproperly and ensuring maintenance of proper standards of education,\nexamination and infrastructure for betterment of educational system.\nOnly if all these authorities work in a coordinated manner and with\ncooperation, will they be able to achieve the very object for which all\nthese entities exist.\n\n48.\nThe NCTE Act\nhas been enacted by the Parliament with reference to\nEntry 66 of List I of Schedule VII of the Constitution. There is no such\nspecific power vested in the State Legislature under List II of the Seventh\nSchedule. Entry 25 of List III of the Seventh Schedule is the other Entry\nthat provides the field for legislation both to the State and the Centre, in\nrelation to education, including technical education, medical education\nand Universities; vocational and technical training and labour. The field\nis primarily covered by the Union List and thus, the State can exercise\nany legislative power under Entry 25, List III but such law cannot be\nrepugnant to the Central law. Wherever the State law is irreconcilable\nwith the Central law, the State Law must give way in favour of the Central\nlaw to the extent of repugnancy. This will show the supremacy of the\nCentral law in relation to professional education, including the teacher\ntraining programmes. In the case of Medical Council of India v. State of\nKarnataka MANU/SC/0424/1998 : (1998) 6 SCC 131, the Court had the\noccasion to discuss this conflict as follows:\n\n27. The State Acts, namely, the Karnataka Universities Act and\nthe Karnataka Capitation Fee Act must give way to the Central\nAct, namely, the\nIndian Medical Council Act, 1956\n. The\nKarnataka Capitation Fee Act was enacted for the sole purpose of\nRegulation in collection of capitation fee by colleges and for that,\nthe State Government is empowered to fix the maximum number\nof students that can be admitted but that number cannot be over\nand above that fixed by the Medical Council as per the\nRegulations.\nChapter IX of the Karnataka Universities Act\n, which\ncontains provision for affiliation of colleges and recognition of\ninstitutions, applies to all types of colleges and not necessarily to\nprofessional colleges like medical colleges. Sub-section (10) of\nSection 53, falling in Chapter IX of this Act, provides for\nmaximum number of students to be admitted to courses for\nstudies in a college and that number shall not exceed the intake\nfixed by the university or the Government. But this provision has\nagain to be read subject to the intake fixed by the Medical Council\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis under its Regulations. It is the Medical Council which is\n\n94/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nprimarily responsible for fixing standards of medical education\nand overseeing that these standards are maintained. It is the\nMedical Council which is the principal body to lay down\nconditions for recognition of medical colleges which would\ninclude the fixing of intake for admission to a medical college. We\nhave already seen in the beginning of this judgment various\nprovisions of the\nMedical Council Act\n. It is, therefore, the Medical\nCouncil which in effect grants recognition and also withdraws the\nsame. Regulations under\nSection 33\nof the Medical Council Act,\nwhich were made in 1977, prescribe the accommodation in the\ncollege and its associated teaching hospitals and teaching and\ntechnical staff and equipment in various departments in the\ncollege and in the hospitals. These Regulations are in\nconsiderable detail. Teacher-student ratio prescribed is 1 to 10,\nexclusive of the Professor or Head of the Department.\n\nRegulations further prescribe, apart from other things, that the\nnumber of teaching beds in the attached hospitals will have to be\nin the ratio of 7 beds per student admitted. Regulations of the\nMedical Council, which were approved by the Central\nGovernment in 1971, provide for the qualification requirements\nfor appointments of persons to the posts of teachers and visiting\nphysicians/surgeons of medical colleges and attached hospitals.\nXXX\n\n29. A medical student requires gruelling study and that can be\ndone only if proper facilities are available in a medical college\nand the hospital attached to it has to be well equipped and the\nteaching faculty and doctors have to be competent enough that\nwhen a medical student comes out, he is perfect in the science of\ntreatment of human beings and is not found wanting in any way.\nThe country does not want half-baked medical professionals\ncoming out of medical colleges when they did not have full\nfacilities of teaching and were not exposed to the patients and\ntheir ailments during the course of their study. The Medical\nCouncil, in all fairness, does not wish to invalidate the\nadmissions made in excess of that fixed by it and does not wish to\ntake any action of withdrawing recognition of the medical\ncolleges violating the Regulation. Henceforth, however, these\nmedical colleges must restrict the number of admissions fixed by\nthe Medical Council. After the insertion of Sections 10A, 10B and\n10C in the\nMedical Council Act\n, the Medical Council has framed\nRegulations with the previous approval of the Central\nGovernment which were published in the Gazette of India dated\n29-9-1993 (though the notification is dated 20-9-1993). Any\nmedical college or institution which wishes to increase the\nadmission capacity in MBBS/higher courses (including\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis diploma/degree/higher specialities), has to apply to the Central\n\n95/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nGovernment for permission along with the permission of the State\nGovernment and that of the university with which it is affiliated\nand in conformity with the Regulations framed by the Medical\nCouncil. Only the medical college or institution which is\nrecognised by the Medical Council can so apply.\n\n49. A Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of\nDr. Preeti Srivastava\nand Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/1021/1999\n:\n\n(1999) 7 SCC 120, while dealing with the provisions of the Medial\nCouncil of India Act and referring to Entry 25 of List III and Entry 66 of\nList I with reference to the\nArticles 245\n, 246\n, 254\nand\n15(4)\nof the\nConstitution, spelled out the supremacy of the Council and the provisions\nof the Central Act, particularly in relation to the control and Regulation\nof higher education. It also discussed providing of the eligibility\nconditions and qualifications and determining the standards to be\nmaintained by the Institutions. The Court in paragraph 36 of the\njudgment held as under:\n\n36. It would not be correct to say that the norms for admission\nhave no connection with the standard of education, or that the\nrules for admission are covered only by Entry 25 of List III.\n\nNorms of admission can have a direct impact on the standards of\neducation. of course, there can be rules for admission which are\nconsistent with or do not affect adversely the standards of\neducation prescribed by the Union in exercise of powers under\nEntry 66 of List I. For example, a State may, for admission to the\npostgraduate medical courses, lay down qualifications in addition\nto those prescribed under Entry 66 of List I. This would be\nconsistent with promoting higher standards for admission to the\nhigher educational courses. But any lowering of the norms laid\ndown can and does have an adverse effect on the standards of\neducation in the institutes of higher education. Standards of\neducation in an institution or college depend on various factors.\nSome of these are:\n\n(1) the calibre of the teaching staff;\n\n(2) a proper syllabus designed to achieve a high level of\neducation in the given span of time;\n\n(3) the student-teacher ratio;\n\n(4) the ratio between the students and the hospital beds available\nto each student;\n\n(5) the calibre of the students admitted to the institution;\n(6) equipment and laboratory facilities, or hospital facilities for\ntraining in the case of medical colleges;\n\n(7) adequate accommodation for the college and the attached\nhospital; and\n(8) the standard of examinations held including the manner in\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis which the papers are set and examined and the clinical\n\n96/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nperformance is judged.”\n\n38. As such, the principle that the field of teacher education is the\n\nexclusive preserve of Parliamentary legislation, has been stressed upon in all\n\ncases where the NCTE act has been considered, and it has been held that all\n\nissues pertaining to teacher education will fall within Entry 66 of List I and\n\nhence, within the legislative competence of Parliament. In the present case, the\n\nissue relates to school education where the NCTE has been designated as the\n\nauthority to prescribe the essential eligibility criteria for appointment to the\n\npost of graduate teachers. In this context, the judgement of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court cited supra is relevant to point out that the essential eligibility\n\ncriteria prescribed by the designated authority under the\nRTE Act\ncannot be\n\ntreated as one that deals with the recruitment and conditions of service of\n\npersons in a State under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution, but is one which is\n\nmade in exercise of the powers conferred upon the NCTE by a parliamentary\n\nlegislation in the subject of teacher education which falls within Entry 66 of\n\nList I. The above judgement thus squarely covers the issue and once, it is\n\nestablished that the subject matter is one that falls within the legislative head of\n\n‘education’ as well as ‘higher education’, and when Parliament has made a law\n\ngoverning the said field, it is not open to the State government in exercise of its\n\npowers under\nArticle 309\nto issue Rules that alter, modify, or dilute the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n97/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nstandards or in any manner tamper with the same except in accordance with\n\nthe provisions relating to the constitutional provisions governing the\n\novercoming of repugnancy between Parliamentary and State legislation, which\n\nagain is open only in cases where the legislative head falls under the\n\nConcurrent List. In the present case, as the subject – ‘Teacher Education’ falls\n\nwithin the domain of parliamentary legislation, seeking to set uniformly high\n\nstandards for all teachers throughout the country, under the\nRTE Act, 2009\n, the\n\nfurther question of the State coming up with a repugnant law will not arise.\n\n39. Further, we find force in the submissions of the counsel for the writ\n\npetitioner that the impugned Rules are a piece of colourable legislation to the\n\nextent that they seek to tweak the mandate of the NCTE Regulations that\n\napplies the minimum eligibility criteria to all appointments to BT Assistants,\n\nirrespective of the mode of appointment. The doctrine of Colourable Legislation\n\ncame to be examined by a Constitution Bench of this Court in\nK.C. Gajapati\n\nNarayan Deo and Ors. v. State of Orissa\n[(1954) 1 SCR 1], in which, it was\n\nheld that the doctrine of colourable legislation does not involve any question of\n\n'bona fides' or 'mala fides' on the part of the Legislature. The whole doctrine\n\nrevolves around the question of competence of a particular Legislature to enact\n\na particular law. If the Legislature is competent to pass a particular law, the\n\nmotives, which impelled it to act, are really irrelevant. On the other hand, if the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n98/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nLegislature lacks competency, the question of motive does not arise at all.\n\nWhether a statute is constitutional or not, is thus always a question of power\n\n(Vide Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, Vol. 1, p. 379). The crucial question\n\nto be asked is whether there has been a transgression of legislative authority as\n\nconferred by the Constitution which is the source of all powers as also the\n\nseparation of powers. A legislative transgression may be patent, manifest or\n\ndirect or may also be disguised, covert and indirect. It is to this latter class of\n\ncases that the expression 'colourable legislation' has been applied in certain\n\njudicial pronouncements. The expression 'colourable legislation' means that\n\nalthough apparently a Legislature in passing a statute which purports to act\n\nwithin the limits of its powers, yet, in substance and in reality, it transgresses\n\nthose powers, the transgression being veiled by what appears, on proper\n\nexamination, to be a mere pretence or disguise. The discerning test is to find\n\nout the substance of the act and not merely the form or outward appearance. If\n\nthe subject matter in substance is something which is beyond the legislative\n\npower, the form in which the law is clothed, would not save it from\n\ncondemnation. The constitutional prohibitions cannot be allowed to be violated\n\nby employing indirect methods. To test the true nature and character of the\n\nchallenged legislation, the investigation by the Court should be directed\n\ntowards examining (i) the effect of the legislation; and (ii) its object,\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n99/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\npurpose or design. While doing so, the Court cannot enter into investigating the\n\nmotives, which induced the Legislature to exercise its power.\n\n40. The abovesaid view was reiterated by Larger Bench (Seven Judges)\n\nin\nR.S. Joshi, S.T.O. v. Ajit Mills Ltd.\n[(1978) 1 SCR 338], and by\n\nConstitution Bench in\nNaga People's Movement of Human Rights v. Union\n\nof India\n[AIR 1998 SC 465] and has been the law applied in a catena of\n\ndecisions thereafter.\n\n41. In order to further support her case, the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners also relied upon the NCTE Regulations of the year 2001 which\n\nmake it rather clear that even for movement from one level to a higher level\n\npost, the minimum qualifications as given or prescribed in the concerned\n\npromotional level post would also require to be fulfilled. If there was any doubt\n\non this score, the said Regulations bring out the intention of the NCTE in this\n\nregard and the said principle applied in consonance with the NCTE\n\nRegulations, 2010, prescribing qualifications and eligibility criteria for\n\nGraduate Assistants, without making any distinction in the qualifications so\n\nprescribed on the basis of mode/channel of appointment, will lead to the\n\ninevitable conclusion that as on date, any person aspiring to be appointed as a\n\nGraduate Assistant/BT Assistant, by whatever mode of appointment, be it by\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n100/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ndirect recruitment, promotion or transfer, would have to necessarily fulfil the\n\neligibility criteria as prescribed by the NCTE Regulations, 2010, under which a\n\npass in TET is clearly mandatory. It is also seen from the additional documents\n\nfiled in the writ petition impugning the Special Rules that in several other\n\nStates where the NCTE notifications have been adopted, the essential eligibility\n\ncriteria of passing TET has been stressed upon in all appointments irrespective\n\nof the channel of appointment that is by direct recruitment or by promotion.\n\nFurther, in an identical case before the Division Bench of the Allahabad High\n\nCourt in Subedar Yadav and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors. [Special Appeal\n\nno. 737 of 2018 dated 04.09.2018], it has been pleased to hold that the\n\nrequirement of passing TET is mandatory for selection, promotion or for any\n\nother mode of appointment and it is not only confined to selection from open\n\nrecruitment.\n\n42. The reliance of the appellants on the order passed by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in C. A. Nos. 6186-6187 of 2008 dated 05.09.2013 that the\n\nteachers who were appointed prior to G.O. Ms. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011 will\n\nremain protected, is misplaced in the context of the present issue. As rightly\n\nheld by the Learned Judge in the order under appeal, the said appeals before\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court arose out of different facts and circumstances,\n\nwhere essentially the question was with respect to the initial methods of\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n101/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nrecruitment and the zone of consideration for appointment, that is, whether\n\nthere should be a state-wide selection or district-wise selection and it is in those\n\ncircumstances that after the coming into force of the\nRTE Act\n, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court while disposing of the said appeals, had held that those who\n\nhad already been appointed prior to the coming into force of G.O. Ms. No.\n\n181 dated 15.11.2011 shall remain protected. This observation/ direction of the\n\nHon’ble Supreme Court cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be deemed to be\n\nunderstood as meaning that all those appointed prior to the date of the said\n\nG.O. Ms. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011 would not have to pass the Teacher\n\nEligibility Test even if they aspire for a promotion to the higher post of\n\nGraduate Teacher, when at present the qualifications prescribed by the NCTE\n\nrequire a pass in TET, apart from the other essential educational qualifications.\n\nAs such, the contention that the observation in the civil appeals would exempt\n\nthe writ appellants from passing the teacher eligibility test while seeking for\n\npromotion to the postgraduate teacher, is hereby negatived.\n\n43. At the risk of repetition, it must be stated that while the NCTE\n\nnotifications had clearly protected those who had already been appointed prior\n\nto the date of the notification from passing TET, there is nothing in the said\n\nnotification which affords an exemption from passing TET when they aspire for\n\nfresh appointments by way of direct recruitment, promotion or otherwise to the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n102/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\npost of Graduate Teacher. The principle of interpretation that when the\n\nlanguage of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is not for the courts to\n\nsubstitute their opinion or inject their philosophy into the provisions, is trite\n\nlaw and the same is to be applied. The principle of literal interpretation would\n\nlead to the inevitable conclusion that only those who have been appointed prior\n\nto the date of issuance of the NCTE notifications are protected and exempted\n\nfrom passing TET for continuance in the respective posts against which they\n\nhave been appointed. Hence, we conclude that those appointed prior to\n\n29.07.2011 and in order to extend the benefit to the date of passing of G.O.\n\nMs. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011, those appointed prior to that date,\n\ni.e.15.11.2011 either in the post of Secondary Grade teacher or Graduate\n\nTeacher/BT Assistant are exempted from passing TET for continuance in the\n\nsaid posts. However, for promotion to the post of Graduate Teacher from the\n\npost of Secondary Grade teacher or appointment to the post of Secondary\n\nGrade teacher or Graduate teacher/BT Assistant by any channel or mode of\n\nappointment by either direct recruitment or promotion or by transfer, a pass in\n\nTeacher Eligibility Test is mandatory in accordance with the\nRTE Act\nread with\n\nthe NCTE notifications.\n\n44. In the result, the writ petitions challenging the vires of the impugned\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n103/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nSpecial Rules are hereby allowed, and the Special Rules for the Tamilnadu\n\nSchool Educational Subordinate Service issued in GO Ms. No.13 School\n\nEducation (S.E3(1)) Department dated 30.01.2020 insofar as it prescribes “a\n\npass in Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)” only for direct recruitment for the post\n\nof BT Assistant and not for promotion thereto in Annexure-I (referred to in\n\nRule 6) is illegal being ultravires the\nRight of Children to Free and\n\nCompulsory Education Act\n2009 and the Rules framed thereunder and the\n\nNCTE Notifications dated 23.08.2010 and 29.07.2011. Accordingly, W.A.No.\n\n2795/2022 is hereby dismissed.\n\nB. WA Nos. 313, 833, 1891, 2050, 2082, 2617 of 2022\n\nRIGHT OF THOSE APPOINTED PRIOR TO THE RTE ACT, NCTE\n\nNOTIFICATIONS TO CONTINUE IN SERVICE WITHOUT INSISTENCE\n\nON TET.\n\n45. The next question relates to whether those already in service prior to\n\nthe commencement of the Act are obliged to acquire a pass in TET for\n\ncontinuance in service as Secondary Grade Teachers without seeking any\n\nfurther promotion. Here, a reading of\nSection 23\nof the RTE Act would reveal\n\nthe following:\n\n(a) The sub-clause (1) to\nSection 23\nof the Act provides that any person\nwould be eligible “for appointment” as a teacher provided he possesses\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n104/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nminimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority authorized\nby the central government namely NCTE. As a matter of fact, pursuant\nto\nSection 23\nof the Act, a notification was issued by NCTE dated\n23.08.2010 that teachers shall be eligible for appointment from among\nthose who have passed Teachers Eligibility Test (TET).\n\n(b) The expression “for appointment” employed in Subsection (1) to\n\nSection 23\nof the Act is indicative of the fact that the provision was\nintended to impose conditions for appointments of teachers to be\nappointed subsequent to the introduction of the Act and notification.\n\n(c) Subsection (2) to\nSection 23\nof the Act provides for certain relaxation\nin cases of States where there are no adequate institutions offering\ncourses or training in teacher education or States where there are no\nadequate number of teachers possessing minimum qualification as laid\ndown in subsection (1) to\nsection 23\nviz., TET. In such cases the central\ngovernment may by notification relax the minimum qualifications\nrequired for appointment as a teacher for a period not exceeding five\nyears.\n\n(d) It is important to note that Subsection (2) to\nSection 23\nof the Act\nalso governs future appointments and does not intend to touch upon the\nrights of teachers or impair the rights of teachers who are already in\nservice to continue in service.\n\n46. Reliance was sought to be placed on the proviso to sub section (2) to\n\nSection 23\nof the Act to suggest that the qualification test is not only with\n\nreference to teachers who are to be appointed but also teachers who were\n\nalready in service ought to pass TET test to remain in service. This is in view of\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n105/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nthe fact that the proviso “a teacher who had at the commencement of this Act\n\ndoes not possess minimum qualification would be required to acquire the\n\nminimum qualification within a period of five years”. The expression “teacher”\n\nhere would not include those, who are already in service but is meant to cover\n\ncandidates who intend or who desire to be appointed as teachers. This would\n\nbe evident from a reading of sub section (2) to\nSection 23\nof the Act which\n\nprovides that “teachers possessing minimum qualification” which qualifies the\n\nexpression “for appointment” as a teacher. It is thus clear that the expression\n\n“teacher” employed in\nSection 23\nof the Act does not cover teachers who are\n\nalready in appointment/in service but those who intend or desire to be\n\nappointed as teachers.\n\n47. Secondly, a proviso is normally only a carve out or an exception to\n\nthe main provision and there is no reason to take a different view. There is\n\nconsistency between the proviso and sub section (2) to\nsection 23\ninasmuch as\n\nboth look to a period of five years for the purpose of acquiring a qualification\n\nviz., passing the TET test within a period of five years, under the circumstances\n\nset-out therein.\n\n48. Any doubt as to whether the first proviso would govern teachers who\n\nare already in service is put to rest through the proviso introduced by the\nRight\n\nof Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2017\n, which\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n106/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nreads as under;\n\n“Provided further that every teacher appointed or in position as on the\n31st March, 2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications as laid\ndown under sub-section (1), shall acquire such minimum qualifications\nwithin a period of four years from the date of commencement of the\nRight\nof Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2017\n\n(24 of 2017)”\n\n49. A reading of the above proviso would make it clear that every teacher\n\nappointed or in position as on 31.04.2015 and not possessing the minimum\n\nqualification shall acquire such minimum qualification within a period of four\n\nyears from 2017. The expression “for appointment” employed in sub sections\n\n(1) and (2) to\nSection 23\nwhen contrasted with every teacher “appointed”\n\nwould clearly indicate the fact that when the provisions were first introduced in\n\n2010 they were only looking at future appointments. However, the proviso\n\nintroduced in the year 2017 also looks to teachers “who are already in\n\nservice”. The expression “for appointment” is indicative of the fact that the\n\nteachers shall qualify for appointment which is to be made in future and\n\ntherefore it has to be prospective. If so, sub section (2) to\nSection 23\nof the Act\n\nhaving found to cover appointments made after the introduction, the proviso\n\nmust also apply only to the said class of candidates/teachers covered by sub\n\nsection (2) to\nSection 23\nof the Act.\n\n50.\nSection 23\nof the Act would make it clear that the intention of the\n\nLegislature to prescribe minimum qualifications for teachers was made while\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n107/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nbeing alive to the fact that there may be certain States which do not have\n\nadequate institutions offering courses or training in teacher education, or where\n\nteachers possessing minimum qualifications are not available in sufficient\n\nnumbers. It is in this context that the Proviso to\nSection 23(2)\nstates that a\n\nteacher who, at the commencement of this Act (understood to mean those\n\nappointed after the commencement of the Act), does not possess minimum\n\nqualifications as laid down under sub section (1), shall acquire such minimum\n\nqualification from five years. The legislature therefore has made it mandatory\n\nfor every teacher who at the time of commencement of the Act does not possess\n\nminimum qualifications as prescribed under the Act, to acquire the said\n\nminimum qualifications within a period of 5 years. The emphasis is on the\n\nwords “at the commencement of this Act” and hence, it needs to be examined\n\nwhether the legislature intended to apply the new qualifications to teachers\n\nwho are already in service at the commencement of the Act, or only to those to\n\nbe appointed after the commencement of the Act. Pursuant to the provisions of\n\nthe Act, the National Council Teacher Education (NCTE) issued a notification\n\ndated 23.08.2010 prescribing the minimum qualifications for teachers from\n\nClasses I to V- ‘Secondary Grade Teachers’ as well as for Classes VI to VIII-\n\n‘BT Assistant’. Apart from prescribing the minimum educational qualifications,\n\nthe important eligibility criteria added by way of the notification is – “Pass in\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n108/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nTeacher Eligibility Test (TET)”. This notification stated under paragraph 4 that\n\nteachers appointed prior to the date of this notification need not acquire the\n\nminimum qualification prescribed by the notifications. Under para 5 it has been\n\nstated that those teachers appointed after date of this notification but in whose\n\ncase the process of appointment was initiated prior to the date of this\n\nnotification would also be exempt from acquiring the minimum qualifications\n\nincluding Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) as prescribed under Para 1 of the\n\nnotification. The said Para 5 of the notification dated 23.08.2010 came to be\n\namended by the notification of the NCTE dated 29.07.2011 whereby Para 5\n\nwas substituted by Para 5(a) with the same provision while shifting the cut off\n\ndate from 23.08.2010 to 29.07.2011, meaning thereby that where the\n\nGovernment, Local Authority or School issued the advertisement to initiate the\n\nprocess of appointment prior to the date of this notification i.e., 29.07.2011\n\nsuch appointments may also be made in accordance with the NCTE\n\nRegulations 2001 i.e., exempting them from acquiring TET for appointment as\n\nthe teacher.\n\n51. At this juncture, we may refer to some of the legal principles relating\n\nto the issue involved herein, qua the nature of employment under the\n\nGovernment and interpretation of provisions in a manner as to cause least\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n109/134\n\nWA.

The main object of\nArticle 16\nis to create a\nconstitutional right to equality of opportunity and employment in public\noffices. The words ‘employment’ or ‘appointment’ cover not merely the\ninitial appointment but also other attributes of service like promotion and\nage of superannuation, etc. The appointment to any post under the State\ncan only be made after a proper advertisement has been made inviting\napplications from eligible candidates and holding of selection by a body\nof experts or a specially constituted committee whose members are fair\nand impartial through a written examination or interview or some other\nrational criteria for judging the inter se merit of candidates who have\napplied in response to the advertisement made. A regular appointment to\na post under the State or Union cannot be made without issuing\nadvertisement in the prescribed manner which may in some cases include\ninviting applications from the employment exchange where eligible\ncandidates get their names registered. Any regular appointment made on\na post under the State or Union without issuing advertisement inviting\napplications from eligible candidates and without holding a proper\nselection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would\nviolate the guarantee enshrined under\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution.”\n\nState Employment is not mere contract\n\n55. The employment in the state is not only a contract, but also a status\n\nacquired by the employee. The salary and duration of work by the government\n\nservant are governed by statute or statutory rules which may be framed by the\n\nGovernment. In this context, the following decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n111/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\ncourt are of relevance and the observations made thereunder are usefully\n\nextracted below:\n\n(\ni) Dinesh Chandra Sangma v. State of Assam\n[(1977) 4 SCC 441]\n\n”The above is a special provision which deals with a special situation\nwhere a contract is entered into between the Government and a person\nappointed under the Constitution to hold a civil post. But simply because\nthere may be, in a given case, a contractual employment, as envisaged\nunder\nArticle 310(2)\nof the Constitution, the relationship of all other\ngovernment servants, as a class, and the Government, cannot be said to\nbe contractual. It is well-settled that except in the case of a person who\nhas been appointed under a written contract, employment under the\nGovernment is a matter of status and not of contract even though it may\nbe said to have started, initially, by a contract in the sense that the offer\nof appointment is accepted by the employee.”\n\n(\nii) Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India\n[(1968) 1 SCR 185]\n\n“It is true that the origin of Government service is contractual. There is\nan offer and acceptance in every case. But once appointed to his post or\noffice the Government servant acquires a status and his rights and\nobligations are no longer determined by consent of both parties, but by\nstatute or statutory rules which may be framed and altered unilaterally by\nthe Government. In other words, the legal position of a Government\nservant is more one of status than of contract. The hallmark of status is\nthe attachment to a legal relationship of rights and duties imposed by the\npublic law and not by mere agreement of the parties. The emolument of\nthe Government servant and his terms of service are governed by statute\nor statutory rules which may be unilaterally altered by the Government\nwithout the consent of the employee. It is true that\nArticle 311\nimposes\nconstitutional restrictions upon the power of removal granted to the\nPresident and the Governor under\nArticle 310.\nBut it is obvious that the\nrelationship between the Government and its servant is not like an\nordinary contract of service between a master and servant. The legal\nrelationship is something entirely different, something in the nature of\nstatus. It is much more than a purely contractual relationship voluntarily\nentered into between the parties. The duties of status are fixed by the law\nand in the enforcement of these duties society has an interest. In the\nlanguage of jurisprudence status is a condition of membership of a group\nof which powers and duties are exclusively determined by law and not by\nagreement between the parties concerned. The matter is clearly stated by\nSalmond and Williams on Contracts as follows:\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n112/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n“So we may find both contractual and status-obligations\nproduced by the same transaction. The one transaction may result\nin the creation not only of obligations defined by the parties and\nso pertaining to the sphere of contract but also and concurrently\nof obligations defined by the law itself, and so pertaining to the\nsphere of status. A contract of service between employer and\nemployee, while for the most part pertaining exclusively to the\nsphere of contract, pertains also to that of status so far as the law\nitself has seen fit to attach to this relation compulsory incidents,\nsuch as liability to pay compensation for accidents. The extent to\nwhich the law is content to leave matters within the domain of\ncontract to be determined by the exercise of the autonomous\nauthority of the parties themselves, or thinks fit to bring the\nmatter within the sphere of status by authoritatively determining\nfor itself the contents of the relationship, is a matter depending on\nconsiderations of public policy. In such contracts as those of\nservice the tendency in modern times is to withdraw the matter\nmore and more from the domain of contract into that of status.”\n(Salmond and Williams on Contracts, 2nd Edn. p. 12).\n\n(\niii) State of H.P. v. Raj Kumar\n[(2023) 3 SCC 773]\n\n“26. Though the relationship between the employee and the State\noriginates in contract, but by virtue of the constitutional constraint,\ncoupled with the legislative and executive rules governing the service, the\nrelation attains a unique position.\nIdentifying such a relationship as\nbeing a “status”, as against a contract, this Court in Roshan Lal Tandon\nv. Union of India [Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India, (1968) 1 SCR\n185 : AIR 1967 SC 1889], explained what such a “status” constitutes.\n\nWe have extracted hereinbelow the exposition of the concept of “status”\nas explained by the Constitution Bench for ready reference. .......It is true\nthat the origin of government service is contractual. There is an offer and\nacceptance in every case. But once appointed to his post or office the\ngovernment servant acquires a status and his rights and obligations are\nno longer determined by consent of both parties, but by statute or\nstatutory rules which may be framed and altered unilaterally by the\nGovernment. In other words, the legal position of a government servant\nis more one of status than of contract. The hallmark of status is the\nattachment to a legal relationship of rights and duties imposed by the\npublic law and not by mere of the parties. The emolument of the\ngovernment servant and his terms of service are governed by statute or\nstatutory rules which may be unilaterally altered by the Government\nwithout the consent of the employee. It is true that\nArticle 311\nimposes\nconstitutional restrictions upon the power of removal granted to the\nPresident and the Governor under\nArticle 310.\nBut it is obvious that the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n113/134\n\nWA.

The legal\nrelationship is something entirely different, something in the nature of\nstatus. It is much more than a purely contractual relationship voluntarily\nentered into between the parties. The duties of status are fixed by the law\nand in the enforcement of these duties, society has an interest.”\n\nState as a Model Employer\n\n56. The Government being an employer, must act in accordance with the\n\nrules and regulations framed by it. It should respond the legitimate aspirations\n\nof the employees and create trustworthiness to them. The Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nBhupendra Nath Hazarika v. State of Assam\n[(2013) 2 SCC 516]\n\npointed out the same in the following ways:\n\n“State is a model employer and it is required to act fairly giving due\nregard and respect to the rules framed by it. We have stated the role of\nthe State as a model employer with the fond hope that in future a\ndeliberate disregard is not taken recourse to and deviancy of such\nmagnitude is not adopted to frustrate the claims of the employees. It\nshould always be borne in mind that legitimate aspirations of the\nemployees are not guillotined and a situation is not created where hopes\nend in despair. Hope for everyone is gloriously precious and a model\nemployer should not convert it to be deceitful and treacherous by playing\na game of chess with their seniority. A sense of calm sensibility and\nconcerned sincerity should be reflected in every step. An atmosphere of\ntrust has to prevail and when the employees are absolutely sure that their\ntrust shall not be betrayed and they shall be treated with dignified\nfairness then only the concept of good governance can be concretised.\nThat public employment is a facet of right to equality envisaged under\n\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution of India and that the recruitment rules are\nframed with a view to give equal opportunity to all the citizens of India\nentitled for being considered for recruitment in the vacant posts. As a\nmodel employer the Government must conduct itself with high probity\nand candour with its employees, The main concern of the court in such\nmatters is to ensure the rule of law and to see that the Executive acts\nfairly and gives a fair deal to its employees consistent with the\nrequirements of\nArticles 14\nand 16.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n114/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nRule against retrospectivity\n\n57. It would be evident that the teachers who were appointed on the\n\nbasis of eligibility criteria set out during their employment prior to the\n\nintroduction of the Act and having secured employment and having been in the\n\nemployment for decades cannot now be required to satisfy the eligibility\n\ncriterion which is introduced in the year 2010. Any attempt to do so would\n\nresult in giving retrospective effect to the Act. This would warrant an\n\nexamination, whether the provisions under consideration can be given\n\nretrospective operation, when it does not expressly provide for the same. There\n\nis a presumption of prospectivity articulated in the legal maxima Nova\n\nConstitutio Futuris Formam Imponere Debet, Non Praeteritis that is “a new\n\nlaw ought to regulate what is to follow, not the past”. It is trite law that any\n\nprovision or statute dealing with substantive rights is prospective unless it is\n\nexpressly or by necessary implication made to have retrospective operation as\n\nheld in\nMahadeolal Kanodia v. Administrator-General of W.B.\n, (\n1960) 3\n\nSCR 578 and CIT v. Vatika Township (P) Ltd.\n, (2015) 1 SCC 1 at page 21,\n\nthe relevant passage of which are quoted below for ready reference:\n\n(\ni) Mahadeolal Kanodia v. Administrator-General of W.B.\n[(1960) 3 SCR\n\n578]\n\n“8.The principles that have to be applied for interpretation of statutory\nprovisions of this nature are well-established. The first of these is that\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n115/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nstatutory provisions creating substantive rights or taking away\nsubstantive rights are ordinarily prospective; they are retrospective only if\nby express words or by necessary implication the legislature has made\nthem retrospective; and the retrospective operation will be limited only to\nthe extent to which it has been so made by express words, or necessary\nimplication. The second rule is that the intention of the legislature has\nalways to be gathered from the words used by it, giving to the words their\nplain, normal, grammatical meaning. The third rule is that if in any\nlegislation, the general object of which is to benefit a particular class of\npersons, any provision is ambiguous so that it is capable of two\nmeanings, one which would preserve the benefit and another which would\ntake it away, the meaning which preserves it should be adopted. The\nfourth rule is that if the strict grammatical interpretation gives rise to an\nabsurdity or inconsistency such interpretation should be discarded and an\ninterpretation which will give effect to the purpose the Legislature may\nreasonably be considered to have had will be put on the words, if\nnecessary even by modification of the language used.”\n\n(\nii) CIT v. Vatika Township (P) Ltd.\n[(2015) 1 SCC 1 at page 21]\n\n“28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to be interpreted,\none established rule is that unless a contrary intention appears, a\nlegislation is presumed not to be intended to have a retrospective\noperation. The idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern\ncurrent activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of the past.\n\nIf we do something today, we do it keeping in view the law of today and in\nforce and not tomorrow's backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the\nnature of the law is founded on the bedrock that every human being is\nentitled to arrange his affairs by relying on the existing law and should not\nfind that his plans have been retrospectively upset. This principle of law is\nknown as lex prospicit non respicit: law looks forward not backward. As\nwas observed in Phillips v. Eyre [(1870) LR 6 QB 1] , a retrospective\nlegislation is contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the\nconduct of mankind is to be regulated when introduced for the first time to\ndeal with future acts ought not to change the character of past\ntransactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.”\n\n58. Thus, it could be inferred from the above that when Parliament in its\n\nwisdom has made the provisions of the Act only prospective, it would not be\n\nopen through a process of interpretation by courts or on the basis of\n\ninterpretation/understanding by the executive or a subordinate legislation to\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n116/134\n\nWA.

Any attempt to suggest that the subordinate legislation must be\n\nunderstood as imposing a condition which requires the teachers who were in\n\nservice to clear the test despite the fact that plenary legislation in the form of\n\nRTE Act\ndoes not provide for the same would render the subordinate legislation\n\nbad for it is settled principle that any subordinate legislation ought to be in\n\nconfirmity with the parent Act as well as other plenary legislation. The\n\ndecisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to below explained the same.\n\n(\ni) Shri Sitaram Sugar Ltd v. Union of India\n[(1990) 3 SCC 223)]\n\n“45. Power delegated by statute is limited by its terms and subordinate to\nits objects. The delegate must act in good faith, reasonably, intra vires the\npower granted, and on relevant consideration of material facts. All his\ndecisions, whether characterised as legislative or administrative or quasi-\njudicial, must be in harmony with the Constitution and other laws of the\nland. They must be \"reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling\nlegislation\".\nSee Leila Mourning v. Family Publications Service, 411 US\n356, 36 L Ed. 2d 318. If they are manifestly unjust or oppressive or\noutrageous or directed to an unauthorised end or do not tend in some\ndegree to the accomplishment of the objects of delegation, courts might\nwell say, \"Parliament never intended to give authority to make such rules;\nthey are unreasonable and ultra vires\", per Lord Russel of Killowen, C.J.\nin Kruse v. Johnson, [1988] 2 Q.B. 91.”\n\n(\nii) State of Tamil Nadu & Ors. vs P. Krishnamurthy & Ors\n[(2006) 4 SCC\n\n517]\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n117/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n“12. There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality or validity of a\nsub-ordinate Legislation and the burden is upon him who attacks it to\nshow that it is invalid. It is also well recognized that a sub-ordinate\nlegislation can be challenged under any of the following grounds:-\n\na) Lack of legislative competence to make the sub-ordinate legislation.\n\nb) Violation of Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution of\nIndia.\n\nc) Violation of any provision of the Constitution of India.\n\nd) Failure to conform to the Statute under which it is made or exceeding\nthe limits of authority conferred by the enabling Act.\n\ne) Repugnancy to the laws of the land, that is, any enactment.\n\nf) Manifest arbitrariness/unreasonableness (to an extent where court\nmight well say that Legislature never intended to give authority to make\nsuch Rules).\n\n60. The court considering the validity of a subordinate Legislation, will\n\nhave to consider the nature, object and scheme of the enabling Act, and also the\n\narea over which power has been delegated under the Act and then decide\n\nwhether the subordinate Legislation conforms to the parent Statute. Where a\n\nRule is directly inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the Statute, then, of\n\ncourse, the task of the court is simple and easy. But where the contention is\n\nthat the inconsistency or non-conformity of the Rule is not with reference to\n\nany specific provision of the enabling Act, but with the object and scheme of\n\nthe\nParent Act\n, the court should proceed with caution before declaring\n\ninvalidity.\n\nArbitrariness violates\nArticle 14:\nConstruction that avoids unjust, arbitrary and\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n118/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nabsurd results to be adopted\n\n61. It may be relevant to note that parliament would make laws which\n\nare just and reasonable, and that, there is also a presumption that Parliament\n\nwould frame laws which are constitutionally valid. To assume that the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 23\nof the Act are effective retrospectively, would result in\n\nrendering the provision vulnerable to challenge as offending\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution.\nIn this regard, it may be useful to note that manifest arbitrariness\n\nby itself is a ground to invalidate even plenary legislation as held in\nShayara\n\nBano v. Union of India\n, [(2017) 9 SCC 1], the relevant passage of which is\n\nusefully extracted below:\n\n“95...In particular, which stated that legislation can be struck down on the\nground that it is “arbitrary” under\nArticle 14\n, went on to conclude that\n“arbitrariness” when applied to legislation cannot be used loosely.\nInstead, it broad based the test, stating that if a constitutional infirmity is\nfound,\nArticle 14\nwill interdict such infirmity. And a constitutional\ninfirmity is found in\nArticle 14\nitself whenever legislation is “manifestly\narbitrary” i.e. when it is not fair, not reasonable, discriminatory, not\ntransparent, capricious, biased, with favouritism or nepotism and not in\npursuit of promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment.\nPositively speaking, it should conform to norms which are rational,\ninformed with reason and guided by public interest, etc.,”\n\nHardship, inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomaly to be avoided\n\n62. The Court will adopt that which is just, reasonable and sensible\n\nrather than what is none of those things.\nIn\nModern School v. Union of India\n,\n\n(2004) 5 SCC 583, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that a\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n119/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nconstruction that results in hardship, serious inconvenience, injustice, absurdity\n\nor anomaly or which leads to inconsistency or uncertainty and friction in the\n\nsystem which the statute purports to regulate has to be rejected and preference\n\nshould be given to that construction which avoids such results. This rule has no\n\napplication, when the words are susceptible to only one meaning and no\n\nalternative construction is reasonably open.\n\n63. In selecting out of different interpretations ‘the court will adopt that\n\nwhich is just, reasonable and sensible rather than that which is none of those\n\nthings’ as it may be presumed that 'the legislature should have used the word in\n\nthat interpretation which least offends our sense of justice’. If the grammatical\n\nconstruction leads to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with\n\nthe rest of the instrument, it may be departed from so as to avoid that\n\nabsurdity, and inconsistency. Similarly, a construction giving rise to anomalies\n\nshould be avoided as noted by the Supreme Court in\nN.T. Veluswami Thevar\n\nv. G. Raja Nainar\n[1959 Supp (1) SCR 623]\n\n“12.…… It is no doubt true that if on its true construction, a statute leads\nto anomalous results, the courts have no option but to give effect to it and\nleave it to the legislature to amend and alter the law. But when on a\nconstruction of a statute, two views are possible, one which results in an\nanomaly and the other, not, it is our duty to adopt the latter and not the\nformer, seeking consolation in the thought that the law bristles with\nanomalies. Anomalies will disappear, and the law will be found to be\nsimple and logical, if it is understood that when a question is raised in an\nelection petition as to the propriety of the rejection of a nomination paper,\nthe point to be decided is about the propriety of the nomination and not\nthe decision of the Returning Officer on the materials placed before him,\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and that decision must depend on whether the candidate is duly qualified\n\n120/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nand is not subject to any disqualifications as provided in\nSection 36(2)\n.\n\nFurther, as approved by Venkatarama Aiyar, J., in\nTirath Singh v.\nBachittar Singh\n, (1955) 2 SCR 457\n“….Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning\nand grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction\nof the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some\ninconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, presumably not\nintended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies the\nmeaning of the words, and even the structure of the sentence”.\n(Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edn., p. 229). Reading\nthe proviso along with clause (b) thereto, and construing it in its\nsetting in the section, we are of opinion that notwithstanding the\nwideness of the language used, the proviso contemplates notice\nonly to persons who are not parties to the petition.”\n\n64. Legislature must be presumed to enact laws that are just, fair and\n\nreasonable and in society's interest, unless it is explicitly intended to result in\n\nany harsh or ridiculous effect. The words of K.S. Hedge, J. as held in\nBhudan\n\nSingh v. Nabi Bux\n, [(1969) 2 SCC 481 at page 485], reads as under:\n\n“9.Before considering the meaning of the word “held” in\nSection 9\n, it is\nnecessary to mention that it is proper to assume that the law makers who are\nthe representatives of the people enact laws which the society considers as\nhonest, fair and equitable. The object of every legislation is to advance public\nwelfare. In other words as observed by Crawford in his book on “Statutory\nConstructions” that the entire legislative process is influenced by\nconsiderations of justice and reason. Justice and reason constitute the great\ngeneral legislative intent in every peace of legislation. Consequently where the\nsuggested construction operates harshly, ridiculously or in any other manner\ncontrary to prevailing conceptions of justice and reason, in most instance, it\nwould seem that the apparent or suggested meaning of the statute, was not the\none intended by the law makers. In the absence of some other indication that\nthe harsh or ridiculous effect was actually intended by the legislature, there is\nlittle reason to believe that it represents the legislative intent.”\n\nAny interpretation that would lead to absurdity has to be avoided, according to\n\nthe rules of interpretation (Central India Spg., Wvg. & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v.\n\nMunicipal Committee, 1958 SCR 1102). Therefore, a construction resulting in\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n121/134\n\nWA.

No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nproduces results which are absurd / obnoxious in as much as it could result in\n\nmore than a lakh of teachers being unemployed. It would also have the ripple\n\neffect of affecting the careers of students inasmuch as it is impossible to find\n\nadequate alternate hands to impart education. Inasmuch as applying the above\n\ndata, it would require at least 30,00,000 people to take part in TET exams to\n\nhave a lakh of teachers clearing TET thereby qualifying for appointment.\n\n66. It is also relevant to note that the legislature is presumed to\n\nunderstand and appreciate the needs of its own people and that its laws are\n\ndirected towards problems realized through experience [Refer:\nRam Krishna\n\nDalmia v. SR Tendolkar\n, 1959 SCR 279 para 11]. It cannot be\n\noveremphasized that experience is also important and Parliament must be\n\nimputed with the wisdom that experience is relevant and therefore the\n\nlegislature ensured that the provisions are only prospective and not\n\nretrospective, if we bear the above data in mind, the consequences that could\n\npossibly result in treating TET examinations as applying even in respect of\n\nteachers who are already in services at the time of introduction of TET, would\n\nproduce results which are absurd and obnoxious something which ought to be\n\navoided.\n\nIn this regard it may be useful to refer to the judgment of the Supreme\n\nCourt in\nSirsi Municipality v. Cecelia Kom Francis Tellis\n, [(1973) 1 SCC\n\n409], to understand what is their nature of appointment and the consequences\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n123/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nof terminating them in view of the non-fulfillment of an eligibility criteria\n\nintroduced subsequent to their appointment.\n\nHardship to those in employment to be avoided\n\n67. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Girjesh Shrivastava v. State of M.P.\n\n[(2010) 10 SCC 707] found that cancellation of appointment after long period\n\nwhich would result in large number of people being unemployed is arbitrary\n\nand undesirable also in view of the fact that they would have left their previous\n\nemployment and would have reached an age where the prospects of them\n\nfinding another job are rather dim and all this if taken into account\n\ncumulatively would indicate that the provisions of the Act in the first place is\n\nonly prospective on a plain reading of the provisions and any attempt to\n\nsuggest that it must be given retrospective effect ought to be rejected for it\n\nwould fall foul of\nArticle 14\n, 16\nand\n19 (1)(g)\nof the Constitution. The relevant\n\nparagraph of the said decision is profitably reproduced as under:\n\n“31. More importantly, in deciding these issues, the High Court should\nhave been mindful of the fact that an order for cancellation of\nappointment would render most of the appellants unemployed. Most of\nthem were earlier teaching in non-formal education centres, from where\nthey had resigned to apply in response to the advertisement. They had left\ntheir previous employment in view of the fact that for their three-year\nlong teaching experiences, the interview process in the present selection\nwas awarding them grace marks of 25%. It had also given them a\nrelaxation of 8 years with respect to their age. Now, if they lose their jobs\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n124/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nas a result of the High Court's order, they would be effectively\nunemployed as they cannot even revert to their earlier jobs in the non-\nformal education centres, which have been abolished since then. This\nwould severely affect the economic security of many families. Most of\nthem are between the age group of 35-45 years, and the prospects for\nthem of finding another job are rather dim. Some of them were in fact\nawaiting their salary raise at the time of quashing of their appointment by\nthe High Court.”\n\n68. Reverting to the present case, pursuant to the said Act as well as\n\nnotification issued by the NCTE the State Government issued G.O.Ms.No.181\n\nSchool Education (C2) Department dated 15.11.2011, wherein, in paragraph 3,\n\nit has been mentioned as follows:\n\n“3.The said section clearly specifies that teachers who at the\ncommencement of this Act, do not possess minimum qualifications as\nprescribed by the academic authority authorized by the central\ngovernment shall acquire such minimum qualifications within a period of\n5 years. Hence, the “Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)” would have to be\nconducted for recruiting teachers for the primary and upper primary\nclasses. The teachers working in unaided private schools are required to\npass teacher Eligibility Test within 5 years. In the State of Tamil Nadu,\nSecondary Grade teachers (those teaching classes I to V) are required to\nhave minimum qualifications of D.T.Ed. and graduate Assistants (BT\nAssistant) (those teaching classes VI to VIII) are required to have\nminimum qualifications of B.Ed. they should also pass Teacher Eligibility\nTest forthwith.”\n\n69. A reading of the provisions of the Act read with the NCTE\n\nNotifications as stated above would make it clear that all those appointed prior\n\nto the notification dated 29.07.2011 can continue in service as Secondary\n\nGrade Teachers or BT Assistants as the case may be, without acquiring TET.\n\nThey can be granted their increments and other monetary benefits. To this\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n125/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nextent, the language employed in G.O.(Ms.)No.181 dated 15.11.2011 is to be\n\nread and understood to the effect that for continuance in service without\n\npromotional prospects, TET is not mandatory. The time-limit granted for\n\nacquiring a pass in TET is applicable only for those who have been appointed\n\nafter the commencement of the Act, and who for the reasons stated in\nSection\n\n23(2)\nof the Act, were appointed without qualifying in TET. The amendment to\n\nthe\nRTE Act\non 09.08.2017 by Act No. 24 of 2017 with effect from 01.04.2015\n\nby inserting the following Second proviso to the\nSection 23(2)\nof the RTE Act,\n\nreads as follows:\n\n“23(2) …\nProvided further that every teacher appointed or in position as on the\n31st March 2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications as laid\ndown under sub-section(1), shall acquire such minimum qualifications\nwithin a period of four years from the date of commencement of the\n\nRight of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act,\n”.\n\nThe aforesaid proviso is also to be read in the same manner as being applicable\n\nonly for those who have been appointed after the commencement of the Act,\n\nand who for the reasons stated in\nSection 23(2)\nof the Act, were appointed\n\nwithout qualifying in TET. The words “every teacher appointed or in position\n\nas on the 31st March 2015” would clear any semblance of doubt as to the\n\ncategory of persons whom it refers to, meaning thereby that every teacher\n\nappointed after the Act and who is in service as on 31st March 2015 has been\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n126/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nmandated under the Act to acquire the minimum qualifications within a period\n\nof four years from the date of commencement of the amendment Act of 2017\n\n(.i.e., Act 24 of 2017) to the\nRTE Act\nw.e.f 01.04.2015. It is to be seen that the\n\nquestion whether teachers appointed prior to the notification of the NCTE\n\ndated 29.07.2011 would require to pass the TET for continuing in service came\n\nup for consideration in\nM.Maharani v. The State of Tamilnadu and Ors\n.\n\n[MANU/TN/0608/2019] wherein it has been held as follows:\n\n“….\n\n10. However, there is no cut-off date specified in the said G.O. Ms. No.\n181, with regard to acquiring the qualification of pass TET to continue in\nservice as B.T. Assistants /Secondary Grade Teachers, who are working as\nsuch in the respondent Schools. In this regard, a cursory glance at Clause\n(5) of the notification dated 23.08.2010 and its amended notification dated\n29.07.2011 issued by the NCTE, the contents of which are reproduced at\nparagraph nos. 8.2 and 8.4 above, would reveal that if the process of\nappointment of teachers was initiated prior to the date of notification by\nissuing advertisement, such appointments have to be made in accordance\nwith NCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualifications for Recruitment of\nTeachers in Schools) Regulations, 2001 and the same was amended with\neffect from 29.07.2011. As per the said NCTE Regulations 2001, there is\nno qualification prescribed with regard to possession of TET certificate,\nfor appointment to the post of B.T Assistant and Secondary Grade\nTeachers. The qualification of passing TET was first introduced by the\nnotification dated 23.08.2010 and it was amended vide notification dated\n27.09.2011. Thus, it could be inferred that the cut-off date for acquiring\nthe TET qualification is 27.09.2011 and the teachers, who were appointed\nprior to that date need not pass TET and even in the case of the teachers\nwho were appointed after that date, if the advertisement to initiate the\nprocess of appointment of teachers was made prior to that date, then,\ntheir appointments also can be in accordance with the NCTE Regulations\n2001 and they need not acquire the TET qualification.\n\n12. In the ultimate analysis, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the\npetitioners are entitled to seek exemption from passing TET, as they were\nappointed prior to the cut-off date and the respondents are directed not to\ninsist TET certificate from the petitioners as a pre-condition for their\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis continuance in service as B.T. Assistants.”\n\n127/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n70. The aforesaid judgment was also followed in\nV.Fathima Riswana\n\nand others v The Chief Educational Officer, Tirunelveli and Others\n\n[MANU/TN/4852/2020 dated 13.08.2020].\n\n71. In line with above reasoning, the orders of the learned Judge holding\n\nthat even those appointed prior to the commencement of the Act must acquire a\n\npass in TET is liable to be set aside. The Secondary Grade Teachers only\n\nseeking continuance in service with increments, are fundamentally a different\n\nclass of persons from those seeking promotion to B.T.Assistant from Secondary\n\nGrade Teacher.\n\n*C. W.A. Nos.19, 31, 32, 36 of 2023\n\nWHETHER TET IS A NECESSARY MANDATE FOR TEACHERS\nAPPOINTED IN MINORITY SCHOOLS\n\n71.1. A perusal of the orders impugned in the writ petitions leading to\n\nthese writ appeals would indicate that the fact that the teachers, in respect\n\nof whom approval of appointment was sought for by the school, did not\n\npossess TET pass eligibility was not a ground for refusal for grant of\n\nappointment approval, nor was it an issued raised before the Learned\n\nSingle Judge at the time of disposal of the writ petitions. Only in the writ\n\nappeals, the State Government has raised an additional ground that the\n\nteachers whose appointment approval was sought for, did not possess TET.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n128/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nNotwithstanding the same, it is hereby clarified that by virtue of the\n\njudgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\n\nPramati Educational and Cultural Trust & Ors. v. Union of India\n, [(2014) 8\n\nSCC 1], wherein it was held that the\nRTE Act, 2009\ninsofar as it applies to\n\nminority schools, aided or unaided, covered under\nArticle 30(1)\nis\n\nultravires the Constitution, meaning thereby that the 2009 Act will not\n\napply to minority schools, the eligibility of TET pass as required for\n\nappointment of teachers in non-minority schools, will not apply to minority\n\nschools. In other words, the approval of appointment of teachers in\n\nminority schools, both aided and unaided, cannot be refused or rejected on\n\nthe ground that they do not possess a pass in TET. Further this specific\n\nissue is also pending consideration before the Supreme Court and the law\n\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in Pramati Educational and Cultural\n\nTrust, cited supra, holds the field as on today. For these reasons, the order\n\nof the Learned Judge in the writ petitions is affirmed and the above four\n\nwrit appeals are dismissed.\n\n72. In the light of the above narration, taking note of the factual\n\nbackground, the legal provisions spelling out the intention of the legislature\n\nand the effect of the subordinate legislation pursuant thereto, the inescapable\n\nconclusion of this court would be that every teacher whether Secondary Grade\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n129/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nor BT Assistant, whether appointed by direct recruitment or promotion in the\n\ncase of BT Assistant, after the coming into force of the\nRTE Act\nand the NCTE\n\nnotifications must necessarily possess/acquire the eligibility of a pass in TET.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Secondary Grade Teachers appointed prior to the\n\ncommencement of the Act and notifications will now be eligible for promotion\n\nto the post of BT Assistant without passing TET, cannot be countenanced. For\n\nany fresh appointments, whether by direct recruitment in the case of Secondary\n\nGrade Teachers, or by either direct recruitment or promotion or transfer in the\n\nGraduate Assistants/BT Assistants, a pass in TET is an essential eligibility\n\ncriteria to be fulfilled.\n\n73. Further, it is made clear that all those appointed prior to 29.07.2011\n\nare exempt from passing TET only for the purpose of continuance in the post of\n\nsecondary grade teacher or BT Assistant without promotional prospects. Any\n\nappointments whether by direct recruitment or promotion or transfer made\n\nafter 29.07.2011, will have to necessarily adhere to the minimum eligibility\n\ncriteria of passing TET. *The principles\nlaid down in\nthis judgment will not\n\nhave application to minority schools, both aided and unaided as explained\n\nin paragraph no.71.1.\n\nCONCLUSION\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n130/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\n74. For the sake of clarity and ease of reference, the upshot of the above\n\ndiscussion is as under:\n\n(a) Any teacher appointed as Secondary Grade Teacher or Graduate\n\nTeacher/BT Assistant prior to 29.07.2011 shall continue in service and also\n\nreceive increments and incentives, even if they do not possess/acquire a pass in\n\nTET. At the same time, for future promotional prospects like promotion from\n\nsecondary grade teacher to B.T. Assistant as well as for promotion to\n\nHeadmasters, etc., irrespective of their dates of original appointment, they must\n\nnecessarily possess TET, failing which they will not be eligible for promotion.\n\n(b) Any appointment made to the post of Secondary Grade Teacher\n\nafter 29.07.2011 must necessarily possess TET.\n\n(c) Any appointment made to Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant, after\n\n29.07.2011, whether by direct recruitment or promotion from the post of\n\nSecondary Grade Teacher, or transfer, must necessarily possess TET. *The\n\nprinciples\nlaid down in\nthis judgment will not have application to minority\n\nschools, both aided and unaided as explained in paragraph no.71.1.\n\n(d) The Special Rules for the Tamil Nadu School Educational\n\nSubordinate Service issued in GO (Ms.) No.13 School Education (S.E3(1))\n\nDepartment dated 30.01.2020 insofar as it prescribes “a pass in Teacher\n\nEligibility Test (TET)” only for direct recruitment for the post of BT Assistant\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n131/134\n\nWA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch\n\nand not for promotion thereto in Annexure-I (referred to in Rule 6) is struck\n\ndown, thereby meaning that TET is mandatory/essential eligibility criterion for\n\nappointment to the post of BT Assistant even by promotion from Secondary\n\nGrade Teachers.\n\n(e) The language employed in G.O. (Ms) No. 181 dated 15.11.2011\n\nis to be read and understood to the effect that for continuance in service\n\nwithout promotional prospects, TET is not mandatory.\n\n75. The narration of facts which propelled this case would indicate that\n\nthe teachers have not been appointed for the last ten years inspite of being\n\nqualified with a pass in TET. On the basis of the above findings and\n\nobservations made, the State Government is directed to conduct TET\n\nperiodically and make direct recruitment of teachers and promotion from\n\namong TET qualified candidates at the earliest.\n\n76. With these observations, Writ Petition Nos.3364 and 3368 of 2023\n\nare allowed, Writ Appeal Nos. 313, 833, 1891, 2050, 2082, 2795 of 2022 &\n\nWrit Appeal Nos.19, 31, 32, 36 of 2023 are dismissed.
