Appellant\n\n versus\n\nState of Gujarat & Others ... Respondents\n\n J U D G M E N T \n\nAftab Alam,J.\n\n1. Leave granted.\n\n2. The question that once again arises before this Court is \n\nwhat would be the status of a person, one of whose parents \n\nbelongs to the scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and the other \n\ncomes from the upper castes, or more precisely does not come \n\nfrom scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and what would be the \n\n\f\nentitlement of a person from such parents to the benefits of \n\naffirmative action sanctioned by the Constitution. The Gujarat \n\nHigh Court has proceeded on the basis that the issue is settled \n\nby the decisions of this Court in \nValsamma Paul v. Cochin \n\nUniversity and others\n, (1996) 3 SCC 545 followed by \nPunit Rai \n\nv. Dinesh Chaudhary\n, (2003) 8 SCC 204 and Anjan Kumar v. \n\nUnion of India and others, (2006) 3 SCC 257. On the strength \n\nof those three decisions the High Court upheld the order \n\npassed by the Scrutiny Committee cancelling the tribal \n\ncertificate earlier obtained by the appellant on the sole ground \n\nthat his father was a non-tribal, belonging to the Hindu caste \n\nKshatriya. The High Court did not advert to the fact that the \n\nmother of the appellant was undeniably a Nayak, one of the \n\nscheduled tribes and the appellant himself and his other \n\nsiblings were also married to Nayaks. The High Court also did \n\nnot refer to the evidences adduced by the appellant on the \n\nquestion of his upbringing as a member of the Nayak \n\ncommunity and his acceptance in that community (or for that \n\nmatter the contra evidence produced by the respondent \n\n\f\nquestioning his claim to be a member of the scheduled tribe). In \n\nview of the fact that his father was a non-tribal, the High Court \n\ndeemed everything else as of no relevance and declined to \n\nrecord any finding on whether the appellant was, in fact, \n\nbrought up as a tribal and, consequently, shared all the \n\nindignities and handicaps and deprivations normally suffered by \n\nthe tribal communities.\n\n3. The appellant, thus, lost his tribal certificate and the Fair \n\nPrice shop that was allotted to him on that basis. He has now \n\nbrought the matter to this Court making the grievance that the \n\nHigh Court order does not impact him alone but as a result of \n\nthe order of the High Court his children too, though \n\nundisputedly born to a tribal mother, are bound to lose their \n\ntribal identity.\n\n4. The High Court seems to have read the decisions in \n\nValsamma Paul, Punit Rai and Anjan Kumar as laying down the \n\nrule that in all cases and regardless of other considerations the \n\noffspring of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a \n\ntribal and a non-tribal would take his/her caste from the father. \n\n\f\nIn the three decisions there are indeed observations (though by \n\nno means forming the ratio of the decisions) that may lend \n\ncredence to such a view but the question is whether it can be \n\nsaid to flow from those decisions, as an inflexible rule of \n\ngeneral application, that in every case of inter-caste marriage or \n\nmarriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, the offspring must \n\ntake his/her caste from the father. The clear answer, to our \n\nmind, is in the negative. A careful examination of the three \n\ncases together with some other decisions of this Court would \n\nclearly show that what was said in Valsamma in a certain \n\ncontext has been rather mechanically and inappropriately \n\nextended and applied to different other fact situations as the \n\nlaw laid down in Valsamma. \n\n5. Valsamma was a Syrian Catholic woman (forward caste) \n\nwho married a Latin Catholic man (backward class) and the \n\nquestion arose whether by virtue of her marriage she was \n\nentitled to appointment to a post of lecturer that was reserved \n\nfor Latin Catholics (Backward Class Fishermen). The full bench \n\nof the Kerala High Court held that though Valsamma was \n\n\f\nmarried according to the Canon law, being a Syrian Christian by \n\nbirth, she could not by marriage with a Latin Catholic become a \n\nmember of that class nor could she claim the status of \n\nbackward class by marriage. Dealing with the consequences of \n\na woman marrying outside her caste the Court relied upon two \n\nold Privy Council decisions of the nineteenth century and came \n\nto hold that when a woman marries outside her caste, she \n\nbecomes a member of the caste of the husband's family. In \n\nparagraph 31 of the judgment in Valsamma the Court said:\n\n \"It is well-settled law from Bhoobum Moyee Debia v. Ram \n\n Kishore Acharj Chowdhry (1865) 10 MIA 279: 3 WR 15 that \n\n judiciary recognized a century and a half ago that a husband \n\n and wife are one under Hindu law, and so long as the wife \n\n survives, she is half of the husband. She is `Sapinda' of her \n\n husband as held in Lulloobhoy Bappoobhoy Cassidass \n\n Moolchund v. Cassibai (1879-80) 7IA 212 . It would, \n\n therefore, be clear that be it either under the Canon law or the \n\n Hindu law, on marriage the wife becomes an integral part of \n\n husband's marital home entitled to equal status of husband as \n\n a member of the family. Therefore, the lady, on marriage, \n\n becomes a member of the family and thereby she \n\n becomes a member of the caste to which she moved. \n\n The caste rigidity breaks down and would stand no \n\n impediment to her becoming a member of the family to \n\n which the husband belongs and she gets herself \n\n transplanted.\" \n\n (emphasis added)\n\n\f\n\n6. Having said that in an inter-caste marriage the woman \n\ntakes on the caste of her husband, the Court proceeded to \n\nconsider the next question which was, \"whether a lady marrying \n\na Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or OBC citizen, or one \n\ntransplanted by adoption or any other voluntary act, ipso facto, \n\nbecomes entitled to claim reservation under \nArticle 15(4)\n or \n\n16(4) as the case may be?\" This question the Court firmly \n\nanswered in the negative and in paragraph 34 of the judgment \n\nobserved and held as follows:-\n\n \n\"In \nMurlidhar Dayandeo Kesekar v. Vishwanath Pandu \n\n Barde\n 1995 supp.\n \n(\n2) SCC 549 and R. Chandevarappa v. \n\n State of Karnataka\n (1995) 6 SCC 309: JT (1995) 7 SC 93, \n\n this Court had held that economic empowerment is a \n\n fundamental right to the poor and the State is enjoined under \n\n \nArticles 15(3)\n, 46\n and \n39\n to provide them opportunities. Thus, \n\n education, employment and economic empowerment are some \n\n of the programmes the State has evolved and also provided \n\n reservation in admission into educational institutions, or in \n\n case of other economic benefits under \nArticles 15(4)\n and \n46\n, \n\n or in appointment to an office or a post under the State under \n\n \nArticle 16(4).\n Therefore, when a member is transplanted \n\n into the Dalits, Tribes and OBCs, he/she must of \n\n necessity also have had undergone the same handicaps, \n\n and must have been subjected to the same disabilities, \n\n disadvantages, indignities or sufferings so as to entitle \n\n the candidate to avail the facility of reservation. A \n\n candidate who had the advantageous start in life being \n\n born in Forward Caste and had march of advantageous \n\n life but is transplanted in Backward Caste by adoption or \n\n marriage or conversion, does not become eligible to the \n\n benefit of reservation either under \nArticle 15(4)\n or 16(4), \n\n\f\n as the case may be. Acquisition of the status of \n\n Scheduled Caste etc. by voluntary mobility into these \n\n categories would play fraud on the Constitution, and \n\n would frustrate the benign constitutional policy under \n\n \nArticles 15(4)\n and \n16(4)\n of the Constitution. \"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n7. Proceeding further, in paragraph 35 of the judgment, the \n\nCourt expressly held that acceptance by the community, a test \n\nthat was earlier applied by the Court in cases of conversion and \n\nreconversion, would have no application to judge Valsamma's \n\nclaim to the post reserved for Latin Catholics by virtue of her \n\nmarriage in that caste.\n\n8. The court, thus, gave two reasons for disallowing \n\nValsamma, the benefit of reservation under \nArticles 15\n \n& 16\n of \n\nthe Constitution; first, being born in a forward caste she had an \n\nadvantageous start in life and she had not gone through the \n\nsame disabilities, disadvantages, indignities or sufferings as \n\nother members of the backward class and secondly claiming \n\nthe benefits of reservation by getting transplanted into a \n\nbackward class by means of marriage, that is to say, through \n\nvoluntary mobility would amount to a fraud on the Constitution.\n\n\f\n\n9. On a careful reading of the judgment it becomes clear \n\nthat the ratio of the Valsamma decision lies in paragraph 34 of \n\nthe judgment as quoted above. What was said earlier in \n\nparagraph 31 of the judgment was in the facts of that case and \n\nit would be an error to take it as the ratio of the decision. More \n\nimportantly, it would be very wrong to take paragraph 31 of the \n\nValsamma judgment as a premise for drawing the corollary or \n\nthe deduction that the child born from an inter-caste marriage \n\nor a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal would invariably \n\ntake his caste from the father. But before examining Valsamma \n\nin any greater detail it would be useful to see how it was used, \n\napplied and \"improved upon\" in later decisions of the Court. \n\n10. Valsamma was a case of reservation under \nArticles 15\n \n& \n\n16\n of the Constitution. A case of reservation of seats in the \n\nLegislative Assembly under \nArticle 332\n of the Constitution came \n\nto be considered by a three judge bench of the Court in \nSobha \n\nHymavathi Devi v. Setti Gangadhara Swamy & Others\n (2005) 2 \n\nSCC 244. The case of Sobha Hymavathi Devi, in certain \n\naspects on facts, is very similar to Valsamma. The election of \n\n\f\nSobha to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from a \n\nconstituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes was challenged on \n\nthe ground that she belonged to a forward community, Patnaik \n\nSistu Karnam, and was, therefore, not qualified to contest the \n\nelection from the constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes. \n\nDenying the allegations of the election petitioner Sobha raised \n\nthree pleas; first, both her parents belonged to Scheduled \n\nTribes; secondly, in case her father was held to come from a \n\nforward caste she was actually brought up by her mother, who \n\nundeniably belonged to a scheduled tribe, as a member of the \n\ntribal community and thirdly she married a Scheduled Tribe \n\nperson and, therefore, became a member of the Scheduled \n\nTribe. She had, therefore, the status of a Scheduled Tribe and \n\nwas qualified to contest the election from the constituency \n\nreserved for the Scheduled Tribes. The Court examined \n\nSobha's first and second pleas fully in light of the factual \n\nevidence and came to reject the two pleas on the basis of the \n\nfindings of fact. Dealing with the second plea, in paragraph 8 of \n\nthe judgment, the Court held and observed as follows:-\n\n \"Elaborating her argument, learned counsel for the appellant \n\n contended that even though the appellant was born to Murahari \n\n Rao, a Sistu Karnam, she was still being treated as a member of \n\n the Bhagatha community to which her mother belonged and that \n\n she had married a person belonging to the Bhagatha \n\n community; that the Bhagatha community had always accepted \n\n her as belonging to that community and in such a situation, she \n\n must be considered to belong to the Bhagatha community, a \n\n Scheduled Tribe and hence eligible to contest from a \n\n constituency reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. That the \n\n appellant had married Appala Raju, her maternal uncle \n\n belonging to the Bhagatha community, is not in dispute. But the \n\n claim of the appellant that she was being brought up and \n\n was being recognised as a member belonging to the \n\n Bhagatha community, cannot be accepted in the face of \n\n the evidence discussed by the High Court including the \n\n documentary evidence relied on by it. The document Ext. \n\n 10 and the entry therein marked as Ext. X-11 relating to \n\n the appellant, show her caste as Sistu Karnam and not as \n\n Bhagatha. This entry was at an undisputed point of time. \n\n Moreover, the evidence also shows that she was always \n\n being educated at Vishakhapatnam and she was never \n\n living as a tribal in Bhimavaram village to which her \n\n mother's family belongs. There is no reason for us to \n\n differ from the conclusion of the High Court on this \n\n aspect.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n11. It was only then that the Court considered the third plea of \n\nSobha that having married a person belonging to a Scheduled \n\nTribe she had acquired membership of that community and \n\nconsequently she must be treated as a member of the \n\nScheduled Tribe. Dealing with this plea the Court referred to the \n\ndecision in Valsamma and applied it to the case of reservation \n\nof a seat in the Legislative Assembly under \nArticle 332\n of the \n\n\f\nConstitution. In Paragraph 10 of the judgment the Court held \n\nand observed as follows:-\n\n \n\"Even otherwise, we have difficulty in accepting the position \n\n that a non-tribal who marries a tribal could claim to contest a \n\n seat reserved for tribals. \nArticle 332\n of the Constitution speaks \n\n of reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Legislative \n\n Assemblies. The object is clearly to give representation in the \n\n Legislature to Scheduled Tribe candidates, considered to be \n\n deserving of such special protection. To permit a non-tribal \n\n under cover of a marriage to contest such a seat would \n\n tend to defeat the very object of such a reservation. The \n\n decision of this Court in \nValsamma Paul v. Cochin \n\n University\n supports this view. Neither the fact that a non-\n\n backward female married a backward male nor the fact \n\n that she was recognised by the community thereafter as \n\n a member of the backward community, was held to \n\n enable a non-backward to claim reservation in terms of \n\n \nArticle 15(4)\n or 16(4) of the Constitution. ...Thereafter, this \n\n Court noticed that recognition by the community was also \n\n important. Even then, this Court categorically laid down that \n\n the recognition of a lady as a member of a backward \n\n community in view of her marriage would not be relevant for \n\n the purpose of entitlement to reservation under \nArticle 16(4)\n of \n\n the Constitution for the reason that she as a member of the \n\n forward caste, had an advantageous start in life and a \n\n marriage with a male belonging to a backward class would not \n\n entitle her to the facility of reservation given to a backward \n\n community. The High Court has applied this decision to a \n\n seat reserved in an election in terms of \nArticle 332\n of the \n\n Constitution. We see no reason why the principle relating \n\n to reservation under \nArticles 15(4)\n and 16(4\n) \nlaid down \n\n by\n this Court should not be extended to the \n\n constitutional reservation of a seat for a Scheduled Tribe \n\n in the House of the People or under \nArticle 332\n in the \n\n Legislative Assembly.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n\f\n\n12. What is of importance in Sobha Hymavathi Devi is that \n\nthe Court did not take the fact that Sobha's father was a man of \n\nforward caste as conclusive of her caste status. The Court did \n\nnot shut out the plea raised by Sobha that she must be \n\nconsidered as belonging to the scheduled tribe because her \n\nmother who was herself a tribal brought her up as a member of \n\nher community and raised her as a tribal even though her father \n\nmight have come from a forward caste. On the contrary the \n\nCourt examined the plea raised by Sobha in light of evidences \n\nadduced by the parties and negated it on the basis of a pure \n\nfinding of fact. Though the Court referred to and approved \n\nValsamma for rejecting Sobha's plea that she had acquired the \n\nstatus of a tribal by virtue of her marriage to a tribal man, it did \n\nnot take Valsamma as an authority that in a marriage between \n\na tribal and a non-tribal, the caste of the father would be \n\ndeterminative of the caste of the child. \n\n13. The third plea raised by Sobha in support of her being a \n\ntribal and the claim of Valsamma were both based on their \n\nvoluntary action in marrying a tribal man. In both cases the \n\n\f\nCourt held that getting transplanted into the tribal community \n\nthrough voluntary mobility cannot be the basis for the Forward \n\ncaste/non-tribal woman to avail of the benefits of reservation \n\nunder \nArticle 15\n \n& 16 (in Valsamma)\n or under \nArticle 332\n of the \n\nConstitution (in Sobha Hymavathi Devi). But in neither of the \n\ntwo cases the question of a child born of an inter-caste \n\nmarriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal was \n\ndirectly in issue. \n\n14. This question came up directly for consideration in \nPunit \n\nRai v. Dinesh Chaudhary\n (2003) 8 SCC 204. The election of \n\nDinesh Chaudhary (the respondent in the appeal before this \n\nCourt) to Bihar Legislative Assembly from a constituency \n\nreserved for scheduled castes was challenged on the ground \n\nthat he was born to Kurmi parents and he did not belong to any \n\nscheduled castes. The respondent did not deny that his father \n\nBhagwan Singh was a Kurmi and he was married to a Kurmi \n\nwoman. He, however, set up the case that Bhagwan Singh had \n\ntaken a second wife Deo Kumari Devi who was a Pasi \n\n(scheduled caste) and he was born to Deo Kumari Devi from \n\n\f\nBhagwan Singh and he was, thus, fully eligible to contest from \n\nthe reserved constituency. He also relied upon a circular issued \n\nby the State of Bihar according to which a child born to a non-\n\nscheduled caste father and a scheduled caste mother would be \n\ncounted in the category of scheduled caste. A three-judge \n\nbench of the Court before which the case came up for hearing \n\nhanded down two separate, though concurring, judgments, one \n\nby Brijesh Kumar, J., speaking for himself and for V.N. Khare, \n\nCJ, and the other by Sinha, J. It is significant to note that the \n\njudgment by Brijesh Kumar,J. is based on the finding that the \n\nrespondent failed to establish that Bhagwan Singh had taken a \n\nPasi woman as the second wife and he was born to her from \n\nBhagwan Singh. The Court held that the fact that Bhagwan \n\nSingh was a Kurmi and he was married to a Kurmi woman \n\nbeing admitted, the election petitioner had discharged the onus \n\nand the burden now lay upon the respondent to establish that \n\nBhagwan Singh had married second time and his second wife \n\nwas a Pasi who had given birth to the respondent and the \n\nrespondent had completely failed to establish that. In \n\nparagraphs 14 and 15 of the judgment by the two judges it was \n\n\f\nobserved and held as follows:\n\n \"14. The case of the parties is clear from their pleadings and \n\n the evidence adduced by them as indicated above. The \n\n petitioner challenged the status of respondent Dinesh \n\n Chaudhary as a Scheduled Caste person belonging to the SC \n\n community. Precisely what was indicated in support of that \n\n case is that the father of Dinesh Chaudhary and Naresh \n\n Chaudhary is Bhagwan Singh who is Kurmi by caste married \n\n to Jago Devi, also a Kurmi lady. The High Court has also \n\n observed that a person born in a Kurmi family normally would \n\n be presumed that he is Kurmi by caste. In this background \n\n the initial burden of the petitioner would stand \n\n discharged and it would shift upon the respondent to \n\n prove his case which, in normal course of things, would \n\n be and is within his special knowledge. A case which has \n\n been set up by the respondent through his witnesses as well, \n\n that his father had taken a fancy to Deo Kumari Devi, a \n\n resident of Village Adai, who is Pasi by caste and married her, \n\n who gave birth to two children including the respondent, would \n\n normally be not in the knowledge of the people in general, \n\n particularly when according to the case of the respondent \n\n himself Jago Devi lived in another village and she was never \n\n brought from there by Bhagwan Singh. \nMore so, when \n\n Bhagwan Singh, a Kurmi by caste, is living with his wife Jago \n\n Devi, also a Kurmi, in their village Jehanabad. The best \n\n evidence, as also according to the High Court to prove the \n\n case of the respondent, was to produce Bhagwan Singh and \n\n Deo Kumari Devi but they have been withheld after being cited \n\n as witnesses for the respondent. These facts clearly make out \n\n a case for drawing an adverse inference that in case they had \n\n been produced they would not have supported the case of the \n\n respondent. Kundan Lal Rallaram v. Custodian, Evacuee \n\n Property AIR 1961 SC 1316, T.S. Murugesam Pillai v. M.D. \n\n Gnana Sambandha Pandara Sannadhi \nAIR 1917 PC 6 and \n\n Thiru John v. Returning Officer\n (1977) 3 SCC 540, may also \n\n be referred on the point.\n\n 15. ......Apart from the above, the appellant had also \n\n discharged his burden by proving the fact that the father of \n\n Respondent 1 is Bhagwan Singh, a Kurmi by caste married to \n\n Jago Devi, also a Kurmi by caste. The natural inference in \n\n\f\nsuch circumstances would be that the respondent would, in \n\nnormal course of events, be a Kurmi by caste. If there is \n\nanything contrary to the normal course of events, as pleaded \n\nin this case, of another marriage of Bhagwan Singh in some \n\nother village, namely, Adai with Deo Kumari Devi who never \n\ncame to live with Bhagwan Singh in his village nor Bhagwan \n\nSingh ever lived there. Such facts in the special knowledge of \n\nthe respondent have to be proved by him alone. The \n\nrespondent was under duty to prove his case both ways, \n\nnamely, in view of the special knowledge of facts pleaded and \n\nagain in view of the fact that the appellant had discharged his \n\ninitial burden of showing that the respondent was Kurmi by \n\ncaste being the son of Bhagwan Singh, a Kurmi married to \n\nJago Devi, also a Kurmi. The other decision which has been \n\nreferred to on behalf of the respondent is reported in \n\nDolgobinda Paricha v. Nimai Charan Misra AIR 1959 SC \n\n914. It in connection with the fact that the evidence of the \n\nbrother of Deo Kumari Devi that Bhagwan Singh had married \n\nher, was relevant for the purposes of relationship of one \n\nperson to another since the brother of Deo Kumari Devi, is a \n\nperson who is a member of the family or otherwise has special \n\nmeans of knowledge of the particular relationship. The \n\ndecision is in reference to \nSection 50\n of the Evidence Act. It \n\nmay be observed that the evidence of persons who belong to \n\nVillage Adai including the brother of Deo Kumari Devi have \n\nbeen examined by the respondent to establish the allegation of \n\nmarriage between Bhagwan Singh and Deo Kumari Devi. \n\nUndoubtedly, the evidence of the brother of Deo Kumari Devi \n\nwould be relevant for the relationship between Bhagwan Singh \n\nand Deo Kumari Devi but his evidence would not be of any \n\nhelp, in view of the adverse inference drawn under \nSection \n\n114(g)\n of the Evidence Act due to withholding of the best \n\nevidence available on the point. When the persons concerned \n\nare not coming forward to the Court to depose about the \n\nalleged relationship and an adverse inference has been drawn \n\nthat if they had come to the Court to depose, their evidence \n\nwould have gone against the respondent, in such \n\ncircumstances, there is no occasion to act upon the statement \n\nof DW 5, the brother of Deo Kumari Devi or other witnesses.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n\f\n\n15. Once again it is to be seen that the judgment by the two \n\njudges went into the facts of the case in detail and considered \n\nthe effect of the evidences led (or rather not led!) by the \n\nrespondent in support of his case. And again it was on a finding \n\nof fact that the Court held that the respondent failed to establish \n\nhis scheduled caste status. The judgment by two judges, like \n\nthe decision in Sobha Hymavathi Devi, did not proceed on the \n\nbasis that the respondent would get his caste from his father \n\nand his father being admittedly Kurmi the respondent could not \n\nhave a caste status other than Kurmi. The Court did not \n\ndisallow the respondent from taking the plea that he was the \n\nchild of a Pasi mother and, thus, belonged to a scheduled \n\ncaste. But in that endeavour the respondent failed on a finding \n\nof fact. \n\n16. It is equally important to note that the judgment by the two \n\njudges does not rule out the possibility of the child from an \n\ninter-caste marriage taking his/her caste status from the \n\nmother, if such a provision was made in a circular issued by the \n\n\f\nGovernment and, in paragraph 7 of the judgment, made the \n\nfollowing observations:-\n\n \"A person born in a Kurmi family, which details have been \n\n provided, would normally be taken to be a Kurmi by caste. But \n\n it is only in special circumstances, as may have been provided \n\n under a circular of the Government of Bihar, that the caste of \n\n the mother would be taken as the caste of the children, if she \n\n happens to be a Scheduled Caste, married to a non-\n\n Scheduled Caste.\" \n\n17. Sinha,J., the third member on the Bench wrote a \n\nseparate, though concurring judgment. He applied the test of \n\nacceptance by the community for rejecting the respondent's \n\nclaim that he qualified as a `Pasi' (scheduled caste). In \n\nparagraphs 33 and 34 of the judgment Sinha,J. observed as \n\nfollows-\n\n \"33. In the instant case there is nothing on record to show \n\n that the respondent has ever been treated to be a member of \n\n the Scheduled Caste. In fact evidence suggests that he has \n\n not been so treated. He as well as his brothers and other \n\n members of his family are married to persons belonging to his \n\n own caste i.e. \"Kurmi\". \n\n 34.There was no attempt on the part of the respondent herein \n\n to bring on record any material to the effect that he was treated \n\n as a member of the \"Pasi\" community. Furthermore, no \n\n evidence has been brought on record to show that the family \n\n of the respondent had adopted and had been practicing the \n\n customary traits and tenets of the \"Pasi\" community.\"\n\n\f\nSinha, J., however, proceeded to make certain other \n\nobservations and in paragraph 27 of the judgment he said as \n\nfollows:-\n\n \"27. The caste system in India is ingrained in the Indian \n\n mind. A person, in the absence of any statutory law, \n\n would inherit his caste from his father and not his \n\n mother even in a case of inter-caste marriage.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\nAnd in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the judgment as under:-\n\n \"41. Determination of caste of a person is governed by the \n\n customary laws. A person under the customary Hindu law \n\n would be inheriting his caste from his father. In this case, \n\n it is not denied or disputed that the respondent's father \n\n belonged to a \"Kurmi\" caste. He was, therefore, not a \n\n member of the Scheduled Caste. The caste of the father, \n\n therefore, will be the determinative factor in absence of \n\n any law.\"\n\nHere there is no reference to Valsamma but the connection is \n\nobvious. It is only the next logical step to what was said in \n\nparagraph 31 of Valsamma. If as a result of inter-caste \n\nmarriage the woman gets transplanted into the family of the \n\nhusband and takes her husband's caste it would logically follow \n\n\f\nthat the child born from the marriage can take his/her caste \n\nonly from the father. We shall presently consider the highly \n\nillogical consequences of this logical derivation but before that \n\nit needs to be noticed that Sinha, J. rejected the government \n\ncircular also that provided that the caste of the mother might be \n\ntaken as the caste of the child. In the same paragraph (41) \n\nSinha,J. observed: \n\n \" Reliance, however, has been placed upon a circular dated 3-\n\n 3-1978 said to have been issued by the State of Bihar which \n\n is in the following terms:\n\n \"Subject: Determination of the caste of a child born from a \n\n non-Scheduled Caste Hindu father and a Scheduled Caste \n\n mother.\n\n Sir,\n\n In the aforesaid subject as per instruction I have to \n\n state for the determination of a child born from a non-\n\n Scheduled Caste father and a Scheduled Caste mother, upon \n\n deliberation it has been decided that the child born from such \n\n parents will be counted in the category of Scheduled Caste.\n\n 2. In such cases before the issue of caste \n\n certificate there will be a legible enquiry by the Block \n\n Development Officer, Circle Officer/Block Welfare Officer.\" \n\n \n42. The said circular letter has not been issued by the \n\n State in exercise of its power under \nArticle 162\n of the \n\n Constitution of India. It is not stated therein that the decision \n\n has been taken by the Cabinet or any authority authorized in \n\n this behalf in terms of \nArticle 166(3)\n of the Constitution of \n\n India. It is trite that a circular letter being an administrative \n\n instruction is not a law within the meaning of \nArticle 13\n of the \n\n\f\n Constitution of India. (See \nDwarka Nath Tewari v. State of \n\n Bihar\n AIR 1959 SC 249).\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n18. He, thus, rejected the circular issued by the State of Bihar \n\nas invalid and of no consequence. However, the judgment by \n\nthe two judges, as seen above expressly acknowledged that in \n\nspecial circumstances, as may be provided in the Government \n\nCircular, the caste of the mother may be taken as the caste of \n\nthe children. Therefore, the view taken by Sinha J. on the \n\ncircular is clearly at variance with the judgment of the two \n\nJudges on that issue. On the question of the child inheriting the \n\ncaste of the mother the judgment by the two judges is silent as \n\nthe question did not arise for consideration in view of the \n\nfinding of fact that the respondent's father, a kurmi, had not \n\nmarried the pasi woman. It is, therefore, difficult to clothe the \n\nobservation by Sinha J. on this point with precedent value, \n\nespecially in view of the fact that the question did not arise at all \n\nafter the decision of the majority of two judges. Seervai in his \n\nConstitutional Law of India, Fourth Edition, pages 2669-2673 \n\n\f\nesp. Para 25.102 explains that a `decision' refers to the \n\ndetermination of each question of law which arose and was \n\ndecided \nin that case\n. \nIn \nPunit Rai\n's case, the question did not \n\narise at all, and moreover, there was no majority concurrence \n\non the question that a child inherits his caste from the father. \n\nThus, the concurring judgment of Sinha J. must be interpreted \n\nby reference to Paragraphs 33, 34 and 47 of the judgment, \n\nwhere the learned Judge concurs with the majority on the \n\nquestion of fact. The other observations in the concurring \n\njudgment cannot be said to constitute binding precedent.\n\n19. The question of the status of a child born to a scheduled \n\ntribe mother from a forward caste father again came up before \n\nthe Court in \nAnjan Kumar v. Union of India and others\n, (2006) 3 \n\nSCC 257. Anjan Kumar, was the son of a scheduled tribe \n\nmother and a Kayastha (forward caste) father. The question \n\nwas whether he could be considered to belong to the \n\nscheduled tribe. On the facts of the case, the Court found that \n\nthough the mother of the child indeed belonged to a scheduled \n\ntribe, the child was brought up in the environment of forward \n\n\f\ncaste community and he did not suffer any social disabilities or \n\nbackwardness. In paragraph 6 and 7 of the judgment the Court \n\nobserved as follows:-\n\n \"6.Undisputedly, the marriage of the appellant's mother (tribal \n\n woman) to one Lakshmi Kant Sahay (Kayastha) was a court \n\n marriage performed outside the village. Ordinarily, the court \n\n marriage is performed when either of the parents of bride or \n\n bridegroom or the community of the village objects to such \n\n marriage. In such a situation, the bride or the bridegroom \n\n suffers the wrath of the community of the village and runs the \n\n risk of being ostracised or excommunicated from the village \n\n community. Therefore, there is no question of such marriage \n\n being accepted by the village community. The situation will, \n\n however, stand on different footing in a case where a tribal \n\n man marries a non-tribal woman (forward class) then the \n\n offshoots of such wedlock would obviously attain the tribal \n\n status. However, the woman (if she belongs to a Forward \n\n Class) cannot automatically attain the status of tribal unless \n\n she has been accepted by the community as one of them, \n\n observed all rituals, customs and traditions which have been \n\n practiced by the tribals from time immemorial and accepted by \n\n the community of the village as a member of tribal society for \n\n the purpose of social relations with the village community. \n\n Such acceptance must be by the village community by a \n\n resolution and such resolution must be entered in the Village \n\n Register kept for the purpose. Often than not, such \n\n acceptance is preceded by feast/rituals performed by the \n\n parties where the elders of the village community participated. \n\n However, acceptance of the marriage by the community itself \n\n would not entitle the woman (forward class) to claim the \n\n appointment to the post reserved for the reserved category. It \n\n would be incongruous to suggest that the tribal woman, who \n\n suffered disabilities, would be able to compete with the woman \n\n (forward class) who does not suffer disabilities wherefrom she \n\n belongs but by reason of marriage to tribal husband and such \n\n marriage is accepted by the community would entitle her for \n\n appointment to the post reserved for the Scheduled Castes \n\n and Scheduled Tribes. It would be a negation of constitutional \n\n goal. \n\n 7. It is not disputed that the couple performed court \n\n marriage outside the village; settled down in Gaya and their \n\n son, the appellant also born and brought up in the \n\n environment of forward community did not suffer any disability \n\n from the society to which he belonged. Mr. Krishnamani, \n\n learned Senior Counsel contended that the appellant used to \n\n visit the village during recess/holidays and there was cordial \n\n relationship between the appellant and the village community, \n\n which would amount to the acceptance of the appellant by the \n\n village community. By no stretch of imagination, a casual visit \n\n to the relative in other village would provide the status of \n\n permanent resident of the village or acceptance by the village \n\n community as a member of the tribal community.\"\n\n20. The Court in paragraph 6 of the judgment, as quoted \n\nabove, applied the test of acceptance in the community in \n\nwhich the woman gets married. But more importantly in \n\nparagraph 7 of the judgment went into the specifics of the case \n\non the question of upbringing of the appellant Anjan Kumar and \n\nrecorded a finding of fact that he was \"brought up in the \n\nenvironment of forward community (and) did not suffer from any \n\ndisability from the society to which he belonged\". Having arrived \n\nat the aforesaid finding of fact the Court proceeded to refer to \n\nseveral decisions, including Valsamma and the judgment of \n\nSinha, J. in Punit Rai (in particular paragraph 27 of the \n\n\f\njudgment) and in paragraph 14 came to observe and hold as \n\nfollows:-\n\n \"14. In view of the catena of decisions of this Court, the \n\n questions raised before us are no more res integra. The \n\n condition precedent for granting tribe certificate being that one \n\n must suffer disabilities wherefrom one belongs. The \n\n offshoots of the wedlock of a tribal woman married to a \n\n non-tribal husband - Forward Class (Kayastha in the \n\n present case) cannot claim Scheduled Tribe status. The \n\n reason being such offshoot was brought up in the \n\n atmosphere of Forward Class and he is not subjected to \n\n any disability. A person not belonging to the Scheduled \n\n Castes or Scheduled Tribes claiming himself to be a member \n\n of such caste by procuring a bogus caste certificate is a fraud \n\n under the Constitution of India. The impact of procuring \n\n fake/bogus caste certificate and obtaining \n\n appointment/admission from the reserved quota will have far-\n\n reaching grave consequences. A meritorious reserved \n\n candidate may be deprived of reserved category for whom the \n\n post is reserved. The reserved post will go into the hands of \n\n non-deserving candidate and in such cases it would be \n\n violative of the mandate of \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n of the \n\n Constitution.\" \n\n (emphasis added)\n\n21. Here the Court said that, \"the offshoot of the wedlock of a \n\ntribal woman married to a non-tribal husband - Forward Class \n\n(Kayestha in the present case) cannot claim Scheduled Tribe \n\nstatus\". But it was not on the reasoning of Valsamma that in an \n\ninter-caste marriage or in a marriage between a tribal and a \n\n\f\nnon-tribal the woman gets transplanted into the community of \n\nthe husband and gets her caste from the husband (paragraph \n\n31 of the judgment) or the reasoning in Sinha J's judgment that \n\nin the absence of any statutory law a person would inherit his \n\ncaste from his father and not his mother even in a case of inter-\n\ncaste marriage\". Here the reasoning is that, \"..such offshoot \n\nwas brought up in the atmosphere of Forward Class and he is \n\nnot subjected to any disability. That is exactly the reasoning of \n\nValsamma in paragraph 34 of the judgment and that as noted \n\nabove is the true ratio of the decision in Valsamma.\n\n22. It is, thus, clear that it is wrong and incorrect to read \n\nValsamma, Punit Rai and Anjan Kumar as laying down the rule \n\nthat in an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal \n\nand a non-tribal, the child must always be deemed to take \n\nhis/her caste from the father regardless of the attending facts \n\nand circumstances of each case. Now, we propose to consider \n\nwhy the observation in Valsamma to the effect that an inter-\n\ncaste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal \n\nthe woman becomes a member of the family of her husband \n\n\f\nand takes her husband's caste (Paragraph 31 of the judgment) \n\nis not the ratio of that decision and more importantly what \n\ninequitable and anomalous results would follow if that \n\nproposition is taken to its next step to hold that the offspring of \n\nsuch a marriage would in all cases take the caste from the \n\nfather. \n\n23. For the proposition that on marriage the woman takes \n\nthe caste of her husband Valsamma relied on two nineteenth \n\ncentury Privy Council decisions, one in Bhoobum Moyee Debia \n\nv. Ram Kishore Acharj Chowdhry, (1865) 10 MIA 279 and the \n\nother in Lulloobhoy Bappoobhoy Cassidass Moolchund v. \n\nCassibai, (1879-80) 7IA 212. In Bhoobum Moyee Debia the \n\nrespondent Chandrabullee Debia after the death of her son, \n\nwho left behind an issueless widow (the appellant, Bhoobum \n\nMoyee Debia), in order to devest the widowed daughter-in-law, \n\nmade an adoption on the strength of a deed of permission of \n\nadoption that was executed in her favour by her deceased \n\nhusband (Gaur Kishore Acharj Chaudhary). The adopted son \n\nfiled a suit claiming the entire estate of Gaur Kishore Acharj \n\n\f\nChaudhary, trying to defeat the claim of the appellant and \n\ndevest her of the estate. He succeeded before the Sudder \n\nDewanny Adawlut of Calcutta. But in appeal the Privy Council \n\nheld that under the Hindu Law an adopted son takes by \n\ninheritance and not by device and as by that law in the case of \n\ninheritance, the person to succeed must be the heir of the full \n\nowner. In the facts of the case, the deceased son of Gaur \n\nKishore Acharj Chaudhary and Chandrabullee Debia who was \n\nthe husband of the appellant was the last full owner and at his \n\ndeath his wife, the appellant, succeeded as his heir to her \n\nwidow's estate. Consequently, the adoption by Chandrabullee \n\nDebia was void as the power was incapable of execution. After \n\nreaching this conclusion the Privy Council further noted that an \n\nadditional difficulty in holding the estate of the widow to be \n\ndevested \"may perhaps be found in the doctrine of Hindoo Law, \n\nthat the husband and wife are one and that as long as the wife \n\nsurvives, one half of the husband survives; but it is not \n\nnecessary to press this objection\".\n\n 24. The second decision of the Privy Council in Lulloobhoy \n\nBappoobhoy Cassidass Moolchund, raised the question \n\nwhether the widow of a paternal first cousin of the deceased \n\nbecame - by her marriage - a Gotraja-sapinda of the \n\ndeceased, and whether she was, therefore, entitled to succeed \n\nto the estate in preference to male gotraja-sapindas who were \n\nmore distant heirs. The Privy Council, based on an \n\ninterpretation of the Mitakshara law as it prevailed in Bombay at \n\nthat time, affirmed the widow's right of inheritance. The Privy \n\nCouncil observed, \"It is not disputed that on her marriage the \n\nwife enters the gotra of her husband, and it can scarcely be \n\ndoubted that in some sense she becomes a sapinda of his \n\nfamily. It is not necessary to cite authorities on this point...... \n\nWhether the right to inherit follows as a consequence of this \n\nsapinda relationship is the question to be considered?\" The \n\nPrivy Council cited a passage from the Achara Kanda of the \n\nMitakshara which suggested that sapinda relationship \n\ndepended on having the particles of the body of some ancestor \n\nin common. However, \"the wife and the husband are sapinda \n\nrelations to each other, because they together beget one body \n\n\f\n(the son)\". It was further observed; \"If then, as already pointed \n\nout, the wife upon her marriage enters the gotra of her husband \n\nand, thus, becomes constructively in consanguinity or \n\nrelationship with him, and through him, with his family, there \n\nwould appear to be nothing incongruous in her being allowed to \n\ninherit as a member of that family under a scheme of \n\ninheritance which did not adopt the principle of the general \n\nincapacity of women to inherit. But, though it may be consisted \n\nwith this theory of sapinda relationship to admit the widow so to \n\ninherit, the existence of the right has still to be established.\" \n\n25. In the first of the two Privy Council decisions, the issue of \n\nsapinda relationship did not really arise and the case was \n\ndecided on an altogether different basis. In the second \n\ndecision, it is only observed that the wife enters the gotra of the \n\nhusband. There may be many gotras within a certain caste, and \n\nit is unclear if this doctrine of Hindu Customary law can be \n\napplied in the post-Constitution era to determine the caste of a \n\nchild from an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a \n\ntribal and non-tribal. \n\n26. Without any disrespect, it seems a matter of grim irony \n\nthat two nineteenth century decisions of the Privy Council that \n\nwere rendered in their time to advance and safeguard the \n\ninterests of Hindu widows should be relied upon and used for \n\ncomplete effacement of the caste and the past life of a woman \n\nas a result of her marrying into a different caste. The Privy \n\nCouncil decisions were rendered about a century and a quarter \n\nago in cases of inheritance, in a completely different social and \n\nhistorical milieu, when cases of inter-caste marriage would be \n\ncoming to the court quite rarely. We are not quite sure of the \n\npropriety or desirability of using those decisions in a totally \n\ndifferent context in the post-Constitutional, independent India \n\nwhere there is such great consciousness and so much effort is \n\nbeing made for the empowerment of women and when \n\ninstances of inter-caste marriage are ever on the increase. It \n\nalso needs to be considered how far it would be proper to \n\ninvoke the customary Hindu law to alter the caste status of a \n\nwoman in an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a \n\ntribal and non-tribal and to assign to the woman the caste of \n\n\f\nher husband when such a marriage may itself be in complete \n\nbreach of the Hindu customary law.\n\n27. We may also recall that Valsamma Paul was a case \n\nwhere a Syrian Catholic woman (forward caste) had married a \n\nLatin Catholic man (backward class). The parties were \n\nChristians but the Court applied the Hindu Customary law \n\nobserving, \"It would, therefore, be clear that be it either under \n\nthe Canon law or the Hindu law, on marriage the wife becomes \n\nan integral part of husband's marital home entitled to equal \n\nstatus of husband as a member of the family. The Court, thus, \n\nput the Canon law at par with the Hindu Customary law. Now, \n\nsurely the same reasoning cannot apply if a Muslim of a \n\nforward caste marries a Muslim tribal e.g. a Lakshdweep Gaddi \n\nor a Bakriwal from Jammu and Kashmir. One wonders whether \n\nin those cases too the woman can be said to take the caste of \n\nher husband applying the reasoning of Valsamma.\n\n28. Further, whether and to what extent the Hindu Customary \n\nlaw would govern members of scheduled tribes (as opposed to \n\nscheduled castes) would depend on the extent to which the \n\n\f\ngiven tribe was hinduised prior to the adoption of the \n\nConstitution of India. \n\n29. The view expressed in Valsamma that in inter-caste \n\nmarriage or in a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal the \n\nwoman gets transplanted into the family of her husband and \n\ntakes her husband's caste is clearly not in accord with the view \n\nexpressed by the Constitution Bench of the Court in \nV.V. Giri v. \n\nDippala Suri Dora and others\n, (1960) 1 SCR 426 that it is well \n\nnigh impossible to break or even to relax the inflexible and \n\nexclusive character of the caste system. In V.V. Giri the election \n\nof the returned candidate was challenged on the ground that he \n\nhad ceased to be a member of the Scheduled Tribe and had \n\nbecome a Kashtriya. In support of the allegation evidences \n\nwere led that from 1928 onwards he had described himself and \n\nthe members of his family as belonging to the Kashtriya caste. \n\nOral evidence was led to show that he had for some years past \n\nadopted the customs and rituals of the Kashtriya caste and \n\nmarriages in his family were celebrated as they would be \n\namong the Kashtriya and homa was performed on such \n\n\f\n occasions. It was also shown that his family was connected by \n\n marriage ties with some Kashtriya families, that a Brahmin \n\n priest officiated at the religious ceremonies performed by him \n\n and he wore the sacred thread.\n\n 30. Rejecting the contention of the election petitioner \n\n Gajendragadkar J. (as his Lordship then was) speaking for \n\n himself and three other Honourable Judges on the Bench \n\n observed in Paragraph 25 of the judgment as follows:\n\n \"In dealing with this contention it would be essential to bear in \n\n mind the broad and recognized features of the hierarchical social \n\n structure prevailing amongst the Hindus. It is not necessary for \n\n our present purpose to trace the origin and growth of the caste \n\n system amongst the Hindus. It would be enough to state that \n\n whatever may have been the origin of Hindu castes and tribes in \n\n ancient times, gradually castes came to be based on birth \n\n alone. It is well known that a person who belongs by birth to \n\n a depressed caste or tribe would find it very difficult, if not \n\n impossible, to attain the status of a higher caste amongst \n\n the Hindus by virtue of his volition, education, culture and \n\n status. The history of social reform for the last century and \n\n more has shown how difficult it is to break or even to relax \n\n the rigour of the inflexible and exclusive character of the \n\n c\n aste system 1 . It is to be hoped that this position will change, \n\n and in course of time the cherished ideal of casteless society truly \n\n based on social equality will be attained under the powerful \n\n impact of the doctrine of social justice and equality proclaimed by \n\n the Constitution and sought to be implemented by the relevant \n\n statutes and as a result of the spread of secular education and \n\n the growth of a rational outlook and of proper sense of social \n\n1 In Valsamma (para 31) a bench of two judges, using similar words said just the opposite: \"The caste \n\nrigidity breaks down and would stand no impediment to her becoming a member of the family to which the \n\nhusband belongs\".\n\n values; but at present it would be unrealistic and utopian to ignore \n\n the difficulties which a member of the depressed tribe or caste \n\n has to face in claiming a higher status amongst his co-\n\n religionists.\"\n\n31. The observation made by Gajendragadkar J. half a century \n\nago was tellingly shown to be true in \nRajendra Shrivastava vs. \n\nState of Maharashtra\n, (2010) 112 BomLR 762, a case that came \n\nbefore the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court. In Rajendra \n\nShrivastava a Scheduled Caste woman, who had married a \n\nman from an upper caste, accused her husband and his family \n\nmembers of subjecting her to cruelty and abusing her in the \n\nname of her caste. A case was accordingly instituted against \n\nthe accused, including the husband, under \nSections 498A\n, \n406\n, \n\n494\n, \n34\n of the Indian Penal Code read with the provisions of \n\nSection 3(1)(ii)\n and \nSection 3(1)(x)\n of the Scheduled Castes \n\nand the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. In \n\nthe anticipatory bail application filed on behalf of the husband it \n\nwas contended that on getting married with him the \n\ncomplainant had assumed his caste and lost her identity as a \n\nScheduled Caste person. She could, therefore, make no \n\n\f\ncomplaint under the provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of \n\nAtrocities) Act. It goes without saying that in support of the \n\ncontention raised on behalf of the husband strong reliance was \n\nplaced upon the observations made in Valsamma in Paragraph \n\n31 of the judgment.\n\n32. The full bench before which the matter came up for \n\nconsideration on reference framed the following issue as arising \n\nfor consideration:\n\n \"If a woman who by birth belongs to a scheduled caste or a \n\n scheduled tribe marries to a man belonging to a forward caste, \n\n whether on marriage she ceases to belong to the scheduled caste \n\n or the scheduled tribe?\"\n\n \n33. The full bench of the Bombay High Court examined \n\nValsamma in light of two Constitutional Bench decisions of this \n\nCourt, namely, \nIndra Sawhney v. Union of India\n, 1992 supp (\n3) \n\nSCC 217 and V.V. Giri v. D. Suri Dora\n, (supra).\n \nThe full bench \n\nalso considered the law of precedent and referred to the \n\ndecision of this Court in \nState of A.P. v. M. Radha Krishna \n\nMurthy\n, (2009) 5 SCC 117. It finally came to hold that the \n\nobservations made in Paragraph 31 of the decision in \n\n\f\nValsamma cannot be read as the ratio laying down that on \n\nmarriage, a wife is automatically transplanted into the caste of \n\nher husband. In Paragraph 12 of the judgment it held as \n\nfollows:-\n\n \"When a woman born in a scheduled caste or a scheduled tribe \n\n marries to a person belonging to a forward caste, her caste by \n\n birth does not change by virtue of the marriage. A person born as \n\n a member of a scheduled caste or a scheduled tribe has to suffer \n\n from disadvantages, disabilities and indignities only by virtue of \n\n belonging to the particular caste which he or she acquires \n\n involuntarily on birth. The suffering of such a person by virtue of \n\n caste is not wiped out by a marriage with the person belonging to \n\n a forward caste. The label attached to a person born into a \n\n scheduled caste or a scheduled tribe continues notwithstanding \n\n the marriage. No material has been placed before us by the \n\n applicant so as to point out that the caste of a person can be \n\n changed either by custom, usage, religious sanction or provision \n\n of law.\"\n\n34. We fully endorse the view taken by the Bombay High Court \n\nand we feel that in the facts of the case that was the only \n\ncorrect view.\n\n35. In light of the discussion made above it is clear that the \n\nview expressed in Paragraph 31 of the Valsamma judgment \n\nthat in an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal \n\nand a non-tribal the woman must in all cases take her caste \n\nfrom the husband, as a rule of Constitutional Law is a \n\nproposition, the correctness of which is not free from doubt. And \n\n\f\nin any case it is not the ratio of the Valsamma decision and \n\ndoes not make a binding precedent. \n\n 36. It is also clear to us that taking it to the next logical step \n\nand to hold that the off-spring of such a marriage would in all \n\ncases get his/her caste from the father is bound to give rise to \n\nserious problems. Take for instance the case of a tribal woman \n\ngetting married to a forward caste man and who is widowed or \n\nis abandoned by the husband shortly after marriage. She goes \n\nback to her people and the community carrying with her an \n\ninfant or may be a child still in the womb. The child is born in \n\nthe community from where her mother came and to which she \n\nwent back and is brought up as the member of that community \n\nsuffering all the deprivations, humiliations, disabilities and \n\nhandicaps as a member of the community. Can it still be said \n\nthat the child would have the caste of his father and, therefore, \n\nnot entitled to any benefits, privileges or protections sanctioned \n\nby the Constitution.\n\n37. Let us now examine how the issue has been dealt with by \n\nsome of the High Courts.\n\n38. A full bench decision of the Kerala High Court in \nIndira v. \n\nState of Kerala\n, AIR 2006 Ker. 1, is a case in point.\n\n \n39. The Government of Kerala had issued G.O. (Ms) No. 298 \n\ndated 23/6/1961 stating that children born of inter-caste \n\nmarriages would be allowed all educational concessions if \n\neither of the parents belonged to scheduled caste/scheduled \n\ntribe. Later, on a query made by the Kerala Public Service \n\nCommission, the Government clarified vide a G.O. (Ms) dated \n\n25/1/1977 that the Government Order dated 23/6/1961 could be \n\nadopted for determining the caste of the children born of such \n\ninter-caste marriage for all purposes. Resultantly, such children \n\nwere treated as belonging to scheduled caste or scheduled \n\ntribe if either of their parents belonged to SC/ST. After the \n\ndecision of this Court in \nPunit Rai\n (supra) and in light of the \n\nseparate though concurring judgment of Sinha J. the State of \n\nKerala cancelled the earlier G.O. (Ms) dated 23/6/1961 and its \n\nclarification dated 25/1/1977 and replaced it by another order \n\nG.O. (Ms) No. 11/2005/SCSTDD dated 20/6/2005 directing that \n\nthe competent authorities would issue Scheduled \n\n\f\nCaste/Scheduled Tribe community certificates to the children \n\nborn from inter-caste marriage only as per the caste/community \n\nof his/her father subject to the conditions of acceptance, \n\ncustomary traits and tenets as stipulated in the judgments of the \n\nSupreme Court. The validity of the Government Order dated \n\n20/6/2005 came up for consideration before the full bench of \n\nthe Kerala High Court. The High Court considered the decisions \n\nof this Court in a number of cases including Valsamma, Sobha \n\nHymavathi Devi and Punit Rai and in Paragraph 21 of the \n\njudgment came to hold as follows:\n\n \n\"The Government, vide order G.O. (Ms) No. 25/2005/SCSTDD \n\n dated 20/6/2005 directed the competent authority to issue SC/ST \n\n community certificates to the children born out of intercaste \n\n married couples as per the caste/community of the father subject \n\n to the conditions of acceptance, customary traits and tenets \n\n stipulated in \nPunit Rai\n's case and \nSobha Hymavathi Devi\n's case. \n\n The above government order would also be applicable to \n\n the children born out of intercaste married couple if the \n\n mother belongs to SC/ST community. Subject to the above \n\n direction, rest of the directions contained in G.O. (Ms) No. 11/05/ \n\n and G.O. (Ms) No. 25/2005 would stand.\"\n\n40. We are in agreement with the view taken by the Kerala \n\nHigh Court.\n\n41. A division bench of the Delhi High Court in \nKendriya \n\nVidyalaya Sangathan v. Shanti Acharya Sisingi\n, 176(2011) DLT \n\n341, after considering a number of decisions of this Court \n\nsummed up the legal position as to the offspring of an inter-\n\ncaste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal \n\nin clauses 3 and 4 under Paragraph 30 of the judgment as \n\nfollows:\n\n \"III The offshoot of wedlock between Scheduled Caste/Scheduled \n\n Tribe male and a female belonging to forward community can \n\n claim Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe status for Indian society \n\n is patriarchal society where the child acquires the caste of his \n\n father.\n\n IV The offshoot of wedlock between Scheduled Caste/Scheduled \n\n Tribe female and a male belonging to forward community cannot \n\n claim Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe status unless he \n\n demonstrates that she has suffered the disabilities suffered by \n\n the members of the community of his mother.\"\n\n42. \nIn \nArabinda Kumar Saha v. State of Assam\n, 2001 (3) GLT \n\n45 a division bench of the Gauhati High Court had a case \n\nbefore it in which a person whose father belonged to the upper \n\ncaste and mother to a scheduled caste claimed scheduled \n\ncaste status. The court found and held that though the father of \n\nthe writ petitioner was admittedly a forward caste man he was \n\n\f\nbrought up as a member of the scheduled caste. This was \n\nevident from the fact that the writ petitioner had not only been \n\nthe office holder of Anushchit Jati Karamchari Parishad but the \n\nscheduled caste community treated the appellant as belonging \n\nto scheduled caste and even the non-scheduled caste people \n\ntreated him as scheduled caste, in as much as in his college \n\ncareer and in his service career he was treated as a person \n\nbelonging to a scheduled caste.\n\n43. In view of the analysis of the earlier decisions and the \n\ndiscussion made above, the legal position that seems to \n\nemerge is that in an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between \n\na tribal and a non-tribal the determination of the caste of the \n\noffspring is essentially a question of fact to be decided on the \n\nbasis of the facts adduced in each case. The determination of \n\ncaste of a person born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage \n\nbetween a tribal and a non-tribal cannot be determined in \n\ncomplete disregard of attending facts of the case. In an inter-\n\ncaste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal \n\nthere may be a presumption that the child has the caste of the \n\n\f\nfather. This presumption may be stronger in the case where in \n\nthe inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a \n\nnon-tribal the husband belongs to a forward caste. But by no \n\nmeans the presumption is conclusive or irrebuttable and it is \n\nopen to the child of such marriage to lead evidence to show \n\nthat he/she was brought up by the mother who belonged to the \n\nscheduled caste/scheduled tribe. By virtue of being the son of a \n\nforward caste father he did not have any advantageous start in \n\nlife but on the contrary suffered the deprivations, indignities, \n\nhumilities and handicaps like any other member of the \n\ncommunity to which his/her mother belonged. Additionally, that \n\nhe was always treated a member of the community to which her \n\nmother belonged not only by that community but by people \n\noutside the community as well. \n\n44. In the case in hand the tribal certificate has been taken \n\naway from the appellant without adverting to any evidences and \n\non the sole ground that he was the son of a Kshatriya father. \n\nThe orders passed by the High Court and the Scrutiny \n\nCommittee, therefore, cannot be sustained. The orders passed \n\n\f\nby the High Court and the Scrutiny Committee are, accordingly, \n\nset aside and the case is remitted to the Scrutiny Committee to \n\ntake a fresh decision on the basis of the evidences that might \n\nbe led by the two sides. It is made absolutely clear that this \n\nCourt is not expressing any opinion on the merits of the case of \n\nthe appellant or the private contesting respondent.\n\n 45. Before parting with the records of the case, we would \n\nlike to put on record our appreciation for the assistance that we \n\ngot from Mr. Sanjay R. Hegde counsel appearing for the \n\nappellant and Mr. Sanjeev Kumar counsel appearing for \n\nrespondent No. 6. The assistance we received from the amicus \n\ncuriae, Mr. Aman Ahluwalia was especially invaluable.\n\n 46. In the result, the appeal is allowed but in the facts of the \n\ncase there will be no order as to costs. \n\n .................................................. ...J\n\n (Aftab Alam)\n\n\f\n \n\n ....................................................J \n\n (Ranjana Prakash Desai)\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nJanuary 18, 2012",
