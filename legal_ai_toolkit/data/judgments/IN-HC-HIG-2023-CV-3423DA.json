This Court would first deal with category I cases. The\n\nfollowing writ applications would be covered under category I:-\n\n01. CWJC No. 20636 of 2021, Shamima Khatoon vs. State\nof Bihar & Ors.\n02. CWJC No. 20610 of 2021, Sauda Khatun vs. State of\nBihar & Ors.\n03.

No. 20636 of 2021, listed at serial no. 1 (Shamima\n\nKhatoon vs. State of Bihar and others) as the lead case. For brevity\n\nsake, this Court is not taking note of the various memo numbers\n\nand dates in different writ applications at this stage, however, those\n\nwill be referred to at appropriate stage. This Court would refer\n\nthem as impugned office order(s).\n\nCase of the Petitioners-Category-I\n\n6. It is the case of the petitioner(s) that they were\n\nappointed on the post of assistant teachers in different districts as\n\nback as in the year 1982. One Kaushal Kumar filed a Public\n\nInterest Litigation in this Court vide C.W.J.C. No.10002 of 2016,\n\nalleging that a large number of irregularities have taken place in\n\nthe matter of appointment of Assistant Teachers in Lower\n\nSubordinate Education Service (in short 'LSS'). The Hon'ble\n\nDivision Bench while hearing C.W.J.C. No.10002 of 2016, passed\n\nthe order dated 19.06.2016 by which the authorities of the\n\nDepartment of Education, Government of Bihar including the\n\nPrincipal Secretary, Department of Education were called upon to\n\nappear in person with an explanation by way of affidavit as to why\n\nnecessary action has not been taken by the State-respondents on\n\nthe report of the C.B.I. and what action has been taken against\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n22/87\n\nthose persons who have made illegal appointments. The Hon'ble\n\nDivision Bench, however, observed as follows:-\n\n\"We make it clear that no termination of service of\nteachers shall take place pursuant to the report of the\nC.B.I. without giving notice to the teachers concerned\nand without following the due process of law.\"\n7. It is stated that in fact the matter relating to\n\nappointment of Assistant Teachers during the said period were\n\nsubject matter of inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (in\n\nshort 'C.B.I.' or 'CBI'). C.B.I. had submitted a report after\n\nexamining the appointments of 'LSS' by different appointing\n\nauthorities during the period 1980-1998. The report of the CBI\n\nindicated that large number of appointments were made without\n\nany advertisement of the post in any local newspaper, no roster\n\nclearance was obtained, reservation rules were not followed and\n\nthere was no proceeding of any selection committee for selection\n\nof the candidates. Some of the appointments were made of the\n\ncandidates who were over aged and appointing authorities were\n\nnot even competent to make regular appointments.\n\n8. The report submitted by the CBI revealed that in\n\ncertain cases, the applicants who did not posses the required\n\nqualification of Matric Trained Teachers, were appointed in lower\n\nscale of Matric Untrained Teachers and subsequently, upon\n\nacquiring the Matric Trained Qualification, they were given the\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n23/87\n\nscale of Matric Trained Teachers by the concerned appointing\n\nauthorities. In most of the cases, the candidates submitting the\n\napplication for appointment as LSS teachers had declared his\n\npoverty, poor economic conditions, being widow, being divorcee\n\nor deserted by husband, etc. as such circumstances for their\n\nappointment to the post of LSS teachers which were considered\n\nand taken into account for their appointment on the\n\nrecommendation of the politicians. So far as the petitioners in the\n\nfirst category are concerned, the petitioner, namely, Shamima\n\nKhatoon was served with a show cause notice pointing out that her\n\nappointment has been found irregular by the CBI and directions\n\nhave been issued to take action in the light of the report of the\n\nCBI, therefore, she should submit her show cause within a period\n\nof three days. Vide memo no. 710 dated 01.10.2016, her service\n\nwas terminated in view of the report of the CBI.\n\n9. Similar orders were issued to the other writ petitioners\n\nand their services were terminated. It is stated that the order\n\nterminating the services of the petitioners were challenged in this\n\nCourt vide C.W.J.C. No.17547 of 2016 and other analogues\n\nmatters. All those writ applications came to be considered by the\n\nlearned Writ Court. In C.W.J.C. No.17904 of 2016, this Court\n\nfound that the decision making process was faulty, therefore, set\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n24/87\n\naside the order terminating the services of the petitioners and the\n\nsame judgment was followed by the learned Writ Court in\n\nC.W.J.C. No.17438 of 2016 and other analogues cases. However,\n\nwhile disposing of the writ application, the learned Writ Court\n\nobserved a follows:-\n\n\"This order, however, could not preclude the Regional\nDeputy Director of Education concerned to proceed afresh\nbut in accordance with law and pass appropriate order after\naffording appropriate opportunity ...... The petitioners on\nbeing served notice would corporate in expeditious\ndisposal of he matter.\"\n\n10. After setting aside of the order of dismissal of the\n\npetitioners, they were reinstated in service and were paid their\n\nsalaries.\n\nFresh Steps- Show Cause Notices\n\n11. The Regional Deputy Director (in short 'RDD'),\n\nhowever, once again issued show cause notice to the petitioners\n\nwhich the petitioners replied. By the order of the RDD, a\n\ndepartmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioners. The\n\npetitioners were made available a copy of the remarks made by the\n\nCBI and it was alleged that their initial appointment was made\n\nwithout advertisement, without roster clearance or without\n\ninterview. A copy of the memo served upon the petitioner Smt.\n\nShamima Khatoon has been placed on record and the same is\n\nbeing reproduced hereunder for a ready reference:-\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n25/87\n\n\"vkjksi i=\n\nizi= *d*\n\nvkjksfir deZpkjh dk uke %& Jherh lehek [k+krqu\ninuke %& lgk;d f\"kf{kdk ¼fuEu voj f\"k{kk lsok½\ninLFkkiu dk LFkku %& e0 iz0 f\"k0 f\"k0 egkfo0 ¼vH;kl ikB\"kkyk½\nQkjfclxat] vjf;k\nosrueku %& 9300&34800&4800@&\nfu;qfDr frfFk %& 10-02-1982\nlsok fuo`fr frfFk %& 31-12-2020\n\nØekad vjksi vkjksi dk fooj.k lk{;\n01 fu;qfDr esa fcuk mfpr izfØ;k viuk, vkidh lh/kh fu;qfDr dh xbZA fdlh Lh0ch0vkbZ0 fjiksVZ\nvfu;ferrk LFkkuh; lekpkj i= ,oa fu;kstuky; }kjk bl in ds fy, dksbZ ¼dsUnzh; vUos'k.k C;wjks½ dk\nfoKkiu ugha fudkyk x;kA jksLVj Dyh;jsUl izkIr ugha djk;k x;k vkSj tk¡p izfrosnu\nvkj{k.k fu;eksa dk vuqikyu ugha fd;k x;kA p;u lfefr }kjk fu;qfDr\ngsrq dksbZ vUrohZ{kk@tk¡p laca/kh dk;Zokgh ugha dh xbZA\n\ng0@&\n28-08-2017\n\nJs=h; f\"k{kk mi funs\"kd]\niwf.kZ;k¡ ize.My] iwf.kZ;k¡\"\n\n12. The petitioners claimed that they appeared before the\n\nDistrict Programme Officer and submitted that they were\n\nappointed pursuant to the notice published in the school. Their\n\nappointments have taken place against the sanctioned vacant post.\n\nThe petitioner Shamima Khatoon, however, retired from service\n\non 31.12.2020 during the pendency of the departmental\n\nproceeding. On 08.04.2021 the petitioner filed a second show\n\ncause reply, however, keeping aside the reply of the petitioner, the\n\nimpugned order forfeiting the pensionary benefits of the\n\npetitioner and others was issued.

The impugned order has been assailed by the\n\npetitioners on the ground that the CBI has adopted a\n\ndiscriminatory approach in preparing and submitting the report\n\ndated 04.12.2004 which deals with the cases of 304 Teachers of\n\nLSS cadre. It is submitted that CBI has reported that 251 Assistant\n\nTeachers were irregularly appointed, appointment of 28 Teachers\n\nhave been held regular, records of 17 Assistant Teachers were not\n\navailable and the records of 3 Assistant Teachers who were\n\nterminated were not available. Similar was the case in respect of 5\n\nAssistant Teachers who were held irregular but the records were\n\nnot available. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n\nCBI has held 28 appointments as regular but in those appointments\n\nmanifold irregularities are existing which are akin to the cases of\n\n251 Teachers. According to the petitioners there is no basic\n\ndifference in between the cases of said 28 Teachers and 251\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n28/87\n\nTeachers but the CBI held the appointment of said 28 Teachers as\n\nregular and thereby the appointment of the said 251 Teachers have\n\nbeen held as irregular. This has been called a completely arbitrary\n\nand discriminatory approach on the part of the CBI and that\n\naccording to the petitioners would vitiate the report of the CBI.\n\n14. It is submitted that one grave illegality which has\n\nbeen committed by the CBI is evident from bare perusal of the\n\nentries made in the 84 Assistant Teachers named at various serial\n\nnumbers who have been declared as irregular appointees in spite of\n\nthe fact that in concerned column of the said 84 Teachers, it has\n\nbeen clearly mentioned that \"records are not available\".\n\n15. It is submitted that the order of punishment has been\n\npassed against the petitioners solely on the basis of the said CBI\n\nreport dated 04.12.2004, therefore, the order of punishment is in\n\nthe teeth of the order dated 19.09.2016 passed in C.W.J.C. No.\n\n10002 of 2016 by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court. The\n\npetitioners relied upon the observations of the Hon'ble Division\n\nBench of this Court wherein it has been stated that no termination\n\nof service of Teachers shall take place pursuant to the report of\n\nCBI without giving notices to the teacher(s) concerned and\n\nwithout following due process of law.\n\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n29/87\n\n16. It is submitted that the punishment orders are also\n\nin teeth of the judgment of this Court passed on 17.01.2017 in\n\nC.W.J.C. No. 17904 of 2016. (\nShanti Kumari Vs. State of Bihar\n\n& Ors\n.)\n\n17. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n\nrespondents have not acted in accordance with the Rule 17(4) and\n\n17(5) of the Bihar Government Servants (Classification, Control\n\n& appeal) Rules 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Service\n\nRules') in the matter of initiation of the departmental proceeding\n\nright from the stage of framing of memorandum of charge until the\n\nconclusion of the same and the same is in the teeth of the\n\nprovisions of the Service Rules.\n\n18. Learned counsel has also relied upon the statement\n\nmade by CBI in paragraph '10' of its' affidavit dated 09.12.2019\n\nfiled in WP(S) No. 5669 of 2018 before the Hon'ble Jharkhand\n\nHigh Court at Ranchi in which it is stated that the appointees\n\nwere not examined during CBI inquiry. It is submitted that in case\n\nof similarly situated Teacher like these petitioners, the Hon'ble\n\nJharkhand High Court had been pleased to allow WP (S) No. 6023\n\nof 2018 which has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Division bench of\n\nJharkhand High Court vide order dated 02.03.2023 in L.P.A.No.\n\n141 of 2021.\n\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n30/87\n\n19. Learned counsel submits that on a bare perusal of the\n\norders passed by the Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court it would\n\nappear that in the said case it has been held that as per Rule 97 (xi)\n\nof the Bihar Education Code, the District School Inspectress was\n\nthe competent authority for appointment of Assistant Teachers in\n\nthe pay-scale of Rs. 50-90/-\n\n20. It is further submitted that the charges levelled\n\nagainst the petitioners related to the periods of the year 1982\n\nonwards, therefore, no proceeding under the Bihar Pension Rules\n\ncould have been initiated against the petitioners. Reliance in this\n\nregard has been placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of\nState of M.P. v. Bani Singh\nreported in 1990\n\nSupp SCC 738, State of Andhra Pradesh Vs. N.\n\nRadhkrishnana reported in (1998) 4 SCC 154, Union of India\n\nand Ors. vs. Kishorill Bablani reported in\nAIR 1999 SC 517 and\n\nP.V. Mahadevan v. Managing Director, T.N. Housing Board\n\nreported in (2005) 6 SCC 636.\n\n21. It is further submitted that after initial appointment\n\nof the petitioners, the authorities concerned had granted all due\n\nbenefits to the petitioners like regular employees and the\n\nappointment of all the petitioners had been made by the\n\ncompetent authority against the sanctioned and vacant post as also\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n31/87\n\nthey were having requisite qualifications for the post of Assistant\n\nTeachers (in LSS Cadre) they were appointed by virtue of Notice\n\nBoard Advertisement.\n\nStand of the Respondents\n\n22. Contrary to the stand of the petitioners, the State-\n\nrespondents have filed a counter affidavit in which the following\n\nstand has been taken:-\n\n(i). The petitioner has been duly proceeded against in a\n\ndepartmental proceeding and they have been given opportunity of\n\nhearing by serving show cause and affording opportunity to them\n\nto participate in the inquiry. The petitioners were also served with\n\nthe inquiry report and second show cause notice was served upon\n\nthem. It is submitted by the State-respondents that the impugned\n\norder has been passed under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules\n\nbecause the petitioner had retired on 31.12.2020. The departmental\n\nproceeding had been converted into a proceeding under Rule 43(b)\n\nof the Pension Rules vide memo no. 08 dated 05.01.2021 as\n\ncontained in Annexure 'A' to the counter affidavit.\n\n23. The State-respondents have submitted that the\n\npetitioners' appointment was done without proper advertisement in\n\nthe local newspaper without any test or interview or without any\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n32/87\n\nroster clearance. It was a backdoor entry, they did not conform to\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. The appointment\n\nwas void ab-initio in law.\n\n24. Learned counsel for the State has submitted that the\n\nratio of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3) reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1\n\nclearly says that an appointment made contrary to\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India dehors the rules would be illegal\n\nappointments and those will be distinguishable from irregular\n\nappointments and they are like a still born child who can never be\n\ninfused with life. Thus, the labelling of 'Irregular' Illegal or\n\nRegular appointments in its' report by CBI is not significant. These\n\nappointments are to be put in appropriate category as understood\n\nin legal parlance.\n\n25. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Full\n\nBench of this Court in the case of\nRam Sevak Yadav vs. The\n\nState of Bihar and others\nreported in 2013 1 PLJR 964, learned\n\ncounsel for the State submits that the Hon'ble Full Bench of this\n\nCourt has declared that an illegal appointment void ab-initio made\n\ncontrary to the mandate of\nArticle 14\nwithout open competitive\n\nselection process is void ab-initio and cannot be regularized under\n\nany circumstance.\n\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n33/87\n\n26. The State-respondents have further submitted that in\n\nC.W.J.C. No.9847 of 1998 (\nBrajesh Kumar Singh and others\n\nvs. State of Bihar and others\n), vide order dated 16.12.2019 there\n\nwas a direction to the CBI to carry on an investigation in the\n\nmatter of appointments/ promotion of LSS (women cadre) who\n\nwere appointed from 1980 to 1998. CBI submitted its report on\n\n09.11.2004 before the Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar,\n\nPatna against 305 teachers in which appointment of only 27\n\nteachers were found regular whereas appointment of 278 teachers\n\nwere found to be illegal/ irregular, and therefore, recommendations\n\nwere made for taking action against illegally/ irregularly appointed\n\nteachers and also against those officers who had made such\n\nappointments. As per report of the CBI, there was no\n\nadvertisement in most of the cases, no roster clearance were\n\nobtained and no reservation rules were followed.\n\n27. It is submitted that in the year 2011, the power and\n\nfunction of Inspectress of Schools-cum-Deputy Director of\n\nEducation was merged with the post of Regional Deputy Director\n\nof Education. The Director, Seconday Education, Bihar, Patna\n\nissued a direction vide letter no. 1674 dated 17.08.2016 to all\n\nRegional Deputy Director of Education to locate such LSS\n\nteachers (women cadre) who were appointed during the period\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n34/87\n\n1980-1998 and take legal action in accordance with law. Pursuant\n\nthereof, second show cause notice was issued to the petitioners and\n\nafter careful consideration of the reply filed by the petitioners and\n\nscrutinizing the CBI report, the then Regional Deputy Director\n\nterminated the services of the petitioners which termination orders\n\nwere challenged in several writs and those writ petitions were also\n\nheard together and orders of termination were set aside/ quashed.\n\nBy virtue of termination, their services were restored but this\n\nreinstatement was with liberty granted to the respondents to\n\nproceed afresh in accordance with law.\n\n28. It is submitted that one of the candidates in this\n\nregard, namely, Neelam Kumari (C.W.J.C. No.10022 of 2019)\n\nwhose name appears at serial no. 186 in CBI report was appointed\n\nin 1977 by the District Inspectress (DI) who was not competent\n\nauthority for the appointment. There was no select committee\n\nproceedings for her appointment through interview/ test. The post\n\nwas not advertised in any newspaper. Her husband was assistant in\n\nthe education department and in such circumstance, if the\n\nimpugned order has been passed after giving appropriate\n\nopportunity of hearing to the petitioners, no fault may be found\n\nwith the same. Referring to the facts of another similarly situated\n\npetitioner, namely, Shanti Kumari (C.W.J.C. No.3039 of 2019), it\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n35/87\n\nis submitted that she was appointed by DI who was not competent\n\nbecause LSS teachers is a State cadre post. The post was never\n\nadvertised in any local newspaper. Her name appears at serial no.\n\n205 of the CBI report. It has also been submitted that the\n\ndepartmental proceeding has been conducted in accordance with\n\nlaw and on the face of the facts which are crystal clear and are\n\nshowing that these appointments were made without any\n\nadvertisement and without their being any selection committee\n\nformed for this purpose, no prejudice would be caused to the\n\npetitioner if no witness was examined by the department in the\n\ndepartmental proceeding.\n\n29. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\n\nprinciple of natural justice cannot be put in a straight jacket\n\nformula and this is one of those cases in which the facts are such\n\nthat this Court can easily appreciate that their being no denial of\n\nthe fact that there was no advertisement in the newspaper and the\n\nappointments were made without roster clearance and without\n\ntheir being any selection committee formed for this purpose to\n\nappoint the petitioners on the basis of interview, no prejudice\n\nwould be caused to the petitioners as it is an open and shut case.\n\nOn the aforesaid grounds, the State-respondents have submitted\n\nthat the writ application are fit to be dismissed.\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n36/87\n\nAs regards the judgment of the Hon'ble Jharkhand High\n\nCourt, it is submitted that the same is clearly distinguishable and in\n\nany case the judgment would not be a binding precedent.\n\nStand of the CBI\n\n30. Let it be recorded that in course of hearing of these\n\nwrit applications when this Court went through the records\n\nincluding the report of the CBI, learned Senior Counsel for the\n\nCBI was called upon to take a stand with regard to the nature of\n\nthe cases found by the CBI particularly the distinction drawn by\n\nthe CBI in its report between irregular and illegal appointments.\n\nLearned Senior Counsel for the CBI has assisted this Court by\n\ngoing into the records particularly the report of the CBI and\n\nlearned Senior Counsel pointed out that the cases in which the\n\nappointments have been made on political recommendations\n\nwithout any advertisement and without their being any select\n\ncommittee and without there being any interview by such\n\nappointing authorities who had no authority to make regular\n\nappointments are definitely in the nature of illegal appointments.\n\nConsideration\n\n31. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioners,\n\nlearned counsel for the State and learned Senior Counsel for the\n\nCBI as also on going through the pleadings, this Court finds that\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n37/87\n\nwrit petitioners are questioning the impugned orders passed by the\n\nState-respondents by which in exercise of power under Rule 43(b)\n\nof the Pension Rules, the pension as well as other retiral benefits\n\nof the petitioners have been forfeited.\n\n32. The background of the present case would be\n\nevident from the submissions of the parties which have been taken\n\nnote of hereinabove.\n\n33.\nIn the case of\nShanti Kumari Vs. State of Bihar &\n\nOrs.\nthis Court in its judgment dated 17.01.2017 in C.W.J.C. No.\n\n17904 of 2016 inter alia observed as follows:-\n\n\"........Undisputedly the petitioners have been deprived of a\nreasonable opportunity to canvas their respective cases,\nproduce relevant documents together with supporting case\nlaws which could not be pressed into service, in the manner in\nwhich the matter has been conducted. My observations\ncertainly would not bear a protection to such appointments\nwhich are plagued with fraud and obtained on forged\ndocuments, however this would require an examination thereof\nand individual case needs to be examined.\"\n\n(underline is mine)\nFurther it is observed in concluding paragraph as under:\n\n\"Needless to add that in case the Regional Deputy Director\nof Education, Magadh Division, Gaya as well as Regional\nDeputy Director of Education of other Divisions would\ndecide to re-initiate the proceeding and serve notice on the\nwrit petitioners, they would cooperate in the expeditious\ndisposal of the matter.\"\n\n34. The petitioners were facing the charges that they\n\nwere appointed without advertisement of the posts in a newspaper\n\nor to the employment exchange, the roster clearance were not\n\navailable, reservation rules were not followed and there was no\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n38/87\n\nselection through a selection committee by conducting interview\n\nand/or verifying the records. They were appointed on the\n\nrecommendation of the politicians. In the first round of litigation,\n\nthe termination of the petitioners were set aside by this Court and\n\nthey were ordered to be reinstated in service with consequential\n\nbenefits even as the disciplinary proceeding against them were to\n\nproceed afresh. At this stage, this Court finds that the petitioners in\n\nfact got benefit of their salary etc. even as the validity of their\n\nappointments were yet to be tested, examined and an appropriate\n\nview was to be taken. In this regard, the Hon'ble Constitution\n\nBench judgment in the case of Managing Director, ECIL,\n\nHyderabad Versus B. Karunakar and Others reported in (1993)\n\n4 SCC 727 may be referred to. Paragraph '31' of the judgment is\n\nbeing reproduced here under for ready reference:-\n\n\"31. Hence, in all cases where the enquiry officer's report\nis not furnished to the delinquent employee in the\ndisciplinary proceedings, the Courts and Tribunals should\ncause the copy of the report to be furnished to the\naggrieved employee if he has not already secured it before\ncoming to the Court/Tribunal and give the employee an\nopportunity to show how his or her case was prejudiced\nbecause of the non-supply of the report. If after hearing the\nparties, the Court/Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the\nnon-supply of the report would have made no difference to\nthe ultimate findings and the punishment given, the\nCourt/Tribunal should not interfere with the order of\npunishment. The Court/Tribunal should not mechanically\nset aside the order of punishment on the ground that the\nreport was not furnished as is regrettably being done at\npresent. The courts should avoid resorting to short cuts.\nSince it is the Courts/Tribunals which will apply their\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n39/87\n\njudicial mind to the question and give their reasons for\nsetting aside or not setting aside the order of punishment,\n(and not any internal appellate or revisional authority),\nthere would be neither a breach of the principles of natural\njustice nor a denial of the reasonable opportunity. It is only\nif the Court/Tribunal finds that the furnishing of the report\nwould have made a difference to the result in the case that\nit should set aside the order of punishment. Where after\nfollowing the above procedure, the Court/Tribunal sets\naside the order of punishment, the proper relief that should\nbe granted is to direct reinstatement of the employee with\nliberty to the authority/management to proceed with the\ninquiry, by placing the employee under suspension and\ncontinuing the inquiry from the stage of furnishing him\nwith the report. The question whether the employee would\nbe entitled to the back-wages and other benefits from the\ndate of his dismissal to the date of his reinstatement if\nultimately ordered, should invariably be left to be decided\nby the authority concerned according to law, after the\nculmination of the proceedings and depending on the final\noutcome. If the employee succeeds in the fresh inquiry and\nis directed to be reinstated, the authority should be at\nliberty to decide according to law how it will treat the\nperiod from the date of dismissal till the reinstatement and\nto what benefits, if any and the extent of the benefits, he\nwill be entitled. The reinstatement made as a result of the\nsetting aside of the inquiry for failure to furnish the report,\nshould be treated as a reinstatement for the purpose of\nholding the fresh inquiry from the stage of furnishing the\nreport and no more, where such fresh inquiry is held. That\nwill also be the correct position in law.\"\n\n35. In the fresh round of disciplinary proceeding, the\n\npetitioner(s) were served with Prapatra 'K' ¼izi= d½. Inquiry was\n\nconducted into the matter and after consideration of the stand of\n\nthe petitioners what ultimately transpired in the inquiry report may\n\nbe summerised as under:\n\n(i) No advertisement had been issued by the Inspectress\n\nof School-cum-Deputy Director of Education, Bihar for the\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n40/87\n\npurpose of appointment of teachers in the subordinate service\n\ncadre.\n\n(ii) The petitioners only claimed that there were\n\ninformation on the notice board of the office of the Inspectress of\n\nSchool-cum-Deputy Director of Education, Bihar, it is not their\n\nstand that the posts were advertised and the public at large who\n\nwere eligible for appointment as teacher had opportunity to apply\n\nfor the said post.\n\n(iii) As regards, roster clearance and observance of the\n\nprinciples of reservation are concerned, this is also not in dispute,\n\nand\n\n(iv) The petitioners failed to produce any letter of a\n\nselection committee or any competent authority calling upon them\n\nto appear for interview.\n\n36. In course of hearing of C.W.J.C. No.1690 of 1997\n\nwhich was filed by Smt. Shushma Kumari and other primary\n\nteachers claiming pay benefits for the period 20.07.1985 to\n\n17.05.1990, the then Director, Secondary Education, Bihar filed a\n\nreply contending that the lady teachers appointed during the period\n\nfrom 1980 onwards were appointed illegally and consequently the\n\npromotion given to them was also irregular. This Court was\n\ninformed that the matter of appointment/ promotion of these\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n41/87\n\nteachers was under investigation with Cabinet Vigilance\n\nDepartment and the Government of Bihar had set up an inquiry\n\ncommittee to inquire into the matter. This Court vide order\n\ndate19.09.1997 directed the Government of Bihar to take final\n\ndecision in the matter. An inquiry was also started by the Cabinet\n\nVigilance Investigation Bureau, Bihar. While the said inquiry was\n\nin progress, in C.W.J.C. No.9847 of 1998 (\nBrajesh Kumar and\n\nothers vs. State of Bihar and others\n) this Court issued directions\n\nto the CBI to take up the investigation into the matter of\n\nappointments of primary teachers and other teachers in the State of\n\nBihar from 1980 till date. It is in these facts and circumstances,\n\nthe CBI Anti Corruption Branch registered the preliminary inquiry\n\nNo.3 (A/01) dated 08.06.2001.\n\n37. The preliminary inquiry revealed that Inspectress of\n\nSchools-cum-Deputy Director, Secondary Education, Bihar\n\nprovided a list of 305 teachers of LSS (women wing) whose\n\nappointments were said to be illegal/irregular. The name of the\n\nauthorities who had appointed them were also provided. Another\n\nlist of 160 LSS teachers allegedly illegally/ irregularly promoted\n\nduring 1990 by late Dr. Sachita Kumar Sinha the then Director,\n\nSecondary Education, Bihar was also obtained by the CBI.\n\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n42/87\n\n38. The CBI in its report has scrutinized the rules\n\ngoverning the LSS teachers and circulars which were issued by the\n\nGovernment of Bihar from time to time.

RECOMMENDATORY There are no provisions, no procedure\nAPPOINTMENTS and no circulars for such appointments\n\nFor the purposes of promotion of LSS Teacher to the grade of SEX, the relevant rules and\nprocedure as applicable are summarised as below :-\n\n1. Appointing Authority :- Director, Secondary Education Bihar is the appointing authority of SES Teachers both\nfor direct recruitment as well as through promotion from LSS to SES (Rule 796 Bihar Education Code 1961 and\nLetter No. 11/MZZ/03/63E-4484 dt. 8.12.65).\n\n2. Direct Recruitment :- It is to be made through State Selection Board /Vidyalaya\nSewa Board.\n\n3. Promotions :- For promotion from LSS teacher to SES teacher, 50% of the total post will be filled by direct\nrecruitment and 50 % of the vacancies will be filled by promotion from amongst the LSS teachers as per letter\nNo. 27 dt 7.1.76 of Education Department.\"\n\n39. It is evident from the relevant Rules and the\n\nCirculars which have been issued from time to time that the\n\nDirector, Secondary Education, Bihar is the appointing authority\n\nof the Subordinate Education Services Teachers (hereinafter\n\nreferred to a the 'SES Teachers') both by direct recruitment as well\n\nas through promotion from 'LSS' to 'SES' (Refer Rule 796 of the\n\nBihar Education Code 1961 and letter No. 11/M 22/03/63 E-4484\n\ndated 08.12.1965). It is also evident that the direct recruitment is\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n45/87\n\nto be made through State Selection Board/Vidayalay Sewa Board.\n\nThe Director, Secondary Education is only competent to approve a\n\nselect list for appointment in LSS (women cadre). A\n\ncompassionate appointment may be made in 'SES' Scale directly\n\nas and when cleared by the government through Department of\n\nPersonal and Administrative Reforms.\n\n40. As regards the appointment of the 305 LSS\n\nTeachers, the CBI got 234 appointment folders and scrutinized the\n\nsame. Some of the appointees were also examined to ascertain the\n\nprocedure adopted towards their appointment as LSS Teachers.\n\nThis inquiry revealed that these appointments of LSS Teachers\n\n(women wing) were made by 46 appointing authorities during the\n\nperiod from 1980 to 1998. They were the Inspectress of School-\n\ncum-Deputy Director, Secondary Education, Bihar who made\n\nmaximum number of 108 appointments during period 1980-86.\n\nOne Smt. Sudha Sinha the Inspectress of School, Bihar who was\n\nthe District Inspectress School (in short 'DI') at Patna at the\n\nrelevant time made 57 appointments during the period\n\n05.07.1988 to 15.01.1990 and 1987 to 1988 respectively. In this\n\nmanner all the 46 Inspectress of School, Deputy Director\n\nEducation, Director, Secondary Education and District Inspectress\n\nof School were involved in making appointments without carrying\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n46/87\n\nany selection process. A large number of them had died at the time\n\nthe CBI was conducting inquiry.\n\n(underline is mine)\n\n41. As regards the procedures related to appointment\n\nwhat has been revealed in the inquiry report of the CBI are being\n\ntaken verbatimly from the said report as under:-\n\n\"The enquiry has further revealed that the procedure related to the appointments of LSS teachers is governed\nby GO No.I-D-306-58E-1 382D dated 17.3.59 and\nArticle 64 (1\n\n& 3)\nof Bihar Education Code,\nArticle 3\nof BB Misc.\nRules, 1958, Rule 796 of Bihar Education code and notification 262 dated 2.6.86 according to which Inspectress\nof Schools of Bihar and/or Director of Secondary Education, Bihar is the appointing authority of LSS teachers.\nClause 2 of Article-64 of Bihar Education Code lays down that, in the event of an urgent and unforeseen\nvacancy, the Inspectress may make temporary appointment of a teacher without prior reference to the Director\nfor a period not exceeding three months. In view of the aforesaid provision, only the Inspectress of Schools was\nempowered to make temporary appointment only for three months. In letter No. 8167 dated 21.6.66 issued by\nSecretary to the Government of Bihar, it is laid down that all recruitments to the vacancies to be filled up by the\nState Government will be channelised compulsorily through the Employment Exchange except the vacancies\nwhich were to be filled up on the recommendation of the Bihar Public Service Commission or by promotion or\ntransfer or deputation specifically mentioning therein that the other source of recruitment will be tried only\nwhen the Employment Exchange concerned issues a non-availability certificate.\n\nThe enquiry has further revealed that in the matter of illegal/irregular appointment of 305 LSS\nteachers, the original applications of most of the candidates are addressed either to the inspectress of Schools,\nBihar, Patna or to the State Education Minister, Bihar. The said applications contain the recommendations made\nby politicians like MLA's/ MLC's other Ministers/ Distt. Educational Authorities and were endorsed to the\nInpectress of School, Bihar, Patna for taking necessary action and/or for making appointment as Primary\nTeacher. These recommendations of the politicians or the then Education Minister were treated as Government\norders by the Inspectress of Schools, Bihar/Distt. Inspectress of Schools and they without following the\nprescribed procedure directly issued appointment orders in favour of the recommended candidates, making\nappointment in a temporary capacity for a period ranging between 3 to 6 months against a temporary vacancy\ncreated by any regular teachers going on maternity/sick/long leave. The prescribed procedure, relevant rules,\nand circulars issued by the Government of Bihar from time to time for such appointments were not followed by\nthe concerned appointing authority while making the appointments.\nArticle 64 (3-i)\nof Bihar Education Code\nempowers Inspectress of Schools to make temporary emergency appointments for 3 months without following\nthe required procedure but there is no provision to grant extension to such temporary teachers or to reappoint.\nThe enquiry however, has revealed that in almost all the cases repeated extensions were given and re-\nappointment letters were issued. Under\nArticle 64 (3-iii)\n, the Inspectress of Schools was required to furnish to\nthe Director Secondary Education, Bihar by the 16 th of April, of every calendar year, the particulars of\nqualifications, categories, etc, of all vacancies that were likely to occur within the following year, and wherein\nregular appointments were required to be made by following the proper procedure but this rule was not\nfollowed. No advertisement for the posts was ever made in the local newspaper nor the names were called\nthrough the regional Employment Exchange as was required under the rules. No Establishment/ Select\nCommittee was constituted to conduct test/interview to prepare a select list of the qualified and deserving\ncandidates to make recommendations for appointment of the successful candidates for the vacant posts of LSS\nteachers. No roster clearance regarding reservation of vacancies for each category for the post of general\nteachers, music teachers and craft teachers was obtained from DP & AR through Director Secondary Education\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n47/87\n\nprior to advertising the vacancies, if any, in the local newspaper/employment exchange. Contrary to the laid\ndown procedure, direct appointment letters were issued on the basis of recommendations of\npoliticians/authorities as mentioned in the Chart on\nAnalysis of Available Record and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report.\n\nThe enquiry has also revealed that in certain cases the applicants who did not possess the required\nqualifications of Matric Trained Teachers, were appointed in the lower scale of matric untrained teachers but\nsubsequently upon acquiring the matric trained qualifications, they were given the scale of matric trained\nteachers by the concerned appointing authority. It has also been revealed that in most of the cases, the\ncandidates submitting the applications for appointment as LSS teachers had declared self poverty, poor\neconomic conditions, being widow, being divorcee or deserted by husband etc. as special circumstances for\ntheir appointment to the post of LSS teachers, which grounds were considered and taken into account for their\nappointments.\n\nThe enquiry has further revealed that in March, 1988 an advertisement had appeared in the local\ndaily newspapers issued by Inspectress of Schools, Bihar inviting applications for the posts of\ngeneral/music/craft teachers in LSS grade. A number of applications were received in response to the said\nadvertisement. However, no teacher of General category whosoever had applied for the post was\nselected/appointed, though certain candidates were appointed for the post of General teacher whose\napplications were received duly recommended by the politicians. It is also revealed that no roster clearance for\nthe reservation of vacancies so advertised was obtained. A few number of craft/music and dance teachers were\nselected and given appointments as LSS teachers on the recommendations of a Select Committee constituted\nfor this purpose. As such these appointments have been shown as regular appointments in Chart of Analysis of\nAvailable Record and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report.\n\nThe enquiry has revealed that the post of LSS teachers (Primary Teacher's) in Government Girls Schools of\nBihar is under the direct control and supervision of Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna and is State cadre post\nand its appointing as well as disciplinary authority is Inspectress of Schools - cum - Dy. Director Secondary\nEducation, Bihar. However, on a number of occasions, in a number of cases Distt. Inspectresses of Schools of\nvarious districts of Bihar, who are not appointing authorities for LSS teachers were also allowed to make\nappointments of LSS teachers in Government Girls Schools within their respective districts. It is further revealed\nthat some of the teachers appointed prior to 1980 were appointed in similar manner in temporary capacity for\n3 months without following the proper procedure by the then Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna as has been\nfollowed by the Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna in this case during 1980 -98. The Distt. Inspectresses of\nSchools of the relevant districts have also made appointments/re appointments of LSS teachers in temporary\ncapacity for 3-6 months without following the proper procedure and have also granted repeated extensions to\nsuch temporary appointees against the rules. The Distt. Inspectress of Schools is not an authorised appointing\nauthority of LSS teachers and hence all the appointments made by Distt. Inspectresses of Schools during 1980\n\n-98 in their districts have been shown as irregular appointments in the Chart of Analysis of Available Record and\nEvidence enclosed as annexure to this report.\nThe enquiry has revealed that out of 305 appointments so made, no record is available in respect of 25\nappointments. The Chart of Analysis of Available Record' and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report\nreveals different irregularities committed by the said 46 appointing authorities, such as non-obtaining of roster\nclearance, non-advertisement of posts/vacancies in daily newspapers/ regional employment. exchange, non-\ncalling of names of the candidates through regional employment exchanges, non- observance of age limits.\nnon-observance of training/ educational qualification, non-observance of prescribed procedure, making\nappointments on the recommendations of politicians like MLAs, MLCS, Chief Minister, Education Minister, other\nMinisters and other authorities without following the prescribed procedure and making of appointments by\nunauthorised/ incompetent authorities etc.\nThe enquiry has revealed that Distt. Inspectresses of Schools of the relevant districts have also made\nappointments/ reappointments of LSS teachers in temporary capacity for 3-6 months without following the\nproper procedure and have also granted repeated extensions to such temporary appointees against the rules.\nThe Distt. Inspectress of Schools is not an authorised appointing authority of LSS teachers and hence all the\nappointments made by Distt. Inspectresses of Schools during 1980-98 in their districts have been concluded as\nirregular appointments in the Chart of Analysis of Available Record and. Evidence enclosed as annexure to this\nreport. It has also come to light that under\nArticle 97(xi)\nof Bihar Education Code, under the head of Powers of\nDistt Inspectresses of Schools, it has been laid down that District Inspectress of Schools is empowered to \"make\nappointment of Class-IV Government, Servant and of teachers in the scale of 50 - 90 or below under her control\nand to sanction pension to all such cases\". This power given to the Distt. Inspectresses. has been misunderstood\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n48/87\n\nas the appointing power of LSS teachers. However, The Distt. Inspectress of Schools cannot be the appointing\nauthority of LSS teachers due to the below mentioned reasons :-\n\ni. LSS teacher's post is a State Cadre Post under the direct control and supervision of\nInspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna who is the appointing authority for this post\nunder\narticle 64 (1-3).\n\nii. There can not be two appointing authorities for the same post i.e. Inspectress of\nSchools, Bihar and the District Inspectress of Schools.\n\niii. District Inspectresses are posted in the relevant districts under the control of\nInspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna to assist her in the work of control and\nsupervision of Government Girls Schools of Bihar and a person posted in a district\ncan not be the appointing authority of a state cadre post.\n\niv. The required Roster Register and seniority list of LSS teachers is being maintained\nby the Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna under supervision of Director Secondary\nEducation, Bihar whereas no such register and seniority list can be maintained' at a\ndistrict level for a State Cadre Post.\n\nv. The power of Distt. Inspectress under\narticle: 97(xi)\nhas been provided in respect of\nTake Over Girls Schools, if any, in her district. Now this power in respect of\nappointment in Take Over Schools is vested in a committee constituted under\nDistrict Education Officer/ Superintendent.\n\nvi. The Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand vide its order dated 9.6.2002 passed in CWJC\nNo. 1110 and 1119 of 1995 had held that \"neither the education code nor any of\nthe rules empowers Distt. Inspectress of Schools to be the appointing authority in\nrespect of appointment to the post of Matric Trained Teachers. The appointment of\nthe petitioners by the Distt. Inspectress of Schools is illegal and wholly without\njurisdiction\".\n\nvii. The appointing authority of a post is always the disciplinary authority of that post\nand vice-versa. The disciplinary authority in case of LSS teachers is Inspectress of\nSchools Bihar, Patna and not the Distt. Inspectress.\"\n\n(underline is mine)\n\n42. What surprised to this Court is that even though the\n\nCBI in its' preliminary report found that huge number of illegal\n\nappointments had been made contrary to the Rules which had in\n\nfact resulted in undue enrichment to the illegally appointed\n\nTeachers, the CBI did not register a regular case to prosecute\n\nthem and got contented by recommending the department\n\nconcerned as under:-\n\n\"4. CONCLUSION :\n\nIn view of the facts, circumstances and evidence discussed above, the matter is being referred to the\ndepartment with the recommendations as under :-\n\ni) Suitable Action as deemed fit against the appointees who have been irregularly appointed to be\ntaken by the Director, Secondary Education, Government of Bihar.\n\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n49/87\n\nii) Suitable Action as deemed fit against Smt. Shanti Devi, inspectress of School, Bihar, Smt.\nPrabhavati Kumar, Inspectress of School, Bihar, Smt. Manju Singh, Distt. Inspectress of School,\nBhojpur - Rohtas, ms. Meena Kumari Rai, Distt, inspectress of School, Bhojpur and Smt, Neeta\nKumari Pandey, Distt. Inspectress of School, Singhbuoom for making irregular appointments of\nLSS teachers.\n\niii) The Government of Bihar may initiate suitable measures to bring about system improvement in\nthe appointment of teachers and their monitoring by higher authority to ensure that such lapses as\nhave figured out in the present enquiry for not occur in future.\"\n\n43. Despite submission of the CBI report revealing\n\nstartling facts and then recommendation to the State Authorities,\n\nno action was taken for obvious reason. Right from the then\n\nPoliticians to the Assistant in the Education Department and a\n\nlarge number of officers who had made illegal appointments were\n\nlikely to suffer the consequences of legal action. The CBI report\n\nwas dumped. The State respondents at a much belated stage\n\nproceeded to take action only after the Hon'ble Division Bench of\n\nthis Court passed an order dated 19.09.2016 in C.W.J.C. No.\n\n10002 of 2016 (\nKaushal Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.\n).\n\nThe Hon'ble Division Bench having noticed that no action had\n\nbeen taken by the State respondents on the report of the CBI called\n\nupon the Principle Secretary of the Department, the Director,\n\nSecondary Education, Regional Deputy Director of Education,\n\nMagadh Division, Gaya to appear in Court. Subsequently, the\n\nHon'ble Division Bench was informed that actions have been\n\ntaken by the State upon recommendation of the CBI which are\n\nnow subject matter of large number of the individual writ petitions.\n\nTaking note of it, the Hon'ble Division Bench observed that as\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n50/87\n\nState has taken action, the writ petition had outlived its purpose. It\n\nwas, thus, permitted to be withdrawn.\n\n44. In this manner despite the fact that the department\n\nwas well aware about the illegal appointments made during the\n\nperiod 1980-98 and in fact an affidavit to this effect had been filed\n\nin C.W.J.C. No. 1690 of 1997 itself, the fact remains that inquiry\n\nwhich was initiated by the Cabinet (Vigilance) went in the hand of\n\nthe CBI and the CBI registered a preliminary inquiry in the year\n\n2001 which ended in submission of a preliminary report sometime\n\nin the year 2004 but no action was taken by the department\n\npursuant to the revelation made in the preliminary inquiry report\n\nof the CBI forwarded to the State Chief Secretary vide confidential\n\nLetter No. 3937 dated 3071-04. This shows complete inaction on\n\nthe part of the State respondents and calls upon this Court to take a\n\nview that there were concerted efforts inside the Department itself\n\nto delay any action against the petitioners and similarly situated\n\nillegal appointees and others involved in this racket of illegal\n\nappointments and it was done in order to confer them legitimacy\n\nby continuing in service for long years. The public money kept on\n\nflowing by way of salary, perks and other emoluments to the\n\nillegally appointed Teachers who enjoyed the benefit of service.\n\n45. In this Court, the petitioners have raised a submission\n\nthat the CBI report discriminates among the various Teachers whose\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n51/87\n\nappointments have been scrutinized by calling some of them illegal\n\nappointees whereas the others as irregular appointees. This Court need\n\nnot detain itself on this issue because what is illegal appointment and\n\nwhat would be irregular appointment in legal parlance have been well\n\ndiscussed by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of\nUma Devi\n(supra). The appointments which have taken place\n\nwithout there being any advertisement, without sanction post, by the\n\nauthorities who are not competent to make regular appointments and\n\nwithout there by any selection committee are illegal appointments and it\n\ndoes not matter if any one else says or claims that it will be a case of\n\nirregular appointment. Something which is illegal cannot be regularized\n\nand this issue is no longer a res intgra.\n\n46.\nIn a recent judgment in the case of the\nState of Bihar v.\n\nDevendra Sharma\nreported in (2020) 15 SCC 466, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court was dealing with the cases of illegal appointments in the\n\nHealth Department of the State of Bihar against Class III and Class IV\n\nPosts. About six thousands employees appointed by one Dr. Mallick the\n\nthen Assistant Director in the Health Department had been terminated.\n\nThose were challenged on the ground of violation of Principle of\n\nNatural Justice.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the said\n\nmatter noticed the views of the Constitution Bench in the case of\nUma\n\nDevi\n(supra) and held that in\nUma Devi\n(supra) the submission that the\n\nemployees had legitimate expectations was negated. In paragraph '46\n\nof the judgment it has been held as under:-\n\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n52/87\n\n\"46. ... The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the\nadministrative authority affect the person by depriving him of\nsome benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past\nbeen permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can\nlegitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there\nhave been communicated to him some rational grounds for\nwithdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to\ncomment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-\n\nmaker that they will not be withdrawn without giving him first an\nopportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should\nnot be withdrawn. ... There is no case that any assurance was\ngiven by the Government or the department concerned while\nmaking the appointment on daily wages that the status conferred\non him will not be withdrawn until some rational reason comes\ninto existence for withdrawing it. The very engagement was\nagainst the constitutional scheme.......\"\n\n47. The Hon'ble Supreme Court referred the\nState of\n\nMysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\nreported in (1967) 1 SCR 128 :\nAIR\n\n1967 SC 1071, R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\nreported in (\n1972)\n\n1 SCC 409 and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\nreported in\n\n(1979) 4 SCC 507 and held that there may be cases where irregular\n\nappointments (not illegal appointments) may be made as explained in\n\nthose judgments.\n\n48. The Hon'ble Supreme Court then approved the Full\n\nBench Judgment of Patna High Court in the case of\nRita Misha Vs.\n\nDirector, Primary Education\nreported in (AIR 1988 Pat 26) wherein\n\nthe question posed before the Hon'ble Full Bench was whether a public\n\nservant was entitled to payment of salary to him for the work done\n\ndespite the fact that his letter of appointment was forged, fraudulent or\n\nillegal. The Hon'ble Full Bench held as under:-\n\n\"13. It is manifest from the above that the rights to salary, pension\nand other service benefits are entirely statutory in nature in public\nservice. Therefore, these rights, including the right to salary,\nspring from a valid and legal appointment to the post. Once it is\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n53/87\n\nfound that the very appointment is illegal and is non est in the eye\nof the law, no statutory entitlement for salary or consequential\nrights of pension and other monetary benefits can arise. In\nparticular, if the very appointment is rested on forgery, no\nstatutory right can flow from it.\"\n\n49. The Hon'ble Supreme Court noticed an another Full\n\nBench judgment of this Court in the case of\nRam Sewak Yadav Vs.\n\nThe State of Bihar &Ors.\nreported in (2013) 1 PLJR 964 (FB)\n\nwherein the appellants were appointed on class IV post by the Civil\n\nSurgeon in the Health Department but their services were terminated for\n\nthe reasons that their appointments were illegal. The Hon'ble Full\n\nBench of this Court held in paragraph '41' as under:-\n\n\"41. The public power to make appointment on public posts is\nconferred for public good. The power is given to the officer\nconcerned by the Government in trust, that it shall be used and not\nabused. If the trust is belied, the protection conferred upon a\ngovernment servant stands denuded. The answerability and\naccountability is then individual of the officer. The Government is\nduty-bound to take appropriate civil/criminal action against the\nofficer. The illegality in the appointment is not a one way street. If\nthere was someone willing to pay a price for the job, there was\nanother waiting to take advantage of the same by fixing a price. It\nis not without reason that majority of such appointments relate to\nClass III and IV posts. The standard by which the Government\nprofesses to act is the same standard by which its actions shall be\njudged. Therefore whenever the Government terminates an\nappointment being illegal, it is the constitutional duty of the\nGovernment to simultaneously take action against the officials who\nbelied the trust of the Government. Those who made hay while the\nsun shined must see the darker cloudy days also. ......\"\n\n50.

No roster\nclearance was\nobtained and\nreservation rules\nwere also not\nfollowed. There are\nno proceedings of\nany select\ncommittee for her\nselection through\ninterview/test.\n\n51. In the facts of the matter, when this Court examined the\n\nsubmissions made on behalf of the petitioners, it is found that these\n\npetitioners were given ample opportunity of hearing. They were served\n\nwith the Memo of Charge and were allowed to participate in the inquiry.\n\nThey were also served with the copy of inquiry report and were given\n\ntime to submit their show cause. Thus, the principle of natural justice\n\nhave been fully complied with. No violation of procedure estabished by\n\nlaw could be shown to this Court. The petitioners, in fact, admit that\n\nthere was no advertisement in any newspaper. They claim that the posts\n\nwere advertised through the notice pasted in the office of the DI but this\n\nwould not come to their rescue. These are the cases of backdoor\n\nappointments and, hence, the appointment of the petitioners and\n\ncontinuance in service for all these years would not fetch any advantage\n\nin their favour. None of the petitioners have in fact dislodged the\n\nfinding of illegal appointment. They are not able to establish that their\n\nappointments were legal and valid in all respects. The credible findings\n\nin the CBI report are in fact not contested on any cogent ground.\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n62/87\n\n52.\nIn the case of\nDevendra Sharma\n(supra), the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has approved the view of the Hon'ble Full\n\nBench in the case of\nRam Sevak Yadav\n(supra) that illegal\n\nappointment which are void ab initio cannot be regularised in any\n\ncircumstances and question of regularization of their services even\n\nby interpreting paragraph '44' of the judgment in the case of\n\nUmadevi\n(3) (supra) would not arise.\n\n53. To this Court, it appears that these appointments are\n\nakin to and stand on similar footing with that of those Class III and\n\nClass IV employees who were appointed by Dr Mallick in the\n\nTuberculosis Eradication Scheme which were held ex facie illegal.\n\nIn fact in the cases of those appointees, the Court while dealing\n\nwith the submissions of the terminated employees in the case of\n\nAshwani Kumar and Others v. State of Bihar and Others\n\nreported in (1997) 2 SCC 1, held that those recruitments were\n\narbitrary, capricious and null and void after considering the\n\nGovernment Order dated December 3, 1980 as well as\n\nGovernment Resolution dated March 25, 1983. It was also held\n\nthat none of the appointees have any accrued right in the absence\n\nof sanctioned post and the whole exercise remained in the realm of\n\nan unauthorised adventure. It was held that army of the employees\n\nof the Scheme had got to be cleared lock, stock and barrel so that\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n63/87\n\npublic confidence in Government administration would not get\n\nshattered and arbitrary actions would not get sanctified. In these\n\ncases also the Government order and provisions of the Bihar\n\nEducation Code have been relied upon to show the appointments\n\nof these petitioners being wholly illegal and bad in Law.\n\n54. The Principles of nature justice stand fully complied\n\nwith and the petitioners cannot be allowed to take advantage of\n\ntheir continuance over all these years when the inquiry into these\n\nappointments was kept pending because all high-ups were\n\nallegedly involved in this scam of illegal appointments.\n\n55. Reliance placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nJharkhand High Court in the case of\nSushma Kumari @ Sushma\n\nKumari Devi versus the State of Jharkhand and Others\n(W.P.\n\n(S) No. 6023 of 2018) is wholly misconceived. In the said case, as\n\nit appears from the judgment itself, the fact was that there was an\n\nadvertisement notice on 21.09.1988 and a three member selection\n\ncommittee had been constituted for appointment of matric trained\n\nteacher. Petitioner was appointed through the selection process. No\n\nadverse remarks were made by CBI and CBI only recorded that the\n\n\"records were not available\". In the said case, the Deputy Director\n\nof Education had issued Order No. 4161 dated 22.04.1989,\n\ntherefore, it was held not a case of back door appointment. It is\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n64/87\n\nevident from bare reading of the Judgment of the Jharkhand High\n\nCourt that the facts of the said case were quite different and\n\ndistinct.\n\n56. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the he\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nRoop Singh\n\nNegi versus Punjab National Bank and Others\nreported in (2009) 2\n\nSCC 570 in the case of\nUnion of India & Ors. v. B.V. Gopinath\n\nreported in (2014) 1 SCC 351 to submit that in this case the State\n\nrespondents have not acted in consonance with the principles of\n\nnatural justice. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the charges\n\nlevelled against the delinquent officer must be found to have been\n\nproved and the enquiry officer has a duty to arrive at a finding upon\n\ntaking into consideration the materials brought on record by the parties.\n\nThe submission is that purported evidence collected during the\n\ninvestigation by the Investigating Officer against all the accused by\n\nitself would not be treated to be evidence in the disciplinary\n\nproceeding. Submission is that in this case no departmental witness\n\nappeared to prove the contents of the inquiry, therefore, it could not\n\nhave been treated as evidence.\n\nAt first instance the submission appears\n\nimpressive but then this Court is reminded of the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nBharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.\n\nv. N.R. Vairamani\nreported in (2004) 8 SCC 579 wherein the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has held that the judgment of the court cannot be cited\n\nlike an Euclid's theorem because a slight change in the facts of the case\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n65/87\n\nwould make a sea difference in the opinion of the court.\n\nIn the case of\n\nRoop Singh Negi\n(supra) there was an allegation against the delinquent\n\nemployee who was working as Manager in the branch office of the\n\nBank at Chandni Chauk, Delhi that he was responsible for the loss of\n\ndrawing book of which one of the two employees had been the\n\ncustodians and that the loss of drawing book would have been avoided\n\nhad they taken the due care and precaution. The employer had lodged a\n\nfirst information report and after five years when the disciplinary\n\nproceeding was initiated, the documents collected by the Investigating\n\nofficer were simply produced and the inquiry officer concluded that the\n\npetitioner Roop Singh Negi had direct or indirect links with the culprits.\n\nThe criminal court had already passed an order of discharge against the\n\npetitioner and it was brought to the notice of the inquiry officer but the\n\nsame was not considered.\n\nIn this background the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has been rendered in the case of\nRoop Singh\n\nNegi\n(supra). The facts of the present case are that of a mass scale\n\nillegal appointments by incompetent officers of the State on the\n\nrecommendation of the politicians without any advertisement and\n\nwithout any selection committee for the purpose. In these\n\ncircumstances, it is not only the CBI report which is the basis for\n\narriving at a conclusion that the appointment of the petitioners\n\n(Category I and II for the present) is illegal rather the appointments\n\nwere also against the relevant government circulars and the provisions\n\nof the Bihar Education Code. This is in the nature of scam and in such\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n66/87\n\ncases, it appears to this Court that 'situational modifications' with\n\nregard to application of principle of natural justice would be\n\npermissible.\n\nIn this regard this Court would quote the relevant part of\n\nthe judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nMohinder\n\nSingh Gill and Anr. Vs. The Chief Election Commissioner, New\n\nDelhi and Ors\nreported in AIR 1978 SC 851 wherein while dealing\n\nwith the issue of prejudice and the burden to prove prejudice, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has observed that the Court may not be taken to\n\nsay that \"situational modifications to notice and hearing are altogether\n\nimpermissible. They are, as the learned Addl. Solicitor-General rightly\n\nstressed. The glory of the law is not that sweeping rules are laid down\n\nbut that it tailors principles to practical needs, doctors remedies to suit\n\nthe patient, promotes, not freezes, life's processes, if we may mix\n\nmetaphors.\"\nTucker, LJ drove home this point when he observed in the\n\nDuke of Norfolk case (1949) 1 All ER 109) in the following words:-\n\n\"There are no words which are of universal application to every\nkind of inquiry .... The requirements of natural justice must\ndepend 14on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the\ninquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject-\nmatter that is being dealt with, and so forth.\"\n\nThis circumstantial flexibility of fair hearing has been\nunderscored in\nWiseman v. Borneman\n(1971) AC 297 by Lord\nReid when he said he would be \"sorry to see this fundamental\ngeneral principle degenerate into a series of hard-and-fast rules\".\n\n57. This Court therefore, finds that the judgments of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of\nRoop Singh Negi\n(supra) and\nB.\n\nV. Gopinath\n(supra) has not laid down a hard and fast rule and would\n\nnot be applicable in the facts situation of the present case.\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n67/87\n\n58. Learned counsel has relied upon some judgments of this\n\nCourt rendered by learned co-ordinate Benches of this Court in the case\n\nof\nMamta Verma Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (C.W.J.C. No.\nof 2022) and Kumari Manju Lata Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.\n\n(C.W.J.C. No.\n3361 of 2020) to submit that forfeiture of 100 %\n\npension of the petitioner in exercise of power under Rule 43(b) of the\n\nPension Rules at this stage cannot be sustained. It is submitted that the\n\nappointment of the petitioners had taken place more than 30 years ago,\n\ntherefore, the Memo under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules would be\n\ninvalid.\n\n59. This Court finds from the materials placed before this\n\nCourt that in these cases of Category I, the proceeding under Rule 43(b)\n\nof the Pension Rules was initiated during the service period itself and\n\nthose were converted after retirement of the petitioners and further in\n\ntheir first round of litigation, this Court had though quashed the\n\nimpugned order of termination but at the same time granted liberty to\n\nthe Regional Deputy Director of the concerned Divisions to proceed\n\nafresh. Sofar as the Category III cases are concerned, in those cases, the\n\nfinal decision is yet to be taken.\n\n60.\nIn the totality of the circumstances, since this Court has\n\nfound that this is a case akin to and seems to be nearer to the case of\n\nappointments of Class III and Class IV posts in the Tuberculosis\n\nEradication Scheme by Dr. Mallick and this Court has noticed the\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n68/87\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nDevendra\n\nSharma\n(supra), this Court finds no reason to interfere with the same.\n\n61. This Court is therefore, of the considered opinion that the\n\nimpugned orders need no interference in exercise of power of this\n\nCourt under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nCategory II Cases\n\n62. In the category II cases, there are altogether nine writ\n\napplications. For reference, this Court would take the pleadings from\n\nCWJC No. 354 of 2023 (\nNirmala Vs. State of Bihar and Ors\n).\n\n63. In this writ application, the petitioner has challenged the\n\norder dated 09.12.2022 passed by State Appellate Authority in O.A. No.\n\n419 of 2022 and also Memo No. 462 dated 09.10.2020 passed by\n\nDirector (Administration) -cum- Additional Chief Secretary, Education\n\nDepartment, Government of Bihar (Respondent No. 2). The petitioners\n\nhave also prayed for grant and payment of retiral benefits along with all\n\nother consequential benefits.\n\n64. By the impugned order, the service of the petitioners\n\nhave been terminated. The order of termination/dismissal from service\n\nwas challenged by the petitioner Nirmala Bhartibefore the State\n\nAppellate Authority. The Chairperson (A) and the State Appellate\n\nAuthority held that there was a departmental proceeding conducted after\n\ncalling for an explanation from the petitioner. The petitioners were\n\nprovided with a copy of the inquiry report and an opportunity to show\n\ncause, therefore, the principle of natural justice has been duly followed.\n\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n69/87\n\nThe appeal preferred by the petitioner has been disallowed. So far as\n\nother petitioners are concerned, they have also been dismissed from\n\nservice on the ground that they were illegally appointed and their\n\nappointments were void ab initio.\n\n65.

One person, namely, Sanjay Bihari Pandit is a male\n\nbut was appointed in LSS (women) cadre.\n\n71. In C.W.J.C. No. 439 of 2022 and C.W.J.C. No. 4981\n\nof 2022, the petitioners have also challenged the inquiry report.\n\nThe facts of C.W.J.C. No. 693 of 2022 (\nSmt. Tara Singh Vs. The\n\nState of Bihar and Ors\n) are slightly different inasmuch as against\n\nher a proceeding under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules has been\n\ninitiated vide Memo No. 1388 dated 24.11.2021 (Annexure '11' to\n\nthe writ application). She has been served with a memo of charge\n\ndated 24.11.2021 (Annexure '12'). It is her contention that she has\n\nsuperannuated from her service on 30.11.2014 itself. It, however,\n\ntranspires on perusal of Annexure '11' to the writ application that\n\nthe proceedings were initiated against this petitioner earlier and the\n\nsame was converted into a proceeding under Rule 43(b) of the\n\nPension Rules vide Memo No. 1855 dated 24.08.2016 which was\n\nwithin a period of two years from the date of her attaining the age\n\nof superannuation. By Annexure '11', the Inquiry Officer and\n\nPresenting Officer have been appointed. As regards the petitioner\n\nSmt. Tara Singh, CBI has found in its preliminary report that she\n\nwas over-aged and had been appointed on the recommendation of\n\nthe politicians without following proper procedure for such\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n83/87\n\nappointments. No advertisement of the post was made by any local\n\nnewspaper.\n\n72. The materials available on the record would show\n\nthat this petitioner has been called upon to participate in the\n\ninquiry by Letter No. 513 dated 17.12.2006. In the writ\n\napplication, there is no averment that the proceeding against the\n\npetitioner was not converted under Rule 43(b) in the year 2016.\n\nHer alleged illegal appointment took place in the year 1982 but\n\nthat illegality allegedly continued till her retirement, therefore, a\n\nchallenge to the initiation of the proceeding under Rule 43(b)\n\nwould not be tenable.\n\n73. Be that as it may, this Court is of the considered\n\nopinion that the petitioners in category III should have co-operated\n\nin course of inquiry by submitting their response and participation\n\nbefore the Inquiry Officer and the disciplinary authority. Instead of\n\ndoing that, their effort is to somehow prolong the ongoing inquiry\n\nand culmination of the disciplinary proceeding. In their cases also,\n\nthe principle of natural justice is being followed by the State-\n\nrespondents.\n\n74. Thus, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the\n\nimpugned office memo, the charge and/or the inquiry report in this\n\nwrit application. The petitioners must participate in the inquiry,\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n84/87\n\nsubmit their second show cause within a period of two weeks from\n\ntoday whereupon the Inquiry Officer/ disciplinary authority, as the\n\ncase may be, shall proceed in the matter and take appropriate\n\nsteps/decision. If they have attained the age of superannuation, the\n\ndisciplinary authority shall consider converting the proceeding\n\nunder Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules and pass an appropriate\n\norder within three months from the said date.\n\n75. Before this Court parts with its judgment, the Court\n\nfinds it just and proper to record that in all these writ applications,\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioners have raised plea of violation of\n\nprinciples of natural justice. They have gone to the extent of\n\nsubmitting that the CBI has not examined the appointees, however,\n\nthis Court has noticed from the preliminary report of the CBI that\n\nthey have examined some of the appointees also. The petitioners\n\nhave been given enough opportunity to rebut the specific case of\n\nthe respondent-State in term of the Memo of Charge that the\n\nappointments in Category-I and Category-II cases were done\n\nwithout advertisement and selection procedure. In category-III\n\ncases the State-Respondent have served second show cause on the\n\npetitioners. This Court is of the considered opinion that where the\n\nillegality writs large on the face of the kind of allegations made in\n\nthe preliminary inquiry, the principle of natural justice cannot be\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n85/87\n\nstretched to the extent of rejecting the report of the CBI as a waste\n\npaper. It is to be remembered that the matter relating to illegal\n\nappointments of these petitioners were raised as back as in the year\n\n1998 and the inquiry report of the CBI was submitted in the year\n\n2004 itself. But it was kept pending for no valid reason and had the\n\nHon'ble Division Bench of this Court not called upon the Principal\n\nSecretary of the Education Department, Government of Bihar to\n\nexplain as to why no action has been taken on the inquiry report of\n\nthe CBI, the matter would have remained as it is.\n\n76. The huge delay on the part of the State respondents\n\nby sitting over the preliminary inquiry report of the CBI has done\n\na lot of damage to the interest of the State. The delay alone has\n\ngiven rise to a spacious plea that at this stage the petitioners have\n\ncontinued over 30 years, therefore, no action may be taken against\n\nthem in accordance with law. Although this Court has negated this\n\nplea but at the same time it is noticed that by virtue of the\n\nappointments which were wholly illegal, public money has been\n\ndisbursed to the illegal appointees conferring them the benefits of\n\npay and perks during all these years. This Court being a\n\nconstitutional Court sitting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia deems it just and proper to take judicial notice of the\n\nprinciples of public accountability. The case of Vineet Narain and\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n86/87\n\nOrs. Vs. the Union of India and Ors.\nreported in (1996) 2 SCC\n\n199, is a step forward towards accountability in public life. The\n\npreliminary investigation report of the CBI is clearly indicating\n\ntowards extraneous consideration which has taken place in the\n\nmatter of large scale appointments and promotions in the LSS\n\n(Women wing) in the State of Bihar during the period 1980-1998.\n\nThe case was handed over to CBI but why CBI remained\n\ncontented by only submitting a preliminary inquiry report is\n\nsomething which is required to be looked into by the CBI itself at\n\nthis stage. This Court is concerned because it is of the opinion that\n\nthose who were involved in keeping aside the law and the\n\nprocedures for appointment on public post should not be allowed\n\nto go scot-free only because they have succeeded in somehow\n\nstalling the consequential action. In the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion as under:-\n\n(i) The CBI should take the case to a logical end. Its'\n\npreliminary inquiry report is available on the record indicating the\n\nmanner in which appointments were done on political\n\nrecommendations and by the authorities in the Education Department\n\nwho were not competent, without advertisement and without there being\n\nany selection process. The CBI is, therefore, obliged to consider as to\n\nwhether or not its' preliminary report should be converted in a regular\nPatna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n87/87\n\ncase and the matter be investigated in accordance with law for its\n\nlogical conclusion; and\n\n(ii) The Additional Chief Secretary of the Education\n\nDepartment, Government of Bihar is also required to look into the\n\nreason(s) for the huge delay in not taking the consequential action\n\npursuant to the report of the CBI submitted in the year 2004. Those who\n\nare behind this inaction are required to be identified and appropriate\n\naction is to be considered.\n\n77. Accordingly, this Court having taken judicial notice\n\nof the above mentioned facts emerging from the pleadings on the\n\nrecord and finding that the CBI is already party respondent in\n\nsome of the writ applications, directs the Director, CBI and the\n\nAdditional Chief Secretary, Department of Education, Government\n\nof Bihar to consider taking appropriate action within a period of\n\none month from the date of receipt/communication of this order.\n\n78. These writ applications are, thus, disposed of in the\n\naforesaid terms.\n\n(Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J)\navin/-\n\nAFR/NAFR AFR\nCAV DATE 12.09.2023\nUploading Date 26.09.2023\nTransmission Date",
