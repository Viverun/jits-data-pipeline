Six of the\nUnions representing the employees amicably settled the\ndisputes with the Board which granted increases in dearness\nallowance on the other demands being given up. The seventh\nUnion declined to accept the settlement and the dispute was\neventually referred for adjudication by the Industrial\nTribunal. Before the Tribunal took up the reference, all\nexcept 466 of the employees individually accepted the\nsettlement.\nAt the hearing of the reference it was contended by the\nremaining employees through the seventh Union that the total\nwage packet including the dearness allowance claimed by them\nwould only satisfy the requirement of a minimum wage and the\nBoard's capacity to pay the increases demanded was,\ntherefore, irrelevant; furthermore, although the Board was\nan industry in the public sector, it must also be made to\npay wages on the same basis as private sector employers; two\nelectric supply companies in \",the area were paving wages\nwhich were much higher and there was no justification for\nrefusing the demand for additional dearness allowance which\nwould place the employees of the Board on par with the\n,employees of those companies.\nThe Tribunal in its award rejected all the workmen's\ndemands. It found that the demand for increased dearness\nallowance was not confined to achieving a minimum wage but\nas a result of its acceptance the wages would be above the\nminimum wage. The Tribunal also found that the Board having\ninherited an accumulated deficit of over Rs. 2 crores from\nits predecessor, the Bombay State Electricity Board, having\nsustained heavy losses in its working and having undertaken\na further liability to pay increased dearness allowance, it\nhad no capacity to undertake the further burden of paying\nabout Rs. 49 lakhs per year as increased dearness allowance\nor to meet the other demands. The Tribunal held that the\nposition in the other two electric supply companies was not\ncomparable 'with the Board.\nIn appeal to this Court against the award it was contended\ninter alia, that the Tribunal was wrong in judging the\ncapacity of the Board after taking into account the deficit\nof Rs. 2 crores which it had inherited from its predecessor;\nand that the financial capacity of the Board should 174\nhave been judged only on the basis of its commercial\nundertaking excluding the activities of the Board which were\nin the nature of national duties.\nHELD : The Tribunal had rightly rejected the demands of the\nappellants.\n(i) As the appellants had failed to show that they would\nnot be receiving the minimum wage with their basic pay and\nthe increased dearness allowance offered by the Board, the\nfinancial capacity of the Board for acceding to the demands\nmade became a relevant consideration.\nHindustan Antibiotics Ltd. v. The Workmen & Others, [1967] 1\nS.C.R. 652 and The Hindustan Times Ltd. v. Their Workmen,\n[1964] 1 S.C.R. 234 referred to.\nAlthough the deficit inherited by the Board from its\npredecessor could not be treated as -a revenue loss for\ndetermining the Board's financial capacity and was in the\nnature of a capital loss, even this loss could not be\ncompletely ignored. Apart from this, it was clear 'On the\nfacts that during three years after its formation the Board-\nhad incurred heavy losses of about Rs. 110 lakhs and it did\nnot, therefore, have the capacity of bearing the additional\nfinancial burden involved in meeting the appellants'\ndemands. [179 D-F; 180 E]\n(ii) When the Board was constituted under the\nElectricity\n(Supply) Act\nNo. 54 of 1948 and was, by its constitution,\ncharged with the general duty of promoting the coordinated\ndevelopment of the generation, supply and distribution of\nelectricity within the State, its capacity to bear the\nburden of paying wages to its employees had to be worked out\nafter taking into account all the activities which the\nstatute required it to carry on. The running of power\nhouses was only one of the branches of those activities.\nThe profit that the Board earned could only be worked out\nafter including in the accounts all the expenditure incurred\nby it on all its development and other schemes for\ndistribution of electricity to consumers in urban and rural\nareas. [181 B-D]\nWhile an industry in the public sector was not exempt from\napplication of principles which apply to an industry in the\nprivate sector and the respondent board must also be made to\npay wages on the same basis as private sector employers the\nadditional burden in either sector for paying anything above\na minimum wage can only be justifiably imposed in industrial\nadjudication if the employer bad the capacity to meet that\nburden. [181 E-F]\nThe Tribunal had rightly held that neither of the other two\nelectric companies were comparable with the Board. These\ntwo companies merely carried on the activity of direct\nsupply of electricity to consumers in the towns and cities\nwhereas the functions of the Board included the development\nand execution of schemes for supply of electricity to new\nareas.\nWilliamsons (India) Private Ltd. v. Its Workmen [1962] 1\nL.L.J. 302, referred to.\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2431 of 1966.\nAppeal by special leave from the Award of the Industrial\nTribunal, Gujarat in Reference (IT) NO. 88 of 1962.\nA. S. R. Chari, M. K. Ramamurthi, Shyamala Pappu, Vineet\nKumar, P. S. Khera and Bindra Thakur, for the appellants.\nI. N. Shroff, for the respondent.\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nBhargava, J. This appeal, by special leave, is directed\nagainst an Award of the Industrial Tribunal, Gujarat, in an\nindustrial dispute referred to it by the Government of\nGujarat at the instance of the appellants who are 466\nworkmen of the Gujarat Electricity Board, Baroda\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Board\") represented by the\nSaurashtra Vidyut Kamdar Sangh (hereinafter referred to as\n\"the Sangh\"). The dispute referred to related to two\nmatters. One was the demand made in respect of rates of\ndearness allowance to be paid to the workmen. The second\ndemand was that those of the workmen, to whom Contributory\nProvident Fund or Employees Provident Fund scheme was appli-\ncable, should be granted gratuity equal to 15 days wages for\nevery year of service in addition to the provident fund\nbenefits, while those workmen, who were entitled to pension\naccording to the pensionary scheme in force, should have\ntheir pension calculated after adding 50 per cent of the\ndearness allowance to the basic pay.\n\nThe facts needed to explain the second demand may first be\nstated. The supply of electricity in the State of\nSaurashtra, prior to the year 1954, was being carried out\ndepartmentally by the Government of Saurashtra and the\nworkmen employed in the power houses were, consequently,\nGovernment servants. On 1st July, 1954, a Saurashtra\nElectricity Board was constituted to run the power houses\nand the employees of the Electricity Department of the\nGovernment were sent to work with the Saurashtra Electricity\nBoard on deputation. On 1st November, 1956, Saurashtra\nbecame a part of the Bombay State, hereafter the Saurashtra\nElectricity Board was dissolved with effect from 1st April,\n1957 and its assets, liabilities, and employees were taken\nover by the Bombay State Electricity Board. The employees,\nwho were originally in the service of the Saurashtra State\nGovernment were entitled to the pensionary scheme of the\nSaurashtra Government, while the Bombay State Electricity\nBoard had a Provident Fund Scheme. The Saurashtra State\nGovernment servants, on being taken over by the Bombay State\nElectricity Board, were given the option of either\ncontinuing in their pensionary scheme, or of joining the\nProvident Fund Scheme of the Bombay State Electricity Board\nin which case the gratuity already accrued to them and the\nequivalent of pensionary benefits were credited to their\naccounts. Some of the employees opted for the Provident\nFund Scheme, while others continued under the pensionary\nscheme. Thereafter, on 1st May, '1960, the State of Bombay\nwas bifurcated and a separate State of Gujarat was\nconstituted; and, with effect from the same date, the Board\ncame into existence. The Board ;took over all the\nelectricity, power-houses ,and electricity schemes in the\nState of Gujarat from the Bombay State Electricity Board,\nincluding the workmen who are the appellants in this\n\n-appeal. The assets and liabilities of the Bombay State\nElectricity Board were divided between the Board, and the\nMaharashtra Electricity Board which was constituted for the\nState of Maharashtra which came into existence on\nbifurcation of the Bombay State. The Board continued both\nthe Pensionary Scheme as well as the Provident Fund Scheme\nfor the employees in the manner they were in force when the\nemployees were working under the Bombay State Electricity\nBoard. The employees, who were originally servants of the\nState Government, had ceased to be government servants with\neffect from 1st April, 1957 and later on 1st May 1960,\nbecame the employees of the Board, so that they were no\nlonger entitled to the rights which the State Government\nmight subsequently grant in respect of pension under the\nrules applicable to the government servants. The result was\nthat even improvements granted in the pensionary scheme by\nthe State Government to its employees did not enure to the\nbenefit of the appellants. In these circumstances, the\nSangh put forward the claim that the pension of employees,\nwho were governed by the pensionary scheme, should be\ncalculated not on the basis of basic salary, but after\nadding 50 per cent of the dearness allowance to it. In\nrespect of employees, who were governed by the Provident\nFund Scheme, a second benefit of gratuity was claimed.\nThe demand for dearness allowance was that it should be\nlinked with the scale prescribed for the Ahmedabad\nMillowners' Association. The workmen demanded that\nemployees, drawing up to Rs. 50 as basic pay, should be\ngiven dearness allowance at the scale applicable to\nAhmedabad Millowners' Association, those drawing between Rs.\n50 to Rs. 100, D.A. at that scale plus Rs. 5, and those\ndrawing above Rs. 100, dearness allowance at that scale plus\nRs. 10. This demand was put forward before the Board\noriginally on behalf of all the 9,208 employees of Class III\nand Class TV and some employees of Class I and Class II\nwhose salary was below Rs. 300 per mensem, who were working\neither in the Gujarat Region or the Saurashtra Region.\nThese employees were represented by seven different Unions,\none of which was the Sangh who represented about 3,000\nemployees working in the Saurashtra region. The six Unions\nrepresenting the employees working in the Gujarat region\namicably settled these disputes with the Board by entering\ninto agreements. The\n17 8\nBoard gave some increase in dearness allowance\nretrospectively with effect from 1st October, 1961, while\nthe second demand relating to gratuity and calculation of\npension after adding 50 per cent of the dearness allowance\nwas given up. The Sangh declined to accept this settlement,\nwhereupon the Board offered terms in accordance with the\nsettlement to all the employees in the Saurashtra region\nindividually. Out of the total of 3,042 in the Saurashtra\nregion, 622 signed General Standing Order 56, under which\nthe Board had made its offer to individual employees ,on the\nbasis of the settlements arrived at before the reference to\nconciliation. 1152 signed before the date of the failure\nreport by the Conciliation Officer; 2058 signed before the\nreference and 518 signed after the reference. Thus, the\ndispute, after the reference, became confined to the\nremaining 466 employees who did not, on individual basis,\naccept the offer made by the Board.\nThe Tribunal considered\nthis dispute relating to the dearness allowance raised by\nthese employees through the Sangh as also the other demand\nrelating to gratuity and calculation of pension, and, by the\nimpugned Award, rejected these demands. Consequently, the\nworkmen have come up in this appeal through the Sangh.\nThe main ground for rejecting these demands, on which the\nAward is based, is that the Board does not have the capacity\nto meet the additional expenditure that would have to be\nincurred if these demands are acceded to Before the\nTribunal, this aspect of the case was sought to be met by\nthe Sangh by urging that the total wage packet, including\nthe dearness allowance claimed by them in the demand, would\nonly satisfy the requirement of a minimum wage, so that the\nBoard's capacity to pay was irrelevant; but the award shows\nthat- the Sangh completely failed to provide any material to\nprove that the total wages, including the dearness allowance\nas offered by the Board on the basis of the settlements, are\nless than the minimum wage. This Court, in\nHindustan\nAntibiotics Ltd. v. The Workmen & Others\n(1), recognised the\nthree concepts of minimum wage, fair wage, and living wage\nby quoting the following passage from the decision in\nThe\nHindustan Times Ltd. v. Their Workmen\n(2), and stating that\nit briefly and neatly defined the three concepts :\n\n\"In trying to keep true to the two points of social\nphilosophy and economic necessities which vie for\nconsideration, industrial adjudication has set to itself\ncertain standards in the matter of wage fixation. At the\nbottom of the ladder, there is the minimum basic\n(1) [1957] 1 S.C.R. 652.\n\n(2) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234.\nwage which the employer of any industrial\nlabour must pay in order to be allowed to\ncontinue an industry. Above this is the fair\nwage, which may roughly be said to approximate\nto the need based minimum, in the sense of a\nwage which is \"adequate to cover the normal\nneeds of the average employee regarded as a\nhuman being in a civilised society\". Above\nthe fair wage is the \"living wage\"-a wage\n'which will maintain the workman in the\nhighest state of industrial efficiency, which\nwill enable him to provide his family with all\nthe material things which are needed for their\nhealth and physical well-being, enough to\nenable him to qualify to discharge his duties\nas a citizen.\"\n\nThese decisions make it clear that, if the claim be for a\nminimum wage, the employer must pay that wage in order to be\nallowed to continue the industry; and, in such a case, the\ncapacity of the industry to pay is irrelevant. However, if\nthe industry is already paying the minimum wage, and the\nclaim is for fair wage or living wage, the capacity of the\nindustry to pay is a very important factor, and the burden\nabove the minimum wage can only be justifiably imposed if\nthe industry is capable of meeting that extra burden. On\nthis principle, in the present case, if the appellants had\nsucceeded in showing that they were not receiving even the\nminimum wage on the basis of the offer made by the Board in\nline with the settlements arrived at with the other Unions-\nand individual workmen members of the Sangh, there would\nhave been full justification for granting additional\ndearness allowance, ignoring the inability of the Board to\nmeet that extra expenditure. The finding of the Tribunal,\nhowever, is that the demand of the workmen is not confined\nto minimum wage, but that, as a result of the demand, the\nwages will be above the minimum wage. Learned counsel\nappearing for the appellants before us did not try to\ncontend that the wages which were being paid by the Board,\nwere lower than the minimum wage, so that the claim for the\nadditional dearness allowance cannot be considered without\ntaking into account the capacity of the Board to meet the\nexpenditure.\n\nSo far as the question of capacity of the board to pay is\nconcerned, there is a clear finding by the Tribunal that the\nBoard is running at heavy losses, so that it is not in a\nposition to meet the extra expenditure of about Rs. 49 lakhs\na year which will be involved if the dearness allowance is\nfixed as claimed by the Sangh. The Tribunal has found that\nthe Board, when constituted on 1st May, 1960, inherited an\naccumulated deficit 'of over Rs. 2 crores from the Bombay\nState Electricity Board. In its own working, the Board\nsustained a loss of over Rs. 29 lakhs between 1st May, 1960\nand 31st March, 1961, and in\nthe two succeeding years 1961-62 and 1962-63, the losses in-\ncurred were in the region of Rs. 39 lakhs and Rs. 41 lakhs.\nThe Tribunal, thus, held that the total loss was to the tune\nof Rs. 31 millions; and since the Board had undertaken a\nfurther liability of over Rs. 6.75 lakhs a year under the\nsettlements and the offer to individual workmen, it could\nnot possibly undertake the further burden of paying about\nRs. 49 lakhs per year as increased dearness allowance. The\nTribunal was also of the opinion that, considering this\nfinancial condition of the Board, there was no justification\nfor introducing a gratuity scheme for workmen governed by\nthe Provident Fund Rules, nor was there any justification\nfor calculation of pension on the basis of adding 50 per\ncent of the dearness allowance to the basic pay. Mr. Chari,\ncounsel for the appellants, challenged this decision of the\nTribunal on two grounds. The first ground was that the\nTribunal was wrong in judging the capacity of the Board to\npay after taking into account the deficit of over Rs. 2\ncrores which it had inherited from the Bombay State\nElectricity Board; and the second ground was that the\nfinancial capacity of the Board should be judged only on the\nbasis of its commercial undertakings, excluding the\nactivities of the Board which were in the nature of national\nduties.\n\nSo far as the first point is concerned, we think that there\nis some force in the submission made by learned counsel.\nThe deficit inherited by the Board from its predecessor\ncannot be treated as are venue loss which will have bearing\non its paying capacity. Such inherited deficit should\nreally have been treated as capital loss; but even this loss\ncannot be completely ignored, because the paying capacity of\nan employer has to take into account even capital losses.\nHowever, even if this accumulated deficit- of over Rs. 2\ncrores is ignored, it is clear that, during the three years\nafter its formation, the Board itself incurred heavy losses\nwhich totaled to about Rs. 110 lakhs. Consequently, even\nif that accumulated deficit is not taken into account, it\ncannot be held that the Board will have the capacity of\nbearing the additional financial burden to the tune of Rs.\n49 lakhs a year, if required to pay dearness allowance at\nthe rates claimed by the Sangh.\n\nOn the second point, we are unable to accept the submission\nmade by learned counsel. The Board was constituted under\nthe\nElectricity (Supply) Act\nNo. 54 of 1948, and\nsection 18\n\nof that Act lays down the duties of the Board. By its very\nconstitution, the Board is charged with the general duty of\npromoting the coordinated development of the generation,\nsupply and distribution of electricity within the State in\nthe most efficient and economical manner, with particular\nreference to such develop-\nment in areas not for the time being served or adequately\nserved by any licensee. In particular, the duty of the\nBoard is to prepare and carry out schemes with the objects\nmentioned above; to supply electricity to owners of\ncontrolled stations and to licensees whose stations are\nclosed down under this Act; and to supply electricity as\nsoon as practicable to any other licensees or persons\nrequiring such supply and whom the Board may be competent\nunder this Act so to supply. When the Board was constituted\nto carry out these duties, its capacity to bear the burden\nof paying wages to its employees has to be worked out after\ntaking into account all the activities which the Statute\nrequires it to carry on. The running of Power Houses is\nonly one of the branch of those activities. The profit that\nthe Board can be held to have earned can only be worked out\nafter including in the accounts all the expenditure incurred\nby it on all its schemes for distribution of electricity to\nlicensees or to consumers, whether in urban areas or in\nrural areas. In fact, there is not even an assertion on\nbehalf of the appellants-workmen that they were employed\nsolely in connection with a profitable undertaking of the\nBoard and had nothing to do at all with the other activities\nwhich the Board is actually carrying on. No doubt, learned\ncounsel is right in urging on the basis of the decision of\nthis Court in Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd() that the\ncircumstance that the Board is an industry in the public\nsector does not exempt it from application of principles\nwhich apply to an industry in private sector, and the Board\nmust also be made to pay wages on the same basis as Private\nsector employers. This, however, does not advance the case\nof the appellants, because, even in a private sector,\nadditional burden over and above a minimum wage can only be\njustifiably imposed in industrial adjudication, if the\nemployer has the capacity to meet that burden. In this\ncase, the Tribunal has refused to grant the demand of the\nappellants not on the ground that the Board is an industry\nin public sector, but on the ground that it does not have\nthe capacity to pay. That capacity has rightly been judged\non the basis of all the undertakings being worked by the\nBoard.\n\nThe Tribunal, after holding that there was no justification\nfor granting the demands of the workmen because the Board\nhad no capacity to bear the additional burden, proceeded\nfurther to examine whether the Board's existing scheme of\npayment of dearness allowance was reasonable and took into\naccount various factors for arriving at its finding that it\ncould not be held that the terms offered by the Board were\nunreasonable. In this connection, reliance was placed on\nbehalf of the appellants on the fact that two Electric\nSupply Companies were paying wages which\n(1) [1967]1 S.C.R.652.\nwere much higher than the wages being paid by the Board, and\nthere was no justification for refusing the demand for\nadditional dearness allowance which would place the\nemployees of the Board on par with the employees of those\nElectric Supply Companies. One of those Electric Supply\nCompanies is the Ahmedabad Electricity Co. Ltd., Ahmedabad,\nin whose case wages were fixed by an Award published in 1956\nIndustrial Court Reporter at p. 746. The other is the\nViramgam Electric Supply Co. Ltd., Viramgam, the Award\nrelating to which is published in 1968 Industrial Court\nReporter at p. 1010. The argument was that wages paid by\nthe Board should not be lower than those paid by these two\nElectric Supply Companies which were engaged in the same\nline of business of production and supply of electricity.\nThe Tribunal brushed aside these example by stating that\nthey were not comparable with the Board. In taking this\nview, we do not think that the Tribunal committed an error.\n\nIn\nWilliamsons (India) Private Ltd. v. Its Workmen\n(1), this\nCourt clearly laid down what criteria had been established\nfor considering what are comparable concerns when dealing\nwith a question of wage fixation. It was held :-\n\n\"This Court has repeatedly observed that, in\nconsidering the question about comparable\nconcerns, tribunals should bear in mind all\nthe relevant facts in relation to the problem.\nThe extent of the business carried by the\nconcerns, the capital invested by them, the\nprofits made by them, the nature of the\nbusiness carried on by them, their standing,\nthe strength of their labour force, the\npresence or absence and the extent of reser-\nves, the dividends declared by them and the\nprospects about the future of their business-\nthese and all other relevant facts have to be\nborne in mind.\"\n\nIn the present case, it is clear that, if these various\nfactors are taken into account, neither the Ahmedabad\nElectricity Co. Ltd., nor the Viramgam Electric Supply Co.,\ncan be held to be a concern comparable with the Board. As\nwe have indicated earlier, the activities carried on by the\nBoard are not only production of electricity and direct\ndistribution in some areas, but also include preparation of\nschemes for development of supply of electricity in areas\nnot served so far and for supply of electricity to licen-\nsees. The two concerns at Ahmedabad and Viramgam merely\ngenerate and supply electricity to consumers in the cities\nor towns served by them. The Board, according to the Act\nconstituting it, has primarily to supply electricity to\nlicensees, and not confine its supply to direct consumers\nlike these two concerns. The\n(1) [1962] 1 L.L.J.302.\nsupply to consumers is only undertaken where there are no\nlicensees to undertake the distribution of electricity\ngenerated by the Board, and this activity of direct supply\nto consumers is primarily carried on in rural areas where\nthe population is sparsely distributed as compared to the\ncities or towns served by the other two concerns. Then,\nthere is the important factor that the Board is running at a\nhuge loss every year. The workmen did not provide figures\nto show what was the profitability of the other two\nconcerns, though the Awards in their cases seem to indicate\nthat both of them are running at a profit. In these\ncircumstances, we cannot hold that the Tribunal committed\nany error in ignoring the wages being paid by these two\nconcerns, when dealing with the question of payment of\ndearness allowance by the Board. In this connection, a\nrequest was made by learned counsel that we may remand the\ncase to the Tribunal in order to enable the Sangh to produce\nevidence to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that these two\nconcerns are comparable, or to cite examples of other\nundertakings in the same industry in the Saurashtra region,\nor, it there be no such undertakings available, of\nundertakings in other industries in the Saurashtra region so\nas to enable the Saingh to claim wages on parity with those\nundertakings. We do not think that there is any\njustification for remanding the case for such a purpose at\nthis stage. It was open to the Sangh to produce material\nbefore the Tribunal when the dispute was first investigated\nby it, and no reason is shown why the Sangh did not do so.\nFurther, as we have indicated earlier, the very circumstance\nthat the Board does not have the financial capacity to meet\nthe additional burden of the demands made by the workmen\njustifies the order made by the Tribunal. The further\nrequest that the remand would enable the Sangh to show\nwhether the losses brought to the notice of the Tribunal by\nthe Board were, in fact, net losses has also no force, be-\ncause, when the losses were proved before the Tribunal by\nproduction of an affidavit on behalf of the Board and the\ndeponent appeared in the witness-box, no attempt was made on\nbehalf of the Sangh to cross-examine the deponent in order\nto establish that the losses had not been correctly\nrepresented. We do not think that, in these circumstances,\nany remand of this case is called for. It does appear that\nthe Tribunal in its award committed the error of comparing\nthe Board with the Maharashtra Electricity Board and similar\nElectricity Boards in other States and thus acted against\nthe principle that wages should be compared on industry-cum-\nregion basis; but that mistake does not justify any\ninterference with the award which is otherwise correct and\njustified. The Tribunal was quite right in rejecting the\ndemands made by the Sangh, particularly in the light of the\nfurther fact relied upon by the Tribunal that all the\nemployees of\nthe Board in the Gujarat Region as well as large majority of\nover 2500 employees even in the Saurashtra Region had\naccepted the existing rates based on the settlement and only\n466 employees had come forward with this demand without\nestablishing that the demand wag restricted to bringing up\ntheir wages to the level of minimum wages.\n\nThe appeal is dismissed, but we make no order as to costs.\nR.K.P.S. Appeal dismissed.",

AT THE HEARING OF THE REFERENCE IT WAS CONTENDED BY THE REMAINING EMPLOYEES THROUGH THE SEVENTH UNION THAT THE TOTAL WAGE PACKET INCLUDING THE DEARNESS ALLOWANCE CLAIMED BY THEM WOULD ONLY SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT OF A MINIMUM WAGE AND THE BOARD'S CAPACITY TO PAY THE INCREASES DEMANDED WAS, THEREFORE, IRRELEVANT; FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE BOARD WAS AN INDUSTRY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, IT MUST ALSO BE MADE TO PAY WAGES ON THE SAME BASIS AS PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS; TWO ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANIES IN \",THE AREA WERE PAVING WAGES WHICH WERE MUCH HIGHER AND THERE WAS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR REFUSING THE DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL DEARNESS ALLOWANCE WHICH WOULD PLACE THE EMPLOYEES OF THE BOARD ON PAR WITH THE ,EMPLOYEES OF THOSE COMPANIES. THE TRIBUNAL IN ITS AWARD REJECTED ALL THE WORKMEN'S DEMANDS. IT FOUND THAT THE DEMAND FOR INCREASED DEARNESS ALLOWANCE WAS NOT CONFINED TO ACHIEVING A MINIMUM WAGE BUT AS A RESULT OF ITS ACCEPTANCE THE WAGES WOULD BE ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE. THE TRIBUNAL ALSO FOUND THAT THE BOARD HAVING INHERITED AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF OVER RS. 2 CRORES FROM ITS PREDECESSOR, THE BOMBAY STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD, HAVING SUSTAINED HEAVY LOSSES IN ITS WORKING AND HAVING UNDERTAKEN A FURTHER LIABILITY TO PAY INCREASED DEARNESS ALLOWANCE, IT HAD NO CAPACITY TO UNDERTAKE THE FURTHER BURDEN OF PAYING ABOUT RS. 49 LAKHS PER YEAR AS INCREASED DEARNESS ALLOWANCE OR TO MEET THE OTHER DEMANDS. THE TRIBUNAL HELD THAT THE POSITION IN THE OTHER TWO ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANIES WAS NOT COMPARABLE 'WITH THE BOARD. IN APPEAL TO THIS COURT AGAINST THE AWARD IT WAS CONTENDED INTER ALIA, THAT THE TRIBUNAL WAS WRONG IN JUDGING THE CAPACITY OF THE BOARD AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DEFICIT OF RS. 2 CRORES WHICH IT HAD INHERITED FROM ITS PREDECESSOR; AND THAT THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY OF THE BOARD SHOULD 174 HAVE BEEN JUDGED ONLY ON THE BASIS OF ITS COMMERCIAL UNDERTAKING EXCLUDING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE BOARD WHICH WERE IN THE NATURE OF NATIONAL DUTIES. HELD : THE TRIBUNAL HAD RIGHTLY REJECTED THE DEMANDS OF THE APPELLANTS. (I) AS THE APPELLANTS HAD FAILED TO SHOW THAT THEY WOULD"
