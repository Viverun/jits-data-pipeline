The petitioner renews his prayer for bail which was\n last rejected on August 30, 2024. The last rejection was\n primarily on the basis of an order dated March 30, 2023\n passed on a bail application of a co-accused person being\n CRM (NDPS) 594 of 2023, whereby two years' time was\n granted for conclusion of the trial. That time period is to\n expire on May 17, 2025. On instruction, learned State\n counsel tells us that the trial will definitely be concluded by\n that date.\n\n 2.

Opposing the prayer for bail, learned State advocate\n tells us that the prosecution has examined four witnesses till\n date. It proposes to examine eight more witnesses. The trial\n would definitely conclude within May 17, 2025.\n\n 4. We have considered the rival contentions of the\n parties. The petitioner is in custody for more than four years.\n Given the pace at which the trial has been proceeding, it is\n highly improbable that the trial would conclude by May 17,\n 2025. The petitioner is in custody for over four years.\n\n 5. Therefore, without touching the merits of the case\n and solely on the touchstone of \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution\n of India, we feel constrained to enlarge the petitioner on bail.\n\n 6. Accordingly, we direct that the petitioner, namely,\n Partha Saha, shall be released on bail upon furnishing a\n bond of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand), with\n two sureties of Rs.12,500/- each, one of whom must be local,\n to the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge, 6th\n Court, Barasat, Special Court under \nNDPS Act\n. The\n petitioner shall appear before the learned trial Court on every\n date of hearing and shall not intimidate the witnesses and/or\n tamper with evidence in any manner whatsoever and/or\n commit any cognizable offence in any manner whatsoever.\n The petitioner shall remain within the jurisdiction of\n Nabadweep Police Station except for the purpose of attending\n the court proceedings and shall report to the Officer-in-\n Charge/Inspector-in-Charge of Nabadweep Police Station\n once in a fortnight, until further orders.\n\n 7.
