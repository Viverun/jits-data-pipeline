The proceedings of the Arbitral Tribunal or the award\nmade by such Tribunal will, however, not be invalid merely for the\nreason that one or more arbitrator had, in the course of his service,\nopportunity to deal with the matters to which the contract relates or\nwho in the course of his/their duties expressed views on all or any of\nthe matters under dispute.\n\n64 (3) (b) (i) - The arbitral award shall state item wise, the sum and\nreasons upon which it is based.

Disputes have arisen between the parties on account of the alleged\nhindrances faced by the petitioner during the execution of work such as\ndelayed execution of LHS Bridges by other agencies, delayed Ganga Bridge\nwork by other agencies, delayed relocation of cable junction boxes, non-\nremovable of other existing hindering structures, non-availability of\nblanketing material, additional tax burden owing to implementation of GST\nand eventually arbitrary and malafide termination of the contract by the\nrespondent on 31.12.2018.\n\n5. The petitioner invoked the Dispute Resolution Clause vide\ncommunication dated 30.09.2022. In the said communication, while setting\nout the grievances of the petitioner and the claims sought to be raised by the\npetitioner upon the respondent, it was inter-alia sought as under:\n\n\"Also, as per modified clause 64 of GCC-2014, the Company is\nsubmitting herewith duly signed Annexure-XV of modified clause 64 of\nGCC-2014. The Company further request Railways to refer the\ndispute to the independent arbitrator, who shall be appointed with the\nmutual consent of both the parties.\"\n\n6. In response, the respondent addressed a communication dated\n15.03.2023 to the petitioner, inter-alia, stating:\n\n\"Reference above, the General Manager, Northern Railways, Baroda\nHouse, New Delhi has nominated a panel of following four Retired\nGazetted officers to suggest at least two names out of panel by you so\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 6 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nthat G.M. will nominate one out of them to act as\nArbitrator/Contractor's nominee. In above referred Arbitration case:\n\n1. Shri Arunendera Kumar, Retd. CRB/Railway Board\n\n2. Shri Alok Ranjan, AM/CE, Railway Board\n\n3. Ms. Saroj Rajware, Retd. AM/Budger, Railway Board\n\n4. Shri Anirudh Jain, Retd. AM/Works, Railway Board\n\nIt is therefore requested to suggest at least two names out of the above\npanel within 15 days positively, so that further action can be taken\ninto the matter accordingly.\"\n\n7. The petitioner vide communication dated 29.03.2023 stated that the\naforesaid suggestion of the respondent, and the appointment procedure\nsought to be followed was not in accordance with the judgments of Supreme\nCourt in\nTRF Limited v. Energo Engineering Projects Ltd.\n(\n2017) 8 SCC\n377, Bharat Broadband Network Limited v. United Telecoms Limited\nSCC OnLine SC 547 and Delhi High Court judgment in\nGangotri\nEnterprises vs. General Manager, Northern Railway\n(2022) DHC 004520.\nThe petitioner accordingly suggested the names of three persons, one of\nwhom could act as the petitioner's nominee. The petitioner also requested\nthat one of the persons named by the respondent in its communication dated\n15.03.2023 not be appointed as a co-arbitrator or a presiding arbitrator since\nthe said person was already acting as the presiding arbitrator/co-arbitrator in\nthree other railway arbitrations. Finally, it was stated in the communication\ndated 29.03.2023 that \"in case this is not acceptable to you, we will be\nconstrained to take legal action as per\nsection 11\nof Indian Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\".\n\n8. Instead of paying heed to and responding to the petitioner's\ncommunication dated 29.03.2023, the respondent addressed another\ncommunication dated 10.04.2023, reproducing the contents of its earlier\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 7 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\ncommunication dated 15.03.2023 verbatim. In response, the petitioner\naddressed a communication dated 11.05.2023, suggesting the names of its\nnominee arbitrators as per the appointment procedure insisted upon by the\nrespondent.\n\n9. Subsequently, the arbitral tribunal came to be constituted, and the\nsame was intimated to the petitioner vide communicated dated 24.05.2023,\nwhich inter-alia records as under:\n\n\"The General Manager, Northern Railway, Baroda House, New Delhi\nappointed the Arbitral Tribunal consisting of following members, to\nsettle the disputes arising out of the subject contract.\"\n\n10. It is also notable that while constituting the arbitral tribunal, the\nrespondent did not refer all of the claims sought to be raised by the\npetitioner to arbitration; some of the claims were excluded from the purview\nof arbitration. This was ostensibly on the basis that the said claims fell\nwithin the \"scope of excepted matters\".\n\n11. In the circumstances, the present petition has been filed by the\npetitioner seeking constitution of an independent arbitral tribunal. Although\nthe prayer in the present petition, as initially framed, raises a grievance as\nregards exclusion of certain claims from the purview of arbitration and seeks\nreference of the said claims to the arbitral tribunal as already constituted,\nduring the course of arguments learned counsel for the petitioner has\nstrenuously contended that the procedure envisaged under Clause 63 and\nClause 64 of GCC is not a valid appointment procedure, and therefore an\nindependent arbitral tribunal is required to be constituted to adjudicate the\ndisputes between the parties.\n\n12. Vide order dated 25.08.2023, this Court recorded the contention of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 8 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner as under:\n\n\"Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the arbitration\nagreement, as incorporated in Clause 64 of the Indian Railway\nGeneral Conditions of Contract, 1999, enables the respondent to\nappoint a panel of three Gazetted railway Officers as members of the\nArbitral Tribunal. He submits that the same is not in consonance with\nlaw and is inoperable in view of the judgment of this Court in\nMargo\nNetworks Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Railtel Corporation of India Ltd.\n(2023 SCC\nOnLine Del 3906).\n\nIt is further submitted that the petitioner raised serious objection/s to\nthe constitution of the arbitral tribunal, as constituted vide\ncommunication dated 24.05.2023. It is submitted that an independent\narbitral tribunal is required to be constituted to adjudicate the dispute\nbetween the parties in view of the settled legal position in a catena of\ncases.\n\nIn the circumstances, the petitioner does not press Prayer A in the\npresent petition; and seeks that an independent arbitral tribunal be\nconstituted to adjudicate all the claims of the petitioner.\"\n\n13. Subsequently, an affidavit dated 29.04.2024 has also come to be filed\non behalf of the petitioner in these proceedings wherein it has been, inter-\nalia, stated as under:\n\n\"4. That I say, by way of the instant petition I pray to this Hon'ble court for\nappointment of the independent arbitral tribunal for adjudication of the\ndisputes as detailed out in the instant petition rather than referring the claims\nto the existing arbitral tribunal which is constituted against principles of law.\n\n5. That I say, my Ld. Counsel upon my instruction has maintained the same\nstand before the Hon'ble Court which finds mentioned in the order dated\n25.08.2023 as passed by this Hon'ble Court in the instant petition. Copy of\nthe order dated 25.08.2023 as passed by this Hon'ble Court in the instant\npetition is being annexed herewith and marked as Document-2.\"\n\n14. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that Clause-63 and Clause-\n64 of the GCC have been the subject matter of examination in numerous\njudicial pronouncements. It has been held that the procedure contemplated\ntherein for constituting a tribunal does not meet the requirements of law.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 9 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nConsequently, while dealing with the petition under\nSection 11\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, this Court and also several other\nHigh Courts have appointed independent Arbitral Tribunals in identical\ncontext.\n\n15.\nIn this regard, reliance has been placed on the judgments in the case\nof\nMargo Networks Pvt. Ltd. &Anr. v. Railtel Corporation of India Ltd.\n,\n2023:DHC:4596 and Gangotri Enterprises Ltd. v. General Manager\nNorthern Railway (Supra).\n\n16. On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondent has contended\nthat the arbitral tribunal having already been constituted, there is no\noccasion for this Court to substitute/appoint another tribunal to adjudicate\nthe disputes between the parties. Further, it is contended that the respondent\nhas not referred certain claims to arbitration since the same fall in the\ncategory of 'excepted matters'. Learned counsel for the respondent has\nrelied upon the cases of M/s\nEmaar India Ltd. v. Tarun Aggarwal Projects\nLLP &Anr.\nSCC OnLine SC 1328, Mitra Guha Builders (India)\nCompany v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited\n(\n2020) 3 SCC 222\nand General Manager, Northern Railway & Anr. v. Sarvesh Chopra\n\n(2002) 4 SCC 45, to justify the same.\n\nREASONS AND CONCLUSION:\n\n17. At the outset, it is noted that this Court has had occasion to examine\nthe validity of the procedure for appointment/constitution of an arbitral\ntribunal in the backdrop of contractual stipulations identical to those in the\npresent case.\n\n18.\nIn the case of\nMargo Networks Pvt. Ltd.\n(Supra), it has been held\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 10 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nthat:\n\n(i) In the context of appointment procedure contemplating\nappointment out of panel of arbitrators maintained by one of the\ncontracting parties, it is mandatory that the panel should be sufficiently\nbroad-based, failing which the appointment procedure does not meet\nwith the requirements of law, and in such a situation an independent\narbitral tribunal is required to be appointed by this Court.\nReferring to\nVoestalpine Schienen Gmbh vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation\nLtd\n, (2017) 4 SCC 665, held that an arbitrator panel must be broad-\n\nbased and not restrictive. This requirement was not fulfilled when the\npanel was comprised solely of ex-employees of a party.\n\n(ii) A valid appointment procedure must be balanced and not\nconfer excessive say or authority on one of the parties to the arbitration\nregarding the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. An appointment\nprocedure that contemplates that one party appoints two out of three\nmembers of the arbitral tribunal contravenes this requirement.\n\n19. In the present case, the procedure contemplated under Clauses 63 and\n64 for appointing/constituting an arbitral tribunal is also vulnerable on both\nthe above counts.\n\n20. The relevant observations made by this Court in\nMargo Networks\nPvt. Ltd.\n(Supra) are as follows:\n\n\"35. Thus, in an appointment procedure involving appointment from a\npanel made by one of the contracting parties, it is mandatory for the\npanel to be sufficiently broad based, in conformity with the principle\n\nlaid down in\n\nVoestalpine\n(supra), failing which, it would be incumbent\non the Court, while exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11\n, to\nconstitute an independent and impartial Arbitral Tribunal as\nmandated in\nTRF\n(supra) and Perkins (supra). The judgement of the\nSupreme Court in CORE does not alter the position in this regard.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 11 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\n36.\nIn the facts of the present case, applying the principles laid down\nin\nVoestalpine\n(supra) and in view of the aforesaid judgments of this\nCourt, including in\nL&T Hydrocarbon Engineering Limited\n(supra), it\nis evident that the panel offered by the respondent to the petitioner in\nthe present case is restrictive and not broadbased. The same\nadversely impinges upon the validity of the appointment procedure\ncontained in clause 3.37 (supra), and necessitates that an\nindependent Arbitral Tribunal be constituted by this Court.\n\n37. This brings us to the next issue that arises in the context of the\narbitration clause in the present case, viz. whether \"counter\nbalancing\" is achieved in a situation where one of the parties has a\nright to choose an arbitrator from a panel whereas 2/3rd of the\nmembers of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the other party.\n\n***\n\n42. .... The \"counter balancing\" as contemplated in Perkins (supra)\ncannot be said to have been achieved in a situation where one of the\nparties has a right to choose an arbitrator from a panel and where\nthe remaining (2 out of 3) arbitrators are appointed by the other\nparty.\"\n\n21. The observations made in\nMargo Networks Pvt. Ltd.\n(Supra) have\nbeen referred with approval by this Court in\nTaleda Square Private Limited\nv. Rail Land Development Authority\n2023 SCC OnLine Del 6321, Kalyan\nToll Infrastructure Ltd v. Union of India and Others 2024 SCC OnLine\nDel 1525 and Techno Compact Builders through Mr. Zulfiquar Ali, Sole\nProprietor v. RAILTEL Corporation of India Limited, 2024 SCC OnLine\nDel 2166.\n\n22. Consequently, in terms of the said judgment in\nMargo Networks Pvt.\nLtd.\n(Supra) and other judgments of the Coordinate Bench of this Court, it is\nincumbent on this Court to appoint an independent arbitral tribunal to\nadjudicate the disputes between the parties.\n\n23. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also drawn attention to the fact\nthat in identical context, this Court, having found that the appointment\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 12 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nprocedure did not meet the requirements of law, appointed a Sole Arbitrator\nto adjudicate the disputes between the parties.\nIn this regard, reference may\nbe made to\nS.N. Naik & Brothers v. Union of India\n2024 SCC OnLine\nBom 995, wherein, it has been observed as under :-\n\n\"18. Thus, in the case of CORE (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\napplied the above clause 64(3)(b)(ii) and held that the High Court could\nhave not appointed independent sole arbitrator.\nHowever, in the case of\nCORE (supra)as discussed hereinafter, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was\nnot called upon to decide whether clause 64(3)(b)(ii) is in confirmity of\nprinciples laid down in\nTRF\n(supra) i.e. whether the arbitral panel is\nbroad based and in Perkins (supra), more particularly, whether the\ncounter balance is achieved in appointing the arbitral panel.\n\nThe\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CORE (supra) has not whittled\ndown the principles laid down in\nTRF and Perkins\n(supra).\nThe issues\nanswered in the judgment of CORE (supra) are, whether the retired\nrailway officers are eligible to be appointed as arbitrators and whether\nthe General Manager is eligible to nominate the arbitrators.\n\n19 In Tantia Constructions (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\ndoubted the view taken in the case of CORE (supra) observing that once\nthe appointing authority itself is incapcity from referring the matter to\narbitrator it does not follow that notwithstanding this yet appointments\nmay be valid depending upon the facts of the case. However, CORE\n(supra), has not dealt with the issue of counter balance achieved in terms\nof Perkins (supra). As such, the law laid down in the judgment of CORE\n(supra) is limited to the issues answered in CORE (supra). The same is\nthe view taken by the Delhi High Court in the below discussed judgments.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n23. I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Delhi\nHigh Court in the case of\nGangotri\n(supra) and\nGanesh Engineering\n\n(supra) that the judgment of CORE (supra) of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt does not deal with the issue, whether the arbitral panel appointed\nis broad based in confirmity with voelstapine (supra) and whether the\ncounter balancing is achieved as laid down in Perkins (supra). Coming\nto the facts of the present case, 2/3 arbitral panel is appointed by the\nrespondent so also for the 3rd member of the arbitral tribunal 4 names\nare suggested by the respondent from which the petitioner is required to\nchoose 2 names and from the 2 names chosen by the petitioner, the\nrespondent will appoint one. Thus, the respondent has a complete say in\nthe appointment of the tribunal.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 13 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\n24. Having considered the law on the subject the question as raised at\npara 8(1) can be answered as under:-\n\nClause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract provides\nfor unilateral appointment of arbitral tribunal at the hands of one of the\nparties and, thus, is in violation of the principles laid down in\n\nVoestalpine\n(supra),\nTRF\n(supra) and Perkins (supra) and also in\nviolation of the law laid down in the case of Lombard (supra) and the\nsaid clause is ex-faice invalid and the tribunal constituted thereunder is\nnon-est and void ab initio.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n29. In view of this, in exercise of the powers under\nsection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act, I appoints Hon'ble Shri Naresh H. Patil (Retired Chief\nJustice, Bombay High Court) as sole arbitrator in the matter to decide\nthe disputes arising between the parties in terms of agreement dated\n23.09.2019. The sole arbitrator's fees shall be governed by the Bombay\nHigh Court (Fee Payable to Arbitrators) Rules, 2018.\"\n\n24. Also, a Coordinate Bench of this Court in M/S Twenty-Four Secure\nServices Pvt. Ltd. v. M/S Competent Automobiles Company Limited\n2024/DHC/4601, observed as under -\n\n\"22.\nIn\nUnion of India (UOI) vs. Singh Builders Syndicate\n(2009) 4 SCC\n523, the High Court rejected the contention on behalf of the Government\nthat the Court was not vested with any powers to appoint a Sole\nArbitrator in distinction to the Arbitration Agreement which provided for\nthe Tribunal of three members. The Apex Court upheld the order of this\nCourt appointing a Sole Arbitrator by observing that the appointment of\nthe Sole Arbitrator was valid.\n\n23. In view of the submissions made as well as Clause 7 of the Services\nAgreement dated 16.08.2021 which provides for arbitration and the\npetitioner has raised the arbitrable disputes and without prejudice to the\nrights and contentions of the parties, the present petition is allowed.... \"\n\n25. There is also no merit in the contention that the present petition is not\nmaintainable because an arbitral tribunal already stands constituted in terms\nof the contractual provisions. It has been consistently held in a series of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 14 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\njudgments that where the appointment procedure is invalid, any proceedings\nbefore an improperly constituted arbitral tribunal are non-est, and the same\nwould not preclude this Court from exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11\n\nof the A&C Act, 1996.\n\n26.\nIn\nJ. S. R. Constructions v. National Highways Authority of India\nand Anr.\n, 2023: DHC: 8641, this Court has observed as under -\n\n\"19. In answer to question (ii), this Court finds that the present petition\nis maintainable. There is no merit in the argument of the respondents that\nsince an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted to adjudicate the disputes\nbetween the parties, the present petition is not maintainable. In Perkins\n(supra), the Supreme Court in exercise of the powers under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the A&C Act, appointed a Sole Arbitrator, even when appointment of\nan Arbitrator was already made; the Supreme Court, inter-alia, held as\nunder:\n\n\"26. The further question that arises is whether the power can be\nexercised by this Court under\nSection 11\nof the Act when the\nappointment of an arbitrator has already been made by the\nrespondent and whether the appellant should be left to raise\nchallenge at an appropriate stage in terms of remedies available\nin law. Similar controversy was gone into by a Designated Judge\nof this Court in Walter Bau AG and the discussion on the point\nwas as under : (SCC pp. 805-06, paras 9-10)\n\"9. While it is correct that in Antrix and Pricol Ltd., it was\nopined by this Court that after appointment of an arbitrator\nis made, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not under\n\nSection 11(6)\nbut such remedy lies elsewhere and under\ndifferent provisions of the\nArbitration Act\n(\nSections 12\nand\n\n13), the context in which the aforesaid view was expressed\ncannot be lost sight of. In Antrix, appointment of the\narbitrator, as per the ICC Rules, was as per the alternative\nprocedure agreed upon, whereas in Pricol Ltd., the party\nwhich had filed the application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act had already submitted to the jurisdiction of\nthe arbitrator. In the present case, the situation is\notherwise.\n\n10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid\nand such appointment satisfies the Court exercising\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 15 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nacceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar\nthe jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be\ncountenanced in law. In the present case, the agreed upon\nprocedure between the parties contemplated the\nappointment of the arbitrator by the second party within 30\ndays of receipt of a notice from the first party. While the\ndecision in Datar Switchgears Ltd. may have introduced\nsome flexibility in the timeframe agreed upon by the parties\nby extending it till a point of time anterior to the filing of the\napplication under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act, it\ncannot be lost sight of that in the present case the\nappointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is clearly contrary\nto the provisions of the Rules governing the appointment of\narbitrators by Icadr, which the parties had agreed to abide\nby in the matter of such appointment. The option given to\nthe respondent Corporation to go beyond the panel\nsubmitted by Icadr and to appoint any person of its choice\nwas clearly not in the contemplation of the parties. If that\nbe so, obviously, the appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane\nis non est in law. Such an appointment, therefore, will not\ninhibit the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act. It cannot, therefore, be\nheld that the present proceeding is not maintainable in law.\n\nThe appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane made beyond 30\ndays of the receipt of notice by the petitioner, though may\nappear to be in conformity with the law laid down in Datar\nSwitchgears Ltd., is clearly contrary to the agreed\nprocedure which required the appointment made by the\nrespondent Corporation to be from the panel submitted by\nIcadr. The said appointment, therefore, is clearly invalid in\nlaw.\"\n\n27. It may be noted here that the aforesaid view of the Designated\nJudge in Walter Bau AG was pressed into service on behalf of the\nappellant in TRF Ltd. and the opinion expressed by the Designated\nJudge was found to be in consonance with the binding authorities\nof this Court. It was observed : (\nTRF\ncase, SCC p. 397, paras 32-\n\n33)\n\n\"32. Mr Sundaram, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\nhas also drawn inspiration from the judgment passed by the\nDesignated Judge of this Court in Walter Bau AG, where the\nlearned Judge, after referring to Antrix Corpn. Ltd.,\ndistinguished the same and also distinguished the authority in\n\nPricol Ltd. v. Johnson Controls Enterprise Ltd.\nand came to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 16 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nhold that : (Walter Bau AG case, SCC p. 806, para 10)\n\n10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid\nand such appointment satisfies the Court exercising\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act,\nacceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar\nthe jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be\ncountenanced in law....‟\n\n33. We may immediately state that the opinion expressed in the\naforesaid case is in consonance with the binding authorities we\nhave referred to hereinbefore.\"\n\n28. In TRF Ltd., the Managing Director of the respondent had\nnominated a former Judge of this Court as sole arbitrator in\nterms of the aforesaid Clause 33(d), after which the appellant had\npreferred an application under\nSection 11(5)\nread with\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act. The plea was rejected by the High Court and the\nappeal therefrom on the issue whether the Managing Director\ncould nominate an arbitrator was decided in favour of the\nappellant as stated hereinabove. As regards the issue about fresh\nappointment, this Court remanded the matter to the High Court\nfor fresh consideration as is discernible from para 55 of the\njudgment. In the light of these authorities there is no hindrance in\nentertaining the instant application preferred by the applicants.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n30. In the aforesaid circumstances, in our view a case is made out\nto entertain the instant application preferred by the applicants.\nWe, therefore, accept the application, annul the effect of the letter\ndated 30-7- 2019 issued by the respondent and of the appointment\nof the arbitrator....\"\n\n20.\nIn\nBVSR-KVR v. Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd.\n, 2020 SCC OnLine Del 456\nthis Court has held as under:\n\n\"26. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, the foremost\nissue, which has arisen for consideration is whether, as submitted\nby Mr. Seth, this petition is not maintainable as there is already an\nArbitral Tribunal in place.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n33. Mr. Seth has also relied upon the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt in\nGrid Corpn. of Orissa Ltd.\n(supra) to contend that once\nArbitral Tribunal has come into existence a petition under Section\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 17 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\n11(6) of the Act was not an appropriate remedy and it was upon for\nthe party to raise objections as to the constitution and jurisdiction\nof the Arbitral Tribunal itself under the provisions of the Act.\n\n34. Similarly, he had also relied upon the judgment of this Court in\n\nNewton Engineering & Chemicals\n(supra) to contend that there\nwas no provision under the Act empowering the Court to terminate\nthe mandate of the Arbitrator appointed in terms of the agreement\nbetween the parties and the remedy to any challenge against the\nappointment of Arbitrator was under\nSection 13\nof the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act before the Arbitrator.\nI am not in agreement\nwith the submissions made by Mr. Seth by relying upon aforesaid\ntwo judgments for the simple reason that in Perkins Eastman\nArchitects DPC (supra), the Supreme Court while dealing with an\napplication under\nSection 11(6)\nread with\nSection 11(12)(a)\nof the\nAct of 1996 held that as per the scheme of\nSection 11\nof the Act, if\nthere are justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality\nof the persons nominated, and if other circumstances warrant\nappointment of an independent Arbitrator by ignoring the\nprocedure prescribed, such appointment can be made by the Court.\n\n35. If that be so, there is no impediment for this Court to appoint an\nindependent Arbitrator for adjudicating the dispute and difference\nbetween the parties....\"\n\n21. In view of the aforesaid, there is no impediment in entertaining the\npresent petition. This Court therefore annuls the effect of the letter dated\n12.07.2023 issued by the respondent no.1; and the letter dated\n19.07.2023 issued by the presiding arbitrator, whereby it was purported\nto be informed that the Arbitral Tribunal stood constituted.\"\n\n27. A Division Bench of this Court in\nKotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. v.\nNarendra Kumar Prajapat\n, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 3148, has also held that\nan arbitral tribunal, which inherently lacks jurisdiction, cannot validly\nconduct any arbitral proceedings. It was observed therein as under:\n\n\"4.\nIn\nTRF Ltd. v. Energo Engineering Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC\n377, the Supreme Court held that once the Arbitrator has become\nineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate another as an\narbitrator.\n\nIn\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC v. HSCC (India)\nLtd.\n, (2020) 20 SCC 760, the Supreme Court, following the earlier\ndecision in\nTRF Ltd.\n(supra), held that the Chairman-cum-Managing\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 18 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nDirector of a party was ineligible to appoint an arbitrator.\n\nFollowing\nthe aforesaid decisions, this court in\nProddatur Cable TV Digi\nServices v. Siti Cable Network Limited\n, (2020) 267 DLT 51 held that it\nis not permissible for a party to unilaterally appoint an arbitrator\nwithout the consent of the other party(ies). It is important to note that\nthe aforesaid decisions were rendered in the context of\nSection 12(5)\n\nof the A&C Act.\n\n***\n\n14. This Court finds no infirmity with the aforesaid view. A person\nwho is ineligible to act an Arbitrator, lacks the inherent jurisdiction to\nrender an Arbitral Award under the A&C Act. It is trite law that a\ndecision, by any authority, which lacks inherent jurisdiction to make\nsuch a decision, cannot be considered as valid. Thus, clearly, such an\nimpugned award cannot be enforced.\"\n\n28. There is also no merit in the respondent's contention that certain\nclaims are not liable to be referred to arbitration because they fall within the\nscope of excepted matters. Whether or not any particular claim is precluded\nfrom arbitration on account of being an excepted matter is an aspect that can\nbe gone into by a duly constituted arbitral tribunal. Reference in this regard\nis apposite to\nN.K. Sharma v. General Manager Northern Railway\nSCC OnLine Del 7576 wherein it was observed as under -\n\n\"This Court has also perused the invocation letter dated 01.06.2022\nand prima facie, none of the claims raised therein falls within\n'excepted matters'. However, this aspect would require an in depth\nexamination of the factual matrix which can be done by a duly\nconstituted Arbitral Tribunal, as contemplated in the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn.\n, (2021) 2\nSCC 1.\"\n\n29. Also, in Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n& the\nIndian Stamp Act, 1899\n, In re,\n2023 SCC OnLine SC 1666, the Supreme Court has reiterated that the scope\nof inquiry in a petition under\nSection 11\nof the A&C is limited to\nexamination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. It has been\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 19 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nobserved therein as follows:\n\n\"G. The doctrine of competence-competence\n\n...\n\n162. The legislature confined the scope of reference under\nSection\n11(6A)\nto the examination of the existence of an arbitration\nagreement. The use of the term \"examination\" in itself connotes that\nthe scope of the power is limited to a prima facie determination. Since\nthe Arbitration Act is a self-contained code, the requirement of\n\"existence\" of an arbitration agreement draws effect from\nSection 7\n\nof the Arbitration Act. In DuroFelguera (supra), this Court held that\nthe referral courts only need to consider one aspect to determine the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement - whether the underlying\ncontract contains an arbitration agreement which provides for\narbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the\nparties to the agreement. Therefore, the scope of examination under\n\nSection 11(6A)\nshould be confined to the existence of an arbitration\nagreement on the basis of\nSection 7\n. Similarly, the validity of an\narbitration agreement, in view of\nSection 7\n, should be restricted to the\nrequirement of formal validity such as the requirement that the\nagreement be in writing. This interpretation also gives true effect to\nthe doctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of\nsubstantive existence and validity of an arbitration agreement to be\ndecided by arbitral tribunal under\nSection 16\n.\nWe accordingly clarify\nthe position of law laid down in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) in the context of\n\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n163. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement\ngenerally lies on the party seeking to rely on such agreement. In\njurisdictions such as India, which accept the doctrine of competence-\ncompetence, only prima facie proof of the existence of an arbitration\nagreement must be adduced before the referral court. The referral\ncourt is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial by allowing\nthe parties to adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement. The determination of the\nexistence and validity of an arbitration agreement on the basis of\nevidence ought to be left to the arbitral tribunal. This position of law\ncan also be gauged from the plain language of the statute.\"\n\n30. In the recent case of SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Krish\nSpinning, 2024 INSC 532, the Supreme Court has clarified that at the stage\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 20 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nof appointing an arbitrator, the Court's role is limited to determining the\nprima facie existence of an arbitration agreement, and \"nothing else\". It was\nobserved therein as follows:\n\n\"113. Referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration\nand Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, it was observed in In Re:\n\nInterplay (supra) that the High Court and the Supreme Court at the stage\nof appointment of arbitrator shall examine the existence of a prima facie\narbitration agreement and not any other issues. The relevant observations\nare extracted hereinbelow:\n\n\"209. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or\nHigh Court at the stage of the appointment of an arbitrator\nshall \"examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration\nagreement and not other issues\". These other issues not only\npertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also\ninclude any other issues which are a consequence of\nunnecessary judicial interference in the arbitration\nproceedings. Accordingly, the \"other issues\" also include\nexamination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by the\nreferral court at the\nSection 8\nor\nSection 11\nstage. The process\nof examination, impounding, and dealing with an unstamped\ninstrument under the\nStamp Act\nis not a timebound process, and\ntherefore does not align with the stated goal of the\nArbitration\nAct\nto ensure expeditious and time-bound appointment of\narbitrators. [...]\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n114. In view of the observations made by this Court in In Re. Interplay, it\nis clear that the scope of enquiry at the stage of appointment of arbitrator\nis limited to the scrutiny of prima facie existence of the arbitration\nagreement, and nothing else. For this reason, we find it difficult to hold\nthat the observations made in Vidya Drolia and adopted in\nNTPC v. SPML\nInfra Ltd.\nthat the jurisdiction of the referral court when dealing with the\nissue of \"accord and satisfaction\" under\nSection 11\nextends to weeding\nout ex-facie non-arbitrable and frivolous disputes would continue to apply\ndespite the subsequent decision in In Re. Interplay.\"\n\n123. The power available to the referral courts has to be construed in the\nlight of the fact that no right to appeal is available against any order\npassed by the referral court under\nSection 11\nfor either appointing or\nrefusing to appoint an arbitrator. Thus, by delving into the domain of the\narbitral tribunal at the nascent stage of\nSection 11\n, the referral courts also\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 21 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\nrun the risk of leaving the claimant in a situation wherein it does not have\nany forum to approach for the adjudication of its claims, if it\nSection 11\n\napplication is rejected.\"\n\n31. Thus, it is not open for the respondent to resist arbitration based on\ntheir assertion that some of the claim/s fall within the scope of \"expected\nmatters\". However, the respondent would be well within its right to move an\nappropriate application under\nSection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996, raising appropriate objections in this regard.\n\n32. Consequently, in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and\nthe legal position as noted hereinabove, it is incumbent on this Court to\nappoint an independent arbitral tribunal to adjudicate the disputes between\nthe parties.\n\n33. Accordingly, Mr. Justice (Retd.) Dinesh Maheshwari, Former Judge,\nSupreme Court of India (Mobile No.:9485006617) is appointed as the Sole\nArbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the parties.\n\n34. It is clarified that the respondent shall be entitled to raise appropriate\njurisdictional objections/move application under\nSection 16\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, inter-alia, on the ground that the\nclaim/s sought to be raised fall within the scope of excepted matters.\nNeedless to say, in the event of any such application being filed, the same\nshall be dealt with and adjudicated upon by the learned Sole Arbitrator in\naccordance with law. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any\nopinion with regard thereto.\n\n35. The learned Sole Arbitrator may proceed with the arbitration\nproceedings subject to furnishing to the parties requisite disclosures as\nrequired under\nSection 12\nof the A&C Act.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 703/2023 Page 22 of 23\n\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\n\nSigning Date:13.10.2024\n\n16:15:55\n\n36. The learned Sole Arbitrator shall be entitled to fee in accordance with\nFourth Schedule to the A&C Act; or as may otherwise be agreed to between\nthe parties and the learned Sole Arbitrator.\n\n37. The parties shall share the arbitrator's fee and arbitral costs, equally.\n\n38. All rights and contentions of the parties in relation to the\nclaims/counter-claims are kept open, to be decided by the learned Arbitrator\non their merits, in accordance with law.\n\n39. Needless to say, nothing in this order shall be construed as an\nexpression of opinion of this Court on the merits of the case.\n\n40.
