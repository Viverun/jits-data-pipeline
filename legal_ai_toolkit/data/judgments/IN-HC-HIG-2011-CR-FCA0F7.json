This Criminal Revision Petition has been preferred under\n\nSections 397,401 read with 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nto\n\nseek the setting aside of the orders dated 10.05.1999 and 06.07.1999\n\npassed by the Ld. MM in FIR No.RC 4(S) / 93-SIU-(II)-CBI, whereby he\n\ndirected framing of charges against the petitioner and the co-accused\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 1 of 40\n\nShri Ashraf Jamal-the petitioner in connected Crl. R.P. No.399/2009, for\n\nsubstantive offences under\nsections 420\n,\nand\nIPC and also for\n\nconspiracy under\nsections 120B\nread with\nsections 420\n,\nand\nIPC; and further framed the charges too.\n\n2. Arguments had been heard and judgment reserved in this\n\npetition and Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 399/1999, initially on 21.05.2010.\n\nHowever, the judgment could not be pronounced within a reasonable\n\nperiod of time due to the heavy work load. Consequently , these cases\n\nwere listed again and the counsels were heard again.\n\n3. Case of the prosecution as disclosed in the charge sheet is\n\nthat Sh Anupam Rajan appeared in the Civil Services (Preliminary)\n\nExamination, 1993 held on 13th June 1993, even though he, on the\n\nbasis of the result of 1992 examination announced on 3.6.93, had been\n\nselected for appointment to the IAS, securing 52nd position in the merit\n\nlist, in order to help his friend and co-accused Shri Ashraf Jamal, who\n\nalso appeared in the said examination. According to the charge sheet,\n\non scrutiny of the examination documents, the UPSC found a clear\n\nnexus between Sh Anuam Rajan (Roll No.169758) and Sh. Ashraf Jamal\n\n(Roll No.169757) to the extent that both swapped their answer sheets\n\nand Shri Anupam Rajan wrote the examination for Shri Ashrat Jamal in\n\nsociology paper, who ultimately passed the examination, whereas Shri\n\nAnupam Rajan did not even qualify. UPSC also found obliteration in\n\nRoll No. in the answer sheets of both of them.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 2 of 40\n\n4. According to the prosecution, during investigation it was\n\nascertained that both Shri Anupam Rajan and Shri Ashraf Jamal belong\n\nto Daltonganj, Bihar and were friends of long standing. Both were\n\nstudying in JNU as Boarders during 1993. Both of them were aspirants\n\nfor Civil Services and appeared in C.S. examination conducted by the\n\nUPSC in 1992 as well as in 1993.\n\n5. According to the prosecution, Shri Anupam Rajan sent an\n\napplication form on 3.2.93 to UPSC duly filled in for appearing in CS\n\n(Preliminary) Examination, 1993 from Daltonganj, Bihar, offering Patna\n\nas the Centre for the examination. The application was received at\n\nUPSC on 8.2.93 and was allotted Roll No.041998. Thereafter, Shri\n\nAnupam Rajan, while living in Satluj Hostel, JNU, New Delhi, again filled\n\nup the application, for the same examination. Both offered Sociology\n\nas optional subject and Delhi as Examination Centre. On 22.2.93, both\n\nShri Rajan and Shri Jamal handed over their applications to their friend\n\nand co-boarder Shri Manoj Kumar, who was going to UPSC to deposit\n\napplications of many JNU boarders for CS(P) Exam, 1993. Shri Manoj\n\nKumar deposited in UPSC the applications of many boarders including\n\nthose of Shri Rajan and Shri Jamal. Shri Anupam Rajan and Shri Jamal\n\nwere allotted consecutive Roll Nos.169758 and 169757 respectively,\n\nand the same sub-centre, i.e. Govt. Girls Sr. Sec. School No.1, Sarojini\n\nNagar, New Delhi. On 13.6.93, both Shri Rajan and Shri Jamal\n\nappeared in the examination in Room No.13 of the said School,\n\noccupying adjacent seats as they had been allotted consecutive roll\n\nnumbers.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 3 of 40\n\n6. Shri Ashraf Jamal had also appeared in CS(P) Examination,\n\n1992 but could not qualify. His optional subject was Sociology with\n\ncompulsory subject as General Studies, although, Sociology was never\n\nhis subject during academic career.\n\n7. The Civil Services (P) Examination was slated on 13.6.1993 in\n\nsub-centre No.082 at Govt. Girls Senior Secondary School No.1, Sarojini\n\nNagar, New Delhi where 15 rooms were earmarked, including Room\n\nNo.13 for conducting the said examination. In Room No.13 of the\n\nCentre, the seating arrangement for 24 candidates was arranged in\n\nfour rows with 6 candidates in each row. The examination was to be\n\nheld in two sessions of the day, i.e. from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. being\n\nthe first session meant for option subjects, and from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30\n\np.m., being the second session meant for compulsory subject, i.e.\n\nGeneral Study. The candidates, namely, Anupam Rajan and Ashraf\n\nJamal were allotted seats in Room No.13 along with other candidates.\n\nMost of them hailed from the State of Bihar. Mrs. Neera Sharma,\n\nSection Officer, Min. of Agriculture and Mrs. T. Bannerjee, a school\n\nteacher were deputed as invigilator and co-invigilator respectively in\n\nRoom No.13. Shri P. Parmeshwaran was the Superintendent of the\n\nexamination in the said Centre.\n\n8. According to the prosecution, during CS(P) Examination, 1993,\n\nShri Anupam Rajan got question booklet of C-series whereas Shri\n\nAshraf Jamal got of B-series in optional subject (Sociology). After\n\ncompletion of the examination, the candidates were allowed to take\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 4 of 40\n\nthe question booklets with them. During searches from the premises\n\nof Ahraf Jamal, his question booklet has been recovered. The\n\nSociology answer sheet submitted under roll number of Anupam Rajan\n\nbears printed serial number 3789408 and the serial number of Ashraf\n\nJamal‟s answer sheet was 3789409.\n\n9. UPSC has confirmed that Anupam Rajan secured 79 marks in\n\nGeneral Studies out of 150 marks and 230 marks out of 300 marks in\n\nSociology (Optional subject) during CS(P) Examination of 1992,\n\nwhereas Ashraf Jamal had secured 27 marks in General Studies and\n\n147 marks in Sociology, i.e., Anupam Rajan was way ahead in 1992,\n\nbut in 1993, the scores have undergone a diametric change and\n\nAnupam Rajan got only 160 marks in total, against Ashraf Jamal‟s total\n\nof 271. This, according to the prosecution, suggests exchange of\n\nanswer sheets.\n\n10. As mentioned earlier, according to the prosecution, there\n\nwere four rows for the candidates taking the examination in Room\n\nNo.13 of Sub-centre No.082 and in each row there was sitting\n\narrangements for six candidates. In one of the rows, seats were\n\noccupied by Hema Rajora, R.N. Acharaya, Ashraf Jamal, Anupam Rajan,\n\nManoj Kumar and P.C. Mahapatra. In ordinary course, the answer\n\nsheets should have been distributed according to serial number.\n\nHowever, this is not found in the case of Shri Ashraf Jamal and Anupam\n\nRajan. The candidate Hema Rajora was absent in Sociology paper,\n\nwhereas R.N. Acharaya got answer sheet No.3789407, who was sitting\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 5 of 40\n\nahead of Ashraf Jamal. Ashraf Jamal should have got answer sheet\n\nNo.3789408 and Shri Rajan (who was seated behind Sh. Ashraf Jamal)\n\nshould have got answer sheet No.3789409, whereas Ashraf Jamal has\n\nreceived answer sheet No.3789409 and Anupam Rajan received\n\n3789408. According to the prosecution, this shows that serial nos. of\n\nthe answer sheets in respect of the two accused persons were\n\nexchanged.\n\n11. The questioned writings existing in the title entries of the\n\nanswer sheets of both Anupam Rajan and Ashraf Jamal, i.e. „Delhi‟,\n\n„Sociology‟, Roll No.169758 & 169757 alongwith the admitted writings\n\nwere sent to CFSL for comparison and opinion. The handwriting expert\n\nhas opined that the writings in the title entries on the answer sheet\n\nNo.3789409 (belonging to Shri Ashraf Jamal) have been written by Shri\n\nAnupam Rajan and the title entries on the answer sheet No.3789408\n\n(belonging to Shri Anupam Rajan) have been written by Shri Ashraf\n\nJamal, meaning thereby that Shri Anupam Rajan solved the question\n\npaper of Sociology for Shri Ashraf Jamal in the CS(P) Examination, 1993\n\nand Shri Ashraf Jamal solved the questions for Shri Anupam Rajan. As\n\na result, Ashraf Jamal could qualify for CS(Main) Examination, 1993\n\nwhereas Anupam Rajan did not. Expert has also confirmed overwriting\n\nin the roll nos. of these two persons on the concerned answer sheets\n\nand use of erasure in encoding the booklet series by invigilator of the\n\nanswer sheet of Shri Anupam Rajan.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 6 of 40\n\n12. According to the prosecution, the aforesaid facts and\n\ncircumstances disclose that both Anupam Rajan and Ashraf Jamal\n\nentered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat the authorities of Union\n\nPublic Service Commission and pursuant to it both cheated UPSC by\n\nforging the answer sheets of C.S. (P) Exam., 1993 and using the same\n\nas genuine and thereby they committed offences punishable under\n\nSections 120-B\nr/w 420, 468 & 471\nIPC\nand substantive offences under\n\nSections 420\n,\n&\nIPC.\n\n13. The Learned Magistrate heard the arguments of the\n\nprosecution and the defense on the point of charge, and vide the\n\nimpugned order dated 10.05.1999 directing the framing of charges\n\nagainst the petitioner and the co-accused Shri Ashraf Jamal, which he\n\neventually framed on 06.07.1999. The present revision petition\n\nimpugnes the aforesaid two orders and seeks the quashing of the\n\nsame.\n\nPetitioner's submission\n\n14. The petitioner Shri Anupam Rajan submits that he did not\n\nappear in 1993 to collude with the other candidate, namely Ashraf\n\nJamal and to help him in his paper. His only purpose was to improve his\n\nown rank in the IAS cadre. It is a common practice amongst the\n\ncandidates aspiring for Civil Services, to repeat the exam in order to\n\nimprove their position in the merit, which is only possible in the\n\nimmediate next year‟s examination, without any gap. Therefore no\n\ninference of a criminal conspiracy can be made out in his case.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 7 of 40\n\n15. Petitioner further submits that there exists no independent\n\nevidence or circumstance to come to the conclusion that: reasonable\n\ngrounds exist to believe the commission of the offences of which the\n\npetitioner is accused. Mere association of persons is not culpable\n\nenough for making out an offence as grave as criminal conspiracy.\n\n16. The petitioner submits that the Ld. Trial Court has relied\n\nheavily on the fact that the petitioner was allotted a Roll Number\n\nimmediately after that allotted to the co-accused Ashraf Jamal. It is\n\nclearly borne out from D-27 (I) and D-27 (II) that the application forms\n\nof the petitioner and the co-accused were not submitted in seriatim.\n\nRoll numbers are allocated to candidates by the UPSC and there is a\n\nprocedure, which ensures that there is no scope for securing any\n\npredetermined roll number to any candidate. Further, the seating plan\n\nfor the examination is only known once the candidates enter the\n\nexamination hall.\n\n17. Petitioner submits that the petitioner could not have entered\n\ninto any sort of a conspiracy on 22.2.1993, as the results of Civil\n\nServices (Main) Examination of 1992 were not even out by then.\n\nFurther, interviews were still pending and the sifting of the candidates\n\nat these two stages, results in only about 5-7% of the candidates who\n\nappear for the preliminary examinations reaching the final list of\n\nselected candidates. By reference to D-10, the press note dated\n\n02.06.1993 issued by PIB, he submits that the number of vacancies\n\nnotified for the Civil Services (Main) Examination, 1992 were subject to\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 8 of 40\n\nrevision. Therefore, even after securing the 52nd position, the\n\npetitioner Anupam Rajan could not be sure of ultimately being\n\nallocated a service of his choice in the Indian Administrative Service.\n\nAfter this, is stage of service allocation, which took place only on\n\n14.08.1993 (D-18), i.e. after the conduct of the 1993 preliminary\n\nexamination on 13.06.1993. It is argued that unsure of his own result\n\nand future career, how could the petitioner enter into a conspiracy for\n\nbenefiting someone else?\n\n18. Petitioner further submits that the prosecution has relied\n\nheavily on the fact that there has been a considerable improvement in\n\nthe performance of the co accused Ashraf Jamal in the Sociology paper\n\nin 1993 vis-à-vis his performance in the 1992 examination. It is\n\npointed out that while the performance of the co accused Ashraf Jamal\n\nin the Sociology paper improved by only 35% in 1993, there was an\n\nimprovement of 166% in the General studies paper. Both these paper\n\nneed to be cleared to clear the preliminary examination, and there is\n\nno suggestion from the prosecution that there was any kind of\n\nassistance rendered by the petitioner to the co accused in the General\n\nStudies paper. He further submits that in the scheme of subjects for\n\nthe UPSC preliminary examinations, literature subjects cannot be\n\nopted. Hence, it would be incorrect on the part of the prosecution to\n\nallege that the co-accused Ashraf Jamal, who was a student of Urdu\n\nLiterature, chose to appear in Sociology, because of a conspiracy\n\nbetween him and the petitioner. The co accused had, in fact, chosen\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 9 of 40\n\nsociology as his subject in the 1992 examination as well, and secured\n\n147 marks out of 300 in 1992.\n\n19. The petitioner also relies on statement of Shri Karan Singh\n\n(PW-11), Section Officer (confidential) UPSC dated 18.01.1994 to assail\n\nthe observations made in the impugned order as not being accurate. It\n\nis argued that the trial Court has proceeded on a wrong premise that\n\nAshraf Jamal had scored 271 out of 300 in the Sociology paper. The\n\nfact is, (as disclosed from Document D-6) that the score of 271 was the\n\naggregate of both the Sociology and General Studies papers out of\n\n450. According to the petitioner, this shows non-application of mind\n\nby the learned Metropolitan Magistrate.\n\n20. Mr. Mathur has also referred to the sitting plan (D-35) of Room\n\nNo.13, where the petitioner and Shri Ashraj Jamal were seated. He\n\nsubmits that the answer booklets were distributed randomly as stated\n\nby Ruchita Sahai in her statement recorded on 02.02.1994 and also\n\nseen from D-35. He submits that there is no basis to proceed on the\n\nassumption that the petitioner Anupam Rajan should have got answer\n\nsheet no.378409 and that Ashraf Jamal should have got answer sheet\n\nno.378408, as the answer sheets were not distributed in seriatim. He\n\nrefers to the answer sheet numbers of various other candidates sitting\n\nin the same room to show that they were not given in seriatim.\n\n21. Mr. Mathur further submits that it is not even the allegation of\n\nthe prosecution that the petitioner Anupam Rajan and Ashraf Jamal\n\nalso swapped their respective question papers. Both these candidates\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 10 of 40\n\nwere having different set of question papers. Shri Ashraf Jamal was\n\ngiven Series-B question paper, whereas Shri Anupam Rajan was given\n\nSeries-C question paper. Without the swapping of the question papers,\n\nand by merely swapping the answer sheets, the petitioner could not\n\nhave possibly solved the question paper given to Ashraf Jamal. He\n\nfurther submits that Ruchita Sahai on whose alleged complaint the\n\ncase was started, has not supported the case of the prosecution.\n\n22. Mr. Mathur submits that the entire case of the prosecution is\n\nfounded upon the opinion of the handwriting expert and the said\n\nopinion is of no avail without positive corroboration. Even if it is\n\nassumed that the answer sheets were indeed exchanged, that by itself,\n\ndoes not tantamount to forgery or cheating. There is no basis to\n\nconclude that the petitioner had answered the question paper of\n\nAshraf Jamal and vice versa. He submits that the swapping of the\n\nanswer sheets could have taken place only before 9.30 a.m and not\n\nthereafter.\n\n23. Mr. Mathur submits that the right of the petitioner to appear\n\nin the Preliminary Examination in 1993 is admitted by PW 19.\n\nPetitioner submits that the learned Trial Court also presumes that the\n\npetitioner was not serious in his attempt in the 1993 Civil Services\n\n(Preliminary) Examination, else he would have improved his result and\n\nsecured better marks as compared to the previous year. This\n\ncircumstance, according to the petitioner, cannot be construed to be\n\nindicative of culpability. It is common knowledge that several students\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 11 of 40\n\nwho try improving their position in the subsequent year fail to do so.\n\nThis can never be an incriminating circumstance.\n\n24. Petitioner submits that the order on charge is based upon\n\nbaseless conjectures, and the Ld. Trial Court is unjustified in forming\n\nthe opinion that the answer sheets may have been exchanged even\n\nafter the attendance sheets were filed. The uncertainty and vagueness\n\nof the charge itself is sufficient ground for quashing the same.\n\nReliance is placed on\nSarbans Singh & Ors. v. State of NCT of\n\nDelhi\n116 (2005) DLT 698;\nL.K.Advani v. Central Bureau of\n\nInvestigation\n1997 CRI.L.J 2559; and on Rukmini Narvekar v.\n\nVijaya Satardekar & Ors. IV (2008) CCR 426 (SC).\n\n25. The petitioner submits that the opinion of the Handwriting\n\nExpert in his report further requires positive corroboration, without\n\nwhich, it is of no avail. Ruchita Sahai, on whose alleged complaint the\n\ninvestigation was started, had stated in her statement dated\n\n02.02.1994 that she did not notice any act of swapping of answer\n\nsheets or question booklets, and therefore, she has not supported the\n\ncase of the prosecution. She also disowned the anonymous complaint\n\nagainst the petitioner. Reliance is placed on\nSmt. Bhagwan Kaur v.\n\nShri Maharaj Krishan Sharma and Ors.\n1973 SCC (cri) 687;\nState\n\nof Maharashtra v. Sukhdeo Singh and Anr.\nAIR 1992 SC 2100, and\n\nSukhvinder Singh and Ors v. State of Punjab (1994) 5 SCC 152.\n\n26. It is argued that the FIR in the present case was filed on the\n\nbasis of an anonymous letter received by the Chairman of UPSC stating\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 12 of 40\n\nthat the petitioner herein had appeared for the IAS Preliminary Exam,\n\n1993 just to help his friend, since the petitioner had already secured\n\n52nd rank in the 1992 IAS Mains Exam. Petitioner submits that there\n\nwas no mens rea on part of the petitioner to commit any forgery or\n\nconspiracy. Mens rea being an important ingredient to establish the\n\nculpability, which is absent in the present case, it can be said that no\n\nsuch alleged offence was committed. Deriving force from the decision\n\nJibrial Diwan v. State of Maharashtra\n1997 SC 3424, where the\n\nSupreme Court was of the opinion that where nobody was put in any\n\ndisadvantageous position or no wrongful gain was caused to anybody\n\nnor wrongful loss was caused by appellant's action the appellant\n\nshould be acquitted, Mr. D.C. Mathur submits that similarly in the\n\npresent case, no offence under\nSections 417\n,\nand\nof the IPC\n\ncan be made out and therefore, the petition be allowed.\nReliance is\n\nalso placed on Parminder Kaur v. State of U.P, JT 2009 (13) SC507.\n\n27. Mr. Mathur also refers to the decision in Dr. Vimla Vs. Delhi\n\nAdministration, AIR1963SC1572 wherein the court examined the\n\ningredients of the offence of fraud under\nsection 468\nof the IPC and\n\nhad held that deceit forms an important part of that offence. To justify\n\na charge for the offence under\nsection 468\nIPC, intention to defraud\n\nunder\nsection 25\nIPC needs to be present. He submits that in this case,\n\nthere is no evidence of any deceit on part of the petitioner, and so no\n\nculpability for the offence, as alleged, lies herein.\nSimilarly in\n\nDevander Kumar Singla v. Baldev Krishan Singla\n2005 (9) SCC\n\n15, the court while deciding a case of\nsection 420\nof the IPC concluded\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 13 of 40\n\nthat the alleged offence was not made out as there was no property\n\ndelivered. Therefore, there was no material to say that there was\n\ndeceit, and the accused was acquitted.\nMr. Mathur also places reliance\n\non Mohd. Ibrahim v. State of Bihar, (2009) 3 SCC (CRI) 929 to\n\nsubmit that there is no false document created and there is no forgery\n\neven if it is assumed that the petitioner and Ashraf Jamal had\n\nexchanged their answer sheets, as, according to the petitioner, the\n\npetitioner had solved the question booklet Series-C and Sh. Ahsraf\n\nJamal had solved the question booklet Series-B.\n\n28. Mr. Mathur submits that this Court should examine the pleas\n\nraised by the petitioner in light of the judgment of the Supreme Court\n\nin\nPaul George v. State\n, AIR 2002 SC 657, wherein the Supreme\n\nCourt has held that the order disposing of the criminal revision\n\npreferred by the appellant must indicate application of mind to the\n\ncase, and some reasons should be assigned for negating or accepting\n\nthe pleas. Mere ritual of repeating words or language used in the\n\nprovision, that there is no illegality, impropriety or jurisidictional error\n\nin the judgment under challenge, without even a whisper on the merits\n\nof the matter or nature of pleas raised does not meet the requirement\n\nof a decision being judicious.\n\n29. Concluding his submissions, Mr. Mathur submits that the High\n\nCourt (as a Revisonal Court) is not handicapped or powerless from\n\nexamining the material placed by the Respondent along with the\n\ncharge sheet. The alleged writings may give rise to some suspicion,\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 14 of 40\n\nbut definitely not \"strong suspicion\", so as to invite framing of the said\n\ncriminal charges. He urges that this court should use its inherent /\n\nsupervisory powers to quash the charges and discharge the petitioner,\n\nwho has suffered since 1993, i.e. for 6 years before the charges were\n\nframed, and thereafter again for over 10 years while this revision has\n\nremained pending.\n\nThe petitioner has submitted his written submissions and synopsis of\n\nwritten arguments on the aforesaid lines.\n\nRespondent's submissions\n\n30. Mr. Vikas Pahwa, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor\n\nsubmits that the fact that both the accused, namely Anupam Rajan\n\nand Ashraf Jamal belong to Daltonganj (Bihar) and are old friends; both\n\nwere studying at JNU as boarders in the same Sutlej Hostel during\n\n1993; both of them were also Civil Services aspirants and appeared for\n\nthe said examination in 1992 as well as 1993, establishes a nexus\n\nbetween the two people.\n\n31. He submits that in 1992 C.S. (P) Exam, Ashraf Jamal‟s\n\nperformance was very poor as he scored 147 marks in his Sociology\n\npaper. But in 1993, he secured 199 marks as against the petitioner\n\nwho had scored 239 marks in Sociology in the year 1992, but scored\n\n160 in the 1993 exam. As expected, Ashraf jamal qualified in the 1993\n\nexam, but the petitioner could not. This suggests that the answer\n\nsheets were exchanged between the two of them. He submits that, in\n\nthe charge that the petitioner exchanged the answer sheet and solved\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 15 of 40\n\nthe question paper for Ashraf Jamal, is implicit the charge that he also\n\nexchanged the question paper with Ashraf Jamal by taking the „B‟\n\nseries question paper from Ashraf Jamal and giving him his own „C‟\n\nseries question paper.\n\n32. It is also contended that the petitioner had previously\n\nappeared in the 1991 exam too where he had secured 565 rank. So he\n\nappeared again in 1992 to improve his rank, which he did do by\n\nsecuring 52nd rank in his 1992 exam. Therefore, there existed no\n\nreason for appearing again for improvement of rank, as alleged by the\n\npetitioner. For the 1992 examination, the vacancies advertised for the\n\ngeneral category were 61, and the petitioner having secured 52nd rank\n\nhad a very bright chance of getting the Indian Administrative Service.\n\nHe again appeared for the said exam in 1993, and the only inference\n\nthat can be drawn is that this was done to collude with his friend,\n\nAshraf Jamal to help him qualify the said exam in 1993. Else, he would\n\nhave taken the said examination seriously and would have attempted\n\nthe question papers fully, which he failed to do. He submits that the\n\npetitioner‟s contention that he sat in the 1993 exam to improve his\n\nrank, is not borne out by his performance, as compared to that of his\n\nfriend, Ashraf Jamal. He attempted only 73 questions out of 150 in his\n\nGeneral Studies paper, whereas Ashraf Jamal attempted 150 out of 150\n\nquestions. Hence, it will not be correct to say that the petitioner sat in\n\n1993 exam just to improve his rank. His conduct does not support his\n\nplea and rather belies the same.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 16 of 40\n\n33. It is further submitted that Anupam Rajan had applied for the\n\n1993 exam from Bihar on 29.01.1993. This form was received in the\n\nUPSC office on 08.02.1993 and he was allotted a roll number 041998.\n\nBut he again applied on 22.02.1993 with his friend Ashraf Jamal from\n\nDelhi and managed to get consecutive roll numbers in the same\n\ncenter.\n\n34. It is argued that though Anupam Rajan had done his Masters\n\nin Sociology and, therefore, his opting for Sociology in the IAS Exam\n\nmade sense, Ashraf Jamal had never studied Sociology, but still opted\n\nfor it in his attempts both in 1991 and 1992.\n\n35. Mr. Pahwa draws the attention of the court to the statement\n\nof the first invigilator, that is, PW 4, wherein she stated that she did not\n\ngo back to check whether candidates filled in the correct details in the\n\nanswer sheet. So, it is probable that the petitioner and his friend Ashraf\n\nJamal filled the details for each other so as to make the swapping of\n\nanswer sheets go unnoticed.\n\n36. Mr. Pahwa submits that a conspiracy is an inference drawn\n\nfrom the circumstances. There cannot always be much direct evidence\n\nabout it. The conspiracy can be inferred even from the circumstances\n\ngiving rise to a conclusive or irresistible inference of an agreement\n\nbetween two or more persons to commit an offence. Since conspiracy\n\nis often hatched in utmost secrecy, it is almost impossible to prove\n\nconspiracy by direct evidence. It has to be inferred from the acts,\n\nstatements and conduct of parties to the conspiracy. Thus if it is\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 17 of 40\n\nproved that the accused pursued, by their acts, the same object, by\n\nthe same means, one performing one part of the act and the other\n\nanother part of the same act so as to complete it with a view to\n\nattainment of the object which they were pursuing, the court is at\n\nliberty to draw the inference that they conspired together to achieve\n\nthat object. Conspiracy has to be treated as a continuing offence and\n\nwhosoever is a party to the conspiracy, during the period for which he\n\nis charged, is liable under this section. Motive and economic loss are\n\nnot a sine qua non for proving an offence of criminal conspiracy. If the\n\nevidence as to the actual commission of crime is believed, then no\n\nquestion of motive remains to be established.\n\n37. It is submitted that the petitioner and Ashraf Jamal have\n\ncheated UPSC by swapping the answer sheets of Sociology Exam,\n\nbetween 9.30 a.m to 11.30 a.m in Room No.13 which ultimately\n\nenabled Ashraf Jamal, to qualify CSE (Preliminary) and making him\n\neligible for Civil Services (Main) examination. Thus the act of swapping\n\nthe answer sheets deceived and induced UPSC to grant him higher\n\nmarks, which Ashraf Jamal would not have secured had there been no\n\nswapping of answer sheets.\n\n38. Cheating is deception of any person by fraudulently or\n\ndishonestly inducing that person to deliver any property to any person\n\nor to consent that any person shall retain any property. Cheating is\n\nintentionally inducing a person to do or omit to do anything which he\n\nwould not do or omit if he was not so deceived.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 18 of 40\n\n39. The petitioner and Ashraf Jamal have deceived the\n\nUPSC/Invigilator by misrepresenting that the answer sheets have been\n\nwritten/marked by them, as contemplated by the UPSC Civil services\n\n(P) Examination 1993, and have dishonestly and fraudulently induced\n\nthe UPSC to give Admission Certificate of passing the CSE (P) 1993 to\n\nMr. Ashraf Jamal, although the answer sheets were swapped and were\n\nforged, by writing exams for each other. The Property as\n\ncontemplated in\nsection 415\nand\nIPC is the Admission Certificate of\n\nPassing CSE Preliminary 1993 issued by UPSC.\n\n40. Deceiving means causing to believe what is false or\n\nmisleading as to a matter of fact, or leading into error. Whenever a\n\nperson fraudulently represents as an existing fact, that, which is not an\n\nexisting fact, he commits this offence. A willful misrepresentation of a\n\ndefinite fact with intent to defraud is cheating. Intention is the gist of\n\nthe offence. The intentions at the time of offence and the\n\nconsequences of the act or omission itself have to be considered. The\n\ndamage may be the direct, natural or probable consequences of the\n\ninduced act.\n\n41. The essential ingredients of the offence under\nSections\n/\n/\nof the IPC necessarily entail mens rea; the intention has\n\nto be gathered from the circumstances built up of the case; the offence\n\nof cheating consists of a dishonest inducement as contained in the\n\ndefinition of\nSection 415\nof the IPC; to constitute the offence of\n\ncheating it has to be established that the Accused deceived the\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 19 of 40\n\ncomplainant dishonestly inducing him to part with any property in his\n\nfavour which he would not have parted but for the deception played on\n\nhim.\n\n42. The petitioner and Ashraf Jamal while cheating the UPSC and\n\nthe Invigilator have committed the offence of Forgery, by swapping the\n\nAnswer sheets, and writing (Roll number, Delhi, Sociology) in the\n\nanswer sheets for each other and in also solving the question paper for\n\neach other, with an objective of helping Ashraf Jamal in CSE (P) 1993 in\n\nthe paper of Sociology and thus inducing the invigilator to believe that\n\nboth of them have solved their own respective answer sheets.\n\n43. Forgery is making of a false document or part of it. Such\n\nmaking should be with intent to support any claim or title or to cause\n\nany person to part with property, or to enter into any express or\n\nimplied contract or with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be\n\ncommitted. To constitute forgery, simple making of a false document\n\nis sufficient. The offence of forgery is complete if a false document is\n\nmade with intent to commit a fraud. Where there is an intention to\n\ndeceive and by means of the deceit to obtain an advantage there is\n\nfraud and if a document is fabricated with such intent, it is a forgery.\n\nAn actual intention to convert an illegal or doubtful claim into an\n\napparent legal one is dishonesty and will amount to forgery. The term\n\n\"claim\" is not limited in its application to a claim to property. It may\n\nbe a claim to anything. The damage or injury must be intended to be\n\ncaused by the false document to the public or any individual.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 20 of 40\n\n44. The petitioner has made a false document, by dishonest and\n\nfraudulent intention, to make the UPSC believe that the document\n\n(Answer Sheet) has been made by Ashraf Jamal although he knew that\n\nthe response in the Answer sheet has not been made by him.\n\n45. The opinion of the hand writing expert D-36, D-39 and D-43\n\nwere given on 29.3.1994, 21.12.1994, 23.12.1994 bearing No.94/D-\n\n146, wherein it was opined by the hand writing expert that the title\n\nentries in the answer sheets of Ashraf Jamal were written by Anupam\n\nRajan and vice versa. The Roll No‟s which were given to both the\n\npetitioners were consecutive i.e. 169757 and 169758. It was further\n\nopined by the hand writing expert that the last digit of the roll no‟s in\n\nboth the cases were initially erased and later on the same were\n\nrewritten. The answer sheets which were given to both the petitioners\n\nwere bearing no.3789408 and 3789409. Thus from the opinion of the\n\nhand writing expert it is crystal clear that both-the petitioner and\n\nAshraf Jamal indulged in cheating during the examination.\n\n46. The handwriting expert opinion sought by the CBI is not only\n\non the basis of the Specimen Handwriting, but also the admitted\n\nhandwriting of the accused persons. The trial court, however, in terms\n\nof\nsection 73\nEvidence Act can satisfy itself about the handwriting of\n\nthe accused either by telling the accused to write the words in the\n\ncourt, or to obtain a fresh opinion of the expert.\n\n47. He relies on\nNrisingha Murari Chakraborty and Ors. Vs.\n\nState of West Bengal\n(1977) 3 SCC 7, where the question was\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 21 of 40\n\nwhether passports were „property‟ within meaning of Section 420. The\n\nApex Court observed that passport being a tangible thing was a useful\n\ndocument and could be subject of ownership or exclusive possession\n\nand therefore it is „property‟ within meaning of\nSections 415\nand\nIPC.\n\n48. He relies on the definition of the word \"property\", as defined\n\nin the Century Dictionary- \"the right to the use or enjoyment or the\n\nbeneficial right of disposal of anything that can be the subject of\n\nownership; ownership; estate; especially, ownership of tangible\n\nthings...; anything that may be exclusively possessed and\n\nenjoyed;...possessions.\"\n\n49. He also relies on the decision in\nAbhayanand Mishra v.\n\nState of Bihar\n, 1961 CriLJ 822. The appellant there applied to the\n\nPatna University for permission to appear at the M. A. examination as a\n\nprivate candidate, representing that he was a graduate having\n\nobtained the B. A. degree in 1951 and had been teaching in a school.\n\nOn that basis, an admission card was despatched for him to the\n\nHeadmaster of the school. It was however found that he was neither a\n\ngraduate nor a teacher. He was prosecuted for the offence under\n\nSection 420 read with Section 511 of the Penal Code. He contended\n\nthat his conviction was unsustainable because the admission card had\n\nno pecuniary value and was not property. The Court repelled the\n\ncontention, and held that although the admission card as such had no\n\npecuniary value, it had immense value to the candidate appearing in\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 22 of 40\n\nthe examination for he could not have appeared at the examination\n\nwithout it, and that it was therefore property within the meaning of\n\nSection 415 of the Penal Code.\nWhile reaching that conclusion, the\n\nCourt relied on Queen Empress v. Appasami, ILR (1889) 12 Mad 151\n\nand Queen Empress v. Soshi Bhushan, ILR (1893) 15 All 210. In\n\nAppasami's case it was held that the ticket entitling the accused to\n\nenter the examination room was \"property\", and in Soshi Bhushan's\n\ncase it was held that the term \"property\" included a written certificate\n\nto the effect that the accused had attended a course of lectures and\n\nhad paid up his fees. On a parity of reasoning, the Court observed that\n\nit had no doubt that looking to the importance and characteristics of a\n\npassport, the High Court rightly held that it was property within the\n\nmeaning of Sections 415 and 420 of the Penal Code.\n\n50. Deriving force from the above authorities, Mr. Pahwa submits\n\nthat the admission card of the petitioner is \"property\", which he did\n\nutilize with an intention to defraud. According to the respondent,\n\nculpability under section 415 and 420 is established.\n\n51. Mr. Pawha lastly submits that at the initial stage of framing of\n\ncharges under\nsection 227\nand\nof CrPC, the truth, veracity, and\n\nthe necessary effect of the evidence, which the prosecution proposes\n\nto prove, is not required to be meticulously judged by the Ld. Trial\n\nCourt. The charges against the accused persons can be framed even\n\non the basis of strong suspicion found on the material collected by the\n\ninvestigating agency during the course of investigation. The trial court\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 23 of 40\n\ncan form a presumptive opinion regarding the existence of factual\n\ningredients constituting the offence alleged, and would be justified in\n\nframing the charges against the accused in respect of the offences\n\nalleged to have been committed by them. Reliance is placed on Soma\n\nChakravarty v. State Through CBI (2007) 5 SCC 403.\n\nRejoinder\n\n52. Petitioner, in its rejoinder submits that it has consistently\n\nbeen the case of the prosecution that the accused persons swapped\n\ntheir answer sheets and wrote for each other. It has never been their\n\ncase, as is borne out from the chargesheet, as well as the order on\n\ncharge, that the question booklets (which were of different series,\n\nthereby having questions in different sequential order), were swapped\n\nby them at any point, during the course of the examination. Exchange\n\nof answer sheets without the exchange of question booklets would\n\nserve no purpose, if such an act were intended to benefit the co-\n\naccused.\n\n53. Petitioner submits that as per attendance sheet for the said\n\nexamination, the co-accused Ashraf Jamal had with him, answer sheet\n\nbearing serial no. 3789409, and question booklet bearing serial no.\n\n013498, whereas the petitioner had answer sheet bearing serial no.\n\n3789408 and question booklet bearing serial no. 013499 at the time\n\nwhen attendance was recorded around 10:00 a.m. The chargesheet as\n\nwell as the order on charge, make no mention of the fact that the\n\nquestion booklets were ever exchanged. It goes on to show that it was\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 24 of 40\n\nnever the case of the prosecution that the question booklets were ever\n\nexchanged.\n\n54. Mr. D.C. Mathur, the Ld. Senior advocate for the petitioner\n\nrelies on L.K. Advani 1997 CrLJ 2559, wherein in para 102 the court\n\nhad observed \"there can only be one presumption and that is of the\n\ninnocence of the accused.\" A different presumption cannot be raised.\n\nThe charges have to be based on evidence which is legally convertible\n\nat the stage of trial. In the present case, there is no legally admissible\n\nmaterial on record to indicate exchange of answer sheets or question\n\npapers during the course of the examination.\n\n55. Reliance is also placed on the decision in\nDilawar Balu\n\nKurane v. State of Maharashtra\n(2002) 2 SCC 135, wherein it is\n\nheld that, \"....by and large, if two views are equally possible and the\n\nJudge is satisfied that the evidence produced before him gave rise to\n\nsome suspicion but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be\n\nfully justified to discharge the accused...\".\n\n56. In the present case, while a suspicion might arise because of\n\nthe alleged swapping of answer sheets, it is not grave enough to\n\nconjure up a conspiracy or allege forgery on behalf of the accused\n\npetitioner. He reiterates that merely because the answer sheets of the\n\npetitioner and the co accused were not in sequential order, it does not\n\nimply that the two accused persons had swapped their answer sheets\n\nand solved the question papers for each other. This presumption by\n\nthe Ld. MM is not only baseless, but even contrary to the record, as per\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 25 of 40\n\nthe statement of PW4 (Neera Sharma) who states that the distribution\n\nof answer sheet was on random basis. Even the seating plan of the\n\nroom in which the candidates were sitting, amply demonstrates the\n\nlack of sequence in the distribution of answer sheet.\n\nDiscussion & Decision\n\n57. The scope of these proceedings, wherein the petitioner assails\n\nthe order directing framing of charges against the petitioner, and the\n\ncharges as framed, and the approach to be adopted by the Court while\n\ndealing with a petition like the present, is settled by a catena of\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. I had occasion to deal with the same\n\nin\nSajjan Kumar v. C.B.I.\n, 171 (2010) DLT 120. Paragraphs 15 to 17\n\nof this decision may be referred to, which reads as follows:\n\n\"15. The scope of the enquiry that the Court is required to\nundertake at the stage of consideration of the aspect of\nframing of charge and the approach that the Court should\nadopt is well settled by a catena of decisions of the\nSupreme Court. At the stage of framing the charge, the\nCourt has to prima facie consider whether there is sufficient\nground for proceeding against the accused. The Court is\nnot required to appreciate the evidence for arriving at a\nconclusion that the materials produced are sufficient or not\nfor convicting the accused. If the Court is satisfied that a\nprima facie case is made out for proceeding further, then\nthe charge has to be framed. The charge can be quashed if\nthe evidence which the prosecutor proposes to adduce to\nprove the guilt of the accused, even if fully accepted before\nit is challenged by the cross examination or rebutted by\ndefence evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused\ncommitted a particular offence. In such a case, there\nwould be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial.\nAt the stage of framing of charge, the enquiry must\nnecessarily be limited to decide if the facts emerging from\nthe materials on record constitute the offence with which\nthe accused could be charged. The Court may peruse the\nrecord for that limited purpose, but it is not required to\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 26 of 40\n\nmartial it with a view to decide the reliability thereof. The\nCourt is required to evaluate the material and documents\non record with a view to find out the if the facts emerging\ntherefrom taken at their face value disclosed the existence\nof all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. For\nthis limited purpose, the Court may sift the evidence as it\ncannot be expected even at the initial stage to accept all\nthat the prosecution states as the gospel truth, even if it is\nopposed to common sense or the broad probabilities of the\ncase.\n\n16. Consequently, if on the basis of the material on\nrecord, the Court could form an opinion that the accused\nmight have committed the offence, it can frame the charge.\nThough for conviction, the conclusion is required to be\nproved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has\ncommitted the offence.\n\n17. At the time of framing of the charge, the probative\nvalue of the material on record cannot be gone into and the\nmaterial brought on record by the prosecution has to be\naccepted as true at that stage. Before framing the charge,\nthe Court must apply its judicial mind to the material placed\non record and must be satisfied that the commitment of\noffence by the accused was possible. Whether, in fact, the\naccused committed the offence, can only be decided at the\ntrial. (See\nState of Madhya Pradesh v. S.B. Johari\n,\n(2000) 2 SCC 57;\nState of Maharashtra v. Priya\nSharma Maharaj & Ors.\n, (1997) 4 SCC 393; and\nSoma\nChakravarty v. State\n, (2007) 5 SCC 403).\"\n\n58. It will not be advisable for me to go into the merits of the case\n\nof the prosecution or the defences that the petitioner has sought to\n\nurge in support of this petition, as it may prejudice the trial which is yet\n\nto take place. Suffice to say, that it can be said at this stage that the\n\nprosecution has a prima facie case, which discloses sufficient ground\n\nfor proceeding against the petitioner/accused.\n\n59. The past acquaintance between the petitioner and the co-\n\naccused, Shri Ashraf Jamal from their home town; the fact that they\n\nwere studying at JNU as boarders in the same hostel during 1993; the\n\nfact that Shri Ashraf Jamal performed poorly and scored 147 marks in\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 27 of 40\n\nhis Sociology paper in CS (P) Examination, 1992, and made an\n\nimprovement by scoring 199 marks in the year 1993, in contrast to the\n\npetitioner‟s own performance of scoring 239 marks in the year 1992,\n\nand only 160 marks in the year 1993 examination; the fact that at the\n\ntime of his making the application for CS (P) Examination, 1993, he\n\nwas aware of his having secured 52nd rank in the CS (Main)\n\nExamination, 1992 - when there were 61 advertised vacancies in the\n\ngeneral category for the year 1992; the fact that the petitioner not only\n\ndid not improve in his performance in the CS (P) Examination, 1993 but\n\nalso did not attempt the full general studies paper (only 73 questions\n\nout of 150 questions were attempted) in the CS (P) Examination 1993,\n\ncoupled with the fact that the handwriting expert opinion suggests that\n\nthe answer sheet provided to Ahsraf Jamal was written upon by the\n\npetitioner and vice versa, do raise grave suspicion and warrant the\n\nframing of charge against the petitioner and the co-accused Ashraf\n\nJamal.\n\n60. The various explanations/defences raised by the petitioner to\n\nexplain his conduct would be a matter to be considered by the trial\n\ncourt at the stage of trial. Even if the circumstance that the answer\n\nsheets were not distributed in seriatim is taken into account, that by\n\nitself cannot be said to shake the foundation of the case of the\n\nprosecution. It is only during the trial that it would be established\n\nwhether or not there was a conspiracy between the petitioner and Shri\n\nAshraf Jamal as alleged by the prosecution, and if so, at what stage\n\nthat the conspiracy was hatched, and given effect to. Pertinently, the\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 28 of 40\n\nprosecution has not fixed any point of time or place where the alleged\n\nconspiracy was allegedly hatched.\n\n61. I do not find merit in the submission of Mr. Mathur that the\n\nprosecution does not even allege that the petitioner and Shri Asraf\n\nJamal exchanged/swapped their question papers. The whole case of\n\nthe prosecution is that the petitioner has answered the question paper\n\nfor Shri Ashraf Jamal and vice versa. As the petitioner and Shri Ashraf\n\nJamal had different series of question papers (the petitioner had\n\nSeries-C and Shri Ashraf Jamal had Series-B), it would be obvious that if\n\nthere is truth in the said allegation, the same could not have been\n\nachieved without the exchange of the question papers between the\n\npetitioner and the co-accused Ashraf Jamal. I agree with the\n\nsubmission of Mr. Pahwa that the said accusation is implicit in the\n\nfundamental accusation that the petitioner has solved the question\n\npaper for Ashraf Jamal by exchanging the answer sheet, and the fact\n\nthat the same is not expressly articulated in the charge sheet makes\n\nno difference.\n\n62. The submission of Mr. Mathur that the opinion of the\n\nhandwriting expert, even if believed, merely establishes that the\n\npetitioner had filled up the details of Ashraf Jamal and vice-versa in the\n\nanswer sheets, which, by itself, does not lead to the conclusion that\n\neven the answers to the questions were marked by the two accused for\n\neach other, cannot be accepted at this stage because of the pattern of\n\nscoring of the two accused in the two papers of Sociology and General\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 29 of 40\n\nStudies, in comparison to the scoring pattern in the previous year and\n\nin light of the stand of the petitioner that he had appeared in the\n\nPreliminary Examination in 1993 with a view to improve his ranking\n\nfrom 52, which he scored in the overall assessment for the year 1992.\n\n63. The anonymous complaint attributed to Ruchita Sahai may\n\nhave the set the ball rolling to kick start the investigation, but it cannot\n\nbe said that the entire case of the prosecution is founded upon that\n\ncomplaint alone. Therefore, merely because Ruchita Sahai may have\n\ndisowned the anonymous complaint against the petitioner, does not\n\nappear to take away from the case of the prosecution in any manner.\n\nPertinently, according to the prosecution, the hand writing expert has,\n\non comparison, found the complaint to have been written by Ruchita\n\nSahai, though she has disowned the same.\n\n64. I find no merit in the submission of Mr. Mathur that no mens\n\nrea can be attributed to the petitioner at this stage. It would be highly\n\npremature to conclude as to whether or not the petitioner has\n\ncommitted the acts of forgery and conspiracy as alleged against him,\n\nand consequently, it cannot be said with certainty that the petitioner\n\ndid not have the mens rea to commit the offence of which he is\n\naccused. The submission that there is inaccuracy in the impugned\n\norder because the learned M.M. has proceeded on the basis that the\n\nmarks obtained by Ashraf Jamal in Sociology paper were 271, whereas\n\nthe same were only 199, also, in my view make no difference, as the\n\nfundamental premise remains the same. The charge does not get\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 30 of 40\n\ndiluted because the marks obtained by Ashraf Jamal in Sociology paper\n\nwere 199, and not 271.\n\n65. I now proceed to consider the various decisions relied upon by\n\nthe petitioner and Ashraf Jamal.\nSarbans Singh\n(supra) is merely an\n\ninstance of a case where this Court applied the Supreme Court decision\n\nin\nUnion of India V. Prafulla Kumar Samal\n, (1979) 3 SCC 4,\n\nwherein the Supreme Court had, inter alia, held that the Court has the\n\npower to sift and weigh the evidence- although for the limited purpose\n\nof finding out whether a prima facie case against the accused has been\n\nmade out.\n\nIn\nPrafulla\n(supra), it had also been held that where\n\nmaterials placed before the Court disclosed grave suspicion against\n\nthe accused which has not been properly explained, the Court would\n\nbe fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the trial. By\n\nand large, however, if two views are equally possible and the Judge is\n\nsatisfied that the evidence produced before him gives rise to some\n\nsuspicion, but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be fully\n\nwithin his right to discharge the accused.\n\nIn the facts of the case\n\nbefore it, this Court in\nSarbans Singh\n(supra) came to the conclusion\n\nthat, prima facie, the case had emerged in favour of the accused\n\nrather than in favour of the prosecution and, consequently, quashed\n\nthe order framing charges and discharged the petitioner.\n\n66. In the present case, on prima facie evaluation of the case and on\n\nsifting and weighing the evidence for that limited purpose, it cannot be\n\nsaid that a case against the accused has not been made out. It also\n\ncannot be said at this stage that the materials placed before the Court\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 31 of 40\n\ndo not disclose grave suspicion against the accused, or that, at this\n\nstage, the petitioner has been able to properly explain his conduct. In\n\nmy view, it cannot be said that the two views, namely, that the\n\npetitioner and the co-accused, Ashraf Jamal are guilty of the offences\n\nalleged against them, and the other view that they are not so guilty,\n\nare equally possible. Consequently in my view, neither\nSarbans\n\nSingh\n(supra) nor\nPrafulla\n(supra) are of any avail to the petitioner‟s\n\ncase.\n\n67.\nIn\nL.K.Advani\n(supra), this Court observed as follows:-\n\n\"57...............the prosecution must show a prima facie case\nagainst the accused in order to enable the Court to frame a\ncharge against him. If the evidence before the Court is of\nsuch type which if un-rebutted and un-challenged by way\nof cross- examination would not be sufficient enough to\nconvict the accused ultimately then the Court would not be\njustified in framing the charge against the accused. The\nCourt at that stage is under no obligation to make an\nelaborate enquiry by sifting and weighing the material to\nfind out a case against the accused beyond a reasonable\ndoubt which it is required to do at the time of the final\nhearing. The Judge at that preliminary stage is simply\nrequired to find out that there was material which may\nlead to the inference that the accused has committed an\noffence. Thus the charge can be framed by the Court\nagainst an accused if the material placed before it raises a\nstrong suspicion that the accused has committed an\noffence. In other words, the Court would be justified in\nframing the charges against an accused if the prosecution\nhas sown the seed in the form of the incriminating material\nwhich has got the potential to develop itself into a full-\nfledged tree of conviction later on.\"\n\n68. On the basis of the prosecution‟s case, the observation of the\n\nlearned Metropolitan Magistrate that a prima facie case exists against\n\nthe accused cannot be faulted. It cannot be said that the evidence\n\nbefore the Court is of such a type that if unrebutted and unchallenged\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 32 of 40\n\nby way of cross examination, the same would not be sufficient enough\n\nto convict the petitioner and the co-accused Ashraf Jamal. At this\n\nstage, the Court is not expected to make an elaborate enquiry by\n\nsifting and weighing material to find out whether or not a case against\n\nthe accused beyond reasonable doubt is made out. That enquiry is\n\nrequired to be done at the time of final hearing. Certainly, there is\n\nmaterial which may lead to the inference that the petitioner-accused\n\nhas committed the offences he is accused of.\n\n69. Rukmini Narwekar (supra), in my view, has no\n\napplication in the facts of this case. The Supreme Court held that in\n\nsome very rare and exceptional cases, where some defence material\n\nwhen shown to the trial court would convincingly demonstrate that the\n\nprosecution version is totally absurd and preposterous, the defence\n\nmaterial can be looked into by the Court at the time of framing of the\n\ncharges or taking cognizance.\n\n70. In the present case, the petitioner has failed to make out that\n\nrare and exceptional case and, even more importantly, the petitioner\n\nhas not produced any defence material which could have convincingly\n\ndemonstrated that the prosecution version is totally absurd or\n\npreposterous. The petitioner has sought to place before the Court\n\nvarious facets which may or may not eventually be accepted by the\n\ntrial Court after conducting the trial.\n\n71.\nSmt. Bhagwan Kaur\n(supra), in my view is not relevant to the\n\npetitioner‟s case at this stage. This is because the case of the\n\nprosecution is not entirely founded upon the evidence of the hand\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 33 of 40\n\nwriting expert. The evidence of the hand writing expert is being relied\n\nupon by the prosecution to provide support to its case of conspiracy,\n\ncheating and forgery.\n\nIn\nSukhdeo Singh\n(supra), the Supreme held\n\nthat a hand writing expert is a competent witness whose opinion\n\nevidence is recognized as relevant under the provisions of the\n\nEvidence Act\n. The Court held that it would not be fair to approach the\n\nopinion evidence with suspicion but the correct approach would be to\n\nweigh the reasons on which it is based. The science of identification of\n\nhand writing is an imperfect and frail one as compared to the science\n\nof identification of finger prints. Courts have, therefore, been wary in\n\nplacing implicit reliance on such opinion evidence and have looked for\n\ncorroboration depending upon the circumstances of the case and the\n\nquality of expert evidence. No hard and fast rule can be\nlaid down in\n\nthis behalf but the Court has to decide in each case on its own merit\n\nwhat weight it should attach to the opinion of the expert.\n\n72. In the present case it would be premature at this stage to assess\n\nthe weight to be attached to the hand writing experts opinion evidence\n\nas that would be a matter to be considered by the trial court. As\n\naforesaid, it cannot be said that prima facie there is no other evidence\n\nagainst the petitioner accused and the co-accused Ashraf Jamal.\n\nSukhdeo\n(supra), therefore, does not advance the petitioner‟s case.\n\n73. The decision of the Supreme Court in Sukhvinder Singh (supra)\n\nrelied upon by the petitioner has no relevance to the facts of this case.\n\nAs submitted by Mr. Pahwa, the hand writing expert opinion sought by\n\nthe CBI is not only on the basis of the specimen hand writing, but also\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 34 of 40\n\nthe admitted hand writing of the accused persons. The trial court in\n\nterms of\nSection 73\nof the Evidence Act can satisfy itself about the\n\nhand writing of the accused either by requiring the accused to writ the\n\nwords in the Court, or to obtain a fresh opinion of an expert.\n\n74.\nJibrial Diwan\n(supra) is a case entirely on its own facts. In that\n\ncase the accused had prepared the invitation letters for a cultural show\n\non the letter heads of the Minister. The letters did not bear the\n\nsignature of the Minister. It was found as a matter of fact that neither\n\nany wrongful gain to anyone nor any wrongful loss to another was\n\ncaused by delivery of the forged letters. The Court concluded that the\n\nact of the accused could not have been termed to have been done\n\ndishonestly. The Court held that the act of the accused did not cause\n\nor was not likely to cause harm to any person in body or mind. It was\n\nin those circumstances that the Supreme Court allowed the appeal and\n\nset aside the conviction of the petitioner. However, the same cannot\n\nbe said from the accusations made against the petitioner and the co-\n\naccused Ashraf Jamal. The charge against the petitioner and Ashraf\n\nJamal is that they have exchanged their answer sheets for the\n\nSociology paper and the petitioner has answered the question paper\n\nfor Ashraf Jamal and vice versa. The said acts, it is alleged, have been\n\ndone with a view to benefit Ashraf Jamal in passing the Civil Services\n\n(Preliminary Practical) Examination, 1993.\n\nTherefore, Jibrail Diwan\n\n(supra) has not application to the facts of the present case.\n\n75. Similarly, Parminder Kaur (supra) also has no relevance to the\n\nfacts of the present case. In that case, the accused was alleged to\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 35 of 40\n\nhave added the figure „1‟ before the date 6.05.2002 and 7.05.2002 and\n\nalso the figure „2‟ before the date 7.05.2002 so as to save her Suit\n\nfrom the bar of limitation. The Court found, as a matter of fact, that\n\nthe Civil Suit had been filed on 27.05.2002 i.e just after ten or twenty\n\ndays after the changed date or the original date. The change brought\n\nabout by adding the figure „1‟ would not cause any damage or injury to\n\npublic or anybody, nor could it support the claim or title nor could it\n\ncause any person to part with property. There could not be also any\n\nintention to commit fraud. The Court found that the Suit as filed was\n\nwell within the period of limitation. It was on this basis, and also on\n\nthe basis that the FIR was lodged by the brother-in-law of the accused\n\nas an act of vengeance, that the Supreme Court quashed the FIR\n\nagainst the accused.\n\n76. From the charges leveled against the petitioner and the co-\n\naccused, Ashraf Jamal, it cannot be said that their alleged conduct if\n\nestablished, could not cause any damage or injury to public or\n\nanybody, nor could it support the claim or title nor could it cause any\n\nperson to part with property. The analysis of Mr. Pahwa, recorded in\n\nparas 37 to 44 above, appeals to this court. Reliance placed on\n\nParminder Kaur (supra) is, therefore, rejected.\n\n77. Dr. Vimla (supra) is also a case which turned on its own facts.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that no injury had been caused to the person\n\ndeceived. The Supreme Court held that the expression „defraud‟\n\ninvolves two elements- deceit and injury to the person deceived.\n\n\"Injury\" is something other than economic loss i.e deprivation of\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 36 of 40\n\nproperty, whether movable or immovable or of money, and it will\n\ninclude any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind,\n\nreputation or such others. Therefore, the injury could be non-economic\n\nor non-pecuniary loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver will\n\nalmost always cause loss or detriment to the deceived. Even in those\n\nrare cases where there is a benefit or an advantage to the deceiver,\n\nbut no corresponding loss to the deceived, the second condition is\n\nsatisfied. In this case, the accused had purchased a motor car in the\n\nname of her minor daughter. She obtained the insurance policy which\n\nwas transferred in the name of her minor daughter. She claimed\n\ncompensation against genuine claims for two accidents. She signed\n\nclaim forms and receipts in the name of her minor daughter. The\n\nSupreme Court took the view that even though the accused was guilty\n\nof deceit, as she signed in all the relevant papers as her daughter and\n\nmade the insurance company believe that her name was that of her\n\ndaughter, but the said deceit did not either secure to her any\n\nadvantage, or cause any non economic loss or injury to the insurance\n\ncompany. The insurance company would have paid the claim even if\n\nthe claim had been made by disclosing that the daughter was minor.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that on the evidence as disclosed, neither was\n\nthe accused benefited nor the insurance company incurred any loss, in\n\nany sense of the term. The charges against the petitioner and the co-\n\naccused in the present case are entirely of a different nature as\n\nalready discussed hereinabove. Dr. Vimla (supra) has no application\n\nto the present case.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 37 of 40\n\n78.\nDevender Kumar\n(supra) is a case dealing with\nSection 420\n\nIPC. The Supreme Court observed that the essential ingredients to\n\nattract\nSection 420\nIPC are:- (i) cheating; (ii) dishonest inducement to\n\ndeliver property or to make alter or destroy any valuable security or\n\nanything which is sealed or signed or is capable of being converted\n\ninto a valuable security and (iii) the mens rea of the accused at the\n\ntime of making the inducement. The making of a false representation\n\nis one of the ingredients for the offence of cheating under\nSection 420\n\nIPC. The Supreme Court observed that it is not necessary that a false\n\npretext should be made in express words by the accused. It may be\n\ninferred from all the circumstances including the conduct of the\n\naccused in obtaining the property. In the true nature of things, it is not\n\nalways possible to prove dishonest intention by any direct evidence. It\n\ncan be proved by a number of circumstances from which a reasonable\n\ninference can be drawn.\n\n79. I find no merit in the submission of Mr. Mathur that the\n\ningredients of\nSection 420\nIPC are not made out in the charge sheet. I\n\nam inclined to accept the analysis placed before the Court by Mr.\n\nPahwa in paragraphs 36 to 46 above.\n\n80. Mohammed Ibrahim (supra) is again a case which has no\n\nrelevance to the petitioner‟s submissions. That was a case where the\n\naccused no.1 had executed a sale deed in favour of accused No.2\n\nclaiming that the property sold belonged to accused No.1. A criminal\n\ncomplaint was filed against the accused by the complainant, claiming\n\nthat the said property belonged to him and, therefore, accused No.1\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 38 of 40\n\nhad committed offences under\nSection 461\nand\nIPC. The Supreme\n\nCourt held:\n\n\"When a sale deed is executed conveying a property\nclaiming ownership thereto, it may be possible for the\npurchaser under such sale deed to allege that the vendor\nhas cheated him by making a false representation of\nownership and fraudulently induced him to part with sale\nconsideration. But in this case the complaint is not by the\npurchaser. On the other hand, the purchaser is made a co-\naccused. It is also not the case of the complainant that\nany of the accused tried to deceived him. Nor did the\ncomplainant allege that first appellant pretended to be\ncomplainant while executing the sale deeds. Therefore, it\ncannot be said that the first accused by the act of\nexecuting sale deeds in favour of second accused or the\nsecond accused by reason of being the purchaser, or the\nthird, fourth and fifth accused, by reason of being the\nwitness, scribe and stamp vendor in regard to the sale\ndeeds, deceived the complainant in any manner. As the\ningredients of cheating as stated in Section 415 are not\nfound, it cannot be said that there was an offence\npunishable under Sections 417, 418, 419 or 420\nIPC\n.\"\n\n81. The same certainly cannot be said to be the case in hand. If the\n\ncharge against the petitioner and the co-accused Ashraf Jamal is\n\nbelieved to be true, the two answer sheets prepared by each one of\n\nthem would, prima facie, constitute false documents as in that case,\n\nthe answer sheet claimed to be that of Ashraf Jamal would not be his,\n\nand that claimed to be of the petitioner would not be his. Mohammed\n\nIbrahim (supra) does not advance the petitioner‟s case.\n\n82.\nIn the light of the decisions in\nNrisingha Murari\n\nChakraborty\n(supra) and\nAbhayanand Mishra\n(supra), it cannot be\n\nsaid that the ingredients of the various offences of which the petitioner\n\nis accused are not disclosed in the charge sheet.\n\nCrl. Rev. P. No.270 /1999 Page 39 of 40\n\n83. Consequently, I find no merit in this petition. The impugned\n\norders dated 10.05.1999 and 06.07.1999 passed by the learned\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate in FIR No. RC 4(S) / 93-SIU-(II)-CBI are upheld.\n\nThe petition is dismissed.\n\n84. No observation made by me in this order shall prejudice the case\n\nof either party in the course of trial and the trial court shall not be\n\ninfluenced by anything stated in this order.\n\n85. Considering the fact that the case has been hanging fire since\n\nthe year 1999, and the trial has been stayed, I direct that the trial\n\nshould now proceed without any delay whatsoever and conclude it at\n\nthe earliest, preferable within the next six months.\n\n(VIPIN SANGHI)\nJUDGE\nMAY 18, 2011\n'SR/AS'\n\nCrl.
