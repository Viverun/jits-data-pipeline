Gavai\n,\nVikram Nath\n,\nSanjay Karol\nREPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1741 OF 2010\n\nUDAYAKUMAR … APPELLANT\n\nVERSUS\n\nSTATE OF TAMIL NADU … RESPONDENT\n\nJUDGEMENT\n\nSANJAY KAROL, J.\n\n1. The Appellant Udayakumar (A-2) stands convicted by both\n\nthe courts below for murdering one Purushothaman, thus\n\nhaving committed an offence punishable under\nSection 302\n\nof the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Consequently he is\n\nsentenced to suffer imprisonment for life. However, in\n\nrelation to an offence under\nSection 120-B\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 he stands acquitted vide impugned\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\njudgement delivered by High Court dated 15.03.2010 in\n\nNarendra Prasad\n\nDate: 2023.03.17\n\n16:35:12 IST\n\nReason:\nCriminal Appeal No. 17, 22 and 24 of 2010 titled as\n\nUdayakumar & Ors. v. The State of Tamil Nadu\n.\n\n2. Significantly, in terms of the very same impugned\n\njudgement, the other two co-accused persons namely\n\nPanneer Dass (A-1) and Periyasamy (A-3) stand acquitted in\n\nthe relation to both the offences i.e.\nSection 302\nand\nSection\n\n120-B\nof the Penal Code.\n\n3. As a result, the present appeal filed by convict, Udayakumar\n\n(A-2).\n\n4. Prosecution through the testimonies of 23 witnesses has\n\ntried to establish complicity of all the three accused on the\n\nprognosis that Panneer Das (A-1) was having business\n\nrelationship with the deceased (Purushothaman). Since\n\ncertain disputes and business rivalry emerged between the\n\ntwo, the former harboured a grudge against the latter.\n\nResultantly, he along with A-3 hatched a conspiracy to\n\nmurder the deceased and for achieving such a design\n\nservices of A-2 were engaged. On 22.10.2008, at about\n\n8:30PM, A-2 killed the victim with a sickle by giving blows\non the side of the neck. Immediately thereafter, A-1 and A-3\n\ncame in a vehicle, in which A-2 fled away from the spot of\n\nthe crime which was an open public road. The incident was\n\nwitnessed by Venkatesan (PW-1) who was known to the\n\ndeceased. With the matter being reported to the police, FIR\n\nNo. 2261 / 2008 dated 22.10.2008 was registered at Police\n\nStation, Theynampet. The investigation was conducted by\n\nPolice Officer Kuppusamy (PW-23) and after recovering the\n\nbody of the deceased, the post-mortem was conducted by\n\nDr. K.Mathiharan (PW-21). Initial investigation revealed\n\ncomplicity of A-1 and A-3. As such, the latter was arrested\n\non 16.12.2009, who disclosed the cause and the manner of\n\ncommission of crime.\n\n5. With the completion of investigation, challan was presented\n\nbefore the Court for Trial. Vide judgment dated 04.12.2009\n\nin S.C. No. 113 of 2009 titled as State v. Panneerdass & Ors.\n\nthe Ld. Trial Court, convicted all the accused in relation to\n\nthe offences charged for and sentenced them to a term of life\n\nimprisonment.\n6. Significantly, the High Court, by disbelieving the testimonies\n\nof the prosecution witnesses, repelling the case of\n\nconspiracy, acquitted A-1 and A-3 on all counts and only on\n\nthe basis of identification of A-2 by PW-1, upheld the\n\nconviction and sentence with respect to the offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code. It is\n\na matter of record that no appeal against the judgement of\n\nacquittal of A-1 and A-3 stands preferred by the prosecution\n\n/ State. Hence, this Court has been called upon only to\n\nexamine the guilt or innocence of A-2.\n\n7. We may reiterate that other than the identification of A-2\n\nbeing the assailant as witnessed by PW-1, there is no\n\nmaterial on record, be it of whatsoever nature, linking the\n\nAppellant to the crime. There is no material to indicate that\n\nA-1 or A-3 hired the services of A-2 for murdering deceased\n\nPurushotaman. Further, there is no material indicating the\n\naccused to have murdered the victim with a sickle, the\n\nalleged weapon of offence. No tell-tale signs or evidence, be it\n\nof any nature, scientific or otherwise, is on record, even\n\nremotely linking the convict to the crime.\n8. Examining the testimony of PW-1, we notice him to have\n\nfirstly reported the matter to the police and in the FIR there\n\nis no description of the assailant, much less identity of A-2\n\nto have been disclosed. Yet, the High Court, even while\n\ndiscarding the disclosure statement of A-3, convicted A-2,\n\nwhich in our considered view has resulted into travesty of\n\njustice.\n\n9. This Court in the case of\nAnil Phukan v. State of Assam\n,\n\n(1993) 3 SCC 282 has held that:\n\n“ 3. … So long as the single eyewitness is a wholly\nreliable witness the courts have no difficulty in basing\nconviction on his testimony alone. However, where the\nsingle eyewitness is not found to be a wholly reliable\nwitness, in the sense that there are some\ncircumstances which may show that he could have an\ninterest in the prosecution, then the courts generally\ninsist upon some independent corroboration of his\ntestimony, in material particulars, before recording\nconviction. It is only when the courts find that the\nsingle eyewitness is a wholly unreliable witness that\nhis testimony is discarded in toto and no amount of\ncorroboration can cure that defect…”\n\nExamining the testimony of PW-1, we find him to be\n\nmaterially contradicted and his version belied through the\n\ntestimony of the Investigation Officer, (PW-23). This is with\n\nregard to the identification of the accused. Whereas the\nformer states that he identified the accused in front of the\n\njudge, pursuant to the summons issued to him for making\n\nhimself available at Pulhal Jail, Chennai for the purpose of\n\nidentifying the accused, but the latter, in unequivocal terms\n\nstates that, “… it is correct to say that PW-1 would give the\n\nstatement that they came to know that the second accused\n\nUdayakumar had murdered Purushothaman” and that “it is\n\ncorrect to say that only after identifying the accused at the\n\nPolice Station, they had identified the accused at the\n\nidentification parade.” Now, if the identity of the accused\n\nwas already in the knowledge of the police or the witnesses,\n\nthen we only wonder, where would the question of\n\nconducting the identification parade arise? We reiterate that\n\nthe entire necessity for holding an investigation parade can\n\narise only when the accused are not previously known to the\n\nwitnesses. The whole idea of a test identification parade is that\n\nwitnesses who claim to have seen the culprits at the time of\n\noccurrence are to identify them from the midst of other persons\n\nwithout any aid or any other source. [\nHeera v State of\n\nRajasthan\n(2007) 10 SC 175]. We may also state that the\n\ninvestigation parade does not hold much value when the identity\nof the accused is already known to the witness.\n\n[\nSheikh Sintha\n\nMadhar v. State\n, (2016) 11 SCC 265].\nThis Court has\n\nelaborately stated the purpose of conducting the\n\nidentification parade in the case of State of Maharashtra v.\n\nSuresh, (2000) 1 SCC 471 as:\n\n“22. … We remind ourselves that identification\nparades are not primarily meant for the court. They\nare meant for investigation purposes. The object of\nconducting a test identification parade is twofold. First\nis to enable the witnesses to satisfy themselves that\nthe prisoner whom they suspect is really the one who\nwas seen by them in connection with the commission\nof the crime. Second is to satisfy the investigating\nauthorities that the suspect is the real person whom\nthe witnesses had seen in connection with the said\noccurrence. So the officer conducting the test\nidentification parade should ensure that the said\nobject of the parade is achieved. If he permits dilution\nof the modality to be followed in a parade, he should\nsee to it that such relaxation would not impair the\npurpose for which the parade is held [vide\nBudhsen v.\nState of U.P.\n(1970) 2 SCC 128;\nRamanathan v. State\nof T.N.\n(1978) 3 SCC 86].”\n\nFurther in\nGireesan Nair & Others v. State of Kerala\n\n(2023) 1 SCC 180, the Court observed that:\n\n“44.…this Court has categorically held that where the\naccused has been shown to the witness or even his\nphotograph has been shown by the investigating\nofficer prior to a TIP, holding an identification parade\nin such facts and circumstances remains\ninconsequential.\n\n45. Another crucial decision was rendered by this\nCourt in\nSk. Umar Ahmed Shaikh v. State of\nMaharashtra\n(1998) 5 SCC 103, where it was held:\n8. … But, the question arises : what value\ncould be attached to the evidence of identity of\naccused by the witnesses in the Court when\nthe accused were possibly shown to the\nwitnesses before the identification parade in\nthe police station. The Designated Court has\nalready recorded a finding that there was\nstrong possibility that the suspects were shown\nto the witnesses. Under such circumstances,\nwhen the accused were already shown to the\nwitnesses, their identification in the Court by\nthe witnesses was meaningless. The statement\nof witnesses in the Court identifying the\naccused in the Court lost all its value and could\nnot be made the basis for recording conviction\nagainst the accused….”\n\n10. If the theory of conspiracy was disbelieved by the High\n\nCourt then in our considered view, there was no basis or\n\nreason to have upheld the conviction of A-2, more so, when\n\non the basis of the very same set of evidence led by the\n\nprosecution, the principle conspirators involved in the crime\n\nwere acquitted.\n\n11. Unfortunately in the impugned judgement, there is neither\n\nany reasoning, nor any appreciation of evidence on record.\n\nWe cannot convict the accused on the basis of the principles\n\nof preponderance of probability. It is our duty to make sure\n\nthat miscarriage of justice is avoided at all costs and the\n\nbenefit of doubt, if any, given to the accused. [\nSujit Biswas\nv. State of Assam\n, (2013) 12 SCC 406, Hanumant\n\nGovind Nargundkar v. State of M.P. (AIR 1952 SC 343)\n\nand State v. Mahender Singh Dahiya, (2011) 3 SCC 109].\n\n12. We may also record that in the impugned judgment running\n\ninto 21 pages, the High Court has extensively dealt with the\n\ntheory of conspiracy and guilt of A-1 and A-3 and only in\n\nthe penultimate part, that is, paragraphs 26 and 27,\n\ncasually, dealt with the guilt of the A-3.\n\n13. In our considered view, prosecution has failed to establish\n\nthe guilt of the accused much less meeting the requirement\n\nof the same having been established beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n14. In the present case before us, we find neither the chain of\n\nevidence to have been completely established nor the\n\ncircumstances, conclusively pointing towards the guilt of\n\ncommission of crime by the Appellant. The prosecution has\n\nfailed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. This Court\n\nhas stated essential conditions that must be fulfilled before\n\nan accused can be convicted in a case revolving around\ncircumstantial evidence in the landmark case of Sharad\n\nBirdhichand Sarda v. State of Mahrashtra, (1984) 4 SCC\n\n116.\n\n15. In the normal course of adjudication followed by this Court,\n\nwhen there is a concurrent findings of fact by the Courts\n\nbelow, this Court interferes only in exceptional cases or\n\nwhere gross errors have been committed which overlook\n\ncrying circumstances and well established principles of\n\ncriminal jurisprudence. [\nRamaphupala Reddy v. State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n, (1970) 3 SCC 474, Balak Ram v. State\n\nof U.P., (\n1975) 3 SCC 219, Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State\n\nof Gujarat\n, (1983) 3 SCC 217]. Hence in the attending\n\ncircumstances, it becomes our bounden duty to correct\n\nsuch findings.\n\n16. To conclude, we state that the judgments of conviction and\n\nsentence in respect to the appellant present before us,\n\nUdayakumar (A-2), passed by the Ld. Trial Court in S.C. No.\n\n113 of 2009 dated 04.12.2009 as affirmed by the High\n\nCourt in Criminal Appeals No. 17, 22 and 24 of 2010 dated\n15.03.2010 titled as\nUdayakumar & Ors. v. The State of\n\nTamil Nadu\nare quashed and set aside.\n\n17. Appeal stands allowed.\n\n18. Since the appellant is already on bail, his bail bond shall\n\nstand discharged.\n\n………………J.\n(B.R.
