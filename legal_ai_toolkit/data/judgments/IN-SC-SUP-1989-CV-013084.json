The cadre of\nsupervisors includes degree holders in Engineering and\ndiploma or licence holders. The appellants are diploma\nholder supervisors. Their two-fold grievance was: (1) dis-\ncrimination in the matter of promotion in as much as the\nquota of promotion is four to one from amongst the graduate\nsupervisors and non-graduate supervisors, respectively; and\n(2) disparity in the matter of grant of different pay scales\nto graduate supervisors and non-graduate supervisors.\nFor the redressal of their first grievance, the non-\ngraduate supervisors had earlier, in Mohd. Sujat Ali v.\nUnion of India, [1975] 1 SCR 449, challenged the validity of\nthe Andhra Pradesh Engineering Service Rules, 1967 which\ngave preferential treatment to graduate supervisors for\npromotion to the post of Assistant Engineer. They had con-\ntended that this amounted to denial of equal opportunity to\nnon-graduate supervisors thus violating the equality clause\nenshrined under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. This\nCourt rejected the challenge, holding that the graduate\nsupervisors had always been treated as a distinct and sepa-\nrate class from non-graduate supervisors and that they were\nnever fused into one class.\nThe constant appeal relates to their second grievance\nand arises out of the writ petition filed by the non-gradu-\nate supervisors in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh chal-\nlenging discrimination in the matter of grant of different\npay scales to graduate and non-graduate supervisors. Their\ncontention was that they were entitled to the same scale of\npay as prescribed for the graduate supervisors on the prin-\nciple of equal pay for equal work, as they constituted the\nsame service and performed the same duties and functions as\nthose performed by graduate supervisors. The State Govern-\nment contested the case on the pleading that graduate super-\nvisors and diploma supervisors always remained separate and\nthey were never fused into one service. It was further\ncontended that even though the two class of employees dis-\ncharged the same functions and carried out similar duties,\nthe State was justified in prescribing different pay scales\nfor historical reasons, and also on the basis of difference\nin the educational qualifications.\nThe learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition. On\nappeal by the State, the Division Bench set aside the judg-\nment of the learned Single Judge and dismissed the writ\npetition on the finding that the State practised no discrim-\nination and the appellants were not entitled to relief on\nthe principle of equal pay for equal work.\nBefore this Court it was contended on behalf of the\nappellants that (1) the graduate and non-graduate supervi-\nsors constituted the same class as they belonged to the same\nservice and both the class of officers were fused into one,\nas the two posts were inter-changeable; (2)even if the two\nclass of officers constituted two different categories,\nsince they had been carrying out of the same work and per-\nforming the same duties carrying the same responsibility,\nwithout any distinction, the doctrine of equal pay for equal\nwork was fully applicable, and it was not necessary that the\ntwo class of officers must belong to one integrated service;\nand (iii) even if the appellant's grievance regarding viola-\ntion of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution was not\nsustainable, the appellants were entitled to the same scale\nof pay as granted to the graduate supervisors on the princi-\nple of 'equal pay for equal work' enshrined under\nArticle\n39(d)\nof the Constitution.\nDismissing the appeal, this Court,\nHELD: (1) There is a basic difference between the two\nclass of supervisors as graduate supervisors hold degree in\nEngineering while non-graduate supervisors are only Diploma\nand Licence holders, and they have all along been treated\ndifferently on the basis of difference in\neducational qualifications. Classification of Supervisor\ninto two classes on the basis of historical reasons is valid\nand it does not offend\nArticles 14\nor 16 of the Constitu-\ntion. [431B]\nMohammad Sujat Ali v. Union of India, referred to.\n(2) Since classification on the basis of educational\nqualification is a valid consideration for discriminating in\nmatters pertaining to promotion to higher post, there is no\nreason as to why the same principle is not applicable for\nprescribing scales of pay. [432C]\n(3) Classification in service rounded on the basis of\neducational and academic qualification is now well recog-\nnised. It is open to the administration to give preference\nto a class of employees on the basis of educational qualifi-\ncations, having regard to the nature of duties attached to\nthe post, for the purpose of achieving efficiency in public\nservices.

Triloki Nath Khosa,\n[1974] 1 SCC 19, referred to.\n(4) The principle of 'equal pay for equal work' is not\nan abstract one. It is open to the State to prescribe dif-\nferent scales of pay for different cadres having regard to\nnature of duties, responsibilities and educational qualifi-\ncations. Different grades are laid down in service with\nvarying qualification for entry into a particular grade.\nHigher qualification and experience based on length of\nservice are valid considerations for prescribing different\npay scales for different cadres. [433G-H; 434A]\nState of Mysore v. P. Narasing Rao, [1968] 1 S.C.R. 407,\nreferred to.\n(5) Where two class of employees perform identical or\nsimilar duties and carry out the same functions with the\nsame measure of responsibility, having same academic quali-\nfications, they would be entitled to equal pay. If the State\ndenies them equality in pay, its action would be violative\nof\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, and the Court\nwill strike down the discrimination and grant relief to the\naggrieved employees. But before such relief is granted the\ncourt must consider and analyse the rationale behind the\nState action in prescribing different scales of pay. If on\nan analysis of the relevant rules,\norders, nature of duties, functions, measure of responsibil-\nity, and educational qualifications required for the rele-\nvant posts, the court finds that the classification made by\nthe State in giving different treatment to the two class of\nemployees is rounded on rational basis having nexus with the\nobjects sought to be achieved, the classification must be\nupheld. Principles of equal pay for equal work is applicable\namong equals; it cannot be applied to unequals. [435E-G]\nFederation of All India .Customs and Central Stenogra-\nphers (Recognised) v.

All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Judg.\nToday (1989) 1 SC 512, referred to.\n(6) This Court granted relief in a number of cases after\nrecording findings that the aggrieved employees were dis-\ncriminated in violation of the equality clause under Arti-\ncles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, without there being any\nrationale for the classification, even though in some cases\nthe two class of employees did not constitute the same\nservice.

Provi-\nsions contained in the Chapter on Directive Principles of\nState Policy cannot be enforced by courts although the\nprinciples contained therein are fundamental in nature for\nthe governance of our country. [432H; 433A]\n(8) Fundamental rights and the Directive Principles\nconstitute \"Conscience of the Constitution\". The Constitu-\ntion aims at bringing about a synthesis between \"Fundamental\nRights' and 'Directive Principles of State Policy' by giving\nto the former a place of pride and to the latter a place of\npermanence; together they form core of the Constitution.\nThey constitute its true conscience and without faithfully\nimplementing the Directive Principles it is not possible to\nachieve the welfare State contemplated by the Constitution.\n[433D]\nKeshavanand Bharti v. State of Kerala, [1973] 4 SCC 225,\nreferred to.\n(9) The Court has no power to direct the Legislature to\nframe laws to give effect to the Directive Principles as\ncontained in Part IV of the Constitution or to injunct the\nLegislature from making any such law. But while considering\nthe question of enforcement of fundamental rights of a\ncitizen, it is open to the Court to be guided by the Direc-\ntive Principles to ensure that in doing justice the Princi-\nples contained therein are maintained. [433A-B]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 764 of\n1978.\n\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 5.7.1974 of the Andhra\nPradesh High Court in W .A. No. 71 of 1974.\n\nH.S. Guru Raja Rao, S. Markendeya, Mrs. Chitra Marken-\ndeya, G. Seshagiri and Kumari Usha Saraswat for the Appel-\nlants.\n\nP.A. Choudhary and T.V.S.N. Chari for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSINGH, J. This appeal is directed against the judgment\nand order of a Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra\nPradesh setting aside the order of a learned single Judge,\ndismissing the appellant' writ petition made under\nArticle\nof the Constitution.\n\nThe appellants are members of the Andhra Pradesh Engi-\nneering Subordinate Service as supervisors in Category 1 of\nthe Engineering Branch. The Engineering Branch category 1\nincludes officers, namely, Supervisors, Overseers, Head\nDraftsmen, Civil Draftsmen, Artists Draftsmen, Tracers,\nBlue-Print Operators and Building Mistries. Supervisors are\nrecruited by direct recruitment as well as by promotion from\namongst the Overseers. The cadre of supervisors include\ndegree holders in engineering and diploma or licence hold-\ners. Both perform the same duties and functions in the\nengineering branch. Promotion to the post of Assistant\nEngineer, the next higher post is made from amongst the post\nof supervisors, in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Engi-\nneering Service Rules 1967. Graduate Overseers are given\npreference in the ratio of promotion to the post of Assist-\nant Engineer inasmuch as the quota of promotion is four to\none from amongst the graduate supervisors and non-graduate\nsupervisors. In addition to the disparity in the matter of\npromotion, graduate supervisors and non-graduate supervisors\nare granted different pay.\nOn recruitment to the service of supervisors a graduate\nsupervisor is granted higher starting salary than non-gradu-\nate supervisors. Subsequently, a lower pay scale was pre-\nscribed for the non-graduate supervisors. Aggrieved the\nnon-graduate supervisors filed two writ petitions in the\nHigh Court of Andhra Pradesh under\nArticle 226\nof the Con-\nstitution challenging validity of discrimination in pre-\nscribing two different scales of pay. The appellants con-\ntended that diploma-holder supervisors were entitled to the\nsame scale of pay as prescribed for the graduate supervisors\non the principle of equal pay for equal work as they consti-\ntuted the same service and performed the same duties and\nfunctions as those performed by graduate supervisors. The\nState Government contested their case on the pleading that\ngraduate supervisors and diploma supervisors always remained\nseparate and they were never fused into one service. The two\nclass of employees discharged the same functions and carried\nout similar duties, but the State was justified in prescrib-\ning different pay scales for historical reasons, and also on\nthe basis of difference in the educational qualifications.\nPlea of discrimination against non-graduate supervisors was\ndenied. A learned Single Judge of the High Court Justice O.\nChinnappa Reddy (as he then was) by his judgment and order\ndated February 26, 1974 held that the State practised invid-\nious discrimination without there being valid justification\nbetween the two categories of supervisors graduates and\nnon-graduates. The learned judge allowed both the writ\npetitions and issued mandamus to the State Government to\naccord the same scale of pay to the non-graduate supervisors\nas prescribed for the graduate supervisors under the Govern-\nment Order dated June 13, 1969. On appeals preferred by the\nState of Andhra Pradesh a Division Bench of the High Court\nset aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge and\ndismissed the writ petitions on the finding that the State\npractised no discrimination and the appellants were not\nentitled to relief on the principle of equal pay for equal\nwork. Hence this appeal by special leave.\n\nThis is the second round of litigation by the Diploma-\nholder Supervisors. Earlier they had challenged the grant of\nhigher quota of promotion for graduate Supervisors on the\nground that when graduate and non-graduate Supervisors,\nbelong to the same cadre, and are eligible for promotion,\nthen giving preferential treatment to graduates amount to\ndenial of equal opportunity to the non-graduate Supervisors.\nThis Court in\nMohd. Sujat Ali v. Union of India\n, [1975] 1\nSCR 449, rejected the challenge holding that two categories\nof Supervisors were never fused into one class and have\nthroughout remained distinct and apart. The non-graduate\nsupervisors have again challenged the\ndisparity in the pay scale prescribed for the two class of\nsupervisors.\n\nSince controversy in the present appeals centers round\nthe pay of the Supervisors it is necessary to refer to the\nhistory of pay scales prescribed for the Supervisors. Prior\nto 1958 the scale of pay prescribed for Supervisors was Rs.\n100-5-1-250 but directly recruited graduate Supervisors were\ngranted initial starting salary at Rs. 150 on the date of\ntheir initial appointment while a diploma holder Supervisor\nwas paid starting salary of Rs. 100 only, though the same\npay scale was prescribed for both the degree holders and\ndiploma holders. On his appointment a graduate supervisor\nWas designated as Junior Engineer while a non-graduate\ncontinued to be designated as supervisor. In 1958 the scale\nof pay of Supervisors was revised to Rs. 100-5-150-7.1/2-\n20010-300 but graduate Supervisors were continued to be\ngranted higher starting salary at Rs. 180 on the date of\ntheir initial appointment. Later, the starting salary of\ngraduate Supervisors was raised to Rs.200 and their pay was\nfixed in the pay scale of Rs.200-10-300. In 1961 the scale\nof pay of Supervisors was again revised according to which\nnon-graduate supervisors were granted pay-scale of Rs. 180-\n7.1/2-210-10280-15-400, while Junior Engineers (graduate\nSupervisors) were granted the scale of Rs.250-15-400. Though\ndifferent pay scales were provided for non-graduate Supervi-\nsors and graduate Supervisors but the maximum pay for both\nthe categories was maintained at the same level, irrespec-\ntive of the Supervisor being a graduate or a non-graduate.\nThe State Government further revised the pay scale of both\nthe categories of Supervisors by the Government Order No.\n173 dated 13th June 1969 according to which the scale of pay\nof non-graduate Supervisors was revised to\nRs.200-12-320-16-400 while the scale for Junior Engineers\n(Graduate Supervisors) was revised to Rs.300-20600. The\nrevised pay scales made substantial difference in the matter\nof pay between the graduate supervisors and non-graduate\nsupervisors, which gave rise to the disputes before the High\nCourt.\n\nMr. H.S. Gururaja Rao, learned counsel for the appel-\nlants urged that non-graduate supervisors and graduate\nsupervisors constitute the same class as they belong to the\nsame service and both the class of officers are fused into\none, as the two posts are interchangeable. The graduate\nsupervisors are no doubt designated as Junior Engineers but\nthe work and duties of both are the same, and both set of\nofficers are treated at part for every other purpose. Since\nthe two categories of officers were fused into one, the\nState denied equality by prescribing different scales of pay\nfor the non-graduate supervisors. Learned counsel further\nurged that even if the graduate\nsupervisors (Junior Engineers) and non-graduate supervisors\nconstitute two different categories, but since they have\nbeen carrying out the same work and performing the same\nduties carrying the same responsibility, without any dis-\ntinction the doctrine of equal pay for equal work is fully\napplicable and on that basis the non-graduate supervisors\nare also entitled to the same pay scales as prescribed for\nthe graduate supervisors (Junior Engineers). Learned counsel\nemphasised that for application of the principle of equal\npay for equal work it is not necessary that the two class of\nofficers must belong to one integrated service instead if\nthe nature of duties and functions of the two posts are\nidentical or similar, the principle would apply. He referred\nto a number of decisions, reference to which will be made at\nthe appropriate stage. Shri P.A. Chaudhry, learned counsel\nappearing for the respondent State seriously contested the\ncorrectness of the submissions made on behalf of the appel-\nlants and urged that in view of the Constitution Bench\ndecision of this Court in\nMohammad Shujat Ali\n's case (supra)\nthe appellants are not entitled to any relief.\nSince the Division Bench of the High Court rejected the\nappellants' claim for equal pay in view of the findings of a\nConstitution Bench of this Court in Mohammad Shujat Ali's\ncase it is necessary to refer to that case in some detail.\n\nIn\nShujat Ali\n's case non-graduate supervisors of Andhra\nPradesh had challenged validity of the rule which gave\npreferential treatment to graduate supervisors (Junior\nEngineers) for promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer\non the ground that it violated the equality clause enshrined\nunder\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. In that con-\ntext, the question arose whether the preferential treatment\ngiven to graduate supervisors was justified on any reasona-\nble classification or it was arbitrary and irrational.\nBhagwati, J. speaking for the Constitution Bench after\nconsidering various decisions of this Court observed as\nunder:\n\n\"But where graduates and non-graduates are\nboth regarded as fit, and, therefore, eligible\nfor promotion, it is difficult to see how,\nconsistently with the claim for equal opportu-\nnity, any differentiation can be made between\nthem by laying down a quota of promotion for\neach and giving preferential treatment to\ngraduates over non-graduate in the matter of\nfixation of such quota. The result of fixation\nof quota of promotion for each of the two\ncategories of Supervisors would be that when a\nvacancy arises in the post of Assistant Engi-\nneer, which, according to the quota is re-\nserved for graduate Supervisors, a non-\ngraduate supervisors cannot be promoted to\nthat vacancy, even' if he is senior to all\nother graduate Supervisors and more suitable\nthan they. His opportunity for promotion would\nbe limited only to vacancies available for\nnon-graduate Supervisors. That would clearly\namount to denial of equal opportunity to him.\"\n\nThe above observation would show that the\nConstitution Bench held that fixation of quota\ngiving preference to graduate supervisors\namounted to denial of equal opportunity to the\nnon-graduate supervisors. But after making the\naforesaid observations the Constitution Bench\nconsidered the history of the graduate super-\nvisors and non-graduate supervisors under the\nAndhra Pradesh Rules and thereupon, it record-\ned findings that the graduate supervisors have\nalways been treated as a distinct and separate\nclass from non-graduate supervisors both under\nthe Hyderabad Rules as well as under the\nAndhra Pradesh Rules and they were never\ntreated as equals. The Bench observed as\nunder:\n\n\"The pay-scale of Junior Engineers was always\ndifferent from that of non-graduate supervi-\nsors and for the purpose of promotion, the two\ncategories of supervisors were kept distinct\nand apart under the Andhra Rules even after\nthe appointed day. The common gradation list\nof supervisors finally approved by the Govern-\nment of India also consisted of two parts, one\npart relating to Junior Engineers and the\nother part relating to non-graduate supervi-\nsors. The two categories of supervisors were\nthus never fused into one class and no ques-\ntion of unconstitutional discrimination could\narise by reasons of differential treatment\nbeing given to them.\"\n\nIn view of the aforesaid findings of the Constitution Bench\nwhich relate to this very cadre of supervisors, it is diffi-\ncult to accept the appellants' contention that the graduate\nsupervisors and non-graduate supervisors were integrated\ninto one class of service and that no differential treatment\nis permissible to the non-graduate supervisors. The Consti-\ntution Bench on elaborate discussion held that the equality\nclause under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution was not\nviolated in the matter of promotion of graduate supervisors\nand non-graduate supervisors, as the graduate supervisors\nand non-graduate supervisors constituted two different\nclasses. The necessary consequence of the Constitution Bench\nfindings are that the classification of Supervisors into two\nclas-\nses on the basis of historical reasons is valid and it does\nnot offend\nArticle 14\nor 16 of the Constitution. Once the\nclassification is upheld it is difficult to hold that non-\ngraduate supervisors are entitled to the same pay scale as\nprescribed for graduate supervisors as equality in pay is\npermissible with equals and not with unequals. There is\nbasic difference between the two class of supervisors as\ngraduate supervisors hold degree in Engineering while non-\ngraduate supervisors are only Diploma and Licence holder and\nthey have all along been treated differently on the basis of\ndifferent in educational qualifications.\n\nIn State of Mysore v.P. Narasingh Rao, [1968] 1 SCR 407\nthe question arose whether two different pay scales could be\nprescribed for the employees working in the same service on\nthe basis of educational qualification. In the State of\nMysore tracers included matriculates and non-matriculates.\nThe government prescribed higher pay scale to matriculate\ntracers although the non-matriculates and matriculates\ntracers both were performing the same duties and functions.\nThe non-matriculate tracers challenged the validity of\ndifferent pay scales on the ground that it violated the\nguarantee of equality under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Con-\nstitution as there was no valid reason for making distinc-\ntion. The High Court accepted their contention and allowed\ntheir petition holding that there was no valid reason for\nmaking distinction as both matriculate and non-matriculate\ntracers were doing the same kind of work and the denial of\ndifferent scale of pay was in violation of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. On appeal by the State Government\nthis Court set aside the order of the High Court on the\nfinding that higher educational qualification is a relevant\nconsideration for fixing different pay scales and the clas-\nsification of two grades of tracers did not violate of\n\nArticle 14\nor 16 of the Constitution. The Constitution Bench\nobserved as under:\n\n\"The provisions of\nArticle 14\nor\nArticle 16\ndo\nnot exclude the laying down of selective\ntests, nor do they preclude the Government\nfrom laying down qualifications for the post\nin question. Such qualifications need not be\nonly technical but they can also be general\nqualifications relating to the suitability of\nthe candidate for public service as such. It\nis therefore not fight to say that in the\nappointment to the post of tracers the Govern-\nment ought to have taken into account only the\ntechnical proficiency of the candidates in the\nparticular craft. It is open to the Government\nto consider also the general educational\nattainments of the candidates and to give\npreference to candidates who have a better\neducational qualification besides technical\nproficiency of a tracer.\"\n\nClassification in service rounded on the basis of educa-\ntional and academic qualifications is now well recognised.\nIt is open to the Administration to give preference to a\nclass of employees on the basis of educational qualifica-\ntions having regard to the nature of duties attached to the\npost for the purposes of achieving efficiency in public\nservices. It is permissible to give preference to degree\nholders as was held by this Court in\nUnion of India v. Dr.\n(Mrs.) S.B. Kohli\n, [1973] 3\nSCC 592 and State of Jammu &\nKashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa\n, [1974] 1 SCC 19. Since clas-\nsification on the basis of educational qualification is a\nvalid consideration for discriminating in matters pertaining\nto promotion to the higher post, there is no reason as to\nwhy the same principle is not be applicable for prescribing\nscales of pay.\n\nHaving regard to the findings recorded by the\nConstitution Bench in\nMohammad Shujat Ali\n's case that gradu-\nate supervisors and non-graduate supervisors constitute two\ndistinct class, the non-graduate supervisors cannot validly\nclaim parity with the graduate supervisors regarding pay\nscales. The appellants grievance that they have been denied\nequality in violation of\nArticle 14\nor 16 of the Constitu-\ntion is not sustainable.\n\nLearned counsel for the appellants urged that even if\nthe appellants' grievance regarding violation of\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution is not sustainable, the appel-\nlants are entitled to the same scale of pay as granted to\nthe graduate supervisors on the principle of 'equal pay for\nequal work' enshrined under\nArticle 39(d)\nof the Constitu-\ntion. He placed reliance on the decision of this Court in\n\nRandhir Singh v. Union of India & Ors.\n, [1982] 3 SCR 298;\nP.\nSavita v. Union of India\n, [1985] Supp.\n\nSCR 101;\nDhirendra\nChamoli & Anr. v. State of U.P.\n, [1986] 1 SCC 637;\nSurinder\nSingh & Anr. v. Engineer-in-Chief, CPWD & Ors.\n, [1986] 1 SCC\n639;\nBhagwan Dass v. State of Haryana\n, [1987] 4 SCC 634 and\nJaipal v. State of Haryana, [1988] 3 SCC 354. In view of\nthese authorities the learned counsel contended, there is no\njustification to disregard the doctrine of 'equal pay for\nequal work' as graduate supervisors and the non-graduate\nsupervisors both have been doing the same work with the same\nresponsibilities without there being any difference in the\nduties and functions of the two categories of officers.\n\nArticle 39(d)\ncontained in part IV of the Constitution,\nordains the State to direct its policy towards securing\nequal pay for equal work for both men and women. Provisions\ncontained in the Chapter on\nDirective Principles of State Policy cannot be enforced by\ncourts although the principles contained therein are funda-\nmental in nature for the governance of our country. The\ncourt has no power to direct the Legislature to frame laws\nto give effect to the Directive Principles as contained in\nPart IV of the Constitution or to injunct the Legislature\nfrom making any such law. But while considering the question\nof enforcement of fundamental rights of a citizen it is open\nto the court to be guided by the Directive Principles to\nensure that in doing justice the principles contained there-\nin are maintained. The purpose of\nArticle 39(d)\nis to fix\ncertain social and economic goals for avoiding any discrimi-\nnation amongst the citizens doing similar work in matters\nrelating to pay. If the court finds that discrimination is\npractised amongst two set of employees similarly situated in\nmatters relating to pay, the court must strike down discrim-\nination, and direct the State to adhere to the doctrine of\n'equal pay for equal work' as enshrined under\nArticle 39(d)\n\nof the Constitution. Fundamental rights, and the Directive\nPrinciples constitute \"conscience, of the Constitution\". The\nConstitution aims at bringing about a synthesis between\n'Fundamental Rights' and 'Directive Principles of State\nPolicy' by giving to the former a place of pride and to the\nlatter a place of permanence, together they form core of the\nConstitution.\nThey constitute its true conscience and with-\nout faithfully implementing the Directive Principles it is\nnot possible to achieve the welfare State contemplated by\nthe Constitution see Keshavanand Bharti v. State of Kerala,\n[1973] 4 SCC 225.\n\nIn\nRandhir Singh\n's case (supra) and later in\nDhirendra\nChamoli\n's case (\nsupra), Surinder Singh\n's case (\nsupra),\nBhagwan Dass\n's case (supra).\n\nJaipal's case (\nsupra) and P.\nSativa\n's case (supra), this Court implemented the principle\nof 'equal pay for equal work'. The Court granted relief on\nthe principle of equal pay on the basis of same or similar\nwork performed by two class of employees under the same\nemployer even though the two class of employees did not\nconstitute the same service. But in all the aforesaid cases\nrelief was granted only after it was found that discrimina-\ntion was practised in giving different scales of pay in\nviolation of the equality clause enshrined under\nArticle 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution. The principle of equal pay for\nequal work was enforced on the premise that discrimination\nwas practised between the two set of employees performing\nthe same duties and functions, without there being any\nrational classification. The principle of 'equal pay for\nequal work' is not abstract one, it is open to the State to\nprescribe different scale of pay for different cadres having\nregard to nature, duties, responsibilities and educational\nqualifications. Different grades are\nlaid down in\nservice\nwith varying\nqualification for entry into, particular grade. Higher\nqualification and experience based on length of service are\nvalid considerations for prescribing different pay scales\nfor different cadres. The application of doctrine arises\nwhere employees are equal in every respect, in educational\nqualifications, duties, functions and measure of responsi-\nbilities and yet they are denied equality in pay. If the\nclassification, for prescribing different scales of pay is\nrounded on reasonable nexus the principle will not apply.\nBut if the classification is rounded on unreal and unreason-\nable basis it would violate\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Con-\nstitution and the principle of equal pay for equal work,\nmust have its way. In the decisions reference to which have\nbeen made by the learned counsel for the appellants, this\nCourt granted relief, after recording findings that the\naggrieved employees were discriminated in violation of the\nequality clause under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitu-\ntion, without there being any rationale for the classifica-\ntion.\n\nIn a number of decisions of this Court the claim for\nequal pay for equal work has been negatived on the ground\nthat the different pay scales prescribed for persons doing\nsimilar or same work is permissible on the basis of classi-\nfication rounded on the measure of responsibilities, educa-\ntional qualifications, experience and other allied matters.\nIn Federation of All India Customs and Central Excise Ste-\nnographers (Recognised) v. Union of India, [1988] 3 SCC 91,\nJustice Sabyasachi Mukharji said (SCC p. 100 para 7).\n\n\"There may be qualitative differences as\nregards reliability and responsibility. Func-\ntions may be the same but the responsibilities\nmake a difference. One cannot deny that often\nthe difference is a matter of degree and that\nthere is an element of value judgment by those\nwho are charged with the administration in\nfixing the scales of pay and other conditions\nof service. So long as such value judgment is\nmade bona fide, reasonably on an intelligible\ncriteria which has a rational nexus with the\nobject of differentiation, such differentia-\ntion will not amount to discrimination. It is\nimportant to emphasise that equal pay for\nequal work is a concomitant of\narticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution. But it follows naturally\nthat equal pay for unequal work will be a\nnegation of that right.\"\n\nThe learned Judge further observed: (SCC pp.\n104-105 para 11)\n\"The same amount of physical work may entail\ndifferent\nquality less--it varies from nature and cul-\nture of employment. The problem about equal\npay cannot always be translated into a mathe-\nmatical formula. If it has a rational nexus\nwith the object to be sought for, as reiterat-\ned before a certain amount of value judgment\nof the administrative authorities who are\ncharged with fixing the pay scale has to be\nleft with them and it cannot be interfered\nwith by the court unless it is demonstrated\nthat either it is irrational or based on no\nbasis or arrived mala fide either in law or\ninfact.\n\nIn State of U.P. and Others v.J.P. Chaurasia & Ors.,\n[1989] 1 SCC 121, this Court negatived the claim of Bench\nSecretaries for equal pay for equal work on the basis of\nreasonable classification based on merit, experience and\nseniority though both set of employees were performing the\nsimilar duties and having similar responsibilities.\nIn\nMewa\nRam Kanojia v. All India Institute of Medical Sciences &\nOrs., Judg\n. Today 1989 (1) SC 5 12, this Court refused to\ngrant relief to the petitioner for parity in pay on the\napplication of the principle of 'equal pay for equal work'\non the ground of reasonable classification on the basis of\neducational qualifications.\n\nIn view of the above discussion we are of the opinion\nthat where two class of employees perform identical or\nsimilar duties and carrying out the same functions with the\nsame measure of responsibility having same academic qualifi-\ncations, they would be entitled to equal pay. If the State\ndenies them equality in pay, its action would be violative\nof\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, and the Court\nwill strike down the discrimination and grant relief to the\naggrieved employees. But before such relief is granted the\ncourt must consider and analyse the rationale behind the\nState action in prescribing two different scales of pay. If\non an analysis of the relevant rules, orders, nature of\nduties, functions, measure of responsibility, and education-\nal qualifications required for the relevant posts, the court\nfinds that the classification made by the State in giving\ndifferent treatment to the two class of employees is rounded\non rational basis having nexus with the objects sought to be\nachieved, the classification must be upheld. Principle of\nequal pay for equal work is applicable among equals, it\ncannot be applied to unequals. Relief to an aggrieved person\nseeking to enforce the principles of equal pay for equal\nwork can be granted only after it is demonstrated before the\ncourt that invidious discrimination is practised by the\nState in prescribing two different scales for the two class\nof employees without there being any reasonable classifica-\ntion\nfor the same. If the aggrieved employees fail to demonstrate\ndiscrimination, the principle of equal pay for equal work\ncannot be enforced by court in abstract. The question what\nscale should be provided to a particular class of service\nmust be left to the Executive and only when discrimination\nis practised amongst the equals, the court should intervene\nto undo the wrong, and to ensure equality among the similar-\nly placed employees. The Court however cannot prescribe\nequal scales of pay for different class of employees.\nIn the instant case the graduate overseers have all\nalong being treated separate entity from the non-graduate\nsupervisors and they have been drawing different pay since\nlong. The Constitution Bench has already recorded findings\nthat two set of officers, namely, graduate supervisors and\nnon-graduate supervisors do not belong to the same class of\nservice and unequal treatment relating to promotion is\njustified on the basis of educational qualification. There-\nfore the classification made between the graduate supervi-\nsors and non-graduate supervisors is reasonable and the\nState Government did not violate\nArticle 14\nor 16 of the\nConstitution in prescribing different scales of pay for\nthem. In result, the appeal fails and is accordingly dis-\nmissed. There will be no order as to costs.\n\nR.S.S. Appeal dis-\nmissed.",

HEADNOTE: THE APPELLANTS ARE MEMBERS OF THE ANDHRA PRADESH ENGI- NEERING SUBORDINATE SERVICE AS SUPERVISORS. THE CADRE OF SUPERVISORS INCLUDES DEGREE HOLDERS IN ENGINEERING AND DIPLOMA OR LICENCE HOLDERS. THE APPELLANTS ARE DIPLOMA HOLDER SUPERVISORS. THEIR TWO-FOLD GRIEVANCE WAS: (1) DIS- CRIMINATION IN THE MATTER OF PROMOTION IN AS MUCH AS THE QUOTA OF PROMOTION IS FOUR TO ONE FROM AMONGST THE GRADUATE SUPERVISORS AND NON-GRADUATE SUPERVISORS, RESPECTIVELY; AND (2) DISPARITY IN THE MATTER OF GRANT OF DIFFERENT PAY SCALES TO GRADUATE SUPERVISORS AND NON-GRADUATE SUPERVISORS.

THEIR CONTENTION WAS THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO THE SAME SCALE OF PAY AS PRESCRIBED FOR THE GRADUATE SUPERVISORS ON THE PRIN- CIPLE OF EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, AS THEY CONSTITUTED THE SAME SERVICE AND PERFORMED THE SAME DUTIES AND FUNCTIONS AS THOSE PERFORMED BY GRADUATE SUPERVISORS.
