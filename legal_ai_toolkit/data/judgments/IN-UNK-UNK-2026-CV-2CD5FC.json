No.242 of 2009\ndismissing the application filed by the appellant seeking family pension\nfor the death of her husband Ex. Sepoy Raj Singh.\n\n3. Undisputed facts of the case are as follows:- Raj Singh was\nenrolled in the 103 Infantry Battalion (Territorial Army) on 17.05.1995.\nHe was disembodied from service with effect from 31.03.2008 under Rule 20\nof the Territorial Army Rules, 1948 and during disembodiment Raj Singh died\nat his home on 04.08.2008 due to heart attack. Raj Singh rendered a total\nservice of eleven years and two hundred eighty nine days. The family\npension was denied to the appellant vide letter dated 12.12.2008 stating\nthat as per the existing rules, territorial army personnel who died during\ndisembodied state without completing fifteen years of embodied service are\nnot entitled for service pension. The appellant, being the wife of the\ndeceased, served a legal notice upon the respondents on 05.01.2009 for\nrelease of death-cum-retirement gratuity, service gratuity and family\npension. The department issued a demand draft dated 21.10.2009 for\nRs.1,82,448/- in favour of the appellant on account of service gratuity and\ndeath-cum-retirement gratuity. Aggrieved thereof, appellant preferred Writ\nPetition No.16566 of 2009 seeking direction against the respondents to\nrelease the family pension. Upon constitution of Armed Forces Tribunal,\nChandigarh, the writ petition was transferred to the Armed Forces Tribunal,\nChandigarh and renumbered as T.A. No.242 of 2009 before the Tribunal.\n\n4. The Tribunal vide impugned order dated 13.05.2011 dismissed the\napplication inter alia holding that, Raj Singh did not have the requisite\nminimum qualifying embodied service of fifteen years to earn service\npension, and hence upon his death while he was in disembodied state, the\nappellant was not entitled to family pension. The tribunal held that\npersons in territorial army cannot at all times be treated on par with the\narmy personnel, the territorial army personnel while in disembodied state\ndoes not stand on the same footing as compared to regular army personnel\nand thus held that the appellant was not entitled to family pension.\nContention of the appellant that denial of family pension to ‘next of kin’\nof territorial army personnel who died in harness while in disembodied\nstate is discriminatory and violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of\nIndia, was held untenable.\n\n5. Relying upon Regulation 289 of the Pension Regulation for Army\n(Part-I) 1961 Edition, Mr. Naresh Kumar learned counsel for the appellant\nhas contended that the Pension Regulation for Army 1961 apply to the\nregular army personnel as well as to the personnel of territorial army in\ncertain contingencies. Learned counsel for the appellant therefore,\nsubmitted that, denial of family pension to the appellant when her husband\nadmittedly died in harness is not justified when such a benefit is extended\nto the widow of a regular army personnel who died in harness. The\nGovernment circular dated 11.06.1985, especially paragraph 3(ii) thereof,\nread with subsequent circulars dated 30.10.1987, 03.02.1998 and 12.11.2008\nwas also pressed into service by the counsel for the appellant to\nsubstantiate his argument. It was contended that there is no statutory\nrule denying family pension to Territorial Army personnel dying at home and\nsince the territorial army reservists during disembodied state are liable\nto be called at any time, failure of which is treated as absence without\nleave, denial of family pension in the event of Territorial Army personnel\ndying natural death during disembodied state would be arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory. Reliance was also placed upon judgments of various High\nCourts and tribunals.\n\n6. Mr. Balasubramanian, learned counsel appearing for Union of\nIndia at the outset fairly submitted that the Pension Regulations for the\narmy govern the entitlement to various types of pensions including, family\npension to family of deceased regular army personnel, as well as to family\nof deceased personnel of the territorial army, read with various circulars\nthat are issued by the Government of India from time to time. But it was\nstrenuously canvassed before us by the learned counsel for the Union of\nIndia that, in the case of family pension to the family of deceased\npersonnel of the Territorial Army, the entitlement has to flow either from\nthe fact that the deceased soldier had put in minimum qualifying embodied\nservice of fifteen years, and thus had become entitled to service pension,\nin which case the family pension gets granted to the widow or other\neligible person(s) as per rules, or alternatively, the deceased ought to\nhave died in harness when he was in an embodied state i.e., while he was on\nactive duty having been called out or attached to any part of the regular\narmy. Conversely, it was argued that if the death had occurred when the\ndeceased was in a disembodied state, and if the deceased individual had not\nput in minimum period of qualifying service of fifteen years, then the\nentitlement to family pension arising out of death in harness would not\narise. In this regard the counsel for the Union of India drew our\nattention to Pension Regulations for the Army, Part-I (2008) which has\nsuperseded the Pension Regulations for the Army 1961 with effect from\n01.07.2008. Our attention was especially drawn to Section 2 titled\n‘Ordinary Family Pension’ Regulation 62, which inter alia lays down that,\nthe regulations shall not apply to the members of the Territorial Army\nother than those who die while rendering ‘embodied service’ or after\nretirement with pension under the said Regulations.\n\n7. We have considered the rival submissions and also perused the\nimpugned order & materials placed on record.\n\n8. The distinctive features of Territorial Army and regular army\nare significant in the present case. As per Army Order 77/1984, the\nTerritorial Army is a part of the regular Indian Army. The role of\nTerritorial Army is to relieve the regular army from static duties, assist\ncivil administration in dealing with natural calamities and maintenance of\nessential services in situations where life of the communities is affected\nor the security of the country is threatened, and to provide units for the\nregular army as and when required. As explicit in the Statement of objects\nand reasons of the \nTerritorial Army Act, 1948\n, the role of the Territorial\nArmy is:-\n\n(a) to provide a second line to and a source of reinforcement for the\nregular army;\n\n(b) to assist in internal defence duties in a national emergency;\n\n(c) to be responsible for anti aircraft and coastal defence; and\n\n(d) to give the youth of India an opportunity of training themselves to\ndefend their country.\n\n9. \nSection 4\n of the Act provides that the personnel of the\nTerritorial Army comprise of two classes–(a) officers and (b) enrolled\npersons. As per \nSection 6\n, any person who is a citizen of India may offer\nhimself for enrolment and may if he satisfies the prescribed conditions, be\nenrolled for such period and subject to such conditions as may be\nprescribed. According to \nSection 6A\n, every person employed under the\ngovernment in a public utility service who is between the age group of 20-\n40 years, subject to other provisions and rules, is liable, when so\nrequired, to perform service under the territorial army. \nSection 7\n provides\nfor liability for military service. \nSection 7A\n casts a duty on every\nemployer by whom a person who is required to perform military service under\n\nSection 7\n was employed, to re-instate him in his employment on termination\nof military service in an occupation and under conditions not less\nfavourable than those which would have been applicable to him at his\nemployment. As per \nSection 9\n, every officer while rendering service as\nsuch officer and every enrolled person when called out, or embodied, or\nattached to the regular army shall, subject to suitable adaptation, be\nsubject to the provisions of the \nArmy Act\n and the Rules or Regulations made\nthereunder. In terms of \nSection 14(2)(b)\n of Territorial Army Act, Central\nGovernment is empowered to make rules prescribing the manner in which, the\nperiod for which, and the conditions subject to which any person may be\nenrolled under the Act or may be required to perform compulsory service in\nthe Territorial Army.\n\n10. The terms and conditions of service of personnel belonging to\nthe regular Indian Army and the personnel belonging to Territorial Army are\ngoverned by two different Acts. The former is governed by \nArmy Act\n 1950\nwhile the latter is governed by the \nTerritorial Army Act\n 1948. It is\nimplicit in \nSection 9\n of the Territorial Army Act that when the person\nenrolled in the Territorial Army is not called out during that period of\ndisembodied state, he is not subjected to the provisions of the \nArmy Act\n.\nIt is thus clear from the statutory scheme that a fine distinction is made\nbetween regular army personnel and personnel enrolled in territorial army.\nFurther distinction has to be made between the Territorial Army personnel\nwho are embodied and those who are in disembodied state. It is only when\nthe Territorial Army personnel get embodied, which means that when they are\ncalled out or attached to any portion of the regular army for active duty,\nthat the provisions of \nArmy Act\n 1950 are applied to the Territorial Army\npersonnel. When the Territorial Army personnel are in a disembodied state\ni.e., when they are not called out or attached to any portion of the\nregular army for active duty, then the \nTerritorial Army Act\n 1948 governs\nthe service conditions and this is the statutory scheme.\n\n11. The only question falling for consideration is whether in the\nfacts and circumstances of the case, the appellant is entitled to family\npension and whether denial of family pension to the appellant is justified.\n It is the admitted position that late Sepoy Raj Singh was enrolled in\nthe territorial army on 17.05.1995 and he died on 04.08.2008 due to heart\nattack in his village. It is also admitted by both parties that Raj Singh\nhad been disembodied on 31.03.2008 and that Raj Singh died while he was in\ndisembodied state from the Territorial Army.\n\n12. Learned counsel for the appellant laid emphasis upon Regulation\n289 of the Pension Regulations for Army (Part I) 1961 Edn. to contend that\nmembers of the Territorial Army shall be governed by the same regulations\nas applicable to the army personnel. Pension Regulation 289 reads as\nunder:-\n\n“289. The grant of pensionary award to the members of the Territorial Army\nshall be governed by the same general regulations as applicable to the\ncorresponding personnel of the Army except where they are inconsistent with\nthe provisions of Regulations in this Chapter.”\n\n13. A plain reading of the aforesaid provision makes it clear that\nthe grant of pension award to personnel of the Territorial Army is governed\nby same general pension regulation as applicable to regular army personnel\nexcept wherever it is dealt with differently in the said regulations.\n\nTherefore, unless an exception has been carved out in the case of personnel\nof the Territorial Army, the Pension Regulations for the Army 1961 would\ngovern the field in the matter of grant of various pensionary awards. This\nis made further clear from paragraph 3 (ii) of Government of India,\nMinistry of Defence Circular No.68699/221/GSITA-3(a)/1131/B/D(GS-VI)\ndated 11th June 1985 which reads as under:-\n\n“3.(ii).Death-cum-retirement-Gratuity and ordinary Family Pension will be\nadmissible, as applicable to the Regular Army.”\n\nThis has also been further reiterated in the circulars dated 03.02.1998 and\n12.11.2008 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Defence which\nare made applicable to the Territorial Army amongst others.\n\n14. Plea urged by the appellant was that while the wife of a\nregular army soldier, who dies in harness is entitled to family pension\neven if the deceased soldier had not put in the minimum qualifying service\nto earn service pension, the same is denied to wife of a deceased\nTerritorial Army soldier on a specious plea that the deceased soldier was\nin disembodied state when the death took place. This according to the\nappellant is discriminatory. By elaborate reasoning, the tribunal held that\na regular army person and a person enrolled in the Territorial Army are\ngoverned by different set of terms and conditions of service. They are not\nsimilarly situated and therefore they do not form part of the same class in\nthe matter of grant of service benefits and hence, there cannot be a\nviolation of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India. We concur with the\nview taken by the tribunal. It is therefore not necessary for us to refer\nto number of judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant\nas those cases were determined in the light of facts and circumstances of\nthose cases.\n\n15. No doubt, with effect from 01.07.2008, new Pension Regulations\nfor the Army 2008 have come into operation superseding the earlier one. In\nSection 2-Ordinary Family Pension of the new Regulation of 2008, Regulation\n62 lays down that the regulations shall not apply to members of the\nTerritorial Army other than those who died while rendering embodied service\nor after retirement with pension under these regulations. Learned counsel\nfor the Union of India laid emphasis upon the Pension Regulations for the\nArmy 2008 to contend that, as Raj Singh died while in disembodied state,\nappellant-wife was not entitled to family pension. In the preface of the\nsaid regulations issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Defence\ndated 01.07.2008, it is specifically mentioned that it is applicable to\narmy personnel who are in service as on 01.07.2008. In the present case,\nit is an admitted position that the deceased-Raj Singh was disembodied on\n31.03.2008 much before the new regulations came into effect. Therefore, he\nwas not in service on 01.07.2008 and hence new regulations cannot be\npressed into service. The new regulations are applicable only to those who\nwere in service as on 01.07.2008 or thereafter. Therefore, the claim of the\nappellant cannot be tested on the new Pension Regulations for the Army\n2008.\n\n16. Having said that, we are of the view that the entitlement of\nthe appellant to family pension has to be examined in the light of the\nprovisions of the Pension Regulations for the Army 1961 read with\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Defence circulars dated 11.06.1985,\n03.02.1998 and lastly circular dated 12.11.2008. As discussed earlier, in\nterms of \nSection 9\n, every officer/ enrolled person when called out or\nembodied or attached to the regular army shall, subject to suitable\nadaptation, be subject to the provisions of the \nArmy Act\n 1950 and the rules\nand regulations made thereunder. When an enrolled person is in disembodied\nstate, he is not subject to the \nArmy Act\n and is not entitled to pay and\nallowances or other entitlement as also medical allied benefits. Also their\ndisembodiment period is not counted as a qualifying service even for\nservice pension. As per the existing rules, no family pension is payable\nto the legal heir of a territorial army personnel who died during\ndisembodied state and who has not put in pensionable service.\n\n17. As per the rules, no family pension is payable to the legal\nheir of a territorial army personnel who died during disembodied state and\nwho has not put in pensionable service. Contention of respondents that\nadmissibility of such a relief would be contrary to the rules in force has\nled to a patent anomaly. Such anomaly was pointed out by Major, Addl.\nOffr./TA-3, TA DTE, GS Branch in his inputs for VI Pay Commission dated\n09.03.2007 (Annexure P-8) thereby recommending to do the needful to render\nfair treatment to Territorial Army personnel. We deem it appropriate to\nreproduce it as under:-\n\n“GRANT OF FAMILY PENSION TO NoK OF TA PERS WHO THOUGH IN SERVICE BUT DIES\nDURING DISEMBODIED STATE.\n\n4. Anomaly is:-\n\n(i) Person ‘A’ is in embodied state for the last 10 years, he gets\ndisembodied today and dies tomorrow, in such case NoK is not being granted\nordinary family pensions.\n\n(ii) Person ‘B’ is in disembodied state for the last 10 years, he gets\nembodied today and dies tomorrow. In this case NoK is being granted\nordinary family pension.\n\nNote: Point to be noted is both indls are in service and have not been\ndischarged from service.\n\n18. In response to the above communication relied upon by the\nappellant, Mr. Balasubramanian, learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondents has drawn our attention to the comments on ‘General Staff\nBranch’ dated 09.03.2007 (Annexure R-1 series). After referring to the\naforesaid recommendation of Additional Officer/TA-3, TA Dte, GS Branch it\nwas observed as under:-\n\n“(ae) In view of the above case, though has been referred to me CGOA to\nissue instructions to PCDA (Allahabad) to entertain ordinary family\npension to NoK of pers dying during disembodied state. The same is still\nunder consideration with CGDA.\n\n(af) It is recommended that the issue be addressed in recommendations of\n6th \nCPC\n to remove the anomaly for which no orders to the effect exist.”\n\nEven though the above anomalies have been taken note of by the concerned\nauthorities, the respondents have not so far taken any decision to rectify\nthe anomalies to give fair treatment to the Territorial Army personnel by\ngranting family pension to ‘next of kin’ of Territorial Army personnel who\ndie while in disembodied state. Territorial Army personnel actually remain\non rolls till they are retired from service and as noticed earlier, they\nare liable to be called out for military service at any time. During\ndisembodiment, Territorial Army personnel wait in reserve. It was\ncontended by the learned counsel for the appellant that when gratuity and\nother benefits are paid to the territorial army personnel dying during\ndisembodied service as a death in harness, they should also be eligible for\nservice pension. Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention\nto Ministry of Defence Report (Declassified on 18.02.2016) of the Committee\nof Experts constituted for Reduction of Litigation, Review of Service &\nPension Matters 2015:-\n\n“Report Page 223, 8th line: …We also find that widows/families of TA\npersonnel dying in harness but during the period of ‘disembodiment,\n(demobilized state) are not granted Ordinary Family Pension. We feel that\nthis issue may be considered favourably since such pers remain on the\nstrength of the TA and also on the rolls of their unit while on disembodied\nstate. If the families of regular military pers who die due to non-service\nrelated causes or while on leave or while on furlough are entitled to\nOrdinary Family Pension, then by same logic even families of TA pers should\nnot be refused the same.”\n\nInspite of repeated recommendations, it is not known why steps are not\nbeing taken to remove the anomalies to pay family pension to ‘next of kin’\nof Territorial Army personnel who rendered long service in Territorial Army\nand died while in disembodied state. We hope that the Union of India\nconsiders the issue favourably to remove the anomalies to pay appropriate\nfamily pension to next of kin of Territorial Army personnel who die while\nin disembodied state by giving due weightage to their embodied service.\n\n19. On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that Raj Singh had\nunblemish service record and had rendered a total service of about twelve\nyears in Territorial Army (11 years and 289 days) including service in\noperational area. For quite sometime, the appellant has been pursuing the\nlitigation seeking family pension. Considering the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of the case and the plight of the appellant, in the interest\nof justice and in exercise of our power under \nArticle 142\n of the\nConstitution of India, we deem it appropriate to award ex-gratia grant of\nrupees ten lakhs payable to the appellant.\n\n20. The impugned order of the tribunal is accordingly modified with\nthe direction that the respondents shall pay an ex-gratia amount of rupees\nten lakhs to the appellant within a period of three months from today.\n\n21. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.\n\n …………………….CJI.\n\n (T.S. THAKUR)\n\n ……………………….J.\n (R. BANUMATHI)\nNew Delhi;\n\nMay 06, 2016",

But it was\nstrenuously canvassed before us by the learned counsel for the Union of\nIndia that, in the case of family pension to the family of deceased\npersonnel of the Territorial Army, the entitlement has to flow either from\nthe fact that the deceased soldier had put in minimum qualifying embodied\nservice of fifteen years, and thus had become entitled to service pension,\nin which case the family pension gets granted to the widow or other\neligible person(s) as per rules, or alternatively, the deceased ought to\nhave died in harness when he was in an embodied state i.e., while he was on\nactive duty having been called out or attached to any part of the regular\narmy. Conversely, it was argued that if the death had occurred when the\ndeceased was in a disembodied state, and if the deceased individual had not\nput in minimum period of qualifying service of fifteen years, then the\nentitlement to family pension arising out of death in harness would not\narise. In this regard the counsel for the Union of India drew our\nattention to Pension Regulations for the Army, Part-I (2008) which has\nsuperseded the Pension Regulations for the Army 1961 with effect from\n01.07.2008. Our attention was especially drawn to Section 2 titled\n‘Ordinary Family Pension’ Regulation 62, which inter alia lays down that,\nthe regulations shall not apply to the members of the Territorial Army\nother than those who die while rendering ‘embodied service’ or after\nretirement with pension under the said Regulations."
