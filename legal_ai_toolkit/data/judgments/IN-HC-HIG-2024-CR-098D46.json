Smt. Uma Kushwah, learned Counsel appearing for\ncomplainant is permitted to assist the prosecution in the matter.\n\nThis first bail application has been filed by applicant under\nSection 439\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for grant of bail in connection with\nCrime No.1155 of 2023, registered at Police Station Dabra, District Gwalior\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: MAHENDRA\n\nBARIK\n\nSigning time: 27-02-2024\n\n10:10:25 PM\n(M.P.) for offence punishable under\nSection 376\n,\n,\nof IPC. Applicant is\nin judicial custody since 29-12-2023.\n\nAs per the case of prosecution, victim aged around 19 years, submitted a\ntyped complaint on 29-12-2023 at 10:15 am with SHO, PS Dabra, District\nGwalior alleging rape against Hemant Parihar (applicant). It is stated in\ncomplaint that she and Hemant Parihar used to communicate on mobile phone.\nSome days before, she had stopped conversation with Hemant but Hemant\nused to call her. On 28-12-2023 around 10:00 in the night, she was at her home\nalong with her younger brothers and uncle. Her brother went outside with pet\ndog. Hemant entered her room and closed door. Hemant committed rape on\n\nher. Hemant pushed her. She sustained injury near her left eye. Hemant also\nslapped her. Hearing her shouts, her uncle and younger brothers came there,\nthen Hemant left her. She opened the door, Hemant fled away. Her uncle\ninformed her father on phone. Her parents had gone to Gwalior, therefore, she\ncould not report in the night. On such allegations, PS Dabra registered FIR at\nCrime No.1155 of 2023 for offence punishable under\nSections 376\n,\n,\nof\nIPC against applicant. Victim was forwarded for medico-legal examination.\nVictim informed the history of sexual violence to the Medical Officer that\naccused had come to her room around 10:00 pm. Accused forced her for\nhaving sexual relation. When she denied, accused forcefully had sexual\nintercourse with her. Suddenly, her relative came there and saw them in\nuncomfortable condition and caught them. No external injury was found on the\nperson of the victim. Statements of the victim under\nSections 161\nand\nof\nCrPC were recorded. Statements of other witnesses have also been recorded.\nApplicant was arrested on 29-12-2023, he is in custody ever since.

Applicant has been falsely implicated in the matter\nunder the pressure of family members of the victim. Leaned Counsel further\nreferring to the site map and narration of history by the victim to Medical\nOfficer, submits that the allegation of forceful sexual assault is highly\nimprobable as younger brothers and uncle of the victim were present in the\nsame house although in different room. Learned Counsel further submits that\nthe applicant is aged 19 years. He is pursuing studies. He is a student of BA\nfirst year. There is no likelihood of his absconsion leaving his family, home and\nstudies. No further custodial interrogation of applicant is needed. There is no\nlikelihood of tampering with evidence as both the parties belong to same socio-\neconomic status. Trial would take time to conclude. Therefore, applicant may\nbe extended the benefit of bail.\n\nP e r contra, learned counsel for the State ably assisted by learned\nCounsel for the complainant opposes the bail application on the ground of\ngravity of alleged offence and submits that statements of victim on record make\nout a case of sexual assault against applicant. Learned Counsel for State further\ncites criminal history of two cases against the applicant.\n\nIn reply, learned Counsel for the applicant submits that other two cases\nrelate to minor offence.Applicant has been granted bail in two cases which are\npending for trial and he has never been convicted.\n\nHeard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.\nConsidering the arguments advanced by both the parties and overall\ncircumstances of the case, regard being had to the young age of the applicant,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: MAHENDRA\n\nBARIK\n\nSigning time: 27-02-2024\n\n10:10:25 PM\nbut without commenting on merits of the case, this Court is inclined to release\nthe applicant on bail.
