  "text": "[Cites \n63\n, Cited by \n0\n]\n\nMadras High Court\n\nM.Balaiya vs The Commissioner on 5 March, 2018\n\nAuthor: \nS.M.Subramaniam\n\nBench: \nS.M.Subramaniam\n\n \n\n \n\nBEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT \nDATED: 05.03.2018 \nCORAM \nTHE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE S.M.SUBRAMANIAM \nW.P.(MD) No.16398 of 2012 \n\nM.Balaiya ... Petitioner\n\nVs.\n\n1.The Commissioner \n Municipal Administration,\n Ezhilagam, Chepauk, \n Chennai- 5.\n\n2.The Commissioner, \n Kambam Municipality, \n Kambam, Theni District. ... Respondents\n\nPRAYER: Writ Petition filed under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India\nfor issuance of Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to regularise the\npetitioner's service from the year 1999 and consequently give time scale of\npay from the year 2002 and to confer all the salary and pensionary benefits\nby considering the petitioner's representation dated 31.10.2012 within the\nperiod to be stipulated by this Court.\n\n!For Petitioner : Mr.A.Haja Mohideen\n^For R1 : Mr.M.Muthu\n Additional Government Pleader\n\n For R2 : Mr.M.Alagathevan\n \n\n:ORDER \n\n The relief sought for in this writ petition is for a direction to\ndirect the respondents to regularize the service of the writ petitioner from\nthe year 1999 and consequently grant time scale of pay with effect from 2002\nonwards. \n\n 2. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitioner\nstates that the writ petitioner was initially appointed as Sweeper in the\nsecond respondent municipality on daily wage basis. The petitioner is\nallowed to continue in service for a considerable length of time and\ntherefore the service of the petitioner ought to have been regularized by the\nrespondent on completion of 10 years of service.\n\n 3. At the out set, the learned counsel is of an opinion that the\nGovernment issued various orders granting the benefit of regularization to\nthe similarly placed persons on completion of 10 years of service and\ntherefore the same benefit has to be extended to the petitioner also. This\napart, the petitioner states that large number of similarly placed last grade\nservants, who served on daily wage basis for years together were already\nregularized and on this ground, the writ petitioner alone cannot be\ndiscriminated and the same benefit has to be granted to the petitioner also.\nHowever, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner is unable to\nsubstantiate that the initial appointment of the writ petitioner was in\naccordance with the regular recruitment rules in force.\n\n 4. The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing on behalf of the\nrespondents states that the initial appointment of the writ petitioner was\nirregular and not in accordance with the recruitment rules in force. The\nwrit petitioner was appointed on daily wage basis and therefore, the writ\npetitioner cannot claim any of the benefit of regularization or permanent\nabsorption merely on the ground of length of service rendered. The daily\nwage employees are liable to be terminated at any point of time without any\nnotice. Thus, the permanent absorption earlier granted, cannot be granted by\nthe Government in view of the subsequent development and the subsequent \njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in this regard.\n\n 5. This Court is of an opinion that all appointments to the public post\nare to be done only through open competitive process and by adhering to the\nrecruitment rules in force. Equal opportunity for public employment is a\nConstitutional mandate. The equality clause enshrined in the Constitution\ncannot be violated by the competent authorities while undertaking the process\nof selection. It is not as if engaging a person on daily wage basis and\nholding such a person in continuous service for a considerable time and\ntherefore grant regularization or permanent absorption. Such a practice was\nabsolutely condemned by the Hon'ble Apex Court of India. Such a practice will\nlead to deprivation of the meritorious candidates to secure public employment\nthrough open competitive process. Such appointments made in violation of\nRules are to be treated as back door entries into the public service. The\npersons who had entered into Government service through back door should go \nout through the door by which he/she got into such service. There cannot be\nany leniency or misplaced sympathy by the Constitutional Courts, which shows \nthat the Courts are bound to consider that such misplaced sympathy will\nresult in violation of the constitutional rights of the teeming millions of\npeople, who are waiting for public employment through open competitive\nprocess.\n\n 6. After all, millions of youth of this great nation are burning their\nmidnight lamp and working hard to secure public employment. The plight of\nsuch young minds will be in trouble and thus young people will get\nfrustration from and out of the system of back door entries. Thus the Courts\ncan never encourage such entries into public service. The back door entries\nwould cause serious social implication in respect of providing equal\nopportunity to all the citizens. First of all, the Rule of reservation is\nviolated. The public administration will lose the meritorious candidates for\nthe purpose of serving the public efficiently.\n\n 7. These adverse consequences of granting regularization or permanent\nabsorption in respect of the employees, who are not appointed under the\nrecruitment Rules in force is certainly a drastic step and therefore this\nCourt has to come to the conclusion that such appointments made by the \ncompetent authorities are fraud and the constitutional Courts can never\nencourage such practices.\n\n \n8. This Court also had elaborately discussed the matter, considering\nall the legal principles settled by the Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the case of \nThe Secretary, State of Karnataka and\nothers .vs. Umadevi\n(3) and others reported in (2006) 4 Supreme Court Cases 1,\nin W.P.No.28633 to 28646 of 2014 on 12.12.2017 and those discussions are \nextracted hereunder for better appreciation of the present writ petition\nalso:\n\n \n27. Considering the arguments advanced both by the learned counsel for\nthe petitioners as well as the learned counsel for the respondents, this\nCourt has to first consider the factual matrix involved in these writ\npetitions on hand. The writ petitioners, undoubtedly, were appointed as\ndaily wage employees in the year 2003 and they are continued in service for\nmore than ten years, is the claim set out in these writ petitions. However,\npursuant to the Judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India in the case of \nThe State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi\n, reported in\n(2006) 4 SCC 1 [herein after referred to as ?\nUmadevi\n Case?], one time benefit\nwas granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Paragraph (53) of the\nJudgment.\n\n \n28. Even before \nthe said judgment\n, the State of Tamil Nadu issued\nG.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F) Department, dated \n28.02.2006. As per the said Government Order, the temporary employees who \nhave completed ten years of service as on the date of the Government Order\ncan be regularised. Even prior to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India, the Government issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006, granting the benefit of one time\nregularization in respect of the temporary employees who have completed ten\nyears of service as on 28.02.2006. Thus, the State was extending the benefit\nof regularization or permanent absorption to the temporary/daily rated\nemployees who have completed ten years of service as on 28.02.2006.\n\n \n29. Pursuant to the said Government order, large number of temporary\nemployees were conferred with the benefit of regularization and based on\nthat, the writ petitioner also raised his claim for regularization. However,\nafter the Constitution Bench judgment rendered in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?, the State\nGovernment issued G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Department, \ndated 27.06.2013. In the above said G.O.Ms.No.74, the Government have \nimposed certain conditions and those conditions are akin to that of the\nrecruitment rules in force. The very idea of issuing G.O.Ms.No.74, is to\nprovide certain restricted concession to the temporary employees who were\notherwise appointed by following the recruitment rules in force. Therefore,\nthe prospectus of the large number of employees who have served on daily wage\nbasis are prevented from getting their regularization. In other words, the\nsaid G.O.Ms.No.74 prescribes certain conditions and restrictions for\nregularization and for granting permanent absorption. Thus, the persons who\nare eligible to be regularized under G.O.Ms.No.22, are prevented from getting\nthe benefit from and out of the said Government order and G.O.Ms.No.74,\nimposes certain restrictions.\n\n 30. Thus, the learned counsel brought to the notice of this Court that\nin the similar circumstances, the learned Single Judge of this Court dealt\nwith the issues in W.P.No.29346 of 2014 & etc.,batch and delivered a judgment\non 22.09.2017, setting aside the said G.O.Ms.No.74, in respect of extending\nthe same with retrospective effect. In other words, the implementation of\nthe Government orders was restricted only prospectively and accordingly, the\nrelief of regularization was granted to those writ petitioners.\n\n \n31. The learned Additional Government Pleader brought to the notice of\nthis Court that the State preferred Writ Appeals in W.A.Sr.No.89134/17 in\nW.P.29346/14, W.A.Sr.No.89136/17 in W.P.No. 7594/14, W.A.Sr. No.89142/17 in \nW.P.No.15668/14, W.A.Sr.No.89143/17 in W.P. No.13545/14,W.A.Sr.No. 89138/17 \nin W.P.No.29212/14 on 13.11.2017, against \nthe said judgment\n and the same is \npending.\n\n 32. Thus, this Court has to consider the issues independently and based\non the judgments of the Apex Court of India in the matter of regularization\nand permanent absorption. However, the learned Additional Government Pleader\nbrought to the notice of this Court that the Hon'ble Division Bench of this\nCourt passed an order in the batch of Writ Appeals in W.A.No.2911 of 2012 and\netc., batch on 10.07.2014, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench has considered\nthe terms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 and passed an order stating \nthat the services shall not be disturbed in the light of the Government Order\npassed in G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department dated \n27.06.2013 as well as the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nin Civil Appeal Nos.2726-2729 of 2014 with Nos.2730-31 of 2014.\n\n 33. The Additional Government Pleader is of the opinion that the terms\nand conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 had already been taken note of by the \nHon'ble Division Bench and the entire Government Order was upheld and the\ndirection was issued to pass orders in the light of the G.O.Ms.No.74 and\ntherefore, the judgment delivered by the learned Single Judge, need not be\nrelied upon and more so, the State also preferred writ appeals against the\nsaid orders.\n\n 34. Under these circumstances, this Court has to consider the issues\nindependently based on the judgments of the Apex Court of India.\n\n \n35. The authoritative judgment in the subject of regularization and\npermanent absorption is the judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?. All other subsequent judgments \ncited by the respective counsels are by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nSupreme Court of India. Thus, the binding nature of the judgments rendered\nin respect of other cases has to be cogently read and harmoniously\ninterpreted based on the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n 36. Before considering the subject of regularization and permanent\nabsorption, this Court has to consider the interpretation of the judgments on\n?binding nature? or ?binding precedent? . \nIn view of the fact that the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner has cited number of judgments, which were\npassed subsequent to the Constitution Bench judgment, stating that \nParagraph\n(53) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? has been interpreted in different ways and under\ndifferent circumstances and the present case is also to be considered and a\ndirection to be issued for regularization. In view of the fact that large\nnumber of judgments are cited before this Court in the matter of\nregularization and permanent absorption, now, this Court has to first decide\nwhat all are the judgments which all are having a ?binding precedent? and on\nthis reason, this Court has to consider very interpretation of the concept\nregarding ?binding precedent?.\n \nIn respect of judgments in relation to the\ninterpretation of ?binding precedent?, this Court is inclined to consider the\nvery recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n, reported in JT 2017\n(10) SC 450. It is pertinent to note that it is a judgment by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India headed by His\nLordship, Hon'ble Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra.CJI,. The Hon'ble\nChief Justice of India delivered this judgment and it is relevant to quote\nparagraphs (15 to 26):\n\n?15. The aforesaid analysis in Santosh Devi (supra) may prima facie show that\nthe two-Judge Bench has distinguished the observation made in Sarla Verma?s \ncase but on a studied scrutiny, it becomes clear that it has really expressed\na different view than what has been laid down in Sarla Verma (supra). If we\npermit ourselves to say so, the different view has been expressed in a\ndistinctive tone, for the two-Judge Bench had stated that it was extremely\ndifficult to fathom any rationale for the observations made in para 24 of the\njudgment in Sarla Verma?s case in respect of self-employed or a person on\nfixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc. This is a clear\ndisagreement with the earlier view, and we have no hesitation in saying that\nit is absolutely impermissible keeping in view the concept of binding\nprecedents.\n\n16. Presently, we may refer to certain decisions which deal with the concept\nof binding precedent.\n\n17. \nIn \nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n alias Kalika Singh and others [JT (2003)\n(4) SC 489], it has been held:-?10. ? an earlier decision may seem to be\nincorrect to a Bench of a coordinate jurisdiction considering the question\nlater, on the ground that a possible aspect of the matter was not considered\nor not raised before the court or more aspects should have been gone into by\nthe court deciding the matter earlier but it would not be a reason to say\nthat the decision was rendered per incuriam and liable to be ignored. The\nearlier judgment may seem to be not correct yet it will have the binding\neffect on the later Bench of coordinate jurisdiction. ??\n\n17.1.The Court has further ruled:-\n\n?10. ? Easy course of saying that earlier decision was rendered per incuriam\nis not permissible and the matter will have to be resolved only in two ways ?\neither to follow the earlier decision or refer the matter to a larger Bench\nto examine the issue, in case it is felt that earlier decision is not correct\non merits.?\n\n18. In G.L. Batra v. State of Haryana and others (2014) 13 SCC 759), the\nCourt has accepted the said principle on the basis of judgments of this Court\nrendered in Union of India v. Godfrey Philips India Ltd. (1985) 4 SCC 369),\nSundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija v. Collector, Thane, Maharashtra (1989) 3 SCC\n\n396)and Tribhovandas Purshottamdas Thakkar v. Ratilal Motilal Patel\n (AIR 1968\nSC 372).\n \nIt may be noted here that the Constitution Bench in \nMadras Bar\nAssociation v. Union of India and another\n [JT 2015(5)SC 33]has clearly stated\nthat the prior Constitution Bench judgment in \nUnion of India v. Madras Bar\nAssociation [JT\n 2010 (5) SC 553]is a binding precedent. Be it clarified, the\nissues that were put to rest in the earlier Constitution Bench judgment were\ntreated as precedents by latter Constitution Bench.\n\n19. \nIn this regard, we may refer to a passage from \nJaisri Sahu v. Rajdewan\nDubey\n (AIR 1962 SC 83):-\n\n?11. Law will be bereft of all its utility if it should be thrown into a\nstate of uncertainty by reason of conflicting decisions, and it is therefore\ndesirable that in case of difference of opinion, the question should be\nauthoritatively settled. It sometimes happens that an earlier decision given\nby a Bench is not brought to the notice of a Bench hearing the same question,\nand a contrary decision is given without reference to the earlier decision.\nThe question has also been discussed as to the correct procedure to be\nfollowed when two such conflicting decisions are placed before a later Bench.\nThe practice in the Patna High Court appears to be that in those cases, the\nearlier decision is followed and not the later. In England the practice is,\nas noticed in thejudgment in Seshamma v. Venkata Narasimharao that the \ndecision of a court of appeal is considered as a general rule to be binding\non it. There are exceptions to it, and one of them is thus stated in\nHalsbury?s Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 22, para 1687, pp. 799-800:\n\n?The court is not bound to follow a decision of its own if given per\nincuriam. A decision is given per incuriam when the court has acted in\nignorance of a previous decision of its own or of a Court of a co-ordinate\njurisdiction which covered the case before it, or when it has acted in\nignorance of a decision of the House of Lords. In the former case it must\ndecide which decision to follow, and in the latter it is bound by the\ndecision of the House of Lords.?In \nVirayya v. Venkata Subbayya\n it has been\nheld by the Andhra High Court that under the circumstances aforesaid the\nBench is free to adopt that view which is in accordance with justice and\nlegal principles after taking into consideration the views expressed in the\ntwo conflicting Benches, vide also the decision of the Nagpur High Court in\nBilimoria v. Central Bank of India. The better course would be for the Bench\nhearing the case to refer the matter to a Full Bench in view of the\nconflicting authorities without taking upon itself to decide whether it\nshould follow the one Bench decision or the other. We have no doubt that when\nsuch situations arise, the Bench hearing cases would refer the matter for the\ndecision of a Full Court.?\n\n20. Though the aforesaid was articulated in the context of the High Court,\nyet this Court has been following the same as is revealed from the\naforestated pronouncements including that of the Constitution Bench and,\ntherefore, we entirely agree with the said view because it is the precise\nwarrant of respecting a precedent which is the fundamental norm of judicial\ndiscipline. 21. \nIn the context, we may fruitfully note what has been stated\nin \nPradip Chandra Parija and others v. Pramod Chandra Patnaik and others\n [JT\n(2002) 5 SCC 23]. In the said case, the Constitution Bench was dealing with a\nsituation where the two-Judge Bench disagreeing with the three-Judge Bench\ndecision directed the matter to be placed before a larger Bench of five\nJudges of this Court. In that scenario, the Constitution Bench stated:-\n\n?6. ? In our view, judicial discipline and propriety demands that a Bench of\ntwo learned Judges should follow a decision of a Bench of three learned\nJudges. But if a Bench of two learned Judges concludes that an earlier\njudgment of three learned Judges is so very incorrect that in no\ncircumstances can it be followed, the proper course for it to adopt is to\nrefer the matter before it to a Bench of three learned Judges setting out, as\nhas been done here, the reasons why it could not agree with the earlier\njudgment. ?22. \nIn \nChandra Prakash and others v. State of U.P. and another\n [JT\n(2002) (3) SC 493], another Constitution Bench dealing with the concept of\nprecedents stated thus:-\n\n?22. ? The doctrine of binding precedent is of utmost importance in the\nadministration of our judicial system. It promotes certainty and consistency\nin judicial decisions. Judicial consistency promotes confidence in the\nsystem, therefore, there is this need for consistency in the enunciation of\nlegal principles in the decisions of this Court. It is in the above context,\nthis Court in the case of Raghubir Singh (1989) 2 SCC 754)held that a\npronouncement of law by a Division Bench of this Court is binding on a\nDivision Bench of the same or smaller number of Judges. ?\n\n23. Be it noted, Chandra Prakash concurred with the view expressed in\nRaghubir Singh and Pradip Chandra Parija.24. \nIn \nSandhya Educational Society \nand another v. Union of India and others\n (2014) 7 SCC 701), it has been\nobserved that judicial decorum and discipline is paramount and, therefore, a\ncoordinate Bench has to respect the judgments and orders passed by another \ncoordinate Bench.\n \nIn \nRattiram and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n (2012) 4\nSCC 516), the Court dwelt upon the issue what would be the consequent effect\nof the latter decision which had been rendered without noticing the earlier\ndecisions.\n \nThe Court noted the observations in Raghubir Singh (supra) and\nreproduced a passage from \nIndian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Municipal\nCorporation\n (1995) 4 SCC 96)which is to the following effect:-\n\n?8. ? The Division Bench of the High Court in \nMunicipal Corpn., Indore v.\nRatnaprabha Dhanda\n was clearly in error in taking the view that the decision\nof this Court in Ratnaprabha was not binding on it. In doing so, the Division\nBench of the High Court did something which even a later coequal Bench of\nthis Court did not and could not do. ?\n\n25. It also stated what has been expressed in Raghubir Singh (supra) by R.S.\nPathak, C.J. It is as follows:-\n\n?28. We are of opinion that a pronouncement of law by a Division Bench of\nthis Court is binding on a Division Bench of the same or a smaller number of\nJudges, and in order that such decision be binding, it is not necessary that\nit should be a decision rendered by the Full Court or a Constitution Bench of\nthe Court. ??\n\n26. In Rajesh (supra) the three-Judge Bench had delivered the judgment on\n12.04.2013. The purpose of stating the date is that it has been delivered\nafter the pronouncement made in Reshma Kumari?s case. On a perusal of the \ndecision in Rajesh (supra), we find that an attempt has been made to explain\nwhat the two- Judge Bench had stated in Santosh Devi (supra). The relevant\npassages read as follows:-\n\n?8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually intended to follow the\nprinciple in the case of salaried persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case\nand to make it applicable also to the self-employed and persons on fixed\nwages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those groups is not\n30% always; it will also have a reference to the age. In other words, in the\ncase of self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the deceased\nvictim was below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual\nincome of the deceased while computing future prospects. Needless to say that\nthe actual income should be income after paying the tax, if any. Addition\nshould be 30% in case the deceased was in the age group of 40 to 50 years.\n\n9. In Sarla Verma case, it has been stated that in the case of those above 50\nyears, there shall be no addition. Having regard to the fact that in the case\nof those self-employed or on fixed wages, where there is normally no age of\nsuperannuation, we are of the view that it will only be just and equitable to\nprovide an addition of 15% in the case where the victim is between the age\ngroup of 50 to 60 years so as to make the compensation just, equitable, fair\nand reasonable. There shall normally be no addition thereafter.?\n\n \n37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, while\ndealing with the cases of accident claims, has elaborately discussed about\nthe ?binding precedent?. The case in relation to the Motor Accident Claims,\nthe case of ?Sarla Verma? was being followed by all the Courts across the\nCountry for the purpose of awarding compensation. When the question arosed \nthat the ?binding nature? of the said case of ?Sarla Verma? delivered by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Constitution Bench headed by the Hon'ble\nChief Justice of India held that the principles laid down in the case of\n?\nVirayya v. Venkata Subbayya\n?\n \n, it has been held by the Andhra Pradesh High \nCourt that under the circumstances aforesaid the Bench is free to adopt that\nview which is in accordance with justice and legal principles after taking\ninto consideration the views expressed in the two conflicting Benches, it is\nfurther held that in the case of \nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n alias Kalika\nSingh and others, reported in [JT (2003) 4 SC 489], held that the earlier\njudgment may seem to be not correct yet it will have the binding effect on\nthe later Bench of coordinate jurisdiction.\n \nTheir Lordships rendered the\ncase of \nChandra Prakash and others v. State of U.P. and another\n, reported in\n[JT 2002 (3) SC 493], held that the doctrine of binding precedent is of\nutmost importance in the administration of our judicial system. It promotes\ncertainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial consistency\npromotes confidence in the system, therefore, there is this need for\nconsistency in the enunciation of legal principles in the decisions of this\nCourt.\n\n 38. By enumerating the legal principle in this regard, the Apex Court\nof India held that the judgment by the Larger Bench of the Courts are to be\ntreated as ?binding precedent?, while deciding the legal principles involved\nin the particular case.\n\n 39. Another Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nthe case of Padma Sundara Rao and Others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others, \nreported in (2002) 3 SCC 533, and the relevant paragraph (9) of the Judgment\nis extracted hereunder:\n\n?9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to\nhow the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on\nwhich reliance is placed. There is always peril in treating the words of a\nspeech or judgment as though they are words in a legislative enactment, and\nit is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of\nthe facts of a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v. British\nRailways Board [(1972) 2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC 877 (HL) [Sub nom British Railways \nBoard v. Herrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)]] . Circumstantial flexibility,\none additional or different fact may make a world of difference between\nconclusions in two cases.?\n\n 40. \nIn view of the legal principle settled in the matter of ?binding\nprecedent?, now, this Court is bound by the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the ?\nUmadevi\n\nCase?. Admittedly, there is no other subsequent Constitution Bench judgment\nin respect of the subject of regularization and permanent absorption.\n \nThe\nlast judgment rendered by the Constitution Bench in the subject matter is\n?\nUmadevi\n Case?.\n \nThus, the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench\nin ?\nUmadevi\n Case? are of ?binding precedent? or to be followed as ?binding\nprecedent?. Thus, the facts and circumstances of the present writ petition\nhas to be considered only in the light of the principles \nlaid down by\n the\nConstitution Bench. All other judgments subsequently passed by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India may have certain distinctions far and against.\n\nHowever, these judgments are to be interpreted only based on the facts and\ncircumstances prevailing in that particular case and therefore, this Court\ncannot consider those judgments delivered on a particular facts in relation\nto that particular case. However, the legal principles are to be considered\nin relation to the facts and circumstances of the present case on hand.\n\n \n41. Let us look into the basic principles enunciated by the\nConstitution Bench in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption.\n\nParagraph (5) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? is extracted hereunder:\n\n?5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions which could not be\nsaid to be consistent with the constitutional scheme of public employment.\nSuch directions are issued presumably on the basis of equitable\nconsiderations or individualisation of justice. The question arises, equity\nto whom? Equity for the handful of people who have approached the court with\na claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this country seeking\nemployment and seeking a fair opportunity for competing for employment? When \none side of the coin is considered, the other side of the coin has also to be\nconsidered and the way open to any court of law or justice, is to adhere to\nthe law as \nlaid down by\n the Constitution and not to make directions, which at\ntimes, even if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme, certainly\ntend to water down the constitutional requirements. It is this conflict that\nis reflected in these cases referred to the Constitution Bench?\n\n \n42. This Court wants to look into the very findings made by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the above said paragraph (5), the Apex Court has\nconceded that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had also on occasions,\nissued directions, which could not be said to be consistent with the\nConstitutional schemes of public employment. Such directions are issued\npresumably on the basis of equitable considerations or individualisation of\njustice. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India raised a question that equity to\nwhom? Equity for the handful of people who have approached the Court with the\nclaim, or equity for the teeming millions of this Country seeking employment\nand seeking a fair opportunity for competing for employment? When one side of\nthe coin is considered, the other side of the coin has also to be considered\nand the way open to any Court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law as\n\nlaid down by\n the Constitution and not to make directions, which at times,\neven if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme, certainly tend to\nwater down the constitutional requirements. It is this Conflict that\nreflected in these cases referred to the Constitution Bench.\n\n \n43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong concern recorded by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India. The concern raised by the Constitution Bench\nis that by granting relief to a handful of people, the large sector of\nmeritorious youth of this great nation cannot be deprived of their\nconstitutional rights. Under this pretext, the Constitution Bench commenced\nits consideration in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?. Thus, the very enumeration in the above\nparagraph is crystal clear that the Constitution Bench has laid down the\nprinciple in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption and the\nidea of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to stop the practice of\nappointing employees, through back door on extraneous consideration by \nshowing favoritism and nepotism.\n\n \n44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n?10. When these matters came up before a Bench of two Judges, the learned \nJudges referred the cases to a Bench of three Judges. The order of reference\nis reported in \nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (1) [(2004) 7 SCC 132 :\n\n2004 SCC (L&S) 935 : (2003) 9 Scale 187] . This Court noticed that in the\nmatter of regularisation of ad hoc employees, there were conflicting\ndecisions by three-Judge Benches of this Court and by two-Judge Benches and \nhence the question required to be considered by a larger Bench. When the\nmatters came up before a three-Judge Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the\nmatter required consideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the conflict\nand in the light of the arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor General.\nThe order of reference is reported in \nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(2) [(2006) 4 SCC 44 : (2003) 10 Scale 388] . It appears to be proper to\nquote that order of reference at this stage. It reads: (SCC p. 45, paras 1-5)\n?1.\n \nApart from the conflicting opinions between the three-Judge Bench\ndecisions in \nAshwani Kumar v. State of Bihar\n [(1997) 2 SCC 1 : 1997 SCC (L&S) \n465 : 1996 Supp (10) SCR 120] , State of Haryana v. Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC\n118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21 ATC 403 : (1992) 3 SCR 826] and Dharwad \nDistt.\n PWD Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka [(1990) \n2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] on the \none hand and State of H.P. v. Suresh Kumar Verma [(1996) 7 SCC 562 : 1996 SCC \n(L&S) 645 : (1996) 33 ATC 336 : AIR 1996 SC 1565 : (1996) 1 SCR 972] , State \nof Punjab v. Surinder Kumar [(1992) 1 SCC 489 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 345 : (1992) \n19 ATC 500 : AIR 1992 SC 1593 : 1991 Supp (3) SCR 553] and B.N. Nagarajan v. \n\nState of Karnataka [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] \non the other, which have been brought out in one of the judgments under\nappeal of the Karnataka High Court in \nState of Karnataka v. H. Ganesh Rao\n\n[(2001) 4 Kant LJ 466 (DB)] , decided on 1-6-2001 the learned Additional\nSolicitor General urged that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant to\n\nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\n and \n335\n of the Constitution and, therefore, these\ncases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges\n(Constitution Bench).\n\n2. On the other hand, Mr M.C. Bhandare, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for\nthe employees urged that such a scheme for regularisation is consistent with\nthe provisions of \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n of the Constitution.\n\n3. Mr V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing in CCs Nos. 109-498 of \n2003, has filed the GO dated 19-7-2002 and submitted that the orders have\nalready been implemented. \n\n4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion between the three-\nJudge Bench decisions of this Court, we are of the view that these cases are\nrequired to be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges.\n\n5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for\nappropriate orders.?\n\nWe are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue here. We have to lay\ndown the law. We have to approach the question as a constitutional court\nshould.?\n\n 45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates that there were\nconflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of this Court and by two-Judge\nBenches of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and therefore, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India has considered that the question required to be\nconsidered by a larger Bench. It is further observed that when the matters\ncame up before a three-Judge Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter\nrequired consideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the conflict and in\nthe light of the arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor General. In\nthe reference made by the Hon'ble three-Judge Bench itself decided that the\nscheme for regularisation is repugnant to \nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\n and \n335\n of\nthe Constitution and, therefore, these cases are required to be heard by a\nBench of five learned Judges(Constitution Bench).\n\n 46. \nIn paragraph (\n11) of the ?Umadevi\n Case?, it is stated that in\naddition to the equality clause represented by \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution, \nArticle 16\n has specifically provided for equality of\nopportunity in matters of public employment. Buttressing these fundamental\nrights, \nArticle 309\n provides that subject to the provisions of the\nConstitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate the recruitment and\nconditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in\nconnection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.\n\n 47. In view of the interpretation placed on \nArticle 12\n of the\nConstitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also govern the\ninstrumentalities that come within the purview of \nArticle 12\n of the\nConstitution. With a view to make the procedure for selection fair, the\nConstitution by \nArticle 315\n has also created a Public Service Commission for\nthe Union and the Public Service Commissions for the States. \nArticle 320\n\ndeals with the functions of the Public Service Commissions and mandates\nconsultation with the Commission on all matters relating to methods of\nrecruitment to civil services and for civil posts and other related matters.\nAs a part of the affirmative action recognised by \nArticle 16\n of the\nConstitution, \nArticle 335\n provides for special consideration in the matter of\nclaims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for \nemployment. \n\n \n48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the?Umadevi\n Case? reads as follows:\n\n?12. In spite of this scheme, there may be occasions when the sovereign State\nor its instrumentalities will have to employ persons, in posts which are\ntemporary, on daily wages, as additional hands or taking them in without\nfollowing the required procedure, to discharge the duties in respect of the\nposts that are sanctioned and that are required to be filled in terms of the\nrelevant procedure established by the Constitution or for work in temporary\nposts or projects that are not needed permanently. This right of the Union or\nof the State Government cannot but be recognised and there is nothing in the\nConstitution which prohibits such engaging of persons temporarily or on daily\nwages, to meet the needs of the situation. But the fact that such engagements\nare resorted to, cannot be used to defeat the very scheme of public\nemployment. Nor can a court say that the Union or the State Governments do \nnot have the right to engage persons in various capacities for a duration or\nuntil the work in a particular project is completed. Once this right of the\nGovernment is recognised and the mandate of the constitutional requirement\nfor public employment is respected, there cannot be much difficulty in coming\nto the conclusion that it is ordinarily not proper for the Courts whether\nacting under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution or under \nArticle 32\n of the\nConstitution, to direct absorption in permanent employment of those who have\nbeen engaged without following a due process of selection as envisaged by the\nconstitutional scheme.?\n\n \n49. The spirit of \nParagraph (12) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment is that\nthe temporary engagements like daily wage appointments, consolidated pay \nappointments and temporary appointments and engagements are resorted to, \ncannot be used to defeat the very scheme of public employment. Nor can a\nCourt say that the Union or the State Governments do not have the right to\nengage persons in various capacities for a duration or until the work in a\nparticular project is completed. Once this right of the Government is\nrecognised and the mandate of the constitutional requirement for public\nemployment is respected, there cannot be much difficulty in coming to the\nconclusion that it is ordinarily not proper for the Courts, whether acting\nunder \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution or under \nArticle 32\n of the\nConstitution, to direct absorption in permanent employment of those who have\nbeen engaged without following a due process of selection as envisaged by the\nconstitutional scheme. Thus, it is made clear by the Constitutional Bench\nthat regular recruitment rules in force, followed scrupulously by the\ncompetent authorities and engagements on temporary basis cannot be resorted \nor the same cannot lead to permanent absorption or regularization. Further,\nit is stated that the Government is entitled to appoint the persons on daily\nwages/consolidated pay/temporary basis, if a Government is of the opinion\nthat a project has to be implemented or a special works to be carried out,\nthen they are at liberty to do so, by engaging the temporary employees. Such\nbeing the concept accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, no doubt, a\nmere appointment on temporary/daily wage basis cannot constitute a right for\nthe employees to claim regularization or permanent absorption.\n\n \n50. \nFurther, Paragraph (13) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n?13. What is sought to be pitted against this approach, is the so-called\nequity arising out of giving of temporary employment or engagement on daily\nwages and the continuance of such persons in the engaged work for a certain\nlength of time. Such considerations can have only a limited role to play,\nwhen every qualified citizen has a right to apply for appointment, the\nadoption of the concept of rule of law and the scheme of the Constitution for\nappointment to posts. It cannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of\nthe courts to ignore, encourage or approve appointments made or engagements \ngiven outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders based on such\nsentiments or approach would result in perpetuating illegalities and in the\njettisoning of the scheme of public employment adopted by us while adopting\nthe Constitution. The approving of such acts also results in depriving many\nof their opportunity to compete for public employment. We have, therefore, to\nconsider the question objectively and based on the constitutional and\nstatutory provisions. \nIn this context, we have also to bear in mind the\nexposition of law by a Constitution Bench in \nState of Punjab v. Jagdip Singh\n\n[(1964) 4 SCR 964 : AIR 1964 SC 521] . It was held therein: (SCR pp. 971-72)\n?In our opinion where a government servant has no right to a post or to a\nparticular status, though an authority under the Government acting beyond its\ncompetence had purported to give that person a status which it was not\nentitled to give he will not in law be deemed to have been validly appointed\nto the post or given the particular status.?\n\n 51. This Court cannot omit the powerful statement made by the\nConstitution Bench in respect of providing equal opportunity and in respect\nof implementing the equality clause enshrined under \nArticle 14\n \n& 16\n of the\nConstitution. In the above said paragraph (13), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia has emphasized that it cannot also be forgotten that it is not the role\nof the Courts to ignore, encourage or approve appointments made or\nengagements given outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders based\non such sentiments or approach would result in perpetuating illegalities and\nin the jettisoning of the scheme of public employment adopted by us, while\nadopting the Constitution. We, the people of India, while adopting the\nConstitution.\n\n \n52. The approving of such acts also results in depriving many of their\nopportunity to compete for public employment. \nThe Constitution Bench of\n?Umadevi\n Case?, considered the proposition of law \nlaid down by\n the previous\nConstitution Bench in the case of \nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, reported\nin [AIR (1964) SC 521].\n \nThe earlier Constitution Bench in the case of \nState\nof Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, held that where a Government Servant has no right\nto a post or to a particular status, though an authority under the Government\nacting beyond its competence had purported to give that person a status which\nit was not entitled to give he will not in law be deemed to have been validly\nappointed to the post or given the particular status.\n\n 53. \nIn paragraph (\n14) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India has elaborately discussed about various orders of the\nCourts either interim orders or final orders which were brought to the notice\nof the Constitution Bench. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India came to the\nconclusion that those orders more or less was the issue of directions for\ncontinuation or absorption without referring to the legal position obtaining.\nIt was brought to the notice of this Court that chaos has been created by\nsuch orders without reference to the legal principles and it is time that\nthis Court settled the law once and for all so that in case the Court finds\nthat such orders should not be made, the Courts, especially, the High Courts\nwould be precluded from issuing such directions or passing such orders.\n\n 54. The very arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the State of\nKarnataka is that a chaos was created on account of various contradicting\norders passed by the High Courts in the matter of regularization or permanent\nabsorption in order to settle the legal principles. The learned counsel\nurged the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to take note of the fact that there\nis a chaos prevailing in respect of the regularization and permanent\nabsorption of the temporary/daily wages employees and brought to the notice\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the High Courts would be precluded\nfrom issuing any such directions or passing such orders in contrary to the\nlegal principles in the matters of regularization or permanent absorption or\nappointment. The observation made in this regard is that bypassing of the\nConstitutional scheme cannot be perpetuated by the passing of orders without\ndealing with and deciding the validity of such orders on the touchstone of\nConstitutionality.\n\n \n55. Let us come to paragraph (\n20) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment which \nis extracted hereunder:\n\n \n?20. The decision in Dharwad Distt. \nPWD Literate Daily Wage Employees \nAssn. v. State of Karnataka\n [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990)\n12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] dealt with a scheme framed by the State of\nKarnataka, though at the instance of the Court. The scheme was essentially\nrelating to the application of the concept of equal pay for equal work but it\nalso provided for making permanent, or what it called regularisation, without\nkeeping the distinction in mind, of employees who had been appointed ad hoc,\ncasually, temporarily or on daily-wage basis. In other words, employees who\nhad been appointed without following the procedure established by law for\nsuch appointments. This Court, at the threshold, stated that it should\nindividualise justice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is not\npossible to accept the statement, unqualified as it appears to be. This Court\nis not only the constitutional court, it is also the highest court in the\ncountry, the final court of appeal. By virtue of \nArticle 141\n of the\nConstitution, what this Court lays down is the law of the land. Its decisions\nare binding on all the courts. Its main role is to interpret the\nconstitutional and other statutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\nphilosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto ourselves a system of\ngovernance by rule of law. The role of the Supreme Court is to render justice\naccording to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme Court is expected to\ndecide questions of law for the country and not to decide individual cases\nwithout reference to such principles of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing\norders not consistent with its own decisions on law, is bound to send out\nconfusing signals and usher in judicial chaos. Its role, therefore, is really\nto interpret the law and decide cases coming before it, according to law.\n\nOrders which are inconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the\ncourt in the selfsame judgment not only create confusion but also tend to\nusher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that equity tends to vary\nwith the Chancellor's foot.?\n\n \n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad Distt. \nPWD Literate Daily Wage\nEmployees Assn. Vs. State of Karnataka\n, reported in (1990) 2 SCC 396, was \nconsidered in the above paragraph. It is observed that the role of the Court\nto interpret the law and decide cases coming before it, according to law.\nOrders which are inconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the\nCourt in the self same judgment not only create confusion but also tend to\nusher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that equity tends to vary\nwith the Chancellor's foot.\n\n 57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has\naccepted the decision, the question of law for the country and not to decide\nindividual cases without reference to such principles of law. Consistency is\na virtue. Passing orders not consistent with its own decisions on law, is\nbound to send out confusing signals and result in judicial chaos. The\nobservation made in this regard are certainly to be followed by all the\nCourts across the Country.\n\n 58. \nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the Apex Court referred the\nspirit of \nKesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala\n, reported in (1973) 4 SCC\n225, the Court held that \nArticle 14\n \n& 16\n which was described as a facet of\n\nArticle 14\n is part of the basic structure of the Constitution.\n \nIn the case\nof \nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168\n, \nthe said\ndecision\n was reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the legislature could\ntransgress the basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of\nequality enshrined in \nArticle 14\n of which \nArticle 16(1)\n is a facet.\n\n 59. \nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in the above said case of\n\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168, it is held\nthat equality and equal opportunity is a basis feature of our Constitution,\nhas explained the exultant position of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution\nin the scheme of things.\n\n \n60. The judgment of the another Constitution Bench in the case of\n\nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in (1987) 1 SCC 378 and the\nrelevant paragraph (3) is extracted hereunder:\n\n ?3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our Constitution and it is\nthe essence of the rule of law that the exercise of the power by the State\nwhether it be the legislature or the executive or any other authority should\nbe within the constitutional limitations and if any practice is adopted by\nthe executive which is in flagrant and systematic violation of its\nconstitutional limitations, Petitioner 1 as a member of the public would have\nsufficient interest to challenge such practice by filing a writ petition and\nit would be the constitutional duty of this Court to entertain the writ\npetition and adjudicate upon the validity of such practice?\n\n \n61. Let us now look into the way in which the Constitution Bench has\narrived the conclusion in the matter of regularization and permanent\nabsorption in ?\nUmadevi\n Case? and the relevant paragraphs (43) to (50), which\nall are extracted hereunder:\n\n ?43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public\nemployment is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law\nis the core of our Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled from\npassing an order upholding a violation of \nArticle 14\n or in ordering the\noverlooking of the need to comply with the requirements of \nArticle 14\n read\nwith \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the scheme\nfor public employment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily\nto hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and\nafter a proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer\nany right on the appointee. If it is a contractual appointment, the\nappointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come \nto an end when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could not\nclaim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It has\nalso to be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual\nwage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he\nwould not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent,\nmerely on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was\nnot made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant\nrules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the\ninstance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to an end \nor of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, do not\nacquire any right. The High Courts acting under \nArticle 226\n of the\nConstitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,\nregularisation, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was\nmade regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because an\nemployee had continued under cover of an order of the court, which we have\ndescribed as ?litigious employment? in the earlier part of the judgment, he\nwould not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the\nservice. In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in\nissuing interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee\napproaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be possible for it to\nmould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused\nto him, whereas an interim direction to continue his employment would hold up\nthe regular procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of\npaying an employee who is really not required. The courts must be careful in\nensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of\nits affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the\ninstruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory\nmandates. \n\n 44. The concept of ?equal pay for equal work? is different from the\nconcept of conferring permanency on those who have been appointed on ad hoc \nbasis, temporary basis, or based on no process of selection as envisaged by\nthe rules. This Court has in various decisions applied the principle of equal\npay for equal work and has laid down the parameters for the application of\nthat principle. The decisions are rested on the concept of equality enshrined\nin our Constitution in the light of the directive principles in that behalf.\n\nBut the acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a position where the\ncourt could direct that appointments made without following the due procedure\nestablished by law, be deemed permanent or issue directions to treat them as\npermanent. Doing so, would be negation of the principle of equality of\nopportunity. The power to make an order as is necessary for doing complete\njustice in any cause or matter pending before this Court, would not normally\nbe used for giving the go-by to the procedure established by law in the\nmatter of public employment. Take the situation arising in the cases before\nus from the State of Karnataka. Therein, after Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC\n396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] the \nGovernment had issued repeated directions and mandatory orders that no \ntemporary or ad hoc employment or engagement be given. Some of the \nauthorities and departments had ignored those directions or defied those\ndirections and had continued to give employment, specifically interdicted by\nthe orders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing officers have even\nbeen punished for their defiance. It would not be just or proper to pass an\norder in exercise of jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n or 32 of the Constitution\nor in exercise of power under \nArticle 142\n of the Constitution permitting\nthose persons engaged, to be absorbed or to be made permanent, based on their \nappointments or engagements. Complete justice would be justice according to\nlaw and though it would be open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court\nwould not grant a relief which would amount to perpetuating an illegality.\n\n 45. While directing that appointments, temporary or casual, be\nregularised or made permanent, the courts are swayed by the fact that the\nperson concerned has worked for some time and in some cases for a \nconsiderable length of time. It is not as if the person who accepts an\nengagement either temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the nature\nof his employment. He accepts the employment with open eyes. It may be true \nthat he is not in a position to bargain?not at arm's length?since he might\nhave been searching for some employment so as to eke out his livelihood and\naccepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be\nappropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and to take\nthe view that a person who has temporarily or casually got employed should be\ndirected to be continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\nanother mode of public appointment which is not permissible. If the court\nwere to void a contractual employment of this nature on the ground that the\nparties were not having equal bargaining power, that too would not enable the\ncourt to grant any relief to that employee. A total embargo on such casual or\ntemporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies of administration\nand if imposed, would only mean that some people who at least get employment \ntemporarily, contractually or casually, would not be getting even that\nemployment when securing of such employment brings at least some succour to \nthem. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in search of\nemployment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or temporary \nemployment if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in\nthat context that one has to proceed on the basis that the employment was\naccepted fully knowing the nature of it and the consequences flowing from it.\nIn other words, even while accepting the employment, the person concerned\nknows the nature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the\nreal sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in which he is\ntemporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be considered to be\nof such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of the procedure established,\nfor making regular appointments to available posts in the services of the\nState. The argument that since one has been working for some time in the\npost, it will not be just to discontinue him, even though he was aware of the\nnature of the employment when he first took it up, is not one that would\nenable the jettisoning of the procedure established by law for public\nemployment and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone of\nconstitutionality and equality of opportunity enshrined in \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution.\n\n 46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the respondents argued that on\nthe basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, the employees,\nespecially of the Commercial Taxes Department, should be directed to be\nregularised since the decisions in Dharwad [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) \n274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] , Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 :\n\n1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21 ATC 403 : (\n1992) 3 SCR 826] , Jacob [Jacob M. \nPuthuparambil v. Kerala Water Authority\n, (1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 \n: (\n1991) 15 ATC 697] and Gujarat Agricultural University [Gujarat\nAgricultural University v. Rathod Labhu Bechar\n, (2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC\n(L&S) 613] and the like, have given rise to an expectation in them that their\nservices would also be regularised. The doctrine can be invoked if the\ndecisions of the administrative authority affect the person by depriving him\nof some benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been\npermitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect\nto be permitted to continue to do until there have been communicated to him\nsome rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been given an\nopportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-\nmaker that they will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity\nof advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn.\n \n[See\nLord Diplock in Council for Civil Services Union v. Minister of Civil Service\n[1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 : (\n1984) 3 WLR 1174 (HL)] , National\nBuildings Construction Corpn. v. S. Raghunathan\n [(1998) 7 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC \n(L&S) 1770] and Chanchal Goyal (Dr.) v. State of Rajasthan [(2003) 3 SCC 485\n: 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .] There is no case that any assurance was given by the\nGovernment or the department concerned while making the appointment on daily \nwages that the status conferred on him will not be withdrawn until some\nrational reason comes into existence for withdrawing it. The very engagement\nwas against the constitutional scheme. Though, the Commissioner of the\nCommercial Taxes Department sought to get the appointments made permanent, \nthere is no case that at the time of appointment any promise was held out. No\nsuch promise could also have been held out in view of the circulars and\ndirectives issued by the Government after Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396\n: 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] . Though, there \nis a case that the State had made regularisations in the past of similarly\nsituated employees, the fact remains that such regularisations were done only\npursuant to judicial directions, either of the Administrative Tribunal or of\nthe High Court and in some cases by this Court. Moreover, the invocation of\nthe doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable the employees to claim\nthat they must be made permanent or they must be regularised in the service\nthough they had not been selected in terms of the rules for appointment. The\nfact that in certain cases the court had directed regularisation of the\nemployees involved in those cases cannot be made use of to found a claim\nbased on legitimate expectation. The argument if accepted would also run\ncounter to the constitutional mandate. The argument in that behalf has\ntherefore to be rejected.\n\n 47. When a person enters a temporary employment or gets engagement as a \ncontractual or casual worker and the engagement is not based on a proper\nselection as recognised by the relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of\nthe consequences of the appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in\nnature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for\nbeing confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be made\nonly by following a proper procedure for selection and in cases concerned, in\nconsultation with the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the theory of\nlegitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced by temporary,\ncontractual or casual employees. It cannot also be held that the State has\nheld out any promise while engaging these persons either to continue them\nwhere they are or to make them permanent. The State cannot constitutionally\nmake such a promise. It is also obvious that the theory cannot be invoked to\nseek a positive relief of being made permanent in the post.\n\n 48. It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus\nappointed, under \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution, are violated. It is\nstated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by employing them on\nless than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty long\nperiod in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more wages\nor salaries for doing similar work. The employees before us were engaged on\ndaily wages in the department concerned on a wage that was made known to \nthem. There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not being paid. Those\nwho are working on daily wages formed a class by themselves, they cannot \nclaim that they are discriminated as against those who have been regularly\nrecruited on the basis of the relevant rules. No right can be founded on an\nemployment on daily wages to claim that such employee should be treated on a \npar with a regularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in employment,\neven assuming that the principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages\nfor equal work. There is no fundamental right in those who have been employed\non daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they\nhave a right to be absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they\ncannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be\nmade only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of \nArticles\n14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. The right to be treated equally with the other\nemployees employed on daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal \ntreatment with those who were regularly employed. That would be treating\nunequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be\nabsorbed in service even though they have never been selected in terms of the\nrelevant recruitment rules. The arguments based on \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\nConstitution are therefore overruled.\n\n 49. It is contended that the State action in not regularising the\nemployees was not fair within the framework of the rule of law. The rule of\nlaw compels the State to make appointments as envisaged by the Constitution \nand in the manner we have indicated earlier. In most of these cases, no\ndoubt, the employees had worked for some length of time but this has also\nbeen brought about by the pendency of proceedings in tribunals and courts\ninitiated at the instance of the employees. Moreover, accepting an argument\nof this nature would mean that the State would be permitted to perpetuate an\nillegality in the matter of public employment and that would be a negation of\nthe constitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of India. It is therefore\nnot possible to accept the argument that there must be a direction to make\npermanent all the persons employed on daily wages. When the court is \napproached for relief by way of a writ, the court has necessarily to ask\nitself whether the person before it had any legal right to be enforced.\n\nConsidered in the light of the very clear constitutional scheme, it cannot be\nsaid that the employees have been able to establish a legal right to be made\npermanent even though they have never been appointed in terms of the relevant\nrules or in adherence of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n 50. It is argued that in a country like India where there is so much\npoverty and unemployment and there is no equality of bargaining power, the\naction of the State in not making the employees permanent, would be violative\nof \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution. But the very argument indicates that there\nare so many waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for competing for\nemployment and it is in that context that the Constitution as one of its\nbasic features, has included \nArticles 14\n, 16\n and \n309\n so as to ensure that\npublic employment is given only in a fair and equitable manner by giving all\nthose who are qualified, an opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of\nupholding rights under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, a set of persons\ncannot be preferred over a vast majority of people waiting for an opportunity\nto compete for State employment. The acceptance of the argument on behalf of\nthe respondents would really negate the rights of the others conferred by\n\nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, assuming that we are in a position to hold\nthat the right to employment is also a right coming within the purview of\n\nArticle 21\n of the Constitution. The argument that \nArticle 23\n of the\nConstitution is breached because the employment on daily wages amounts to \nforced labour, cannot be accepted. After all, the employees accepted the\nemployment at their own volition and with eyes open as to the nature of their\nemployment. The Governments also revised the minimum wages payable from time \nto time in the light of all relevant circumstances. It also appears to us\nthat importing of these theories to defeat the basic requirement of public\nemployment would defeat the constitutional scheme and the constitutional goal\nof equality.?\n\n 62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that adherence to the rule of\nequality in public employment is a basic feature of our Constitution when it\nis clarified that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a\nbasic feature of the Constitution, certainly, no person can deviate the\nprinciples in this regard and therefore, appointment in accordance with the\nrecruitment rules in force by the competent authorities is the constitutional\nmandate and any deviation to be construed as violation of the constitutional\nprinciples. It is observed that if it is a contractual appointment, the\nappointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come \nto an end when it is discontinued. Similarly temporary employee could not\nclaim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It has\nalso to be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual\nwage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he\nwould not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made appointment,\nmerely on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was\nnot made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant\nrules.\n\n 63. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the\ninstance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to an end \nor of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment do not\nacquire any right. The High Courts acting under \nArticle 226\n of the\nConstitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,\nregularization, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was\nmade regularly and in terms of constitutional scheme.\n\n 64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition on hand. In the present writ\npetition, the writ petitioners were appointed on daily wage basis as Nominal\nMuster Rolls employees. The mere continuance or the length of service\nrendered alone cannot be a ground for granting the relief of regularization.\nThus, the very legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench has to be\nfit in with the facts and circumstances of the present writ petition.\nFurther, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deals with the ?litigious\nemployment?. Of course, the situation does not arise in the present case.\nThe interim order of Status Quo granted by this Court has not been properly\nimplemented by reinstating the petitioners in service and the Contempt\npetition filed by the writ petitioners were also posted along with the writ\npetition for final disposal. Thus, the concept of ?litigious employment?\nwould not arise in respect of the present writ petition. Therefore, the\npetitioners have not continued in service by virtue of the interim order of\nStatus Quo granted by this Court. However, their services were ousted, after\nfiling of the writ petition.\n\n \n65. \nParagraph (44) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment deals with the\nconcept of ?equal pay for equal work?. Thus, it may not be required to\nelaborate the paragraph as far as the present case on hand is concerned.\n\n 66. Paragraph (45) of the above said judgment states that the Apex\nCourt of India held that, while directing that appointments, temporary or\ncasual, be regularized or made permanent, the Courts are swayed by the fact\nthat the person concerned has worked for some time and in some cases for a \nconsiderable length of time. It is not as if the person who accepts an\nengagement either temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the nature\nof his employment. He accepts the employment with open eyes. It may be true\nthat he is not in a position to bargain- not at arm's length ? Since he might\nhave been searching for some employment so as to eke out his livelihood and\naccepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be\nappropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and to take\nthe view that a person who has temporarily or casually got employed should be\ndirected to be continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\nanother mode of public appointment which is not permissible. A total embargo\nof such casual or temporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies\nof administration and if imposed, would only mean that some people who at\nleast get employment temporarily, contractually or casually, would not be\ngetting even that employment when securing of such employment brings at least\nsome succour to them. \n\n 67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in search\nof employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or temporary\nemployment if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in\nthis context that one has to proceed on the basis that the employment was\naccepted fully knowing the nature of it and the consequences flowing from it.\nIn other words, even while accepting the employment, the person concerned\nknows the nature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in\nthe real sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in which\nhe is temporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be considered\nto be of such a magnitude, so as to enable the giving up of the procedure\nestablished, for making regular appointments to available posts in the\nservices of the State.\n\n 68. \nIn \nParagraph (46) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment, their Lordships\nheld that the invocation of the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot\nenable the employees to claim that they must be made permanent or they must \nbe regularised in the service though they had not been selected in terms of\nthe rules for appointment. The fact that in certain cases the court had\ndirected regularization of the employees involved in those cases cannot be\nmade use of, to found a claim based on legitimate expectation. The argument\nif accepted would also run counter to the constitutional mandate. The\nargument in that behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n \n69. \nParagraph (47) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment enumerates that when \na person enters a temporary employment or gets engagement as a contractual or \ncasual worker and the engagement is not based on a proper selection as\nrecognised by the relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the\nconsequences of the appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in\nnature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for\nbeing confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be made\nonly by following a proper procedure for selection and in cases concerned, in\nconsultation with the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the theory of\nlegitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced by temporary,\ncontractual or casual employees.\n\n 70. \nIn paragraph (\n48) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? Judgment, the Constitution\nBench considered the right of the employees thus appointed, under \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16\n of the Constitution, are violated.\n \nEven in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?, those\nemployees before the Supreme Court of India were engaged on daily wages in \nthe department concerned on a daily wage that was made known to them. There \nis no case that the wage agreed upon was not being paid. Those who are\nworking on daily wages formed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that\nthey are discriminated as against those who have been regularly recruited on\nthe basis of the relevant rules. No right can be founded on an employment on\ndaily wages to claim that such employee should be treated on par with a\nregularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in employment, even\nassuming that the principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages for\nequal work. There is no fundamental right for those who have been employed\non daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they\nhave a right to be absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they\ncannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be\nmade only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of \nArticles\n14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n 71. \nIn paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule of law compels the\nState to make appointments as envisaged by the Constitution and in the manner\nwe have indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the judgment of\n?\nUmadevi\n Case?. When the Court is approached by way of a writ, the Court has \nnecessarily to ask itself whether the person before it had any legal right\nto be enforced. Even, the Constitution Bench dealt with the \nArticle 21\n of\nthe Constitution of India, in a Country like India, where there is so much\npoverty and unemployment and there is no equality of bargaining power, the\naction of the State in not making the employees permanent, would be violative\nof \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution. But the very argument indicates that\nthere are so many waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\ncompeting for employment and it is in that context, the Constitution as one\nof its basic features, has included Articles 14,16 and 309 so as to ensure\nthat public employment is given only in a fair and equitable manner by giving\nall those who are qualified, an opportunity to seek employment. In the guise\nof upholding rights under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, a set of persons\ncannot be preferred over a vast majority of people waiting for an opportunity\nto compete for State employment.\n\n \n72. Now, let us look into the important paragraph urged by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner, i.e., paragraph (\n53) of the Judgment of ?Umadevi\n\nCase?.\n\n Paragraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n ?53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where\nirregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in S.V.\nNarayanappa [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N. Nanjundappa [(1972) \n1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799] and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC \n(L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] and referred to in para 15 above, of duly\nqualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and\nthe employees have continued to work for ten years or more but without the\nintervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The question of\nregularisation of the services of such employees may have to be considered on\nmerits in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the cases\nabovereferred to and in the light of this judgment. In that context, the\nUnion of India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take\nsteps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but\nnot under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further\nensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary\nemployees or daily wagers are being now employed. The process must be set in \nmotion within six months from this date. We also clarify that regularisation,\nif any already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on this\njudgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the constitutional\nrequirement and regularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as\nper the constitutional scheme.?\n\n \n73. The above said paragraph (\n53) of the ?Umadevi\n Case? is a one time\nrelief, of Course, granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to mitigate\nthe hardship, if any, caused to the temporary employees. Now, the question\narises how long the benefit granted under paragraph (53) can be extended to\nthe employees and what is the interpretation of the subsequent judgment by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in respect of paragraph (53) of the\njudgment of the Constitution Bench.\n\n 74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia, while stopping the entire irregular appointments and back door\nappointments had taken note of the fact that certain reliefs are required in\nrespect of the employees who are already regularized or in respect of those\npersons, a proposal is already kept pending. Certainly, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India have never intended to grant the relief of regularization or\npermanent absorption in public employment contrary to the legal principles\nsettled in earlier paragraphs. Thus, paragraph (53) of the judgment has to\nbe understood harmoniously and together with the legal principles settled by\nthe Constitution Bench in earlier paragraphs.\n\n \n75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted opinion that paragraph (\n53) of\nthe ?Umadevi\n Case? judgment cannot be treated as an isolation and it should\nbe considered along with the other legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench. Keeping in mind, the legal principles settled by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in earlier paragraphs, this Court is of the\nopinion that one time relief granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas to be extended in its real sense and the High Courts cannot travel beyond\nthe scope of the intention expressed by the Constitution Bench in paragraph\n(53) of the Judgment.\n\n \n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner cited the judgment of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of \nU.P.State Electricity Board Vs.\nPooran Chandra Pandey and Others\n, reported in (2007) 11 SCC 92, and the \nparagraph (11) of the judgment is relevant and is extracted hereunder:\n\n?11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the decision of this\nCourt in \nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] and has urged that no direction for regularisation can be given by\nthe Court. In our opinion, the decision in Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is clearly distinguishable. The said decision cannot be\napplied to a case where regularisation has been sought for in pursuance of\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.?\n\n 77. \nIn the above said case, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench distinguished\nthat case with the ?\nUmadevi\n Case?.\n \nThe very language used in Paragraph (11)\nstates that ?in our opinion, the decision in ?\nUmadevi\n Case? is clearly\ndistinguishable. The said decision cannot be applied to a case where\nregularization has been sought for in pursuance of \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution.\n \nHowever, this Court is of the opinion that their Lordships\nhave distinguished the ?\nUmadevi\n Case? in respect of the facts and\ncircumstances that the case.\n \nWhen their Lordships have distinguished that\ncase, this Court is of the opinion that the legal principles settled in\n?\nUmadevi\n Case? has not been deviated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the \nHon'ble Supreme Court of India, as it is a ?binding precedent? as stated by\nthis Court in earlier paragraphs.\n\n \n78. ?\nUmadevi\n Case? being a ?binding precedent?\n \nand when the case was \ndistinguished from ?\nUmadevi\n Case? on factual circumstances, the same cannot \nbe applied in the present case before this Court.\n\n 79. The judgment in the case of State of Uttaranchal and another Vs.\nPrantiya Sinchai Avam Bandh Yogana Shramik Mahaparishad, reported in (2007) \n12 SCC 483 and the relevant paragraph (5) is cited by the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner which is extracted hereunder:\n\n ?5. A writ petition was filed before the Uttaranchal High Court which\nwas dismissed by the impugned order. The High Court was of the view that all\nthe 14 workmen, in question, were working on daily wages for more than six\nyears and had completed 240 days in each calendar year and they ought to be \nregularised. Accordingly, the writ petition was dismissed.?\n\n 80. On a perusal of the above said judgment, this Court is of the\nopinion that the case relates to an award passed by the Labour Court and an\nAward passed by the Labour Court under the provisions of the \nIndustrial\nDisputes Act\n, cannot have any relevance in respect of the Government\nemployments made by virtue of the rules framed by the State in this regard.\n\nHowever, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in that case, remanded the matter\nback for reconsideration by the High Court in the light of the legal\nprinciples settled in the ?\nUmadevi\n Case?. Thus, in all respects, the case\ncannot have any application in respect of the facts and circumstances of the\npresent writ petition.\n\n \n81. It has further cited the case of \nState of Karnataka and Others Vs.\nM.L.Kesari and Others\n, reported in (2010) 9 SCC 247 and the relevant\nparagraph (7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n ?7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to the\ngeneral principles against ?regularisation? enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006)\n4 SCC 1] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or more in duly\nsanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the interim order of any\ncourt or tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed the employee and continued him in \nservice voluntarily and continuously for more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued against\nsanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not possess the prescribed\nminimum qualifications, the appointments will be considered to be illegal.\n\nBut where the person employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and was \nworking against sanctioned posts, but had been selected without undergoing\nthe process of open competitive selection, such appointments are considered\nto be irregular.?\n\n 82. \nIn \nthe above case\n, an exception has been carved out in relation to\nthe one time relief granted in paragraph (\n15) of the ?Umadevi\n Case?.\n\n 83. \nIn the case of State of Rajastan and Others Vs. Daya Lal and\nOthers, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 429 and the relevant paragraph (12),\nenumerates the settled principles in respect of regularization and parity in\npay, relevant in the context of the case and those principles carved out in\nparagraph (12) of the above judgment are akin to that of the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?.\n\n \n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner solicited the attention of\nthis Court relying the case decided by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of \nNihal Singh and Others Vs.\nState of Punjab and Others\n, reported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and the paragraph\n(31) and (33) of the judgments are extracted hereunder:\n\n \n?31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the process of selection\nadopted in identifying the appellants herein cannot be said to be\nunreasonable or arbitrary in the sense that it was devised to eliminate other\neligible candidates. It may be worthwhile to note that in Umadevi (3) case\n[\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] ,\nthis Court was dealing with appointments made without following any rational\nprocedure in the lower rungs of various services of the Union and the States.\n\n 33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the need to employ a certain\nnumber of people for discharging a particular responsibility of the State\nunder the Constitution is always with the executive government of the day\nsubject to the overall control of the legislature. That does not mean that an\nexamination by a constitutional court regarding the accuracy of the\nassessment of the need is barred.?\n\n \n85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this Court is of an undoubted\nopinion that there is a slight deviation in respect of the legal principles\ncarved out by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?.\n \nThis Court\nwishes to remind the language used by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (\n5)\nof ?Umadevi\n Case?. To reiterate the language used by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India emphatically in paragraph (5) that this Court has also\noccasions to issue directions which could not be said to be consisted by the\npublic employment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis of\nequitable consideration or individualization of justice. The question\narises, equity to whom? Equity for the handful of people who have approached\nthe Court with a claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this Country\nseeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for competing for\nemployment?\n\n 86. \nIn paragraph (54) of the said ?\nUmadevi\n Case? judgment, again the\nConstitution Bench reiterated that ?It is also clarified that those decisions\nwhich run counter to the principle settled in this decision, or in which\ndirections running counter to what we have held herein, will stand denuded of\ntheir status as precedents.?\n\n \n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the judgment cited by\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner in the case of \nNihal Singh and Others\nVs. State of Punjab and Others\n, reported in (2013) 14 SCC 65, is to be\nconsidered as denuded of their status as precedents. Thus, this Court is not\ninclined to consider and follow the same.\n\n 88. \nIn the case of \nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra and others Vs. State of\nOrissa and others\n, reported in (2014) 4 SCC 583, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench\nof the Supreme Court of India held that and the paragraphs (42) & (43) of\nthe above said judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n \n?42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , as noticed earlier, permitted\nregularisation of regular appointments and not illegal appointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is whether the appointments in the instant case could be\ndescribed as illegal and if they were not, whether the State could be\ndirected to regularise the services of the degree-holder Junior Engineers who\nhave worked as ad hoc Assistant Engineers for such a long period, not only on\nthe analogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation but also on the\nprinciple underlying para 53 of the decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\n \n43.As to what would constitute an irregular appointment is no longer\nres integra. The decision of this Court in \nState of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , has examined that question and \nexplained the principle regarding regularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3)\ncase [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\n. The decision \nin that case\n summed up the following three essentials for\nregularisation: (1) the employees have worked for ten years or more, (2) that\nthey have so worked in a duly sanctioned post without the benefit or\nprotection of the interim order of any court or tribunal, and (3) they should\nhave possessed the minimum qualification stipulated for the appointment.\nSubject to these three requirements being satisfied, even if the appointment\nprocess did not involve open competitive selection, the appointment would be\ntreated irregular and not illegal and thereby qualify for regularisation.\n\nPara 7 in this regard is apposite and may be extracted at this stage: (\nM.L.\nKesari\n case [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250) \n?7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to the general\nprinciples against ?regularisation?\n \nenunciated in \nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the\nfollowing conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or more in a duly\nsanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the interim order of any\ncourt or tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed the employee and continued him in \nservice voluntarily and continuously for more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued against\nsanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not possess the prescribed\nminimum qualifications, the appointments will be considered to be illegal.\n\nBut where the person employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and was \nworking against sanctioned posts, but had been selected without undergoing\nthe process of open competitive selection, such appointments are considered\nto be irregular.?\n\n \n89. It is important to cite the case of \nSECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, SCHOOL \nEDUCATION DEPARTMENT,CHENNAI v. R.GOVINDASWAMY AND ORS.\n[ (2014) 4 SCC 769]. \nIn paragraph No.(8), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as follows:\n\n?8.this Court in \nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal & Ors.\n, AIR 2011 SC\n1193, has considered the scope of regularisation of irregular or part-time\nappointments in all possible eventualities and laid down well-settled\nprinciples relating to regularisation and parity in pay relevant in the\ncontext of the issues involved therein. The same are as under:\n\n?(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under \nArticle 226\n of the\nConstitution will not issue directions for regularisation, absorption or\npermanent continuance, unless the employees claiming regularisation had been \nappointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in accordance with relevant\nrules in an open competitive process, against sanctioned vacant posts. The\nequality clause contained in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n should be scrupulously\nfollowed and Courts should not issue a direction for regularisation of\nservices of an employee which would be violative of the constitutional\nscheme. While something that is irregular for want of compliance with one of\nthe elements in the process of selection which does not go to the root of the\nprocess, can be regularised, back door entries, appointments contrary to the\nconstitutional scheme and/or appointment of ineligible candidates cannot be\nregularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad hoc or daily-wage\nemployee, under cover of some interim orders of the court, would not confer\nupon him any right to be absorbed into service, as such service would be\n?litigious employment?. Even temporary, ad hoc or daily-wage service for a\nlong number of years, let alone service for one or two years, will not\nentitle such employee to claim regularisation, if he is not working against a\nsanctioned post. Sympathy and sentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be grounds for \npassing any order of regularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularisation with a cut-off\ndate (that is a scheme providing that persons who had put in a specified\nnumber of years of service and continuing in employment as on the cut-off\ndate), it is not possible to others who were appointed subsequent to the cut-\n\noff date, to claim or contend that the scheme should be applied to them by\nextending the cut-off date or seek a direction for framing of fresh schemes\nproviding for successive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek regularisation as they are\nnot working against any sanctioned posts. There cannot be a direction for\nabsorption, regularisation or permanent continuance of part-time temporary\nemployees. \n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run institutions cannot claim\nparity in salary with regular employees of the Government on the principle of\nequal pay for equal work. Nor can employees in private employment, even if\nserving full time, seek parity in salary with government employees. The right\nto claim a particular salary against the State must arise under a contract or\nunder a statute.? (Emphasis added) ?\n\n \n90. Reiterating the principles \nlaid down in\n the \nCase of Secretary to\nGovernment, School Education Department, Chennai Vs. R.Govindaswamy and \nothers\n, reported in (2014) 4 SCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nemphatically ruled that the High Courts, in exercising power under \nArticle\n226\n of the Constitution of India will not issue directions for\nregularization, absorption or permanent continuance. Unless the employees\nclaiming regularization had been appointed in pursuance of a regular\nrecruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive process\nagainst sanctioned vacant posts, the equality clause contained in \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16\n should be scrupulously followed and Courts should not issue a\ndirection for regularization of services of an employee which would be\nviolative of the Constitutional scheme.\n\n 91. \nIn the case of \nNand Kumar Vs. State of Bihar and Others\n, reported\nin (2014) 5 SCC 300, paragraph (25) & (26) are extracted hereunder:\n\n \n?25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid decisions of this Court.\nThe principle as has been \nlaid down in\n \nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has also been applied in\nrelation to the persons who were working on daily wages. According to us, the\ndaily wagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the term\n?appointment?. They do not hold a post. The scheme of alternative appointment\nframed for regular employees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore,\nconfer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of abolished organisation to\nsuch alternative employment.\n \n(See \nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n \n[(2006) 4 SCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] ) Their relevance in the context of\nappointment arose by reason of the concept of regularisation as a source of\nappointment.\n \nAfter Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , their position continued to be that of daily\nwagers. Appointment on daily-wage basis is not an appointment to a post\naccording to the rules. Usually, the projects in which the daily wagers were\nengaged, having come to an end, their appointment is necessarily terminated\nfor want of work. Therefore, the status and rights of daily wagers of a\ngovernment concern are not equivalent to that of a government servant and his\nclaim to permanency has to be adjudged differently.\n\n 26.In these circumstances, in our considered opinion, the\nregularisation/absorption is not a matter of course. It would depend upon the\nfacts of the case following the rules and regulations and cannot be dehors\nthe rules for such regularisation/absorption.?\n\n \n92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion that the above two\nparagraphs are running contrary to the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Thus, the rules\n\nlaid down in\n paragraph (54) of the Constitution Bench to be applied in\nrespect of \nthe above case\n cited.\n\n 93. \nIn the case of \nMalathi Das and Others, Vs. Suresh and Others\n,\nreported in (2014) 13 SCC 249 and the relevant paragraph (13) is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n \n?13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is wholly unnecessary for us\nto consider as to whether the cases of persons who were awaiting\nregularisation on the date of the decision in \nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka\nv. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is required to be dealt\nwith in accordance with the conditions stipulated in para 53 of \nUmadevi (3)\n[State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\ninasmuch as the claims of the respondent employees can well be decided on \nprinciples of parity.\n \nSimilarly placed employees having been regularised by\nthe State and in case of some of them such regularisation being after the\ndecision in \nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we are of the view that the stand taken by the appellants\nin refusing regularisation to the respondents cannot be countenanced.\nHowever, as the said stand of the appellants stems from their perception and\nunderstanding of the decision in \nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we do not hold them liable for\ncontempt but make it clear that the appellants and all the other competent\nauthorities of the State will now be obliged and duty-bound to regularise the\nservices of the respondents (74 in number) which will now be done forthwith\nand in any case within a period of two months from the date of receipt of\nthis order.?\n\n \n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once again taken a deviation in\nrespect of the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India. Therefore, such deviation to be held as\ndenuded of their status as precedent, as \nlaid down in\n paragraph (54) of the\nConstitution Bench.\n\n 95. \nIn the case of \nAmarkant Rai Vs. State of Bihar and Others\n, reported\nin (2015) 8 SCC 265, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in paragraph (11) and\n(14) are held as follows:\n\n \n?11.Elaborating upon the principles \nlaid down in\n Umadevi (3) case\n[(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and explaining the difference between\nirregular and illegal appointments in \nState of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , this Court held as under: (\nM.L.\nKesari\n case [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250, para 7)\n?7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to the general\nprinciples against ?regularisation? enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1\n: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or more in duly\nsanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the interim order of any\ncourt or tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed the employee and continued him in \nservice voluntarily and continuously for more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued against\nsanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not possess the prescribed\nminimum qualifications, the appointments will be considered to be illegal.\n\nBut where the person employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and was \nworking against sanctioned posts, but had been selected without undergoing\nthe process of open competitive selection, such appointments are considered\nto be irregular.?\n\n 14.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case that the\nappellant has served the University for more than 29 years on the post of\nnight guard and that he has served the College on daily wages, in the\ninterest of justice, the authorities are directed to regularise the services\nof the appellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002 (the date on which he\nrejoined the post as per the direction of the Registrar).\"\n\n 96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India held that the appellant has served in the University for more\nthan 29 years in the post of night guard and that he has served the College\non daily wages, in the interest of justice, the authorities are directed to\nregularise the services of the appellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\n \n97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has\ndeviated the principles \nlaid down in\n ?\nUmadevi\n Case?. Thus, this Court has to\nderive an opinion that the decision would be denuded of its status as\nprecedents.\n \nFor all these reasons, this Court has to independently apply the\nlegal principles settled by the Constitution Bench in the ?\nUmadevi\n Case?.\n\n 98. \nIn the case of \nPrem Ram Vs. Managing Director, Uttarakhand Pey Jal \n& Nirman Nigam, Dehradun and Others\n, reported in (2015) 11 SCC 255, \nundoubtedly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has decided the case based on\nthe facts and circumstances of the case. However, on a plain reading of the\njudgment, this Court is of the opinion that the legal principles settled by\nthe Constitution Bench has not been considered by the Hon'ble Two Judges \nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Thus, this Court is not\ninclined to follow the judgment for the purpose of deciding the case on hand.\n\n 99. \nIn the case of \nSurendra Kumar and Others Vs. Greater Noida\nIndustrial Development Authority and Others\n, reported in (2015) 14 SCC 382,\nwhile, the Supreme Court of India in paragraph (13) held as follows:\n\n \n?13.Considering the facts of the present case on the touchstone \nlaid\ndown in\n Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , it will be seen that the Division Bench was not right\nin setting aside the appointment of the appellants. More so, it was nobody's\ncase challenging the appointment of the appellants. Admittedly, the\nappellants were engaged as contractual employees from 1994 and have completed \nmore than ten years of continuous service with Respondent 1. They continued\nin service not by the orders of the Court/Tribunal, but by the decision of\nthe respondents. The appellants were regularised as per the policy decision\ndated 16-4-2003 taken by Respondent 1 and approved by the State Government \nvide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the appointment of the appellants were made\npursuant to the policy of regularisation, the High Court was not right in\nquashing the appointment of the appellants as the same were never in question\nbefore the High Court. The plea that was raised by the appellants was only to\nseek regularisation with retrospective effect from 20-11-2002 and the\nconsequential seniority.?\n\n 100. \nIn this case also, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India has taken note of the one time benefit granted by the\nConstitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the Judgment in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?.\nHowever, the legal principles settled in paragraphs 5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to\n50 and 54 of the judgment has not been considered by their Lordships. Since\nthe legal principles enunciated in the above paragraphs of the Constitution\nBench has not been considered and the case was decided based on the \nparticular facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is not bound to\nconsider it as a ?binding precedent? as enumerated in the first portion of\nthis Judgment. This Court has earlier considered the nature of the ?binding\nprecedents?\n \nand the interpretation of binding precedents as enumerated by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the recent case\nof \nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n, reported in [JT\n2017 10 SC 450] cited supra.\n\n \n101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is able to find out that\nthose cases by the Hon'ble Two Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nwere decided based on certain facts and circumstances of the case. However,\nall those circumstances and the legal principles were well settled by the\nConstitution Bench in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?. Various paragraphs of the\nConstitution Bench judgment as discussed above made it very clear that all\nthe circumstances arisen out of the temporary/casual/daily wages employees \nwere dealt with elaborately and a findings are provided. This being the\nfactum of the case, this Court is not inclined to follow the above judgment\nof the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as a\n?binding precedent?\n \nand this Court is bound by the legal principles settled\nby the Constitution Bench in ?\nUmadevi\n Case? which remains as the law of the\nland under \nArticle 141\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n \n102. This Court is willing to cite another judgment of the Hon'ble Two\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of \nPunjab\nWater Supply & Sewerage Board Vs. Ranjodh Singh and Others\n, reported in \n(2007) 2 SCC Page 491. In the above judgment paragraph (17) & (18) are\nextracted hereunder:\n\n?17.A combined reading of the aforementioned paragraphs would clearly\nindicate that what the Constitution Bench had in mind in directing\nregularisation was in relation to such appointments, which were irregular in\nnature and not illegal ones.\n\n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is explicit. It has been\nso pointed out in \nNational Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n [(2006) 5 SCC 493\n: 2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms: (SCC pp. 500-01, paras 23-25)\n?23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nrespondents that the appointments were irregular and not illegal, cannot be\naccepted for more than one reason. They were appointed only on the basis of\ntheir applications. The Recruitment Rules were not followed. Even the\nSelection Committee had not been properly constituted. In view of the ban on\nemployment, no recruitment was permissible in law. The reservation policy\nadopted by the appellant had not been maintained. Even cases of minorities\nhad not been given due consideration.\n\n24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing regularisation of the\nservices only of those employees whose appointments were irregular as\nexplained in \nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\n [AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1\nSCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n [(\n1972) 1 SCC 409] and B.N. \nNagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] wherein \nthis Court observed: [Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\n, SCC p. 24, para 16]\n?16.\n \nIn \nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n(L&S) 4] this Court clearly held that the words ?regular? or ?regularisation?\n\ndo not connote permanence and cannot be construed so as to convey an idea of \nthe nature of tenure of appointments. They are terms calculated to condone\nany procedural irregularities and are meant to cure only such defects as are\nattributable to methodology followed in making the appointments.?\n\n25. Judged by the standards \nlaid down by\n this Court in the aforementioned\ndecisions, the appointments of the respondents are illegal. They do not,\nthus, have any legal right to continue in service.?\n\n(See also \nState of M.P. v. Yogesh Chandra Dubey\n [(2006) 8 SCC 67 : 2006 \nSCC \n(L&S) 1797] and State of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n [(2007) 1 SCC 575 : (2006)\n12 Scale 642] .)?\n\n \n103. The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas dealt with the interpretation of paragraphs 16, 17, 19 and 22 of ?\nUmadevi\n\nCase? and the paragraphs (16), (17), (19) and (22) are extracted hereunder:\n\n ?16. \nIn \nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980\nSCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] this Court clearly held that the words\n?regular? or ?regularisation? do not connote permanence and cannot be\nconstrued so as to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of appointments.\nThey are terms calculated to condone any procedural irregularities and are\nmeant to cure only such defects as are attributable to methodology followed\nin making the appointments. This Court emphasised that when rules framed \nunder \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution are in force, no regularisation is\npermissible in exercise of the executive powers of the Government under\n\nArticle 162\n of the Constitution in contravention of the rules. These\ndecisions and the principles recognised therein have not been dissented to by\nthis Court and on principle, we see no reason not to accept the proposition\nas enunciated in the above decisions. We have, therefore, to keep this\ndistinction in mind and proceed on the basis that only something that is\nirregular for want of compliance with one of the elements in the process of\nselection which does not go to the root of the process, can be regularised\nand that it alone can be regularised and granting permanence of employment is\na totally different concept and cannot be equated with regularisation.\n\n17. We have already indicated the constitutional scheme of public employment\nin this country, and the executive, or for that matter the court, in\nappropriate cases, would have only the right to regularise an appointment\nmade after following the due procedure, even though a non-fundamental element\nof that process or procedure has not been followed. This right of the\nexecutive and that of the court would not extend to the executive or the\ncourt being in a position to direct that an appointment made in clear\nviolation of the constitutional scheme, and the statutory rules made in that\nbehalf, can be treated as permanent or can be directed to be treated as\npermanent. \n\n19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also controlled by economic\nconsiderations and financial implications of any public employment. The\nviability of the department or the instrumentality of the project is also of\nequal concern for the State. The State works out the scheme taking into\nconsideration the financial implications and the economic aspects. Can the\ncourt impose on the State a financial burden of this nature by insisting on\nregularisation or permanence in employment, when those employed temporarily \nare not needed permanently or regularly? As an example, we can envisage a \ndirection to give permanent employment to all those who are being temporarily\nor casually employed in a public sector undertaking. The burden may become so \nheavy by such a direction that the undertaking itself may collapse under its\nown weight. It is not as if this had not happened. So, the court ought not to\nimpose a financial burden on the State by such directions, as such directions\nmay turn counterproductive.\n\n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question whether the jettisoning\nof the constitutional scheme of appointment can be approved, was not\nconsidered or decided. The distinction emphasised in \nR.N. Nanjundappa v. T.\nThimmiah\n [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The \nCourt appears to have been dealing with a scheme for ?equal pay for equal\nwork? and in the process, without an actual discussion of the question, had\napproved a scheme put forward by the State, prepared obviously at the\ndirection of the Court, to order permanent absorption of such daily-rated\nworkers. With respect to the learned judges, the decision cannot be said to\nlay down any law, that all those engaged on daily wages, casually,\ntemporarily, or when no sanctioned post or vacancy existed and without\nfollowing the rules of selection, should be absorbed or made permanent though\nnot at a stretch, but gradually. If that were the ratio, with respect, we\nhave to disagree with it.?\n\n 104. \nIn the case of \nPost Master General, Kolkata and Others Vs. Tutu\nDas(Dutta\n), reported in (2007) 5 SCC 317, paragraphs (5) & (18) are relevant\nand the same are extracted hereunder:\n\n ?5.Whereas pursuant to the said direction, although the case of Niva\nGhosh was allegedly considered, her case was not, whereupon a contempt \npetition was filed. In the said contempt proceedings, a stand was taken by\nthe appellant that she had not completed a period of 240 days in a year\nbefore the said cut-off date. The said contempt petition was dismissed with\nliberty to the respondent to file a fresh original application. Pursuant to\nthe said observations, the respondent filed an application before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta which was marked as OA No. \n484 of 2002.\n\n 18.There are two distinctive features in the present case, which are:\n\n(i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it cannot be invoked where any\nillegality has been committed or where no legal right is established.\n\n(ii) According to the appellant the respondent having completed 240 days,\ndoes not fulfil the requisite criteria. A disputed question of fact has been\nraised. The High Court did not come to a positive finding that she had worked\nfor more than 240 days in a year.?\n\n 105. \nIn the case of \nC.Balachandran and Others Vs. State of Kerala and\nOthers\n, reported in (2009) 1 SCC (L& S) 610, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India interpreted the scope of paragraph 153 of ?\nUmadevi\n Case? and\nthe paragraphs (17) & (18) of \nthe said judgment\n and the same is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n \n?17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon the observations made in\nPara 53 in Umadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] which reads as \nunder: (SCC p. 42, para 53)\n?53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where irregular\nappointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in \nState of Mysore v.\nS.V. Narayanappa\n [AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. \nT. Thimmiah\n [(\n1972) 1 SCC 409] and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] and referred to in para 15 above, of\nduly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made\nand the employees have continued to work for ten years or more but without\nthe intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The question of\nregularisation of the services of such employees may have to be considered on\nmerits in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the cases\nabovereferred to and in the light of this judgment. In that context, the\nUnion of India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take\nsteps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but\nnot under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further\nensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary\nemployees or daily wagers are being now employed. The process must be set in \nmotion within six months from this date. We also clarify that regularisation,\nif any already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on this\njudgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the constitutional\nrequirement and regularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as\nper the constitutional scheme.?(emphasis in original)\nA case of regularisation which thus attained finality and was not sub judice\nwould not come within the purview of exception to the rule contained in Para\n53 of \nthe said judgment\n. The appellants' case, thus, does not come within the\npurview thereof. Only those cases where regularisations had already been made\nwere not to be reopened. It is not in dispute that services of the appellants\nwere terminated as far back as in 1987 and they did not question the legality\nor validity of the said order.\n \nIt is only after the decision of this Court in\n\nJacob\n case [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15 ATC 697] that \nrepresentations were filed. Such representations were rejected both by the\nKerala Water Authority as also the State of Kerala.\n\n \n18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus, neither in law nor in equity\nwere entitled to be reinstated in service. The decision of this Court in\n\nJacob\n case [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15 ATC 697] being \nnot applicable to the case of the appellants, we are bound by the \nratio \nlaid\ndown in\n Umadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . So far as Para 53 of\nthe judgment of the Constitution Bench in the said case is concerned, the\nsame has been considered by this Court in a large number of decisions.\n \nIn\n\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board v. Ranjodh Singh\n [(2007) 2 SCC 491 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498, para 15)\n?15. The question came up for consideration before a Constitution Bench of\nthis Court in \nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] wherein it was held that no person who was temporarily or casually\nbeen employed could be directed to be continued permanently. It was opined\nthat by doing so it would be creating another mode of public employment which\nis not permissible.?\n\n[See \nEmployees' Union v. Mineral Exploration Corpn. Ltd.\n [(2006) 6 SCC 310 :\n\n2006 \nSCC (L&S) 1318] , State of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n [(2007) 1 SCC 575 :\n\n(\n2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post Master General v. Tutu Das (Dutta\n) [(2007) 5\nSCC 317 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 179] .]?\n\n \n106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of the judgment, is well\nenumerated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of \nIndia as cited above, this Court is not inclined to consider the other\njudgments referred by the learned counsel for the petitioner. However, on a\nperusal of all these judgments cited supra, this Court is of the opinion that\nultimately the legal principle settled in by the Constitution Bench in the\n?\nUmadevi\n Case? is binding over the subject and the same is to be followed\nscrupulously by all the Courts across the country and the same becomes the\nlaw of the land in the matter of regularization, permanent absorption and\nappointment.\n\n \n107. Now, considering the facts and circumstances of the case on hand,\nit remains that the writ petitioners were appointed as daily rated employees\nfor a particular period and, this Court has to draw an inference that all the\nGovernment orders passed subsequent to the Constitution Bench Judgment, if \nruns contrary to the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench,\nwould become invalid and the same cannot be implemented or followed. In\nother words, it is to be noted that the Government has no authority to issue\nany orders granting regularization, permanent absorption or appointment in\nviolation of the Constitutional schemes and in violation of the recruitment\nrules in force. The power of the Government in this regard is certainly\nabrogated by the principles settled by the Constitution Bench in the ?\nUmadevi\n\nCase?. Such being the factum of the case, the State Government is to be\nprecluded as well as its authority are to be regularized in respect of\nappointing employees in contravention with the recruitment rules in force and\neffecting appointments through back doors.\n\n 108. This Court has to place on record that the State is bound to over\nsee the appointments made in this regard illegally or irregularly by the\ncompetent authorities and the same is to be construed as the fraud on the\nConstitution and such authorities are liable for prosecution under the\nDiscipline and Appeal Rules and other relevant rules. The State shall be\nvigilant in this regard and the authorities indulging in such activities of\nexercising powers by issuing illegal or irregular appointments are to be\nbooked under the Discipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be shown by \nthe State in this regard, since these all are the Constitutional principles\nrequired for the State to be followed and the State being a modal employer,\nhas to implement the Constitutional perspectives and the principles\nscrupulously and without any deviation.\n\n \n109. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in paragraph\n(15) of the judgment in ?\nUmadevi\n Case?, the Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India held that a distinction between regularisation\nand conferment of permanent status in service jurisprudence has to be drawn.\nThis Court is of the opinion that the conferment of permanent status Act, is\na general law applicable to the employees, in the absence of any special law\ngoverning the particular subject. However, if any such law prevails and\ncovering the field of appointment of regularisation and permanent absorption,\nthen the general law would not apply. In nutshell, the special law and rules\nwill prevail over the general law and the special rules in force are to be\napplied in the relevant case.\n\n 110. In view of the discussions made above, this Court is of the\nopinion that the writ petitioners are not entitled for any relief of\npermanent absorption as such sought for in this writ petition.\n\n 9. In view of the legal discussions made, no further adjudication is\nrequired in this regard. Accordingly, this writ petitions stands dismissed.\nNo costs.\n\nTo\n The Commissioner \n Municipal Administration,\n Ezhilagam, Cheppauk, \n Chennai- 5.\n\n.\u001a",

The scheme was essentially\nrelating to the application of the concept of equal pay for equal work but it\nalso provided for making permanent, or what it called regularisation, without\nkeeping the distinction in mind, of employees who had been appointed ad hoc,\ncasually, temporarily or on daily-wage basis. In other words, employees who\nhad been appointed without following the procedure established by law for\nsuch appointments. This Court, at the threshold, stated that it should\nindividualise justice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is not\npossible to accept the statement, unqualified as it appears to be. This Court\nis not only the constitutional court, it is also the highest court in the\ncountry, the final court of appeal. By virtue of \nArticle 141\n of the\nConstitution, what this Court lays down is the law of the land. Its decisions\nare binding on all the courts. Its main role is to interpret the\nconstitutional and other statutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\nphilosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto ourselves a system of\ngovernance by rule of law. The role of the Supreme Court is to render justice\naccording to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme Court is expected to\ndecide questions of law for the country and not to decide individual cases\nwithout reference to such principles of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing\norders not consistent with its own decisions on law, is bound to send out\nconfusing signals and usher in judicial chaos. Its role, therefore, is really\nto interpret the law and decide cases coming before it, according to law."

Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public\nemployment is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law\nis the core of our Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled from\npassing an order upholding a violation of \nArticle 14\n or in ordering the\noverlooking of the need to comply with the requirements of \nArticle 14\n read\nwith \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the scheme\nfor public employment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily\nto hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and\nafter a proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer\nany right on the appointee. If it is a contractual appointment, the\nappointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come \nto an end when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could not\nclaim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It has\nalso to be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual\nwage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he\nwould not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent,\nmerely on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was\nnot made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant\nrules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the\ninstance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to an end \nor of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, do not\nacquire any right. The High Courts acting under \nArticle 226\n of the\nConstitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,\nregularisation, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was\nmade regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because an\nemployee had continued under cover of an order of the court, which we have\ndescribed as ?litigious employment? in the earlier part of the judgment, he\nwould not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the\nservice. In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in\nissuing interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee\napproaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be possible for it to\nmould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused\nto him, whereas an interim direction to continue his employment would hold up\nthe regular procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of\npaying an employee who is really not required. The courts must be careful in\nensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of\nits affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the\ninstruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory\nmandates."

The power to make an order as is necessary for doing complete\njustice in any cause or matter pending before this Court, would not normally\nbe used for giving the go-by to the procedure established by law in the\nmatter of public employment.

It may be true \nthat he is not in a position to bargain?not at arm's length?since he might\nhave been searching for some employment so as to eke out his livelihood and\naccepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be\nappropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and to take\nthe view that a person who has temporarily or casually got employed should be\ndirected to be continued permanently.

After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in search of\nemployment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or temporary \nemployment if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in\nthat context that one has to proceed on the basis that the employment was\naccepted fully knowing the nature of it and the consequences flowing from it.\nIn other words, even while accepting the employment, the person concerned\nknows the nature of his employment.

The claim acquired by him in the post in which he is\ntemporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be considered to be\nof such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of the procedure established,\nfor making regular appointments to available posts in the services of the\nState. The argument that since one has been working for some time in the\npost, it will not be just to discontinue him, even though he was aware of the\nnature of the employment when he first took it up, is not one that would\nenable the jettisoning of the procedure established by law for public\nemployment and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone of\nconstitutionality and equality of opportunity enshrined in \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution."

The very engagement\nwas against the constitutional scheme.

Moreover, the invocation of\nthe doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable the employees to claim\nthat they must be made permanent or they must be regularised in the service\nthough they had not been selected in terms of the rules for appointment. The\nfact that in certain cases the court had directed regularisation of the\nemployees involved in those cases cannot be made use of to found a claim\nbased on legitimate expectation.

It is\nstated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by employing them on\nless than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty long\nperiod in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more wages\nor salaries for doing similar work. The employees before us were engaged on\ndaily wages in the department concerned on a wage that was made known to \nthem. There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not being paid. Those\nwho are working on daily wages formed a class by themselves, they cannot \nclaim that they are discriminated as against those who have been regularly\nrecruited on the basis of the relevant rules. No right can be founded on an\nemployment on daily wages to claim that such employee should be treated on a \npar with a regularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in employment,\neven assuming that the principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages\nfor equal work. There is no fundamental right in those who have been employed\non daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they\nhave a right to be absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they\ncannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be\nmade only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of \nArticles\n14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. The right to be treated equally with the other\nemployees employed on daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal \ntreatment with those who were regularly employed. That would be treating\nunequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be\nabsorbed in service even though they have never been selected in terms of the\nrelevant recruitment rules.

According to us, the\ndaily wagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the term\n?appointment?. They do not hold a post. The scheme of alternative appointment\nframed for regular employees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore,\nconfer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of abolished organisation to\nsuch alternative employment.\n \n(See \nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n \n[(2006) 4 SCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] ) Their relevance in the context of\nappointment arose by reason of the concept of regularisation as a source of\nappointment.\n \nAfter Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , their position continued to be that of daily\nwagers. Appointment on daily-wage basis is not an appointment to a post\naccording to the rules. Usually, the projects in which the daily wagers were\nengaged, having come to an end, their appointment is necessarily terminated\nfor want of work. Therefore, the status and rights of daily wagers of a\ngovernment concern are not equivalent to that of a government servant and his\nclaim to permanency has to be adjudged differently."
