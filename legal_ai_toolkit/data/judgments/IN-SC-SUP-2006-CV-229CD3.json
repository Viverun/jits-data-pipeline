Krishna Reddy\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 01/11/2006\n\nBENCH:\nS.B. Sinha & Markandey Katju\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n[Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No. 24946 of 2005]\n\nS.B. SINHA, J :\n\nLeave granted.\n\nAppellant is a statutory corporation constituted under the\nRoad\nTransport Corporation Act, 1950\n. It has its own scheme in terms whereof\ngratuity is being paid at the rate of 30 days' basic pay for each completed\nyear of service. Government Servants are, however, entitled to gratuity\ncalculated on the basis of 15 days' basic pay for each completed year of\nservice. Such is the position also under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n\n(for short \"the Act\").\n\nDisputes and differences having arisen by and between the workmen\nof the Corporation and the management, a settlement was arrived at on\n17.07.1999. The said settlement was valid for the period 1.01.1988 and\n31.12.1991. It expired on 31.12.1991, Clause (5) whereof postulated:\n\n\"Dearness Allowance\nThe rates of Dearness allowance shall be on\npar with the rates sanctioned by the State\nGovernment to its employees from time to time\nand from the same date. The enhanced Dearness\nAllowance shall be paid in cash.\n\nIf during the currency of this settlement, the\nGovernment of Karnataka were to merge any\nportion of Dearness Allowance presently being\npaid to its employees, that portion of the Dearness\nAllowance so merged will also be reckoned at\nappropriate levels by the corporation for\ndetermining the Dearness Allowance, House Rent\nAllowance, City Compensatory Allowance and\nGratuity payable to the employees of the\ncorporation, but shall not be reckoned for other\npurposes.\"\n\nThe State of Karnataka merged a part of the Dearness Allowance\nwith the basic pay wherefor a Government Order being Government Order\nNo. FD 27 SRS 95 was issued on 28.11.1995 which is to the following\neffect:\n\n\"The question of revision of pensionery benefits in\nrespect of Government Servants has been\nexamined by Government in the light of the\nrecommendations made by the Karnataka State\nFourth Pay Commission and the decision taken by\nthe Government of India on the Interim\nRecommendations of the Fifth Central Pay\nCommission. Accordingly, the following orders\nare issued.\n\n2. Government are now pleased to order that\nDearness Allowance sanctioned upto the Average\nAll India Consumer Price Index (A.I.C.P.I.)\n1201.66 in Government order No. FD 29 SRP 93,\ndated 30th October, 1993 as indicated below, shall\nbe reckoned as emoluments for the purpose of\nretirement gratuity/ death gratuity under the\nKarnataka Civil Services Rules in respect of State\nGovernment Employees who retire or die on or\nafter 28th November, 1995:\n\nPay Range\nRate of Dearness\nAllowance to be added\nto pay for calculating\ngratuity\n\n1.\n\nBasic pay upto 3500\nper month\n90% of basic pay\n\n2.\nBasic pay between\nRs. 3401 and upto Rs.\n\n600 per month\n67% basic pay subject to\nminimum of Rs. 3150\nper month\n\n3.\nBasic pay above Rs.\n\n6000 per month\n58% of basic pay subject\nto minimum of Rs. 4020\nper month\"\n\nThe appellant, however, contends that actual merger of pay had taken\nplace on 7.01.1999 with retrospective effect from 1.04.1998 wherefor a\nGovernment Order was issued. The Board of Directors of the appellant in\nits meeting held on 14.01.1999 adopted a resolution in the following terms:\n\n\"The Principal Secretary, Finance Department\nstated that the provisions of the\nGratuity Act, 1972\n\nhas to be followed as far as the ceiling on payment\nof gratuity is concerned. The legal position in this\nregard may be examined in the context of the\nsettlements reached and appropriate necessary\naction taken.\n\nAfter considering the matter in detail the\nBoard of Directors resolved as hereunder:\n\nResolution No. 7808\n\nApproval is accepted for the payment of\ngratuity to the employees of the Corporation from\n28.11.1995 in terms of the\nGratuity Act\n1972 if it\nis more advantageous.\"\n\nThe Board of Directors of the appellant also adopted the following\nresolution on 26.06.1999:\n\n\"Approval is accorded to merge the Dearness\nAllowance as contemplated in Government Order\nNo. FD 48 SRP 98 dated 7.1.1999 into the Basic\nPay of the employee of the Corporation w.e.f.\n1.04.1998 by treating the same as Basic D.A. for\ncalculation of Gratuity.\"\n\nThe dispute between the parties centers round the issue as to whether\nfor the purpose of computation of the amount of gratuity, the order dated\n28.11.1995 would be attracted or not.\n\nRespondent herein was appointed on 4.06.1959 as a conductor. He\nretired as traffic inspector on 30.03.1996. He claimed gratuity in terms of\nthe said Government Order dated 28.11.1995. The same having been denied\nto him, he filed an application before the Assistant Labour Commissioner\nand Controlling Authority under the Act. By an award dated 6.02.1998, he\nwas held to be entitled thereto. An appeal thereagainst was preferred by the\nappellant. The Appellate Authority in terms of its order dated 15.09.1998\nallowed the said appeal. The respondent filed a writ petition before the High\nCourt. A learned Single Judge by reason of a judgment and order dated\n13.10.2003 allowed the said writ petition inter alia holding:\n\n\"In so far as the other contention that the\nGovernment Order only speaks adding Dearness\nAllowance to the basic pay wherein Clause to the\nbasic pay wherein Clause (5) refers to merger of\nDearness Allowance with basic pay is concerned, I\ndo not find any substance. The word 'adding of\nbasic pay', 'adding of Dearness Allowance' or the\nword 'merger of Dearness Allowance' with the\nbasic pay are synonymous. There is no difference\nin meaning with those two phrases. The ultimate\nresult is the same if such hyper technical\ninterpretation of these phrases is accepted it would\nresult in great injustice to one of the parties to the\ncontract. Moreover, they are not words used in\nany status. They are words used by the\nGovernment at one place and the respondents in\ntheir order. Moreover, in the subsequent order\npassed by the KSRTC they have understood the\nsaid word as merger and has given benefit to its\nemployees. Under the circumstance, I do not find\nany merit in the said contention also.\"\n\nAn intra-court appeal filed thereagainst by the appellant was\ndismissed.\n\nMr. G.E. Vahanvati, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of\nthe appellant, principally raised two contentions in support of this appeal:\n\n(i) The actual merger having taken place on 7.01.1999 upon revision\nof the scale of pay, the purported settlement dated 28.11.1995\ncould not have been construed differently.\n\n(ii) In any event, the purported merger of Dearness Allowance in\nrespect of the employees of the State was not binding on the\nCorporation.\n\nMr. L. Nageshwara Rao, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf\nof the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the amount of gratuity is\nrequired to be calculated in terms of\nSection 5\nof the Act and in that view of\nthe matter the rate prescribed therefor must be computed at par with the\nsettlement. The High Court, the learned counsel would contend, cannot be\nsaid to have committed any illegality in arriving at the said finding.\n\nThe Act\nwas enacted to provide for a scheme for payment of gratuity\nto employees engaged in factories, mines, oilfields, plantations, ports,\nrailway companies, etc. and for matters connected therewith or incidental\nthereto. Gratuity is payable in terms of\nSection 4\nof the Act to an employee\ninter alia on his superannuation after he has rendered continuous service for\nnot less than five years.\n\nSub-section (2) of\nSection 4\nof the Act envisages that for every\ncompleted year of service, the employer shall pay gratuity to an employee at\nthe rate of 15 days' wages based on the rate of wages last drawn by the\nemployee concerned. Sub-section (3) of\nSection 4\n, however, puts a ceiling\non the amount of gratuity being Rs. three lakhs and fifty thousand. Sub-\nsection (5) of\nSection 4\ninter alia provides that the provisions contained\ntherein shall not affect the right of an employee to receive better terms of\ngratuity under any award or agreement or contract with the employer.\n\nWhat is, therefore, payable by way of gratuity in terms of the scheme\nwas 30 days wages for each completed year of service.\n\n'Wages' has been defined in\nSection 2(s)\nof the Act in the following\nterms:\n\n\"\"wages\" means all emoluments which are earned\nby an employee while on duty or on leave in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of his\nemployment and which are paid or are payable to\nhim in cash and includes dearness allowance but\ndoes not include any bonus, commission, house\nrent allowance, overtime wages and any other\nallowance.\"\n\nWe have noticed hereinbefore that the Government of Karnataka in\nterms of Government Order dated 28.11.1995 inter alia directed that 90% of\nBasic Pay to be added to pay for calculating gratuity. If the basic pay of an\nemployee was upto Rs. 3500/- per month and was drawing a Dearness\nAllowance of Rs. 2000/-, what was to be added was the 90% of the Dearness\nAllowance which was being paid. If 90% of the Basic Pay as Dearness\nAllowance is to be added to the basic pay, the employee became entitled to\nhigher wages on the basis thereof. It is in that sense the question of\napplication of the merger of Dearness Allowance with the scale of pay arose\nfor all intent and purport. As was rightly held by the learned Single Judge,\ndifferent terminologies used did not make any material difference.\nSection 4\n\nof the Act itself contemplates implementation of a settlement. Settlement,\ntherefore, entered into by and between the parties was required to be\ninterpreted having regard to the intention of the parties. What was\ncontemplated by the parties was that the rates of Dearness Allowance would\nbe at par with the rate sanctioned by the State Government to its employees\nfrom time to time and from the same date. It was never contemplated that a\ndifferent amount of gratuity shall be payable to an employee who retires\nprior to the revision of scale of pay although the terms of the settlement are\napplicable to his case.\n\nWhat was necessary to be taken into account was the merger of any\nportion of the Dearness Allowance with pay which was being paid to its\nemployees. In such an event that portion of the Dearness Allowance was\nalso to be reckoned at appropriate level by the appellant for determining the\nquantum of Gratuity payable to its employees. The said settlement was\narrived at for calculating amount of gratuity payable to the employees of the\nappellant and not for any other purpose.\n\nIt is, therefore, not a case where the appellant could legitimately raise\na contention that any enhancement in the emoluments to its employees by\nthe State would not automatically enhance the emoluments of the employees\nof the appellant. It has been contended before us that the effect of the\nmerger and addition of Dearness Allowance would be different. It may be\nso. But, having regard to the fact of the present matter and the definition of\n'wages' under the Act, we need not go into the said question.\n\nWe have noticed hereinbefore that the contention may ordinarily be\napplicable to a case of merger of the basic pay vis-`-vis adding of Dearness\nAllowance to basic pay, but, herein the same would not make any\nsubstantive difference for the purpose of payment of gratuity keeping in\nview the definition of \"wages\" contained in\nSection 2(s)\nof the Act. It is not\na case where the scheme of the Corporation and the provisions of the Act are\ninconsistent with each other.\n\nIn\nBeed District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. State of\nMaharashtra & Ors.\n[2006 (10) SCALE 40], it was laid down:\n\n\"\u0005Undoubtedly, the Payment of Gratuity Act is a\nbeneficial statute. When two views are possible,\nhaving regard to the purpose, the Act seeks to\nachieve being a social welfare legislation, it may\nbe construed in favour of the workman. However,\nit is also trite that only because a statute is\nbeneficent in nature, the same would not mean that\nit should be construed in favour of the workmen\nonly although they are not entitled to benefits\nthereof.\"\n\nFor the reasons aforementioned, we are unable to agree with the\nsubmissions made by the learned Solicitor General that the consequences of\nmerger in a case of this nature shall be different in case of addition to the\nDearness Allowance in the scale of pay.\n\nKeeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the\nopinion that it is not a case where this Court should take a view different\nfrom that of the High Court. The Appeal is dismissed with costs. Counsel's\nfee assessed at Rs. 10,000/-.",
