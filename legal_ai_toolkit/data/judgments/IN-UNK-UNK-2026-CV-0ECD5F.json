It is not\n\n in dispute that all the writ petitioners are fully qualified for\n\n appointment either to the post of Pharmacists or to the post of\n\n Staff Nurses respectively.\n\n 3.The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\n writ petitioners made a submission that there was an\n\n administrative exigencies in the matter of providing medical\n\n facility in respect of the hospitals administered by Madurai\n\n Corporation. There was a ban during the relevant point of time to\n\n fill up the post of Pharmacists and Staff Nurses. Thus, the\n\n authorities competent of Madurai Corporation had taken a decision\n\n to engage temporary employees on contract basis, more\n\n specifically, to the posts of Pharmacists and Staff Nurses. Thus,\n\n initiation of process of appointment to these writ petitioners cannot\n\n be considered as illegal and the circumstances arose also made the\n\n authorities to invite applications for appointment to the posts of\n\n Pharmacists and Staff Nurses.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 4\n\n 4.The learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners\n\n in all these Writ Petitions are of the opinion that the appointment\n\n of the writ petitioners can never be held as illegal appointment and\n\n in fact, the process of appointment was undertaken by issuing\n\n recruitment notification through the Newspaper. The procedures\n\n were followed, selection was conducted, the writ petitioners\n\n participated in the selection of process, written examination was\n\n conducted, successful candidates were allowed to participate in\n\n the process of interview and thus, the writ petitioners were\n\n appointed through the established principles of selection and there\n\n is no illegality. The process of interview were conducted by the\n\n competent authorities and the orders of appointment were issued\n\n in proceeding dated 01.02.2006.\n\n 5.It is contended that though initial appointment of the\n\n writ petitioners were made on contract basis for one year, the writ\n\n petitioners were allowed to continue in service and now, they are\n\n in service for a considerable length of time. Some of the writ\n\n petitioners were already over aged, some of them already left the\n\n job. Under these circumstances, the benefit of regularization is to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 5\n\n be extended in favour of the writ petitioners, who are all\n\n continuing in service for a long period.\n\n \n6.The learned Senior Counsel for the writ petitioners\n\n relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\n\n the case of \nState of Orissa and another Vs. Mamata Mohanty\n\n reported in (2011) 4 MLJ 692 (SC), wherein it has been observed\n\n as follows:-\n\n “19.Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition\n that no person can be appointed even on a temporary\n or ad hoc basis without inviting applications from all\n eligible candidates. If any appointment is made by\n merely inviting names from the Employment Exchange\n or putting a note on the Notice Board etc., that will not\n meet the requirement of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n Constitution. Such a course violates the mandates of\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of India as it\n deprives the candidates who are eligible for the post,\n from being considered. A person employed in violation\n of these provisions is not entitled to any relief including\n salary. For a valid and legal appointment, mandatory\n compliance of the said Constitutional requirement is to\n be fulfilled. The equality clause enshrined in Article 16\n requires that every such appointment be made by an\n open advertisement as to enable all eligible persons to\n compete on merit.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 6\n\n \n7.In the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this\n\n Court, dated 29.04.2014 passed in W.A(MD)Nos.351, 911 and 908\n\n of 2012, the Hon'ble Division Bench has also granted a benefit of\n\n regularization by disagreeing with the applicability of the\n\n principles \nlaid down in\n the case of \nSecretary, State of Karnataka\n\n and others Vs. Umadevi and others\n reported in (2006) 4 SCC\n\n (1).\n\n \n8.The learned Senior Counsel is of an opinion that in the\n\n present case also the principles \nlaid down in\n \nUmadevi\n case need\n\n not be relied upon.\n \nThe facts and circumstances are different and\n\n therefore, the \nUmadevi\n case cannot be applied in the present case\n\n on hand and by relying the Division Bench's judgment, the benefit\n\n of regularization and permanent absorption is to be granted to all\n\n these writ petitioners.\n\n 9.The learned counsel appearing for some of the writ\n\n petitioners also supported the view expressed by the learned\n\n Senior Counsel and they have further added that the initial\n\n appointments were made with reference to the Madurai City\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 7\n\nMunicipal Corporation Act\n and further, initial appointment of these\n\n writ petitioners were not illegal, recruitment was made by\n\n following the procedures and the writ petitioners were allowed to\n\n continue in service for a considerable length of time. Thus, they\n\n are entitled for regularization and permanent absorption.\n\n 10.It is further contended that the benefit of\n\n regularization and permanent absorption were granted in respect\n\n of other similarly placed employees, who were initially appointed\n\n on contract basis for a specific tenure. When the benefit of\n\n regularization was granted in respect of other similarly placed\n\n employees, the same benefit is to be extended to the writ\n\n petitioners also.\n\n 11.The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing\n\n on behalf of the official respondents disputed the contentions\n\n raised by the writ petitioners by stating that by virtue of G.O.Ms.\n\n 212, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, dated\n\n 29.11.2001, there was a ban of employment by the Government\n\n during the relevant point of time. However, paper advertisement\n\n to the selection of post for Pharmacists and Staff Nurses, with a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 8\n\n specific condition of specific time period was issued on 15.06.2005,\n\n in order to meet out the emergency circumstances in Madurai\n\n Corporation Hospitals. Accordingly, the process of selection was\n\n conducted, specifically to appoint and fill up the post of\n\n Pharmacists and Staff Nurses on contract basis for a period of one\n\n year. Thus, the very process of selection was undertaken on\n\n temporary basis for the purpose of meeting out the emergency\n\n circumstances and therefore, the writ petitioners cannot now claim\n\n regularization or permanent absorption contrary to the conditions\n\n of appointment made, which was accepted by all the writ\n\n petitioners.\n\n 12.The writ petitioners on expiry of one year period\n\n submitted representations seeking regularization on 29.05.2006.\n\n The Corporation also recommended the case of these writ\n\n petitioners to the Government on 24.07.2006. However, the\n\n Government rejected the proposal on 30.10.2006 itself. The claim\n\n of the writ petitioners for regularization and permanent absorption\n\n was rejected by the Government without any lapse of time, by\n\n order dated 30.10.2006. The order states that “request of the\n\n medical personnels appointed on contract basis in Madurai and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 9\n\n Tiruchirapalli Corporations for regularisation of their services and\n\n appointment in regular time scale of pay in permanent vacancies is\n\n rejected by the Government”. In another letter dated 03.04.2007,\n\n the Government made an observation as follows:-\n\n “the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation has\n requested to accord permission to extend the contract\n period of the Medical personnel appointed on contract\n basis for a further period of one year. In your letter\n third cited, it has been stated that there is no\n justification in the proposal and the proposal may be\n rejected and the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation\n may be directed to fill up the posts as per rules as\n already instructed.”\n\n 13.Thus, even during the year 2007, the claim of the writ\n\n petitioners for regularization was rejected. The Government has\n\n directed the Commissioner, Madurai Corporation to fill up the\n\n posts by following the recruitment rules in force. Such instructions\n\n were already granted to Madurai Corporation also.\n\n 14.The repeated proposals sent by Madurai Corporation\n\n for grant of regularization were consistently rejected by the\n\n Government and the final rejection order was issued in proceeding\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 10\n\n dated 05.06.2014, which is now under challenge in some of the\n\n Writ Petitions.\n\n 15.Based on the rejection order of the Government, the\n\n Madurai Corporation also passed resolution Nos.682 and 683 of\n\n 2014, dated 31.07.2014, rejecting the appointment Committee\n\n Resolution dated 17.10.2013. Thus, the benefit of regularization\n\n and permanent absorption cannot be granted to the writ\n\n petitioners and they have to secure appointment only by\n\n participating in the open competitive process, whenever the\n\n recruitment notification is issued for regular appointment in\n\n accordance with the recruitment rules in force.\n\n 16.The learned Additional Government Pleader made a\n\n submission that at no point of time, the Government extended any\n\n scope for grant of regularization to these contract employees and\n\n right from the date of expiry of the period of one year contract, the\n\n Government rejected the claim for regularization. A constant view\n\n was taken by the Government by stating that the recruitment rules\n\n ought to be followed. However, it was stated that the appointment\n\n on contract basis for a period of one year had not been done in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 11\n\n accordance with the recruitment rules in force. The rule of\n\n reservation was not followed and therefore, such appointments\n\n cannot be considered as made under the constitutional schemes.\n\n 17.Considering the arguments of the respective learned\n\n counsel appearing both for the writ petitioners and the\n\n respondents, this Court is of the considered opinion that the relief\n\n in such nature of cases ought to be granted, considering the social\n\n implications as well as the constitutional principles. It is not as if\n\n the constitutional Courts can issue directions to regularize the\n\n service to these contract employees appointed for one year. In the\n\n event of granting such reliefs in number of litigations, undoubtedly\n\n it will infringe the rights of the lakhs and lakhs of citizens, whose\n\n constitutional rights are also to be equally protected. The\n\n principles of “social justice” enunciated in the Constitution require,\n\n while granting constitutional remedies the Courts to follow the\n\n principles consistently, so as to avoid all illegality or irregularity in\n\n public appointments.\n\n 18.The illegality or irregularity, corrupt activities in\n\n public appointments are minimized, then, we are marching\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 12\n\n towards the achievement of the constitutional goals. If we can able\n\n to reduce the illegality or irregularity in public appointments,\n\n undoubtedly, we are proceeding towards efficient administration.\n\n Efficient administration is essential for the development of our\n\n great Nation. Thus, transparency as well as consistency in public\n\n appointments in accordance with the recruitment rules are\n\n paramount importance. Only through following these basic\n\n aspects, the State Government achieves the constitution goals and\n\n fulfils directive principles.\n\n 19.If many number of illegal or irregular appointments\n\n are allowed, that efficiency level in public administration would be\n\n descending. Once efficiency is lost, then developmental activities\n\n will also slow down. Under these circumstances, constitutional\n\n Court plays major role in preventing the authorities from making\n\n such illegal appointments. It is duty mandatory on the part of the\n\n constitutional Courts to ensure that the public authorities make\n\n appointment only under constitutional schemes and by following\n\n the recruitment rules in force and by providing equal opportunity\n\n to all eligible candidates, who are all aspiring to secure public\n\n employment through open competitive process. Thus, in the cases\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 13\n\n of such nature, the Courts cannot carry away with the sympathy of\n\n certain facts like continuance of service for few years or otherwise.\n\n Such facts made a ground for showing of misplaced sympathy and\n\n leniency. Such nature of cases will infringe the constitutional\n\n rights of larger sector and thereby, would cause damage to the\n\n efficiency level in public administration. However, the elements in\n\n this regard are important and appointments are to be made strictly\n\n in accordance with the rules in force.\n\n 20.This apart, the appointments of the writ petitioners\n\n were made as per the notification issued on 15.06.2005. On a\n\n perusal of the notification, it is stated in clear terms that “the\n\n tenure shall be for one year initially and if both parties agree, it is\n\n extendable for another two years. It is further stated that initial\n\n appointment is for one year on contract basis. The order of\n\n appointment dated 01.02.2006 also enumerates as follows:-\n\n “1)The Contract period shall be for one year\n from the date of joining (if both parties agree, it is\n extendable for another two years)\n\n 2)You cannot claim any seniority or regular\n time scale\n\n 3)You have to work in the hospital from 8.00\n AM to 5.00 PM with one hour lunch break, between\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 14\n\n 1.00 PM to 2.00 PM.”\n\n 21.The appointment order enumerates that contract\n\n period shall be for one year from the date of joining and they\n\n cannot claim any seniority or regular time scale of pay. Therefore,\n\n the writ petitioners were very much aware of the conditions\n\n imposed in the appointment order. They joined the post by\n\n accepting the conditions of service. Once the petitioners had\n\n accepted the conditions of service and joined in the post, thereafter,\n\n they cannot turn around and say that they are entitled for\n\n regularisation and permanent absorption.\n\n 22.The growing trends across the Country in various\n\n States are that the people try to get appointment from various\n\n sources, which all are not in accordance with the recruitment rules\n\n in force. Once they enter into public services through some other\n\n sources on temporary contract basis, daily wage basis etc.,\n\n thereafter, they are making attempt to continue in service for a\n\n considerable length of time. After working for some years, they are\n\n attempting to get regularisation and permanent absorption.\n\n However, they do not remember that their initial appointments\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 15\n\n were not in accordance with the recruitment rules in force. Such\n\n practice of securing public appointments on contract basis ought to\n\n be deprecated and the Constitutional Courts cannot encourage\n\n such back door entries to the public service. All eligible candidates\n\n must keep in mind that they should enter into the public services\n\n under the Constitutional schemes and by participating in the open\n\n competitive process in accordance with the recruitment rules in\n\n force.\n\n 23.Another question raises in the mind of the Court is that\n\n if a public servant enters into the Government service through such\n\n methods, which is not in accordance with the rules in force, then,\n\n how such a public servant will be honest and maintain honesty and\n\n integrity. Therefore, all these aspects are very much important in\n\n the social prospective. Persons who enter into the public service\n\n through back door entry and this Court is of the undoubted opinion\n\n that public cannot accept the level of honesty or integrity from such\n\n public servant. If this being the factum, then, the efficiency level is\n\n also damaged. Under these circumstances, the appointments are\n\n made in accordance with the recruitment rules in force not only to\n\n maintain the efficiency level in public administration, but for the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 16\n\n purpose of providing better services to the people of this great\n\n nation. All these aspects are interlinked. We cannot accept this\n\n method of appointment with less efficiency level as well as corrupt\n\n activities. All these aspects once interlinked, we have to be\n\n cautious in allowing such regularisation or permanent absorption in\n\n violation of the recruitment rules in force.\n\n 24.As far as the present Writ Petitions are concerned, the\n\n Government consistently, disallowed the claim of the writ\n\n petitioners even in the final rejection order dated 05.06.2014. The\n\n Government in the impugned order stated as follows:-\n\n “4.The requests of the time individual and\n the proposal of the Commissioner of Municipal\n Administration have already been received and\n examined by the Government. With reference to the\n recommendation of the Commissioner, Madurai\n Corporation dated 24.07.2006 the Government\n examined the issue and rejected the same vide\n Government letter No.31783/MC.IV/2006-1 dated\n 30.10.2006. Again the request of the Commissioner\n of Madurai Corporation for extending their contract\n period for one more year was also rejected vide\n Government letter No.35807/MC IV/2006 dated\n 3.4.2007 and the petitions filed by them in 2007,\n were also dismissed the High Court on 3.4.2009.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 17\n\n Further the request of the individuals submitted\n through the Mayor of Madurai addressed to the\n Hon'ble Minister has been rejected in Letter (D)\n No.276, Municipal Administration and Water\n Supply Department, dated 24.06.2009.\n\n 5.In this connection, it is informed that the\n above recruitment were done during the ban period\n without observing the orders issued in G.O.(Ms)No.\n 212, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\n Department dated 29.11.2001. They were appointed\n on contract periods for a period of one year only\n which was indicated in their appointment order itself\n it is also pointed out that the above recruitments\n were made without consulting the Employment\n Exchange and without following the Rule of\n Reservation while directly, recruitment them.”\n\n 25.The contentions of the writ petitioners that the\n\n appointment of the writ petitioners were continued even through\n\n order dated 18.10.2013, deserve no further consideration, in view\n\n of the fact that all these writ petitioners were allowed to continue\n\n in service based on the interim order granted by this Court and by\n\n filing these writ petitions. The earlier Writ Petition was dismissed\n\n with liberty and the rejection subsequently, passed was challenged\n\n by the writ petitioner by way of another writ petition. In all these\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 18\n\n writ petitions, interim order were granted and based on the interim\n\n order, the writ petitioners were allowed to continue in service.\n\n 26.Even paragraph No.53 of the judgment of the\n\n Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the\n\n case of Umadevi clarifies that mere continuance of such litigious\n\n employments cannot be a ground for grant of regularisation and\n\n permanent absorption in violation of the recruitment rules in force.\n\n Thus, mere continuance of the writ petitioners beyond the period of\n\n contract cannot be a ground for the purpose of grant of\n\n regularisation, in view of the fact that they are continuing the\n\n service based on the litigation pending before the High Court and\n\n based on the interim order granted.\n\n \n27.This Court also elaborately discussed the legal\n\n principles settled by the Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India in the case of Umadevi in W.P.Nos.28633 to\n\n 28646 of 2014, dated 12.12.2017, beyond the \nUmadevi\n case\n\n binding nature of principles are also to be considered by this Court,\n\n in view of the fact that the writ petitioners raised a ground that the\n\n principles \nlaid down by\n the Constitution Bench is not applicable to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 19\n\n the present cases on hand.\n\n 28.As far as the present Writ Petitions are concerned, it is\n\n an admitted fact that the writ petitioners were appointed on\n\n contract basis for one year and no extension was granted. They\n\n continued in service, by virtue of the interim order granted by this\n\n Court. This apart, the rule of reservation was not followed during\n\n the selection for appointment to the post of Pharmacists and Staff\n\n Nurses. When the rule of reservation is not followed, such\n\n appointments are declared unconstitutional and in violation of the\n\n recruitment rules in force. Undoubtedly, even in respect of these\n\n irregular appointments, this Court is of the considered opinion that\n\n regularisation cannot be granted in violation of the legal principles\n\n settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In this case, an amount of\n\n illegality is also interfered, in view of the fact that the rule of\n\n reservation was not followed at the time of appointing the writ\n\n petitioners. Once the rule of reservation is not followed,\n\n undoubtedly, all such appointments are to be declared\n\n unconstitutional, in view of the fact that the rule of reservation is\n\n fundamental right of the citizen.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 20\n\n 29.The relevant paragraphs of the judgment passed in\n\n W.P.Nos.28633 to 28646 of 2014, dated 12.12.2017 are extracted\n\n hereunder:-\n\n “36. Before considering the subject of\n regularization and permanent absorption, this Court\n has to consider the interpretation of the judgments on\n “binding nature” or “binding precedent” . In view of\n the fact that the learned counsel for the petitioner has\n cited number of judgments, which were passed\n subsequent to the Constitution Bench judgment,\n stating that Paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\n has been interpreted in different ways and under\n different circumstances and the present case is also to\n be considered and a direction to be issued for\n regularization. In view of the fact that large number\n of judgments are cited before this Court in the matter\n of regularization and permanent absorption, now, this\n Court has to first decide what all are the judgments\n which all are having a “binding precedent” and on this\n reason, this Court has to consider very interpretation\n of the concept regarding “binding precedent”. \nIn\n respect of judgments in relation to the interpretation\n of “binding precedent”, this Court is inclined to\n consider the very recent judgment of the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court of India in the case of \nNational\n Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n,\n reported in JT 2017 (10) SC 450. It is pertinent to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 21\n\n note that it is a judgment by the Constitution Bench of\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India headed by His\n Lordship, Hon'ble Chief Justice of India, Dipak\n Misra.CJI,. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of India\n delivered this judgment and it is relevant to quote\n paragraphs (15 to 26):\n\n “15. The aforesaid analysis in Santosh Devi (supra)\n may prima facie show that the two-Judge Bench has\n distinguished the observation made in Sarla Verma’s\n case but on a studied scrutiny, it becomes clear that it\n has really expressed a different view than what has\n been laid down in Sarla Verma (supra). If we permit\n ourselves to say so, the different view has been\n expressed in a distinctive tone, for the two-Judge\n Bench had stated that it was extremely difficult to\n fathom any rationale for the observations made in para\n 24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma’s case in respect of\n self-employed or a person on fixed salary without\n provision for annual increment, etc. This is a clear\n disagreement with the earlier view, and we have no\n hesitation in saying that it is absolutely impermissible\n keeping in view the concept of binding precedents.\n\n 16. Presently, we may refer to certain\n decisions which deal with the concept of binding\n precedent.\n\n 17. \nIn \nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n alias\n Kalika Singh and others [JT (2003) (4) SC 489], it\n has been held:-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 22\n\n “10. … an earlier decision may seem to be\n incorrect to a Bench of a coordinate jurisdiction\n considering the question later, on the ground that a\n possible aspect of the matter was not considered or not\n raised before the court or more aspects should have\n been gone into by the court deciding the matter earlier\n but it would not be a reason to say that the decision\n was rendered per incuriam and liable to be ignored.\n The earlier judgment may seem to be not correct yet it\n will have the binding effect on the later Bench of\n coordinate jurisdiction. …”\n\n 17.1.The Court has further ruled:-“10. …\n Easy course of saying that earlier decision was\n rendered per incuriam is not permissible and the\n matter will have to be resolved only in two ways —\n either to follow the earlier decision or refer the matter\n to a larger Bench to examine the issue, in case it is felt\n that earlier decision is not correct on merits.”\n\n 18. \nIn \nG.L. Batra v. State of Haryana and\n others\n (2014) 13 SCC 759), the Court has accepted\n the said principle on the basis of judgments of this\n Court rendered in \nUnion of India v. Godfrey Philips\n India Ltd.\n (\n1985) 4 SCC 369), Sundarjas Kanyalal\n Bhatija v. Collector, Thane, Maharashtra\n (\n1989) 3\n SCC 396)and Tribhovandas Purshottamdas\n Thakkar v. Ratilal Motilal Patel\n (AIR 1968 SC 372).\n\n \nIt may be noted here that the Constitution Bench in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 23\n\nMadras Bar Association v. Union of India and\n another\n [JT 2015(5)SC 33]has clearly stated that the\n prior Constitution Bench judgment in \nUnion of India\n v. Madras Bar Association [JT\n 2010 (5) SC 553]is a\n binding precedent. Be it clarified, the issues that were\n put to rest in the earlier Constitution Bench judgment\n were treated as precedents by latter Constitution\n Bench.\n\n 19. In this regard, we may refer to a passage\n from Jaisri Sahu v. Rajdewan Dubey (AIR 1962 SC\n\n 83):-\n\n “11. Law will be bereft of all its utility if it\n should be thrown into a state of uncertainty by reason\n of conflicting decisions, and it is therefore desirable\n that in case of difference of opinion, the question\n should be authoritatively settled. It sometimes happens\n that an earlier decision given by a Bench is not\n brought to the notice of a Bench hearing the same\n question, and a contrary decision is given without\n reference to the earlier decision. The question has also\n been discussed as to the correct procedure to be\n followed when two such conflicting decisions are\n placed before a later Bench. The practice in the Patna\n High Court appears to be that in those cases, the\n earlier decision is followed and not the later. In\n England the practice is, as noticed in the judgment in\n Seshamma v. Venkata Narasimharao that the decision\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 24\n\n of a court of appeal is considered as a general rule to\n be binding on it. There are exceptions to it, and one of\n them is thus stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd\n Edn., Vol. 22, para 1687, pp. 799-800:\n\n “The court is not bound to follow a decision of\n its own if given per incuriam. A decision is given per\n incuriam when the court has acted in ignorance of a\n previous decision of its own or of a Court of a co-\n ordinate jurisdiction which covered the case before it,\n or when it has acted in ignorance of a decision of the\n House of Lords. In the former case it must decide\n which decision to follow, and in the latter it is bound by\n the decision of the House of Lords.”In Virayya v.\n Venkata Subbayya it has been held by the Andhra\n High Court that under the circumstances aforesaid the\n Bench is free to adopt that view which is in accordance\n with justice and legal principles after taking into\n consideration the views expressed in the two\n conflicting Benches, vide also the decision of the\n Nagpur High Court in Bilimoria v. Central Bank of\n India. The better course would be for the Bench\n hearing the case to refer the matter to a Full Bench in\n view of the conflicting authorities without taking upon\n itself to decide whether it should follow the one Bench\n decision or the other. We have no doubt that when such\n situations arise, the Bench hearing cases would refer\n the matter for the decision of a Full Court.”\n\n 20. Though the aforesaid was articulated in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 25\n\n the context of the High Court, yet this Court has been\n following the same as is revealed from the aforestated\n pronouncements including that of the Constitution\n Bench and, therefore, we entirely agree with the said\n view because it is the precise warrant of respecting a\n precedent which is the fundamental norm of judicial\n discipline.\n\n 21. \nIn the context, we may fruitfully note\n what has been stated in \nPradip Chandra Parija and\n others v. Pramod Chandra Patnaik and others\n [JT\n (2002) 5 SCC 23]. In the said case, the Constitution\n Bench was dealing with a situation where the two-\n Judge Bench disagreeing with the three-Judge Bench\n decision directed the matter to be placed before a\n larger Bench of five Judges of this Court. In that\n scenario, the Constitution Bench stated:-“6. … In our\n view, judicial discipline and propriety demands that a\n Bench of two learned Judges should follow a decision\n of a Bench of three learned Judges. But if a Bench of\n two learned Judges concludes that an earlier judgment\n of three learned Judges is so very incorrect that in no\n circumstances can it be followed, the proper course for\n it to adopt is to refer the matter before it to a Bench of\n three learned Judges setting out, as has been done\n here, the reasons why it could not agree with the\n earlier judgment. …\n\n 22. In Chandra Prakash and others v.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 26\n\n State of U.P. and another [JT (2002) (3) SC 493],\n another Constitution Bench dealing with the concept of\n precedents stated thus:-\n\n “22. … The doctrine of binding precedent is of\n utmost importance in the administration of our judicial\n system. It promotes certainty and consistency in\n judicial decisions. Judicial consistency promotes\n confidence in the system, therefore, there is this need\n for consistency in the enunciation of legal principles in\n the decisions of this Court. It is in the above context,\n this Court in the case of Raghubir Singh (1989) 2 SCC\n\n 754)held that a pronouncement of law by a Division\n Bench of this Court is binding on a Division Bench of\n the same or smaller number of Judges. …\n\n 23. Be it noted, Chandra Prakash concurred\n with the view expressed in Raghubir Singh and\n Pradip Chandra Parija.\n\n 24. In Sandhya Educational Society and\n another v. Union of India and others (2014) 7 SCC\n\n 701), it has been observed that judicial decorum and\n discipline is paramount and, therefore, a coordinate\n Bench has to respect the judgments and orders passed\n by another coordinate Bench. \nIn \nRattiram and others\n v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n (2012) 4 SCC 516), the\n Court dwelt upon the issue what would be the\n consequent effect of the latter decision which had been\n rendered without noticing the earlier decisions.\n \nThe\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 27\n\n Court noted the observations in Raghubir Singh\n (supra) and reproduced a passage from \nIndian Oil\n Corporation Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation\n (1995)\n 4 SCC 96)which is to the following effect:-“8.\n \n… The\n Division Bench of the High Court in \nMunicipal Corpn.,\n Indore v. Ratnaprabha Dhanda\n was clearly in error in\n taking the view that the decision of this Court in\n Ratnaprabha was not binding on it. In doing so, the\n Division Bench of the High Court did something which\n even a later coequal Bench of this Court did not and\n could not do. …\n\n 25. It also stated what has been expressed in\n Raghubir Singh (supra) by R.S. Pathak, C.J. It is as\n follows:-“28. We are of opinion that a pronouncement\n of law by a Division Bench of this Court is binding on a\n Division Bench of the same or a smaller number of\n Judges, and in order that such decision be binding, it is\n not necessary that it should be a decision rendered by\n the Full Court or a Constitution Bench of the Court. …”\n\n 26. In Rajesh (supra) the three-Judge Bench\n had delivered the judgment on 12.04.2013. The\n purpose of stating the date is that it has been delivered\n after the pronouncement made in Reshma Kumari’s\n case. On a perusal of the decision in Rajesh (supra),\n we find that an attempt has been made to explain what\n the two- Judge Bench had stated in Santosh Devi\n (supra). The relevant passages read as follows:-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 28\n\n “8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case\n actually intended to follow the principle in the case of\n salaried persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and\n to make it applicable also to the self-employed and\n persons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the increase\n in the case of those groups is not 30% always; it will\n also have a reference to the age. In other words, in the\n case of self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in\n case, the deceased victim was below 40 years, there\n must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of the\n deceased while computing future prospects. Needless\n to say that the actual income should be income after\n paying the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case\n the deceased was in the age group of 40 to 50 years.9.\n In Sarla Verma case, it has been stated that in the\n case of those above 50 years, there shall be no\n addition. Having regard to the fact that in the case of\n those self-employed or on fixed wages, where there is\n normally no age of superannuation, we are of the view\n that it will only be just and equitable to provide an\n addition of 15% in the case where the victim is\n between the age group of 50 to 60 years so as to make\n the compensation just, equitable, fair and reasonable.\n There shall normally be no addition thereafter.”\n\n 37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court of India, while dealing with the cases\n of accident claims, has elaborately discussed about the\n “binding precedent”. The case in relation to the Motor\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 29\n\n Accident Claims, the case of “Sarla Verma” was being\n followed by all the Courts across the Country for the\n purpose of awarding compensation. When the\n question arosed that the “binding nature” of the said\n case of “Sarla Verma” delivered by the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court of India, the Constitution Bench\n headed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India held that\n the principles laid down in the case of “Virayya v.\n\n \nVenkata Subbayya” , it has been held by the Andhra\n Pradesh High Court that under the circumstances\n aforesaid the Bench is free to adopt that view which is\n in accordance with justice and legal principles after\n taking into consideration the views expressed in the\n two conflicting Benches, it is further held that in the\n case of \nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n alias Kalika\n Singh and others, reported in [JT (2003) 4 SC\n 489], held that the earlier judgment may seem to be\n not correct yet it will have the binding effect on the\n later Bench of coordinate jurisdiction.\n \nTheir Lordships\n rendered the case of \nChandra Prakash and others v.\n State of U.P. and another\n, reported in [JT 2002\n (3) SC 493], held that the doctrine of binding\n precedent is of utmost importance in the\n administration of our judicial system. It promotes\n certainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial\n consistency promotes confidence in the system,\n therefore, there is this need for consistency in the\n enunciation of legal principles in the decisions of this\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 30\n\n Court.\n\n 38. By enumerating the legal principle in this\n regard, the Apex Court of India held that the judgment\n by the Larger Bench of the Courts are to be treated as\n “binding precedent”, while deciding the legal\n principles involved in the particular case.\n\n 39. Another Constitution Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Padma\n Sundara Rao and Others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n and others, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 533, and the\n relevant paragraph (9) of the Judgment is extracted\n hereunder:\n\n “9. Courts should not place reliance on\n decisions without discussing as to how the factual\n situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision\n on which reliance is placed. There is always peril in\n treating the words of a speech or judgment as though\n they are words in a legislative enactment, and it is to\n be remembered that judicial utterances are made in\n the setting of the facts of a particular case, said Lord\n Morris in Herrington v. British Railways Board [(1972)\n 2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC 877 (HL) [Sub nom British\n Railways Board v. Herrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749\n (HL)]] . Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or\n different fact may make a world of difference between\n conclusions in two cases.”\n\n 40. In view of the legal principle settled in\n the matter of “binding precedent”, now, this Court is\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 31\n\n bound by the legal principles settled by the\n Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n India in the “Umadevi Case”. Admittedly, there is no\n other subsequent Constitution Bench judgment in\n respect of the subject of regularization and permanent\n absorption. The last judgment rendered by the\n Constitution Bench in the subject matter is “Umadevi\n Case”. Thus, the legal principles settled by the\n Constitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” are of\n “binding precedent” or to be followed as “binding\n precedent”. Thus, the facts and circumstances of the\n present writ petition has to be considered only in the\n light of the principles laid down by the Constitution\n Bench. All other judgments subsequently passed by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India may have certain\n distinctions far and against. However, these\n judgments are to be interpreted only based on the\n facts and circumstances prevailing in that particular\n case and therefore, this Court cannot consider those\n judgments delivered on a particular facts in relation to\n that particular case. However, the legal principles are\n to be considered in relation to the facts and\n circumstances of the present case on hand.\n\n 41. Let us look into the basic principles\n enunciated by the Constitution Bench in the matter of\n regularization and permanent absorption. Paragraph\n (5) of the “Umadevi Case” is extracted hereunder:\n\n “5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 32\n\n which could not be said to be consistent with the\n constitutional scheme of public employment. Such\n directions are issued presumably on the basis of\n equitable considerations or individualisation of justice.\n The question arises, equity to whom? Equity for the\n handful of people who have approached the court with\n a claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this\n country seeking employment and seeking a fair\n opportunity for competing for employment? When one\n side of the coin is considered, the other side of the coin\n has also to be considered and the way open to any\n court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law as laid\n down by the Constitution and not to make directions,\n which at times, even if do not run counter to the\n constitutional scheme, certainly tend to water down\n the constitutional requirements. It is this conflict that\n is reflected in these cases referred to the Constitution\n Bench”\n\n 42. This Court wants to look into the very\n findings made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n in the above said paragraph (5), the Apex Court has\n conceded that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had\n also on occasions, issued directions, which could not\n be said to be consistent with the Constitutional\n schemes of public employment. Such directions are\n issued presumably on the basis of equitable\n considerations or individualisation of justice. The\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India raised a question that\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 33\n\n equity to whom? Equity for the handful of people who\n have approached the Court with the claim, or equity\n for the teeming millions of this Country seeking\n employment and seeking a fair opportunity for\n competing for employment? When one side of the coin\n is considered, the other side of the coin has also to be\n considered and the way open to any Court of law or\n justice, is to adhere to the law as laid down by the\n Constitution and not to make directions, which at\n times, even if do not run counter to the constitutional\n scheme, certainly tend to water down the\n constitutional requirements. It is this Conflict that\n reflected in these cases referred to the Constitution\n Bench.\n\n 43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong\n concern recorded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n India. The concern raised by the Constitution Bench is\n that by granting relief to a handful of people, the large\n sector of meritorious youth of this great nation cannot\n be deprived of their constitutional rights. Under this\n pretext, the Constitution Bench commenced its\n consideration in “Umadevi Case”. Thus, the very\n enumeration in the above paragraph is crystal clear\n that the Constitution Bench has laid down the principle\n in the matter of regularization and permanent\n absorption and the idea of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n of India has to stop the practice of appointing\n employees, through back door on extraneous\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 34\n\n consideration by showing favoritism and nepotism.\n\n 44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the “Umadevi\n Case” is extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“10. When these matters came up before a\n Bench of two Judges, the learned Judges referred the\n cases to a Bench of three Judges. The order of\n reference is reported in \nSecy., State of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (1) [(2004) 7 SCC 132 : 2004 SCC (L&S)\n 935 : (2003) 9 Scale 187] . This Court noticed that in\n the matter of regularisation of ad hoc employees, there\n were conflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of\n this Court and by two-Judge Benches and hence the\n question required to be considered by a larger Bench.\n\n \nWhen the matters came up before a three-Judge\n Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter required\n consideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the\n conflict and in the light of the arguments raised by the\n Additional Solicitor General. The order of reference is\n reported in \nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (2)\n [(2006) 4 SCC 44 : (2003) 10 Scale 388] . It appears to\n be proper to quote that order of reference at this\n stage.

Ganesh Rao\n [(2001) 4 Kant LJ 466 (DB)] , decided\n on 1-6-2001 the learned Additional Solicitor General\n urged that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant\n to \nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\n and \n335\n of the Constitution\n and, therefore, these cases are required to be heard by\n a Bench of five learned Judges (Constitution Bench).\n\n 2. On the other hand, Mr M.C. Bhandare, learned\n Senior Counsel, appearing for the employees urged\n that such a scheme for regularisation is consistent with\n the provisions of \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n of the Constitution.\n\n 3. Mr V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing\n in CCs Nos. 109-498 of 2003, has filed the GO dated\n 19-7-2002 and submitted that the orders have already\n been implemented.\n\n 4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 36\n\n between the three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court,\n we are of the view that these cases are required to be\n heard by a Bench of five learned Judges.\n\n 5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the\n Chief Justice for appropriate orders.”\n We are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue\n here. We have to lay down the law. We have to\n approach the question as a constitutional court\n should.”\n\n 45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates\n that there were conflicting decisions by three-Judge\n Benches of this Court and by two-Judge Benches of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and therefore, the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has considered that\n the question required to be considered by a larger\n Bench. It is further observed that when the matters\n came up before a three-Judge Bench, the Bench in turn\n felt that the matter required consideration by a\n Constitution Bench in view of the conflict and in the\n light of the arguments raised by the Additional\n Solicitor General. In the reference made by the\n Hon'ble three-Judge Bench itself decided that the\n scheme for regularisation is repugnant to \nArticles\n 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\n and \n335\n of the Constitution and,\n therefore, these cases are required to be heard by a\n Bench of five learned Judges(Constitution Bench).\n\n 46. In paragraph (11) of the “Umadevi\n Case”, it is stated that in addition to the equality\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 37\n\n clause represented by \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution,\n \nArticle 16\n has specifically provided for equality of\n opportunity in matters of public employment.\n Buttressing these fundamental rights, \nArticle 309\n\n provides that subject to the provisions of the\n Constitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate the\n recruitment and conditions of service of persons\n appointed to public services and posts in connection\n with the affairs of the Union or of a State.\n\n 47. In view of the interpretation placed on\n \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution by this Court, obviously,\n these principles also govern the instrumentalities that\n come within the purview of \nArticle 12\n of the\n Constitution. With a view to make the procedure for\n selection fair, the Constitution by \nArticle 315\n has also\n created a Public Service Commission for the Union and\n the Public Service Commissions for the States. \nArticle\n 320\n deals with the functions of the Public Service\n Commissions and mandates consultation with the\n Commission on all matters relating to methods of\n recruitment to civil services and for civil posts and\n other related matters. As a part of the affirmative\n action recognised by \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution,\n \nArticle 335\n provides for special consideration in the\n matter of claims of the members of the Scheduled\n Castes and Scheduled Tribes for employment.\n\n 48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the“Umadevi\n Case” reads as follows:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 38\n\n “12. In spite of this scheme, there may be occasions\n when the sovereign State or its instrumentalities will\n have to employ persons, in posts which are temporary,\n on daily wages, as additional hands or taking them in\n without following the required procedure, to discharge\n the duties in respect of the posts that are sanctioned\n and that are required to be filled in terms of the\n relevant procedure established by the Constitution or\n for work in temporary posts or projects that are not\n needed permanently. This right of the Union or of the\n State Government cannot but be recognised and there\n is nothing in the Constitution which prohibits such\n engaging of persons temporarily or on daily wages, to\n meet the needs of the situation. But the fact that such\n engagements are resorted to, cannot be used to defeat\n the very scheme of public employment. Nor can a court\n say that the Union or the State Governments do not\n have the right to engage persons in various capacities\n for a duration or until the work in a particular project\n is completed. Once this right of the Government is\n recognised and the mandate of the constitutional\n requirement for public employment is respected, there\n cannot be much difficulty in coming to the conclusion\n that it is ordinarily not proper for the Courts whether\n acting under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution or under\n \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution, to direct absorption in\n permanent employment of those who have been\n engaged without following a due process of selection\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 39\n\n as envisaged by the constitutional scheme.”\n\n 49. The spirit of Paragraph (12) of the\n “Umadevi Case” judgment is that the temporary\n engagements like daily wage appointments,\n consolidated pay appointments and temporary\n appointments and engagements are resorted to, cannot\n be used to defeat the very scheme of public\n employment. Nor can a Court say that the Union or\n the State Governments do not have the right to engage\n persons in various capacities for a duration or until the\n work in a particular project is completed. Once this\n right of the Government is recognised and the mandate\n of the constitutional requirement for public\n employment is respected, there cannot be much\n difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is\n ordinarily not proper for the Courts, whether acting\n under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution or under \nArticle\n 32\n of the Constitution, to direct absorption in\n permanent employment of those who have been\n engaged without following a due process of selection\n as envisaged by the constitutional scheme. Thus, it is\n made clear by the Constitutional Bench that regular\n recruitment rules in force, followed scrupulously by\n the competent authorities and engagements on\n temporary basis cannot be resorted or the same cannot\n lead to permanent absorption or regularization.\n Further, it is stated that the Government is entitled to\n appoint the persons on daily wages/consolidated\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 40\n\n pay/temporary basis, if a Government is of the opinion\n that a project has to be implemented or a special\n works to be carried out, then they are at liberty to do\n so, by engaging the temporary employees. Such being\n the concept accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n India, no doubt, a mere appointment on\n temporary/daily wage basis cannot constitute a right\n for the employees to claim regularization or permanent\n absorption.\n\n 50. Further, Paragraph (13) of the “Umadevi\n Case” judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n “13. What is sought to be pitted against this approach,\n is the so-called equity arising out of giving of\n temporary employment or engagement on daily wages\n and the continuance of such persons in the engaged\n work for a certain length of time. Such considerations\n can have only a limited role to play, when every\n qualified citizen has a right to apply for appointment,\n the adoption of the concept of rule of law and the\n scheme of the Constitution for appointment to posts. It\n cannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of the\n courts to ignore, encourage or approve appointments\n made or engagements given outside the constitutional\n scheme. In effect, orders based on such sentiments or\n approach would result in perpetuating illegalities and\n in the jettisoning of the scheme of public employment\n adopted by us while adopting the Constitution. The\n approving of such acts also results in depriving many\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 41\n\n of their opportunity to compete for public employment.\n We have, therefore, to consider the question\n objectively and based on the constitutional and\n statutory provisions. \nIn this context, we have also to\n bear in mind the exposition of law by a Constitution\n Bench in \nState of Punjab v. Jagdip Singh\n [(1964) 4 SCR\n 964 : AIR 1964 SC 521] .\n It was held therein: (SCR pp.\n\n 971-72)\n “In our opinion where a government servant has no\n right to a post or to a particular status, though an\n authority under the Government acting beyond its\n competence had purported to give that person a status\n which it was not entitled to give he will not in law be\n deemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\n given the particular status.”\n\n 51. This Court cannot omit the powerful\n statement made by the Constitution Bench in respect\n of providing equal opportunity and in respect of\n implementing the equality clause enshrined under\n \nArticle 14\n \n& 16\n of the Constitution. In the above said\n paragraph (13), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n has emphasized that it cannot also be forgotten that it\n is not the role of the Courts to ignore, encourage or\n approve appointments made or engagements given\n outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders\n based on such sentiments or approach would result in\n perpetuating illegalities and in the jettisoning of the\n scheme of public employment adopted by us, while\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 42\n\n adopting the Constitution. We, the people of India,\n while adopting the Constitution.\n\n \n52. The approving of such acts also results in\n depriving many of their opportunity to compete for\n public employment. The Constitution Bench of\n “Umadevi Case”, considered the proposition of law\n \nlaid down by\n the previous Constitution Bench in the\n case of \nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, reported\n in [AIR (1964) SC 521].\n \nThe earlier Constitution\n Bench in the case of \nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip\n Singh\n, held that where a Government Servant has no\n right to a post or to a particular status, though an\n authority under the Government acting beyond its\n competence had purported to give that person a status\n which it was not entitled to give he will not in law be\n deemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\n given the particular status.\n\n 53. In paragraph (14) of the “Umadevi\n Case” judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n has elaborately discussed about various orders of the\n Courts either interim orders or final orders which were\n brought to the notice of the Constitution Bench. The\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India came to the conclusion\n that those orders more or less was the issue of\n directions for continuation or absorption without\n referring to the legal position obtaining. It was\n brought to the notice of this Court that chaos has been\n created by such orders without reference to the legal\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 43\n\n principles and it is time that this Court settled the law\n once and for all so that in case the Court finds that\n such orders should not be made, the Courts, especially,\n the High Courts would be precluded from issuing such\n directions or passing such orders.\n\n 54. The very arguments advanced by the\n learned counsel for the State of Karnataka is that a\n chaos was created on account of various contradicting\n orders passed by the High Courts in the matter of\n regularization or permanent absorption in order to\n settle the legal principles. The learned counsel urged\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to take note of the\n fact that there is a chaos prevailing in respect of the\n regularization and permanent absorption of the\n temporary/daily wages employees and brought to the\n notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the\n High Courts would be precluded from issuing any such\n directions or passing such orders in contrary to the\n legal principles in the matters of regularization or\n permanent absorption or appointment. The\n observation made in this regard is that bypassing of\n the Constitutional scheme cannot be perpetuated by\n the passing of orders without dealing with and\n deciding the validity of such orders on the touchstone\n of Constitutionality.\n\n 55. Let us come to paragraph (20) of the\n “Umadevi Case” judgment which is extracted\n hereunder:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 44\n\n “20. The decision in Dharwad Distt. \nPWD\n Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of\n Karnataka\n [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 :\n\n (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] dealt with a\n scheme framed by the State of Karnataka, though at\n the instance of the Court. The scheme was essentially\n relating to the application of the concept of equal pay\n for equal work but it also provided for making\n permanent, or what it called regularisation, without\n keeping the distinction in mind, of employees who had\n been appointed ad hoc, casually, temporarily or on\n daily-wage basis. In other words, employees who had\n been appointed without following the procedure\n established by law for such appointments. This Court,\n at the threshold, stated that it should individualise\n justice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is not\n possible to accept the statement, unqualified as it\n appears to be. This Court is not only the constitutional\n court, it is also the highest court in the country, the\n final court of appeal. By virtue of \nArticle 141\n of the\n Constitution, what this Court lays down is the law of\n the land. Its decisions are binding on all the courts. Its\n main role is to interpret the constitutional and other\n statutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\n philosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto\n ourselves a system of governance by rule of law. The\n role of the Supreme Court is to render justice\n according to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 45\n\n Court is expected to decide questions of law for the\n country and not to decide individual cases without\n reference to such principles of law. Consistency is a\n virtue. Passing orders not consistent with its own\n decisions on law, is bound to send out confusing signals\n and usher in judicial chaos. Its role, therefore, is really\n to interpret the law and decide cases coming before it,\n according to law. Orders which are inconsistent with\n the legal conclusions arrived at by the court in the\n selfsame judgment not only create confusion but also\n tend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the\n statement, that equity tends to vary with the\n Chancellor's foot.”\n\n \n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad\n Distt. \nPWD Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn.\n Vs. State of Karnataka\n, reported in (1990) 2 SCC\n 396, was considered in the above paragraph. It is\n observed that the role of the Court to interpret the law\n and decide cases coming before it, according to law.\n Orders which are inconsistent with the legal\n conclusions arrived at by the Court in the self same\n judgment not only create confusion but also tend to\n usher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that\n equity tends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.\n\n 57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court of India has accepted the decision, the question\n of law for the country and not to decide individual\n cases without reference to such principles of law.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 46\n\n Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent\n with its own decisions on law, is bound to send out\n confusing signals and result in judicial chaos. The\n observation made in this regard are certainly to be\n followed by all the Courts across the Country.\n\n 58. \nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the\n Apex Court referred the spirit of \nKesavananda\n Bharati Vs. State of Kerala\n, reported in (1973) 4\n SCC 225, the Court held that \nArticle 14\n \n& 16\n which\n was described as a facet of \nArticle 14\n is part of the\n basic structure of the Constitution.\n \nIn the case of\n \nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in\n (2000) 1 SCC 168\n, \nthe said decision\n was reiterated\n how neither the Parliament nor the legislature could\n transgress the basic feature of the Constitution,\n namely, the principle of equality enshrined in \nArticle\n 14\n of which \nArticle 16(1)\n is a facet.\n\n 59. \nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in\n the above said case of \nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of\n India\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168, it is held that\n equality and equal opportunity is a basis feature of our\n Constitution, has explained the exultant position of\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution in the scheme of\n things.\n\n \n60. The judgment of the another Constitution\n Bench in the case of \nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of\n Bihar\n, reported in (1987) 1 SCC 378 and the\n relevant paragraph (3) is extracted hereunder:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 47\n\n “3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our\n Constitution and it is the essence of the rule of law that\n the exercise of the power by the State whether it be\n the legislature or the executive or any other authority\n should be within the constitutional limitations and if\n any practice is adopted by the executive which is in\n flagrant and systematic violation of its constitutional\n limitations, Petitioner 1 as a member of the public\n would have sufficient interest to challenge such\n practice by filing a writ petition and it would be the\n constitutional duty of this Court to entertain the writ\n petition and adjudicate upon the validity of such\n practice”\n\n 61. Let us now look into the way in which the\n Constitution Bench has arrived the conclusion in the\n matter of regularization and permanent absorption in\n “Umadevi Case” and the relevant paragraphs (43) to\n (50), which all are extracted hereunder:\n\n “43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the\n rule of equality in public employment is a basic feature\n of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core\n of our Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled\n from passing an order upholding a violation of \nArticle\n 14\n or in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply\n with the requirements of \nArticle 14\n read with \nArticle\n 16\n of the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the\n scheme for public employment, this Court while laying\n down the law, has necessarily to hold that unless the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 48\n\n appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after\n a proper competition among qualified persons, the\n same would not confer any right on the appointee. If it\n is a contractual appointment, the appointment comes\n to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\n engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual\n basis, the same would come to an end when it is\n discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could\n not claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his\n term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that\n merely because a temporary employee or a casual\n wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term\n of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be\n absorbed in regular service or made permanent,\n merely on the strength of such continuance, if the\n original appointment was not made by following a due\n process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\n It is not open to the court to prevent regular\n recruitment at the instance of temporary employees\n whose period of employment has come to an end or of\n ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their\n appointment, do not acquire any right. The High\n Courts acting under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution,\n should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,\n regularisation, or permanent continuance unless the\n recruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of\n the constitutional scheme. Merely because an\n employee had continued under cover of an order of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 49\n\n court, which we have described as “litigious\n employment” in the earlier part of the judgment, he\n would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or\n made permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases,\n the High Court may not be justified in issuing interim\n directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee\n approaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be\n possible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that\n ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas\n an interim direction to continue his employment would\n hold up the regular procedure for selection or impose\n on the State the burden of paying an employee who is\n really not required. The courts must be careful in\n ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the\n economic arrangement of its affairs by the State or its\n instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to\n facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and\n statutory mandates.\n\n 44. The concept of “equal pay for equal\n work” is different from the concept of conferring\n permanency on those who have been appointed on ad\n hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no process of\n selection as envisaged by the rules. This Court has in\n various decisions applied the principle of equal pay for\n equal work and has laid down the parameters for the\n application of that principle. The decisions are rested\n on the concept of equality enshrined in our\n Constitution in the light of the directive principles in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 50\n\n that behalf. But the acceptance of that principle cannot\n lead to a position where the court could direct that\n appointments made without following the due\n procedure established by law, be deemed permanent or\n issue directions to treat them as permanent. Doing so,\n would be negation of the principle of equality of\n opportunity. The power to make an order as is\n necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or\n matter pending before this Court, would not normally\n be used for giving the go-by to the procedure\n established by law in the matter of public employment.\n Take the situation arising in the cases before us from\n the State of Karnataka. Therein, after Dharwad\n decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 :\n\n (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] the\n Government had issued repeated directions and\n mandatory orders that no temporary or ad hoc\n employment or engagement be given. Some of the\n authorities and departments had ignored those\n directions or defied those directions and had continued\n to give employment, specifically interdicted by the\n orders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing\n officers have even been punished for their defiance. It\n would not be just or proper to pass an order in exercise\n of jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n or 32 of the\n Constitution or in exercise of power under \nArticle 142\n\n of the Constitution permitting those persons engaged,\n to be absorbed or to be made permanent, based on\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 51\n\n their appointments or engagements. Complete justice\n would be justice according to law and though it would\n be open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court\n would not grant a relief which would amount to\n perpetuating an illegality.\n\n 45. While directing that appointments,\n temporary or casual, be regularised or made\n permanent, the courts are swayed by the fact that the\n person concerned has worked for some time and in\n some cases for a considerable length of time. It is not\n as if the person who accepts an engagement either\n temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the\n nature of his employment. He accepts the employment\n with open eyes. It may be true that he is not in a\n position to bargain—not at arm's length—since he\n might have been searching for some employment so as\n to eke out his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets.\n But on that ground alone, it would not be appropriate\n to jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment\n and to take the view that a person who has temporarily\n or casually got employed should be directed to be\n continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\n another mode of public appointment which is not\n permissible. If the court were to void a contractual\n employment of this nature on the ground that the\n parties were not having equal bargaining power, that\n too would not enable the court to grant any relief to\n that employee. A total embargo on such casual or\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 52\n\n temporary employment is not possible, given the\n exigencies of administration and if imposed, would\n only mean that some people who at least get\n employment temporarily, contractually or casually,\n would not be getting even that employment when\n securing of such employment brings at least some\n succour to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our\n vast country are in search of employment and one is\n not compelled to accept a casual or temporary\n employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an\n employment. It is in that context that one has to\n proceed on the basis that the employment was\n accepted fully knowing the nature of it and the\n consequences flowing from it. In other words, even\n while accepting the employment, the person concerned\n knows the nature of his employment. It is not an\n appointment to a post in the real sense of the term.\n The claim acquired by him in the post in which he is\n temporarily employed or the interest in that post\n cannot be considered to be of such a magnitude as to\n enable the giving up of the procedure established, for\n making regular appointments to available posts in the\n services of the State. The argument that since one has\n been working for some time in the post, it will not be\n just to discontinue him, even though he was aware of\n the nature of the employment when he first took it up,\n is not one that would enable the jettisoning of the\n procedure established by law for public employment\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 53\n\n and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone\n of constitutionality and equality of opportunity\n enshrined in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n 46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the\n respondents argued that on the basis of the doctrine of\n legitimate expectation, the employees, especially of the\n Commercial Taxes Department, should be directed to\n be regularised since the decisions in Dharwad [(1990)\n 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC\n 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] , Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC\n 118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21 ATC 403 :\n\n (1992) 3 SCR 826] , Jacob [Jacob M. Puthuparambil v.\n\n \nKerala Water Authority, (1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC\n (L&S) 25 : (\n1991) 15 ATC 697] and Gujarat\n Agricultural University [Gujarat Agricultural University\n v. Rathod Labhu Bechar\n, (2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC\n (L&S) 613] and the like, have given rise to an\n expectation in them that their services would also be\n regularised. The doctrine can be invoked if the\n decisions of the administrative authority affect the\n person by depriving him of some benefit or advantage\n which either (i) he had in the past been permitted by\n the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can\n legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do\n until there have been communicated to him some\n rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has\n been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has\n received assurance from the decision-maker that they\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 54\n\n will not be withdrawn without giving him first an\n opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that\n they should not be withdrawn.\n \n[See Lord Diplock in\n Council for Civil Services Union v. Minister of Civil\n Service [1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 : (\n1984) 3\n WLR 1174 (HL)] , National Buildings Construction\n Corpn. v. S. Raghunathan\n [(1998) 7 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC\n (L&S) 1770] and Chanchal Goyal (Dr.) v. State of\n Rajasthan [(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .]\n There is no case that any assurance was given by the\n Government or the department concerned while\n making the appointment on daily wages that the status\n conferred on him will not be withdrawn until some\n rational reason comes into existence for withdrawing\n it. The very engagement was against the constitutional\n scheme. Though, the Commissioner of the Commercial\n Taxes Department sought to get the appointments\n made permanent, there is no case that at the time of\n appointment any promise was held out. No such\n promise could also have been held out in view of the\n circulars and directives issued by the Government\n after Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC\n (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] .\n Though, there is a case that the State had made\n regularisations in the past of similarly situated\n employees, the fact remains that such regularisations\n were done only pursuant to judicial directions, either\n of the Administrative Tribunal or of the High Court and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 55\n\n in some cases by this Court. Moreover, the invocation\n of the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable\n the employees to claim that they must be made\n permanent or they must be regularised in the service\n though they had not been selected in terms of the rules\n for appointment. The fact that in certain cases the\n court had directed regularisation of the employees\n involved in those cases cannot be made use of to found\n a claim based on legitimate expectation. The argument\n if accepted would also run counter to the constitutional\n mandate. The argument in that behalf has therefore to\n be rejected.\n\n 47. When a person enters a temporary\n employment or gets engagement as a contractual or\n casual worker and the engagement is not based on a\n proper selection as recognised by the relevant rules or\n procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\n appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in\n nature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of\n legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post\n when an appointment to the post could be made only\n by following a proper procedure for selection and in\n cases concerned, in consultation with the Public\n Service Commission. Therefore, the theory of\n legitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced\n by temporary, contractual or casual employees. It\n cannot also be held that the State has held out any\n promise while engaging these persons either to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 56\n\n continue them where they are or to make them\n permanent. The State cannot constitutionally make\n such a promise. It is also obvious that the theory\n cannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of being\n made permanent in the post.\n\n 48. It was then contended that the rights of\n the employees thus appointed, under \nArticles 14\n and\n \n16\n of the Constitution, are violated. It is stated that the\n State has treated the employees unfairly by employing\n them on less than minimum wages and extracting work\n from them for a pretty long period in comparison with\n those directly recruited who are getting more wages or\n salaries for doing similar work. The employees before\n us were engaged on daily wages in the department\n concerned on a wage that was made known to them.\n There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not\n being paid. Those who are working on daily wages\n formed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that\n they are discriminated as against those who have been\n regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.\n No right can be founded on an employment on daily\n wages to claim that such employee should be treated\n on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and\n made permanent in employment, even assuming that\n the principle could be invoked for claiming equal\n wages for equal work. There is no fundamental right in\n those who have been employed on daily wages or\n temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 57\n\n have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been\n held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of\n a post, since, a regular appointment could be made\n only by making appointments consistent with the\n requirements of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n The right to be treated equally with the other\n employees employed on daily wages, cannot be\n extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who\n were regularly employed. That would be treating\n unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to claim\n a right to be absorbed in service even though they\n have never been selected in terms of the relevant\n recruitment rules. The arguments based on \nArticles 14\n\n and \n16\n of the Constitution are therefore overruled.\n\n 49. It is contended that the State action in\n not regularising the employees was not fair within the\n framework of the rule of law. The rule of law compels\n the State to make appointments as envisaged by the\n Constitution and in the manner we have indicated\n earlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the employees\n had worked for some length of time but this has also\n been brought about by the pendency of proceedings in\n tribunals and courts initiated at the instance of the\n employees. Moreover, accepting an argument of this\n nature would mean that the State would be permitted\n to perpetuate an illegality in the matter of public\n employment and that would be a negation of the\n constitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 58\n\n India. It is therefore not possible to accept the\n argument that there must be a direction to make\n permanent all the persons employed on daily wages.\n When the court is approached for relief by way of a\n writ, the court has necessarily to ask itself whether the\n person before it had any legal right to be enforced.\n Considered in the light of the very clear constitutional\n scheme, it cannot be said that the employees have\n been able to establish a legal right to be made\n permanent even though they have never been\n appointed in terms of the relevant rules or in\n adherence of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n 50. It is argued that in a country like India\n where there is so much poverty and unemployment\n and there is no equality of bargaining power, the action\n of the State in not making the employees permanent,\n would be violative of \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution. But\n the very argument indicates that there are so many\n waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\n competing for employment and it is in that context that\n the Constitution as one of its basic features, has\n included \nArticles 14\n, 16\n and \n309\n so as to ensure that\n public employment is given only in a fair and equitable\n manner by giving all those who are qualified, an\n opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of\n upholding rights under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, a\n set of persons cannot be preferred over a vast majority\n of people waiting for an opportunity to compete for\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 59\n\n State employment. The acceptance of the argument on\n behalf of the respondents would really negate the\n rights of the others conferred by \nArticle 21\n of the\n Constitution, assuming that we are in a position to hold\n that the right to employment is also a right coming\n within the purview of \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution.\n The argument that \nArticle 23\n of the Constitution is\n breached because the employment on daily wages\n amounts to forced labour, cannot be accepted. After\n all, the employees accepted the employment at their\n own volition and with eyes open as to the nature of\n their employment. The Governments also revised the\n minimum wages payable from time to time in the light\n of all relevant circumstances. It also appears to us that\n importing of these theories to defeat the basic\n requirement of public employment would defeat the\n constitutional scheme and the constitutional goal of\n equality.”\n\n 62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that\n adherence to the rule of equality in public employment\n is a basic feature of our Constitution when it is\n clarified that adherence to the rule of equality in public\n employment is a basic feature of the Constitution,\n certainly, no person can deviate the principles in this\n regard and therefore, appointment in accordance with\n the recruitment rules in force by the competent\n authorities is the constitutional mandate and any\n deviation to be construed as violation of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 60\n\n constitutional principles. It is observed that if it is a\n contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an\n end at the end of the contract, if it were an\n engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual\n basis, the same would come to an end when it is\n discontinued. Similarly temporary employee could not\n claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term\n of appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely\n because a temporary employee or a casual wage\n worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his\n appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed\n in regular service or made appointment, merely on the\n strength of such continuance, if the original\n appointment was not made by following a due process\n of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\n 63. It is not open to the court to prevent\n regular recruitment at the instance of temporary\n employees whose period of employment has come to\n an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature\n of their appointment do not acquire any right. The\n High Courts acting under \nArticle 226\n of the\n Constitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for\n absorption, regularization, or permanent continuance\n unless the recruitment itself was made regularly and in\n terms of constitutional scheme.\n\n 64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable\n to the facts and circumstances of the present writ\n petition on hand. In the present writ petition, the writ\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 61\n\n petitioners were appointed on daily wage basis as\n Nominal Muster Rolls employees. The mere\n continuance or the length of service rendered alone\n cannot be a ground for granting the relief of\n regularization. Thus, the very legal principles settled\n by the Constitution Bench has to be fit in with the facts\n and circumstances of the present writ petition.\n Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India deals with\n the “litigious employment”. Of course, the situation\n does not arise in the present case. The interim order\n of Status Quo granted by this Court has not been\n properly implemented by reinstating the petitioners in\n service and the Contempt petition filed by the writ\n petitioners were also posted along with the writ\n petition for final disposal. Thus, the concept of\n “litigious employment” would not arise in respect of\n the present writ petition. Therefore, the petitioners\n have not continued in service by virtue of the interim\n order of Status Quo granted by this Court. However,\n their services were ousted, after filing of the writ\n petition.\n\n 65. Paragraph (44) of the “Umadevi Case”\n judgment deals with the concept of “equal pay for\n equal work”. Thus, it may not be required to elaborate\n the paragraph as far as the present case on hand is\n concerned.\n\n 66. Paragraph (45) of the above said\n judgment states that the Apex Court of India held that,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 62\n\n while directing that appointments, temporary or\n casual, be regularized or made permanent, the Courts\n are swayed by the fact that the person concerned has\n worked for some time and in some cases for a\n considerable length of time. It is not as if the person\n who accepts an engagement either temporary or\n casual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his\n employment. He accepts the employment with open\n eyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to\n bargain- not at arm's length – Since he might have\n been searching for some employment so as to eke out\n his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on\n that ground alone, it would not be appropriate to\n jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and\n to take the view that a person who has temporarily or\n casually got employed should be directed to be\n continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\n another mode of public appointment which is not\n permissible. A total embargo of such casual or\n temporary employment is not possible, given the\n exigencies of administration and if imposed, would\n only mean that some people who at least get\n employment temporarily, contractually or casually,\n would not be getting even that employment when\n securing of such employment brings at least some\n succour to them.\n\n 67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast\n country are in search of employment and one is not\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 63\n\n compelled to accept a casual or temporary employment\n if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment.\n It is in this context that one has to proceed on the basis\n that the employment was accepted fully knowing the\n nature of it and the consequences flowing from it. In\n other words, even while accepting the employment, the\n person concerned knows the nature of his employment.\n It is not an appointment to a post in the real sense of\n the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\n which he is temporarily employed or the interest in\n that post cannot be considered to be of such a\n magnitude, so as to enable the giving up of the\n procedure established, for making regular\n appointments to available posts in the services of the\n State.\n\n 68. In Paragraph (46) of the “Umadevi\n Case” judgment, their Lordships held that the\n invocation of the doctrine of legitimate expectation\n cannot enable the employees to claim that they must\n be made permanent or they must be regularised in the\n service though they had not been selected in terms of\n the rules for appointment. The fact that in certain\n cases the court had directed regularization of the\n employees involved in those cases cannot be made use\n of, to found a claim based on legitimate expectation.\n The argument if accepted would also run counter to\n the constitutional mandate. The argument in that\n behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 64\n\n 69. Paragraph (47) of the “Umadevi Case”\n judgment enumerates that when a person enters a\n temporary employment or gets engagement as a\n contractual or casual worker and the engagement is\n not based on a proper selection as recognised by the\n relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the\n consequences of the appointment being temporary,\n casual or contractual in nature. Such a person cannot\n invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being\n confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post\n could be made only by following a proper procedure\n for selection and in cases concerned, in consultation\n with the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the\n theory of legitimate expectation cannot be successfully\n advanced by temporary, contractual or casual\n employees.\n\n 70. In paragraph (48) of the “Umadevi\n Case” Judgment, the Constitution Bench considered\n the right of the employees thus appointed, under\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution, are violated.\n Even in “Umadevi Case”, those employees before the\n Supreme Court of India were engaged on daily wages\n in the department concerned on a daily wage that was\n made known to them. There is no case that the wage\n agreed upon was not being paid. Those who are\n working on daily wages formed a class by themselves,\n they cannot claim that they are discriminated as\n against those who have been regularly recruited on the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 65\n\n basis of the relevant rules. No right can be founded on\n an employment on daily wages to claim that such\n employee should be treated on par with a regularly\n recruited candidate, and made permanent in\n employment, even assuming that the principle could be\n invoked for claiming equal wages for equal work.\n There is no fundamental right for those who have been\n employed on daily wages or temporarily or on\n contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be\n absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court,\n they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a\n regular appointment could be made only by making\n appointments consistent with the requirements of\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n 71. In paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule\n of law compels the State to make appointments as\n envisaged by the Constitution and in the manner we\n have indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n in the judgment of “Umadevi Case”. When the Court\n is approached by way of a writ, the Court has\n necessarily to ask itself whether the person before it\n had any legal right to be enforced. Even, the\n Constitution Bench dealt with the \nArticle 21\n of the\n Constitution of India, in a Country like India, where\n there is so much poverty and unemployment and there\n is no equality of bargaining power, the action of the\n State in not making the employees permanent, would\n be violative of \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution. But the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 66\n\n very argument indicates that there are so many\n waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\n competing for employment and it is in that context, the\n Constitution as one of its basic features, has included\n Articles 14,16 and 309 so as to ensure that public\n employment is given only in a fair and equitable\n manner by giving all those who are qualified, an\n opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of\n upholding rights under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, a\n set of persons cannot be preferred over a vast majority\n of people waiting for an opportunity to compete for\n State employment.\n\n 72. Now, let us look into the important\n paragraph urged by the learned counsel for the\n petitioner, i.e., paragraph (53) of the Judgment of\n “Umadevi Case”.\n\n Paragraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted\n hereunder:\n\n “53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There\n may be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal\n appointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappa\n [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\n Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799]\n and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] and referred to in para 15\n above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\n vacant posts might have been made and the employees\n have continued to work for ten years or more but\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 67\n\n without the intervention of orders of the courts or of\n tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\n of such employees may have to be considered on\n merits in the light of the principles settled by this\n Court in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of\n this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\n State Governments and their instrumentalities should\n take steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the\n services of such irregularly appointed, who have\n worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts\n but not under cover of orders of the courts or of\n tribunals and should further ensure that regular\n recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\n sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases\n where temporary employees or daily wagers are being\n now employed. The process must be set in motion\n within six months from this date. We also clarify that\n regularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice,\n need not be reopened based on this judgment, but\n there should be no further bypassing of the\n constitutional requirement and regularising or making\n permanent, those not duly appointed as per the\n constitutional scheme.”\n\n 73. The above said paragraph (53) of the\n “Umadevi Case” is a one time relief, of Course,\n granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to\n mitigate the hardship, if any, caused to the temporary\n employees. Now, the question arises how long the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 68\n\n benefit granted under paragraph (53) can be extended\n to the employees and what is the interpretation of the\n subsequent judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n India in respect of paragraph (53) of the judgment of\n the Constitution Bench.\n\n 74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, while stopping the\n entire irregular appointments and back door\n appointments had taken note of the fact that certain\n reliefs are required in respect of the employees who\n are already regularized or in respect of those persons,\n a proposal is already kept pending. Certainly, the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India have never intended to\n grant the relief of regularization or permanent\n absorption in public employment contrary to the legal\n principles settled in earlier paragraphs. Thus,\n paragraph (53) of the judgment has to be understood\n harmoniously and together with the legal principles\n settled by the Constitution Bench in earlier\n paragraphs.\n\n 75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted\n opinion that paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\n judgment cannot be treated as an isolation and it\n should be considered along with the other legal\n principles settled by the Constitution Bench. Keeping\n in mind, the legal principles settled by the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court of India in earlier paragraphs, this\n Court is of the opinion that one time relief granted by\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 69\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to be extended\n in its real sense and the High Courts cannot travel\n beyond the scope of the intention expressed by the\n Constitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n \n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner\n cited the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n India in the case of \nU.P.State Electricity Board Vs.\n Pooran Chandra Pandey and Others\n, reported in\n (2007) 11 SCC 92, and the paragraph (11) of the\n judgment is relevant and is extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon\n the decision of this Court in \nSecy., State of Karnataka\n v. Umadevi\n (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\n and has urged that no direction for regularisation can\n be given by the Court. In our opinion, the decision in\n Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n 753] is clearly distinguishable. The said decision\n cannot be applied to a case where regularisation has\n been sought for in pursuance of \nArticle 14\n of the\n Constitution.”\n\n 77. In the above said case, the Hon'ble Two\n Judges Bench distinguished that case with the\n “Umadevi Case”. The very language used in\n Paragraph (11) states that “in our opinion, the decision\n in “Umadevi Case” is clearly distinguishable. The\n said decision cannot be applied to a case where\n regularization has been sought for in pursuance of\n \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. However, this Court is\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 70\n\n of the opinion that their Lordships have distinguished\n the “Umadevi Case” in respect of the facts and\n circumstances that the case. When their Lordships\n have distinguished that case, this Court is of the\n opinion that the legal principles settled in “Umadevi\n Case” has not been deviated by the Hon'ble Two\n Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,\n as it is a “binding precedent” as stated by this Court in\n earlier paragraphs.\n\n 78. “Umadevi Case” being a “binding\n precedent” and when the case was distinguished from\n “Umadevi Case” on factual circumstances, the same\n cannot be applied in the present case before this\n Court.\n\n 79. The judgment in the case of State of\n Uttaranchal and another Vs. Prantiya Sinchai\n Avam Bandh Yogana Shramik Mahaparishad,\n reported in (2007) 12 SCC 483 and the relevant\n paragraph (5) is cited by the learned counsel for the\n petitioner which is extracted hereunder:\n\n “5. A writ petition was filed before the\n Uttaranchal High Court which was dismissed by the\n impugned order. The High Court was of the view that\n all the 14 workmen, in question, were working on daily\n wages for more than six years and had completed 240\n days in each calendar year and they ought to be\n regularised. Accordingly, the writ petition was\n dismissed.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 71\n\n 80. On a perusal of the above said judgment,\n this Court is of the opinion that the case relates to an\n award passed by the Labour Court and an Award\n passed by the Labour Court under the provisions of the\n \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, cannot have any relevance in\n respect of the Government employments made by\n virtue of the rules framed by the State in this regard.\n However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in that\n case, remanded the matter back for reconsideration by\n the High Court in the light of the legal principles\n settled in the “Umadevi Case”. Thus, in all respects,\n the case cannot have any application in respect of the\n facts and circumstances of the present writ petition.\n\n \n81. It has further cited the case of \nState of\n Karnataka and Others Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others\n,\n reported in (2010) 9 SCC 247 and the relevant\n paragraph (7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n “7. It is evident from the above that there is\n an exception to the general principles against\n “regularisation” enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\n SCC 1] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n (i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\n years or more in duly sanctioned post without the\n benefit or protection of the interim order of any court\n or tribunal. In other words, the State Government or\n its instrumentality should have employed the employee\n and continued him in service voluntarily and\n continuously for more than ten years.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 72\n\n (ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\n illegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\n not made or continued against sanctioned posts or\n where the persons appointed do not possess the\n prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\n will be considered to be illegal. But where the person\n employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\n was working against sanctioned posts, but had been\n selected without undergoing the process of open\n competitive selection, such appointments are\n considered to be irregular.”\n\n 82. In \nthe above case\n, an exception has been\n carved out in relation to the one time relief granted in\n paragraph (15) of the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n 83. In the case of State of Rajastan and\n Others Vs. Daya Lal and Others, reported in\n (2011) 2 SCC 429 and the relevant paragraph (12),\n enumerates the settled principles in respect of\n regularization and parity in pay, relevant in the context\n of the case and those principles carved out in\n paragraph (12) of the above judgment are akin to that\n of the legal principles settled by the Constitution\n Bench in “Umadevi Case”.\n\n \n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner\n solicited the attention of this Court relying the case\n decided by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of \nNihal\n Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 73\n\n reported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and the paragraph\n (31) and (33) of the judgments are extracted\n hereunder:\n\n \n“31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\n process of selection adopted in identifying the\n appellants herein cannot be said to be unreasonable or\n arbitrary in the sense that it was devised to eliminate\n other eligible candidates. It may be worthwhile to note\n that in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] ,\n this Court was dealing with appointments made\n without following any rational procedure in the lower\n rungs of various services of the Union and the States.\n\n 33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the\n need to employ a certain number of people for\n discharging a particular responsibility of the State\n under the Constitution is always with the executive\n government of the day subject to the overall control of\n the legislature. That does not mean that an\n examination by a constitutional court regarding the\n accuracy of the assessment of the need is barred.”\n\n 85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this\n Court is of an undoubted opinion that there is a slight\n deviation in respect of the legal principles carved out\n by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench in “Umadevi\n Case”. This Court wishes to remind the language used\n by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (5) of\n “Umadevi Case”. To reiterate the language used by\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 74\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India emphatically in\n paragraph (5) that this Court has also occasions to\n issue directions which could not be said to be consisted\n by the public employment. Such directions are issued\n presumably on the basis of equitable consideration or\n individualization of justice. The question arises, equity\n to whom? Equity for the handful of people who have\n approached the Court with a claim, or equity for the\n teeming millions of this Country seeking employment\n and seeking a fair opportunity for competing for\n employment?\n\n 86. In paragraph (54) of the said “Umadevi\n Case” judgment, again the Constitution Bench\n reiterated that “It is also clarified that those decisions\n which run counter to the principle settled in this\n decision, or in which directions running counter to\n what we have held herein, will stand denuded of their\n status as precedents.”\n\n \n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding\n that the judgment cited by the learned counsel for the\n petitioner in the case of \nNihal Singh and Others Vs.\n State of Punjab and Others\n, reported in (2013) 14\n SCC 65, is to be considered as denuded of their status\n as precedents. Thus, this Court is not inclined to\n consider and follow the same.\n\n 88. \nIn the case of \nAmarendra Kumar\n Mohapatra and others Vs. State of Orissa and\n others\n, reported in (2014) 4 SCC 583, the Hon'ble\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 75\n\n Two Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of India held\n that and the paragraphs (42) & (43) of the above said\n judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState\n of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\n SCC (L&S) 753] , as noticed earlier, permitted\n regularisation of regular appointments and not illegal\n appointments.\n \nQuestion, however, is whether the\n appointments in the instant case could be described as\n illegal and if they were not, whether the State could be\n directed to regularise the services of the degree-holder\n Junior Engineers who have worked as ad hoc Assistant\n Engineers for such a long period, not only on the\n analogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation\n but also on the principle underlying para 53 of the\n decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\n \n43.As to what would constitute an irregular\n appointment is no longer res integra. The decision of\n this Court in \nState of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n [(2010)\n 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , has examined\n that question and explained the principle regarding\n regularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3) case\n [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n \n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . The decision \nin that case\n\n summed up the following three essentials for\n regularisation: (1) the employees have worked for ten\n years or more, (2) that they have so worked in a duly\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 76\n\n sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the\n interim order of any court or tribunal, and (3) they\n should have possessed the minimum qualification\n stipulated for the appointment. Subject to these three\n requirements being satisfied, even if the appointment\n process did not involve open competitive selection, the\n appointment would be treated irregular and not illegal\n and thereby qualify for regularisation.\n \nPara 7 in this\n regard is apposite and may be extracted at this stage:\n (\nM.L. Kesari\n case [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC\n (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250)\n “7.\n \nIt is evident from the above that there is an\n exception to the general principles against\n ‘regularisation’ enunciated in \nUmadevi (3) [State of\n Karnataka v.

But where the person\n employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\n was working against sanctioned posts, but had been\n selected without undergoing the process of open\n competitive selection, such appointments are\n considered to be irregular.”\n\n 89. It is important to cite the case of\n SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, SCHOOL\n EDUCATION DEPARTMENT,CHENNAI v.\n\n R.GOVINDASWAMY AND ORS.[ (2014) 4 SCC\n 769]. In paragraph No.(8), the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n has observed as follows:\n\n \n“8.this Court in \nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal &\n Ors.\n, AIR 2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of\n regularisation of irregular or part-time appointments in\n all possible eventualities and laid down well-settled\n principles relating to regularisation and parity in pay\n relevant in the context of the issues involved therein.\n The same are as under:\n\n “(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under \nArticle\n 226\n of the Constitution will not issue directions for\n regularisation, absorption or permanent continuance,\n unless the employees claiming regularisation had been\n appointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in\n accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive\n process, against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality\n clause contained in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n should be\n scrupulously followed and Courts should not issue a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 78\n\n direction for regularisation of services of an employee\n which would be violative of the constitutional scheme.\n\n While something that is irregular for want of\n compliance with one of the elements in the process of\n selection which does not go to the root of the process,\n can be regularised, back door entries, appointments\n contrary to the constitutional scheme and/or\n appointment of ineligible candidates cannot be\n regularised.\n\n (ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad\n hoc or daily-wage employee, under cover of some\n interim orders of the court, would not confer upon him\n any right to be absorbed into service, as such service\n would be “litigious employment”. Even temporary, ad\n hoc or daily-wage service for a long number of years,\n let alone service for one or two years, will not entitle\n such employee to claim regularisation, if he is not\n working against a sanctioned post. Sympathy and\n sentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be grounds for passing any\n order of regularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n (iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for\n regularisation with a cut-off date (that is a scheme\n providing that persons who had put in a specified\n number of years of service and continuing in\n employment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible to\n others who were appointed subsequent to the cut-off\n date, to claim or contend that the scheme should be\n applied to them by extending the cut-off date or seek a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 79\n\n direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for\n successive cut-off dates.\n\n (iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek\n regularisation as they are not working against any\n sanctioned posts. There cannot be a direction for\n absorption, regularisation or permanent continuance of\n part-time temporary employees.\n\n (v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run\n institutions cannot claim parity in salary with regular\n employees of the Government on the principle of equal\n pay for equal work. Nor can employees in private\n employment, even if serving full time, seek parity in\n salary with government employees. The right to claim\n a particular salary against the State must arise under a\n contract or under a statute.” (Emphasis added) “\n\n \n90. Reiterating the principles \nlaid down in\n the\n \nCase of Secretary to Government, School\n Education Department, Chennai Vs.\n R.Govindaswamy and others\n, reported in (2014) 4\n SCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n emphatically ruled that the High Courts, in exercising\n power under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India\n will not issue directions for regularization, absorption\n or permanent continuance. Unless the employees\n claiming regularization had been appointed in\n pursuance of a regular recruitment in accordance with\n relevant rules in an open competitive process against\n sanctioned vacant posts, the equality clause contained\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 80\n\n in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n should be scrupulously followed\n and Courts should not issue a direction for\n regularization of services of an employee which would\n be violative of the Constitutional scheme.\n\n 91. \nIn the case of \nNand Kumar Vs. State of\n Bihar and Others\n, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 300,\n paragraph (25) & (26) are extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid\n decisions of this Court. The principle as has been \nlaid\n down in\n \nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has also\n been applied in relation to the persons who were\n working on daily wages. According to us, the daily\n wagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the\n term “appointment”. They do not hold a post. The\n scheme of alternative appointment framed for regular\n employees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore,\n confer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of\n abolished organisation to such alternative employment.\n\n \n(See \nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n [(2006) 4\n SCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] ) Their relevance in\n the context of appointment arose by reason of the\n concept of regularisation as a source of appointment.\n\nAfter Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3),\n (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , their position\n continued to be that of daily wagers. Appointment on\n daily-wage basis is not an appointment to a post\n according to the rules. Usually, the projects in which\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 81\n\n the daily wagers were engaged, having come to an\n end, their appointment is necessarily terminated for\n want of work. Therefore, the status and rights of daily\n wagers of a government concern are not equivalent to\n that of a government servant and his claim to\n permanency has to be adjudged differently.\n\n 26.In these circumstances, in our considered\n opinion, the regularisation/absorption is not a matter\n of course. It would depend upon the facts of the case\n following the rules and regulations and cannot be\n dehors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.”\n\n 92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion\n that the above two paragraphs are running contrary to\n the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench\n of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Thus, the rules\n \nlaid down in\n paragraph (54) of the Constitution Bench\n to be applied in respect of \nthe above case\n cited.\n\n 93. \nIn the case of \nMalathi Das and Others,\n Vs. Suresh and Others\n, reported in (2014) 13 SCC\n 249 and the relevant paragraph (13) is extracted\n hereunder:\n\n \n“13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is\n wholly unnecessary for us to consider as to whether\n the cases of persons who were awaiting regularisation\n on the date of the decision in \nUmadevi (3) [State of\n Karnataka v.

Umadevi\n (3), (2006)\n 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we are of the view that\n the stand taken by the appellants in refusing\n regularisation to the respondents cannot be\n countenanced.\n \nHowever, as the said stand of the\n appellants stems from their perception and\n understanding of the decision in \nUmadevi (3) [State of\n Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n (L&S) 753] we do not hold them liable for contempt\n but make it clear that the appellants and all the other\n competent authorities of the State will now be obliged\n and duty-bound to regularise the services of the\n respondents (74 in number) which will now be done\n forthwith and in any case within a period of two\n months from the date of receipt of this order.”\n\n \n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once\n again taken a deviation in respect of the legal\n principles settled by the Constitution Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Therefore, such\n deviation to be held as denuded of their status as\n precedent, as \nlaid down in\n paragraph (54) of the\n Constitution Bench.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 83\n\n 95. \nIn the case of \nAmarkant Rai Vs. State\n of Bihar and Others\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC\n 265, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in paragraph\n (11) and (14) are held as follows:\n\n \n“11.Elaborating upon the principles \nlaid\n down in\n Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n (L&S) 753] and explaining the difference between\n irregular and illegal appointments in \nState of\n Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2\n SCC (L&S) 826] , this Court held as under: (\nM.L.\n Kesari\n case [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n 826] , SCC p. 250, para 7)\n “7. It is evident from the above that there is an\n exception to the general principles against\n ‘regularisation’ enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\n SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the following\n conditions are fulfilled:\n\n (i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\n years or more in duly sanctioned post without the\n benefit or protection of the interim order of any court\n or tribunal. In other words, the State Government or\n its instrumentality should have employed the employee\n and continued him in service voluntarily and\n continuously for more than ten years.\n\n (ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\n illegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\n not made or continued against sanctioned posts or\n where the persons appointed do not possess the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 84\n\n prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\n will be considered to be illegal. But where the person\n employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\n was working against sanctioned posts, but had been\n selected without undergoing the process of open\n competitive selection, such appointments are\n considered to be irregular.”\n\n 14.Considering the facts and circumstances\n of the case that the appellant has served the University\n for more than 29 years on the post of night guard and\n that he has served the College on daily wages, in the\n interest of justice, the authorities are directed to\n regularise the services of the appellant retrospectively\n w.e.f. 3-1-2002 (the date on which he rejoined the post\n as per the direction of the Registrar).\"\n\n 96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited\n judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held\n that the appellant has served in the University for\n more than 29 years in the post of night guard and that\n he has served the College on daily wages, in the\n interest of justice, the authorities are directed to\n regularise the services of the appellant retrospectively\n w.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\n 97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court of India has deviated the principles \nlaid\n down in\n “Umadevi Case”. Thus, this Court has to\n derive an opinion that the decision would be denuded\n of its status as precedents. For all these reasons, this\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 85\n\n Court has to independently apply the legal principles\n settled by the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi\n Case”.\n\n 98. \nIn the case of \nPrem Ram Vs. Managing\n Director, Uttarakhand Pey Jal & Nirman Nigam,\n Dehradun and Others\n, reported in (2015) 11 SCC\n 255, undoubtedly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n has decided the case based on the facts and\n circumstances of the case. However, on a plain\n reading of the judgment, this Court is of the opinion\n that the legal principles settled by the Constitution\n Bench has not been considered by the Hon'ble Two\n Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n Thus, this Court is not inclined to follow the judgment\n for the purpose of deciding the case on hand.\n\n 99. \nIn the case of \nSurendra Kumar and\n Others Vs. Greater Noida Industrial Development\n Authority and Others\n, reported in (2015) 14 SCC\n 382, while, the Supreme Court of India in paragraph\n (13) held as follows:\n\n \n“13.Considering the facts of the present case\n on the touchstone \nlaid down in\n Umadevi (3) case [\nState\n of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\n SCC (L&S) 753] , it will be seen that the Division\n Bench was not right in setting aside the appointment of\n the appellants. More so, it was nobody's case\n challenging the appointment of the appellants.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 86\n\n Admittedly, the appellants were engaged as\n contractual employees from 1994 and have completed\n more than ten years of continuous service with\n Respondent 1. They continued in service not by the\n orders of the Court/Tribunal, but by the decision of the\n respondents. The appellants were regularised as per\n the policy decision dated 16-4-2003 taken by\n Respondent 1 and approved by the State Government\n vide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the appointment of\n the appellants were made pursuant to the policy of\n regularisation, the High Court was not right in\n quashing the appointment of the appellants as the\n same were never in question before the High Court.\n The plea that was raised by the appellants was only to\n seek regularisation with retrospective effect from\n 20-11-2002 and the consequential seniority.”\n\n \n100. In this case also, the Hon'ble Two\n Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n has taken note of the one time benefit granted by the\n Constitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the Judgment\n in “Umadevi Case”. However, the legal principles\n settled in paragraphs 5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to 50 and\n 54 of the judgment has not been considered by their\n Lordships. Since the legal principles enunciated in the\n above paragraphs of the Constitution Bench has not\n been considered and the case was decided based on\n the particular facts and circumstances of the case, this\n Court is not bound to consider it as a “binding\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 87\n\n precedent” as enumerated in the first portion of this\n Judgment. This Court has earlier considered the\n nature of the “binding precedents” and the\n interpretation of binding precedents as enumerated by\n the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n of India in the recent case of \nNational Insurance Co.\n Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n, reported in [JT\n 2017 10 SC 450] cited supra.\n\n 101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is\n able to find out that those cases by the Hon'ble Two\n Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India were\n decided based on certain facts and circumstances of\n the case. However, all those circumstances and the\n legal principles were well settled by the Constitution\n Bench in “Umadevi Case”. Various paragraphs of the\n Constitution Bench judgment as discussed above made\n it very clear that all the circumstances arisen out of\n the temporary/casual/daily wages employees were\n dealt with elaborately and a findings are provided.\n This being the factum of the case, this Court is not\n inclined to follow the above judgment of the Hon'ble\n Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n India as a “binding precedent” and this Court is bound\n by the legal principles settled by the Constitution\n Bench in “Umadevi Case” which remains as the law\n of the land under \nArticle 141\n of the Constitution of\n India.\n\n \n102. This Court is willing to cite another\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 88\n\n judgment of the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of \nPunjab\n Water Supply & Sewerage Board Vs. Ranjodh\n Singh and Others\n, reported in (2007) 2 SCC Page\n\n 491. In the above judgment paragraph (17) & (18) are\n extracted hereunder:\n\n “17.A combined reading of the aforementioned\n paragraphs would clearly indicate that what the\n Constitution Bench had in mind in directing\n regularisation was in relation to such appointments,\n which were irregular in nature and not illegal ones.\n\n \n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is\n explicit. It has been so pointed out in \nNational\n Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n [(2006) 5 SCC 493 :\n\n 2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms: (SCC\n pp. 500-01, paras 23-25)\n “23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing\n on behalf of the respondents that the appointments\n were irregular and not illegal, cannot be accepted for\n more than one reason. They were appointed only on\n the basis of their applications. The Recruitment Rules\n were not followed. Even the Selection Committee had\n not been properly constituted. In view of the ban on\n employment, no recruitment was permissible in law.\n The reservation policy adopted by the appellant had\n not been maintained. Even cases of minorities had not\n been given due consideration.\n\n 24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 89\n\n regularisation of the services only of those employees\n whose appointments were irregular as explained in\n State of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa [AIR 1967 SC\n 1071 : (1967) 1 SCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T.\n Thimmiah [(1972) 1 SCC 409] and B.N. Nagarajan v.\n\n State of Karnataka [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n (L&S) 4] wherein this Court observed: [Umadevi (3)\n case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , SCC p.\n 24, para 16]\n ‘16. \nIn \nB.N.

State of Karnataka\n [(1979) 4\n SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] this Court clearly held\n that the words “regular” or “regularisation” do not\n connote permanence and cannot be construed so as to\n convey an idea of the nature of tenure of\n appointments. They are terms calculated to condone\n any procedural irregularities and are meant to cure\n only such defects as are attributable to methodology\n followed in making the appointments.’\n\n \n25. Judged by the standards \nlaid down by\n this Court in\n the aforementioned decisions, the appointments of the\n respondents are illegal.\n \nThey do not, thus, have any\n legal right to continue in service.”\n (See also \nState of M.P. v.

The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has dealt with the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 90\n\n interpretation of paragraphs 16, 17, 19 and 22 of\n “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (16), (17), (19)\n and (22) are extracted hereunder:\n\n “16. \nIn \nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n\n [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR\n 937] this Court clearly held that the words “regular” or\n “regularisation” do not connote permanence and\n cannot be construed so as to convey an idea of the\n nature of tenure of appointments. They are terms\n calculated to condone any procedural irregularities\n and are meant to cure only such defects as are\n attributable to methodology followed in making the\n appointments. This Court emphasised that when rules\n framed under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution are in\n force, no regularisation is permissible in exercise of\n the executive powers of the Government under \nArticle\n 162\n of the Constitution in contravention of the rules.\n\n These decisions and the principles recognised therein\n have not been dissented to by this Court and on\n principle, we see no reason not to accept the\n proposition as enunciated in the above decisions. We\n have, therefore, to keep this distinction in mind and\n proceed on the basis that only something that is\n irregular for want of compliance with one of the\n elements in the process of selection which does not go\n to the root of the process, can be regularised and that\n it alone can be regularised and granting permanence\n of employment is a totally different concept and cannot\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 91\n\n be equated with regularisation.\n\n 17. We have already indicated the constitutional\n scheme of public employment in this country, and the\n executive, or for that matter the court, in appropriate\n cases, would have only the right to regularise an\n appointment made after following the due procedure,\n even though a non-fundamental element of that\n process or procedure has not been followed. This right\n of the executive and that of the court would not extend\n to the executive or the court being in a position to\n direct that an appointment made in clear violation of\n the constitutional scheme, and the statutory rules\n made in that behalf, can be treated as permanent or\n can be directed to be treated as permanent.\n\n 19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also\n controlled by economic considerations and financial\n implications of any public employment. The viability of\n the department or the instrumentality of the project is\n also of equal concern for the State. The State works\n out the scheme taking into consideration the financial\n implications and the economic aspects. Can the court\n impose on the State a financial burden of this nature\n by insisting on regularisation or permanence in\n employment, when those employed temporarily are not\n needed permanently or regularly? As an example, we\n can envisage a direction to give permanent\n employment to all those who are being temporarily or\n casually employed in a public sector undertaking. The\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 92\n\n burden may become so heavy by such a direction that\n the undertaking itself may collapse under its own\n weight. It is not as if this had not happened. So, the\n court ought not to impose a financial burden on the\n State by such directions, as such directions may turn\n counterproductive.\n\n \n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question\n whether the jettisoning of the constitutional scheme of\n appointment can be approved, was not considered or\n decided. The distinction emphasised in \nR.N.\n Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n [(1972) 1 SCC 409 :\n\n (1972) 2 SCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The\n Court appears to have been dealing with a scheme for\n “equal pay for equal work” and in the process, without\n an actual discussion of the question, had approved a\n scheme put forward by the State, prepared obviously\n at the direction of the Court, to order permanent\n absorption of such daily-rated workers. With respect to\n the learned judges, the decision cannot be said to lay\n down any law, that all those engaged on daily wages,\n casually, temporarily, or when no sanctioned post or\n vacancy existed and without following the rules of\n selection, should be absorbed or made permanent\n though not at a stretch, but gradually. If that were the\n ratio, with respect, we have to disagree with it.”\n\n 104. \nIn the case of \nPost Master General,\n Kolkata and Others Vs. Tutu Das(Dutta\n), reported\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 93\n\n in (2007) 5 SCC 317, paragraphs (5) & (18) are\n relevant and the same are extracted hereunder:\n\n “5.Whereas pursuant to the said direction,\n although the case of Niva Ghosh was allegedly\n considered, her case was not, whereupon a contempt\n petition was filed. In the said contempt proceedings, a\n stand was taken by the appellant that she had not\n completed a period of 240 days in a year before the\n said cut-off date. The said contempt petition was\n dismissed with liberty to the respondent to file a fresh\n original application. Pursuant to the said observations,\n the respondent filed an application before the Central\n Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta\n which was marked as OA No. 484 of 2002.\n\n 18.There are two distinctive features in the\n present case, which are:\n\n (i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it cannot\n be invoked where any illegality has been committed or\n where no legal right is established.\n\n (ii) According to the appellant the respondent having\n completed 240 days, does not fulfil the requisite\n criteria. A disputed question of fact has been raised.\n\n The High Court did not come to a positive finding that\n she had worked for more than 240 days in a year.”\n\n 105. \nIn the case of \nC.Balachandran and\n Others Vs. State of Kerala and Others\n, reported in\n (2009) 1 SCC (L& S) 610, wherein the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court of India interpreted the scope of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 94\n\n paragraph 153 of “Umadevi Case” and the\n paragraphs (17) & (18) of \nthe said judgment\n and the\n same is extracted hereunder:\n\n “17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon\n the observations made in Para 53 in Umadevi [(2006) 4\n SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] which reads as under:\n\n \n(SCC p. 42, para 53)\n “53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be\n cases where irregular appointments (not illegal\n appointments) as explained in \nState of Mysore v. S.V.\n Narayanappa\n [AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] ,\n R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n [(\n1972) 1 SCC 409]\n and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n [(1979) 4\n SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] and referred to in para\n 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\n vacant posts might have been made and the employees\n have continued to work for ten years or more but\n without the intervention of orders of the courts or of\n tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\n of such employees may have to be considered on\n merits in the light of the principles settled by this\n Court in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of\n this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\n State Governments and their instrumentalities should\n take steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the\n services of such irregularly appointed, who have\n worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts\n but not under cover of orders of the courts or of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 95\n\n tribunals and should further ensure that regular\n recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\n sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases\n where temporary employees or daily wagers are being\n now employed. The process must be set in motion\n within six months from this date. We also clarify that\n regularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice,\n need not be reopened based on this judgment, but\n there should be no further bypassing of the\n constitutional requirement and regularising or making\n permanent, those not duly appointed as per the\n constitutional scheme.”(emphasis in original)\n A case of regularisation which thus attained finality\n and was not sub judice would not come within the\n purview of exception to the rule contained in Para 53\n of \nthe said judgment\n. The appellants' case, thus, does\n not come within the purview thereof. Only those cases\n where regularisations had already been made were not\n to be reopened. It is not in dispute that services of the\n appellants were terminated as far back as in 1987 and\n they did not question the legality or validity of the said\n order.\n It is only after the decision of this Court in Jacob\n case [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991)\n 15 ATC 697] that representations were filed. Such\n representations were rejected both by the Kerala\n Water Authority as also the State of Kerala.\n\n 18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus,\n neither in law nor in equity were entitled to be\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 96\n\n reinstated in service. The decision of this Court in\n Jacob case [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 :\n\n (1991) 15 ATC 697] being not applicable to the case of\n the appellants, we are bound by the ratio laid down in\n Umadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . So\n far as Para 53 of the judgment of the Constitution\n Bench in the said case is concerned, the same has been\n considered by this Court in a large number of\n decisions. \nIn \nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board\n v. Ranjodh Singh\n [(2007) 2 SCC 491 : (2007) 1 SCC\n (L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498, para 15)\n “15.\n \nThe question came up for consideration before a\n Constitution Bench of this Court in \nState of Karnataka\n v. Umadevi\n (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\n wherein it was held that no person who was\n temporarily or casually been employed could be\n directed to be continued permanently.\n \nIt was opined\n that by doing so it would be creating another mode of\n public employment which is not permissible.”\n [See \nEmployees' Union v. Mineral Exploration Corpn\n.\n\n \nLtd. [(2006) 6 SCC 310 : 2006 \nSCC (L&S) 1318] , State\n of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n [(2007) 1 SCC 575 :\n\n (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post Master General v.\n\n Tutu Das (Dutta) [(2007) 5 SCC 317 : (2007) 2 SCC\n (L&S) 179] .]”\n\n 106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of\n the judgment, is well enumerated by the Hon'ble Two\n Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 97\n\n cited above, this Court is not inclined to consider the\n other judgments referred by the learned counsel for\n the petitioner. However, on a perusal of all these\n judgments cited supra, this Court is of the opinion that\n ultimately the legal principle settled in by the\n Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case” is binding\n over the subject and the same is to be followed\n scrupulously by all the Courts across the country and\n the same becomes the law of the land in the matter of\n regularization, permanent absorption and\n appointment.\n\n 107. Now, considering the facts and\n circumstances of the case on hand, it remains that the\n writ petitioners were appointed as daily rated\n employees for a particular period and, this Court has\n to draw an inference that all the Government orders\n passed subsequent to the Constitution Bench\n Judgment, if runs contrary to the legal principles\n settled by the Constitution Bench, would become\n invalid and the same cannot be implemented or\n followed. In other words, it is to be noted that the\n Government has no authority to issue any orders\n granting regularization, permanent absorption or\n appointment in violation of the Constitutional schemes\n and in violation of the recruitment rules in force. The\n power of the Government in this regard is certainly\n abrogated by the principles settled by the Constitution\n Bench in the “Umadevi Case”. Such being the factum\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 98\n\n of the case, the State Government is to be precluded as\n well as its authority are to be regularized in respect of\n appointing employees in contravention with the\n recruitment rules in force and effecting appointments\n through back doors.\n\n 108. This Court has to place on record that\n the State is bound to over see the appointments made\n in this regard illegally or irregularly by the competent\n authorities and the same is to be construed as the\n fraud on the Constitution and such authorities are\n liable for prosecution under the Discipline and Appeal\n Rules and other relevant rules. The State shall be\n vigilant in this regard and the authorities indulging in\n such activities of exercising powers by issuing illegal\n or irregular appointments are to be booked under the\n Discipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be\n shown by the State in this regard, since these all are\n the Constitutional principles required for the State to\n be followed and the State being a modal employer, has\n to implement the Constitutional perspectives and the\n principles scrupulously and without any deviation.\n\n 109. The learned counsel for the petitioner\n contended that in paragraph (15) of the judgment in\n “Umadevi Case”, the Constitution Bench of the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that a distinction\n between regularisation and conferment of permanent\n status in service jurisprudence has to be drawn. This\n Court is of the opinion that the conferment of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 99\n\n permanent status Act, is a general law applicable to\n the employees, in the absence of any special law\n governing the particular subject. However, if any such\n law prevails and covering the field of appointment of\n regularisation and permanent absorption, then the\n general law would not apply. In nutshell, the special\n law and rules will prevail over the general law and the\n special rules in force are to be applied in the relevant\n case.\n\n 110. In view of the discussions made above,\n this Court is of the opinion that the writ petitioners are\n not entitled for any relief of permanent absorption as\n such sought for in this writ petition.”\n\n \n30.Even recently, in the case of \nSecretary to\n\n Government, School Education Department, Chennai Vs.\n\n R.Govindaswamy and others\n reported in (2014) 4 SCC 769, the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the High Courts, in\n\n exercising power under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution will not\n\n issue directions for regularisation, absorption or permanent\n\n continuance, unless the employees claiming regularisation had\n\n been appointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in\n\n accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive process,\n\n against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause contained in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 100\n\nArticles 14\n and \n16\n should be scrupulously followed and Courts\n\n should not issue a direction for regularisation of services of an\n\n employee which would be violative of the constitutional scheme.\n\n While something that is irregular for want of compliance with one\n\n of the elements in the process of selection which does not go to the\n\n root of the process, can be regularised, back door entries,\n\n appointments contrary to the constitutional scheme and / or\n\n appointment of ineligible candidates cannot be regularised.\n\n 31.Thus, the Apex Court in an equal terms directed the\n\n High Courts not to issue directions for regularisation, absorption\n\n or permanent continuance, unless the employees claiming\n\n regularisation had been appointed in pursuance of a regular\n\n recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open\n\n competitive process. In the present case, admittedly,\n\n advertisement was issued in local newspaper. However, the terms\n\n of appointments were notified in the notification itself. The writ\n\n petitioners were appointed on contract basis for one year, rule of\n\n reservation was not followed. Admittedly, such contract\n\n appointments are made to meet out the emergency circumstances\n\n arose on account of the ban for public appointments and the same\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 101\n\n can never be considered as a valid appointments made in\n\n accordance with the recruitment rules in force.\n\n 32.Even recently, in the case of State of Tamil Nadu\n\n and others Vs. A.Singamuthu reported in (2017) 4 SCC 113,\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India made an observation as\n\n follows:-\n\n \n“16.In State of Rajasthan vs. Daya Lal [State\n of Rajasthan\n v. Daya Lal, (2011) 2 SCC 429 : (2011) 1\n SCC (L&S) 340] , this Court has considered the scope\n of regularisation of irregular or part-time\n appointments in all possible eventualities and this\n Court clearly laid down that part-time employees are\n not entitled to seek regularisation as they do not work\n against any sanctioned posts. It was also held that\n part-time employees in government-run institutions\n can in no case claim parity in salary with regular\n employees of the Government on the principle of\n equal pay for equal work. Relevant excerpt from \nthe\n said judgment\n is as under: (SCC pp. 435-36, para 12)\n\n 12. We may at the outset refer to the following well-\n\n settled principles relating to regularisation and parity\n in pay, relevant in the context of these appeals:\n\n (i) The High Courts, in exercising power\n under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution will not issue\n directions for regularisation, absorption or\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 102\n\n permanent continuance, unless the employees\n claiming regularisation had been appointed in\n pursuance of a regular recruitment in accordance\n with relevant rules in an open competitive process,\n against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause\n contained in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n should be\n scrupulously followed and courts should not issue a\n direction for regularisation of services of an employee\n which would be violative of constitutional scheme.\n\n While something that is irregular for want of\n compliance with one of the elements in the process of\n selection which does not go to the root of the process,\n can be regularised, back door entries, appointments\n contrary to the constitutional scheme and/or\n appointment of ineligible candidates cannot be\n regularised.\n\n (ii) Mere continuation of service by a\n temporary or ad hoc or daily-wage employee, under\n cover of some interim orders of the court, would not\n confer upon him any right to be absorbed into\n service, as such service would be litigious\n employment. Even temporary, ad hoc or daily- wage\n service for a long number of years, let alone service\n for one or two years, will not entitle such employee to\n claim regularisation, if he is not working against a\n sanctioned post. Sympathy and sentiment cannot be\n grounds for passing any order of regularisation in the\n absence of a legal right.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 103\n\n (iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for\n regularisation with a cut-off date (that is a scheme\n providing that persons who had put in a specified\n number of years of service and continuing in\n employment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible\n to others who appointed subsequent to the cut-off\n date, to claim or contend that the scheme should be\n applied to them by extending the cut-off date or seek\n a direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for\n successive cut-off dates.\n\n (iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to\n seek regularisation as they are not working against\n any sanctioned posts. There cannot be a direction for\n absorption, regularisation or permanent continuance\n of part-time temporary employees.\n\n \n(v) Part-time temporary employees in\n government- run institutions cannot claim parity in\n salary with regular employees of the Government on\n the principle of equal pay for equal work. Nor can\n employees in private employment, even if serving full-\n time, seek parity in salary with government\n employees. The right to claim a particular salary\n against the State must arise under a contract or\n under a statute.[See \nState of Karnataka v. Uma Devi\n\n (\n3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC\n 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , M. Raja v. CEERI\n Educational Society[M. Raja v.

Dayanand\n [Official http://www.judis.nic.in Liquidator v.\n Dayanand, (2008) 10 SCC 1 : (2009) 1 SCC (L&S)\n 943] .] (emphasis supplied)\n\n 17. The learned Single Judge of the High\n Court, while allowing the writ filed by the respondent\n extended the benefit of the said GOMs No. 22 dated\n 28-2-2006 and directed the appellants to grant\n regularisation of respondent's service from the date\n of completion of ten years of service with salary and\n other benefits. The learned Judge failed to take note\n of the fact that as per GOMs No. 22 dated 28-2-2006,\n the services of employees working in various\n government departments on full-time daily-wage\n basis, who have completed more than ten years of\n continuous service as on 1-1-2006 will be regularised\n and not part-time masalchis like the respondent\n herein. In GOMs No. 84 dated 18-6-2012, the\n Government made it clear that GOMs No. 22 dated\n 28-2- 2006 is applicable only to full-time daily wagers\n and not to part-time daily wagers. The respondent\n was temporarily appointed part-time worker as per\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 105\n\n Tamil Nadu Finance Code, Vol. 2, Appendix 5 and his\n appointment was completely temporary. The\n respondent being appointed as part-time masalchi,\n cannot compare himself to full-time daily wagers and\n seek benefit of GOMs No. 22 dated 28-2- 2006. The\n Single Judge also failed to consider that the\n Government did not grant regularisation of services\n of any part-time employee on completion of ten years\n of his service as envisaged under GOMs No. 22 dated\n 28-2- 2006.\n\n 18. The learned Single Judge erred in\n extending the benefit of GOMs No. 22 dated\n 28-2-2006 to the respondent that too retrospectively\n from the date of completion of ten years of service of\n the respondent. The respondent was appointed on\n 1-4-1989 and completed ten years of service on\n 31-3-1999. As rightly contended by the learned\n Senior Counsel for the appellants, if the respondent is\n to be given monetary benefits from the date of\n completion of ten years of service, that is, from\n 1-4-1999 till the date of his regularisation, that is,\n 18-6-2012, the financial commitment to the State\n would be around Rs 10,85,113 (approximately)\n towards back wages apart from pension which will\n have a huge impact on the State exchequer. That\n apart, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\n submitted that in respect of Registration Department,\n about 172 persons were regularised under various\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 106\n\n G.Os. and if the impugned order is sustained, the\n Government will have to pay the back wages to all\n those persons from the date of completion of ten\n years in service and this will have a huge impact on\n the State exchequer. Since the impugned order\n directing regularisation of the respondent from the\n date of completion of their ten years would adversely\n affect the State exchequer in a huge manner, the\n impugned order cannot be sustained on this score\n also.\n\n 19. It is pertinent to note that even the\n regularisation of services of part-time employees vide\n G.O. (Rt.) No. 505 Finance (AA-2) Department dated\n 14-10- 2009 and G.O. (2D) No. 32 Finance (T.A. 2)\n Department dated 26-3-2010 was effected by\n extending the benefit of G.O. dated 28-2-2006 only\n from the date of government orders and not from the\n date of completion of their ten years of service. The\n Division Bench also failed to take note that GOMs No.\n 22 P & AR Dept. dated 28-2-2006 is applicable only to\n full-time daily-wage employees and who had\n completed ten years of continuous service as on 1-1-\n 2006 and not to part-time employees. As per G.O.\n (Rt.) No. 84 dated 18-6-2012, the respondent is\n entitled to the monetary benefits only from the date\n of issuance of government order regularising his\n service, that is, 18-6- 2012. The impugned order\n [Commercial Taxes and Registration Deptt., State of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 107\n\n T.N. v. A. Singamuthu, Writ Appeal No. 1209 of 2012,\n decided on\n 4-7-2012 (Mad)] of the Division Bench affirming the\n order [A. Singamuthu v. Commercial Taxes and\n Registration Deptt., State of T.N., WP No. 26702 of\n 2010, order dated 26-11- 2010 (Mad)] of the Single\n Judge granting benefits to the respondent from the\n date of completion of ten years of service is erroneous\n and the same is liable to be set aside.”\n\n 33.In view of the legal principles settled and in view of\n\n the fact that initial appointment of the writ petitioners were on\n\n contract basis for one year period and the Government also\n\n consistently, rejected the claim of the writ petitioners for\n\n regularisation and permanent absorption, this Court is of the\n\n opinion that the writ petitioners have not established any\n\n acceptable legal ground to grant such relief as such sought for in\n\n the present Writ Petitions. Accordingly, this Court is inclined to\n\n pass the following order:-\n\n “1.The relief sought for in the present Writ\n\n Petitions stands rejected.\n\n 2.The writ petitioners shall be permitted\n\n to continue in service, if their services are required\n\n to meet out the emergency circumstances and till\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 108\n\n the regular appointments are made in accordance\n\n with recruitment rules in force for the post of\n\n Pharmacists and Staff Nurses. If the writ\n\n petitioners are qualified, they are also permitted to\n\n participate in the process of selection for\n\n recruitment to the post of Pharmacists and Staff\n\n Nurses.\n\n 3.In view of the fact that the writ\n\n petitioners are working as Pharmacists and Staff\n\n Nurses, medical facilities to be provided to the\n\n citizens cannot be affected. Providing of medical\n\n facilities is of paramount importance and the right\n\n to medical facility is now an integral part of \nArticle\n\n 21\n of the Constitution of India. Thus, the State and\n\n authorities are bound to provide medical facility to\n\n all the citizens. In the event of ousting the service\n\n of these Pharmacists and Staff Nurses immediately,\n\n the same will disturb the treatments to be provided\n\n to the patients, who are attending the Corporation\n\n hospitals. Thus, the actions in this regard must be\n\n slowly taken by the Corporation without affecting\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 109\n\n the medical treatments to be provided to the\n\n citizens at large.”\n\n 34.With these observations, these Writ Petitions stand\n\n dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous\n\n petitions are closed.\n\n 17.06.2019\n (½)\n Index : Yes/No\n Internet : Yes/No\n\n Myr\n\n To\n 1.The Secretary to Government,\n State of Tamil Nadu,\n Municipal Administration and\n Water Supply Department,\n Secretariat, Chennai-600 009.\n\n 2.The Commissioner of Municipality Administration,\n Ezhilagam, Annex VI Floor,\n Chepauk, Chennai-600 005.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f 110\n\n S.M.SUBRAMANIAM,J.\n\n Myr\n\n W.P.(MD)Nos.10895 to 10897, 14099 to 14101,\n 11457, 10866, 11084, 10752 to 10758, 11427, 11287 to\n 11293, 11003, 10981 to 10985, 16089 to 16096 of 2014\n\n 17.06.2019\n (½)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in",
