This is a petition filed under\nSection 9\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 (for short 'the Act'), whereby, the petitioner has\n\nprayed for interim measures pending the arbitral proceedings.\n\n2. An interesting question, which has arisen for consideration in the\n\npresent case before the initiation of arbitral proceedings, is as to\n\nwhether the respondent has any legal right under the contractual\n\nscheme the parties stand, to interfere in the petitioner's managing and\n\noperating its Co-generation plant and attempt to lock, stock and barrel,\n\noust the petitioner from operating and managing its own Co-generation\n\nPower Plant.\n\n3. The petitioner's case, is of coercive actions having taken place to\n\nouts the petitioner from the Co-generation plant by the respondent after\n\nthe present petition was filed on 12 October 2021. The respondent using\n\nits dominating position as a powerful sugar factory.\n\nPVR 3 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n4. The petitioner company was incorporated as a special purpose\n\nvehicle by its parent company Gammon Infrastructure Project Limited,\n\nto undertake installation and running of the Co-generation plant at the\n\nrespondent's sugar factory. The respondent is a well-established co-\n\noperative sugar factory situated at Pravara Nagar, District Ahmednagar,\n\nand is registered under the\nMaharashtra Co-operative Societies\n\nAct,1960\n.\n\n5. Disputes and differences have arisen between the parties under\n\nthe Project Development Agreement dated 12 July 2010 (for short \"the\n\nPDA\") whereunder the petitioner had agreed to set up a co-generation\n\npower plant (for short the \"Co-gen plant\") on a Built-Own-Operate-\n\nTransfer basis (BOOT) basis, on land to be provided by the respondent\n\nto the petitioner on a lease for a term of 28 years and 6 months. Under\n\nthe PDA, the petitioner was to utilize the agreed quantity of bagasse fuel\n\nand bio-gas to be supplied by the respondent being generated by the\n\nrespondent's sugar factory, which were the primary raw materials, to\n\nproduce power and steam. The power/electricity and the steam so\n\ngenerated by the petitioner's Co-gen plant was to be utilised/consumed\n\nby the respondent's sugar factory in its operations. Any excess power to\n\nbe generated could be sold in the open market by the petitioner. The\n\nassets of the plant were to be transferred to the respondent on the\n\n\"Assets Transfer Date\" being twenty five years from the date the co-gen\n\nplant commences commercial operation.\n\nPVR 4 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n6. The Co-gen plant was accordingly, set up on land as provided by\n\nthe respondent, for which a separate lease deed dated 12 July, 2010 was\n\nexecuted between the parties. There is no dispute between the parties in\n\nregard to the execution of the PDA and the land lease agreement. The\n\narbitration agreement between the parties is contained in clause 33.2 of\n\nthe PDA.\n\n7. The case of the petitioner is that in accordance with the terms and\n\nconditions of the PDA, the petitioner at a cost of about Rs.274 crores has\n\nset up a Co-gen plant after undertaking substantial borrowings from the\n\nbanks. This was as agreed between the parties. To be discussed in some\n\ndetail, hereafter, the PDA contemplated minimum quantity of bagasse as\n\nalso biogas to be supplied by the respondent to the petitioner in the\n\nspecific manner as agreed in the PDA. It, however, appears that friction\n\nstarted mounting between the parties from the crushing season 2015-16,\n\nas according to the petitioner, the respondent was not supplying the\n\nrequisite agreed quantity of bagasse and biogas, so that the agreed\n\nquantity of power generation can be achieved by the co-gen plant. The\n\npetitioner had to depend on raw materials (coal etc) from outside\n\nsources which were procured at heavy costs. The petitioner has\n\ncontended that such short supply of bagassee and bio-gas continued for\n\nthe subsequent crushing seasons upto 2020-21. This outsourcing of raw\n\nmaterials to maintain the power generation led to heavy financial\n\nburden on the petitioner. Consequent to which the parties entered into a\nPVR 5 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nsupplementary agreement dated January 2015 whereunder the\n\nrespondent agreed to refund the petitioner an amount of Rs. 13.5 crores.\n\nAs the situation on the supply of bagasse and bio-gas did not improve,\n\nthe parties entered into a second supplementary agreement dated 30\n\nOctober, 2018, to have an arrangement under which for a limited period\n\nof one year i.e. from 01 November, 2018 to 31 October, 2019, the\n\npetitioner permitted the respondent to operate the plant strictly in a\n\nmanner as agreed in the said agreement. It is not in dispute that by\n\nefflux of the one year period, the respondent's right to operate the co-\n\ngen plant ceased. However, it is the case of the petitioner that\n\nnonetheless the respondent was causing interference in the petitioner\n\noperating and managing the co-gen plant, which according to the\n\npetitioner was with an ultimate aim to take over the Co-gen plant from\n\nthe petitioner, by exploiting the situation of financial distress of the\n\npetitioner. In these circumstances, this petition was filed for praying the\n\nfollowing interim measures pending the arbitral proceedings:-\n\n\"a. That pending the hearing and final disposal of the arbitral\nproceedings, making of the arbitral Award and until final execution of the\narbitral Award, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to restrain the Respondent,\nits board of directors, promoters, partners, employees, agents,\nrepresentative and any one acting on behalf of the Respondent, in any\nmanner from engaging any third party for the operation and maintenance\nof the Co-generation plant owned by the Petitioner;\n\nb. That pending the hearing and final disposal of the arbitral\nproceedings, making of the arbitral Award and until final execution of the\narbitral Award, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to restrain the Respondent,\nits board of directors, promoters, partners, employees, agents,\nrepresentative and any one acting on behalf of the Respondent, in any\nmanner from entering the premises of the Petitioner's Co-generation plant\nand from carrying out any work/activity for the repairs/ maintenance/\noperation of the Petitioner Co-generation plant;\n\nPVR 6 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nc. That pending the hearing and disposal of arbitral proceedings,\n\nmaking of the arbitral Award and until final execution of the arbitral\nAward, this Hon'ble Court be pleased to order and direct Respondent to\ndeposit in this Hon'ble Court Rs. 126,94,00,000/- (Rupees One Hundred\nand Twenty Six Crores and Ninety-Four Lakhs only) in terms of particulars\nof claim annexed as EXHIBIT - \"L\" hereto, or a part thereof, to secure the\nclaim of the Petitioner, failing which, the Respondent be directed to\nfurnish a bank guarantee for the said amount in such manner as this\nHon'ble Court deems fit and appropriate;\n\nd. That without prejudice to prayer clauses (a - c) and in the\nalternative, the Respondent be directed to forthwith install the biogas\nstainless steel pipeline in the Petitioner's Co-generation plant;\n\ne. That without prejudice to prayer clause (a - c) and in the\nalternative, pending the hearing and disposal of Arbitration proceedings,\nmaking of the Arbitral Award and until execution of the Arbitral Award,\nthe Respondent be directed to disclose on oath details of all assets and\nproperties (both movable and immovable) owned by the Respondent,\ngiving complete details along with documents of title to the same, within\ntwo weeks from the date of an order to this effect;\n\nf. That without prejudice to prayer clause (a - c) and in the\nalternative, and pending the hearing and disposal of Arbitration\nproceedings, making of the Arbitral Award and until execution of the\nArbitral Award, that this Hon'ble Court be pleased to pass an order\ndirecting the Respondent, its board of directors, promoters, partners,\nemployees, agents, representative and any one acting on behalf of the\nRespondent, or otherwise howsoever, be restrained by an order and\ninjunction from in any manner giving for repairs/ maintenance/\nmodification, selling, transferring, disposing, alienating or encumbering or\npledging or mortgaging or hypothecating or charging or parting with\npossession of or transferring, or inducting anyone else into or creating any\nright, title or interest or license in favour of anyone else in respect of the\nassets of Respondent;\"\n\n8. The petitioner has thereafter filed an interim application (Interim\n\nApplication (l) No.3343 of 2022) based on some subsequent\n\ndevelopments praying for the following reliefs:-\n\n\"a) this Hon'ble Court be pleased to restrain the Respondent and its\nservants/agents from running and/or operating the Petitioner's Co-\n\ngeneration plant in any manner whatsoever;\"\n\n9. In the said interim application a specific concern is raised by the\n\npetitioner inter alia in regard to the issue of safety of the co-gen plant\nPVR 7 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nwhich is stated to be a fully automated plant. The petitioner has raised\n\na concern in regard to the respondent entering the co-gen plant and mis-\n\nhandling of the co-gen plant and, more particularly of the boiler. It is\n\nthe petitioner's case that the respondent started running and operating\n\nthe said co-gen plant for the crushing season 2021-2022.\n\n(II) Pleadings\nFactual Antecedents\n\n10. Having briefly adverted to the controversy, the factual matrix\n\nneeds to be adverted:-\n\n11. As noted, disputes have arisen between the parties under the PDA\n\ndated 12 July 2010. It is the petitioner's case as per Clause 4.5 of the\n\nPDA that the respondent was to supply to the petitioner's co-gen plant\n\nbagasse and biogas as per the agreed minimum quantity. Such bagasse\n\nand biogas was to be processed as per the requirements as agreed\n\nbetween the parties under Schedule-I of the PDA. The generation of any\n\nsurplus power as also the steam, after the requirement of the\n\nrespondent was satisfied could be sold to any third party by the\n\npetitioner.\n\n12. It is the petitioner's case, that the petitioner indisputedly being\n\nthe owner of the Co-gen's plant and machinery, was entitled to operate\n\nthe co-gen plant and upto to the assets transfer date, that is, 25 years\n\nfrom the commercial operation's date, which was to be a period up to 30\nPVR 8 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nJune, 2041, without any obstruction or interference from the respondent\n\nas agreed under Clause 1.2 of the PDA.\n\n13. As per the terms of the PDA, for the purpose of setting up of the\n\nCo-gen plant, land was to be made available to the petitioner by the\n\nrespondents. Accordingly a \"land lease deed\" dated 12 July, 2010 was\n\nexecuted between the parties, where-under the respondent as a lessor\n\nhad agreed to lease to the petitioner land admeasuring 50.81 acres, for a\n\nperiod of twenty eight years and six months on monthly rent of\n\nRs.5,08,100/-. As contended by the petitioner under such lease deed,\n\nthe petitioner was fully and absolutely entitled to quietly hold, possess\n\nand use the leased land and any part thereof, without any eviction,\n\ninterruption, disturbance, claim and demand whatsoever, by the\n\nrespondent or any other person during the lease period. The petitioner\n\nhas relied on the different clauses of the PDA, to support its case on its\n\nentitlement of supply of bagasse and the bio-gas fuels and the\n\npetitioner's ownership of the Co-gen plant and its entitlement to hold\n\nthe land in lease upto the 'assets transfer date'. The relevant clauses of\n\nthe PDA and the 'land lease deed' would be referred in the later part of\n\nthis order.\n\n14. In January 2015, a supplementary agreement (for short \"SA\")\n\nwas entered between the petitioner and the respondent whereunder the\n\nrespondent inter alia agreed to refund to the petitioner an amount of\nPVR 9 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nRs.13.50 crores, which was advanced by the petitioner towards\n\nmodernization of the sugar plant. This was on the assurance that the\n\npetitioner would complete and commission the co-gen plant by 31\n\nMarch 2015.\n\n15. The petitioner has contended that the Co-gen plant was set- up\n\nby the petitioner, and was made fully functional. The commercial\n\noperations of the Co-gen plant started on 6 November 2015, being the\n\n\"Commercial operation date\" as defined in the PDA, from which date\n\nthe period of 25 years would be reckoned for the \"assets transfer date\"\n\nto be arrived. This was from the crushing season 2015-2016. The\n\npetitioner started producing steam and electricity in the Co-gen plant,\n\nwhich was being supplied to the respondent as per the PDA.\n\n16. The petitioner contends that during the crushing season for the\n\nyear 2015-2016, the respondent supplied only 174,380 metric tons of\n\nbagasse fuel as against the minimum assured quantity of 264,270 metric\n\ntons, in terms of the PDA. The short supply was of 90340 metric tons of\n\nbagasse. The petitioner, therefore, was required to source coal as a\n\nsubstitute fuel, which caused heavy financial burden on the petitioner. It\n\nis the petitioner's contention that even for the next crushing season\n\n2016-17, the respondent again supplied only 124031 metric tons of\n\nbagasse as against 264720 metric tons of bagasse, which was again a\n\nshort supply of 140,689 metric tons. Further, the respondent also did\nPVR 10 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nnot supply bio- gas fuel to the petitioner. Thus, even for such crushing\n\nseason, the petitioner had to source coal as the substitute fuel as also\n\nsource water from the open market, which again added to the heavy\n\nfinancial burden of the petitioner.\n\n17. The respondent on such backdrop, addressed a letter dated 10\n\nNovember 2017 to the petitioner on issues arising under the PDA, inter\n\nalia stating that the petitioner had not completed modification work of\n\nthe boiler despite the crushing season for 2017-2018 having begun in\n\nNovember 2017. The petitioner by its letter dated 22 November 2017\n\nresponded to such letter denying the respondent's contentions. In such\n\nletter, the petitioner inter alia stated that the operations of the 30 mega\n\nwatt Co-gen plant as installed by the petitioner in the premises of the\n\nrespondent, was fully dependent upon respondent making available the\n\ninput fuels (bagasse and bio gas) as per the quantities under the PDA,\n\nwhich was the respondent's primary obligation. The petitioner recorded\n\nthat the petitioner had faced immense difficulties and challenges in\n\nrunning the plant with full capacity principally due to non-compliance of\n\nthe obligation by the respondent on supply of such input fuels and in the\n\nprocess, the petitioner had suffered losses as also additional costs. The\n\npetitioner also stated that to mitigate the defaults of the respondent, the\n\npetitioner had been continuously exploring possible solutions in a\n\nmanner which would be beneficial to the petitioner and the respondent.\n\nThe petitioner also complained that the petitioner was not informed in\nPVR 11 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nadvance by the respondent, of the commencement of the crushing\n\nseason, so as to enable the respondent to get ready, of exact date when\n\nthe plant was to be operationalized for the crushing season. It was\n\nrecorded that despite such lapse on the part of the respondent, the\n\npetitioner had kept the boiler operational for a reasonable period of\n\ntime, including to have an inspection and re-inspection of the boiler by\n\nthe Government authorities. The petitioner also stated that the power\n\nsupply to the respondent from the petitioner was never discontinued\n\nand that the petitioner was continuously supplying the required power\n\nto the respondent, throughout the year. The petitioner stated that\n\nalthough the operations of the respondent's sugar factory for the\n\ncrushing season commenced on 10 November 2017, however, till the\n\ntime, such letter was being addressed by the petitioner, the respondent\n\nhad not achieved the capacity of 6000 metric ton per day. It was stated\n\nthat the respondent's distillery plant could not commence its operations\n\nas the works on the distillery plant were still in progress. The petitioner\n\naccordingly, stated that the financial stress caused to the petitioner was\n\ndue to failure of the respondent to fulfill the obligations and its non-\n\nadherence to the agreed conditions under the PDA. The petitioner thus\n\non such counts, claimed from the respondent an amount of Rs.48.12\n\ncrores, towards the financial losses suffered by it, as a consequence of\n\nthe non-compliance of its obligation by the respondent under the PDA\n\nand SA.\n\nPVR 12 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n18. The petitioner has stated that despite such conduct, the\n\nrespondent by its letter dated 26 October 2018, requested the petitioner\n\nfor permission to dismantle the petitioner's existing bio-gas pipeline\n\nfrom the Co-gen plant boiler, for the purpose of using it for the\n\nrespondent factory. Such permission was not granted by the petitioner,\n\nhowever, the respondent dismantled the bio-gas stainless steel pipeline\n\nand installed the same within the respondent's factory for captive use.\n\nThe petitioner contends that since then the respondent has been using\n\nthe said pipeline and continues to use it till date. The petitioner has\n\ncontended that the said pipeline was installed by the petitioner for\n\nreceiving bio-gas in compliance of the terms of the PDA, which the\n\nrespondent for its own requirement and without permission or any\n\nauthorization of the petitioner, had dismantled and removed in complete\n\nbreach of the PDA. According to the petitioner, such coercive action of\n\nthe respondent to dismantle the stainless pipeline supplying bio-gas was\n\nfatal to the PDA apart from the fact that this was a direct breach of the\n\nPDA.\n\n19. In the aforesaid situation, on 30 October 2018, a second\n\nagreement titled as \"Second Supplementary Agreement to the Project\n\nDevelopment Agreement (PDA) dated 12 July 2010 and the first\n\nsupplementary agreement dated January 2015\" (for short 'the Second\n\nSA') was entered between the petitioner and the respondent. In the\n\nintroductory paragraph of this agreement, the parties stated that since\nPVR 13 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthe commercial operation date of the project, certain events like drought\n\nhad taken place which were beyond the control of either parties, thereby\n\ncausing prejudice to the smooth running of the plant and affecting\n\ncommercial interests of both the parties. It was stated that on such\n\nbackdrop, the parties were desirous to resolve such situation on a\n\nmutually convenient basis so that the plant can be optimally operated by\n\nleveraging on efficient and appropriate utilization of synergies and local\n\nresources which the respondent could provide to operate the plant, and\n\naccordingly the parties mutually agreed to record the manner of\n\noperation, management and maintenance of the plant in the terms and\n\nconditions as set out in the second SA. The parties agreed that all the\n\nterms and conditions in the second SA shall mutatis mutandis stand\n\ndeemed to be incorporated in the PDA, which shall also stand inter alia\n\namended, to the extent as stated in such agreement, with a stipulation\n\nthat all other provisions of the amended PDA shall remain the same. It\n\nwas also agreed between the parties that the second SA read with the\n\nPDA and the first SA shall constitute the entire understanding between\n\nthe parties. In Clause 8 of this agreement, the parties agreed on a\n\n'Modifying Operational Arrangement', under which it was agreed that\n\nCo-gen plant then run by the petitioner will be operated, managed and\n\nmaintained by the respondent for a period of one year, from the date of\n\nthe modified operational commencement date. In clause 9, the parties\n\nagreed that the tenure of the modified operational arrangement shall\nPVR 14 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\ncommence from 1 November 2018 and shall continue till 31 October\n\n2019. It was agreed that subject to Clause 12 (extension of the modified\n\narrangement) of the Second SA, the modified operational term shall be\n\nextended from time to time by mutual consent of the parties, which shall\n\nbe recorded in writing. In clause 12.4, it was agreed between the\n\nparties, that in the event the terms of the modified operational\n\narrangement, were not to be extended, in that event, the respondent\n\nhad categorically agreed to hand over the plant after completion of\n\nannual maintenance of the plant in good working condition to the\n\npetitioner at least in 15 calendar days prior to the start of the\n\nimmediately succeeding crushing season. It was agreed and\n\nacknowledged between the parties that the respondent shall not have\n\nany right to maintain and operate the plant upon expiry of the modified\n\noperational arrangement term and that the modified arrangement\n\nincluding of provisions thereof, shall automatically stand terminated and\n\nshall fall away. Clause 15.2 of the agreement stipulates that respondent\n\nno.1 agreed not to change, modify, alter, add or remove or do any such\n\nsimilar act to the existing technical set up or the structure of the plant\n\nwithout prior approval of the petitioner. The clauses of the Second\n\nSupplementary Agreement are noted in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\n20. The petitioner has contended that for the next crushing season,\n\nthat is 2019-2020, despite the petitioner's account being classified as\nPVR 15 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nNon-Performing Asset (NPA), and the petitioner's lenders unwilling to\n\nrelease funds for operational requirements of the Co-gen plant, the\n\npromoters of the petitioner infused an additional amount of more than\n\nRs.4 crores towards the maintenance of the Co-gen plant. The petitioner\n\nhas stated that as per Clause 6.6 of PDA the respondent had to intimate\n\nthe petitioner three months in advance, of the tentative date of\n\ncommencement of crushing season for the said year and provide a\n\nfinalized schedule for supply of bagasse and biogas, at least one month\n\nprior to commencement of crushing season. However, the respondent\n\ndid not provide the finalized schedule of the supply of baggasse and\n\nbiogas, either before the commencement of crushing season or during\n\nthe crushing season, thereby breaching the terms of the PDA.\n\n21. The petitioner has stated that the respondent supplied only\n\n109,498 MT of bagasse fuel during the crushing season 2019-20 as\n\nagainst 264,720 MT of bagasse fuel as per the terms of the PDA, which\n\nresulted in shortfall of about 155,222 MT of bagasse fuel. It is also\n\nstated that due to illegal dismantling and removal of biogas pipeline by\n\nthe respondent, the petitioner could not receive biogas, hence, even the\n\nminimum guaranteed quantity of biogas was not supplied to the\n\npetitioner by the respondent. Thus, according to the petitioner, there\n\nwas a forced outage for a period from 7 November 2020 to 23 January\n\n2021 and 25 April 2021 to 6 May 2021 on account of technical\n\ndifficulties like turbine breakdown and issues with the voltage control\nPVR 16 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\ntap changer. It is contended by the petitioner that despite all these\n\ntechnical issues, the petitioner, as requested by the respondent,\n\ncontinued uninterrupted supply of steam through its boiler, as also\n\nelectricity was supplied to the respondent through MSEDCL, thereby\n\nfulfilling its obligations during the forced outage period as per Clause\n\n1.11 and 8.11 of the PDA.\n\n22. It is the petitioner's case that for the next crushing season 2020-\n\n21, the respondent supplied only 168,376 MT of bagasse fuel as against\n\n2,64,720 MT of bagasse fuel in breach of its commitment as per the\n\nterms of the PDA, resulting in a shortfall of nearly 96,344 MT of bagasse\n\nfuel. The petitioner contends that also due to the illegal dismantling\n\nand removal of the bio-gas pipeline by the respondent, the petitioner\n\nwas not supplied the bio-gas, hence, even bio-gas was not supplied by\n\nthe respondent to the petitioner as per the terms of the PDA.\n\n23. The petitioner contends that the respondent, however, by its letter\n\ndated 29 September 2020, intimated the petitioner about the start of\n\ncrushing season 2020-21 from 15 October 2020, when as per Clause 6.6.\n\nof the PDA, the respondent was required to intimate the petitioner three\n\nmonths in advance of the tentative date of commencement of the\n\ncrushing season and provide a finalized schedule of supply of bagasse\n\nand bio-gas at least one month prior to the commencement of crushing\n\nseason. Although the respondent was bound to adhere to the schedule,\nPVR 17 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nhowever, it did not provide a finalized schedule of supply of bagasse and\n\nbio-gas either before the commencement of crushing season or during\n\nthe crushing season, which the petitioner would contend, was clearly in\n\nbreach of the terms of the PDA.\n\n24. It is the petitioner's case that on 24 September 2020 and 25\n\nSeptember 2020, there were discussions between the parties inter alia\n\non the issue of supply of biogas by the respondent to the petitioner,\n\nwherein, it was agreed that the respondent shall restore, the biogas\n\nsupply and transportation pipeline arrangement, so that the respondent\n\ncan resume supply of biogas to the petitioner as per the terms of PDA.\n\nThe petitioner also requested the respondent to issue a written\n\nconfirmation on the re-installation of the said biogas pipeline. However,\n\nno steps were taken by the respondent in that regard.\n\n25. The petitioner has contended that on the above backdrop, an\n\nAddendum Agreement dated 14 October 2020 came to be executed\n\nwherein the respondent has explicitly admitted that over the earlier\n\ncrushing seasons from 2015-16 to 2019-20, the respondent had failed in\n\nits obligations and had short-supplied bagasse equivalent fuel of about\n\n474,435 MT of bagasse. The respondent agreed that over and above the\n\ncontracted supply of 2,64,720 MT of bagasse fuel every crushing season,\n\nit will supply additional quantum of fuel of 1,05,000 MT each of\n\ncrushing seasons 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 and 60000 MT in\nPVR 18 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n2023-24. There was also a condition provided in the said Addendum\n\nAgreement in clause 8, that in the event there is a failure of supply of\n\nbagasse by the respondent as per such agreed terms.\n\n26. The petitioner has contended that even for the crushing season\n\n2020-21, the petitioner faced severe financial losses on account of the\n\nrespondent's failure to supply bagasse and biogas to the petitioner in\n\naccordance with the said agreements, the details of which are set out in\n\na chart as set out in paragraph (19) of the petition. From the chart, the\n\npetitioner contends that for the period from 2015-16 to 2020-21, there\n\nwas a gross revenue loss of Rs.179.36 crores caused to the petitioner\n\nand that the cost of fuel payable and other operating expenses stood at\n\nRs.39.06 crores and Rs.13.35 crores respectively, and the net loss of\n\nrevenue suffered by the petitioner is of Rs.126.94 crores.\n\n27. It is the petitioner's case that in the above situation, the petitioner\n\nby its letter dated 29 May 2021 called upon the respondent to supply the\n\nagreed/contracted quantity of bagasse fuel in accordance with the\n\nAddendum Agreement. The petitioner again by its letters dated 3 August\n\n2021 and 6 August 2021 called upon the respondent to compensate the\n\npetitioner for the short supply of the contracted bagasse fuel. The\n\nrespondent replied to the said letters of the petitioner by its letter dated\n\n4 September 2021, wherein to the surprise of the petitioner, the\n\nrespondent inter alia denied the respondent entering into the said\nPVR 19 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nAddendum Agreement with the petitioner. The respondent also denied\n\nthe short supply of bagasse fuel to the petitioner in accordance with the\n\nsaid agreements. This apart the respondent also restricted the access of\n\nthe petitioner's representatives to the Co-gen plant, by threat and\n\nintimidation, as contended by the petitioner, and instead permitted the\n\nmovement of the respondent's staff and employees.\n\n28. It is on this backdrop, the petitioner has contended that a cause of\n\naction accrued to the petitioner to file the present proceedings in a\n\nglaring urgency. In this context, the following contentions of the\n\npetitioner raised in paragraph 22 of the petition are relevant, and need\n\nto be noted :-\n\n\"22. Shortly thereafter, the Respondent has restricted the access of\nthe Petitioner's representatives to the said Co-gen plant, through\nthreat and intimidation, and has permitted the movement of the\nRespondent's personnel and staff into the Co-gen plant for carrying\nout repair and maintenance work of the plant, without the prior\nconsent/permission of the petitioner. The petitioner address a letter\ndated 18.06.2021 to the Respondent, inter alia bringing forth the\nissues relating to the administration, safety and security of the Co-gen\nplant, as the petitioner apprehended serious threat and damages to\nthe Co-gen plant and machinery and was concerned about its security\nand safety. However, the respondent has not replied to the said letter\nand has also not taken steps to remedy its actions. Hereto annexed\nand marked as EXHIBIT - \"K\" is a copy of the letter dated\n18.06.2021.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n29. It is hence the petitioner's case that the respondent had no\n\nauthority whatsoever under the PDA and allied agreements to restrict\n\nthe access of the petitioner's representative to the co-gen plant by threat\n\nand intimidation and only to force and permit the entry and movement\n\nof the respondent's personnel and staff into the co-gen plant. It is\nPVR 20 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\ncontended that the respondent could not have foisted their employees\n\nfor carrying out repairs and maintenance of the plant, without prior\n\nconsent/permission of the petitioner.\n\n30. The petitioner's contention is that the respondent was intending to\n\ntakeover and operate the petitioner's Co-gen plant for the crushing\n\nseason 2021-22 without the involvement of the petitioner and for such\n\npurpose, also engaged some third parties to operate the petitioner's co-\n\ngen plant. It is stated that the respondent had also placed multiple work\n\norders/purchase orders for the repair and maintenance of the plant and\n\nmachinery of the petitioner's Co-gen plant, with such purpose and\n\nintent, by excluding the petitioner. The petitioner contends that the\n\nrespondent has no right under the said agreements to operate the Co-\n\ngen plant of the petitioner, as the respondent does not have the expertise\n\nto do so, as also the respondent cannot in any manner engage any third\n\nparties, to operate the said co-gen plant which exclusively belongs to the\n\npetitioner. It is contended that all these actions of the respondent are in\n\ncomplete breach of the agreements which have seriously jeopardized the\n\nrights accrued to the petitioner under the said agreements.\n\n31. It is in these circumstances, the petitioner contends that it is\n\nimperative and in the interest of justice that the respondent be\n\nrestrained from operating and maintaining the petitioner's Co-gen plant.\n\nIt is contended that in the absence of any such interim orders, the\nPVR 21 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\npetitioner would be put to irreparable losses of several crores and\n\nimmense hardship which cannot be compensated in terms of money.\n\nApart from this, the petitioner contends that it cannot suffer a brazen\n\nillegality of the respondent dis-housing the petitioner from its own co-\n\ngen plant. It is in these circumstances, the petitioner has filed the\n\npresent petition praying for interim measures as noted above.\n\n32. There is an additional affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioner\n\ndated 26 October, 2021 inter alia placing on record that the respondent\n\nand their persons/employees who are entering upon the petitioner's\n\npremises, who are also entering the co-gen plant and are inter alia\n\ndismantling/damaging the plant and machinery of the petitioner. To\n\nsupport such contention, the petitioner has referred to videos which are\n\nsaved and stored in a pen drive and filed along with the said affidavit.\n\nThere are six video recordings as set out in paragraph 3 of the said\n\naffidavit.\n\n33. As this petition was filed on 12 October 2021, in view of the\n\nsubsequent developments, an Interim Application bearing (Lodging) No.\n\n3343 of 2022 has been filed by the petitioner on 4 February, 2022 inter\n\nalia contending that the respondent has forcibly taken over the running\n\nand operation of the petitioner's co-gen plant. The Co-gen plant being\n\nfully automated, it required a high level of expertise to run and operate\n\nit. It is contended that the respondent cannot foist the persons who\nPVR 22 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nseverely lack technical expertise to run the fully automated co-gen plant.\n\nIt is contended by the petitioner that repeated and continuous\n\nmishandling of the plant by the respondent and more particularly, of the\n\nboiler, was causing grave and irreparable harm and damage to the Co-\n\ngen plant, and if the same is allowed to continue, it is likely that the\n\nboiler may explode and it will not only cause irreparable injury and\n\ndamage to the plant but also lead to loss of human lives. It is stated that\n\nthere have been several instances of boiler tube leakages of the co-gen\n\nplant in the crushing season of 2021-22 is the respondent's foisted\n\nrunning of the co-gen plant. Also in December 2021, there was leakage\n\nin the economizer tube and the plant was required to shut down for 22\n\nhours for repairing the leakages. Further, there were a leakages between\n\n10 January 2022 to 13 January 2022 in the roof tube and the plant was\n\nshut down for about 51 hours for repairing the leakages. Subsequently,\n\nthere was another leakage on 01 February 2022 in the front wall tube\n\npanel and the plant was shut town as on date of filing of the application.\n\nThe petitioner has contended that the leakages are required to be fixed\n\nas per the\nBoilers Act,1923\nread with the Indian Boiler Regulations\n\n(IBR), as also the respondent is using non IBR certificate workers to fix\n\nleakages without finding out the root cause of the persistent leakages.\n\nThe petitioner has referred to the instances of boiler explosions in India\n\nwhich have claimed human lives in those instances. The petitioner has,\n\ntherefore, contended that the respondent has been repeatedly causing\nPVR 23 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\ndamage to the co-gen plant. The petitioner has, therefore, prayed for the\n\nfollowing reliefs in the interim application:-\n\n\"(a) This Hon'ble Court be pleased to restrain the respondent and its\nservants/ agents from running and/or operating the petitioner's co-generation\nplant in any manner whatsoever.\"\n\nRespondent's Pleadings\n\n34. The respondent has filed a reply affidavit dated 21 November,\n\n2021 opposing the grant of ad-interim and interim reliefs as prayed for\n\nin the petition. The respondent has raised a preliminary objection that\n\nthe reliefs claimed by the petitioners are barred under\nSection 41(ha)\nof\n\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1963, in as much as the same would amount to\n\ninterference with the continued provision of power supply under the\n\nfacility created in the infrastructure project jointly undertaken by the\n\npetitioner and the respondent. It is their contention that\nSection 41(ha)\n\nof the Specific Relief Act expressly prohibits the grant of an injunction if\n\nthe same would impede or delay the progress or completion of any\n\ninfrastructure project or interfere with the continued provision of\n\nrelevant facility related thereto or services being related to the matter of\n\nsuch project. It is the respondent's contention that the petitioner intends\n\nto injunct the respondent to prevent any operation or maintenance of\n\nthe Co-gen plant which has been created as part a part of an\n\ninfrastructure agreement for electricity generation between the parties.\n\nHence, granting of such relief would amount to closure of the facility,\n\nbeing the subject matter of the infrastructure project. Such relief,\nPVR 24 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\ntherefore, cannot be granted considering the provisions of\nSection\n\n41(ha)\nof the Specific Relief Act. Supporting such contention, reliance is\n\nplaced on Clause 8.11 of the PDA to contend that the parties have\n\nagreed for providing of continuous and uninterrupted power supply and\n\nsteam to the sugar factory of the respondent.\n\n35. The next contention as urged on behalf of the respondent is to\n\nthe effect that the petitioner by such interim measures is jeopardizing\n\nthe rights of the respondent under the PDA by failing to maintain and\n\nshowing a constant lack of interest in running the co-generation power\n\nplant for the past years. It is contended that, in terms of the provisions\n\nof the PDA, the petitioner was to effect a transfer of the asset, i.e. the co-\n\ngen power plant to the respondent after 25 years from the date of\n\ncommencement of the operation of the plant in a normal working\n\ncondition, this being the essence of the contract. However, according to\n\nthe respondent, the facts demonstrate that the petitioner is not\n\ninterested in running the power plant and has not been maintaining it\n\nsince a long time causing a depreciation in its value. The respondent\n\ncontends that this would render the PDA frustrated much to the\n\ndetriment of the respondent. The respondent, hence, has contended\n\nthat the respondent is entitled to protect its interests by preserving the\n\nCo-gen power plant by keeping it in a working condition as per the\n\nnorms and guidelines specified by the State of Maharashtra.\n\nPVR 25 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n36. The respondent has next contended that the petitioner is not\n\nentitled to any equitable relief on the principle that one who seeks\n\nequity, must do equity. The respondent would contend that the\n\npetitioner has approached the Court with unclean hands and has\n\nsuppressed material and relevant facts in the petition. The suppression\n\nbeing that the fact that Co-gen plant is hypothecated to its lenders by\n\nthe petitioner and is also being considered for attachment in a separate\n\nlitigation before this Court with one of its creditors namely 'Ask Energy\n\nSolutions Pvt. Ltd.' has not been disclosed. It is contended that the\n\npetitioner has also failed to disclose that it has not made payment of its\n\ndebts owed to the respondent under the PDA. It is contended that the\n\nintention of the petitioner is to stall the functioning of the respondent's\n\nsugar factory, just before the crushing season in an attempt to extort\n\nmoney from the respondent knowing fully well that the functioning of\n\nthe respondent's sugar factory is completely dependent on the provision\n\nof power and steam as supplied by the co-gen plant. The respondent\n\ncontends that the petition being filed just at the beginning of the\n\ncrushing season, itself, is indicative of a coercive attempt on the part of\n\nthe petitioner so that the respondent is made to purchase the Co-gen\n\nplant at an exorbitant price.\n\n37. The respondent has next contended that the respondent has\n\nsignificantly altered its position upon the assurances of the petitioner.\n\nOn this aspect, the respondent contends that the petitioner did not have\nPVR 26 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nany wherewithal to run the co-gen plant owing to its acute financial\n\ndistress, hence it had requested the respondent to invest money and\n\npersonnel, for the upkeep of the Co-gen plant. Pursuant to such request\n\nof the petitioner, the respondent had agreed to co-manage the co-gen\n\nplant with the petitioner and has made huge investment of monies\n\ntowards the maintenance of the Co-gen plant over the past crushing\n\nseasons. Hence, the respondent had altered its position on the assurance\n\nof the petitioner that uninterrupted power and steam is supplied to the\n\nrespondent. It is contended that, however, the petitioner, after\n\nprofiteering at the cost of the respondent, has now reneged from its\n\nassurances, and is seeking to defeat the legitimate rights of the\n\nrespondent. It is hence the respondent's case that the petitioner is not\n\nentitled to seek ouster of the respondent from the premises of the power\n\nplant facility.\n\n38. The respondent would next contend that the reliefs claimed by the\n\npetitioner are beyond the scope of\nSection 9\nof the Act, in as much as\n\nthe petitioner has claimed final reliefs in the garb of an ad-interim\n\ninjunction in the instant petition, which is clear from the prayers as the\n\npetitioner has also inter-alia sought installation of the bio-gas pipeline.\n\nSuch relief cannot be granted without proper adjudication of the\n\npetition on merits by the arbitral tribunal.\n\nPVR 27 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n39. It is next contended that no irreparable loss or damage would be\n\ncaused to the petitioner if the Co-gen power plant is continued to be\n\noperated by the respondent, moreover, if the Co-gen plant ceases to\n\noperate, the workers of the respondent would suffer irreparable losses\n\nand damage to their income and livelihood. In support of such\n\ncontention, it is stated that the respondent's business is a source of\n\nlivelihood for thousands of people which include the respondent's staff,\n\nworkmen, employees, labour, local farmers and their families from\n\nwhom the respondent purchases sugarcane, farming labour,\n\ntransporters, harvest labour etc. It is stated that the entire sugar\n\nindustry depends upon the 'crushing season'. The start of the crushing\n\nseason is in the month of October each year and continues till the end of\n\nApril and beginning of May of the year thereafter. It is stated that the\n\noperations of the sugar factory are dependent upon the continuous and\n\nuninterrupted supply of electricity and steam. It is hence the\n\nrespondent's contention that with such intentions the PDA was entered\n\ninto between the petitioner and respondent for setting up of Co-gen\n\nplant on a BOOT basis.\n\n40. In paragraph 22 of the reply affidavit, setting out as to how the\n\nCo-gen plant is critical to the respondent's sugar factory, the respondent\n\nhas stated that it was the petitioner who had called upon the respondent\n\nto purchase spares, consumables and other materials required for\n\nmaintenance activities from time to time, prior to the start of crushing\nPVR 28 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nseason 2020-21. It is contended that the representatives of the petitioner\n\ninvited/requested the respondent's representatives to take steps to\n\njointly carry out the maintenance activities in the co-gen plant, which\n\nwas agreed by the respondent as it was critical for the respondent to\n\nkeep the Co-gen plant working. It is stated that meetings were held\n\nfrom time to time between the representatives of the parties and various\n\ndecisions were taken jointly as to the schedule of work to be undertaken\n\nand the payments to be made to the vendors. As the contention as\n\nurged by the respondent in this paragraph of the affidavit was subject\n\nmatter of quite some discussion, the contents are required to be noted\n\nwhich read thus:-\n\n\"The Respondent has thus been handling the maintenance activity of\nthe Co-gen plant prior to the start of the crushing season of 2020-21\nas well. Acting on the requests/ invitations of the Petitioner, the\nRespondent has deputed its labour, personnel, engineers at the Co-gen\nplant to look into the day-to-day operations of the Co-gen plant. The\nCo-gen plant has therefore been in the joint possession of the\nPetitioner and the Respondent, uninterruptedly for the past couple of\nyears. The Respondent and the Petitioner have been provided\nunrestricted access to the Co-gen plant and the sugar factory. Further\nacting on the various representations of the Petitioner (including oral\ndiscussions between the engineers/staff of Petitioner and the\nRespondent), the Respondent has provided spares, consumables, paid\nsalaries of staff of the Petitioner, provided operational support by\ndeputing personnel from time to time to the Co-gen plant. In this\nentire endeavour (which is not the business of the Respondent) the\nRespondent has spent crores of Rupees in respect of the Co-gen plant's\noperations and running at the instance and requests of the Petitioner,\nmade from time to time. The Petitioner has not repaid the Respondent\nfor these expenses and has thus earned the benefits of all the\nexpenses/work put in by the Respondent. In these circumstances it is\nsubmitted that the Petitioner is now estopped from seeking the reliefs\nset out in the aforesaid\nSection 9\nPetition against the Respondent.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n41. Further the reply affidavit thereafter sets out the details in regard\n\nto payments to vendors and supply of material, spares as required by the\nPVR 29 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\npetitioner and the amount spent on this count by the respondent. The\n\nrespondent has also referred to an arbitral award dated 15 June, 2019\n\npassed against the petitioner and in favour of one Ask Energy Solutions\n\nPvt. Ltd.. It is stated that in the execution proceedings filed by the said\n\naward creditor, the respondent has been joined as a garnishee, which\n\naccording to the respondent clearly shows that the petitioner is not in a\n\nposition to maintain the power plant.\n\n42. The respondent contends that it had incurred vendor's payments\n\nat the start of crushing seasons 2020-21 and 2021-22, having supplied\n\nmaterial to the petitioner, from the respondent's stores, which would\n\nalso go to show that the petitioner is not in a position to run the co-gen\n\nplant. Also, the salaries of the petitioner's staff were borne by the\n\nrespondent, as also, the respondent has deputed its engineers and staff\n\nwho have been maintaining the maintenance activity of the power plant\n\nmuch prior to the start of crushing season 2020-21. It is stated that\n\neven payment towards repair of the power plant turbine to an extent of\n\nRs. 90,21,693/- was made by the respondent. The respondent has also\n\nstated that substantial payments were made by the respondent to\n\nMSEDCL aggregating to 2.72 crores on behalf of the petitioner. It is for\n\nsuch reasons, the respondent would contend that the reliefs be denied to\n\nthe petitioner and the petition be rejected.\n\nPVR 30 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nPetitioner's Rejoinder Affidavit\n\n43. An affidavit in rejoinder dated 02 December, 2021 is filed on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner inter alia denying the respondent's case in its\n\nreply affidavit. The petitioner in paragraph 9 (xviii) has denied in\n\ntotality the respondent's case of any joint possession of the Co-gen plant\n\nof the petitioner and that of the respondent. The petitioner states that\n\nthe statements, insinuations and allegations made in the said paragraph\n\nare false and baseless. The petitioner denies that the Co-gen plant has\n\nbeen in joint possession of the Petitioner and the Respondent for the\n\npast couple of years, as also the respondent's contention that the\n\nrespondent had provided spares, consumables, paid salaries of staff of\n\nthe Petitioner, provided operational support by deputing personnel from\n\ntime to time to the co-gen plant and that the Respondent has spent\n\ncrores of Rupees in respect of the co-gen plant's operations at the\n\ninstance and requests of the Petitioner. The petitioner states that the\n\nrespondent has withheld from this Court the fact that there was a\n\nmutual arrangement between the petitioner and the respondent wherein\n\nthe respondent had agreed to make certain operational payments and\n\nbear certain operational expenses on behalf of the petitioner, in order to\n\ncompensate the petitioner for the losses caused to it due to the short-\n\nsupply of bagasse fuel by the respondent. It is stated that the said\n\narrangement was entered into keeping in mind the fact that the said\n\noperational expenses and operational payments made by the respondent\nPVR 31 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\non behalf of the petitioner, would eventually be set-off with the amounts\n\nthat were due and payable by the respondent to the petitioner, due to\n\nthe short-supply of bagasse fuel by the respondent to the petitioner. The\n\npetitioner has accordingly denied the case of the respondent and the\n\nallegations as made in the reply affidavit.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder Affidavit\n\n44. The respondent although had filed a reply affidavit, as also when\n\na rejoinder affidavit was filed on behalf of the petitioner, and what could\n\nbe filed by the respondent was a sur-rejoinder, that too, with the leave of\n\nthe Court, very unusually and the respondent again filed a second reply\n\naffidavit dated 15th February, 2022 titled as \"Affidavit in reply on behalf\n\nof the respondent to the petition dated 12 October, 2021 and the\n\nrejoinder dated 02 December, 2021 and the Additional Affidavit dated\n\n26 October, 2021 filed by the Petitioner dated 15 February, 2022\". On\n\nbehalf of the petitioner, there was a vehement objection to this affidavit,\n\nbeing accepted and taken on record. The Court had accordingly passed\n\nan order to accept the affidavit to be taken on record subject to the\n\nobjections as raised on behalf of the petitioner.\n\n45. This affidavit is again a detailed affidavit to the petition, in which\n\nthe respondent has inter alia repeated its plea that the petitioner was\n\npotentially an insolvent company and its accounts being classified as a\n\n'Non Performing Asset' (NPA) by its lenders since December 2017. The\nPVR 32 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nrespondent has stated that the petitioner is a wholly owned subsidiary of\n\nGammon Infrastructure Private Limited (for short \"GIPL\"), now known\n\nas AJR Infra and Tolling Limited. It is stated that also several\n\nsubsidiaries of GIPL are facing insolvency proceedings under the\n\nInsolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (\"IBC\") before the National\n\nCompany Law Tribunal (\"NCLT\"). It is stated that some of them have\n\nalready been admitted for corporate insolvency resolution process under\n\nthe IBC. It is thus contended that evidently, the 'Gammon group of\n\ncompanies' of which the petitioner is a part, is under severe financial\n\ndistress and is at the risk of being liquidated. It is hence contended that,\n\nthe petitioner no longer has the wherewithal to run, operate or maintain\n\nthe Co-gen plant. It is stated that the petitioner has not arranged any\n\nmaterials and had barely stationed 16 employees to run the power plant,\n\nwhose salaries have also not been paid for more than 9 months. All\n\nthese factors clearly indicate that the petitioner has not been\n\nmaintaining the power plant for a long time or making any efforts to\n\nkeep it in a functional state. The respondent has also set out that\n\nsubsequent to its reply affidavit dated 21 November, 2021, there was\n\nagitation at the respondent's factory by hundreds of persons and\n\nlabourers. That the labourers also approached the Sugar Commissioner,\n\nPune, who had convened a meeting on 17 November, 2021 to resolve\n\nthe issues raised by the labourers on an urgent basis. The respondent\n\nhas referred to the proceedings before the Sugar Commissioner\nPVR 33 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nculminating into an order dated 27 December, 2021 passed by the Sugar\n\nCommissioner recording that the dispute between the parties cannot be\n\nresolved amicably hence either party could refer the dispute to\n\narbitration according to provisions of Clause 33.2 of the PDA, and\n\nmeanwhile directed status-quo to be maintained by the parties so that\n\npeaceful crushing operations of the sugar factory should not be\n\nobstructed by any of the parties. The Sugar Commissioner also observed\n\nthat such order should not be construed so as to give any special right to\n\neither of the parties to the contract, to obstruct any rights of other party\n\ngiven under the contract. It is hence the respondent's contention that in\n\nlight of the order of the Sugar Commissioner, the status quo be directed\n\nto be maintained till the reference of the disputes before an arbitral\n\ntribunal, needs to be continued. It is also contended that the petitioner\n\nhas not invoked arbitration against the respondent till date, hence it\n\nought not to have initiated the present proceedings under\nSection 9\n.\n\n46. The respondent has contended that, it was also constrained to file\n\nproceedings against the petitioner before the Debt Recovery Tribunal at\n\nAurangabad under\nSection 17\nof the SARFAESI Act. This, on the basis\n\nthat the respondent had learnt that the petitioner had received financial\n\nassistance from Central Bank of India and Corporation Bank in July\n\n2012 for the purposes of setting up of the power plant under the PDA\n\nand as there was a default such banks had a charge on the assets of the\n\npetitioner including on the plant and machinery. Also that by way of\nPVR 34 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nsecurity, the petitioner had hypothecated all fixed assets, including\n\nfurniture, fixtures, equipment, motor vehicles etc. (present and future)\n\nat the Co-gen plant's premises and created a charge on the uncalled\n\nshare capital, book debts etc, and had mortgaged the immovable\n\nproperty in favour of the banks. It is contended that such application\n\nwas required to be made before the DRT at Aurangabad seeking relief\n\nagainst the lenders, the petitioner and the MSEDCL. It is stated that in\n\nsuch proceedings, the following order came to be passed by the DRT on\n\n29 December, 2021:-\n\n\" ORDER\n\nIn view of the above, I pass the following order through\nVideo Conference:\n\nA.

Thereafter, despite earlier repeated affidavits of different\n\ndescriptions being filed again an additional affidavit dated 21 February,\n\n2022 titled as \"Additional Affidavit on behalf of the respondent to place\n\non record events and documents post the hearing dated 15 February,\n\n2022 was sought to be filed by the respondent for the limited purpose of\n\nplacing on record the events and documents stated to be relevant for the\n\nmatter on the basis of what had transpired after hearing of the matter\n\non 15 February, 2022. The gist of the affidavit is that the petitioner's\n\naccounts are marked as Non Performing Assets by its creditors namely\n\nCentral Bank of India and Union Bank of India being the lender banks\n\nsince December 2017. It is stated that the lender banks had filed\n\nOriginal Application under section 19 of the Recovery of Debts and\n\nBankruptcy Act, 1993 before the DRT, New Delhi against the petitioner\n\nin which the respondent was also arrayed as a party along with MSEDCL\nPVR 36 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nand Gammon Infrastructure Private Limited.

It is stated\n\nthat the said original application was heard by the DRT on 14 February,\n\n2022 and thereafter on 15 February, 2022.

The said order reads thus:-\n\nDebts Recovery Tribunal-II, Delhi\n\nO.A.

The SPV was created for this\ngeneration plant to feed the sugar factories of Defendant no. 2 in the\nvicinity and the property on which plant is located also belongs to them.\n\nThe account is NPA since 2018 but nothing is paid.

They further\nsubmit that the plant cannot be closed as lively hood of more than one\nlakh family is dependent upon it besides various commitments of\nDefendant no 3.

The respondent has filed an additional affidavit dated 26\n\nFebruary, 2022 titled as \"Additional Affidavit on behalf of the\n\nRespondent pursuant to order dated 25 February, 2022\" by which the\n\nrespondent places certain additional affidavit on record in regard to the\n\ncredit facilities advanced to the petitioner by the lender banks, being\n\nCentral Bank of India and Union Bank of India. The respondent has\n\nstated about the nature of mortgage created by the petitioner as also has\n\ncommented on the Deed of Hypothecation. Referring to the recall notice\n\nissued to the petitioner by the lender banks dated 27 September 2021\n\nand 15 December, 2021, it is contended that the petitioner has no right,\n\ntitle or interest in the co-gen plant. It is contended that there is\n\nsuppression of all these materials, which would disentitle the petitioner\n\nfrom claiming reliefs in the present proceedings.\n\nRespondent's Affidavit-in-Reply to the Interim Application.\n\n50. To the interim application as filed on behalf of the petitioner, a\n\nreply affidavit dated 15th February, 2022 has been filed on behalf of the\n\nrespondent. The contention in the reply affidavit is not different than\n\nwhat has been set out in the reply affidavit as filed by the respondent in\n\nthe\nSection 9\npetition. However, some of the aspects, as seen from such\n\naffidavit, which need to be referred, is the respondents contention that\n\nthe respondent was constrained, to step in, and manage the Co-gen\nPVR 40 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nplant during the crushing season 2020-21, since, according to the\n\nrespondent, the petitioner had abandoned its obligations under the PDA.\n\nIt is contended by the respondent that as per the provisions of the PDA,\n\nthe petitioner was to effect transfer of assets, that is Co-gen plant to the\n\nrespondent after 25 years from the date of commencement of the\n\noperation of the plant, in a normal working condition and without\n\nencumbrances, and if the plant was not maintained and run for full 330\n\ndays, it would have deteriorated in value and found render the PDA\n\nfrustrated. It is stated that as the petitioner failed to maintain the Co-\n\ngen plant regularly, the respondent exercised its rights to protect and\n\npreserve the Co-gen plant, hence, it had to step in and incur all expenses\n\nincluding keeping the Co-gen plant in a working condition as per the\n\nprovisions of the PDA and all other applicable laws. The respondent has\n\nalso disputed that the Co-gen plant was required to run and managed by\n\nhighly technical trained engineers and personnel. The petitioner's case\n\nthat it has spent approximately Rs.274 crores for setting up the Co-gen\n\nplant has been denied by the respondent. It is contended that the co-\n\ngen plant of such standard developed between 2010 and 2015 should\n\ncost Rs.125 crores or Rs.4 crores per MW. Hence, the petitioner's\n\ncontention of an investment of Rs.274 crores has been denied by the\n\nrespondent. The respondent has also stated that they have an internal\n\ncaptive plant which is capable of generating 40 MT of steam per hour\n\nand maximum 1.5 MW of electricity. It is stated that the internal captive\nPVR 41 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nplant is incapable of generating of steam required by the respondent due\n\nto its limited capacity and such high quantity of steam can only be\n\nsourced by the power plant as set up by the petitioner in conducting the\n\noperations of the sugar factory and thus, the respondent is completely\n\ndependent on the Co-gen plant. Respondent has accordingly denied the\n\ncontention as raised by the petitioner that the internal captive plant of\n\nthe respondent was sufficient to run the respondent's operation. It is\n\ncontended that if the contentions as urged on behalf of the petitioner if\n\naccepted and the reliefs granted, the Co-gen plant would automatically\n\ncease to operate as the petitioner does not have financial capacity to run\n\nthe co-gen plant and that would lead to a shut down of the respondent's\n\nsugar factory.\n\nPetitioner's Rejoinder to the Interim Application.\n\n51. A rejoinder affidavit has been filed on behalf of the petitioner to\n\nthe said reply affidavit filed by the respondent to the interim application,\n\nwhereby the petitioner has contended that it is the owner of the Co-gen\n\nplant and is entitled to operate the said plant until the asset transfer\n\ndate 30th June, 2014 being 25 years from the start of the commercial\n\noperations. It is stated that the petitioner is ready and willing and\n\nfinancially capable of running and operating the said co-gen plant\n\nsubject to the respondent supplying minimum quantity of bagasse fuel\n\nas per the terms of the PDA and the additional bagasse fuel as per the\n\nAddendum Agreement dated 14 October 2020. The petitioner has stated\nPVR 42 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthat it is not only financially sound but technically sound to manage and\n\noperate its co-gen plant. While saying so, the petitioner states that it has\n\nspent more than Rs.274 crores for setting up the Co-gen plant and over\n\nthe years had deputed / employed highly trained engineers and\n\npersonnel for running, operation and maintenance of the said Co-gen\n\nplant. Hence, there was no reason for the petitioner to abandon and/or\n\nnot run the said plant till the assets transfer dated 6 November 2040. It\n\nis also stated that by the present proceedings, the petitioner does not\n\nseek to disrupt or stop the continuous operation of the Co-gen plant but\n\nrather seeks to ensure that the Co-gen plant is not run by the respondent\n\nwho is not only technically unfit and sound to do so, but also is not\n\nlegally entitled to be in possession of the plant. The petitioner has\n\nstated that the forceful take over of the petitioner's co-gen plant by the\n\nrespondent is completely illegal and infringes the petitioner's right to\n\nfree enjoyment of its property which includes inter alia the right to\n\nmaintain, run, operate and otherwise deal with the plant and machinery\n\nof the petitioner's Co-gen plant. It is stated that during the crushing\n\nseason of 2018-19, the Co-gen plant was operated in terms of the second\n\nsupplementary agreement dated 30 October 2018 which was entered\n\nbetween the parties for optimal operation of the power plant and under\n\nwhich the respondent could operate the plant for a limited period from\n\n1 November 2018 till 31 October 2019 which was operated by the\n\nrespondent under the monitoring and supervision of the petitioner and\nPVR 43 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nutilizing the petitioner's technically trained human resources. The\n\npetitioner has also contended that the respondent has sought to oust the\n\npetitioner from its own co-gen plant through threat and intimidation\n\ndue to which the petitioner is unable to monitor and supervise the\n\nfunctioning of the co-gen plant.\n\nPetitioner's Sur-Sur-Rejoinder.\n\n52. There is a rejoinder affidavit dated 26 February, 2022 which has\n\nbeen filed by the respondent. There is an affidavit in reply filed by the\n\npetitioner to the said additional affidavit dated 26 February 2022 filed\n\nby the respondent. The petitioner in paragraph 6 of the said affidavit\n\nhas denied the case of the respondent that the petitioner has transferred\n\nor assigned all properties under the land lease deed and/or the PDA\n\n(including co-gen plant) to the lender banks as alleged by the\n\nrespondent. It is stated that a plain reading of the said indentures of\n\nmortgage dated 27 July 2012 and 19 May 2015 would show that there\n\nis no assignment whatsoever of the properties by the petitioner.\n\n(III) Submissions\n\nSubmissions on Behalf of the Petitioner\n\n53. Mr. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has\n\nmade the following extensive submissions referring to the pleadings and\n\nthe documents as placed on record :-\n\nPVR 44 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n(i) The petitioner under the PDA, has exclusive right to possess\n\nand operate the co-gen plant which is clear from several clauses of\n\nthe PDA. It is on account of breaches of the respondent in supply\n\nof bagasse and the bio-gas, that there were difficulties on the part\n\nof the petitioner in achieving targets set out under the agreements.\n\nThe respondent is aware that the petitioner has spent about\n\nRs.274 crores for setting up and operating the Co-gen plant.\n\nHowever, the respondent is falsely stating that the petitioner's\n\ninvestment is about Rs.125 crores and that too, on some surmises\n\nof the market valuation of the relevant period. Any investment in\n\na project of such magnitude is not a small investment. Under no\n\nprovision of the PDA would the respondent be entitled to remain\n\nin possession of the Co-gen plant and oust the petitioner from the\n\nrunning and operation of the plant. It is submitted that it is clear\n\nfrom the respondent's own letter dated 4 September 2021 that the\n\npetitioner was operating and maintaining the plant as on 4\n\nSeptember 2021, as the respondent had called upon the petitioner\n\nto take all steps necessary to ensure that the Co-gen plant is fully\n\nready and operational, well in advance before the commencement\n\nof the crushing season 2021-22. It is his contention that the\n\ncontents of paragraph 14 of such letter clearly demonstrates that\n\nthe petitioner was operating the plant before the respondent\nPVR 45 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nattempted to oust the petitioner from the premises of the Co-gen\n\nplant.\n\n(ii) It is submitted that the respondent has sought to takeover\n\nthe petitioner's Co-gen plant by preventing the petitioner from\n\nentering the Co-gen plant since about 23 October, 2021. The\n\npetitioner hence called upon the respondent to vacate the Co-gen\n\nplant by its letter dated 11 November, 2021, clearly setting out\n\nthat the persons/employees/representatives have trespassed into\n\nthe petitioner's Co-gen plant and started commencing the\n\noperations of the Co-gen plant without the permission of the\n\npetitioner. It is submitted that it was pointed out to the respondent\n\nthat such actions were illegal, bad in law and manifestly malafide\n\nespecially when the present petition was filed and pending before\n\nthis Court. The petitioner also called upon the respondent to\n\nforthwith stop the operations of the Co-gen plant and to\n\nimmediately vacate the said premises. It is submitted that the\n\nrespondent by its letter dated 12 November, 2021 replied to the\n\nsaid letter of the petitioner purporting to justify the respondent\n\nremaining on the co-gen plant inter alia stating that about 50,000\n\nsmall and marginalized farmers from Ahmednagar district, were\n\ndependent for their livelihood on the respondent-sugar factory and\n\nthat the crushing season of sugarcane had already commenced on\n\n15 October, 2021 in the State, for all the sugar factories, including\nPVR 46 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthe respondent-sugar factory, which according to the petitioner\n\nwas an untenable plea.\n\n(iii) It is submitted that the respondent's plea that the petitioner\n\nwas in financial trouble and was facing legal proceedings as also\n\nthe petitioner' account was marked as 'NPA' by the lenders was\n\nmisconceived, if tested on the terms and conditions of the PDA in\n\nthe context of the relief being sought by the petitioner. It is\n\nsubmitted that, in fact, there is no denial by the respondent to the\n\npetitioner's statements as contained in the letter dated 11\n\nNovember, 2021 that the persons, employees, representatives of\n\nthe respondent have trespassed into petitioner's Co-gen plant, and\n\nhave commenced the operations of the co-gen plant without\n\npermission and the consent of the petitioner. It is submitted that\n\nthere is no clear denial whatsoever as to how the respondent was\n\nlegally entitled to run the co-gen plant.\n\n(iv) It is submitted that it was clear from the record that the Co-\n\ngen plant was taken over after the present petition was filed. It is\n\nsubmitted that the respondent is conducting itself, as if there was\n\nno breach whatsoever on its part when, contractually there was a\n\nmanifest breach on the part of the respondent in not supplying the\n\nbio-gas and the bagasse to the petitioner, which was clearly\nPVR 47 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nadmitted by the respondent in paragraph no.9(g) of its letter.\n\ndated 04 September, 2021 in the following terms:-\n\n\"The Karkhana cannot be expected to supply bagasse to PREL and\nat the same time operate its captive plant by using bagasse as a\nfuel. The minimum supply of bagasse can be made to PREL, as\nlong as PREL provides uninterrupted and continuous supply of\nelectricity and steam (Clause 8.11) of the PDA). In view of what\nis mentioned hereinabove, there is no actionable shortfall in\nsupply of bagasse by the Karkhana and no claim can be made by\nPREL against the Karkhana.\"\n\n(v) It is thus submitted that infact the bagasse and bio-gas was\n\ndiverted by the respondent to the captive plant of the respondent.\n\nThus, the case of the respondent is a false case that the respondent\n\nis wholly dependent on the co-gen plant for its operations. It is\n\nsubmitted that considering the clear provisions of the PDA, the\n\nrespondent had no contractual authority whatsoever or any other\n\nauthority de hors the contract which can be recognized in law,\n\nexcept force and intimidation to take over the operation of the co-\n\ngen plant from the petitioner. It is thus submitted that the actions\n\nof the respondent are extremely serious inasmuch as by force and\n\nintimidation, the respondent cannot take over the co-gen plant\n\nwithout any authority in law and deprive the petitioner of its\n\nproperty. It is submitted that it is clear from the correspondence\n\nthat at the most, any claim of the respondent, if at all, on the short\n\nsupply of electricity and steam can be a monetary claim, and in no\n\nmanner the respondent's conduct can be justified for any reason to\n\ntake over the co-gen plant and conduct the same.\n\nPVR 48 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n(vi) It is submitted that even under clauses 8 and 9 of the\n\nsecond supplementary agreement, the respondent was permitted\n\nto undertake operations of the plant strictly in terms of the said\n\nagreement and for a limited period commencing from 01\n\nNovember, 2018 to 31 October, 2019. It is submitted that clause\n\n12.4 of the second supplementary agreement clearly provides that\n\nin the event the modified operational agreement term was not\n\nextended, then the respondent categorically agreed to hand over\n\nthe plant after completion of annual maintenance, in good\n\nworking condition to the petitioner, at least 15 calendar days prior\n\nto the start of immediately succeeding crushing season. Hence, in\n\nlight of the second supplement agreement, the parties had clearly\n\nagreed that the respondent was not to have any right to operate\n\nand maintain the plant upon the expiry of MOA term and the\n\nmodified arrangement including the provisions thereof, shall\n\nautomatically stand terminated and shall fall away.\n\n(vii) It is submitted that the case of the respondent of the\n\naccounts of the petitioner becoming NPA and/or the parent\n\ncompany of the petitioners becoming a NPA is totally untenable in\n\nso far as the contractual relations between the parties are\n\nconcerned, and the reliefs as prayed for in the present\n\nproceedings. In this context, it is submitted that the respondent\n\nhas falsely contended that the respondent has recently come to\nPVR 49 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nknow that the petitioner had mortgaged its assets to the lenders,\n\nincluding the land. According to the petitioner, such contention of\n\nthe respondent is in the teeth of clause 8 of the land lease deed\n\ndated 12 July, 2010 which permitted the petitioner to create \"any\n\nmortgage or charge\" over the leased land in favour of the lenders\n\nor any trustees acting on their behalf or assign the lease deed in\n\nfavour of the lenders by way of security for the implementation of\n\nthe co-generation facilities and allied facilities. In the event a\n\ncharge or mortgage was to be created or the lease deed was to be\n\nassigned to any person other than the lenders, the lessee\n\n(petitioner) was to do so only with a prior consent of the lessor\n\n(respondent no.1). Therefore, the respondent's contention of\n\nsuppression of information according to the petitioner is\n\ncompletely untenable and contrary to the record.\n\n(viii) It is next submitted that the respondent was clearly aware\n\nabout the petitioner's borrowings, which is clear from the\n\nproceedings as filed by the respondent itself before the DRT at\n\nAurangabad being Securitization Application No. 290 of 2021 filed\n\non 23 December, 2021, wherein respondent no.1 in paragraph 7\n\nhad stated that the petitioner had obtained credit facilities to the\n\nextent of about 191.67 Crores for the purpose of financing\n\nconstruction development and implementation of the co-gen plant\n\nand which was secured by the hypothecation of all fixed assets\nPVR 50 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nincluding plant and machinery, furniture, fixtures, equipment,\n\nmotor vehicles, etc. It is thus submitted that in the teeth of what\n\nwas pointed out by the respondent in its own application, the\n\nrespondent could not have taken a plea of being unaware about\n\nthe petitioner's borrowings and set up a farcical defence of\n\nfinancial difficulties as faced by the petitioner in the present\n\nproceedings. It is submitted that in fact, as to what the\n\nrespondent has pleaded in regard to the ownership of the plant\n\nbefore the DRT is shocking. In this regard, the following paragraph\n\nof the grounds/reasons in the securitization application as filed by\n\nthe respondent before the DRT at Aurangabad have been\n\nreferred :-\n\n\"(xxix) - It is submitted that ultimately the Co-gen plant has to\nbe transferred to the Applicant as per the terms of the PDA\nwithout any charge or encumbrance even though the same may\nbe hypothecated with the Respondent No.1 (Central Bank of\nIndia) and Respondent No.2 (Union Bank of India) by\nRespondent No.3 (petitioner). It is repeated that the Applicant\nis the absolute owner of the Property and has the right to use\nthe same. Furthermore, the said Co-gen plant is fundamental to\nthe existence and functioning of the Applicant's sugar factory,\nwhich is being primarily run by the Applicant, jointly with\nRespondent No.3. As mentioned earlier, the sugar factory of the\nApplicant is a source of livelihood for more than 2 lakh\nstakeholders, whose life will be directly impacted if it ceases to\noperate. Therefore, even in equity, the Applicant has a right to\ncontinue to use the Property under all circumstances since the\nlivelihood of lakhs of people is dependent on it. Moreover, the\ncessation of the same may also create a law and order issue, as\nwitnessed in November 2021, when the Respondent No.3 failed\nto run the Co-gen Plant in time. Accordingly, enforcement\nrights to be exercised by the Respondent No.1 and 2 in respect\nof the use of the Property should be allowed, if at all, only with\nthe direction that the Co-ten plant be kept in a running\ncondition and in compliance of the terms and conditions of the\nPDA, neither less nor more. \"\n\nPVR 51 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nIt is submitted that it is on the above averments, it is infact the\n\nrespondent which has obtained ex-parte orders from the the DRT,\n\nAurangabad on 29 December, 2021.\n\n(ix) It is next submitted that neither of the orders passed by the\n\nDRT at Aurangabad on the securitization application filed by the\n\nrespondent, nor on the proceedings filed by the Central Bank of\n\nIndia before the DRT at Delhi can influence much less prevent this\n\nCourt to consider the present proceedings and pass appropriate\n\norders, as the orders passed by the DRT recognize the contractual\n\nposition between the parties under the PDA and the allied\n\nagreements and such orders would not disturb the contractual\n\nrights of the parties under the PDA. It is submitted that even if\n\nthe assets of the petitioner are mortgaged, the petitioner cannot\n\nbe prevented from exercising its rights under the PDA.\n\n(x) In so far as the respondent's contention that the petitioner\n\nand the respondent are in joint possession of the co-gen plant, it is\n\nsubmitted that it is false for the respondent to so contend, as such\n\na contention of the respondent is contrary to the record and from\n\nwhat can be revealed from several documents. It is submitted\n\nthat the respondent's contention of joint possession is a totally\n\nfalse defence which has been set up in the reply affidavit without\n\nany foundation.\n\nPVR 52 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n(xi) In so far as the respondent's contention on the\nsection 9\n\nproceedings being not maintainable is concerned, it is submitted\n\nthat the petitioner was entitled to approach this Court and invoke\n\nthe jurisdiction under\nSection 9\nof the Act in terms of what is\n\nprovided in\nSection 9\nof the Act, namely, that a party may, before\n\nthe arbitral proceedings, approach the Court in the circumstances\n\nas they exist in the present proceedings. It is submitted that as\n\nthe present application is filed before the commencement of the\n\narbitral proceedings, the petitioner is entitled to seek the reliefs of\n\nthe nature as prayed for. It is submitted that the petition would\n\nbe maintainable also considering the provisions of sub-sections\n\n(2) and (3) of\nSection 9\nof the Act. It is submitted that even\n\nconsidering that this petition is filed on 12 th October, 2021 there\n\nis no delay whatsoever on the part of the petitioner, when the\n\npetitioner has an intention to commence the arbitration. The\n\nsituation in hand would not preclude the petitioner from seeking\n\nreliefs as contended under sub-section (2) of\nsection 9\nof the Act.\n\n(xii) In the above context, it is submitted that by an order dated\n\n11 November, 2021, the Sugar Commissioner had referred the\n\nparties to mediation and ultimately, the Sugar Commissioner by\n\nhis order dated 27 December, 2021 ordered that the parties take\n\nrecourse to arbitral proceedings. Thus the contention that the\nPVR 53 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nsection 9\napplication is not maintainable, is thoroughly\n\nmisconceived. It is submitted that the petitioner has already\n\nclarified that the petitioner has intended to proceed in arbitration\n\nand that the petitioners are very much inclined to appoint an\n\narbitral tribunal. However, this would not mean that the\n\npetitioner is not entitled to the reliefs as prayed when there is a\n\nbrazen breach of his contractual rights by the respondent. It is\n\nalso submitted that there is not an iota of material suggesting that\n\nthere is a delay on the part of the petitioner in referring the\n\ndisputes to arbitration. Such is not the objection taken in any of\n\nthe affidavits filed on behalf of the respondent.\n\n(xiii) It is submitted that the petitioner's case before the Sugar\n\nCommissioner on the several illegalities of the respondent to\n\npressurize the petitioner not to run the co-gen plant, was clear\n\nfrom the contents of the petitioner's letter dated 08 December,\n\n2021, addressed to the Sugar Commissioner, Maharashtra State,\n\nin which the petitioner pointed out that the respondent having\n\npolitical clout has used its influence on the MSEDCL. Further, the\n\nrespondent had forcefully started operating the co-gen plant for\n\nthe present crushing season (2021-22), and that too, completely\n\ncontrary to the terms of the contract between the parties and has\n\nengaged a third party M/s. Energy, for operating and running the\n\nco-gen plant. It is thus submitted that the reliefs as prayed for by\nPVR 54 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthe petitioner be granted.\nIn support of the above contentions on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner, reliance is placed on the decisions of the\n\nlearned Single Judge of this Court in\nBaker Hughes Singapore Pte\n\nv. Shiv-Vani Oil and Gas Exploration Services Ltd.1\n\nSubmissions\non behalf of the Respondents\n\n54. Mr. Khambata, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nrespondent has made the following submissions:\n\n(i) At the outset, it is submitted that the present\n\nproceedings under\nSection 9\nof the Act are not maintainable\n\ninasmuch as the respondent is not satisfied that the petitioner is\n\nready and willing to refer the disputes to arbitration and/or the\n\npetitioner continues to have such willingness. It is his submission\n\nthat it has already been five months since the dispute commenced\n\nbetween the parties, however, no inclination has been shown by\n\nthe petitioner to refer the disputes to arbitration. At the threshold,\n\nthe petitioner has not satisfied the basic requirement to seek relief\n\nunder\nSection 9\nof the Act, which the petitioner ought to satisfy to\n\nmaintain the prayers for interim measures. It is hence submitted\n\nthat a\nSection 17\napplication before the arbitral tribunal is the\n\nappropriate remedy for the petitioner.\nIn support of his\n\nsubmissions, reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme\n\n1 (2015) 1 Bom CR 377\nPVR 55 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nCourt in \"\nFirm Ashok Traders and Anr. Vs. Gurmukh Das Saluja &\n\nOrs.\n\"2, \"\nArcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Ltd. Vs. Essar Bulk\n\nTerminal Ltd.\n\"3, and the decision of the Division Bench of Gujarat\n\nHigh Court in \"\nEssar Bulk Terminal Ltd. Vs. Arcelor Mittal Nippon\n\nSteel India Ltd.\n\"4\n\n(ii) In so far as the petitioner's case that the respondent\n\nillegally took over the possession of the co-gen power plant is\n\nconcerned, it is submitted that the parties are in joint possession of\n\nthe plant, however, in view of mishandling of the plant by the\n\npetitioner, today the respondent is controlling the plant as pointed\n\nout by the respondent in paragraphs 52 to 54 of its reply. Also\n\nthat the petitioner itself has stated in paragraph (9) (XLII) of the\n\nrejoinder affidavit that the turbine has broken down due to\n\nmishandling of the turbine, hence, the respondent was obligated\n\nto get the turbine repaired. This, according to the respondent,\n\nshows that the petitioner's admission on the handling of the plant\n\nby the respondent.\n\n(iii) It is next submitted that the respondent has denied the\n\nexecution of the addendum agreement dated 14 October 2020 and\n\nhence, the petitioner is precluded from placing reliance on the\n\nsame. The intention of the petitioner in seeking the relief that the\n\nrespondent be prohibited from running the co-gen plant, is in fact,\n\n2 (2004)3 SCC 155\n3 2021 SCC OnLine SC 718\n4 R/First Appeal No.3040 of 2021, Dt. 03/02/2022\nPVR 56 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nto stop the running of the sugar factory which would cause serious\n\nprejudice to the permanent employees and others like farmers,\n\nwho are dependent on the sugar factory. The respondent is\n\nmanaging the co-gen plant as also the salaries are being paid by\n\nthe respondent, which shows that the petitioner was not interested\n\nin conducting the co-gen plant.\n\n(iv) The respondent is successfully running the co-gen plant,\n\nwhich the petitioner is not in a position to run due to severe\n\nfinancial constraints as the petitioner is indebted to the banks for\n\nthe borrowings as made by it for setting up the co-gen plant,\n\nwhich itself indicates that it is not possible for the petitioner to\n\nmanage and run the co-gen plant. There is no urgency as made\n\nout by the petitioner for any reliefs in the present petition which\n\ncan be clearly seen from the averments as made in paragraphs 23\n\nand 29 of the petition.\n\n(v) The bonafides of the petitioner are extremely doubtful\n\nconsidering the averments as made in paragraph 29 of the petition\n\ninasmuch as its the petitioner's own case that the plant is taken\n\nover by the respondent after the petition was filed on 12 October\n\n2021. It is submitted that the respondent would not mind the\n\nrepresentatives of the petitioner visiting and helping the\n\nmanagement of the plant. However, they cannot seek reliefs as\n\nprayed in the petition.\n\nPVR 57 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n(vi) It is submitted that the petitioner is not correct in its\n\ncontention that there was mutual arrangement between the\n\nparties, under which, the respondent was permitted to use and\n\noperate the plant. This plea of the petitioner is belied by the\n\nrecord and the correspondence exchanged between the parties.\n\n(vii) It cannot be said that the respondent has no right\n\nwhatsoever to run the Co-gen plant, it is for the reason that the\n\nland belongs to the respondent and it has been leased in its favour\n\nfor the purpose of installation of the plant under a valid lease\n\ndeed.\n\n(viii) The case of the petitioner of any breach of the PDA by\n\nthe respondent and more particularly, in respect of supply of\n\nbagasse and bio gas cannot be accepted, in view of the clear\n\nclauses of the PDA being Clause (6) and (7). The nature of the\n\ndispute is such that it is appropriate that the petitioner seeks relief\n\nbefore the arbitral tribunal, as different complexities under the\n\ncontract can be gone into, only before the arbitral. In fact, this is a\n\ncase where the petitioner has dealt with the land in question\n\nwithout prior consent of the respondent and when the mortgage in\n\nrespect of the land was created in favour of the financial\n\ninstitution.\n\n(ix) It is submitted that by praying for such interim reliefs,\n\nthe petitioner is in fact seeking specific performance of the\nPVR 58 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nagreement. It is submitted that no interlocutory relief can be\n\ngranted when the petitioner itself has breached the essential terms\n\nof the contract disentitling itself for reliefs under\nsection 9\nas per\n\nthe provisions of\nSection 16(b)\nand (c) of the\nSpecific Relief Act\n.\n\n(x) In any event, considering the precarious financial\n\ncondition of the petitioner and that the petitioner was not capable\n\nto conduct the plant, there is no continuous readiness and\n\nwillingness to perform the contract on the part of the petitioner.\n\nSubstantial emphasis is laid on the proceedings as initiated by the\n\nconsortium of the bank before the DRT at Delhi as also an\n\napplication filed under the Securitization Act by the respondent\n\nbefore the DRT at Aurangabad and the orders passed thereunder,\n\nto contend that these proceedings would also clearly show that the\n\nrespondent cannot maintain the prayers as made in the present\n\nproceedings, not only on merits but also considering the legal\n\nposition.\n\n(xi) In any event, the injunction which is prayed for is in the\n\nnature of an interim mandatory injunction which ought not to be\n\ngranted in the\nSection 9\nproceedings as none of the essential\n\nrequirements as per the settled principles of law\nlaid down by\nthe\n\nSupreme Court, are present for this Court to grant such interim\n\nmandatory measures.\nTo support this submission, reliance is\nPVR 59 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nplaced on the decision of the Supreme Court in \"\nDorab Cawasji\n\nWarden Vs. Coomi Sorab Warden & Ors.\n\"5\n\n(xii) Lastly it is submitted that even the provisions of\nSection\n\n41(1)(ha)\nof the Specific Relief Act would bar the petitioner to\n\nseek reliefs as prayed for in respect of an infrastructure project.\n\n(IV) Intervention Applications\n\n55. There are three intervention applications, the details of which are\n\nset out hereunder:-\n\n(I) Interim Application (L) No. 4443 of 2022\n\nThis interim application is filed by one Alenka Dhrub Lanka and 15\n\nothers who are stated to be the employees of the petitioner. It is\n\ncontended that the reliefs as prayed in the arbitration petition have a\n\ndirect bearing on the the operation of the co-gen plant and their\n\nemployment, hence an impleadment is prayed by these applicants. The\n\nprincipal contention of these applicants is that the petitioner has failed\n\nto pay the salaries of the applicants for several months. The applicants,\n\ntherefore, have lodged complaints before the Labour Court, Ahmednagar\n\nfor non-payment of the salaries. They have continued to attend work\n\nwith the hope that the petitioner would pay their unpaid salary. They\n\ncontend that their livelihood depends on the operation of the co-gen\n\nplant and they do not want the co-gen plant to be shut down in any\n5 (1990)2 SCC 117\nPVR 60 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nmanner. They apprehend that the petitioner, in view of the disputes\n\nwith the respondent, would close down the facilities without any notice\n\nto these applicants. The applicant has made a categorical statement that\n\nthe petitioner had paid the salary of the applicant in the month of\n\nOctober and November, 2021, however, the past salaries for February,\n\n2021 to September, 2021 are yet to be paid. It is their contention that\n\nthe Sugar Commissioner has rightly passed the order dated 27\n\nDecember 2021 and directed to maintain \"status quo\" so that the\n\ncrushing operation continues unhindered. It is contended that the\n\napplicants have severely suffered as they have not been paid by the\n\npetitioner. The affidavit in support of this application has been affirmed\n\non 12 February 2022.\n\n(II) There is a reply affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioner denying\n\nthat the petitioner has been unable to pay the salaries of the applicants.\n\nIt is contended that these applicants have no locus to intervene in the\n\npresent proceedings as the applicants have nothing to do with the\n\narbitral dispute between the petitioner and the respondent. It is denied\n\nthat the petitioner has deliberately removed staff and that the petitioner\n\nwas unable to pay the salaries. It is contended by the respondent that\n\nthe disputes in that regard is sub judice before the Labour Court at\n\nAhmednagar. It is contended that the applicants are not correct in their\n\ncontention that the petitioner wants to close down the co-gen plant. The\n\nendeavour of the applicants is that the petitioner be prevented from\nPVR 61 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nconducting the co-gen plant, when they know that respondent is unfit\n\nand technically not sound to do so. The case of the petitioner is that it\n\nhas invested Rs.274 crores to install and operate the co-gen plant and\n\nhence, it is obvious that the petitioner wants to run the co-gen plant and\n\ngenerate revenue.\n\nInterim Application (L) NO. 4426 of 2022\n\n(I) This interim application is filed by the applicant-Pravara Oos Tod\n\nVa Vahatuk Majoor Sanstha Pvt. Ltd., praying for intervention/to be\n\nimpleaded in the present\nSection 9\nproceedings, filed by the petitioner,\n\non the ground that the interest of the applicant is likely to be affected. It\n\nis the case of the applicant that it is engaged in the process of\n\nharvesting, carting and transporting of sugarcane and engages around\n\n15,000 labourers and other contractors who harvest and transport\n\nsugarcane from the farmers to the respondent sugar factory. It is\n\ncontended that the functioning of the respondent-sugar factory is\n\nnecessary for the sustenance of the harvesting labourers and their\n\nfamilies. It is for this purpose, in the proceedings filed before the Sugar\n\nCommissioner, the Sugar Commissioner has passed an order dated 17\n\nNovember 2021 directing \"status quo\" to be maintained regarding the\n\nrespondent's sugar factory. The apprehension of the applicant is that the\n\npetitioner may shut down the respondent - sugar mill thereby affecting\n\nthe applicants. However, as the Sugar Commissioner thereafter passed\nPVR 62 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nan order on 27 December 2021 noting that the dispute cannot be\n\nresolved amicably, he had granted liberty to the petitioner and the\n\nrespondent to resolve the disputes by arbitration. It is the applicants'\n\ncontention that it is before the Sugar Commissioner that the members of\n\nthe applicant learnt about the pendency of the present petition and the\n\nreliefs as prayed for in the proceedings. It is contended that the present\n\nSection 9\nproceedings filed by the petitioner are an abuse of the process\n\nof law, whereby the petitioner is seeking to unlawfully maximise its\n\ncommercial gains at the expense of the interest of the applicant, farmers,\n\nharvesting labour and other workers. It is contended that in case the co-\n\ngen plant is allowed to be closed, the operations of the respondent\n\nfactory will cease, and the harvesting labour of the applicant would\n\nconsequently have no income and hence, they become necessary parties\n\nto the present proceedings.\n\n(II) A reply affidavit has been filed on behalf of the petitioner to\n\ncontend that the applicant in no manner is likely to be affected either\n\ndirectly or indirectly by any order of interim measures passed on this\n\npetition. It is contended that the applicant is not a party to the\n\narbitration agreement between the petitioner and the respondent,\n\nhence, this intervention application is not maintainable. It is next\n\ncontended that the interim application is lacking in bonafides as it has\n\nbeen filed at the behest of the respondent, solely to prevent the urgent\n\nand expeditious hearing of the petition, and the same is abuse of the\nPVR 63 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nprocess of the Court and ought to be dismissed outright as such. It is\n\nalso contended by the petitioner that the apprehension of the applicant\n\nthat the petitioner would close down the co-gen plant, is totally\n\nmisconceived and against the case of the petitioner in the interim\n\napplication. It is further reiterated that the petitioner has invested an\n\namount of Rs.274 crores in setting up the plant and hence, there is no\n\nquestion of the applicant being under any apprehension that the\n\npetitioner wants to shut down the plant. The petitioner has denied that\n\nthe applicant has spent an amount of Rs.30 crores as alleged, in\n\nengaging harvesting labour, machines etc. The petitioner has also\n\ncontended that the applicant lacks bonafides in moving this interim\n\napplication and can have no interest in the subject matter of the instant\n\ndispute, mainly in regard to functioning of the co-gen plant, and hence,\n\nthe prayer for intervention is misconceived and deserves to be rejected.\n\nInterim Application (L.) NO. 4446 of 2022\n\n(I) This interim application is filed by one Sakhar Kamgar Union,\n\nShrirampur. The applicant in this application claims to be a Union\n\ncomprising of 1409 members who are currently working with the\n\nrespondent-sugar factory as labourers, workers and employees. Their\n\ncontention is not different from what has been alleged in the previous\n\ntwo interim applications, namely, that the sustenance of the members of\n\nthe applicant is dependent on the effective functioning of the\n\nrespondent-sugar factory. It is contended that the applicant had\nPVR 64 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\npreviously filed a representation with the office of the Sugar\n\nCommissioner who had passed an order dated 27 December 2021\n\ndirecting to maintain status quo, as also directed that the petitioner and\n\nrespondent to resolve the disputes in arbitration proceedings. The case\n\nof the applicant is that the petitioner is not in good financial condition\n\nas it had failed to pay the electricity dues in consequence of which, the\n\nMSEDCL has issued disconnection notice to the petitioner on 29\n\nNovember 2021. It is contended that the electricity for the respondent's\n\npremises including the staff quarters and primary school is also\n\ndependent on the electricity generated by the co-gen plant. Thus, any\n\naction of the petitioner shutting down the co-gen plant would affect the\n\napplicant. It is for such reason the applicant contends that it was\n\nrequired to move a representation dated 10 November, 2021, before the\n\nSugar Commissioner complaining that the co-gen power plant was not\n\noperational till 12 November 2021 and there was a delay in\n\ncommencement of the crushing operation of about 27 days, which\n\ncaused hardship and economic distress to the members of the applicant-\n\nunion. The other contents of the application are similar to the other two\n\ninterim applications. There is also a reply affidavit filed where the\n\npetitioner contended that the interim application is not bonafide and\n\nthat the applicant in this interim application has nothing to do with the\n\narbitral proceedings. It is contended that none of the rights of the\n\napplicant are affected by the subject matter of the proceedings between\nPVR 65 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthe petitioner and the respondent. It is also contended by the petitioner\n\nthat all apprehensions of the applicant are incorrect and false and they\n\nare denied in totality.\n\nSUBMISSIONS :-\n\n56. Dr. Saraf appearing for all the interveners has submitted that\n\neven if the applicants are third parties to the inter parte disputes\n\nbetween the petitioner and the respondent, however, the rights of the\n\napplicants would be vitally affected, if any orders adverse to the\n\nrespondent is passed in the present\nSection 9\nproceedings.\nIn support of\n\nhis contention that when the rights of the third parties are being\n\naffected, then such parties can be impleaded and infact become\n\nnecessary parties to the proceedings, reliance is placed on the decision\n\nof the learned Single Judge of this Court in\nPrabhat Steel Traders Pvt.\n\nLtd. Vs. Excel Metal Processors Pvt.Ltd.6\n\n57. Mr. Andhyarijuna responding to the interventions and the\n\nsubmissions as made by Dr. Saraf for the intervenors would submit that\n\nthe relief as prayed for in the\nSection 9\nproceedings would in fact aid\n\nthe applicants and not prejudice them. It is submitted that the legal test\n\nin regard to intervention in\nSection 9\nproceedings has not been correctly\n\nformulated by the applicants. It is his submission that, in fact, the\n\nintervenors fail on such legal test, inasmuch as\nSection 9\nper se is not\n\n6 2018 SCC OnLine Bom 2347\nPVR 66 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\navailable to the intervenors to assert their right, by stepping into the\n\nshoes of the respondent. It is his submission that it is for the\nSection 9\n\npetitioner to implead a necessary party who might affect the rights of\n\nthe\nSection 9\npetitioner in regard to the reliefs as prayed for or who may\n\nbe adversely affected. However, it is submitted that a converse situation\n\nis not, what\nSection 9\nwould provide.\nInsofar as the reliance of Dr. Saraf\n\non the decision of\nPrabhat Steel Traders Pvt. Ltd.\n(supra) is concerned,\n\nMr. Andhyarijuna's would submit that such decision is not an authority\n\nfor the propositions that intervention per se at the stage prior to any\n\norder being passed under\nsection 9\ncan be permitted more particularly\n\nconsidering the provisions of\nSection 9(1)(c)\nof the Act.\n\n58. It is next submitted by Mr. Andhyarijuna that the entire premise of\n\nthe applicants to raise contentions that the petitioner is not in a good\n\nfinancial condition is wholly untenable, as there is no denial of the fact\n\nthat the parent company of the applicant is a debt free company. Hence,\n\nthe entire case of the applicants that the petitioner's conducting co-gen\n\nplant will be prejudicial to the applicants interest is merely an\n\napprehension and totally untenable. Mr. Andhyarijuna has submitted\n\nthat the petitioner has invested an amount of Rs.247 crores in the co-\n\ngen plant and certainly the intention of the petitioner is to run the plant\n\nand recover its investment as also make profits.\n\nPVR 67 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nSubmissions of Mr. Andhyarijuna in rejoinder to submissions on behalf\nof respondent\n\n(i) Mr. Andhyarijuna would submit that Mr. Khambata's\n\nsubmission referring to the DRT proceedings is nothing but an\n\nattempt on the part of the respondent to deviate from the issue in\n\nquestion, namely, of the illegal takeover and running of the co-gen\n\nplant by the respondent without any authority in law. It is\n\nsubmitted that the orders passed by DRT at New Delhi as also the\n\norders passed by the DRT at Aurangabad are ex-parte to the\n\npetitioner. It is submitted that whatever was observed by DRT-\n\nNew Delhi in its order dated 15 February 2022 is on the basis of\n\nwhat the respondent (defendant no.2 therein) had pointed out\n\nbefore the DRT, which was completely a one sided affair. Hence, it\n\nwas totally misconceived for the respondent to place reliance on\n\nthe orders passed by the DRT, New Delhi. It is submitted that,\n\nsimilarly, the orders passed by the DRT-Aurangabad could not be\n\nrelied by the respondent since such orders were passed ex-parte.\n\n(ii) Insofar as the respondent's contention that the mortgage of\n\nthe land in favour of consortium of bank was illegal, it is\n\nsubmitted that it is an untenable contention, inasmuch as in the\n\nLand Lease Deed dated 12 July, 2010 in Clause 8, provided that\n\nthe lessee (petitioner) may create any mortgage or charge over the\n\nleased land in favour of the lenders and/or assign the lease deed\nPVR 68 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nin favour of lenders by way of security for the implementation of\n\nthe Co-Generation Facility and allied activities. Mr. Andhyarujina\n\nwould thus submit that no permission was required to be taken to\n\ncreate a mortgage in favour of the financial institutions. He would\n\nsubmit that also read with Clause 8 of the Land Lease Deed, under\n\nClause 4.7 of the PDA, the petitioner was entitled to borrow\n\nmoney for setting up of the co-generation facility by offering the\n\nleased land as security. Thus, the case of the respondent that it\n\nwas surprised to note that the land on which the co-generation\n\nplant was installed was leased to financial institutions is a false\n\ncase of the respondent. Mr. Andhyarijuna would submit that the\n\nLease Deed is still with the petitioner. The mortgage as created by\n\nthe petitioner of the bank is an English mortgage.\n\n(iii) Mr. Andhyarijuna referring to the provisions of\nSections 58\n\nand\nof the Transfer of Property Act read with the clauses of the\n\nLand Lease Deed as also the PDA would submit that it was\n\nuntenable for the respondent to argue that creating security of the\n\nland in favour of the financial institutions/banks is as good as\n\ntransfer of ownership. It is his submission that even the financial\n\ninstitutions are not taking up such contention and it is only a\n\ncharge on the property which is created so as to secure borrowings\n\nfrom the lenders. It is thus submitted that creation of mortgage\n\ndoes not amount to sale of the co-gen plant. Referring to the\nPVR 69 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nadditional affidavit dated 26 February, 2022 filed on behalf of the\n\nrespondent, it is submitted that the respondent at all material\n\ntimes was aware of the indenture of mortgage dated 27 July,\n\n2012 and 19 May, 2015 entered between the lender-banks and the\n\npetitioner, which is also annexed to the original application as\n\nAnnexures A-16 and A-25 respectively and thus, their case in the\n\npresent proceeding that the creation of mortgage was a\n\nsuppression to the respondent, is false and dishonest, when the\n\nrespondent has made a submission in paragraph 10 of its reply\n\nthat the petitioner is not entitled to any equitable relief as they\n\nhave suppressed that the co-gen plant was hypothecated to its\n\nlenders.\n\n(iv) In regard to the submissions as advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent on joint possession of the co-gen plant, Mr.\n\nAndhyarijuna would submit that it is false for the respondent to\n\nurge such contention, since under the second supplementary\n\nagreement, the respondent was permitted to operate the plant for\n\na limited period of time. It is submitted that there is not a single\n\ndocument as shown by the respondent which would go to show\n\nthat there was any joint possession of the co-gen plant. The\n\nCourt's attention is drawn to paragraph no. 9(xviii) of the affidavit\n\nin rejoinder filed on behalf of the petitioner wherein the petitioner\n\nhad specifically denied that the co-gen plant is in joint possession\nPVR 70 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nof the petitioner and respondent for the past couple of years, and\n\nthat, the respondent had provided spares, consumables, paid\n\nsalaries of staff of the petitioner, provided operational support by\n\ndeputing personnel from time to time and/or the respondent has\n\nspent crores of rupees for the co-gen plant's operations and\n\nrunning at the instance and requests of the petitioner. It is pointed\n\nout that the petitioner has specifically pleaded that the respondent\n\nhad withheld from this Court a vital fact that there was a mutual\n\narrangement between the petitioner and respondent, wherein, the\n\nrespondent had agreed to make certain operational payments and\n\nbear certain operational expenses on behalf of the petitioner, in\n\norder to compensate the petitioner for the losses caused to it due\n\nto the short-supply of bagasse fuel by the respondent, which was\n\nwith an understanding that the operational expenses and\n\noperational payments made by the respondent on behalf of the\n\npetitioner will eventually be set off with the amounts that were\n\ndue and payable by the respondent to the petitioner, due to the\n\nshort supply of bagasse fuel by the respondent to the petitioner. It\n\nis submitted that the possession of the co-gen plant in respect of\n\nwhich a serious grievance has been made by the petitioner in the\n\npresent proceedings have in fact happened between 12 October,\n\n2021 to 26 October, 2021, i.e., after filing of the\nSection 9\n\npetition.\n\nPVR 71 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n(v) Mr. Andhyarijuna would next submit that merely taking\n\nassistance from the respondent to manage the co-gen plant would\n\nnot amount to joint possession. It is submitted that in fact when\n\nthe petitioner requested for support, it would categorically show\n\nthat the petitioners are running co-gent plant and certainly, the co-\n\ngent plant is not in a situation of joint possession. At the most, the\n\nright to enter the co-gen plant as may be granted by the petitioner\n\nwould be a permissive entry to the respondent. Hence, the\n\npetitioner would be justified in seeking reliefs as prayed for as an\n\ninterim measure, if such rights are usurped by the respondent.\n\nEven the proceedings before the DRT Delhi, would show that the\n\ncontention of the respondent of joint possession of the co-gen\n\nplant is totally untenable inasmuch as a specific plea has been\n\ntaken by the respondent before DRT that the respondent is\n\nexclusively running the co-gen plant. As also before DRT,\n\nAurangabad, a plea has been taken by the respondent that the\n\npetitioner has abandoned the co-gen plant. It is thus submitted\n\nthat contrary to such contention on record of the said proceedings\n\na theory of joint possession is being asserted by the respondent in\n\nthe present proceedings. It is submitted that such inconsistent\n\nstand of the respondent itself proves the falsity of its contentions.\n\n(vi) Mr. Andhyarijuna would next submit that considering the\n\nclauses of PDA it completely belies the case of the respondent that\nPVR 72 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nany of such clauses would permit the respondent to take over the\n\nplant even in the event there was any failure of the petitioner to\n\ncomply with its obligations, as the consequences in that regard are\n\nprovided for under clause 25 of the PDA.\n\n(vii) Insofar as the respondent's contention that the prayer as\n\nmade in the petition is for an interim mandatory injunction, it is\n\nsubmitted that Court has powers to grant such interim orders\n\nwhen a strong prima facie case of a nature as made out in the\n\npresent petition exists, as also that the balance of convenience is in\n\nfavour of the petitioner coupled with the fact that if the prayers as\n\nmade are not granted, grave and irreparable prejudice would be\n\ncaused to the petitioner. It is also submitted that as to what is\n\nprayed for in the present proceeding is also for a temporary\n\ninjunction as seen from prayer clause (b), so as to restrain the co-\n\ngent plant from being usurped by the respondent.\n\n(V) Analysis and Conclusion\n\n59. I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and with\n\ntheir assistance I have gone through the record. At the outset, it needs\n\nto be noted that the petitioner intends to press this petition for a relief as\n\nprayed for in terms of prayer clause (b) which is noted above. Insofar as\n\nthe prayer clause (a) is concerned, Mr. Khambata on behalf of the\n\nrespondent has made a statement that the respondent has no intention\nPVR 73 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nto engage any third party to undertake operation/maintenance and\n\nmanagement of the petitioner's co-gen plant.\n\n60. On the above premise, following questions would fall for\n\nconsideration of the Court in the present proceedings :-\n\n(i) Whether the petitioner is entitled for an injunction as prayed for\n\nin prayer clause (b) of restraining the respondent from in any\n\nmanner entering the premises of the petitioner's co-generation\n\nplaint and from carrying out any work/activity for the\n\nrepairs/maintenance/operation of the petitioner's co-gen plant?\n\n(ii) Whether the respondent has any legal right under the contractual\n\nscheme as the parties stand, to interfere in the petitioner's\n\nmanaging and operating its Co-generation plant and make an\n\nattempt to lock, stock and barrel, oust the petitioner from\n\noperating and managing its own Co-generation power plant?\n\n61. To aid the discussion it would be appropriate to recapitulate some\n\nof the admitted facts. The petitioner was created as a Special Purpose\n\nVehicle (SPV) incorporated by Gammon Infrastructure Projects Ltd. to\n\nset up the co-gen plant to be used for generating power and steam inter\n\nalia to be supplied to the respondent's sugar factory. On 12 July, 2010,\n\nthe Project Development Agreement (PDA) was entered between the\n\nrespondent and the petitioner whereunder the petitioner agreed to set\nPVR 74 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nup and run a bagasse fired Co-generation (Co-gen) plant on a Build Own\n\nOperate Transfer (BOOT) basis, on land to be provided by the\n\nrespondent adjoining to the sugar factory. Bagasse and biogas which are\n\nthe bi-products in the sugar manufacturing process, were to be utilized\n\nin the Co-gen plant for the production of power and steam.\n\n62. The Co-gen plant was to function as agreed between the parties\n\nunder the PDA subject to the respondent's supplying bagasse and biogas\n\nas per the \"agreed minimum assured quantity\" to the petitioner, so as to\n\nenable the petitioner to produce electricity as per the quantity as agreed\n\nbetween the parties in Schedule-I of the PDA. Under the PDA, the\n\npetitioner was also free to sell to any third party surplus power and\n\nsteam after meeting the requirements of the Kharkhana-respondent.\n\nThe parties also agreed under the PDA, on an \"Assets Transfer Date\"\n\nwhen the assets of the Co-gen plant would be transferred in favour of\n\nthe respondent, which was to be 25 years from the operation\n\ncommencement date which was to be 30 June, 2041 (considering that\n\nthe date of commencement of the operation of the plant was 6\n\nNovember, 2015).\n\n63. In the context of the controversy which is raised in the present\n\nproceedings, some of the clauses of the PDA, the Land Lease Deed are\n\nrequired to be noted, which are as under:-\n\nRELEVANT CLAUSES UNDER THE PDA\nPVR 75 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n1.2 \"Assets Transfer Date\" or \"ATD\" shall be 30th June after\ncompletion of 25 years of operation starting from COD.

However, no such planned shutdown of co-gen\nFacility shall be scheduled during the Crushing Season.\nProvided however, the co-gen Facility can do a planned outage\nas and when the Karkhana is having a planned outage.\n\n5.0 LAND FOR THE PROJECT\n\n5.1 The Karkhana shall grant Leased Land to PREL for the purpose\nof setting up and operating Co-generation Facility.\n\n5.5 The Karkhana shall grant lease of the Leased land for the\nperiod commencing on the date as mutually decided on or\nbefore the Appointed Date and ending on the Assets Transfer\nDate.\n\n6.0 SUPPLY OF BAGASSE\n\n6.1 The Karkhana shall continuously supply to PREL entire\nbagasse (excluding bagacillo) as and when generated in its\nsugar plant at Pravaranagar during the period beginning with\nCrushing Season of the year in which the Co-gen Facility\ncommences production and ending with the close of last\nCrushing Season Day until the Assets Transfer Date.\n\n6.4 PREL shall pay price for bagasse supplied by the Karkhana at\nthe rate mentioned in Schedule - II. The price shall be paid by\nPREL on monthly basis. The Karkhana shall raise bill on PREL\nfor bagasse supplied by the Karkhana to PREL during the\nprevious month. PREL shall make payment for such supply\nwithin 30 (thirty) days.\n\n6.5 The Karkhana shall supply bagasse to PREL having quantity\nnot less than 216,000 MT during each Crushing Season and as\nper quality specified in Schedule-l. The total quantity of supply\nof bagasse of 216,000 MT in a Crushing Season is arrived at\nconsidering 160 days in a Crushing Season (tolerance level of\nmaximum 4 days). If the Crushing Season is longer than 160\ndays (tolerance level of maximum 4 days), a quantity of 1100\nMT/day of bagasse at the contracted price shall be supplied by\nthe Karkhana in addition to the 216,000 MT. Therefore, under\nsuch circumstances, the minimum assured quantity of bagasse\nto be supplied by the Karkhana shall stand increased\naccordingly. The Karkhana shall give all help to PREL in\nprocuring sugarcane trash/biomass from the farmers for this\nproject. The Parties agree that a detailed agreement for this\npurpose shall be executed within 6 months of signing of this\nAgreement.\n\n6.6 The Karkhana shall intimate to PREL three months in advance\nthe tentative date of commencement of Crushing Season and\nPVR 77 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nprovide a finalized schedule of supply of bagasse and bio-gas\nat least one month prior to the commencement of Crushing\nSeason. Karkhana shall adhere to. The said Schedule. If during\nany Crushing Season, the Karkhana is unable to adhere to its\ngiven schedule, the Karkhana shall procure the quantity\nequivalent to the shortfall from other sources at its own cost\nand supply the same to PREL to adhere to the schedule. PREL\nshall pay to the Karkhana at the contracted rate as mentioned\nin Schedule. II for such supply of bagasse.\n\n6.7 If the Karkhana fails to supply the minimum assured quantity\nof bagasse as mentioned above, PREL shall be entitled to\nrecover and the Karkhana shall pay to PREL the loss due to the\npurchase price differential of the bagasse over and above the\ncontracted rate incurred by PREL.

Cost incurred by PREL on purchase and transfer of\nthe bagasse up to Hook Up Point on such shortfall over the\ncontracted rate mentioned in Schedule - II shall be borne by\nthe Karkhana. The Karkhana shall make payment to PREL for\nsuch loss every month before the end of the month.\n\n6.8 If PREL remains in default in making payment for the bagasse\nto the Karkhana for more than 3 months without prior written\nconsent of the Karkhana, the Karkhana shall be free to sell its\nbagasse to any other party. In such situation, any short\nrealization on sale of bagasse in comparison to the contracted\nrate mentioned in Schedule - II, shall be borne and paid by\nPREL to the Karkhana.\n\n7.0 SUPPLY OF BIO-GAS\n\n7.1 The Karkhana shall supply entire bio-gas generated from the\nbio-gas plant during the period beginning from COD and till\nthe Assets Transfer Date.\n\n7.3 The bio-gas shall be transferred by the Karkhana to PREL at\nthe Hook Up Point mentioned in Schedule - I-B on continuous\nbasis as it is generated and collected. PREL shall provide and\ninstall at a suitable position and at its own cost meters to\nmeasure flow of bio-gas on continuous basis. The meters shall\nbe calibrated and serviced as per manufacturer's service\nschedule during which time representatives of the Karkhana\nand PREL shall remain present. The Karkhana shall provide\npumping pressurization required to maintain the supply\npressure of bio-gas.\n\n7.7 If PREL is unable for any reason to accept delivery of bio-gas from the\nKarkhana or remains in default in making payment for the bio-gas to\nthe Karkhana for more than 3 months without prior written consent\nof the Karkhana, the Karkhana shall be free to divert and use its bio-\ngas in any other plant of the Karkhana. In case the Biogas is not used\nin any other plant of Karkhana, such non-supply of bio-gas to the co-\ngen Facility shall be deemed to be in satisfaction of minimum assured\nquantity mentioned in Schedule -I however PREL will not be liable to\npay for such non-supply of bio-gas.\n\nPVR 78 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n8.0 SUPPLY OF POWER & STEAM\n\n8.1 Subject to the supply of Bagasse and Bio-gas as per the quantity and\n\nquality specified in Schedule-I by Karkhana and except for the Force\nOutage, PREL shall meet entire process steam and power requirement\nof the Karkhana up to the extent mentioned in Schedule - I during the\nCrushing Season and Off Season.\n\n8.11 It is expressly provided that continuous and uninterrupted supply of\npower and steam by PREL to the Karkhana, in accordance with\nrequirements mentioned in Schedule J is essence of this Agreement\nbased on fulfillment of mutual obligations by the Parties. PREL should\nmake best endeavors to ensure continuous and uninterrupted supply\nof power and steam to the Karkhana, particularly during the Crushing\nSeason. In case of Forced outage, PREL would make best efforts to\nprovide power up to the limits specified in Schedule - I to the\nKarkhana through MSEDCL or any alternative source at the sole costs\nof Karkhana. PREL shall make best endeavors to maintain supply of\nsteam by keeping its boiler operational and supplying through\nPressure Reducing and De-Superheating Station (\"PRDS\").\n\n8.12 Without prejudice to above, in case of failure on the part of PREL to\nsupply assured quantity of electricity and steam as mentioned in\nSchedule - I, the Karkhana shall be free to take such steps as it thinks\nappropriate including purchase of electricity/steam from any other\nparty or generation thereof in captive facilities, if any.

Having noted the clauses of the PDA, the clauses of Land Lease\n\nDeed dated 12 July, 2010 are required to be noted:\n\n\"5(viii) That the lessor hereby grants the irrevocable power and\nauthority to the lessee to construct on and under the Leased\nLand and all such construction shall be the property of the\nLessee and/or its nominees/assignees.\n\n(ix) That the lessor hereby agrees and undertakes that it shall not\nmortgage, sell, dispose of or otherwise alienate or encumber\nthe Leased Land or any part of thereof in any manner\nwhatsoever during the expiry or earlier termination of this\nagreement.\n\n8. ASSIGNMENT\n\nThe Lessee may create any mortgage or charge over the\nLeased Land in favour of the Lenders or any agent or trustee\nacting on their behalf or assign this lease deed in favour of\nthe lenders by way of security for the implementation of the\nCo-Generation Facility and allied activities. Provided that if\nthe charge or mortgage is created or the Lease Deed is\nrequired to be assigned to any person other than the\nLenders, the Lessee shall do so only with the prior written\nconsent of the Lessor.\"\n\n65. It is stated by the petitioner that as per the terms of the PDA, the\n\npetitioner had agreed to inter alia facilitate modernization of the sugar\n\nplant and had agreed to spend upto Rs.20 crores on such modernization.\n\nThe petitioner had accordingly advanced an amount of Rs.13.5 crores to\n\nthe respondent. Subsequently, in January 2015, the parties entered into\n\nan agreement called as the \"Supplementary Agreement\", wherein the\n\nrespondent agreed to refund an amount of Rs.13.50 crores to the\n\npetitioner so as to facilitate the commissioning of the plant in all\n\nrespects on or before 31 March, 2015. It is the case of the petitioner that\n\non the refund of the said advance, both the parties were relieved of all\nPVR 82 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nobligations as required under clause 14 of the PDA. It is the case of the\n\npetitioner that under the Supplementary Agreement, the respondent had\n\nagreed that the petitioner would be required to avail borrowings from\n\nthe banks or any other source for completing the installation of the Co-\n\ngen plant.\n\n66. It is not in dispute that the petitioner completed the setting up of\n\nthe Co-gen plant and started commercial operations with effect from 6\n\nNovember, 2015. The Co-gen plant started producing electricity and\n\nsteam, which was being supplied to the respondent as per the PDA and\n\nthe Supplementary Agreement.\n\n67. It appears that discord and friction started to built up between the\n\nparties from the very first crushing season 2015-16. The petitioners have\n\ncontended that in the crushing season 2015-16, the respondent did not\n\nsupply the minimum assured quantity of bagasse fuel to the petitioner\n\nand there was a short supply of 90,340 metric tons of bagasse fuel.\n\nConsequently, the petitioner had to source coal as fuel, which caused a\n\nheavy financial burden on the petitioner. Further, for the crushing season\n\n2016-17 as well, there was short supply of 140,689 metric tons of\n\nbagasse fuel, hence again the petitioner had to source coal to run the\n\nCo-gen plant. All these factors according to the petitioner were not\n\nattributable to the petitioner, caused heavy financial burden on the\n\npetitioner.\n\nPVR 83 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n68. In the above circumstances, the petitioner addressed a letter dated\n\n22 November, 2017 to the respondent inter alia informing about the\n\nshort supply of bagasse fuel as also of the non-supply of biogas in the\n\npreceding crushing seasons and highlighted the losses incurred by it.\n\nThe petitioner appraised the respondent of the following issues : (i)\n\npower supply to respondent from the petitioner was never discontinued\n\nand the petitioner was continuously supplying the required power to\n\nthe respondent, throughout the year; (ii) there was no clarity/intimation\n\nfrom the respondent about the commencement of the crushing season;\n\n(iii) there was no delay in the boiler super heater coil work; (iv) the\n\npetitioner had completed the kind of quantum of work in less than 20\n\ndays; (v) the operations of respondent's factory had started for the\n\ncrushing season on 10 November, 2017 however , the respondent did\n\nnot achieve the capacity of 6000 metric tons per day; (vi) also the\n\noperation of respondent's distillery plant could not commence as work\n\non the same was in progress; The petitioner in the said letter stated\n\nthat for the successful running of the co-gen plant for both the parties\n\nand especially beneficiary being the respondent, following were the\n\nissues of concern :\n\n\"a) Karkhana is able to monetize vacant land in the form land rentals\nbeing paid by PREL;\n\nb) Karkhana is receiving power and steam at concession/subsidized\nprice/rates, which otherwise would have cost exorbitantly if it had to\narrange on its own;\n\nc) Returns from bagasse are beneficial & economical. If Karkhana\nwas to use it directly in its system, it would have cost more & expensive.\n\nPVR 84 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nWith power & steam being supplied from PREL plant, more value is\nbeing realized by Karkhana out of bagasse;\n\nd) In the event of supply of agreed quantity of bagasse & biogas by\nKarkhana, it also stand to gain additional payment in the form of\nadditional compensation, if the generation is more than agreed\nquantity;\n\ne) Karkhana will also get various grants & subsidies, including\nvarious tax exemptions on purchase of sugarcane, etc.\"\n\n69. As noted above, it is the petitioner's case, that its financially\n\nstressed condition was primarily due to respondent's failure to fulfill its\n\nobligation and non-adherence to agreed conditions in the PDA. In this\n\nsituation, the petitioner requested the respondent to release the\n\npetitioner's payment/compensation totaling to Rs.48.12 crores towards\n\nthe financial losses suffered by the petitioner due to non-compliance of\n\nobligations/ commitment by the respondent. It prima facie appears that\n\nin the very first operational year 2015-16, the respondent did not fulfill\n\nthe contractual requirement of supplying the agreed quantity of bagasse\n\nand bio-gas.\n\n70. It appears that even thereafter in the crushing season 2017-18\n\nagain there was a shortfall on the part of the respondent in supplying of\n\n67544 metric tons of bagasse fuel. Also the biogas fuel was not supplied\n\nto the petitioner. As the prices of coal were extremely high and unviable\n\ndue to international marketing conditions, the petitioner could not\n\nprocure coal as an alternate fuel. This again had a cascading effect on\n\nthe petitioner's finances, as on such failure of the respondent to supply\n\nthe assured minimum quantity of the bagasse and biogas the production\nPVR 85 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nhad adversely affected which was causing the petitioner further losses,\n\neventually the petitioner defaulted on its commitment to service its\n\ndebts towards its lenders, resulting in the petitioner's account being\n\nclassified as Non-Performing Asset (NPA) since December, 2017. In\n\norder to mitigate the situation, it was decided between the parties to try\n\nand amicably resolve the situation. The parties accordingly entered into\n\na \"Second Supplementary Agreement\" dated 30 October, 2018 under\n\nwhich for a period of one year, i.e., from 1 November, 2018 to 31\n\nOctober, 2019, the respondent was to operate and run the Co-gen plant\n\nfor one year in a manner as agreed under the said agreement. The\n\nrelevant clauses of such agreement are required to be noted which read\n\nthus :-\n\n4. The Amended PDA shall stand amended to the extent as stated\nunder this Agreement. All other provisions of the Amended PDA shall\nremain the same. The Parties agree that this Agreement when read\ntogether with the Project Development Agreement and the\nSupplementary Agreement shall constitute the entire understanding\nbetween the Parties.

The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that\nKarkhana shall not have any rights to operate and maintain the plant\nupon the expiry of the MOA Term and the Modified Arrangement\nincluding all provisions thereof shall automatically stand terminated and\nshall fall away.\n\n15. Addition/modification in the system of plant:\n\n15.2 Karkhana agrees not to change, modify, alter, add or remove or\ndo any such similar act to the existing technical set up or structure of\nthe plant without obtaining prior written approval from PREL.\n\n16.

Termination of the Modified Arrangement:\n\n18.1 Parties agree that the Modified Arrangement shall automatically\nterminate in the event a) the expiry of the MOA Term unless extended\nin accordance with Clause 12 of this Agreement and / or b) Karkhana\nbreaches any term as stated in this Agreement.\n\n71. Thus, under\nArticle 10.2\nand\nArticle 16.9\nof the second\n\nsupplementary agreement, the petitioner was responsible to supervise\n\nand inspect the operations of the co-gen plant from time to time. The\n\npetitioner nominated two representatives from its Head office for the\n\nsmooth co-ordination and functioning of the plant. The human\n\nresources, including technical team of the petitioner was to be retained\n\nby the respondent. Also the respondent had agreed not to change,\n\nmodify or alter or remove existing structure of the co-gen plant. Under\n\nClause 11.1, the respondent was inter alia to pay the petitioner a\n\nminimum guaranteed amount every month from 1 March, 2019\n\namounting to Rs.48 crores in escrow account for discharging\n\npetitioner's financial obligations towards the lenders. The respondent,\n\nhowever, breached in making payments as per Clause 11.1.\n\n72. The petitioners have strenuously contended, and it appears to be\n\nnot in dispute that in October-November, 2018, the respondent had\n\nrequested for permission to dismantle the biogas pipeline from the co-\n\ngen plant's boiler for connecting the same to the respondent's factory.\n\nPVR 88 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nThe petitioner however did not grant such permission, as this would\n\nhave amounted to the petitioner being deprived of the contractual\n\nsupply of bio-gas as per clause 4.5, 6.6,7.7 of the PDA and\n\nsupplementary agreement. Despite which the respondent in patent\n\nbreach of\nArticle 15.2\nof the Second Supplementary Agreement\n\ndismantled the existing biogas pipeline from the co-gen plant boiler and\n\ninstalled the same within the respondent's factory premises for captive\n\nuse, and since then, the respondent has not restored the pipeline and\n\ncontinues to use the same for its captive use. It appears that in such\n\ndisturbing circumstances, the one year term for the respondent to\n\noperate the co-gen plant under the Second Supplementary Agreement\n\ncame to an end on 30 October, 2019.\n\n73. The ensuing period was the crushing season 2019-20. The\n\npetitioner has stated that for the said crushing season, the petitioner\n\npumped in a sum of Rs. 4 crores for the maintenance of co-gen plant,\n\nthis was despite the petitioner's account being classified as NPA in\n\nDecember, 2017 and even when the lenders were unwilling to release\n\nfunds for operational requirement of the co-gen plant. However,\n\nalthough the financial constraints were so severe and when it was\n\nexpected that the plant should be operated optimally and with\n\nparticularity, it is the case of the petitioner that the respondent again put\n\nthe petitioner into a serious disadvantage and this time by committing a\n\nbreach of Clause 6.6 of the PDA, namely that the respondent failed to\nPVR 89 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nintimate the petitioner three months in advance of the tentative date of\n\ncommencement of the crushing season and to provide a finalized\n\nschedule of supply of bagasse and biogas at least one month prior to the\n\ncommencement of crushing season. It appears to be an admitted\n\nposition that for the crushing season 2019-20, there was a shortfall of\n\n155,222 metric tons of bagasse fuel than the minimum assured quantity\n\nin terms of PDA. Also, biogas fuel was not supplied, as the respondent\n\nhad dismantled and/or removed the biogas pipeline in or around\n\nOctober - November 2018.\n\n74. There appears to be much substance in the petitioner's contention\n\non the respondent illegally dismantling and removing the biogas\n\npipeline for captive use. This breach appears to be a serious breach. It is\n\nclear that the respondent has till date not restored the bio-gas pipeline\n\nand is using the same for captive use of the bio-gas in breach of the\n\nseveral conditions of the PDA. Further, it is also not clear as to under\n\nwhat right such pipeline could be dismantled by the respondent, thereby,\n\ndisturbing the working of the co-gen plant to the serious prejudice and\n\nat the cost of losses being caused to the petitioner. As correctly\n\ncontended on behalf of the petitioner the intention of the respondent\n\nclearly appears that the biogas need not be supplied to the petitioner,\n\nwhich certainly amounted to breach of Clauses 4.6 of the PDA\n\nagreement and Clause 15.2 of the second Supplementary Agreement\n\nwhereby the respondent agreed not to change, modify, alter or removal\nPVR 90 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nor any such or similar act to existing technical set up/ structure of the\n\nplant, without obtaining prior written approval of the respondent. It was\n\nalso clearly provided that the petitioner will operate the co-generation\n\nfacility till the asset transfer date (30 June 2041). Further, none of the\n\nclauses in the second SA dated 30 October 2018 permitted the\n\nrespondent to dismantle the biogas pipeline. The petitioner categorically\n\npointed out to the respondent by its letter dated 14 October 2020 that\n\nthe biogas pipeline has been dismantled by the respondent in the\n\nabsence of the petitioner's permission and has been installed within the\n\nrespondent captive area for its own use. The petitioner not only by such\n\nletter but also in an earlier meeting which was held between the parties\n\non 25 September 2020, requested the respondent to reinstall the\n\nstainless steel pipeline from the co-gen plant to the respondent's bio-gas\n\nplant so that the petitioner's co-gen plant starts receiving supply of\n\nbiogas from the respondent. However, there was no response\n\nwhatsoever to such request as also to the letter of the petitioner. This is\n\none of the telling circumstances as to what was being intended by the\n\nrespondent was to choke the petitioner's production.\n\n75. It appears that even for the next crushing season 2020-21, there\n\nwas a short supply of 96,344 MT of bagasse fuel by the respondent, as\n\nalso the bio-gas fuel was not supplied to the petitioner, as the\n\nrespondent had dismantled the biogas pipeline. Thus, as rightly\n\ncontended on behalf of the petitioner, prima facie, there was a clear\nPVR 91 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nbreach of Clause 6.5 of the PDA under which the respondent had agreed\n\nto supply the minimum quantity of bagasse to the petitioner of 216000\n\nMT during each crushing season. Further, for the crushing period 2020-\n\n21 the respondent failed to intimate the petitioner by a three months\n\nadvance notice as agreed in Clause 6.6 of the PDA prior to the\n\ncommencement of the crushing season and to provide a finalized\n\nschedule of bagasse and biogas one month prior to crushing season.\n\nThus, again, there was a breach of Clause 6.6 of the PDA.\n\n76. As to why with impunity the respondent was intending to be in\n\nbreach of the several terms and conditions of the PDA and the second SA\n\nand still remain in the contract, may be felt quite intriguing at this stage.\n\n77. It is in these circumstances, just prior to the commencement of the\n\ncrushing season 2020-21, an addendum agreement was executed\n\nbetween the petitioner and the respondent on 14 October 2020, under\n\nwhich the respondent admitted that it was unable to provide to the\n\npetitioner, the assured quantity of fuel (bagasse and bagasse equivalent\n\nof shortfall of biogas, as per the agreed terms of the PDA) and that\n\nthere was short supply of bagasse and bagasse equivalent of biogas to\n\nthe extent of 474,435 Metric Tonnes and the co-generation facility hence\n\nwas not able to run to its logical optimum original capacity, on account\n\nof which the petitioner was unable to comply its financial commitments\n\nto its consortium lenders. In clause (E) of the addendum agreement, the\nPVR 92 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nparties agreed that in full and final settlement of the claims of the\n\npetitioner, the parties agree that they were desirous to resolve the\n\nsituation by bringing the loan account back to a \"standard status\" with\n\nits lenders within a reasonable time-frame. The respondent agreed on a\n\nmutually acceptable basis on certain terms to supply fuel (bagasse and\n\nbiogas as per the agreed terms of the PDA) to enable the petitioner to\n\ncontinue its operations and achieve optimal capacity which will benefit\n\nboth the parties. Accordingly, it was agreed between the parties under\n\nthe said agreement that the respondent will supply additional bagasse to\n\nthe petitioner over and above the quantity specified in the PDA in the\n\nfollowing manner:-\n\n(a) During crushing season 2020-21 105,000 MT.\n(b) During crushing season 2021-22 105,000 MT.\n\n78. It was also agreed in the addendum agreement that there shall be\n\nno change in the above quantities. Also for the crushing season 2022-23\n\nit was agreed by the respondent to supply to the petitioner about\n\n105,000 MT of bagasse and for the crushing season 2023-24 about\n\n60,000 MT of bagasse, however, the exact quantity was to be decided\n\nmutually and recorded in writing within two months from the date of\n\nexecution of the said addendum agreement. In clause (8) of the\n\naddendum agreement it was agreed that in the event the respondent\n\nfailed to provide the bagasse aggregating to 210000 MT during the two\n\ncrushing seasons 2020-21 and 2021-22, the respondent shall be liable\nPVR 93 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nto supply to the petitioner the balance of the 4,74,435 MT bagasse as set\n\nout in the said clause.\n\n79. Although the addendum agreement is of such nature and appears\n\nto have originated from the respondent itself, and also as clearly seen\n\nfrom the document as placed on record that it has been signed by both\n\nthe parties, however, the respondent has taken a peculiar stand on the\n\naddendum agreement. The respondent in its reply affidavit dated 21\n\nNovember 2022 while not denying the execution of the said agreement\n\nhas contended that the addendum agreement does not bind the\n\nrespondent. The following statement of the respondent in paragraph 69\n\nof the reply affidavit can be noted:-\n\n\"The purported Addendum Agreement dated 14 October 2020\nrelied by the petitioner, does not form a binding and subsisting\nagreement and hence the Respondent is not under any obligation\nto make good any loss to the petitioner under the purported\nAddendum Agreement dated 14 October 2020\"\n\n80. It is surprising as to how the respondent can take this position,\n\nhaving already executed the addendum agreement.\n\n81. In fact, the stand as taken by the respondent in the reply affidavit\n\nis replete with statements which show that the respondent at its\n\nconvenience has been changing its stands, with a common theme, as\n\nreflected not only from the correspondence but also from its pleadings in\n\nthe present proceedings, that the respondent's intention is only to take\n\nover the co-gen plant, as if it is its own property, in complete deviation\nPVR 94 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nfrom what has been agreed between the parties on the take over of the\n\nplant, as on the \"asset transfer date\". There are number of statements in\n\ndifferent affidavits as filed on behalf of the respondent to this effect,\n\nhowever, one of such statements to this effect in the affidavit dated 21\n\nNovember 2021 can be noted which reads thus:-\n\n\"Various meetings have been held between the Chairman and senior\nmanagement of the Petitioner and the Respondent in 2020 and 2021,\nwherein discussions have been held to arrive at an amicable\nsettlement inter alia exploring the options whereby the Petitioner's\nplant would be permanently taken over/acquired by the Respondent\nand the loans of the petitioner would be settled with the Bankers of\nthe Petitioner.\"\n\n82. Prima facie it clearly appears from the reading of the pleadings on\n\nrecord that having breached the clauses in the agreement and having\n\nconfirmed such breaches in the addendum agreement, the respondent\n\nwanted to wriggle out of such binding commitment and obligations\n\nunder the addendum agreement . The above intention of the\n\nrespondent, so as to remain in breach of the contractual terms as agreed\n\nin the PDA, is quite apparent from the fact, that the respondent despite\n\nentering into an addendum agreement for the crushing season 2020-21,\n\nthe respondent defaulted in supplying minimum assured quantity of\n\nbagasse and there was a shortfall of 96344 MT on its part.\n\n83. It needs to be also noted that the petitioner by its letter dated 29\n\nMay 2021 addressed to the respondent had clearly recorded that for the\n\npast five crushing seasons (2015 to 2020) there was a shortfall of\n\nbagasse to the petitioner which amounted to 474435 MT. It was also\nPVR 95 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nstated that in the addendum agreement dated 14 October 2020 the\n\nrespondent had agreed to supply additional quantity of bagasse of\n\ntotally 365000 MT for the period 2020-21 to 2023-24. It was stated that\n\nduring the crushing season 2020-21, whcih was over and from 6 May\n\n2021 the respondent had not supplied the agreed quantity of bagasse to\n\nthe petitioner. It was also pointed out that the shortfall of bagasse for\n\nthe crushing season 2020-21 was about 201344 MT. The petitioner also\n\nrecorded that the respondent was in breach of the terms of supply of\n\nbagasse to the petitioner, both in terms of PDA as well as in terms of the\n\naddendum agreement. It was also stated that unless the shortfall is\n\nmade good and the respondent does not provide bagasse to the\n\npetitioner, till the start of the next crushing season (2021-22), the\n\npetitioner will suffer huge financial losses. Another letter dated 3 August\n\n2021 was addressed by the petitioner to the respondent pointing out\n\nfailure of the respondent to supply the contracted bagasse fuel to the\n\npetitioner. It was again pointed out that the respondent was in breach of\n\nthe terms of supply of bagasse to the petitioner in terms of the PDA as\n\nwell as in terms of the addendum agreement and that short supply for\n\ncrushing season 2020-21 was 201344 MT. It was also recorded that due\n\nto inability of the respondent to supply the entire quantum of bagasse\n\nfuel of 264720 MT per annum as per the PDA from the date of\n\ncommencement of operations upto the end of the last financial year that\n\nis 31 March 2021, the petitioner was not able to generate electricity,\nPVR 96 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nbecause of which it suffered huge losses, the figures of which were\n\ndetailed in a statement as set out in the said letter under the title\n\n\"Details of Loss of Profit on account of short supply of Bagasse by\n\nKarkhana\". It was stated that it was clear from the said chart that there\n\nwas a gross revenue loss of 170.19 crores and the net loss of Rs.120.41\n\ncrores, with a request to the respondent to henceforth honour the\n\nconditions under the PDA and the addendum agreement, so that the\n\nplant functions normally from the next crushing season. The petitioner\n\nalso recorded that the petitioner was awaiting the release of Rs.120.41\n\ncrores by the respondent.\n\n84. It is interesting to note the respondent's stand in the reply of the\n\nrespondent to the above referred letters of the petitioner. The\n\nrespondent commonly replied to the petitioner's letter dated 29 May\n\n2021, 3 August 2021 and 6 August 2021 by its letter dated 4 September\n\n2021, and as noted above, disowning the addendum agreement dated\n\n14 October 2020 and thereby not accepting any obligation thereunder,\n\nwith a justification as set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 as noted above.\n\nFrom the perusal of this long letter of the respondent, it is quite\n\napparent that the respondent has not disputed that there was a short\n\nsupply of bagasse for the last five crushing seasons. There is also no\n\nwhisper on its conduct of dismantling the biogas pipeline. However, a\n\npicture was sought to be painted, as if the petitioner is solely responsible\n\nfor the power supply and that too in the absence of adequate supply of\nPVR 97 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nbagasse and bio-gas which was the basic raw material on which the co-\n\ngen plant was to operate and which was to be supplied by the\n\nrespondent. In fact, the respondent surprisingly goes to the extent of\n\ndenying that there was any short supply of bagasse for last five crushing\n\nseasons on its part. It is also indicative that the respondent was trying to\n\nmake out a case of non maintenance of the plant as a reason for the\n\nrespondent not to supply the bagasse. Ex facie, such a contention was\n\nabsurd to say the least, as one could appreciate the respondent saying\n\nthat the bagasse was available and was being continuously supplied to\n\nthe petitioner and it was for some reason the petitioner refused to accept\n\nthe bagasse for any technical deficiency in the co-gen plant, only then,\n\nthe situation as being painted by the respondent could have been\n\nunderstood.\n\n85. It also needs to be noted from the contents of the respondent's\n\nletter dated 4 September, 2021 that the respondent stated that the\n\nparties had reconciled the accounts till 31 March, 2018 and it was\n\nagreed that the total amount to be paid to the respondent by the\n\npetitioner was Rs.5.01 crores towards full and final settlement of all\n\ndues/outstanding amounts. Paragraph 10(i) of the said letter reads\n\nthus:\n\n(i) The claims made by the PREL are calculated from Crushing\nSeason of 2015-16 onwards. The 2 nd Supplementary Agreement dated\n30 October, 2018 was executed between PREL and the Karkhana.\n\nUnder Clause 19.1 and 19.3 of the Supplementary Agreement dated 30\nOctober, 2018, the parties had reconciled the accounts till 31 March,\n2018 and it was agreed that the total amount to be paid to Karkhana by\nPVR 98 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nPREL is Rs.5.01 crores towards full and final settlement of all\ndues/outstanding amounts.\"\n\n86. It thus clearly appears from the respondent's own statement as\n\nnoted above that there can certainly be no justification for the\n\nrespondent to take over the assets of the petitioner, in a manner not\n\nknown to law. Further from paragraph 14 of the said letter, the\n\noccupation and possession of the petitioner of the co-gen plant to be\n\nwith the petitioner as on 4 May 2021, can instantly be inferred. The\n\nsaid paragraph reads thus:\n\n\"14. The Karkhana expects PREL to take all steps necessary to ensure\nthat the co-gen plant is fully ready and operational well in advance\nbefore the commencement of the upcoming crushing season 2021-22\n(i.e., tentatively from 15 October, 2021).\"\n\n87. The record also indicates that the petitioner by its letter dated 18\n\nJune, 2021 raised serious issues on the administration, safety and\n\nsecurity of the co-gen plant, again reiterating that there was a gross non-\n\ncompliance of the PDA by the respondent and that the respondent would\n\nneed to take appropriate consent from the petitioner, in writing, before\n\ninterfering in the affairs of the co-gen plant as set out in detail in the\n\nsaid letter.\n\n88. On behalf of the petitioner, it was strenuously submitted, that\n\nafter this petition was filed on 12 October, 2021 the respondent\n\nusurping the petitioner's rights have foisted themselves on the co-gen\n\nplant and has prevented the petitioners, its officers, employees and\nPVR 99 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nrepresentatives to enter and operate the co-gen plant. The pleadings on\n\nrecord as also the submissions as made on behalf of the respondent\n\nclearly indicates that the petitioner's contention in this regard is correct,\n\nas the respondent has started asserting that as on date, it is operating\n\nthe co-gen plant. The reply affidavit is also replete with diverse pleas of\n\nthe respondent contending that it is only the respondent which ought to\n\noperate the co-gen plant by ousting the petitioner.\n\n89. In the above circumstances, whether it was permissible for the\n\nrespondent to act in such manner and takeover the management and\n\noperation of the co-gen plant under any of the conditions in PDA or in\n\nother agreements as entered between the parties has become the core\n\nissue. In my prima facie opinion, clearly none of the terms and\n\nconditions of either PDA or the Supplementary Agreement or the Second\n\nSupplementary Agreement would confer any such right on the\n\nrespondent to takeover the co-gen plant and exclusively operate and\n\nmanage the co-gen plant which admittedly belongs to the petitioner. If\n\nany such rights were to accrue to the respondent, it would be only under\n\nthe \"asset transfer mechanism\" under the co-gen plant as per the terms\n\nand conditions of the PDA.\n\n90. As noted above, under the PDA the parties have clearly agreed for\n\nan \"Asset Transfer Date\"(clause 1.2) which is after completion of 25\n\nyears from the commencement of the commercial operations date\nPVR 100 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n(clause1.5). Further, the parties in Clause 25 have agreed to the \"Events\n\nof Default and Termination\". The 'events of default of respondent' as\n\nalso the 'event of default of the petitioner' have been separately defined\n\nin Clause 25.1. In Clause 25.2, the parties have agreed to the\n\ntermination procedure. In the event, there was to be a termination on\n\naccount of the respondent's default, in that event it was clearly agreed\n\nunder Clause 25.2 (b)(I)(2) of the PDA that it would require the\n\nrespondent to buy the Co-generation Facility at the \"Fair Market Value\"\n\nand such fair market value shall be determined by the independent\n\nCategory I Merchant Banker, to be appointed jointly by the respondent\n\nand the petitioner, or failing which transfer the Co-generation facility to\n\nany third party to recover its cost. In doing so, what is most vital to be\n\nnoted is, as to what has been agreed between the parties in the\n\nparagraph below Clause 25.2 b (3), which reads thus:\n\n\"And in any of the above rights being enforced the Karkhana hereby\nagrees, undertakes and covenants not to, in any manner, obstruct the\nworking or the operation of the Co-generation Facility and not to commit\nany acts or deeds which will have adverse effect on the operation and\nfunctioning of the Co-generation Facility and to extend full co-operation\nin enforcement of the rights by PREL.\"\n\n91. Further it needs to be noted that under the PDA in the event of\n\ntermination due to fault on the part of the petitioner, it was clearly\n\nagreed between the parties in Clause 25.2(b)(II) that the respondent\n\nshall have the right to buy the Co-generation Facility at a 90% of the Fair\n\nMarket Value, which shall be determined by independent Category I\nPVR 101 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nMerchant Banker to be appointed jointly by the respondent and the\n\npetitioner. The said clause reads thus:\n\n\"II. Termination for PREL Event of Default\n\nThe Karkhana shall have the right to buy Co-generation Facility at a\n90% of the Fair Market Value. The Fair Market Value shall be\ndetermined by the independent Category I Merchant Banker to be\nappointed jointly by the Karkhana and PREL.\"\n\n92. Another clause which needs a special reference is clause 28 of the\n\nPDA which provides for \"No Obstruction\" . This clause provides that the\n\nrespondent shall not create any kind of obstruction or interference in the\n\nwork of the petitioner till the subsistence of the PDA. Clause 28 of the\n\nPDA reads thus:-\n\n\" 28.0. No Obstruction\n\nThe Kharkhana shall not create any kind of obstruction or\ninterference in the work of PREL till the subsistence of this\nagreement.\"\n\n93. It is thus crystal clear from the PDA that the only right which\n\nwould be available and accrue in favour of the respondent to takeover\n\nthe co-gen plant is in a manner as agreed under the PDA and that is only\n\non the agreed procedure of determining the fair market value, being put\n\ninto motion, and only, on such determination of the said value/amounts,\n\nand on the same being paid to the petitioners, the assets of the co-gen\n\nplant could be transferred to the respondent prior to the asset transfer\n\ndate in the manner as agreed under clause 25.2.bI (2) or II of the PDA\n\nwhich is extracted below for convenience :-\n\n\"Clause 25.2.bI (2)\nPVR 102 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nTermination for Kharkhana Event of Default\n\n2) Require the Kharkhana to buy the cogeneration facility at the Fair Market\nValue. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined by the independent\ncategory I Merchant Banker to be appointed jointly by Kharkhana and PREL;\n\n....\"\n\nClause 25.2.bII\nTermination for PREL Event of Default\n\nThe Kharkhana shall have the right to buy the cogeneration facility at a 90%\nof the Fair Market Value. The Fair Market Value shall be determined by the\nindependent category I Merchant Banker to be appointed jointly by\nKharkhana and PREL\"\n\n94. In my prima facie opinion, the attempt of the respondent however\n\nappears to be to give a complete go-by to the above agreed procedure\n\nunder which the respondent could take over the assets of the petitioner\n\nonly at the fair market value and in no other manner. The respondent\n\ntherefore cannot take a position that the petitioner ought not to\n\noperate /manage its own co-gen plant. As clear from the record, the\n\nrespondent in a coercive manner and taking undue advantage of the fact\n\nthat the petitioner is in financial distress appears to be exploiting the\n\nsituation to prepone the taking over of the plant, 15 years earlier to the\n\nAssets Transfer Date (30.06.2041). Various actions of the respondent\n\nsuggest an attempt to grab this opportunity to its advantage and\n\nprofiteer at the cost of huge investment as made on the co-gen plant by\n\nthe petitioner.\n\n95. Prima facie it is also gravely doubtful as to how the respondent\n\ncould disown the addendum agreement by merely saying that it is not\nPVR 103 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nbinding on the respondent, which if was to be implemented could have\n\ncertainly changed the situation for the petitioner, and parties could have\n\npossibly avoided to litigate.\n\n96. Now, the submissions as made by Mr. Khambata in opposing the\n\nreliefs prayed by the petitioner can be considered, so as to examine as to\n\nwhether the petitioner would nonetheless become dis-entitled to such\n\nreliefs. The first submission of Mr. Khambata on the backdrop of the\n\nSugar Commissioner passing an order dated 27 December, 2021,\n\nobserving that \"either party may refer the dispute to arbitration\n\naccording to the provisions of Clause 33.2 of the contract\", is to the\n\neffect, that the present petition filed under\nSection 9\nof the Act ought to\n\nbe held, to be not maintainable, on the ground that the petitioner has no\n\ninclination to commence arbitral proceedings. In my opinion, such\n\ncontention is required to be stated to be rejected for more than one\n\nreason. Firstly, for the reason that the present petition was filed on 12 th\n\nOctober 2021 that is, prior to the Sugar Commissioner passing the said\n\norder on 27th December 2021. Secondly, for the reason that Mr.\n\nAndhyarujina, at the outset, has stated that his clients are immediately\n\nintending to agree to nominate an arbitral tribunal, however, without\n\nprejudice to the petitioner's right to press for the reliefs in the present\n\npetition. Thus, Mr. Khambata's contention that there is no inclination for\n\nthe petitioner to commence arbitration cannot be accepted. It is also not\n\nthe case that the petitioner has invoked arbitration and the petitioner is\nPVR 104 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\ndilly-dallying it. From a reading of\nSection 9\nof the Act, it is clear that a\n\nparty is entitled to approach the Court praying for interim measures\n\ninter alia before the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, as in\n\nthe present case. Also a party in a given situation would be entitled to\n\napproach the Court even during or after making of an arbitral award but\n\nbefore it is enforced in accordance with\nSection 36\nof the Act.\n\n97. It is clear that the petitioner, complaining of patent breach of their\n\ncontractual rights inter alia under the PDA and in order to seek\n\nprotection of its arbitral interest and preservation of the subject matter\n\nof the arbitral agreement i. e. Co-gen plant, has approached the Court\n\npraying for interim measures. Once the petitioner approaches this Court\n\nraising such serious concerns, looked from any angle, it is not possible to\n\naccept Mr. Khambata's submission that the petitioner deserves to be non-\n\nsuited either on account of its alleged non-willingness to proceed in\n\narbitration or of any alleged dis-entitlement on the petitioner in not\n\ninvoking the provisions of\nSection 11\nof the Act. The respondents have\n\nalso not invoked arbitration. Thus, in my opinion, in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, it would be required to be held that the\n\npetitioner was entitled to and has appropriately taken recourse to the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 9\n, and as such there is no impediment for the\n\nCourt, to consider the prayers as made in the Petition. Thus, in the facts\n\nof the present case, Mr. Khambata's reliance on the decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Firm Ashok Traders And Anr. Vs.\nPVR 105 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nGurumukh Das Saluja And Ors., reported in (2004) 3 SCC 155 is not\n\nwell founded, as this is not a case, in which the petitioner in any\n\nmanner, has slept over its rights and secondly it is not the case that the\n\npetitioner has no manifest intention to take recourse to arbitral\n\nproceedings. The circumstances fully justify the petitioner to approach\n\nthis Court by taking recourse to\nSection 9\nof the Act.\n\n98. Prima facie the complexion of the case is such that after the\n\npresent petition was filed, the respondent has left no stone unturned to\n\nusurp petitioner's right to manage and operate Co-gen plant, and in fact,\n\nthe respondent has attempted to take over the Co-gen plant, so as to\n\nfoist removal of the petitioner and/or its employees and staff entering\n\nthe co-gen plant. It is, in these circumstances, Interim Application (L)\n\nNo. 3343 of 2022 was filed by the petitioner praying for further reliefs.\n\nThus, to accept Mr. Khambata's contention that the\nSection 9\npetition be\n\nheld to be not maintainable, and that petitioner should seek reliefs\n\nbefore the arbitral tribunal under\nSection 17\nof the Act, in my opinion,\n\nis a hyper technical argument which if accepted in the present facts\n\nwould amount to manifest derailment of justice. It may be observed\n\nthat technicalities of law can never prevail and/or overcome the pursuits\n\nof justice. Thus, even applying the principles of law as laid down in the\n\ndecision in\nFirm Ashok Traders\n(Supra), it is difficult to accept that the\n\npetitioner has not contemplated or is manifestly avoiding to commence\n\narbitral proceedings in a reasonable time. In such decision, it is clearly\nPVR 106 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nheld by the Supreme Court, that what is expected of a party is to\n\ncommence arbitral proceedings within a reasonable time, and such\n\nreasonable time would depend on facts and circumstances of each case.\n\nIt was also held that commencement of arbitral proceedings is not\n\ncontemplated on the interim relief itself being allowed or denied and the\n\nCourt while passing an order under\nSection 9\nmay put a party on terms\n\nand may also re-call the order, if the party commits breach of the terms.\n\nThe observations of the Court in this context can be noted in paras 13,\n\n17 and 18 which read as under :-\n\n\"13. ........The reliefs which the court may allow to a party under\nclauses (I) and (ii) of\nSection 9\nflow from the power vesting in the\ncourt exercisable by reference to \"contemplated\", \"pending\" or\n\"completed\" arbitral proceedings. The court is conferred with the\nsame power for making the specified orders as it has for the purpose\nof and in relation to any proceedings before it though the venue of\nthe proceedings in relation to which the power under\nSection 9\nis\nsought to be exercised is the Arbitral Tribunal. Under the scheme of\nthe A & C Act, the arbitration clause is separable from other clauses of\nthe partnership deed. The arbitration clause constitutes an agreement\nby itself. In short, filing of an application by a party by virtue of its\nbeing a party to an arbitration agreement is for securing a relief\nwhich the court has power to grant before, during or after arbitral\nproceedings by virtue of Section 9 of the A & C Act. .......\n\n17. There are two other factors which are weighing heavily with us\nand which we proceed to record. As per the law\nlaid down by\nthis\nCourt in Sundaram Finance Ltd. An application under\nSection 9\n\nseeking interim relief is maintainable even before commencement of\narbitral proceedings. What does that mean ? In Sundaram Finance\nLtd. Itself the Court has said : (SCC p. 488, para 19)\n\n\"It is true that when an application under\nSection 9\nis filed\nbefore the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, there has to be\nmanifest intention on the part of the applicant to take recourse to the\narbitral proceedings.\"\n\nSection 9\npermits application being filed in the court before the\ncommencement of the arbitral proceedings but the provision does not\ngive any indication of how much before. The word \"before\" means,\ninter alia, \"ahead of; in presence or sight of; under the consideration\nor cognizance of\". The two events sought to be interconnected by use\nof the term \"before\" must have proximity of relationship by reference\nPVR 107 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nto occurrence; the later event proximately following the proceeding\nevent as a foreseeable or \"within-sight\" certainty. The party invoking\n\nSection 9\nmay not have actually commenced the arbitral proceedings\nbut must be able to satisfy the court that the arbitral proceedings are\nactually contemplated or manifestly intended (as Sundaram Finance\nLtd. puts it) and are positively going to commence within a\nreasonable time. What is a reasonable time will depend on the facts\nand circumstances of each case and the nature of interim relief sought\nfor would itself give an indication thereof. The distance of time must\nnot be such as would destroy the proximity of relationship of the two\nevents between which it exists and elapses. The purpose of enacting\n\nSection 9\n, read in the light of the Model Law and UNCITRAL. Rules is\nto provide \"interim measures of protection\". The order passed by the\ncourt should fall within the meaning of the expression \"an interim\nmeasure of protection\" as distinguished from an all-time or\npermanent protection.\n\n18. Under the A & C Act, 1996, unlike the predecessor Act of 1940,\nthe Arbitral Tribunal is empowered by\nSection 17\nof the Act to make\norders amounting to interim measures. The need for\nSection 9\n, in\nspite of\nSection 17\nhaving been enacted, is that\nSection 17\nwould\noperate only during the existence of the Arbitral Tribunal and its\nbeing functional. During that period, the power conferred on the\nArbitral Tribunal under\nSection 17\nand the power conferred on the\ncourt under\nSection 9\nmay overlap to some extent but so far as the\nperiod pre- and post- the arbitral proceedings is concerned, the party\nrequiring an interim measure of protection shall have to approach\nonly the court. The party having succeeded in securing an interim\nmeasure of protection before arbitral proceedings cannot afford to sit\nand sleep over the relief, conveniently forgetting the \"proximately\ncontemplated\" or \"manifestly intended\" arbitral proceedings itself. If\narbitral proceedings are not commenced within a reasonable time of\nan order under\nSection 9\n, the relationship between the order under\n\nSection 9\nand the arbitral proceedings would stand snapped and the\nrelief allowed to the party shall cease to be an order made \"before\" i.\ne. in contemplation of arbitral proceedings. The court, approached by\na party with an application under\nSection 9\n, is justified in asking the\nparty and being told how and when the party approaching the court\nproposes to commence the arbitral proceedings. Rather, the scheme in\nwhich\nSection 9\nis placed obligates the court to do so. The court may\nalso while passing an order under\nSection 9\nput the party on terms\nand may recall the order if the party commits breach of the terms.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n99. Thus\n,\nthe above decision\nof the Supreme Court would not support\n\nthe proposition as canvassed by Mr. Khambata on his contention on\n\nreadiness and willingness of the petitioner to commence arbitration as in\n\nthe present case the petitioner is not disinclined to commence\n\narbitration and about which I am wholly satisfied. It is also difficult to\nPVR 108 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nconceive that when the petitioner itself feels aggrieved by so many\n\nactions of the respondent, which have been urged to be in total breach\n\nof the PDA, the petitioner in such situation would remain content with\n\nthe proceedings and not commence arbitration. The respondent hence\n\nis completely ill-advised to labour such contention to this extent, to non-\n\nsuit the petitioner from the\nSection 9\nproceedings.\n\n100. Further, the situation in hand is not such, as the parties stood, in\n\nthe case of\nArcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Ltd. vs. Essar Bulk Terminal\n\nLtd.\n, (2021) SCC Online SC 718 on which reliance is placed by\n\nMr.Khambata. In this case, the question which was raised, in the appeal,\n\nbefore the Supreme Court was as to whether the Court has the power to\n\nentertain an application under\nSection 9(1)\nof the Act once the arbitral\n\ntribunal was constituted, and if so, what is the true meaning and period\n\nof the expression \"entertain\" as used in\nSection 9(3)\nof the Act. Another\n\nquestion which was examined by the Supreme Court was whether the\n\nCourt is obliged to examine the efficacy of the remedy under\nSection 17\n\nbefore passing an order under\nSection 9(1)\nof the Act, once an arbitral\n\ntribunal was constituted. There cannot be two opinions, on what has\n\nbeen\nlaid down in\nsuch context by the Supreme Court, namely, it is only\n\nwhen the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the\n\nremedy provided under\nsection 17\nefficacious, the Court in such\n\nsituations may entertain the\nSection 9\nproceedings. In the present case\n\nthe arbitral tribunal is yet to be constituted. Hence, the Court is certainly\nPVR 109 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nnot concerned with a situation, that an arbitral tribunal having being\n\nconstituted the petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of the Court under\n\nSection 9\nof the Act and/or the provisions of sub-section (3) of\nSection 9\n\nhave become relevant, so as to consider a question, that the\nSection 9\n\nproceedings are not maintainable. In the context of examining the\n\nquestions which fell for consideration of the Supreme Court, as noted\n\nabove, the Supreme Court has categorically held that even if an arbitral\n\ntribunal is constituted, there may be myriad of reasons why an interim\n\napplication before an arbitral tribunal may not be an efficacious remedy\n\nto\nSection 9(1)\nproceedings. The Supreme Court observed that\n\napplications for interim relief are necessarily applications which are\n\nrequired to be disposed of urgently, as interim relief is granted in aid of\n\nfinal relief. The object of the provision being to ensure protection being\n\ngranted in regard to the subject matter of arbitration and/or otherwise\n\nensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous and\n\nthe arbitral award does not become an award on paper of no real value.\n\nThe following observations of the Court which re-iterate the position in\n\nlaw on the entitlement of the parties to invoke\nSection 9(1)\nis required\n\nto be noted, which reads thus:\n\n\"96. Even after an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, there may be\nmyriads of reasons why the Arbitral Tribunal may not be an\nefficacious alternative to\nSection 9(1)\n. This could even be by reason\nof temporary unavailability of any one of the Arbitrators of an\nArbitral Tribunal by reason of illness, travel etc.\n\n97. Applications for interim relief are inherently applications\nwhich are required to be disposed of urgently. Interim relief is\ngranted in aid of final relief. The object is to ensure protection of the\nproperty being the subject matter of Arbitration and/or otherwise\nPVR 110 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nensure that the arbitration proceedings do not become infructuous\nand the Arbitral Award does not become an award on paper, of no\nreal value.\n\n98. The principles for grant of interim relief are (I) good prima\nfacie case, (ii) balance of convenience in favour of grant of interim\nrelief and (iii) irreparable injury or loss to the applicant for interim\nrelief. Unless applications for interim measures are decided\nexpeditiously, irreparable injury or prejudice may be caused to the\nparty seeking interim relief.\n\n107. It is reiterated that\nSection 9(1)\nenables the parties to an\narbitration agreement to approach the appropriate Court for interim\nmeasures before the commencement of arbitral proceedings, during\narbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of an arbitral\naward but before it is enforced and in accordance with\nSection 36\nof\nthe Arbitration Act. The bar of\nSection 9(3)\noperates where the\napplication under\nSection 9(1)\nhad not been entertained till the\nconstitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Of course it hardly need be\nmentioned that even if an application under\nSection 9\nhad been\nentertained before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Court always\nhas the discretion to direct the parties to approach the Arbitral\nTribunal, if necessary by passing a limited order of interim\nprotection, particularly when there has been a long time gap between\nhearings and the application has for all practical purposes, to be\nheard afresh, or the hearing has just commenced and is likely to\nconsume a lot of time. In this case, the High Court has rightly\ndirected the Commercial Court to proceed to contemplate the\nadjudication.\"\n\n101. The judgment of the the Gujarat High Court in the case of\nEssar\n\nBulk Terminal v. Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Limited (First Appeal\n\nNo.\n3040 of 2021 dated 03.02.2022) on which reliance is placed by Mr.\n\nKhambata, is also a decision which discusses the powers of the Court\n\nunder\nSection 9\nof the Act vis-a-vis the power of the tribunal under\n\nSection 17\nof the Act.\n\nIn para 113 of\nthe said decision\n, while referring to\n\nthe decisions in\nRamniklal N. Bhutta vs. State of Maharashtra\n, reported\n\nin (\n1997)1 SCC 134 and Raunaq International Ltd. Vs. I.V.R.\n\nConstruction Ltd.\n, reported in (1999)1 SCC 492, it was held that in an\n\nappropriate case, the Court in ordering interim measures, must not\nPVR 111 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nhesitate in exercising its powers. The Court observed that in judging\n\nwhether a case is 'appropriate' or not for the grant of interim measures,\n\nthe Court is required to do some tightrope walking. The principles to be\n\nborne in mind while granting interim measures are the existence of a\n\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and the possibility of\n\nirreparable loss or prejudice.\n\n102. It is, hence, difficult to conceive as to how in the fact situation, the\n\nCourt can distance itself from exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 9\n,\n\nespecially when a party such as the petitioner, has approached the Court\n\nwith utmost expedition, when the situation eminently demanded it to\n\nso approach and admittedly when the invocation to arbitration had not\n\nhappened. Thus, in the facts in hand, when affidavits after affidavits are\n\nalready filed by the respondent in contesting the present proceedings,\n\nmerely on the respondent raising a farcical issue of the petitioner not\n\ncommencing arbitral proceedings, should not deter this Court, from\n\nentertaining this\nSection 9\npetition. It cannot be overlooked that in an\n\nappropriate case, the need to grant of interim measures in exercise of\n\nthe powers under\nSection 9\n, cannot be rendered illusory, merely because\n\nthe opponent in such proceedings insists on arbitration. Such\n\nproposition would be in the teeth of the mandate which flows from\n\nsection 9\n. This more particularly when the Court has exercised its sound\n\ndiscretion that the interest of justice overwhelmingly requires the Court\n\nto entertain proceedings under\nSection 9\nof the Act.\n\nPVR 112 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n103. Thus, in the facts of the case, Mr. Khambata's submissions, if\n\naccepted would lead to not only have the effect of the Court not\n\nrecognizing the mandate of sub-section (1) of\nsection 9\nbut would also\n\namount to prejudicially affecting the arbitral interest of the parties. It\n\ncan never be the intent of law that merely because in the midst of the\n\nSection 9\nproceedings, a party opposing\nSection 9\nproceedings insists\n\nand shows intention to go to arbitration, in that event necessarily the\n\nCourt, should mechanically dispose the\nSection 9\npetition by\n\ncompulsorily referring the parties to agitate their contentions on interim\n\nmeasures before the arbitral tribunal under\nSection 17\nof the Act. If\n\nsuch an interpretation, as being canvassed on behalf of the respondent is\n\naccepted, it would not only defeat the provisions of\nSection 9(1)\nof the\n\nAct, but also in a given situation it would be contrary to the intent of the\n\nprovisions of Sub-section (3) of\nSection 9\n. The observations of the\n\nSupreme Court paragraphs 96 and 107 in the case of\nArcelor Mittal\n\nNippon Steel India Limited\n(supra) would aid this conclusion.\n\n104. In any event, Mr. Khambata's contention that this petition ought\n\nnot to be entertained and the petitioner be relegated to a remedy under\n\nsection 17\nof the Act, referring to the Sugar Commissioner's order dated\n\n27 December 2021 whereunder the Sugar Commissioner merely\n\nobserved that ultimately it is the dispute between the petitioner and\n\nrespondent which needs to be taken to arbitration, by no acceptable\nPVR 113 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nstandard can be interpreted to mean a manifest intention of the\n\npetitioner not to invoke arbitration. By this logic even the respondent\n\nhas not invoked the arbitration in a manner known to law i.e. by\n\nissuance of a notice, as contemplated by\nSection 21\nof the Act. Such\n\nobservation of the Sugar Commissioner cannot be any commencement\n\nof arbitral proceedings as\nSection 21\nof the Act would ordain. It is, thus,\n\ntoo farfetched for the respondent to contend that this petitoin ought not\n\nto be entertained on the ground that there is no intention of the\n\npetitioner to refer the disputes to arbitration.\n\n105. The next contention as urged by Mr. Khambata is to the effect that\n\nthe petitioner is not entitled for the relief as prayed for in prayer clause\n\n(b), for the reason that the respondent is in \"joint possession\" of the co-\n\ngen plant with the petitioner. It is Mr. Khambata's submission that once\n\nthere is a joint possession, there is no question of the petitioner taking a\n\nplea that the respondents be removed and restrained from the co-gen\n\nplant, hence there is no necessity of such a relief to the petitioner. To\n\nsupport such contention of joint possession, Mr. Khambata has drawn\n\nthe Court's attention to paragraph 22 of the reply affidavit, in which the\n\nrespondent on such plea, has made the following statement, which\n\nneeds to be reproduced :\n\n\"The respondent has thus been handing the maintenance activity\nof the co-gen plant prior to the start of the crushing season 2020-21 as\nwell. Acting on the requests/invitations of the petitioner, the\nRespondent has deputed its labour, personnel, engineers at the co-gen\nplant to look into the day-to-day operations of the co-gen plant. The\nco-gen plant has therefore been in the joint possession of the petitioner\nPVR 114 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nand the respondent uninterruptedly for the past couple of years. The\nrespondent and the petitioner have been provided unrestricted access\nto the co-gen plant and the sugar factory. Further acting on the various\nrepresentations of the petitioner (including oral discussions between\nthe engineers/staff of petitioner and respondent), the respondent has\nprovided spares, consumables, paid salaries of the petitioner, provided\noperational support by deputing personnel from time to time to the Co-\ngen plant. In this entire endeavour (which is not the business of the\nrespondent), the respondent has spent crores of rupees in respect of the\nco-gen plant's operations and running at the instance and requests of\nthe petitioner, made from time to time. The petitioner has not repaid\nthe respondent for these expenses and has thus earned the benefits of\nall the expenses/work put in by the respondent. In these\ncircumstances, it is submitted that the petitioner is now estopped from\nseeking the reliefs set out in\nSection 9\npetition against the respondent.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n106. In my opinion, Mr. Khambata's contention of the respondent to be\n\nin joint possession of the co-gen plant with the petitioner is not worthy\n\nof acceptance looked from any angle including on facts. This, firstly for\n\nthe reason that such contention militates against express terms and\n\nconditions of the PDA (refer clause 25.2 b(II), 25.2 b(3) and clause 28 )\n\nand Clause 12.4 of the second Supplementary Agreement dated 30\n\nOctober, 2018. Once such clauses expressly bring about the contractual\n\nrelations between the parties, that the respondent shall not be\n\ninterfering and/or obstructing in the conduct and operation of the co-\n\ngen plant by the respondent, then a specious plea on affidavit to set up a\n\ncase of joint possession, as one of the defences cannot be countenanced.\n\nThere is no document whatsoever which would show that after the\n\nexpiry of the period of the second Supplementary Agreement being 31\n\nOctober 2019, the petitioner had handed over the co-gen plant to the\n\nrespondent much less the possession as is normally and prudently\n\nunderstood in law. In the absence of any lawful handing over of the\nPVR 115 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nmanagement and operation of the co-gen plant in favour of the\n\nrespondent by the petitioner the only presumption is that the petitioner's\n\noperation and management of the co-gen plant was sought to be\n\nusurped by the respondent in an unlawful manner and by intimidation,\n\nforce or coercion as asserted by the petitioner. There can be no other\n\nmethod.\n\n107. In any event, even on fact, such a plea of the respondent of joint\n\npossession appears to be extremely lame so as to warrant any\n\nacceptance, considering the materials as placed on record. It needs to\n\nbe observed that even assuming that the petitioner permitted the\n\nrespondent to carry out certain activities after the one year period under\n\nthe second Supplementary Agreement (01.11.2018 to 30.10.2019) had\n\ncome to an end, in the absence of any cogent material, the respondent\n\ncannot contend that the respondent are managing and operating the\n\nplant and/or that the petitioner was ousted to operate and manage the\n\nco-gen plant. There is not an iota of material which would support such\n\ncontention of the respondent that the petitioner consciously and with\n\nfull knowledge and in any manner known to law had put the respondent\n\nin possession of the co-gen plant, thereby giving up its rights to operate\n\nand manage the co-gen plant. The contentions of the respondent in this\n\nregard, in my opinion, are too overbearing, far-fetched and far from\n\nreality and bereft of an acceptable material whatsoever. It also needs to\n\nbe observed that the respondent in its mighty and dominant local\nPVR 116 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nposition cannot be heard to say that the respondent have taken over,\n\noperation and management of the co-gen plant in a manner not known\n\nto law.\n\n108. As noted in the foregoing paragraphs, the present proceedings\n\nwere filed on a clear apprehension as set out in paragraph 29 of the\n\npetition that the respondents or its agents may enter upon the premises\n\nof the co-gen plant to operate it for the benefit of the respondent and\n\nthereby causing immense loss and hardship to the petitioner, which the\n\npetitioner contended cannot be compensated in terms of money. The\n\npetitioner also categorically contended that the respondent had started\n\nmobilizing its manpower and security personnel on the site of the co-gen\n\nplant and may therefore take control of the entire plant to the ouster of\n\nthe petitioner thereby depriving the petitioner of the lawful ownership\n\nof the co-gen plant. It was also apprehended that the petitioner strongly\n\nbelieved that the respondent would alienate, sell, destroy, damage,\n\ntransfer, tamper, assign and/or create third party interest in respect of\n\nthe assets with a view to prejudice the rights of the petitioner and hence,\n\nsuch being the subject matter of the arbitral proceedings, interim\n\nmeasures ought to be granted. Further in an Interim Application which\n\nwas filed on behalf of the petitioner on 4 February 2022, the petitioner\n\nhas referred to further events and thereafter the petitioner has\n\ncategorically pleaded that the respondents have prevented the\n\npetitioner's entry to the co-gen plant and has taken over the operation\nPVR 117 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nand management of the co-gen plant between 12 October, 2021 (i.e. the\n\ndate of filing of the petition) till 26 October, 2021 thereafter in such\n\nsituation the petitioner was required to move the Court to seek interim\n\nreliefs.\n\n109. From the submissions as advanced on behalf of the respondent, it\n\nclearly appears that the respondent although has taken an untenable\n\nplea of joint possession, the respondent does not at all contest that the\n\nrespondent is not operating and managing the plant. In fact the entire\n\nargument of Mr. Khambata is that it is imperative for the respondents to\n\nmanage and operate the plant so that it becomes beneficial to the\n\nrespondent and the respondent does not suffer any loss. This apart, all\n\nthe intervenors have also supported Mr. Khambata in his contention that\n\nthe respondents need to operate and manage the plant, so that the\n\ninterest of thousands of stakeholders as alleged by the intervenors also\n\nstands protected.\n\n110. In my opinion, it is unheard of in a civilized society and much less\n\nin a commercial transaction of such magnitude that when the parties\n\nhave agreed to specific terms and conditions on transfer of assets, it\n\nwould become permissible for a contracting party like the respondent to\n\ntake over the assets/co-gen plant of the petitioner, for pure commercial\n\ngains, in a manner unknown to the process of law. Even in commercial\n\ntransactions the parties are bound by the rule of law, apart from due\n\nadherence to the principles of trust, honesty, fairness and ethics, which\nPVR 118 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nare the backbone of any long commercial relation between the parties.\n\nAny untoward dent to such commercial relationship at the hands of a\n\ncontracting party would lead to an instability not conducive to\n\ncommerce and the commercial image of a contracting party. There is all\n\nthe likelihood that for quick and undeserving gains or profits, a party\n\nmay resort to such business tactics and unfair practices, however, in\n\ndoing so, they are oblivious that in the longer run, it is no real\n\ncommercial gain when it comes to such actions being tested in law.\n\nThis, even assuming that the respondent has spent amounts on repairing\n\nor maintenance of the plant as alleged by the petitioner, which would\n\nentitle the respondent only to make a monetary claim against the\n\npetitioner.\n\n111. On the above conspectus, it needs to be stated that the entire\n\nconduct of the respondent is steered towards an early takeover of the co-\n\ngen plant from the petitioner, than the agreed asset transfer date, which\n\nwould be 30 June, 2041, as gathered from the record and the arguments\n\nadvanced on behalf of the respondent. Such is the entire intention and\n\nobject which is sought to be achieved by the respondent. This, more\n\nparticularly, by exploiting and/or taking undue advantage of the\n\npetitioner running into financial difficulties on the project in question,\n\nwhich also prima facie is not solely attributable to the petitioner.\n\n112. In fact, prima facie, it is quite apparent that there is a systematic\n\ncommercial modus operandi on the part of the respondent to take over\nPVR 119 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthe co-gen plant. This firstly, by permitting the petitioner to set up the\n\nco-gen plant for which the petitioner incurred substantial expenditure of\n\nRs.274 crores by borrowing funds fully to the knowledge of the\n\nrespondent, and thereafter by not supplying the agreed amount of\n\nbagasse and biogas, the basic raw-material for generation of power and\n\nsteam, thereby depriving the petitioner of a normal functioning of the\n\nplant to recoup its investments and earn profits. Added to this was the\n\ndismantling of biogas pipeline and using it for the captive generation\n\nfacility, which was a clear indication that there was no intention to\n\nsupply biogas thereby crippling the petitioner. All such actions which\n\nappear to be systematically planned, have resulted in serious financial\n\ndifficulties for the petitioner, which also caused the petitioner's account\n\nto be a non-performing asset, and thereafter, when the petitioner found\n\nitself in such financial distress, the respondent by adopting coercive\n\nmethods, as noted above has attempted to take over the co-gen plant.\n\nAs if this was not enough, the respondent appears to have used its local\n\ninfluences to pressurize the petitioner by making Trade Unions of\n\nfarmers and workers to stand against the petitioner, not only before\n\ndifferent authorities but also before this Court, in the present\n\nproceedings to canvass the case of the respondent, so as to succeed in its\n\nattempts to take over the co-gen plant. This more particularly, as if the\n\nco-gen plant to be operated by the respondent is so very imperative, that\nPVR 120 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthe respondent's sugar factory was earlier never run on the electricity\n\nreceived from other sources.\n\n113. Hence, I am in complete agreement with Mr. Andhyarujina when\n\nhe submits that such was the sinister scheme of the respondent to take\n\nover the operation and management of the co-gen plant. It may be\n\nobserved that this is a classic case where the Cooperative Sugar Factory\n\nstated to be of repute, is not only acting by taking law into its hands, in\n\nbrazen breach of the terms and conditions of the PDA, but also\n\ncompletely oblivious to the rule of law as noted above. No contracting\n\nparty howsoever mighty, is permitted to take law into its hands and act\n\nin a manner which would deprive the other contracting party (in the\n\npresent case the petitioner) of its valuable assets and entitlement to its\n\nproperty, enjoyment of which is required to be reckoned as a guarantee\n\nunder law.\n\n114. If the conduct of the respondent was to be bonafide, there are\n\ncategorical conditions under the PDA which would permit the\n\nrespondent to take a fair position and terminate the contract in a\n\nmanner as agreed between the parties. This is exactly what the\n\nrespondent has intended to avoid, inasmuch as, the procedure of\n\ntermination as agreed between the parties is considered by the\n\nrespondent to be not beneficial to its commercial interest, because if the\n\nrespondent intends to take over the co-gen plant, then necessarily a\nPVR 121 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nvaluation of the plant at the fair market value on the date of termination\n\nwould be required to be ascertained. It is for such reason, a calculated\n\nshortcut of the nature as pleaded by the petitioner was conceived by the\n\nrespondent, so that the petitioner is suffocated and choked not only\n\nfinancially but also insofar as its valuable assets are concerned. In my\n\nopinion, there cannot be a better case where the demand for justice as in\n\nthe present petition, would require the Court to interfere and by\n\nrecognizing the justice in the case grant appropriate interim reliefs.\n\n115. The other contention of Mr. Khambata, relying on the proceedings\n\nbefore the DRT at New Delhi and Aurangabad is on the financial distress\n\nof the petitioner. Mr. Khambata, referring to the proceedings before the\n\nDRT - Delhi, as also referring to the proceedings before the DRT at\n\nAurangabad, has contended that the petitioner is a defaulter in making\n\npayments of the loans obtained from the Central Bank of India and the\n\nUnion Bank of India, and that the banks have accordingly proceeded\n\nagainst the petitioner in the said proceedings before the DRT at New\n\nDelhi. He has referred to the order dated 15 February, 2022 in the\n\nproceedings of the DRT-II, Delhi in O.A. No.69 of 2022 filed by the\n\nCentral Bank of India and others whereby the DRT has directed status-\n\nquo to be granted in the following terms:-\n\n\"Defendants to maintain status quo in respect of assets as per\nsection 19\nsub-\nsection 4(A) of The Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act 1993.\nList the matter on 25.03.2022 for further proceedings.\"\n\nPVR 122 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n116. A perusal of the above order passed by the learned Presiding\n\nOfficer of the DRT, Delhi would clearly indicate that it is an order ex-\n\nparte to the petitioner. Secondly, such order has been obtained by the\n\nbank accepting the contentions of the respondent who were impleaded\n\nas defendant no.2 in the said proceedings who submitted before the said\n\nDRT that since more than two years (prior to the said order), it was the\n\nrespondent which was running the co-gen plant on a premise that the\n\npetitioner was not interested in doing so and the day-to-day operations\n\nwere being handled by the respondent. The respondent also contended\n\nbefore the DRT that the petitioner (defendant no.1) was interested in\n\nsiphoning of funds and that the respondent is in possession of the plant\n\nand running the same. The observations as made by the tribunal for\n\nconvenience are required to be re-noted which read thus:-\n\n\"The present situation is that Defendant no. 2 submits that since more\nthan two years they are running the plant as Defendant no 1 was not\ninterested in doing so and all day today operations are handled by\nthem though few employees of Defendant no. 1 are still there but all\nsalaries/maintenance and compliance of all statutory obligations are\ndone by them and they face difficulty as defendant no. 1 is interested\nin syphoning of funds and not running the plant. They submit that\nPDA is sacrosanct and all obligations under it have to be complied and\nthey have first right over the same, they also submit that they are\ninterested in purchasing the plant and have approached the Bank who\nhave sought a concrete proposal and shortly that will be submitting.\nThey further submit that the plant cannot be closed as lively hood of\nmore than one lakh family is dependent upon it besides various\ncommitments of Defendant no 3. The material for plant comes from\nsugar factories and as such it is complete circle and all are dependent\non each other and slightest disturbance may bring every thing to halt\nwhich will not be a welcome situation for any body and for the\neconomy of state and country.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nPVR 123 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n117. From the reading of the above order passed by the DRT, it is ex-\n\nfacie clear that the stand of the respondent as taken before this Court, is\n\nfar from honest to say the least, for the reason, that on oath the\n\nrespondent has taken a stand in paragraph 22 of the reply affidavit, that\n\nthe respondent is in \"joint possession\" of the co-gen plant with the\n\npetitioner. However, before the DRT, Delhi, it has been clearly pleaded\n\nas alo categorically observed by the DRT, that it is the respondent who is\n\nin possession of the plant and running the same. It is thus not the case\n\nthat when the second reply affidavit dated 19 February, 2022 was filed\n\nby the respondent before this Court, the respondent was not aware\n\nabout the stand taken by it earlier and as recorded in the order dated 15\n\nFebruary, 2022 passed by the DRT, Delhi, nonetheless the argument of\n\njoint possession was canvassed with perseverance. Thus, the respondent\n\nclearly appears to have taken a stand as it suits its convenience before\n\ndifferent forums for the reason which according to the petitioner are\n\nquite apparent. Mr. Andhyarujina would be correct to contend that even\n\nassuming that the petitioner was in financial difficulties, it does not\n\nmean that the respondent, without espousing remedies available to it in\n\nlaw, would maneuver things in such manner that the petitioner is left\n\ndefending proceedings, the genesis of which is breaches on the\n\nrespondent's part. It is clear from the reading of the orders passed by\n\nboth the DRT's that it is at the instance of the respondent the\nPVR 124 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nobservations against the petitioner as noted above have been made and\n\nthat too ex-parte to the petitioner.\n\n118. Before the DRT, Delhi proceedings, the respondent had also\n\nmoved an application before the DRT at Aurangabad under\nSection 17\n\nof the SARFAESI Act on the purported apprehension that the banks from\n\nwhom the petitioner had taken loans, may initiate an action against the\n\npetitioner's co-gen plant for recovery of the amounts payable to these\n\nbanks and which may cause a prejudice to the respondent. On such\n\napplication, on 29 December, 2021, the DRT at Aurangabad passed an\n\norder directing that no status-quo can be granted on the securitisation\n\nproceedings and permitted the respondent to discuss and settle the\n\ndisputes with the bank and to take the co-gen plant under its wing,\n\nunder a private treaty at the market value. For convenience the relevant\n\nextract of the said orders in this context can be re-noted as under:-\n\n\"\n\nF. No status-quo order can be granted on the securitisation proceedings\nas such. However, the applicant will be at liberty to discuss and settle with the\nrespondent bank and take the co-gent plant under its wing under the private\ntreaty at the market value. If that does not get through then the respondent\nbank i.e. respondent no. 1 shall be at liberty to put the property at auction\nwithin the four corners of the project development agreement PDA clearly\nmentioning that the auction is with all terms and conditions to be complied of\nthe project development agreement PDA i.e. all rights and liabilities and\ncompliances under PDA will be the responsibility of purchaser and the plant\nhas to be kept running. The Bank can also decide to give on lease the running\nof plant to recover its dues.\n\nG. The Project Development Agreement PDA shall be made part of such\nauction notice.\n\nH. The Respondent No.4 Maharashtra State Electricity Board is hereby\ndirected that it not to remit any amount to the respondent no.3, the borrower,\nand if any amount is to be remitted it should be remitted to respondent no.1\nwho shall adjust the amount in the liability of the borrower.\n\nPVR 125 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nI. Since the co-gent plant is being possessed and run by the applicant\n\nnow such a position shall not be disturbed by any of the parties till further\norder except as per law.\"\n\n119. Thus, prima facie the respondent's plan appears to be crystal clear,\n\nfirst, make the petitioner invest large sums of about Rs. 274 Crs to set up\n\nthe plant which includes large borrowings from the banks. Secondly,\n\nsuffocate the petitioner by non-supply of materials (bagasse and bio-gas)\n\nso that once the plant is not run optimally the petitioners would bleed\n\nfinancially. This situation was achieved by the respondent in 2017 when\n\nthe petitioner's account was classified as NPA. Thirdly, interfere in the\n\nrunning of the plant with an intention to take over the plant. Fourthly,\n\nattempt a total ouster of the petitioner from the co-gen plant and lastly,\n\ncreate circumstances conducive for a distress sale of the co-gen plant for\n\nwhich already negotiations are sought to be commenced by the\n\nrespondent with the banks as seen from both the orders of the DRT so as\n\nto have wind fall gains.\n\n120. It is thus clear from the orders passed by both the DRTs that the\n\nrespondent has expressed before the DRT that the respondent is\n\ninterested in purchasing the plant and for which the respondent has\n\nalready approached the bank which has sought a concrete proposal.\n\nThe respondent's intention is to ultimately take over the co-gen plant\n\nprematurely and not in a manner as agreed between the parties in the\n\nPDA as per the fair market value. It is for such reason the respondent\nPVR 126 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nhas not left a single stone unturned to takeover the co-gen plant, so that\n\nit forms an integral part of the respondent's sugar factory. No other\n\nintention can be culled out.\n\n121. For the above reasons, in my opinion, it is totally untenable for the\n\nrespondent to put up a case relying on the orders passed by the DRT\n\nand/or canvassing a case of financial distress of the petitioner to its\n\nadvantage in the present circumstances. The respondent instead of\n\ngiving a proposal to the bank could have invoked the conditions of the\n\nagreement (PDA) and given a proposal to the petitioner, however, such\n\ncourse of action does not appear to be profitable to the respondent. It is\n\nthus clear that the intention of the respondent is to defy and run away\n\nfrom the binding terms and conditions of the PDA and in the manner\n\nunknown to what was agreed between the parties, in order to take over\n\nthe assets of the co-gen plant.\n\n122. In so far as Mr. Khambata's contention relying on the provisions of\n\nSection 16(b)\nand (c) of the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963\nis concerned, that\n\nan order of an interim relief as prayed for cannot be made in favour of\n\nthe petitioner in the facts of the case, is not well founded. Such\n\nargument proceeds on the assumption that in the substantive\n\nproceedings that the petitioner may initiate before the arbitral tribunal,\n\nit would be praying only for a relief of specific performance and nothing\n\nelse. This is plainly a surmise at this stage of the proceedings to\nPVR 127 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\npresume applicability of\nSection 16\nof the Specific Relief Act. Also, these\n\nare proceedings where the petitioner has prayed for interim measures\n\npending the arbitral proceedings in which the concern of the Court\n\nwould be to protect the arbitral interest of the parties and protect the\n\nsubject matter of the arbitration. The Court is certainly not precluded\n\nfrom considering the prayers made for interim measures when the\n\nproceedings are at a pre-arbitral stage, and in which the petitioner has\n\nasserted a case of several breaches on the part of the respondent, which\n\nare ex-facie apparent and which may damage the arbitral interest of the\n\npetitioner as also the subject matter of the arbitration, namely the co-\n\ngen plant. Thus, it is difficult to accept the contention as urged by Mr.\n\nKhambata referring to\nSection 16(b)\nand (c) of the\nSpecific Relief Act\n,\n\nthat the Court cannot consider the prayers as made by the petitioner\n\nseeking an interim injunction. In any event, even assuming Mr.Khambata\n\nis right in his contention that\nsection 16 (b)\nis attracted, in the facts of\n\nthe case, it is prima facie clear that it is the respondent who has acted in\n\nbreach of the essential terms of the contract by its short supply of\n\nbagasse and bio gas right from the crushing season of 2015-16. It is\n\nthus only an unsubstantiated plea on the part of the respondent that the\n\npetitioner has become incapable of performing the contract. In fact, the\n\npetitioner has clearly asserted its willingness to conduct the Co-gen\n\nplant under the contract PDA which has reciprocal promises. The basic\n\nconditions which the Court would weigh in applying the provisions of\nPVR 128 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nSection 16(b)\nand (c) of the\nSpecific Relief Act\nis certainly absent in the\n\npresent proceedings. Thus in the facts of the case, the respondent's\n\ncontention relying on such provisions of the\nSpecific Relief Act\n, in\n\nopposing the interim measures is certainly not tenable.\n\n123. In so far as Mr. Khambata's contention relying on\nSection 41(ha)\n\nof the Specific Relief Act is concerned, the same is not well founded, for\n\nthe reason that the co-gen plant is in a working condition, which is\n\nbeing used for the purpose of the respondent's sugar factory. In any\n\nevent, the relief as prayed for by the petitioner is not a relief which\n\nwould in any manner stop the working of the plant, which can continue\n\nto run in the same manner in the petitioner's hands, as per the terms of\n\nthe PDA. The respondent cannot take a position that when the\n\npetitioners would conduct the plant the respondent would not supply\n\nthe bagasse and the bio gas and when the respondent would run the\n\nplant on its own, all such materials would be available. This for the\n\nreason, that when the respondent at the relevant time was running the\n\nco-gen plant under the second supplementary agreement, the\n\nrespondent had not stated that the respondent was running the plant\n\nonly on the coal being purchased from outside sources, and no bagasse\n\nand bio-gas generated from the respondents sugar factory was used.\n\n124. In so far as the respondent's contention that the relief as prayed\n\nfor by the petitioner would amount to granting a relief of an interim\nPVR 129 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nmandatory injunction, which ought not to be granted under\nSection 9\nof\n\nthe Act also cannot be accepted even assuming that the relief being\n\ngranted is of such nature.\nSection 9\nconfers powers on the court to grant\n\ninterim measures which would certainly include a power to grant an\n\ninterim mandatory injunction pending the arbitral proceedings. The\n\npowers of the Court under\nSection 9\nare not different from the powers\n\nof a Civil Court to grant reliefs of a temporary injunction even in a\n\nmandatory form when a strong prima facie case of a high standard is\n\nmade out by a party seeking such relief, coupled with the balance of\n\nconvenience as also a case of irreparable injury, which cannot be\n\ncompensated in monetary terms, being made out. Mr. Khambata in\n\nsupporting his contention that no case has been made out by the\n\npetitioner for any relief for an interim mandatory injunction has relied\n\non the decision of the Supreme Court in\nDorab Cawasji Warden vs\n\nCoomi Sorab Warden & Ors.7\n.\n\n125. To examine the respondent's contention on the issue of an interim\n\nmandatory injunction, the peculiarity of the facts in the present context\n\nis required to be noted. As observed above, this petition came to be filed\n\non 12 October, 2021 praying for interim measures inter alia of the\n\ndirections to the respondent not to interfere in the conduct of the co-gen\n\nplant by the petitioners. Thus, the factual status at the time the petition\n\nwas filed was certainly that the petitioner was operating and managing\n\n7 1990 AIR 867\nPVR 130 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nthe plant. However, as categorically contended on behalf of the\n\npetitioners, after filing of the petition and upto 26 October, 2021, the\n\nrespondent attempted to change the status quo and are now prohibiting\n\nthe petitioner and/or its representative, officers from conducting the co-\n\ngen plant. Thus, the situation is that the respondent is intending to take\n\nover the control of the co-gen plant by restraining the petitioner's entry\n\nto the co-gen plant. The respondent is absolutely conscious of this\n\nposition, and in fact it has conceded that it is controlling the co-gen\n\nplant to the exclusion of the petitioner. In my view, in a situation of\n\nsuch nature, certainly the Court is not powerless to pass an interim\n\nmandatory order directing the respondent to cease itself from entering\n\nand conducting the co-gen plant. It cannot be conceived that with open\n\neyes, the Court would notice illegality of the respondent and yet be not\n\nable to grant a relief, which the facts of the case and interest of justice\n\nwould warrant.\n\n126. The present case is clearly a case where withholding of such a\n\nrelief would prick the conscience of the Court. There are certainly\n\nstrong circumstances which would warrant the Court to protect the\n\narbitral interest of the parties and the subject matter of the arbitration,\n\npending the arbitral proceedings. There is substantial prima facie\n\nmaterial on record which would justify that the status quo has been\n\nattempted to be altered by the respondent and hence it has become\n\nimperative in such case to pass interim orders which can even be of a\nPVR 131 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nmandatory nature. The following position in law in such context, which\n\nhas guided the Courts to grant interim mandatory injunction, is well\n\nsettled and would aid the said conclusion.\n\n127.\nIn\nBaban Narayan Landge vs. Mahadu Bhikaji Tonchar & Ors.\n,\n\n1989 Mh. L.J. 146, a learned Single Judge of this Court referring to an\n\nearlier decision of this Court in\nChampsey Bhimji and Co. vs. Jamna\n\nFlour Mills Co. Ltd.\n, AIR 1914 Bom.\n195 and in Manoharlal vs. Seth\n\nHiralal, AIR 1962 SC 527, held that injunctions are a form of equitable\n\nrelief and they have to be adjusted or moulded in aid of equity and\n\njustice to the facts and circumstances of each particular case. The Court\n\nobserved thus:\n\n\"The subject of temporary injunction is mainly covered by Order 39,\nRules 1 and 2,\nCode of Civil Procedure\n. In cases not covered by those\nprovisions, an appropriate temporary injunction can be granted also in\nexercise of inherent power of a Court under\nS. 151\n, Code of Civil\nProcedure. After all Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 are not exhaustive of the\ncircumstances under which interim injunction can be granted. The\ncontroversy on that aspect of the matter is set at rest by a majority\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the leading case of Manoharlal v. Seth\nHiralal, AIR 1962 SC 527. But that apart the language employed in\nthose two Rules is clearly wide enough to include an order in the form\nof a mandatory injunction and admits of no exception with reference to\na point of time to which it can be made. Injunctions are a form of\nequitable relief and they have to be adjusted or moulded in aid of equity\nand justice to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\nJurisdiction is thus undoubted even under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2.\nEven if it cannot be granted under the said Rules, Section 151 is the\nsource of such jurisdiction. I see no reason to lay down an absolute\nproposition and forge unnecessary and unjustified fetters on the power\nof the equity Courts to grant appropriate relief even in a well deserving\ncase and reduce its position only to a willing but helpless spectator - a\nsituation not warranted by our equity jurisprudence.\"\n\n128.\nIn a recent decision of the Supreme Court in\nSamir Narain\n\nBhojwani vs. Aurora Properties and Investments and Anr.\n, (2018) 17\nPVR 132 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nSCC 203 referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in\nDorab\n\nCawasji Warden vs. Coomi Sorab Warden\n, (1990) 2 SCC 117, the\n\nSupreme Court has reaffirmed the law as\nlaid down in\nthe latter decision\n\nto hold that the relief of interlocutory mandatory injunction is granted\n\ngenerally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last non-contested\n\nstatus which preceded the pending controversy until the final hearing at\n\nwhich a full relief may be granted or to compel the undoing of those\n\nacts, that have been illegally done or the restoration of that, which was\n\nwrongfully taken from the party complaining. It is held that when a\n\nstrong prima facie case is made out, coupled with a case that if such an\n\ninterim mandatory relief is not granted, irreparable or serious injury\n\nwhich cannot be compensated in terms of money may be suffered by the\n\napplicant and when the balance of convenience is in favour of the party\n\nseeking such a relief, then in such situation certainly the Court would\n\ncome to the aid to the party seeking the status quo ante. It was also\n\nrecognized that the Court in passing such an order of interlocutory\n\nmandatory injunction would exercises a sound judicial discretion in the\n\nlight of the facts and circumstances of the case. The observations of the\n\nSupreme Court in paragraphs 24 to 26 can be noted, which reads thus:\n\n24. That apart, the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench have\ncommitted fundamental error in applying the principle of moulding of relief\nwhich could at best be resorted to at the time of consideration of final relief\nin the main suit and not at an interlocutory stage. The nature of order\npassed against the appellant is undeniably a mandatory order at an\ninterlocutory stage. There is marked distinction between moulding of relief\nand granting mandatory relief at an interlocutory stage. As regards the\nlatter, that can be granted only to restore the status quo and not to establish\na new set of things differing from the state which existed at the date when\nthe suit was instituted. This Court in Dorab Cawasji Warden Versus Coomi\nPVR 133 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nSorab Warden (1990) 2 SCC 117, has had occasion to consider the\ncircumstances warranting grant of interlocutory mandatory injunction. In\nparagraphs 16 & 17, after analysing the legal precedents on the point as\nnoticed in paragraphs 11-15, the Court went on to observe as follows: (SCC\npp. 126-27)\n\"16. The relief of interlocutory mandatory injunctions\nare thus granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo\nof the last non-contested status which preceded the pending\ncontroversy until the final hearing when full relief may be\ngranted or to compel the undoing of those acts that have been\nillegally done or the restoration of that which was wrongfully\ntaken from the party complaining. But since the granting of\nsuch an injunction to a party who fails or would fail to establish\nhis right at the trial may cause great injustice or irreparable\nharm to the party against whom it was granted or alternatively\nnot granting of it to a party who succeeds or would succeed\nmay equally cause great injustice or irreparable harm, courts\nhave evolved certain guidelines. Generally stated these\nguidelines are:\n\n(1) The plaintiff has a strong case for trial. That is, it\nshall be of a higher standard than a prima facie case that is\nnormally required for a prohibitory injunction.\n\n(2) It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury\nwhich normally cannot be compensated in terms of money.\n\n(3) The balance of convenience is in favour of the one\nseeking such relief.\n\n17. Being essentially an equitable relief the grant or refusal of\nan interlocutory mandatory injunction shall ultimately rest in\nthe sound judicial discretion of the court to be exercised in the\nlight of the facts and circumstances in each case. Though the\nabove guidelines are neither exhaustive nor complete or\nabsolute rules, and there may be exceptional circumstances\nneeding action, applying them as prerequisite for the grant or\nrefusal of such injunctions would be a sound exercise of a\njudicial discretion.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n25. The Court, amongst others, rested its exposition on the dictum in\nHalsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition, Volume 24, paragraph 948, which\nreads thus:\n\n\"948. Mandatory injunctions on interlocutory applications.- A\nmandatory injunction can be granted on an interlocutory\napplication as well as at the hearing, but, in the absence of\nspecial circumstances, it will not normally be granted. However,\nif the case is clear and one which the court thinks ought to be\ndecided at once, or if the act done is a simple and summary one\nwhich can be easily remedied, or if the defendant attempts to\nsteal a march on the plaintiff, such as where, on receipt of\nnotice that an injunction is about to be applied for, the\ndefendant hurries on the work in respect of which complaint is\nPVR 134 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nmade so that when he receives notice of an interim injunction it\nis completed, a mandatory injunction will be granted on an\ninterlocutory application.\"\n\n26. The principle expounded in this decision has been consistently\nfollowed by this Court. It is well established that an interim mandatory\ninjunction is not a remedy that is easily granted. It is an order that is passed\nonly in circumstances which are clear and the prima facie material clearly\njustify a finding that the status quo has been altered by one of the parties to\nthe litigation and the interests of justice demanded that the status quo ante\nbe restored by way of an interim mandatory injunction. (See Metro Marins\nVersus Bonus Watch Co. (P) Ltd., (2004) 7 SCC 478, Kishore Kumar Khaitan\nVersus Praveen Kumar Singh (2006) 3 SCC 312 and Purshottam Vishandas\nRaheja Versus Shrichand Vishandas Raheja (2011) 6 SCC 73 : (2011) 3 SCC\n(Civ) 204.\n\n129.\nIn\nHammad Ahmed vs. Abdul Majeed & Ors.\n, (2019) 14 SCC 1,\n\nthe Supreme Court has reiterated the principles as\nlaid down in\n\nDorab\n\nCawasji Warden\n(supra) and\nSamir Narain Bhojwani\n(supra) to hold\n\nthat ad-interim mandatory injunction can be granted when strong\n\ncircumstances are present so as to protect the rights and interest of the\n\nparties. The Court in pararagraph 58 observed that:\n\n\"58. The ad interim mandatory injunction, is to be granted not at the\nasking but on strong circumstance so that to protect the rights and interest\nof the parties so as not to frustrate their rights regarding mandatory\ninjunction.\nIn\nDeoraj vs. State of Maharashtra and Others\n, (2004) 4 SCC\n697, this Court held that Court would grant such an interim relief only if it\nis satisfied that withholding of it would prick the conscience of the Court\nand do violence to the sense of justice, resulting in injustice being\nperpetuated throughout the hearing, and at the end the Court would not\nbe able to vindicate the cause of justice. Therefore, in appropriate case, ad-\ninterim injunction in mandatory form can be granted. The Court held as\nunder:-\n\n\"12. Situations emerge where the granting of an interim relief\nwould tantamount to granting the final relief itself. And then\nthere may be converse cases where withholding of an interim\nrelief would tantamount to dismissal of the main petition itself;\nfor, by the time the main matter comes up for hearing there\nwould be nothing left to be allowed as relief to the petitioner\nthough all the findings may be in his favour. In such cases the\navailability of a very strong prima facie case -- of a standard\nmuch higher than just prima facie case, the considerations of\nbalance of convenience and irreparable injury forcefully tilting\nthe balance of the case totally in favour of the applicant may\nPVR 135 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\npersuade the court to grant an interim relief though it amounts\nto granting the final relief itself. Of course, such would be rare\nand exceptional cases. The court would grant such an interim\nrelief only if satisfied that withholding of it would prick the\nconscience of the court and do violence to the sense of justice,\nresulting in injustice being perpetuated throughout the hearing,\nand at the end the court would not be able to vindicate the cause\nof justice. Obviously such would be rare cases accompanied by\ncompelling circumstances, where the injury complained of is\nimmediate and pressing and would cause extreme hardship. The\nconduct of the parties shall also have to be seen and the court\nmay put the parties on such terms as may be prudent.\"\n\n130. A useful reference can also be made to the decision of the Division\n\nBench of this Court in\nOmkar Realtors and Developers Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.\n\nvs. Shahveer Padam Kapadia & Ors. (Commercial Appeal (L) No.\nof 2022 dated 30 March, 2022) wherein following the principles of law\n\nas\nlaid down in\n\nHammad Ahmed\n(supra), the Division Bench held as\n\nunder:\n\n\"33. Should the argument be that the impugned order is 'mandatory'\nin nature and, for the reason, vulnerable, we would have hesitation in\nrepelling the submission directly. Such an order, even as an ad-interim\none, and even if described as 'mandatory', is always possible where strong\ncircumstances indicate that the order would protect the rights and interests\nof both sides, and that refusing relief would be unjust :\nHammad Ahmed vs.\nAbdul Majeed\n.\"\n\n131. The above discussion would show that apart from the strong\n\ncircumstances, the petitioner in the present case has certainly made out\n\na strong prima-facie case for the Court to proceed to pass an interim\n\norder which is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury to the\n\npetitioner which cannot compensated in terms of the money even to\n\npass an interim order of mandatory injunction for which the balance of\n\nconvenience is also overwhelmingly in favour of the petitioner.\n\nPVR 136 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\n132. This case would also be required to be considered from the\n\nperspective of an exception being carved out to\nSection 41\n, namely, the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 42\nof the Specific relief Act, which reads thus:\n\n\"42. Injunction to perform negative agreement.--Notwithstanding\nanything contained in clause (e) of\nsection 41\n, where a contract\ncomprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, coupled with a\nnegative agreement, express or implied, not to do a certain act, the\ncircumstances that the court is unable to compel specific performance\nof the affirmative agreement shall not preclude it from granting an\ninjunction to perform the negative agreement: Provided that the\nplaintiff has not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on\nhim.\"\n\n133. This is clearly a case wherein there is an affirmative obligation\n\non the respondent to run the co-gen plant and a negative agreement\n\nunder Clause 28 of the PDA on the respondent whereunder there is an\n\nobligation on the respondent not to obstruct or interfere in the work of\n\nthe petitioner till the subsistence of the PDA. In my opinion, clause\n\n28 in the PDA would be required to be regarded to be a clause of a\n\nsituation which\nSection 42\nwould recognise, to enable the Court to grant\n\nan injunction. This as\nSection 42\nprovides that even if the Court is\n\nunable to compel the specific performance of the affirmative agreement\n\nread with other clauses, it shall not preclude the Court from granting an\n\ninjunction to perform the negative agreement. It is not the case that in\n\nthe peculiar circumstances in hand, the petitioner could be said to have\n\nnot performed the contract, as the present contract was certainly based\n\non reciprocal promises and its mutual performance by both the parties.\n\nIt is infact quite clear that right from the inception of the\nPVR 137 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\ncommencement of operation of the co-gen plant that the respondent has\n\ndefaulted in supplying bagasse and biogas. In these circumstances, also\n\nMr. Khambata's submission relying on\nSection 41(ha)\ncertainly deserves\n\nto be rejected.\n\n134. The above conclusion would stand fortified by referring to the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in\nGujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. & Ors. vs.\n\nCoca Cola Co. & Ors.\n, (1995) 5 SCC 545 wherein the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that\nSection 42\nof the Specific Relief Act would certainly become\n\napplicable where a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a\n\ncertain act coupled with a negative agreement, express or implied, not\n\nto do a certain act, and in such a situation, the circumstances that the\n\ncourt is unable to compel specific performance of the affirmative\n\nagreement shall not preclude the Court from granting an injunction to\n\nperform the negative agreement. The Court in the facts of the case held\n\nthat having regard to the negative covenant contained in the agreement\n\nin question before it (which was subsisting), the respondent therein\n\n(Coca Cola Co.) had made out a prima facie case for grant of an\n\ninjunction. In paragraphs 42 and 43, the Court observed thus:\n\n\"42. In the matter of grant of injunction, the practice in England is\nthat where a contract is negative in nature, or contains an express negative\nstipulation, breach of it may be restrained by injunction and injunction is\nnormally granted as a matter of course, even though the remedy is\nequitable and thus in principle a discretionary one and a defendant cannot\nresist an injunction simply on the ground that observance of the contract is\nburdensome to him and its breach would cause little or no prejudice to the\nplaintiff and that breach of an express negative stipulation can be\nrestrained even though the plaintiff cannot show that the breach will\ncause him any loss. In India\nSection 42\nof the specific\nRelief Act, 1963\n\nprescribes that notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) of\nPVR 138 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nSection 41\n, where a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a\ncertain act coupled with a negative agreement, express or implied, not to\ndo a certain act, the circumstances that the court is unable to compel\nspecific performance of the affirmative agreement shall not preclude it\nfrom granting an injunction to perform the negative agreement. This is\nsubject to the proviso that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the\ncontract so far as it is binding on him. The Court is, however, not bound to\ngrant an injunction in every case and an injunction to enforce a negative\ncovenant would be refused if it would indirectly compel the employee\neither to idleness or to serve the employer.\n\n43. The grant of an interlocutory injunction during the pendency of\nlegal proceedings is a matter requiring the exercise of discretion of the\ncourt. While exercising the discretion the court. While exercising the\ndiscretion the court applies the following tests - (i) whether the plaintiff\nhas a prima facie case; (ii) whether the balance of convenience is in favour\nof the plaintiff; and (iii) whether the plaintiff would suffer an irreparable\ninjury if his prayer for interlocutory injunction is disallowed. The decision\nwhether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction has to be taken at a\ntime when the existence of the legal right assailed by the plaintiff and its\nalleged violation are both contested and uncertain and its alleged violation\nare both contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are\nestablished at the trial on evidence. Relief by way of interlocutory\ninjunction is granted to mitigate the risk of injustice to the plaintiff during\nthe period before that uncertainty could be resolved. The object of the\ninterlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by\nviolation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in\ndamages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his\nfavour at the trial. The need for such protection has, however, to be\nweighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected\nagainst injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his\nown legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The\ncourt must weigh one need against another and determine where the\n'balance of convenience' lies. In order to protect the defendant while\ngranting an interlocutory injunction in his favour the Court can require the\nplaintiff to furnish an undertaking so that the defendant can be adequately\ncompensated if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial.\"\n\n135. The next contention as urged on behalf of the respondent is on\n\nsuppression of facts by the petitioner namely of suppressing its financial\n\nposition in invoking jurisdiction of this Court under\nSection 9\nof the Act.\n\nSuch contention is required to be stated to be rejected. The case on\n\nsuppression as alleged by the respondent of the financial condition of\n\nthe petitioner, is to the effect that proceedings against the petitioner as\nPVR 139 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nadopted by the banks and orders passed thereon are suppressed by the\n\npetitioner. The documents of hypothecation and the document of\n\nIndenture of Mortgage has not been placed on record by the petitioner.\n\nIn my opinion, such charge of suppression as made by the respondent is\n\nwholly untenable inasmuch as the petitioner has already pointed out in\n\nthe petition that an account of default on the part of the respondent in\n\nsupplying the agreed quantity of bagasse and biogas, the petitioner has\n\nsuffered losses, which culminated into the petitioner's account being\n\ncategorized as a Non-Performing Assets (NPA). It is also clear from the\n\nrecord that such a plea of suppression as urged by the respondent is\n\ntotally hollow, as the respondent at all material times right from the\n\ninception was aware that the petitioner had set up the plant after\n\nsubstantial borrowings and that there was already a mortgage as\n\npermitted under the agreement in question as created by the petitioner\n\nfor availing financial facilities from the banks. The record also clearly\n\nshows that the orders dated 29 December, 2021 and 15 February, 2022\n\npassed by the DRT, Aurangabad and by the DRT, Delhi respectively, were\n\npassed ex-parte to the petitioner and in the presence of the respondent,\n\nand in fact accepting the plea of the respondent. Moreover the orders\n\npassed by DRT are post filing of the present proceedings and hence there\n\nare subsequent events which have taken place and are well to the\n\nknowledge of the respondent. Thus, in no manner whatsoever it can be\n\nsaid that the petitioner has suppressed anything of relevance to the\nPVR 140 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\npresent proceedings so as to gain an unfair advantage over the\n\nrespondent. Even otherwise the reliefs which are prayed by the\n\npetitioner are not reliefs which in any manner would affect the rights of\n\nthe lenders to proceed against the petitioner.\n\n136. Coming to the next contention of Mr. Khambata that prejudice\n\nwould be caused to the respondent if any order is passed in favour of the\n\npetitioner, as the respondents have spent substantial amounts on the\n\nmaintenance of co-gen plant also cannot be accepted. This is an\n\nargument of a purported equity. Equity can never override law. Thus\n\nany plea which is intended to eclipse a patent illegality cannot be\n\naccepted. The respondent is attempting to illegally takeover the\n\nmanagement and operation of the plant and that too in a coercive\n\nmanner by preventing the petitioner from legitimately operating the\n\nplant which indisputedly belongs to the petitioner. If this be the case, the\n\nargument of prejudice to the respondent has no legs to stand.\n\nSomething which is of the ownership of the petitioner cannot be taken\n\naway by the respondent except in a manner known to law, even if the\n\ncase of the respondent was that it has purportedly spent amounts for\n\nthe maintenance of the co-gen plant. Thus, to recover such amounts\n\nwhich are claimed to have been spent by the respondent, the only course\n\nopen for the respondent, was to raise a money claim against the\n\npetitioner in a manner known to law. Even otherwise, these are all\n\nmatters of evidence wherein the genuineness of such claims of the\nPVR 141 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nrespondent spending any amounts on the maintenance of the plant\n\nwould be required to be established in the trial before the arbitral\n\ntribunal. Thus, in my opinion, the respondent having spent certain\n\namounts on maintenance etc, can be no argument to deny any relief to\n\nthe petitioner when prima facie the illegality of the respondent, acting in\n\npatent breach of the contractual condition is as clear as the sun light.\n\nIntervention Applications:\n\n137. Insofar as the intervention applications are concerned, there is an\n\nintervention application filed on behalf of employees of the co-gen plant,\n\nwho are employees of the petitioner who have already espoused their\n\ngrievances in regard to non-payment of wages, for a certain period,\n\nbefore the Labour Court at Ahmednagar. Once these applicants have\n\ntaken recourse to the remedy available to them in law which can only be\n\nconfined to their contract of employment, I do not see how their\n\nintervention can be permitted and in any manner would be relevant in\n\nthe present proceedings, and that too in supporting the case of the\n\nrespondent. The only recourse which was available to these workers\n\nwas to adopt appropriate remedy as was available to them in law against\n\nthe petitioner qua their employment, which they have already availed.\n\n138. The position qua the other intervenors who claim to be workers\n\nassociated with the sugar factory or farmers supplying sugarcane to the\n\nrespondent is also not different. They cannot maintain their intervention\nPVR 142 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\napplications in the present proceedings which are filed under\nsection 9\n\nof the Act between parties to the contract (PDA), for the reason that any\n\nplea advanced by these interveners are pleas primarily against the\n\npetitioner on an apprehension of these applicants that the respondent\n\nmay stop the activities of the sugar factory for want of power to be\n\ngenerated by the co-gen plant. However, these interveners cannot be\n\noblivious to the independent rights of the parties to the agreement\n\n(PDA), and contend that dehors such rights of the parties under the\n\nPDA, the co-gen plant ought to be kept operational and that too by the\n\nrespondent and not by the petitioner. Such a plea as urged by these\n\ninterveners is totally untenable. In fact, such plea militates against the\n\nexpress terms and conditions of the PDA as also the Land Lease\n\nAgreement as entered between the petitioner and the respondent. They\n\nhave no privity with the petitioner. They also do not appear to have any\n\nprivity touching the PDA between the petitioner and the respondent. In\n\nany event, the plea as urged in the Intervention Application apart from\n\nbeing merely on apprehension is too remote to be considered as any\n\nsubstantive plea to admit of any intervention of these applicants.\n\n139. It also needs to be observed that it is eminent that the interveners\n\nhave been put up at the behest of the respondent so as to advance an\n\nargument of equity and fortify the position that the running of the co-\n\ngen plant by the respondent is more effective than the petitioner\n\nconducting its own plant. These are the basic arguments which are\nPVR 143 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nurged by Dr. Saraf in supporting the contentions of the respondent. In\n\nmy opinion, it would be too far-fetched for the Court adjudicating the\n\nproceedings under\nsection 9\nof the Act to consider interventions by\n\npersons who are not only alien to the contractual dispute between the\n\npetitioner and the respondent but also remote to the present\n\nproceedings between the contracting parties. For such reasons, none of\n\nthe Intervention Applications can be held to be maintainable.\nIn view of\n\nthe above discussion, Dr. Saraf's reliance on the decision of a learned\n\nSingle Judge of this Court in\nPrabhat Steel Traders Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Excel\n\nMetal Processors Pvt. Ltd.\nis not well founded. The present case is not\n\nsuch where any interim order passed in arbitral proceedings is\n\nprejudicially affecting any third parties like the intervenors. It is also not\n\nthe case that these third parties are likely to be directly affected if the\n\nreliefs as prayed for are granted by the Court. It is also not a case that\n\nthe Court is passing any order against these parties. (Re.: Para. 45 - 46\n\nof\nthe said judgment\n).\n\n140. In view of the above discussion, the petition needs to succeed. The\n\nquestion as posed in paragraph 59 would stand answered in the above\n\nterms.\n\n141. As a sequel, to the above discussion, the petitioner is imminently\n\nentitled to interim reliefs. The petition is accordingly allowed by the\n\nfollowing order:\n\nPVR 144 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nORDER\n\n(i) The petition is allowed in terms of prayer clause (b), which\nreads thus:\n\n\"b. That pending the hearing and final disposal of the\n\narbitral proceedings, making of the arbitral Award and until\nfinal execution of the arbitral Award, this Hon'ble Court be\npleased to restrain the Respondent, its board of directors,\npromoters, partners, employees, agents, representative and any\none acting on behalf of the Respondent, in any manner from\nentering the premises of the Petitioner's Co-generation plant and\nfrom carrying out any work/activity for the repairs/\nmaintenance/ operation of the Petitioner Co-generation plant\"\n\n(ii) The parties are directed to commence the arbitral\nproceedings within a period of one month from today.\n\n142. Before parting, the conduct of the respondent in the present\n\nproceedings is required to be commented. Despite filing an affidavit in\n\nreply dated 21 November, 2021, the respondent under the garb of\n\nrejoinder, filed a further affidavit in reply dated 15 February, 2022\n\npeculiarly titled as \"Affidavit in reply on behalf of respondent to the\n\npetition dated 12 October, 2021 and the rejoinder dated 2 December,\n\n2021 and the Additional Affidavit dated 26 October, 2021 filed by the\n\npetitioner. Further an additional affidavit dated 19 February, 2022, was\n\nsought to be tendered before the Court when it was seriously objected\n\nby Mr. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel for the petitioner. However,\n\nthings did not stop at this. When the hearing of the petition commenced\n\non 21 February, 2022 and when it had remained part-heard on 23\n\nFebruary, 2022 and 24 February, 2022, in the midst of the oral\n\narguments, the respondent to support its pleas intended to place on\nPVR 145 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\nrecord the petitioner's financial documents by a further affidavit, hence\n\nleave of the Court was taken to file further affidavit which for the\n\nreasons are set out in the order dated 25 February, 2022 was granted.\n\nMr. Andhyarujina's objection to the affidavit dated 15 February, 2022\n\nand 19 February, 2022, in my opinion, needs to be accepted considering\n\nthe fairness of the proceedings before the High Court. The respondent\n\ncould not have taken the process of the Court, for granted so as not to\n\nmaintain its sanctity and the procedural discipline and cause a serious\n\nprejudice to the litigant who has knocked the doors of the Court to seek\n\nurgent reliefs, by subverting the proceedings and/or delaying the\n\nproceedings by repeated pleadings possibly to divert the focus of\n\nproceedings. Such attempts of filing successive affidavits that too in the\n\nmidst of hearing of the proceedings also of a nature not permitted by the\n\nCourt, cannot go unnoticed. Such attempt of the respondent is required\n\nto be reprimanded. It cannot be said that no prejudice was caused to\n\nthe petitioner by filing of such affidavits being swung, in the midst of the\n\nhearing, but also the insurmountable inconvenience which was caused\n\nto the Court in adjudicating the present proceedings, was of least\n\nconcern to the respondent. The conduct of the respondent, thus\n\nrequires this Court to pass an order of costs, as such conduct of a litigant\n\nand that too in commercial matters cannot be accepted. The\n\nrespondents are accordingly directed to deposit costs of Rs.2,00,000/-\n\nwith the Dean, J.J. Hospital to be utilized for the terminally ill and the\nPVR 146 CARBPL23525_2021(Pravara).doc\n\npoor Cancer patients which shall be deposited within one week from\n\ntoday.\n\n143. The Petition as also the Interim Application filed by the petitioner\n\naccordingly stands disposed of in the above terms.\n\n144. The interim applications for intervention stand rejected. No costs.\n\n145. At this stage, Mr. Setalvad, learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent prays for stay of this order. However, considering the\n\npeculiar and strong circumstances of the case and the paramount duty of\n\nthe Court to preserve and protect the rule of law, even in the contractual\n\nsphere, a request for stay needs to be rejected. Also there would be no\n\nprejudice whatsoever to the respondent or even for that matter, to the\n\ninterveners who are not even remotely connected with the contractual\n\ndispute between the parties, if the petitioner under its contractual rights\n\noperates and manages its own co-gen plant and/or its assets. In any\n\nevent merely because some time was taken to deliver the judgment,\n\nwhich was on account of the immense pressure of work on the Court, it\n\ncan be no ground to accept Mr.Setalvad's request, when the matter itself\n\nwas argued for days together.\n\n[G.S.
