Deori, District- Durg, M.P. (now Chhattisgarh).\n ---- Appellant\n Versus\n  State of Madhya Pradesh, through the Police Station- Deori,\n District- Durg, M.P.

Present appeal is preferred against the impugned judgment of\nconviction and order of sentence dated 22.07.2000 passed by the\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Balod, District-Durg (C.G.) in Sessions Trial\nNo. 210/1999 whereby, the trial court has convicted and sentenced the\nappellant as under:-\n\n Conviction Sentence\n Under \nSection 306\n of IPC R.I. for 7 years\n\n2. Brief facts of the case are that on 24.02.1999, there was some\nhot talk took place between the appellant/accused and his daughter-in-\nlaw- Laxmi Bai (deceased) on account of that deceased was not\ncooking the food. It is alleged by the prosecution that on account of\naltercation took place between the appellant and the deceased,\ndeceased poured kerosene on her and setting herself ablaze.\nThereafter, she was taken to Dondilohara hospital by her husband\n\n 2\n\nKamlesh (P.W.-2) and his father Kalyan Singh (P.W.-1). Bhikam Lal\n(PW-5) has lodged the report (Ex.P/7) at Police Station. Dr. S.S.\nDevdas (PW-8) has examined the deceased and found 100% burn\ninjury. Y.R. Tumrame (P.W.-4) has recorded the dying declaration of the\ndeceased vide Ex.P/6 and another dying declaration Ex.P/9 was\nrecorded by Dr. S.S. Devdas (P.W.-8), thereafter, he has referred the\ndeceased to district hospital, Durg for further treatment. Husband of the\ndeceased Kamlesh (P.W.-2) took his wife- Laxmi Bai (deceased), to\nRajnandgoan hospital where she has died during the course of the\ntreatment. At about 7:00, P.M., merg intimation was given at Police\nStation- Basantpur. G.P. Choudhary, Additional Tehsildar went to the\nhospital and prepared Laash Panchnama Ex.P-4. Dr. Smt. S. Khare\n(P.W.-15) performed the post-mortem of the deceased along with Dr.\nRajesh Sharma. After completion of the investigation, charge-sheet\nwas filed against her and charges were framed under \nSection 306\n of\nIPC.\n\n3. So as to hold the accused/appellant guilty, the prosecution has\nexamined as many as 16 witnesses to prove its case and statement of\nthe accused/appellant was also recorded under \nSection 313\n of the\nCr.P.C. in which she denied the charges levelled against her and\npleaded her innocence and false implication in the case.\n\n4. On the basis of oral and documentary evidence, trial court has\nconvicted the appellant for the offence punishable under \nSection 306\n of\nIPC, and sentenced her as mentioned in para 1. Hence, this appeal\nfiled by the appellant.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the learned court\nbelow has erred in law and also in facts while convicting the appellant\nunder \nSection 306\n of IPC. None of the prosecution witnesses have\nsupported the case of the prosecution as far as the allegation for\nabetment to commit suicide is concerned and the material available on\nrecord does not make a case punishable under \nSection 306\n of IPC.\nDying declaration is also recorded by PW-4 and PW-8 and also suffers\nfrom serious doubts and cannot be relied upon. On perusal of the\n\n 3\n\nmedical examination of the deceased, it is clear that she had suffered\n100% burn injuries and her pulse rate was 20 per minute and at such\ncircumstances, the dying declaration could not have been recorded,\ntherefore, the learned court below ought to have concerned that the\ndeceased was not in a fit state of mind to have given the so called\ndying declaration. Not a single witness has stated against the appellant\nwhich shows that she in any manner, has abetted the deceased to\ncommit suicide, therefore, the conviction of the appellant is liable to be\nset aside. \nIn support of his argument, learned counsel for the appellant\nhas placed reliance on the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in the matter of \nVelladurai v. State\n represented by the\nInspector of Police reported in AIR 2021 SCC Online SC 715.\n\n6. Learned State counsel has supported the impugned judgment of\nconviction and order of sentence passed by the learned trial Court.\n\n7. Heard counsel for the parties and perused the material available\non record.\n\n8. Kalyan Singh (PW-1) has stated that he does not know why\nLaxmi Bai has committed suicide and husband of the deceased i.e.\nKamlesh (P.W.-2) has also stated that after 10 months of marriage,\nwithout any reason, his wife has committed suicide by pouring\nkerosene.\n\n9. Y.R. Tumrame (PW-4) has stated that he has recorded the dying\ndeclaration of the deceased vide Ex.P/6 in which she has stated that,\n\n \"vkt fnukad 24&2&99 dks lqcg 8 cts ?kj esa dksbZ ugh Fkk rks eS vius cnu ij\n feV~Vh rsy Mkydj [kqn vkx yxkbZ gwW esjs ifjokj ds fdlh Hkh lnL; esjs Åij vkx ugh\n yxkbZ gS eSa Loa; vius mij feV~Vh rsy Mkydj ekfpl dh rhyh ls vkx yxkbZ gwW vkt\n lqcg 24&2&99 dks 7 vkSj 8 cts ds chp esjs lkl ls fookn gqvk xkscj Fkksius ds uke ij\n fookn gqvkA xkscj Fkksi dj vkdj rqe [kkuk ugh cuk jgh gks djds fookn gqvk ckrks\n &ckrks esa fookn gqvk lkl us fdlh Hkh gfFk;kj ls okj ugha fd;kA\n\n 'kknh ds ckn ls vkt fnukad rd esjs ifr ;k esjs lkl ls fookn ugh gqvk FkkA vkt\n gh lqcg esjs lkl ls fookn gqvk blh ds ckn eSusa Loa; vius 'kjhj ij vkx yxk yhA\n eSa ;g c;ku fcuk fdlh ncko ds ns jgh gwW tks lR; gS A \"\n\n10. Dr. S.S. Devdas (PW-8) has also stated that in her dying\n\n 4\n\ndeclaration, Laxmi Bai (deceased) has also stated that,\n\n \" Between 7.00 - 8.00 A.M., there was a dispute with her mother-in-law\n over the application of cow dung. Thereafter, quarrel took place\n between them, on which she herself put kerosene and setting her\n ablaze.\"\n\n11. Looking to the statement of the witnesses and dying declaration\nvide Ex. P/6 & Ex. P/9, it is clear that before the date of incident,\nrelation of the appellant and deceased were cordial and on the date of\nincident, quarrel took place for not cooking the food.\n\n \nSection 306\n of IPC reads as under:-\n\n Abetment of suicide.--If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the\n commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of\n either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall\n also be liable to fine.\n\n \nSection 107\n of IPC reads as under:-\n\n Abetment of a thing.--A person abets the doing of a thing, who--\n (First) -- Instigates any person to do that thing; or\n (Secondly) --Engages with one or more other person or persons in any\n conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes\n place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that\n thing; or\n (Thirdly) -- Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of\n that thing.\n\n12. Looking to the statement of all witnesses and dying declarations\nvide Ex.P/6 & Ex. P/9, abetment of any manner by the appellant under\n\nSection 107\n of IPC is not proved.\n\n13. Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of \nVelladurai Vs. State\n (2021\nSCC Online SC 715) has held that in para 14 is as under:-\n\n \"Now so far as the offence under \nSection 306\n IPC is concerned, in a case\n where if any person instigates other person to commit suicide and as a\n result of such instigation the other person commits suicide, the person\n causing the instigation is liable to be punished for the offence under\n \nSection 306\n IPC for abetting the commission of suicide. Therefore, in order\n to bring a case within the provision of \nSection 306\n IPC, there must be a\n case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the person who\n is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an\n active role by an act of instigating or by doing a certain act to facilitate the\n commission of suicide. As observed and held by this Court in the case of\n Amalendu Pal (supra), mere harassment without any positive action on the\n part of the accused proximate to the time of occurrence which led to the\n suicide would not amount to an offence under \nSection 306\n IPC.\"\n\n14. Therefore, it is clear that abetment by a person is when a person\ninstigate another to do something but in the present case, the\nallegation against the appellant is that there was a quarrel on the date\nof occurrence, there is no other material on record which indicates the\n\n 5\n\n abetment by the appellant. There is no material available on record that\n the appellant/accused has played an active role by an act of instigating\n the deceased to facilitate the commission of suicide.\n\n 15. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and there is\n no other material available on record which indicates the abetment.\n The learned trial court has committed an error in convicting the\n accused/appellant for the offence under \nSection 306\n of IPC.\n\n 16. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the\n present appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment of conviction\n and order of sentence dated 22.07.2000 is hereby set aside. Appellant\n is acquitted of the charge under \nSection 306\n of IPC. She is reported to\n be on bail and her bail bond shall stand discharged.\n\n Sd/-\n\n (Rajani Dubey)\n JUDGE\n\nRuchi",
