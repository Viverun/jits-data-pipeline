Certain proceedings also took place in the\n\nrespondent/University pursuant to the judgment of the Apex\n\nCourt in the case of UMADEVI. The process of regularization\n\nwas sought to be initiated by the University of several daily-wage\n\nand monthly rated employees working in the University. The\n\nUniversity made a proposal for release of block grant from the\n\nhands of the Government towards regularization of 85 employees\n\nwho had completed 10 years of service as on 10-04-2006. The\n\ncommunication was made on 06-08-2007. On receipt of the\n\nsaid letter, the State Government again directed furnishing of\n(2006) 4 SCC 1\ncomplete details regarding expenditure that would be incurred\n\nby the University for the proposed regularization. In reply the\n\nUniversity by its communication dated 14-11-2007 replied\n\nstating that the expenditure for such regularization would be\n\nmade out of regular grants received from Government. While\n\ndoing so the University added 46 employees who were working\n\non daily wages wherein the names of some of the petitioners in\n\nthese petitions also figure. By a communication dated\n\n15.03.2008 the Government accorded its approval for\n\nregularization of 85 persons who had completed 10 years of\n\nservice and not the remaining 46 persons who were included in\n\nthe later communication.\n\n4. The aforesaid action resulted in another communication\n\ndated 08-04-2008 being sent to Government seeking approval of\n\nregularization of 46 employees with 12 more who had completed\n\n10 years of service by then. Pursuant to the approval accorded\n\nby resolution of the Syndicate dated 05-04-2008, 44 daily wage\n\nemployees were regularized by order dated 11-04-2008. On\n06-03-2010 the University again addressed a letter drawing the\n\nattention of Government that there were several sanctioned\n\nposts in the University which needed to be filled up on\n\nimmediate basis and sought approval for regularization of 91\n\npersonnel working in the University who had by that time\n\ncompleted requisite number of years of service for such\n\nregularization. The number was 91 which included the\n\npetitioners in all these petitions. Representations from all these\n\npetitioners were being submitted on regular basis seeking\n\nregularization from the hands of the University. The University,\n\non receipt of such representations, communicated on several\n\noccasions seeking approval for regularization of the services of\n\nthe petitioners in the light of the fact that they had by then\n\ncompleted close to 15 years of service.\n\n5. The State Government did not reply to those\n\ncommunications sent by the University but went on seeking\n\nclarifications with regard to availability of posts and financial\n\nburden. On 23-12-2011 the University brought to the notice of\nGovernment that about 197 posts of Group-D employees were\n\nlying vacant which needed to be filled up in the light of increase\n\nof courses in the University. When no action was taken upon\n\ncorrespondences between Government and the University, the\n\npetitioners along with other similarly situated employees\n\napproached this Court in Writ Petition Nos.35145-35210/2013\n\nseeking a direction to the hands of the University to regularize\n\ntheir services. By then, two other writ petitions were filed for\n\nsimilar reliefs. All the petitions were disposed of by an order\n\ndated 28-04-2015 directing consideration of cases of the\n\npetitioners therein along with other similarly situated employees\n\nin terms of the recommendation made by the University on\n\n08.04.2008.\n\n6. This decision led to certain correspondences between\n\nthe University and the Government. What was projected by the\n\nGovernment was financial burden of close to rupees one crore\n\nthat would come about for regularization of employees which\n\nincluded all the petitioners and the same should be borne out by\nthe University itself and no funds would be allotted by the State\n\nGovernment for regularization. This communication led the\n\nUniversity doing a volte-face. Recommendations for\n\nregularization, communications for approval of regularization\n\nwhich were earlier sent by the University were all given a go-bye\n\nand a direction was issued to the University to take action to\n\nconsider cases of the petitioners under the provisions of the\n\nKarnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012\nand all\n\nother circulars prevailing at the relevant point of time. It is after\n\nthis communication, the University withdrew the earlier\n\nresolution of the Syndicate which had resolved to regularize the\n\nservices of the petitioners on 27.02.2016. It is the aforesaid\n\naction that is called in question in all these writ petitions.\n\nSubmissions of the petitioners:\n\n7. Heard the learned Senior Counsel\n\nSri V.Lakshminarayana appearing for the petitioners in\n\nW.P.No.36565 of 2013; learned counsel Sri D.R.Ravishankar\n\nappearing for the petitioners in W.P.No.9310 of 2016; learned\ncounsel Sri M.S.Bhagwat appearing for petitioners in\n\nW.P.No.62411 of 2016; learned counsel Sri Prithveesh M.K.\n\nappearing for the petitioners in W.P.No.12439 of 2021; learned\n\ncounsel Sri D. Ashwathappa representing the University in all\n\nthese cases and the learned Additional Government Advocate\n\nSmt.M.C.Nagashree appearing for the State.\n\n8. The learned senior counsel Sri V. Lakshminarayana and\n\nall the aforementioned counsel would in unison contend that the\n\npetitioners are entitled to be considered for regularization of\n\ntheir services as the University has not once but close to eight\n\ntimes communicated to the State Government with regard to the\n\nneed of the petitioners and necessity for regularization of the\n\nservices of the petitioners. The learned senior counsel would\n\nfurther submit that identically placed employees who were\n\nappointed as Computer Operators and Computer Programmers\n\non daily wages have been granted the benefit of regularization\n\npursuant to an order passed by this Court in Writ Petition\n\nNo.9959/2011 and on parity seeks that the petitioners also\nought to have been regularized, more so, in the light of the fact\n\nthat the order in Writ Petition No.9959/2011 has been affirmed\n\nby the Division Bench and has attained finality.\n\n9. The other respective learned counsel representing the\n\npetitioners in all the other petitions would submit that the\n\nUniversity having utilized the services of the petitioners for close\n\nto 20 to 24 years cannot now turn its blind eye towards the\n\nclaim of the petitioners for regularization. They would\n\nemphasize on the fact that it is not the University that wants to\n\ndeny the benefit of regularization but the direction of the State\n\nGovernment that the University has to bear financial burden\n\nwhich has led to the denial of such claim of the petitioners.\n\n10. All of them, in unison, would again contend that\n\nfinancial burden can hardly be a circumstance that can deny the\n\npetitioners benefit of regularization of their services that too on\n\nthe direction of the State Government which has no jurisdiction\n\nto interfere with the affairs of the University, as the University is\nan autonomous body which has to take its own decisions in\n\nadministrative matters.\n\nSubmissions of the University:\n\n11. The learned counsel representing the University Sri D.\n\nAshwathappa would vehemently refute all these submissions\n\nand would strenuously contend that the petitioners are all back-\n\ndoor entrants and they are all illegal appointees. Merely because\n\nthey have served the University for over 20 to 24 years, that will\n\nnot give them any benefit of claim for regularization, unless they\n\nare appointed against sanctioned vacant posts at the outset. He\n\nwould submit that the petitioners at best could be considered\n\nunder the\nKarnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012\n\nand on coming into force of the said Act the claim of the\n\npetitioners for regularization would cease to operate, but would\n\nadmit that the University needs their services and had\n\naccordingly communicated to the Government on several\n\noccasions seeking regularization of services of the petitioners.\n12. In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioners would\n\ncontend that the case of the petitioners for regularization by the\n\nUniversity is not effaced even as on date, as in the year 2019 the\n\nUniversity has again communicated to the Government seeking\n\nregularization of services of the petitioners. In this regard a\n\ncommunication is also sent on 12-09-2019 during the pendency\n\nof these petitions. Therefore, the submission of the University\n\nthat the petitioners are not entitled to claim regularization is\n\ncontrary to records.\n\nSubmissions of the State:\n\n13. The learned Additional Government Advocate would\n\ntoe the lines of the learned counsel for the University and would\n\nadd that the petitioners have no right to seek regularization once\n\nthe\nKarnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012\nhas\n\nbeen brought into force. The case of the petitioners can only be\n\nconsidered under the\nKarnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare\n\nAct, 2012\n, that too if they fulfill the conditions stipulated under\n\nthe provisions of the Act. Both the learned Counsel would refer\nto the latest judgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nUNION\n\nOF INDIA & OTHERS v. ILMODEVI AND ANOTHER\n.\n\n14. I have given my anxious consideration to the\n\nsubmissions made by the learned senior counsel and the other\n\nrespective learned counsel for the parties and have perused the\n\nmaterial on record. In furtherance whereof, the issue that\n\nrequires consideration is, whether in the facts of the case on\n\nhand the petitioners would be entitled to claim\n\nconsideration of their cases for regularisation?\n\nConsideration:\n\n15. The afore-quoted facts, dates of engagement of the\n\nservices of the petitioners, communications and\n\ncorrespondences exchanged between the University and the\n\nState Government are not in dispute and are, therefore, not\n\nreiterated. The issue that needs to be considered in the cases at\n\nhand is, whether petitioners are entitled to seek regularization\n\nof their services in the teeth of judgments rendered by the\n\nApex Court in the case of UMADEVI (supra) and\nlater judgments. The dates of engagement of the petitioners\n\nbegin close to 24 years ago. The Apex Court rendered its\n\njudgment in the case of UMADEVI (supra) on 10-04-2006. It is\n\ngermane to notice paragraph 53 of the said judgment and it\n\nreads as follows:\n\n\"53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be\ncases where irregular appointments (not illegal\nappointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1\nSCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N. Nanjundappa [(1972)\n1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799] and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979)\n4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] and\nreferred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in\nduly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and\nthe employees have continued to work for ten years or\nmore but without the intervention of orders of the courts or\nof tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\nof such employees may have to be considered on merits in\nthe light of the principles settled by this Court in the cases\nabove referred to and in the light of this judgment. In that\ncontext, the Union of India, the State Governments\nand their instrumentalities should take steps to\nregularise as a one-time measure, the services of\nsuch irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten\nyears or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\ncover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and\nshould further ensure that regular recruitments are\nundertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that\nrequire to be filled up, in cases where temporary\nemployees or daily wagers are being now employed.\nThe process must be set in motion within six months\nfrom this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if\nany already made, but not sub judice, need not be\nreopened based on this judgment, but there should be\nno further by passing of the constitutional\nrequirement and regularising or making permanent,\nthose not duly appointed as per the constitutional\nscheme.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Apex Court in the afore-quoted judgment devised\n\nillegal and irregular appointments and directed that illegal\n\nappointments cannot be regularised while irregular\n\nappointments can be regularised. Four conditions that can be\n\ndiscerned from paragraph 53 (supra) are that employment of the\n\npetitioners should be against a vacant post. The employees\n\nshould possess the requisite qualification and should have\n\ncompleted 10 years of service as on 10.04.2006 and\n\ncontinuation of the petitioners in employment should not be\n\nlitigious. The communications of the University begins after the\n\njudgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI.\n\nThose communications are germane to be noticed. The\n\nUniversity on 06-08-2007 communicates to the Government\n\nwith regard to employees working in various Departments of the\n\nUniversity and their entitlement for regularization and seeks\n\nrelease of block grant for consideration of cases of such\nemployees for regularization. The communication dated\n\n06.08.2007 reads as follows:\n\nUÉ,\n\n¥ÀæzsÁ£À PÀAiÀÄðPÀ²ðAiÀÄªÀgÀÄ\n²PÀët E¯ÁSÉ (G£ÀßvÀ ²PÀët)\n§ºÀÄªÀÄºÀr PÀlÖqÀ,\nqÁ.CA¨ÉÃqÀÌgï «Ã¢\n¨ÉAUÀ¼ÀÆgÀÄ - 560 001.\n\nªÀiÁ£ÀågÉÃ,\n\n«µÀAiÀÄ: «±Àé«zÁå®AiÀÄzÀ°è ºÀvÀÄÛ ªÀµÀð ¸ÉÃªÉ ¸À°è¹gÀÄªÀ ¢£ÀUÀÆ° /\nUÀÄwÛUÉ DzsÁjvÀ £ËPÀgÀgÀ£ÀÄß ¸ÀPÀæªÀÄUÉÆ½¸ÀÄªÀ §UÉÎ.\n\nG¯ÉèÃR: 1. vÀªÀÄä ¥ÀvÀæ PÀæªÀiÁAPÀ: Er 54 AiÀÄÄJE 2006 ¢£ÁAPÀ\n12.06.2006.\n\n2. 54£ÉÃ ¹ArPÉÃmï ¤tðAiÀÄ ¢£ÁAPÀ 02.09.2006.\n\n3. ¹ArPÉÃmï G¥À ¸À«ÄwAiÀÄ ªÀgÀ¢ ¢£ÁAPÀ: 22.02.2007.\n\n4. 60£ÉÃ ¹ArPÉÃmï ¤tðAiÀÄ ¢£ÁAPÀ 03.03.2007\n\n---\n\n¢£ÁAPÀ: 12.06.2006gÀAzÀÄ ¸ÀPÁðgÀzÀ ¥ÀæzÁs £À PÁAiÀÄðzÀ²ðAiÀÄªÀgÀÄ\n¥ÀvÀæ §gÉzÀÄ F »AzÉ ¢£ÁAPÀ: 25.05.2006gÀ°è ¸ÀPÁðgÀ ºÉÆgÀr¹zÀÝ\n¸ÀÄvÉÆÛÃ¯ÉAiÀÄ£ÀÄß ®UÀwÛ¹ ¢£ÁAPÀ:01.07.1984gÀ £ÀAvÀgÀ ¸ÉÃªÉAiÀÄ°è\nvÉÆqÀ¢¸À¯ÁzÀ ¢£ÀUÀÆ° £ËPÀgÀgÀ£ÀÄß ¸ÀPÀæªÀÄUÉÆ½¸ÀÄªÀ §UÉÎ ¸ÀªÉÇÃðZÀÒ\n£ÁåAiÀiÁ®AiÀÄzÀ ¸ÀA«zsÁ£À ¦ÃoÀªÀÅ ¤ÃrzÀ wÃ¦ðUÉ C£ÀÄ¸ÁgÀªÁV\n¸ÀÄvÉÆÛÃ¯ÉAiÀÄ ¥ÀæPÁgÀ ¥Àj²Ã°¹ ¤AiÀÄªÀiÁ£ÀÄ¸ÁgÀ PÀæ PÉÊUÉÆ¼Àî¨ÉÃPÉAzÀÄ\nw½¹gÀÄvÁÛgÉ.\n\nF »AzÉ ¸ÀPÁðgÀzÀ DzÉÃ±À ¸ÀASÉå r¦JDgï 2 J¸ï.L.¹ 90,\n¨ÉAUÀ¼ÀÆgÀÄ ¢£ÁAPÀ: 06.08.1990gÀ ¥ÀæPÁgÀ ¢£ÀUÀÆ° / ¤UÀ¢vÀªÉÃvÀ£ÀzÀ°è\n01.07.1984gÀ »A¢¤AzÀ ªÀÄvÀÄÛ 01.07.1984gÀ £ÀAvÀgÀ 10 ªÀµÀð ¸ÉÃªÉAiÀÄ£ÀÄß\n¥ÀÆtðUÉÆ½¹zÀ ¸ÀÄªÀiÁgÀÄ 296 £ËPÀgÀgÀ£ÀÄß ««zsÀ ºÀAvÀzÀ°è 1994 gÀ°è\n¸ÀPÀæªÀÄUÉÆ½¸À¯ÁVzÉ.\nDzÀgÀÆ E£ÀÆß PÉ®ªÀÅ £ËPÀgÀgÀÄ ¸ÀPÀæªÀÄUÉÆ¼ÀîzÉ EzÀÄÝ, ªÀÄvÀÄÛ\n«±Àé«zÁå®AiÀÄzÀ°è ¸ÀÄªÀiÁgÀÄ ªÀµÀðUÀ½AzÀ F ªÀgÉUÉ£ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw DUÀzÉ\nEgÀÄªÀÅzÀjAzÀ 1994gÀ £ÀAvÀgÀªÀÇ ¢£ÀUÀÆ°/¤UÀ¢vÀªÉÃvÀ£ÀzÀ°è £ËPÀgÀgÀ£ÀÄß\n£ÉÃªÀÄPÀ ªÀiÁrPÉÆ¼Àî¯ÁVzÉ.

This communication was in the light of 197 posts of\n\nGroup-D employees remaining vacant in the University. No\n\norders of regularization were passed in their cases. This led to\nwrit petitions being filed before this Court. All the employees\n\nwho claim to be working as Computer Operators and Computer\n\nProgrammers approached this Court in Writ Petition Nos.9959-\n\n9960 of 2011. This Court by its order dated 24-05-2012 allowed\n\nthe writ petitions and directed the University to regularize the\n\nservices of the petitioners therein. The order passed by this\n\nCourt reads as follows:\n\n\"11. In identical circumstances, in respect of two\nemployees by name Govindappa and Nagaraju in the\nrespondent University, this court in W.P.No.8300/2002\nvide order dated 15.9.2006 held that when an\nemployee worked in a particular category and if he\npossess the requisite qualification and experience then\nhe is to be regularised in that category. In\nimplementation of the order of this court in\nW.P.No.8300/2002, the respondent University\nregularised the services of two employees in Group - C.\nThen there is no justification for the respondent\nUniversity to deny the identical benefit to the petitioners\nherein. Even on this ground the petitioners are entitled\nfor regularisation in the cadre of Group - C.\n\n12. The contention of learned counsel for the\npetitioners that they are entitled for regularisation with\neffect from their initial entry into service in the year\n1994 is not acceptable to me. Though the petitioners\nentered services as temporary employees in the year\n1994, their services came to be regularised on\n11.04.2008 as per Annexure - F. The subsequent\ncorrespondence between the petitioners and the\nrespondent University was only with regard to the\nregularisation in Group - C cadre. Petitioners have not\nagitated the grievance relating to retrospective\nregularisation. At this length of time, it will be too harsh\non the respondent University to give effect to ther\nretrospective regularisation. Therefore I decline to\nextend the benefit of retrospective regularisation to the\npetitioners.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the following:\n\nORDER\n\ni. Writ petitions are hereby allowed.\n\nii. The impugned endorsements dated\n3/8.2.2011, Annexures - T and U issued\nby the first respondents are hereby\nquashed.\n\niii. It is declared that petitioners are entitled\nto be regularised in Group - C cadre as\ncomputer operator and computer\nprogrammer w.e.f.11.04.2008 and to\nextend the consequential benefits to them\nas expeditiously as possible and in any\nevent not later than three months from the\ndate of receipt of a copy of this order.\n\niv. Ordered accordingly.\"\n\nThe said decision was called in question by the University before\n\nthe Division Bench in Writ Appeal No.5577/2012 & connected\n\ncase which also came to be dismissed by order of the Division\n\nBench dated 01-04-2013. The Division Bench observes as\n\nfollows while declining to entertain the writ appeal:\n\"4. Firstly, in identical circumstances, other\nemployees who were similarly situated were granted the\nrelief of regularisation in Group-C category. Reference was\nmade to the order passed in W.P.No.8300/2002, wherein\nthe respondent-University has regularised the services of\nthe other employees in Group-C category and on the\nground of parity, the petitioners would be entitled for the\nsame relief. However, in the statement of objections filed\nby the respondents, they have specifically stated that\nregularizing the services of all the temporary employees\nwas from the date of their initial appointment. However, so\nfar as the respondents 1 and 2 are concerned, the\nregularization was from the date of regularization of their\nservices as Group-D employees.\n\n5. Under these circumstances, we are of the\nconsidered view that there is no error committed by the\nlearned single Judge which calls for interference.\nRespondents 1 and 2 have been working in the same\ncategory ever since the date of appointment without any\nbreak. It is not in dispute that the computer operator and\ncomputer programmer would not come under Group-D\ncategory. They would come under Group-C category.\nTherefore, the respondents 1 and 2 are entitled for\nregularization in Group-C category.\n\n6. In this view of the matter, there is no ground to\nentertain the appeals. Consequently, the appeals being\ndevoid of merit, are dismissed.\"\n\nThe services of the petitioners therein were regularised. Another\n\nset of writ petitions were filed by few of the petitioners in these\n\npetitions in W.P.Nos.35145-35210/2013 which came to be\ndisposed of by an order of this Court dated 28-04-2015 by the\n\nfollowing order:\n\n\"The case of the petitioner is that they have been\nworking as Group C and D employees in the cadre of First\nDivision Assistants, Second Division Assistants, Managers\nand Supervisors in Hostels, Library Assistants, Drivers,\nCooks, Attendants and Peons in the Bangalore University\nand have put in not more than ten years of service.13 It is\nspecifically contended that all the petitioners have been\ngiven appointment or had been engaged against\nsanctioned posts.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners has submitted\nthat after the decision of the Apex Court in the case of\n\nState of Karnataka & Ors Vs Umadevi\n- (2006) 4 SCC\n1, their cases for regularization were considered by the\nUniversity in terms of paragraph 53 of\nthe said judgment\n.\nAs the petitioners were all found to be duly qualified and\nworking against duly sanctioned posts, the University after\nconsidering the cases of the petitioners along with other\nsimilarly situated employees, on 4.8.2008, forwarded a list\nof 112 employees (including all the 66 petitioners) who all\nhad put in at least 10 years of service to the State\nGovernment seeking approval for regularization. When no\norders were passed on the said recommendation made by\nthe University to the State Government, the petitioners\nhave filed these writ petitions with a prayer for\nregularization in service of the respondent University.\n\nDespite time having been granted to the learned\ncounsel for the State on several occasions, he states that\nhe has not received instructions even though\ncommunication has been sent to respondent No.1. Learned\ncounsel for respondents 2 to 4 supports the case of the\npetitioners to the extent that the University had made\nrecommendation for regularization of the petitioners.\nIn my view, no useful purpose will be served by\nkeeping these writ petitions pending any further as the\nState Government has yet to take a decision on the\nrecommendation made by the University on 8.4.2008 with\nregard to regularization of the petitioners along with other\nsimilarly situate employees.\n\nIn such view of the matter, without going into the\nmerits of the claim of the petitioners, I dispose of these writ\npetitions, with a direction that the cases of the petitioners\nfor regularization be considered and decided by the State\nGovernment on the basis of the recommendation made by\nthe University on 8.4.2008, in accordance with law, by a\nreasoned and speaking order, as expeditiously as possible,\nbut not later than three months from the date of receipt of\ncertified copy of this order along with the copy of the copy\nof the communication dated 8.4.2008 made by the\nUniversity to the State Government. Learned counsel for\nthe petitioners states that the case of the petitioners would\nbe covered by the decision of the Apex Court in the case of\nMalathi Das (Retd.) now\nP B Mahishy & Ors Vs Suresh\n& Ors\n- Civil Appeal 3338/2014 decided on 7.3.2014\nas well as the Division Bench of this Court in the case of\nC\nG Jagadeesh Vs State of Karnataka - WP\n\n54284/2013 decided on 23.4.2014. While deciding the\ncases of the petitioners, the Officer of the State\nGovernment shall consider these decisions, copies of which\nshall also be provided by the petitioners.\n\nWith the aforesaid observations and direction, these\npetitions stand disposed of.\"\n\nThis Court while disposing of the aforesaid writ petitions\n\ndirected the respondents to consider recommendations dated\n\n08.04.2008 which contained the names of the petitioners in\n\nthese writ petitions. Again correspondences between the\nUniversity and the Government continued after disposal of the\n\nwrit petitions as aforesaid. The Syndicate of the University met\n\nto consider cases of the petitioners. This was in the wake of\n\ntelephonic instructions given by the State Government to\n\nconsider cases of the petitioners under the\nKarnataka Daily\n\nWage Employees Welfare Act, 2012\n. This resolution of the\n\nSyndicate dated 28-04-2015 reads as follows:\n\n\"Item No.: To consider Order dated 28.04.2015\nof the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in Writ\nPetition No.35210/2013 (S-Res), filed by 66\nConsolidated Wages -regarding.\n\nAGENDA NOTE:\n\nThe above matter was placed before the Syndicate in\nits meeting held on 29th December, 2015. The Syndicate\nresolved to approve the regularization of 66 daily wage\nemployees in Group - D posts. However, before\nimplementing the resolution of the Syndicate, the\nAdditional Chief Secretary to Govt., Higher Education\nDepartment has telephoned the Vice Chancellor on the\nevening of 30th December 2015 saying that while\nimplementing the Government's letter dated 25/11/2015,\nthe University should not use the word 'regularization' or\n'permanent' and the University should issue orders in\nterms of\nThe Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare\nAct, 2012\n(\nKarnataka Act\nNo.19 of 2013).\nThis Act\n\ncontemplates, inter- alia, that \"...the daily wage employees\nin the establishments whose names are notified by the\nGovernment under this Act, shall be continued on daily\nwage basis till they complete the age of sixty years. ...The\npay of a daily wage employee shall be the minimum of the\ntime scale of pay of the posts in which he is continued in\nservice. He shall also be paid admissible Dearness\nAllowance and House Rent Allowance as may be\ndetermined by the Government by order, from time to time.\nA daily wage employee shall be entitled for all General\nHolidays, Casual Leave of fifteen days and Earned Leave\nof thirty days per year. A daily wage employee may be\ngiven an increase in his pay at such interval of time as\nmay be determined by the Government, by order. ... The\nDaily Wage Employee shall be entitled for such terminal\nbenefits or ex-gratia, on his discontinuous after attaining\nthe age of Sixty years, as may be determined and notified\nby the Government from time to time.\"\n\nSensing this, the daily wage employees resorted to\nstrike, sat Dharana in the Vice Chancellor's room on 31st\nDecember 2015 and protested against the move of the\nUniversity to follow the instructions of the Addl. Chief\nSecretary and demanded regularization of the services of\nthese employees in terms of the Hon'ble High Court order\ndated 28th April 2015.\n\nIn the light of this, Vice-Chancellor has addressed a\nletter on 31.12.2015 seeking specific clarification from the\nState Government in this matter.\n\nCopies of the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees\nWelfare Act, 2012\nand the letter of the Vice-Chancellor\naddressed to the Addl.

It is the financial burden that becomes the bone\n\nof contention with the State Government. The University who\n\nhad time and again communicated that it would bear financial\n\nburden out of the grants given by the State Government also\n\ndoes a volte-face. Therefore, the entitlement of the petitioners in\n\nthe teeth of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court is\n\nrequired to be considered. The afore-narrated communications\n\nbeing facts, and the facts being stubborn, only the law is\n\nrequired to be noticed.\nUMADEVI and its aftermath:\n\n17. As observed hereinabove, the Apex Court rendered its\n\njudgment in the case of UMADEVI on 10-04-2006. Relevant\n\nparagraphs are already quoted hereinabove. Subsequent to the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI, considering\n\nthe case of UMADEVI the Apex Court in several judgments held\n\nand affirmed the right of several employees for regularization\n\nunder several circumstances. The Apex Court in the case of\n\nNARENDRA KUMAR TIWARI v. STATE OF JHARKHAND2\n,\n\nholds as follows:\n\n\"7. The purpose and intent of the decision\nin\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] was therefore twofold,\nnamely, to prevent irregular or illegal appointments in the\nfuture and secondly, to confer a benefit on those who had\nbeen irregularly appointed in the past.\n\nThe fact that the\nState of Jharkhand continued with the irregular\nappointments for almost a decade after the decision\nin\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is a clear indication that it\nbelieves that it was all right to continue with irregular\nappointments, and whenever required, terminate the\nservices of the irregularly appointed employees on the\nground that they were irregularly appointed. This is\nnothing but a form of exploitation of the employees by not\ngiving them the benefits of regularisation and by placing\n(2018) 8 SCC 238\nthe sword of Damocles over their head.\n\nThis is precisely\nwhat\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and Kesari [State of\nKarnataka v. M.L. Kesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247: (2010) 2 SCC\n(L&S) 826] sought to avoid.\n\n8. If a strict and literal interpretation, forgetting the\nspirit of the decision of the Constitution Bench in\nUmadevi\n(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1:\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753], is to be taken into consideration then\nno irregularly appointed employee of the State of\nJharkhand could ever be regularised since that State came\ninto existence only on 15-11-2000 and the cut-off date was\nfixed as 10-4-2006. In other words, in this manner the\npernicious practice of indefinitely continuing\nirregularly appointed employees would be\nperpetuated contrary to the intent of the\nConstitution Bench.\n\n9. The High Court as well as the State of\nJharkhand ought to have considered the entire issue\nin a contextual perspective and not only from the\npoint of view of the interest of the State, financial or\notherwise - the interest of the employees is also\nrequired to be kept in mind. What has eventually\nbeen achieved by the State of Jharkhand is to short\ncircuit the process of regular appointments and\ninstead make appointments on an irregular basis.\nThis is hardly good governance.\n\n10. Under the circumstances, we are of the view that\nthe Regularisation Rules must be given a pragmatic\ninterpretation and the appellants, if they have completed\n10 years of service on the date of promulgation of the\nRegularisation Rules, ought to be given the benefit of the\nservice rendered by them. If they have completed 10\nyears of service they should be regularised unless\nthere is some valid objection to their regularisation\nlike misconduct, etc.\n11. The impugned judgment and order [\nAnil Kumar\nSinha v. State of Jharkhand\n, 2016 SCC OnLineJhar 2904]\npassed by the High Court is set aside in view of our\nconclusions. The State should take a decision within four\nmonths from today on regularisation of the status of the\nappellants. The appeals are accordingly disposed of.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nLater, the Apex Court in the case of\nSHEO NARAIN NAGAR v.\n\nSTATE OF U.P.3\n, holds as follows:\n\n\"6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nrespondent has relied upon para 44 of the decision\nin\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753], so as to contend that it was\nnot the case of irregular appointment but of illegal\nappointment; there was no post available on which the\nservices of the appellants could have been regularised and\nappointment were in contravention of the reservation policy\nalso; thus, termination order was rightly issued and, in no\ncase, the appellants were entitled for regularisation of their\nservices.\n\n7. When we consider the prevailing scenario, it is\npainful to note that the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] has not been properly understood and rather\nwrongly applied by various State Governments. We have\ncalled for the data in the instant case to ensure as to how\nmany employees were working on contract basis or ad hoc\nbasis or daily-wage basis in different State departments.\nWe can take judicial notice that widely aforesaid practice\nis being continued. Though this Court has emphasised that\nincumbents should be appointed on regular basis as per\nrules but new devise of making appointment on contract\nbasis has been adopted, employment is offered on daily-\n(2018) 13 SCC 432\nwage basis, etc. in exploitative forms. This situation was\nnot envisaged by\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753]. The prime intendment of the decision was that\nthe employment process should be by fair means and not\nby back door entry and in the available pay scale.\n\nThat\nspirit of the\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has been ignored\nand conveniently overlooked by various State\nGovernments/authorities.\n\nWe regretfully make the\nobservation that\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] has not been implemented in its true spirit and\nhas not been followed in its pith and substance. It is\nbeing used only as a tool for not regularising the\nservices of incumbents.\nThey are being continued in\nservice without payment of due salary for which they\nare entitled on the basis of\nArticles 14\n, 16\nread with\n\nArticle 34(1)(d)\nof the Constitution of India as if they\nhave no constitutional protection as envisaged\nin D.S. Nakara v. Union of India [D.S.\nNakara v. Union of India, (1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983\nSCC (L&S) 145 : AIR 1983 SC 130] , from cradle to\ngrave. In heydays of life they are serving on\nexploitative terms with no guarantee of livelihood to\nbe continued and in old age they are going to be\ndestituted, there being no provision for pension,\nretiral benefits, etc. There is clear contravention of\nconstitutional provisions and aspiration of\ndowntrodden class. They do have equal rights and to\nmake them equals they require protection and\ncannot be dealt with arbitrarily. The kind of\ntreatment meted out is not only bad but equally\nunconstitutional and is denial of rights.\nWe have to\nstrike a balance to really implement the ideology\nof\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\nThus, the time\nhas come to stop the situation where\nUmadevi\n(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC\n1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] can be permitted to be\nflouted, whereas, this Court has interdicted such\nemployment way back in the year 2006.\n\nThe\nemployment cannot be on exploitative terms,\nwhereas\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] laid down that there\nshould not be back door entry and every post should be\nfilled by regular employment, but a new device has been\nadopted for making appointment on payment of paltry\nsystem on contract/ad hoc basis or otherwise.\n\nThis kind of\naction is not permissible when we consider the pith and\nsubstance of true spirit in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753].\n\n8. Coming to the facts of the instant case, there was\na direction issued way back in the year 1999, to consider\nthe regularisation of the appellants. However,\nregularisation was not done. The respondents chose to give\nminimum of the pay scale, which was available to the\nregular employees, way back in the year 2000 and by\npassing an order, the appellants were also conferred\ntemporary status in the year 2006, with retrospective effect\non 2-10-2002. As the respondents have themselves chosen\nto confer a temporary status to the employees, as such\nthere was requirement at work and posts were also\navailable at the particular point of time when order was\npassed. Thus, the submission raised by the learned\ncounsel for the respondent that posts were not available, is\nbelied by their own action. Obviously, the order was\npassed considering the long period of services rendered by\nthe appellants, which were taken on exploitative terms.\n\n9. The High Court dismissed the writ application\nrelying on the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753]. But the appellants were employed\nbasically in the year 1993; they had rendered service\nfor three years, when they were offered the service\non contract basis; it was not the case of back door\nentry; and there were no Rules in place for offering\nsuch kind of appointment. Thus, the appointment\ncould not be said to be illegal and in contravention\nof Rules, as there were no such Rules available at the\nrelevant point of time, when their temporary status\nwas conferred w.e.f. 2-10-2002.\n\nThe appellants were\nrequired to be appointed on regular basis as a one-\ntime measure, as\nlaid down in\npara 53 of\nUmadevi\n(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC\n1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . Since the appellants had\ncompleted 10 years of service and temporary status\nhad been given by the respondents with retrospective\neffect from 2-10-2002, we direct that the services of\nthe appellants be regularised from the said date i.e.\n2.10.2002, consequential benefits and the arrears of\npay also to be paid to the appellants within a period\nof three months from today.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Apex Court in the case of\nCHANDER MOHAN NEGI v.\n\nSTATE OF H.P.4\n, holds as follows:\n\n\"11. At the outset, it is to be noted that the schemes\nin question were notified in the years 2001 and 2003\nunder which appointments were made with regard to\nPrimary Assistant Teachers and Teachers in other\ncategories. At the relevant point of time, nobody has\nquestioned either the schemes or the appointments. It is\nthe specific case of the respondent State that such\nappointments have not affected the writ petitioners and the\nDepartment was not in a position to leave the schools,\nTeachers deficient for long since it would have affected the\nstudies of the students very badly. Therefore, it was the\ncase of the State that Teachers had been appointed under\nvarious schemes at that point of time and such\nappointments have been made up to the year 2007 and\n(2020)5 SCC 732\nhave no impact on the appellants since they have\ncompleted their two-year JBT training in the year 2011. As\nis evident from the order [\nPankaj Kumar v. State of H.P.\n,\n2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944] under appeal passed by the\nDivision Bench of the High Court, the appellant-writ\npetitioners have not even chosen to file rejoinder and the\nstand taken by the State thus has remained\nuncontroverted. Further, it is also to be noted that when\nsuch appointments were made during the years 2001 and\n2003 the writ petitions came to be filed in the years 2012\nand 2013.\n\nAs the writ petitioners have claimed interest for\ntheir appointment, the Division Bench of the High Court has\nrightly held [\nPankaj Kumar v. State of H.P.\n, 2014 SCC\nOnLine HP 5944] that such petitions cannot be considered\nas the public interest litigation. Such a writ petition which\nwas filed by the petitioners who came to be qualified only\nin the year 2011 are not entitled for any relief on the\nground of unexplained laches and inordinate delay of\nabout more than 10 years in approaching the court for\nquestioning the appointments. Though relief was sought\nagainst the State to deny the benefit of regularisation to the\nappointed Teachers, they were not even impleaded as\nparty respondents. An association was impleaded as third\nrespondent but without furnishing any material to show\nthat at least majority of appointees are members of such\nassociation.\n\nSo far as Primary Assistant Teachers Scheme\nof 2003, which was the subject-matter of letters patent\nappeal arising out of CWP No. 3303 of 2012-A filed by\nChander Mohan Negi and others, is concerned, the\nappellants in Civil Appeal No. 2813 of 2017 except\nAppellants 1, 2 and 4 have withdrawn [\nChander Mohan\nNegi v. State of H.P.\n, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 459] the appeal\nand Appellants 1 and 4 are already appointed as JBTs.\n\nInsofar as the only appellant viz. Appellant 2, Rajiv\nChauhan is concerned, it is stated that he is qualified and\nthere are vacant posts and he can be considered if he\napplies to any of the existing vacancies. So far as the\nPrimary Assistant Teacher Scheme is concerned, same was\nnotified as early as on 27-8-2003. As is evident from the\nScheme itself, the object of the Scheme appears to be to\ncompulsorily enrol children in schools for elementary and\nprimary education in the remote areas to achieve the goals\nas set by the Government while enacting the Himachal\nPradesh Compulsory Primary Education Act, 1997 with a\nview to achieve the target of 100% enrolment to children.\nAs per the Scheme, the eligibility was 10+2 from a\nrecognised Board/University and the candidates with\nhigher qualifications were also eligible and candidates\nwith professional qualifications were to be preferred. As\nper the regular Recruitment Rules the requisite qualification\nfor the post of JBT Teacher during the relevant time was\n10+2 with 50% marks and JBT certificate. As submitted by\nthe learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State that\ninitially though 3500 odd Teachers were appointed, as of\nnow there are only a total of 3294 Teachers working in this\ncategory and out of this about 1866 had the qualification of\n10+2 with more than 50% marks at the relevant point of\nengagement. Out of the balance, 1015 had 10+2 with less\nthan 50% marks, but they had higher qualification such as\nBA/MA/MSc or BEd, etc. Further, it is also brought to our\nnotice that out of all the candidates, 3294 candidates who\nare presently working have acquired the professional\nqualification of diploma in elementary education or have\nundergone Professional Development Programme for\nElementary Teachers. In that view of the matter, we are of\nthe view that when the appointees appointed under the\nscheme have completed more than almost 15 years of\nservice now and also have acquired the professional\nqualifications, they cannot be denied regularisation at this\npoint of time. As the appointments were made as per the\nschemes notified by the Government such appointments\ncannot be treated as illegal, if at all they can be considered\nirregular. When it is the plea of the State that in view of the\nhard topography/tribal areas in the State, large number of\nvacancies were there even in single teacher schools and to\nachieve the object of the Himachal Pradesh Primary\nEducation Act, 1997 such steps were taken, there is no\nreason to disbelieve the same, more so, in absence of any\naffidavit by way of rejoinder by the writ petitioners before\nthe High Court controverting the allegations in the reply\nfiled on behalf of the State.\n\n12. Even with regard to the Para Teachers Policy\nunder which various category of Teachers were appointed\nin the year 2003 pursuant to policy notified on 17-9-2003 it\nis clear from the record placed before this Court that all the\npersons who were recruited as Para Teachers were fully\nqualified as per the Recruitment and Promotion Rules i.e.\nthe Himachal Pradesh Education Department Class III\n(School and Inspection Cadre) Service Rules, 1973. In view\nof the stand of the State that such policy was necessitated\ndue to large number of vacant posts which have arisen\nyear after year and which could not be filled since the\nState Selection Subordinate Board, Hamirpur, which was\nresponsible for the selection of Teachers had come under a\ncloud and the selection process had come to a halt, such\nappointments cannot be rendered as illegal. Such aspect is\nalso evident from the policy itself. Even in other category of\nthe Grant-in-Aid to Parent Teacher Association Rules, all\nTeachers appointed under the Scheme fulfil the educational\nqualifications prescribed in the Rules. For such kind of\nTeachers, the Cabinet has taken decision to take over the\nTeachers on contract basis after completion of eight years\nof service which period was later reduced to seven years. It\nis also brought to our notice during the course of arguments\nthat out of the total 6799 Teachers, 5017 Teachers were\nalready taken over on contract basis by the State\nGovernment and only 1782 could not be taken over in view\nof the interim orders passed by this Court.\n\n13. It is true that in the initial schemes\nnotified by the Government, there was a condition\nthat such appointees should not seek\nregularisation/absorption but at the same time for no\nfault of them, they cannot be denied\nregularisation/absorption. It is in view of the\nrequirement of the State, their services were\nextended from time to time and now all the\nappointees have completed more than 15 years of\nservice. For majority of the appointed Teachers\nunder the various schemes, benefit was already\nextended and some left over candidates were denied\non account of interim orders passed by this Court.\nWith regard to Primary Assistant Teachers, it is\nstated that all the candidates have completed\nSpecial Teacher Training Qualifying Condensed\nCourse and also had obtained special JBT certificate\nafter 5 years' continuous service in terms of the\nHimachal Pradesh Education Code, 1985. The\njudgments relied on by learned counsel Shri\nPrashant Bhushan also would not render any\nassistance to the case of the appellants herein for\nthe reason that there was unexplained and\ninordinate delay on the part of the appellants in\napproaching the High Court and further having\nregard to explanation offered by the State about the\nneed of framing such policies to meet the immediate\nrequirement to fill up single teacher schools which\nwere vacant for a very long time, having regard to\ntopographical conditions, which is not even\ncontroverted by way of any rejoinder before the High\nCourt. In such view of the matter, taking the totality\nof peculiar circumstances of these cases, we are of\nthe view that the view expressed by this Court in the\njudgments relied on cannot be applied to the facts of\nthe case on hand. All the appointed candidates are\nworking for the meagre salaries pursuant to schemes\nnotified by the Government. Except the vague\nsubmission that such schemes were framed only to\nmake backdoor entries, there is no material placed\non record to buttress such submission. Further it is\nalso to be noted that though such schemes were\nnotified as early as in 2003, nobody has questioned\nsuch policies and appointments up to 2012 and\n2013.\nThe writ petition i.e. CWP No. 3303 of 2012-A\nwas filed in the year 2012 without even impleading\nthe appointees as party respondents. In the writ\npetition, there was no rejoinder filed by the writ\npetitioners disputing the averments of the State as\nstated in the reply-affidavit. Having regard to the\nnature of such appointments, appointments made as\nper policies cannot be termed as illegal. Having\nregard to material placed before this Court and\nhaving regard to reasons recorded in the impugned\norder [\nPankaj Kumar v. State of H.P.\n, 2014 SCC\nOnLine HP 5944] by the High Court, we are of the\nview that no case is made out to interfere with the\nimpugned judgment [\nPankaj Kumar v. State of H.P.\n,\n2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944] of the High Court.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nEarlier to the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the afore-\n\nquoted judgment, the Apex Court in the case of\nAMARENDRA\n\nKUMAR MOHAPATRA v. STATE OF ORISSA5\n, had held as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"42. The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] , as noticed earlier, permitted regularisation of regular\nappointments and not illegal appointments.\n\nQuestion,\nhowever, is whether the appointments in the instant case\ncould be described as illegal and if they were not, whether\nthe State could be directed to regularise the services of the\ndegree-holder Junior Engineers who have worked as ad hoc\nAssistant Engineers for such a long period, not only on the\nanalogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation but\nalso on the principle underlying para 53 of the decision\nin Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753].\n(2014) 4 SCC 583\n43. As to what would constitute an irregular\nappointment is no longer res integra. The decision of\nthis Court in\nState of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010)\n9 SCC 247: (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826], has examined\nthat question and explained the principle regarding\nregularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3)\ncase [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC\n1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. The decision\nin that case\n\nsummed up the following three essentials for\nregularisation: (1) the employees have worked for ten\nyears or more, (2) that they have so worked in a duly\nsanctioned post without the benefit or protection of\nthe interim order of any court or tribunal, and (3) they\nshould have possessed the minimum qualification\nstipulated for the appointment. Subject to these three\nrequirements being satisfied, even if the appointment\nprocess did not involve open competitive selection, the\nappointment would be treated irregular and not\nillegal and thereby qualify for regularisation.\nPara 7\nin this regard is apposite and may be extracted at this\nstage: (M.L. Kesari case [(2010) 9 SCC 247: (2010) 2\nSCC (L&S) 826], SCC p. 250)\n\n\"7.\nIt is evident from the above that there is\nan exception to the general principles against\n'regularisation' enunciated in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753], if the following conditions are\nfulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have\nworked for 10 years or more in a duly sanctioned\npost without the benefit or protection of the interim\norder of any court or tribunal. In other words, the\nState Government or its instrumentality should\nhave employed the employee and continued him in\nservice voluntarily and continuously for more than\nten years.\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should\nnot be illegal, even if irregular. Where the\nappointments are not made or continued against\nsanctioned posts or where the persons appointed\ndo not possess the prescribed minimum\nqualifications, the appointments will be considered\nto be illegal. But where the person employed\npossessed the prescribed qualifications and was\nworking against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.\"\n\n44. It is nobody's case that the degree-holder\nJunior Engineers were not qualified for appointment\nas Assistant Engineers as even they possess degrees\nfrom recognised institutions. It is also nobody's case\nthat they were not appointed against the sanctioned\npost. There was some debate as to the actual number\nof vacancies available from time to time but we have\nno hesitation in holding that the appointments made\nwere at all relevant points of time against sanctioned\nposts. The information provided by Mr Nageswara Rao,\nlearned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for\nthe State of Orissa, in fact, suggests that the number\nof vacancies was at all points of time more than the\nnumber of appointments made on ad hoc basis. It is\nalso clear that each one of the degree-holders has\nworked for more than 10 years ever since his\nappointment as ad hoc Assistant Engineer. It is in\nthat view difficult to describe these appointments of\nthe Stipendiary Engineers on ad hoc basis to be illegal\nso as to fall beyond the purview of the scheme\nenvisaged in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753].\n\n45. The upshot of the above discussion is that not only\nbecause in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] this Court did not\ndisturb the appointments already made or regularisation\ngranted, but also because the decision itself permitted\nregularisation in case of irregular appointments, the\nlegislative enactment granting such regularisation does not\ncall for interference at this late stage when those appointed\nor regularised have already started retiring having served\ntheir respective departments, in some cases for as long as\n22 years.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nA three Judge Bench of the Apex Court considering the case of\n\nUMADEVI and subsequent judgments in the case of\nPREM\n\nSINGH v. STATE OF U.P.6\n, holds as follows:\n\n\"36. There are some of the employees who have not\nbeen regularised in spite of having rendered the services for\n30-40 or more years whereas they have been\nsuperannuated. As they have worked in the work-charged\nestablishment, not against any particular project, their\nservices ought to have been regularised under the\nGovernment instructions and even as per the decision of this\nCourt in\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(\n3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753]. This Court in\nthe said decision\nhas laid down\nthat in case services have been rendered for more than\nten years without the cover of the Court's order, as\none-time measure, the services be regularised of such\nemployees. In the facts of the case, those employees\nwho have worked for ten years or more should have\nbeen regularised. It would not be proper to regulate\nthem for consideration of regularisation as others\nhave been regularised, we direct that their services be\ntreated as a regular one. However, it is made clear\nthat they shall not be entitled to claiming any dues of\n(2019) 10 SCC 516\ndifference in wages had they been continued in service\nregularly before attaining the age of superannuation.\n\nThey shall be entitled to receive the pension as if they\nhave retired from the regular establishment and the\nservices rendered by them right from the day they\nentered the work-charged establishment shall be\ncounted as qualifying service for purpose of pension.\n\n37. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P.\nRetirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that services\nrendered in the work-charged establishment shall be treated\nas qualifying service under the aforesaid rule for grant of\npension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three\nyears only before the date of the order. Let the admissible\nbenefits be paid accordingly within three months.\nResultantly, the appeals filed by the employees are allowed\nand filed by the State are dismissed.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nOn a coalesce of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court in\n\nthe afore-extracted cases which were in the aftermath of the\n\njudgment in the case of UMADEVI would in unmistakable terms\n\nindicate that regularization of employees is not a concept that is\n\nobliterated, but could be considered on several parameters\nlaid\n\ndown in\nthe said judgments. One unmistakable stream that\n\nruns through judicial thinking of judgments of the Apex Court is\n\nthat regularization of employees engaged to work for the State\n\nfor long years should be considered, failing which it would\n\namount to violation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n18. In my considered view, if the claim of the petitioners for\n\nregularization is not considered, it would be leaving such\n\nemployees in the lurch after having extracted work from them\n\nfor close to 24 years. The services of these petitioners have been\n\nutilized in their energetic youth, have travelled this far and are\n\nat this age, if they are not now considered for regularization, it\n\nwould amount to exploitation of such labour from the hands of\n\nthe University, a State under\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia. Such action would not behove the status of a State under\n\nthe Constitution of India. It is not the University that is now\n\nwanting to deny the benefit of regularization, but it is the State\n\nGovernment which is declining to accept their claim on an\n\nirrelevant plea of financial burden of rupees one crore thirty six\n\nlakhs.\n\nParity:\n\n19. It is trite law that there is no concept of negative\n\nequality, so to say, that if a mistake is committed by regularizing\n\nillegal appointments, the same cannot be directed to be done at\nthe hands of this Court. It is the case of neither that it is a\n\nmistake, several employees of the very University have been\n\ncorrectly regularised. They were all appointees like that of the\n\npetitioners. They were all regularised following the judgment of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of UMADEVI. The same treatment is\n\nnot meted to the petitioners. Parity in such regularization is also\n\na concept that is considered by the Apex Court in several cases.\n\nTo quote a few, are in the cases of\nDHANANJOY KARMAKAR v.\n\nSTATE OF W.B.7\n, wherein the Apex Court holds as follows:\n\n\"7. We are told by the learned counsel appearing for\nthe State of West Bengal that in terms of the order dated\n12-3-2002 what is important is that the name of the\nappellant did not appear in the report of DLIT, therefore,\nhis services could not be regularised. As noted by the\nlearned Single Judge and we have also been shown a\nphotocopy of the report of DLIT, the name of the appellant\ndoes appear in the report of DLIT. As far as the appellant\nnot being an organising teacher is concerned, it is\nexplained by the learned counsel for the State that an\norganising teacher ought to have been a teacher when the\nSchool was established. The report of DLIT indicates\nthat all the persons whose services have been\nregularised, as mentioned above, were appointed\nafter the School was established. Therefore, there is\nno reason for keeping the appellant out of the scope\nof regularisation when similarly placed teachers\nwere regularised by the State.\n(2015) 17 SCC 504\n8. We find no substance in any of the reasons\nbrought out for denying regularisation to the\nappellant. Under the circumstances, we set aside the\nimpugned judgment [State of W.B. v. DhananjoyKarmakar,\nFMA No. 276 of 2008, order dated 4-3-2008 (Cal)] passed\nby the High Court and uphold the order of the learned\nSingle Judge. The civil appeal is accordingly allowed with\nno order as to costs.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nLater, the Apex Court in the case of\nJIVANLAL v. PRAVIN\n\nKRISHNA8\n, has held as follows:\n\n\"2. The learned counsel for the respondents has\nvehemently contended that all the regularisation orders\npassed in the case of those pointed out by the appellants\nare illegal since the State, in principle, had decided to\ndiscontinue the appointment to the post of Sweepers by\norder dated 10-12-1997. However, the fact remains\nthat after the said order also, many similarly\nsituated persons have been granted regularisation\nwith effect from the date of completion of 10 years of\nservice.\n\n3. In that view of the matter, we do not find\nany justification in discriminating against the\nappellants herein. The policy had been violated in\nmany cases. There cannot be any pick and choose\npolicy; it would certainly lead to corruption. Hence, the\nappeals are allowed with a direction to the respondents to\ngrant similar treatment to the appellants herein as well\nand grant regularisation to them with effect from the date\nof completion of 10 years of service.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n(2016) 15 SCC 747\nDeclining to accept the plea of the State that it can choose its\n\nemployees for regularization, the Apex Court in the case of\n\nUNION OF INDIA v. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL9\n,\n\nhas held as follows:\n\n\"20. The judgment of this Court in\nUmadevi (3) [State\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] does not preclude the claims of employees who\nseek regularisation after the exercise has been undertaken\nwith respect to some employees, provided that the said\nemployees have completed the years of service as\nmandated by\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\nThe ruling\ncasts an obligation on the State and its\ninstrumentalities to grant a fair opportunity of\nregularisation to all such employees which are\nentitled according to the mandate under\nUmadevi\n(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and ensure that the benefit is not\nconferred on a limited few. The subsequent regularisation\nof employees who have completed the requisite period of\nservice is to be considered as a continuation of the one-time\nexercise.\n\n21. The decisions of this Court in\nUmadevi (3) [State\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] and M.L. Kesari [State of Karnataka v. M.L.\nKesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] were\nconsidered by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in\nNarendra\nKumar Tiwari v. State of Jharkhand [Narendra Kumar\nTiwari\nv. State of Jharkhand, (2018) 8 SCC 238 : (2018) 2\nSCC (L&S) 472] .\n\nMadan Lokur, J., construed the decision\nin\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] in the following terms:\n\n[Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2019) 4 SCC 290\n(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , SCC p. 241, para\n7]\n\"7.\n\nThe purpose and intent of the decision\nin\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] was\ntherefore twofold, namely, to prevent irregular\nor illegal appointments in the future and\nsecondly, to confer a benefit on those\nirregularly appointed in the past.\"\n\n22. The Court noted in the above judgment that if a\nstrict and literal interpretation was given to the decision\nin\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , no employee from the State\nof Jharkhand appointed on an irregular basis could ever be\nregularised as the State was formed on 15-11-2000 and\nthe cut-off date had been fixed as 10-4-2006.\n\nThe intent of\nthe Court was to grant similarly-placed employees who\nhad put the requisite years of service as mandated\nby\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006)\n4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , the benefit of\nregularisation. The Court thus held that the Jharkhand\nSarkar ke Adhinasth Aniyamit Rup se Niyukt Ewam\nKaryarat Karmiko ki Sewa Niyamitikaran Niyamawali,\n2015 (\"the Regularsation Rules\") must be interpreted in a\npragmatic manner and employees of the State who had\ncompleted 10 years of service on the date of promulgation\nof the rules, ought to be regularised. In doing so, the Court\nensured that employees in the State of Jharkhand who\nhad completed the same years of service as employees\nfrom other States, are granted parity in terms of\nregularisation.\n\nThe spirit of non-discrimination and equity\nruns through the decisions in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] , M.L. Kesari [State of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari,\n(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] and Narendra\nKumar Tiwari [Narendra Kumar Tiwari v. State of\nJharkhand, (2018) 8 SCC 238 : (2018) 2 SCC (L&S) 472] .\n23. In this background, the issue which now arises\nbefore this Court is in regard to the effective direction\nwhich would govern the present case. The High Court has\ndirected the Union of India to absorb the casual workmen,\nif it is not possible at the Institute in question, then in any\nother establishment. The latter part of the direction, as we\nhave already noted, cannot be sustained. Equally, in our\nopinion, the authorities cannot be heard to throw\ntheir hands in despair by submitting that there are\nno vacancies and that it had already regularised\nsuch of the persons in the seniority list, who\nreported for work. The Tribunal has entered a finding of\nfact that this defence is clearly not borne out of the record.\nAccordingly, we are of the view that having decided to\nimplement the decision of the Tribunal, which was affirmed\nby the High Court, the Union of India must follow a rational\nprinciple and abide strictly by the seniority list in\nproceeding to regularise the workmen concerned.\n\n24. Accordingly, we direct that the case for\nregularisation shall be considered strictly in accordance\nwith the seniority list in pursuance of the directions which\nwere issued by the Tribunal and confirmed by the High\nCourt and such of the persons, who are available for\nregularisation on the basis of vacancies existing at present,\nshall be considered in accordance with law. The Tribunal\nhas denied back wages but has ordered a notional fixation\nof pay and allowances. While affirming that direction,\nwe also direct that persons who have crossed the age\nof superannuation will be entitled to the\ncomputation and payment of their retiral dues on\nthat basis. This exercise shall be carried out within\na period of three months from the receipt of a copy of\nthe judgment. If it becomes necessary to grant age\nrelaxation to the workmen concerned, the appellants\nshall do so.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\nThe Apex Court in the afore-extracted judgments has deprecated\n\nthe action of the State adopting such policy that denies\n\nregularization. The Apex Court in the case of CENTRAL\n\nADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL holds that employees who had\n\ncompleted 10 years of service on the date of promulgation of\n\nsuch Rules had to be regularised on the ground of parity.\n\nTherefore, the concept of parity is also recognized by the Apex\n\nCourt in the cases of regularization of employees as quoted\n\nhereinabove. In the facts of the cases as narrated hereinabove\n\nand the judgments referred to (supra), the petitioners are\n\nentitled to claim the benefit of regularization and the University\n\nis obliged to consider the same in accordance with law.\n\n20. The learned counsel representing the University has\n\nreferred to certain judgments of the Apex Court which have\n\ndenied the benefit of regularization in the cases of\nSTATE OF\n\nRAJASTHAN AND OTHERS v. DAYA LAL & OTHERS\n- (\n2011)\n\n2 SCC 429, SCHOOL EDUCATION DEPTT., CHENNAI v. R.\n\nGOVINDASWAMY\n- (\n2014) 4 SCC 769, UNION OF INDIA v. ALL\nINDIA TRADE UNION CONGRESS\n- (2019) 5 SCC 773, SATYA\n\nPRAKASH V. STATE OF BIHAR - (2010) 4 SCC 179 and above\n\nall, to the latest judgment of the Apex Court in the case of\n\nUNION OF INDIA & OTHERS v. ILMODEVI AND ANOTHER10\n.\n\nThe judgment in the case of ILMODEVI considers all the other\n\njudgments that the learned counsel for the University has placed\n\nreliance on. The judgment in the case of ILMODEVI is\n\ndistinguishable on the facts obtaining in the case at hand\n\nwithout much ado. The employees in the said case were working\n\nas part-time sweepers having been appointed on such\n\ncontingencies and had completed 20 years of contractual\n\nservice, as part-time daily wagers. The Central Administrative\n\nTribunal had allowed the applications of those Safaiwalas who\n\nwere working for less than 5 hours in a day and directed\n\nconsideration of their cases for regularization which was\n\naffirmed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana which led the\n\nUnion of India to knock the doors of the Apex Court. It is on\n\nthose facts the Apex Court holds as follows:\nCivil Appeal Nos.5689-5690/2021 disposed on 07.10.2021\n\"8. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the\nrespondents-original applicants were working as\ncontingent paid part-time sweepers (Safai Karamcharies\nworking for less than five hours a day) in a Post Office at\nChandigarh. It is not in dispute and cannot be disputed\nthat there are no sanctioned posts of Safaiwalas in the\nPost Office in which the respondents were working. There\nis no documentary evidence on record to establish and\nprove that the respondents were working\ncontinuously. Even otherwise as observed\nhereinabove, they were working as contingent paid part-\n\ntime sweepers. Even it is not the case on behalf of the\nrespondents that their appointment was done after\nfollowing due procedure of selection and to that extent, it\ncannot be said that their appointments were irregular. As\nsuch in the absence of any sanctioned posts in the Post\nOffice in which the respondents were working, there was\nno question of appointing the respondents after following\ndue procedure. In light of the above, the directions issued\nby the High Court in the impugned judgment and order are\nrequired to be considered.\n\n8.1. In the present case, pursuant to the order\npassed by the learned Tribunal and the order passed\nin the contempt proceedings, the appellants came out\nwith a regularization policy dated 30.06.2014. In the said\nregularization policy, it has been provided as under: -\n\n\"(i) Regularization of all the Casual\nLabourers, who have been irregularly\n\nappointed, but are duly qualified persons in\nterms of statutory requirement rules for the post\nand was engaged against a sanctioned post,\nshall be done if they have worked for 10 years or\nmore but not under the covers of orders of courts\nor tribunals as on the date of Hon'ble Apex\nCourt's ibid judgment, i.e.,10.04.2006.\n(ii) A temporary contractual, casual or\ndaily wageworker shall not have a legal right to\nbe made permanent unless he/she fulfills the\nabove criteria.\n\n(iii) A Casual Labourer engaged without\nfollowing the due process or the rules relating to\nappointment and does not meet the above\ncriteria shall not be considered for their\nabsorption, regularization, permanency in the\nDepartment.\n\n(iv) If a Casual Labourer was engaged in\ninfraction of the rules or if his engagement is in\nviolation of the provisions of the Constitution,\nthe said illegal engagement shall not be\nregularized.\"\n\nThe afore-quoted paragraphs are the facts and at paragraphs\n\n8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 the Apex Court accepts the claim of Union of\n\nIndia and sets aside orders rendered by the Tribunal and the\n\nHigh Court. The said paragraphs read as follows:\n\n\"8.7 Thus, as per the law\nlaid down by\nthis\nCourt in the aforesaid decisions part-time employees\nare not entitled to seek regularization as they are\nnot working against any sanctioned post and there\ncannot be any permanent continuance of part-time\ntemporary employees as held. Part-time temporary\nemployees in a Government run institution cannot\nclaim parity in salary with regular employees of the\nGovernment on the principle of equal pay for equal\nwork.\n\n8.8 Applying the law\nlaid down by\nthis court in the\naforesaid decisions, the directions issued by the High\nCourt in the impugned judgment and order, more\nparticularly, directions in paragraphs 22 and 23 are\nunsustainable and beyond the power of the judicial review\nof the High Court in exercise of the power under\nArticle 226\n\nof the Constitution.\n\nEven otherwise, it is required to be\nnoted that in the present case, the Union of\nIndia/Department subsequently came out with a\nregularization policy dated 30.06.2014, which is absolutely\nin consonance with the law\nlaid down by\nthis Court in the\ncase of\nUmadevi\n(supra), which does not apply to the part-\ntime workers who do not work on the sanctioned post. As\nper the settled preposition of law, the regularization can be\nonly as per the regularization policy declared by the\nState/Government and nobody can claim the regularization\nas a matter of right dehors the regularization policy.\nTherefore, in absence of any sanctioned post and\nconsidering the fact that the respondents were serving as a\ncontingent paid part-time Safai Karamcharies, even\notherwise, they were not entitled for the benefit of\nregularization under the regularization policy dated\n30.06.2014.\n\n8.9 Though, we are of the opinion that even the\ndirection contained in paragraph 23 for granting minimum\nbasic pay of Group 'D' posts from a particular date to\nthose, who have completed 20 years of part-time daily\nwage service also is unsustainable as the part-time\nwagers, who are working for four to five hours a day\nand cannot claim the parity with other Group 'D'\nposts. However, in view of the order passed by this Court\ndated 22.07.2016 while issuing notice in the present\nappeals, we are not quashing and setting aside the\ndirections contained in paragraph 23 in the impugned\njudgment and order so far as the respondents' employees\nare concerned.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Apex Court holds that regularization can only be as per the\n\nregularization policy declared by the State/Government and\nnobody can claim regularization dehors the regularization policy.\n\nThe Apex Court also holds that the employees were not entitled\n\nto minimum basic pay even from a particular date. These are\n\nnot the facts in the case at hand.\n\n21. It is not in dispute that the University right from 2008\n\nupto 2019, has been communicating to the State Government\n\nseeking approval for regularization of services of the employees\n\nas one time measure, which is akin to a policy as is observed by\n\nthe Apex Court in the afore-quoted paragraphs of ILMODEVI.\n\nTherefore, it is not a case where the Apex Court denies\n\nregularization of the employees of the State but leaves it to the\n\nentities to formulate a policy in the event they want to regularise\n\nany of the services of its respective employees.\n\n22. Scores and scores of employees who were appointed on\n\ndaily wage basis have been regularised by the State even in the\n\npost UMADEVI era. Merely because the State Government has\n\nnotified the\nKarnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012\n,\n\nthe claim of the petitioners in these cases, for regularization,\ncannot vanish into thin air, as by the time the Act was\n\npromulgated all the petitioners herein had completed 14 to 16\n\nyears of service. The contention of the State Government or the\n\nUniversity that with the\nKarnataka Daily Wage Employees\n\nWelfare Act, 2012\ncoming into force, no employee can claim\n\nregularization falls foul of the interpretation of the Apex Court in\n\nthe case of\nSTATE OF KARNATAKA v. REVANNA.S11\nwherein\n\nthe Apex Court holds as follows:\n\n\"The Appellants rejected the request of the\nRespondent for regularization on the ground that he did not\ncomplete 10 years of continued service without the aid of\nthe interim order passed by the High Court.\n\nThe Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act,\n(Act of 2012) was notified on 15.02.2013. Certain\nbenefits pertaining to the continuance of daily wage\nemployees on completion of 10 years and the payment of\nminimum time scale along with other benefits were\nprovided in the said Act. The above Act does not\ncontemplate regularization of daily wagers.\n\nAggrieved by the rejection of his request for\nregularization, the Respondent filed application Nos.5168-\n5169 of 2013 which was allowed by the Karnataka\nAdministrative Tribunal. A direction was issued to the\nAppellants to consider the regularization of the service of\nthe Respondent. Dissatisfied with the direction to consider\nhis case for regularization, the Respondent filed a Writ\nPetition in the High Court of Karnataka. On a consideration\nCivil Appeal No.5292 of 2019 disposed of on 09-07-2019\nof the history of the case, the High Court issued a positive\nmandamus to the Appellants to regularize the service of the\nRespondent.\n\nMr. Basava Prabhu Patil, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing for the Appellants submitted that the\nRespondent does not have a right for regularization,\nespecially after the Act of 2012 was brought into existence.\nAccording to him, the Respondent is entitled to be\nconsidered only for the benefits flowing from the Act.\n\nIn its judgment dated 09.03.2012, the Karnataka\nAdministrative Tribunal held that the Respondent worked\nfor more than 10 years in a duly sanctioned post without\nthe benefit or protection of an interim order passed by any\nCourt or Tribunal. While holding so, the Tribunal observed\nthat the rejection of Respondent's request for regularization\non the ground that he does not comply with the\nrequirements of paragraph 53 of the judgment in the case\nof\nSecretary, State of Karnataka and Others Vs. Umadevi\nand Others1\nwas erroneous. The said judgment of the\nTribunal has become final as it was not challenged by the\nAppellants.\n\nIn view thereof, the Respondent had a right to\nbe considered for regularization of his service in\naccordance with the judgment in\nUmadevi\n's case on the\nbasis of the findings recorded by the Tribunal in its\njudgment dated 09.03.2012.\n\nThe rejection of the request of the Respondent\nfor regularization of his service in the light of the\nAct of 2012 is not correct. It is relevant to note that\nthe Act of 2012 does not deal with the judgments\nwhich were passed earlier granting the benefit of\nregularization to daily wage employees. Therefore,\nthe judgments of the Tribunal 1 (2006) 4 SCC 1 and\nthe High Court on regularization remain unaffected.\nIn view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of\nthis case, we do not see any reason to interfere with\nthe direction issued by the High Court to regularize\nthe service of the Respondent.\nEight weeks' time is granted to comply with the\norder. The Civil Appeal and pending applications stand\ndispose of accordingly.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nTherefore, in the light of the judgment of the Apex Court (supra),\n\nthe State cannot now direct the University to consider the cases\n\nof the petitioners under the Daily Wage Welfare Act. Therefore,\n\nsuch orders communicated to the University by the State will\n\nrun counter to the judgment in the case of\nREVANNA\n(supra).\n\n23. It is now germane to notice in the journey of the order\n\nto consider the result of such regularization. Granting arrears of\n\nwages to the petitioners in the event of their regularization will\n\nmulct either the State or the University and then place the State\n\nor the University under financial stress. Therefore, the\n\npetitioners shall not be entitled to any back-wages once the\n\nbenefit of regularization is granted to the petitioners in terms of\n\nthe recommendations/proposals made by the University from\n\ntime to time, but such service rendered by each of the\n\npetitioners after 10 years of their initial appointment shall count\nfor the purpose of determination of every other service condition\n\nand all terminal benefits.\n\n24. Ergo, on a coalesce of the afore-narrated facts; the law\n\nlaid down in\nthe case of UMADEVI and its aftermath; the\n\ncorrespondences/recommendation/proposal of the University to\n\nthe State, would all lead to an unmistakable inference that the\n\npetitioners who were all appointed by the University close to 20\n\nyears ago, have continued to work, in and for the University\n\nwithout any break, and never on the strength of any interim\n\norder granted by any judicial fora. In their heydays these\n\npetitioners have toiled to serve the University on receiving even\n\npaltry sums as salary. The need of these employees by the\n\nUniversity is time and again recognised in the\n\ncommunications/proposals for such regularization. If their cases\n\nare not considered at this juncture, it would be an arbitrary\n\naction, violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India and\n\nwould result in leaving the employees in the lurch. The\n\nbuoyancy of hope that the petitioners have all along carried with\nthem should not again be turned by the respondents into a\n\nfatigue of despair. The State and the University cannot display a\n\nhands-off to their obligation, to consider the cases of the\n\npetitioners.\n\n25. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:\n\nORDER\n\n(i) The Writ Petitions are allowed.\n\n(ii) The orders impugned in all these writ petitions stand\nquashed.\n\n(iii) The State Government shall consider the proposal of\nthe University sent on 12.09.2019 or any other\nproposal/recommendation sent hitherto, to\n12.09.2019 and pass appropriate orders in\naccordance with law, bearing in mind the\nobservations made in the course of the order.\n\n(iv) The University shall not shirk its responsibility of\nconsidering the cases of the petitioners for\nregularization of their services in the event the State\nGovernment would leave it to the discretion of the\nUniversity to consider the cases of the petitioners for\nregularization.\n\n(v) In the event the orders of regularization are passed\nby the University, the petitioners shall not be entitled\nto any arrears of salary, but would become entitled to\ncount their services after completion of 10 years from\nthe respective dates of their initial engagement for\nthe purpose of determination of all other service\nconditions and every terminal benefit.\n\n(vi) The University and the State Government, in unison,\nshall consider the claim of the petitioners in terms of\ndirections (iii) and (iv) within four months, from the\ndate of receipt of a copy of this order.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\nbkp\nCT:MJ",
