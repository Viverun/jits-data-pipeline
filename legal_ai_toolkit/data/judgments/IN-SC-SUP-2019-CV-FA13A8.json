HSCC (India) Ltd.\n2. The application has been filed with following assertions: -\n\n(A) As an executing agency of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,\n\nthe respondent was desirous of comprehensive architectural planning and\n\ndesigning for the works provided under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya\n\nSuraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Therefore a request for Proposals bearing RFP\n\nNo.HSCC/3-AIIMS/Guntur/2016 was issued on 15.07.2016 for\n\nappointment of Design Consultants for the “comprehensive planning and\n\ndesigning, including preparation and development of concepts, master plan\n\nfor the campus, preparation of all preliminary and working drawings for\n\nvarious buildings/structures, including preparation of specifications and\n\nschedule of quantities’ for the proposed All India Institute of Medical\n\nSciences at Guntur, Andhra Pradesh”.\n\n(B) In response to the RFP, the consortium of the Applicants, namely,\n\n(i) Perkins Eastman Architects DPC, an Architectural firm having its\n\nregistered office in New York and (ii) Edifice Consultants Private Limited,\n\nhaving its office in Mumbai submitted their bid on 28.09.2016. Letter of\n\nIntent was issued on 31.11.2017 awarding the project to the Applicants, the\n\nconsideration being Rs.15.63 crores. A letter of award was issued in\n\nfavour of the Applicants on 22.02.2017 and a contract was entered into\n\nbetween the Applicants and the respondent on 22.05.2017, which provided\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\ninter alia for dispute resolution in Clause 24. The relevant portion of said\n\nClause was as under:\n\n“24.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n24.1 Except as otherwise provided in the contract all\nquestions and disputes relating to the meaning of the\nspecifications, design, drawings and instructions\nherein before mentioned and as to the quality of\nservices rendered for the works or as to any other\nquestion, claim, right, matter or thing whatsoever in\nany way arising out of or relating to the contract,\ndesign, drawings, specifications estimates\ninstructions, orders or these conditions or otherwise\nconcerning the works or the execution or failure to\nexecute the same whether arising during the progress\nof the work or after the cancellation, termination,\ncompletion or abandonment thereof thereof shall be\ndealt with as mentioned hereinafter:\n\n(i) If the Design Consultant considers any work\ndemanded of him to be outside the requirements of\nthe contract or disputes on any drawings, record or\ndecision given in writing by HSCC on any matter in\nconnection with arising out of the contract or carrying\nout of the work, to be unacceptable, he shall promptly\nwithin 15 days request CGM, HSCC in writing for\nwritten instruction or decision. There upon, the\nCGM, HSCC shall give his written instructions or\ndecision within a period of one month from the\nreceipt of the Design Consultant’s letter. If the CGM,\nHSCC fails to give his instructions or decision in\nwriting within the aforesaid period or if the Design\nConsultant(s) is dissatisfied with the instructions or\ndecision of the CGM, HSCC, the Design\nConsultants(s) may, within 15 days of the receipt of\ndecision, appeal to the Director (Engg.) HSCC who\nshall offer an opportunity to the Design Consultant to\nbe heard, if the latter so desires, and to offer evidence\nin support of his appeal. The Director (Engg.), HSCC\nshall give his decision within 30 days of receipt of\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nDesign Consultant’s appeal. If the Design Consultant\nis dissatisfied with the decision, the Design\nConsultant shall within a period of 30 days from\nreceipt of this decision, give notice to the CMD,\nHSCC for appointment of arbitrator failing which\nthe\nsaid decision\nshall be final, binding and conclusive\nand not referable to adjudication by the arbitrator.\n\n(ii) Except where the decision has become final,\nbinding and conclusive in terms of sub-Para (i) above\ndisputes or difference shall be referred for\nadjudication through arbitration by a sole arbitrator\nappointed by the CMD HSCC within 30 days form\nthe receipt of request from the Design Consultant. If\nthe arbitrator so appointed is unable or unwilling to\nact or resigns his appointment or vacates his office\ndue to any reason, whatsoever another sole arbitrator\nshall be appointed in the manner aforesaid. Such\nperson shall be entitled to proceed with the reference\nfrom the reference from the stage at which it was left\nby his predecessor. It is a term of this contract that\nthe party invoking arbitration shall give a list of\ndisputes with amounts claimed in respect of each such\ndispute along with the notice for appointment of\narbitrator and giving reference to the rejection by the\nCMD, HSCC of the appeal. It is also a term of this\ncontract that no person other than a person appointed\nby such CMD, HSCC as aforesaid should act as\narbitrator. It is also a term of the contract that if the\nDesign Consultant does not make any demand for\nappointment of arbitrator in respect of any claims in\nwriting as aforesaid within 120 days of receiving the\nintimation from HSCC that the final bill is ready for\npayment, the claim of the Design Consultant shall be\ndeemed to have been waived and absolutely barred\nand HSCC shall be discharged and released of all\nliabilities under the contract and in respect of these\nclaims.

HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n(C) Within six days of the signing of the said contract, in letter dated\n\n26.5.2017 the respondent alleged failure on part of the Applicants which\n\nwas followed by stop work notice dated 03.11.2017. It is the case of the\n\nApplicants that officials of the respondents were deliberately trying to stall\n\nthe project and were non-co-operative right from the initial stages.\n\n(D) Later, a termination notice was issued by the respondent on\n\n11.01.2019 alleging non-compliance of contractual obligations on part of\n\nthe Applicants, which assertions were denied. However, termination letter\n\nwas issued on 20.02.2019. On 11.04.2019 a notice was issued by the\n\nAdvocate for the applicants invoking the dispute resolution Clause namely\n\nClause 24 as aforesaid raising a claim of Rs.20.95 crores.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, a decision in respect of the notice dated\n\n11.04.2019 was required to be taken within one month in terms of Clause\n\n24 of the contract but a communication was sent by the respondent on\n\n10.05.2019 intimating that a reply to the notice would be sent within 30\n\ndays.\n\n(E) An appeal was filed by the Applicants before the Director\n\n(Engineering) in terms of said Clause 24 but there was complete failure on\n\npart of the Director (Engineering) to discharge the obligations in terms of\n\nsaid Clause 24. Therefore, by letter dated 28.06.2019 the\nChief Managing\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nDirector of the respondent was called upon to appoint a sole arbitrator in\n\nterms of said Clause 24. However, no appointment of an arbitrator was\n\nmade within thirty days but a letter was addressed by Chief General\n\nManager of the respondent on 30.07.2019 purportedly appointing one\n\nMajor General K.T. Gajria as the sole arbitrator.\n\n(F) The relevant averments in para 3 of the application are:-\n\n“z. The 30 (thirty) day time period for appointment\nof a sole arbitrator stood expired on 28 th July, 2019\nand yet the CMD of the respondent failed to appoint a\nsole arbitrator or even respond to the letter dated 28 th\nJune, 2019 (received on 29th June, 2019).\n\naa. Shockingly, in continuance of its highhanded\napproach and in contravention to its own letter dated\n24th June, 2019, the CGM of the Respondent\naddressed the Purported Appointment Letter dated\n30th July, 2019 to one Major General K.T. Gajria\nthereby purportedly appointing him as a sole\narbitrator in the matter. On the same date, the CGM\nof the Respondent also addressed a letter to the\nApplicants inter alia informing about the purported\nappointment of Mr. Gajria”\n\n3. In the aforesaid premises the Applicants submit:-\n\n(a) The Applicants had duly invoked the arbitration clause;\n\n(b) The Chairman and Managing Director was the competent\n\nauthority to appoint a sole arbitrator;\n\n(c) But the Chief General Manager of the respondent wrongfully\n\nappointed the sole arbitrator;\n\n(d) Such appointment was beyond the period prescribed;\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n(e) In any case, an independent and impartial arbitrator is required to\n\nbe appointed.\n\n4. In response to the application, an affidavit-in-reply has been filed\n\nby the respondent denying all material allegations. It is accepted that the\n\ncontract entered into between the parties contains Clause 24 regarding\n\ndispute resolution. It is, however, disputed that there was any inaction on\n\npart of the respondent in discharging their obligations in terms of Clause\n\n24. It is submitted, inter alia, that\n\n(a) The appointment of Major General K.T. Gajria was in\n\nconsonance with Clause 24 of the contract;\n\n(b) Such appointment could not in any way be said to be illegal;\n\n(c) There was no occasion to file an application seeking\n\nappointment of any other person under the provisions of Section 11(6)\n\nread with Section 11(12)(a) of the Act; and\n\n(d) In any case, the arbitration in the present matter would not be an\n\nInternational Commercial Arbitration within the meaning of\nSection\n\n2(1)(f)\nof the Act.\n\n5. We heard Mr. Amar Dave, learned Advocate for the Applicants and\n\nMr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned Senior Advocate for the respondent.\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nIt was submitted by Mr. Dave, learned Advocate that on account of\n\nfailure on part of the respondent in discharging its obligations in terms of\n\nClause 24, the applicants would be entitled to maintain the present\n\nApplication and seek appointment of an arbitrator as prayed for. It was\n\nfurther submitted that the appointment process contemplated in Clause 24\n\ngave complete discretion to the Chairman and Managing Director of the\n\nrespondent to make an appointment of an arbitrator of his choice, the\n\nChairman and Managing Director of the respondent would naturally be\n\ninterested in the outcome or decision in respect of the dispute, the pre-\n\nrequisite of element of impartiality would, therefore, be conspicuously\n\nabsent in such process; and as such it would be desirable that this Court\n\nmakes an appropriate appointment of an arbitrator. Reliance was placed on\n\nthe decisions of this Court in Walter Bau AG, Legal Successor of the\n\nOriginal Contractor, Dyckerhoff and Widmann, A.G. v. Municipal\n\nCorporation of Greater Mumbai and another 3 and TRF Limited v.\n\nEnergo Engineering Projects Limited4 in support of the submissions. Mr.\n\nDave, learned Advocate also relied upon the decision of this Court in\n\nLarsen and Toubro Limited SCOMI Engineering BHD v. Mumbai\n\nMetropolitan Region Development Authority5\nto bring home the point that\n\n3 (\n2015) 3 SCC 800\n4 (2017) 8 SCC 377\n5 (2019) 2 SCC 271\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nthe arbitration in the present matter would be an International Commercial\n\nArbitration.\n\nMr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned Senior Advocate appearing for\n\nthe respondent submitted that no case was made out to maintain the instant\n\napplication. He submitted that two basic submissions were raised in para 3\n\nin sub-para (z) and (aa) of the application that the Chairman and Managing\n\nDirector failed to appoint the sole arbitrator within 30 days of the\n\nrequisition dated 28.06.2019 and that it was the Chief General Manager of\n\nthe respondent who purportedly made the appointment of a sole arbitrator\n\non 30.07.2019. The infirmities thus projected were on two counts, namely,\n\nfor over-stepping the limit of 30 days; and secondly the appointment was\n\nnot made by the Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent. He\n\npointed out that the period in terms of requisition dated 28.06.2019 expired\n\non Friday and the appointment was made on the first available working\n\nday. Secondly, the appointment was actually made by the Chairman and\n\nManaging Director but was conveyed by the Chief General Manager, and\n\nas such the alleged infirmities were completely non-existent. He further\n\nsubmitted that arbitration, if any, in the instant matter would not be an\n\nInternational Commercial Arbitration.\n\n6. The present application, therefore, raises two basic issues; first\n\nwhether the arbitration in the present case would be an\nInternational\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nCommercial Arbitration or not. In case, it is not, then this Court cannot\n\ndeal with the application under\nSection 11(6)\nread with\nSection 11(12)(a)\n\nof the Act. The second issue is whether a case is made out for exercise of\n\npower by the Court to make an appointment of an arbitrator.\n\n7. During the course of hearing, reliance was placed by the Applicants\n\non the Consortium Agreement entered into between the Applicant No.1 and\n\nthe Applicant No.2 on 20.09.2016 which described the Applicant No.1 as\n\nthe lead member of the Consortium. The relevant recital and the Clause of\n\nthe Agreement were as under:\n\n“1. WHEREAS all the Parties agree that Perkins\nEastman will be the focal point for the agreement and\ninteraction with the client.”\n\n“9. Perkins Eastman and M/s. Edifice Consultants are\njointly and severally responsible for the execution of\nthe project”\n\nIn terms of requirements of the bid documents and RFP a\n\n“Declaration for Lead Member of the Consortium (Form E)” was also\n\nsubmitted. The declaration was as under:\n\n“WHEREAS M/s. HSCC (India) Ltd. (HSCC) (the\nClient) has invited Bids/Bids from the interested\nparties for providing Comprehensive Planning and\nDesigning of the Proposed All India Institute of\nMedical Sciences at Mangalagiri, Guntur (AP).\n\nAND WHEREAS, the members of the Consortium\nare interested in bidding for the Project and\nimplementing the Project in accordance with the\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nterms and conditions of the Request for Bid (RFP)\ndocument, Terms of Reference, Client’s Requirement,\nNotice Inviting Bid, Instructions to Bidders,\nConditions of Contract and other connected\ndocuments in respect of the Project, and\n\nAND WHEREAS, it is necessary under the RFP\ndocument for the members of the Consortium Bidder\nto designate one of them as the Lead Manager with all\nnecessary power and authority to do for and on behalf\nof the Consortium bidder, all acts, deeds and things as\nmay be necessary in connection with the Consortium\nBidder’s proposal for the Project.\n\nNOW THIS DECLARATION WITNESSETH THAT;\n\nWe, Perkins Eastman Architects DPC, and having its\nregistered office at 115 5th Ave Floor 3, New York,\nNY 10003-10004, USA and M/s. Edifice Consultants\nPrivate Limited having its registered office at Srirams\nArcade, 3rd Floor, Opp. Govandi P.O., Off Govandi\nStation Road, Govandi East, Mumbai, Maharashtra\n400088 do hereby designate Perkins Eastman\nArchitects DPC being one of the members of the\nConsortium, as the Lead Member of the Consortium,\nto do on behalf of the Consortium, all or any of the\nacts, deeds of things necessary or incidental to the\nConsortium’s Application/Bid for the Project,\nincluding submission of Application/Bid, participating\nin conferences, responding to queries, submission of\ninformation/documents and generally to represent the\nConsortium in all its dealings with HSCC, any other\nGovernment Agency or any person, in connection\nwith the Project until culmination of the process of\nbidding and thereafter till the completion of the\nContract.”\n\n8. It is not disputed by the respondent that it was a requisite condition\n\nto declare a lead member of the Consortium and that by aforesaid\n\ndeclaration the applicant No.1 was shown to be the lead member of the\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nConsortium. The reliance is however placed by the respondent on Clause\n\n9 of the Consortium Agreement by virtue of which both the Applicants\n\nwould be jointly and severely responsible for the execution of the project.\n\nIt is clear that the declaration shows that the Applicant No.1 was accepted\n\nto be the lead member of the Consortium. Even if the liability of both the\n\nApplicants was stated in Clause 9 to be joint and several, that by itself\n\nwould not change the status of the Applicant No.1 to be the lead member.\n\nWe shall, therefore, proceed on the premise that Applicant No.1 is the lead\n\nmember of the Consortium.\n\n9. In Larsen and Toubro Limited SCOMI Engineering BHD 5 more\n\nor less similar fact situation came up for consideration. The only\n\ndistinction was that the lead member in the consortium was an entity\n\nregistered in India. Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 15, 17, 18 and 19 of the decision\n\nare as under:\n\n“2. Since disputes arose between the parties to the\nagreement, various interim claims had been made by\nthe Consortium of M/s Larsen and Toubro, an Indian\ncompany, together with Scomi Engineering Bhd, a\ncompany incorporated in Malaysia, for which the\nConsortium has filed this petition under\nSection 11\nof\nthe Act to this Court, since according to them, one of\nthe parties to the arbitration agreement, being a body\ncorporate, incorporated in Malaysia, would be a body\ncorporate, which is incorporated in a country other\nthan India, which would attract\nSection 2(1)(f)(ii)\nof\nthe Act.\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n3. Shri Gopal Jain, learned Senior Counsel appearing\non behalf of the Consortium, has taken us through the\nagreement, in which he strongly relies upon the fact\nthat the two entities, that is, the Indian company and\nthe Malaysian company, though stated to be a\nConsortium, are jointly and severally liable, to the\nemployer. The learned Senior Counsel has also relied\nupon the fact that throughout the working of the\ncontract, separate claims have been made, which have\nbeen rejected by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region\nDevelopment Authority (hereinafter referred to as\n“MMRDA”). He has also further relied upon the fact\nthat by at least three letters, during the working of the\nagreement, the claims have in fact been rejected\naltogether and that, therefore, there is no impediment\nin invoking the arbitration Clause under\nSection 20\n.4\nof the general conditions of contract (hereinafter\nreferred to as “GCC”), as the procedure outlined by\nClauses 20.1 to 20.3 had already been exhausted.\n\n4. On the other hand, Mr Shyam Divan, learned\nSenior Counsel appearing on behalf of MMRDA, the\nrespondent, has relied upon both the contract dated 9-\n\n1-2009 as well as the actual consortium agreement\ndated 4-6-2008 between the Indian company and the\nMalaysian company, which, when read together,\nwould show that they are really an unincorporated\nassociation and would, therefore, fall within\nSection\n2(1)(f)(iii)\nas being an association or a body of\nindividuals, provided the central management and\ncontrol is exercised in any country other than India.\n\n… … …\n\n15.\nSection 2(1)(f)(iii)\nof the Act refers to two\ndifferent sets of persons: an “association” as distinct\nand separate from a “body of individuals”. For\nexample, under\nSection 2(31)\nof the Income Tax Act,\n1961, “person” is defined as including, under sub-\nclause (v), an association of persons, or body of\nindividuals, whether incorporated or not. It is in this\nsense, that an association is referred to in\nSection 2(1)\n\n(f)(iii) which would therefore include a consortium\nconsisting of two or more bodies corporate, at least\none of whom is a body corporate incorporated in a\ncountry other than India.\n\n… … …\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n17. Law Commission Report No. 246 of August 2014,\nwhich made several amendments to the\nArbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996\n, gave the following reason\nfor deleting the words “a company or”:\n\n“(iii) In sub-section (1), clause (f), sub-clause\n\n(iii), delete the words “a company or” before the\nwords “an association or a body of individuals”.\n\n[Note.—The reference to “a company” in sub-\n\nsection (iii) has been removed since the same is\nalready covered under sub-section (ii). The\nintention is to determine the residence of a\ncompany based on its place of incorporation and\nnot the place of central management/control. This\nfurther re-enforces the “place of incorporation”\nprinciple\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in\n\nTDM Infrastructure (P) Ltd. v. UE Development\nIndia (P) Ltd.6\n, and adds greater certainty in case\nof companies having a different place of\nincorporation and place of exercise of central\nmanagement and control.]”\n\nIt would become clear that prior to the deletion of the\nexpression “a company or”, there were three sets of\npersons referred to in\nSection 2(1)(f)(iii)\nas separate\nand distinct persons who would fall within the said\nsub-clause. This does not change due to the deletion\nof the phrase “a company or” for the reason given by\nthe Law Commission. This is another reason as to\nwhy “an association” cannot be read with “body of\nindividuals” which follows it but is a separate and\ndistinct category by itself, as is understood from the\ndefinition of “person” as defined in the\nIncome Tax\nAct\n\nreferred to above\n.\n\n18. This being the case, coupled with the fact, as\ncorrectly argued by Shri Divan, that the Indian\ncompany is the lead partner, and that the Supervisory\nBoard constituted under the consortium agreement\nmakes it clear that the lead partner really has the\ndetermining voice in that it appoints the Chairman of\nthe said Board (undoubtedly, with the consent of other\nmembers); and the fact that the Consortium’s office is\n\n6 (\n2008) 14 SCC 271\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nin Wadala, Mumbai as also that the lead member shall\nlead the arbitration proceedings, would all point to the\nfact that the central management and control of this\nConsortium appears to be exercised in India and not\nin any foreign nation.\n\n19. This being the case, we dismiss the petition filed\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Act, as there is no\n“international commercial arbitration” as defined\nunder\nSection 2(1)(f)\nof the Act for the petitioner to\ncome to this Court. We also do not deem it necessary\nto go into whether the appropriate stage for invoking\narbitration has yet been reached.”\n\n10. It was thus held that “Association” and “Body of individuals”\n\nreferred to in\nSection 2(1)(f)\nof the Act would be separate categories.\n\nHowever, the lead member of the Association\nin that case\nbeing an Indian\n\nentity, the “Central Management and Control” of the Association was held\n\nto be in a country other than India. Relying on said decision we conclude\n\nthat the lead member of the Consortium company i.e. Applicant No.1 being\n\nan Architectural Firm having its registered office in New York,\n\nrequirements of\nSection 2(1)(f)\nof the Act are satisfied and the arbitration\n\nin the present case would be an “International Commercial Arbitration”.\n\n11. That takes us to the second issue, namely, whether a case has been\n\nmade out for exercise of power by the Court for an appointment of an\n\narbitrator.\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n12. The communication invoking arbitration in terms of Clause 24 was\n\nsent by the Applicants on 28.06.2019 and the period within which the\n\nrespondent was to make the necessary appointment expired on 28.07.2019.\n\nThe next day was a working day but the appointment was made on\n\nTuesday, the 30th July, 2019. Technically, the appointment was not within\n\nthe time stipulated but such delay on part of the respondent could not be\n\nsaid to be an infraction of such magnitude that exercise of power by the\n\nCourt under\nSection 11\nof the Act merely on that ground is called for.\n\n13. However, the point that has been urged, relying upon the decision\n\nof this Court in Walter Bau AG3 and TRF Limited4, requires consideration.\n\nIn the present case Clause 24 empowers the Chairman and Managing\n\nDirector of the respondent to make the appointment of a sole arbitrator and\n\nsaid Clause also stipulates that no person other than a person appointed by\n\nsuch Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent would act as an\n\narbitrator. In TRF Limited4 , a Bench of three Judges of this Court, was\n\ncalled upon to consider whether the appointment of an arbitrator made by\n\nthe Managing Director of the respondent therein was a valid one and\n\nwhether at that stage an application moved under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\n\ncould be entertained by the Court. The relevant Clause, namely, Clause 33\n\nwhich provided for resolution of disputes\nin that case\nwas under:\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n“33. Resolution of dispute/arbitration\n\n(a) In case any disagreement or dispute arises\nbetween the buyer and the seller under or in\nconnection with the PO, both shall make\nevery effort to resolve it amicably by direct\ninformal negotiation.\n\n(b) If, even after 30 days from the\ncommencement of such informal negotiation,\nseller and the buyer have not been able to\nresolve the dispute amicably, either party may\nrequire that the dispute be referred for\nresolution to the formal mechanism of\narbitration.\n\n(c) All disputes which cannot be settled by\nmutual negotiation shall be referred to and\ndetermined by arbitration as per the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nas\namended.\n\n(d) Unless otherwise provided, any dispute or\ndifference between the parties in connection\nwith this agreement shall be referred to sole\narbitration of the Managing Director of buyer\nor his nominee. Venue of arbitration shall be\nDelhi, and the arbitration shall be conducted\nin English language.\n\n(e) The award of the Tribunal shall be final and\nbinding on both, buyer and seller.”\n\n14. In TRF Limited4, the Agreement was entered into before the\n\nprovisions of the\nAmending Act\n(Act No.3 of 2016) came into force. It\n\nwas submitted by the appellant that by virtue of the provisions of the\n\nAmending Act\nand insertion of the Fifth and Seventh Schedules in the Act,\n\nthe Managing Director of the respondent would be a person having direct\n\ninterest in the dispute and as such could not act as an arbitrator. The\n\nextension of the submission was that a person who himself was\n\ndisqualified and disentitled could also not nominate any other person to act\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nas an arbitrator. The submission countered by the respondent therein was\n\nas under: -\n\n“7.1. The submission to the effect that since the\nManaging Director of the respondent has become\nineligible to act as an arbitrator subsequent to the\namendment in the Act, he could also not have\nnominated any other person as arbitrator is absolutely\nunsustainable, for the Fifth and the Seventh Schedules\nfundamentally guide in determining whether\ncircumstances exist which give rise to justifiable\ndoubts as to the independence and impartiality of the\narbitrator. To elaborate, if any person whose\nrelationship with the parties or the counsel or the\nsubject-matter of dispute falls under any of the\ncategories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he is\nineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator but not\notherwise.\n\nThe issue was discussed and decided by this Court as under:-\n\n50. First, we shall deal with Clause (d). There is no\nquarrel that by virtue of\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act, if\nany person who falls under any of the categories\nspecified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible\nto be appointed as the arbitrator. There is no doubt\nand cannot be, for the language employed in the\nSeventh Schedule, the Managing Director of the\nCorporation has become ineligible by operation of\nlaw. It is the stand of the learned Senior Counsel for\nthe appellant that once the Managing Director\nbecomes ineligible, he also becomes ineligible to\nnominate. Refuting the said stand, it is canvassed by\nthe learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that the\nineligibility cannot extend to a nominee if he is not\nfrom the Corporation and more so when there is\napposite and requisite disclosure. We think it\nappropriate to make it clear that in the case at hand we\nare neither concerned with the disclosure nor\nobjectivity nor impartiality nor any such other\ncircumstance. We are singularly concerned with the\nissue, whether the Managing Director, after becoming\nineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nnominate an arbitrator. At the cost of repetition, we\nmay state that when there are two parties, one may\nnominate an arbitrator and the other may appoint\nanother. That is altogether a different situation. If\nthere is a clause requiring the parties to nominate their\nrespective arbitrator, their authority to nominate\ncannot be questioned. What really in that\ncircumstance can be called in question is the\nprocedural compliance and the eligibility of their\narbitrator depending upon the norms provided under\nthe Act and the Schedules appended thereto. But, here\nis a case where the Managing Director is the “named\nsole arbitrator” and he has also been conferred with\nthe power to nominate one who can be the arbitrator\nin his place. Thus, there is subtle distinction.\nIn this\nregard, our attention has been drawn to a two-Judge\nBench decision in\nState of Orissa v. Commr. of Land\nRecords & Settlement7\n. In the said case, the question\narose, can the Board of Revenue revise the order\npassed by its delegate. Dwelling upon the said\nproposition, the Court held: (SCC p. 173, para 25)\n“25. We have to note that the Commissioner\nwhen he exercises power of the Board delegated\nto him under\nSection 33\nof the Settlement Act,\n1958, the order passed by him is to be treated as\nan order of the Board of Revenue and not as that\nof the Commissioner in his capacity as\nCommissioner. This position is clear from two\nrulings of this Court to which we shall presently\nrefer.\n\nThe first of the said rulings is the one\ndecided by the Constitution Bench of this Court\nin\nRoop Chand v. State of Punjab8\n. In that case,\nit was held by the majority that where the State\nGovernment had, under\nSection 41(1)\nof the\nEast Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and\nPrevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948,\ndelegated its appellate powers vested in it under\n\nSection 21(4)\nto an “officer”, an order passed by\nsuch an officer was an order passed by the State\nGovernment itself and “not an order passed by\nany officer under this Act” within\nSection 42\nand\nwas not revisable by the State Government.\n\nIt\nwas pointed out that for the purpose of exercise\n7 (\n1998) 7 SCC 162\n8 AIR 1963 SC 1503\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nof powers of revision by the State under\nSection\nof that Act, the order sought to be revised\nmust be an order passed by an officer in his own\nright and not as a delegate of the State. The\nState Government was, therefore, not entitled\nunder\nSection 42\nto call for the records of the\ncase which was disposed of by an officer acting\nas its delegate.”\n(emphasis in original)\n\n51. Be it noted in the said case, reference was made to\n\nBehari Kunj Sahkari Awas Samiti v. State of U.P.9\n,\nwhich followed the decision in\nRoop Chand v. State\nof Punjab8\n. It is seemly to note here that the said\nprinciple has been followed in Indore Vikas\nPradhikaran10.\n\n52. Mr Sundaram has strongly relied on Pratapchand\nNopaji11. In the said case, the three-Judge Bench\napplied the maxim “qui facit per alium facit per se”.\nWe may profitably reproduce the passage: (SCC p.\n214, para 9)\n“9. … The principle which would apply, if the\nobjects are struck by\nSection 23\nof the Contract\nAct, is embodied in the maxim: “qui facit per\nalium facit per se” (what one does through\nanother is done by oneself). To put it in another\nform, that which cannot be done directly may\nnot be done indirectly by engaging another\noutside the prohibited area to do the illegal act\nwithin the prohibited area. It is immaterial\nwhether, for the doing of such an illegal act, the\nagent employed is given the wider powers or\nauthority of the “pucca adatia”, or, as the High\nCourt had held, he is clothed with the powers of\nan ordinary commission agent only.”\n\n53. The aforesaid authorities have been commended\nto us to establish the proposition that if the\n\n9 (1997) 7 SCC 37\n10 Indore Vikas Pradhikaran v. Pure Industrial Coke & Chemicals Ltd.,\n(\n2007) 8 SCC 705\n11 Pratapchand Nopaji v. Kotrike Venkata Setty & Sons\n, (\n1975) 2 SCC 208\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nnomination of an arbitrator by an ineligible arbitrator\nis allowed, it would tantamount to carrying on the\nproceeding of arbitration by himself. According to the\nlearned counsel for the appellant, ineligibility strikes\nat the root of his power to arbitrate or get it arbitrated\nupon by a nominee.\n\n54. In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy\nwould be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the\nManaging Director, nominate an arbitrator, who may\nbe otherwise eligible and a respectable person. As\nstated earlier, we are neither concerned with the\nobjectivity nor the individual respectability. We are\nonly concerned with the authority or the power of the\nManaging Director. By our analysis, we are obligated\nto arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator has\nbecome ineligible by operation of law, he cannot\nnominate another as an arbitrator. The arbitrator\nbecomes ineligible as per prescription contained in\n\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act. It is inconceivable in law\nthat person who is statutorily ineligible can nominate\na person. Needless to say, once the infrastructure\ncollapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse. One\ncannot have a building without the plinth. Or to put it\ndifferently, once the identity of the Managing Director\nas the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to nominate\nsomeone else as an arbitrator is obliterated. Therefore,\nthe view expressed by the High Court is not\nsustainable and we say so.”\n\n15. It was thus held that as the Managing Director became ineligible by\n\noperation of law to act as an arbitrator, he could not nominate another\n\nperson to act as an arbitrator and that once the identity of the Managing\n\nDirector as the sole arbitrator was lost, the power to nominate someone\n\nelse as an arbitrator was also obliterated. The relevant Clause in said case\n\nhad nominated the Managing Director himself to be the sole arbitrator and\n\nalso empowered said Managing Director to nominate another person to act\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nas an arbitrator. The Managing Director thus had two capacities under said\n\nClause, the first as an arbitrator and the second as an appointing authority.\n\nIn the present case we are concerned with only one capacity of the\n\nChairman and Managing Director and that is as an appointing authority.\n\nWe thus have two categories of cases. The first, similar to the one\n\ndealt with in TRF Limited4 where the Managing Director himself is named\n\nas an arbitrator with an additional power to appoint any other person as an\n\narbitrator. In the second category, the Managing Director is not to act as an\n\narbitrator himself but is empowered or authorised to appoint any other\n\nperson of his choice or discretion as an arbitrator. If, in the first category\n\nof cases, the Managing Director was found incompetent, it was because of\n\nthe interest that he would be said to be having in the outcome or result of\n\nthe dispute. The element of invalidity would thus be directly relatable to\n\nand arise from the interest that he would be having in such outcome or\n\ndecision. If that be the test, similar invalidity would always arise and\n\nspring even in the second category of cases. If the interest that he has in\n\nthe outcome of the dispute, is taken to be the basis for the possibility of\n\nbias, it will always be present irrespective of whether the matter stands\n\nunder the first or second category of cases. We are conscious that if such\n\ndeduction is drawn from the decision of this Court in TRF Limited4, all\n\ncases having clauses similar to that with which we are presently concerned,\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\na party to the agreement would be disentitled to make any appointment of\n\nan Arbitrator on its own and it would always be available to argue that a\n\nparty or an official or an authority having interest in the dispute would be\n\ndisentitled to make appointment of an Arbitrator.\n\n16. But, in our view that has to be the logical deduction from TRF\n\nLimited4. Paragraph 50 of the decision shows that this Court was\n\nconcerned with the issue, “whether the Managing Director, after becoming\n\nineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an Arbitrator”\n\nThe ineligibility referred to therein, was as a result of operation of law, in\n\nthat a person having an interest in the dispute or in the outcome or decision\n\nthereof, must not only be ineligible to act as an arbitrator but must also not\n\nbe eligible to appoint anyone else as an arbitrator and that such person\n\ncannot and should not have any role in charting out any course to the\n\ndispute resolution by having the power to appoint an arbitrator. The next\n\nsentences in the paragraph, further show that cases where both the parties\n\ncould nominate respective arbitrators of their choice were found to be\n\ncompletely a different situation. The reason is clear that whatever\n\nadvantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice\n\nwould get counter balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a\n\ncase where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice\n\nwill always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\ncourse for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in\n\nthe outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint\n\na sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments\n\nbrought in by the\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n\n(Act 3 of 2016) and recognised by the decision of this Court in TRF\n\nLimited4.\n\n17. We must also at this stage refer to the following observations made\n\nby this Court in para 48 of its decision in\nIndian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. Raja\n\nTransport (P) Ltd.12\n, which were in the context that was obtaining before\n\nAct 3 of 2016 had come into force: -\n\n“48. In the light of the above discussion, the scope of\n\nSection 11\nof the Act containing the scheme of\nappointment of arbitrators may be summarised thus:\n\n(i) Where the agreement provides for arbitration with\nthree arbitrators (each party to appoint one arbitrator\nand the two appointed arbitrators to appoint a third\narbitrator), in the event of a party failing to appoint an\narbitrator within 30 days from the receipt of a request\nfrom the other party (or the two nominated arbitrators\nfailing to agree on the third arbitrator within 30 days\nfrom the date of the appointment), the Chief Justice or\nhis designate will exercise power under sub-section\n(4) of\nSection 11\nof the Act.\n\n(ii) Where the agreement provides for arbitration by a\nsole arbitrator and the parties have not agreed upon\nany appointment procedure, the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate will exercise power under sub-section (5) of\n\nSection 11\n, if the parties fail to agree on the\n\n12 (\n2009) 8 SCC 520\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\narbitration within thirty days from the receipt of a\nrequest by a party from the other party.\n\n(iii) Where the arbitration agreement specifies the\nappointment procedure, then irrespective of whether\nthe arbitration is by a sole arbitrator or by a three-\nmember Tribunal, the Chief Justice or his designate\nwill exercise power under sub-section (6) of\nSection\n, if a party fails to act as required under the agreed\nprocedure (or the parties or the two appointed\narbitrators fail to reach an agreement expected of\nthem under the agreed procedure or any\nperson/institution fails to perform any function\nentrusted to him/it under that procedure).\n\n(iv) While failure of the other party to act within 30\ndays will furnish a cause of action to the party seeking\narbitration to approach the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate in cases falling under sub-sections (4) and\n(5), such a time-bound requirement is not found in\nsub-section (6) of\nSection 11\n. The failure to act as per\nthe agreed procedure within the time-limit prescribed\nby the arbitration agreement, or in the absence of any\nprescribed time-limit, within a reasonable time, will\nenable the aggrieved party to file a petition under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n(v) Where the appointment procedure has been agreed\nbetween the parties, but the cause of action for\ninvoking the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate under clauses (a), (b) or (c) of sub-section\n(6) has not arisen, then the question of the Chief\nJustice or his designate exercising power under sub-\nsection (6) does not arise. The condition precedent for\napproaching the Chief Justice or his designate for\ntaking necessary measures under sub-section (6) is\nthat\n\n(i) a party failing to act as required under the\nagreed appointment procedure; or\n\n(ii) the parties (or the two appointed arbitrators)\nfailing to reach an agreement expected of them\nunder the agreed appointment procedure; or\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n(iii) a person/institution who has been entrusted\nwith any function under the agreed appointment\nprocedure, failing to perform such function.\n\n(vi) The Chief Justice or his designate while\nexercising power under sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\n\nshall endeavour to give effect to the appointment\nprocedure prescribed in the arbitration clause.\n\n(vii) If circumstances exist, giving rise to justifiable\ndoubts as to the independence and impartiality of the\nperson nominated, or if other circumstances warrant\nappointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring\nthe procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate may, for reasons to be recorded ignore the\ndesignated arbitrator and appoint someone else.”\n\n18. Sub para (vii) of aforesaid paragraph 48 lays down that if there are\n\njustifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person\n\nnominated, and if other circumstances warrant appointment of an\n\nindependent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, such\n\nappointment can be made by the Court. It may also be noted that on the\n\nissue of necessity and desirability of impartial and independent arbitrators\n\nthe matter was considered by the Law Commission in its report No.246.\n\nParagraphs 53 to 60 under the heading “Neutrality of Arbitrators” are\n\nquoted in the Judgment of this Court in Voestapline Schienen Gmbh v.\n\nDelhi Metro Rail Corpn. Ltd.13, while paras 59 and 60 of the report stand\n\nextracted in the decision of this Court in\nBharat Broadband Network\n\n13 (2017) 4 SCC 665\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nLimited v. United Telecoms Limited14\n. For the present purposes, we may\n\nrely on paragraph 57, which is to the following effect:-\n\n“57. The balance between procedural fairness and\nbinding nature of these contracts, appears to have\nbeen tilted in favour of the latter by the Supreme\nCourt, and the Commission believes the present\nposition of law is far from satisfactory. Since the\nprinciples of impartiality and independence cannot be\ndiscarded at any stage of the proceedings, specifically\nat the stage of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, it\nwould be incongruous to say that party autonomy can\nbe exercised in complete disregard of these principles\n— even if the same has been agreed prior to the\ndisputes having arisen between the parties. There are\ncertain minimum levels of independence and\nimpartiality that should be required of the arbitral\nprocess regardless of the parties’ apparent agreement.\nA sensible law cannot, for instance, permit\nappointment of an arbitrator who is himself a party to\nthe dispute, or who is employed by (or similarly\ndependent on) one party, even if this is what the\nparties agreed. The Commission hastens to add that\nMr P.K. Malhotra, the ex officio member of the Law\nCommission suggested having an exception for the\nState, and allow State parties to appoint employee\narbitrators. The Commission is of the opinion that, on\nthis issue, there cannot be any distinction between\nState and non-State parties. The concept of party\nautonomy cannot be stretched to a point where it\nnegates the very basis of having impartial and\nindependent adjudicators for resolution of disputes. In\nfact, when the party appointing an adjudicator is the\nState, the duty to appoint an impartial and\nindependent adjudicator is that much more onerous\n— and the right to natural justice cannot be said to\nhave been waived only on the basis of a “prior”\nagreement between the parties at the time of the\ncontract and before arising of the disputes.”\n\n14 (\n2019) 5 SCC 755\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n19. In Voestalpine3, this Court dealt with independence and\n\nimpartiality of the arbitrator as under:\n\n“20. Independence and impartiality of the arbitrator\nare the hallmarks of any arbitration proceedings. Rule\nagainst bias is one of the fundamental principles of\nnatural justice which applied to all judicial and quasi-\njudicial proceedings. It is for this reason that\nnotwithstanding the fact that relationship between the\nparties to the arbitration and the arbitrators themselves\nare contractual in nature and the source of an\narbitrator’s appointment is deduced from the\nagreement entered into between the parties,\nnotwithstanding the same non-independence and non-\nimpartiality of such arbitrator (though contractually\nagreed upon) would render him ineligible to conduct\nthe arbitration. The genesis behind this rational is that\neven when an arbitrator is appointed in terms of\ncontract and by the parties to the contract, he is\nindependent of the parties. Functions and duties\nrequire him to rise above the partisan interest of the\nparties and not to act in, or so as to further, the\nparticular interest of either parties. After all, the\narbitrator has adjudicatory role to perform and,\ntherefore, he must be independent of parties as well as\nimpartial. The United Kingdom Supreme Court has\nbeautifully highlighted this aspect in Hashwani v.\nJivraj15 in the following words: (WLR p. 1889, para\n\n45)\n\n“45. … the dominant purpose of appointing an\narbitrator or arbitrators is the impartial\nresolution of the dispute between the parties in\naccordance with the terms of the agreement and,\nalthough the contract between the parties and the\narbitrators would be a contract for the provision\nof personal services, they were not personal\nservices under the direction of the parties.”\n\n15 (2011) 1 WLR 1872; 2011\nUKSC 40\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n21. Similarly, Cour de Cassation, France, in a\njudgment delivered in 1972 in Consorts Ury,\nunderlined that:\n\n“an independent mind is indispensable in the exercise\nof judicial power, whatever the source of that power\nmay be, and it is one of the essential qualities of an\narbitrator.”\n\n22. Independence and impartiality are two different\nconcepts. An arbitrator may be independent and yet,\nlack impartiality, or vice versa. Impartiality, as is well\naccepted, is a more subjective concept as compared to\nindependence. Independence, which is more an\nobjective concept, may, thus, be more\nstraightforwardly ascertained by the parties at the\noutset of the arbitration proceedings in light of the\ncircumstances disclosed by the arbitrator, while\npartiality will more likely surface during the\narbitration proceedings.\n\n……. ….. ……\n\n30. Time has come to send positive signals to the\ninternational business community, in order to create\nhealthy arbitration environment and conducive\narbitration culture in this country. Further, as\nhighlighted by the Law Commission also in its report,\nduty becomes more onerous in government contracts,\nwhere one of the parties to the dispute is the\nGovernment or public sector undertaking itself and\nthe authority to appoint the arbitrator rests with it. In\nthe instant case also, though choice is given by\nDMRC to the opposite party but it is limited to choose\nan arbitrator from the panel prepared by DMRC. It,\ntherefore, becomes imperative to have a much\nbroadbased panel, so that there is no misapprehension\nthat principle of impartiality and independence would\nbe discarded at any stage of the proceedings, specially\nat the stage of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.\nWe, therefore, direct that DMRC shall prepare a\nbroadbased panel on the aforesaid lines, within a\nperiod of two months from today.”\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\n20. In the light of the aforestated principles, the report of the Law\n\nCommission and the decision in Voestapline Schienen Gmbh13, the\n\nimperatives of creating healthy arbitration environment demand that the\n\ninstant application deserves acceptance.\n\n21. The further question that arises is whether the power can be\n\nexercised by this Court under\nSection 11\nof the Act when the appointment\n\nof an arbitrator has already been made by the respondent and whether the\n\nappellant should be left to raise challenge at an appropriate stage in terms\n\nof remedies available in law. Similar controversy was gone into by a\n\nDesignated Judge of this Court in Walter Bau AG3 and the discussion on\n\nthe point was as under:-\n\n“9. While it is correct that in Antrix16 and Pricol\nLtd.17, it was opined by this Court that after\nappointment of an arbitrator is made, the remedy of\nthe aggrieved party is not under\nSection 11(6)\nbut\nsuch remedy lies elsewhere and under different\nprovisions of the\nArbitration Act\n(\nSections 12\nand\n),\nthe context in which the aforesaid view was expressed\ncannot be lost sight of. In Antrix16, appointment of the\narbitrator, as per the ICC Rules, was as per the\nalternative procedure agreed upon, whereas in Pricol\nLtd.17., the party which had filed the application under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act had already\nsubmitted to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. In the\npresent case, the situation is otherwise.\n\n10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie\nvalid and such appointment satisfies the Court\n\n16 (\n2014) 11 SCC 560\n17 (2015) 4 SCC 177\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nexercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act, acceptance of such appointment as a\nfait accompli to debar the jurisdiction under\nSection\n11(6)\ncannot be countenanced in law. In the present\ncase, the agreed upon procedure between the parties\ncontemplated the appointment of the arbitrator by the\nsecond party within 30 days of receipt of a notice\nfrom the first party. While the decision in Datar\nSwitchgears Ltd.18 may have introduced some\nflexibility in the time frame agreed upon by the\nparties by extending it till a point of time anterior to\nthe filing of the application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act, it cannot be lost sight of that in the\npresent case the appointment of Shri Justice A.D.\nMane is clearly contrary to the provisions of the Rules\ngoverning the appointment of arbitrators by ICADR,\nwhich the parties had agreed to abide by in the matter\nof such appointment. The option given to the\nrespondent Corporation to go beyond the panel\nsubmitted by ICADR and to appoint any person of its\nchoice was clearly not in the contemplation of the\nparties. If that be so, obviously, the appointment of\nShri Justice A.D. Mane is non est in law. Such an\nappointment, therefore, will not inhibit the exercise of\njurisdiction by this Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act. It cannot, therefore, be held that the\npresent proceeding is not maintainable in law. The\nappointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane made beyond\n30 days of the receipt of notice by the petitioner,\nthough may appear to be in conformity with the law\n\nlaid down in\nDatar Switchgears Ltd18., is clearly\ncontrary to the agreed procedure which required the\nappointment made by the respondent Corporation to\nbe from the panel submitted by ICADR. The said\nappointment, therefore, is clearly invalid in law.”\n\n22. It may be noted here that the aforesaid view of the Designated\n\nJudge in Walter Bau AG3 was pressed into service on behalf of the\n\nappellant in TRF Limited4 and the opinion expressed by the\nDesignated\n\n18 (2000) 8 SCC 151\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nJudge was found to be in consonance with the binding authorities of this\n\nCourt. It was observed:-\n\n“32. Mr Sundaram, learned Senior Counsel for the\nappellant has also drawn inspiration from the\njudgment passed by the Designated Judge of this\nCourt in Walter Bau AG3, where the learned Judge,\nafter referring to Antrix Corpn. Ltd16. , distinguished\nthe same and also distinguished the authority in\n\nPricol Ltd. v. Johnson Controls Enterprise Ltd.17\nand\ncame to hold that: (Walter Bau AG case3, SCC p. 806,\npara 10)\n\n“10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex\nfacie valid and such appointment satisfies the\nCourt exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Arbitration Act, acceptance of such\nappointment as a fait accompli to debar the\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be\ncountenanced in law. …”\n\n33. We may immediately state that the opinion\nexpressed in the aforesaid case is in consonance with\nthe binding authorities we have referred to\nhereinbefore.”\n\n23. In TRF Limited4, the Managing Director of the respondent had\n\nnominated a former Judge of this Court as sole arbitrator in terms of\n\naforesaid Clause 33(d), after which the appellant had preferred an\n\napplication under\nSection 11(5)\nread with\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. The\n\nplea was rejected by the High Court and the appeal therefrom on the issue\n\nwhether the Managing Director could nominate an arbitrator was decided\n\nin favour of the appellant as stated hereinabove. As regards the issue about\n\nfresh appointment, this Court remanded the matter to the High Court for\n\nArbitration Application No.32 of 2019\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC & Anr. v. HSCC (India) Ltd\n.\nfresh consideration as is discernible from para 55 of the Judgment. In the\n\nlight of these authorities there is no hindrance in entertaining the instant\n\napplication preferred by the Applicants.\n\n24. It is also clear from the Clause in the instant case that no special\n\nqualifications such as expertise in any technical field are required of an\n\narbitrator. This was fairly accepted by the learned Senior Counsel for the\n\nrespondent.\n\n25. In the aforesaid circumstances, in our view a case is made out to\n\nentertain the instant application preferred by the Applicants.
