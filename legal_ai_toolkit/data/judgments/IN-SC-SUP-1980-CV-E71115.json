The rules provide for\nthe direct recruitment as well as appointment by promotion\nfrom the Punjab Civil Service (Judicial branch). Under rule\n8(2), two third of the total number of cadre posts have to\nbe manned by promoted officers and one-third by direct\nrecruits. Under rule 10(1) direct recruits have to remain on\nprobation for two years provided that the Government may, in\nexceptional circumstances, reduce the period of probation in\nconsultation with the High Court. The period of probation of\nan officer can be extended by the Governor beyond the period\nof two years in consultation with the High Court but not so\nas to exceed a total period of three years. Rule 10(2)\nempowers the Governor to confirm in consultation with the\nHigh Court a direct recruit on a cadre post with effect from\na date not earlier than the date on which he completes the\nperiod of probation. Rule 12 (now in force in Haryana)\nprovides that the seniority of direct recruits and promoted\nofficers shall be determined with reference to the\nrespective dates of their confirmation.\nUnder the Punjab Rules as amended retrospectively with\neffect from April 9, 1976 'cadre post' means a permanent as\nwell as a temporary post in the service. The inter se\nseniority of the members of the service is to be deter mined\nby the length of continuous service on a post in the service\nirrespective of the date of confirmation.\nThe three petitioners in the Haryana writ petitions\nwere selected for recruitment to the Punjab Civil Service\n(Judicial Branch) in a competitive examination and after the\nformation of the State of Haryana, they were promoted in an\nofficiating capacity to the Haryana Superior Judicial\nService in 1967 and 1968. Respondent No. 3 who was a direct\nrecruit to the Haryana Superior Judicial Service was\nappointed as a District and Sessions Judge on July 7,\n1970 and was confirmed in that post on July 7, 1972 on the\ncompletion of A two year probationary period. The three\npetitioners were confirmed as District and Sessions Judges\nwith effect from July 8, 1972.\nIn the case of judicial officers of Punjab, although\nthere were ten vacancies in the quota of promoted officers\nand an equal number of promoted officers were officiating\nfor more than three years as Additional District and\nSessions Judges, the High Court did not confirm the\npromotees in those vacancies but confirmed the promotees and\nthe direct recruits by applying the rule of rotational Six\ndirect recruits were given prior dates of confirmation in\ncomparison with the promotees, as a result of which the\nconfirmation of eight promotees was postponed. In the case\nof some direct recruits confirmation was given within a\nperiod of one year and four months though the period of\nprobation was two years.\nRule 12 was amended retrospectively from April 9, 1976\nby which seniority was to be determined by the length of\ncontinuous service on a post in the service irrespective of\nthe date of confirmation\nRejecting the plea of one of the direct recruits that\nthe rules not only required the application of a rule of\nquota at the time of appointment but also required the\napplication of a rule of rotation at the time of\nconfirmation, the High Court held that rules 8 and 12 were\nindependent of each other, that rotational system could not\nbe implicitly read in the quota rule provided for by rule 8\nand that members of the Superior Judicial Service were\nentitled to claim seniority strictly in accordance with the\nprovisions of rule 12. The promotees complained that this\ndecision rendered by the High Court in its judicial capacity\nwas not being followed by the High Court in the discharge of\nits administrative duties and that seniority of the\npromotees and direct recruits must be fixed without applying\nthe rule of rotation at the time of confirmation. It was\nalso stated that after the amendment of rule 12 in 1976\nalthough two vacancies of District and Sessions Judges arose\non each of these occasions the High Court promoted a direct\nrecruit treating the date of his confirmation as the\ncriterion of seniority.\nIt was contended on behalf of the promotees in Haryana\nthat the control which the High Court exercises under\nArt.\nover the subordinate judiciary does not include the\npower to make rules regulating the condition of service of\njudicial officers but that since the power conferred on the\nGovernor under the proviso to\nArt. 309\nto make rules is\nlegislative in nature the principle of independence of\njudiciary is not in any manner violated when the Governor\nmakes the rules. On the other hand it was contended on\nbehalf of the High Court that the control over the\nsubordinate judiciary vested in the High Court by\nArt. 235\n\nbeing exclusive in nature, the power to frame rules in\nregard to the seniority of judicial officers must reside in\nthe High Court and not in the Governor.\nIt was contended on behalf of the promotees that the\nquota of 2: 1 provided for by rule 8 is applicable only at\nthe time of initial recruitment and that there was no\nwarrant for extending the application of that rule at the\ntime of confirmation.\nPartly allowing the Petitions;\n^\nHELD: There is no force in the contention that the\nGovernor has no power to make rules of seniority of District\nand Sessions Judges. [1058B]\nOn a plain reading of Arts. 235 and 309 of the\nConstitution it is clear that the power to frame rules\nregarding seniority of officers in the judicial service of\nthe State is vested in the Governor and not in the High\nCourt. The first part of\nArt. 235\nvests the control over\nDistrict Courts and courts subordinate thereto in the High\nCourt. But the second part of that Article says that nothing\nin the article shall be construed as taking away from any\nperson belonging to the judicial service of the State any\nright of appeal which he may have under the law regulating\nthe conditions of his service or as authorising the High\nCourt to deal with him otherwise than in accordance with the\nconditions of his service prescribed under such law. Thus,\n\nArt. 235\nitself defines the outer-limits of the High Court's\npower of control over the District Courts and courts\nsubordinate thereto. In the first place, in the exercise of\nits control over the District Courts and subordinate courts\nit is not open to the High Court to deny to a member of the\nsubordinate judicial service of the State the right of\nappeal given to him by the law which regulates the\nconditions of his service. Secondly, the High Court cannot,\nin the exercise of its power of control, deal with such\nperson otherwise than in accordance with the conditions of\nhis service which are prescribed by such law. [1052C]\nThere is no power in the High Court to pass a law\nthough rules made by the High Court in the exercise of power\nconferred upon it in that behalf may have the force of law.\nLaw which the second part of\nArt. 235\nspeaks of is law made\nby the Legislature. The clear meaning, therefore, of the\nsecond part of\nArt. 235\nis that the power of control vested\nin the High Court by the first part will not deprive a\njudicial officer of the rights conferred upon him by a law\nmade by the Legislature regulating his conditions of\nservice. [1052G-H]\n\nArticle 235\ndoes not confer upon the High Courts the\npower to make rules relating to conditions of service of\njudicial officers attached to District Courts and the courts\nsubordinate thereto. Whenever it was intended to confer on\nany authority the power to make any special provision or\nrules including rules relating to conditions of service, the\nConstitution has stated so in express terms. For example the\nprovisions contained in\nArticles 225\n, 227(2)\n\n& (3)\nand\n\n229(1)\n\n& (2)\nconfer powers on the High Court to frame rules\nfor certain specific purposes.\nArt. 229(2)\nwhich is directly\nin point provides that subject to the provisions of any law\nmade by Legislature of the State the conditions of service\nof officers of a High Court shall be made by the High Court.\nThe framers of the Constitution would not have failed to\nincorporate a similar provision in\nArt. 235\nif it was\nintended that the High Courts should have the power to make\nrules regulating the conditions of service of judicial\nofficers in the subordinate judiciary. [1053B-F]\nThe power of control vested in the High Court by\nArt.\nis expressly made subject to the law which the State\nLegislature may pass for regulating the recruitment and\nservice conditions of judicial officers of the State. The\nframers of the Constitution did not regard the power of the\nState Legislature to pass laws regulating the recruitment\nand conditions of service of judicial officers as an\ninfringement of the independence of the judiciary. The mere\npowers to pass such a law is not violative of the control\nvested in the High Court over the State judiciary. [1053H;\n1054C]\nIn order that there may be no vacuum until the passing\nof a law by the Legislature on the subject, the Constitution\nhas made provision under the proviso to\nArt. 309\nthat until\nthe State Legislature passes a law on the\nparticular subject, it shall be competent to the Governor of\nthe State to A make rules regulating the recruitment and\nconditions of service of the judicial officers of the State.\nThe power exercised by the Governor under the proviso is\nthus a power which the Legislature is competent to exercise\nbut has in fact not yet exercised. It partakes of the\ncharacteristics of the legislative, not executive, power. It\nis legislative power. [1054D-F]\nThat the Governor possesses legislative power under the\nConstitution is incontrovertible. Just as under\nArt. 213\nthe\nGovernor substitutes tor the Legislature because the\nLegislature is in recess so under the proviso to\nArt. 309\nhe\nsubstitutes for the Legislature because the Legislature has\nnot yet exercised its power to pass an appropriate law on\nthe subject. [1054G and 1055B-C]\nIt is true that the power conferred by\nArticle 309\nis\nsubject to the provisions of the Constitution but it is\nfallacious for that reason to contend that the Governor\ncannot frame rules regulating the recruitment and conditions\nof service of the Judicial officers of the State. Firstly,\nthe power of control conferred upon High Courts by the first\npart of\nArticle 235\nis expressly made subject, by the second\npart of that Article, to laws regulating conditions of\nservice of its Judicial officers. Secondly, the Governor, in\nterms equally express, is given the power by the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\nto frame rules on the subject. [1055B-C]\nA combined reading of Arts. 235 and 309 will yield the\nresult that though the control over the subordinate courts\nis vested in the High Court the appropriate Legislature and\nuntil that Legislature acts the Governor of the State has\nthe power to make rules regulating the recruitment and the\nconditions of service of judicial officers of the State. The\npower of the Legislature or of the Governor thus to\nlegislate is subject to all other provisions of the\nConstitution like Arts. 14 and 16. [1055D-E]\nThe second part of\nArt. 235\nrecognises the legislative\npower to provide for recruitment and the conditions of\nservice of the judicial officers of the State. The\nsubstantive provision of\nArt. 309\n, including its proviso,\nfixes the location of the power. The opening words of\nArt.\nlimit the amplitude of that power. [1055F]\nSeniority is undoubtedly an important condition of\nservice. The control vested in the High Court by the first\npart of\nArt. 235\nis, therefore subject to any law regulating\nseniority as envisaged by the second part of that article.\nThe power to make such law is vested by\nArt. 309\nin the\nLegislature and until it acts, in the Governor. Whether it\nis the Legislature which passes an Act or the Governor who\nmakes rules regulating seniority, the end product is law\nwithin the meaning of second part of\nArt. 235.\nThe\nLegislatures of Punjab and Haryana not having passed an Act\nregulating seniority of the respective State judicial\nofficers, the Governors of the two States have the power to\nframe rules for that purpose under the proviso to\nArt. 309\n\nof the Constitution Such rules are subject to the provisions\nof the Constitution and to the provisions of any Act which\nthe appropriate Legislature may pass on the subject. [1055G-\nH]\nThe law passed by the Legislature or the rules made by\nthe Governor can provide for general or abstract rules of\nseniority leaving it to the High Court to apply them to each\nindividual case as and when the occasion arises. The power\nto legislate on seniority being subject to all other\nprovisions of the Constitution cannot be exercised in a\nmanner which will affect or be detrimental to the control\nvested in the High Court by\nArt. 235.\n[1056B-C]\nThough the Legislature or the Governor has the power to\nregulate seniority of judicial officers by laying down rules\nof general application, that power cannot be exercised in a\nmanner which will lead to interference with the control\nvested in the High Court by the first part of\nArt. 235.\nIn a\nword, the application of law governing seniority must be\nleft to the High Court. The determination of seniority of\neach individual judicial officer is a matter which\nindubitably falls within the area of control of the High\nCourt over the district courts and the courts subordinate\nthereto. For the same reason, though rules of recruitment\ncan provide for a period of probation, the question whether\na particular judicial officer has satisfactorily completed\nhis probation or not is a matter which is exclusively in the\ndomain or the High Court to decide. [1056E-F]]\nThe independence of the judiciary has to be preserved.\nat all costs. But at the same time the Legislature or the\nGovernor cannot be deprived of their legitimate legislative\npowers under\nArt. 309.\nThat power is subject to all other\nprovisions of the Constitution which means that the power\ncannot be exercised in a manner which will lead to the\nviolation of Arts. 14 or 16 or the pervasive ambit of the\nfirst part of\nArt. 235.\nSince the power conferred by\nArt.\nis not absolute or untrammeled it will be wrong to test\nthe validity of that power on the anvil of its possible\nabuse. [1057 A-B]\nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana v. State of Haryana,\n[1975] 3 SCR 355, Union of India v. Justice S. H. Sheth,\n[1978] 1 S.C.R. 423., A. P. High Court v. Krishnamurthy,\n[1979] 1 S.C.R. 26 & State of Bihar v. Madan Mohan Prasad,\n[1976] 3 S.C.R. 110, referred to.\nRule 8 as its very heading shows, provides for a\ndistinct condition of ser vice with reference to a specific\npoint of time, namely \"recruitment to service\". The language\nof the rule also indicates that the operation of this rule\nis confined to the stage of initial recruitment to the\nservice either by promotion or by direct appointment from\nthe Bar. [1063F]\nThe reservation contemplated by rule 8 is intended to\nbe made at the stage of initial appointment only by\nreserving two third of the total number of posts in the\ncadre for promotees and one third for direct recruits. A\npost which falls vacant in the quota of promotees cannot be\nfiled by the confirmation of a direct recruit therein nor\nindeed can a promotee be confirmed in a post which is within\nthe quota of direct recruits. [1063H]\nIf this be the true construction of rule 8 the method\nof confirmation by rotation of direct recruits and\npromotees, regardless of whether the vacancy assigned to the\nparticular officer falls within the quota of the class to\nwhich he belongs will be in contravention of that rule.\n[1064B]\n'Appointment' is not a continuous process. The process\nof appointment is complete as soon as a person is initially\nrecruited to the service either by promotion or by direct\nrecruitment and confirmation is not a part of the process of\nappointment. \"Recruitment to the service\" is a matter which\nfalls within the power of the Governor under\nArt. 233\nwhile\n\"confirmation\" is a matter of 'control' vesting in the High\nCourt under\nArt. 235.\nThe superimposition of rule 8, which\nfixes the quota at the stage of recruitment on the rules\nrelating to confirmation and seniority is, therefore,\ncontrary to the basic constitutional concepts governing\njudicial service. [1064C-D]\nThe rule of rota cannot be read into the rule of quota.\nIn other words the ratio of 2: 1 shall have to be applied at\nthe stage of recruitment but cannot on the language of the\nrelevant rules be applied at the stage of confirmation.\n[1066B]\nA K. Subraman v. Union of India, [1975] 2 SCR 979, N.K.\nChauhan v. State of Gujarat, [1977] 1 SCR 1037 referred to.\nParamjit Singh Sandhu v. Ram Rakha, [1979] 3 SCR 584\nheld inapplicable.\nThe High Court was not justified in applying tho rule\nof rotation at the time of confirmation of the members of\nthe superior judicial service who were appointed to that\nservice by promotion and by direct recruitment. In the\ndischarge of its administrative functions the High Court\ncould not have failed to follow a judgment of its own\nspecial bench consisting of five Judges. [1066C-D]\nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana v. State of Haryana,\n[1975] 3 S.C.R. 365, referred to.\nOn a proper interpretation of the rules, promotees are\nentitled to be confirmed in the vacancies which are\navailable within their quota of two third, whether or not\none third of the vacancies are occupied by confirmed direct\nrecruits. Similarly direct recruits are entitled to be\nconfirmed in vacancies which are available within their\nquota of one third whether or not two third of the vacancies\nare occupied by confirmed promotees. [1067D-E]\nThe fairness which Arts. 14 and 16 postulate is that it\na promotee is otherwise fit for confirmation and a vacancy\nfalling within the quota of promotees is available in which\nhe can be confirmed, his confirmation ought not to be\npostponed until a direct recruit, whether yet appointed or\nnot, completes his period of probation and thereupon becomes\neligible for confirmation. The adoption of this principle in\nthe matter of confirmation will not, in practice, give any\nundue advantage to the promotees. [1067D-E].\nIn so far as the confirmation of respondents 6, 7 and 8\nis concerned, in the absence of exceptional circumstances\njustifying the reduction of their normal probationary period\nof two years, the order of the High Court confirming he\nthree respondents before they were normally due for\nconfirmation cannot be upheld. The order is in clear\nviolation of the guarantee of equal opportunity, by the\npetitioners were prejudiced and must for that reason be sel\naside. [1067G-H]\nThe power conferred by the proviso to rule 10(1) on the\nGovernor is ex-facie bad because such a power directly\nimpinges upon the control vested in the High Court by\nArt.\nof the Constitution. If at all any authority could\nexercise such a power, it is the High Court and not the\nGovernor. The rules must now be understood to mean that the\nHigh Court and not the Governor has the power of\nconfirmation, that the normal period of probation of direct\nrecruits is two years and that unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances in regard to each individual case, a direct\nrecruit cannot be confirmed from a date earlier than the\ndate on which he has satisfactorily completed his probation\nof two years. The High Court is not free to fix any period\nof probation as it likes or to reduce the period of two\nyears at its will and pleasure. [1068B-E]\nAs regards The power of the Governor to amend a rule\nwith retrospective effect, since he exercises a legislative\npower under proviso to\nArt. 309\nit is open to him to give\nretrospective effect to the rules made under that provision.\nBut the date from which the rules are made to operate must\nbe shown to bear\neither from the face of the rules or by extrinsic evidence\nreasonable nexus with the provisions contained in the rules,\nespecially when the retrospective effect extends over a long\nperiod. In the instant case rule 12 which was amended\nretrospectively from April 9, 1976 by a notification dated\nDecember 31, 1976 is invalid because no such nexus is shown\nto exist. [1068F-H]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition Nos. 4228-4230 of\n1978 and 266 of 1979.\n\n(Under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution)\nV. M. Tarkunde, O. P. Malhotra, K. N.

Sen and Mrs. Urmila Kapoor for R. 1 in WP 266/79.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCHANDRACHUD, C.J.-These Writ Petitions under\nArticle 32\n\nof the Constitution involve the consideration of a two-fold\ncontroversy: first, as to the rules governing seniority\nbetween direct recruits and promotees appointed to the\nSuperior Judicial Services of Punjab and Haryana and second,\nbetween the control over district courts and subordinate\ncourts vested in the High Court by\nArt. 235\nand the power\nconferred upon the Governor by the proviso to\nArt. 309\nof\nthe Constitution to make rules regulating the recruitment\nand conditions of service of persons appointed, inter alia,\nto the Judicial Service of the State.\n\nWe have two sets of Writ Petitions before us which\ninvolve identical points except for one material difference\nwhich we will mention later. Writ Petitions 4228 to 4230 of\n1978 are filed by three judicial officers of the State of\nHaryana who are promotees, that is to say, who were promoted\nto the Superior Judicial Service of the State\nfrom the Haryana Civil Service (Judicial Branch).\nRespondents 1 and 2 to those Writ Petitions are the State of\nHaryana and the High Court of Punjab and Haryana\nrespectively. Respondent 3, Shri N. S. Rao, is a direct\nrecruit, having been appointed from the Bar to the Haryana\nSuperior Judicial Service. Writ Petition 266 of 1979 is\nfiled by twenty-two promotees, that is to say, those who\nwere promoted to the Punjab Superior Judicial Service from\nthe Punjab Civil Service (Judicial Branch). Respondents 1\nand 2 to that petition are the State of Punjab and the High\nCourt of Punjab and Haryana respectively. Respondents 3 to\n11 were appointed directly from the Bar to the Punjab\nSuperior Judicial Service.\n\nSome of the more important grievances of the\npetitioners are that their seniority qua direct recruits is\nwrongly and unjustly made to depend upon the fortuitous\ncircumstance of the date of their confirmation in the\nSuperior Judicial Service; that even if a substantive\nvacancy is available, the confirmation of a promotee in that\nvacancy is postponed arbitrarily and indefinitely, that\npromotees are treated with an unequal hand qua direct\nrecruits: for example, a promotee, despite his satisfactory\nperformance and the availability of a substantive vacancy in\nwhich he can be confirmed, is continued in an officiating\ncapacity until after a direct recruit completes his\nprobation and is due for confirmation, and that, the High\nCourt applies the principle of rotation as between promotees\nand direct recruits at the time of their confirmation when,\nin fact, that the relevant rules provide for is the\napplication of a rule of quota at the time of their\nappointment.\n\nThese grievances of the promotees can best be\nunderstood in the light of the following facts: The three\npetitioners in the Haryana Writ Petitions were selected for\nrecruitment to the Punjab Civil Service (Judicial Branch)\nafter qualifying in a competitive examination. They were\nappointed as Subordinate Judges in 1950. By Act 3 of 1966,\nthe State of Haryana came into existence on November li\n1966. Petitioners 1 and 2-Shri B. S. Yadav and Shri V. P.\nAggarwal- were promoted in an officiating capacity to the\nHaryana Superior Judicial Service on July 28 and October 7,\n1967 respectively, while petitioner No. 3 Shri A. N.\nAggarwal, was promoted similarly on March 27, 1968.\nRespondent 3, Shri N. S. Rao who as a member of the Bar was\nworking as a District Attorney, was appointed directly to\nthe Haryana Superior Judicial Service with effect from July\n7, 1970. The normal period of his two years' probation\nexpired on July 7, 1972 but before the issuance of the\norders of his confirmation, a complaint dated August 2, 1977\nwas received against him. That complaint was inquired into\nby a High Court Judge who, by his report of March 1973, held\nit to be unfounded. Respondent 3\nwas thereupon confirmed by the High Court as a District and\nSessions Judge with effect from March 30, 1973. By a\nnotification dated May 4, 1973 that date was corrected to\nJuly 7, 1972 being the date on which Respondent 3 completed\nthe two years' probationary period. By the same\nnotification, the High Court confirmed the Petitioners and\ntwo other promotees as District and Sessions Judges with\neffect from July 8, 1972. Thus, the petitioners, who were\nofficiating continuously in the Superior Judicial Service of\nthe State as Additional District and Sessions Judges for two\nor three years prior to the appointment of Respondent 3\ndirectly to that service, lost their seniority over him by\nbeing allotted a date of confirmation which was one day\nlater than the date on which he completed his probationary\nperiod.\n\n(A small digression will be permissible here. The\nGovernment of Haryana was unwilling to concede to the High\nCourt the right to confirm a Judicial officer. It\ndisregarded the High Court's order whereby Shri N. S. Rao\nwas confirmed and passed an order reverting him to the post\nof a District Attorney which he was holding at the time of\nhis appointment as a District and Sessions Judge. Rao filed\na Writ Petition in the High Court to challenge the order of\nthe Government. The High Court set aside his reversion on\ncertain other grounds but it held by a majority (N. S. Rao\nv. State of Haryana that the power to confirm a direct\nrecruit vested in the Governor and not in the High Court.\nA\nConstitution Bench or this Court reversed the view of the\nHigh Court and held by a unanimous judgment (High Court of\n\nPunjab and Haryana v. State of Haryana\n), that the power to\nconfirm a District and Sessions Judge resides in the High\nCourt and not in the Governor).\n\nIn the Punjab Writ Petition, the contesting parties are\ntwenty-two promotees who have filed the writ petition and\nRespondents 3 to 11 who were appointed directly to the\nPunjab Superior Judicial Service. Petitioner No. 1, Shri\nPritpal Singh, was promoted to that Service on November 12,\n1969 when he was 44 years of age. Respondent 3, Shri J. S.\nSekhon, was appointed directly to that Service on February\n1, 1973 when he was 41 years of age. The former, though\npromoted to the Superior Judicial Service more than three\nyears before the appointment of Respondent 3, was confirmed\non February 3, 1975 which was one day later than February 2,\n1975 on which date Respondent 3 was confirmed on the\ncompletion of his two years' probation. The grievance of\nPetitioner No. 1 is that a permanent vacancy was available\non December 23, 1972 in which\nhe could have been confirmed but the High Court marked time\nin order to enable Respondent 3 to complete his probation\nand gave to Petitioner 1 an arbitrary and artificial date of\nconfirmation in order that he may not rank higher in\nseniority to Respondent 3.\n\nThe case of Petitioner 1 in the Punjab Writ Petition is\nillustrative of the grievance of the other petitioners.\nPetitioners 2 to 6 were Promoted to the Superior Judicial\nService between January 1972 and August 1972. Petitioner 7\nwas promoted in April 1973, Petitioners 8 to 10 in August\n1974, Petitioners 11 to 16 in 1975, Petitioner 17 in 1976,\nPetitioners 18 to 20 in 1977 and Petitioners 21 and 22 in\n1978. Respondents 4 and 5 were recruited directly in January\n1973 and were confirmed in February 1975 on the completion\nof the probationary period. Their confirmation is open to no\nexception but, Petitioners 2 and 3 Shri Amarjit Chopra and\nShri H. S. Ahluwalia who were promoted on January 16 and\nAugust 21, 1972 were confirmed on August 6 and August 7,\n1975 respectively. The significance of these dates of\nconfirmation becomes apparent in relation to the\nconfirmation of respondents 6 and 7. Having been appointed\ndirectly to the Superior Judicial Service on the 1st and 2nd\nof April 1975, they were confirmed on the 2nd and 5th August\n1976 respectively, which was even before they had completed\ntheir probationary period. Petitioners 2 and 3 who were\npromoted to the Superior Judicial Service roughly three\nyears prior to the direct appointment of Respondents 6 and 7\nwere confirmed on the 6th and 7th August, 1976 which was\nthree or four days later than the dates of confirmation\nallotted to Respondents 6 and 7. Petitioners 4 to 22 whose\ndates of promotion to the Superior Judicial Service range\nbetween August 1972 and July 1978 were not yet confirmed\nwhen the Writ Petition was filed on February 27, 1979.\n\nDo the rules which apply to the members of the Superior\nJudicial Services of Punjab and Haryana warrant this course\nof action and how far are the rules valid ? For deciding\nthese questions we must necessarily have a look at the\nrelevant rules.\n\nThe recruitment to the Punjab Superior Judicial Service\nand the other conditions of service of the members thereof\nare regulated by the \"Punjab Superior Judicial Service\nRules, 1963\" as amended from time to time. These rules were\noriginally framed by the Governor of Punjab in consultation\nwith the Punjab High Court, in exercise of the powers\nconferred on the Governor by the proviso to\nArt. 309\nof the\nConstitution. By that proviso, the Governor has the power to\nmake Rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of\nservice of persons appointed to services and posts in\nconnection with the affairs of the State\nRules 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 of the aforesaid\nrules which are relevant for the present purposes read as\nfollows in so far as they are material:\n\nRule 2: Definitions.-(1) 'appointment to the\nservice' means an appointment to a cadre post, whether\non permanent, temporary or officiating basis, or on\nprobation;\n\n(2) 'cadre post' means a permanent post in the\nService;\n\n(6) 'member of the Service' means a person-\n\n(a) who immediately before the commencement of\nthese rules, holds a cadre post, whether on\npermanent, temporary or officiating basis, or\non probation; or\n\n(b) who is appointed to a cadre post in\naccordance with the provisions of these\nrules;\n\n(7) 'Promoted officer' means a person-\n\n(a) who is not a direct recruit and is holding a\ncadre-post whether on permanent, temporary or\nofficiating basis or on probation,\nimmediately before the commencement of these\nrules; or\n\n(b) who is appointed to the Service by promotion\nfrom Punjab Civil Service (Judicial Branch).\n\nRule 4: Appointing Authority-All appointments to\nthe Service shall be made by the Governor in\nconsultation with the High Court.\n\nRule 8: Recruitment to service-(1) Recruitment to\nthe Service shall be made-\n\n(i) by promotion from the Punjab Civil Service\n(Judicial Branch); or\n\n(ii) by direct recruitment.\n\n(2) of the total number of cadre-posts, two-third\nshall be manned by promoted officers and one-\n\nthird by direct recruits:\n\nProvided that nothing in this sub-rule shall\nprevent the officiating appointment of a member of the\nprovincial Civil Service (Judicial Branch) on any post\nwhich is to be filled up by direct recruitment, till a\ndirect recruit is appointed.\n\nRule 9: Appointment of direct recruits.-(1) No\nperson shall be eligible for direct recruitment unless\nhe-\n\n(i) is not less than 35 years and not more than\n45 years of age on the first day of January\nnext following the year in which his\nappointment is made;\n(ii) has been for not less than 7 years an\nAdvocate or a pleader and is recommended by\nthe High Court for such appointment\n(2) No person who is recommended by the High Court\nfor appointment under sub-rule (i) shall be appointed\nunless he is found physically fit by a Medical Board\nset up by the Governor and is also found suitable for\nappointment in all other respects.\n\nRule 10: Probation.-(1) Direct recruits to the\nService shall remain on probation for a period of two\nyears, which may be so extended by the Governor in\nconsultation with the High Court, as not to exceed a\ntotal period of three years;\n\n(2) on the completion of the period of probation\nthe Governor may, in consultation with the High Court,\nconfirm a direct recruit on a cadre-post with effect\nfrom a date not earlier than the date on which he\ncompletes the period of probation;\n\n(3) If the work or conduct of a direct recruit\nhas, in the opinion of the Governor, not been\nsatisfactory he may, at any time, during the period of\nprobation or the extended period of probation, if any,\nin consultation with the High Court, and without\nassigning any reason, dispense with the services of\nsuch direct recruits.\n\nRule 11: Reversion of promoted officers the work\nof E a promoted officer officiating on a cadre-post\nhas, in the opinion of the Governor, not been\nsatisfactory, he may, at any time during the period of\nofficiation, in consultation with the High Court,-\n\n(i) revert him to his substantive post; or\n\n(ii) deal with him in such other manner as may be\nwarranted by the terms and conditions of his\nsubstantive appointment.\n\nRule 12: Seniority-The seniority, inter se, of the\nsubstantive members of the Service, whether direct\nrecruits of promoted officers, shall be determined with\nreference to the respective dates of their\nconfirmation.\n\nProvided that the seniority, inter se, of\nsubstantive members of the Service having the same date\nof confirmation shall be determined as follows:\n\n(i) in the case of direct recruits the older in\nage shall be senior to the younger;\n\n(ii) in the case of promoted officers, in\naccordance with the seniority in the Punjab\nCivil Service (Judicial Branch) as it stood\nimmediately before their confirmation;\n(iii) in the case of promoted officers and direct\nrecruits, the older in age shall be senior to\nthe younger.\n\nRule 14: Selection Grades.-(1) The members of the\nService shall be eligible for promotion, permanently or\nprovisionally, to the following selection grade posts,\ncarrying scales of pay specified against them: Two\nSelection Grade posts in the time scale of Rs. 1800-\n100-2000; and Two Selection Grade posts at a fixed pay\nof Rs. 2,250.\n\n(2) Promotion to the Selection grade posts shall\nbe made on merit and suitability in all respects with\ndue regard to seniority and no member of the Service\nshall be entitled as of right to suck promotion.\nAppendix to the rules shows that the Punjab Superior\nJudicial Service consisted then of 20 posts: one Legal\nRemembrancer and Secretary to Government, Punjab,\nLegislative Department; 15 District and Sessions Judges; and\n4 Additional District and Sessions Judges.\n\nThese rules were amended from time to time with or\nwithout the consultation of the High Court. The relevant\namendments are these:\n\nOn February, 1966 the Governor of Punjab, in exercise\nof the powers conferred by the proviso to\nArt. 309\nof the\nConstitution and all other powers enabling him in this\nbehalf, promulgated the \"Punjab Superior Judicial Service\n(First Amendment) Rules, 1966\". By clause 2 of these rules\nthe following proviso was added to sub-rule (1) of rule 10\nof the 1963 Rules:\n\n\"Provided that the Governor may in exceptional\ncircumstances or any case, after consulting the High\nCourt, reduce the period or probation\".\n\nOn December 31, 1976 the Governor of Punjab, in\nexercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to\nArt. 309\n\nof the Constitution and all other powers enabling him in\nthis behalf, made the \"Punjab Superior Judicial Service\n(Second Amendment) Rules, 1976\" in consultation with the\nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana. These rules were given\nretrospective effect from April 9, 1976. Rule 2(2) of the\n1963 Rules defined a 'cadre post' to mean a permanent post\nin the service. Clause 2 of the Second Amendment Rules\nsubstituted the following sub-rule (2) in rule 2 for the\noriginal sub-rule:\n\n\"2(2) 'cadre post' means a permanent or temporary post\nin the service .\nRule 12 of the 1963 Rules provided that the seniority, inter\nse, of the substantive members of the Service, whether\ndirect recruits or promoted officers, shall be determined\nwith reference to the respective dates of their\nconfirmation. Clause 3 of the Second Amendment Rules\nsubstituted the following rule for the original rule 12:\n\n\"12. Seniority.-The seniority, inter se, of the\nmembers of the service, shall be determined by the\nlength of continuous ser vice on a post in the Service\nirrespective of the date of confirmation;\nProvided that in the case of two members appointed\non the same date, their seniority shall be determined\nas follows:\n\n(i) in the case of direct recruits, the older in\nage shall be senior to the younger;\n\n(ii) a member recruited by direct appointment\nshall be senior to a member recruited\notherwise; and\n\n(iii) in the case of members appointed by\npromotion, seniority shall be determined\naccording to the seniority of such members in\nthe appointments from which they were\npromoted.\"\n\nThis is how the rules stand in so far as the State of\nPunjab is concerned. The State of Haryana came into\nexistence on November 1, 1966 by Act 3 of 1966. The Punjab\nSuperior Judicial Service Rules, 1963, as amended upto\nNovember 1966 apply to the State of Haryana with the\namendments made from time to time by the Governor of\nHaryana.\n\nOn March 17, 1971 certain formal amendments were made\nto the 1963 Rules by the Haryana First Amendment Rules,\n1971. On April 21, 1972 the Governor of Haryana, in exercise\nof the powers conferred by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution and all other powers enabling him in that\nbehalf, amended the 1963 Rules by the Haryana First\nAmendment Rules, 1972, with retrospective effect from April\n1, 1970. By Clause 3 of the Amendment, the definition of\n\"cadre post\" in Rule 2(2) was amended to mean a post,\nwhether permanent or temporary, in the service. Rule 8(2) of\nthe 1963 Rules provided that the total number of cadre\nposts, two-third shall be manned by promoted officers and\none-third by direct recruits. Clause 5 of the Amendment\naltered this ratio by providing that of the total number of\nposts, three-fourth shall be manned by promoted officers and\none-fourth by direct recruits. Rule 12 governing seniority\nwas amended by clause 6 in the same manner as in Punjab,\nthat is to say,\nby providing that the seniority of the members of the\nservice, whether direct recruits or promoted officers, shall\nbe determined by the length of continuous service (in a post\nin the service irrespective of the date of confirmation. As\nan aside we may mention, though it has no direct relevance\nin the points under consideration, that on December 3, 1976\nthe Governor in the exercise of his constitutional and other\npower promulgated an amendment providing that:\n\n\"No person-\n\n(a) who has more than two children and has not got\nhimself or herself or his or her spouse\nsterilized, or\n\n(b) who, having not more than two children, does not\ngive an undertaking not to have more than two\nchildren.\n\nshall be allowed to Join the Service.\"\n\nOn September, 2, 1977 the Governor in the exercise of his\nconstitutional and other powers further amended the 1963\nRules with retrospective effect from April 1, 1970. The\ndefinition of 'cadre post' in rule 2(2) was once again\namended to mean \"a permanent post in the Service\".\nSimilarly, Rule 8(2) was amended for the purpose of\nrestoring the quota between promotees and direct recruits.\nOnce again, two-third of the cadre posts were to be manned\nby promoted officers and one-third by direct recruits. Rule\n12, which deals with seniority, was also amended so as to\nrestore the original position by providing that the\nseniority of members of the Service will be determined with\nreference to the dates of confirmation. In short, the\nHaryana First Amendment Rules, 1977, which were given\nretrospective effect from April 1, 1970, superseded the\namendments made by the Haryana First Amendment Rules, 1972\nand restored the position as it obtained originally under\nthe 1963 Rules, in regard to the definition of 'cadre post',\nthe quota between promotees and direct recruits and the rule\nof seniority.\n\nEver since November 1, 1966 when the State of Haryana\nwas formed, there has been a common High Court for the\nStates of Punjab and Haryana called the High Court of Punjab\nand Haryana. Two separate High Courts were not created for\nthese two States probably because of considerations of\nviability in regard to one of the States and the need to\nfoster a spirit of national integration. But the fact of\nthere being two separate Governors for the two States with\nindependent powers under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution has made the task of the High Court difficult\nand unenviable. The Chief Justice and Judges of the Common\nHigh Court of the two States are faced with the predicament\nof applying one set or service rules to members of the\nSuperior Judicial Service of one State and a totally\ndifferent,\nand to a large extent opposite, set of rules to those of the\nother State. As the matter stands to-day, (and we mean what\nwe say because there is no knowing when one or the other\nState will amend the rules and with what degree of\nretroactivity) under the Haryana First Amendment Rules,\n1977, 'cadre post' means a permanent post in the Service.\nTemporary posts are not cadre posts in Haryana. In Punjab,\n'cadre post' means both permanent and temporary posts in the\nSuperior Judiciary. The definition of 'cadre post' has a\nsignificant bearing on the fortunes and future of judicial\nofficers. In Punjab, prior to the amendment made to the 1963\nRules on December 31, 1976 promotees alone used to be\nappointed, though on an officiating basis, to temporary\nposts in the Superior Judicial Service. Direct recruits were\nnot appointed to temporary posts because temporary posts\nwere outside the cadre and C. direct recruits were appointed\nto cadre posts only, in which they were entitled to be\nconfirmed on the completion of the probationary period.\nAfter the amendment, applications were invited for direct\nrecruitment to temporary posts also with the result that\npromotees lost the opportunity of being appointed to those\nposts, though on an officiating basis. Respondents 9 to 11\nin the Punjab writ petition were appointed directly in July\n1977 to temporary posts of Additional District and Session\nJudges.\n\nIn regard to the rule of seniority, the position as it\nobtains in the two States is fundamentally different: In\nPunjab, under rule 12 as amended on December 31, 1976 with\nretrospective effect from April 9, 1976, seniority is\ndetermined by the length of continuous service on a post\nirrespective of the date of confirmation. In Haryana, rule\n12 as it stood originally was revived with effect from April\n1, 1976 with the result, that seniority of judicial officers\nin the Superior Judicial Service is determined with\nreference to the dates of confirmation. The High Court has\nto deal with one set of officers under its control on the\nbasis that the date of confirmation is the correct criterion\nof seniority and with another set of officers, also under\nits control, on the basis that the length of continuous\nofficiation in a post is the true test of seniority.\nWhatever decision the High Court takes or is driven to take\nadministratively in the matter of seniority of judicial\nofficers becomes a bone of contention between the promotees\nand direct recruits. Sometimes, the administrative decision\nsatisfies neither the one class nor the other, leading to a\ntriangular controversy. The frequent amendments to the rules\nwhich are often given a long retrospective effect, as long\nas seven years, makes the High Court's administrative\ntask difficult. And if the amendments are made either\nwithout consulting the High Court or against its advice, the\nHigh Court has a delicate task to perform because if it\nadheres to its opinion, it is accused of bias and if it\ngives up its stand, it is accused of being weak kneed and\nvacillating. The administrative decisions taken by the High\nCourt in the instant cases from time to time have been\nassailed by members of the Judiciary on one or the other of\nthese grounds. That is hardly conducive to the sense of\ndiscipline and the feeling of brotherhood which ought to\nanimate the Judiciary. Surely, the State Governments of\nPunjab and Haryana could have saved the High Court from this\npredicament by evolving a common set of rules of seniority,\nat least in the name of national integration. There is\nnothing peculiar in the soil of Punjab and nothing wanting\nin the soil of Haryana to justify the application of\ndiametrically opposite rules of service to the judicial\nofficers of the two States. The territories comprised in\nthese two States were at one time, and that too not in the\ndistant past, parts of the territory of the same State of\nPunjab. The promotees, at any rate, who figure in these\nproceedings, all flowered on the soil of Punjab but are not\ntold that their claim to seniority will depend upon whether\nthey remained in Punjab or were allotted to Haryana.\n\nThis unfortunate position has arisen largely because of\nthe failure of the State Governments to take the High Court\ninto confidence while amending the rules of service. The\namendments made in Punjab on December 3, 1966 with\nretrospective effect from April 9, 1976, including the\namendment to rule 12 governing seniority, were made in the\nteeth of opposition of the High Court and indeed, in so far\nas tho retrospective effect of the rules ii concerned, the\namendment was made without consulting the High Court. In\nHaryana, rule 12 was amended in 1972 with retrospective\neffect from April 1, 1970 contrary to the advice of the High\nCourt. The plain infirmity of that amendment could be that\nit was designed to operate to the detriment of one and only\none judicial officer who was directly recruited to the\nSuperior Judicial Service, namely, Shri. N. S. Rao, who is\nrespondent No. 3 to the Haryana Petitions. The original rule\n12 was, however, subsequently, restored by the State\nGovernment by yet another amendment dated September 4, 1977.\nThere was a change in the Government which evidently led to\na change in the rules, as if service rules are a plaything\nin the hands of the Government. This only shows how\nessential it is for the Governors, though not as a\nconstitutional requirement, to consult the High Court before\nframing rules under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution. Consultation, be it said is not to be equated\nwith the formal process of asking the High Court what\nopinion it holds on a particular issue. Consultation is a\nmeaningful prelude to the proposed action, whereby the High\nCourt is afforded an opportunity to discuss the matter under\nconsideration and to meet the Government's or Governor's\nreasons for the proposed action. In the instant case, the\nHigh Court could have made an effort to persuade one or the\nother Governor to see its point of view; or else, it could\nat least have impressed upon the two Governors the\nimperative need to adopt an identical pattern of rules for\nthe two States which are blessed with a common High Court.\n\nLittle wonder then that the Superior Judicial Service\nof the two States was thrown into a state of turmoil and\nuncertainty. Neither promotees nor direct recruits felt\nsecure about their existing rank or seniority because the\nrules were being amended from time to time, sometimes just\nto suit the convenience, sometimes to tide over a temporary\ncrisis, sometimes to appease a class of officers who shouted\nlouder and at least once in order to strike at an\nindividual. The amendments to the rules led to a spate of\nrepresentations from the members of the service to the High\nCourt and human nature being what it is, Judicial Officers\nwere not wanting who sought the intercession of the\nconcerned State Government in order to advance the interests\nof an individual or the interest of a class. Once it was\nknown that the Governor could ignore or defy the High Court\nwhile framing rules of service, the centre of power shifted\nfrom the Nyayalaya to the Mantralaya which is an undesirable\nstate of affairs because thereby the very independence of\nthe Judiciary is put in jeopardy.\n\nQuestions regarding confirmation, seniority and the\nequitable integration of direct recruits and promotees had\nplagued the High Court for nearly two decades, even before\nthe separate State of Haryana was formed. These questions\nwere further complicated by the changes brought about in the\nrules of 1963 by the respective State Governments of Punjab\nand Haryana. The case of Shri N. S. Rao, who is respondent 3\nto the Haryana Writ Petition, is an eloquent illustration of\nthe effect of the amendments made to the rules with\nretrospective effect. At the time when the Governor of\nHaryana amended the rules in 1972 with retrospective effect\nfrom April 1, 1970, Shri N. S. Rao was the only direct\nrecruit in the Haryana Superior Judicial Service. He was\nappointed on probation on July 7, 1970. The amendment was\ngiven retrospective effect from April 1, 1970, as if to\ndemote him and him alone.\n\nIn so far as the Haryana Writ Petitions are concerned\nsome time in February 1972 the Punjab and Haryana High Court\ntook up the question of confirmation of some of the\npromotees, including the petitioners, against the permanent\nposts which fell within the quota\nof promotees out of the six permanent posts which were newly\ncreated w.e.f. January 18, 1972. Before the High Court could\ndecide the question of confirmation of the promotees against\nthe aforesaid posts, respondent 3 made a representation to\nthe High Court on February 13, 1972 contending that the\nratio of 2: 1 between the promotees and direct recruits had\nto be maintained at all stages, that is to say, not only at\nthe time of appointment but at the time of confirmation\nalso. The High Court appears to have postponed the\nconfirmation of the promotees in response to respondent 3's\nrepresentation. Later respondent 3 was confirmed with effect\nfrom July 7, 1972. Five promotees including the three\npetitioners were confirmed w.e.f. July 8, 1972, that is, a\nday after respondent 3 was confirmed. The Governor of\nHaryana refused to recognise the order of confirmation of\nrespondent 3 passed by the High Court and he reverted the\nlatter to the post of a District Attorney w.e.f. June 23,\n1973. Respondent 3 challenged the order of his reversion by\nWrit Petition No. 2147 of 1973. The Petition was heard by a\nspecial Bench of five Judges of the High Court which set\naside the order of reversion of respondent 3 but held by a\nmajority that the order of respondent 3's confirmation\npassed by the High Court was invalid since the power to\nconfirm a District & Sessions Judge was vested in the\nGovernor and not in the High Court. The Judgment of the High\nCourt is reported in\nNarendra Singh Rao v. State of\nHaryana\n(1).\n\nThe view of the High Court regarding the power\nof confirmation was set aside by this Court by its judgment\ndated January 24, 1975 in High Court of\nPunjab and Haryana\nv. The State of Haryana.\n(2). It was held by this Court that\nthe power to confirm a District and Sessions Judge resides\nin the High Court and not in the Governor.\n\nPetitioner No. 1 then made representations to the High\nCourt on February 12 and March 31, 1975 contending that\nrecruitment to the Superior Judicial Service was governed by\na rule of quota only and not also by the rule of rotation;\ntherefore, it was not open to the High Court to give an\narbitrary date of confirmation to the promotees. Petitioners\n2 and 3 also made similar representations. In the meanwhile\nthe Governor of Haryana amended rule 12 by the Haryana First\nAmendment Rules 1972 providing that the seniority of the\nmembers of the Service, direct recruits or promoted\nofficers, shall be determined by the length of the\ncontinuous service on a post in the service irrespective or\nthe date of confirmation. In pursuance of that amendment,\nthe High Court decided by an administrative order dated\nNovember 2, 1975 that the Petitioners were senior to\nrespondent 3. It does not, however, appear to have taken any\ndecision on the representations of the petitioners that the\nrule of rotation cannot be applied at the time of\nconfirmation.\n\nAggrieved by the order of the High Court that the\npetitioners were senior to respondent 3 by reason of the\namended rule 12, the latter filed yet another writ petition,\nNo. 100 of 1977, in the High Court challenging the vires of\nthe amended rule 12. During the pendency of that Writ\nPetition, the Governor of Haryana amended the rules again by\na notification dated September 2, 1977 rescinding the\namendment introduced to the rules in April 1972. The\noriginal rule 12 thus having been restored, the High Court\ndealt with respondent 3's writ petition on the basis that he\nhad automatically become senior to the petitioners. The High\nCourt therefore confined its judgement to the question of\ninter se seniority between respondent 3 and Shri J. M.\nTandon (now a Judge of the High Court). The representations\nof the petitioners appear to have been rejected by the High\nCourt since on June 6, 1978 respondent 3 was granted the\nselection grade, presumably on the basis that he was senior\nto the petitioners. It is thereafter that the petitioners\nfiled these writ petitions (4228 to 4230 of 1978) under\nArt.\nof the Constitution, claiming the following reliefs:\n\n(a) a writ of certiorari directing respondents 1 and 2\n(the State of Haryana and the High Court of Punjab\n& Haryana respectively) to quash the order dated\nMay 4, 1973 where by respondent 3 was confirmed\nw.e.f. July 7, 1972 and the order dated June 6,\n1978 granting the selection grade to him;\n\n(b) a writ of mandamus declaring rule 12 of the Rules\nas violative of the fundamental rights of the\npetitioners guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of\nthe Constitution; and\n\n(c) a writ of prohibition restraining respondents 1\nand 2 from taking any action on the new seniority\nlist or in pursuance of the orders dated May 4,\n1973 and June 6, 1978.\n\nThis is the genesis of the controversy between the\npromotees and direct recruits in Haryana. In Punjab, matters\nwere in no better shape, though it must be said to the\ncredit of its Governor that no amendment was made with an\nevil eye on any individual Judicial Officer. In 1975, the\nAssociation of promoted officers made a representation to\nthe State Government asking that in order to avoid arbitrary\ndates of confirmation being given to the promotees,\ncontinuous officiation in the service and not the date of\nconfirmation should be accepted as the criterion of\nseniority, as was done in the case of\nother employees of the Punjab Government. The State\nGovernment forwarded that representation to the High Court\nfor its comments but the High Court appears to have kept the\nmatter pending with it for quite some time. Sometime in\n1976, the State Government ultimately sent a draft\nnotification to the High Court proposing an amendment to the\nRules. It seems that the Government did not then convey to\nthe High Court its intention to give retrospective effect to\nthe proposed amendment. By that time, ten vacancies in the\nquota of promoted officers had become available and an equal\nnumber of promoted officers was officiating for more than\nthree years as Additional District and Sessions Judges. The\nHigh Court, however, did not confirm the promotees in those\nvacancies. On the contrary, apprehending that the proposed\namendment to rule 12 may be given retrospective effect, the\nHigh Court confirmed the promotees and the direct recruits\nby applying the rule of rotation. It issued a Notification\ndated August 25, 1976 which was published in the Punjab\nGovernment Gazette dated September 3, 1976, whereby\nRespondents 3 to 8 were given prior dates of confirmation in\ncomparison with the promotees. The confirmation of eight\npromotees was evidently postponed. In the case of\nrespondents 6 to 8, the period of probation of two years was\nreduced by the High Court substantially. Respondent 6, Shri\nB. S. Nehra, was appointed on probation on April 1, 1975 and\nwas confirmed on August 2, 1976. Respondent 7, Shri T. S.\nCheema, was appointed on probation on April 2, 1975 and was\nconfirmed on August 5, 1976. Respondent 8 Shri J. S. Sidhu\nwas appointed on April 11, 1975 and was confirmed with\neffect from August 8, 1976. Thus, these direct recruits were\nconfirmed within a period of one year and four months after\ntheir appointment, though the normal period of probation is\ntwo years.\n\nOn the issuance of the Notification dated August 25,\n1976, petitioner 1 addressed a representation to the High\nCourt stating that he was officiating in the Superior\nJudicial Service with effect from November 12, 1969 and\nasking that he should be confirmed in the post which became\navailable from December 23, 1972. He complained against the\ndate of confirmation, February 3, 1975, allotted to him as\narbitrary.\n\nRule 12 of the Rules was thereafter amended by the\nGovernor of Punjab by a Notification dated December 31, 1976\nwhich was given retrospective effect from April 9, 1976. By\nthat amendment, Seniority was to be determined by the length\nof continuous service on a post in the service, irrespective\nof the date of confirmation. The direct recruits,\nrespondents 4 to 9, addressed a representation to the High\nCourt contending that their seniority as fixed by the High\nCourt's Notification dated August 23, 1976, with reference\nto the respective dates of their confirmation, ought not to\nbe disturbed. They also challenged the validity of rule 12.\n\nFor the purpose of considering those conflicting claims\nof promotees and direct recruits, the High Court constituted\na sub-committee consisting of three Judges, S. S.\nSandhawalia (now Chief Justice), Bhopinder Singh Dhillon and\nGurnam Singh, JJ. The Committee gave an oral hearing on\nFebruary 7, 1979 to the representatives of the promotees and\ndirect recruits. The High Court, however, has not readjusted\nthe seniority of the promotees and direct recruits in the\nlight of amended rule 12.\n\nIt is interesting that before the Sub-Committee heard\nthe representatives of the promotees and direct recruits, a\nFull Bench of five Judges of the High Court of Punjab and\nHaryana, delivered its judgment on December 13, 1977 in\nCivil Writ 100 of 1977 which was filed by Shri N. S. Rao,\nwho is respondent 3 in the Haryana petition. By the\naforesaid judgment which is reported in AIR 1978 (P and H)\n234, the High Court rejected the plea of Shri Rao that the\nrules not only required the application of a rule of quota\nat the time of appointment but they also required the\napplication of a rule of rotation at the time of\nconfirmation. At page 240 of the report appears the\nconclusion of the High Court to the effect that rules 8 and\n12 were independent of each other, that rotational system\ncould not be implicitly read in the quota rule provided for\nby rule 8 and that members of the Superior Judicial Service\nwere entitled to claim seniority strictly in accordance with\nthe provisions of rule 12. The grievance of the promotees is\nthat this decision which was rendered by the High Court in\nthe exercise of its judicial functions is not being followed\nby the High Court in the discharge of its administrative\nduties. After the amendment of rule 12 by the Notification\ndated December 31, 1976, two vacancies of District and\nSessions Judges arose and on each of these occasions the\nHigh Court promoted a direct recruit, treating the date of\nhis confirmation as the criterion of seniority. In the\nquarterly Gradation and Distribution list of officers of the\nJudicial Department which the High Court publishes, the\ninter se seniority has been shown according to the dates of\nconfirmation and not in accordance with the amended rule 12.\nOne of the grievances of the promotees is that the High\nCourt amended the quarterly Gradation List in compliance\nwith the amendments made by the Governor of Haryana in rule\n12 but it did not amend the Gradation List of the Punjab\nOfficers in compliance with the amended rule 12.\nThis, according to the petitioners, has deeply affected\ntheir sense of security, contentment and well-being. It is\nsaid that eight more vacancies arose within the quota of\npromotees after the High Court issued the Notification dated\nAugust 25, 1976 but the promotees, who were officiating for\na period of more than three years, have not yet been\nconfirmed in those posts.\n\nOne of the other grievances of the petitioners is that\nthe High Court acted upon the amendment made by the Governor\nof Punjab on December 31, 1976 in the definition of 'cadre\npost' by appointing direct recruits to temporary posts in\nthe Superior Judicial Service. It however ignored the other\namendment effected by the same Notification, namely,\namendment to rule 12, under which continuous officiation is\nthe test of seniority.\n\nBeing aggrieved by the Gradation List prepared by the\nHigh Court, the promotees in Punjab have filed Writ Petition\n266 of 1979 in this Court claiming the following reliefs:\n\n(i) an appropriate writ or direction quashing the\nimpugned notification dated 25th August, 1976;\n\n(ii) a writ of mandamus directing the High Court to\ndischarge its constitutional obligation to\nredetermine the, seniority inter se of all the\nmembers of the Punjab Superior Judicial Service in\naccordance with the provisions of rule 12, as\namended by the notification dated December 31,\n1976 and to make corrections in the Gradation and\nDistribution Lists, accordingly;\n\n(iii) an appropriate writ, directing the State\nGovernment and the High Court to confirm the\npetitioners with effect from the dates that the\nvacancies arose and became available in their\nquota without applying the rule of rotation;\n\n(iv) an appropriate writ directing the High Court to\nconsider afresh the matter of filling up four\nvacancies of District and Sessions Judges which\noccurred after 9-4-1976 and to readjust the\nseniority and respective dates of confirmation of\nthe petitioners and respondents 3 to 11 in\naccordance with the amended rule 12;\n\n(v) a writ of prohibition restraining the State of\nPunjab and the High Court from acting upon the\nseniority fixed prior to the amendment of rule 12,\nfor any purpose whatsoever, including further\npromotions within the Service; and\n\n(vi) a writ of certiorari quashing rule 11 of the Rules\nas being violative of the fundamental rights of\nthe petitioners guaranteed under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\nThese then are the respective grievances and demands of\nthe promotees and direct recruits in the Superior Judicial\nServices of Punjab and Haryana. In so far as the High Court\nis concerned, its point of view may best be stated in the\nlanguage of the report dated May 2, 1978 which was submitted\nby the Sub-Committee consisting of its three learned Judges.\nAfter setting out the background of the controversy, the\nreport says:\n\n\"It is in the aforesaid context that the question\npointedly and squarely arises, whether the\ndetermination of seniority of the members of the\nService is a matter which is within the exclusive\njurisdiction of the High Court as a necessary\nconsequence of the control vested in it by virtue of\n\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution of India. If that be\nso, then it is plain that any intrusion into the field\nof this control by any agency other than the High Court\nwould be unwarranted and therefore, unconstitutional.\nWe are of the firm view that both on principle and\nlogic and in view of the trend of the present\nauthorities, it appears to be plain that the Seniority\nof the members of the judicial Service is so integral\nand vital to the control of the High Court over them,\nthat any erosion thereof would both be violative of\n\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution and equally run counter\nto the settled concept of the independence of judiciary\nwhich is now coming to be recognised as the basic\nfeature of the Constitution.. it follows a fortiori\nthat if seniority of the members of Superior Judicial\nService is once deemed to be not within the control of\nthe High Court under\nArticle 235\n, then, in fact, it\ncould be determined by the State Governments by making\nrules without even reference or consultation with the\nHigh Court. Such a position would be utterly anomalous\nand wholly destructive of the exclusive control over\nthe district courts and courts subordinate thereto\nvested in the High Court by\nArt. 235.\nIt appears to be\nwell-settled both on principle and precedents that the\npower of determining the seniority of the members of\nthe Service cannot possibly be vested in an authority\nother than the High Court. For example, it cannot on\nthe existing provisions be vested in the Governor or\nthe State Government. Therefore, it appears to us that\nwhat the State Government cannot do directly, it cannot\nbe allowed to do indirectly by framing rules even by\nthe exercise of executive power vested in it by virtue\nof\nArticle 309\nand without even consulting or informing\nthe High Court. It is, however, well-settled that\nArt.\nis subject to the other provisions of the\nConstitution. Therefore, the control over the\nsubordinate judiciary vested in the High Court\nby\nArticle 235\nmust necessarily override\nArticle 309\n\nwherever the two happen to conflict at all.\nConsequently, if seniority is exclusively within the\nambit of the control of the High Court, then it cannot\nbe surreptitiously intruded upon either directly or by\ndevious method of framing rules under\nArticle 309\n\nwithout even reference or consultation with the High\nCourt.\"\n\n\"The true rationale underlying the ratio of N. S.\nRao's case and the subsequent decisions of Their\nLordships of the Supreme Court to which a reference\nwould follow appears to be that in the field of control\nover the district courts and courts subordinate thereto\nunder\narticle 235\n, there cannot be a duality. There\ncannot exist control by the High Court on the one hand\nand by the State Government or the Governor on the\nother. Therefore, the situation that seniority must be\ndetermined by the State Government without reference or\nconsultation with the High Court cannot be countenanced\nin principle. To our mind this would be a patent\nexample of a duality of control against which the final\nCourt has firmly set its face.\"\n\n\"On principle, therefore we are of the view that\nthe seniority of the members of the Superior Judicial\nService is exclusively within the control of the High\nCourt under\nArticle 235\nand the State Government is,\ntherefore, not competent to frame or alter rules with\nregard thereto\".\n\nAfter examining the decisions of this Court and of various\nHigh Courts, the report concludes thus:\n\n\"Both on principle and precedents we are of the\nview that the Seniority of the members of higher\nJudicial Service being vested entirely under the\ncontrol of the High Court cannot be intruded upon by\nthe framing and re-framing of rules by the State\nGovernment, which it is not competent to make and\nconsequently rule 12 is ultra vires of\nArticle 235\nof\nthe Constitution.\"\n\n\"Once we arrive at that finding, it is obvious\nthat till the vires of the said rule are\nauthoritatively pronounced upon on the judicial side,\nno firm basis can exist for determining the individual\nseniority inter se of the members of the Service-both\ndirect recruits and promotees-whose innumerable\nrepresentations are before the Committee. The High\nCourt has earlier taken action on the basis of some of\nthe earlier amendments to the rules and on the\nadministrative side it would be obviously inept to take\nup a contradictory position now. Even otherwise it does\nnot appear appropriate to us in the present case to act\nadministratively in violation of the purported\npromulgation of statutory rules on the point. There is\nthus no choice but to place the matter squarely for a\nbinding and authoritative decision on the judicial side\nforthwith.\"\n\n\"The High Court inevitably is the guardian of the\nindependence and integrity of the subordinate judicial\nservice, whose control is constitutionally vested in\nit. As an institution, it is fundamentally interested\nin the maintenance of these traits. We are of the view\nthat it would be invidious to push a private litigant\nor any one of the affected members of the judicial\nservice to a court of law to seek the necessary\ndecision. This burden, therefore, must also be carried\nby the High Court. We would consequently recommend that\nthe Registrar be directed to immediately initiate\nnecessary proceedings under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India on behalf of the High Court.\"\n\n\"Once it is settled that the determination of\nseniority of the members of the Superior Judicial\nService vests exclusively in the High Court, then there\nis no manner of doubt that such control inevitably\nimplies the power of framing rules to make the exercise\nof such control feasible, convenient and effective.\nThis has been recently settled in the Constitution\nBench judgment reported in\nState of U.P. v. Tripathi\n,\nAIR 1978 (Vol. 2) S.C. Cases page 102. We have no doubt\nin our mind that rules for the determination of the\nseniority inter se of the members of the Superior\nJudicial Service can be framed to the satisfaction of\nboth the wings of the promotees and direct recruits\".\n\nThe Haryana Writ Petition was filed in this Court by\nthe promotees in July 1978 and the Punjab Writ Petition was\nfiled in February 1979. The High Court was thereby spared\nthe need to have a Writ Petition filed under Article 226\nbefore itself and the embarrassment of being required to\ndecide it.\n\nThe arguments advanced before us by the learned counsel\nfor the promotees, direct recruits, the High Court of Punjab\nand Haryana, the Government of Punjab and the Government of\nHaryana cover a wide range but on a careful analysis of\nthose arguments, the questions raised by the counsel resolve\nthemselves into two issues. They are: (1) whether the power\nto frame rules of seniority of District and Session Judges\nvests in the Governor or in the High Court and (2) whether\nthe High Court, basing itself on the rule of quota, is\njustified in applying the rule of rotation at the time of\nthe confirmation of promotees and direct recruits as\nDistrict and Session Judges.\nThe decision of the first question depends on the\nscope, meaning and purpose of the provisions contained in\n\nArticle 309\nand\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution.\nArticle 309\n\nreads thus:\n\n\"309. Subject to the provisions of this\nConstitution, Acts of the appropriate Legislature may\nregulate the recruitment, and conditions of service of\npersons appointed, to public services and posts in\nconnection with the affairs of the Union or of any\nState:\n\nProvided that it shall be competent for the\nPresident or such person as he may direct in the case\nof services and posts in connection with the affairs of\nthe Union, and for the Governor of a State or such\nperson as he may direct in the case of services and\nposts in connection with the affairs of the State, to\nmake rules regulating the recruitment, and the\nconditions of service of persons appointed, to such\nservices and posts until provision in that behalf is\nmade by or under an Act of the appropriate Legislature\nunder this article, and any rules so made shall have\neffect subject to the provisions of any such Act\".\n\nArticle 235\nreads thus:\n\n\"235. The control over district courts and Courts\nsubordinate thereto including the posting and promotion\nof, and the grant of leave to, persons belonging to the\njudicial service of a State and holding any post\ninferior to the post of district judge shall be vested\nin the High Court, but nothing in this article shall be\nconstrued as taking away from any such person any right\nof appeal which he may have under the law regulating\nthe conditions of his service or as authorising the\nHigh Court to deal with him otherwise than in\naccordance with the conditions of his service\nprescribed under such law.\"\n\nIt is urged by Shri V. M. Tarkunde who appears on\nbehalf of the promotees in Haryana that if the two parts of\n\nArticle 235\nare read together, it will be obvious that the\ncontrol which the High Court is entitled to exercise over\nDistrict Courts and courts subordinate thereto does not\ninclude the power to make rules regulating the conditions of\nservice of judicial officers. According to the learned\ncounsel, the power which the Constitution has conferred on\nthe Governor by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nis a legislative\nand not an executive power; and since the Governor exercises\na legislative power while making rules under the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\n, the principle of the independence of the\njudiciary is not in any manner violated thereby. Judicial\nindependence, says the Counsel, means freedom from executive\ninterference, not freedom from laws.\nShri A. K. Sen, Shri S. N. Kackkar, Dr. Y. S. Chitale,\nShri F. S. Nariman and Shri B. R. Tuli supported the\nargument of Shri Tarkunde by citing various decisions of\nthis Court and of the High Courts, the connected provisions\nof the Constitution and the debates of the Constituent\nAssembly. On the other hand, it was contended by the learned\nSolicitor General, Shri Sorabji, who appears on behalf of\nthe High Court that the paramount object of\nArticle 235\nis\nto secure the independence of the judiciary by insulating it\nfrom executive interference, which postulates that once an\nappointment of a judicial officer is made, his subsequent\ncareer should be under the control of the High Court. He\nshould not be exposed to the possibility of any improper\nexecutive pressure in the course of his judicial career. The\ncontrol over the subordinate judiciary, which is vested in\nthe High Court by\nArticle 235\n, is exclusive in nature,\ncomprehensive in extent and effective in operation. There\ncan be no duality in these matters, says the Solicitor\nGeneral, and therefore the power to frame rules in regard to\nseniority of judicial officers must reside in the High Court\nand not in the Governor. That, according to the Solicitor\nGeneral, is a necessary consequence of the control over the\nsubordinate courts which is vested in the High Court.\n\nThere is no direct decision on the question whether the\nGovernor, in the exercise of power conferred by the proviso\nto\nArticle 309\n, has the power to frame rules regulating the\nseniority of judicial officers of the State. The reason for\nthe absence of precedent on this point, when law reports are\noverflowing with constitutional decisions, probably is that\nduring the last thirty years of the working of our\nConstitution, no one ever disputed the power of the Governor\nto frame rules governing seniority of judicial officers. In\nseveral States such rules are in force in the absence of a\nlaw passed by the State legislature on the subject and High\nCourts have been applying those rules from time to time and\ncase to case without demur. It is also significant that\nhardly any High Court has framed rules of its own for\ndetermining the seniority of its judicial officers. Even the\nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana, which disputes the right\nof the Governor so to frame rules, has not made any rules of\nits own to occupy that field. All this, which is stark\nhistory, cannot be dismissed by saying that the absence of a\nprecedent is no authority for holding that what has not been\nchallenged is lawful. It is true that the novelty of a\ncontention cannot be its infirmity and indeed law would have\nremained static and stagnant if it had not been allowed to\ngrow from\ncase to case. But the point of the matter is that there has\nbeen no unconcerned acquiescence by High Courts and judicial\nofficers in rules framed by the Governors. In Haryana\nitself, respondent 3, Shri N. S. Rao, challenged the\nGovernor's power to override the order of his confirmation\nwhich was passed by the High Court. And he won. Whenever\nthere was the semblance of a justification for doing so,\neither one or the other party motivated by personal interest\nor out of the broader consideration that the High Court's\ncontrolling jurisdiction must remain inviolate has\nchallenged the rules framed by the Governor as being\nexcessive. But there is a good reason why the rules of\nseniority framed by the Governor have been acquiesced in,\nall over the country, over all these years. The reason is as\nfollows:\n\nOn a plain reading of\nArticles 235\nand\nof the\nConstitution, it is clear that the power to frame rules\nregarding seniority of officers in the judicial service of\nthe State is vested in the Governor and not in the High\nCourt. The first part of\nArticle 235\nvests the control over\ndistrict courts and courts subordinate thereto in the High\nCourt. But the second part of that article says that nothing\nin the article shall be construed as taking away from any\nperson belonging to the judicial service of the State any\nright of appeal which he may have under the law regulating\nthe conditions of his service or as authorising the High\nCourt to deal with him otherwise than in accordance with the\nconditions of his service prescribed under such law. Thus,\n\nArticle 235\nitself defines the outer limits of the High\nCourt's power of control over the district courts and courts\nsubordinate thereto. In the first place, in the exercise of\nits control over the district courts and subordinate courts,\nit is not open to the High Court to deny to a member of the\nsubordinate judicial service of the State the right of\nappeal given to him by the law which regulates the\nconditions of his service. Secondly, the High Court cannot,\nin the exercise of its power of control, deal with such\nperson otherwise than in accordance with the conditions of\nhis service which are prescribed by such law.\n\nWho has the power to pass such a law? Obviously not the\nHigh Court because, there is no power in the High Court to\npass a law, though rules made by the High Court in the\nexercise of power conferred upon it in that behalf may have\nthe force of law. There is a distinction between the power\nto pass a law and the power to make rules, which by law,\nhave the force of law. Besides, \"law\" which the second part\nof\nArt. 235\nspeaks of, is law made by the legislature\nbecause, if it were not so, there was no purpose in saying\nthat the High Court's power of control will not be construed\nas taking away certain rights of certain persons under a law\nregulating their conditions of service. It could not have\nbeen possibly intended to be\nprovided that the High Court's power of control will be\nsubject to the conditions of service prescribed by it. The\nclear meaning, therefore, of the second part of\nArticle 235\n\nis that the power of control vested in the High Court by the\nfirst part will not deprive a judicial officer or the rights\nconferred upon him by a law made by the legislation\nregulating him conditions of service.\n\nArticle 235\ndoes not confer upon the High Courts the\npower to make rules relating to conditions of service of\njudicial officers attached to district courts and the courts\nsubordinate thereto. Whenever, it was intended to confer on\nany authority the power to make any special provisions or\nrules, including rules relating to conditions of service,\nthe Constitution has stated so in express terms. See, for\nexample\nArticles 15(4)\n, 16(4)\n, 77(3)\n, 87(2)\n, 118\n, 145(1)\n,\n146(1)\n, and\n2(148)(5)\n, 166(3)\n, 176(2)\n, 187(3)\n, 208\n, 225\n,\n227(2)\nand\n(3)\n, 229(1)\nand\n(2)\n, 234\n, 237\nand\n283(1)\nand\n(2).\n\nOut of this fasciculus of Articles, the provisions contained\nin\nArticles 225\n, 227(2)\nand\n(3)\nand\n229(1)\nand\n(2)\nbear\nrelevance on the question, because these Articles confer\npower on the High Court to frame rules for certain specific\npurposes.\nArticle 229(2)\nwhich is directly in point provides\nin express terms that subject to the provisions of any law\nmade by the legislature of the State, the conditions of\nservice of officers and servants of a High Court shall be\nsuch as may be prescribed by the rules made by the Chief\nJustice or by some other Judge or Officer of the Court\nauthorised by the Chief Justice to make rules for the\npurposes. With this particular provision before them, the\nframers of the Constitution would not have failed to\nincorporate a similar provision in\nArticle 235\nif it was\nintended that the High Courts shall have the power to make\nrules regulating the conditions of service of judicial\nofficers attached to district courts and courts subordinate\nthereto.\n\nHaving seen that the Constitution does not confer upon\nthe High Court the power to make rules regulating the\nconditions of service of judicial officers of the district\ncourts and the courts subordinate thereto, we must proceed\nto consider: who, then, possesses that power?\nArticle 309\n\nfurnishes the answer. It provides that Acts of the\nappropriate legislature may regulate the recruitment and\nconditions of service of persons appointed to posts in\nconnection with the affairs of the Union or of any State.\n\nArticle 248(3)\n, read with Entry 41 in List II of the Seventh\nSchedule, confers upon the State legislatures the power to\npass laws with respect to \"State public services\" which must\ninclude the judicial services of the State. The power of\ncontrol vested in the High Court by\nArt. 235\nis thus\nexpressly, by the terms of that Article itself, made subject\nto the law which the State legislature may pass for\nregulating the recruitment\nand service conditions of judicial officers of the State.\nThe power to pass such a law was evidently not considered by\nthe Constitution makers as an encroachment on the \"control\njurisdiction\" of the High Courts under the first part of\n\nArticle 235.\nThe control over the district courts and\nsubordinate courts is vested in the High Court in order to\nsafeguard the independence of the judiciary. It is the High\nCourt, not the executive, which possesses control over the\nState judiciary. But, what is important to bear in mind is\nthat the Constitution which has taken the greatest care to\npreserve the independence of the judiciary did not regard\nthe power of the State legislature to pass laws regulating\nthe recruitment and conditions of service of judicial\nofficers as an infringement of that independence. The mere\npower to pass such a law is not violative of the control\nvested in the High Court over the State Judiciary.\n\nIt is in this context that the proviso to\nArt. 309\n\nassumes relevance and importance. The State legislature has\nthe power to pass laws regulating the recruitment and\nconditions of service of judicial officers of the State. But\nit was necessary to make a suitable provision enabling the\nexercise of that power until the passing of the law by the\nlegislature on that subject. The Constitution furnishes by\nits provisions ample evidence that it abhors a vacuum. It\nhas therefore made provisions to deal with situations which\narise on account of the ultimate repository of a power not\nexercising that power. The proviso to\nArt. 309\nprovides, in\nso far as material, that until the State legislature passes\na law on the particular subject, it shall be competent to\nthe Governor of the State to make rules regulating the\nrecruitment and the conditions of service of the judicial\nofficers of the State. The Governor thus steps in when the\nlegislature does not act. The power exercised by the\nGovernor under the proviso is thus a power which the\nlegislature is competent to exercise but has in fact not yet\nexercised. It partakes of the characteristics of the\nlegislative, not executive, power. It is legislative power.\n\nThat the Governor possesses legislative power under our\nConstitution is incontrovertible and, therefore, there is\nnothing unique about the Governor's power under the proviso\nto\nArticle 309\nbeing in the nature of a legislative power.\nBy\nArticle 168\n, the Governor of a State is a part of the\nlegislature of the State. And the most obvious exercise of\nlegislative power by the Governor is the power given to him\nby\nArt. 213\nto promulgate ordinances when the legislature is\nnot in session. Under that Article, he exercises a power of\nthe same kind which the legislature normally exercises : the\npower to make laws. The heading of Chapter IV of Part VI of\nthe Constitution, in which\nArt. 213\noccurs, is significant:\n\n\"Legislative Power of\nthe Governor\". The power of the Governor under the proviso\nto\nArticle 309\nto make appropriate rules is of the same\nkind. It is legislative power. Under\nArticle 213\n, he\nsubstitutes for the legislature because the legislature is\nin recess. Under the proviso to\nArticle 309\n, he substitutes\nfor the legislature because the legislature has not yet\nexercised its power to pass an appropriate law on the\nsubject.\n\nIt is true that the power conferred by\nArticle 309\nis\n\"subject to\" the provisions of the Constitution. But it is\nfallacious for that reason to contend that the Governor\ncannot frame rules regulating the recruitment and conditions\nof service of the judicial officers of the State. In the\nfirst place, the power of control conferred upon High Courts\nby the first part of\nArticle 235\nis expressly made subject,\nby the second part of that Article, to laws regulating\nconditions of service of its judicial officers. The first\npart of\nArticle 235\nis, as it were, subject to a proviso\nwhich carves out an exception from the area covered by it.\nSecondly, the Governor, in terms equally express, is given\nthe power by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nto frame rules on\nthe subject. A combined reading of\nArticles 235\nand\nwill\nyield the result that though the control over Subordinate\nCourts is vested in the High Court, the appropriate\nlegislature, and until that legislature acts, the Governor\nof the State, has the power to make rules regulating the\nrecruitment and the conditions of service of judicial\nofficers of the State. The power of the legislature or of\nthe Governor thus to legislate is subject to all other\nprovisions of the Constitution like, for example,\nArticles\nand\n16.\nThe question raised before us is primarily one of\nthe location of the power, not of its extent. The second\npart of\nArticle 235\nrecognises the legislative power to\nprovide for recruitment and the conditions of service of the\njudicial officers of the State. The substantive provision of\n\nArticle 309\n, including its proviso, fixes the location of\nthe power. The opening words of\nArticle 309\nlimit the\namplitude of that power.\n\nWe entertain no doubt that seniority is a condition of\nservice and an important one at that. The control vested in\nthe High Court by the first part of\nArticle 235\nis therefore\nsubject to any law regulating seniority as envisaged by the\nsecond part of that article. The power to make such law is\nvested by\nArticle 309\nin the legislature, and until it acts,\nin the Governor. Whether it is the legislature which passes\nan Act or the Governor who makes rules regulating seniority,\nthe end product is 'law' within the meaning of the second\npart of\nArticle 235.\nThe legislatures of Punjab and Haryana\nnot having passed an Act regulating seniority of the\nrespective State judicial officers, the Governors of the two\nStates have the power to frame rules for that purpose under\nthe proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution. Such rules are, of course, subject to the\nprovisions of the Constitution and to the provisions of any\nAct which the appropriate legislature may pass on the\nsubject.\n\nAs we have said earlier, the mere power to pass a law\nor to make rules having the force of law regulating\nseniority does not impinge upon the control vested in the\nHigh Court over the district courts and the courts\nsubordinate thereto by\nArticle 235.\nSuch law or the rules,\nas the case may be, can provide for general or abstract\nrules of seniority, leaving it to the High Court to apply\nthem to each individual case as and when the occasion\narises. The power to legislate on seniority being subject to\nall other provisions of the Constitution, cannot be\nexercised in a manner which will affect or be detrimental to\nthe control vested in the High Court by\nArticle 235.\nTo take\nan easy example, the State legislature or the Governor\ncannot provide by law or by rules governing seniority that\nthe State Government in the concerned department will\ndetermine the seniority of judicial officers of the State by\nthe actual application of the rules of seniority to each\nindividual case. Thereby, the High Court's control over the\nState judiciary shall have been significantly impaired. The\nopening words of\nArticle 309\n, \"Subject to the provisions of\nthis Constitution\" do not exclude the provision contained in\nthe first part of\nArticle 235.\nIt follows that though the\nlegislature or the Governor has the power to regulate\nseniority of judicial officers by laying down rules of\ngeneral application, that power cannot be exercised in a\nmanner which will lead to interference with the control\nvested in the High Court by the first part of\nArticle 235.\n\nIn a word, the application of law governing seniority must\nbe left to the High Court. The determination of seniority of\neach individual judicial officer is a matter which\nindubitably falls within the area of control of the High\nCourt over the district courts and the courts subordinate\nthereto. For the same reason, though rules of recruitment\ncan provide for a period of probation, the question whether\na particular judicial officer has satisfactorily completed\nhis probation or not is a matter which is exclusively in the\ndomain of the High Court to decide. That explains partly why\nin High Court of\nPunjab & Haryana v. State of Haryana\n(1)\nthis Court held that the power to confirm a judicial officer\nis vested in the High Court and not in the Governor.\n\nThe error of the High Court's point of view, like the\nerror of the report dated May 2, 1978 of its Sub-Committee,\nconsists in the assumption that the Governor, while acting\nin the exercise of power conferred by the proviso to\nArticle\n, exercises an executive function. That is why it felt so\ngreatly exercised that the independence\nof the judiciary was being eroded. That independence has to\nbe preserved at all costs but, as Constitutional realists,\nwe cannot deprive the legislature or the Governor of their\nlegitimate legislative powers under\nArticle 309.\nThat power\nis subject to all other provisions of the Constitution which\nmeans that the power cannot be exercised in a manner which\nwill lead, for example, to the violation of\nArticles 14\n, 16\n\nor the pervasive ambit of the first part of\nArticle 235.\n\nSince the power conferred by\nArticle 309\nis not absolute or\nuntrammeled, it will be wrong to test the validity of that\npower on the anvil of its possible abuse. The various\nconstitutional safeguards are an insurance against its\nabuse.\n\nNumerous decisions were cited before us to highlight\nthe importance of insulating the judiciary from executive\ninterference. It was urged by the learned Solicitor General\non behalf of the High Court that the paramount object of\n\nArticle 235\nis to secure the independence of the judiciary\nby ensuring that the subordinate judiciary is insulated from\nexecutive interference and once the appointment of a\njudicial officer is made, his subsequent career should be\nunder the control of the High Court and he should not be\nexposed to the possibility of any improper executive\npressure (Union of India v. Justice S. H. Sheth(1), that the\ncontrol over the subordinate judiciary vested in the High\nCourt under\nArticle 235\nis exclusive in nature,\ncomprehensive in extent and effective in operation; and that\nthere can be no \"duality\" in the matter of control over the\ndistrict courts and the courts subordinate thereto (A. P.\nHigh Court v. Krishnamurthy(2). The short answer to these\nsubmissions is that the power conferred by\nArticle 309\nis a\nlegislative, not executive, power and that the power is\nsubject to all the provisions of the Constitution. If\ndespite this position, the Governor's rule-making power is\nlikely to create a magnetic field wherein the executive will\nbe the focal point of attraction, it is not the Constitution\nthat is to blame. As is often said, the danger to judicial\nindependence springs more from within than from without.\n\nBefore parting with this point, we would like to refer\nto a decision of this Court in\nState of Bihar v. Madan Mohan\nPrasad\n(3). Sarkaria J., speaking for the Court, observed\nin\nthat case\nthat in\ndetermining the seniority of the Bihar Superior Judicial\nService the High Court was bound to act in accordance with\nthe rules validly made by the Governor under the proviso to\n\nArt. 309\nof the Constitution. The judgment does not discuss\nthe question any further which makes it unnecessary to\nanalyse it in detail.\n\nFor these reasons, we reject the contention that the\nGovernor has no power to make rules of seniority of the\nDistrict and Sessions Judges.\n\nThat takes us to the second question which is, whether\nthe rotation method devised by the High Court in applying\nthe relevant service rules in the matter of confirmation and\nconsequent fixation of seniority of the petitioners vis-a-\nvis the direct recruits suffers from any legal or\nconstitutional infirmity. The main thrust of the argument of\nthe promotees, who have filed the two sets of Writ Petitions\nbefore us, is that the method of rotation applied by the\nHigh Court at the time of confirmation is violative of their\nfundamental rights under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. In the Punjab Writ Petition, the petitioners\nhave taken an alternative plea that their seniority should\nbe fixed in accordance with the amendment made by the\nGovernor of Punjab by the Notification dated December 31,\n1976, effective from April 9, 1976. By that amendment,\nlength of continuous service in a cadre irrespective of the\ndate of confirmation is the governing criterion of\nseniority. In so far as the power of the Governor to amend\nthe rules is concerned, that question must be deemed to have\nbeen set at rest by the preceding part of our judgment in\nwhich we have upheld the Governor's power to frame rules of\nseniority.\n\nTo recapitulate briefly, the Superior Judicial Service\nRules, 1963, which are currently in force in Haryana, are\nidentical with the rules which were in force in Punjab\nbefore the amendment dated December 31, 1976. The Governor\nof Haryana had introduced amendments similar to those which\nare now in force in Punjab, but those amendments were\nsubsequently withdrawn and the original position as it\nobtained under the Rules of 1963 was restored.\n\nUnder the rules now in force in Haryana, which were in\nforce in Punjab prior to the aforesaid amendment dated\nDecember 31, 1976, 'cadre post' by rule 2(2) means a\npermanent post in the Service. Under rule 8(2), two-third of\nthe total number of cadre posts have to be manned by\npromoted officers and one-third by direct recruits. Under\nrule 10(1), direct recruits have to remain on probation for\ntwo years provided that the Government may, in exceptional\ncircumstances of any case, reduce the period of probation in\nconsultation\nwith the High Court. The probation can be extended by the\nGovernor beyond the period of two years in consultation with\nthe High Court but not so as to exceed a total period of\nthree years. Rule 10 (2) gives to the Governor the power in\nconsultation with the High Court to confirm a direct recruit\non a cadre post with effect from a date not earlier than the\ndate on which he completes the period of probation.\n\nRule 12 now in force in Haryana and which was in force\nin Punjab prior to the amendment dated December 31, 1976,\nprovides that the seniority of direct recruits and promoted\nofficers shall be determined with reference to the\nrespective dates of their confirmation. The proviso to rule\n12 deals with three kinds of cases in which substantive\nmembers of the Service have the same date of confirmation.\nIn regard to the third category of such cases, the proviso\nsays that in the case of promoted officers and direct\nrecruits having the same date of confirmation, the older in\nage shall be senior to the younger.\n\nUnder the amendment effected in Punjab by the\nNotification dated December 31, 1976, which is given\nretrospective effect from April 9, 1976, 'cadre post' means\na permanent as well as a temporary post in the Service. In\nso far as the rule of seniority is concerned, under the\naforesaid amendment the inter se seniority of the members of\nthe Service is to be determined by the length of continuous\nservice on a post in the Service irrespective of the date of\nconfirmation.\n\nIt may be recalled that in High Court of\nPunjab and\nHaryana v. State of Haryana\n(supra), it was held by this\nCourt that rule 10, in so far as it confers the power of\nconfirmation on the Governor, is bad because the power of\nconfirmation is a part of the control of the High Court\nwhich is vested in it by\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution.\nTherefore, the High Court alone had the power to confirm a\nDistrict & Sessions Judge. As a result of that judgment,\nrespondent 3 came back into the service as a confirmed\nDistrict & Sessions Judge.\n\nIt is necessary to bear in mind that the only provision\nof which the validity was assailed by respondent 3 in the\naforesaid case was the one contained in rule 10(2) which\nconferred a right on the Governor to confirm a direct\nrecruit. No challenge was made therein to that part of sub-\nrule (2) which requires that the confirmation shall be made\nfrom a date not earlier than the date on which the direct\nrecruit satisfactorily completes his period of probation.\nThat part of sub-rule (2) still holds the field. It must\nalso be mentioned that no opinion was expressed by this\nCourt on the validity of rule 12 of the Haryana Superior\nJudicial Service Rules as it then stood, which was in\nmaterial respects identical with rule 12 of the Punjab Rules\nas it exists now under the amendment of 1976.\nDr. Chitale, who appears on behalf of the promotees in\nthe Punjab Writ Petition, contends that the promotees are\nnot being confirmed by the High Court in the Superior\nJudicial Service even though vacancies occur within their\ntwo-third quota, which is prescribed by rule 8(2). The\nargument of the learned counsel is that the quota of 2/3:\n1/3, which is provided for by rule 8 is applicable at the\ntime of initial recruitment only. There is therefore no\nwarrant, according to counsel, for extending the application\nof that rule at the time of confirmation.\nIn support of this\nargument, reliance is placed on a unanimous decision dated\nDecember 13, 1977 of a Bench of five learned Judges of the\nPunjab and Haryana in\nNarender Singh Rao v. State of\nHaryana\n(1). The High Court held\nin that case\nthat rule 8\nwhich provides for quota and rule 12 which contains a rule\nof seniority, are independent of each other, that the rule\nof rotation cannot implicitly be read into the quota rule\nand that every member of the Superior Judicial Service is\nentitled to claim seniority strictly in accordance with the\nprovisions of rule 12. The promotees have made a very strong\nand emphatic grievance that in spite of the fact that the\nPunjab Rules prior to the 1976 amendment were in material\nrespects similar to the rules applicable in Haryana, the\nHigh Court has been persistently refusing to follow, in the\nexercise of its administrative functions, the decision which\nwas rendered by it in the exercise of its judicial powers.\nThe promotees contend that the judgment of the five Judge\nBench which held that there is no scope for the application\nof the rule of rotation at the time of confirmation is\nbinding on the High Court as an administrative body and that\ntherefore the seniority of the promotees and direct recruits\nmust be fixed without applying the rule of rotation at the\ntime of confirmation.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the hardship caused to the\npromotees, Dr. Chitale has drawn our attention to Annexure\nP-I to the Writ Petition which has been further elaborated\nin Annexure II to his written submissions. These Annexures\nshow, and that is not disputed, that the direct recruits\nhave been assigned a date of confirmation which is a day or\nso earlier than the date of confirmation allotted to the\npromotees. Our attention is also drawn to the relevant order\npassed by the High Court in the case of Haryana officers\nwhereby the date of confirmation allotted to the direct\nrecruit, Shri N. S. Rao, is only one day prior to the dates\nof confirmation allotted to the three promotees, even though\nthe latter were officiating for a much longer period in the\nSuperior Judicial Service than respondent 3. The promotees\nhave assailed both the legality and propriety of the High\nCourt's Notification dated August 25, 1976, under which\neight direct\nrecruits and eight promotees in Punjab were confirmed by\napplying the method of rotation, and the direct recruits\nwere confirmed with effect from dates which are a little\nearlier than the dates assigned to the promotees. The\ngrievance of the promotees is accentuated by the\ncircumstance that respondents 6 to 8 had not even completed\ntheir normal period of probation and yet they were confirmed\nby the High Court after reducing the period of their\nprobation to approximately a year and four months, without\nthere being any exceptional circumstances for adopting such\na course. Besides, the power to reduce the probationary\nperiod is vested in the Governor under the proviso to rule\n10(1). And if that provision is unconstitutional for reasons\nsimilar to those for which it was held by this Court in Shri\nN. S. Rao's(1) case that the Governor had no power of\nconfirmation, there is no provision under which the High\nCourt can claim the power to reduce the period of probation.\n\nThe High Court has submitted in its written brief that\nwe should decide upon the scope of\nArticle 235\n, including\nthe question as to who has the power to frame the rules of\nseniority, and leave the other questions to be decided by it\nadministratively. Representations of both sides are still\npending before it and if we were to pronounce upon the\nvalidity of the impugned notifications, numerous practical\ncomplications may arise rendering the High Court's task of\nfixing seniority difficult. In Haryana, we are concerned\nwith two officers only: Shri B. S. Yadav, a promotee, and\nShri N. S. Rao, a direct recruit, since petitioners 2 and 3\nhave been compulsorily retired during the pendency of these\nwrit petitions. But the High Court says that our decision on\nthe other issues will have a far-reaching impact in Punjab\nwhere the conflicting claims of several members of the\nSuperior Judicial Service require consideration.\n\nThe High Court justifies the method adopted by it for\ndetermining the seniority of promotees vis-a-vis the direct\nrecruits by the application of the rule of rotation at the\ntime of confirmation. It contends that persons recruited\nfrom these two sources have to be merged in such a manner so\nas not only to maintain a proper ratio amongst them in the\nservice but also to so deal with them as to have due regard\nto their promotional prospects, in the over all context of\nthe maintenance of highest standards of Administration of\nJustice by the members of the service. Translated in\nconcrete terms, it means that members of the subordinate\njudiciary who are promoted to the Superior Judicial Service\nand those who are recruited from amongst the members of the\nBar should have an equal chance of promotion to the\nSelection Grade as also of elevation to the High Court\nBench. When recruitment to the Superior Judicial Service is\nfrom two sources,\nit becomes imperative to ensure proper blending of the\nmembers of the service and it is for that reason that the\nquota rule (whenever direct recruits are available) has to\nbe applied even at the time of confirmation. It will not be\nin the interest of the service if it were otherwise since,\naccording to the High Court, if direct recruits are\nconfirmed and assigned seniority in a block, that will\nadversely affect the chances of further promotion of the\npromotees assigned seniority below them. Direct recruits\nwhen recruited are much younger than the promotees, when\npromoted. It is for this reason that, wherever possible, the\nHigh Court claims to have assigned seniority to direct\nrecruits by interposing two promotees between two direct\nrecruits. Promotees, on the other hand, have been confirmed\nand assigned seniority one after the other, in numbers\nexceeding two, when there were no direct recruits. In order\nto explain and justify its point of view, the High Court has\nannexed four annexures to its written brief, Annexures 'A'\nto 'D'. Annexure 'A' shows seniority of the members of the\nservice as fixed and determined by the High Court from 1-11-\n1966, up to and including August 1976. The direct recruits\nare placed therein at serial Nos. 4, 5, 10, 21, 24, 27, 38,\n41, 44, 47, 50 and 53. The rest are promotees. Not only,\nsays the High Court, did it confirm a large number of\npromotees between each group of direct recruits but it\ninterposed two promotees between the direct recruits.\nAnnexure 'B' shows the likely seniority of members of the\nservice with reference to the dates of the availability of\nposts in accordance with the quota rule. This depicts the\nposition of direct recruits if they are assigned seniority\nwith effect from the dates when they complete their period\nof probation. Annexure 'C' is the same as Annexure 'B' with\nthe modification that it depicts the position of direct\nrecruits if seniority is assigned to them with effect from\nthe date from which they joined service. Annexure 'D' shows\nthe position of the members of the service in accordance\nwith the dates of their continuous officiation a such\nmembers. These statements, the High Court says, will show\nthat it has assigned seniority to promotees and direct\nrecruits in a manner designed to secure the interests of\nboth the classes.\n\nWhereas the promotees complain that they have been\ndiscriminated against and the High Court replies that it has\nheld the scales of justice even between the two classes of\nofficers, the direct recruits contend that it is in fact\nthey who have suffered injustice under the notification of\nseniority issued by the High Court on August 25, 1976.\nRespondents 3 to 5 in the Punjab Writ Petition complain that\nthey were not confirmed by the High Court on the due dates,\nthat is, on their completing the period of probation\nsatisfactorily.\nThe High Court confirmed ten promotees in between Shri S. S.\nSodhi, who is at present the Registrar of the High Court,\nand respondents 3 to 5, thereby giving to the promotees the\nbenefit of their officiation in vacancies meant for direct\nrecruits. According to the direct recruits, the quota rule\nwill lose its relevance unless the rule of rotation is\napplied at the time of confirmation. They assail the\nvalidity of the amended rule 12, which is in force in\nPunjab, on the ground that the rule that seniority must\ndepend upon the date of continuous officiation in any post\nis neither just nor reasonable. They also challenge the\nnotification issued by the Governor of Punjab on December\n31, 1976 on the ground that it was given retrospective\neffect from April 9, 1976 arbitrarily, with a view only to\nsuperseding the notification of seniority issued by the High\nCourt on August 25, 1976. It is contended by them, in the\nalternative, that if the period of their probation has to be\nweighed against the period of officiation of the promotees,\nit should be reckoned from the date on which the promotee\nofficer begins to officiate against a permanent vacancy\navailable in his quota.\n\nIn the light of these contentions, the question for\ndetermination is whether the method of confirmation adopted\nby the High Court by the rotation of promotees and direct\nrecruits in the ratio of 2:1 is justified on a proper\ninterpretation of the relevant rules. Is the operation of\nrule 8 confined to the stage of initial recruitment to the\nservice by promotion and by direct appointment? Or, can that\nrule be superimposed on rules 10 and 12 so as to justify its\napplication at the stage of confirmation also? These are the\nquestions which are posed for our consideration.\n\nRule 8, as its very heading shows, provides for a\ndistinct condition of service with reference to a specific\npoint of time, namely: 'Recruitment to Service'. The words\n\"to be filled up by direct recruitment\" which occur in the\nproviso to sub-rule (2) of rule 8 also point in the\ndirection that the operation of this sub-rule is confined to\nthe stage of initial recruitment to the service either by\npromotion or by direct appointment from the Bar. Rules 10,\n11 and 12 provide for the regulation of probation, reversion\nof promoted officers and seniority, which conditions of\nservice are distinct and separate from 'Recruitment to\nService' dealt with in rule 8. In other words, rule 8 only\nfixes the respective quota of recruits from the two sources\nspecified in clauses (i) and (ii) of sub-rule (1). Such\nreservation is intended to be made at the stage of initial\nappointments only, by reserving 2/3rd of the total number of\nposts in the cadre for promotees and 1/3rd for direct\nrecruits. It seems\nto us evident that a post which falls vacant in the quota of\npromotees cannot be filled by the confirmation of a direct\nrecruit therein nor indeed can a promotee be confirmed in a\npost which is within the quota of direct recruits.\n\nIf this be the true construction of rule 8, the method\nof confirmation by rotation of direct recruits and\npromotees, regardless of whether the vacancy assigned to the\nparticular officer falls within the quota of the class to\nwhich he belongs will be in contravention of that rule. It\nwas held by this Court in Punjab and Haryana High Court v.\nState of Haryana (Supra) that 'appointment' is not a\ncontinuous process, that the process of appointment is\ncomplete as soon as a person is initially recruited to the\nservice either by promotion or by direct recruitment and\nthat confirmation is not a part of the process of\nappointment. The necessity of treating 'Recruitment to the\nService' and 'confirmation' as two distinct and separate\nmatters can be appreciated if only it is realised that\n'Recruitment to the Service' is a matter which falls within\nthe power of the Governor under\nArticle 233\nwhile\n'confirmation' is a matter of 'control' vesting in the High\nCourt under\nArticle 235.\nThe superimposition of rule 8,\nwhich fixes the quota at the stage of recruitment, on the\nrules relating to confirmation and seniority is therefore\ncontrary to the basic constitutional concepts governing\njudicial service.\n\nThis apart, the application of Rota system at the stage\nof confirmation is beset with practical difficulties. For\nexample, if vacancies in the quota of direct recruits cannot\nbe filled for 2 or 3 years for the not uncommon reason that\ndirect recruits are not available, and during that period\nseveral vacancies occur in the quota of promotees who have\nbeen officiating continuously for two or three years, can\nthe postponement of the confirmation of such promotees\nagainst vacant posts in their quota, until the direct\nrecruits are appointed and become eligible for confirmation\non completing the prescribed period of probation, be\njustified on any reasonable ground? Is it proper and fair to\ndefer the confirmation of the promotees merely because\ndirect recruits are not available at that point of time so\nas to enable the High Court to make confirmations from both\nthe sources by rotation? This, precisely, is what the High\nCourt has done by the impugned notification dated 25-8-1976\nand that is the reason why it has not confirmed ten more\npromotees in Punjab, for whom vacancies are available within\nthe quota of promotees.\n\nIn\nA. K. Subraman v. Union of India\n,(1) the contention\nof the respondents that there is an implied rotational\nsystem involved in the\nquota rule and that therefore the quota rule must also be\napplied at the stage of confirmation was rejected by this\nCourt. It is true that it was observed\nin that case\nthat\nwhen recruitment is from two or more sources, there is no\ninherent invalidity in introducing the quota system and\nworking it out by the rule of rotation. But that is not the\nquestion which we have to consider in the writ petitions\nbefore us. What is relevant is the decision of the Court\n(page 994) that the quota rule will be enforced at the time\nof initial recruitment and not at the time of confirmation.\nThe Court observed that the tests to be applied for the\npurposes of promotion and confirmation are entirely\ndifferent since there is a well recognised distinction\nbetween 'promotion' and 'confirmation'.\n\nIn\nN. K. Chauhan v. State of Gujarat\n,(1) it was\nreiterated (pages 1051-1053) that having regard to the\nrecent decisions of this Court, it could not be held that\n'quota' is so interlocked with 'rota' that where the former\nis expressly prescribed the latter is impliedly inscribed.\nOne of us, Krishna Iyer, J., while summarising the\nconclusions of the Court said:\n\n\"The quota rule does not, inevitably, invoke the\napplication of the rota rule. The impact of this\nposition is that if sufficient number of direct\nrecruits have not been forthcoming in the years since\n1960 to fill in the ratio due to them and those\ndeficient vacancies have been filled up by promotees,\nlater direct recruits cannot claim 'deemed' dates of\nappointment for seniority in service with effect from\nthe time, according to the rota or turn, the direct\nrecruits' vacancies arose\".\n\nSeniority of promotees, according to this decision, could\nnot be upset by later arrivals from the open market, save to\nthe extent to which any excess promotees have to be pushed\ndown.\n\nIn\nParamjit Singh Sandhu v. Ram Rakha\n,(2) it was held\nby this Court on a harmonious reading of rules 3, 4, 6, 8\nand 10 of the Punjab Police Rules, 1959 that the quota rule\nwas operative both at the time of initial recruitment and at\nthe time of confirmation. We would like to clarify that this\ncase is not an authority for the proposition that whenever\nService Rules provide for quota, the rule of rota must be\nread into the rule of quota. We are not laying down that the\nrules of quota and rota cannot coexist. Service Rules may so\nprovide or they may yield to such an interpretation. In that\nevent, their validity may have to be tested in the total\nsetting of\nfacts. Therefore, whether the quota system has to be\nobserved not only at the stage of initial recruitment but\nalso at the stage of confirmation is not a matter of\nabstract law but will depend on the wording of the rules and\nthe scheme of the rules under consideration. Any dogmatic\nassertion, one way or the other, is wrong to make. On a\nreview of these authorities, all that we would like to say\nis that on a proper interpretation of the rules governing\nthe Punjab and Haryana Superior Judicial Service, the rule\nof rota cannot be read into the rule of quota. In other\nwords, the ratio of 2:1 shall have to be applied at the\nstage of recruitment but cannot, on the language of the\nrelevant rules, be applied at the stage of confirmation.\n\nIn our opinion, therefore, the High Court was not\njustified in applying the rule of rotation at the time of\nconfirmation of the members of the Superior Judicial Service\nwho were appointed to that Service by promotion and by\ndirect recruitment. In fact, we would like to remind that a\nspecial Bench of five learned Judges of the High Court of\nPunjab and Haryana had itself held on December 13, 1977 in\nN. S. Rao v. State of Haryana, (supra) that the rule of rota\ncannot be read into the rule of quota prescribed by rule 8\nof the Punjab Superior Judicial Service Rules. It was\nobserved by the Special Bench in paragraph 14 of its\njudgment that a plain reading of rule 8 shows that the\nintention of the framers of the Rules was only to provide\nfor quota and that no indication at all has been given that\nthe rotational system also had to be followed at the time of\nconfirmation or for the purpose of fixing seniority. In\ncoming to this conclusion, the High Court placed reliance on\nthe decisions of this Court in A. K. Subraman and N. K.\nChauhan to which we have already referred. The High Court\nexpressed its conclusion in paragraph 22 of the judgment by\nsaying that rules 8 and 22 are independent of each other,\nthat the rotational system cannot impliedly be read into the\nquota rule prescribed by rule 8 and that the members of the\nSuperior Judicial Service are entitled to claim seniority,\nstrictly in accordance with the provisions of rule 12. We\nare unable to understand how, in the discharge of its\nadministrative functions. the High Court could have failed\nto follow a judgment of its own special Bench consisting of\nfive learned Judges. We are of the opinion that the\naforesaid judgment has taken a correct view of the matter on\na combined reading of rules 8 and 12.\n\nWe would like to say at the cost of repetition that we\nare not dealing with the abstract question as to whether the\nrule of quota necessarily excludes the rule of rotation. We\nare only concerned to point out that it is not correct to\nsay that the rule of rota must\nnecessarily be read into the rule of quota. We have to\ndecide in those cases the narrow question as to whether, on\na true interpretation of rules 8 and 12 of the Superior\nJudicial Service Rules of Punjab and Haryana, the quota rule\nprescribed by rule 8 justifies, without more, its extension\nat the time of confirmation so that, after every two\npromotees are confirmed one direct recruit has to be\nconfirmed and until that is done, promotees cannot be\nconfirmed even if vacancies are available within their quota\nin which they can be confirmed. We are of the opinion, on a\nproper interpretation of the rules, that promotees are\nentitled to be confirmed in the vacancies which are\navailable within their quota of 2/3rd, whether or not 1/3rd\nof the vacancies are occupied by confirmed direct recruits.\nAnd similarly, direct recruits are entitled to be confirmed\nin vacancies which are available within their quota of\n1/3rd, whether or not 2/3rd of the vacancies are occupied by\nconfirmed promotees. What we find lacking in justification\nis the refusal of the High Court to confirm the promotees\neven if vacancies are available in their quota in which they\ncan be confirmed merely because, by doing so, more than two\npromotees may have to be confirmed at one time, without the\nconfirmation of a proportionate number of direct recruits.\nThe fairness which\nArticles 14\nand\npostulates is that if\na promotee is otherwise fit for confirmation and a vacancy\nfalling within the quota of promotees is available in which\nhe can be confirmed, his confirmation ought not to be\npostponed until a direct recruit, whether yet appointed or\nnot, completes his period of probation and thereupon becomes\neligible for confirmation. The adoption of this principle in\nthe matter of confirmation, will not, in practice, give any\nundue advantage to the promotees. The facts and figures\nsupplied by the High Court in Annexure R-4 to its counter-\naffidavit in W. P. 266 of 1979 show that vacancies in the\nquota of promotees do not generally become available before\nthe promotees have put in two to five years' service as\nofficiating District and Sessions Judges.\n\nIn so far as the confirmation of respondents 6, 7 and 8\nis concerned, the facts set out by the Registrar of the High\nCourt in his counter affidavit do not, in our opinion,\nconstitute \"exceptional circumstances\" such as to justify\ntheir confirmation long before they had completed the normal\nperiod of their probation. It may be recalled that they were\nconfirmed after they had each completed a period of\nprobation of approximately a year and four months. In the\nabsence of exceptional circumstances justifying the\nreduction of their normal probationary period of two years,\nwe find ourselves unable to uphold the order of the High\nCourt by which these three respondents were confirmed before\nthey were normally due for\nconfirmation. The order is in clear violation of the\nguarantee of equal opportunity, by which the petitioners are\nprejudiced, and must for that reason be set aside.\n\nThe High Court will be at liberty now to confirm them\nwith effect from the date or dates on which they completed\ntheir normal period of probation, to the satisfaction of the\nHigh Court. This is apart from the question as to whether\nthe High Court can exercise the power which was conferred by\nthe proviso to rule 10(1) on the Governor. The power\nconferred by the proviso on the Governor is ex facie bad\nbecause such a power directly impinges upon the control\nvested in the High Court by\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution.\nIf at all any authority could exercise such a power, it is\nthe High Court and not the Governor. We are assuming for the\nlimited purpose of these petitions that the High Court may,\nin exceptional circumstances, reduce the period of probation\nof a direct recruit. The rules must now be understood to\nmean that the High Court and not the Governor has the power\nof confirmation, that the normal period of probation of\ndirect recruits is two years and that unless there are\nexceptional circumstances attaching to each individual case,\na direct recruit cannot be confirmed from a date earlier\nthan the date on which he has satisfactorily completed his\nprobation of to years. The High Court is not free to fix any\nperiod of probation as it likes or to reduce the period of\ntwo years at its will and pleasure.\n\nThe amended rule 12, as in force in Punjab, lays down\nthe length of continuous service in a cadre post as the\nguiding criterion for fixing seniority. That rule was\nnotified by the Governor on December 31, 1976 and was given\nretrospective effect from April 9, 1976. Since the Governor\nexercises a Legislative power under the proviso to\nArticle\nof the Constitution, it is open to him to give\nretrospective operation to the rules made under that\nprovision. But the date from which the rules are made to\noperate must be shown to bear, either from the face of the\nrules or by extrinsic evidence, reasonable nexus with the\nprovisions contained in the rules, especially when the\nretrospective effect extends over a long period as in this\ncase. No such nexus is shown in the present case on behalf\nof the State Government. On the contrary, it appears to us\nthat the retrospective effect was given to the rules from\nApril 9, 1976 for the mere reason that on August 25, 1976\nthe High Court had issued a notification fixing seniority of\nthe promotees and direct recruits appointed to the Superior\nJudicial Service of Punjab. The notification issued by the\nGovernor on December 31, 1976 will, therefore, operate on\nfuture appointments or promotions made after that date and\nnot on\nappointments or promotions made before that date. The\nseniority of all officers appointed or promoted to the\nSuperior Judicial Service, Punjab, before December 31, 1976\nwill be determined by the High Court according to the\ncriterion of the dates of confirmation, without applying the\nrule of rotation. The seniority of those promoted or\nappointed after December 31, 1976 will be determined in\naccordance with the rules promulgated under the notification\nof that date. In so far as we see, Judicial officers from\nSerial No. 1 to 36 mentioned in Annexure P-I to the Punjab\nWrit Petition, that is, beginning with Shri J. S. Chatha and\nending with Sri Hardev Singh were appointed or promoted\nprior to December 31, 1976. Those from serial No. 37 to\nserial No. 43, that is beginning with Shri G. S. Kalra and\nending with Shri H. L. Garg, were appointed or promoted\nafter December 31, 1976. The validity of the notification\ndated December 31, 1976 was not seriously challenged before\nus, apart from its retrospectivity. We do not also see any\nconstitutional or legal objection to the test of continuous\nofficiation introduced thereby.\n\nIn so far as the Haryana writ petitions are concerned,\nthey involve a question of seniority really between two\nofficers only, namely, Shri B. S. Yadav, who is a promotee\nand Shri N. S. Rao, who is a direct recruit. The other two\npromotees, namely, petitioners 2 and 3, have been\ncompulsorily retired during the pendency of the Writ\nPetitions in this Court. Rule 12, which is not in force in\nHaryana, is similar to rule 12 which was in force in Punjab\nprior to its amendment on December 31, 1976. Rule 12, as it\noriginally existed, was amended by the Governor of Haryana,\non April 21, 1972 with retrospective effect from April 1,\n1970. However, on September 2, 1977 the Governor superseded\nthat amendment, again with effect from April 1, 1970, and\nrestored the rule of seniority as it existed originally in\nthe 1963 Rules. In Haryana, therefore, the seniority of the\nmembers of the Superior Judicial Service will be determined\nwith reference to the dates of confirmation, without\napplying the rule or rotation.\n\nWe must express our concern at the manner in which the\nRules of the Superior Judicial Service have been amended by\nthe Governor of Punjab and, particularly, by the Governor of\nHaryana. In Punjab, the High Court was never consulted on\nthe question whether the amendments made on December 31,\n1976 should be given retrospective effect and, if so, from\nwhat date. The amendments were made despite the opposition\nof the High Court. In Haryana, the amendment of April 21,\n1972 was made just in order to spite a single judicial\nofficer who is a direct recruit. Fortunately, that amendment\nwas withdrawn by the successor Government on September 2,\n1977. A\nlong retrospective effect was given to that amendment from\nApril 1, 1970 because the amendment of April 21, 1972 was\ngiven retrospective effect from April 1, 1970 and that\namendment had to be effectively superseded. We do hope that\nthe State Governments will apply their mind more closely to\nthe need to amend the Service Rules of the Superior\nJudiciary and that the Rules will not be tinkered with too\noften. It should also be realised that giving retrospective\neffect the rules creates frustration and discontentment\nsince the just expectations of the officers are falsified.\nSettled seniority is thereby unsettled, giving rise to long\ndrawn-out litigation between the promotees and direct\nappointees. That breeds indiscipline and draws the High\nCourt into the arena, which is to be deprecated.\n\nPunjab and Haryana have a peculiar problem since they\nhave a common High Court. But they are blessed, not cursed,\nwith a common High Court. Today we find the strange\nspectacle of the High Court being called upon to determine\nthe seniority of officers in one State by one test and that\nof officers in the other State by an opposite test. In\nPunjab, continuous officiation on a post in the Service is\nthe criterion of seniority. In Haryana, the date of\nconfirmation is the governing factor. Can the two Governors\nnot come together and take a joint decision applying a\nuniform test of seniority to their judicial officers who are\nunder one common High Court? And though that is not the\nrequirement of the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution, we hope that whatever amendments are going to\nbe made hereafter to the Rules will be made in consultation\nwith the High Court. Nothing will be lost thereby and there\nis so much to gain: Goodwill, expert advice and the benefit\nof the experience of a body which has to administer the\nRules since the control over the Subordinate Courts is\nvested in it by\nArticle 235.\nIt is sad that the promotees\nand direct recruits have to dissipate their time and energy\nin litigation which they can ill-afford and which arises\nlargely because of the lack of co-ordination between the\nHigh Court and the State Governments. It is time enough now\nto turn a new leaf.\n\nIn the result, we partly allow Writ Petition 266 of\n1979, quash the impugned orders including (i) the order\ndated August 25, 1976 of the High Court, published in the\nPunjab Government Gazette dated September 3, 1976; (ii) the\norder whereby Respondents 6, 7 and 8 were confirmed by\nreducing their period of probation; and (iii) all subsequent\norders of the High Court confirming the promotees and direct\nrecruits by rotation. We direct that:\n\n(a) The High Court will revise and refix the\nrespective dates of confirmation of the petitioners and\nrespondents 3 to 11, without applying the rule of\nrotation;\n(i) The petitioners, if they are otherwise fit\nfor confirmation, shall be confirmed with\neffect from the dates on which vacancies\nbecame available to them in the quota of\npromotees;\n\n(ii) Respondents 3 to 11 shall be confirmed\nagainst vacancies falling within the quota of\ndirect recruits, with effect from dates on\nwhich they successfully completed their two\nyears' probation. Since, the normal period of\nprobation cannot be reduced unless the High\nCourt is satisfied in each individual case\nthat there are \"exceptional circumstances\"\n\njustifying the reduction of that period, and\nsince the High Court had not given such\nreasons while reducing the probationary\nperiod of some of the respondents,\nrespondents 3 to 11 will be confirmed as\nstated above without reducing the period of\ntheir probation.\n\n(b) The High Court will re-draw the inter se\nseniority-\n\n(i) of such of the petitioners and respondents as\nwere promoted or appointed to the Superior\nJudicial Service prior to December 31, 1976,\non the basis of the respective dates of\nconfirmation allotted to them in compliance\nwith the aforesaid direction (a); and\n\n(ii) of such of the petitioners, respondents and\nothers who were appointed to a post in the\nservice on or after December 31, 1976 in\naccordance with the amended rule 12.\n\n(c) The High Court will review and reconsider\npromotions to the Selection Grade and other allied\norders made by it, having regard to these directions\nand the seniority to be fixed on the basis thereof. The\nHigh Court will make necessary adjustments and\nalterations therein, in the light of the action to be\ntaken in compliance with the aforesaid directions (a)\nand (b). The confirmations, promotions and other orders\npassed by the High Court during the pendency of these\nWrit Petitions are, according to the interim order\npassed by this Court, subject to the result of these\nWrit Petitions.\n\nWrit Petitions 4228 to 4230 of 1978 are also allowed\npartly, to the same extent as Writ Petition No. 266 of 1979.\nThe High Court will readjust the seniority of the\npetitioners and respondent No. 3 therein by the application\nof the aforesaid principles and in accordance with the\nHaryana Superior Judicial Service Rules, 1963\nas in force on, or as given effect to from April 1, 1970.\nThe seniority list will be drawn by the High Court on the\nbasis of the dates of confirmation without applying the rule\nof rotation and in the light of the directions given by us\nin the Punjab Writ Petition, in so far as relevant. The High\nCourt will also comply with the other directions therein\ngiven regarding the review of the promotions to Selection\nGrade and the consequential orders.\n\nThese directions in the aforesaid Writ Petitions from\nPunjab and Haryana shall be complied with as soon as\npossible, preferably within a period of three months from\nto-day.\n\nParties will pay and bear their own costs.\n\nP.
