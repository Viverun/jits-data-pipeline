It is submitted that the post of Garden Chaudhary is not a\npromotional post of Mali and moreover, qualifying the trade test is\nmandatory for the promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary, and thus,\nthe claim of the workman is baseless and misconceived.\n\n17.

It is further submitted that the finding that the respondent herein\nhas worked for the post in question w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 is merely on the\nbasis that no suggestion was put to the respondent in his cross\nexamination that he had not worked as Garden Choudhary w.e.f. 1st April,\n1991.\n\n22.

Therefore, in the absence of any material on record, the\nlearned Tribunal is not justified in holding that the respondent has worked\non the post in question w.e.f. 1st April, 1991.\n\n25.

It is further\nsubmitted that in\nthe said judgment\n, it was held by the Division Bench of\nthis Court that the claim of the workmen therein has always been that\nthey should be paid the difference in pay of a Mali/Chowkidar and the\nGarden Chaudhary as they were made to work on the post of Garden\nChaudhary.\n\n30. It is submitted that the aforesaid judgment of the Division Bench of\nthis Court was challenged before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court where the\nsame was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 9th April, 2012 in case\ntitled as\nMunicipal Corp. of Delhi v. Sultan Singh & Ors.3\n.\n\n31. It is submitted that the instant petition is nothing but a gross abuse\nof process of law and there is nothing on record to show any illegality in\nthe findings of the impugned award or the reasoning behind the same.\n\n32. It is submitted that this Court cannot delve into the facts of the\nmatter as the same is the prerogative of the learned Tribunal which is\nempowered to adjudicate upon the industrial disputes under the\nIndustrial\nDisputes Act, 1947\n.\n\n33. It is submitted that under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India,\nthis Court does not have the jurisdiction to re-appreciate the evidence on\n2011 SCC OnLine Del 1839\nS.L.P (C) no. 20069/2011\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 29 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nrecord and issue a writ until there is any error apparent on the face of the\nrecord.\n\n34. Therefore, in view of the foregoing submissions, it is submitted\nthat the instant petition may be dismissed being devoid of any merits.\n\nANALYSIS AND FINDINGS\n\n35. The matter was heard at length with arguments advanced by the\nlearned counsel for the respective parties. This Court has perused the\nentire material on record and has also duly considered the factual scenario\nof the matter, judicial pronouncements relied upon by the parties and\npleadings presented by the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n36. It is the case of the petitioner department that the impugned award\nis bad in law since the learned Tribunal erred in holding the respondent\nworkman entitled to the status of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1 st April, 1991\nand therefore, entitled to the pay scale of the said post. It has been\ncontended on behalf of the petitioner department that the respondent\nworkman was appointed on the post of Mali w.e.f. 1st April, 1989 and\nsince then he has been working as a Mali in the petitioner department. It\nhas been submitted that the respondent workman cannot claim the status\nof Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 since he did not possess the\nnecessary qualification at the relevant time. The petitioner further\ncontends that other than not being qualified for promotion to the post of\nGarden Chaudhary, the respondent workman did not even pass the trade\ntest for appointment to the said post. Moreover, the respondent workman\nhas failed to adduce any evidence to show that he was working as Garden\nChaudhary with the petitioner department. Therefore, the impugned\naward is liable to be set aside being against the settled position of law.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 30 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n37. In rival contentions, the respondent workman has vehemently\nopposed the instant petition contending to the effect that there is no\nillegality in the impugned award and the present writ petition is without\nany merits. It has been submitted that the present case is covered by\nvarious decisions of this Court as well as the Hon‟ble Supreme Court qua\nthe similar facts and circumstances and the petitioner is merely\nprolonging the issue unnecessarily. It has been contended that the\nrespondent workman has only been granted the pay scale of Garden\nChaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 till date, meant for Garden Chaudhary\nfor which period he was directed to perform the work of Garden\nChaudhary. The respondent contends that as per the judgment of the\nDivision Bench of this Court in\nSultan Singh\n(Supra), appeal against\nwhich was also dismissed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, the impugned\naward has been rightly passed in favour of the workman.\n\nLearned counsel\nappearing on behalf of the respondent workman also\nplaced reliance upon\n\nthe judgment dated 20th March, 2012 of the Coordinate Bench of this\nCourt in the matter of\nM.C.D. v. Jai Pal Singh4\nwherein a similar mater\nwas decided in favour of the workman therein and the petitioner\ndepartment therein was directed to pay the difference in the pay of Mali\nand Garden Chaudhary from 1st April, 1991 till the time he had performed\nthe duties of Garden Chaudhary. In view of the foregoing submissions, it\nis prayed that the instant petition may be dismissed.\n\n38. At this stage, this Court deems it appropriate to peruse and discuss\nthe finding of the learned Industrial Tribunal. The relevant paragraphs of\nthe impugned award are as under:\nW.P (C) no. 5521/2011\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 31 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n\".....2. Statement of claim has been filed by the Workman,\nwherein it is stated that workman was employed as Mali\nw.e.f. 01.04.1989 that he was allotted the work of Chaudhary\nw.e.f 01.01.1991 by the order of Competent Officer of the\nHorticulture Department. It is averred that workman has got\nthe payment in lower pay scale of Mali i.e. Rs.750-9401-\nrevised from time to time but he is denied the pay scale of\nRs.950-1500/- for his performing the duty of Chaudhary\nw.e.f 01.01.1991. The Mali comes under the category of\nunskilled worker while Chaudhary comes under the category\nof skilled worker. It is further averred that Hon'ble High\nCourt of Delhi in CW no.5514/2001 has disapproved the\nnon- I payment vide order dated 2.5.2003 for the post of\nChaudhary and MCD vide order no.\n\nADC(Hort)/A.O.(Hort)/DA-VII/055/457 dated 4.3.2005 has\nimplemented the said order of the Hon‟ble High Court of\nDelhi. It is further averred that the Commission, MCD vide\norder no.LWD/HQ/05/5 16 dated 29.07.2005 has accorded\npermission to MCD General Mazdoor Union for negotiation\nand correspondence in respect of the workman working in\nHorticulture Department of MCD and that the Managing\nCommittee of MCD General Mazdoor Union in the meeting\nheld on 05.06.2011 sponsored the cause of Sh. Siroman\nSingh to raise the dispute for regularization as Chaudhary.\n\nIt has been prayed that the workman may kindly be granted\nstatus of Garden Chaudhary in the pay scale of Rs.950-\n1500/- w.e.f 01.01.1991.\n\n3. The Management has filed the Written Statement to the\nclaim of the Workman thereby taking preliminary objections\nthat the present dispute is not an industrial dispute as it is\nnot espoused by the Union and the workman has also not\nauthorized the Union to file the present claim. Further, plea\nof the Management is that no demand notice has been served\nupon the Management. It is averred that the workman was\ninitially on the post of Mali and later on he was\nregularized/promoted on the same post, so he cannot be\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 32 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nregularized on the post of Garden Chaudhary as he has\nnever performed his duties as Garden Chaudhary. It is\nfurther averred that the rules for the post of Mali and\nGarden Chaudhary are totally different. Chaudhary is not\nthe promotional post and test has to be qualified to become\nChaudhary. It is further averred that the present workman\nnever worked on the post of Garden Chaudhary and to\nbecome Chaudhary there must be sanctioned post. The\nclaimant has never passed the trade test and there is no\noffice order issued for assigning the duties of Garden\nChaudhary. The Management has denied the contents of the\nstatement of claim in parawise reply on merits and averred\nthat the claim of the claimant may kindly be dismissed.\n\n4. On the pleadings of the parties, following issues were\nframed on 18.07.2013:-\n\nISSUES\n\n1. Whether present dispute is an Industrial Dispute as\ndefined in\nSection 2(k)\nof Industrial Dispute Act? OPW\n\n2. Whether the present claim of the workmen has been\nproperly espoused by the Union?

In Workman Evidence, the workman Siroman Singh\nexamined himself as WW1. In his affidavit, WW1 has\nreiterated more or less the contents of statement of claim. He\nhas stated that he was allotted the work of Acting Chaudhary\nw.e.f 01.01.91 and his name is appearing at Sr.no.42 on\nEx.WW1/3. The MOD has granted the pay scale to Sh Jai\nChand vide order Ex.WW1/2. He also exhibited the copy of\norder of case titled Sultan Singh & ors. As ex.WW1/3.

WW2 Sh BK Prasad is the President of MCD General\nMazdoor Union and he proved the registration copy of the\nUnion as EX.WW2/1. The order of MCD for negotiation is\nEx.WW2/2. The Managing Committee of MCD General\nMazdoor Union in its meeting held on 11.04.2011 sponsored\nthe cause of workman to raise the dispute and copy of said\nsponsorship is Ex.WW2/3. List of office bearers is\nEx.WW2/4. In cross examination, he denied the suggestion\nthat the union is not a registered union. He further denied\nthe suggestion that he is not the President of the Union or\nthat no meeting was held on 11.04.2011.\n\n7. The Management in its Evidence has examined one\nwitness MWl Mewa Ram who has reiterated that contents of\nwritten statement that the workman has never performed the\nduty of Garden Chaudhary and that for the post of Garden\nChaudhary there is process i.e. there must be sanctioned\npost and the test has to be qualified. He proved the copy of\nservice book of workman as Ex.WW1/1 (colly). In cross\nexamination, he has deposed that it is admitted that\nworkman has been promoted since 04.03.20 14. After seeing\nEX.WW1/1, he replied that office file number is not\nmentioned and that the Dy. Director (Hort.) has no power to\ndirect the Mali/Gardner to look after the work of\nChaudhary.

I have heard the arguments from Sh. BK Prasad, Ld. AR\nfor the Workman and Sh. Naveen Singia, Ld. AR for\nManagement. I have carefully perused the evidence on\nrecord. My issues wise findings are as under\n\nISSUE NO.1\n\n1. Whether present dispute is an Industrial Dispute as\ndefined in\nSection 2(k)\nof Industrial Dispute Act? OPW\n\n9. The onus to prove this issue is on the Workman.\nSection\n2(k)\nof ID Act provides as below:\"industrial dispute\" means\nany dispute or difference between employers and employee\nor between employers and workmen, or between workmen\nand workmen, which is connected with the employment or\nnon-employment or the terms of employment or with the\nconditions of labour, or any person\"\n\nIn\nMunicipal Employees Union Vs. The Secretary (Labour)\n& Anrs\n. 1999 LLR 1020, it has been held that\n\"It is clear that even a dispute between an employer and his\nworkmen which is connected with non-employment of any\nperson can be an industrial dispute. The beneficiary of the\nclaim need not be a workman of the employer at the time of\nraising the dispute. A dispute can be raised by the workmen\nof the employer even in respect of the non-employment of\nany person, who is not hi workman at the material time\".‟\nI have also perused Schedule II & III of I.D Act which\ncontemplates: -\n\n***\n\n10. Workman has examined Sh BK Prasad, President of\nMCD General Majdoor Union as WW2 in this present case.\nIn his affidavit, filed by way of an evidence, he has produced\nthe copy of espousal sponsorship dated 11.04.2011 as\nEx.WW2/3, copy of Union registration certificate as\nEx.WW2/1. No question has been put to any of the workman\nwitnesses by the Ld. AR for the Management that the present\ndispute is not an industrial dispute as defined\nu/s 2(k)\nof ID\nAct. The present workman is employed in East Delhi\nMunicipal Corporation.

Thus, it is held that\nthe present dispute is an industrial dispute as defined in\n\nsection 2(k)\nof I. D. Act. Issue no.1is decided accordingly in\nfavour of the workman.\n\nISSUE NO.2\nWhether the present claim of the workmen has been properly\nespoused by the Union? OPW\n\n11. The onus to prove this issue is on the workman. The\nworkman has examined WW2 Sh. B.K. Prasad, President of\nthe Union who has proved the espousal letter issued by Sh.\nBhoop Singh, General Secretary of MCD General Mazdoor\nUnion(Regd). The copy of the said letter dated 11.04.2011 is\navailable on file as EX.WW2/3. In reference order, the name\nof the Union specifically mentioned. In cross examination,\nno question has been asked by the Ld.AR from WW1 that his\ncase has not been properly espoused. No question has also\nbeen asked with regard to meeting of the union. Only\nsuggestion has been put to WW2 with regard to espousal\nwhich will not affect the case of the workman. In view of this,\nI am of the view that the cause of the workmen has been duly\nespoused. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly in favour of the\nworkman.\n\nISSUE NO.3\nWhether any notice of demand was served upon\nManagement, if not, its effect? OPW\n\n12. The onus to prove this issue is on the Workman.\nHowever, perusal of the record shows that workman has\nfailed to prove that he sent any demand notice to the\nmanagement.\n\n13.\nIn\nShambu Nath Goyal Vs. Bank of Baroda, Jullundur\n,\n(1978), 2 SCR 793, Hon'ble Supreme Court after referring to\n\nsection 2(k)\nof the Industrial Dispute, 1947, which defines\n\"industrial dispute\", held as below:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 36 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n\"A bare perusal of the definition would show that where\nthere is a dispute or difference between the parties\ncontemplated by the definition and the dispute or difference\nis connected with the employment or non- employment or\nterms of employment or with the condition of labour of any\nperson, there comes into existence an industrial dispute.\nThe\nAct\nnowhere contemplates that the dispute would come into\nexistence in any particular, specific or prescribed manner.\nFor coming into- existence of an industrial dispute a written\ndemand is not a sine qua non, unless of course in the case of\npublic utility service, because section forbids going on strike\nwithout giving a strike notice\".\n\n14. Though, no demand notice has been served upon the\nmanagement, yet in view of above judgment, it will have no\nmaterial affect on the award as no such notice was required\nto be given.

It has not been denied by the Management\nthat this document does not belong to then' or that it is a\nfalse or procured document. In cross examination, WW1\nWorkman has deposed that he has been regularly promoted\nto the post of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f 04.03.2014. He\nqualified the trade test for the post of Garden Choudhary.\nThe document Ex.WW1/1 clearly indicate that the workman\nstarted working as Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.04.199 1 though the\npassed the required test later and promoted to the post of\nChaudhary.\n\n16. The Management has also led the evidence to counter the\nclaim of the workman. But the plea of the management that\nthe workman never performed the work of chaudhary is\nunbelievable since the the document EX.WW1/1 issued by\nmanagement clearly indicate that the workman used to\nperform the duty of Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.04.1991. I have\nperused the service book of the workman Ex.MW1/1 (colly.).\nThe said service book clearly show that the workman has\nbeen getting the pay scale applicable to Mali while he has\nbeen working as Chaudhary w.e.f .01.04.1991.\n\n17. Workman has also deposed that the Management has\ngranted the pay scale to Sh. Jal Chand (co-worker) and\norder of MCD In this respect Is Ex.WW1/2.1 have perused\nthe said order.

Applying the principle of quantum merit it was held\nby the Supreme Court that the authorities should have paid\nto the employee the emoluments available in the higher pay\nscale during the time he actually worked on the said post of\nsecretary (Scouts) though in an officiating capacity and not\nas a regular promote.\n\n19.\nIn\nM.C.D Vs.

WP (C)\nNO.7974/2010\n, it is observed that 'considering the entire\nfacts and circumstances it is apparent that the claim of the\nrespondents have always been that they should be paid the\ndifference in pay of Mali/Chowkidar and the Garden\nChaudhary as they were made to work on the post of Garden\nChaudhary whereas the petitioner had first denied that they\nworked as Garden Chaudharies, then took the plea that the\nAssiatant Director (Horticulture) was not competent to ask\nthe respondents to work as Garden Chaudharies and that the\nrespondents cannot be appointed to the post of Garden\nChaudharies in accordance with the recruitment rules.\n\nThere is no doubt that respondents are not claiming\nappointment to the post of Garden Chaudharies on account\nof having worked on adhoc basis on the post of Garden\nChaudhary contrary to rules or that some of them not having\nthe requisite qualifications are entitled for relaxation.

Upon perusal of the above extracted portion of the impugned\naward, it is observed that the case before the learned Tribunal revolves\naround a dispute raised by Sh. Siroman Singh, a workman, regarding his\nentitlement to the pay scale and status of a Garden Chaudhary. The\nworkman‟s claim stated that he was employed as a Mali from 1st January,\n1989 and was assigned the duties of a Garden Chaudhary from 1st April,\n1991, by a competent officer in the Horticulture Department, i.e., Deputy\nDirector (Horticulture). Despite performing the duties of a Garden\nChaudhary, he continued to receive the lower pay scale of a Mali. The\npay scale for a Mali was Rs. 750/- -940/-, whereas a Garden Chaudhary,\ncategorized as a skilled worker, had a pay scale of Rs. 950/- -1500/-. The\nworkman had\nplaced reliance upon\na judgment of this Court and\nsubsequent Municipal Corporation of Delhi orders which disapproved the\nnon-payment for the post of Garden Chaudhary and directed the\npetitioner department therein to make the payment of the difference of the\npay scale.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 40 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n40. The petitioner management contested the workman‟ claim, arguing\nthat the dispute did not qualify as an industrial dispute since it was not\nproperly espoused by a union and no demand notice was served upon it. It\nwas asserted that the workman was initially and regularly promoted as a\nMali, not a Garden Chaudhary, and had never performed the duties of a\nGarden Chaudhary. Furthermore, the petitioner department emphasized\nthat Garden Chaudhary is not a promotional post from Mali; it requires\npassing a test, and the workman in the instant case had never passed such\na test nor was there an office order for him to act as Garden Chaudhary.\n\n41. The issues framed for determination of the learned Tribunal\nincluded whether the dispute qualifies as an industrial dispute under the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n, if the claim was properly espoused by the\nunion, and the effect of the absence of a demand notice, and as per the\nterms of the reference. Evidence presented included testimonies from the\nworkman and a union representative, along with documentary evidence\nsupporting workman‟s claim that he performed Garden Chaudhary duties\nfrom April, 1991.\n\n42. The learned Tribunal observed that the dispute raised before it\nqualifies as an industrial dispute under\nSection 2(k)\nof the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 noting that the workman‟s union had properly\nespoused the cause. Despite no formal demand notice being served, the\ndispute was recognized as valid, following legal precedents of the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court, indicating that a written demand is not a\nprerequisite for an industrial dispute's existence.\n\n43. The learned Tribunal noted that the examination of evidence\nrevealed the workman‟s name on a list of employees performing as\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 41 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nofficiating Garden Chaudharies and the acknowledgment by the\nmanagement that the workman was promoted to Garden Chaudhary in the\nyear 2014 after passing the required trade test. The learned Tribunal noted\nthat although he was formally promoted later, the workman performed\nthe duties of Garden Chaudhary from 1991. Citing previous judgments of\nthe Hon‟ble Supreme Court as well as this Court, the learned Tribunal\nunderscored the principle that employees should be compensated for\nhigher responsibilities undertaken, even if formal promotions occur later.\n\n44. In conclusion, the learned Tribunal decided the claim in favor of\nthe workman, entitling him to the pay scale of Rs. 950/- -1500/- for\nGarden Chaudhary, effective from 1st April, 1991, till date, including all\nthe consequential benefits. The reasoning behind the same was based on\nthe evidence that the workman performed the duties of a garden\nChaudhary from 1991, and the management's inability to refute the claim\neffectively.\n\n45. Therefore, the question that arises for the consideration of this\nCourt are as follows:\n\nIssue no. 1 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled\nto the post of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991?\nIssue no. 2 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled\nto the pay scale attached to the post of Garden Chaudhary\nfor the period he has worked on the said post on officiating\nstatus?\n\nIssue no. 1 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled to the post of\nGarden Chaudhary w.e.f 1st April, 1991?\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 42 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n46. Before delving into the analysis of the instant issue, this Court\ndeems it imperative to state the settled position of law with respect to the\nentitlement to a post without having been officially appointed to the said\npost.\n\n47. In addressing whether a person who is not officially\nappointed/promoted to a post can be entitled to the said post merely\nbecause they were working in an officiating or ad hoc or acting or\ntemporary position or as a stop gap arrangement, it is crucial to apply\nlegal principles and precedents relevant to employment law and industrial\ndisputes.\n\n48. As per the settled position of law, appointment to a post has to be\nmade after following the due process of law. Appointment made to a post\nwithout following the established recruitment process is contrary to the\nconstitutional mandate as well as the basic fundamental and legal rights.\n\n49. Recruitment rules and qualifications for a post are designed to\nensure that only those with the requisite skills and expertise occupy\npositions of responsibility. Courts generally uphold the necessity of\ncomplying with these rules to maintain organizational standards and\nfairness.\n\n50.\nIn\nShankarsan Dash vs. Union of India5\n, the Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt held that even if a candidate is selected for a post, they do not\nacquire a right to be appointed unless there is a formal appointment\nfollowing the prescribed procedure. The relevant portion of\nthe said\njudgment\nis as under:\n(1991) 3 SCC 47\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 43 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n\"...10. The main contention on behalf of the appellant has\nbeen, however, that the authorities in keeping the vacancies\narising later unfilled, acted arbitrarily. Mr Goswami\nreferred to several documents annexed to the special leave\npetition and affidavits filed on behalf of the parties and\ncontended that although appointments of many candidates in\nthe other services were made in the later vacancies, the\nvacancy in the Indian Police Service which subsequently\nbecame available to the appellant was refused without any\njust cause, resulting in illegal discrimination. This was\nemphatically denied on behalf of the respondent. Since the\nmatter did not appear to be free from ambiguity on the basis\nof the affidavits before us, we decided to examine the factual\naspects more thoroughly by examining the other available\nmaterials on the records of the Union of India, and\naccordingly the learned counsel for the respondent got the\nrelevant departmental files called. Two further affidavits\nwere also filed along with photostat copies of a large\nnumber of documents, which we examined at some length\nwith the aid of the learned advocates for both sides. From\nthe materials produced before us it is fully established that\nthere has not been any arbitrariness whatsoever on the part\nof the respondent in filling up the vacancies in question or\nthe other vacancies referred to by the learned counsel for the\nappellant. The process of final selection had to be closed at\nsome stage as was actually done. A decision in this regard\nwas accordingly taken and the process for further allotment\nto any vacancy arising later was closed. Mr Goswami relied\nupon certain appointments actually made subsequent to this\nstage and urged that by those dates the further vacancies in\nthe Indian Police Service had arisen to which the appellant\nand the other successful candidates should have been\nadjusted. We do not find any merit in this contention. It is\nnot material if in pursuance of a decision already taken\nbefore closing the process of final selection, the formal\nappointments were concluded later. What is relevant is to\nsee as to when the process of final selection was closed.\n\nMere completing the formalities cannot be of any help to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 44 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nappellant. We do not consider it necessary to mention all the\ndetails in this connection available from the large number of\ndocuments which we closely examined during the hearing at\nconsiderable length and do not have any hesitation in\nrejecting the argument of the learned counsel in this regard\nbased on the factual aspect...\"\n\n51. Moving further, this Court is of the view that officiating positions\nare temporary arrangements and do not confer any right to the substantive\npost. Also, the retrospective appointment or promotion to a post should\nbe given most sparingly and on sound reasoning and foundation.\nAdditionally, it is the DPC which is tasked with determining and\nfinalizing the process of promotion to a certain post and unless the\ndecision of the said DPC is proven to be arbitrary or mala fide, it cannot\nbe said that the same requires intervention of the Courts.\n\n52. Similar view was also taken by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nK.\nMadhavan vs. Union of India6\n, where the Hon‟ble Court observed that\nofficiating in a higher post does not entitle an employee to a permanent\npromotion unless they meet the eligibility criteria and are appointed\nthrough due process. The relevant paragraphs of the same read as under:\n\n\"...10. The 1975 Rules which are relevant for the purpose do\nnot explain what is meant by the expression \"on a regular\nbasis\". The expression has created some ambiguity in the\neligibility clause giving rise to this controversy. There can\nbe no doubt that when a person is appointed to a post\nagainst a permanent vacancy on probation, his appointment\nis on a regular basis, but when a person is appointed to a\npost on a purely temporary or on an ad hoc basis, the\nappointment is not on a regular basis. The expression \"on a\nregular basis\" in the 1975 Rules cannot, in our opinion, be\n(1987) 4 SCC 566\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 45 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\ninterpreted to mean as on absorption in the CBI as SP. The\ngeneral principle is that in the absence of any specific\nprovision to the contrary, the length of service from the date\nof appointment to a post should be taken into consideration\nfor the purpose of either seniority in that post or eligibility\nfor the higher post. As no explanation has been given in the\n1975 Rules of the said expression, we do not think it\ndesirable to deviate from the established principle of\ncomputing the length of service for the purpose of seniority\nor eligibility for the higher post from the date of\nappointment. In our view, therefore, the expression \"on a\nregular basis\" would mean the appointment to the post on a\nregular basis in contradistinction to appointment on ad hoc\nor stopgap or purely temporary basis. Respondent 5, in our\nopinion, satisfied the eligibility test of the 1975 Rules for\nconsideration for the post of DIG. But, it is not disputed by\nthe parties that the petitioners and Respondent 5 have, by the\nlapse of time during the pendency of this litigation, become\neligible for appointment to the posts of DIG. Indeed, they are\nholding the posts of DIG, may be on ad hoc basis, under the\ninterim orders of this Court and there is no chance of their\nbeing reverted to the next lower post of SP. The question,\ntherefore, boils down to the seniority of the petitioners, vis-\n\nà-vis Respondent 5 in the post of DIG. That again will\ndepend upon the decision on the question as to the seniority\nof the petitioners and Respondent 5 in the post of SP.\n\n***\n\n15. There can be no doubt that if the meeting of the DPC\nscheduled to be held is arbitrarily or mala fide cancelled\nwithout any reasonable justification therefor to the prejudice\nof an employee and he is not considered for promotion to a\nhigher post, the government in a suitable case can do justice\nto such an employee by granting him promotion or\nappointing him to the higher post for which the DPC was to\nbe held, with retrospective effect so that he is not subjected\nto a lower position in the seniority list. But, if the\ncancellation or postponement of the meeting of the DPC is\nnot arbitrary and is supported by good reasons, the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 46 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nemployee concerned can have no grievance and the\ngovernment will not be justified in appointing the employee\nto the higher post with retrospective effect. An employee may\nbecome eligible for a certain post, but surely he cannot\nclaim appointment to such post as a matter of right...\"\n\n53. During the course of arguments, the petitioner\nplaced reliance upon\n\nthe judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nPyari Mohan Misra\n\n(Supra) contending that even if the respondent workman, in addition to\nhis substantive post was allowed to officiate on the promoted post, de\nhors of selection in DPC, the same does not confer any right on the\nrespondent to claim regular scale of pay in the said promoted post.\nRelevant paragraphs of\nthe said judgment\nare as follows:\n\n\"..4. Admittedly, there is no order communicated to the\nrespondent appointing him in a substantive capacity as\nDirector. The only order passed in his favour was of 22-7-\n1972. That order clearly shows that he would continue\ntemporarily until further orders in terms of the order of\nappointment made on ad hoc basis on 12-8-1971. In other\nwords, mere prolonged continuous ad hoc service does not\nripen into a regular service to claim permanent or\nsubstantive status. He would remain to be on ad hoc basis\nuntil further orders. Since the Government had taken policy\ndecision to appoint an IAS officer, he was rightly reverted to\nthe post of Joint Director. Accordingly, we hold that his\nreversion is perfectly legal and valid. However, the stark\nfacts remain that he continued in the post of Director and\ndischarged his duties as Director from 12-8-1971. In these\ncircumstances, as a mark of good gesture but not as a\nprecedent, the appellants are directed to give him\npensionary benefits computing his pay as if he voluntarily\nretired as a Director from 16-12-1977. All the proceedings\nnow stand concluded. The TA stands dismissed. The appeal\nis disposed of accordingly. No costs...\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 47 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n54. Perusal of the above judgment states that mere prolonged\ncontinuous ad hoc service does not entitle the employee to claim\nappointment into a regular service or to claim permanent or substantive\nstatus. This Court is also of the view that unless the circumstances speak\notherwise, mere working in a particular post on ad hoc does not vest any\nright to be appointed permanently in the said post as the same would be\ncontrary to the recruitment rules and violative of various constitutional\nmandates.\n\n55. In light of the facts of the instant case, it is observed that Ex.\nWW1/1, which is the part of the Trial Court Record is a list of workers\nworking as Officiating Chaudharies, and in Ex. WW1/1, the respondent\nworkman‟s name appears to be at serial no. 42. Moreover, in paragraph\nno. 15 of the impugned award, the workman has also duly admitted that\nhe was working as „acting Chaudhary‟ w.e.f. 1st April, 1991.\n\n56. Furthermore, as per the rules of recruitment of the petitioner\ndepartment, the respondent is not entitled for the promotion to the post\nGarden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 because the said post is the\npromotional post and the same is required to be filled by way of\nconducting a „trade test‟ and only those who have qualified the prescribed\ntest for the post are entitled to get promoted to the post of Garden\nChaudhary.\n\n57. Although the respondent workman is seen to be working as a\nGarden Chaudhary upon directions and order of the Deputy Director\n(Horticulture), however, there is nothing on record to show that he was\npromoted or appointed to the said post by following the established\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 48 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nrecruitment rules of the petitioner department until his official promotion\non 4th March, 2014.\n\n58. While the workman performed the duties of a Garden Chaudhary\nfrom the year 1991, this alone does not entitle him to the post. There must\nbe clear evidence that his performance met the standards required for the\npost, thereby, confirming his promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary\nafter following the due process of law, i.e., trade test.\n\n59. The fact that the respondent workman passed the trade test in the\nyear 2014 is relevant, but it also indicates that prior to this, he did not\nmeet all the necessary qualifications for „regular promotion/appointment‟\nto the post of Garden Chaudhary.\n\n60. The workman‟s entitlement to the post must be evaluated based on\nthe date he met all the requirements, not just when he began performing\nthe duties on officiating/ad hoc basis. Precedent like\nState of Karnataka\nv. Umadevi\n(3)7 particularly states that regular appointments must follow\nstatutory rules. Therefore, the respondent workman‟s claim to the post\nmust be evaluated against these legal standards, which prioritize\nadherence to established recruitment procedures.\n\n61. This Court is of the view that if the rules for the higher post require\ncertain qualifications or passing of specific tests, the employee must meet\nthese criteria. Sh. Siroman Singh, i.e., the workman herein passed the\nrequired trade test only in the year 2014, which fulfilled this requirement\nfor formal promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary. As per the law,\npromotions must be evaluated based on the fulfillment of all requirements\nat the appropriate time and the respondent workman passed the trade test\n(2006) 4 SCC 1\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 49 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nin the year 2014, indicating he did not meet the necessary qualifications\nfor regular promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary until that time.\n\n62. The contention of the petitioner department that the workman has\nfailed to discharge the onus of proof that he was performing duties of\nGarden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 is untenable in the eyes of law as\nthe respondent workman had duly placed the list of workmen (which\nincludes his name at serial no. 42), duly issued by the Deputy Director\n(Horticulture) and the said documentary evidence has been rightly taken\ninto consideration by the learned Industrial Tribunal.\n\n63. Based on the legal principles and judicial precedents, it is stated\nthat a person cannot be entitled to a post merely because they were\nworking in an officiating capacity, especially if they were not appointed\nfollowing the prescribed recruitment rules and necessary qualifications.\n\n64. The principles of equity and fairness must be balanced with the\nstatutory requirements to ensure that appointments are made transparently\nand based on merit. Therefore, while the respondent workman‟s long\nservice and performance in the role of Garden Chaudhary might merit\nconsideration, his official appointment to the post must comply with the\nrequisite recruitment rules and qualifications.\n\n65. Summarily stated, the respondent workman is not entitled to the\npost/status of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 since he was not\nappointed on the said post as per the recruitment rules and further, cannot\nbe promoted to the said post until he passed the trade test.\n\n66. This Court is of the considered view that to determine whether the\nrespondent worked as a Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 until 4th\nMarch, 2014, i.e., when he was promoted officially, after passing the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 50 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\ntrade test, is a question of fact and not a question of law which is the\nprerogative of the learned Industrial Tribunal and being a writ Court, this\nCourt is only tasked to decide whether the workman is entitled to the post\nof Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991, which has been decided in\nnegative in terms of the observations made in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n67. It is held that the respondent workman was appointed as an\nOfficiating Garden Chaudhary and he performed the duties of the said\npost under the orders of the Deputy Director (Horticulture) merely as an\nOfficiating Garden Chaudhary and not as a regular Garden Chaudhary\nsince he did not pass the trade test at the relevant time. The respondent\nworkman‟s was directed to perform the duties of the above said post and\nthe same was merely a temporary arrangement without vesting any right\nin his favour to claim entitlement to the said post on regular basis.\n\n68. Accordingly issue no. 1 stands decided.\n\nIssue no. 2 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled to the pay\nscale attached to the post of Garden Chaudhary for the period he has\nworked on the said post on officiating status?\n\n69. In order to decide the issue stated herein above, it is prudent for\nthis Court to ascertain the settled legal position behind the entitlement of\na person performing the duties of a higher post in an officiating capacity\nqua pay scale of the said higher post.\n\n70. Here, the doctrine of quantum meruit comes into picture which\nimplies that a person should be paid for the work done if they have\nperformed duties typically associated with a higher post.\n\n71. The doctrine of quantum meruit was applied by the Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court in the case of\nSelvaraj vs. Lt. Governor of Island, Port\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 51 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nBlair8\n, where it was held that the employee was entitled to the\nemoluments available for the higher post during the time he actually\nworked in that capacity, even though he was not officially promoted.\nRelevant portion of\nthe said judgment\nare as under:\n\n\"..3. It is not in dispute that the appellant looked after the\nduties of Secretary (Scouts) from the date of the order and\nhis salary was to be drawn against the post of Secretary\n(Scouts) under GFR 77. Still he was not paid the said salary\nfor the work done by him as Secretary (Scouts). It is of\ncourse true that the appellant was not regularly promoted to\nthe said post. It is also true as stated in the counter-affidavit\nof Deputy Resident Commissioner, Andaman & Nicobar\nAdministration that the appellant was regularly posted in the\npay scale of Rs 1200-2040 and he was asked to look after the\nduties of Secretary (Scouts) as per the order aforesaid. It is\nalso true that had this arrangement not been done, he would\nhave to be transferred to the interior islands where the post\nof PST was available, but the appellant was keen to stay in\nPort Blair as averred in the said counter. However, in our\nview, these averments in the counter will not change the real\nposition. Fact remains that the appellant has worked on the\nhigher post though temporarily and in an officiating\ncapacity pursuant to the aforesaid order and his salary was\nto be drawn during that time against the post of Secretary\n(Scouts). It is also not in dispute that the salary attached to\nthe post of Secretary (Scouts) was in the pay scale of 1640-\n2900. Consequently, on the principle of quantum meruit the\nrespondents authorities should have paid the appellant as\nper the emoluments available in the aforesaid higher pay\nscale during the time he actually worked on the said post of\nSecretary (Scouts) though in an officiating capacity and not\nas a regular promotee. This limited relief is required to be\ngiven to the appellant only on this ground.\n(1998) 4 SCC 291\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 52 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n4. The decision of the Central Administrative Tribunal\nrejecting the claim of the appellant to the aforesaid limited\nextent is therefore required to be set aside. The appeals are\nallowed to the limited extent that the respondents will be\ncalled upon to make available to the appellant the difference\nof salary in the time scale of 1640-2900 during the period\nfrom 29-1-1992 to 19-9 1995 during which time the\nappellant actually worked. It is made clear that the payment\nof the aforesaid difference amount of salary shall not be\ntreated to amount to any promotion given to the appellant on\nthe said post. It is only on the ground that he had actually\nworked, as such this relief is being given to him. The\ndifference of salary as aforesaid shall be paid over to the\nappellant within eight weeks from today. No costs...\"\n\n72. The aforementioned judgment was also followed by the Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court in\nState of Punjab v. Dharam Pal9\nand the observations\nmade therein are as follows:\n\n\"...10. Certain Notes have been appended to the said Rule\nbut they are not relevant for adjudication of the present\ncontroversy. On a close scrutiny, it is noticeable that the\nsaid Rule postulates that the government employee\nappointed to an officiating post shall not draw pay higher\nthan his substantive pay in respect of a permanent post\nunless the post in which he is appointed to officiate is one\nenumerated in the Schedule to the Rules and further the\nofficiating appointment involves assumption of duties and\nresponsibilities of greater importance than those attached to\nthe post. It is not in dispute that the posts of Superintendent\nGrade II and Grade I are covered under the Schedule. Be it\nmentioned, the extension of benefit is subject to the\nprovisions of Rules 4.22 and 4.24.\n\n***\n\n13. On a careful scrutiny of the aforesaid prescription, it is\nperceptible that the said Rule envisages a different situation\n(2017) 9 SCC 395\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 53 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\naltogether. The present factual matrix is quite different. We\nare inclined to so hold as the respondent herein was holding\nhigher posts and further he was performing the duties of\nhigher responsibility attached to the posts. Thus analysed,\nwe arrive at the conclusion that the Rules do not bolster the\nproposition advanced by the learned counsel for the State.\n\n14. Having analysed the Rule position, we may allude to the\nauthorities that have been commended to us. First, we shall\ndwell upon the decision in\nPritam Singh Dhaliwal [Pritam\nSingh Dhaliwal v. State of Punjab\n, 2004 SCC OnLine P&H\n1428 : (2004) 4 RSJ 599] that has been relied upon by the\nHigh Court in the impugned order.\n\nIn the said case, the\nDivision Bench of the High Court had\nplaced reliance\nupon\n\nP. Grover v. State of Haryana [P. Grover\nv. State of\nHaryana, (1983) 4 SCC 291 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 525 : AIR\n1983 SC 1060] and Selvaraj v. Lt. Governor of Island, Port\nBlair [Selvaraj v. Lt. Governor of Island, Port Blair, (1998)\n4 SCC 291 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1127 : (1999) 2 SCT 286] and\nearlier decisions of the High Court and analysing the Rule\nposition opined that the officer therein had been asked to\nofficiate as Deputy Director with effect from 14-3-1996 and\nhe had been continuously posted to equivalent posts such as\nAdditional Deputy Commissioner (D) and till his\nsuperannuation the officiating charge was never withdrawn\nand hence, his entitlement to claim higher pay scale for the\npost for which he was asked to officiate and perform his\nduties till his superannuation would not be negatived.\n\n15. As the reasoning of the High Court is fundamentally\nbased on enunciation of law propounded by the Court in\nP.\nGrover [P. Grover v. State of Haryana\n, (1983) 4 SCC 291 :\n\n1983 SCC (L&S) 525 : AIR 1983 SC 1060] , we think it apt\nto appreciate the\nratio\nlaid down in\nthe said case. A two-\nJudge Bench of this Court was dealing with the fact situation\nwherein keeping in view the policy decision, the appellant\ntherein was promoted as an acting District Education\nOfficer. The order of promotion contained a superadded\ncondition that she would draw her own pay scale which\napparently meant she would continue to draw her salary on\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 54 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nher pay scale prior to promotion. The claim was put forth by\nthe appellant that she was entitled to the pay of District\nEducation Officer and there was no justification for denying\nthe same to her. A writ petition was filed before the High\nCourt and the State filed the counter-affidavit contending,\ninter alia, that she was promoted to the post of acting\nDistrict Education Officer as there was no Class I post and\nhence, she was not entitled to be paid the salary of District\nEducation Officer. Appreciating the fact situation, the Court\nheld : (SCC p. 293, para 3)\n\"3. ... We are unable to understand the reason given\nin the counter-affidavit. She was promoted to the post\nof District Education Officer, a Class I post, on an\nacting basis. Our attention was not invited to any rule\nwhich provides that promotion on an acting basis\nwould not entitle the officer promoted to the pay of the\npost. In the absence of any rule justifying such refusal\nto pay to an officer promoted to a higher post the\nsalary of such higher post (the validity of such a rule\nwould be doubtful if it existed), we must hold that Smt\nGrover is entitled to be paid the salary of a District\nEducation Officer from the date she was promoted to\nthe post, that is, 19-7-1976, until she retired from\nservice on 31-8-1980.\"\n\n***\n\n18.\nIn\nA.

It was in this situation, he approached the\nCentral Administrative Tribunal which allowed the claim\npetition with the direction that the respondent shall be paid\nsalary for the post of Junior Engineer I. That apart certain\nother directions were also issued. The Court took note of the\nfact that the respondent was promoted on a stop-gap\narrangement as Junior Engineer I and opined that this by\nitself would not deny his claim of salary for the said post. In\nthat context, the Court held : (SCC p. 89, para 6)\n\"6. ... If a person is put to officiate on a higher post\nwith greater responsibilities, he is normally entitled to\nsalary of that post. The Tribunal has noticed that the\nrespondent has been working on the post of Junior\nEngineer I since 1990 and promotion for such a long\nperiod of time cannot be treated to be a stop-gap\narrangement.\"\n\n***\n\n22. In the instant case, the Rules do not prohibit grant of pay\nscale. The decision of the High Court granting the benefit\ngets support from the principles\nlaid down in\n\nP. Grover [P.\nGrover v.

We may clearly state\nthat by an incorporation in the order or merely by giving an\nundertaking in all circumstances would not debar an\nemployee to claim the benefits of the officiating position.\n\nWe\nare disposed to think that the controversy is covered by the\n\nratio\nlaid down in\n\nHari Om Sharma [Secy.-cum-Chief\nEngineer v. Hari Om Sharma\n, (1998) 5 SCC 87 : 1998 SCC\n(L&S) 1273] and resultantly we hold that the view expressed\nby the High Court is absolutely impeccable....\"\n\n73. Perusal of the above extracts reveal that the Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt has settled the issue regarding claim of a person for pay scale\nattached to a position where he was working in an officiating capacity.\nIn\nthe case of\nDharam Pal\n(Supra), Dharam Pal was given the officiating\ncharge of higher posts (Superintendent Grade II and Superintendent\nGrade I) while he was substantively holding the post of Senior Assistant.\nThe Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that Dharam Pal was entitled to the pay\nscale of the higher post he was officiating because he was performing the\nduties and responsibilities of the said post.\n\n74. It was observed that an employee performing duties of a higher\npost in an officiating capacity should be paid the higher emoluments for\nthe duration they actually worked in that capacity, applying the principle\nof quantum meruit. The Hon‟ble Court held that if an employee is\nofficiating in a higher post and is performing the duties and\nresponsibilities attached to that post, he is entitled to the pay scale of that\nhigher post.\n\n75. Furthermore, as per the principle of legitimate expectation, an\nemployee has a reasonable expectation of being treated in a certain way\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 57 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nby their employer, based on past practices or promises. If an employee\nhas been performing the duties of a higher post for an extended period,\nthey might have a legitimate expectation of being compensated\naccordingly or being formally appointed to that post.\n\n76. This Court is of the view that the Courts are duty bound to consider\nthe principles of equity and fairness, particularly in employment disputes.\nIf an employee has been performing the duties of a higher post in good\nfaith and upon directions/orders of the concerned authority, it might be\ndeemed unfair for the employer to deny them the corresponding benefits.\nHowever, there must be clear and convincing evidence that the employee\nhas been performing the specific duties of the higher post.\n\n77. Now delving into the facts of the matter in hand.\n\n78. The respondent workman claimed his entitlement to the pay scale\nof Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991, i.e., when he was\ndirected/ordered by the Deputy Director (Horticulture) to perform the\nduties of Chaudhary by way of issuing a list where the workman‟s name\nappeared at serial no. 42.\n\n79. It is relevant to note here that the above said list has not been\ndenied or disputed by the petitioner department before the learned\nIndustrial Tribunal as observed in paragraph no. 15 of the impugned\naward. Relevant paragraph is reproduced herein below:\n\n\"...15. The Workman has deposed in his affidavit filed in his\nevidence that he was working as acting Chaudhary w.e.f\n01.01.91 and his name appears at sr.no.42 in Annexure W\nwhich is Ex.W1/1.

Perusal of the above reproduced extracts of the impugned award\nreveals that the workman had deposed before the learned Tribunal that he\nwas working as acting Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991. Further,\nit was observed by the learned Tribunal that the list (EX.

It was also observed by the learned Tribunal that the document has\nbeen issued by the petitioner management and the said list has not been\ndenied by the Assistant Director (Horticulture) who was appearing on\nbehalf of the petitioner department before the learned Tribunal.\n\n82.

For reference, the relevant\nportion of the cross examination of petitioner department is reproduced\nherein below:\n\n\"..XXXXXX by Sh. BK Prasad, Ld. AR for workman.\nIt is correct that workman Sh.

What have you to say?\nAns. I have seen the order but it is not mentioned the office\nfile number nor the Dy.

Director Horticulture namely Sh.\nNarpat Singh. What have you to say?\n\nAns. It is correct.\n\nQ Is it correct that now a days the Narpat Singh is posted in\nShahdara North zone? What have you to say?\nAns. It is correct.\n\nAt this stage, Ld. AR for workman has drawn attention of the\nwitness on the list dt. 4.6.13 for payment of discharging the\nduties of higher post already Ex.

It is correct.\n\nQ Is it correct that after joining by Siroman in your\ndepartment, he has been looking after work of Choudhary\nsince 17.06.09. What have you to say?\n\nAns It is correct.\n\nIt is correct that if the rules allow to give the money for the\nperiod working as Choudhary by the workman Siromani\nSingh till he is appearing in the examination conducted by\nthe department for promotion as Choudhary, then he is\neligible to get the said amount from the department...\"\n\n83. It is observed by this Court that the document (Exhibit WW1/1)\nsigned by the Deputy Director (Horticulture) serves as official\nacknowledgment that the respondent workman along with the others were\nperforming duties of Garden Chaudhary which is a higher post than that\nof Mali (initial post). The lack of denial or contestation by the\nmanagement strengthens the credibility of this evidence.\n\n84. This Court is of the view that in terms of the aforesaid list, i.e., Ex.\nWW1/1 it is proved that the workman was appointed to perform duties of\na Garden Chaudhary in officiating capacity by the Deputy Director\n(Horticulture) of the petitioner department.\n\n85. Thus, in terms of the law discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, the\nworkman cannot be held to be not entitled to the pay scale attached to the\npost of Garden Chaudhary. The said finding is based upon the fact that\nthe petitioner department has not produced any documentary or oral\nevidence to deny or disprove that the workman did not perform the duties\nof Officiating Garden Chaudhary after his name appeared in the list or\nthat he was not appointed on the said post w.e.f. 1 st April, 1991.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 61 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n86. It is important to note that the entitlement of the workman to the\npay scale of Garden Chaudhary is also based upon the fact that the\nrespondent was officially promoted to the above said post w.e.f. 4th\nMarch, 2014 as well as the legal propositions discussed in the foregoing\nparagraphs.\n\n87. Thus, various judicial decisions have established that the\nemployees are entitled to the pay scale of higher posts if they are\nofficiating in those posts and performing the associated duties, even if\nthey have not been formally appointed or promoted through the\nestablished recruitment process. This ensures fairness and adherence to\nthe principle of „equal pay for equal work‟, recognizing the\nresponsibilities and work actually undertaken by the employee.\n\n88. At this stage, it is pertinent to discuss the judgment of the Division\nBench of this Court in\nSultan Singh\n(Supra) against which SLP was filed\nbefore the Hon‟ble Supreme Court by the petitioner department and the\nsame was dismissed as withdrawn. The relevant portion of the judgment\nof the Division Bench of this Court is reproduced herein below for\nreference:\n\n\"...12. The Tribunal heard the pleas and contentions of the\nparties and directed the petitioner to examine the claim of\nthe respondents on the basis of the evidence that is the three\nlists issued by different zones in respect of respondents\nworking as Garden Chaudharies and other functions and\nprocess the payment of difference of pay of the post held and\nthe duties discharged by the respondents relying\non\nSelvaraj v. Lt. Governor of Island, Port Blair\n, (1998) 4\nSCC 291 and Secretary-cum-Chief Engineer.\n\nChandigarh v. Hari Om Sharma\n, 1999 (1) SLJ 23 (SC).\nThe\nrespondent has also relied on W.P(C) No. 5742/2010, GNCT\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 62 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nof Delhi v. B.S. Jarial where the Division Bench had held\nthat when a person is told to discharge the function and\nduties of a higher post till the same is filled up and he works\nfor years together as in that case the Deputy Superintendent\nwas made to work as Superintendent for more than 7 years,\nit would be unjust to deny him wages in the said post. The\nTribunal categorically noted the plea of the respondents that\nthey are performing the higher duties for long years for want\nof a regular promotion on officiating basis, and having\ndischarged the duties of higher post by resorting to what is\nreferred by the Tribunal as the „quantum of proportion rule‟,\nheld that they are entitled for emoluments of the higher post.\nThe mention of „quantum of proportion rule‟ appears to be a\ntyping error. What the Tribunal intended to say was\n„quantum meruit rule‟.\n\n***\n\n19. The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued the\nmatter on the premise that the respondents are claiming to\nbe appointed to the post of Garden Chaudharies without\nhaving qualifications as contemplated under the recruitment\nrules. No doubt on account of having worked as Garden\nChaudharies on ad hoc basis for a number of years, the\nrespondents may not be entitled to be appointed to the post\nof Garden Chaudharies contraiy to the recruitment rules,\nhowever, perusal of their petition which was filed in the\nHigh Court which was later on transferred to the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal whose order is impugned by the\npetitioner, reveals that what the respondents are demanding\nis only that the petitioner should pay the difference of wages\nof Malies/Chowkidars and that of Garden Chaudhary from\nthe date the respondents have been performing the duties\nand responsibilities of Garden Chaudharies.\n\n***\n\n22. Apparently the petitioner misconstrued the claim of the\nrespondents who were not seeking promotion to the post of\nGarden Chaudharies but are only claiming difference in pay\nof Mali/Chowkidar and Garden Chaudharies as they had\nbeen performing the work of Garden Chaudharies after the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 63 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nDeputy Director Horticulture directed them to perform the\nsaid work which was also intimated to headquarter\nHorticulture without any objection either from the\nHorticulture department or any other competent authority at\nany time. This is also not the plea of the petitioner that\nHeadquarter of Horticulture Department and alleged\ncompetent authority was not aware of work of Garden\nChaudharies being taken from Malies/Chowkidars as\nsufficient number of posts of Garden Chaudharies were not\nfilled and all the posts according to accepted norms were not\ncreated.\n\n23. While seeking the review of order dated 29th January,\n2010 it was rather pleaded that the Mali/Chowkidars are not\nentitled for difference in pay for performing the duties of\nGarden Chaudharies pursuant to the directions of the\nAssistant Director (Horticulture) as it was adjudicated in\nCivil writ petition Nos. 7869/2002, 8679/2005, 13288-\n91/2005 and 12025/2006. Before this Court the copies of\nthese orders have not been produced by the learned counsel\nfor the petitioner. This is, however, clear that the facts and\ncircumstances in those writ petitions were different as\napparently in those cases Assistant Director (Horticulture)\nhad asked the malies/chowkidars to perform the duties of\nGarden Chaudharies in contradiction to the present case\nwhere the Deputy Director (Horticulture) has asked the\nrespondents to perform the duties of Garden Chaudharies\nand the details of these persons and the dates from which\nthey have been performing was duly intimated to the\nHorticulture headquarter without any objection of any type\neither by the Horticulture headquarter or from the petitioner\nin any manner. If the Deputy Director and other officials had\nbeen asking the malies/chowkidars to perform the duties of\nGarden Chaudharies contrary to any directions or rules,\naction should have been proposed or taken by the petitioner\nagainst them. This is also apparent that the work of Garden\nChaudhary has been available as the post of Garden\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 64 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nChaudharies based on the number of posts of\nMalies/Chowkidars have not been filled.\n\n24. The Tribunal while dismissing the application for review\nof the petitioner by order dated 7th October, 2010 has held\nthat the Deputy Director (Horticulture) is the competent\nauthority relying on the decision of the Apex Court in\nState\nof West Bengal v. Kamal Sen Gupta\n(2008) 2 SCC (L&S)\n\n735.\n\n25. The learned counsel for the petitioner has not produced\nany guidelines, circulars to show that if the work is available\nand the Garden Chaudharies are not appointed, then who is\ncompetent to appoint Malies/Chowkidars on ad hoc basis as\nGarden Chaudharies and to take from them the work of\nGarden Chaudharies. If on account of exigencies of the work\nthe head of the department asks Malies/Chowkidars to do the\nwork of Garden Chaudharies which is now admitted by the\npetitioner in the present writ petition impugning the order of\nthe Tribunal then why the difference of pay of\nMali/chowkidar and Garden Chaudhary be not be paid to\nthem, has not been satisfactorily explained by the petitioner.\nApplying the principle of quantum meruit as was held by the\nSupreme Court in case of\nSelvaraj\n(Supra) the petitioner has\nto pay to the respondents emoluments available in the higher\npay scale during the time they actually worked on the post of\nGarden Chaudhary in the facts and circumstances.\n\nIn Selvarai v. Lt. Government of Island, Port Blair, (1998) 4\nSCC 291, the employee was not regularly promoted to the\npost of Secretary (scouts) but he was regularly asked to look\nafter the duties of Secretary (scouts). Applying the principle\nof quantum meruit it was held by the Supreme Court that the\nauthorities should have paid to the employee the emoluments\navailable in the higher pay scale during the time he actually\nworked on the said post of Secretary (Scouts) though in an\nofficiating capacity and not as a regular promote.\nIn Secy.-\ncum-Chief\nEngineer v. Hari Om Sharma\n, (1998) 5 SCC 87\nthe employee was promoted as a stop-gap arrangement as\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 65 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nJunior Engineer I and he had given an undertaking that on\nthe basis of stop-gap arrangement, he would not claim any\nbenefit pertaining to that post. It was held that the\nGovernment in its capacity as a model employer cannot be\npermitted to raise such an argument, and the undertaking\nwhich is said to constitute an agreement between the parties\ncannot be enforced at law. An agreement that if a person is\npromoted to the higher post or put to officiate on that post\nor, as in the instant case, a stop-gap arrangement is made to\nplace him on the higher post, he would not claim higher\nsalary or other attendant benefits would be contrary to law\nand also against public policy. It would, therefore, be\nunenforceable in view of\nSection 23\nof the Contract Act,\n1872.\nIn W.P(C) No. 5742/2010, decided on 25th August,\n2010, GNCT of Delhi v. B.S. Jarial another Division Bench\nhad held that when a person is told to discharge the function\nand duties of a higher post till the same is filled up and he\nworks for years together as in that case the Deputy\nSuperintendent was made to work as Superintendent for\nmore than 7 years, it would be unjust to deny him wages for\nthe said post. The Division Bench had held that if an\nemployee is directed to work on a higher post he has no\noption but to work at higher post at the dictate of the\nemployer, as for his not so doing would attract penalty\nproceedings against him. In Sh. Bhagwan Dassv. State of\nHaryana, 1987 (3) SLJ 93 it was observed by the Supreme\nCourt that whether the appointment was for temporary\nperiod or the scheme was temporary in nature is not relevant\nand what is to be seen is that once it is established that the\nnature of duties and functions discharged and the work done\nin similar, the doctrine of equal pay for equal work would be\nattracted. The employee in this case had been posted to\nofficiate as Sub Post Master in HSG-I at the post office and\nhe shouldered the higher responsibilities of the department\nand, therefore, he became entitled for emoluments of the post\nof HSG-I for those periods and he could not be denied those\nemoluments.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 66 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n26. The petitioner has relied on (1997) 6 SCC 200, Mohd.\nSwaleh v. Union of India and W.P(C) No. 4231/2002\ndecided on 17th March, 2011 titled\nMCD v. Sh. Bhanwar\nSingh In Bhanwar Singh (Supra) the Single Judge of the\nHigh\nCourt had set aside an award passed against the\nMunicipal Corporation of Delhi holding that the workman\nwas entitled in future to wages as of a Garden Chaudhary.\nThe workman in the said case had filed a complaint under\n\nSection 33\nof Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 regarding the\nterms of his employment having been changed during the\ntenure of general dispute between the employer MCD and\nthe Chowkidar, Beldar, Bullockmen, Bhishties, Coolies,\nMachinemen, Hedgemen, Garden Chaudhary etc. employed\nwith it. It was asserted by the workman that term of his\nemployment had been changed by his transfer from\nShahdara zone where he was working to the Headquarters\n(Horticulture Department). In these circumstances the\nreference was made „Whether the workman was entitled to\nwage of Garden Chaudhary for the period 3rd December,\n1988. The Tribunal had held that the workman though was\nnot entitled to the relief of regularization on the post of mali\nwith effect from 1st March, 1978, however, he was held\nentitled to wages equal to regular malies with effect from 1st\nMarch, 1978 till the date of his regularization up to 31st\nMarch, 1998 without any increment. It was also held that the\nworkman shall be entitled to receive wages of regular\nGarden Chaudharies in proper pay scale.\n\nThe learned Single\nJudge relying on W.P(C) No. 4023/1997 titled\nMunicipal\nCorporation of Delhi v. Jaedish Chander\nwhere it was held\nthat proper procedure has to be followed for promotion to\nthe post of Garden Chaudhary had set aside the award\nholding that the workman was entitled for emoluments as of\nmali only as he was asked to work as Garden Chaudhary by\nthe Assistant Director who was not authorized to do so.\nApparently the case relied on by the petitioner is\ndistinguishable as the respondents are not claiming regular\nappointment to the post of Garden Chaudhary.

In the case\nof respondents it is also apparent that the work of Garden\nChaudharies was available.\n\nIn the circumstances, on the\nbasis of ratio of\nSh. Bhanwan Singh\n(Supra) it cannot be\nheld that the respondents are not entitled for difference in\nwages.\n\n27. In Mohd. Swaleh (Supra) it was held by the Supreme\nCourt that a Deputy Registrar of Central Administrative\nTribunal who was ordered by the Vice Chairman to\ndischarge the function of the Registrar would not be entitled\nfor emoluments of the Registrar as the Vice Chairman did\nnot have the power to appoint another Government servant,\npermanently to the said post, as the appointing authority was\nthe President of India. It was held that in absence of any\ndelegation of power in respect of Group „A‟ post, Vice\nChairman was not empowered to make the appointment of\nthe Registrar. In contradistinction in case of respondents it\nhas been held that the Deputy Director could take the work\nof Garden Chaudharies from the malies/chowkidars which is\nGroup \"D\" post workman and this fact was not objected to\neither by the petitioner at any time nor by the Horticulture\nheadquarter. If the action of the Deputy Director or the\nheadquarter Horticulture was illegal then the petitioner\nshould have taken some action against some of the officials\nor at least should have objected about taking the work of\nGarden Chaudharies from malies and chowkidars for years\ntogether. In the circumstances, apparently the ratio of the\ncases relied on by the petitioner would not entitle it for any\nrelief to decline the difference in wages to the respondent\nduring the period they worked as Garden Chaudharies\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 68 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nwhich is left for determination by the petitioner after\nconsideration of evidence produced by the respondents.\n\n28. Considering the entire facts and circumstances it is\napparent that the claim of the respondents have always been\nthat they should be paid the difference in pay of\nMali/Chowkidar and the Garden Chaudhary as they were\nmade to work on the post of Garden Chaudhary whereas the\npetitioner had first denied that they worked as Garden\nChaudharies, then took the plea that the Assistant Director\n(Horticulture) was not competent to ask the respondents to\nwork as Garden Chaudharies and that the respondents\ncannot be appointed to the post of Garden Chaudharies in\naccordance with the recruitment rules. There is no doubt\nthat respondents are not claiming appointment to the post of\nGarden Chaudharies on account of having worked on ad-\nhoc basis on the post of Garden Chaudhary contrary to rules\nor that some of them not having the requisite qualifications\nare entitled for relaxation.\n\n29. In the entirety of facts and circumstances therefore, the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner has failed to make out any\nsuch grounds which will impel this Court to exercise its\njurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution to set aside\nthe orders of the Tribunal dated 29th January, 2010 and 7th\nOctober, 2010 as no illegality or un-sustainability or\nperversity in the orders of the Tribunal has been made out.\n\n30. The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed. Parties are left\nto bear their own cost...\"\n\n89. Upon perusal of the above stated judgment, it is observed that the\nissue before the Division Bench of this Court was to decide regularization\nand payment of arrears to certain employees of the MCD.\n\n90. Similar to the issues in the present case, the employees in question\nbefore the Division Bench were initially appointed to positions like Mali\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 69 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nor Chowkidar within the MCD. Over time, due to operational needs or\nadministrative decisions, these employees were directed to perform duties\nthat were traditionally assigned to a higher position, such as Garden\nChaudhary. This resulted in them performing duties of a higher post\nwithout receiving the corresponding pay scale.\n\n91. While deciding the issue, the Division Bench emphasized that the\nmere fact of performing duties of a higher post does not automatically\nentitle an employee to regularization. Regularization can only be granted\nin accordance with the recruitment rules governing such appointments. It\nmust be based on the existence of sanctioned posts, recruitment rules, and\nthe fulfillment of other statutory requirements.\n\n92. The Division Bench also held that the employees who had been\ndirected to perform duties of a higher post, even if on an ad hoc or\ntemporary basis, are entitled to receive arrears for the period during\nwhich they performed those duties. This decision was based on the\nprinciple that if employees are asked to perform work of a higher grade,\nthey should receive remuneration commensurate with the duties\nperformed.\n\n93. The Division Bench applied the principle of „equal pay for equal\nwork‟ in the said case and held that the employees who were performing\nduties equivalent to those of regular employees in higher posts should\nreceive pay and benefits equivalent to the pay scale of those higher posts.\n\n94. At this juncture, this Court deems is appropriate to refer to the\njudgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nState of U.P. v. Arvind\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 70 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nKumar Srivastava10\nwherein the Hon‟ble Court discussed the principle of\nextending the benefit of a judgment in rem. Relevant paragraphs are as\nunder:\n\n\"...8. The moot question which requires determination is as\nto whether in the given case, approach of the Tribunal and\nthe High Court was correct in extending the benefit of\nearlier judgment of the Tribunal, which had attained finality\nas it was affirmed till the Supreme Court. Whereas the\nappellants contend that the respondents herein did not\napproach the court in time and were fence-sitters and,\ntherefore, not entitled to the benefit of\nthe said judgment\nby\napproaching the judicial forum belatedly. They also plead\nsome distinguishing features on the basis of which it is\ncontended that the case of the respondents herein is not on a\npar with the matter which was dealt with by the Tribunal in\nwhich order dated 22-6-1987 was passed giving benefit to\nthose candidates who had approached the court at that time.\nOn the other hand, the respondents claim that their case is\nidentical to those who had filed the application before the\nTribunal inasmuch as appointments of the respondents were\nalso cancelled by the same order dated 22-6-1987 and,\ntherefore, there is no reason to deny the same treatment\nwhich was meted out to the said persons, as denial thereof\nwould amount to invidious discrimination which is anathema\nto the right of equality enshrined under\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution of India.\n\n9. It is of interest to note that both the sides, in support of\ntheir respective submissions, have referred to certain\njudgments and the reading whereof would demonstrate that\nin certain cases benefit of a particular judicial\npronouncement is extended to those who are identically\nsituated on the principle of equality. On the other hand,\nthere is a line of judgments denying such a benefit to the\nsecond group which approaches the court afterwards, even\n(2015) 1 SCC 347\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 71 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nwhen the said second group is similarly situated as the\npersons belonging to the first group. However, there is no\nconflict between the two sets of cases. In order to find out the\nprinciples laid down on the basis of which benefit of the\nearlier judgment is extended to those coming subsequently\nand the situations where such benefit is denied, we will have\nto undertake a journey into these details and lay down clear\nparameters.\n\n***\n22.1. The normal rule is that when a particular set of\nemployees is given relief by the court, all other identically\nsituated persons need to be treated alike by extending that\nbenefit. Not doing so would amount to discrimination and\nwould be violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\nThis principle needs to be applied in service matters more\nemphatically as the service jurisprudence evolved by this\nCourt from time to time postulates that all similarly situated\npersons should be treated similarly. Therefore, the normal\nrule would be that merely because other similarly situated\npersons did not approach the Court earlier, they are not to\nbe treated differently.\n\n22.2. However, this principle is subject to well-recognised\nexceptions in the form of laches and delays as well as\nacquiescence. Those persons who did not challenge the\nwrongful action in their cases and acquiesced into the same\nand woke up after long delay only because of the reason that\ntheir counterparts who had approached the court earlier in\ntime succeeded in their efforts, then such employees cannot\nclaim that the benefit of the judgment rendered in the case of\nsimilarly situated persons be extended to them. They would\nbe treated as fence-sitters and laches and delays, and/or the\nacquiescence, would be a valid ground to dismiss their\nclaim.\n\n22.3. However, this exception may not apply in those cases\nwhere the judgment pronounced by the court was judgment\nin rem with intention to give benefit to all similarly situated\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 72 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\npersons, whether they approached the court or not. With\nsuch a pronouncement the obligation is cast upon the\nauthorities to itself extend the benefit thereof to all similarly\nsituated persons. Such a situation can occur when the\nsubject-matter of the decision touches upon the policy\nmatters, like scheme of regularisation and the like (see\nK.C.\nSharma v. Union of India [K.C. Sharma\nv. Union of India,\n(1997) 6 SCC 721 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 226] ). On the other\nhand, if the judgment of the court was in personam holding\nthat benefit of\nthe said judgment\nshall accrue to the parties\nbefore the court and such an intention is stated expressly in\nthe judgment or it can be impliedly found out from the tenor\nand language of the judgment, those who want to get the\nbenefit of\nthe said judgment\nextended to them shall have to\nsatisfy that their petition does not suffer from either laches\nand delays or acquiescence...\"\n\n95. A bare reading of the above extracts states that the Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court reiterated that a judgment in rem, which is a judgment\nconcerning the status of parties or determining the rights of the public or\na class of persons, applies to everyone who falls within its scope.\nTherefore, the benefit of such a judgment extends to all similarly situated\nindividuals, even if they were not parties to the original case.\n\n96. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court further specifically emphasized that if\na judgment in rem grants benefits or rights to a particular class of\nemployees (such as ad hoc employees seeking regularization), those\nbenefits or rights should be extended to all similarly situated individuals\nacross the board. This principle ensures that the benefits of judicial\ndecisions are applied universally and fairly, promoting consistency and\nequality before the law.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 73 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n97.\nIn essence,\nAnand Kumar Srivastava\n(Supra) emphasized that\njudgments in rem have broad applicability and their benefits should not\nbe confined only to the parties involved in the specific case but should\nextend to all who are similarly affected or situated.\n\n98.\nIn terms of the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in\n\nSultan Singh\n(Supra), this Court vehemently deprecates the stand taken\nby the petitioner department that the respondent workman was not\npossessing requisite qualifications or has not qualified the trade test etc. It\nis clarified that since the workman was discharging the duties of the post\nof Garden Chaudhary, as such, the workman is entitled for the pay scale\nof Garden Chaudhary and competent authority need not look into\nanything else except the fact that the workman had worked as a\nChaudhary in an officiating capacity in so far as the question of grant of\npay against the said post is concerned.\n\n99. Therefore, extending the observations made by the Division Bench\nof this Court in\nSultan Singh\n(Supra) in terms of the judgment titled\n\nAnand Kumar Srivastava\n(Supra), this Court is of the considered view\nthat although the respondent workman is not entitled to the post of\nGarden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 in light of the observations made\nin issue no. 1, however, he is duly entitled to the pay scale attached to the\nsaid post for the period for which he performed the duties of Garden\nChaudhary in officiating/ad hoc position, as per the order (Ex. WW 1/1)\nof the Deputy Director (Horticulture). The petitioner department is liable\nto pay the workman in terms of the prescribed pay scale attached to the\npost of Garden Chaudhary.\n\n100. Accordingly, issue no. 2 stands decided.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 74 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n101. Taking into account the limited scope of this Court‟s power under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India, this Court is of the considered\nview that there is no prima facie error in the impugned award. There is\nnothing on record to show that the learned Industrial Tribunal has\nexceeded or usurped its jurisdiction, or acted illegally or in contravention\nto any law.\n\n102. Based on the considerations made in the preceding paragraphs, it is\nheld that an individual workman who has been working in an\nofficiating/ad hoc position and fulfilling the duties of a higher post, by\nvirtue of an order of the concerned department, is indeed entitled to the\npay scale associated with that post.\n\n103. Upon reading the legal precedents, it is apparent that Courts have\nupheld such claims based on principles of equity, fairness, and the\ndoctrine of quantum meruit. Therefore, the legal precedent and principles\nsupport the entitlement to the corresponding pay scales under such\ncircumstances.\n\n104. With regard to the facts of the instant case, it is observed by this\nCourt that the learned Tribunal has provided a detailed discussion in the\nimpugned award which is based on the testimony and evidence presented\nbefore it. The findings in the impugned award show that the respondent\nworkman is entitled to the pay scale of Garden Chaudhary for the period\n(w.e.f. 1st April, 1991) for which he performed the duties of Garden\nChaudhary as per the order of the Deputy Director (Horticulture).\n\n105. It is held that the petitioner department has failed to make out a\ncase to show that the learned Tribunal has acted in an arbitrary manner or\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 75 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\nin contravention to the law. The petitioner department had sufficient\nopportunity to lead evidence and the same is apparent from the impugned\naward. Taking note of the same, the learned Tribunal has rightly passed\nthe impugned award.\n\n106. In light of the foregoing discussions of facts and law, the impugned\naward dated 29th February, 2016 by the learned Presiding Officer,\nIndustrial Tribunal, Karkardooma Courts, New Delhi in case bearing ID\nno. 25/13 (238/16) is upheld. In view of the same, the writ petition\nbearing W.P (C) no. 2990/2017 stands dismissed along with the pending\napplications, if any.\n\n107. With regard to the instant batch, it is noted that the learned\nTribunal in the respective writ petitions has given similar findings based\nupon similar observations wherein, based upon the evidence, examination\nin chief as well as cross-examination, it was found that the workman‟s\nname in the respective petition falls under a list which was issued by the\nDeputy Director (Horticulture) wherein the workmen were directed to\nwork as Officiating/ad hoc Garden Chaudhary.\n\n108. Considering the above observations, it is held that in the instant\nbatch of petitions, the petitioner department has failed to put forth any\npropositions to make out a case in its favour.\n\n109. In view of the foregoing paragraphs, this Court does not find any\nmerit in the instant batch of petitions and is of the view that there is no\nillegality in the findings as recorded by the learned Tribunal. Therefore,\nthe impugned award in each of the connected petitions is upheld by this\nCourt.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 76 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19\n\n110. It is made clear that the above said decision is particularly based on\nthe observations of the learned Tribunal wherein it was noted that the\nworkman‟s name falls within the list issued by the petitioner department.\nIn case, any of the workman in any of the writ petitions do not fall under\nthe list, the same would imply that the said workman was not\ndirected/authorized to perform the duties of the Garden Chaudhary and in\nthe said instance, the said workman would not be entitled to the pay scale\nof Garden Chaudhary, as claimed by him.\n\n111. Accordingly, the instant batch of petitions stand dismissed.\n\n112. Pending applications, if any, also stand dismissed.\n\n113. In view of the abovesaid findings, the petitioner department is\ndirected to pay the dues as awarded by the learned Industrial Tribunal to\nthe respective workman within a period of three months.\n\n(CHANDRA DHARI SINGH)\nJUDGE\nJULY 4, 2024\nNA/RYP/AV\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nW.P.(C) 2990/2017 & 32 other connected matters Page 77 of 77\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:08.07.2024\n\n17:18:19",
