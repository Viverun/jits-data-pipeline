DHANUKA, J.\n RESERVED ON : 25TH JANUARY, 2018\n PRONOUNCED ON : 21ST FEBRUARY, 2018\n\nORDER :\n-\n\n1. The respondents in all these petitions have raised a\npreliminary issue of maintainability of these petitions on the ground\nthat no notice under \nsection 34 (5)\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996 has been issued by the petitioners to the respondents\nbefore filing these arbitration petitions and thus the petitions are liable\nto be dismissed on that ground itself. In view of this preliminary\nobjection raised by the respondents, learned counsel appearing for\nthe parties have addressed this Court on this issue at this stage at\ngreat length, which is being considered by this Court by passing a\ncommon order in the aforesaid matters.\n\n2. The questions that arise for consideration of this Court\nare :-\n\n i). If the notice invoking arbitration agreement is issued\n prior to 23rd October, 2015, whereas the impugned\n award is rendered after 23rd October, 2015 and if the\n arbitration agreement contemplate that the parties\n would be governed not only by the provisions of the\n \nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n, but also any\n statutory modification thereof or repeal thereto, the\n\n 6\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n provisions inserted by the \nArbitration & Conciliation\n (Amendment) Act, 2015\n would apply to such\n proceedings filed after 23rd October, 2015 or not ?\n\n ii). If there was no agreement between the parties that\n that the parties would be governed by not only the\n provisions of the \nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n\n but also any statutory amendment thereto or repeal\n thereto and the notice was issued prior to 23rd\n October, 2015 but the arbitral award is rendered\n after 23rd October, 2015, whether provisions of the\n \nArbitration & Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n\n would apply to such arbitral proceedings\n commenced prior to 23rd October, 2015 ?\n\n iii). If the arbitral notice was issued prior to 23rd October,\n 2015 and the the arbital award was rendered prior to\n 23rd October, 2015 however the arbitration petition is\n filed after 23rd October, 2015 whether the provisions\n of the \nArbitration & Conciliation (Amendment) Act,\n 2015\n would apply to such pending petitions ?\n\n iv) Even if the parties would be governed by the\n provisions of the \nArbitration & Conciliation\n (Amendment) Act, 2015\n depending upon the facts\n\n and circumstances of each case, whether issuance\n of prior notice under \nsection 34(5)\n by the petitioner\n upon the respondent before filing the arbitration\n petition under \nsection 34\n is mandatory or directory\n\n 7\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n and the consequence, if any, for non-compliance of\n such prior notice ?\n\n3. The petitioner in Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of\n2017 began the arguments on these issue first and thus the facts in\nthe said arbitration petition which are relevant for the purpose of\ndeciding these preliminary issues raised by the respondents are\nsummarized in this order.\n\n4. The respondents had invited the bids for setting up flying\nschools at 11 airports all over India including two at Surat Airport. The\nfinal bid of the petitioner was accepted by the respondents. The\npetitioner accepted all the terms and conditions of the allotment letter\nsent by the respondents. The respondents issued a modification by a\nletter of allotment to the petitioner on 28 th March, 2008. The petitioner\naccepted the terms and conditions of the letter of allotment as well as\nmodification thereto on 4th April, 2008. The dispute arose between the\nparties.\n\n5. On 28th February, 2011, the petitioner issued a notice\ninvoking arbitration agreement to the respondents to settle the claims\nbetween the parties. The petitioner sent a reminder to the\nrespondents on 7th April, 2011 and once again called upon to appoint\na sole arbitrator. On 5th January, 2012, the respondents issued a\nnotice of termination of agreement. The petitioner filed an application\nunder \nsection 11\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 for\nseeking an appointment of a sole arbitrator. On 4 th December, 2012,\nthe learned designate of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of this Court\ndisposed of the said Arbitration Application No.67 of 2012 and\n\n 8\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nreferred the disputes between the parties by appointing a sole\narbitrator. On 12th April, 2017, the learned arbitrator rendered an\naward thereby rejecting the claims made by the petitioner and partly\nallowing the counter claim made by the respondent. Being aggrieved\nby the said award, the petitioner herein lodged this arbitration petition\nunder \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 on 11 th\nJuly, 2017 which was taken on file on 21st August, 2017.\n\n6. \nSections 34 (5)\n and \n34(6)\n were inserted by the \nArbitration\n& Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n dated 31st December, 2015\nwith effect from 23rd October, 2015 (for short the said \"Amendment\nAct\") which read thus :-\n\n \"(5) An application under this section shall be\n filed by a party only after issuing a prior notice to the\n other party and such application shall be\n accompanied by an affidavit by the applicant\n endorsing compliance with the said requirement.\n\n (6) An application under this section shall be\n disposed of expeditiously, and in any event, within a\n period of one year from the date on which the notice\n referred to in sub-section (5) is served upon the other\n party.\"\n\n7. Learned counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary\nobjection that since the petitioners had not issued prior notice to the\nrespondents of filing this application under \nsection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, this application could not have\nbeen filed by the petitioner before issuance of such prior notice and\nthus the arbitration petition under \nsection 34\n is not maintainable and\ndeserves to be dismissed on that ground alone. It is also urged by the\nrespondents in their brief preliminary objection raised at the threshold\n\n 9\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthat the said provision is mandatory and not directory. In view of this\npreliminary objection raised by the respondents through their\nrespective counsel, I have heard the learned counsel for the parties\non these preliminary objections.\n\n8. Mr.Mehta, learned senior counsel for the petitioner in\nCommercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of 2017 submits that the\nnotice invoking arbitration agreement was admittedly issued by the\npetitioner on 28th February, 2011, which was immediately received by\nthe respondent. The respondent did not agree to the appointment of\nany arbitrator. The petitioner had thus filed an arbitration application\nunder \nsection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 before\nthis Court in the year 2012. He submits that the then designate of the\nHon'ble Chief Justice by an order dated 4 th December, 2012 had\nappointed a former Judge of this Court as a sole arbitrator and\nreferred the disputes between the parties to the arbitration of the\nlearned arbitrator. He submits that in view of the petitioner invoking\narbitration agreement as far back as on 28 th February, 2011, the\narbitral proceedings had already commenced upon receipt of the said\nnotice invoking arbitration agreement by the respondent which was\nmuch prior to insertion of \nsection 34(5)\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 in \nsection 34\n which was inserted with effect\nfrom 23rd October, 2015.\n\n9. It is submitted by the learned senior counsel that merely\nbecause the arbitral award came to be rendered on 12th April, 2017\ni.e. after the said provision of \nsection 34(5)\n was inserted in \nsection\n34\n, the said provision under \nsection 34(5)\n cannot be made applicable\nto the arbitral proceedings which had commenced prior to 23 rd\n\n 10\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nOctober, 2015. He submits that merely because this arbitration\npetition was filed after the said provision of \nsection 34(5)\n was\ninserted, the said provision cannot be made applicable to the\narbitration application filed under \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996. The Court has to consider whether the arbitral\nproceedings had already commenced prior to 23rd October, 2015 or\nnot and not as to when the arbitration petition under \nsection 34\n was\nfiled by the petitioner challenging an award arising out of such arbitral\nproceedings which had commenced prior to 23rd October, 2015.\n\n10. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on \nsection 26\n of\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 which reads\nthus :-\n\n \"26. Act not to apply to pending arbitral\n proceedings. - Nothing contained in this Act shall\n apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced, in\n accordance with the provisions of \nsection 21\n of the\n principal Act, before the commencement of this Act\n unless the parties otherwise agree but this Act shall\n apply in relation to arbitral proceedings commenced\n on or after the date of commencement of this Act.\"\n\n \nSection 85\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nreads thus :-\n\n \"85. Repeal and saving :-\n\n (1) \nThe Arbitration (Protocol and Convention)\n Act, 1937\n (6 of 1937), the \nArbitration Act, 1940\n (10 of\n 1940) and the \nForeign Awards (Recognition and\n Enforcement) Act, 1961\n (45 of 1961) are hereby\n repealed.\n\n (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, -\n\n 11\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n (a) the provisions of the said enactments shall\n apply in relation to arbitral proceedings which\n commenced before this Act came into force unless\n otherwise agreed by the parties but this Act shall\n apply in relation to arbitral proceedings which\n commenced on or after this Act comes into force;\n\n (b) all rules made and notifications published,\n under the said enactments shall, to the extent to\n which they are not repugnant to this Act, be deemed\n respectively to have been made or issued under this\n Act.\"\n\n11. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on clause 20 of\nthe agreement entered into between the parties which recorded the\narbitration agreement, which is extracted as under :-\n\n \"20. All disputes and differences arising out of\n or in any way touching or concerning this Agreement\n (except those the decision whereof is otherwise herein\n before expressly provided for or to which the \nPublic\n Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act,\n 1971\n and the rules framed thereunder which are now\n in force or which may hereafter come into forces are\n applicable shall be referred to the sole arbitration of a\n person to be appointed by the chairman of the\n Authority on in case the designation of Chairman is\n changed or his office is abolished by the person for\n the time being entrusted, whether or not in addition to\n other functions with the functions of the Chairman.\n Airports Authority of India, by whatever designation\n such person may be called and if the arbitrator so\n appointed and willing to act, to sole arbitration of some\n other person to be similarly appointed and willing to\n\n 12\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n act as such arbitrator. It will be no objection to any\n such appointment that the arbitrator so appointed is a\n servant of the Authority and that he had to deal with\n the matters to which this Agreement relates and that in\n the course of his duties as such servant of Authority\n he had expressed views on all or any of the matters in\n dispute or difference. The award of the arbitrator so\n appointed shall be final and binding on the parties.\n The Arbitrator may with the consent of the parties\n extend from time to time then time for making the\n publishing the award.\"\n\n12. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in case of \nThyssen Stahlunion GMBH vs. Steel\nAuthority of India Limited\n, (1999) 9 SCC 334 and in particular\nparagraphs 2, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 32 and 33. He\nalso placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in case of The\nBoard of Trustees of the Port of Mumbai vs. M/s.Afcons\nInfrastructure Limited, (2016) SCC OnLine Bom. 10037 and in\nparticular paragraph 289. He submits that since in the arbitration\nagreement recorded in clause 20 of the License Agreement dated 6th\nJune, 2008, the parties had not agreed that the parties will be also\nbound by the provisions of any statutory amendment to the \nArbitration\n& Conciliation Act, 1996\n or any repeal thereto section 34(5) of the\nAmendment Act, which is brought into effect with effect from 23 rd\nOctober, 2015 cannot apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced\nprior to 23rd October, 2015.\n\n13. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner also placed\nreliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of \nMilkfood\nLimited vs. GMC Ice Cream (P) Limited\n, (2004) 7 SCC 288 and in\nparticular paragraphs, 2, 8, 9, 10, 22, 47, 50, 51, 54, 57 and 90 to\nbuttress his argument that the arbitral proceedings had commenced\n\n 13\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nin view of the notice issued under \nsection 21\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996. He submits that in \nthe said judgment\n, the\nSupreme Court had considered the issue as to whether the\nprovisions of the \nArbitration Act, 1940\n shall apply or the provisions of\nthe \nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n would apply to the pending\narbitral proceedings.\n\n14. Mr.Mehta, also invited my attention to the judgment\ndelivered by a learned single Judge of this Court in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World vs. The Board of Control\n for\nCricket in India, (2016) SCC OnLine 6064 and in particular\nparagraphs 10, 11, 12, 17 and 20 to 23. He submits that the second\npart of section 26 of the Amendment Act does not provide that it\nwould apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced earlier and prior\nto the amendment having brought into force. He submits that since\nthe rights had been accrued in favour of the petitioner under the\nunamended provisions of the \nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n, the\nsame cannot be taken away impliedly or explicitly by virtue of\ninsertion of \nsection 34(5)\n by the Amendment Act with effect from 23rd\nOctober, 2015. He submits that the arbitration proceedings in Court\ncannot be considered as continuation of the arbitral proceedings\nbefore the learned arbitrator.\n\n15. It is submitted that in the judgment of this Court in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra), learned single Judge has\ninterpreted section 36 of the Amendment Act and not the rights of the\nparties under \nsections 34\n and \n37\n of the Act. He submits that in any\nevent \nthe said judgment\n was not dealing with \nsection 34\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 which section is invoked by the\n\n 14\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\npetitioner for challenging the impugned award.\n \nIn support of this\nsubmission, learned senior counsel invited my attention to\nparagraphs 46, 49, 52, 53, 56 to 58, 62, 65, 66, 67 and 78 of \nthe said\njudgment\n in case of M/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) and\nwould submit that paragraphs 22(5) and 32 of the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in case of \nThyssen Stahlunion GMBH\n (supra) have\nnot been considered by the learned single Judge of this Court in \nthe\nsaid judgment\n of M/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra).\n\n16. Mr.Mehta, learned senior counsel also invited my attention\nto the judgment delivered by the learned single Judge of this Court in\ncase of \nEnercon GmbH vs. Yogesh Mehra & Ors.\n, 2017 SCC\nOnLine Bom. 1744 and in particular paragraphs 29, 36 and 45. He\nsubmits that \nin that case\n the arbitration petition was filed admittedly\nunder \nsection 34\n after 23rd October, 2015 and thus that judgment\nwould not assist the case of the respondent and is clearly\ndistinguishable in the facts of this case.\n\n17.

In his alternate submission, it is submitted by the learned\nsenior counsel that \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n have to be read together.\nHe submits that the purpose and intent of the legislation in inserting\n\nsection 34(5)\n and (6) in \nsection 34\n by virtue of the provisions of the\nAmendment Act was that the proceedings filed under \nsection 34\n shall\nbe heard expeditiously. He submits that the period of one year is\ncontemplated for the disposal of the application under \nsection 34\n from\nthe date of service of notice under the provisions of \nsection 34(5)\n. He\nsubmits that \nsection 34(5)\n refers to issuance of notice and does not\nprovide the mode and manner of service of notice. Whether a copy of\nthe arbitration petition is also required to be served upon the\nrespondent or not is also not provided in the said provision. He\nsubmits that the said provisions also do not provide for any\nconsequences in case of any default for not issuing the notice under\n\nsection 34(5)\n before filing of the arbitration petition or if the arbitration\npetition is not disposed of within one year from the date of service of\nthe notice under \nsection 34(5)\n.\n\n19. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in case of \nVidyawati Gupta & Ors. vs. Bhakti\nHari Nayak & Ors.\n, (2006) 2 SCC 777 and in particular paragraphs\n\n 16\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n16, 22, 49, 51 and 52.

He submits that no\nspecific right is created in favour of the respondent even if no prior\nnotice before filing of the arbitration petition under \nsection 34\n is\nissued to the respondent. The said provision is not a penal provision.\nIt is submitted that the rules framed by this Court and more\nparticularly Rule 803-B substantially protects the interest of the\nrespondent.\n\n21. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of\nthe Madras High Court in case of M/s.Jumbo \nBags Limited vs. The\nNew India Assurance Co. Ltd.\n, (2016) 2 LW 769 and in particular\nparagraph 20. He submits that in \nthe said judgment\n, the Madras High\nCourt has considered the amended \nsection 11\n(6-\nA) of the\nAmendment Act\n and had held that \nsection 26\n makes it quite clear that\nunless the parties agree, the provisions of the principal Act would\ncontinue to apply and those provisions would be applicable only to\n\n 17\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthe arbitral proceedings commenced on or after 23rd October, 2015.\n\n22.

Mr.Shyam Mehta, learned senior counsel for the petitioner\nin Arbitration Petition No.434 of 2017 distinguished the judgment of\nPatna High Court in case of \nBihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank Samiti\nBihar vs. State of Bihar & Others\n, delivered on 28th October, 2016\nin Letters Patent Appeal NO.1841 of 2016 on the ground that the\nPatna High Court has not considered that no consequences/effect of\nnon-compliance of the procedure prescribed under \nsection 34(5)\n is\nconsidered by the Patna High Court in \nthe said judgment\n. He also\ninvited my attention to paragraphs 57, 59, 78 and 82 of \nthe said\njudgment\n.\n\n24. Mr.Sanjay Jain, learned counsel appearing in the\nCommercial Arbitration Petition No.236 of 2017 adopts the\nsubmissions of Mr.Mehta in Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of\n2017 and made various additional submissions on the preliminary\nissues.\n\n 18\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n25. Learned counsel invited my attention to the report of the\nLaw Commission of India dated 5th August, 2014 suggesting various\namendments to the \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n and more\nparticularly the Note in respect of \nsection 34(5)\n which provides that\nthe said provision has been included to streamline the process and to\ncut-short the long delays which accrued due to issue of Court notice.\nHe submits that the interpretation of a provision has to be done to\nachieve the object of the enactment i.e. to avoid delays involved in\nthe service of notice by the Court. The object is not to prevent the\npetition being filed. The interpretation has to be textual as well as\ncontextual i.e. purposive interpretation.\n\n26. \nSection 34(5)\n does not prescribe the nature of the notice or\nthe contents of the notice and the said provision is vague. He also\nplaced reliance on \nsection 34(6)\n which was also inserted by the said\nAmendment Act and would submit that if the provision of \nsection\n34(5)\n is read with \nsection 34(6)\n, a party could issue and serve a\nnotice on the 1st day of service of the award and file a petition under\n\nsection 34\n on the 120th day. In such a situation, the period available\nto the Court to dispose of the \nsection 34\n petition would be only 8\nmonths which could not have been an intention of the legislature.\n\n27. It is submitted by the learned counsel that \nsection 34(5)\n of\nthe Act does not provide for any consequences of non compliance\nand leaves the consequences of non compliance to the discretion of\nthe Court. He submits that the Arbitration and Conciliation At, 1996\ncontains several provisions which provides consequences of non\ncompliance thereof. There are several other provisions where no\nconsequences are provided for non compliance thereof. He submits\n\n 19\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthat the legislature thus where it wanted certain consequences to\nfollow has prescribed such consequences in case of non compliance\nof such provisions. The intention of the legislature in not providing for\nany consequences is deliberate such that the equity jurisdiction of the\nCourt or the discretion of the Court is not affected or curtailed in any\nmanner. This omission to provide consequences has also to be seen\nin the light of the object to be achieved which is to ensure that the\nrespondent immediately gets notice of filing of the petition or the\nintended filing of the petition and save him from expenses of\nprosecuting remedies as if a challenge under \nsection 34\n has not been\nlaid.\n\n28. It is submitted by the learned counsel that the right to\nchallenge an award is a vested right. It vests on the date of\ncommencement of arbitral proceedings in accordance with \nsection 21\n\nof the Act. He invited my attention to the judgment of this Court in\ncase of M/s.Rendezvous \nSports World vs. Board of Control\n for\nCricket in India dated 8th August, 2016 in Chamber Summons\nNo.1530 of 2015 and more particularly paragraphs 50 and 53. He\nsubmits that the rights of the petitioner as prevailing on the date of\ncommencement of arbitral proceedings in the present case was prior\nto 23rd October,2015. Such right did not have any such pre-\nconditions. An impediment now created by \nsection 34(5)\n cannot\naffect the vested right. Though processual in nature, an impediment\nwhich affects a vested right, has to be treated as prospective and\ncannot be given a retrospective effect. He placed reliance on \nsection\n6\n of the General Clauses Act and would submit that the said provision\nclearly protects rights already vested and accrued in favour of any\nparty which cannot be taken away by any amendment or a repeal\n\n 20\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nunless it is so provided in such amendment.\n\n29. It is submitted by the learned counsel that the \nArbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996\n is a completed code qua arbitral\nproceedings. \nThe Act\n clarifies that the arbitral tribunal shall not be\nbound by the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 or the\n\nEvidence Act, 1872\n. The \nCode of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 is however\napplicable to the proceedings under the \nArbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996\n in Court. The \nCode of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 gives ample\npowers to the Court to dispense with the requirement of notice or to\nwaive the same in appropriate matters under section 151 or to extend\nthe time to issue the notice under section 148. \nThe Arbitration Act\n\nrecognizes party autonomy.\n\n30. It is submitted by the learned counsel that section 26 of the\nAmendment Act permits parties to agree \"otherwise\". The respondent\nby not objecting and by not issuing a notice under \nsection 34(5)\n has\nagreed otherwise. The petitioner has served the notice along with\ncopy of the arbitration petition upon the respondent on 18th April, 2017\nand has complied with or in any event substantially complied with the\nrequirement under \nsection 34(5)\n of the Arbitration Act. It is submitted\nby the learned counsel that the respondent can also waive a notice as\nrequired under \nsection 34(5)\n. \nSection 4\n of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, which provides for a waiver are applicable to the\nfacts of this case. He submits that the respondent did not object to\nthe filing of the petition for want of prior notice under \nsection 34(5)\n\nwhen the petitioner had applied for condonation of delay by filing a\nnotice of motion and when the same was argued by the petitioner.\n\n 21\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n31. It is submitted that the petitioner in this case has also filed\na notice of motion inter-alia praying for a declaration that the\npetitioner has complied with \nsection 34(5)\n of the Arbitration Act. No\naffidavit in reply is filed by the respondent to the said notice of motion\ntill date. He submits that the respondent has also filed an arbitration\npetition without issuing any notice under \nsection 34(5)\n of the\nArbitration Act to the petitioner.\n\n32. Learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to\n\nsection 34(6)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and would\nsubmit that there is no consequence provided in the said provision\nalso, if the application challenging an impugned award under \nsection\n34\n is not disposed of within a period of one year from the date of\neffecting service of the notice referred in \nsection 34(5)\n. He also\nplaced reliance on \nsection 11(13)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996 and would submit that even the said provision\ncontemplates disposal of proceedings under \nsection 11(6)\n of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 within 60 days from the date of\nservice of notice on the opposite party. He submits that the said\nprovision also does not provide for any consequence if the said\napplication is not disposed of within 60 days from the date of service\nof the notice on the other side.\n\n33. Learned counsel for the petitioner also placed reliance on\n\nsections 8(1)\n, \n16(2)\n, \n25(a)\n and \n34(3)\n and would submit that those\nprovisions clearly provides for consequences of not complying with\nthose provisions which consequences are absent in \nsection 34(5)\n and\n\n34(6)\n in those newly added provisions. Learned counsel appearing\nfor the petitioner placed reliance on following judgments :-\n\n 22\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\na).

Learned counsel submits that if the consequence is not\n\n 23\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nprovided for compliance of any particular provision, such provision\nhas to be construed as directory and not mandatory. Such provision\ncan be also waived. He also placed reliance on the Bombay High\nCourt (Original Side) Rules and more particularly Rule 227 providing\nfor six months time for issuance of notice by the Court in arbitration\nmatters. He also placed reliance on \nsection 80\n of the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908 and \nsection 527\n of the Mumbai Municipal\nCorporation Act, 1882.\n\n35. It is submitted by the learned counsel that \nsection 34(5)\n\nonly refers to issuance of prior notice and does not contemplate filing\nof the arbitration application impugning an arbitral award after service\nof the notice to the other party whereas \nsection 34(6)\n contemplates\nperiod of disposal of arbitration application within one year from the\ndate of service of notice upon other party. He submits that in view of\nsuch conflicting provision, the Court can compute disposal of the\narbitration application from the date of filing petition or from the date\nof issuance of the Court notice. He submits that thus the notice\ncontemplated under \nsection 34(5)\n has to be considered as directory\nand cannot be considered as mandatory.\n\n36. Mr.Jain, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\nsection 26 of the Amendment Act does not apply to the pending\narbitral proceedings as on 23rd October, 2015. He led emphasis on\nthe words \"nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the arbitral\nproceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of section\n21 of the Principal Act before commencement of this Act\". He submits\nthat the phrases \" commenced\" and \"arbitral proceedings\" used in the\nsaid \nsection 26\n are only to identify the beginning point of the\n\n 24\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nproceedings to which the amendment will not apply. The\ncommencement of proceedings is identified as it is well settled\nprinciple of law that when the proceedings are to be governed and\ndecided in accordance with law prevalent on the date of institution of\nthe proceedings. He submits that the beginning point\n\"commencement of the arbitral proceedings\" is equated to the\ninstitution of the proceedings in Court.\n\n37. It is submitted that the phrase \"date of commencement of\nthe arbitral proceedings\" is a legal fiction and on the date of\ncommencement there are in fact no arbitral proceedings instituted. A\nrequest for reference of disputes to arbitration is the date of\ncommencement of the arbitral proceedings. It is submitted that the\nphrase \"arbitral proceedings\" is not a stand alone phrase but it is in\nconjunction with the words \"commenced in accordance with \nsection\n21\n\". Arbitral proceedings commences on such notice, irrespective of\nwhether the reference is ultimately made to the arbitral tribunal or not.\nIt only seeks to identify the date of commencement and not the\nnature of the proceedings to which it applies. It sets a time line i.e.\nstarting line. He submitted that the amended provisions inserted by\nthe said Amendment Act thus would apply to those arbitral\nproceedings where a notice under \nsection 21\n is issued after 23 rd\nOctober, 2015.\n\n38. Learned counsel refers to the phrase \"arbitral proceedings\"\n\nin various provisions of the \nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n and\nmore particularly in \nsections 9\n, \n13\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n27\n, \n29\n, \n29-A\n, \n30\n,\n\n31\n, \n31-A\n, \n32\n, \n34\n, \n38\n and \n77\n. He submits that the intention of the\nlegislature is thus clear that if the notice invoking arbitration\n\n 25\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nagreement is issued prior to 23rd October, 2015, then all such matters\nwould be governed by the provisions under the \nArbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996\n and not by the provisions of the Amendment\nAct.\n\n39. It is submitted that even in those cases where the notice\ninvoking the arbitration agreement is issued after 23 rd October, 2015\nand the arbitral proceedings have commenced after that date, insofar\nas the provisions under \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 inserted by the Amendment Act is concerned,\nthe same being directory and not mandatory, all such arbitration\npetitions filed without issuing such notice prior to the date of filing of\nthe arbitration petition cannot be dismissed on that ground. It is\nsubmitted that section 26 of the Amendment Act does not refer to two\ndifferent sets of the arbitral proceedings i.e. (i) before the arbitral\ntribunal and another before the Court.\n\n40. Mr.S.S. Kulkarni, learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner in Arbitration Petition No.624 of 2017 placed reliance on the\nLaw Commission Report and would submit that the said report also\ndoes not state whether the provisions of \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n are\nmandatory or directory though has described some of the other\nprovisions as mandatory. He placed reliance on \nsection 34(2)\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and would submit that the powers\nof the Court under such provision is not circumscribed by the\nprovision under \nsection 34(5)\n and are not subject to such provisions.\n\nSection 34(5)\n cannot be read in isolation but has to be read in that\ncontext. \nSection 34(1)\n confers substantive right on a party to\nchallenge an arbitral award. \nSection 34(5)\n provides merely for a\n\n 26\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nnotice which is by way of an intimation. No format of any such notice\nis contemplated under the said provision. Even if an oral intimation is\nissued to the other side, that may be sufficient. He submits that\n\nsection 34(5)\n is procedural in nature and thus the petitioner can\nalways amend the grounds before the petition is filed. The petitioner\nis not required to serve any proceedings along with notice. \nSection\n34(5)\n is totally silent about the mode and manner of effecting the\nservice of notice.\n\n41. Learned counsel then placed reliance on \nsection 34 (6)\n\nand would submit that even if an arbitration petition filed under\n\nsection 34\n is not decided within one year from the date of service of\nnotice under \nsection 34(5)\n of the Act, the Court does not cease to\nloose powers to decide such petitions and does not become functus\nofficio. The Court has to make an endeavor to decide such arbitration\npetition within one year from the date of service of notice under\n\nsection 34(5)\n and thus such provisions have to be construed as\ndirectory and not mandatory. Learned counsel placed reliance on the\ndictionary meaning of the term \"notice prescribed in Law of Lexicon.\nHe also placed reliance on section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Control\nAct, 1947 and submits that the Courts have construed the said\nprovision as mandatory after considering the wordings and the\nlegislative intent for providing such provision. He submits that \nsection\n34(5)\n cannot be compared with \nsection 12(2)\n of the Rent Act. The\nsaid powers under \nsection 34(5)\n does not fatter upon the powers\nunder \nsections 34(1)\n and \n34(2)\n of the Act. Learned counsel cited the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in case of \nKailash vs. Nanhku &\nOrs.\n (2005) 4 SCC 480 and in particular paragraphs 23 to 28. It is\nsubmitted that even if a notice under \nsection 34(5)\n is not issued prior\n\n 27\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nto the date of filing of the arbitration petition, substantive remedy of\nthe aggrieved party cannot be taken away under \nsection 34(1)\n.\n\n42. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in case \nParasramka Commercial\nCompany vs. Union of India\n, 1969 (2) SCC 694 and in particular\nparagraph 5 in support of his submissions that even if a notice is\nissued by the petitioner to the respondent post filing of the petition, it\nwould amount to substantial compliance of provisions of \nsection 34(5)\n\nand the purpose of such notice would be served.\n\n43. Mr.Pujari, learned counsel appearing for the respondent in\nArbitration Petition No.238 of 2017 placed reliance on the unreported\njudgment delivered on 25th October,2013 in First Appeal No.302 of\n2013 in which this Court had considered \nsection 164\n of the\nMaharashtra Co-operative Societies Act in support of the submission\nthat since prior notice before filing arbitration petition was not issued\nby the petitioner in the said Arbitration Petition No.238 of 2017, the\npetition is not maintainable and deserves to be dismissed on that\nground alone. He submits that the said provision under \nsection 34(5)\n\nis mandatory and not directory. He also placed reliance on the\njudgment of this Court reported in 76 Company Cases 244 (Bom.) in\nsupport of this submission.\n\n44. Ms.Munim, learned counsel appearing for the respondent\nin Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of 2017 on the other hand\nsubmits that by virtue of insertion of \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n of the\nAmendment Act, the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 is not\nrepealed. The Ordinance did not contain any saving provision. The\n\n 28\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\narbitration ordinance was converted into the Amendment Act with\ninsertion of \nsection 26\n as a saving section.\n\n45. It is submitted that there is no period prescribed under\n\nsection 34(5)\n for issuance of prior notice before filing an arbitration\npetition challenging the award. The legislative intent of issuance of\nsuch prior notice is for expeditious disposal of the arbitration\nproceedings. She submits that if \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n are\nconstrued by this Court as directory and not mandatory, the whole\npurpose and legislative intent of expeditious disposal of the arbitration\nproceedings would be frustruted. It is submitted that the provisions of\n\nsection 3(5)\n and \n34(6)\n cannot be read in isolation but have to be read\nwith \nsection 34(1)\n and \nsection 34 (2)\n. \nSection 34(5)\n cannot be made\notiose by declaring it as directory. The notice period is not required to\nbe excluded by computing the period of limitation under \nsection 34(3)\n.\n\n46. Learned counsel invited my attention to the averments in\nthe Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of 2017 and would submit\nthat the notice invoking arbitration agreement was issued by the other\nparty on 20th February, 2011. The award was rendered by the learned\narbitrator on 12th April, 2017. On 5th June, 2017, the learned arbitrator\npassed an order under \nsection 33\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996. The arbitration petition was filed on 11 th July, 2017. She\nsubmits that admittedly the arbitral award is rendered after 23 rd\nOctober, 2015 and the arbitration petition also came to be filed after\n23rd October, 2015. She strongly placed reliance on the judgment of\nthis Court in case of M/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) and in\nparticular paragraphs 10, 11, 21, 25 to 28, 33, 34, 52, 53, 57, 58 and\n78 and also in case of \nEnercon GmbH\n (supra) and in particular\n\n 29\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nparagraphs 24, 28, 32, 38, 40 and 44 in support of her submission\nthat though the notice invoking arbitration agreement was given prior\nto 23rd October, 2015 and the award was rendered after that date, all\nthe arbitration petitions challenging such award would be governed\nby \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n to be read with \nsection 34(1)\n and those\nprovisions thus will have to be complied with. She submits that there\nare two sets of arbitral proceedings contemplated under \nsection 26\n of\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 i.e. one before the arbitral\ntribunal and another in Court post award.\n\n47. Learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in case of \nThyssen Stahlunion GMBH\n (supra) and\nsubmits that the phrase \"in relation to the arbitral proceedings\" cannot\nbe given a narrow meaning to mean only the pendency of the\narbitration proceedings before the learned arbitrator but would also\ncover the proceedings before the Court. She submits that saving\nsection thus becomes exhaustive and takes within fold two different\ntypes of proceedings arising out of the \nArbitration & Conciliation Act,\n1996\n. \nSection 6\n of the General Clauses Act becomes applicable. She\nsubmits that by all necessary implication, the amendments introduced\nby the Amendment Act will apply to the proceedings other than the\narbitral proceedings even though the said proceedings may have\ncommenced prior to 23rd October, 2015.\n \nShe submits that this Court\nhas already held in \nthe said judgment\n in M/s.Rendezvous \nSports\nWorld\n (supra) that the object of the amendment to \nsection 26\n can be\nfulfilled only by holding the saving \nsection 26\n exhaustive.\n \nIt is\nsubmitted by the learned counsel that this Court in case of \nEnercon\nGmbH\n (supra) has also dealt with the effect of section 26 of the\nAmendment Act.\n\n 30\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n48. It is submitted that in view of the fact that the arbitration\npetition has been filed after Amendment Act came into force and in\nview of the fact that the saving clause 26 does not save post arbitral\nproceedings under \nsection 34\n from the application of the Amendment\nAct, the mandatory provisions of \nsection 34(5)\n will be applicable to\nthis matter and the petitioner not having complied with this mandatory\nrequirement, the arbitration petition deserves to be dismissed, as not\nmaintainable. She submits that issuance of a notice is a sine qua non\nbefore filing of a challenge petition. It is submitted that \nsection 34(1)\n\nclearly provides that a recourse to Court against an arbitral award\nmay be made only by an application for setting aside such an award\nin accordance with sub-\nsections 2\n, \n3\n and \n5\n. A petition which is not in\ncompliance of the requirement of \nsection 34\n is not valid and is not\nmaintainable. She led emphasis on the word \"shall\" used in \nsection\n34(5)\n and would submit that the said word would clearly indicate that\nthe petition itself could be filed only after compliance of the\nmandatory notice and not otherwise.\n\n49. Learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in case of \nUnion of India & Ors. vs. A.K. Pandey\n\nholding that it is the duty of the Courts of justice to try to get the real\nintention of the legislature by considering the whole scope of the\nstatutes. She placed reliance on the words \"an application under\n\nsection 34(1)\n shall be disposed in any event within a period of one\nyear from the date of such notice referred to in sub-\nsection 5\n is\nserved\". She submits that the word \"only\" is an exclusive word and\nindicates the legislative intent that the section is mandatory. She\nplaced reliance on \nsection 25\n of the Law Commission Report in\n\n 31\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nsupport of this submission.\n\n50. Learned counsel placed reliance on \nsection 11(13)\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and would submit that in the said\nprovision, a mandate is provided that the High Court or the Supreme\nCourt as the case may be shall decide an application as expeditiously\nas possible and an endeavor shall be made to dispose of the matter\nwithin a period of 60 days from the date of service of the notice on the\nopposite parties. The words \"in any event\" are not used in the said\nprovision, whereas such words are used in section 34(6) of the\nAmendment Act. She submits that the effect of \nsection 34(5)\n is clearly\nto impose a bar against the institution of the application under \nsection\n34(1)\n and the same is the only legislative purpose and intent to\ndispose of the challenge applications within a period of one year from\nissuance of the notice impugning an award.\n\n51. Learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance on the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in case of \nSharif-ud-Din vs. Abdul\nGani Lone\n, AIR 1980 SC 303 and would submit that in \nthe said\njudgment\n, it is held by the Supreme Court that whenever a statute\nprescribes that a particular act is to be done in a particular manner\nand also lays does failure to comply with the said requirement, leads\nto specific consequence and it would be difficult to hold that the\nrequirement is not mandatory.\n \nShe also placed reliance on the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in case of \nUnion of India vs.\nPopular Construction Company\n, (2001) 8 SCC 470 and in\nparticular paragraph 12.\n \nShe also placed reliance on the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in case of \nBihari Chowdhary & Anr. vs. State of\nBihar & Ors.\n, (1984) 2 SCC 627 and would submit that since the\n\n 32\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nlanguage used in \nsection 34(5)\n is clear and unambiguous, it is the\nduty of the Court to give effect to such legislative intent and has to\nconstrue such provisions strictly.\n\n52.

Mr.Ashish Kamat, learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondent in Arbitration Petition No.624 of 2017 adopted the\nsubmissions made by Ms.Munim, learned counsel for the respondent\nin Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of 2017 and would submit\nthat the object and purpose of introducing the \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n\nis expeditious disposal of the arbitration petitions challenging an\narbitral award. Such provisions are mandatory in its nature. The\narbitration petition challenging the arbitral award can be filed only\npost issuance of such mandatory notice. The obligation to issue such\nnotice is on the party who seeks to challenge an arbitral award. The\nduty is cast on the office of the Court to ensure that due compliance\nof such mandatory notice is made by the petitioner before filing of the\narbitration petition under \nsection 34\n.\n\n59. It is submitted by the learned counsel that \nsection 34(5)\n\nprovides for an implied consequence of non-compliance of issuance\n\n 36\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nof the mandatory notice. Though there is no specific consequence\nprovided in \nsection 34(6)\n, if such arbitration application is not\ndisposed of within one year from the date of service of the notice\nunder \nsection 34(5)\n upon the respondent, the period of one year may\nbe curtailed and such arbitration petition has to be disposed of by the\nCourt within the balance period left after service of such notice upon\nthe respondent. He submits that a party who deliberately delays filing\nof the petition cannot be benefited. Even if the provisions of \nsection\n34(6)\n is not mandatory, the provisions of \nsection 34(5)\n is mandatory.\n\n60. Mr.Jain, learned counsel for the petitioner in Commercial\nArbitration Petition No.236 of 2017 in rejoinder placed reliance on\nparagraph 289 of the judgment of this Court in case of \nThe Board of\nTrustees of the Port of Mumbai\n (supra) and distinguished the\njudgment of this Court in case of M/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n\n(supra) by placing reliance on paragraphs 45, 62, 65, 66 and 78 and\nwould submit that in \nthe said judgment\n, learned single Judge of this\nCourt has only decided the said matter based on the applicability of\n\nsection 36\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. In support of\nthis submission, he invited my attention to the paragraphs 10 to 12,\n26, 27, 46, 52, 58 and 59 of \nthe said judgment\n. He submits that in \nthe\nsaid judgment\n, the learned single Judge has not based her decision\non construing section 26 of the Amendment Act but \nthe entire\njudgment\n is based on the issue involved in \nthe said judgment\n about\nthe applicability of \nsection 36\n in the pending arbitration petitions prior\nto 23rd October, 2015.\n \nHe once again led emphasis on paragraph\n22(5) of the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of \nThyssen\nStahlunion GMBH\n (supra). He submits that the right to file an\napplication under section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n 37\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n1996 had accrued in favour of the petitioner when the petitioner had\ninvoked the arbitration agreement by issuing a notice and when the\nsame was received by the other side in view of \nsection 21\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. He submits that at the most, the\nCourt can construe that the requirement of notice under \nsection 34(5)\n\nintroduced by the Amendment Act would provide an additional\ncondition and not mandatory condition.\n\n REASONS AND CONCLUSIONS :\n\n61. Since the main arguments are advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the parties in Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of\n2017 and Commercial Arbitration Petition No.236 of 2017, I shall\nbriefly indicate the admitted facts which are relevant for the purpose\nof deciding the legal issues raised by the respondent in these batch\nof petitions.\n\n62. Insofar as Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of 2017\nis concerned, the petitioner had issued a notice invoking arbitration\nclause on 28th February, 2011. On 4th December, 2012, the learned\ndesignate of the Chief Justice appointed the sole arbitrator in an\napplication filed by the petitioner under \nsection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act, 1996. On 23 rd October, 2015, the Amendment Act\ncame into effect. On 12th April, 2017, learned arbitrator made an\naward i.e. after the Amendment Act came into force. On 21 st August,\n2017, the petitioner filed this arbitration petition. The respondent has\nraised a plea in the affidavit in reply dated 5th October, 2017 about the\nmaintainability of this petition in view of non-issuance of prior notice\nby the petitioner under section 34(5) of the Amendment Act.\n\n63. Insofar as Commercial Arbitration Petition No.236 of 2017\n\n 38\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nis concerned, the petitioner had issued a notice invoking arbitration\nagreement on 14th June, 2014. Learned arbitrator accepted his\nnomination and entered upon the reference on 7 th August, 2014.\nLearned arbitrator made an award on 25 th November, 2016. The\npetitioner filed this arbitration petition on 12 th April, 2017. The\nrespondent has raised an objection about the maintainability of this\npetition on the ground that the notice under section 34(5) of the\nAmendment Act has not been served upon the respondent before\nfiling this petition across the bar.\n\n64. On perusal of the aforesaid admitted facts, it is clear that in\nboth these matters the arbitration agreements were invoked much\nprior to 23rd October, 2015. The arbitral awards are delivered by the\nArbitral Tribunal after 23rd October, 2015. Both the Arbitration\nPetitions have been filed under \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 after 23rd October, 2015.\n\n65. Insofar as Commercial Arbitration Petition No.434 of 2017\nis concerned, the arbitration agreement is recorded in clause 20 of\nthe agreement dated 6th June, 2008 between the parties to this\npetition. The arbitration agreement does not provide that in case of\nany dispute arising between the parties in future under the said\narbitration agreement, the parties will be governed not only by the\nprovisions of the \nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n but also by any\nstatutory repeal thereto or any amendment thereto.\n\n66. Insofar as Commercial Arbitration Petition No.236 of 2017\nis concerned, the arbitration agreement is recorded in clause 25 of\nthe Terminalling / Handling Services Agreement dated 5 th August,\n\n 39\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n2011. The arbitration agreement provides that the provision of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n or any statutory modification or\nre-enactment thereof and the rules made thereunder for the time\nbeing in force shall apply to the arbitration proceedings under the said\nprovision.\n\n67. By section 27 of the Amendment Act, the Arbitration and\nConciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 is repealed. \nSection 21\n of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides that unless agreed by\nthe parties, the arbitral proceedings in respect of a particular dispute\ncommence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be\nreferred to arbitration is received by the respondent. \nSection 43\n of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides that for the purposes\nof this section and the \nLimitation Act, 1963\n (36 of 1963), an arbitration\nshall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred in section\n\n21.\n\n68. The Supreme Court in case of \nThyssen Stahlunion\nGMBH\n (supra) has construed \nsection 85(1)(a)\n of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act and has held that the provisions of \nArbitration Act,\n1940\n shall apply in relation to the arbitral proceedings which are\ncommenced before coming into force of the \nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\n. Supreme Court has held that in the cases\nwhere arbitral proceedings have commenced before coming into\nforce of the New Act (1996 Act) and are pending before the Arbitrator,\nit is open to the parties to agree that new Act be applicable to such\narbitral proceedings and they can so agree even before the coming\ninto force of the new Act. The new Act would be applicable in relation\nto arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after the new Act\n\n 40\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\ncomes into force.\n\n69. It is held that once the arbitral proceedings have\ncommenced, it cannot be stated that right to be governed by the old\nAct for enforcement of the award was an inchoate right. It was\ncertainly a right accrued. It is not imperative that for right to accrue to\nhave the award enforced under the old Act that some legal\nproceedings for its enforcement must be pending under that Act at\nthe time new Act came into force. If narrow meaning of the phrase \"in\nrelation to arbitral proceedings\" is to be accepted, it is likely to create\ngreat deal of confusion with regard to the matters where award is\nmade under the old Act. Provisions for the conduct of arbitral\nproceedings are vastly different in both the old and the New Act. An\ninterpretation which leads to unjust and inconvenient results cannot\nbe accepted. A foreign award given after the commencement of the\nnew Act can be enforced only under the new Act.\n\n70. The Supreme Court held that the provisions of the old Act\nshall apply in relation to the arbitral proceedings which commenced\nbefore the new Act came into force unless otherwise agreed by the\nparties and (2) new Act shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings\nwhich commenced on or after the new Act came into force. The old\nAct will apply to whole gambit of arbitration culminating in the\nenforcement of the award. If it was not so, only the word \"to\" could\nhave sufficed and when the legislature has used the expression \"in\nrelation to\", a proper meaning has to be given. It is held that the first\nlimb of \nsection 85(2)(a)\n is not a limited saving clause. It saves not\nonly the proceedings pending at the time of commencement of the\nnew Act but also the provisions of the old Act for enforcement of the\n\n 41\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\naward under that Act. Multiple and complex problems would arise if\nthe award given under the old Act is said to be enforced under the\nnew Act. Both the Acts are vastly different to each other. It is held that\nwhen arbitration proceedings are held under the old Act, the parties\nand the arbitrator keep in view the provisions of that Act for the\nenforcement of the award. In paragraph (32) of \nthe said judgment\n, it\nis held that it is not necessary that for the right to accrue that legal\nproceedings must be pending when the new Act comes into force. To\nhave the award enforced when arbitral proceedings commenced\nunder the old Act under that very Act is certainly an accrued right.\n\n71. This Court in case of \nThe Board of Trustees of the Port\nof Mumbai vs. Afcons Infrastructure Limited\n (supra) has\nconsidered a situation where notice invoking arbitration agreement\nwas issued much prior to 23rd October, 2015. The arbitral award was\nrendered prior to 23rd October, 2015. The arbitration petition was filed\nin the year 2012 and was pending till 23 rd December, 2016. There\nwas no provision in the arbitration agreement that the parties would\nbe governed by not only the provisions of the \nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\n but also by the statutory amendment or\nrepealed thereto. This Court accordingly held that since the notice\ninvoking arbitration agreement was issued prior to 23rd October, 2015,\nthe provisions of amended \nsection 34\n brought into effect on 23rd\nOctober, 2015 would not be applicable to the facts of this case.\n\n72. \nIn case of \nPadmini C. Menon vs. Vijay C. Menon & Ors.\n\nin Arbitration Petition No.9 of 2015 in its judgment delivered on 10th\nJanuary,2018, this Court held that in view of there being an\nagreement between the parties that the parties would be governed\n\n 42\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:25 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nnot only by the \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n but also\nstatutory amendment or repeal thereto, though the arbitration\nproceedings had commenced prior to 23rd October, 2015, the\namendment inserted in \nsection 11\n as \nsection 11\n(6-A) would be\napplicable to the parties though the arbitration application filed by the\napplicant in the year 2015 was pending in this Court on 23 rd October,\n2015 and thereafter this Court after adverting to \nsection 85(2)(a)\n and\nsection 26 of the Amendment Act has held that section 26 of the\nAmendment Act is an non-obstante provision. If the parties agree that\nthe provisions contained in the said Amendment Act shall also apply\nto the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the\nprovisions of \nsection 21\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996,\nthe said amended provision would apply to such proceedings\ncommenced earlier, otherwise the Amendment Act shall apply in\nrelation to the arbitral proceedings on or after the date of\ncommencement of the Amendment Act.\n\n73. This Court held that in view of section 26 of the\nAmendment Act and in view of the specific agreement between the\nparties that the disputes will be settled not only in accordance with the\nprovisions of the \nArbitration & Conciliation, Act, 1996\n prevailing on the\ndate of the execution of the said agreement but also any statutory\nmodifications thereof, Amendment Act would apply even if arbitral\nproceedings had commenced prior to 23rd October, 2015. It is held\nthat \nsection 11\n(6-\nA) of the Amendment Act\n thus would apply to the\nparties. This Court also followed the earlier two judgments of this\nCourt in case of M/s.Amisha \nBuildcon Pvt. Ltd. vs. Jidnyasa Co-\n\nop.

In\nmy view, the principles \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in \nthe said\njudgment\n would apply to the facts of this case. I am respectively\nbound by \nthe said judgment\n.\n\n74. \nIn my view, the principles \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court\nin case of \nThyssen Stahlunion GMBH\n (supra) and judgments of this\nCourt in case of \nThe Board of Trustees of the Port of Mumbai vs.\nAfcons Infrastructure Limited\n (supra) and Padmini C. Menon vs.\nVijay C. Menon & Ors. (supra) would apply to the facts of this case.\nI am respectively bound by those judgments.\n\n75. A perusal of section 26 of the Amendment Act of 2015\nclearly indicates that unless the parties otherwise agree, no\nprovisions of the Amendment Act would apply to arbitral proceedings\ncommenced in accordance with the provisions of \nsection 21\n of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 prior to 23rd October, 2015. It\nalso makes it clear that the provisions of Amendment Act shall apply\nin relation to the arbitral proceedings commenced on or after the date\nof commencement of the Amendment Act. It is thus clear that if in an\narbitration agreement is entered into prior to 23rd October, 2015, and\nthe parties had agreed that the parties would be governed not only by\n\n 44\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthe provisions of the \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n but also by\nstatutory amendment thereto or repeal thereto and if the notice\ninvoking arbitration agreement under \nsection 21\n is received by the\nother party prior to 23rd October, 2015 when the arbitral proceedings\ncontemplated under \nsection 21\n is commenced, the party will be\ngoverned by not only the provisions of \nArbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996\n but also by the statutory amendments thereto or repeal\nthereto and not otherwise.\n\n76. If however there was no such agreement between the\nparties to apply the provisions of statutory amendments or repeal to\nthe \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n and the arbitral proceedings\nhave commenced prior thereto 23rd October, 2015 by virtue of \nsection\n21\n of the Arbitration Act, such arbitral proceedings will be governed\nby the provisions of the \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n before\nits amendment brought into effect by Amendment Act w.e.f. 23rd\nOctober, 2015 irrespective of the fact that the award is rendered after\n23rd October, 2015 or that the arbitration petition challenging an\naward is pending as on 23rd October, 2015 or filed thereafter.\n\n77. In my view, since the arbitral proceedings commences on\nreceipt of the notice invoking arbitration agreement by the other party\nas contemplated under \nsection 21\n read with \nsection 43\n of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, if such notice is received by the\nother side after 23rd October, 2015, the provisions of the Amendment\nAct would apply to such matters. The parties cannot agree that they\nwill not be bound by the provisions of the Amendment Act.\n\n78. The respondent has strongly placed reliance on the\n\n 45\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\njudgment delivered by a learned Single Judge of this Court in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) and also on the judgment\ndelivered by another learned Single Judge of this Court in case of\n\nEnercon GmBH\n (supra). Learned counsel appearing for the parties\nhave dealt with both these judgments threadbare for consideration of\nthis Court in support of their rival submissions.\n\n79. \nInsofar as the judgment M/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n\n(supra) is concerned, chamber summons was filed by the original\npetitioner who had filed application under \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration\nAct inter-alia praying for dismissal of the application for execution of\nthe arbitral award filed by the judgment debtor. The arbitral awards in\nthat matter were made on 22nd June, 2015, 22nd June, 2015 and 28th\nJanuary, 2015 respectively. Arbitration petitions were filed on 16th\nSeptember, 2015 challenging the arbitral awards. One of the\narbitration petition was admitted on 19th October, 2015. The question\nthat arose before this Court in the said matter was whether in respect\nof those awards which were delivered prior to 23rd October, 2015 and\nthe arbitration petitions also having been filed prior to 23rd October,\n2015, those awards would become enforceable only if and when\nthose petitions under \nsection 34\n were refused and not otherwise. A\nquestion was also before this Court that if Amendment Act is held\napplicable, whether after expiry of three months of the arbitral award,\nit becomes enforceable in accordance with the provisions \nof Code of\nCivil Procedure\n, irrespective of fact whether challenge has been filed\nunder \nsection 34\n of the Act or not.\n\n80. This Court recorded that there was no dispute between the\nparties as regards the specific meaning of the term arbitral\n\n 46\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nproceedings under the \nArbitration Act\n. This Court also recorded that\nthere was no dispute between the parties that the first part of \nsection\n26\n carries restrictive meaning that the proceedings before the arbitral\ntribunal which proceedings get terminated on passing of the final\naward. It is held that by necessary implication, the saving section\nbecomes exhaustive i.e. it takes within it's fold all different types of\nproceedings arising out of the \nArbitration Act\n. It is thus clear that in\nthat judgment, there was no contest between the parties that the first\npart of saving \nsection 26\n carries restrictive meaning that the\nproceedings before the arbitral tribunal which proceedings get\nterminated with passing of the final award. The parties in that\nproceedings also did not dispute that the \nsection 26\n was consisting of\ntwo parts i.e. the arbitral proceedings before arbitral tribunal which\nare terminated by virtue of an order under \nsection 32(1)\n and another\narbitral proceedings before Court of law.\n\n81. This Court held that if use of the verb \"has been\" is held to\nbe in \"present perfect tense\", \nsection 36\n of the Arbitration Act will be\napplicable not only to cases where a petition under \nsection 34\n of the\nArbitration Act is filed after 23rd October, 2015 but also to cases\nwhere a petition has been filed before 23rd October, 2015. It is held\nthat all the applications under \nsection 34\n pending in the Court for\nconsideration will attract \nsection 36(2)\n of the Amended Act. It is held\nthat the vested right of the award-debtor under \nsection 34\n of the\nArbitration Act is unaffected by the amendment to \nsection 36\n of the\nArbitration Act. It is held that by the amended \nsection 34\n of the\nArbitration Act, the shadow or impediment on the enforceability of the\narbitral award has been removed to enable a successful claimant to\nenforce the arbitral award, unless the award-debtor obtains an order\n\n 47\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nof interim stay from the Court under \nsection 36(3)\n of the Arbitration\nAct. The lifting of this shadow or impediment, on the enforceability of\nthe arbitral award operates only in future i.e. after 23rd October, 2015\non the basis of an existing state of affairs, even if the award was\npassed or the petition under \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration Act was filed\nbefore 23rd October, 2015. The Amended \nsection 36\n of the Arbitration\nAct cannot be said to operate retrospectively, its operation is\nprospective in nature. This Court accordingly dismissed the chamber\nsummons inter-alia praying for dismissing of the execution\napplication.\n\n82. A perusal of the judgment rendered by this Court in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) indicates that this Court has\nheld in \nthe said judgment\n that right vested in the party under \nsection\n34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act is unaffected and not taken\naway by the amendment to \nsection 36\n of the Arbitration Act. A vested\nright available to the award-debtor would be only in the matter of\nchallenge to the arbitral award which had remained intact. It is held\nthat \nsection 36\n of the Arbitration Act pertains only to the enforcement\nof an award and its executability. The original \nsection 34\n, imposed a\ndisability on the award-holder in executing the award during\npendency of the challenge to the award. It is held that the right to\ninterim relief cannot be a vested or accrued substantive right. The\ndisability imposed on the award-holder under original \nsection 36\n was\nabsolute. It is thus clear that even in \nthe said judgment\n, it is held by\nthis Court that insofar as right of an aggrieved party to challenge an\narbitral award is concerned, the said right is a vested right accrued to\nhim which is not affected by \nsection 36\n by virtue of insertion of such\namendment by the Amendment Act.\n\n 48\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n83. This Court in \nthe said judgment\n in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) held that the parties \nin that\ncase\n were ad-idem and both the parties had agreed that the term\n'arbitral proceedings' referred in section 26 of the Amendment Act\nrefers to two separate arbitral proceedings i.e. one before the arbitral\ntribunal before rendering of an award and another before this Court of\nlaw after rendering of an award. In these proceedings however\nMr.Jain learned counsel for the petitioner had strenuously urged\nbefore this Court that the term 'arbitral proceedings' used in section\n26 of the Amendment Act referred to only one arbitral proceedings\nwhich commences upon receipt of notice invoking arbitration\nagreement under \nsection 21\n of the Arbitration Act and not two\nseparate stages of arbitration proceedings i.e. one before the arbitral\ntribunal and another before this Court. In my view, he rightly placed\nreliance by the term 'arbitral proceedings' referred by the legislature in\nvarious sections and more particularly \nsections 9\n, \n13\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n21\n, \n22\n,\n\n27\n, \n29\n, \n29A\n, \n30\n, \n31\n, \n31A\n, \n32\n, \n34\n, \n38\n and \n77\n. In \nsection 31A(1)(IV)\n of\nthe Arbitration Act, the Court as well as the arbitral tribunal are\nempowered to award cost based on the expenses incurred in\nconnection with the arbitral and Court proceedings.\n\n84. The aforesaid provisions would clearly indicate that the\nterm 'arbitral proceedings' referred is only one arbitral proceedings\nwhich commences by virtue of the receipt of notice under \nsection 21\n\nof the Arbitration Act by the other party. The arbitral proceedings\ncommences even before a statement of claim is filed or even before\nappointment of an arbitral tribunal. In my view, the arbitral\nproceedings referred in section 26 of the Amendment Act and under\n\n 49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nvarious provisions of \nArbitration Act\n referred to aforesaid cannot be\nconstrued as proceedings before Court or cannot be construed as\ntwo separate proceedings at two different stages i.e. one which\ncommences on receipt of notice invoking arbitration agreement under\n\nsection 21\n and another before a Court i.e. at the stage of challenging\nan award or otherwise.\n\n85. In my view, a plain and simple interpretation of section 26\nof the Amendment Act on conjoint reading with other provisions of the\n\nArbitration Act\n referred to aforesaid wherein the term 'arbitral\nproceedings' are referred would clearly indicate that the provisions in\nthe \nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n prior to the provisions of\nAmendment Act having been brought into effect would apply to all the\narbitral proceedings wherein a notice invoking arbitration agreement\nunder \nsection 21\n was received by the other party prior to 23 rd\nOctober, 2015 and the provisions of the \nArbitration Act\n duly amended\nby the Amendment Act would apply to all the arbitral proceedings\nwhich have commenced after 23rd October, 2015 by virtue of a receipt\nof notice invoking arbitration agreement by other party in view of\n\nsection 21\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The phrase\n\"the date of commencement of the arbitral proceedings\" is a legal\nfiction and has to be read in conjunction with the words \"commenced\nin accordance with \nsection 21\n\".\n\n86. The judgment of this Court in case of M/s.Rendezvous\n\nSports World\n (supra) thus to this extent does not support the case of\nthe respondent but supports the case of the petitioner that the right to\nchallenge an arbitral award is vested in favour of the aggrieved party\nand cannot be taken away by virtue of an amendment.\n\n 50\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n87. The Supreme Court in case of Aravali Power Company\nPvt. Ltd. vs. M/s.Era Infra Engineering Ltd., 2017 SCC OnLine\n1072 has considered the applicability of the Amendment Act in a\nmatter where notice invoking arbitration agreement was issued prior\nto 23rd October, 2015. During the pendency of the arbitral\nproceedings, \nsection 12\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nwas amended by the same Amendment Act. The respondent before\nthe Supreme Court had invoked the amended provisions during the\npendency of the arbitration proceedings before the learned arbitrator\nand had raised objection that the learned arbitrator was disqualified\nbeing an employee in view of the amendment to \nsection 12(1)\n read\nwith 7th Schedule. The respondent had also filed an application under\n\nsection 14\n seeking termination of the mandate of the learned\narbitrator. High Court had entertained such application filed by the\nrespondent before the learned arbitrator and the petitioner before the\nHigh Court. Supreme Court has reversed the said view of the High\nCourt and has categorically held that in pre-amendment cases, the\nlaw \nlaid down in\n Northern Railway Administration's case must be\napplied and not otherwise.\n\n88. It is held by the Supreme Court in that case governed by\n1996 Act after the Amendment Act has come into force that if the\narbitration Clause finds foul with the amended provisions, the\nappointment of the Arbitrator even if apparently in conformity with the\narbitration Clause in the agreement, would be illegal and thus the\nCourt would be within its powers to appoint such arbitrator(s) as may\nbe permissible. The procedure as laid down in unamended \nsection\n12\n mandated disclosure of circumstances likely to give rise to\n\n 51\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\njustifiable doubts as to independence and impartiality of the Arbitrator.\nSupreme Court accordingly interfered with the order of the High Court\nexercising jurisdiction in that case and held that the High Court ought\nnot to have interfered with the process and progress of the arbitration.\n\nThe principles laid down by the Supreme Court in case of \nAravali\nPower Company Pvt. Ltd.\n (supra) squarely applies to the facts of\nthis case.\n \nThis judgment of the Supreme Court is delivered after the\ndate of delivery of the judgment of this Court in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) and in case of \nEnercon\nGmBH\n (supra).\n \nThis Court while delivering these judgments did not\nhave benefit of the judgment of Supreme Court in case of \nAravali\nPower Company Pvt. Ltd.\n (supra).\n\n89. \nIn my view, the judgment of this Court in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) holding that there are two\nstages of arbitral proceedings referred in section 26 of the\nAmendment Act is based on the consensus of the parties and even\notherwise contrary to the judgment of Supreme Court in case of\n\nAravali Power Company Pvt. Ltd.\n (supra). I am bound by the\njudgment of Supreme Court.\n\n90. \nIn case of \nVoestalpine Schienen GmbH vs. Delhi Metro\nRail Corporation Ltd.\n, (2017) 4 SCC 665, the Supreme Court has\nconsidered a different situation where the notice invoking arbitration\nagreement was issued after 23rd October, 2015 and the arbitral\nproceedings had commenced after Amendment Act came into force.\nThe appointment of the arbitrator was not in conformity with section\n12(1) of the Amendment Act Supreme Court interfered with such\nappointment by applying the provisions of the Amendment Act, 2015.\nThe Supreme Court distinguished the judgments delivered prior to the\n\n 52\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nsaid amendment to the facts of that case before the Supreme Court in\nview of the admitted fact that the notice invoking arbitration\nagreement was issued after 23rd October,2015.\n\n91. This judgment of the Supreme Court is adverted to by the\nSupreme Court in case of \nAravali Power Company Pvt. Ltd.\n (supra)\nand was distinguished on the ground that in that matter, the notice\nunder \nsection 21\n of the Arbitration Act was issued prior to 23rd\nOctober,2015. In my view the principles of law \nlaid down by\n the\nSupreme Court would apply to the facts of this case to a situation\nwhere the notice under \nsection 21\n is issued after 23 rd October, 2015\nthereby arbitral proceedings having commenced after 23rd\nOctober,2015. It is thus clear beyond reasonable doubt that if the\nnotice under \nsection 21\n to invoke arbitration agreement has been\nreceived prior to 23rd October, 2015, the arbitral proceedings had\ncommenced prior to 23rd October, 2015 and thus the provisions of the\nunamended \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n would continue to\napply to such proceedings before the arbitral tribunal as well as\nbefore Court and not the provisions of the Amendment Act.\n \nThis\nCourt in case of M/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) and in case\nof \nEnercon GmBH\n (supra) did not have benefit of the judgment of\nSupreme Court in case of \nVoestalpine Schienen GmbH\n (supra).\n\n92. This Court in case of \nMarwadi Shares & Finance Ltd. vs.\nMiral Kanaksinh Thakore & Anr.\n (2014) 1 Bom.C.R. 481 has\nconsidered the amendment in the bye-laws and the regulations of\nBombay Stock Exchange Limited which were amended during the\npendency of the arbitral proceedings before the arbitral tribunal and\nby virtue of such amendment, the power to condone the delay in filing\n\n 53\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthe arbitration petition before the appellate bench was taken away.\n\nThis Court after adverting to various judgments of the Supreme Court,\nincluding the judgment in case of \nGarikapati Veeraya vs. N. Subiah\nChoudhry\n, AIR 1957 SC 540 held that the rights and remedies\naccrued to the petitioner and subsequent rights and/or remedy in\nfiling the proceedings before the superior Court or the appellate forum\nwould continue and cannot be divested by the amendment unless it is\nshown clearly intended by the amendment to make it applicable with\nretrospective effect. It is held that the petitioner in that matter had\nfiled the proceedings before the learned arbitrator. The right of filing\nan appeal against the impugned award, if any, and a right to file an\napplication for condonation of delay on showing sufficient cause on\nthe date of filing of the original proceedings would be continued.\n\n93. It is held that the petitioner had vested right to impugn the\narbitral award rendered by the sole arbitrator along with an\napplication for condonation of delay in the event of delay by showing\nsufficient cause. The day on which the impugned award was\nrendered by the learned sole arbitrator, there was no amendment to\nbye-law 2 and the regulations of the Bombay Stock Exchange thereby\ntaking away the powers of the appellate bench to condone the delay.\nThis Court held that in such a situation \nsection 6(e)\n of the General\nClauses Act, 1897 would be attracted. This Court accordingly has set\naside the order passed by the appellate bench of the Bombay Stock\nExchange and directed that the appellate bench to hear the\napplication for condonation of delay.\n\n94. In this case also, it is not the case of any of the parties that\n\nsection 34(5)\n an 34(6) inserted by the Amendment Act would be\n\n 54\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\napplicable with retrospective effect. Even otherwise the intent of the\nlegislation while inserting these two provisions does not indicate that\nthe said provisions are brought into effect with retrospective effect. In\nmy view, when the arbitration proceedings commenced in view of the\nnotice issued by the petitioner under \nsection 21\n much prior to 23rd\nOctober, 2015 and since at that point of time, the petitioner was not\nrequired to issue any prior notice to the respondent before filing of the\narbitration petition under \nsection 34\n, merely because the award is\nrendered after 23rd October, 2015 and the petition is filed after the\nsaid amendment, the conditions imposed in \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n\ncannot be made applicable to such matters where the arbitral\nproceedings had commenced much prior to the date of the\namendment.\n\n95. In my view, the parties would be governed by the right and\nremedy available to the parties existing on the date of invoking the\narbitration agreement and not on the date of the award or on the date\nof filing of the arbitration petition unless the legislature so specifically\nprovided for a different remedy or the conditions introduced by\ninvoking such remedy in law with retrospective effect. In my view,\n\nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n thus cannot be pressed in the service by the\nrespondent to deprive the petitioner of filing a petition challenging an\naward in such matters without issuing any prior notice to the\nrespondent. In my view, the right of challenging the award under\n\nsection 34\n is a vested right to impugn the arbitral award which cannot\nbe taken away by such amendment under \nsection 34(5)\n. The\nprinciples \nlaid down by\n this Court in case of \nMarwadi Shares &\nFinance Limited\n (supra) applies to the facts of this case. In view of\n\nsection 6(e)\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the parties who had\n\n 55\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\ninvoked the arbitration agreement prior to 23rd October, 2015, would\nbe continued to be governed by the provisions applicable on the date\nof invocation of such arbitration agreement and not on the date when\nthe arbitral award is rendered or when the arbitration petition\nchallenging an arbiral award is filed.\n\n96. The Supreme Court in case of \nMilkfood Limited\n (supra)\nhas construed \nsection 21\n as well as \nsection 85(2)(a)\n of the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act, 1996 and also the provisions of \nsection 37(3)\n of\nthe Arbitration Act, 1940. It is held by the Supreme Court that the\nservice of notice and/or issuance of request for appointment of an\narbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement must be held to be\ndeterminative of commencement of the arbitral proceedings.\n \nThe\nSupreme Court adverted to the judgment in case of \nThyssen\nStahlunion GMBH\n (supra) and has held that the judgment \nin that\ncase\n itself is an authority for proposition that in relation to the\ndomestic arbitration proceedings, commencement thereof shall co-\nincide with the service of request / notice.\n\n97. It is held by the Supreme Court that the commencement of\nthe arbitration proceedings for the purpose of limitation or otherwise\nis of the Court's conscience. If a proceeding commences, the same\nbecomes relevant for many purposes including that of limitation. \nIn\nparagraph 70 of \nthe said judgment\n, it is held that those arbitral\nproceedings which were commenced before coming into force of the\n1996 Act are saved and the provisions of the 1996 Act would apply\nin relation to the arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after\nthe said Act came into force. Even for the said limited purpose, it is\nnecessary to find out as to what is meant by commencement of\n\n 56\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\narbital proceedings for the purpose of the 1996 Act wherefor also\nnecessity of reference to \nsection 21\n would arise.\n \nIn my view, the\nprinciples \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in case of \nMilkfood\nLimited\n (supra) would squarely apply to the facts of this case.\n\n98. The reference to \"arbitral proceedings\" in section 26 of the\nAmendment Act refers to such proceedings at two different stages i.e.\none before the Amendment Act came into effect and another after\nsuch amendment came into force i.e. after 23rd October, 2015. It is\nthus clear beyond reasonable doubt that the term \"arbitral\nproceedings\" referred in \nsection 26\n is one and the same proceedings\nwhich commences upon receipt of notice under \nsection 21\n by the\nother party and does not refer to two separate arbitral proceedings\ni.e. one before the arbitral tribunal and another before the Court of\nlaw. \nSection 21\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not\napply to proceedings in Court. Arbitration proceedings in Court does\nnot commence upon receipt of notice under \nsection 21\n of the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 by the other party. In my view, the\nintention of the legislature is very clear in this respect.\n\n99. The date of filing of the arbitration petition under \nsection 34\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 before 23 rd October, 2015\nor after such date is not relevant for the purpose of deciding whether\nthe parties will be governed by the provisions of the \nArbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996\n before insertion of the amendments by the\nAmendment Act or not.\n\n100. This Court even today deals with the matters under \nsection\n30\n of the Arbitration Act, 1940 in respect of which notice for\n\n 57\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nappointment of an arbitrator under \nsection 37(3)\n of the Arbitration Act,\n1940 was issued prior to the provisions of the \nArbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996\n came into effect. All such matters where the\narbitral proceedings commenced under the provisions of \nArbitration\nAct, 1940\n are continued to be governed by the provisions of the said\nAct though an arbitration petition challenging the award under \nsection\n30\n of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is filed after the \nArbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996\n came into force.\n\n101. The Supreme Court in case of \nAndhra Pradesh Power\nCoordination Committee & Ors. vs. Lanco Kondapalli Power\nLtd. & Ors.\n, (2016) 3 SCC 468 has held that the notice of arbitration\namounting to initiation of the arbitral proceedings as contemplated\nunder \nsection 21\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n102. This Court in case of \nBoard of Trustees of Jawaharlal\nNehru Port Trust vs. Three Circles Contractors\n, (2015) SCC\nOnLine Bom. 951 has held that as the arbitration proceedings\ncommences in respect of the disputes which are referred in the notice\ninvoking the arbitration agreement on the date on which such notice\nis received by the respondent, limitation in respect of such disputes\nstops.\n\n103. \nInsofar as the submission of the learned counsel for the\nrespondent that the judgment of this Court in case of\nM/s.Rendezvous \nSports World\n (supra) applies to the facts of this\ncase and is binding on this Court is concerned, even in \nthe said\njudgment\n, this Court has held that the Amendment Act does not\nrepeal \nsection 34\n. This Court in \nthe said judgment\n has categorically\n\n 58\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nheld that the vested right available to the award debtor would be only\nin the matter of challenge to the arbitration award which has remained\nintact and such right is unaffected by the amendment to \nsection 36\n of\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. In my view, Mr.Jain, learned\ncounsel for the petitioner is right in his submission that impediment\ncreated by \nsection 34(5)\n i.e. for issuance of prior notice before filing of\nthe arbitration application cannot affect the vested right prescribed\nunder \nsection 34(1)\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n104. In this case, the petitioner had already served a copy along\nwith a copy of the arbitration petition upon the respondent on 18 th\nApril, 2017 i.e. after filing of the arbitration petition. In my view,\nlearned counsel is right in his submission that the principles under\n\nsection 4\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 are applicable to\nthe present situation and issuance of such notice can also be waived\nby the respondent under \nsection 4\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996. The respondent in that matter has also filed a arbitration\npetition without issuing the notice under \nsection 34(5)\n to the\npetitioner.\n\n105. I shall now deal with the second issue arising in these\nmatters as to whether the compliance of the requirement of prior\nnotice contemplated under \nsection 34(5)\n before filing an arbitration\napplication under \nsection 34(1)\n is mandatory or directory.\n\n106. The Law Commission of India in its report dated 5 th\nAugust, 2014 had suggested various amendments to the \nArbitration\n& Conciliation Act, 1996\n. Insofar as Note on \nsection 34(5)\n in the said\nreport is concerned, it is mentioned that the said provision of \nsection\n\n 59\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n34(5) has been included to streamline the process and to cut short\nthe long delays which occurs due to issuance of the notice.\n\n107. Chapter XLIII-A of the Bombay High Court (Original Side)\nRules provides for the rules relating to the \nArbitration & Conciliation\nAct, 1996\n. It provides for the mode of application, contents of the\npetition and also provides for notice of filing an application to the\npersons likely to be affected. Rule 803-E provides that upon any\napplication under the Act, the Judge in Chambers shall, if he accepts\nthe petition, direct notice thereof to be given to all persons mentioned\nin the petition and to such other persons as may seen to him to be\nlikely to be affected by the proceedings, requiring all or any of such\npersons to show cause, within the time specified in the notice, why\nthe relief sought in the petition should not be granted. The said rules\nframed by this Court are statutory rules.\n\n108. Rule 803-B clearly provides that save as otherwise\nprovided in the said rules, all applications under the \nArbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996\n shall be made by the petitioner and shall be\nplaced on board for admission after prior notice to all parties\nconcerned. The Judge, may consider the admission of the Petition in\nexercise of his discretion even though no such notice is served on the\nother side. The Judge may admit or reject the Petition or pass such\nother orders thereon as he may deem fit. It is thus clear that all the\nrespondents are required to be served with a copy of notice before\nthe arbitration petitions are heard for admission. The recommendation\nof the Law Commission of India, in the said report that the purpose of\nintroducing section 34(5) is to streamline the process and to cut short\nthe long delays which accrued due to issuance of Court notice is\n\n 60\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\ntaken care of.\n\n109. It is the practice of this Court not to hear any arbitration\npetition unless a copy of notice and the papers and proceedings are\nfirst served upon the opponents. \nSection 34(5)\n does not contemplate\nthat after the prior notice is served, the petitioner is not required to\nserve the notice along with papers and proceedings upon the other\nparty before the matter is heard for admission.\n\n110. This Court in case of Ashraf Ahmed vs. The Municipal\nCorporation of Greater Bombay in First Appeal No.292 of 1999 has\nconstrued the requirement of notice under \nsection 527\n of the Mumbai\nMunicipal Corporation Act and the consequence of non-compliance\nthereof. It is held that all the object of the notice under section 527 of\nthe said Act is to give sufficient time to the Bombay Municipal\ncorporation and/or its authorities to consider the prayer for redressal\nof the plaintiff's grievances without resorting to any litigation. It is\nalways open to the Bombay Municipal Corporation and/or its\nconcerned authorities to waive the notice under \nsection 527\n of the Act\nor they may be estopped by conduct from pleading the want of notice.\nIt is held that where the Bombay Municipal Corporation fails to raise\na specific plea for want of notice at the earliest, by its conduct it may\nbe estopped from pleading the want of notice at a later stage.\n\n111. The Supreme Court in case of \nMacquire Bank Limited\nvs. Shilpi Cable Technologies Limited\n in Civil Appeal No.15135 of\n2017 after adverting to the earlier judgment in case of \nSurendra\nTrading Company vs. Juggilal Kamalapat Jute Mills Company\nLimited & Ors.\n in Civil Appeal No.8400 of 2017 held that the\n\n 61\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nprocedural provision cannot be stretched and considered as\nmandatory, when it causes serious general inconvenience.\n \nThe\nSupreme Court also adverted to the earlier judgment in case of\n\nMahanath Ram Das vs. Ganga Das\n, (1961) SCR 763 and held that\nsuch procedural orders, though peremptory are in essence in\nterrorem, so that dilatory litigants might put themselves in order and\navoid delay, they do not, however, completely estop a Court from\ntaking note of events and circumstances which happen within the\ntime fixed.\n\n112. This Court in case of \nCentral Bank of India vs. Femme\nPharma Limited & Ors.\n, AIR 1982 Bom. 67 has construed the\npowers of Court under Rule 227 of the High Court (Original Side)\nRules, 1980 and Rule 220(4) of the High Court (Original Side) Rules,\n1957 and has held that though the suit is placed on board for\ndismissal, under the old Rules of 1957, the discretion of the Court\nwas limited to sufficient cause being shown and if sufficient cause is\nnot shown, the suit has to be dismissed. However, under the Rules of\n1980, it only provides for a suit to be placed on board for dismissal\nbut is silent on what happens thereafter. The new Rules of 1980\nprovides a wider discretion than before and the Court is not bound to\ndismiss the suit.\n\n113. A perusal of \nsection 34(5)\n read with section 34(6) of the\nAmendment Act makes it clear that even if prior notice is not given to\nthe other party by the petitioner of filing an application under \nsection\n34\n challenging an award and even if such application filed under\n\nsection 34\n is not decided by the Court within one year from the date\nof service of the said notice under \nsection 34(5)\n, no consequence of\n\n 62\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nsuch default is provided therein. \nSection 34(5)\n also does not provide\nthe mode and manner of such service. Whether a copy of the\narbitration petition along with annexures proposed to be filed also is\nrequired to be served along with such notice or not is not\ncontemplated in the said provision.\n\n114. The said provision also is silent on the issue i.e. if there\nare office objections raised by the office of this Court and if the\npetitioner is required to make any changes in the petition in the\nformat or in the contents of the petition for the purposes of removal of\nsuch objections raised by the office, whether the petitioner is required\nto issue a fresh notice along with the papers with the corrections in\nthe petition or not. \nSection 34(6)\n provides that such petition has to be\ndisposed of within one year from the date on which the notice\nreferred to in sub \nsection 5\n of \nsection 34\n is served upon the other\nparty. If after giving the notice on the first day itself upon the receipt of\nthe signed copy of the award from the arbitral tribunal,if the petitioner\nissues such notice as referred to in sub \nsection 5\n of \nsection 34\n and\ndoes not file the petition for the next three months or even within 30\ndays after expiry of three months and if filed within the time\nprescribed under \nsection 34(3)\n, the petition remains in the office\nobjections for another six months, an application filed under \nsection\n34(1)\n obviously cannot be disposed of within a period of one year\nfrom the date on which a notice referred to in sub \nsection 5\n of \nsection\n34\n is served upon the other party.\n\n115. No consequence is provided in \nsection 34(6)\n also if the\narbitration petition is not disposed of by the Court within one year\nfrom the date of service of notice under \nsection 34(5)\n of the\n\n 63\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nAmendment Act. For this reason also, I am of the view that the\nprovisions of \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n cannot be construed as\nmandatory but has to be construed as directory. In my view, the\nrequirement of the notice under section 34(5) of the Amendment\nAct is procedural in nature and not a substantive provision. The\ncompliance of such procedural provision without providing any\nconsequences in case of defiance thereof thus cannot be construed\nas mandatory and has to be construed as directory. Even if a notice\nis not given prior to the date of filing of the petition, the right of\nchallenging an award vested in \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 cannot be taken away.\n\n116. No substantive right is created on the other party even if\nsuch prior notice is not issued by the petitioner of filing the arbitration\npetition as contemplated under section 34(5) of the Amendment Act.\nIf the arguments of the respondent is accepted, the Court has to\ndismiss such arbitration petitions which are filed without issuing prior\nnotice under section 34(5) of the Amendment Act. The consequence\nof the petitioner not issuing such prior notice before filing of the\narbitration petition would be serious and would amount to taking away\nthe vested and substantive right available to the petitioner to impugn\nthe arbitral award within the time prescribed under the Act. The\nprocedure prescribed under \nsection 34(5)\n, can in my view be\ncomplied with even after the arbitration petition is filed by the\npetitioner under the said provisions or in accordance with the\nprovisions of the High Court (Original Side) Rules.\n\n117. The Supreme Court in case of Thirumalai Chemicals\nLimited vs. Union of India & Ors. (2001) 6 SCC 739 has held that\n\n 64\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthe procedural law established a mechanism for determining those\nrights and liabilities and a machinery for enforcing them, the same\ncannot be called a substantive right and an aggrieved person cannot\nclaim any vested right. It is held that unless the language used plainly\nmanifests in express terms or by necessary implication a contrary\nintention, a statute divesting vested rights is to be construed as\nprospective. A statue merely procedural is to be construed as\nretrospective and a statue which while procedural in its character,\naffects vested rights adversely, is to be construed as prospective.\n\n118. In my view, Mr.Mehta, learned senior counsel and Mr.Jain,\nlearned counsel have rightly contended that issuance of such notice\nunder \nsection 34(5)\n is a requirement however, not mandatory. The\ndiscretionary power is given to the Courts to look into the facts in\neach case and decide if the same has to be made mandatory or not.\nIf the provision of \nsection 34(5)\n is construed as mandatory, it would\ntake away the discretionary powers from the Court. Any strict\ninterpretation of such procedural provision will cause inconvenience\nto the parties and would result in lengthening the procedure and\ndefeating the entire purpose of the Act itself. High Court (Original\nSide) Rules already provides sufficient protection to the other party\nfor issuance of a notice before the matter is heard by the Court with a\nview to obviate any delay in the matter.\n\n119. The Supreme Court in case of M/s.Babbar \nSewing\nMachine Company vs. Trilok Nath Mahajan\n, (1978) 4 SCC 188 has\nheld that the order for dismissal ought not be made under Order XI\nRule 21, unless the Court is satisfied that the plaintiff wilfully withheld\ninformation or documents and the defence be struck out in case of\n\n 65\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthe defendant and placed in the same position as if he had not\ndefended the suit. It is held that under the said provision, it is only\nwhen the default is wilful and only as a last resort that the Court\nshould dismiss the suit or strike out the defence by exercising such\npower.\n\n120. The Supreme Court in case of \nState of Goa vs. Western\nBuilders\n, (2006) 6 SCC 239 has held that by virtue of \nsection 43\n of\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, \nLimitation Act, 1963\n applies\nto the proceedings under the Act of 1996 and the provisions of the\n\nLimitation Act\n can only stand excluded to the extent wherever\ndifferent period has been prescribed under the Act of 1996. It is held\nthat since there is no prohibition provided under \nsection 34\n, there is\nno reason why \nsection 14\n of the Limitation Act should not be read in\nthe Act of 1996, which will advance the cause of justice. It is held that\nif the statute is silent and there is no specific prohibition then the\nstatue should be interpreted which advances the cause of justice.\n\n121. In my view since there is no consequence provided in\n\nsection 34(5)\n as well as \nsection 34(6)\n for non-compliance of the\nrequirement mentioned therein, the Court has to balance the situation\nand exercise its discretionary power to permit the petitioner to issue\nnotice along with papers and proceedings upon the other party even\nafter the petition is filed to avoid any delay in disposal of such\napplication. In my view \nsection 34(5)\n cannot be equated with \nsection\n80\n of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. In view of the fact that now\nby virtue of the amendment to \nsection 36\n, merely upon filing of the\narbitration application for challenging an award under \nsection 34\n,\nthere is no automatic stay, the petitioner who challenges the arbitral\n\n 66\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\naward by filing an application under \nsection 34\n would not wait and\nwould not cause any delay by not issuing notice upon the other party\nto obviate any situation of execution of award under the provisions \nof\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908. For this reason also, I am of the\nview that the requirement under \nsection 34(5)\n has to be construed as\ndirectory and nor mandatory.\n\n122. The Division Bench of this Court in case of Bankay Bihari\nG. Agrawal & Ors. vs. M/s.Bhagwanji Meghji & Ors., (2001) 1\nMh.L.J. 345 while construing the order 37 \nRule 2 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure\n, 1908 has held that merely because the defendant fails to\nappear or file his Vakalatnama or fails to obtain leave to defend the\nsuit, the suit cannot be decreed if the Judge is satisfied that there is\nno cause of action at all disclosed in the plaint. It is this wide\ndiscretion of the Court which has been expressly recognized in Rule\n\n221. It it held that notwithstanding the somewhat peremptory\nphraseology used in Order 37, Rule 2(2), suggesting that no such\ndiscretion is vested in the Court, there is always vested in the Court\nthe judicial discretion to permit a plaintiff to take advantage of the\nsummary procedure or to relegate him to the normal remedy of a\nregular suit. It is held that mere failure of the plaintiff to take out a\nSummons for Judgment within six months after the filing of the plaint\nwould not justify granting of unconditional leave to defend the suit.\n\n123. The Supreme Court in case of \nVidyawati Gupta & Ors.\n\n(supra) has construed the provisions of \nsection 26(2)\n and Order 4\nRule 1, Order 6 Rule 15(4) and Order 7 Rule 1 to 8 as amended from\n1st July, 2002 and has held that those provisions are procedural and\ndirectory and thus non-compliance thereof did not automatically\n\n 67\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nrender the plaint non-est and was curable. The principles \nlaid down\nby\n the Supreme Court in \nthe said judgment\n would apply to the facts of\nthis case.\n\n124. The Supreme Court in case of \nTopline Shoes Limited\n\n(supra) construed the provisions of \nsection 13(2)(a)\n of the Consumer\nProtection Act, 1986 by which time limit was prescribed for filing of\nversion of the opposite party and has held that the said provision is\ndirectory and not mandatory. The Supreme Court in \nthe said\njudgment\n held that the intention to provide a time frame to file reply, is\nreally meant to expedite the hearing of such matters and to avoid\nunnecessary adjournments to linger on the proceedings on the\npretext of filing reply. The provision, however, as framed, does not\nindicate that it is mandatory in nature. In case the extended time\nexceeds 15 days, no penal consequences are prescribed therefor.\nThe period of extension of time \"not exceeding 15 days\", does not\nprescribe any kind of period of limitation. The Supreme Court\naccordingly held that the provision appears to be directory in nature.\nIt is held that the provision is more by way of procedure to achieve\nthe object of speedy disposal of such disputes. But it falls short of\ncreating any kind of substantive right in favour of the complainant by\nreason of which the respondent may be debarred from placing his\nversion in defence in any circumstances whatsoever.\n\n125. In \nsection 34(5)\n also, no consequence is provided in the\nevent of the petitioner not issuing any prior notice before filing of the\narbitration petition under \nsection 34\n to the respondent. Similarly, there\nis also no consequence provided in \nsection 34(6)\n, if the Court is not\nable to dispose of the arbitration petition under \nsection 34\n within one\n\n 68\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nyear from the date of service of notice contemplated under \nsection\n34(5)\n upon other party. The purpose and the legislative intent of\ninserting those provisions is the speeder disposal of the proceedings\nand not to penalise the petitioner for non-compliance of the procedure\nwhich is directory. Powers of the Court under \nsection 34(5)\n are not\ncircumscribed by powers under \nsection 34(2)\n.\n\n126. The Madras High Court in case of M/s.Jumbo \nBags\nLimited\n (supra) has construed the provisions of \nsection 11\n(6-A)\nwhich is also inserted by the Amendment Act and after considering\nthe fact that the notice invoking arbitration agreement was issued\nprior to 23rd October, 2015 and after adverting to the judgment of the\nSupreme in case of \nMilkfood Limited\n (supra) held that the amended\nprovisions under \nsection 11\n(6-A) would not come into play \nin that\ncase\n. In my view, the principles \nlaid down by\n the Madras High Court\nwould clearly apply to the facts of this case. I am in complete\nagreement with the views expressed by the Madras High Court in \nthe\nsaid judgment\n.\n\n127. The Kerala High Court in case of \nShamsudeen\n (supra)\nhas considered the provisions of \nsection 34(5)\n inserted by the\nAmendment Act and has considered the fact that the notice invoking\narbitration agreement was issued much prior to 23rd October, 2015\nand accordingly held that section 34(5) of the Amendment Act has no\napplication to the facts of that case and thus the petitioner was not\nrequired to comply with the provisions of \nsection 34(5)\n. The facts\nbefore the Kerala High Court are identical to the facts of this case.\nThe principles \nlaid down by\n the Kerala High Court in \nthe said\njudgment\n would squarely apply to the facts of this case. I am in\n\n 69\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\ncomplete agreement with the views expressed by the Kerala High\nCourt in \nthe said judgment\n.\n\n128. The judgments of the Supreme Court in case of\nM/s.Raptakos \nBrett & Co. Ltd. vs. Ganesh Property\n (supra), in\ncase of \nState of Maharashtra vs. Hindustan Construction\nCompany\n (supra), in case of \nRoshanlal Kuthalia & Ors. vs. R.B.\nMohan Singh Oberoi\n (supra) and in case of \nSnehadeep Structures\nPrivate Limited vs. Maharashtra Small - Scale Industries\nDevelopment Corporation Limited\n (supra) also would assist the\ncase of the petitioner.\n\n129. The Supreme Court in case of \nThirumalai Chemicals\nLimited\n (supra) has held that the right of appeal conferred under\n\nsection 19(1)\n of the FEMA is a substantive right. Unless the\nlanguage used plainly manifests in express terms or by necessary\nimplication a contrary intention, a statute divesting vested rights is to\nbe construed as prospective and a statue which is procedural in its\ncharacter and affects vested rights adversely is to be construed as\nprospective. The principles of law \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in\n\nthe said judgment\n are applicable to the facts of this case.\n\n130. \nInsofar as the judgment delivered by the Division Bench of\nthe Patna High Court in case of \nThe Bihar Rajya Bhumi Vikas Bank\nSamiti, Bihar - Jharkhand\n (supra) relied upon by the learned\ncounsel for the respondent is concerned, a perusal of \nthe said\njudgment\n clearly indicates that the Patna High Court in \nthe said\njudgment\n has not dealt with the judgments of the Supreme Court\nholding that if the notice under \nsection 21\n is received by other party\n\n 70\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nprior to 23rd October, 2015, the provisions of the unamended\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n would be applicable to the parties,\nwhereas if such notice is received after 23rd October, 2015, the\nparties will be governed by the provisions of Amendment Act. The\nPatna High Court has also not considered the issue that there is no\nconsequence provided in section 34(5) and 34(6) of the Amendment\nAct in the event of non-compliance of the said provisions. The\nBombay High Court (Original Side) Rules specifically provides for\nissuance of notice by the petitioner upon the other party before the\nmatter is heard by the Court. The judgment of the Patna High Court is\nthus clearly distinguishable and would not assist the case of the\nrespondent.\n\n131. The Supreme Court in case of \nAnanthesh Bhakta & Ors.\nvs. Nayana S. Bhakta\n, (2017) 5 SCC 185 has construed \nsection 8(2)\n\nproviding that the Judicial authorities shall not entertain the\napplication or referring the disputes to arbitration unless the said\napplication is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or\nduly certified copy thereof and held that \nsection 8(2)\n has to be\ninterpreted to mean that the court shall not consider any application\nfiled by the party under \nsection 8(1)\n unless it is accompanied by the\noriginal arbitration agreement or duly certified copy thereof. The filing\nof the application without such original or certified copy, but bringing\noriginal arbitration agreement on record at the time when the court is\nconsidering the application shall not entail rejection of the application\nunder \nsection 8(2)\n. The Supreme Court refused to accept the\ncontention that the said application filed under \nsection 8(1)\n was not\nmaintainable since the same was not accompanied by the original\narbitration agreement or certified copy thereof.\n\n 71\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n132. It is thus clear that though the words used in \nsection 8(2)\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 that the Judicial authorities\nshall not entertain the application which is without accompanying the\nrequisite documents, the Supreme Court has not dismissed such\napplication and has held that such documents can be filed and\nconsidered even at the stage of considering the application. In my\nview, this judgment would also support the case of the petitioner that\n\nsections 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n are directory and not mandatory. The\nprinciples \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in \nthe said judgment\n\nwould apply to the facts of this case. I am respectfully bound by \nthe\nsaid judgment\n.\n\n133. Insofar as the submission of the learned counsel for the\nrespondent that if \nsection 34(5)\n is considered as directory, the entire\npurpose of the amendments would be rendered otiose is concerned,\nin my view, there is no merit in this submission made by the learned\ncounsel for the respondent. Since there is no consequence provided\nin the said provision in case of non-compliance thereof, the said\nprovision cannot be considered as mandatory. The purpose of\navoiding any delay in proceeding with the matter expeditiously is\nalready served by insertion of appropriate rule in Bombay High Court\n(Original Side) Rules. The Court can always direct the petitioner to\nissue notice along with papers and proceedings upon other party\nbefore the matter is heard by the Court for admission as well as for\nfinal hearing. The vested rights of a party to challenge an award\nunder \nsection 34\n cannot be taken away for non-compliance of\nissuance of prior notice before filing of the arbitration petition.\n\n 72\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n134. \nInsofar as the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of\n\nUnion of India vs. Popular Construction Company Limited\n\n(supra) relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent is\nconcerned, the Supreme Court in \nthe said judgment\n has construed\n\nsections 5\n and \n29(2)\n of the Limitation Ac, 1963, and also \nsection 34\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. It is held by the Supreme\nCourt that in view of \nsection 29(2)\n of the Limitation Act, 1963, the\nperiod prescribed for limitation under \nsection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act, 1996 would apply. The expression \"but not\nthereafter\" described in \nsection 34(3)\n is interpreted by the Supreme\nCourt and it is held that the \nArbitration Act\n being a self-contained\nCode, the Court has no power to condone delay beyond the period of\n30 days and that also provided sufficient cause is shown.\n \nThe\njudgment of the Supreme Court in case of \nUnion of India\n (supra) is\nclearly distinguishable and would not assist the the case of the\nrespondent.\n\n135. \nInsofar as the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of\nM/s.Raptakos \nBrett & Co. Ltd.\n (supra) is concerned, the Supreme\nCourt in \nthe said judgment\n has construed \nsection 69(2)\n of the\nPartnership Act, 1932 and has held that the said provision with regard\nto an unregistered firm is a penal provision and has to be strictly\nconstrued. In my view since under section 34(5) of the Amendment\nAct, no consequence is provided, the said provision cannot be\nconsidered as a penal provision and cannot be construed strictly.\n\nSection 34(5)\n and the \nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n cannot be\nequated with \nsection 69(2)\n of the Partnership Act.\n \nThe judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in case of M/s.Raptakos \nBrett & Co. Ltd.\n (supra)\nthus would not assist the case of the respondent. The judgment of\n\n 73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nthis Court in First Appeal No.302 of 2013 and reported in 76\nCompany Cases, 244 (Bom.) also would not assist the case of the\nrespondent.\n\n136. Insofar as the submission of the learned counsel for the\nrespondent that the effect of \nsection 34(5)\n is clearly to impose a bar\nagainst the institution of an application under \nsection 34(1)\n and thus\nthe same should be construed as mandatory and not directory is\nconcerned, on plain reading of \nsection 34(5)\n, it is clear that there is\nno clear bar provided under the said provision for not accepting the\narbitration petition filed under \nsection 34\n on record unless a notice to\nother party is issued by the petitioner before filing of such petition. I\nam not inclined to accept the submission of the learned counsel for\nthe respondent that the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of\nM/s.Raptakos \nBrett & Co. Ltd.\n (supra) would assist the case of the\nrespondent and not the case of the petitioner. If \nsection 34(5)\n is\nconsidered as mandatory and if a petition filed before issuance of\nsuch notice is dismissed on the ground of non-compliance, whether\nperiod taken in pursuing such petition has to be excluded under\n\nsection 14\n of the Limitation Act, 1963 would also be a relevant factor.\n\n137. Insofar as the other judgments referred to and relied upon\nby the learned counsel for the petitioner referred to aforesaid, which\nare sought to be distinguished by the learned counsel for the\nrespondent is concerned, in my view, learned counsel for the\nrespondent could not distinguish any of those judgments. This Court\nhas already dealt with those judgments in great detail in the earlier\nparagraphs of this judgment and are found clearly applicable to the\nfacts of this case and assist the case of the petitioner.\n\n 74\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\n138. The conclusion drawn by this Court in this judgment is\nsummarized as under :-\n\na). If notice invoking arbitration agreement is received by\nother party prior to 23rd October, 2015, the arbitration proceedings\nwould commence prior to 23rd October, 2015. The provisions of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n in force prior to 23 rd October,\n2015 would be applicable to such matters for all the purposes.\n\nb). If notice invoking arbitration clause is received by other\nparty after 23rd October, 2015,the parties will be governed by the\nprovisions of the \nArbitration & Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n for\nall the purposes.\n\nc). The date of filing of the arbitration petition under \nsection\n34(1)\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 is not relevant for the\npurpose of deciding the applicability of the provisions of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n i.e. pre-amendment or post\namendment.\n\nd). The expression \"arbitral proceedings\" described in \nsection\n26\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 refers to\ntwo different periods i.e. (i) before 23rd October, 2015 and (ii) after\n23rd October, 2015. The expression \"in relation to the arbitral\nproceedings\" provided in \nsection 26\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\n(Amendment) Act, 2015 does not refer to the arbitral proceedings in\nCourt. The expression \"in relation to the arbitral proceedings\"\n\nprescribed in \nsection 26\n has to be read with \nsection 21\n of the\n\n 75\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/02/2018 ::: Downloaded on - 22/02/2018 02:11:26 :::\n\n carbp434-17\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n.\n\ne). Even in those cases where the notice invoking arbitration\nagreement under \nsection 21\n is received by other party after 23rd\nOctober, 2015, the provisions under \nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n are\ndirectory and not mandatory. The Court has ample power to direct the\npetitioner to issue notice along with papers and proceedings upon the\nrespondent after the petitioner files the arbitration application under\n\nsection 34(1)\n and before such petition is heard by the Court at the\nstage of admission.\n\nf). The questions framed in the earlier part of the judgment\nare answered accordingly. The office is directed to place all the\narbitration petitions in which an issue as to whether the provisions of\n\nsection 34(5)\n and \n34(6)\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation (Amendment)\nAct, 2015 are mandatory or directory on board for admission on 28 th\nFebruary, 2018.\n\n (R.D.
