No.310/2018\n\nIndore; dated 14.03.2018\nShri Sachin Sabnis, learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\nThe petitioner has filed the present petition\nbeing aggrieved by order dated 23.11.2017 by which\nlearned trial Court has rejected the application filed under\n\nOrder 22 Rule 9 of C.P.C\n.. The plaintiffs have filed the suit\nfor permanent injunction and removal of illegal\nconstruction raised by the defendant / plaintiff .\n\nAfter receipt of summon, the defendant filed\nwritten statement contending that he has not raised any\nillegal construction but he purchased the constructed house\nand there is no illegal construction. On the basis of\npleadings the learned trial court has framed the issues. The\nissue No.1 and 2 are in respect of the illegal construction\nraised by the defendant. The defendant has already filed an\naffidavit under\nOrder 18 Rule 4 of the C.P.C\n. and the case\nis fixed for cross examination his witnesses. At this stage\nthe defendant has filed an application under\nOrder 26 Rule\n9 of C.P.C\n. The learned trial has rejected the aforesaid\napplication by observing that the provision of under\nOrder\n26 Rule 9 of C.P.C\n. cannot use for collection of evidence.\nThe\nOrder 26 Rule 9 of C.P.C\n. provides that :- \"In any suit in\nwhich the Court deems a local investigation to be requisite\nor proper for the purpose of elucidating any matter in\ndispute, or of ascertaining the market value, may issue a\ncommission. The language of Order 26 Rule 9 is very plain\nand simple, according to which, if any court deems it\nproper to appoint a commission for the purpose of\nclarification of any issue in dispute, may appoint a\ncommission. That any clarification requires only after the\nevidences are produced by both the parties. The parties in\nsuit must prove their case by way of evidence and if the\ncourt wants that any issue or matter in dispute requires any\nclarification or elucidation it may appoint a commission. In\nthe present case the plaintiff as well as defendants have not\ngiven their evidences so far. They have to stand on their\nlags as they have to prove their case by way of evidence\nand if thereafter any issue is required to be clarified then\nthey may file an application or court suo moto may appoint\na commission\". The important is that at which stage\napplication under\nOrder 26 Rule 9 of C.P.C\n. is filed in the\nsuit.\n\nIn view of the above, the application filed by the\nrespondent is premature and petition is disposed of with liberty\nto the petitioner to revive his application after cross\nexamination of his witnesses. The learned trial Court has rightly\ndismissed the application at this stage.\n\nAccordingly, petition is disposed of with above\nliberty.\n\nCertified copy as per rules.\n\n(Vivek Rusia)\nJudge\nPraveen\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nW.P.

No.260/2016\n\n(\nVinod Kumar Nakda Vs. State of M.P. and others\n)\nIndore; dated 12.03.2018\nMs. Rekha Shrivastava, learned counsel for the\npetitioner.\n\nMs. Bharti Lakkad, learned counsel for the\nrespondents/ State.\n\nThe petitioner has filed the present petition being\naggrieved by order dated 04.11.2015 by which services of\nthe petitioner has been terminated. The petitioner was\nappointed as Pharmacist on contract basis vide order dated\n05.09.2013. The period of contract of the petitioner was\nextended time to time. That, alongwith the petitioner other\ncandidates were also appointed as Pharmacist. After the\nappointment the CMO, Mandsour (M.P.) has considered\nthe eligibility of the petitioner and found that the\nappointment of the petitioner was against the rules and he\nwas not eligible for the post of Pharmacist and his\nappointment is forged also.\n\nThe similar case came up for hearing before this\nCourt in W.P. Nos. 749/2016, 1479/2016 & 1500/2016. By\norder dated 07.02.2018 all the writ petitions have been\ndismissed. The operative part of order is reproduced\nbelow:-\n\n\" The original record reflects that advertisement\nwas issued for appointment on the post of Pharmacist\nand after scrutiny of the applications, initially the merit\nlist dated 7/3/13 was prepared. Thereafter a complaint\nwas received alleging irregularities in preparing the\nmerit list. Hence the selection process was stayed and\nappointment orders dated 20/3/13 were kept in\nabeyance. After the enquiry and considering the\nobjections, the fresh select list was prepared and\nforwarded by the Incharge Officer to CMHO Mandsaur\non 3/5/13. The said select list was displayed in the\nnotice board of CMHO Mandsaur on 3/5/13 and\nobjections were invited. The petitioner in WP No.\n749/16 had submitted the objection which was\nrejected.\n\nThe appointment of petitioner in WP No. 749/16\nwas under OBC category and order of appointment of\npetitioner dated 31/8/2013 states that petitioner was\nappointed in pursuance to the revised merit list dated\n3/5/13 but a perusal of the revised merit list dated\n3/5/13 reveals that under the OBC male category, the\nlast selected candidate had obtained 63.55% marks and\nlast candidate in the waiting list had obtained 53.28%\nmarks, whereas the chart containing the details of\nmarks obtained by all candidates namely \"all forms of\npharmacist\" reveals that petitioner's name figures in\nthat chart at Sr.No. 595 and he had obtained only\n36.12% marks. Since petitioner had obtained less than\nthe cut-off marks in the main merit list and waiting list\nof OBC male candidate, therefore, he was not entitled\nfor appointment on the post of Pharmacist.\n\nSo far as the petitioner in WP No. 1479/16 is\nconcerned, he belongs to General Category and he was\nissued the notice dated 9/10/15 for cancellation of his\nappointment on the ground that neither his name\nfigures in the select list nor he had submitted any\napplication for appointment.\n\nIt has been pointed out by learned counsel for\nrespondents that the name of petitioner does not figure\nin the table of all forms of pharmacist which contains\nthe details and marks of all applicants who had made\nthe application for appointment nor does his name\nfigure in the merit list or waiting list of selected\ncandidates which means that the petitioner was\nappointed even without applying for the post.\n\nIn WP No. 1500/16 the petitioner was a candidate\nunder Female General Category and she had obtained\n36.15% marks whereas the cut-off marks in the merit list\nof the Female General Category was 55.13% and the\ncut-off marks in the waiting list of Female General\nCategory was 39.27%. Since the petitioner had obtained\nless than the marks of last candidate of waiting list\nunreserved women candidate, therefore, she could not\nhave been appointed.\n\nThe record further reflects that petitioners were\nissued the show cause notice and after giving an\nopportunity of hearing the impugned orders have been\npassed terminating their services on the ground that\nthey had obtained less than the cutoff marks of the final\nselect list and waiting list or had not even submitted the\napplication for appointment.

The applicant is apprehending his\narrest in connection with Crime No. 1228/2016 registered\nunder\nSections 420\n,\n,\nand\nof the IPC at Police\nStation Chimanganj Mandi District Ujjain.\n\nNo other bail application is filed, pending or decided by\nany other court, by this Court or before the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt. The applicant has filed an affidavit in support of the\napplication.\n\nBail application filed by the applicant before Additional\nSessions Judge, Ujjain has been dismissed by the Additional\nSessions Judge, Ujjain vide order dated 08/11/2016 passed in\nB.A. No. 1082/2016.\n\nLearned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant\nwas the owner of the disputed land and it was not the Govt.\nland. He sold the land through will of Kanchan Bai, who\nexpired on 20/10/1995 and he executed the sale deed on\n27/11/2015. False report has been filed against applicant\nalleging that he has sold the Govt. land. He is innocent and\nfalsely implicated in this case, his detention is required for the\ninvestigation . Therefore, he be granted anticipatory bail.\n\nShri Jitendra Verma learned counsel for the\ncomplainant/objector with Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Deputy\nGovt. Advocate appearing on behalf of the States objected the\nbail application stating that applicant sold him a Govt. land by\nfraud and he took away his registered sale deed stating that he\nwill get mutated the land on his name and that registered sale\ndeed has yet to be recovered from the applicant. They have\nprayed for the rejection of the bail application.\n\nAccording to the facts the objector has filed a complaint\nagainst applicant alleging that he sold a piece of land to him\nstating that he is owner of the land and Kanchan Bail sold him\nthis land through a will after getting saledeed executed. When\nobjector applied for mutation and also tried to fence the land\nthen his neighbours inform him that this is a Govt. land. He\ncontacted the Patwari, who also confirm the information and\nrevealed that this is a Govt. land and has earmarked as\nresidential colony of Govt. hospital.\n\nApplicant also took away the registered saledeed from\nthe complainant stating that he will get the land mutated in his\nname and has not returned the same. Alleging that applicant\nhas obtained Rs.15 lacs from him by fraud. Objector has filed a\nFIR, which was registered as stated above.\n\nConsidering the aforesaid and other facts and\ncircumstances of the case so also the facts that matter is under\ninvestigation. I do not think it is fit case for grant of\nanticipatory bail at this stage. Accordingly, this petition is\nhereby dismissed.\n\n(VIRENDER SINGH)\nJUDGE\nskt\nMisc.

Sharmila Sharma, learned counsel for the\nappellants.\n\nShri Sanjay Karanjawala, learned Panel Lawyer for\nrespondent/State.\n\nHeard on IA No. 9760/2016, an application under\n\nSection 389(1)\nof the Cr.P.C. for suspension of jail sentence\nand grant of bail.\n\nAt the very outset learned counsel for the appellants\nseeks permission of this Court to withdraw this application in\nrespect of appellant No.2 Rem Singh.\n\nPrayer is allowed.\n\nAccordingly, this application is dismissed as withdrawn\nin respect of appellant No.2 Rem Singh.\n\nAppellant No.1 Bala alongwith other co-accused Rem\nSingh and Babu were convicted for the offence punishable\nunder\nSection 302\n/\nof the IPC and sentenced to life\nimprisonment and fine of Rs.5,000/- each with default\nstipulation.\n\nLearned counsel for the appellants submits that statement\nof the prosecution witnesses Dhan Singh(PW/1), Panu\nBai(PW/4) and Ramesh (PW/6) are unreliable as there is\nmaterial contradictions and omissions in their statement\nrecorded under\nSection 161\nof the Cr.P.C. She further submits\nthat Dhan Singh(PW/1) in his statement submits that he has\nreached at the spot when he heard the cries of wife of the\ndeceased i.e. Panu Bai(PW/4), however, in her statement she\nstated that she heard the noise of deceased Jhanjhad. Similarly\nRamesh (PW/6) in his statement has stated that he heard the\ncries of Panu Bai (PW/4) but in his statement recorded under\n\nSection 161\nof the Cr.P.C. he said that he heard the cries of\nDhan Singh(PW/1).\n\nLearned Panel Lawyer for the State opposes the prayer.\nAfter going through the statement of these three\nprosecution witnesses, who are recorded as eye witness, we\nfind there is no material contradiction in their statement and\nstatement recorded under\nSection 161\nof the Cr.P.C. Their\npresence at the spot is natural as they lived near the spot, where\nthe crime was committed. Present appellant and other co-\naccused were known to him and the night was of full moon so\nthere is also a source of light and therefore, their statement\ncannot be disbelieved on the ground of such minor\ncontradictions and their evidence is corroborated by the\nmedical evidence also.\n\nConsidering the aforesaid we are of the view that no\ncase is made out for suspension of jail sentence. IA No.\n9760/2016 devoid of any force and liable to be dismissed and\ndismissed accordingly.\n\n(P.K. JAISWAL) (ALOK VERMA)\nJUDGE JUDGE\nskt\n\nCONC No.142/2016\n\n06/12/2016\n\nShri S.M.
