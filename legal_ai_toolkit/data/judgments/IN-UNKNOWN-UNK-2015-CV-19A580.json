Hence, they are heard together and are\ndecided by this common order.\n\nThe petitioner is the Krishna District Milk Producers\nMutually Aided Cooperative Union, Vijayawada (henceforth referred\nto as the employer). There is no dispute that the\nrespondent/employee concerned in each of these cases has\nrendered service to the petitioner/employer and retired from its\nservice on attaining the age of superannuation. It is also not in\ndispute that the petitioner/employer has settled and paid the\namount of gratuity payable to them as expeditiously as possible\nafter his retirement. However, each of these employees having\nthus accepted the payment of gratuity, has approached the\n2nd respondent-Controlling Authority under the\nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n(henceforth referred to as Controlling Authority),\nmaking a further claim for payment of differential amount of\ngratuity running to few thousand rupees more than what has been\nreceived by them, on the basis that the service rendered by each\none of them prior to the regularization of their services by the\nemployer is not taken into account and consideration for purpose\nof computation of gratuity. It is the claim of the respective\nemployees that if the length of service rendered by them prior to\nthe date of regularization of their services was taken into account\nand consideration, the quantum of gratuity payable would be\nmuch higher, by few thousand rupees than what has already been\nsettled and paid by the employer. Hence, they made the claim.\nThey also filed miscellaneous petitions in each of the claims\nseeking condonation of delay ranging from 63 to 1095 days as\nnoticed supra. Though the petitioner/employer has contested the\nmatter, the 2nd respondent-Controlling Authority by his common\norder dated 23.02.2015 allowed all the miscellaneous petition\nNos.1 of 2013 to 98 of 2013, condoning the delay in filing the claim\npetitions and accordingly ordered the claim petitions to be\nnumbered as payment of gratuity case Nos.1 to 98 of 2015.\nChallenging the correctness of the orders dated 23.02.2015, the\npresent batch of writ petitions have been instituted by the\npetitioner/employer.\n\nHeard Sri N. Rajeswara Rao, learned counsel for the\npetitioner/employer, and the learned Assistant Government\nPleader, Sri Durga Prasad, who has accepted notice on behalf of\nthe 1st respondent-State.\n\nSri N.Rajeswara Rao had contended that all the employees\nhave accepted the gratuity settled and paid by the\npetitioner/employer without any demur or protest and having\nthus, accepted the payment of gratuity in full and final settlement\nthereof are estopped now from making any further claim. This\napart, the claim of the respective employees lacks any tenability.\nFurther, no justifiable reason or ground has been urged seeking\ncondonation of huge amounts of delay in lodging the claim\npetitions and hence, no such claim/delay condonation petition\nought to have entertained by the 2nd respondent-Controlling\nAuthority. In spite of pointing out lack of tenability behind the\nclaim as well as the petition for condonation of delay, the 2nd\nrespondent-Controlling Authority has gone about mechanically in\ncondoning the delay. For purpose of condoning the delay, the 2nd\nrespondent-Controlling Authority has considered that claim for\npayment of gratuity is a continuous claim and hence, there is no\ndelay in lodging a claim at all. Sri N.Rajeswara Rao would submit\nthat this is a completely erroneous view of the matter. He would\nfurther submit that in spite of bringing to the notice of the 2nd\nrespondent-Controlling Authority the judgment rendered by a\nDivision Bench of Calcutta High Court, the judgment of the\nBombay High Court and that of the Jharkhand High Court in\nsupport of the point that the delay cannot be condoned beyond the\nlimit prescribed under the statue in as much as the\nPayment of\nGratuity Act\nis a complete code by itself and hence, the provisions\nof\nSection 5\nof the Limitation Act cannot be invoked for condoning\nhuge delay, the delay was condoned mechanically. Sri\nN.Rajeswara Rao would further submit that for condonation of\ndelay there must be justifiable reason or ground, the same cannot\nbe claimed as a matter of right nor can the delay be condoned in a\nroutine manner.\n\nThe Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n(henceforth referred to as\nthe Act) as a social security and welfare measure, has been\nproviding for a scheme for payment of gratuity to the employees\nengaged in factories, mines, oil fields, plantations, ports, railway\ncompanies, shops or other establishments. Sub\nSection 3\nof\n\nSection 1\nof the Act made it clear that it shall apply to every\nfactory, mine, oil field, plantation, port and Railway Company. In\nso far as shops and other establishments are concerned, wherever\nthere are 10 or more number of persons employed, or were\nemployed, on any day of the preceding twelve months, the Act gets\nattracted. There is no dispute on the factual score that the\npetitioner/employer is covered by the provisions of the Act.\n\nSection 2-A\nhas been incorporated in the Act by amending\nAct 26 of 1984, which was brought into force with effect from\n11.02.1981.\nSection 2-A\nhas provided for the definition of the\nexpression continuous service. The claim of the respective\nemployees is obviously rested upon this provision.\nSection 4\nof the\nAct has created an obligation for payment of gratuity to an\nemployee on the termination of his employment after he has\nrendered continuous service for not less than five years, on his\nsuperannuation, or on his resignation or retirement, or on his\ndeath or disablement due to accident or disease. Sub\nSection 2\n\nthereof would spelt out that for every completed year of service or\npart thereof in excess of six months, the employer shall pay\ngratuity to an employee at the rate of fifteen days wages based on\nthe rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned. Thus,\n\nSection 4\nhas created a right in the hands of the employee to\nreceive gratuity upon his superannuation, retirement or\nresignation or disablement due to accident or disease or upon his\ndeath. There was also a corresponding liability cast upon every\nemployer to pay gratuity calculated at the rate of fifteen days\nwages for every completed year of service put in by the employee.\n\nSection 5\nwhich conferred power on the appropriate government to\nexempt any establishment from the operation of the provisions of\nthis Act made it clear that such exemption can be granted, if, in\nthe opinion of the appropriate government, the employees in such\nestablishment are in receipt of gratuity or pensionary benefits not\nless favourable than the benefits conferred under the Act.\nTherefore, the power to grant exemption is clearly circumscribed by\nthe consideration that the employee of the concerned\nestablishment must be in receipt of amount of gratuity, which\ncannot be less favourable than the one which he is entitled to\nreceive in terms and in accordance with this Act.\n\nSection 7\nof the Act dealt with the determination of amount\nof gratuity. It would be appropriate to notice in detail the said\nprovision (as also the provision contained in Section 7A).\n\n7. Determination of the amount of Gratuity.- (1)\nA person who is eligible for payment of gratuity under this\nAct or any person authorised, in writing, to act on his\nbehalf shall send a written application to the employer,\nwithin such time and in such form, as may be prescribed,\nfor payment of such gratuity.\n\n(2) As soon as gratuity becomes payable, the\nemployer shall, whether an application referred to in sub-\nsection (i) has been made or not, determine the amount of\ngratuity and give notice in writing to the person to whom\nthe gratuity is payable and also to the controlling authority\nspecifying the amount of gratuity so determined.\n\n(3) The employer shall arrange to pay the amount of\ngratuity within thirty days from the date it becomes payable\nto the person to whom the gratuity is payable.\n\n(3-A) If the amount of gratuity payable under sub-\nsection (3) is not paid by the employer within the period\nspecified in sub-section (3) the employer shall pay, from the\ndate on which the gratuity becomes payable to the date on\nwhich it is paid, simple interest at such rate, not exceeding\nthe rate notified by the Central Government from time to\ntime for repayment of long term deposits, as that\nGovernment may, by notification specify:\n\nProvided that no such interest shall be payable if the\ndelay in the payment is due to the fault of the employee and\nthe employer has obtained permission in writing from the\nControlling Authority for the delayed payment on this\nground].\n\n(4)(a) If there is any dispute as to the amount of\ngratuity payable to an employee under this Act or as to the\nadmissibility of any claim of, or in relation to, an employee\nfor payment of gratuity, or as to the person entitled to\nreceive the gratuity, the employer shall deposit with the\nControlling Authority such amount as he admits to be\npayable by him as gratuity.\n\n[***]\n[(b) Where there is a dispute with regard to any\nmatter or matters specified in Clause (a), the employer or\nemployee or any other person raising the dispute may make\nan application to the Controlling Authority for deciding the\ndispute.]\n[(c)] The Controlling Authority shall, after due inquiry\nand after giving the parties to the dispute a reasonable\nopportunity of being heard, determine the matter or matters\nin dispute and, if, as a result of such inquiry any amount is\nfound to be payable to the employee, the Controlling\nAuthority shall direct the employer to pay such amount or,\nas the case may be, such amount as reduced by the\namount already deposited by the employer.]\n[(d)] The Controlling Authority shall pay the amount\ndeposited, including the excess amount, if any, deposited\nby the employer, to the person entitled thereto.\n\n[(e)] As soon as may be after a deposit is made under\nClause (a), the Controlling Authority shall pay the amount\nof the deposit-\n\n(i) to the applicant where he is the employee; or\n\n(ii) where the applicant is the employee, to the\n[nominee or, as the case may be, the guardian of such\nnominee or] heir of the employee if the Controlling\nAuthority is satisfied that there is no dispute as to the right\nof the applicant to receive the amount of gratuity.\n\n(5) For the purpose of conducting an inquiry under\nSub-Section (4), the controlling authority shall have the\nsame powers as are vested in a Court, while trying a suit,\nunder\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n,1908 (5 of 1908), in\nrespect of the following matters namely:-\n\n(a) enforcing the attendance of any person or\nexamining him on oath;\n\n(b) requiring the discovery and production of\ndocuments;\n\n(c) receiving evidence on affidavits;\n\n(d) issuing commissions for the examination of\nwitnesses.\n\n(6) Any inquiry under this Section shall be a judicial\nproceeding within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228,\nand for the purpose of\nSection 196\n, of the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860 (45 of 1860).\n\n(7) Any person aggrieved by an order under sub-\n\nsection (4), may, within sixty days from the date of the\nreceipt of the order, prefer an appeal to the appropriate\nGovernment or such other authority as may be specified by\nthe appropriate Government in this behalf:\n\nProvided that the appropriate Government or the\nappellate authority, as the case may be, may, if it is\nsatisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient\ncause from preferring the appeal within the said period of\nsixty days, extend the said period by a further period of\nsixty days.\n\n[Provided further that no appeal by an employer shall\nbe admitted unless at the time of preferring the appeal, the\nappellant either produces a certificate of the controlling\nauthority to the effect that the appellant has deposited with\nhim an amount equal to the amount of gratuity required to\nbe deposited under subsection (4), or deposits with the\nappellate authority such amount.]\n(8) The appropriate Government or the appellate\nauthority, as the case may be, may, after giving the parties\nto the appeal a reasonable opportunity of being heard,\nconfirm, modify or reverse the decision of the controlling\nauthority.\n\n[7A. Inspectors.-(1) The appropriate Government\nmay, by notification, appoint as many Inspectors, as it\ndeems fit, for the purposes of this Act.\n\n(2) The appropriate Government may, by general or\nspecial order, define the area to which the authority of an\nInspector so appointed shall extend and where two or more\nInspectors are appointed for the same area, also provide, by\nsuch order, for the distribution or allocation of work to be\nperformed by them under the Act.\n\n(3) Every Inspector shall be deemed to be a public\nservant within the meaning of\nSec. 21\nof the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860 (Act 45 of 1860).\n\n[7B. Powers of Inspectors.- (1) Subject to any rules\nmade by the appropriate Government in this behalf, an\nInspector may, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any\nof the provisions of this Act or the conditions, if any, of any\nexemption granted thereunder, have been complied with,\nexercise all or any of the following powers, namely:-\n\n(a) require an employer to furnish such information\nas he may consider necessary;\n\n(b) enter and inspect, at all reasonable hours, with\nsuch assistants (if any), being persons in the service of the\nGovernment or local or any public authority, as he thinks\nfit, any premises of or place in any factory, mine, oil-field,\nplantation, port, railway company, shop or other\nestablishment to which this Act applies, for the purpose of\nexamining any register, record or notice or other document\nrequired to be kept or exhibited under this Act or the rules\nmade thereunder, or otherwise kept or exhibited in relation\nto the employment of any person or the payment of gratuity\nto the employees, and require the production thereof for\ninspection;\n\n(c) examine with respect to any matter relevant to\nany of the purposes aforesaid, the employer or any person\nwhom he finds in such premises or place and who, he has\nreasonable cause to believe, is an employee employed\ntherein;\n\n(d) make copies of, or take extracts from any register,\nrecord, notice or other document, as he may consider\nrelevant, and where he has reason to believe that any\noffence under this Act has been committed by an employer,\nsearch and seize with such assistance as he may think fit,\nsuch register, record, notice or other document as he may\nconsider relevant in respect of that offence;\n\n(e) exercise such other powers as may be prescribed.\n(2) Any person required to produce any register,\nrecord, notice or other document or to give any information,\nby an Inspector under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be\nlegally bound to do so within the meaning of\nSections 175\n\nand\nof the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\n\n(3) The provisions of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n,\n1973 (2 of 1974), shall so far as may be, apply to any\nsearch or seizure under this section as they apply to any\nsearch or seizure made under the authority of a warrant\nissued under Section 94 of that Code.]\n\nUnder sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\n, the person who is eligible\nfor payment of gratuity was required to send a written application\nto the employer, within such time and in such form, as may be\nprescribed, for payment of such gratuity. Since\nSection 15\nof the\nAct conferred rule making power on the appropriate government,\nrules have been accordingly framed.\n\nSo far as the Central Government is concerned, it made the\nPayment of Gratuity (Central) Rules, 1972. Rule 7 dealt with the\napplication of gratuity and spelt out that the employee who is\neligible for payment of gratuity shall apply, ordinarily within 30\ndays from the date the gratuity became payable in Form-I to the\nemployer. Sub Rule 5 thereof made it clear that an application for\npayment of gratuity filed after the expiry of the period specified in\nthis Rule shall also be entertained by the employer, if the applicant\nadduces sufficient cause for the delay in preferring the claim.\nHowever, it did not stop there but proceeded to clarify that no\nclaim for gratuity under the Act shall be invalid merely because the\nclaimant failed to present his application within the specified\nperiod. Thus, it was abundantly clear that no claim for payment of\ngratuity shall be treated as invalid merely because the said claim is\nnot made within the period of 30 days from the date the gratuity\nbecomes payable. Thus clearly bringing out that delay in\nsubmission of the claim is not fatal.\n\nFurther, the reason behind Sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\n\nrequiring submission of an application to the employer seeking\npayment of gratuity can be gathered from\nSection 4\nof the Act itself\nwhich created the obligation for payment of gratuity. Gratuity is\nliable to be paid to those who have resigned from service and also\nin case of death of an employee, who served the employer for a\nperiod of 5 years. It is conceivable, hence, that when an employee\nresigns and thus terminates the employment with the employer,\npayment of gratuity may not have occasioned on the last day of his\nemployment. Hence if an application is filed by him, the\nsettlement of gratuity becomes easy and effective, giving little or no\nscope for disputes thereafter. Similarly in case of death of an\nemployee, the employer may not be keeping the data of family\nmembers of such an employee. Further, there can be many\nclaimants in such cases like a surviving spouse, children, some of\nthem could be minors and parents etc. The employer by\nentertaining an application from any of them can settle the gratuity\namount payable to the employee and can also seek indemnification\nfrom any subsequent claim. Hence the requirement of submission\nof an application is contemplated by sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nof\nthe Act. Sub\nSections 2\nand\nof\nSection 7\nof the Act are most vital\nfor understanding as to whether the Parliament has contemplated\nto forfeit the right to receive gratuity at all. Sub\nSection 2\nof\n\nSection 7\nof the Act brings out emphatically that as soon as the\ngratuity becomes payable, the employer shall, whether an\napplication referred to in Sub-\nSection 1\nhas been made or not,\ndetermine the amount of gratuity and give notice in writing to the\nperson to whom the gratuity is payable and also to the Controlling\nAuthority specifying the amount of gratuity so determined.\nThereafter, Sub\nSection 3\nspelt out that employer shall arrange\npayment of the amount of gratuity within 30 days from the date it\nbecomes payable to the person to whom the gratuity is payable.\nTherefore, when Sub\nSections 1\n,\nand\nof\nSection 7\nof the Act are\nread together it emerges that the employee is entitled to make a\nformal claim for payment of gratuity, but however, irrespective of\nthe fact whether or not such a claim has been made by the\nemployee, the employer is under an obligation not only to\ndetermine the amount of gratuity payable to the employee but also\neffect the payment within 30 days from the date the gratuity\nbecomes payable. Therefore, to my mind the provisions contained\nunder Sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nof the Act are purely directory,\nwhile the provisions contained under Sub\nSections 2\nand\nof\n\nSection 7\nare mandatory in content and scope. The payment of\ngratuity is a statutorily created obligation on the employer. It is for\nhim to make a calculation and determine the amount of gratuity\npayable and also effect its payment. For payment of gratuity, the\nemployer need not wait for receipt of a claim in Form-I from the\nemployee. The employer was required, on his own, to comply with\nSub\nSections 2\nand\nof\nSection 7\n, independent of the provision\ncontained in Sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nof the Act. That was the\nmandate contained in Sub\nSection 2\nof\nSection 7\n, by employing the\nwords whether an application referred to in Sub Section (1) has\nbeen made or not. As a matter of ordinary prudence and also as a\ngolden rule of construction no part/words of a statute should be\nleft out as redundant. If there is a dispute between the employee\nand employer, then perhaps, such dispute becomes resolvable by\nthe Controlling Authority. My opinion about the mandatory nature\nof the provisions contained under Sub\nSections 2\nand\nof\nSection\nderive additional support, apart from the tone and tenor of the\nwords employed therein suggest, from the provisions contained\nunder\nSections 7-A\n,\n7-B\n,\n,\nand\nof the Act. Sections 7-A and\n7-B have been incorporated by the amending Act 25 of 1984,\nwhich has been brought into force from 01.07.1984. Under\nSection 7-A, the appropriate government was required to appoint\nas many inspectors as it deems fit for purpose of the Act. Under\nSection 7-B, powers have been conferred upon the Inspector for\nthe purpose of ascertaining whether any of the provisions of the\nAct or the conditions, if any, of exemption granted thereunder,\nhave been complied with or not by the employer. Inter-alia the\nInspector can require an employer to furnish such information as\nhe may consider it necessary or enter and inspect at all reasonable\nhours any premises of any place in any factory, mine, oil field,\nplantation, port, railway company, shop or other establishment to\nwhich the Act applies for purpose of examining any register, record\nor notice or other document required to be kept or exhibited;\nexamine with respect to any matter relevant for any other purpose\nspelt out above, the employer or any person etc. Thus, during the\ncourse of an inspection, if it is revealed that accurate payment of\ngratuity to any employee has not occurred, there was scope\nprovided for rectification of such an error at the behest of\nInspector/Enforcement Officer. Employees may be getting\nsuperannuated regularly or routinely in any establishment\ndepending upon the date of their superannuation. But the\ninspections are not required to be carried out on month to month\nbasis. It may be undertaken once in a while, let us say 6 months\nor 1 year or even after a longer period. That is the reason why the\nstatute has not attempted to either insulate the payment once\nmade or the right to receive the accurate amount of gratuity.\n\nSection 8\nenables the Controlling Authority to issue a certificate for\nthat amount to the Collector, to recover the same together with\ncompound interest thereon as arrears of land revenue.\nSection 8\n\nhas not set out any time limit within which an application is\nrequired to be made by the aggrieved person to whom the amount\nof gratuity payable under the Act is not paid. Therefore, it is clear\nthat the Parliament has not intended to prescribe any specific\nperiod of time for payment of gratuity by the employer at the\nbehest of the Controlling Authority.\nSection 9\nrecognizes any false\nstatement or false representation made for purpose of avoiding any\npayment of gratuity as punishable with imprisonment for a term\nwhich may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to\nRs.10,000/- (with effect from 01.10.1987) or with both. Sub\n\nSection 2\nthereof clearly spelt out that any employer who\ncontravenes, or makes default in complying with any of the\nprovisions of the Act or any Rule or order made thereunder shall\nbe punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be\nless than three months but which may extend to one year, or with\nfine which shall not be less than 10,000/- but which may extend\nto Rs.20,000/- or with both. Thus,\nSection 9\nhas recognized the\ndefault in complying with any of the provisions of the Act as an\noffence by itself. It stands to good sense, therefore, to assume that\nany failure to comply with sub\nSections 2\nand\nof\nsection 7\nof the\nAct envisages action contemplated by\nSection 9\nof the Act to be\ntaken against the employer.\nThe Act\nnever contemplated any such\ncorresponding penal action against the employee for his failure to\ncomply with sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nof the Act.\nSection 11\nof\nthe Act provided for matters of cognizance to be taken of such\noffences. When all these provisions have been kept in view, it\nemerges that every employer was required to comply with sub\n\nSections 2\nand\nof\nSection 7\non his own without waiting for a\nformal application to be made under Sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nof\nthe Act by the employee.\n\nThe provisions of the\nGratuity Act\nhave been brought forth\nas a social security measure for providing the necessary financial\nsupport and assistance to the employee concerned. Apart from\npayment of wages, once the provisions of the Act become\napplicable to any establishment, an additional obligation is thrust\nupon the employer to make the payment of gratuity, irrespective of\nwhether he likes the quality of services rendered by the employee\nor not. The statute itself, therefore, has not recognized any outer\nperiod of limitation for payment of gratuity to the employee\nconcerned at the behest of the Controlling Authority.\n\nThe criticism of N. Rajeswara Rao that payment of gratuity is\nnot a continuous affair, but is only a one time affair and hence an\nouter limit of period is in the realm of contemplation requires\nserious consideration. If an employer has properly and correctly\ncalculated the amount of gratuity payable to the employee, the\npayment thereof is only a one time measure and it will not recur\nonce again. Only in the event of any dispute in the matter of\ncalculation/quantification of the amount of gratuity payable,\nperhaps, such a dispute is capable of being resolved by the\nControlling Authority later in point of time to the occurring of the\nevent of liability. If there exists, no such dispute between the\nemployer and employee, the payment of gratuity is made strictly a\none time affair. In that respect, therefore, the criticism of Sri\nN.Rajeswara Rao that payment of gratuity is not a continuous\naffair is required to be accepted in all such cases where there is no\ndispute raised. In contrast to payment of pension, which is\nregulated on month to month basis, appropriate and correct\npayment of gratuity being a one time affair is confined to a third\ntime affair. However, where there is a dispute, the actual payment\nof gratuity once before made does not attain any such finality.\nLest the very scope for resolution of disputes becomes illusory and\nan unfaithful employer can wash his hands off, once he tenders\nthe amount of gratuity, even if the same is not accurate.\n\nIncidentally one of the questions that is required to be\nresolved is whether the provisions of the limitation Act are purely\nprocedural or they are also substantive legal principles. Such a\nquestion is not free from doubt or ambiguity. However, in a classic\nexposition, the Supreme Court in\nBharat Barrel and Drum Mfg.\nCompany Private Limited and Another Vs. The Employees\nState Insurance Corporation\n, at page No.860 has brought out\nthe relevant principles as under:\n\n4. The topic of procedure has been the subject of academic\ndebate and scrutiny as well as of judicial decisions over a long\nperiod but in spite of it, it has defied the formulation of a logical test\nor definition which enables us, to determine and demarcate the\nbounds where procedural law ends and substantive law begins, or\nin other words it hardly facilitates us in distinguishing in a given\ncase whether the subject of controversy concerns procedural law or\nsubstantive law. The reason for this appears to be obvious, because\nsubstantive law deals with right and is fundamental while\nprocedure is concerned with legal process involving actions and\nremedies, which Salmond defines \"as that branch of law which\ngoverns the process of litigation\", or to put it in another way,\nsubstantive law is that which we enforce while procedure deals with\nrules by which we enforce it. We are tempted in this regard to cite a\npicturesque aphorism of Therman Arnold when he says\n\"Substantive law is canonised procedure. Procedure is unfrocked\nsubstantive law(HLJ 617 at p.645)\".\n\n5. .The necessity for enacting periods of limitation is\nto ensure that actions are commenced within a particular period,\nfirstly to assure the availability of evidence documentary as well as\noral to enable the defendant to contest the claim against him;\n\nsecondly to give effect to the principle that law does not assist a\nperson who is inactive and sleeps over his lights by allowing them\nwhen challenged or disputed to remain dormant, without asserting\nthem in a court of law. The, principle which forms the basis of this\nrule is expressed in the maxim vigilantibus, non dormientibus, jura\nsubveniunt (the laws give help to those who are watchful and not to\nthose who sleep). Therefore the, object of the statutes of limitations\nis to compel a person to exercise his right to action within a\nreasonable time as also to discourage and suppress stale, fake or\nfraudulent claims. While this is so there are two aspects of the\nstatutes of limitation the one concerns the extinguishment of the\nright if a claim or action is not commenced with a particular time\nand the other merely bars the claim without affecting the right\nwhich either remains merely as a moral obligation or can be availed\nof to furnish the consideration for a fresh enforceable obligation.\nWhere a statute prescribing the limitation extinguishes the right, it\naffects substantive rights while that which purely pertains to the\ncommencement of action without touching the right is said to be\nprocedural.\n\nIn this context, it will also be useful to notice the judgment\nof the Supreme Court in\nE.S.I.C. Vs. C.C.Santhakumar\n, wherein\na similar question has been answered as under:\n\nOn a plain reading of Sections 45A and 45B in Chapter IV\nand 75 and 77 in\nChapter VI of the Act\n, as indicated above, there\ncannot be any doubt that the area and the scope and ambit of\nSections 45A and 75 are quite different.\n\nIf the period of limitation, prescribed under proviso (b) of\nSection 77(1A) is read into the provisions of Section 45A, it would\ndefeat the very purpose of enacting Sections 45A and 45B. The\nprescription of limitation under\nSection 77(IA)(b)\nof the Act has not\nbeen made applicable to the adjudication proceedings under\nSection 45A by the legislature, since such a restriction would\nrestrict the right of the Corporation to determine the claims under\nSection 45A and the right of recovery under Section 45B and,\nfurther, it would give a benefit to an unscrupulous employer. The\nperiod of five years, fixed under Regulation 32(2) of the Regulations,\nis with regard to maintenance of registers of workmen and the same\ncannot take away the right of the Corporation to adjudicate,\ndetermine and fix the liability of the employer under\nSection 45A\nof\nthe Act, in respect of the claim other than those found in the\nregister of workmen, maintained and filed in terms of the\nRegulations.\n\nThe distinction to be borne in mind, therefore, is where there\nexists any extinguishment of rights or obligations under the\nstatute, particularly, due to the delay and default on the part of the\nopposite party. The analysis of the provisions contained in the Act\nrevealed that only sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nrequired the person\neligible to receive gratuity to file his application with the employer\nseeking such payment. The right of the employee to receive\ngratuity under\nSection 4\nhas not been extinguished by the failure\nto comply with sub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nof the Act. On the other\nhand, the obligation thrust upon the employer under sub\nSection 2\n\nof\nSection 4\nhas found its full echo in sub\nSections 2\nand\nof\n\nSection 7\nof the Act. The obligations thrust upon the employer\nunder Sub\nSection 2\nof\nSection 4\nwill not get discharged until and\nunless the payment in toto, subject to the limit of ceiling fixed on\nthe maximum amount has been achieved. In other words, the\nobligation to make payment of gratuity will never get discharged,\nparticularly, due to default of the employee to lodge a claim under\nSub\nSection 1\nof\nSection 7\nof the Act. In the absence of any such\nextinguishment of rights and obligations statutorily created by\n\nSection 4\nof the Act, the provisions of any period of limitation\nbecome purely procedural and they are liable to be treated as non-\nsubstantive. This apart, any exercise of rule making power under\n\nSection 15\nof the Act, is not open to the appropriate Government to\nprescribe any period of limitation, which might work out to\nextinguish the right itself. A rule making power is conferred only\nfor purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act and they are\nnot liable to be utilized for creating additional burdens or liabilities\nwhich are not contemplated by the Act itself. Any such exercise of\npower, which tends to limit the applicability of the provisions of the\nstatute amounts to unauthorized exercise of power and\nconsequently, the Doctrine of Ultra Vires gets attracted.\nIn fact,\nthe judgment in\nBharat Barrels\ncase (\nSupra 1) and E.S.I.\nCorporations\ncase (Supra 2) would lend great support to this\nview of mine.\n\nFurther the cases on which reliance was placed by Sri\nRajeswara Rao, deal with, the powers of the Appellate Authority to\ncondone delay beyond what is provided by the\nGratuity Act\n. That\nwas not the present case. Hence, I am of the opinion, that they do\nnot have any bearing upon the present cases.\n\nHence, these writ petitions are dismissed. No order as to\ncosts.\n\nThe miscellaneous petitions, if any pending in these\npetitions, shall stand dismissed.\n\n_______________________________________\nJUSTICE NOOTY RAMAMOHANA RAO\n01.10.2015",

HENCE, THEY ARE HEARD TOGETHER AND ARE DECIDED BY THIS COMMON ORDER.  THE PETITIONER IS THE KRISHNA DISTRICT MILK PRODUCERS MUTUALLY AIDED COOPERATIVE UNION, VIJAYAWADA (HENCEFORTH REFERRED TO AS THE EMPLOYER). THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THE RESPONDENT/EMPLOYEE CONCERNED IN EACH OF THESE CASES HAS RENDERED SERVICE TO THE PETITIONER/EMPLOYER AND RETIRED FROM ITS SERVICE ON ATTAINING THE AGE OF SUPERANNUATION. IT IS ALSO NOT IN DISPUTE THAT THE PETITIONER/EMPLOYER HAS SETTLED AND PAID THE AMOUNT OF GRATUITY PAYABLE TO THEM AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER HIS RETIREMENT. HOWEVER, EACH OF THESE EMPLOYEES HAVING THUS ACCEPTED THE PAYMENT OF GRATUITY, HAS APPROACHED THE 2ND RESPONDENT-CONTROLLING AUTHORITY UNDER THE PAYMENT OF GRATUITY ACT (HENCEFORTH REFERRED TO AS CONTROLLING AUTHORITY), MAKING A FURTHER CLAIM FOR PAYMENT OF DIFFERENTIAL AMOUNT OF GRATUITY RUNNING TO FEW THOUSAND RUPEES MORE THAN WHAT HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY THEM, ON THE BASIS THAT THE SERVICE RENDERED BY EACH ONE OF THEM PRIOR TO THE REGULARIZATION OF THEIR SERVICES BY THE EMPLOYER IS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND CONSIDERATION FOR PURPOSE OF COMPUTATION OF GRATUITY. IT IS THE CLAIM OF THE RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES THAT IF THE LENGTH OF SERVICE RENDERED BY THEM PRIOR TO THE DATE OF REGULARIZATION OF THEIR SERVICES WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND CONSIDERATION, THE QUANTUM OF GRATUITY PAYABLE WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER, BY FEW THOUSAND RUPEES THAN WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SETTLED AND PAID BY THE EMPLOYER.
