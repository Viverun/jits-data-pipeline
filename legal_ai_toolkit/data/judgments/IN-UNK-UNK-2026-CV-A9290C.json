Any other relief/reliefs as the applicant is entitled and\n your lordships may deem fit and proper in the ends of\n justice.\"\n\n FACTS IN BRIEF\n\n 3. Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by applicant in the instant OA\n\n are that husband of applicant late Shri Nageshwar Kamti was an employee\n\n of Department of Posts died in harness on 08.07.2010. Applicant is\n\n aggrieved by two successive letters issued vide letter No.B2-7/CL(TS)\n\n dated 23.11.2016 (Annexure A-1) containing speaking and reasoned order\n\n No.B2-07/CL(T/S) dated 14.12.2017 (Annexure A-2) containing revised\n\n speaking order issued by Superintendent of Post Office, Darbhanga\n\n Division filed in CP No.050/00114/2015 denying her claim for family\n\n 3 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n pension and other retiral benefits because husband of the applicant died in\n\n harness and was not regularized as Group 'D'.\n\n 4. The husband of the applicant was initially appointed in the\n\n Department of Posts vide order dated 30.06.1992 (Annexure A-3) and was\n\n conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and vide Memo dated\n\n 11.01.2000 (Annexure A-4). As per rules/instructions, husband of the\n\n applicant was required to be granted the status of a temporary group 'D'\n\n employee after three years of service as a temporary status employee but\n\n the same was delayed inordinately and finally the same was granted vide\nPatna\nBench\n letter dated 11.01.2000 (Annexure A-4). Thereafter, he was given all the\n\n benefits pursuant to G.I., Dept. of Posts, Lr.No.66-9/91-SPB.I dated\n\n 30.11.1992 (Annexure A-5). Regularization of husband of the applicant\n\n was also delayed by the respondents violating the departmental rules and\n\n unfortunately husband of applicant died in harness on 06.07.2010.\n\n Husband of the applicant was being given pay scale of a temporary Group\n\n 'D' employee and necessary deductions were being made from his salary\n\n including all other benefits at par with Group 'D' employee.\n\n 5. After the death of husband of applicant, applicant was neither\n\n granted death/pensionary benefits even after rendering about 30 years of\n\n service by her husband nor was her request for appointment on\n\n compassionate ground acceded to despite the fact that applicant was\n\n having no sources of income to take care of the family. Claim of the\n\n applicant for settlement of family pension as well as payment of retiral\n\n dues are being denied on the ground that her husband was not regularized\n\n in the department.\n\n 4 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 6. It is the case of the applicant that the action of the respondents is\n\n violative of the statutory rules containing benefits for temporary\n\n employees as well as against the settled norms. Conditions of service of\n\n temporary employees of the Central Government are regulated under the\n\n provisions of the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965\n\n (For brevity herein after referred as Rules, 1965) and under the same\n\n rules, the applicant is entitled to receive family pension as well as other\n\n retiral dues of her husband.\n\n 7. The applicant filed OA No.519/2011 before this Tribunal decided\nPatna\nBench\n on 11.03.2014 (Annexure A-9) directing the respondents to consider the\n\n case of applicant and a reasoned and speaking order to that effect be\n\n passed within three months. But the respondents did not comply the said\n\n order. Therefore, applicant had to file CP No.114/2015. Meanwhile,\n\n respondents passed two successive orders denying her claim for family\n\n pension and other retiral benefits erroneously, impugned in this OA and\n\n annexed as Annexure A-1 & A-2. While issuing the impugned orders the\n\n respondents have purposely suppressed the recent orders passed by the\n\n Hon'ble High Court, Patna dated 04.09.2017 passed in CWJC No.10978\n\n of 2017 and order dated 11.09.2017 passed in CWJC No.11435/2017.\n\n 8. Husband of the applicant died on 08.07.2010, he has been survived\n\n by applicant, two unmarried daughters and two sons. There is no source of\n\n income to the family of deceased. The applicant is eligible and entitled to\n\n family pension as well as retiral dues of her deceased husband but the\n\n same is being denied to her erroneously and the entire family members of\n\n the deceased employee are left on the verge of starvation.\n\n 5 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 9. Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have\n\n filed written statement and stated that Shri Nageshwar Kamti, deceased\n\n employee, husband of applicant was engaged as Contingent paid casual\n\n labour, was conferred temporary status in pursuance of Dte's letter dated\n\n 12.04.1991 communicated vide Supdt. Of Post Offices, Darbhanga Memo\n\n dated 30.06.1992. the deceased employee was given temporary status\n\n w.e.f. 29.11.1989 vide order dated 11.01.2000 and with temporary status\n\n expired on 06.07.2010 and not regularized against the post of Temporary\n\n Status Group 'D' till his death. The applicant and other family members\nPatna\nBench of the deceased employee is not entitled to get pensionary benefits and\n\n relaxation for appointment under compassionate ground.\n\n 10. Applicant earlier filed OA No.519/2011 before this Tribunal which\n\n was decided on 11.03.2014 with a direction to the respondents to pass a\n\n reasoned and speaking order taking into account the order passed by this\n\n Tribunal in OA No.164/2008 filed by one Smt. Meena Devi. In\n\n compliance thereof, respondents passed the impugned order dated\n\n 23.11.2016 (Annexure A-1). Since in the said speaking order direction in\n\n Smt. Meena Devi's case (supra) was inadvertently overlooked, second\n\n speaking order taking into account the order passed therein, was passed on\n\n 14.12.2017 (Annexure A-2) clearly stating therein that order in the case of\n\n Smt. Meena Devi (supra) has been challenged by the department before\n\n the Hon'ble High Court, Patna by way of CWJC No.7760 of 2015 and\n\n Hon'ble High Court, Patna, vide order dated 11.05.2016 stayed operation\n\n of Tribunal's order passed in Smt. Meena Devi's case (supra). Therefore,\n\n 6 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n final decision in the case on hand will be taken after the decision of\n\n Hon'ble High Court of Patna in Smt. Meena Devi's case (supra).\n\n 11. It is stated in the WS that deceased husband of applicant was\n\n conferred with temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 vide SPOs Memo dated\n\n 11.01.2000. It is true that vide order dated 11.01.2000 it was ordered that\n\n deceased employee would be treated at par with temporary Group 'D'\n\n employee after completion of three years satisfactory service but it was\n\n made clear that under Point NO.3 contained in the said Memo dated\n\n 11.01.2000 that he would get pension and terminal benefits only after\nPatna\nBench\n regularization of his service in Group 'D' cadre. Since the deceased was\n\n never regularized as Group 'D' employee, applicant is not entitled to get\n\n any benefit under existing provisions of departmental rules by reckoning\n\n of her husband services towards qualifying service entitling her for family\n\n pension and pensionary benefits. Since services of deceased employee\n\n could not be regularized as Group 'D' employee, question of considering\n\n the applicant for appointment on compassionate ground does not arise. It\n\n is also stated in the WS that the decision of Hon'ble High Court, Patna,\n\n relied upon by applicant in case of Meena Devi (supra), does not relate to\n\n this Division and hence not applicable in the case on hand.\n\n SUBMISSIONS\n\n 12. Shri J.K. Karn, learned counsel for applicant contended that:-\n\n (i) The husband of the present applicant was initially appointed as\n casual labour in 1979, granted temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989\n vide Memo dated 11.01.2000 and on completion of three years\n from 29.11.1992 as temporary employee, respondents declared at\n par with Group 'D' regular employee and granted all benefits\n\n 7 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n admissible at par regular Group 'D' of Postal Department\n pursuant to O.M. dated 30.11.1992.\n\n (ii) The husband of applicant died in harness on 06.10.2010, lapses on\n part of respondents not regularized in last 30 years of continuous\n services.\n\n \n(iii) The applicant cannot be made to suffer on lapses on part of\n respondents not issued order of regularization and neither rejected\n till death in harness on 06.10.2010.

The issue is no more re-integra.\n\n (vi) Applicant is entitled for family pension/pension and other benefits\n in light of Rules 1965 and also read with, explanation (6)\n provided, appended to Rule 2, applicability Clause of the CCS\n (Pension) Rules, 2021 to the extent these rule shall also apply to\n the case of government servants appointed in temporary capacity\n who retired/died before appointed in a substantive capacity, the\nPatna\nBench benefits under these rules shall be payable to Govt. servant to\n extent provided in Rules, 1965.\n\n (vii) The husband of applicant and now applicant is also covered by\n Schemes, Rules 1965 and read with CCS (Pension) Rules and\n entitled for pension and retiral benefits.\n\n (viii) The husband of applicant is entitled to reckon qualifying services\n for pension purposes for casual worker after obtaining temporary\n status 50% of his services till regularization casual worker before\n obtaining temporary status is also entitled to reckon 50% of\n casual service and casual worker appointed any post either\n substantively or officiating entitled to reckon entire period from\n date of taking charge.\n\n \n(ix) The husband of applicant is entitled for reckoning, his services for\n purposes of pension as held by this Tribunal in identical-pari-\n Materia rules in case Mojib Ansari versus Union of India, OA\n No. 265/2021 decided on 29.05.2023 and in para-materia\n provision in case of \nUnion of India vs. Rakesh Kumar\n (2017) 13\n SCC 388 by Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n (x) Applicant cannot be made to suffer merely stating that husband of\n the applicant could not be promoted before his death on\n 06.07.2010 after serving for more than 30 years in active life\n span.\n\n 9 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 13. Shri Ravindra Rai, learned Additional C.G.S.C. appearing for\n respondents submitted that :\n\n (i) The husband of applicant engaged as Casual Labour in 1979-1980\n and continued with Temporary Status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 but as\n sanctioned regular Group 'D' posts were not available, the\n husband of the applicant could not be considered for\n regularization on regular post and died on 06.07.2010. On the\n representation, order dated 23.11.2016 and order dated\n\n 14.12.2017 (Annexure A-1 & !-2), were passed by the\n respondents stating that she will not be granted family pension as\n her husband was not regularized before his death.\n\n (ii) The husband of applicant is not entitled to reckon qualifying\n services for pensionary purposes being at par with Group 'D'\nPatna\nBench employee and not entitled under CCS (Pension) Rules and Rules\n 1965 for grant of pension as he was never regularized and died as\n temporary employee.\n\n THE ISSUE\n\n 14. From the above submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and\n material placed on record. The admitted fact that husband of the applicant\n joined services as casual labour. Thereafter conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n 29.11.1989 after rendering continuous long, efficient service all his active life\n till his death on 06.07.2010. The core issue arises before this Tribunal for\n determination is:-\n\n \"Whether deceased employee, the husband of the applicant who was\n appointed as casual lobour and thereafter conferred the status of temporary\n employee w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and died on 06.07.2010 after 30 years of active\n service and his legal heir-Smt. Urmila Devi-the applicant is entitled to\n benefit of pension or family pension or not?\"\n\n ANALYSIS\n\n 15. Before dealing with the rival contentions advanced at the Bar. It is\n apposite to quote relevant portion of language of the statutory scheme, policy of\n Union of India Ministry of Communications & I.T., Department of Posts, The\n Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1965, the Central Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules 2021, judgment binding precedents in similar cases,\n in cases of pari-materia provisions passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble\n High Courts, our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and Benches of the Central\n Administrative Tribunal as under:-.\n\n 10 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n RULE OF LAW\n (A)(i) The casual labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization\n Scheme issued by Department of Posts, Govt. of India dated 12.04.1991 drawn in\n compliance of Hon'ble Supreme Court directions and approved by his Excellency\n President of India relevant portion is reproduced as under for appreciation of the\n Core issue involved in the present OA:-\n\n Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularisation)\n Scheme : In compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court a scheme was drawn up by this Department in consultation with the\n Ministries of Law, Finance and Personnel and the President has been\n pleased to approve the said scheme. The scheme is as follows :-\n\n 1. Temporary status would be conferred on all casual labourers in\n employment as on 29.11.1969 and who continue to be currently\n employed and have rendered continuous service of at least one\n year during the year during the year they must have been engaged\n for a period of 240 days (206 days in the case of offices observing\n five days week).\n\n 2. Such casual workers engaged for full working hours viz 8 hours\n including ½ hour's lunch time will be paid at daily rate on the\n basis of the minimum of the pay scale for a regular Group 'D'\n official including DA, HRA with CCA.\n\n 3. Benefit of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'\nPatna\nBench employee would be taken into account for calculating per month\n rate wages after completion of one year of service from the date\n of conferment of Temporary Status. Such increment will be taken\n into account after every one year of service subject to\n performance of duty for at least 240 days (206 days in\n establishments observing five days week) in the year.\n\n 4. Leave entitlement will be one day for every 10 days' of work\n Casual leave or any other kind of leave except maternity leave,\n will not be admissible. No encashment of leave is permissible on\n termination of services for any reason or on the casual labourers\n quitting service.\n\n 5. Maternity leave to lady full time casual lanbourers will be\n allowed as admissible to regular Group 'D' employees.\n\n 6. 50% of the service rendered under Temporary Status would be\n counted for the purpose of retirement benefits after regularization\n as a regular Group 'D'. official.\n\n 7. Conferment of Temporary Status does not automatically imply\n that the casual labourers would be appointed as a regular Group\n 'D' employees within any fixed time frame. Appointment in\n Group 'D' vacancies will continue to be done as per the extant\n Recruitment Rules, which stipulate preference to eligible ED\n employee.\n\n 8. After rendering three years' continuous service after\n conferment of temporary status the casual labourers would be\n treated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees for the\n purposes of contribution to General Provident Fund. They\n would also further be eligible for the grant of Festival\n Advance, Flood Advance on the same conditions as are\n applicable to temporary Group 'D' employee provided they\n furnish two sureties from permanent Government servants of\n this Department.\n\n 9. Their entitlement to Productivity Linked Bonus will continue to\n be at the rate applicable to casual labourers.\n\n 10. Temporary status does not debar dispensing with the service of\n the casual labourers after following the due procedure.\n\n 11. If a labourer with temporary status commits a misconduct and the\n same is proved in an enquiry after giving him reasonable\n opportunity his services will be dispensed with.\n\n 12. Casual labourers may be regularized in units other than recruiting\n units also subject to availability of vacancies.\n\n 11 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 13. For purpose of appointment as a regular Group 'D' official the\n casual labourers will be allowed age relaxation to the extent of\n service rendered by them as casual labourers.\n\n 14. The casual labourers can be deployed any where within the\n recruitment unit /territorial circle on the basis of availability of\n work.\n\n 15. The engagement of the casual labourers will continue to be on\n daily rates of pay on need basis.\n\n 16. The conferment of temporary status has no relation to availability\n of sanctioned regular Group 'D' posts.\n\n 17. No recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts except\n compassionate appointment will be done till casual labourers\n with the requisite qualification are available to fill up the posts in\n question.\n\n Further action may be taken in regard to the casual labourers by each unit\n as per the above said scheme.

According to him to earn pension it was\n necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.\n It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was\n in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary\n benefits.\n\n There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the Government for\n 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied\n the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a\n permanent employee of the government. The appellant having\n served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to\n treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.\n\n Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we\n hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent\n after he served the Government for such a long period.

No. 664/2015 (Patna) by this Tribunal to pay\n family pension, retiral dues to widow of deceased employee.\n\nPatna\nBench Their Lordships observed that husband of petitioner granted\n temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992\n and he died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more\n than 25 years of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in\n temporary status begets the benefits of pension. Failure on part of\n postal department not to regularize services of husband of private\n respondents cannot be appreciated. Their Lordships decided in favour\n of temporary status employee at par with Group 'D' employee and\n upheld order dated 22.3.2017 in similar OA No. 664/2015 (Patna). So\n also observed that in similar and identical cases adjudicated in favour\n of employees in OA No. 113/2006 decided on 21.9.2006, affirmed by\n Patna High Court vide order dated 7.11.2007 in CWJC No. 4475/2007\n and order of the High Court Patna has been affirmed by Hon'ble\n Apex Court on 4.12.2009.

Their Lordships further\n observed that if temporary employee died in harness his Legal heirs are\n entitled to family pension in light of Rule 10(2) of Temporary Service\n\n 16 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n Rules i.e Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules 1965 read\n with CCS Pension Rules 1972 and temporary rules is a social legislation\n beneficial legislation to a beneficiary is required to be extended with\n reference to various judicial pronouncements on the principle of\n beneficial legislation and affirmed order dated 20.3.2013 in OA No. 164\n of 2008 (CAT, Patna) rejecting CWJC No. 7760/2015 of Department of\n Posts.

The Hon'ble High\n Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such\n lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The\n Hon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family\n Pension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased\n employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary\n capacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary\n employee.\n\n The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of\n family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by\n notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for\n a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.\n\n 17 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 17.

The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of\n order relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n case of \nPrem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others\n reported in\n (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-\n\n \"35. There are some of the employees who have not been regularized in\n spite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or more years whereas\n they have been superannuated. As they have worked in work-charged\n establishment, not against any particular project, their services ought to\n have been regularized under the Government instructions and even as per\n the decision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma\n Devi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court in the said decision has laid down that\n in case services have been rendered for more than ten years without the\n cover of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be\n regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those employees\n who have worked for ten years or more should have been regularized. It\n would not be proper to regulate them for consideration of regularisation\n as others have been regularised, we direct that their services be treated as\n a regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to\n claiming any dues of difference in wages had they been continued in\n service regularly before attaining the age of superannuation. They shall be\n entitled to receive the pension as if they have retired from the regular\n establishment and the services rendered by them right from the day they\n entered the work-charged establishment shall be counted as qualifying\n service for purpose of pension.\n\n 36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement Benefits\n Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered in the work-charged\n establishment shall be treated as qualifying service under the aforesaid\n rule for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three\n years only before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid\n accordingly within three months. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the\n employees are allowed and filed by the State are dismissed.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n \n(ii) Hon'ble High Court, Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024 in \nUnion of India &\n Ors. vs. Awadhesh Prasad Singh\n (arising out of order dated 02.08.2021 in \nOA\n No.050/00143/2018 Awadhesh Prasad Singh vs. Union of India & Ors.\n).

The learned Tribunal dealt issue \"whether the person\n who has not been regularized by the respondents the provision of Rule 54 (2)\n of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972 is attracted or not ? The learned Tribunal\n has considered the matter and examined in detail Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension\n Rules, 1972 and observed that provisions are pari materia to Rule 75- Family\n Pension Scheme for Railway servants, 1954. \nSo also held that case is covered\n by judgement in case of \nAlka Sharma vs Union of India & ors\n 2017 (2)\n SCT (P&H) (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana.\n \nSo also\n case of \nSr. Superintendent of Post Offices and ors vs Painu Ram\n in CWP.\n\nNo.22990/2014 decided on 23.7.2018 by Hon'ble High Court of Himachal\n Pradesh and reliance has also been placed upon judgement passed by Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd) and others vs\n Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd & anr\n etc, 1990 supp. SC 113.\n \nSo also\n observed that case is fully covered by judgement of Hon'ble High Court of\n Himachal Pradesh in matter of \nUnion of India vs Meena Devi\n in CWP No.\nPatna\n 34 of 2014 decided on 23.7.2018.\n\nBench\n\n 18.

Admittedly, husband of the applicant was initially engaged as Casual\n Labour. The department of posts vide instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that\n all daily wagers working in post offices are to be treated as casual labourers.\n The department of posts has made Scheme known as Casual Labourers\n (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme effective from\n 01.10.1989. The scheme provided provisions for conferment of temporary\n status to casual labourers. So also the scheme specified advantages at part with\n Group 'D' regular employee available on conferment of status of temporary\n employee.\n\n \n20. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus\n Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n 1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that\n substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same\n emoluments as regular employees.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in \nJagrit Mazdoor\n Union\n (supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-\n\n \"After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the\n casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of\n the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are\n admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n 22. \nIn compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n \nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n (supra). The Department of Posts, Government of\n India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary\n Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been\nPatna\nBench\n drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and\n Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously\n pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers\n working continuously for long period.\n\n 23. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and\n beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits\n to long continuous working of casual labourers.\n\n 24. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on casual\n labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The husband of the applicant is\n appointee of year 1979 and has been requesting to regularize accordance with\n law as regular employee for no fault of applicant made to suffer and died on\n 06.07.2010 violating \nArticle 14\n, 21\n, 31A\n and \n300\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 25. The husband of the applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n 29.11.1989 pursuant to order dated 11.01.2000 (Annexure A-4) and the\n statutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years w.e.f. 29.11.1992 certain\n advantages to temporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum\n of the pay scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.\n Para 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to a\n Group 'D' employee after completion of one year of service from date of\n conferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of\n increment to a government servant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent\n\n 20 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n is clear as noon day in formulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and\n writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as\n social legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The\n Central Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles\n of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating\n temporary status casual labour after long period at par with temporary Group\n 'D' employee of the Department granting benefits and treating at par with and\n entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on\n regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity\n Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary\n status for retirement benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on\n absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation\n with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically\nPatna\nBench provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three\n years continuous service as temporary status.\n\n 26. The husband of the applicant was conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n 29.11.1989 (Annexure A-4) and accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on\n principles of beneficial construction and harmoniously construing the scheme.\n The husband of the applicant after three years since 29.11.1989 meaning\n thereby since 29.11.1992 has attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees\n and regularly contributed to G.P.F. The applicant was in capacity of temporary\n employee. The applicant having continuously worked as temporary status\n casual labourer since 29.11.1989 and on 29.11.1992 is holder of post of\n temporary employee/quasi permanent status and deserves to be dealt fairly by\n the model employer state accordance with guarantee enshrined in the \nArticle 14\n\n and \n21\n of the Constitution of India. This Tribunal is of the view whereof that it\n is unfair to continue the applicant such a long 30 years in temporary post and\n without considering for regularizing till death on 06.07.2010.\n\n \n27. The husband of the applicant acquired status of temporary employee\n Group 'D' of Department of Posts on 29.11.1989 and it is well settled in law\n that entitled for such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on\n regular basis. So also held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nJagrit Mazdoor\n Union\n (supra) and case of applicant squarely covered by judgment of Hon'ble\n High Court, Patna in \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra).\n\n 21 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 28. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no\n recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers\n available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged\n statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the\n Constitution of India and husband of the applicant was not regularized as for no\n fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his\n duty and not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take\n advantages and plea not even considered for regularization available to them\n that since no regularization no pension etc.\n\n 29. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in\n the O.A that respondents have not regularized services of husband of the\n applicant on regular post as per law on time, in spite of written requests and\nPatna\nBench\n died on 06.07.2010 without being regularized. This Tribunal is of the view\n since respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme\n dated 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization since 1979.\n Hence respondents cannot take advantage of own mistakes and latches to deny\n retirement benefits as not regularized deceased employee before retirement. The\n matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to\n husband of the applicant and he ought to have at least considered for\n regularization. The husband of the applicant worked since 1979 till his death\n i.e. 06.07.2010 almost more than thirty (30) years in the department in\n Contingency Paid capacity.\n\n 30. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein\n above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated\n 30.11.1992 (Annexure A-5) Government of India, Department of Posts G.I.\n (5). Benefits of casual labourers on completion of three years service in\n temporary status reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the\n employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken away\n by respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication &\n I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure\n of implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also\n envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars\n are substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to\n employee accrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and\n tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless\n\n 22 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n regularized no pensionry benefits. The said contention deserves to be rejected\n and applicant can not be denied relief claimed.\n\n 31. The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992\n quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal\n department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly\n acquired temporary status in present case w.e.f. 29.11.1989 becomes entitled to\n benefits admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of\n service for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary\n employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and\n retirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n 32. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are\n\nPatna\n regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The\nBench\n Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death\n gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as\n are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS\n Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension\n and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2\n CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired without substantive\n appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Pension\n Rules 2021.\n\n 33. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as\n extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes\n temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021\n are applicable to those temporary employee like husband of the applicant. So\n also the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to\n (6) cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil\n services and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st\n December, 2003, who retired or were retired before having been appointed in\n a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the\n government servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services\n (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as\n admissible to any other public servant and respondents have violated\n fundamental right enshrined in \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of Constitution of India.\n\n 23 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 34. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years\n service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992\n provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement\n benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed\n by regularization.\n\n 35. The husband of the died on 06.07.2010 in harness as temporary\n employee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge\n their duties and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965\n read with Pension Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of\n pension, family pension and retirement benefits to temporary employee. The\n status of deceased employee was at par with regular employee on long 30 years\n continuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory Rules\nPatna\nBench\n 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy decision.\n Applicant is widow of deceased employee entitled for relief under Rules, 1965.\n\n 36. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it\n clear that applicant who stood retired before having been appointed in a\n substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type of category of\n temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension, retirement gratuity,\n death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to applicant same scale as\n admissible to permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to the extent\n provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:-\n\n (i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation\n after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent\n service of not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of\n continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n 37. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes\n clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021\n (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of\n whereof of the firm view that Government of India, Department of Posts\n instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992\n and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read\n conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial\n legislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered\n service not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes\n\n 24 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the\n part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension\n Rules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers\n the said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state\n as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy\n envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution. The deceased employee is held\n entitled for pension etc. and applicant legal heir-widow entitled for family\n pension under Rules, 1965.\n\n \n38. Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses\n and for no fault the applicant cannot be made to suffer and applicant entitled to\n receive pension/family pension, arrears and other benefits as if applicant\n husband retired from regular establishment and so also held by Hon'ble\nPatna\nBench\n Supreme court in para 36 of judgment in case of \nPrem Singh versus State of\n U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC 516 reproduced herein above.\n\n \n39. The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in\n case of \nUnion of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.\n 154 of 2019 decided\n on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in\n O.A. No. 372/2017 (\nBhikhani Devi Vs Union of India\n) as Tribunal relied on\n ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against\n same.\n \nTheir Lordships in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) observed that\n judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none\n of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that\n there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'\n unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an\n employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be\n admissible.\n\n \n40. The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the\n Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal\n issue dealt in detail rules applicable in case of \nUnion of India and ors\n versus Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar CWJC No.\n 7760 of 2015 decided on\n 08.12.2022, reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 affirming order dated 20.3.2013\n in similar OA No. 164/2008 (Patna) and granted benefits of family pension\n arrears as per Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 and CCS Pension Rules 1972\n widow of employee died as temporary employee without being regularized.\n\n 25 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n \nThis Tribunal has considered the submissions of the counsel for the parties\n and in judgement in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) previous cases not\n referred to the larger bench perused the ratio \nlaid down by\n their Lordships\n in case of \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) decided on 08.12.2022.\n Their Lordships considering scheme for Casual Labourers (Grant of\n Temporary Status and Regularization) and held that husband of the\n applicant being temporary employee governed by CCS TS Rules 1965 and\n as per Rule 10 of CCSTS Rule 1965 read with CCS Pension Rule Their\n Lordships in Para 10 of judgement directed reads as under :-\n\n \"10. Respondent is a legal heir and she is awaiting for certain monetary\n benefits for more than decade, therefore to calculate monetary benefits\n in the light of sub-rule 2 of 10 of Rules 1965 and the same shall be\n extended to the respondents within a period of three months from the\n date of receipt of this order, alongwith interest at the rate of 8% p.a.\n from 01.3.2008 in the light of the fact that respondents husband died on\nPatna\n 15.11.1997 and in the light of Apex Court's decision in the case of Vijay\nBench L. Mehrotra v. State of U.P. (2001)9 SCC 687.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n \n41. Their Lordships in case of Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar , reported\n in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 considered impact effect of scheme dated 30.11.1992\n of Postal Department and also considered Rule 10 of CCS TS Rules 1965\n and applicability of CCS Pension Rules. After considering the proposition of\n law precedent/ratio decidendi has been laid down. This Tribunal is bound\n by the precedent in \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) principle of law\n laid down interpreting service rules applicable in the case. The present case\n is also covered by the above binding-ratio decedendi, precedent.\n \nThe\n preposition of law as laid down considering relevant service rules in \nMeena\n Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) by Hon'ble High Court Patna constitutes\n binding precedent on this Tribunal and present case is also deserves same\n treatment.\n\n \n42. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and legal\n issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding judicial\n pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court\n of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and\n Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present case is no different. This\n Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the case of applicant is a covered\n matter on facts and legal issue involved in the present case and in \nMeena Devi\n @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) and no more res-integra. The applicant is also\n\n 26 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n entitled for the same treatment and consequential benefits envisaged in the\n Fundamental Right under \nArticle 14\n \n& 21\n of Constitution of India guaranteed to\n the applicant too.\n\n 43. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5 of the\n Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit to casual\n labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status of Casual\n Labourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme is crystal\n clear that temporary employee is entitled to pension and retirement benefits, if\n he has completed three years of service in temporary status followed by\n regularization. The husband of the applicant granted temporary status w.e.f.\n 29.11.1989 and not been regularized by respondents in spite of requests and\n died on 06.07.2010 and in 2018 filed the OA.\n\nPatna\nBench\n\n 44. The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants\n are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules\n 1965. As per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued for grant of\n pension, retirement gratuity and in the event of death after retirement,\n members of his family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension read\n with the provisions of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021\n (Erstwhile Rules 1972). The explanation (6) provides appended to Rule 2\n Applicability Clause of the CCS Pension Rules 2021 to the extend these\n rules shall also apply to the case of government servant appointed in\n temporary capacity who retired or were retired before been appointed in a\n substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the\n government servant to the extent provide in the Central Civil Services\n (Temporary Service ) Rules 1965.\n\n 45. The Rule 50-family Pension of CCS Pension Rules 2021 (Erstwhile\n Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia provision in Rule\n 75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants 1964. It is also submitted\n that Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a\n regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari\n Kakkar (supra) has held that it would be travesty of justice if retiree\n denied pensionary benefits simply on ground that he was not a permanent\n employee not regularized after served for 18 ½ years.\n\n 27 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 46. \nIn case of Rameshwari Devi versus Union of India, OA No.36 of 2021\n (CAT Patna Bench) vide order dated 17.01.2022 in case of employee with\n temporary status, placed reliance on judgment of \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n versus Union of India\n, (1996) 7 SCC 113, order of Principal Bench in OA\n No.1287 of 2000. This Tribunal held that applicant's husband served\n continuously as Temporary Status Casual Labour for almost 22 years and not\n been regularized for reasons best known to the employer.\n In O.A. No.143 of\n 2018, (CAT Bench Patna) Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus Union of India &\n Ors. (supra) upheld by Hon'ble High Court of Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024\n vide orders dated 20.06.2024 related to temporary status employee not\n regularized, allowed OA directing respondents to settle pension and all\n pensionary benefits treating his superannuation. This Tribunal in case\n Rameshwari Devi (Supra) vide order dated 17.01.2022 directed respondents to\nPatna\nBench process for issuance of Pension Payment Order. Order dated 17.01.2022 in OA\n No.36/2021, Rameshwari Devi case was challenged in CWJC No.7859 of\n 2022 and Hon'ble High Court, Patna, their Lordships on all arrears amount\n directed to pay interest at rate of 8% in light of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n decision in case of Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of UP, (2001) 9 SCC 687.\n\n 47. Case of Rita Devi versus Union of India, OA No.2630 of 2021 (CAT\n Bench Patna) vide order dated 05.07.2023 in case of deceased employee\n worked continuously more than seventeen years died in harness while\n working as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in\n Postal Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family pension\n etc. \nThis Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008\n (\nMeena Devi vs. Union of India\n) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC\n No.7760 of 2015 (\nUnion of India versus Meena Devi\n) vide judgment dated\n 08.12.2022, Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension,\n family pension.\n Reference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita\n Devi (Supra) was whether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par\n with Group 'D' - without regularization was entitled for pension, family\n pension and benefits this Tribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held\n applicant's husband be treated as regular Group 'D' (MTS) notionally\n from date of grant of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee\n and issue pension, family pension and benefits with arrears.\n\n 28 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 48. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others\n\n O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin with issue -\n whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as Temporary Status\n at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled for pension and other\n retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post\n and applicant did not accept and continued as Temporary Status and retired as\n temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'. Applicant started\n employment as Night Guard on daily basis in Postal Department, conferred\n status of Temporary Status, selected as MTS, did not join denied pension,\n family pension.\n This Tribunal in case Shiv Shankar Sah (Supra) considered\n orders passed in similar facts in OA No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015\n upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on\n part of Postal Department not to regularize the services of husband, private\nPatna\nBench respondent in 23 years of service after having granted temporary status at par\n with Group 'D' employee and conduct of postal department cannot be\n appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978\n of 2017 upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing\n respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under old\n pension scheme.\n\n 49. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above cited judgments observed that as per\n rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on\n regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service\n after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On\n working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'\n employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not\n regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of\n respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise\n meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible\n for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order\n passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not\n regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension. In case of Shiv Chandra Sah\n (Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant\n entitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary\n Status period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on\n 03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service\n\n 29 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n and to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\n Respondents challenged order dated 21.02.2022 in identical case on hand titled\n Shiv Charndra Shah (supra) in CWJC No.1415 of 2023 Union of India vs.\n Shiv Chandra Shah, upheld by Hon'ble High Court, Patna vide order dated\n 22.08.2024.\n\n 50. In case of Ratneshwar Singh versus Union of India, O.A.\n No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue\n applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with temporary\n status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee confirmed at\n part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and claim for pension\n denied that his service not regularized and applicant denied to join on\n regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not\nPatna\nBench\n issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right\n accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule\n 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. So also placed reliance in case OA\n No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of\n 2017 in Ratneshwar Singh (Supra) this Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018,\n allowed OA and directed for fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other\n retiral dues in light of judgment passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and\n CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA\n No.372/2017.\n\n 51. Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India\n & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld this\n Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships\n considered argument of respondents department that contention of department\n cannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be\n construed that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying\n for more than 27 years.\n\n 52. The present case is similar to cases cited herein above and covered by\n above precedents.\n\n 53. In case of Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus Union of India, OA No.143\n of 2018, decided on 28.10.2021 by Division Bench of this Tribunal, Seisin with\n issue to regularize services of Night Guard continuous since 13.01.1984 and\n\n 30 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n Temporary Status conferred but not regularized and denied pension etc. This\n Tribunal vide order dated 28.10.2021 allowed OA to grant pension and all\n pensionary benefits treating his superannuation on 31.10.2019 date of\n retirement and directed for issuance of PPO within four months. \nHon'ble High\n Court, Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024 vide order dated 28.10.2024 affirmed\n order dated 20.10.2021 in \nAwadhesh Prasad Singh\n (supra).\n\n 54. Respondents Department of Posts filed CWJC No.128 of 2024, Union of\n India & Ors. Versus Awadhesh Prasad Singh challenging order dated\n 28.10.2021 in OA No.143 of 2018 and Hon'ble High Court vide order dated\n 08.04.2024, heard at length and observed that prima-facie no case is made out,\n directed respondents to comply directions of the CAT as a last chance and\n affirmed order dated 28.10.2021 in the OA.\n\nPatna\nBench\n\n \n55. This Tribunal in squarely applicable case in hand of the case titled \nNaina\n Devi versus Union of India and others\n, OA No.1109 of 2015 vide order dated\n 24.11.2023 allowed OA. Relevant paragraphs 39 to 48 for ready reference are\n reproduced as under:-\n\n 39. \nIn \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court\n held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½\n years. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary\n benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent\n employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances\n appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the\n government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be\n permanent capacity and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.\n\n 40. \nIn \nKritnarain Singh\n (Supra), \nSmt Ram Kali Devi\n (supra),\n \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra), Division Bench of Hon'ble\n High Court Patna examined core issue involved in present OA and their\n Lordships upheld the orders passed by this Tribunal in same facts and\n law and observed that failure on part of postal department respondents\n not to regularize services of employees serving for long period can not be\n appreciated and directed respondents to extend benefits of pension, family\n pension etc. So also upheld orders of this Tribunal in identical cases.\n\n 41. In Shri Painu Ram (supra) Division Bench of Hon'ble High\n Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla dealing with identical issue on\n similar facts upheld order dated 31.1.2014 passed by coordinate Bench\n Chandigarh of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 426/HP/2013 (Chandigarh)\n granting relief to applicant held entitled for same benefits admissible to\n regular Group 'D' employees once applicant conferred temporary status\n and having three years service on temporary status without being\n regularised.\n\n 42. \nIn case of \nMrs. Alka Sharma\n (supra) Division Bench of\n Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana Their Lordships dealing\n with pari materia provision of Railway Services (Pension) Rule, Rule 75\n of family pension scheme for Railway Servants, 1964. The Hon'ble High\n Court considered that employee was not at fault for such lack of\n regularization and not regularized to deceased employee inspite 14 years\n\n 31 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n temporary service and directed to grant family pension and other retiral\n benefits inspite of not regularized.\n\n 43. \nIn case of \nAwadhesh Prasad Singh\n (supra), Division Bench of\n this Tribunal decided similar issue in light of same scheme of\n Department of Posts seeking pension and other pensioner benefits\n including regularization in terms of Rule 10, CCS (TS) Rules 1965 read\n with CCS Pension Rules and Government of India decisions, department\n of Posts. On examination of Government of India Department of Posts\n Policy dated 30.11.1992, Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)\n Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 1972 held that Temporary\n employee of Central Government becomes entitled to pension, retirement\n gratuity, family pension benefits in cases of retirement from\n superannuation or invalidation after continuous temporary/quashi\n permanent service not less than 10 years, event of voluntary retirement\n after 20 years service and event of death in harness. The OA was allowed\n . Pension and all other benefits were granted treating his superannuation\n on 31.10.2019. The Hon'ble High Court Patna has upheld the order and\n dismissed writ application. The present OA is no different fully covered\n issue no more integra and binding on the Tribunal.\n\n 44. In case of Santosh Kumari (supra) learned Coordinate Bench\n at Chandigarh of this Tribunal decided in October 2023 dealing with\n issue \"whether person who has not been regularized by respondents, the\nPatna\n provision of Rule 54 (2) of the CCS Pension Rule 1972 for grant of\nBench family pension is attracted or not ?\" \nThe learnd Tribunal On examination\n of core legal issue has held that case is fully covered by judgement in\n similar cases of \nAlka Sharma vs Union of India\n, 2017 (2) SCT (P&H)\n (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana also squarely\n covered in case of postal department \nSr. Superintendent of Posts\n Offices vs Painu Ram\n in CWP No. 2299/2014 and Meena Devi in\n CWP No. 34 of 2014 passed by Hon'ble High Court Himachal\n Pradesh.\n\n Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and\n legal issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding\n judicial pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n and High Court of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble\n High Court Patna and Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present\n case is no different. This Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the\n case of applicant is a covered matter on facts and legal issue involved in\n the present case and no more res-integra. The applicant is also entitled for\n the same treatment and consequential benefits envisaged in the\n Fundamental Right under \nArticle 14\n \n& 21\n of Constitution of India\n guaranteed to the applicant too..\n\n 45. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5\n of the Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to\n benefit to casual labourers on completion of three years service in\n temporary status of Casual Labourers (Grant of temporary status and\n regularization) Scheme is crystal clear that temporary employee is entitled\n to pension and retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of\n service in temporary status followed by regularization, The husband of\n applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and not been\n regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for no fault stood\n retired on 30.6.2018 and died on 28.5.2022.\n\n The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants\n are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules\n 1965. As per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued for grant of\n pension, retirement gratuity and in the event of death after retirement,\n members of his family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension\n read with the provisions of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021\n (Erstwhile Rules 1972). The explanation (6) provides appended to Rule\n 2 Applicability Clause of the CCS Pension Rules 2021 to the extend these\n rules shall also apply to the case of government servant appointed in\n temporary capacity who retired or were retired before been appointed in a\n substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the\n\n 32 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n government servant to the extent provide in the Central Civil Services\n (Temporary Service ) Rules 1965.\n\n \nThe Rule 50-family Pension of CCS Pension Rules 2021\n (Erstwhile Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia\n provision in Rule 75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants\n 1964. It is also submitted that Rule for family pension no where provides\n that the individual is to be a regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in case of \nYashwant Hari Kakkar\n (supra) has held that it would\n be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on\n ground that he was not a permanent employee not regularized after served\n for 18 ½ years.\n\n The legal issue in hand also qualified by judicial binding\n precedents pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court, Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana, Hon'ble High Court of\n Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna, their\n Lordships upheld judgements of this Tribunal in identical facts and legal\n issue binding precedents and present case is no different and core issue\n is no more res-integra.\n\n 46. For the above reasons, the issue accordingly decided in the\n favour of the applicant.\n\n 47. In consequences, the deceased employee is held entitled for the\n pension to be computed as per findings supra . The respondents are also\nPatna\n directed to settle the family pension and other retiral benefits of the\nBench deceased employee and pay the arrears of pension and family pension\n from 28.5.2022 onwards with interest @ 8 percent per annum from the\n date of entitlement within three months failing which the interest shall be\n paid @ 9 percent per annum from the date of entitlement till final\n payment\n\n 48. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n \n56. Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar case of \nUnion of India versus\n Ratneshwar Singh, CWJC No.13117\n of 2019 vide judgment dated 03.07.2019\n (Annexure - A/5 with OA) in paragraph 3, their Lordships held - \"These\n letters nowhere indicate that the respondent-petitioner had declined to accept\n regularization. In the said circumstances, the combined offer made by\n petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as regularized was not accepted\n by the respondent-petitioner for his personal letters, but that cannot be\n construed to mean that he had declined regularization on the post he was\n occupying. The continuous occupancy of post remained for 27 years undisputed\n in said background judgment in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 as extracted in\n paragraph 11 of impugned judgment comes to the aid of respondent-\n petitioner.\" In view of law \nlaid down in\n similar facts and contention raised by\n respondents, Ho'ble High Court, Patna their Lordships repelled similar\n contention as raised in case on hand. Arguments of learned counsel for\n respondents has no force no document produced of promotion order and no\n application of refusal and repelled. In view whereof, OA deserves to be\n allowed, with all consequential benefits.\n\n 33 OA No. /050/00163/2018\n\n 57. The legal issue involved in the present case is also qualified by binding\n precedents cited herein above upheld by our own Hon'ble High Court Patna,\n their Lordships upheld orders passed by this Tribunal in identical facts, legal\n issue and binding precedents. This Tribunal is of considered opinion that\n present case is no different and core issue is involved is no more res-integra.\n\n CONCLUSION\n\n 58. For the above reasons, the impugned order dated 23.11.2016 (Annexure\n A-1) and order dated 14.12.2017 (Annexure A-2) are set-aside and the deceased\n employee, the husband of applicant is held entitled for the pension to be\n computed as per findings supra. Respondents are further directed to settle the\n pension, family pension and all other retiral benefits accordingly and pay the\nPatna\nBench\n arrears within period of three months from date of production/receipt of order\n passed today, with interest @8% per annum from date of entitlement failing\n which the interest shall be paid @9% per annum from date of entitlement till\n final payment.\n\n 59. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\n\n 60. Any pending Misc. Application (s), if any, shall also stands disposed of.\n\n 61. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\n\n 62.
