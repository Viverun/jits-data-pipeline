The Applicant had approached the learned Sessions Court seeking\n Anticipatory Bail, however, the same was dismissed vide Order dated\n 01.04.2025.\n\n 5. At the outset, it is submitted that the Applicant is a law abiding citizen\n and has clean antecedents. She is 21 years old and is currently pursuing her\n M.Sc. from IGNOU. It is asserted that she has been wrongly and falsely\n implicated in the present case, being the sister of Pankaj Lamba, the main\n accused who was the husband of the Complainant‟s daughter/Ms. Harshita\n Barela (since deceased).\n\n 6. Pankaj Lamba and Harshita Barela got married on 22.03.2024\n according to Hindu rights and ceremonies, in an arranged marriage. It was\n alleged by the Complainant that the co-accused and his family had subjected\n the Complainant‟s daughter and her family to cruelty and harassment\n connected to dowry demand, even prior to the solemnisation of their\n marriage.\n\n 7. After the marriage, the co-accused moved to the United Kingdom,\n while the Complainant's daughter moved into her matrimonial home in\n Dharoli. She was allegedly subjected to harassment and cruelty, which led\n her to leave the matrimonial home and stay at her parental house.

The Applicant, submits that the FIR does not disclose any allegation\n of cruelty/harassment at the instance of the Applicant \"soon before the\n death\" which resulted the dowry death. The deceased had moved to United\n Kingdom shortly after her marriage and there was thus, no proximate and\n live link between the alleged dowry death and cruelty being meted out\n against the Applicant. Thus, addition of 304B \nIPC\n to the FIR is prima facie\n false and holds no water.\n\n \n10. Reliance has been placed on the case of \nManohar Lal vs. State of\n Haryana\n, (2014) 9 SCC 645 wherein the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that\n \"Facts must show existence of proximate live link between the effect of\n cruelty based on dowry demand and death of victim\".\n\n \n11. Reliance has also been placed \nBalwant Singh and Anr. vs. State of\n Punjab\n, (2004) 7 SCC 724, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that since one\n of the ingredients of the offence under \nSection 304B\n IPC is that cruelty\n should have been meted out to the deceased soon before her death, it is for\n the prosecution to establish affirmatively that the victim was subjected to\n cruelty and harassment based on dowry demand soon before her death.\n\n 12. It is submitted that the Applicant has clean antecedents and she\n undertakes that she will not flee from justice if is admitted to Bail and is\n ready and willing to co-operate with administration of justice.\n\n 13. Furthermore, the grant of Bail is a norm and refusal thereof is\n exception and the Courts should exercise the discretion of Bail judicially and\n the Bail should not be denied to an accused only as a punishment.\n\n 14.
