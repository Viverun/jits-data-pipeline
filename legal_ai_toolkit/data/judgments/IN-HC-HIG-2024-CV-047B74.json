W.P. No.9715/2007 has been filed by petitioner assailing the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n2 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\norder dated 15/11/2006 passed by respondent No.1 whereby respondent\nNo.3 has been promoted to the post of Lecturer treating her to be senior\nto the petitioner.\n\n3. It is the case of petitioner that she was initially appointed on the\npost of Upper Division Teacher in Pandit Motilal Nehru Higher\nSecondary School, Sagar vide order dated 23.09.1983. The Recruitment\nRules relating to recruitment and promotion applicable to the\nGovernment Teachers are adopted for the recruitment and promotion of\nteachers in the schools run by the Municipal Corporation, Sagar. The\nMunicipal Corporation, Sagar is the local authority constituted under the\n\nMadhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956\n. The services of the\npetitioners are government by Madhya Pradesh Non-Gazetted Class-III\nEducation Service (Non-Collegiate Branch) Recruitment and Promotion\nRules, 1973. In terms of the Rules, the post of Upper Division Teacher\nis a class-III post and as per Schedule-III, Column-5, the required\nqualification for the post of Upper Division Teacher was earlier second\ndivision in Bachelor Degree which was subsequently amended on\n16.06.1993 and the required qualification as per amendment is second\nclass in Bachelor Degree and B.Ed. For the post of Upper Division\nTeacher. It is the case of the petitioner that he was appointed prior to the\namendment, therefore, she will be governed by the earlier rules.\nPromotion to the post of Lecturer which is notified as Class-II post is\nregulated by the Recruitment rules known as Madhya Pradesh Education\nService (School Branch) Recruitment & Promotion Rules, 1982. In\nterms of Schedule-I, the Lecturer, Higher Secondary Schools are\nclassified as Class-II post. In terms of Schedule-IV, the Upper Division\nTeacher on completion of five years of service will be promoted to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n3 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\npost of Lecturer, Higher Secondary School. The basis of promotion\nfrom Class-III to Class-II post shall be seniority-cum-suitability. Thus, it\nis clear that for the post of Upper Division Teacher, the essential\nqualification was second class Bachelor Degree prior to 16.06.1993 and\nafter amendment, necessary qualification was second class in Bachelor\nDegree and B.Ed. Petitioner's initial appointment was made as daily\nwage employee on the post of Upper Division Teacher by order dated\n23.09.1983 and was continued on the said post until she was granted\nregular pay-scale on the post of Upper Division Teacher vide order\ndated 24.03.1984. Vide order dated 08.06.1987, petitioner's appointment\nwas approved by the Public Service Commission.\n\n4. It is argued that as the petitioner's appointment was approved by\nthe Public Service Commission and as the appointment of the\nrespondent No.3 was not approved by the Public Service Commission,\ntherefore, respondent No.3 was not eligible to be appointed on the post\nof Upper Division Teacher in the Corporation. Being aggrieved,\nrespondent No.3 preferred a petition being M.P. No.519/1986 which\nwas dismissed observing that she is third division in Higher Secondary\nas well as third Division in Graduation, therefore, she was rightly not\nappointed to the post of Upper Division Teacher. Therefore, she was not\neligible to hold the post of Upper Division Teacher. Her services ought\nto have been counted from the date when the Public Service\nCommission has affirmed her services on the post of Upper Division\nTeacher.\n\n5. It is argued that respondent No.3 has passed the Bachelor degree\nin third division, therefore, she was not entitled to be given appointment\non the post of Upper Division Teacher coupled with the fact that\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n4 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\nappointment of respondent No.3 is not approved by Public Service\nCommission. The appointment of respondent No.3 was as a daily rated\non the post of Upper Division Teacher on 14/09/1983 for a period of 2\nmonths. Thereafter, vide order dated 03/10/1985, she was given\nappointment on the post of Upper Division Teacher on adhoc basis for a\nperiod of six months in pay scale of Rs.740-1180/-. Therefore, it was\nclear that she was not having eligibility to hold the post of Upper\nDivision Teacher. Gross irregularities have been committed by the\nAuthorities in posting the respondent No.3 as Upper Division Teacher.\nPetitioner has been superseded, therefore, she has filed this petition.\n\n6. It is further pointed out that respondent No.3 has filed Writ\nPetition No.1199/1995 claiming salary of the post of Lecturer with\neffect from 01/07/1992. The Division Bench of this Court vide order\ndated 12/11/1986 has directed the respondents to make payment of\nofficiating allowance or salary as she was working on the post of\nLecturer from 01/07/1992 and it was further directed that if the\npetitioner is eligible and qualified to be considered for promotion to the\nsaid post subject to vacancy with respondents for the post of Lecturer,\nshe be considered for promotion by holding D.P.C. In pursuant to the\nsaid order, the Authorities misinterpreted the direction given by the\nCourt and wrongly extended the benefit of promotion on the post of\nLecturer to respondent No.3 de hors the Rules.\n\n7. The minutes of DPC dated 10/05/2006 are placed before the Court\npointing out the fact that against first vacancy of the post of Lecturer\n(Political Science), name of respondent No.3 was recommended\nwhereas, against second vacancy, Mr. B.L. Khare is performing his\nduties. Name of petitioner was kept in waiting list at S.No.1. Petitioner\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n5 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\nhas already been extended the benefit of Kramonnati scale on\ncompletion of 12 years in terms of Rules by order dated 12/12/1997. It\nis argued that as the petitioner is senior to respondent No.3, in all\nfairness, the case of petitioner should have been considered by the\nAuthorities. Even Mr. B.L. Khare, who was working as Lecturer\n(Economics) who was also directed to work as Lecturer (Political\nScience) against the vacant post, has retired on attaining the age of\nsuperannuation on 30/10/2006. Therefore post of Lecturer has fallen\nvacant. The Authorities should have picked up the petitioner from\nwaiting list and should have extended the benefit. Therefore, this\npetition has been filed seeking quashment of promotion of respondent\nNo.3.\n\n8. On being noticed, a reply has been filed by respondent No.1\ndenying all the petition averments. It is pointed out that respondent No.3\nwas initially appointed on 14/09/1983 as Upper Division Teacher. Vide\norder dated 05/02/1987, she was appointed as Upper Division Teacher\nin the pay scale of Rs.575-880/-. Instead of confirming her appointment\non the post of Upper Division Teacher, she was subsequently appointed\nas Upper Division Teacher subject to approval of Public Service\nCommission. Respondent No.3 assailed the orders by filing M.P.\nNo.4863/1989 which was finally decided on 26/07/1991 and the\nDivision Bench of this Court was pleaded to quash the order dated\n04/08/1987 directing the Authorities i.e. Corporation to treat the\nrespondent No.3 (petitioner therein) duly appointed on the post of\nTeacher from the date of her initial appointment and to pay her all the\nremaining benefits. The said order has attained finality as was never\nchallenged before any Forum. The said order is not brought to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n6 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\nknowledge of this Court by filing this petition. In view of the order\npassed by Division Bench of this Court, respondent No.3 was treated as\nUDT from the date of initial appointment. The Corporation has accepted\nthe appointment of respondent No.3 on the post of UDT from the date of\nher initial appointment. Accordingly, the seniority list was prepared and\nrespondent No.3 was placed above petitioner in the seniority list. The\norder dated 12/11/1986 was prior to order dated 05/02/1987, therefore,\nthe Authorities have followed the order passed by Division Bench.\nAgain W.P. No.119/1995 was filed by respondent No.3 which was\ndecided on 22/11/2005 directing the Authorities to consider her case for\npromotion to the post of Lecturer if she is found eligible and qualified to\nbe considered for promotion to the said post subject to vacancy by\nholding DPC. In pursuance of the order, DPC has been constituted on\n10/05/2006 and respondent No.3 was found eligible on the basis of\nseniority/ suitability and her name was recommended for the post of\nLecturer. Name of petitioner was also taken into consideration by DPC\nand after according approval from the State Government, promotion of\nrespondent No.3 was ordered. Therefore, the entire procedure has been\nfollowed by the Authorities and in compliance of judgment passed by\nDivision Bench of this Court, respondent No.3 was found suitable for\ngrant of promotion in the DPC constituted on 10/05/2006. There is no\nchallenge by the petitioner to the seniority list prepared by the\nAuthorities in pursuance to the direction given by Division Bench of\nthis Court wherein the Authorities were directed to treat respondent\nNo.3 as a Teacher from her initial date of appointment, therefore prayed\nfor dismissal of Writ Petition.\n\n9. Respondent No.3 has filed her separate reply denying the petition\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n7 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\naverments and virtually reiterating the contentions made by respondent\nNo.1. Apart from aforesaid, it is further contended that she is having\nqualification of M.A. in Political Science (Second Division), B.Ed. and\nMMA in Philosophy (Second Division) whereas, petitioner is having\nM.A. in Police Science (Third Division) and B.Ed. Hence, respondent\nNo.3 is having higher qualification than the petitioner. There is no\ndispute with respect to initial appointment of respondent No.3 on\n05/02/1987. In stead of confirming her appointment, the Authorities\nhave again appointed her as Upper Division Teacher, therefore she was\nforced to file petition before the Court and Division Bench of this Court\nhas quashed the order dated 04/08/1987 directing the Corporation to\ntreat the petitioner therein i.e. respondent No.3 as duly appointed to the\npost of Teacher from the date of her initial appointment and to pay her\nall monetary benefits arising therefrom. Thereafter the entire exercise\nhas been taken by the Authorities in pursuant to the order passed by\nDivision Bench of this Court. There is no illegality in granting\npromotion to respondent No.3 treating her senior to the petitioner.\n\n10. Rejoinder has been filed by petitioner denying the contentions in\nthe return further contending therein that even if respondent No.3 is\ngiven seniority with effect from the date of adhoc appointment i.e. from\nthe date of her appointment as Upper Division Teacher, she will be\njunior to the petitioner. Therefore, the consideration by the Authorities\nin granting promotion to respondent No.3 is per se illegal.\n\n11. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n\n12. Apart from the admitted position regarding appointment of\npetitioner as well as respondent No.3, record indicates that respondent\nNo.3 filed M.P. No.4863/1989 challenging the order dated 04/08/1987\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n8 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\nissued by the respondents whereby she was appointed as Upper Division\nTeacher on adhoc basis. The said M.P. was finally decided by Division\nBench of this Court on 26/07/1991 holding as under:-\n\n\"4. Learned counsel appearing for the Municipal\nCorporation made a feeble attempt to support the\ncase of the Corp. stating that the petitioner did not\npossess the requisite qualification for the post.\nHaving considered the submissions made by the\ncounsel for the parties we are of the opinion that\nthe petition deserves to succeed. We find\nsubstance in the contention of the petitioner that\nhaving possessed second division in B.Ed. she was\nqualified for the post. We are also of the opinion\nthat even if there was any such qualification\nprescribed in the rules applicable to Govt. teachers,\nwhich were adopted by the Municipal Corporation,\nthe Corporation having continued her for such a\nlong period to work on the post of teacher, the\nqualifications prescribed if any, were impliedly\nrelaxed in her case. The petitioner is entitled to be\nregularised on the post of Upper Division Teacher\non the basis of her long continuance on the post.\nThe respondent/ Corporation could not dispute the\nfact that even after her appointment as Upper\nDivision Clerk she was discharging the duties of a\nteacher in the school.\n\n5. Consequently, the petition is allowed. The\nimpugned orders issued by the Municipal\nCorporation dated 5/2/1987 (Annexure-H) and\ndated 4/8/1987 (Annexure-K) are hereby quashed.\nIt is directed that the Corporation shall treat the\npetitioner as duly appointed to the post of teacher\nwith effect from her initial appointment in the\nCorporation and pay her all monetary benefits\narising therefrom. The petitioner shall also get\ncosts of this petition. Counsel fee Rs.500/-, if\ncertified.\"\n\n13. In pursuance to the order passed by Division Bench of this Court,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n9 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\nan order was passed by the Commissioner on 01/08/1991 treating her\nappointment to be justified and considered her appointment from the\ninitial date of appointment i.e. 14/09/1983. The said order has never\nbeen challenged by the respondents or by the petitioner at any point of\ntime and the same has attained finality. Thereafter, Authorities have\nprepared the seniority list and finding the respondent No.3 to be the\nsenior, she was placed over and above the petitioner. The DPC was\nconstituted and the name of respondent No.3 finds place at S.No.1 in the\nseniority list and petitioner's name finds place at S.No.3 under the\ncategory of UDT. The said list has never been challenged by the\npetitioner. Thereafter, again a Writ Petition has been filed being W.P.\nNo.1199/1995 by respondent No.3 against non-payment of salary of the\npost of Lecturer with effect from 01/07/1992 which was decided on\n22/11/2005 with the following directions:-\n\n\"On careful consideration of the submissions and\nthe pleadings made by the petitioner, I am of the\nview that it is a fit case which requires directions to\nbe given to the respondent to consider the claim of\nthe petitioner for payment of salary or officiating\nallowance to her for the post of lecturer as she is\nworking in the aforesaid post with effect from 1.7.92.\nIn the present case no return has been filed by the\nrespondent and therefore there is no denial before\nthis court about the fact that the petitioner is not\nworking on the post of Lecturer with effect from\n1.7.92. The counsel for the petitioner had not been\nable to point out any order of promotion by which the\npetitioner was appointed to the post of Lecturer but\nhad demonstrated from the time table for the various\nyears which are annexures P-2 and P-3 and on that\nbasis it is clear that the petitioner had been working\non the post of Lecturer.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n10 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\nIn view of the aforesaid, the respondents are\ndirected to consider the grant of officiating allowance\nor salaries to the petitioner as she is working on the\npost of Lecturer from 1.7.92 and further to consider\nher promotion to the post of Lecturer if the petitioner\nis eligible and qualified to be considered for\npromotion to the said post subject to the vacancy\nwith respondent for the post of lecturer by holding a\nDPC. The same may be done within a period of 3\nmonths from the date of producing certified copy of\nthis order to the respondents.\n\nThe petition is disposed of with no order as to\ncosts.\"\n\n14. While disposing of the Writ Petition, apart from granting benefit\nof salary/ officiating allowance of the post of Lecturer, further direction\nwas issued to consider her case for promotion by holding a DPC. The\naforesaid facts are not controverted by the petitioner. Record indicates\nthat petitioner's initial appointment to the post of Upper Division\nTeacher was on 23/09/1983 and the initial appointment of respondent\nNo.3 was on 14/09/1983 i.e. admittedly prior to that of petitioner. The\nrespondent/Corporation has complied with the direction issued by\nDivision Bench of this Court in M.P. No.4863/1989 which is admittedly\nsubsequent to the order dated 12/11/1986 passed by Division Bench of\nthis Court in M.P. No.519/1986. The said petition was regarding her\nappointment to the post in question, wherein observations were made\nthat petitioner is 3rd Class Graduate and 3rd Division in Higher\nSecondary School Examination. Therefore, no relief was granted to her.\nThe fact remains that documents which are being filed along with return\nof respondent No.3 shows that respondent No.3 is M.A. in Political\nScience (Second Division). Thus, the aforesaid averment in that order is\nfactually incorrect. Apart from aforesaid, Division Bench has already\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n11 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\npassed the subsequent order dated 26/07/1991 in M.P. No.4863/1989,\nquashing the order dated 04/08/1987 issued by the Authorities\nconsidering the petitioner as officiating UDT.\n\n15. In absence of any challenge to the seniority list coupled with the\nfact that entire exercise was done by the Corporation in pursuant to the\ndirection given by Division bench, no case for interference is made out\nin this petition. Thus, no relief can be extended to the petitioner.\n\n16. The petition sans merit and is accordingly dismissed. No order as\nto costs.\n\nW.P. No.13741/2016\n\n17. In W.P. No.13741/2016, petitioner has prayed for following\nrelief(s):-\n\n(i) Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to direct\nthe respondents to consider the case of the\npetitioner for promotion to the post of Lecturer\nPolitical Science in the same D.P.C. scheduled\nto be held pursuant to the decision of Mayor-in-\n\nCouncil dated 30.06.2016 and if she is found\nsuitable, the order of promotion may kindly be\ndirected to be issued giving her promotion to the\npost of Lecturer Political Science alongwith all\nconsequential benefits, or alternatively, they\nmay be directed not to consider the case of\npromotion of Smt. Kamlesh Choubey to the post\nof Principal in the D.P.C. till the final disposal\nof W.P. No.9715/2007(S).\n\n(ii) Any other writ, order or direction, which this\nHon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts\nand circumstances of the case, may also kindly\nbe passed, in the interest of justice.\n\n18. The entire case of the petitioner is based upon challenge to the\nappointment of Smt. Kamlesh Choubey as well as her seniority.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n12 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n& W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n19. The fact remains that this Court in connected Writ Petition\nNo.9715/2007 has considered the aspect and has dismissed the Writ\nPetition filed by the petitioner holding that the entire exercise done by\nthe Corporation was in view of the judgment passed by Division Bench\nof this Court. Therefore, no benefit could have been extended to the\npetitioner.\n\n20. Once the respondent No.4 - Smt. Kamlesh Choubey is found to\nbe senior to the petitioner and her name was placed over and above the\npetitioner in seniority list which has never been put to challenge, no\nground for consideration of name of petitioner over and above\nrespondent No.4 is made out. The appointment of petitioner on the post\nof Upper Division Teacher has been upheld by Division Bench of this\nCourt in earlier round of litigation as well as the fact that she has been\nplaced over and above the petitioner, direction to the respondents to\nconsider the name of petitioner in the promotion drive could not have\nbeen done specifically in the circumstances when admittedly respondent\nNo.4's name finds place over and above the petitioner in the seniority\nlist.\n\n21. Therefore, non-consideration of petitioner's name by DPC does\nnot call for any interference in the present petition.\n\n22. The petition sans merit and is accordingly dismissed. No order as\nto costs.\n\n(VISHAL MISHRA)\nJUDGE\nShbhnkr\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11",
