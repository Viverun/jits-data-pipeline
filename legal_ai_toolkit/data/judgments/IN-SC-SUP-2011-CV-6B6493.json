No. 6349 of 2010)\n\nA. Subash Babu ...\n\nPetitioner(s)\n\nVersus\n\nState of A.P.& Anr. ...Respondent(s)\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nJ.M. PANCHAL, J.\n\n1. Leave granted.\n\n2. This appeal by grant of Special Leave, questions the\n\nlegality of Judgment dated 26.02.2010, rendered by\n\nReportable\n\nthe learned Single Judge of the High Court of\n\nJudicature, Andhra Pradesh in Criminal Petition No.\n\n2426 of 2005 by which the prayer made by the\n\nappellant, a Police Officer, to quash the proceeding in\n\nC.C. No. 820 of 1996 initiated for commission of\n\noffences punishable under\nSections 498A\n,\n,\n,\nand\nIPC, has been partly allowed by quashing\n\nproceedings insofar as offence punishable under\n\nSection 498A\nIPC is concerned, whereas the\n\nproceedings relating to the offences punishable under\n\nSections 494\n,\n,\nand\nIPC are ordered to\n\ncontinue against the appellant.\n\n3. The appeal arises in the following circumstances:-\n\nThe respondent no. 2 is the original complainant.\n\nAccording to her, the petitioner who is Sub-Inspector of\n\nPolice, cheated her and her parents by stating that his first\n\nwife had died after delivering two children who are studying\n\nand staying in a hostel, even though his first wife by name\n\nSharda is very much alive and living with him at\n\nReportable\n\nAvanthinagar near Erragadda and thus by making false and\n\nfraudulent representation, the appellant married with her at\n\nYadagirigutta on 09.10.1994. The case of the respondent no.\n\n2 is that the appellant had collected total amount of\n\nRs.28,000/- from her father towards hand loan on the false\n\nplea that he was constructing his own house at Borabanda\n\nand the appellant further demanded a sum of Rs.20,000/-\n\nfrom her father and when her father expressed inability to\n\npay the amount, the appellant threatened the complainant\n\nand her father with dire consequences by showing his\n\nlicensed revolver. According to the complainant, several\n\ntimes the appellant had tried to snatch away gold ornaments\n\nput on by her by threatening her with dire consequences and\n\nhad demanded gold ornaments together with cash of\n\nRs.15,000/- from her parents. The case of the respondent\n\nno. 2 is that when additional demand was not fulfilled the\n\nappellant had threatened her and her father again by saying\n\nthat he would wipe out the evidence of his marriage with the\n\ncomplainant which had taken place at Yadagirigutta by\n\ndestroying all the photographs and negatives and would walk\n\nReportable\n\nout of her life. Thus feeling aggrieved by the acts of the\n\nappellant in cheating her, committing bigamy and meting out\n\ncruelty to her for dowry, etc., the respondent no. 2 lodged\n\nFIR dated 26.05.1995 with Ranga Reddy Police Station,\n\nBalanagar and prayed to take appropriate action against the\n\nappellant for alleged commission of offences under\nSections\n\n498A\nand\nIPC.\n\n4. The Investigating Officer, investigated the FIR lodged by\n\nthe respondent no. 2 and submitted charge sheet in the\n\nCourt of learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Hyderabad,\n\nWest and South Court, R.R.District at Kothapet, Sarunagar\n\nfor commission of offences punishable under\nSections 494\n,\n,\n,\nand\n498A\nIPC. On receipt of the charge sheet\n\nthe learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offences and\n\nsummoned the appellant. The record shows that earlier\n\nCriminal Petition No. 812 of 2001 was filed by the appellant\n\nbefore the High Court to quash the proceedings initiated\n\npursuant to C.C. No. 820 of 1996 pending on the file of the\n\nlearned Judicial Magistrate. However, the said petition was\n\nReportable\n\nwithdrawn by the appellant and therefore the petition was\n\ndismissed by the High Court vide order dated 09.04.2005\n\nreserving liberty to the appellant to file a fresh petition in\n\ncase of necessity. After few days thereof, the appellant\n\nfiled Criminal Petition No. 2426 of 2005 in the High Court for\n\nquashing the proceedings in the Criminal Case pending\n\nbefore the learned Magistrate. The record does not indicate\n\nas to why Criminal Petition No. 812 of 2001 filed by the\n\nappellant in which similar reliefs as claimed in Criminal\n\nPetition No. 2426 of 2005, were claimed, was withdrawn and\n\nwhich were the new/additional circumstances/grounds\n\nwhich prompted the appellant to file Criminal Petition No.\n\n2426 of 2005. The said petition was filed mainly on the\n\nground that the proceedings against the appellant were\n\nregistered for commission of above mentioned offences on the\n\nbasis of charge sheet submitted by the Sub-Inspector of\n\nPolice, Women Police Station, Amberpet, R.R. District and\n\nnot on the basis of complaint made by the aggrieved person\n\nwithin the meaning of\nSection 198\nof the Code. According to\n\nthe appellant the person aggrieved by alleged commission of\n\nReportable\n\noffences under\nSections 494\nand\nis his wife and\n\ncognizance of those offences could have been taken only on\n\nthe basis of the complaint filed by his wife in the Court or by\n\nsomeone on her behalf as contemplated by Section 198A\n\n(1)(c) of the Code, and therefore, the learned Magistrate could\n\nnot have taken cognizance of those offences on the basis of\n\nsubmission of charge sheet by Sub-Inspector of Police on the\n\nbasis of the investigation into the FIR lodged by the\n\nrespondent No. 2 who is not the aggrieved person within the\n\nmeaning of\nSection 198\nof the Code. It was pleaded that\n\nthere was no averment that pursuant to deception or\n\nfraudulent or dishonest inducement made by the appellant,\n\nthere was any delivery or destruction of property belonging to\n\nthe original complainant and therefore\nSection 420\nIPC was\n\nnot attracted. It was the case of the appellant that the\n\nprovision of\nSection 498A\nwas also not attracted because the\n\nrespondent no. 2 was not the wife of the appellant. It was\n\nalso the case of the appellant that\nSection 417\nIPC merged\n\ninto offence under\nSection 495\nIPC which is a graver offence\n\nthan\nSection 417\nand as there were no allegations\n\nReportable\n\nconstituting offence under\nSection 417\nIPC, the proceedings\n\ninitiated for alleged commission of the offences should be\n\nquashed.\n\n5. The High Court considered the submissions advanced\n\nat the Bar as well as the provisions of\nSections 198(1)(c)\nof\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure,\nSection 494\nand\nIPC\n\nand the Judgment of Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High\n\nCourt in Mavuri Rani Veera Bhadranna Vs. State of A.P.\n\nand Anr. 2007 (1) ALD (Crl.) 13 (A.P.) and concluded that\n\nthe Division Bench in Mavuri Rani Veera Bhadranna\n\n(supra) had taken note of the fact that the offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 494\nIPC as amended by the State\n\nof Andhra Pradesh was made cognizable, and though there\n\nwas no corresponding amendment to\nSection 198\nof the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code, the investigating agency was\n\nentitled to investigate, and the Magistrate was not precluded\n\nfrom taking cognizance of the said offence on report filed by\n\nthe police. Having so concluded the Division Bench\n\nproceeded to quote part of the Judgment in Mavuri Rani\n\nReportable\n\nVeera Bhadranna (supra) and after noting contentions on\n\nbehalf of the parties proceeded to consider the decision in the\n\ncase of S.Radhika Sameena Vs. Station House Officer,\n\n1997 Criminal Law Journal 1655 and held that the\n\ndecision of the Division Bench in Mavuri Rani Veera\n\nBhadranna (supra) was holding the field with regard to\n\ncompetency of the police to file charge sheet and competency\n\nof the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offences\n\npunishable under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC on the report\n\nfiled by the police. The High Court further concluded that\n\ntaking cognizance of the offences punishable under\nSections\n,\n,\nand\nIPC was in accordance with law, but\n\nthe victim i.e. the respondent no. 2 in the present case was\n\nsecond wife and therefore prima facie marriage between\n\nappellant and the second respondent was void and therefore,\n\noffence under\nSection 498A\nIPC was not made out against\n\nthe appellant.\n\n6. In view of the above mentioned conclusions, the learned\n\nSingle Judge of the High Court by the impugned Judgment\n\nReportable\n\npartly accepted the petition filed by the appellant under\n\nSection 482\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure by quashing\n\nthe proceedings in C.C.No. 820 of 1996 on the file of the\n\nlearned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, West and South,\n\nKothapet, R.R.District, insofar as offence punishable under\n\nSection 498A\nIPC is concerned, whereas the prayer made by\n\nthe appellant to quash the proceedings insofar as the\n\noffences punishable under\nSections 494\n,\n,\nand\nIPC, are concerned, is rejected, giving rise to the instant\n\nappeal.\n\n7. The learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the\n\nlearned Magistrate could not have taken cognizance of\n\noffences under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC on the basis of the\n\npolice report submitted by the Investigating Officer because\n\nthough the State legislation amended the First Schedule to\n\nthe\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 by making the offences\n\nunder\nSection 494\nad 495\nIPC\ncognizable, the legislation\n\nmade by the Parliament in respect of\nSection 198\nof the Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure remained the same and in the event of\n\nReportable\n\nany repugnancy between the two legislations, the legislation\n\nmade by the Parliament would prevail. It was emphasized\n\nthat Section 198 A inserted by Section 5 of the Act 46 of\n\n1983 with effect from 25.12.83 provides that no Court shall\n\ntake cognizance of an offence punishable under\nSection 498A\n\nof the Indian Penal Code except upon a police report of facts\n\nwhich constitute such offences or upon a complaint made by\n\nthe person aggrieved by the offence or by her father, mother,\n\nbrother, sister or by her father's, her mother's, brother or\n\nsister or with the leave of the Court by any other person\n\nrelated to her by blood, marriage or adoption, but no\n\nprovision is made to enable a court to take cognizance of\n\noffences punishable under\nSections 494\nand\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code upon police report and therefore the\n\nproceedings pending before the learned Magistrate in respect\n\nof those offences should have been quashed. Referring to\n\nSection 198(1)(c)\nwhich inter alia provides that no Court\n\nshall take cognizance of an offence punishable under\n\nChapter XX of the\nIndian Penal Code\nexcept upon a\n\ncomplaint made by a person aggrieved, where the person\n\nReportable\n\naggrieved by an offence punishable under\nSection 494\nor\n\nSection 495\nof the Indian Penal Code, is the wife etc., it was\n\npleaded that in the instant case no complaint was made to\n\nthe Court but was made to the police and on the basis of\n\ncharge sheet, the Magistrate had taken cognizance of the\n\noffences which is contrary to\nSection 198\nof the Code and is\n\nillegal. What was asserted was that the High Court failed to\n\nnotice that under\nSection 198(1)(c)\nof the Criminal Procedure\n\nCode only a legally wedded wife or someone on her behalf as\n\nmentioned in the said Section can make a complaint to\n\nMagistrate for the offences under\nSection 494\nand\nIPC\n\nand as admittedly the complaint was made by the\n\nrespondent no. 2 who is claiming to be second wife of the\n\nappellant herein and that too to the police and not in the\n\nCourt, the proceedings initiated for alleged commission of\n\nthose offences should have been quashed. In support of\n\nabove stated contentions, the learned Counsel for the\n\npetitioner placed reliance on the decision in Mavuri Rani\n\nVeera Bhadranna (Supra).\n\nReportable\n\n8. On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the\n\nrespondents argued that by Code of Criminal Procedure\n\n(Andhra Pradesh Second Amendment) Act, 1992, the offences\n\nunder\nSections 494\nand\nhave been made cognizable in\n\nthe State of Andhra Pradesh, and therefore the respondent\n\nNo. 2 who is aggrieved person so far as commission of\n\noffences punishable under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC are\n\nconcerned, was justified in lodging FIR with the police and\n\nthe police after investigation, was justified in submitting\n\ncharge sheet on the basis of which proceedings are pending\n\nbefore the learned Magistrate in respect of alleged\n\ncommission of offences by the appellant under\nSection 494\n,\n,\n,\nand\n498A\nIPC. The contention by the learned\n\nCounsel for the respondents was that 198(1)(c) of the\nCode of\n\nCriminal Procedure\nwill have to be read in the light of the\n\namendment made in the Code by the State Legislature and\n\ntherefore the learned Magistrate did not commit any error in\n\ntaking cognizance of the offences on the basis of charge sheet\n\nsubmitted by the Investigating Officer.\n\nReportable\n\n9. This Court has heard the learned Counsel for the\n\nparties at length and also considered the documents forming\n\npart of the appeal.\n\n10. The contention that the respondent no. 2 is not an\n\naggrieved person so far as commission of offences punishable\n\nunder\nSections 494\nand\nIPC is concerned, has no\n\nsubstance and cannot be accepted.\nSection 494\nof IPC reads\n\nas under:-\n\n\"Whoever, having a husband or wife living,\n\nmarries in any case in which such marriage is\n\nvoid by reason of its taking place during the\n\nlife of such husband or wife, shall be punished\n\nwith imprisonment of either description for a\n\nterm which may extend to seven years, and\n\nshall also be liable to fine.\"\n\nWhereas\nSection 495\nof the IPC is as follows:-\n\n\"Whoever commits the offence defined in the\n\nlast preceding section having concealed from\n\nthe person with whom the subsequent\n\nmarriage is contracted, the fact of the former\n\nmarriage, shall be punished with\n\nimprisonment of either description for a term\n\nwhich may extend to ten years, and shall also\n\nbe liable to fine.\"\n\nReportable\n\nAs far as\nSection 494\nIPC is concerned, the criminality\n\nattaches to the act of second marriage either by a husband\n\nor by a wife who has a living wife or husband, in a case in\n\nwhich second marriage is void by reason of its taking place\n\nduring the life of such husband or wife. When a law, such as\n\nSection 11\nof Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 declares that a\n\nsecond marriage by a husband, who has living wife, with\n\nanother woman is void, for breach of\nSection 5 (i)\nof the said\n\nAct, it brings/attaches several legal disabilities to the woman\n\nwith whom second marriage is performed. Say for example,\n\nshe would not be entitled to claim maintenance from her\n\nhusband even if she is inhumanly treated, subjected to\n\nmental and physical cruelty of variety of kinds etc. and is not\n\nable to maintain herself. Law of inheritance would\n\nprejudicially operate against her. She herself would suffer\n\noutrageous, wrong and absurd social stigma of being another\n\nwoman in the life of the male who contracts second marriage\n\nwith her. The members of the cruel society including her\n\nkith and kin like parents, brother, sister etc. would look\n\ndown upon her and she would be left in lurch by one and all.\n\nReportable\n\nWhen a Court of law declares second marriage to be void on\n\na petition presented by husband who contracts the second\n\nmarriage on the ground that he has a spouse living at the\n\ntime of marriage, it only brings untold hardships and\n\nmiseries in the life of the woman with whom second marriage\n\nis performed apart from shattering her ambition to live a\n\ncomfortable life after marriage.\n\nHaving noticed the agony, trauma etc. which would be\n\nsuffered by the woman with whom second marriage is\n\nperformed, if the marriage is declared to be void, let us make\n\nan attempt to ascertain the purpose of enacting\nSection 494\n\nIPC. This Section introduces monogamy which is essentially\n\nvoluntary union of life of one man with one woman to the\n\nexclusion of all others. It enacts that neither party must\n\nhave a spouse living at the time of marriage. Polygamy was\n\npracticed in many sections of Hindu society in ancient times.\n\nIt is not a matter of long past that in India, hypergamy\n\nbrought forth wholesale polygamy and along with it misery,\n\nplight and ignominy to woman having no parallel in the\n\nworld. In post vedic India a King could take and generally\n\nReportable\n\nused to have more than one wife.\nSection 4\n, of Hindu\n\nMarriage Act nullifies and supersedes such practice all over\n\nIndia among the Hindus. Section 494 is intended to achieve\n\nlaudable object of monogamy. This object can be achieved\n\nonly by expanding the meaning of the phrase \"aggrieved\n\nperson\". For variety of reasons the first wife may not choose\n\nto file complaint against her husband e.g. when she is\n\nassured of re-union by her husband, when husband\n\nassures to snap the tie of second marriage etc. Non-filing of\n\nthe complaint under\nSection 494\nIPC by first wife does not\n\nmean that the offence is wiped out and monogamy sought to\n\nbe achieved by means of\nSection 494\nIPC merely remains in\n\nstatute book. Having regard to the scope, purpose, context\n\nand object of enacting\nSection 494\nIPC and also the\n\nprevailing practices in the society sought to be curbed by\n\nSection 494\nIPC, there is no manner of doubt that the\n\ncomplainant should be an aggrieved person.\nSection\n\n198(1)(c)\nof the Criminal Procedure Code, amongst other\n\nthings, provides that where the person aggrieved by an\n\noffence under Section 494 or\nSection 495\nIPC is the wife,\n\nReportable\n\ncomplaint on her behalf may also be filed by her father,\n\nmother, sister, son, daughter etc. or with the leave of the\n\nCourt, by any other person related to her by blood, marriage\n\nor adoption.\nIn\nGopal Lal Vs. State of Rajasthan\n(1979) 2\n\nSCC 170 this Court has ruled that in order to attract the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 494\nIPC both the marriages of the\n\naccused must be valid in the sense that the necessary\n\nceremonies required by the personal law governing the\n\nparties must have been duly performed. Though\nSection 11\n\nof the Hindu Marriage Act provides that any marriage\n\nsolemnized, if it contravenes the conditions specified in\n\nClause (i) of\nSection 5\nof the said Act, shall be null and void,\n\nit also provides that such marriage may on a petition\n\npresented by either party thereto, be so declared. Though\n\nthe law specifically does not cast obligation on either party to\n\nseek declaration of nullity of marriage and it may be open to\n\nthe parties even without recourse to the Court to treat the\n\nmarriage as a nullity, such a course is neither prudent nor\n\nintended and a declaration in terms of\nSection 11\nof the\n\nHindu Marriage Act will have to be asked for, for the purpose\n\nReportable\n\nof precaution and/or record. Therefore, until the declaration\n\ncontemplated by\nSection 11\nof the Hindu Marriage Act is\n\nmade by a competent Court, the woman with whom second\n\nmarriage is solemnized continues to be the wife within the\n\nmeaning of\nSection 494\nIPC and would be entitled to\n\nmaintain a complaint against her husband.\n\nEven otherwise, as explained earlier, she suffers several\n\nlegal wrongs and/or legal injuries when second marriage is\n\ntreated as a nullity by the husband arbitrarily, without\n\nrecourse to the Court or where declaration sought is granted\n\nby a competent Court. The expression \"aggrieved person\"\n\ndenotes an elastic and an elusive concept. It cannot be\n\nconfined within the bounds of a rigid, exact and\n\ncomprehensive definition. Its scope and meaning depends on\n\ndiverse, variable factors such as the content and intent of the\n\nstatute of which contravention is alleged, the specific\n\ncircumstances of the case, the nature and extent of\n\ncomplainant's interest and the nature and the extent of the\n\nprejudice or injury suffered by the complainant. Section 494\n\ndoes not restrict right of filing complaint to the first wife and\n\nReportable\n\nthere is no reason to read the said Section in a restricted\n\nmanner as is suggested by the learned Counsel for the\n\nappellant. Section 494 does not say that the complaint for\n\ncommission of offence under the said section can be filed\n\nonly by wife living and not by the woman with whom\n\nsubsequent marriage takes place during the life time of the\n\nwife living and which marriage is void by reason of its taking\n\nplace during the life of such wife. The complaint can also be\n\nfiled by the person with whom second marriage takes place\n\nwhich is void by reason of its taking place during the life of\n\nfirst wife.\n\nA bare reading of the complaint together with statutory\n\nprovisions makes it abundantly clear that the appellant\n\nhaving a wife living, married with the respondent no. 2\n\nherein by concealing from her the fact of former marriage\n\nand therefore her complaint against the appellant for\n\ncommission of offence punishable under\nSection 494\nand\nIPC is, maintainable and cannot be quashed on this\n\nground.\n\nReportable\n\nTo hold that a woman with whom second marriage is\n\nperformed is not entitled to maintain a complaint under\n\nSection 494\nIPC though she suffers legal injuries would be\n\nheight of perversity.\n\n11.\nSection 495\nIPC provides that if a person committing\n\nthe offence defined in\nSection 494\nIPC conceals from the\n\nperson with whom subsequent marriage is contracted, the\n\nfact of the former marriage, the said person is liable to\n\npunished as provided therein. The offence mentioned in\n\nSection 495\nIPC is an aggravated form of bigamy provided in\n\nSection 494\nIPC. The circumstance of aggravation is the\n\nconcealment of the fact of the former marriage to the person\n\nwith whom the second marriage is contracted. Since the\n\noffence under\nSection 495\nIPC is in essence bigamy, it follows\n\nthat all the elements necessary to constitute that offence\n\nmust be present here also. A married man who by passing\n\nhimself off as unmarried induces an innocent woman to\n\nbecome, as she thinks his wife, but in reality his mistress,\n\ncommits one of the grossest forms of frauds known to law\n\nReportable\n\nand therefore severe punishment is provided in\nSection 495\n\nIPC. Section 495 begins with the words \"whoever commits\n\nthe offence defined in the last preceding Section........\" The\n\nreference to\nSection 494\nIPC in\nSection 495\nIPC makes it\n\nclear that\nSection 495\nIPC is extension of\nSection 494\nIPC\n\nand part and parcel of it. The concealment spoken of in\n\nSection 495\nIPC would be from the woman with whom the\n\nsubsequent marriage is performed. Therefore, the wife with\n\nwhom the subsequent marriage is contracted after\n\nconcealment of former marriage, would also be entitled to\n\nlodge complaint for commission of offence punishable under\n\nSection 495\nIPC. Where second wife alleges that the accused\n\nhusband had married her according to Hindu rites despite\n\nthe fact that he was already married to another lady and the\n\nfactum of the first marriage was concealed from her, the\n\nsecond wife would be an aggrieved person within the\n\nmeaning of Section 198 Cr. P.C. If the woman with whom\n\nthe second marriage is performed by concealment of former\n\nmarriage is entitled to file a complaint for commission of\n\noffence under\nSection 495\nIPC, there is no reason why she\n\nReportable\n\nwould not be entitled to file complaint under\nSection 494\nIPC\n\nmore particularly when\nSection 495\nIPC is extension and\n\npart and parcel of\nSection 494\nIPC.\n\nFor all these reasons, it is held that the woman with\n\nwhom second marriage is contracted by suppressing the fact\n\nof former marriage would be entitled to maintain complaint\n\nagainst her husband under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC.\n\n12. The argument that the learned Magistrate could not\n\nhave taken cognizance of offence punishable under\nSections\nand\nIPC on the basis of the police report i.e. charge\n\nsheet, as those offences are non- cognizable and therefore,\n\nthe relief claimed in the petition filed before the High Court\n\nunder Section 482 of the Code should have been granted is\n\ndevoid of merits.\n\n13. In this regard, it would be, relevant to notice the\n\nprovisions of\nArticle 246\nof the Constitution.\nArticle 246\n\ndeals with subject matter of laws made by the Parliament\n\nReportable\n\nand by the legislatures of State. Clause (1) of\nArticle 246\ninter\n\nalia provides that notwithstanding anything contained in\n\nClauses (2) and (3) of\nArticle 246\n, the Parliament has\n\nexclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the\n\nmaters enumerated in List 1 in the Seventh Schedule. Sub-\n\nClause 2 of the said Article provides that notwithstanding\n\nanything in Clause (3), Parliament and subject to Clause (1),\n\nthe legislature of any State also have power to make laws\n\nwith respect to any of the matters enumerated in List 3 in\n\nthe Seventh Schedule, whereas, Clause (3) of\nArticle 246\n\namongst other things provides that subject to Clauses (1)\n\nand (2), the legislature of any State has exclusive power to\n\nmake laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to\n\nany of the matters enumerated in List 2 in the Seventh\n\nSchedule. Entry 2 in List 3 i.e. Concurrent List in the\n\nSeventh Schedule mentions \"Criminal Procedure, including\n\nin matters included in the Code of \"Criminal procedure, at\n\nthe commencement of this Constitution\". Thus there is no\n\nmanner of doubt that Parliament and subject to Clause (1),\n\nthe legislature of any State also has power to make laws with\n\nReportable\n\nrespect to\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n.\nSection 2(c)\nof the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 defines the phrase\n\n\"Cognizable Offence\" to mean an offence for which and\n\n\"Cognizable Case\" means a case in which, a Police Officer\n\nmay, in accordance with the First Schedule or under any\n\nother law for the time being in force arrest without warrant.\n\nPart I of the First Schedule to the\nCode of Criminal\n\nProcedure\n, 1973 relating to offences under the\nIndian Penal\n\nCode\ninter alia mentions that Section 494 and 495 are non-\n\ncognizable.\nSection 154\nof the Criminal Procedure Code\n\nrelates to information in cognizable cases and provides inter\n\nalia that every information relating to the commission of a\n\ncognizable offence, if given orally to an Officer in charge of a\n\nPolice Station, shall be reduced to writing by him and be\n\nread over to the informant. Section 156 of the Code provides\n\nthat any Officer in charge of a Police Station may, without\n\nthe order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case\n\nwhich a Court having jurisdiction over a local area within the\n\nlimits of such station would have power to enquire into or try\n\nunder provisions of Chapter XIII of\nCriminal Procedure Code\n.\n\nReportable\n\nAs Sections 494 and 495 are made non-cognizable, a Police\n\nOfficer would not have power to investigate those cases\n\nwithout the order of a Magistrate, having a power to try such\n\ncases or commit such cases for trial as provided under\n\nSection 155(2) of the Code.\n\nHowever, this Court finds that the Legislative Assembly\n\nof the State of Andhra Pradesh enacted the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure (Andhra Pradesh Second Amendment) Act, 1992.\n\nBy the said Amending Act, the First Schedule to Central Act\n\n2 of 1974 i.e. the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 came to\n\nbe amended and against the entries relating to Section 494\n\nin column 4 for the word \"Ditto\", the word \"Cognizable\" and\n\nin column 5 for the word \"Bailable\" the word \"Non-bailable\"\n\nwere substituted. Similarly, against the entries relating to\n\nSection 495 in column 4, for the word \"Ditto\" the word\n\n\"Cognizable\" and in column 5 for the word \"Ditto\", the word\n\n\"Non-bailable\" were substituted. What is relevant to be\n\nnoticed is that the Code of Criminal Procedure (Andhra\n\nPradesh Second Amendment) Act, 1992 was reserved by the\n\nGovernor of Andhra Pradesh on the 21st October, 1991 for\n\nReportable\n\nconsideration and assent of the President. The Presidential\n\nassent was received on 10th February, 1992 after which the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure (Andhra Pradesh Second\n\nAmendment) Act, 1992 was published on the 15th February,\n\n1992 in the Andhra Pradesh Gazette Part IV-B (Ext.). Thus\n\nthere is no manner of doubt that\nSections 494\nand\nIPC\n\nare cognizable offences so far as State of Andhra Pradesh is\n\nconcerned.\n\n14. Having noticed the amendment made by the Legislative\n\nAssembly of the State of Andhra Pradesh regarding\nSection\nand\nIPC, this Court proposes to consider the effect\n\nof assent given by the President on 10th February, 1992 to\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure (Andhra Pradesh Second\n\nAmendment) Act, 1992.\nArticle 254\nof the Constitution reads\n\nas under:-\n\n\"254 Inconsistency between laws made by\n\nParliament and laws made by the\n\nLegislatures of States:-\n\n(1) If any provision of a law made by the\n\nLegislature of a State is repugnant to any\n\nprovision of a law made by Parliament which\n\nParliament is competent to enact, or to any\n\nReportable\n\nprovision of an existing law with respect to\n\none of the matters enumerated in the\n\nConcurrent List, then, subject to the\n\nprovisions of clause (2), the law made by\n\nParliament, whether passed before or after\n\nthe law made by the Legislature of such\n\nState, or, as the case may be, the existing\n\nlaw, shall prevail and the law made by the\n\nLegislature of the State shall, to the extent of\n\nthe repugnancy, be void.\n\n(2) Where a law made by the Legislature of\n\na State with respect to one of the matters\n\nenumerated in the Concurrent List contains\n\nany provision repugnant to the provisions of\n\nan earlier law made by Parliament or an\n\nexisting law with respect to that matter, then,\n\nthe law so made by the Legislature of such\n\nState shall, if it has bee reserved for the\n\nconsideration of the President and has\n\nreceived his assent, prevail in that State.\n\nProvided that nothing in this clause shall prevent\n\nParliament from enacting a law adding to, amending, varying\n\nor repealing the law made by the legislature of the State\".\n\nThere is no manner of doubt that\nAmending Act\nof 1992\n\nis on the subject which is already in existence in the\nCode of\n\nCriminal Procedure\n, 1973. However, in view of Clause (2) of\n\nArticle 254\nof the Constitution, an undoubted power to\n\nlegislate, of course subject to assent of the President on the\n\nReportable\n\nsubject already in existence, is available to the State\n\nLegislature. Clause (1) of\nArticle 254\nis operative subject to\n\nprovisions of Clause (2). If a law passes a test of Clause (2),\n\nit will make Clause (1) inapplicable to it. To the general rule\n\nlaid down in Clause (1), Clause (2) engrafts an exception, viz.,\n\nthat if the President assents to a State Law which has been\n\nreserved for his consideration as required by\nArticle 200\n, it\n\nwill prevail notwithstanding its repugnancy to an earlier law\n\nof Union. Clause (2) provides for curing of repugnancy which\n\nwould otherwise invalidate a State law which is inconsistent\n\nwith a Central law or an existing law. The clause provides\n\nthat where the State law has been reserved for the\n\nconsideration of the President and has received his assent,\n\nthe State law would prevail in the particular State\n\nnotwithstanding its repugnancy to a Central law or an\n\nexisting law. Clause (2) comes into play only when (1) the\n\ntwo laws in question deal with a matter in Concurrent List (2)\n\nthe State law has been made with the consent of the\n\nPresident and (3) the provision of law made by Parliament\n\nwas earlier. When all these three conditions are satisfied,\n\nReportable\n\nthe law made by the State Legislature will prevail. Where\n\nthere is inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and\n\nlaws made by the State Legislature, the law made by the\n\nParliament shall prevail. If the State makes law enumerated\n\nin Concurrent List which contains provisions repugnant to\n\nthe provision of an earlier law made by the Parliament, the\n\nlaw so made by the State if it receives assent of President will\n\nprevail in the State. When the State Act prevails under\n\nArticle 254(2)\nover a Central Act, the effect is merely to\n\nsupersede the Central Act or to eclipse it by the State Act. In\n\nshort, the result of obtaining the assent of the President to a\n\nState Act which is inconsistent with a previous Union Law\n\nrelating to a concurrent subject would be that the State Act\n\nwill prevail in that State and overrule the provisions of the\n\nCentral Act, in that State.\n\nIn view of the above settled legal position, this Court\n\nhas no doubt that the amendment made in the First\n\nSchedule to the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 by the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure (Andhra Pradesh Second\n\nAmendment) Act, 1992, shall prevail in the State of Andhra\n\nReportable\n\nPradesh, notwithstanding the fact that in the\nCriminal\n\nProcedure Code\n, 1973 offences under Section 494 and 495\n\nare treated as cognizable offences. The reasoning given by\n\nthe Division Bench of High Court of Andhra Pradesh in\n\nMavuri Rani Veera Bhadranna (supra) that though the\n\nState Legislation amended the Schedule making the offence\n\nunder\nSection 494\nIPC cognizable, the legislation made by\n\nthe Parliament i.e.\nSection 198\nof the Criminal Procedure\n\nCode remains and in the event of any repugnancy between\n\nthe two legislations, the legislation made by the Parliament\n\nwould prevail, because,\nSection 198\nof the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code still holds the field despite the fact that the\n\nState Legislation made amendment to the Schedule of\n\nCriminal Procedure Code\n, with respect, is erroneous and\n\ncontrary to all cannons of interpretation of statute. Once\n\nFirst Schedule to the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973\n\nstands amended and offences punishable under\nSections 494\n\nand\nIPC are made cognizable offences, those offences will\n\nhave to be regarded as cognizable offences for all purposes of\n\nthe\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 including for the\n\nReportable\n\npurpose of\nSection 198\nof the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nSection 198(1)(c), after the Amendment made by the\nCode of\n\nCriminal Procedure\n(Andhra Pradesh Second Amendment)\n\nAct, 1992 cannot be interpreted in isolation without referring\n\nto the fact that offences under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC\n\nhave been made cognizable so far as the State of Andhra\n\nPradesh is concerned. Therefore, the provision made in\n\nSection 198(1)(c) that no Court shall take cognizance of an\n\noffences punishable under Chapter XX of the\nIPC\nexcept\n\nupon a complaint made by some person aggrieved will have\n\nto be read subject to the amendment made by the Legislative\n\nAssembly of the State of Andhra Pradesh in 1992. Once, it is\n\nheld that the offences under\nSection 494\nand\nIPC are\n\ncognizable offences, the bar imposed by operative part of\n\nsub-\nsection 1\nof\nSection 198\nof the Criminal Procedure Code\n\nbeginning with the words \"No Court shall take cognizance of\n\nan offence punishable under Chapter XX of the\nIndian Penal\n\nCode\nexcept upon a complaint made by some person\n\naggrieved by the offence\" gets lifted so far as offences\n\npunishable under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC are concerned.\n\nReportable\n\nAs those offences have been made cognizable offences in the\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh since 1992, the same will have to be\n\ndealt with as provided in the Section 156 which inter alia\n\nprovides that any officer in charge of a Police Station, may\n\nwithout the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable\n\ncase which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area\n\nwithin the limits of such station would have power to enquire\n\ninto or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII. Even\n\nwithout the authorization under Section 155(2) or Section\n\n156(3) of Criminal Penal Code, offences under Sections 494,\n\n495 and 496 having been rendered cognizable and non-\n\nbailable by virtue of the Criminal Procedure Code\n\n(Amendment Act, 1992) can be investigated by the Police and\n\nno illegality is attached to the investigation of these offences\n\nby the police. If the Police Officer in charge of a Police\n\nStation is entitled to investigate offences punishable under\n\nSection 494\nand\nIPC, there is no manner of doubt that\n\nthe competent Court would have all jurisdiction to take\n\ncognizance of the offences after receipt of report as\n\ncontemplated under Section 173(2) of the Code. Thus, this\n\nReportable\n\nCourt finds that correct proposition of law was not laid down\n\nin Mavuri Rani Veera Bhadranna (supra) when the Division\n\nBench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the said case\n\nheld that as\nSection 198\nof Criminal Procedure Code still\n\nholds the field despite the amendment made by State\n\nLegislature, the Court would have no jurisdiction to take\n\ncognizance of an offence punishable under\nSection 494\nIPC\n\non the basis of report submitted by the Investigating Officer.\n\nEven if it is assumed for the sake of argument that in view of\n\nSection 198(1)(c)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, the\n\nMagistrate is disentitled to take cognizance of the offences\n\npunishable under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC despite the\n\nState amendment making those offences cognizable, this\n\nCourt notices that in Mavuri Rani Veera Bhadranna\n\n(supra), the Division Bench has considered effect of\nSection\n\n155(4)\nof the Criminal Procedure Code and thereafter held\n\nthat the bar under Section 198 would not be applicable as\n\ncomplaint lodged before police for offence under\nSection 494\n\nIPC also related to other cognizable offences and if police files\n\na charge sheet, the Court can take cognizance also of offence\n\nReportable\n\nunder Section 494 along with other cognizable offences by\n\nvirtue of\nSection 155 (4)\nof the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\n15. Section 155(4) of the Code inter alia provides that:-\n\n\"Where a case relates to two or more\n\noffences of which at least one is\n\ncognizable, the case shall be deemed to be\n\na cognizable case, notwithstanding that\n\nthe other offences are non-cognizable\"\n\nHere in this case in the charge sheet it is mentioned\n\nthat the appellant has also committed offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 420\nof the Indian Penal Code which is\n\ncognizable and therefore this is a case which relates to two or\n\nmore offences of which at least one is cognizable and\n\ntherefore the case must be deemed to be cognizable case\n\nnotwithstanding that the other offences are non- cognizable.\n\nThis is not a case in which the FIR is exclusively filed for\n\ncommission of offences under\nSections 494\nand\nIPC.\n\nThe case of the respondent no. 2 is that the appellant has\n\ncommitted offences punishable under\nSections 417\n,\n,\n,\nand\n498A\nof the IPC. A question may arise as to\n\nReportable\n\nwhat should be the procedure to be followed by a\n\ncomplainant when a case involves not only non- cognizable\n\noffence but one or more cognizable offences as well. It is\n\nsomewhat anomalous that the aggrieved person by the\n\nalleged commission of offences punishable under\nSections\nand\nIPC should file complaint before a Court and\n\nthat the same aggrieved person should approach the police\n\nofficer for alleged commission of offences under\nSections 417\n,\nand\n498A\nof the Indian Penal Code. Where the case\n\ninvolves one cognizable offence also alongwith non-cognizable\n\noffences it should not be treated as a non- cognizable case\n\nfor the purpose of sub-\nsection 2\nof Section 155 and that is\n\nthe intention of legislation which is manifested in\nSection\n\n155(4)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, the\n\nargument that the learned Magistrate could not have taken\n\ncognizance of the offences punishable under\nSections 494\n\nand\nIPC on the basis of submission of charge sheet,\n\ncannot be accepted and is hereby rejected.\n\nReportable\n\n16. This Court finds that the High Court has quashed the\n\nproceedings pending before the learned Magistrate under\n\nSection 498A\nof IPC on the spacious ground that the\n\nmarriage of the appellant with the respondent no. 2 is void\n\nand as respondent no. 2 is not the wife, she was not entitled\n\nto lodge first information report with the police for\n\ncommission of offence u/s. 498A\nIPC\nand on the basis of\n\npolice report, cognizance of the said offence against the\n\nappellant could not have been taken by the learned\n\nMagistrate. Such reasoning is quite contrary to the law\n\ndeclared by this Court in\nReema Aggarwal Vs. Anupam and\n\nothers\n(2004) 3 SCC 199. After examining the scope of\n\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code and holding that a\n\nperson who enters into marital arrangement cannot be\n\nallowed to take shelter behind the smoke screen of\n\ncontention that since there was no valid marriage the\n\nquestion of dowry does not arise, this Court speaking\n\nthrough Hon'ble Mr. Justice Arijit Pasayat, has held as\n\nunder:-\n\nReportable\n\n\"Such legalistic niceties would destroy the\n\npurpose of the provisions. Such hairsplitting\n\nlegalistic approach would encourage\n\nharassment to a woman over demand of\n\nmoney. The nomenclature \"dowry\" does not\n\nhave any magic charm written over it. It is\n\njust a label given to demand of money in\n\nrelation to marital relationship. The\n\nlegislative intent is clear from the fact that it\n\nis not only the husband but also his relations\n\nwho are covered by Section 498A. The\n\nlegislature has taken care of children born\n\nfrom invalid marriages.\nSection 16\nof the\n\nMarriage Act deals with legitimacy of children\n\nof void and voidable marriages. Can it be\n\nsaid that the legislature which was conscious\n\nof the social stigma attached to children of\n\nvoid and voidable marriages closed its eyes to\n\nthe plight of a woman who unknowingly or\n\nunconscious of the legal consequences\n\nentered into the marital relationship? If such\n\nrestricted meaning is given, it would not\n\nfurther the legislative intent. On the\n\ncontrary, it would be against the concern\n\nshown by the legislature for avoiding\n\nharassment to a woman over demand of\n\nmoney in relation to marriages. The first\n\nexception to Section 494 has also some\n\nrelevance. According to it, the offence of\n\nbigamy will not apply to \"any person whose\n\nmarriage with such husband or wife has been\n\ndeclared void by a court of competent\n\njurisdiction\". It would be appropriate to\n\nconstrue the expression \"husband\" to cover a\n\nperson who enters into marital relationship\n\nand under the colour of such proclaimed or\n\nfeigned status of husband subjects the\n\nwoman concerned to cruelty or coerces her in\n\nany manner or for any of the purposes\n\nReportable\n\nenumerated in the relevant provisions-\n\nSections 304B/498A, whatever be the\n\nlegitimacy of the marriage itself for the\n\nlimited purpose of\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\n\nIPC. Such an interpretation, known and\n\nrecognized as purposive construction has to\n\ncome into play in a case of this nature. The\n\nabsence of a definition of \"husband\" to\n\nspecifically include such persons who\n\ncontract marriages ostensibly and cohabit\n\nwith such woman, in the purported exercise\n\nof their role and status as \"husband\" is no\n\nground to exclude them from the purview of\n\nSection 304B or 498A\nIPC\n, viewed in the\n\ncontext of the very object and aim of the\n\nlegislations introducing those provisions.\"\n\n17. In view of firm and clear law laid down on the subject,\n\nthis Court is of the confirmed view that the High Court was\n\nnot justified at all in quashing the proceedings initiated\n\nagainst the appellant under Section 498A of the Code on the\n\nground that the respondent no. 2 was not wife within the\n\nmeaning of\nSection 498A\nof the IPC and was not entitled to\n\nmaintain complaint under the said provision. The question\n\ntherefore which arises for consideration of the Court is\n\nwhether the said finding recorded by the High Court can and\n\nshould be set aside in the present appeal which is filed by\n\nReportable\n\nthe husband. It was argued by the learned Counsel for the\n\nappellant that quashing of proceedings with reference to\n\noffence punishable under\nSection 498A\nof Indian Penal Code\n\nis neither challenged by the State Government nor by the\n\noriginal complainant before this Court and the same having\n\nattained finality, the same cannot be disturbed in an appeal\n\nfiled by the husband appellant in which grievance is made\n\nregarding non-grant of relief in full by the High Court.\n\n18. This Court does not find any substance in the above\n\nmentioned argument of the learned Counsel for the\n\nappellant. The law declared by this Court in case of\nReema\n\nAggarwal\n(Supra) was binding on all Court including the\n\nlearned Single Judge of High Court of A.P. who decided the\n\npresent case in view of salutary provisions of\nArticle 141\nof\n\nthe Constitution.\nThe learned Single Judge of the High Court\n\ncould not have afforded to ignore the law declared by this\n\nCourt in Reema Aggarwal (Supra) while considering the\n\nquestion whether proceedings initiated by the respondent no.\n\n2 for commission of offence punishable under Section 498A\n\nReportable\n\nof\nIPC\nshould be quashed or not. The High Court has\n\ncompletely misdirected itself in quashing the proceedings for\n\nthe offence punishable under\nSection 498A\nof IPC. There is\n\nno manner of doubt that the finding recorded by the High\n\nCourt that the respondent no. 2 is not the wife within the\n\nmeaning of\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code runs\n\ncontrary to law declared by this Court in case of\nReema\n\nAggarwal\n(Supra). There may be several reasons due to\n\nwhich the State might not have challenged that part of the\n\nJudgment of the learned Single Judge quashing the\n\ncomplaint filed by the respondent no. 2 under\nSection 498A\n\nof the Indian Penal Code. So also because of several reasons\n\nsuch as want of funds, distance, non-availability of legal\n\nadvice, etc. the original complainant might not have\n\napproached this Court to challenge that part of the judgment\n\nof the learned Single Judge which is quite contrary to the law\n\ndeclared by this Court. However, this Court while\n\nentertaining an appeal by grant of special leave has power to\n\nmould relief in favour of the respondents notwithstanding the\n\nfact that no appeal is filed by any of the respondents\n\nReportable\n\nchallenging that part of the order which is against them. To\n\nnotice an obvious error of law committed by the High Court\n\nand thereafter not to do anything in the matter would be\n\ntravesty of justice. This Court while disposing of an appeal\n\narising out of grant of special leave can make any order\n\nwhich justice demands and one who has obtained illegal\n\norder would not be justified in contending before this Court\n\nthat in absence of any appeal against illegal order passed by\n\nthe High Court the relief should not be appropriately\n\nmoulded by the Court or that the finding recorded should not\n\nbe upset by this Court.\n\n19.\nIn\nChandrakant Patil Vs. State\n(1998) 3SCC 38,\n\neven in absence of an appeal by Government specifically for\n\nthat purpose and in absence of revisional power as is\n\navailable to High Court and Sessions Court, under\nCriminal\n\nProcedure Code\n, this Court held that the Supreme Court has\n\npower under\nArticle 142\nread with\nSection 19\nof the Terrorist\n\nand Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 to enhance\n\nthe sentence for doing complete justice in the matter that in\n\nReportable\n\nthe circumstances of the case appeared to it, to be too\n\ninadequate. In the said case it was contended that the\n\nSupreme Court has no power to enhance sentence in the\n\nabsence of an appeal by the Government presented\n\nspecifically for that purpose more so because Supreme Court\n\nhas no revisional powers which the High Court and Court of\n\nSessions are conferred with by the\nCriminal Procedure Code\n.\n\nWhile negativating the said contention this Court has firmly\n\nruled that powers of the Supreme Court in appeals filed\n\nunder\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution are not restricted by\n\nthe appellate provisions enumerated under the\nCode of\n\nCriminal Procedure\nor any other statute. What is held as\n\nfirm proposition of law is that when exercising appellate\n\njurisdiction the Supreme Court has power to pass any order.\n\nThe power under\nArticle 136\nis meant to supplement the\n\nexisting legal frame work. It is conceived to meet situations\n\nwhich cannot be effectively and appropriately tackled by the\n\nexisting provisions of law. Though challenge was not made\n\nby any of the two respondents to the finding recorded by the\n\nlearned Single Judge that the complaint lodged by the\n\nReportable\n\nrespondent no. 2 for alleged commission of offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code is\n\nnot maintainable because she is not a wife, this Court feels\n\nthat absence of challenge either by State or by the original\n\ncomplainant should not persuade or prevent this Court from\n\ndoing justice between the parties by restoring the complaint\n\nfiled by the respondent no. 2 under\nSection 498A\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code on the file of the learned Magistrate. The\n\nconclusion arrived at by the High Court is such as to shake\n\nthe conscience and sense of justice and therefore it is the\n\nduty of this Court to strike down the finding recorded with\n\nrespect to the offence punishable under Section 498A,\n\nirrespective of technicalities. The judgment of the High Court\n\nquashing the proceedings initiated by the learned Magistrate\n\nfor commission of offence punishable under Section 498A is\n\ntainted with serious legal infirmities and is founded on a\n\nlegal construction which is wrong. So the technical plea\n\nadvanced by the learned counsel for the appellant that in\n\nabsence of appeal by any of the respondents, quashing of\n\nproceedings with respect to the offence punishable under\n\nReportable\n\nSection 498A\nIPC, cannot be set aside, is hereby rejected. As\n\nheld in\nRamakant Rai Vs. Madan Rail\n(2003) 12 SCC 395\n\nfollowing\nArunachalam Vs. P.S.R. Sadanatham\n(\n1979) 2\n\nSCC 297 and P.S.R. Sadanatham Vs. Arunchalam\n(1980) 3\n\nSCC 141, the appellate power vested in the Supreme Court\n\nunder\nArticle 136\nis not to be confused with the ordinary\n\nappellate power exercised by appellate Courts and appellate\n\nTribunals under specific statutes. It is plenary power\n\nexercisable outside the purview of ordinary law to meet the\n\ndemand of justice.\nArticle 136\nis a special jurisdiction. It is\n\nresiduary power. It is extraordinary in its amplitude. The\n\nlimits of Supreme Court when it chases injustice, is the sky\n\nitself. Further, the powers under\nArticle 136\ncan be\n\nexercised by the Supreme Court, in favour of a party even\n\nsuo motu when the Court is satisfied that compelling\n\ngrounds for its exercise exist. Where there is manifest\n\ninjustice, a duty is enjoined upon this Court to exercise its\n\nsuo motu power by setting right the illegality in the judgment\n\nof the High Court as it is well settled that illegality should not\n\nbe allowed to be perpetuated and failure by this Court to\n\nReportable\n\ninterfere with the same would amount to allow illegality to be\n\nperpetuated. When an apparent irregularity is found by this\n\nCourt in the order passed by the High Court, the Supreme\n\nCourt cannot ignore substantive rights of a litigant while\n\ndealing with the cause pending before it. There is no\n\nreason why the relief cannot be and should not be\n\nappropriately moulded while disposing of an appeal arising\n\nby grant of special leave under\nArticle 136\nof the\n\nConstitution.\n\n20. Therefore, that part of the impugned judgment by which\n\nthe complaint filed by the respondent no. 2 under Section\n\n498A of the Indian Penal code is quashed by the High Court\n\nwill have to be set aside while disposing the appeal filed by\n\nthe appellant.\n\n21. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal filed by the\n\nappellant fails and therefore the same is hereby dismissed.\n\nThe impugned Judgment quashing the complaint filed by the\n\nrespondent no. 2 for alleged commission of offence by the\n\nReportable\n\nappellant under\nSection 498A\nIPC, is hereby set aside and\n\nthe complaint lodged by the respondent no. 2 under\nSection\n\n498A\nof the Indian Penal Code as well as charge sheet\n\nsubmitted by the Investigating Officer for the same shall\n\nstand restored/revived.
