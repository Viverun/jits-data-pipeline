Shed No. 83-\n84 situated at Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II, Scheme-I, New Delhi-110020\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the suit property\") and Permanent Injunction for\nrestraining defendant from creating third party rights in the suit property.\n\n2. The facts in brief are that the plaintiff entered into an Agreement to\nSell dated 09.02.2006 in respect of the suit property with the defendant for a\ntotal consideration of Rs. 1,24,00,000/-. The plaintiff paid a sum of Rs.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 1 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n24,00,000/- through cash and cheque with the acknowledgement in the\nAgreement itself. Clause 2 of the Agreement provided that the balance\namount of Rs. 1,00,00,000/- would be paid by the plaintiff within 15 days of\nthe registration of the Conveyance Deed in respect of suit property in the\nname of the defendant by Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation\n(hereinafter referred to as \"D.S.I.D.C.\") and the defendant shall deliver the\nvacant possession of the suit property to the plaintiff thereof.\n\n3. Clause 7 of the Agreement provided that if the Conveyance Deed is\nnot received from D.S.I.D.C by 30.04.2006, the Agreement shall be treated\nas cancelled and the first party (defendant) shall be entitled to the refund of\nentire amount. However, it is also stated that the Agreement may be\nextended at the discretion of the plaintiff herein. Further, Clause 9 of the\nAgreement provided that it is an irrevocable Agreement. The three clauses\nread as under:\n\n\"2. That the balance amount of Rs. 1,00,00,000/- (Rupees\nOne Crore only) will be paid by the Second Party to the First\nParty after getting the Conveyance Deed in favour of the\nFirst Party of the said property and within 15 days of\nregistered conveyance deed of the said property in favour of\nfirst party; and the First Party; will deliver the vacant\nphysical possession of the said property to the Second Party\nat the time getting the final payment and execute the required\ndocuments in favour of the Second Party.\n\n...\n\n7. In case the offer from D.S.I.D.C is not received by the first\nparty by 30.04.2006 then this agreement will be treated as\ncancelled and first party will refund the entire amount\nreceived from the second party to the second party within 7\ndays or the Agreement will be extended at the discretion of\nthe second party.\n\n...\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 2 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n9. That this Agreement is irrevocable and if any of the parties\nfails to complete the transaction, the aggrieved party shall\nget it enforced through court of law and the defaulting party\nshall be liable for all expenses, costs, incurred and damages\nsuffered.\"\n\n4. Admittedly, on 30.04.2006, the parties mutually consented to extend\nthe Agreement upto 30.06.2006. The plaintiff has claimed that the defendant\non an erroneous interpretation of the Agreement, wrote a letter dated\n06.07.2006 stating that since the Conveyance Deed from D.S.I.D.C. has not\nbeen received on 30.04.2006 and thereafter till 30.06.2006, the Agreement\nhas come to an end in terms of the Clause 7 of the Agreement and the\namount of Rs. 24,00,000/- was returned by way of Bank Pay Order.\n\n5. The plaintiff on receipt of the said letter gave a Legal Notice through\nhis counsel dated 12.07.2006 to the defendant stating that it was the\ndiscretion of the plaintiff to extend the time as per Clause 7 of the\nAgreement and the time stood extended to such time till the Conveyance\nbecame available to the defendant and that the plaintiff was ready and\nwilling to complete the transaction as he had sufficient funds for completion\nof the transaction; time was not the essence of the Contract and that the\nrefund of the amount was on false and frivolous assertions. The plaintiff\ncalled upon the defendant to complete the transaction, lest he would initiate\nlegal proceedings for Specific Performance of the Agreement to Sell. The\ndefendant reiterated vide letter dated 28.07.2006 asserting that the\nAgreement has come to an end as no Conveyance Deed has been received\nfrom D.S.I.D.C.\n\n6. The plaintiff has claimed that the defendant has interpreted the\nAgreement incorrectly since Clause 7 provided for extension of the\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 3 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nAgreement by the plaintiff and Clause 9 specifically provided that the\nAgreement was irrevocable. The plaintiff till date has not encashed the Pay\nOrders.\n\n7. It is asserted that the defendant has taken a false plea of D.S.I.D.C.\nnot having given any Conveyance Deed; rather the defendant has become\ndishonest as he wants more money. The plaintiff has asserted that the\ndamages can neither be computed in terms of money nor is it an adequate\ncompensation for the failure on the part of the defendant to perform the\nAgreement. The plaintiff has thus sought Specific Performance of the\nAgreement dated 09.02.2006 and Permanent Injunction for restraining the\ndefendant from selling, alienating, transferring, parting with possession or\ncreating any third-party rights, by way of this suit.\n\n8. The defendant in his Written Statement has admitted having\nentered into an Agreement dated 09.02.2006. It is explained that the sheds\nwere made available by D.S.I.D.C. to various entrepreneurs on Hire-\nPurchase basis. However, the terms of Hire-Purchase Agreement could not\nbe finalized by D.S.I.D.C., thought it continued to charge the monthly lease\nrent from the entrepreneurs with the understanding that the same would be\nadjusted against the cost of Hire-Purchase.\n\n9. Eventually, D.S.I.D.C. made some offer of Hire-Purchase to the\ndefendant, but like many other entrepreneurs, he did not accept the offer.\nLitigation was commenced under\nPublic Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized\nOccupants) Act, 1971\nwhich continued for more than a decade at various\nlegal fora.\n\n10. D.S.I.D.C. vide its Letter dated 27.07.2005 sought acceptance by\n10.08.2005 of its offer given vide Letter dated 29.01.2004, so that thereafter\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 4 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nthe dues statement could be made available to the allottees. The defendant\naccepted the offer vide Intimation Letter dated 10.08.2005 and requested\nD.S.I.D.C. to send the statement of account at the earliest. However, because\nof the background of the litigation and the manner it had culminated, there\nwas uncertainty whether D.S.I.D.C. would agree to sell the suit property to\nthe allottees. The defendant thus, entered into the Agreement to Sell with the\nplaintiff.\n\n11. The defendant did not receive the offer from D.S.I.D.C. till\n30.04.2006. Mutually, parties agreed to extend the Agreement till 30.6.2006\nwith an endorsement to that effect on the Agreement which was signed by\nboth the parties. Even thereafter no offer was received from D.S.I.D.C. till\n30.06.2006 and accordingly in terms of the Clause 7 of the Agreement, the\ndefendant refunded the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- by way of Pay Orders along\nwith the Letter dated 06.07.2006 informing the plaintiff that the Agreement\nstood cancelled as final purchase offer from D.S.I.D.C. had not been\nreceived till 30.06.2006 and the plaintiff had also not exercised his\ndiscretion to extend the Agreement. The plaintiff responded through a Legal\nNotice dated 12.07.2006 incorrectly claiming that it was in the discretion of\nthe plaintiff that time was extended till 30.06.2006, when in fact, it was\nextended by mutual consent of the parties. The defendant has denied that he\never made any representation to the plaintiff that the Conveyance Deed shall\nbecome available to him by 30.06.2006 after which the transaction may be\ncompleted. The defendant has further asserted that it was incorrectly claimed\nby the plaintiff that the time was not the essence of the Contract. Earlier too,\non 30.04.2006 which was the date of expiry stipulated under Clause 7 of the\nAgreement, the plaintiff met the defendant and extended the date further till\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 5 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n30.06.2006, by mutual consent. The subsequent conduct of the parties makes\nit abundantly clear that time was the essence of Contract. The receipt of the\nPay Order in the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- has also been acknowledged by the\nplaintiff. Though in the Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006, the plaintiff had\nasserted that the Conveyance Deed may be executed and physical possession\nbe handed over within 15 days of receipt of the reply failing which a Suit for\nSpecific Performance of the Contract shall be filed against the defendant,\nbut there is no explanation as to why the plaintiff continued to retain the Pay\nOrder or not inform the defendant of his intention to not encash it. The\nplaintiff‟s conduct in retaining the Pay Order clearly conveys his acceptance\nof revocation of Agreement to Sell.\n\n12. The defendant has further asserted that the Contract was a contingent\nContract and the amount was liable to be refunded to the plaintiff in the\nevent the terms of the Contract did not materialize within the fixed time. It is\nfurther asserted that since the Agreement was extended with the mutual\nconsent of both the parties on the first occasion on 30.04.2006, the clause\nleaving the discretion to the plaintiff to extend the Agreement automatically\nstood rescinded and modified to the extent that the mutual consent of both\nthe parties became necessary for further extension of the Agreement. It is\nclaimed that even if it is assumed that the plaintiff had discretion to extend\nthe Agreement, this should have been exercised by 30.06.2006 as was done\nbefore the earlier deadline, and on his failure to do so, the Agreement stood\ncancelled. The defendant became bound to refund money within 7 days\naccording to terms of the Agreement, which was refunded by way of Pay\nOrder to the plaintiff. This also reaffirms that time was the essence of the\nAgreement.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 6 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n13. The defendant has also stated that on account of his strenuous and\nsustained efforts and various letters, D.S.I.D.C. ultimately sent a Letter\ndated 11.08.2006 in which it made a reference to the defendant‟s Letter\ndated 24.07.2006 addressed to the Chief Secretary, Government of N.C.T. of\nDelhi and the Chairman, D.S.I.D.C., and informed that the request of the\nallottees had been acceded to, meaning thereby that D.S.I.D.C. agreed to\ngive the suit property to the allottees on their making one time full payment.\nThe defendant vide his Letter dated 14.08.2006 informed D.S.I.D.C. about\nthe co-allottees, namely, Shri B.K. Gupta, Smt. Chitra Chaudhry and Shri\nK.C. Bothra, having retired voluntarily from the partnership business and\nsought the transfer in his name vide Letter dated 14.08.2006. The request\nwas accepted by the D.S.I.D.C. vide its Letter dated 22.08.2006. The total\ncost of suit property and the transfer charges was calculated as Rs.\n73,38,096.38/- and after adjustments of various amounts, the total demand\nof Rs. 18,82,375.62/- was raised on the defendant. The defendant paid the\nentire amount by arranging the requisite amount through loan of Rs.\n16,00,000/- by mortgaging the suit property from Jain Co-operative Bank\nLimited.\n\n14. The defendant has asserted that it was not within the power of the\ndefendant to get the Conveyance Deed executed within the period as\nmentioned in the Legal Notice, and infact, no Conveyance Deed till date has\nbeen executed in his favour by D.S.I.D.C. Irrespective of this, no further\ncommunication was received from the plaintiff after his Legal Notice, and\nthe present Suit was filed by the plaintiff on 15.10.2008 i.e. after about 2½\nyears.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 7 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n15. The defendant has further explained that during the period between\n1983 and 2005, the defendant was consistently getting bulk orders for\nmanufacturing electronic and electro-mechanical equipment for Indian Air\nForce. However, the defendant‟s business suddenly dried up from October,\n2005 and did not foresee any improvement in future and on account of sheer\nfrustration, the defendant decided to sell the suit property and entered into\nthe Agreement with the plaintiff. However, the sluggishness of the business\nwas a temporary phase and thereafter, the business again picked up. Since\nthe plaintiff did not extend the Agreement after its expiry on 30.06.2006, it\nled the defendant to believe that the plaintiff has accepted that the\nAgreement no longer survived, and the defendant decided to retain the suit\nproperty. It is asserted that Specific Performance of the Agreement would\nnow result in extreme hardship. Moreover, since the terms of the Contract\nwere never complied with, the plaintiff is not entitled to any Decree of\nSpecific Performance.\n\n16. The plaintiff in his Replication has reaffirmed his assertions as\ncontained in the Plaint.\n\n17. The issues were framed on 22.09.2009 which read as under:\n\n\"1. Whether the plaintiff proves that he was ready and\nwilling to perform his part ofthe contract and continues to be so\n(to perform his part of the contract) dated09.02.2006? OPP;\n\n2. Whether by reason of clause-9 of the agreement to sell\ndated 09.02.2006, the contract is irrevocable? OPP;\n\n3. Whether time was the essence to the contract, as claimed\nby the defendant? OPD.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 8 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n4. Whether the contract between the parties cannot be\nenforced, as claimed for the reason that it was a contingent\ncontract? OPD;\n\n5. Whether the plaintiff is disentitled to any relief as he did\nnot seek extension of the contract beyond the extended period\ni.e., 30.06.2006;\n\n6. Is the plaintiff entitled to a decree for specific\nperformance of the agreement to sell dated 09.02.2006? OPP;\n\n7. Relief.\"\n\n18. PW1/plaintiff tendered his evidence by way of affidavit Ex. PW1/A.\nThe Advance Receipt-cum-Agreement to Sell dated 09.02.2006 is Ex.\nPW1/1; endorsement of extension of time upto 30.04.2006 on the\nAgreement to Sell is Ex.

DW1/7. The testimony and the\ndocuments in detail shall be considered subsequently.\n\n20. Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the plaintiff has submitted\nthat essentially the facts are not in dispute; no time was prescribed for\nconcluding the Sale and in terms of Clause 4, all the formalities were to be\nfulfilled by the defendant. The Agreement could have been cancelled in\naccordance with Clause 7 only if D.S.I.D.C. refused to execute the\nownership documents in favour of the defendant. Admittedly, the defendant\nhas acquired ownership in the suit property and since the Contract never\nstood rescinded and was irrevocable in terms of Clause 9 of the Agreement\nwhere no time limit was prescribed for its execution, the plaintiff is entitled\nto the execution of the Sale Deed. It is further argued that the plaintiff by not\nencashing the Pay Order in the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- clearly manifested his\nintention of not recalling the Agreement. Clause 7 of the Agreement was\nexplicit in providing that the Agreement could be cancelled if the offer was\nnot received from the D.S.I.D.C. Admittedly, the defendant has received the\nConveyance Deed and has also been handed over the possession.\n\n21. According to the terms of the Agreement, if any of the party failed to\ncomplete the transaction, the aggrieved party had a right to get it enforced\nthrough court of law and the defaulting party was liable for all expenses\nincurred and damages suffered.\n\n22. It is further argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the time was not the\nessence of the Agreement to Sell and the same still subsists, giving the right\nto the plaintiff to seek a Decree for Specific Performance of the Agreement\nto Sell.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 10 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n23. Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the plaintiff has placed reliance\non the decisions in\nFerrodous Estates (Pvt) Ltd. vs. P. Gopirathnam (Dead)\nand Ors.\nSCC OnLine 825, Chandee Widyawati Vati Madden vs. Dr.\nC.L. Katial\n\nAIR 1964 SC 978, R.C.

Bhalla\n(\n2012) 8 SCC 659 and A. Kanthamani\nvs. Narseen Ahmed\n(2017) 4 SCC 654.\n\n24. Learned counsel on behalf of the defendant has contended that the\nAgreement to Sell was extended till 30.06.2006 mutually by the parties by\nan endorsement made on the Agreement to Sell/Ex. PW1/1. In terms of the\nAgreement, since the Conveyance Deed was not forthcoming from\nD.S.I.D.C., the Contract stood rescinded as is evident from the conduct of\nthe parties. The defendant immediately refunded the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/-\non 06.07.2006 in terms of the Agreement to Sell vide Pay Order which was\nadmittedly received by the plaintiff. The plaintiff thereafter did not express\nany readiness and willingness but merely claimed that the Sale Deed may be\nexecuted in his favour after the Conveyance Deed is received by the\ndefendant from D.S.I.D.C. There is no equity in favour of the plaintiff in\nterms of the unamended\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963\n.\n\n25. It is further submitted that in terms of the Agreement, the payment\nhad been returned to the plaintiff through Pay Order and was not aware of\nnon-encashment of the Pay Order. The plaintiff maintained stoic silence\nafter his Legal Notice and the present suit was filed after 28 months in 2008.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 11 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n26. It is submitted that the plaintiff had sought re-validation of Pay Order\nduring the trial, but the same was rejected vide Order dated 16.01.2019 in\nterms of\nSection 22\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963.\n\n27. It is further argued that after the expiry of the Agreement on\n30.06.2006 about which a definite Notice was given by the defendant, there\nwas no renewal/extension of the Agreement by the plaintiff and the\nAgreement stood concluded on 30.06.2006. No Agreement to Sell survived\nthereafter for the plaintiff to claim its execution. Moreover, the plaintiff\nnever ever made any enquiry about the execution of the Conveyance Deed\nby D.S.I.D.C in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff has also failed to show\nthat he had the funds available or that he was ready and willing to perform\nhis part of the Agreement.` Moreover, the plaintiff has not sought any\ndeclaration that determination of Contract was bad in law. In the absence of\nany such declaration, the Suit for Specific Performance is not maintainable.\n\n28. The fundamental requirements of specific performance of an\nAgreement to Sell as mentioned in\nSection 55\nof the Specific Relief Act,\n1963 have neither been pleaded nor proved; for which reason the Suit is\nliable to be dismissed.\n\n29. Learned counsel on behalf of the defendant has placed reliance on the\ndecisions in\nOm Prakash Aggarwal v. Raj Kumar Mittal\n2019 SCC OnLine\nDel 7486, Mohinder Kaur v. Paul Singh (\n2019) 9 SCC 358, Dharampal\nSatyapal Ltd. v.

Submissions heard. My issue-wise findings are as under:\n\nISSUE NO. 1:\n\n1. \"Whether the plaintiff proves that he was ready and willing to\nperform his part of the contract and continues to be so (to perform\nhis part of the contract) dated 09.02.2006?\n\n31. The plaintiff has sought the relief Specific Performance of the\nAgreement to Sell dated 09.02.2006 Ex. P1.\n\n32. The principles relating to specific performance contained in\nSections\n16(c)\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963 read with Forms\n47/48 of Appendix A to C\nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 were\nsummarized by the Supreme Court in\nKamal Kumar v. Premlata Joshi\nSCC OnLine SC 12 as under:\n\n\"10. It is a settled principle of law that the grant of relief of\nspecific performance is a discretionary and equitable relief. The\nmaterial questions, which are required to be gone into for grant\nof the relief of specific performance, are First, whether there\nexists a valid and concluded contract between the parties for\nsale/purchase of the suit property; Second, whether the plaintiff\nhas been ready and willing to perform his part of contract and\nwhether he is still ready and willing to perform his part as\nmentioned in the contract; Third, whether the plaintiff has, in\nfact, performed his part of the contract and, if so, how and to\nwhat extent and in what manner he has performed and whether\nsuch performance was in conformity with the terms of the\ncontract; Fourth, whether it will be equitable to grant the relief\nof specific performance to the plaintiff against the defendant in\nrelation to suit property or it will cause any kind of hardship to\nthe defendant and, if so, how and in what manner andthe extent\nif such relief is eventually granted to the plaintiff; and lastly,\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 13 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nwhether the plaintiff is entitled for grant of any other alternative\nrelief, namely, refund of earnest money etc. and, if so, on what\ngrounds.\n\n11. In our opinion, the aforementioned questions are part of the\nstatutory requirements (See\nSections 16 (c)\n,\n,\n,\n,\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1963 and the forms 47/48 of Appendix A\nto C\nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n). These requirements have\nto be properly pleaded by the parties in their respective\npleadings and proved with the aid of evidence in accordance\nwith law. It is only then the Court is entitled to exercise its\ndiscretion and accordingly grant or refuse the relief of specific\nperformance depending upon the case made out by the parties\non facts.\"\n\n33. Admittedly, there was a valid and concluded Agreement to Sell dated\n09.02.2006 between the parties in respect of the suit property, which\nsatisfies the first condition.\n\n34.\nSection 16(c)\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963, though does not\nrequire any specific phraseology, but it mandates that the plaintiff has to\nnecessarily aver that he has performed or has always been willing and ready\nto perform his part of the Contract.\n\n35. The second aspect which is of extreme significance is whether the\nplaintiff had been, and is still ready and willing to perform his part as\nmentioned in the Agreement. The extent and the manner in which the\nAgreement has been performed and whether it was in conformity with the\nterms of the Contract, needs to be further considered.\n\n36. The legislature has chosen to use two phrases, namely readiness and\nwillingness. The readiness indicates the financial capacity of the plaintiff to\nperform the Agreement, while the willingness indicates his state of mind.\nIn\nso far as readiness is concerned, further question is required to be proved\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 14 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nthrough evidence that he had the financial capacity, as has been explained in\nthe case of\nK.V. Balan (Dead) Through Legal Representatives v. Bhavyanath\n\n2015 SCC OnLine Kel 298.\n\n37. In Syed Dastagir v. T.R. Gopalakrishna Setty (1999) 6 SCC 337, the\nApex Court while construing the connotation of readiness and willingness,\nobserved that the compliance of \"Readiness and willingness has to be in\nspirit and substance and not in letter and form. So to insist for mechanical\nproduction of the exact words of a statute is to insist for the form rather than\nessence. So absence of form cannot dissolve an essence if already pleaded.\"\nIt was also observed that the plea of readiness and willingness is not an\nexpression of art and science, but an expression through words to place fact\nand law of one‟s case for a relief. In order to gather true spirit behind a plea\nit should be read as a whole and to test whether the plaintiff has performed\nhis obligations, one has to see the pith and substance of the plea. Unless\nstatute \"specifically require a plea to be made in any particular form, it can\nbe in any form. No specific phraseology or language is required to take such\na plea.\"\n\n38.\nIn\nH.P. Pyarejan v. Dasappa (Dead) By L.Rs. &Ors.\n(2006) 2 SCC\n496, the Apex Court observed that the plaintiff is required to prove\ncontinuous readiness and willingness from the date of the contract to the\ntime of the hearing, to perform the contract on his part. Failure to make good\nthat averment brings with it and leads to the inevitable dismissal of the\nSuit.\n\nIn\nMotilal Jain v. Ramdasi Devi\n(2000) 6 SCC 420, the Apex Court\nhad expounded the same principle that averments in the plaint must reflect\nthe readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 15 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n39. The connotation of readiness in the context of\nSection 16\nwas\nexplained in\nRaghunath Rai & Another v. Jageshwar Prashad Sharma\n\n(1999) 50 DRJ 751 that the intending purchaser need not produce the money\nor to vouch a concluded scheme for financing the transaction; it is sufficient\nfor the purchaser to establish that he has the capacity to pay. The financial\ncapacity has to be however, proved strictly and self-serving statements\ncannot discharge the burden of proving existence of financial capacity as\nnoted by this Court in the case of Baldev. v. Bhule (2012) 132 DRJ 247.\n\n40. Similar view has been expressed in M/s\nHotz Industries Pvt. Ltd. v.\nDr. Ravi Singh\n2018 SCC OnLine Del7618 and Manhor Lal Khetrapal and\nOrs. v. Hari Chand and Ors. MANU/DE/2934/2018.\n\n41. Mere establishing \"readiness\" in the plaint itself is not sufficient to\nmeet the rigors of\nSection 16\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963. It has to be\ncontinuous as explained by the Apex Court in the case of\nN.P. Thirugnanam\nv. Dr. R. Jagan Mohan Rao\n(1995) 5 SCC 115, by stating that \"the\ncontinuous readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff is a\ncondition precedent to grant the relief of specific performance..... If the\nplaintiff fails to either aver or prove the same, he must fail. To adjudge\nwhether the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform his part of the contract,\nthe court must take into consideration the conduct of the plaintiff prior and\nsubsequent to the filing of the suit along with other attending circumstances.\nThe amount of consideration which he has to pay to the defendant must of\nnecessity be proved to be available. Right from the date of the execution\ntill date of the decree he must prove that he is ready and has always been\nwilling to perform his part of the contract. As stated, the factum of his\nreadiness and willingness to perform his part of the contract is to be\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 16 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nadjudged with reference to the conduct of the party and the attending\ncircumstances. The court may infer from the facts and circumstances\nwhether the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of the\ncontract.\"\n\n42.\nIn\nAniglase Yohannan v. Ramlatha and Others\n(2005) 7 SCC 534, the\nApex Court further observed that the court has to grant relief on the basis of\nthe conduct of the persons seeking relief. If the pleadings manifest that the\nconduct of the plaintiff entitles him to get the relief on perusal of the plaint,\nhe should not be denied the relief. The averments in the plaint as a whole\nmust clearly indicate the readiness and the willingness.\nSection 16(c)\nof the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963 mandates the plaintiff not only to make averments\nin the plaint but also to establish fact by evidence aliunde about his\nreadiness and willingness to perform the Contract.\n\n43. In Man Kaur (Dead) By LRs. v. Hartar Singh Sangha (2010) 10 SCC\n512, it was further qualified by the Supreme Court that even assuming that\nthe defendant has committed breach, it is for the plaintiff to aver in the plaint\nand prove that he has always been ready and willing to perform the essential\nterms of the contract which required to be performed by him.\n\n44. The Supreme Court in\nMadhukar Nivrutti Jagtap v. Pramilabai\nChandulal Parandekar2019\nSCC OnLine SC 1026 held that the requirement\nto prove readiness and willingness is not that the plaintiff should\ncontinuously approach the defendant with payment or make incessant\nrequests for performance. The requirement of readiness and willingness of\nthe plaintiff is not theoretical in nature but is essentially a question of fact\nwhich needs to be determined in reference to the pleadings and the evidence\nled by the parties.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 17 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n45. Similar observations were made by the Apex Court in\nBhavyanath v.\nK.V. Balan (Dead) Through Legal Representatives\n(2020) 11 SCC 790\nwhere the Apex Court, while considering the financial capacity to pay the\nconsideration, explained that the law is not that the plaintiff must prove that\nhe has cash in his hand from the date of Agreement till the relevant date. But\nwhat is important to be proved is that he had the capacity to allow the deal to\ngo through. Therefore, if the plaintiff is able to prove his assets which can be\nconverted into cash either by sale or by loan, it is sufficient to prove the\nfinancial capacity of the plaintiff. Even if the plaintiff is able to establish\nthat the defendant has refused to execute the Sale Deed and thereby\ncommitted a breach, is not sufficient to entitle him for specific performance\nunless he is also able to prove his own readiness and willingness.\n\n46.\nIn the recent judgment of\nU.N. Krishnamurthy (Since Deceased) v.\nA.M. Krishnamurthy\n2022 SCC OnLine SC 840, the Apex Court has\nreiterated that in order to prove \"readiness and willingness\" to perform the\nobligation to pay money in terms of the contract, the plaintiff would have to\nnot only make the requisite averments in the plaint but also adduce evidence\nto show the availability of funds to make payment in terms of the contract.\nThe plaintiff would have to prove that he had sufficient funds or was in a\nposition to raise funds in time to discharge his obligations under the\ncontract. If he does not have sufficient funds with him to make the required\npayment of money, he would have to specifically show how the funds would\nbe made available by him. Such readiness and willingness have to be proved\nall along till the decision of the Suit.\n\n47. In view of the above discussed cases, the law of evidence of the\nparties may be considered.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 18 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n48. The plaintiff has stated one line in his plaint and his affidavit of\nevidence Ex. PW1/A that he is ready and willing to perform his part of the\nContract, but the same is not supported by any details as to whether he has\nthe financial capacity or has sufficient means/money to pay the balance\nconsideration amount.\n\n49. The plaintiff, except a bald averment, has failed to substantiate his\nassertions or to prove the same with any evidence whatsoever. The only\nconclusion that can be drawn out is that there was no \"readiness\" on the part\nof the plaintiff to honour the Agreement to Sell.\n\n50. The other aspect which needs consideration is whether or not the\nplaintiff was willing to perform his part of the Contract.\n\n51. As already noted above, the „willingness‟ is in reference to conduct,\npast and future, of the plaintiff.\n\n52. It would be pertinent to refer to the affidavit of evidence of the\nplaintiff Ex. PW1/A, where he has deposed that the defendant had\ndeliberately and intentionally delayed in getting the permissions form\nD.S.I.D.C for execution of Conveyance Deed with a view to avoiding the\nextension of the Agreement, but he has himself admitted in his cross-\nexamination that after the termination of the Agreement on 30.06.2006, he\ndid not write any letter seeking extension of the Agreement in terms of\nClause 7 of the Agreement to Sell. The plaintiff has deposed that he had\napproached the defendant on 30.06.2006, but he was not found available in\nthe factory. He has also claimed that he had visited the defendant after\n30.06.2006 to state that he intended the Agreement to be extended but he has\nadmitted that neither he wrote any letter nor gave any Notice to the\ndefendant expressing his intention to extend the Agreement to Sell.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 19 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n53. The defendant has categorically deposed that immediately after\n30.06.2006 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement to Sell, he not\nonly wrote a letter informing the plaintiff about termination of the\nAgreement, but also returned a sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- which he had\nreceived from the plaintiff.\n\n54. The defendant has further deposed that a sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- had\ngot debited from his account on preparation of the Pay Order. The defendant\ncould not have possibly known about the non-encashment, especially unless\nhe was informed by the plaintiff which he admittedly did not do.\n\n55. Interestingly, the plaintiff himself has admitted in his\ncross-examination his intention to not continue with the Agreement and the\nsame is also evident from the fact that despite having received Pay Orders\nalong with Letter dated 06.07.2006 Ex. P3 from the defendant, he admittedly\ndid not mention about non-encashment of the Pay Orders in his Legal Notice\ndated 12.07.2006 Ex PW 1/4. Had there been any intention on the part of\nthe plaintiff to continue with the Agreement, there was nothing which\nprevented him from mentioning the same in his Legal Notice dated\n12.07.2006 Ex PW 1/4. The very fact that there is no mention of extension\nof the Agreement reflects the conduct of the plaintiff that he had intention to\nextend the Agreement beyond 30.06.2006. In addition to this, it is the\nplaintiff‟s own admission in his cross-examination that he retained the Pay\nOrder of Rs. 24,00,000/- even after sending the Legal Notice dated\n12.07.2006/ Ex PW 1/4. This act of retaining the Pay Order lends no\ncredibility to the intention of extending the Agreement that was expressed\nthrough Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006 and the testimony of the plaintiff.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 20 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n56. Another significant admission made by the plaintiff in his\ncross-examination is that after receiving the Pay Orders in the sum of Rs.\n24,00,000/- sent by the defendant, he went to meet the defendant who told\nhim that as per the instructions of his wife, the suit property was not to be\nsold. According to the plaintiff himself, the defendant had claimed that he\ndid not want to sell the suit property, though it is denied by the defendant in\nhis testimony that the plaintiff ever met him after 30.06.2006. But even if\nthis assertion of the plaintiff is accepted, it only conveys that he did not seek\nany further extension as the defendant also did not want to continue with the\nAgreement.\n\n57. In the end, the cross-examination of the defendant to the effect that\nneither did he try to find out the status of the suit property nor did he make\nany enquiry from D.S.I.D.C as to whether the Sale Deed has been executed\nin favour of the defendant reflects his inaction and disinterest to continue\nwith the Agreement to Sell. This fact was also admitted by the plaintiff in\nhis cross-examination. The subsequent conduct of the plaintiff reaffirms that\nhe had no intention to continue with the Agreement to Sell.\n\n58. There is abundant evidence on record and the admissions made by the\nplaintiff himself to prove that he himself had no intention or willingness to\ncontinue with the Agreement.\n\n59. It is thus proved that the plaintiff was neither willing nor ready for the\nexecution of the Agreement to Sell, and for this reason, he did not seek any\nextension of the Contract beyond 30.06.2006 which disentitles him from\nseeking specific performance of the Agreement to Sell.\n\n60. The Issue No. 1 is decided against the plaintiff.\n\nISSUE NOS. 3 & 5:\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 21 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n\"3. Whether time was the essence to the contract, as claimed by the\ndefendant?\"\n\n\"5. Whether the plaintiff is disentitled to any relief as he did not seek\nextension of the contract beyond the extended period i.e.,\n30.06.2006.\"\n\n61. An objection has been taken by the defendant that the time as\nprescribed under the Agreement was the essence and since the plaintiff did\nnot come forth till 30.06.2006 which was agreed to be the date for execution\nof the Agreement as was provided in Clause 7, the Agreement stood vitiated.\n\n62. To appreciate this contention, it would be pertinent to reproduce the\nrelevant clause of the Agreement to Sell Ex. P1 which is as under:\n\n\"Clause 7-\nIn case the offer from D.S.I.D.C is not received by the\nfirst party by 30.04.2006 then this agreement will be treated as\ncancelled and first party will refund the entire amount received\nfrom the second party to the second party within 7 days or the\nAgreement will be extended at the discretion of the second\nparty.\"\n\n63. Before considering this contention on the facts of this case, it would\nbe pertinent be consider whether the time principally, is the essence of an\nAgreement to Sell. In earlier days, Time for performance of Agreement to\nSell was not considered as essence.\n\n64. The Madras High Court in\nS.V. Sankaralinga Nadar v. P.T.S.\nRatnaswami Nadar\nAIR 1952 Mad 389 observed that the time difference of\nsix months that was agreed in the Agreement to Sell for execution of the\nSale Deed may not amount to essence of Contract, but it must have some\nmeaning. Not for nothing could such time-limit would have been prescribed.\nNeither can it be posted as a rule of law or rule or prudence where time is\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 22 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nnot made the essence of Contract, all stipulations of time provided in the\nContract would have no significance or meaning or that they are as good as\nnon-existent. All it means is that while exercising its discretion, the Court\nshould also bear in mind that when the parties have prescribed certain\nlimits for taking steps by one or the other party, it must have some\nsignificance and the time limits cannot be ignored altogether on the ground\nthat the time has not been made the essence of the Contract where there is\ntotal inaction on the part of the plaintiff for two and a half years which itself\nis in clear violation of the terms of the Agreement which required him to do\ncertain things, such delay along with other accompanying circumstances\nwhich would make it inequitable to grant the relief of Specific Performance,\nwould become relevant in a case of Specific Performance.\n\n65. The logic as to why in earlier judgments, time was not being held as\nof essence in the Agreement to Sell, was given by the Apex Court in\nK.S.\nVidyanadam and Others v. Vairavan\n(1997) 3 SCC 1, wherein it was\nobserved that the Courts of India following certain early decisions of\nEnglish Courts have held that in the Agreement to Sell, time is not an\nessence of the Contract unless specifically provided to that effect. However,\nthe Court cannot be oblivious to the reality of the constant and continuous\nrise in the values of urban property fueled by the large-scale migration of the\npeople from rural areas to urban centers and by inflation and thus, the rigor\nof rule evolved by the court that the time is not an essence of the Contract in\nthe case of immoveable properties requires to be relaxed, if not modified,\nparticularly in the case of urban immoveable properties.\n\n66. It was further observed in\nK.S. Vidyanadam\n(supra) that there was\ntotal inaction on the party of the plaintiff for two and a half of years to\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 23 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nperform his party of the Agreement and such delay between the date of\nAgreement and the filing of the Suit would make it inequitable to grant the\nrelief of Specific Performance to the plaintiff.\n\n67. Similar explanation prevailed with the Apex Court in\nSaradamani\nKandappan Kandappan v. S. Rajalakshmi and Others\n(2011) 12 SCC 18\nwhere it was observed that the assumption for holding that time was not an\nessence for the grant of specific performance would not prejudice the vendor\ndefendant financially as there would not be much difference in the market\nvalue of the property even if the Contract was performed after a few months.\nThis principle made sense during the first half of the twentieth century,\nwhen there was comparatively very little inflation in India. The third quarter\nof the twentieth century saw a very slow but steady increase in prices. But a\ndrastic change occurred from the beginning of the last quarter of the\ntwentieth century. There has been a galloping inflation and prices of\nimmoveable properties have increased steeply by leaps and bounds. Market\nvalues of properties are no longer stable or steady. A judicial notice can be\ntaken and, in such scenario, the readiness and the willingness on the part of\nthe plaintiff. The conduct of delay, laches and prejudice has become relevant\nto ascertain if the time was the essence in the Agreement.\n\n68. The change in the prevailing market scenario has brought a change in\nperspective as is reflected in\nSaradamani\n(supra) where the Apex Court\nobserved that it may not be correct to say that the time is not the essence for\nperformance of the Contract of an immoveable property, but whether the\ntime is an essence would depend upon the nature of delay and the terms of\nAgreement, especially the readiness and willingness of the plaintiff to\nexecute the Agreement. It was observed that the time can be said to be the\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 24 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nessence where the purchaser does not take steps to complete the sale within\nthe stipulated period and the vendor is not responsible for any delay. The\nfact that there has been a steep rise in the price within the stipulated time\nwould be a circumstance which may make it inequitable to grant the relief of\nspecific performance. Thus, time for performance as stipulated in the\nAgreement, may be assumed to be not material, or at all events be\nconsidered as merely indicating the reasonable period within which the\nContract should be performed.\n\n69.\nIn\nFerrodous Estates (Pvt.) Ltd. v. P. Gopirathnam (Dead) and\nOthers\n2020 SCC OnLine SC 825, the Supreme Court after referring to the\naforesaid judgments observed that while exercising discretion in the Suit for\nSpecific Performance, the Court must keep in mind the time/period\nprescribed by the parties for taking certain steps or for completion of the\ntransaction which must be given significance and the prescribed time limits\nare not to be ignored.\n\n70. The time frames for performance of Agreement to Sell has to be\nevaluated in conjunction with the conduct and intention of the parties in the\ncontext of surrounding circumstances and the prevailing market scenario. As\nobserved in the case of\nFerrodous\n(supra), the greatest scrutiny and\nstrictness of readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff may be\napplied to ascertain the time-frames.\n\n71. In this case, the Agreement provided the extended date of\nperformance as 30.06.2006. The significant aspect is that after receipt of the\nletter dated 06.07.2006/Ex. PW1/3 from the defendant specifically\nindicating that since the Conveyance Deed had not been received from\nD.S.I.D.C on 30.06.2006 and the plaintiff had not extended the Contract\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 25 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nfurther, he was returning the money received by him under the Agreement\nand it has come to an end. In response thereto, the plaintiff sent the Legal\nNotice dated 12.07.2006/ Ex. PW1/4 claiming that the time stood extended\nunder Clause 7 and called upon the defendant to complete the transaction\nwithin a period of 15 days, failing which the plaintiff shall institute a Suit for\nSpecific Performance. The defendant vide Reply dated 28.07.2006/Ex.\nPW1/5 to the said Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006, reiterated that the\nAgreement had come to an end as the Conveyance Deed had not been\nfinalized by the D.S.I.D.C.\n\n72. The Agreement to Sell/ Ex. PW1/1 had stipulated in Clause 7 that if\nthe offer from D.S.I.D.C was not received till 30.04.2006, then the\nAgreement were being treated as cancelled and the money shall be refunded\nby the second party within 7 days or unless the Agreement is extended at the\ndiscretion of the second party (plaintiff). Though the plaintiff had served the\ndefendant with the Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006/ Ex PW 1/4 about the\nextension of the time for execution of the Conveyance Deed, but the conduct\nof the parties needs to be further considered to ascertain the true intention.\n\n73. In the first instance, the Agreement was to get concluded on\n30.04.2006 and admittedly, the Agreement was extended by mutual consent\nby both the parties on 30.04.2006 by making an endorsement Ex. PW1/2 on\nthe Agreement to Sell/ Ex. PW1/1. No such extension was made either by\nthe plaintiff or mutually after 30.06.2006. Nothing prevented the plaintiff to\nhave sought extension or to make an endorsement to that effect before or\nupon expiry of the relevant date i.e., 30.06.2006. But no endeavour\nwhatsoever was made by the plaintiff for extension of the date, the second\ntime. There being no extension by the plaintiff or mutually by both the\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 26 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nparties as was done in the first instance, clearly reflects that there was no\nintention to further extend the Agreement by the plaintiff.\n\n74. The conduct of the plaintiff after termination of the Contract further\nreinforces that the \"time\" in this particular case became an essence of the\nContract since the plaintiff had no further intention of extension of the time.\n\n75. The defendant on the other hand, on expiry of the date i.e., 30.06.2006\nfor the execution of the Sale Deed, immediately informed the plaintiff vide\nLetter dated 06.07.2006 Ex. P3 about the termination of the Agreement and\nalso returned Rs. 24,00,000/- by way of Pay Orders in terms of Clause 7 of\nthe Agreement. It is the defendant‟s Letter dated 06.07.2006 which\npromoted the plaintiff to immediately resort to a Legal Notice dated\n12.07.2006/ Ex. P4 asserting that the time stood extended and called upon\nthe defendant to complete the transaction within a period of 15 days. The\ncontents of the Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006/ Ex. P4 itself was merely an\nendeavour to meet the legal requirement of there being some expression of\nintention to continue in terms of\nSection 16\nof the Specific Relief Act. The\npre-requisite for performance of the Agreement was execution of the Sale\nDeed by D.S.I.D.C which did not happen till the contemplated date i.e.,\n30.06.2006 and there was no question of execution of Sale Deed by\ndefendant in the circumstances. It is only to meet the legal requirement that\nperfunctory Legal Notice was sent without any genuine intention to continue\nwith the Agreement.\n\n76. This becomes evident as interestingly, the plaintiff has not referred to\nthe contention of the defendant about non-execution of Conveyance Deed by\nD.S.I.D.C, but merely has stated that there is an extension of time under\nClause 7 of the Agreement. Furthermore, even though Rs. 24,00,000/- that\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 27 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nhad been paid by the plaintiff in part performance were returned by way of\nPay Orders, the plaintiff has not uttered a word in respect of the Pay Orders\nin his Legal Notice. The plaintiff has failed to indicate whether he was\nencashing or refusing to accept the money. The consequence of the same\nwas that the Pay Orders had been retained in his possession by the plaintiff.\nThough the plaintiff may not have encashed them, but he failed to so inform\nthe defendant. The money has already been debited from the account of the\ndefendant and he had no way to know that the Pay Orders have not been\nencashed. The only inference that could have been drawn by the defendant\nwas that the return of money has been accepted by the plaintiff, and the\nAgreement to Sell stands concluded.\n\n77. Further, the defendant in his evidence has explained that there was\nmuch litigation/ correspondence exchanged with D.S.I.D.C. for clarity on\nconferment of ownership rights in respect of suit property and uncertainty\nshrouded about acquisition of ownership rights. Therefore, the plaintiff, who\nwas aware of uncertainty about the defendant ever being able to get\nownership rights, insisted on insertion of Clause 7 fixing the deadline for\nconcluding the Agreement. For this reason, the extension was made only for\ntwo months as plaintiff was not inclined to be bound with this transaction for\na long time. Also, it was at his insistence that clause giving him unilateral\nright to extend the Agreement was inserted subsequently in writing instead\nof being typed in the main body. The circumstances coupled with the\nconduct of plaintiff and term of Agreement was explained by defendant lead\nto only one conclusion that once the offer from D.S.I.D.C. was not received\ntill 30.06.2006, the plaintiff decided not to seek further extension and let the\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 28 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nAgreement lapse on account of uncertainty around the D.S.I.D.C. executing\nthe Deed in favour of defendant.\n\n78. The conduct of the plaintiff thereafter is equally significant to gather\nhis intention. The plaintiff, despite being informed about the cancellation of\nAgreement immediately on expiry of stipulated time, maintained stoic\nsilence for 28 months to institute the Suit on 06.10.2008. Though the Suit\nmay have been filed within the period of limitation, but it is a case of total\ninaction on the part of the plaintiff for almost 28 months, which itself speaks\nof the intention of the plaintiff not to extend the Agreement beyond the\nstipulated time.\n\n79. Similar facts as in hand came up for consideration in\nAtma Ram v.\nCharanjit Singh\n(2020) 3 SCC 311. After issuing a Legal Notice on\n12.11.1996, the petitioner filed the Suit after the long delay of three years.\nThe Supreme Court observed that there was no explanation forthcoming for\nsuch inordinate delay. The conduct of the plaintiff is very crucial in a Suit\nfor Specific Performance. A person who issues a Legal Notice on\n12.11.1996 claiming readiness and willingness, but institutes a Suit only on\n13.10.1999 and that too only with a prayer for a mandatory injunction\ncarrying a fixed court fee, would not be entitled to the discretionary relief of\nSpecific Performance.\n\n80. The timelines to be adhered by the parties and their intention to\nconclude the Agreement in a time bound manner, are circumscribed by their\nconduct. To grant a Decree for Specific Performance lies in the discretion of\nthe Court which the Court may not exercise due to the conduct of the\nplaintiff, as observed by the Apex Court in\nNirmala Anand v. Advent\nCorporation (P) Ltd.\n, (2002) 8 SCC 146.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 29 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n81. Similar observations were made in\nZarina Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam\n\n(2015) 1 SCC 705 that the equitable discretion to grant a relief for specific\nperformance depends upon the conduct of the parties. Though efflux of time\nand escalation of price of the property by itself cannot be a valid ground to\ndeny the relief of Specific Performance, but it is necessary on the part of the\nplaintiff to establish and prove the circumstances so that the discretion can\nbe judiciously exercised in his favour.\n\n82.\nIn\nFerrodous Estates (Pvt.) Ltd.\n(supra), it was observed that mere\ndelay by itself without more, cannot be the sole factor to deny specific\nperformance. The greater scrutiny and strictness of \"readiness and\nwillingness\" on the part of the plaintiff may be applied to ascertain the\ntime-frames.\n\n83. The facts, as in hand, came up for consideration in\nKoli\nSatyanarayana (Dead) by LRs v. Valuripalli Kesava Rao Chowdary (Dead\n)\nthrough LRs & Ors. 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1306, wherein the Supreme\nCourt observed that the defendant had communicated to the plaintiff on\n12.04.1982 that since the requisite permission from the concerned authority\ncould not be obtained, as the plaintiff cancelled the Agreement. The\nplaintiff, however, did not initiate any proceedings against the defendant. It\nwas almost after a period of two years after the defendant gave the\nintimation about cancellation of their Agreement that the plaintiff chose to\nfile the Suit. The learned Single Judge considered it relevant as the conduct\nof the plaintiff disentitling him from exercising discretion in favour of the\nplaintiff in the Suit for Specific Performance even though it had been filed\nwithin the period of limitation as prescribed for filing such Suit. This\nconclusion not only met with approval by the Division Bench of the High\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 30 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nCourt, but was also upheld by the Apex Court which observed that despite\nbeing intimated about the cancellation of the Agreement, the plaintiff‟s\nconduct in not taking any action for more than two years, disentitled him\nfrom exercising discretion in his favour.\n\n84.\nIn\nGulshan Kumar & Ors vs. Sat Narain Tulsian (Deceased\n) 206\n(2014) DLT 443, reference was made to the observations of the Apex Court\nin\nK.S. Vidyanadam\n(supra) and\nSardamani Kandappan vs. Rajalakshmi\n\n(2011) 12 SCC 18, that the courts frown upon Suits which are not filed\nimmediately after breach/refusal and the fact that limitation is three years\ndoes not mean that a purchaser can wait for one year or two years to file a\nSuit and obtain specific performance. It was held that the three-year period\nis provided to assist the purchasers in special cases, where major part of the\nconsideration has already been paid and possession delivered in part\nperformance thereof.\n\n85. Similarly, the defendant in the present case, was duly informed by the\nplaintiff about the cancellation of the Agreement to Sell on account of\nConveyance Deed being not received by D.S.I.D.C by 30.06.2006 vide his\nLetter dated 06.07.2006/Ex. P3 despite which the plaintiff did not take any\nsteps whatsoever, for more than 28 months before filing the Suit on\n06.10.2008. Therefore, even though the present Suit has been filed within\nthe limitation, there is an unexplained delay of more than 28 months which\ndisentitles the plaintiff from exercise of discretion to grant the relief of\nSpecific Performance to him.\n\n86. It may, thus, be summed up that though time in given cases may not\nbe an essence of Agreement to Sell, but herein the present case, since it was\nlinked to getting a Conveyance Deed by 30.06.2006 which actually did not\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 31 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nhappen, and further considering that the defendant cancelled the Agreement\nto Sell vide his Letter dated 06.07.2006/ Ex. P3 and also returned the amount\nof ₹24,00,000/- by way of Pay Orders which were not repudiated by the\nplaintiff, except that he sent a Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006 Ex. P4\nclaiming specific performance, but he remained silent about cancellation or\nreturn of money received by him by way of Pay Orders, clearly reflects that\nthe time was treated as an essence in the Agreement to Sell which was\ncancelled on expiry of the stipulated time. Accordingly, the plaintiff was not\nentitled to seek extension of time beyond 30.06.2006.\n\n87. Moreover, the plaintiff‟s conduct in not taking any concrete steps\nuntil about 28 months further corroborates not only that the Agreement to\nSell stood cancelled on 30.06.2006 but also delayed action on the part of the\nplaintiff disentitles him to exercise discretion in his favour.\n\n88. Reliance for coming to this conclusion, may be placed on the\nobservations of Apex Court in\nRamathal v. Maruthathal\n(2018) 18 SCC\n303, that the specific performance is an equitable relief and granting relief is\nthe discretion of the Court which has to be exercised judicially within the\nsettled principles of law.\n\n89. Accordingly, the issue no. 3&5 are decided against the plaintiff.\n\nISSUE NO. 2:\n\n\"2. Whether by reason of clause-9 of the Agreement to Sell dated\n09.02.2006, the contract is irrevocable?\"\n\n90. The plaintiff has referred to Clause 9 of the Agreement to claim that\nthis Agreement is irrevocable. Clause 9 of the Agreement to Sell reads as\nunder:\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 32 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n\"Clause 9-\nThat this Agreement is irrevocable and if any of the\nparties fails to complete the transaction, the aggrieved party\nshall get it enforced through court of law and the defaulting\nparty shall be liable for all expenses, costs incurred and\ndamages suffered.\"\n\n91. It is not doubt true that this Clause 9 of the Agreement to Sell\nprovided that the Agreement would be irrevocable, but it was circumscribed\nby Clause 7 of the said Agreement which clearly provided that in case offer\nfrom D.S.I.D.C was not received by the first party by 30.04.2006, the\nAgreement shall be treated as cancelled and the first party i.e., the defendant\nshall refund the entire amount received under the Agreement. Clause 7\ncontained a condition precedent and unequivocally provided the\ncircumstance when the Agreement shall be treated as cancelled. Since no\noffer was received from D.S.I.D.C till 30.06.2006, the defendant repudiated\nthe Contract vide his Letter dated 06.07.2006/ Ex. P3 which was not\nseriously contested by the plaintiff who merely sent a Legal Notice dated\n12.07.2006 Ex. P4 seeking specific performance of the Agreement. The\nrequisite offer from D.S.I.D.C was a condition precedent and till such time\nthe offer was received, the defendant would not have acquired any\nownership right by virtue of which he could have executed the Sale Deed in\nfavour of the plaintiff.\n\n92. Clause 9 of the Agreement would have kicked in only if the\npermission had been received within the time frame after which neither\nparty would have had any occasion to revoke the Agreement to Sell. Since\nthe condition precedent, which was to get the Conveyance Deed from\nD.S.I.D.C was not fulfilled within the given time frame, Clause 9 would not\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 33 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nbecome applicable. Therefore, Clause 9 cannot be read dehors the other\nclauses of the Agreement and it is, therefore, held that Clause 9 did not\nmake the Contract irrevocable under all circumstances.\n\n93. The Issue No.2 is decided against the plaintiff.\n\nISSUE NO. 4:\n\n\"4. Whether the contract between the parties cannot be enforced, as\nclaimed for the reason that it was a contingent contract?\"\n\n94. A preliminary objection has been taken on behalf of the defendant\nthat the Agreement inter se the parties was a contingent contract and its\nperformance was dependent on the receipt of the offer by the defendant from\nD.S.I.D.C by 30.06.2006 and in the absence thereof, the period for execution\nof the Sale Deed could not be extended by mutual consent beyond\n30.06.2006.\n\n95. The term \"contingency\" is defined in the Concise Oxford English\nDictionary, Indian Edition Revised Eleventh Edition at Page 308, as a\nfuture event or circumstance which is possible but cannot be predicted with\ncertainty. Black's Law Dictionary by Bryan A. Garner Eighth Edition\ndefines contingent at Page 338 as (1) an event may or may not occur, a\npossibility, (2) the condition of being dependent on chance; uncertainty.\nAdvanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar 3 rd Edition defines\ncontingency at Page 1012 as (1) a situation in which may an event may or\nmay not happen, (2) something that is liable, but not certain, to happen at\nsome time in the future.\n\n96.\nSection 31\nof the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines the Contingent\nContract as under:\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 34 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n\"31. \"Contingent Contract\" defined.--A \"contingent contract\"\n\nis a contract to do or not to do something, if some event,\ncollateral to such contract, does or does not happen. --A\n\"contingent contract\" is a contract to do or not to do\nsomething, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or\ndoes not happen.\" Illustration A contracts to pay to B Rs.10,000\nif B's house is burnt. This is a contingent contract. A contracts\nto pay to B Rs.10,000 if B's house is burnt. This is a contingent\ncontract.\"\n\n97. The contingency is thus, essentially based upon uncertainty,\nindependent of the Contract of the parties. If the contingency occurs, the\nContract may be affected as has been provided under\nSection 32\nof the\nIndian Contract Act, 1872.\n\n98. In the present case, as per Clause 7 of the Agreement to Sell Ex. PW\n1/1, it was to be treated as cancelled in case no offer was received by the\ndefendant from D.S.I.D.C by 30.04.2006 and the defendant was liable to\nrefund the entire amount received from the plaintiff within 7 days unless the\nAgreement was extended by the second party in its discretion.\n\n99. Admittedly, D.S.I.D.C had sent its offer on 27.07.2005 much prior to\nthe execution of the Agreement, which was accepted by the defendant vide\nhis Letter dated 10.08.2005. Since the offer was already received by the\ndefendant at the time of execution of Agreement on 09.02.2006, it cannot be\nsaid that it was a contingent Contract dependent on some uncertain event.\nThe execution of the offer to execute the conveyance deed may have been\ndelayed, but this is not a situation where there existed no property or where\nthere were no proprietary rights in the defendant. Mere delay cannot make\nany agreement as dependent on uncertain terms.\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 35 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\n100. The offer of letter had already been received and it was the defendant\nwho had to do the needful. Therefore, the execution of the requisite\ndocuments in favour of the defendant was not an uncertain event, but was\nwell-defined with the only variable being the time. It cannot be said that it\nwas a contingent Contract and, therefore, void as claimed by the defendant.\n\n101. The issue is decided against the defendant.\n\nISSUE NO. 6:\n\n\"6. Is the plaintiff entitled to a decree for specific performance of the\nagreement to sell dated 09.02.2006? OPP\"\n\n102. Another aspect which has been argued by the defendant and needs\nconsideration is that even though the defendant vide his Letter dated\n06.07.2006/ Ex. P3 had cancelled the Agreement, but no relief for\ndeclaration that the cancellation of the Agreement to Sell by the defendant\nwas void and illegal, has been sought by the plaintiff. Without first\nchallenging the cancellation, no specific performance of the cancelled\nAgreement can be sought as has been held in\nI.S. Sikandar (Dead) By Lrs.&\nOrs. vs. K. Subramani & Ors.\n(2013) 15 SCC 27.\n\n103. The plaintiff has failed to seek the relief of declaration that the\ntermination of the cancellation of Agreement to Sell by the defendant was\nillegal and non-est. In the absence of any such prayer, the Suit filed by the\nplaintiff for grant of Decree of Specific Performance is not maintainable in\nlaw, for the simple reason, that a Decree for Specific Performance is sought\nin respect of the Agreement to Sell which has become non-existent pursuant\nto its cancellation. The plaintiff was, thus, required to seek a specific\ndeclaration in respect of the cancellation of the Agreement as void and in the\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 36 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023:DHC:2429\n\nabsence of the same, he cannot seek the specific performance of the\nAgreement to Sell.\n\n104. Therefore, the Issue No. 6 is decided against the plaintiff.\n\nISSUE NO. 7:\n\n\"7. Relief.\"\n\n105. In view of the findings in Issue Nos. 1, 5 and 6, the present Suit of the\nplaintiff is hereby dismissed.\n\n106. Litigation costs shall be borne by the plaintiff.\n\n(NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA)\nJUDGE\nAPRIL 10, 2023\nS.Sharma/A.Sharma\n\nSignature Not Verified CS(OS) 2248/2008 Page 37 of 37\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:SAHIL SHARMA\n\nSigning Date:10.04.2023\n\n19:06:30",
