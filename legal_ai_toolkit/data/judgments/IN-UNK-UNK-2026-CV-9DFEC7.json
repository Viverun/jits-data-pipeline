The victim, aged 2\n years is my daughter No.-2. I reside in the neighbourhood\n of my father-in-law.\n\n This day 11.02.13, as there was a programme of\n Mahaprasad in Duttatraya Temple in the village I had gone\n there for taking meals at about 7.00 p.m. After taking\n meals I returned home at about 7.30 p.m. At that time I did\n not see my daughter Miss XXX at home. Therefore, I\n asked my father-in-law as to where was my daughter. On\n it, he told me, “Shatrughna Baban Meshram, aged 21\n years, resident of Zatala has taken away your daughter\n XXX4 from me saying that he would reach her to you”.\n But Shatrughna did not bring my daughter to me. So I\n searched my daughter in the village. I saw my daughter\n XXX4 and Shatrughna Meshram lying in the new, under\n construction, building of Anganwadi. There was no pant\n on the person of my daughter. It was lying beside. Her\n face was bitten and private parts were swollen. I came out\n with my daughter. In the meantime, Baban Sambhaji\n Meshram, aged 50 years also came there. He took\n Shatrughna to his house. I along with father-in-law and\n Vitthal Ghodam took my daughter in an auto from the\n village to Dr. Jaffar Siddiqui from Kurli. The doctor\n examined her and declared her dead. So we returned\n home.\n\n Shatrughna Meshram took my daughter XXX4 in the\n building of Anganwadi, committed rape on her inhumanly\n in solitude, bit her on face and lips and committed her\n murder.”\n\n3. As stated in the FIR, the victim was taken to PW6 Dr. Md. Jaffar\n\nSiddiqui for medical attention but she was already dead and there were\n\n The identity of the victim is not being disclosed\n\n\f 3\n\nmarks of bites on her body.

The Prosecution examined 13 witnesses and produced the\n\nrelevant material in support of its case.\n\n\f 8\n\n8.1 PW1, the father of the victim proved the First Information Report\n\nand also stated about the examination of the victim by PW6 Dr. Md. Jafar.\n\nPW2, the grandfather of the victim narrated how the Appellant had taken\n\nthe victim along with him. It was stated:-\n\n “He told me that father of the victim had come from work\n and he told him to bring the victim. I told him that the\n victim’s father was yet to come and told him not to take\n the victim with him. But he did not listen me and took\n away the victim. Thereafter myself and my wife went to\n the house of complainant and asked him whether the\n victim was brought to him by accused and he told me that\n the victim was not brought to him. Therefore myself,\n complainant and Shrawan took search of the victim. We\n went towards water tank. One Vikas Masram on inquiry\n told that he saw the accused with the victim going towards\n Anganwadi. Therefore, we went towards Anganwadi. At\n that time the construction of Anganwadi was incomplete\n and we saw that the victim and accused both were lying in\n the premises of Anganwadi. Jins pant of the victim was\n lying aside and T Shirt was on her person. We saw that she\n had sustained bite wounds on her lips, chicks, chest and\n hips. There was bleeding from her private part.”\n\n8.2 PW6 Dr. Md. Jaffar stated that when the victim was brought before\n\nhim, she was already dead and had found wounds and bites on her body.\n\nPW7 Dr. Ulhas Digambar Lingawar, deposed about medical examination\n\nof the Appellant and opinion Exh.46.\n\n8.3 PW10 Dr. Sachin Janbaji Gadge, Assistant Professor, Department\n\nof Forensic Medicine, Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College,\n\nYavatmal proved the Post Mortem Report and stated about injury No.5 as\n\nunder: -\n\n\f 9\n\n “7. Injury No.5 can be caused by sharp edged teeth. No\n fracture on external examination or palpation. All injuries\n are ante-mortem and fresh. Except, injury No.5 under\n column No.17 (post-mortem).”\n\n The nature of injury No.17 and the steps taken after the post mortem\n\n were indicated thus:-\n\n “12. Injury No.17 under column No.17 with its\n corresponding internal injury mentioned under column\n No.21 with its consequences is sufficient to cause death in\n ordinary course of nature. Accordingly, the viscera was\n preserved. Vaginal, cervical and anal swabs kept for semen\n analysis. Swabs from bite site and control site kept for\n detection of saliva and comparison. Blood soaked gauzed\n piece kept for D.N.A. Analysis and comparison. Skin and\n tissue kept for D.N.A. Analysis. Hairs kept for\n comparison, if any. Blood soaked gauzed piece kept for\n blood group. Nail clippings kept for detection of foreign\n blood group. Skin and tissues kept for histopathological\n examination.\n\n 13. Above mentioned material packed, sealed, labled and\n handed over to N.P.C. Ganesh, B.No.215 of P.S. Parwa.\n\n The receipt of P.C. Ganesh is on Ex.31 on the reverse of\n Ex.35. It bears signature of Dr. R.R. Khetre on the top of\n Ex.35 with endorsement. I know his signature. The\n endorsement is at Ex.52.\n\n 14. My opinion as to cause of death is shock and\n haemorrhage following perineal tear with multiple\n injuries. There was forceful sexual assault on the child.\n The injury No.17 was caused by forceful insertion of\n penis. The post-mortem report bears my signature along\n with signatures of Doctors as named above. Contents are\n correct. It is at Ex.53.”\n\n In the cross-examination, the witness accepted that it was not\n\nmentioned in the Post Mortem Report that injury No.5 was caused by sharp\n\nedged teeth. The relevant part of the cross-examination was as under:-\n\n “It is true that the column no.17 note no.2 in respect of\n injury no.5 it is not mentioned that the injury is caused by\n\n\f 10\n\n sharp edged teeth. Witness volunteers that we had sent the\n sample for D.N.A. test. It is true that I had not specifically\n opined in P.M. report that injury No.5 of column no.17\n was caused by sharp edged teeth. It is not true that the\n injury by teeth bite cannot produce clean cut margin.”\n\n8.4 Chandrakant Narayan Bijapwar, a grocery shop owner was\n\nexamined as PW9. He stated that at about 7.00 p.m. on 11.02.2013 the\n\nAccused had come to his shop and had purchased Parle Biscuits and\n\nLaxminarayan Chiwada but he could not remember who was with the\n\nAccused at that time. The witness was, therefore, declared hostile.\n\n8.5 The Investigating Officer A.P.I. Pankaj Vanjari was examined as\n\nPW13 and deposed to the steps undertaken during investigation. He\n\ndeposed:-\n\n “On 20-2-2013 I had sent the letter to J.M.F.C. Ghatanji\n for recording the statements\n u/s 164\n of Cr.P.C. of the\n grandfather and Vikas Masram. The letter bears my\n signature. It is at Exh.81. Accordingly I received Exh.17.”\n\n Exhibit 17 is the statement of the grandfather of the victim under\n\n Section 164 of the Code. However, the record is not clear whether Vikas\n\n Meshram was examined under Section 164, and, if not, the reason for such\n\n non-examination. In cross-examination of this witness, a suggestion made\n\n to him was replied as under:-\n\n  The \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973\n\n\f 11\n\n “P.W.1 had stated that people beat the accused by fist\n and kick blows. It is mentioned in his statement:”\n\n8.6 Vikas Meshram was not examined in the trial as a witness.\n\nSimilarly, Baban Sambhaji Meshram, the father of the Appellant (referred\n\nto in the FIR); and Shrawan and Meshram (referred to in the deposition of\n\nPW2) were not examined as witnesses.\n\n9. In the examination of the Appellant under Section 313 of the Code,\n\nwhen the evidence of PW7 Dr. Ulhas Digambar Lingawar was put to him,\n\nthe Appellant stated that the evidence was false. Similar was his response,\n\nwhen the evidence that the blood of the victim was found on his full pant,\n\nwas put to him. His explanation to Question No.61 was:-\n\n “Q.61 : Do you want to explain as to why prosecution\n witnesses are deposing against you?\n\n Ans. : When I had gone to the house of deceased\n girl, her parents had a talk regarding the\n giving of human sacrifice of the deceased to\n find out the hidden treasure and after hearing\n it when I told them that if they do such act\n then I will lodge the report against them but\n they had lodged the false report against me\n and deposed falsely.”\n\n10. The Trial Court found that the following circumstances established\n\nthe guilt of the Appellant.\n\n “(i) The first circumstance is that the accused took away\n the deceased victim child from the lap of P.W.2,\n father-in-law of the complainant i.e. victim’s father\n by saying that the father of the deceased victim told\n him to bring the deceased victim to him.\n\n\f 12\n\n (ii) The second circumstance is that the deceased victim\n child was in the custody of the accused since the time\n he took her away from P.W.2.\n\n (iii) The third circumstance is that the deceased victim\n child was found lying isolated place where the\n construction of Anganwadi building was in progress\n and the accused was also found lying on the same\n spot near the deceased victim child.\n\n (iv) The fourth circumstance is that as per report Exh. 44\n issued by P.W.7 Dr. Lingawar, the injury of abrasion\n on tip of glance of penis was found on examination of\n the accused and he opined that the sign of sexual\n intercourse within 24 hours was present and it is due\n to sexual intercourse.\n\n (v) The fifth circumstance is that the pant of deceased\n victim child, pair of chappal of accused, pieces of\n flesh were seized from the spot of incident as per\n Exh.20.\n\n (vi) The sixth circumstance is that the pant, shirt and\n knicker with the stains of semen of the accused were\n seized as per seizure panchanama Exh.26.\n\n (vii)The seventh circumstance is that as per C.A. report\n Exh. 54 the blood present over the full pant of the\n accused was found to be of the deceased victim child\n and it shows the perfect matching with the blood of\n the deceased victim.\n\n (viii)The eighth circumstance is that as per postmortem\n report Exh.53 and opinion of Dr. Gadge who had\n conducted autopsy on the dead body of victim child,\n the injury No.17 was caused by forceful insertion of\n the penis as there was forceful sexual assault on the\n deceased victim child and the death of victim child\n was caused due to perineal tear and multiple injuries\n and the injuries were caused due to nibbling by teeth\n and bite marks were found over the parts of the body\n of deceased victim child. Even the pieces of flesh\n were also found on the spot of incident which shows\n the brutality in commission of crime.”\n\n10.1 Finding the Appellant guilty of the offences with which he was\n\ncharged, the Trial Court in its judgment dated 14.8.2015, stated:-\n\n\f 13\n\n “40. After declaring the accused guilty for the offences\n punishable under \nSection 376(1)(2)(f)(i)(m)\n of Indian\n Penal Code, under \nSection 376-A\n of Indian Penal Code,\n under \nSection 302\n of Indian Penal Code, and under\n \nSection 6\n of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences\n Act, I take a pause to hear the accused on the point of\n sentence.”\n\n10.2 Thereafter, on the same day, the Trial Court recorded:-\n\n “42. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the\n deceased victim was helpless child aged two years and the\n accused is related to her. The accused had committed rape\n and murder after taking away the victim child from her\n grandfather and as per the injuries described in P.M. report\n by P.W.10 Dr. Gadge, the accused had committed inhuman\n act because the victim child had sustained injury of\n perineal tear and injuries of bite marks and even the lips\n were removed and as per the injury No.17 the injury of\n perineal tear was caused by forceful sexual assault on the\n deceased victim child by the accused. Therefore, there are\n aggravating circumstances and the crime was well\n planned. It is further submitted that there is no chance of\n reformation of the accused. The learned Public Prosecutor\n has further submitted that the case falls under the category\n of ‘rarest of rare case’ for awarding death sentence. \nIn\n support of his submission he has placed reliance on the\n observations made by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case\n of \nVasanta Sampat Dupare vs. State of Maharashtra\n,\n reported in 2015 Cri. L.J. 774, in which the Hon’ble Apex\n Court has observed that,\n\n “The gullibility and vulnerability of the four\n years girl, who could not have nurtured any\n idea about the maladroitly designed biological\n desires of this nature, went with the uncle who\n extinguished her life spark. The barbaric act of\n the appellant does not remotely show any\n concern for the precious life of a young minor\n child who had really not seen life. The\n criminality of the conduct of the appellant is\n not only depraved and debased, but can have a\n menacing effect on the society”.\n\n 2015 Cr. L.J. 774 : (2015) 1 SCC 253\n\n\f 14\n\n It is also held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the\n cited ruling that,\n\n “A helpless and defenceless child gets raped and\n murdered because of the acquaintance of the\n appellant with the people of the society. This is\n not only betrayal of an individual trust but\n destruction and devastation of social trust. It is\n perversity in its enormity. It irrefragably invites\n the extreme abhorrence and indignation of the\n collective. It is an anthema to the social balance.\n It meets the test of rarest of rare case and\n therefore, death sentence is affirmed.”\n\n 43. The learned Public Prosecutor has further submitted\n that the prosecution case as per the ruling cited supra in\n which the death sentence was awarded was also based on\n circumstantial evidence and it was considered in the\n category of rarest of rare cases.\n\n \n44. Having regard to the facts and circumstances and\n evidence on record, I am inclined to accept the argument\n advanced by the learned Public Prosecutor because in the\n facts of the ruling cited supra [\nWakkar and another vs.\n State of U.P.\n] by the learned defence counsel, there were\n two accused and it was not possible to discern and arrive\n at any definite conclusion as to the role played by each of\n the accused.\n \nHere in the present case there is only one\n accused who committed rape and murder of the helpless\n and innocent child aged two years, therefore, ruling\n [\nVasanta Dupare vs. State of Maharashtra6\n] is applicable to\n the present case.\n\n 45. It is necessary to mention that brutality in committing\n rape on the deceased victim child aged two years and\n taking away the life of deceased victim child is required to\n be taken into consideration for coming to the conclusion\n that the case is rarest of rare one warranting imposition of\n death sentence.\n\n 46. The deceased victim female child aged two years only\n was innocent and helpless child. Having regard to the facts\n and circumstances of the crime and considering the\n relevant factors, sentence of life imprisonment appears to\n be inadequate punishment and I am of the opinion that this\n is the case which falls in the category of rarest or rare\n cases warranting the imposition of death sentence for the\n offence punishable under Section 376-A of Indian Penal\n\n (2011) 3 SCC 306\n\n\f 15\n\n Code and for offence punishable under \nSection 302\n of\n Indian Penal Code.”\n\n10.3 The Trial Court thus, by its order passed on the same day awarded\n\nDeath Sentence to the Appellant on two counts, i.e. under \nSection 302\n of\n\nIPC and under \nSection 376-A\n of IPC; Rigorous Imprisonment for life under\n\ntwo counts, i.e. Section 376(1)(2)(f), (i) and (m) of \nIPC\n and under \nSection 6\n\nof POCSO Act. The Death Sentence was subject to confirmation by the\n\nHigh Court.\n\n11. The matter concerning confirmation of Death Sentence and the\n\nsubstantive appeal by the Appellant against his conviction were dealt with\n\ntogether and by its judgment and order presently under appeal, the\n\nconviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court were affirmed by the\n\nHigh Court. It was observed by the High Court:\n\n \n“37. By applying yardstick set by the Apex Court in the\n case of \nBachan Singh v. State of Punjab\n  and \nMachhi\n Singh and others v. State of Punjab\n (cited supra) and the\n observations of this Court in the matter of Rakesh Kamble\n if the present matter is considered, in our opinion, in the\n guideline of aggravating circumstances, there is a mention\n of clause (b) which deal with the murder which involves\n exceptional depravity. In the light of the clause, if the\n present matter is seen, the record reveals that the victim is\n a child of two and half years of age. The victim was\n subjected to a forceful sexual exploitation. The medical\n evidence shows that the death is caused due to the forceful\n intercourse. In our opinion, the present case also covers\n clause (a) of “aggravating circumstances” wherein it is\n referred that if a murder is committed after previous\n planning and involves extreme brutality. In the present\n matter, a child was taken from the custody of the\n\n (1980) 2 SCC 684\n (1983) 3 SCC 470\n\n\f 16\n\n grandfather and in spite of his resistance, a child was\n subjected to sexual violence and then was done to death.\n In our opinion, the act of the appellant/accused falls in\n clauses (a) and (b) of the “aggravating circumstances”.\n\nWe would also take into consideration the mitigating\n circumstances referred to in the judgment of the Apex\n Court in the case of \nBachan Singh v. State of Punjab\n (cited\n supra). In our opinion, the only mitigating circumstance\n on which the appellant/accused seeks benefit of clause (2)\n i.e. the accused is a young boy. Even though the said\n mitigating circumstance of being of young age is available\n to the appellant/accused while balancing the aggravating\n and mitigating factors, we are of the opinion that the said\n mitigating circumstance would not be of any help to the\n appellant/accused.\n\n … … …\n\n \n41. In the present case also, the accused is the maternal\n uncle of the victim child. The Apex Court recently in the\n matter of \nPurushottam Dashrath Borate and another v.\n State of Maharashtra\n (cited supra), wherein the victim\n deceased who was serving in a private company and was\n subjected to rape and murder at the hands of the security\n guard and was awarded death sentence on consideration of\n the submission that the appellant/accused is a person of\n young age, observed that such compassionate grounds are\n present in most of the cases and are not relevant for\n interference in awarding death sentence. The Apex Court\n further observed that the principle that when the offence is\n gruesome and was committed in a calculated and\n diabolical manner, the age of the accused may not be a\n relevant factor.\n\n “15. In our opinion, the measure of\n punishment in a given case must depend upon\n the atrocity of the crime; the conduct of the\n criminal and the defenceless and unprotected\n state of the victim. Imposition of appropriate\n punishment is the manner in which the Courts\n respond to the society’s cry for justice against\n the criminals. Justice demands that Courts\n should impose punishment befitting the crime\n so that the Courts reflect public abhorrence of\n the crime. The Courts must not only keep in\n view the rights of the criminal but also the\n rights of the victim of crime and the society at\n\n (2015) 6 SCC 652\n\n\f 17\n\n large while considering imposition of\n appropriate punishment.”\n\nThe Apex Court also made it clear that lack of criminal\nantecedents also cannot be considered as mitigating\ncircumstances, particularly taking into consideration, the\nnature of heinous offence and cold and calculated manner\nin which it was committed by the accused persons.\n\n42. The Apex Court in the matter of \nVasanta Sampat\nDupare v. State of Maharashtra6\n (cited supra), wherein the\nvictim was a girl of four years of age and the\nappellant/accused, a neighbour luring the victim for giving\nher chocolate, raped her and done her to death by hit of\nstones. The Apex Court on the backdrop of the medical\nevidence, namely the victim was subjected to forceful\nsexual intercourse, the deceased was last seen with the\naccused and the immediate lodgement of report by the\nfather of the girl, lending credence to the prosecution case,\nobserved thus:\n\n “60. In the case at hand, as we find, not only\n was the rape committed in a brutal manner, but\n murder was also committed in a barbaric\n manner. The rape of a minor girl child is\n nothing but a monstrous burial of her dignity\n in the darkness. It is a crime against the holy\n body of a girl child and the soul of society and\n such a crime is aggravated by the manner in\n which it has been committed. The nature of\n the crime and the manner in which it has been\n committed speaks about its uncommonness.\n The crime speaks of depravity, degradation\n and uncommonality. It is diabolical and\n barbaric. The crime was committed in an\n inhuman manner. Indubitably, these go a long\n way to establish the aggravating\n circumstances.\n\n 61. We are absolutely conscious that\n mitigating circumstances are to be taken into\n consideration. The learned Counsel for the\n appellant pointing out the mitigating\n circumstances would submit that the appellant\n is in his mid-fifties and there is possibility of\n his reformation. Be it noted, the appellant was\n aged about forty seven years at the time of\n commission of the crime. As is noticeable,\n there has been no remorse on the part of\n appellant. There are cases when this Court has\n\n\f 18\n\n commuted the death sentence to life finding\n that the accused has expressed remorse or the\n crime was not premeditated. But the obtaining\n factual matrix when unfolded stage by stage\n would show the premeditation, the proclivity\n and the rapacious desire. The learned Counsel\n would submit that the appellant had no\n criminal antecedents but we find that he was a\n history-sheeter and had a number of cases\n pending against him. That alone may not be\n sufficient. The appalling cruelty shown by\n him to the minor girl child is extremely\n shocking and it gets accentuated, when his age\n is taken into consideration. It was not\n committed under any mental stress or\n emotional disturbance and it is difficult to\n comprehend that he would not commit such\n acts and would be reformed or rehabilitated.\n\n As the circumstances would graphically\n depict, he would remain a menace to society,\n for a defenceless child has become his prey. In\n our considered opinion, there are no mitigating\n circumstances.\n\n 62. As we perceive, this case deserves to\n fall in the category of the rarest of rare cases.\n It is inconceivable from the perspective of the\n society that a married man aged about two\n scores and seven makes a four years minor\n innocent girl child the prey of his lust and\n deliberately causes her death. A helpless and\n defenceless child gets raped and murdered\n because of the acquaintance of the appellant\n with the people of the society. This is not only\n betrayal of an individual trust but destruction\n and devastation of social trust. It is perversity\n in its enormity. It irrefragably invites the\n extreme abhorrence and indignation of the\n collective. It is an anathema to the social\n balance. In our view, it meets the test of the\n rarest of the rare case and we unhesitatingly so\n hold.”\n\n With this view, the High Court upheld the conviction and sentence\n\nas recorded by the Trial Court and confirmed the Death Sentence.\n\n\f 19\n\n12. As the Death Sentence and life imprisonment have been awarded\n\non two counts each, the statutory changes that the concerned provisions of\n\nthe IPC and POCSO Act have undergone may briefly be adverted to:-\n\nA. Before 03.02.2013, the relevant portions of \nSections 375\n, \n376\n and\n\n376A\n of IPC were as under:-\n\n “375.

On 03.02.2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013\n\n(No.3 of 2013), hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance was promulgated\n\nby the President of India. \nSection 8\n of the Ordinance inter alia substituted\n\n\f 21\n\nSections 375\n, \n376\n and \n376A\n of IPC; the relevant text of the substituted\n\nprovisions being:-\n\n “375.

Section 9 of the Amendment Act inter alia\n\nsubstituted \nSections 375\n, \n376\n and \n376A\n of IPC as under:-\n\n “375. A man is said to commit “rape” if he-\n\n (a) penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina,\n mouth, urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so\n with him or any other person; or\n\n (b) …..\n\n (c) …..\n\n (d) …..\n\n\f 24\n\n under the circumstances falling under any of the\nfollowing seven descriptions: -\n\nFirst.- Against her will.\n\nSecondly.- Without her consent.\n\nThirdly.- …..\n\nFourthly.-…..\n\nFifthly. …..\n\nSixthly.-With or without her consent, when she is under\neighteen years of age.\n\nSeventhly.- …..\n\nExplanation 1……\n\nExplanation 2……\nException 1……\n\nException 2…..\n\n376.

(1) The Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013\n is hereby repealed.\n\n (2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any\n action taken under the \nIndian Penal Code\n, the \nCode of\n Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 and the Indian Evidence Act,\n\n\f 26\n\n 1872, as amended by the said Ordinance, shall be deemed\n to have been done or taken under the corresponding\n provisions of those Acts, as amended by this Act.”\n\nD. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 (Act 22 of 2018)\n\nwhich came into effect from 21.04.2018, deleted clause (i) of \nSection\n\n376(2)\n of IPC and added sub-section (3) after Section 376(2) as well as\n\ninserted Section 376AB as under:\n\n “376 … … …\n\n (3) Whoever, commits rape on a woman under sixteen\n years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment\n for a term which shall not be less than twenty years, but\n which may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall\n mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s\n natural life, and shall also be liable to fine:\n\n … … …\n\n “376AB- Punishment for rape on woman under twelve\n years of age- Whoever, commits rape on a woman under\n twelve years of age shall be punished with rigorous\n imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than\n twenty years, but which may extend to imprisonment for\n life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of\n that person’s natural life, and with fine or with death:\n\n … … …”\n\n Since the offence in the instant case was committed well before\n\n21.04.2018, we are not called upon to consider the effect of Act 22 of\n\n2018 but the provisions are noted for the sake of completeness.\n\nE. \nSections 5\n and \n6\n of the POCSO Act, at the time when the offence\n\nwas committed in the instant case, provided: -\n\n\f 27\n\n“5: Aggravated penetrative sexual assault-\n\na) …..\n\nb) …..\n\nc) …..\n\nd) ……\n\ne) …..\n\nf) …..\n\ng) …..\n\nh) ….\n\ni) …..\n\nj) Whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a\nchild, which-\n\n (i) Physically incapacitates the child or causes the\n child to become mentally ill as defined under\n clause (b) of \nsection 2\n of the mental health\n Act, 1987 (14 of 1987) or causes impairment\n of any kind so as to render the child unable to\n perform regular tasks, temporarily or\n permanently;\n\n (ii) In the case of female child, makes the child\n pregnant as a consequence of sexual assault;\n\n (iii) Inflicts the child with Human\n Immunodeficiency Virus or any other life-\n\n threatening disease or infection which may\n either temporarily or permanently impair the\n child by rendering him physically\n incapacitated, or mentally ill to perform\n regular tasks;\n\nk) …..\n\nl) …..\n\nm) Whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a\nchild below twelve years; or\n\nn) …..\n\no) …..\n\np) …..\n\nq) …..\n\nr) …..\n\ns) …..\n\nt) …..\n\nu) …..\n\n“6. Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault.\n– Whoever, commits aggravated penetrative sexual\n\n\f 28\n\n assault, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for\n a term which shall not be less than ten years but which\n may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be\n liable to fine.”\n\n By virtue of the \nProtection of Children from Sexual Offences\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2019\n (Act 25 of 2019) which came into effect on\n\n16.08.2019, sub-Clause (iv) was inserted in Clause (j) of \nSection 5\n as\n\nunder:-\n\n “(iv) causes death of the child; or”\n\n Further, \nSection 6\n was substituted as under:-\n\n “6. Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault.-\n\n (1) Whoever commits aggravated penetrative sexual\n assault shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a\n term which shall not be less than twenty years, but which\n may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean\n imprisonment for the remainder of natural life of that\n person, and shall also be liable to fine, or with death.\n\n (2) The fine imposed under sub-section (1) shall be just\n and reasonable and paid to the victim to meet the medical\n expenses and rehabilitation of such victim.”\n\n13. If the abovementioned provisions of \nIPC\n are considered in three\n\ncompartments, that is to say,\n\n (A) The situation obtaining before 03.02.2013\n\n (B) The situation in existence during 03.02.2013 to 02.04.2013 and,\n\n (C) The situation obtaining after 02.04.2013:\n\n following features emerge: -\n\n\f 29\n\n(i) The offence under Section 375, as is clear from the\n\n definition of relevant provision in compartment (A),\n\n could be committed against a woman. The situation\n\n was sought to be changed and made gender neutral in\n\n compartment (B). However, the earlier position now\n\n stands restored as a result of provisions in\n\n compartment (C)\n\n(ii) Before 03.02.2013 the sentence for an offence under\n\n Section 376(1) could not be less than seven years but\n\n the maximum sentence could be life imprisonment;\n\n and for an offence under Section 376(2) the minimum\n\n sentence could not be less than ten years while the\n\n maximum sentence could be imprisonment for life.\n\n Section 376A dealt with cases where a man\n\n committed non-consensual sexual intercourse with\n\n his wife in certain situations.\n\n(iii) As a result of the Ordinance, the sentences for\n\n offences under Sections 376(1) and 376(2) were\n\n retained in the same fashion. However, a new\n\n provision in the form of Section 376A was\n\n incorporated under which, if while committing an\n\n\f 30\n\n offence punishable under sub-section (1) or sub-\n\n section (2) of Section 376, a person “inflicts an\n\n injury which causes the death” of the victim, the\n\n accused could be punished with rigorous\n\n imprisonment for a term “which shall not be less\n\n than 20 years but which may extend to imprisonment\n\n for life, which shall mean the remainder of that\n\n person’s natural life or with death”. Thus, for the\n\n first time, Death Sentence could be imposed if a fatal\n\n injury was caused during the commission of offence\n\n under sub-section (1) or (2) of Section 376.\n\n(iv) Though the provisions of the Amendment Act\n\n restored the original non gender-neutral position vis-\n\n à-vis the victim, it made certain changes in sub-\n\n section (2) of Section 376. Now, the punishment for\n\n the offence could be rigorous imprisonment for not\n\n less than ten years which could extend to\n\n imprisonment for life, “which shall mean\n\n imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s\n\n natural life”. It was, thus, statutorily made clear that\n\n\f 31\n\n the imprisonment for life would mean till the last\n\n breath of that person’s natural life.\n\n (V) Similarly, by virtue of the Amendment Act, for the\n\n offence under Section 376A, the punishment could\n\n not be less than 20 years which may extend to\n\n imprisonment for life which shall mean\n\n imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s\n\n natural life, or with death.\n\n14. In the instant case, the offence was committed on 11.02.2013\n\nwhen the provisions of the Ordinance were in force. However, the\n\nAmendment Act having been given retrospective effect from 03.02.2013,\n\nthe question arises whether imposition of life sentence for the offence\n\nunder Section 376(2) could “mean imprisonment for the remainder of that\n\nperson’s natural life”.\n\n In the present case, since the victim was about two and half years\n\nof age at the time of incident and since it was the Ordinance which was\n\nholding the field, going by the provisions of the Ordinance, Clauses (f),\n\n(h) and (l) of Section 376(2) would get attracted. The comparable\n\nprovisions of Section 376(2) as amended by the Amendment Act would\n\nbe, Clauses (f), (i) and (m) respectively. As the substantive penal\n\nprovisions under the Clauses (f), (h) and (l) as inserted by the Ordinance\n\n\f 32\n\nand Clauses (f), (i) and (m) as inserted by the Amendment Act are\n\nidentical, no difficulty on that count is presented. But the sentence\n\nprescribed by Section 376(2) as amended by the Amendment Act, has\n\nnow, for the first time provided that the imprisonment for life “shall mean\n\nimprisonment for the remainder of that person’s natural life”. This\n\nprovision comes with retrospective effect and in a situation where such\n\nprescription was not available on the statute when the offence was\n\ncommitted, the question arises whether such ex-post facto prescription\n\nwould be consistent with the provisions of sub-Article (1) of \nArticle 20\n of\n\nthe Constitution.\n\n15. An imposition of life sentence simpliciter does not put any\n\nrestraints on the power of the executive to grant remission and\n\ncommutation in exercise of its statutory power, subject of course to Section\n\n433A of the Code. But, a statutory prescription that it “shall mean the\n\nremainder of that person’s life” will certainly restrain the executive from\n\nexercising any such statutory power and to that extent the concerned\n\nprovision definitely prescribes a higher punishment ex-post facto. In the\n\nprocess, the protection afforded by \nArticle 20(1)\n of the Constitution would\n\nstand negated. We must, therefore, declare that the punishment under\n\nSection 376(2)\n of the IPC in the present case cannot come with stipulation\n\nthat the life imprisonment “shall mean the remainder of that person’s life”.\n\n\f 33\n\nSimilar prescription in \nSection 6\n of the POCSO Act, which came by way\n\nof amendment in 2019, would not be applicable and the governing\n\nprovision for punishment for the offence under the \nPOCSO Act\n must be\n\ntaken to be the pre-amendment position as noted hereinabove.\n\n16. However, in so far as the situation covered by \nSection 376A\n of IPC\n\nas amended by the Amendment Act is concerned, substantively identical\n\nsituation was dealt with by Section 376A as amended by the Ordinance and\n\nthe prescription of sentence in Section 376A by the Amendment Act is\n\nidentical to that prescribed by Section 376A as amended by the Ordinance.\n\nSection 376A as amended by the Ordinance being gender neutral so far as\n\nvictim was concerned, naturally covered cases where a victim was a\n\nwoman. Thus, the ex-post facto effect given to Section 376A by the\n\nAmendment Act from the day the Ordinance was promulgated, would not\n\nin way be inconsistent with the provisions of sub-Article (1) of \nArticle 20\n\nof the Constitution.\n\n17. Having considered the legal provisions involved in the matter, we\n\nnow turn to the submissions advanced by the learned counsel.\n\n17.1 Ms. Sonia Mathur, learned Senior Advocate for the Appellant\n\nsubmitted: -\n\n\f 34\n\nA) While noting eight circumstances against the Appellant, certain\n\ncircumstances were ignored by the Courts below, namely:-\n\n (i) Both the lips of the victim showed clean cut margins\n\n indicating that the injuries were suffered by a weapon and not by a\n\n human bite. Further, odontology report was not furnished to\n\n substantiate the theory that the injuries could be by a human bite\n\n and by the Appellant.\n\n (ii) The vaginal, cervical, and anal swabs were sent for forensic\n\n examination but none of these could be associated with the\n\n Appellant.\n\n These important facets pointing towards innocence of the Appellant\n\nwere completely disregarded.\n\nB) Each of the circumstances found against the Appellant, was then\n\ndealt with as under :-\n\n (i) PWs 1 and 2 were not independent witnesses to prove the\n\n first circumstance that the victim was taken away by the\n\n Appellant. There were discrepancies in the statements of PWs 1\n\n and 2. On the other hand witnesses such as Shravan, Vitthal\n\n Ghodam and Vikas Meshram were not examined at all. Even the\n\n\f 35\n\nwife of PW2 whose presence was referred to in the statement of\n\nPW2 under Section 164 of the Code, was not examined.\n\n(ii) The fact that the victim was always in the custody of the\n\nAppellant since the time she was taken away from PW2, was not\n\nproved. PW9 was examined to establish this circumstance but did\n\nnot support the prosecution. Moreover, Vikas Meshram who\n\nallegedly saw the victim with the Appellant was also not\n\nexamined.\n\n(iii) The spot where the victim was found lying was not an\n\nisolated place but was in the middle of the village surrounded by\n\nhouses. No independent witness was examined to corroborate the\n\nversion of PWs 1 and 2. Independent witnesses like Shravan,\n\nVitthal Ghodam and Vikas Meshram were not examined. The\n\ninitial noting in the form of GD entry 40/13 (which was referred\n\nto in the FIR) mentioned that the Appellant took away the victim\n\nto the jungle and killed her.\n\n(iv) The Appellant was examined at the time of arrest but the\n\nmedical evidence in that behalf was not placed on record.\n\nHowever, the prosecution chose to rely on the medical evidence\n\nthrough the opinion of PW7 Dr. Lingawar.\n\n\f 36\n\n(v) The spot panchnama was done at 8:30 a.m. next day i.e.\n\nmore than eight hours after the arrest of the Appellant. The\n\nchappals found at the spot were not sent for any examination, nor\n\nwas any evidence led to show that they belonged to the Appellant.\n\nThough, the pieces of flesh seized from the spot were sent for\n\nforensic examination, there was nothing on record to show that\n\nthe flesh was of a human being and of the victim.\n\n(vi) The FSL report did not find any semen on any of the articles\n\nsent for examination and the finding rendered by the Courts below\n\nin so far as 6th circumstance was thus erroneous.\n\n(vii) There were discrepancies in the chain of custody of the\n\nclothes referred to in the 7th circumstance. At the time of his\n\narrest no blood was noticed on the clothes of the Appellant.\n\nPW13, the Investigating officer accepted that he “did not find any\n\nsuspicious thing” with the Appellant. Even when the Appellant\n\nwas examined by PW7 Dr. Ulhas Digambar Lingawar, no blood\n\nwas detected. The seizure report also did not disclose any\n\npresence of blood spots on the clothes of the Appellant. The\n\ntrousers of the Appellant were in police custody from 12.02.2013\n\n\f 37\n\n till 14.02.2013 and no malkhana record or witnesses were\n\n produced.\n\n It would, therefore, be highly unlikely that “moderate\n\n number of blood stains ranging from 0.1 to 2cm mostly on front\n\n portion” found in the FSL report could have been missed out at\n\n the earlier stages. The evidence would therefore be unworthy of\n\n reliance.\n\n Further, there was a requisition for videography of the post\n\n mortem and yet no video-graphs were placed on record, in the\n\n absence of which the material sent for DNA examination could\n\n not be relied upon.\n\n (viii) The record certainly indicated that the victim was sexually\n\n assaulted but the eighth circumstance did not by itself establish\n\n that the Appellant was the author of crime.\n\nC) The facts on record did not conclusively establish the guilt of the\n\nAppellant. Since the case was based on circumstantial evidence, going by\n\nthe principles \nlaid down by\n this Court, the case was not established at all.\n\n17.2 While dealing with the question of sentence Ms. Mathur, learned\n\nSenior Advocate submitted: -\n\n\f 38\n\nI) The sentence of death having been passed on the same day when the\n\n conviction order was pronounced, there was non-compliance of\n\n Section 235(2) of the Code and as laid down by this Court in\n\n Allauddin Mian v. State of Bihar, Malkiat Singh and others v.\n\n State of Punjab and Ajay Pandit v. State of Maharashtra, the\n\n infraction on that count was sufficient to consider commutation of\n\n the sentence of death to that of life imprisonment.\n\nII) The instant case being based on circumstantial evidence, as held by\n\n this Court in \nBishnu Prasad Sinha v. State of Assam\n, \nSebastian @\n\n Chevithiyan v. State of Kerala\n, \nPurna Chandra Kusal v. State of\n\n Orissa\n and \nKalu Khan v. State of Rajasthan\n , no death sentence be\n\n awarded and the appropriate punishment could be life sentence.\n\nIII) Relying on the decisions of this Court in \nAshok Debabarma @\n\n Achak Debbarma v. State of Tripura\n, \nSudam v. State\n of\n\n Maharashtraand Ravishankar alias \nBaba Vishwakarma vs. State\n\n of Madhya Pradesh\n, it was submitted that even if the circumstances\n\n (1989) 3 SCC 5 para 10\n (1991) 4 SCC 341 para 18\n (2012) 8 SCC 43 para 47\n (2007) 11 SCC 467 para 55\n (2010) 1 SCC 58 para 17\n (2011) 15 SCC 352 para 7\n (2015) 16 SCC 492 paras 16, 23 and 31\n (2014) 4 SCC 747\n (2019) 9 SCC 388\n (2019) 9 SCC 689\n\n\f 39\n\n on record were sufficient to record conviction against the Appellant,\n\n there were gaps in the evidence and the benefit of “residual doubt”\n\n ought to be extended in favour of the Appellant.\n\nIV) In terms of law \nlaid down by\n this Court in \nRajesh Kumar v. State\n\n through Government of NCT of Delhi, the burden was on the\n\n prosecution to rule out the possibility of reformation of the\n\n Appellant and that as held in \nMohinder Singh v. State of Punjab\n,\n\n the exclusion of possibility of reformation could only be on the basis\n\n of evidence led by the prosecution.\n\nV) The Appellant completed Bachelors Preparatory programme (BPP)\n\n from Indira Gandhi National Open University in 2017 while in\n\n prison and is presently pursuing Bachelors Degree course in Arts.\n\nVI) The Appellant was about 21 years of age at the time of incident and\n\n as held by this Court in \nBachan Singh v. State of Punjab8\n,\n\n \nRameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) v. State of Gujarat\n, \nAmit v.\n\n State of U.P.\n and \nSunil v. State of M.P.\n, the young age of the\n\n Appellant at the time of incident is a factor in his favour.\n\nVII) The socio-economic condition of the Appellant showed that he was a\n\n labourer and belonged to Scheduled Tribes which again would be a\n (2011) 13 SCC 706 paras 72 to 74\n (2013) 3 SCC 294, paras 22, 23\n (2011) 2 SCC 764 paras 8 and 10\n (2012) 4 SCC 107 para 22\n (2017) 4 SCC 393 para 12\n\n\f 40\n\n factor in his favour as held by this Court in \nSunil Damodar\n\n Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra\n.\n\nVIII) The family of the Appellant being in touch with the him, there is a\n\n strong probability of rehabilitation as observed by this Court in\n\n \nMohinder Singh v. State of Punjab22\n.\n\nIX) Further, as there were no criminal antecedents as has been ruled by\n\n this Court in Surendra Pal Shivbalak Pal v. State of Gujarat ,\n\n \nMahesh Dhanaji Shinde v. State of Maharashtra\n.\n \n, \nSantosh\n\n Kumar Singh v. State of M.P.\n  and \nShyam Singh @ Bhima v. State\n\n of Madhya Pradesh\n, due weightage ought to be given in favour of\n\n the Appellant.\n\n17.3 Mr. Sushil Karanjkar, learned Advocate for the State submitted that\n\nall the aforesaid eight circumstances were individually established beyond\n\nany doubt and they collectively formed a clear and consistent chain ruling\n\nout every other hypothesis except the guilt of the Appellant. It was\n\nsubmitted that as held by this Court in \nB. A. Umesh vs. Registrar General,\n\nHigh\n Court of Karnataka and subsequent cases, the mere fact that the\n\n (2014) 1 SCC 129 para 20\n (2005) 3 SCC 127 para 13\n (2014) 4 SCC 292 paras 38 and 39\n (2014) 12 SCC 650 para 30\n (2017) 11 SCC 265 paras 6 and 8\n (2017) 4 SCC 124\n\n\f 41\n\n death sentence was pronounced on the same day when the conviction was\n\n recorded, by itself would not be sufficient to commute the death sentence\n\n to life imprisonment; and that the Appellant had sufficient opportunity to\n\n advance submissions on the issue of sentence which opportunity was\n\n availed of. He also submitted that the circumstances having been\n\n established beyond any shadow of doubt there was no room for any\n\n “residual doubt”.\n \nIn his submission, the factors that the crime in the instant\n\n case was gruesome and diabolical, where two and a half year old girl was\n\n subjected to sexual assault and the manner in which it was committed,\n\n were by themselves weighty and sufficient to tilt the balance against the\n\n Appellant and that as \nlaid down by\n this Court in \nVasanta Sampat Dupare\n\n v. State of Maharashtra6\n, in review arising therefrom (in \nVasanta Sampat\n\n Dupare v. State of Maharashtra\n), and in \nMukesh and Another v. State\n\n ( NCT of Delhi) and Others\n, the extreme depravity and the barbaric\n\n manner in which the crime was committed would clearly outweigh any\n\n mitigating circumstance advanced on behalf of the Appellant.\n\n \n18. We shall first consider the evidence on record to see whether the\n\n guilt of the Appellant is conclusively established on the strength of the\n\n material on record; and whether the circumstances on record form a clear\n\n and consistent chain to rule out every other hypothesis except the guilt of\n (2017) 6 SCC 631\n  (2017) 6 SCC 1\n\n\f 42\n\nthe Appellant. The law on the point is clear from the following\n\nobservations of this Court in \nSharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of\n\nMaharashtra\n,\n\n “153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the\n following conditions must be fulfilled before a case\n against an accused can be said to be fully established:\n\n (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion\n of guilt is to be drawn should be fully\n established.\n\n \nIt may be noted here that this Court indicated that the\n circumstances concerned “must or should” and not “may\n be” established. There is not only a grammatical but a\n legal distinction between “may be proved” and “must be\n or should be proved” as was held by this Court in \nShivaji\n Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra\n where the\n observations were made:\n\n “Certainly, it is a primary principle that the\n accused must be and not merely may be guilty\n before a court can convict and the mental distance\n between ‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is long and\n divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.”\n\n (2) the facts so established should be consistent\n only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the\n accused, that is to say, they should not be\n explainable on any other hypothesis except\n that the accused is guilty,\n\n (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive\n nature and tendency,\n\n (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis\n except the one to be proved, and\n\n (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete\n as not to leave any reasonable ground for the\n conclusion consistent with the innocence of\n\n (1984) 4 SCC 116\n (1973) 2 SCC 793\n\n\f 43\n\n the accused and must show that in all human\n probability the act must have been done by the\n accused.”\n\n These principles have since then been followed consistently.\n\n18.1 According to the prosecution, on the day in question at about 7:30\n\np.m. when the victim was with her grandfather, on the pretext that the\n\nfather of the victim had asked the Appellant to bring the victim, the\n\nAppellant, who was maternal uncle of the victim, took her away. This part\n\nof the evidence is conclusively established through the testimony of PW2,\n\nthe grandfather. This version finds mention in the FIR which was recorded\n\nwithin few hours of the incident and in the statement of PW2 recorded\n\nunder Section 164 of the Code. There is nothing on record to doubt the\n\nveracity of said version. It is true that some other witnesses were not\n\nexamined by the prosecution but the strength of the testimony of PW2 does\n\nnot get diminished on any count nor can it be said that his testimony loses\n\nits weight because the witness was the grandfather of the victim. The\n\nversion coming through this witness is cogent, consistent and also figured\n\nin prompt reporting of the FIR. We have, therefore, no hesitation in\n\naccepting that the first circumstance as noted by the Trial Court stands\n\nconclusively established.\n\n\f 44\n\n18.2 As deposed by PWs 1 and 2, the Appellant was found by the side\n\nof the victim at the spot i.e. in the premises of Anganwadi. The victim\n\nwas having various injuries whereafter she was taken for medical\n\nattention. Soon after the incident, the Appellant was also medically\n\nexamined and Report Exbt. 46 showed injury on his body. Even if PW9\n\nhad turned hostile and some other witnesses were not examined, the fact\n\nthat the victim was always in the custody of Appellant till she was found\n\nat the spot alongside the Appellant is quite clear. The proximity in terms\n\nof time and the promptitude in reporting are crucial factors and the\n\nevidence in that behalf is completely trustworthy. Thus, in our view, the\n\nsecond and third circumstances are also fully established.\n\n18.3 Soon after his arrest, the Appellant was produced for medical\n\nexamination before PW 7 Dr. Ulhas Digambar Lingawar, who found\n\ninjury on private parts of the Appellant. The approximate time of said\n\ninjury as given in the opinion Exh.46 is consistent with the case of\n\nprosecution. The submission however is that the Appellant was also\n\nexamined by another medical professional and that report was not placed\n\non record. The reference to the medical examination of the Appellant in\n\nterms of Section 53A of the Code was not to any other medical\n\nprofessional but to PW 7 Dr. Lingawar. No explanation, not even a\n\nsuggestion came from the Appellant how there could be an injury on his\n\n\f 45\n\nbody as noticed in Report Exh.46. Thus, the 4th circumstance also stands\n\nfully established.\n\n18.4 While considering the 5th circumstance, it must be stated that as\n\nper record, the chappals were not proved to be that of the Appellant and\n\nthe pieces of flesh found at the spot of incident were also not proved to be\n\nthat of a human being. To that extent, 5 th circumstance was not proved at\n\nall. However, the fact that the pant of the victim was found at the spot of\n\nincident is well established on record, and the 5 th circumstance must be\n\ntaken to be proved only with respect to the recovery of the pant of the\n\nvictim.\n\n18.5 There is nothing on record to show that the stains of semen found\n\non clothing referred to in 6th circumstance, were medically proved to be\n\nthat of, or could be associated with the Appellant. The 6 th circumstance\n\ncannot therefore be taken to be pointing against the Appellant.\n\n18.6 In terms of Chemical Analyser’s Report Ext.54, the blood found\n\non the trousers of the Appellant was that of the victim. This fact is\n\ncompletely established. The submission however, is:-\n\n (a) Nothing suspicious was found by PW13 the Investigating\n\n Officer with the Appellant at the time of his arrest; and\n\n\f 46\n\n (b) PW7 Dr. Lingawar had not noticed any blood stains on the\n\n trousers of the Appellant at the time of his medical examination;\n\n (c) No malkhana report or evidence was produced on record to\n\n state that the articles remained in proper custody and in sealed\n\n condition.\n\n The answer given by the Investigating Officer cannot be stretched\n\nto say that there were no blood stains on his trousers at the time of arrest.\n\nThe medical opinion was obtained to consider whether there were any\n\ninjuries on the private parts of the Appellant and whether he was capable\n\nof having sexual intercourse. The facts on record show that the articles\n\nwere sent for FSL examination at the earliest.\n\n The Appellant was represented by a counsel of standing in the\n\nTrial Court. The theory that the blood spots on the trousers of the\n\nAppellant were subsequently planted was not even developed in the cross\n\nexamination of the concerned witnesses.\n\n Given the quick succession of steps in investigation, including the\n\nmedical examination and seizure of the clothes of the Appellant, we do\n\nnot find any infirmity. We, therefore, accept that the 7 th circumstance\n\nstands fully established.\n\n18.7 It is a matter of record that as per Post-Mortem report and medical\n\nopinion, there was forceful sexual assault on the victim and her death was\n\n\f 47\n\ncaused due to injury No.17 which was in the nature of multiple lacerations\n\nover vaginal and anal region; and merging of vaginal and anal orifices.\n\n The 8th circumstance must therefore be taken to be proved fully\n\nexcept to the extent that said circumstance makes reference to pieces of\n\nflesh found at the spot of incident.\n\n19. Do the circumstances established on record satisfy the\n\nrequirements spelt out in the decision of this Court in Sharad Birdhichand\n\nSarda34 is the next question for consideration.\n\n The established circumstances show:-\n\n a) The victim was in the custody of the Appellant, from the time\n\n she was taken from her grandfather till she was found lying in\n\n the premises of Anganwadi; where the Appellant was also\n\n found lying next to her.\n\n b) The victim, who was hale and hearty when she was taken by\n\n the Appellant, had number of injuries on her body when she\n\n was found next to the Appellant.\n\n c) The injuries on the body of the victim show that she was\n\n abused and sexually exploited.\n\n d) The sexual assault was so forceful that the victim, a two-and-a-\n\n half-year-old girl suffered, among other injuries, Injury No.17.\n\n\f 48\n\n e) Injury No.17, as described above, was so severe that there was\n\n merging of vaginal and anal orifices.\n\n f) The victim died because of Injury No.17.\n\n g) The Appellant had an injury on his private parts corresponding\n\n to the period when the victim was in his custody.\n\n h) The Appellant was found to be capable of having sexual\n\n intercourse.\n\n i) The trousers of the Appellant had blood stains, the DNA\n\n profiles of which, matched with that of the blood of the victim.\n\n These circumstances at serial numbers a) to i) stand proved\n\nbeyond any doubt and by themselves constitute a conclusive and\n\nconsistent chain excluding every other hypothesis except the guilt of the\n\nAppellant.\n\n20. We must at this stage deal with the submission of Ms. Mathur,\n\nlearned Senior Advocate about non-consideration of certain circumstances\n\nby the Courts below.\n\n It is true that the injuries on the lips of the victim showed that the\n\nmargins were clean cut and given the nature of evidence in that behalf, it\n\ncannot be said with certainty that those injuries could be taken to be the\n\nresult of human bites. But the other injuries on the body of the victim\n\n\f 49\n\nwere definitely by human bites and as such the absence of clarity with\n\nregard to the injuries on the lips does not render the case of the\n\nprosecution doubtful in any manner.\n\n Again, the absence of association of vaginal, cervical and anal\n\nswabs with the Appellant does not in any way diminish the strength of\n\nevidence against the Appellant.\n\n21. The circumstances proved on record are not only conclusive in\n\nnature but completely support the case of the prosecution and are\n\nconsistent with only one hypothesis and that is the guilt of the Appellant.\n\nThey form a chain, so complete, consistent and clear, that no room for\n\ndoubt or ground arises pointing towards innocence of the Appellant. It is,\n\ntherefore, established beyond any shadow of doubt that the Appellant\n\ncommitted the acts of rape and sexual assault upon the victim and that\n\ninjury no.17 was the cause of death of the victim.\n\n22. The Appellant is thus guilty of having committed offences\n\npunishable under clauses (f), (i) and (m) of sub-section (2) of \nSection 376\n\nof IPC; and also, under clauses (j) and (m) of \nSection 5\n read with \nSection 6\n\nof the POCSO Act, (as it stood before it was amended by Act 25 of 2019).\n\nSince according to medical opinion, the death was because of injury\n\nNo.17, the Appellant is also guilty of having committed offence punishable\n\nunder \nSection 376A\n of IPC.\n\n\f 50\n\n23. The injuries suffered by the victim were directly as a result of\n\nsexual assault inflicted upon her. But the medical evidence does not\n\ndisclose that either before or after the commission of sexual assault, any\n\nother injury was consciously caused with the intention to extinguish the\n\nlife of the victim. Injury No.17 which was the cause of death was suffered\n\nby the victim during the course of commission of sexual assault upon her.\n\nThe questions that arise, therefore, are whether such an act on part of the\n\nAppellant comes within the parameters of \nSections 299\n and \n300\n of IPC and\n\nwhether he is guilty of having committed culpable homicide amounting to\n\nmurder.\n\n24. According to clause fourthly under \nSection 300\n of IPC, the offence\n\nmay come under the category of culpable homicide amounting to murder\n\n“if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous\n\nthat it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely\n\nto cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the\n\nrisk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid”.\n\n \nThe interplay between clauses of \nSections 299\n and \n300\n of the IPC\n\nwas considered by this Court in \nState of Andhra Pradesh vs. Rayavarapu\n\nPunnayya and Another\n as under:-\n\n (1976) 4 SCC 382\n\n\f 51\n\n“11. The principal question that falls to be considered in\nthis appeal is, whether the offence disclosed by the facts\nand circumstances established by the prosecution against\nthe respondent, is “murder” or “culpable homicide” not\namounting to murder.\n\n12. In the scheme of the Penal Code, “culpable homicide”\nis genus and “murder” its specie. All “murder” is\n“culpable homicide” but not vice-versa. Speaking\ngenerally, “culpable homicide” sans “special\ncharacteristics of murder”, is “culpable homicide not\namounting to murder”. For the purpose of fixing\npunishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic\noffence, the Code practically recognises three degrees of\nculpable homicide. The first is, what may be called,\n“culpable homicide of the first degree”. This is the greatest\nform of culpable homicide, which is defined in Section\n300 as “murder”. The second may be termed as “culpable\nhomicide of the second degree”. This is punishable under\nthe first part of Section 304. Then, there is “culpable\nhomicide of the third degree”. This is the lowest type of\nculpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is,\nalso, the lowest among the punishments provided for the\nthree grades. Culpable homicide of this degree is\npunishable under the second part of Section 304.\n\n13. The academic distinction between “murder” and\n“culpable homicide not amounting to murder” has vexed\nthe courts for more than a century. The confusion is\ncaused, if courts losing sight of the true scope and\nmeaning of the terms used by the legislature in these\nsections, allow themselves to be drawn into minutae\nabstractions. The safest way of approach to the\ninterpretation and application of these provisions seems to\nbe to keep in focus the keywords used in the various\nclauses of Sections 299 and 300. The following\ncomparative table will be helpful in appreciating the points\nof distinction between the two offences.\n\n14. Clause (b) of Section 299 corresponds with clauses (2)\nand (3) of Section 300. The distinguishing feature of the\nmens rea requisite under clause (2) is the knowledge\npossessed by the offender regarding the particular victim\nbeing in such a peculiar condition or state of health that\nthe internal harm caused to him is likely to be fatal,\nnotwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the\nordinary way of nature be sufficient to cause death of a\nperson in normal health or condition. It is noteworthy that\nthe “intention to cause death” is not an essential\n\n\f 52\n\nrequirement of clause (2). Only the intention of causing\nthe bodily injury coupled with the offender’s knowledge of\nthe likelihood of such injury causing the death of the\nparticular victim, is sufficient to bring the killing within\nthe ambit of this clause. This aspect of clause (2) is borne\nout by Illustration (b) appended to Section 300.\n\n Section 299 Section 300\nA person commits Subject to certain exceptions\nculpable homicide if culpable homicide is murder\nthe act by which the if the act by which the death\ndeath is caused is done is caused is done —\n—\n\n INTENTION\n\n(a)With the intention of (1) With the intention of\ncausing death; or causing death; or\n\n(b) With the (2) With the intention of\nintention of causing causing such bodily injury as\nsuch bodily injury as is the offender knows to be\nlikely to cause death; or likely to cause the death of\n the person to whom the harm\n is caused; or\n\n (3) With the intention of\n causing bodily injury to any\n person and the bodily injury\n intended to be inflicted is\n sufficient in the ordinary\n course of nature to cause\n death; or\n\n KNOWLEDGE\n\n(c)With the knowledge\nthat the act is likely to (4) With the knowledge that\ncause death the act is so imminently\n dangerous that it must in all\n probability cause death or\n such bodily injury as is likely\n to cause death, and without\n any excuse for incurring the\n risk of causing death or such\n injury as is mentioned above.\n\n\f 53\n\n 15. Clause (b) of Section 299 does not postulate any such\n knowledge on the part of the offender. Instances of cases\n falling under clause (2) of Section 300 can be where the\n assailant causes death by a fist blow intentionally given\n knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged liver,\n or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is\n likely to cause death of that particular person as a result of\n the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart,\n as the case may be. If the assailant had no such knowledge\n about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an\n intention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the\n ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence will\n not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death,\n was intentionally given.\n\n 16. In clause (3) of Section 300, instead of the words\n “likely to cause death” occurring in the corresponding\n clause (b) of Section 299, the words “sufficient in the\n ordinary course of nature” have been used. Obviously, the\n distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause\n death and a bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course\n of nature to cause death. The distinction is fine but real,\n and, if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice.\n\n The difference between clause (b) of Section 299 and\n clause (3) of Section 300 is one of the degree of\n probability of death resulting from the intended bodily\n injury. To put it more broadly, it is the degree of\n probability of death which determines whether a culpable\n homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree.\n The word “likely” in clause (b) of Section 299 conveys the\n sense of “probable” as distinguished from a mere\n possibility. The words “bodily injury … sufficient in the\n ordinary course of nature to cause death” mean that death\n will be the “most probable” result of the injury, having\n regard to the ordinary course of nature.\n\n 17. For cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary\n that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the\n death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries\n sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.\n Rajwant v. State of Kerala is an apt illustration of this\n point.\n\n 18. In Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab Vivian Bose, J.\n speaking for this Court, explained the meaning and scope\n of clause (3), thus (at p. 1500):\n\n AIR 1966 SC 1874\n AIR 1958 SC 465\n\n\f 54\n\n “The prosecution must prove the following\n facts before it can bring a case under Section\n 300, ‘thirdly’. First, it must establish quite\n objectively, that a bodily injury is present;\n secondly the nature of the injury must be\n proved. These are purely objective\n investigations. It must be proved that there was\n an intention to inflict that particular injury, that\n is to say, that it was not accidental or\n unintentional or that some other kind of injury\n was intended. Once these three elements are\n proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n further, and fourthly it must be proved that the\n injury of the type just described made up of\n the three elements set out above was sufficient\n to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.\n This part of the enquiry is purely objective and\n inferential and has nothing to do with the\n intention of the offender.”\n\n19. Thus according to the rule laid down in Virsa Singh\ncase38 of even if the intention of accused was limited to the\ninfliction of a bodily injury sufficient to cause death in the\nordinary course of nature, and did not extend to the\nintention of causing death, the offence would be “murder”.\nIllustration (c) appended to Section 300 clearly brings out\nthis point.\n\n20. Clause (c) of Section 299 and clause (4) of Section 300\nboth require knowledge of the probability of the act\ncausing death. It is not necessary for the purpose of this\ncase to dilate much on the distinction between these\ncorresponding clauses. It will be sufficient to say that\nclause (4) of Section 300 would be applicable where the\nknowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of\na person or persons in general — as distinguished from a\nparticular person or persons — being caused from his\nimminently dangerous act, approximates to a practical\ncertainty. Such knowledge on the part of the offender must\nbe of the highest degree of probability, the act having been\ncommitted by the offender without any excuse for\nincurring the risk of causing death or such injury as\naforesaid.\n\n21. From the above conspectus, it emerges that whenever a\ncourt is confronted with the question whether the offence\nis “murder” or “culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder”, on the facts of a case, it will be convenient for it\n\n\f 55\n\n to approach the problem in three stages. The question to be\n considered at the first stage would be, whether the accused\n has done an act by doing which he has caused the death of\n another. Proof of such causal connection between the act\n of the accused and the death, leads to the second stage for\n considering whether that act of the accused amounts to\n “culpable homicide” as defined in Section 299. If the\n answer to this question is prima facie found in the\n affirmative, the stage for considering the operation of\n Section 300 of the Penal Code, is reached. This is the stage\n at which the court should determine whether the facts\n proved by the prosecution bring the case within the ambit\n of any of the four clauses of the definition of “murder”\n contained in Section 300. If the answer to this question is\n in the negative the offence would be “culpable homicide\n not amounting to murder”, punishable under the first or\n the second part of Section 304, depending, respectively, on\n whether the second or the third clause of Section 299 is\n applicable. If this question is found in the positive, but the\n case comes within any of the exceptions enumerated in\n Section 300, the offence would still be “culpable homicide\n not amounting to murder”, punishable under the first part\n of Section 304, of the Penal Code.\n\n 22. The above are only broad guidelines and not cast-iron\n imperatives. In most cases, their observance will facilitate\n the task of the court. But sometimes the facts are so\n intertwined and the second and the third stages so\n telescoped into each other, that it may not be convenient to\n give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the\n second and third stages.”\n\n25. We may now consider the cases where the death may not have been\n\nintended but clause fourthly of \nSection 300\n of IPC was applied to hold the\n\naccused guilty of offence of culpable homicide amounting to murder.\n\n \nA) In \nState of Madhya Pradesh vs. Ram Prasad\n, a woman\n\nwas set afire by the accused after pouring kerosene oil on her. A bench of\n\nthree Judges of this Court dealt with the matter as under:-\n\n (1968) 2 SCR 522\n\n\f 56\n\n“The question then arises, what was the offence which\nRam Prasad can be said to have committed? The offence\nof causing injury by burning is a broad spectrum which\nruns from s. 324 causing simple injury by burning through\ns. 326 namely, causing grievous injury by burning to the\ntwo major offences, namely, culpable homicide not\namounting to murder and even murder itself. The\nSessions Judge chose the lowest end of the spectrum\nwhich is surprising enough, because the burns were so\nextensive that they were certainly grievous by all account.\nThe High Court placed the offence a little higher, namely,\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. We think that\nthe matter goes a little further than this. As death has been\ncaused the question has to be considered in the light of\nhomicide to determine whether the action of Ram Prasad\nfalls within culpable homicide not amounting to murder or\nthe higher offence of murder itself. Here we see that death\nhas actually been caused by the criminal act; in other\nwords, there has been homicide and since it is not\naccidental or suicidal death, responsibility for the\nhomicide, in the absence of any exceptions or extenuating\ncircumstances, must be borne by the person who caused it.\nThe High Court has apparently stopped short by holding\nthat this was a case of culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder. The question is whether the offence falls in any of\nthe clauses of\n s. 300\n Indian Penal Code. In this\nconnection it is difficult to say that Ram Prasad intended\ncausing the death of Mst. Rajji although it might well be\nthe truth. That he set fire to her clothes after pouring\nkerosene oil is a patent fact and therefore the matter has to\nbe viewed not only with regard to the firstly of s. 300, but\nall the other clauses also. We do not wish to consider the\nsecond and the third clauses, because the question then\nwould arise what was the extent of the injury which Ram\nPrasad intended to cause or knew would be caused to Mst.\nRajji. That would be a matter of speculation. In our\nopinion, this matter can be disposed of with reference to\nclause fourthly of s. 300. That clause reads as follows :-\n\n “. . . . .culpable homicide is murder. . . . . if the\n person committing the act knows that is so\n imminently dangerous that it must in all\n probability, cause death or such bodily injury\n as is likely to cause death, and commits such\n act without any excuse for incurring the risk or\n causing death or such injury as aforesaid.”\n\nIt is obvious that there was no excuse for Ram Prasad to\nhave taken the risk of causing the death or such bodily\ninjury as was likely to cause death. The question therefore\n\n\f 57\n\n arises whether Ram Prasad knew that his act was so\n imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause\n death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, so\n as to bring the matter within the clause. Although clause\n fourthly is usually invoked in those cases where there is no\n intention to cause the death of any particular person (as the\n illustration shows) the clause may on its terms be used in\n those cases where there is such callousness towards the\n result and the risk taken is such that it may be stated that\n the person knows that the act is likely to cause death or\n such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. In the\n present case, Ram Prasad poured kerosene upon the\n clothes of Mst. Rajji and set fire to those clothes. It is\n obvious that such fire spreads rapidly and burns\n extensively. No special knowledge is needed to know that\n one may cause death by burning if he sets fire to the\n clothes of a person. Therefore, it is obvious that Ram\n Prasad must have known that he was running the risk of\n causing the death of Rajji or such bodily injury as was\n likely to cause her death. As he had no excuse for\n incurring that risk, the offence must be taken to fall within\n 4thly of\n s. 300\n, Indian Penal Code. \nIn other words, his\n offence was culpable homicide amounting to murder even\n if he did not intend causing the death of Mst. Rajji. He\n committed an act so imminently dangerous that it was in\n all probability likely to cause death or to result in an injury\n that was likely to cause death. We are accordingly of the\n opinion that the High Court and the Sessions Judge were\n both wrong in holding that the offence did not fall within\n murder.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n B) In a similar fact situation, another bench of three Judges of\n\n this Court, in Santosh S/o \nShankar Pawar vs. State of Maharashtra\n \n\n observed,\n\n “13. Even assuming that the accused had no intention to\n cause the death of the deceased, the act of the accused falls\n under clause Fourthly of \nSection 300\n IPC that is the act of\n causing injury so imminently dangerous where it will in\n all probability cause death.\n \nAny person of average\n intelligence would have the knowledge that pouring of\n\n (2015) 7 SCC 641\n\n\f 58\n\n kerosene and setting her on fire by throwing a lighted\n matchstick is so imminently dangerous that in all\n probability such an act would cause injuries causing\n death.”\n\n C) The principle in Santosh40 was adopted in \nSuraj Jagannath\n\n Jadhav vs. State of Maharashtra\n.\n\n \nD) In \nState of Haryana vs. Krishan and Another\n, where 36\n\n persons had died after consuming spurious liquor, this Court set aside the\n\n acquittal ordered by the High Court and restored the order of conviction\n\n under \nSection 302\n IPC passed by the trial Court. It was observed:-\n\n “33. Insofar as argument predicated on \nSection 120-B\n IPC\n is concerned, even if we proceed on the basis that charge\n of conspiracy is not proved, it would be suffice to observe\n that adequate evidence is produced showing the\n culpability of the respondents, individually. Once it is\n shown that the spurious liquor was sold from the local\n vends belonging to the respondents coupled with the fact\n that after this tragedy struck, the respondents even tried to\n destroy remaining bottles clearly establishes that the\n respondents had full knowledge of the fact that the bottles\n contain substance methyl and also had full knowledge\n about the disastrous consequences thereof which would\n bring their case within the four corners of Section 300\n Fourthly. The respondents cannot be treated as mere cat’s\n paw and naive. They have exploited the resilient nature of\n bucolic and rustic villagers.”\n\n26. We may now consider some of the decisions of this Court in which\n\ndeaths had occurred because of injuries sustained by the victims during\n\nsexual assault on them.\n\n (2020) 2 SCC 693\n (2017) 8 SCC 204\n\n\f 59\n\n26.1 In State of Orissa vs. Dibakar Naik and Others , a bench of two\n\nJudges of this Court dealt with a case where a lady of 23 years of age was\n\ngang raped and lost her life. The concerned accused were convicted inter\n\nalia under Sections 376 and 302 read with \nSection 34\n of IPC by the trial\n\nCourt. However, their conviction and sentence were set aside by the High\n\nCourt. The appeals preferred by the State were partly allowed and while\n\nconvicting four accused under Sections 376 and 304 II \nIPC\n, it was\n\nobserved by this Court:-\n\n “23. However, the nature of the injuries inflicted upon the\n person of the deceased indicate that the accused persons\n had not intended to cause her death. Dr Indramani Jena\n (PW 21) who conducted the post-mortem over the dead\n body of Chhabirani had found the following injuries:\n\n “(1) One swelling 1\" diameter irregularly circular\n over right mastoid process.\n\n (2) One swelling (which was black in colour) on the\n upper half of right breast 2\" in diameter irregular\n circular.\n\n (3) On dissection I found the following:\n\n The swelling in right mastoid area had\n underlying haematoma. There was fracture of\n right fourth rib under Injury 2. Right-side chest\n was filled with blood of about one litre. The right\n lung was displaced and was injured in anterior\n surface by fractured rib. Heart chamber was\n empty, that is, there was no blood.\n\n (4) Stomach was empty.\n\n (5) There were two ecchymosis of ¼\" in diameter\n each on posterior vaginal wall. The injuries were in\n 5 o’clock and 7 o’clock positions.\n\n (2002) 5 SCC 323\n\n\f 60\n\n (6) On examination of the vaginal smear I found\n dead spermatozoa and epithelial cells.\n\n (7) By the time of my examination, there was\n process of decomposition. Skin denudation had\n started. Tongue was protruded and bitten. There was\n bleeding from right angle of mouth and both ears.\n Abdomen was protruded due to foul gases. Death\n was within 48 hours of the PM examination.”\n\nHe has opined that all injuries were ante-mortem. Death\nwas due to injuries causing internal haemorrhage. There\nwere signs of forcible sexual intercourse. It was a case of\nviolent type of intercourse. The injuries found were not in\nnormal course of sexual intercourse. Any violent assault\neven without rape could cause Injuries 1 and 2 and the\ncorresponding internal injuries. Injury 2 with\ncorresponding internal injury was sufficient to cause the\ndeath.\n\n24. Whoever causes death by doing an act with the\nintention of causing death or with the intention of causing\nsuch bodily injury as is likely to cause death or with the\nknowledge that he is likely, by such act, to cause death, is\nresponsible for the commission of the offence of culpable\nhomicide. Culpable homicide is murder if the act by which\nthe death is caused is done with the intention of causing\ndeath and is not covered by any of the exceptions of\n\nSection 300\n of the Indian Penal Code. As already noticed,\nin this case there is no evidence to show that the aforesaid\naccused persons proved to have been involved in the\noccurrence, had intended to cause the offence of murder\nwithin the meaning of Section 300 as punishable under\n\nSection 302\n of the Indian Penal Code. However, on proof\nof the commission of offence of gang rape found to have\nbeen committed in a violent manner, they are assumed to\nbe having the knowledge that by their action it was likely\nthat the deceased would have died. The aforesaid accused\nare, therefore, guilty of the offence, punishable under Part\nII of \nSection 304\n of the Indian Penal Code. While\nacquitting the other respondents we hold Birabar Mania\n(A-5), Babaji Mania (A-6), Bhira Behera @ Baba Tanti\n(A-7) and Madha Tanti @ Madhabananda Parmanik (A-\n\n11) guilty for the commission of offences punishable\nunder Section 304 Part II read with \nSection 34\n of the\nIndian Penal Code besides the commission of offence\npunishable under Section 376 read with \nSection 34\n of the\nIndian Penal Code. The conviction and sentence awarded\n\n\f 61\n\n by the trial court to Birabar Mania (A-5), Babaji Mania\n (A-6), Bhira Behera @ Baba Tanti (A-7) and Madha Tanti\n @ Madhabananda Parmanik (A-11) under \nSection 376\n of\n the Indian Penal Code is upheld. On proof of the offence\n punishable under Section 304 Part II read with \nSection 34\n\n IPC, the aforesaid accused persons are sentenced to\n undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years. Both the\n sentences shall run concurrently”.\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n Though it was found that the offence of gang rape was committed\n\nin a violent manner and that the offenders must be having the knowledge\n\nthat it was likely that by their action the victim would die, the accused\n\nwere not convicted of the offence of culpable homicide amounting to\n\nmurder.\n\n26.2 Similarly, in \nState, Govt of NCT of Delhi vs. Sunil and Another\n ,\n\na girl of 4 years of age was raped by two accused and she lost her life as a\n\nresult of injuries sustained during sexual assault. A bench of two Judges\n\nof this Court observed:-\n\n “23. Thus on consideration of the entire evidence in this\n case we have no doubt that the trial court had come to the\n correct conclusion that the two respondents were the\n rapists who subjected Anuradha to such savage\n ravishment. The Division Bench of the High Court has\n grossly erred in interfering with such a correct conclusion\n made by the trial court as the reasons adopted by the High\n Court for such interference are very tenuous. Nonetheless,\n it is difficult to enter upon a finding that the respondents\n are equally guilty of murder of Anuradha. In the opinion\n of PW 1 doctor the child died “due to intracranial damage\n\n (2001) 1 SCC 652\n\n\f 62\n\n consequent upon surface force impact to the head”. The\n said opinion was made with reference to the subdural\n haematoma which resulted in subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n Such a consequence happened during the course of the\n violent ravishment committed by either both or by one of\n the rapists without possibly having any intention or even\n knowledge that their action would produce any such\n injury. Even so, the rapists cannot disclaim knowledge that\n the acts done by them on a little infant of such a tender age\n were likely to cause its death. Hence they cannot escape\n conviction from the offence of culpable homicide not\n amounting to murder.\n\n \n24. In the result, we set aside the impugned judgment of\n the High Court. We restore the conviction passed by the\n trial court under Sections 376 and 377 read with \nSection\n 34\n IPC. The trial court awarded the maximum sentence to\n the respondents under the said counts i.e. imprisonment\n for life. The fact-situation in this case does not justify any\n reduction of that sentence. We also convict the\n respondents under Section 304 Part II, read with \nSection\n 34\n IPC though it is unnecessary to award any sentence\n thereunder in view of the sentence of imprisonment for\n life awarded to the respondents under the other two\n counts.”\n\n26.3 In \nAmrit Singh vs. State of Punjab\n, a girl of 7-8 years died as a\n\nresult of excessive bleeding from her private parts because of sexual\n\nassault on her. The accused was found guilty of offences under Sections\n\n302 and 376 and was awarded death sentence. A bench of two Judges of\n\nthis Court observed:-\n\n “21. The opinion of the learned trial Judge as also the\n High Court that the appellant being aged about 31 years\n and not suffering from any disease, was in a dominating\n position and might have got her mouth gagged cannot be\n held to be irrelevant. Some marks of violence not only on\n the neck but also on her mouth were found. Submission of\n Mr Agarwal, however, that the appellant might not have an\n\n (2006) 12 SCC 79\n\n\f 63\n\n intention to kill the deceased, thus, may have some force.\n The death occurred not as a result of strangulation but\n because of excessive bleeding. The deceased had bleed\n half a litre of blood. Dr. Reshamchand Singh, PW 1 did\n not state that injury on the neck could have contributed to\n her death. The death occurred, therefore, as a consequence\n of and not because of any specific overt act on the part of\n the appellant.”\n\n This Court commuted the sentence to life imprisonment.\n\n26.4 A bench of two Judges of this Court relied upon the decision in\n\nState of Orissa v. Dibakar Naik43\n and affirmed the conviction and\n\nsentence under Sections 376 and 304 II \nIPC\n in \nState of AP v. T.\n\nPrasanna Kumar\n.\n\n26.5 On the other hand, in following four cases, two Judge benches of\n\nthis Court affirmed the conviction and sentence under \nSections 302\n and\n\n376\n IPC where the victims, aged between 1½ to 8 years had lost their\n\nlives as a result of injuries sustained during sexual assault on them.\n\n \ni) Mohd. Chaman vs. State (NCT of Delhi\n)\n Age of the Victim : 1½ years\n\n ii) Ramesh Harijan vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n Age of the Victim : 5-6 years\n\n iii) Ram Deo Prasad vs. State of Bihar\n Age of the Victim : 4 years\n\n (2003) 1 ACR 627 (SC) = JT 2002 (7) SC 635\n (2001) 2 SCC 28\n (2012) 5 SCC 777\n (2013) 7 SCC 725\n\n\f 64\n\n \niv) Ramesh vs. State\n through Inspector of Police\n Age of the Victim : 8 years\n\n However, there is no discussion on the point in these cases.\n\n26.6 Recently, a three Judge bench of this Court in \nDattatraya Ambo\n\nRokade vs. The State of Maharashtra\n  had an occasion to consider where\n\na girl of 5 years was subjected to sexual assault. She died as a result of\n\ninjuries 1 to 5 suffered during the course of sexual assault on her. The\n\nconviction of the accused inter alia under \nSections 302\n, \n376(2)(f)\n of IPC\n\nand under the provisions of \nPOCSO Act\n was affirmed by this Court and it\n\nwas observed:-\n\n “125. As a mature man, over fifty years of age, the\n Accused-Appellant should have known that the rape of a\n five year old child by an adult was dangerous and could\n lead to such injuries, as was in all probability likely to\n cause death.”\n\n27. The guiding principles were summed up in \nState of Madhya\n\nPradesh v. Ram Prasad39\n to the effect that even if there be no intention to\n\ncause death, “if there is such callousness towards the result and the risk\n\ntaken is such that it may be stated that the person knows that the act is\n\nlikely to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death”\n\nclause fourthly of \nSection 300\n IPC will get attracted and that the offender\n\nmust be taken to have known that he was running the risk of causing the\n\n (2014) 9 SCC 392\n (2019) 13 SCALE 187\n\n\f 65\n\ndeath or such bodily injury as was likely to cause the death of the victim.\n\nSame principle is discernible from the decision of this Court in \nDattatraya\n\nAmbo Rokade v. State of Maharashtra51\n.\n\n28. Considering the age of the victim in the present case, the accused\n\nmust have known the consequence that his sexual assault on a child of 2 ½\n\nyears would cause death or such bodily injury as was likely to cause her\n\ndeath. The instant matter thus comes within the parameters of clause\n\nfourthly to \nSection 300\n IPC and the question posed at the beginning of the\n\ndiscussion on this issue must be answered against the Appellant. The\n\nAppellant is therefore guilty of having committed the offence of culpable\n\nhomicide amounting to murder.\n\n29. It must be observed at this stage that the decisions of this Court\n\nreferred to in paragraphs 26.1, 26.2 and 26.4 hereinabove failed to consider\n\nthe effect of clause fourthly to \nSection 300\n IPC.\n\n30. Before we turn to the submissions on sentence advanced by Ms.\n\nMathur, learned Senior Advocate, it needs to be noted that about 67 cases\n\nwere dealt with by this Court in last 40 years since the decision of this\n\nCourt in Bachan Singh8, where i) the alleged offences were under \nSections\n\n376\n and \n302\n IPC; and ii) the ages of the victims were 16 years or below.\n\nThe Cases are:-\n\n\f 66\n\nS.

In three (at Sr. Nos. 26A, 33A and\n\n41A) out of said 15 cases, the death sentence was commuted to life\n\nsentence by this Court in Review Petitions. Out of remaining 12 cases, in\n\n\f 73\n\ntwo cases (where Review Petitions were heard in open Court in terms of\n\nlaw laid down in Mohd. Arif alias \nAshfaq vs. Registrar\n, Supreme Court\n\nof India) namely in cases at Sr. Nos. 51A and 65A, the death sentence\n\nwas confirmed by this Court and the Review Petitions were dismissed.\n\nThus, as on date, the death sentence stands confirmed in 12 out of 67 cases\n\nwhere the principal offences allegedly committed were under \nSections 376\n\nand \n302\n IPC and where the victims were aged about 16 years or below.\n\n Out of these 67 cases, at least in 51 cases the victims were aged\n\nbelow 12 years. In 12 out of those 51 cases, the death sentence was\n\ninitially awarded. However, in 3 cases (at Sr. Nos. 26A, 33A and 41A) the\n\ndeath sentence was commuted to life sentence in Review.\n\n In 2 out of aforesaid 67 cases (at Sr. Nos. 58 and 67), the offences\n\nwere committed on 23.02.2015 and 22.05.2015 respectively i.e., after the\n\nAmendment Act received the assent of the President and was published on\n\n02.04.2013 (but given retrospective effect from 03.02.2013). The\n\nconviction was also under \nSection 376A\n of IPC and the evidence showed\n\nspecific acts such as drowning the victim or throttling her. In the first\n\ncase, the age of the victim was 5 years while in the second case the victim\n\nwas aged 13 years. In the first case the sentence imposed by this Court\n\n (2014) 9 SCC 737\n\n\f 74\n\nwas 25 years of imprisonment without remission while in the second, the\n\nlife sentence for the remainder of the life of the accused, was imposed.\n\n31. We now turn to the first submission advanced by Ms. Mathur,\n\nlearned Senior Advocate on the issue of sentence. Section 235 (2) of the\n\nCode mandates that the accused must be heard on sentence. In the instant\n\ncase the order of sentence was made on the same day the order of\n\nconviction was pronounced. \nIn \nSanta Singh v. State of Punjab\n  the\n\naccused was convicted and sentenced to death by one single judgment and\n\nthus a bench of two judges of this Court found that there was infraction of\n\nSection 235 (2) of the Code. The sentence of death was therefore set aside\n\nand the matter was remanded to the Sessions Court.\n \nWhether, for non-\n\ncompliance of Section 235 (2) of the Code, the matter be remanded in the\n\nlight of the decision in \nSanta Singh v. State of Punjab53\n was thereafter\n\nconsidered by a bench of three judges of this Court in \nDagdu v. State of\n\nMaharashtra\n. Chandrachud, CJ. who delivered the leading judgment,\n\nobserved: -\n\n \n“79. But we are unable to read the judgment in Santa\n Singh as laying down that the failure on the part of the\n Court, which convicts an accused, to hear him on the\n question of sentence must necessarily entail a remand to\n that Court in order to afford to the accused an opportunity\n to be heard on the question us sentence. The Court, on\n convicting an accused, must unquestionably hear him on\n the question of sentence. But if, for any reason, it omits to\n do so and the accused makes a grievance of it in the higher\n (1976) 4 SCC 190\n (1977) 3 SCC 68\n\n\f 75\n\n court, it would be open to that Court to remedy the breach\n by giving a hearing to the accused on the question of\n sentence. That opportunity has to be real and effective,\n which means that the accused must be permitted to adduce\n before the Court all the data which he desires to adduce on\n the question of sentence. The accused may exercise that\n right either by instructing his counsel to make oral\n submissions to the Court or he may, on affidavit or\n otherwise, place in writing before the Court whatever he\n desires to place before it on the question of sentence. The\n Court may, in appropriate cases, have to adjourn the matter\n in order to give to the accused sufficient time to produce\n the necessary data and to make his contentions on the\n question of sentence. That, perhaps, must inevitably\n happen where the conviction is recorded for the first time\n by a higher court.”\n\n Goswami, J., authored a concurring opinion, the relevant part of\n\nwhich was quoted in \nB. A. Umesh v. High\n Court of Karnataka31.\n\n32. \nIn \nAllauddin Mian v. State of Bihar\n 11, the order of sentence was\n\npassed on the same day the order of conviction was pronounced and a\n\nbench of two judges of this Court commuted the sentence of death to life\n\nimprisonment.\n In Malkiat Singh v. Stat of Punjab12, a bench of three\n\njudges of this Court did not deem it appropriate to remand the matter for\n\nhearing the accused on sentence after six years and commuted the sentence\n\nof death to life imprisonment. \nIn \nAjay Pandit v. State of Maharashtra\n 13, a\n\nbench of two judges of this Court found that the opportunity afforded to\n\nthe accused in terms of Section 235 (2) of the Code was purely\n\nmechanical and no genuine efforts were made to elicit any information\n\neither from the accused or from the prosecution as to whether any\n\n\f 76\n\n circumstances existed which might influence the High Court to avoid\n\n award of death sentence.\n\n 33. \nIn \nB. A. Umesh v. High\n Court of Karnataka 31, a bench of three\n\n judges of this Court considered the decisions on the point including the\n\n question whether the matter was required to be remanded to hear the\n\n accused on sentence. Paragraphs 11 to 13 of the decision were as under :-\n\n “11. In Dagdu v. State of Maharashtra54 Goswami, J.\n observes as under:\n\n \n“90. I would particularly emphasise that there\n is no mandatory direction for remanding any\n case in \nSanta Singh v. State of Punjab53\n nor is\n remand the inevitable recipe of \nSection 235(2)\n,\n Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Whenever\n an appeal court finds that the mandate of\n \nSection 235(2)\n CrPC for a hearing on sentence\n had not been complied with, it, at once,\n becomes the duty of the appeal court to offer\n to the accused an adequate opportunity to\n produce before it whatever materials he\n chooses in whatever reasonable way possible.\n Courts should avoid laws’ delay and\n necessarily inconsequential remands when the\n accused can secure full benefit of \nSection\n 235(2)\n CrPC even in the appeal court, in the\n High Court or even in this Court. We have\n unanimously adopted this very course in these\n appeals.”\n\n 12. In another three-Judge Bench case in Tarlok Singh v.\n\n State of Punjab, at para 4, Krishna Iyer, J. writes:\n\n “4. \nIn \nSanta Singh v. State of Punjab53\n this\n Court considering \nSection 235(2)\n CrPC held\n that the hearing contemplated by that sub-\n section is not confined merely to hearing oral\n submissions but extends to giving an\n\n (1977) 3 SCC 218\n\n\f 77\n\n opportunity to the prosecution and the accused\n to place before the court facts and materials\n relating to the various factors bearing on the\n question of sentence and, if they are contested\n by either side, then to produce evidence for the\n purpose of establishing the same. Of course, in\n that particular case this Court sent the case\n back to the Sessions Court for complying with\n \nSection 235(2)\n CrPC. It may well be that in\n many cases sending the case back to the\n Sessions Court may lead to more expense,\n delay and prejudice to the cause of justice. In\n such cases, it may be more appropriate for the\n appellate court to give an opportunity to the\n parties in terms of Section 235(2) to produce\n the materials they wish to adduce instead of\n going through the exercise of sending the case\n back to the trial court. This may, in many\n cases, save time and help produce prompt\n justice.”\n\n 13. \nIn \nDeepak Rai v. State of Bihar\n, yet another three-\n\n Judge Bench case, Dattu, J. observes in para 54 as under:\n\n \n“54. Herein, it is not the case of the appellants\n that the opportunity to be heard on the\n question of sentence separately as provisioned\n for under Section 235(2) of the Code was not\n provided by the courts below. Further, the trial\n court has recorded and discussed the\n submissions made by the appellants and the\n prosecution on the said question and thereafter,\n rejected the possibility of awarding a\n punishment less harsh than the death penalty.\n However, the High Court while confirming the\n sentence has recorded reasons though\n encapsulated. The High Court has noticed the\n motive of the appellants being non-withdrawal\n of the case by the informant and the ghastly\n manner of commission of crime whereby six\n innocent persons as young as 3-year old were\n charred to death and concluded that the\n incident shocks the conscience of the entire\n society and thus deserves nothing lesser but\n death penalty.” ”\n\n (2013) 10 SCC 421\n \nState of Bihar v. Deepak Rai\n, 2010 SCC OnLine Pat 949\n\n\f 78\n\n \n34. Subsequently, the issue was again considered in \nVasanta Sampat\n\n Dupare v. State of Maharashtra32\n and after referring to the decisions of\n\n this Court including those rendered in \nAllauddin Mian v. State of Bihar\n 11,\n\n \nMalkiat Singh v. State of Punjab12\n and \nB. A. Umesh v. High\n Court of\n\n Karnataka31, a bench of three judges of this Court observed : -\n\n \n“16. This Court then relied on the principle \nlaid down in\n\nDagdu v. State of Maharashtra54\n which was followed\n subsequently by another Bench of three learned Judges in\n \nTarlok Singh v. State of Punjab55\n. In the circumstances,\n merely because no separate date was given for hearing on\n sentence, we cannot find the entire exercise to be flawed\n or vitiated.\n \nSince we had allowed the petitioner to place\n the relevant material on record in the light of the principles\n \nlaid down in\n \nDagdu v. State of Maharashtra54\n we will\n proceed to consider the material so placed on record and\n weigh these factors and the aggravating circumstances as\n found by the Court in the judgment under review.”\n\n Recently, in \nManoj Suryavanshi vs. State of Chhattisgarh\n , a\n\n bench of three Judges of this Court, after considering the relevant decisions\n\n on the point, concluded:-\n\n \n“27.2. Thus, there is no absolute proposition of law that in\n no case there can be conviction and sentence on the same\n day. There is no absolute proposition of law \nlaid down by\n\n this Court in any of the decisions that if the sentence is\n awarded on the very same day on which the conviction\n was recorded, the sentencing would be vitiated.”\n\n  (2020) 4 SCC 451\n\n\n\f 79\n\n Thus, merely on account of infraction of Section 235 (2) of the Code,\n\nthe death sentence ought not to be commuted to life imprisonment.\n \nIn any\n\ncase we have afforded adequate and sufficient opportunity to the\n\nAppellant to place all the relevant materials on record in the light of\n\nprinciple \nlaid down in\n \nDagdu v. State of Maharashtra54\n.\n\n35. Before we deal with the second submission on sentence, it must be\n\nobserved that as \nlaid down by\n this Court in \nSharad Birdhichand Sarda v.\n\nState of Maharashtra34\n, a case based on circumstantial evidence has to\n\nface strict scrutiny. Every circumstance from which conclusion of guilt is\n\nto be drawn must be fully established; the circumstances should be\n\nconclusive in nature and tendency; they must form a chain of evidence so\n\ncomplete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent\n\nwith the innocence of the accused; and such chain of circumstances must\n\nbe consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and must\n\nexclude every possible hypothesis except the one sought to be proved by\n\nthe prosecution.\n \nThe decision in \nSharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of\n\nMaharashtra34\n had noted the consistent view on the point including the\n\ndecision of this Court in \nHanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n  in which\n\na bench of three judges of this Court had ruled:-\n\n “It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is\n of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which\n (1952) SCR 1091\n\n\f 80\n\n the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first\n instance be fully established, and all the facts so\n established should be consistent only with the hypothesis\n of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances\n should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they\n should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one\n proposed to be proved. \nIn other words, there must be a\n chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any\n reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the\n innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show\n that within all human probability the act must have been\n done by the accused.”\n\n Secondly, on the issue as to what should be the approach in the\n\nmatter of sentence, a bench of three judges of this Court in \nVadivelu\n\nThevar v. State of Madras\n stated:-\n\n “Lastly, it was urged that assuming that the court was\n inclined to act upon the testimony of the first witness and\n to record a conviction for murder as against the first\n appellant, the court should not impose the extreme penalty\n of law and in the state of the record as it is, the lesser\n punishment provided by law should be deemed to meet the\n ends of justice. We cannot accede to this line of argument.\n The first question which the court has to consider in a case\n like this, is whether the accused has been proved, to the\n satisfaction of the court, to have committed the crime. If\n the court is convinced about the truth of the prosecution\n story, conviction has to follow. The question of sentence\n has to be determined, not with reference to the volume or\n character of the evidence adduced by the prosecution in\n support of the prosecution case, but with reference to the\n fact whether there are any extenuating circumstances\n which can be said to mitigate the enormity of the crime. If\n the court is satisfied that there are such mitigating\n circumstances, only then, it would be justified in imposing\n the lesser of the two sentences provided by law. In other\n words, the nature of the proof has nothing to with the\n character of the punishment. The nature of the proof can\n only bear upon the question of conviction - whether or not\n the accused has been proved to be guilty. If the court\n comes to the conclusion that the guilt has been brought\n home to the accused, and conviction follows, the process\n of proof is at an end. The question as to what punishment\n\n (1957) SCR 981 – This was, however, not a case of death sentence.\n\n\f 81\n\n should be imposed is for the court to decide in all the\n circumstances of the case with particular reference to any\n extenuating circumstances. But the nature of proof, as we\n have indicated, has nothing to do with the question of\n punishment. In this case, there are no such extenuating\n circumstances which can be legitimately urged in support\n of the view that the lesser penalty under\n s. 302\n of the\n Indian Penal Code, should meet the ends of justice. It was\n a cold-blooded murder. The accused came for the second\n time, determined to see that their victim did not possibly\n escape the assassins' hands.”\n (Emphasis added)\n\n It was laid down that the question of sentence must be determined\n\nnot with reference to the volume or character of the evidence on record\n\nbut with reference to the circumstances which mitigate the enormity of the\n\ncrime and that the nature of proof can have bearing upon the question of\n\nsentence and not with the question of punishment.\n\n36. We may now consider some of the cases where death penalty was\n\nimposed when conviction was based on circumstantial evidence.\n\n \n(\ni) Jumman Khan vs. State of U.P. and Another\n ; while dismissing\n\n Writ Petition of a death convict this Court noted in para 4 the earlier\n\n order passed by a bench of two judges confirming the death sentence.\n\n “4. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the High\n Court, the petitioner filed S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 558 of\n 1986. This Court by its order dated March 20, 1986\n dismissed the SLP observing thus:\n\n “Although the conviction of the petitioner\n under Section 302 of the Indian Penal\n\n (1991) 1 SCC 752\n\n\f 82\n\n Code, 1860 rests on circumstantial\n evidence, the circumstantial evidence\n against the petitioner leads to no other\n inference except that of his guilt and\n excludes every hypothesis of his\n innocence. Apart from the circumstances\n brought out by the prosecution, each one of\n which has been proved, there is no extra-\n judicial confession which lends support to\n the prosecution case that the child had been\n raped by the petitioner and thereafter\n strangulated to death.\n\n Failure to impose a death sentence in such\n grave cases where it is a crime against the\n society — particularly in cases of murders\n committed with extreme brutality — will\n bring to naught the sentence of death\n provided by \nSection 302\n of the Indian\n Penal Code. It is the duty of the court to\n impose a proper punishment depending\n upon the degree of criminality and\n desirability to impose such punishment.\n The only punishment which the appellant\n deserves for having committed the\n reprehensible and gruesome murder of the\n innocent child to satisfy his lust, is nothing\n but death as a measure of social necessity\n and also as a means of deterring other\n potential offenders. The sentence of death\n is confirmed.”\n\n (ii) Amrutlal Someshwar Joshi vs. State of Maharashtra (I) :-\n\n “19. Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted\n that the case rests on the circumstantial evidence and the\n quality of the evidence adduced is not of that high order\n and therefore it is not safe to impose death sentence. \nIn\n this context he relied on a judgment of this Court in\n \nShankar v. State of T.N. We\n have gone through that\n judgment and it is only indicated there that the quality of\n evidence also would be a factor to be taken into\n consideration. The circumstantial evidence in this case\n\n (1994) 6 SCC 186\n (1994) 4 SCC 478\n\n\f 83\n\ncannot at all be said to be qualitatively inferior in any\nmanner. It is well-settled that if there is clinching and\nreliable circumstantial evidence, then that would be the\nbest evidence to be safely relied upon.\n \nAs observed in\n\nBachan Singh v. State of Punjab8\n, there may be many\ncircumstances justifying the passing of the lighter sentence\nas there are countervailing circumstances of aggravation\nwarranting imposition of death sentence.\n \nIn \nMachhi Singh\nv. State of Punjab9\n, a Bench of three Judges of this Court\nhaving noted the principles \nlaid down in\n Bachan Singh\ncase8 regarding the formula of “rarest of rare cases” for\nimposing death sentence, observed that the guidelines\nindicated in Bachan Singh case8 will have to be culled out\nand applied to the facts of each individual case where the\nquestion of imposing of death sentence arises.\n \nIt was\nfurther observed as under: (SCC p. 489, para 40)\n\n “If upon taking an overall global view of all\n the circumstances in the light of the aforesaid\n proposition and taking into account the\n answers to the questions posed hereinabove,\n the circumstances of the case are such that\n death sentence is warranted, the court would\n proceed to do so.”\n\nLikewise in \nAllauddin Mian v. State of Bihar11\n, the same\nview has been reiterated thus: (SCC p. 22, para 12)\n\n “However, in order that the sentences may be\n properly graded to fit the degree of gravity of\n each case, it is necessary that the maximum\n sentence prescribed by law should, as\n observed in Bachan Singh case8, be reserved\n for the ‘rarest of rare’ cases which are of an\n exceptional nature. Sentences of severity are\n imposed to reflect the seriousness of the crime,\n to promote respect for the law, to provide just\n punishment for the offence, to afford adequate\n deterrent to criminal conduct and to protect the\n community from further similar conduct. It\n serves a three-fold purpose (i) punitive (ii)\n deterrent and (iii) protective. That is why this\n Court in Bachan Singh case8 observed that\n when the question of choice of sentence is\n under consideration the Court must not only\n look to the crime and the victim but also the\n circumstances of the criminal and the impact\n of the crime on the community. Unless the\n nature of the crime and the circumstances of\n\n\f 84\n\n the offender reveal that the criminal is a\n menace to the society and the sentence of life\n imprisonment would be altogether inadequate,\n the court should ordinarily impose the lesser\n punishment and not the extreme punishment of\n death which should be reserved for exceptional\n cases only.”\n\n Bearing these principles in mind and after having given\n our anxious consideration, we are of the firm opinion in\n view of the above circumstances that the case of the\n appellant comes within the category of “rarest of rare\n cases” and the two courts below have rightly awarded the\n death sentence.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n (iii) Kamta Tiwari vs. State of M.P.\n\n (iv) Molai and Another vs. State of M.P.\n\n \n(v) Shivaji alias \nDadya Shankar Alhat vs. State of\n\n Maharashtra\n; while affirming the conviction and sentence of death\n\n for offences under \nSections 376\n and \n302\n IPC it was observed:-\n\n “27. The plea that in a case of circumstantial evidence\n death should not be awarded is without any logic. If the\n circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable\n character in establishing the guilt of the accused, that\n forms the foundation for conviction. That has nothing to\n do with the question of sentence as has been observed by\n this Court in various cases while awarding death sentence.\n The mitigating circumstances and the aggravating\n circumstances have to be balanced. In the balance sheet of\n such circumstances, the fact that the case rests on\n circumstantial evidence has no role to play. In fact in most\n of the cases where death sentences are awarded for rape\n and murder and the like, there is practically no scope for\n having an eyewitness. They are not committed in the\n public view. But the very nature of things in such cases,\n\n (1996) 6 SCC 250\n (1999) 9 SCC 581\n (2008) 15 SCC 269\n\n\f 85\n\n the available evidence is circumstantial evidence. If the\n said evidence has been found to be credible, cogent and\n trustworthy for the purpose of recording conviction, to\n treat that evidence as a mitigating circumstance, would\n amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. The plea\n of the learned amicus curiae that the conviction is based\n on circumstantial evidence and, therefore, the death\n sentence should not be awarded is clearly unsustainable.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\nvi) Vasanta Sampat Dupare v. State of Maharashtra6\n\n “38. On a critical analysis of the evidence on record, we\n are convinced that the circumstances that have been\n clearly established are: that the appellant was seen in the\n courtyard where the minor girl and other children were\n playing; that the appellant was seen taking the deceased on\n his bicycle; that he had gone to the grocery shop owned by\n PW 6 to buy Minto fresh chocolate along with her; that the\n accused had told PW 2 that the child was the daughter of\n his friend and he was going to “Tekdi-Wadi” along with\n the girl; that the appellant had led to the discovery of the\n dead body of the deceased, the place where he had washed\n his clothes and at his instance the stones smeared with\n blood were recovered; that the medical report clearly\n indicates about the injuries sustained by the deceased on\n her body; that the injuries sustained on the private parts\n have been stated by the doctor to have been caused by\n forcible sexual intercourse; that the stones that were seized\n were smeared with blood and the medical evidence\n corroborates the fact that injuries could have been caused\n by battering with stones; that the chemical analysis report\n shows that the blood group on the stones matches with the\n blood group found on the clothes of the appellant; that the\n appellant has not offered any explanation with regard to\n the recovery made at his instance; and that nothing has\n been stated in his examination under \nSection 313\n CrPC\n that there was any justifiable reason to implicate him in\n the crime in question. Thus, we find that each of the\n incriminating circumstances has been clearly established\n and the chain of circumstances are conclusive in nature to\n exclude any kind of hypothesis, but the one proposed to be\n proved, and lead to a definite conclusion that the crime\n was committed by the accused. Therefore, we have no\n hesitation in affirming the judgment of conviction\n rendered by the learned trial Judge and affirmed by the\n High Court.”\n\n\f 86\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n \n\n vii) Manoharan v. State\n\n “23. ….. The entire chain of events has been made out\n and despite this being a case of circumstantial evidence,\n the prosecution has clearly proved its case beyond\n reasonable doubt. The courts below are right in\n convicting the appellant of rape and murder.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n The decisions at Sl. Nos.(iv), (vi) and (vii) were by benches of\n\nthree Judges and dealt with cases where the convictions were inter alia\n\nunder \nSections 302\n, \n376\n IPC and the victims were aged 16 years or below;\n\nwhile the others were by benches of two Judges.\n\n37. However, there is a definite line of cases, where thoughts have\n\nbeen expressed that in cases of conviction based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, the death sentence should not normally be imposed. Some such\n\ncases are:-\n\n \n(\ni) Aloke Nath Dutta v. State of West Bengal\n:-\n\n “81. There is no eyewitness to the occurrence. Nobody has\n noticed any suspicious conduct on the part of the\n appellants indicating their role in committing murder or\n disposing of the dead body. While dealing with a case of\n grave nature like the present one, there is always a danger\n that conjectures and suspicion may take the place of legal\n truth. This Court has laid down guidelines from time to\n time in regard to a finding of guilt solely on the basis of\n circumstantial evidence in a number of cases. …. ….”\n\n \n(\nii) Bishnu Prasad Sinha v. State of Assam14\n:-\n\n (2019) 7 SCC 716\n (2007) 12 SCC 230\n\n\f 87\n\n “55. The question which remains is as to what punishment\n should be awarded. Ordinarily, this Court, having regard to\n the nature of the offence, would not have differed with the\n opinion of the learned Sessions Judge as also the High\n Court in this behalf, but it must be borne in mind that the\n appellants are convicted only on the basis of the\n circumstantial evidence. There are authorities for the\n proposition that if the evidence is proved by circumstantial\n evidence, ordinarily, death penalty would not be awarded.\n\n Moreover, Appellant 1 showed his remorse and repentance\n even in his statement under \nSection 313\n of the Code of\n Criminal Procedure. He accepted his guilt.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n \n(\niii) Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka\n\n While\n considering the decision of this Court in Bachan\n\n Singh8, it was observed:-\n\n “36. Arguing against standardisation of cases for the\n purpose of death sentence the Court observed that\n even within a single category offence there are\n infinite, unpredictable and unforeseeable variations.\n No two cases are exactly identical. There are\n countless permutations and combinations which are\n beyond the anticipatory capacity of the human\n calculus. The Court further observed that\n standardisation of the sentencing process tends to\n sacrifice justice at the altar of blind uniformity.\n\n … … …\n\n “48. That is not the end of the matter. Coupled with the\n deficiency of the criminal justice system is the lack of\n consistency in the sentencing process even by this Court.\n It is noted above that Bachan Singh8 laid down the\n principle of the rarest of rare cases. Machhi Singh9 for\n practical application crystallised the principle into five\n definite categories of cases of murder and in doing so also\n considerably enlarged the scope for imposing death\n penalty. But the unfortunate reality is that in later\n decisions neither the rarest of rare cases principle nor the\n Machhi Singh9 categories were followed uniformly and\n consistently.\n\n (2008) 13 SCC 767\n\n\f 88\n\n 49. \nIn \nAloke Nath Dutta v. State of W.B.68 Sinha, J.\n gave\n some very good illustrations from a number of recent\n decisions in which on similar facts this Court took\n contrary views on giving death penalty to the convict. He\n finally observed that “courts in the matter of sentencing\n act differently although the fact situation may appear to be\n somewhat similar” and further “it is evident that different\n Benches had taken different view in the matter”.\n Katju, J.\n\n in his order passed in this appeal said that he did not agree\n with the decision in Aloke Nath Dutta68 in that it held that\n death sentence was not to be awarded in a case of\n circumstantial evidence. Katju, J. may be right that there\n cannot be an absolute rule excluding death sentence in all\n cases of circumstantial evidence (though in Aloke Nath\n Dutta68 it is said “normally” and not as an absolute rule).\n But there is no denying the illustrations cited by Sinha, J.\n\n which are a matter of fact.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n (iv) Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of\n\n Maharashtra Relying\n\n upon the testimony of an approver, the sentence of death was\n\n awarded. The decision of this Court in Mohan and ors. vs. State\n\n of Tamil Nadu was distinguished thus:-\n\n \n“161. Mr Adsure has placed strong reliance on a\n decision of this Court in \nMohan v. State of T.N.71\n to\n contend that the manner in which the murder was\n committed itself points out that all the accused\n deserved death penalty. In our opinion the facts of that\n case are clearly distinguishable from the present one.\n That case involved the murder of a minor. It clearly is\n not applicable to the present case. Moreover, the\n Court \nin that case\n too recognised that proper and due\n regard must be given to the mitigating circumstances\n in every case.”\n (2009) 6 SCC 498\n (1998) 5 SCC 336 – case of kidnapping of a minor boy of 10 years for\nransom and murder. Award of death sentence to appellants Mohan and Gopi was\naffirmed by this Court.\n\n\f 89\n\n After considering the mitigating circumstances it was\n\nobserved:-\n\n “167. The entire prosecution case hinges on the\n evidence of the approver. For the purpose of imposing\n death penalty, that factor may have to be kept in mind.\n We will assume that in Swamy Shraddananda (2)69,\n this Court did not lay down a firm law that in a case\n involving circumstantial evidence, imposition of\n death penalty would not be permissible. But, even in\n relation thereto the question which would arise would\n be whether in arriving at a conclusion some surmises,\n some hypothesis would be necessary in regard to the\n manner in which the offence was committed as\n contradistinguished from a case where the manner of\n occurrence had no role to play. Even where sentence\n of death is to be imposed on the basis of the\n circumstantial evidence, the circumstantial evidence\n must be such which leads to an exceptional case.\n\n 168. We must, however, add that in a case of this\n nature where the entire prosecution case revolves\n round the statement of an approver or is dependent\n upon the circumstantial evidence, the prudence\n doctrine should be invoked. For the aforementioned\n purpose, at the stage of sentencing evaluation of\n evidence would not be permissible, the courts not\n only have to solely depend upon the findings arrived\n at for the purpose of recording a judgment of\n conviction, but also consider the matter keeping in\n view the evidences which have been brought on\n record on behalf of the parties and in particular the\n accused for imposition of a lesser punishment. A\n statement of approver in regard to the manner in\n which crime has been committed vis-à-vis the role\n played by the accused, on the one hand, and that of\n the approver, on the other, must be tested on the\n touchstone of the prudence doctrine.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n\f 90\n\n \n(\nv) Purna Chandra Kusal v. State of Orissa16\n\n “7. We are, however, of the opinion that the death\n sentence in the present case was not called for. The\n appellant was a labourer living in a basti alongside the\n railway line and was, at the time of the incident, about\n 30 years of age. We also see that the entire evidence is\n circumstantial in nature. Concededly, there is no\n inflexible rule that a death sentence cannot be\n awarded in a case resting on circumstantial evidence\n but courts are as a matter of prudence, hesitant in\n awarding this sentence, in such a situation. It is true\n that the crime was indeed a heinous one as the victim\n was only five years of age and the daughter of PW 5\n who was a neighbour of the appellant. On a\n cumulative assessment of the facts, we are of the\n opinion that the death sentence should be commuted\n into one for life.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n (vi) Neel Kumar v. The State of Haryana\n\n \n(\nvii) Sushil Sharma vs. State (NCT of Delhi\n)\n\n \n(\nviii) Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde vs. State of Maharashtra\n\n (ix) Kalu Khan v. State of Rajasthan17\n\n “24. \nIn respect of award of death sentence in cases\n where sole basis for conviction is circumstantial\n evidence, this Court in \nSwamy Shraddananda v. State\n of Karnataka\n, has acknowledged that such cases have\n far greater chances of turning out to be wrongful\n convictions, later on, in comparison to ones which are\n based on fitter sources of proof. This Court cautioned\n that convictions based on “seemingly conclusive\n circumstantial evidence” should not be presumed as\n (2012) 5 SCC 766\n (2014) 4 SCC 317\n (2014) 4 SCC 292\n (2007) 12 SCC 288 para 87\n\n\f 91\n\n foolproof incidences and the fact that the same are\n based on circumstantial evidence must be a definite\n factor at the sentencing stage deliberations,\n considering that capital punishment is unique in its\n total irrevocability. Further, this Court observed that\n any characteristic of trial, such as conviction solely\n resting on circumstantial evidence, which contributes\n to the uncertainty in the “culpability calculus”, must\n attract negative attention while deciding maximum\n penalty for murder.\n\n 25. This Court noticed certain decisions under the\n American death penalty jurisprudence as follows:\n\n \n(\nSwamy Shraddananda\n case 75, SCC pp. 320-21, paras\n 88-90)\n\n “88.\n One of the older cases in this league\n dates back to 1874, Merritt v. State, where\n the Supreme Court of Georgia described\n the applicable law in Georgia as follows:\n\n ‘By the Penal Code of this State\n the punishment of murder shall\n be death, except when the\n conviction is founded solely on\n circumstantial testimony. When\n the conviction is had solely on\n circumstantial testimony, then it\n is discretionary with the\n Presiding Judge to impose the\n death penalty or to sentence the\n defendant to imprisonment in\n the penitentiary for life, unless\n the jury … shall recommend\n that the defendant be\n imprisoned in the penitentiary\n for life; in that case the\n Presiding Judge has no\n discretion, but is bound to\n commute the punishment from\n death to imprisonment for life in\n the penitentiary.’\n\n (1874) 52 Gs 82\n\n\f 92\n\n 89. Later case of Jackson v. State, Ala at\n pp. 29-30 followed the aforementioned\n case. [Also see S.M. Phillipps, Famous\n Cases of Circumstantial Evidence with an\n Introduction on the Theory of Presumptive\n Proof, 50-52 (1875).]\n\n 90. In United States v. Quinones, F Supp\n 2d at p. 267 the Court remarked:\n\n ‘Many States that allow the\n death penalty permit a\n conviction based solely on\n circumstantial evidence only if\n such evidence excludes to a\n moral certainty every other\n reasonable inference except\n guilt.’”\n\n 26. \nIn \nSantosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State\n of Maharashtra70\n, all the accused persons including\n the appellant were unemployed young men in search\n of employment. In execution of a plan proposed by\n the appellant and accepted by them, they kidnapped\n their friend with the motive of procuring ransom from\n his family but later murdered him and after cutting his\n body into pieces disposed of the same at different\n places. One of the accused persons turned approver\n and the prosecution case was based entirely on his\n evidence. The trial court awarded death sentence to\n the appellant. The High Court confirmed the death\n sentence. In appeal, this Court observed that\n punishment cannot be determined on grounds of\n proportionality alone. This Court observed that\n though there was nothing to show that the appellant\n could not be reformed and rehabilitated and the\n manner and method of disposal of the dead body of\n the deceased reflected most foul and despicable case\n of murder, mere mode of disposal of the dead body\n may not by itself be made the ground for inclusion of\n a case in the rarest of rare category for the purpose of\n imposition of death sentence. Other factors require to\n\n 74 Ala 26 (1883)\n 205 F Supp. 2d 256 (SDNY 2002)\n\n\f 93\n\nbe considered along with the aforesaid. This Court\nwas of the view that the fact that the prosecution case\nrested on the evidence of the approver, will have to be\nkept in mind. Further, that where the death sentence is\nto be imposed on the basis of circumstantial evidence,\nthe circumstantial evidence must be such which leads\nto an exceptional case. It was further observed that the\ndiscretion given to the court in such cases assumes\nonerous importance and its exercise becomes\nextremely difficult because of the irrevocable\ncharacter of death penalty. Where two views\nordinarily could be taken, imposition of death\nsentence would not be appropriate. In the\ncircumstances, the death sentence was converted to\nlife imprisonment.\n\n … … …\n\n30. \nIn \nMahesh Dhanaji Shinde v. State of\nMaharashtra74\n, the conviction of the appellant-\naccused was upheld keeping in view that the\ncircumstantial evidence pointed only in the direction\nof their guilt given that the modus operandi of the\ncrime, homicidal death, identity of 9 of 10 victims,\nlast seen theory and other incriminating circumstances\nwere proved. However, the Court has thought it fit to\ncommute the sentence of death to imprisonment for\nlife considering the age, socio-economic conditions,\ncustodial behaviour of the appellant-accused persons\nand that the case was entirely based on circumstantial\nevidence……\n\n31. In the instant case, admittedly the entire web of\nevidence is circumstantial. The appellant-accused’s\nculpability rests on various independent evidence,\nsuch as, him being “last seen” with the deceased\nbefore she went missing; the extra-judicial confession\nof his co-accused before PW 1 and the village\nmembers; corroborative testimonies of the said village\nmembers to the extra-judicial confession and recovery\nof the deceased’s body; coupled with the medical\nevidence which when joined together paint him in the\nblood of the deceased. While the said evidence proves\nthe guilt of the appellant-accused and makes this a fit\ncase for conviction, it does not sufficiently convince\nthe judicial mind to entirely foreclose the option of a\n\n\f 94\n\nsentence lesser than the death penalty. Even though\nthere are no missing links in the chain, the evidence\nalso does not sufficiently provide any direct indicia\nwhereby irrefutable conclusions can be drawn with\nregard to the nexus between “the crime” and “the\ncriminal”. Undoubtedly, the aggravating\ncircumstances reflected through the nature of the\ncrime and young age of the victim make the crime\nsocially abhorrent and demand harsh punishment.\nHowever, there exist the circumstances such as there\nbeing no criminal antecedents of the appellant-\naccused and the entire case having been rested on\ncircumstantial evidence including the extra-judicial\nconfession of a co-accused. These factors impregnate\nthe balance of circumstances and introduce\nuncertainty in the “culpability calculus” and thus,\npersuade us that death penalty is not an inescapable\nconclusion in the instant case. We are inclined to\nconclude that in the present scenario an alternate to\nthe death penalty, that is, imprisonment for life would\nbe appropriate punishment in the present\ncircumstances.\n\n32. In our considered view, in the impugned judgment\nand order, the High Court has rightly noticed that life\nand death are acts of the divine and the divine’s\nauthority has been delegated to the human courts of\nlaw to be only exercised in exceptional circumstances\nwith utmost caution. Further, that the first and\nforemost effort of the Court should be to continue the\nlife till its natural end and the delegated divine\nauthority should be exercised only after arriving at a\nconclusion that no other punishment but for death will\nserve the ends of justice. We have critically\nappreciated the entire evidence in its minutest detail\nand are of the considered opinion that the present case\ndoes not warrant award of the extreme sentence of\ndeath to the appellant-accused and the sentence of life\nimprisonment would be adequate and meet the ends\nof justice. We are of the opinion that the four main\nobjectives which the State intends to achieve, namely,\ndeterrence, prevention, retribution and reformation\ncan be achieved by sentencing the appellant-accused\nfor life.”\n\n\f 95\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n \n(\nx) Nand Kishore v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n\n “15.\n \nThe learned counsel appearing for the State has\n placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in \nMukesh v.\n State (NCT of Delhi\n)33 [known as Nirbhaya case] in\n support of her case and submitted that applying the ratio\n laid down in the aforesaid judgment, the case falls in the\n “rarest of rare” cases attracting death penalty. With\n reference to abovesaid arguments of the learned counsel\n for the State, it is to be noticed that the case of Mukesh33 is\n distinguishable on the facts from the case on hand. It is to\n be noticed that Mukesh33 is a case of gang rape and murder\n of the victim and an attempt to murder of the male victim.\n It was the specific case of the prosecution that the crimes\n were carried out pursuant to a conspiracy and the accused\n were convicted under \nSection 120-B\n IPC apart from other\n offences. Further, as a fact, it was found in the aforesaid\n case that the accused Mukesh had been involved in other\n criminal activity on the same night. Further, it is also to be\n noticed that in the aforesaid case, there was a dying\n declaration, eyewitness to the incident, etc. So far as the\n present case is concerned, it solely rests on circumstantial\n evidence. It is the specific case of the appellant that he was\n denied the proper legal assistance in the matter and he is a\n manhole worker. The appellant was aged about 50 years.\n Further, in this case there is no finding recorded by the\n courts below to the effect that there is no possibility of\n reformation of the appellant. We are of the view that the\n reasons assigned by the trial court as confirmed by the\n High Court, do not constitute special reasons within the\n meaning of \nSection 354(3)\n CrPC to impose death penalty\n on the accused.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n (xi) Md. Mannan v. State of Bihar\n\n “57. In this case, the conviction of the petitioner is based\n on circumstantial evidence and the alleged extra-judicial\n confession made by the petitioner to the police in course\n of investigation, on the basis of which certain recoveries\n\n (2019) 16 SCC 278\n (2019) 16 SCC 584\n\n\f 96\n\n were made. There is no forensic evidence against the\n petitioner. It would, in our view, be unsafe to uphold the\n imposition of death sentence on the petitioner.\n\n … … …\n\n 79. In this case, an eight-year-old innocent girl fell prey to\n the carnal desire and lust of the petitioner. It is not known\n whether there was any premeditation on the part of the\n petitioner to murder the victim. The circumstances in\n which he murdered the victim are also not known. The\n conviction is based on circumstantial evidence and extra-\n judicial confession made by the petitioner to the police in\n course of investigation. There can be no doubt that the\n crime is abhorrent, but it is doubtful as to whether the\n crime committed by the petitioner can be termed as “rarest\n of the rare”.\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n (xii) Dileep Bankar v. State of M.P.\n\n “We are not inclined to interfere with the conviction part.\n However, with respect to sentence, in the facts and\n circumstances of the case, we are inclined to set aside the\n capital sentence. It was stated by learned Counsel for the\n Appellant that the Appellant has become the victim of his\n own past and there is only circumstantial evidence against\n him. We deem it proper to impose the sentence of total 25\n years of imprisonment. However, death sentence is set\n aside.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n Out of these 12 cases, cases at Sl. Nos. (iii), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x),\n\n(xi) and (xii) were decided by benches of three Judges of this Court, while\n\nthe others were decided by benches of two Judges.\n\n38. An important case for study is the decision of this Court in\n\nRameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod vs. State of Gujarat\n , in which the\n\n MANU/SC/1125/2019\n (2009) 5 SCC 740\n\n\f 97\n\naccused was found guilty of offences punishable under \nSections 363\n, \n366\n,\n\n376\n, \n397\n and \n302\n IPC. The victim was a student of 4th standard. The\n\naccused was awarded death sentence. The case was based on the\n\ncircumstantial evidence and Pasayat, J. observed:-\n\n “30. The plea that in a case of circumstantial evidence\n death should not be awarded is without any logic. If the\n circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable\n character in establishing the guilt of the accused, that\n forms the foundation for conviction. That has nothing to\n do with the question of sentence as has been observed by\n this Court in various cases while awarding death sentence.\n The mitigating circumstances and the aggravating\n circumstances have to be balanced. In the balance sheet of\n such circumstances, the fact that the case rests on\n circumstantial evidence has no role to play. In fact in most\n of the cases where death sentence is awarded for rape and\n murder and the like, there is practically no scope for\n having an eyewitness. They are not committed in the\n public view. By the very nature of things in such cases, the\n available evidence is circumstantial evidence. If the said\n evidence has been found to be credible, cogent and\n trustworthy for the purpose of recording conviction, to\n treat that evidence as a mitigating circumstance, would\n amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. The plea\n of learned counsel for the appellant that the conviction is\n based on circumstantial evidence and, therefore, the death\n sentence should not be awarded is clearly unsustainable.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n Having found the appellant guilty of the concerned offences,\n\nPasayat, J. affirmed the award of death sentence.\n\n \nGanguly, J. agreed with Pasayat, J. on the issue of conviction but\n\non the question of sentence he was of the view that the proper sentence\n\nwas imprisonment for life. Ganguly, J. found that the reliance by the High\n\n\f 98\n\nCourt on the decision in \nDhananjoy Chatterjee vs. State of W.B.\n , was\n\nincorrect. It was stated:-\n\n “64. There are vital differences in the facts of the two\n cases. In the present case, there is no allegation that\n the appellant ever misbehaved with the deceased. In\n Dhananjoy83, prior to the date of crime, there were\n many occasions when the victim had been teased by\n Dhananjoy on her way to and back from her school.\n The latest being on 2-3-1990, three days prior to her\n death, when Dhananjoy had asked the deceased to\n accompany him to watch a movie. To that the\n deceased protested and had told her mother about it.\n Then her father had consulted some neighbours and\n thereafter, filed a written complaint to the security\n agency which had hired Dhananjoy and deployed in\n their apartment. The agency had arranged for\n Dhananjoy to be transferred to another apartment.\n Thus there was a motive and a sense of revenge in the\n mind of Dhananjoy in committing the crime against\n the deceased.\n\n After considering various cases, Ganguly, J. observed:-\n\n “117. Keeping these principles in mind, I find that in\n the instant case the appellant is a young man and his\n age was 28 years old as per the version in the charge-\n sheet. He is married and has two daughters. He has no\n criminal antecedents, at least none has been brought\n on record. His behaviour in general was not\n objectionable and certainly not with the deceased girl\n prior to the incident. The unfortunate incident is\n possibly the first crime committed by the appellant.\n He is not otherwise a criminal. Such a person is not a\n threat to the society. His entire life is ahead of him.\n\n … … …\n\n \n120. I agree with His Lordship that the appellant has\n to be convicted on other charges. However, his\n conviction does not automatically lead to his death\n sentence. In my humble opinion instead of death\n (1994) 2 SCC 220\n\n\f 99\n\n sentence a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for life\n will serve the ends of justice. With the aforesaid\n modification of the sentence the appeal is dismissed\n to the extent indicated above.”\n\n The matter was, therefore, referred to a bench of three \nJudges\n\n [Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) vs. State of Gujarat\n 23] which did\n\n not, in terms, disagree with the view taken by Pasayat, J. nor was there\n\n any observation to the contrary on the issue of appreciation of a case\n\n based on circumstantial evidence in capital punishment matters. But the\n\n bench adopted the view taken by Ganguly, J. and stated as under:-\n\n “9. Both the Hon’ble Judges have relied extensively\n on Dhananjoy Chatterjee case83. In this case the death\n sentence had been awarded by the trial court on\n similar facts and confirmed by the Calcutta High\n Court and the appeal too dismissed by this Court\n leading to the execution of the accused. Ganguly, J.\n has, however, drawn a distinction on the facts of that\n case and the present one and held that as the appellant\n was a young man, only 27 years of age, it was\n obligatory on the trial court to have given a finding as\n to a possible rehabilitation and reformation and the\n possibility that he could still become a useful member\n of society in case he was given a chance to do so.\n\n \n10. We are, therefore, of the opinion that in the light\n of the findings recorded by Ganguly, J. it would not\n be proper to maintain the death sentence on the\n appellant. At the same time the gravity of the offence,\n the behaviour of the appellant and the fear and\n concern such incidents generate in ordered society,\n cannot be ignored. We, therefore, feel that a via media\n ought to be adopted in the light of the judgments of\n this Court in \nRamraj v. State of Chhattisgarh\n and\n \nMulla v. State of U.P. In\n these two cases, this Court\n (2010) 1 SCC 573\n (2010) 3 SCC 508\n\n\f 100\n\n has held that the term “imprisonment for life” which\n is found in \nSection 302\n IPC, would mean\n imprisonment for the natural life of the convict\n subject to the powers of the President and the\n Governor under \nArticles 72\n and \n161\n of the\n Constitution of India or of the State Government\n under \nSection 433-A\n of the Code of Criminal\n Procedure.”\n\n39. It is also required be noted here that there was disagreement\n\nbetween two Judges who heard \nSwamy Sharaddananda vs. State of\n\nKarnataka75\n. Sinha, J. was of the view that the accused be given life\n\nsentence while Katju, J. affirmed the award of death sentence. The matter\n\nwas therefore referred to a bench of three Judges whose decision is\n\nreported as Swamy Shraddananda (2)69 which found the observations of\n\nKatju, J. that “there cannot be an absolute rule excluding death sentence in\n\nall cases of circumstantial evidence” to be correct. The bench however\n\nformulated a special category of sentence in paragraphs 91 to 93 of its\n\ndecision.\n\n However, the subsequent decision in Kalu Khan17 quoted with\n\napproval paragraphs 88 to 90 from the opinion of Sinha, J when the matter\n\nwas heard by two Judges of this Court in Swamy Shraddananda75.\n\n40. These cases discussed in preceding paragraphs show that though it\n\nis accepted that the observations in Swamy Shraddananda (2)69 did not lay\n\ndown any firm principle that in a case involving circumstantial evidence,\n\nimposition of death penalty would not be permissible, a definite line of\n\n\f 101\n\nthought that where the sentence of death is to be imposed on the basis of\n\ncircumstantial evidence, the circumstantial evidence must be such which\n\nleads to an exceptional case was accepted by a bench of three Judges of\n\nthis Court in Kalu Khan17. As a matter of fact, it accepted the caution\n\nexpressed by Sinha J. in \nSwamy Shraddananda vs. State of Karnataka75\n\nand the conclusions in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar70 to restate\n\nthe principles with clarity in its decision.\n\n41. It can therefore be summed up :-\n\n a) it is not as if imposition of death penalty is impermissible to be\n\n awarded in circumstantial evidence cases; and\n\n b) if the circumstantial evidence is of an unimpeachable character in\n\n establishing the guilt of the accused and leads to an exceptional\n\n case or the evidence sufficiently convinces the judicial mind that\n\n the option of a sentence lesser than death penalty is foreclosed, the\n\n death penalty can be imposed.\n\n42. It must therefore be held that merely because the instant case is\n\nbased on circumstantial evidence there is no reason to commute the death\n\nsentence. However, the matter must be considered in the light of the\n\naforestated principles and see whether the circumstantial evidence is of\n\nunimpeachable character and the option of a lesser sentence is foreclosed.\n\n\f 102\n\n43. Before we deal with the matter from the perspective as stated\n\nabove, we must consider the submission advanced by Ms. Mathur, learned\n\nSenior Advocate with regard to “residual doubt” as said submission also\n\ntouches upon the character of evidence.\n\n44. The theory of “residual doubt” was noted for the first time by a\n\nbench of two judges of this Court in \nAshok Debbarma Alias Achak\n\nDebbarma vs. State of Tripura18\n. The discussion in paragraphs 30 to 34\n\nunder the caption “residual doubt” was as under:-\n\n \n“30. An accused has a profound right not to be convicted\n of an offence which is not established by the evidential\n standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. This Court\n in \nKrishnan v. State\n, held that the\n\n “doubts would be called reasonable if they are\n free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law\n cannot afford any favourite other than truth. To\n constitute reasonable doubt, it must be free\n from an overemotional response. Doubts must\n be actual and substantial doubts as to the guilt\n of the accused persons arising from the\n evidence, or from the lack of it, as opposed to\n mere vague apprehensions. A reasonable doubt\n is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely possible\n doubt, but a fair doubt based upon reason and\n common sense. It must grow out of the\n evidence in the case”.\n\n \nIn \nRamakant Rai v. Madan Rai\n, the above principle has\n been reiterated.\n\n (2003) 7 SCC 56 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1577\n (2003) 12 SCC 395 : 2004 SCC (Cri) Supp 445\n\n\f 103\n\n 31. In Commonwealth v. Webster at p. 320, Massachusetts\n Court, as early as in 1850, has explained the expression\n “reasonable doubt” as follows:\n\n “Reasonable doubt … is not a mere possible\n doubt; because everything relating to human\n affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is\n open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is\n that state of the case which, after the entire\n comparison and consideration of all the\n evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that\n condition that they cannot say they feel an\n abiding conviction.”\n\n In our criminal justice system, for recording guilt of the\n accused, it is not necessary that the prosecution should\n prove the case with absolute or mathematical certainty, but\n only beyond reasonable doubt. Criminal courts, while\n examining whether any doubt is beyond reasonable doubt,\n may carry in their mind, some “residual doubt”, even\n though the courts are convinced of the accused persons’\n guilt beyond reasonable doubt. For instance, in the instant\n case, it was pointed out that, according to the prosecution,\n 30-35 persons armed with weapons such as firearms, dao,\n lathi, etc., set fire to the houses of the villagers and opened\n fire which resulted in the death of 15 persons, but only\n eleven persons were charge-sheeted and, out of which,\n charges were framed only against five accused persons.\n Even out of those five persons, three were acquitted,\n leaving the appellant and another, who is absconding. The\n court, in such circumstances, could have entertained a\n “residual doubt” as to whether the appellant alone had\n committed the entire crime, which is a mitigating\n circumstance to be taken note of by the court, at least\n when the court is considering the question whether the\n case falls under the rarest of the rare category.\n\n 32. “Residual doubt” is a mitigating circumstance,\n sometimes used and urged before the jury in the United\n States and, generally, not found favour by the various\n courts in the United States. In Franklin v. Lynaugh, while\n dealing with the death sentence, the Court held as follows:\n\n “The petitioner also contends that the sentencing\n procedures followed in his case prevented the\n jury from considering, in mitigation of sentence,\n (1850) 5 Cush 295 : 52 Am Dec 711 (Mass Sup Ct)\n 101 L Ed 2d 155 : 487 US 164 (1988)\n\n\f 104\n\n any ‘residual doubts’ it might have had about his\n guilt. The petitioner uses the phrase ‘residual\n doubts’ to refer to doubts that may have lingered\n in the minds of jurors who were convinced of\n his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but who\n were not absolutely certain of his guilt. Brief for\n Petitioner 14. The plurality and dissent reject\n the petitioner’s ‘residual doubt’ claim because\n they conclude that the special verdict questions\n did not prevent the jury from giving mitigating\n effect to its ‘residual doubts’ about the\n petitioner’s guilt. See ante at Franklin, US p.\n 175; post at Franklin, US p. 189. This\n conclusion is open to question, however.\n Although the jury was permitted to consider\n evidence presented at the guilt phase in the\n course of answering the special verdict\n questions, the jury was specifically instructed to\n decide whether the evidence supported\n affirmative answers to the special questions\n ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’. App. 15\n (emphasis added). Because of this instruction,\n the jury might not have thought that, in\n sentencing the petitioner, it was free to demand\n proof of his guilt beyond all doubt.”\n\n 33. In California v. Brown and other cases, the US courts\n took the view, “residual doubt” is not a fact about the\n defendant or the circumstances of the crime, but a\n lingering uncertainty about facts, a state of mind that\n exists somewhere between “beyond a reasonable doubt”\n and “absolute certainty”. The petitioner’s “residual doubt”\n claim is that the States must permit capital sentencing\n bodies to demand proof of guilt to “an absolute certainty”\n before imposing the death sentence. Nothing in our cases\n mandates the imposition of this heightened burden of\n proof at capital sentencing.\n\n 34. We also, in this country, as already indicated, expect\n the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,\n but not with “absolute certainty”. But, in between\n “reasonable doubt” and “absolute certainty”, a decision-\n\n maker’s mind may wander, possibly in a given case he\n may go for “absolute certainty” so as to award death\n sentence, short of that he may go for “beyond reasonable\n doubt”. Suffice it to say, so far as the present case is\n concerned, we entertained a lingering doubt as to whether\n\n 93 L Ed 2d 934 : 479 US 538 (1987)\n\n\f 105\n\n the appellant alone could have executed the crime single-\n handedly, especially when the prosecution itself says that\n it was the handiwork of a large group of people. If that be\n so, in our view, the crime perpetrated by a group of people\n in an extremely brutal, grotesque and dastardly manner,\n could not have been thrown upon the appellant alone\n without charge-sheeting other group of persons numbering\n around 35. All the element test as well as the residual\n doubt test, in a given case, may favour the accused, as a\n mitigating factor.”\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n45. The decision of this Court in Ashok Debbarma18 was relied upon\n\nin following decisions by benches of three judges of this Court:-\n\n(A) In Sudam alias \nRahul Kniram Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra19\n\nthe appellant was convicted of having caused the death of five persons;\n\ni.e. the lady who was living with him as his wife, two children from her\n\nprevious marriage and two children from the appellant. The death\n\nsentence awarded to him was confirmed by this Court. However, in\n\nreview petition, the sentence was commuted to “imprisonment for the\n\nremainder of his life sans any right to remission”. The discussion was as\n\nunder:\n\n \n“19.1. At this juncture, it must be noted that though it may\n be a relevant consideration in sentencing that the evidence\n in a given case is circumstantial in nature, there is no bar\n on the award of the death sentence in cases based upon\n such evidence (see \nSwamy Shraddananda v. State of\n Karnataka75\n and \nRamesh v. State of Rajasthan\n).\n\n (2011) 3 SCC 685\n\n\f 106\n\n19.2. In such a situation, it is up to the Court to determine\nwhether the accused may be sentenced to death upon the\nstrength of circumstantial evidence, given the peculiar\nfacts and circumstances of each case, while assessing all\nthe relevant aggravating circumstances of the crime, such\nas its brutality, enormity and premeditated nature, and\nmitigating circumstances of the accused, such as his socio-\n\neconomic background, age, extreme emotional disturbance\nat the time of commission of the offence, and so on.\n\n19.3. \nIn this regard, it would also be pertinent to refer to\nthe discussion in \nAshok Debbarma v. State of Tripura86\n,\nwhere this Court elaborated upon the concept of “residual\ndoubt” which simply means that in spite of being\nconvinced of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable\ndoubt, the Court may harbour lingering or residual doubts\nin its mind regarding such guilt. This Court noted that the\nexistence of residual doubt was a ground sometimes urged\nbefore American courts as a mitigating circumstance with\nrespect to imposing the death sentence, and noted as\nfollows:\n\n “33. In California v. Brown90 and other cases, the\n US courts took the view, “residual doubt” is not a\n fact about the defendant or the circumstances of the\n crime, but a lingering uncertainty about facts, a\n state of mind that exists somewhere between\n “beyond a reasonable doubt” and “absolute\n certainty”. The petitioner’s “residual doubt” claim is\n that the States must permit capital sentencing bodies\n to demand proof of guilt to “an absolute certainty”\n before imposing the death sentence. Nothing in our\n cases mandates the imposition of this heightened\n burden of proof at capital sentencing.\n\n 34. We also, in this country, as already indicated,\n expect the prosecution to prove its case beyond\n reasonable doubt, but not with “absolute certainty”.\n\n But, in between “reasonable doubt” and “absolute\n certainty”, a decision-maker’s mind may wander,\n possibly in a given case he may go for “absolute\n certainty” so as to award death sentence, short of\n that he may go for “beyond reasonable doubt”.\n Suffice it to say, so far as the present case is\n concerned, we entertained a lingering doubt as to\n whether the appellant alone could have executed the\n crime single-handedly, especially when the\n prosecution itself says that it was the handiwork of a\n large group of people. If that be so, in our view, the\n\n\f 107\n\n crime perpetrated by a group of people in an\n extremely brutal, grotesque and dastardly manner,\n could not have been thrown upon the appellant alone\n without charge-sheeting other group of persons\n numbering around 35. All the element test as well as\n the residual doubt test, in a given case, may favour\n the accused, as a mitigating factor.”\n\n19.4. While the concept of “residual doubt” has\nundoubtedly not been given much attention in Indian\ncapital sentencing jurisprudence, the fact remains that this\nCourt has on several occasions held the quality of\nevidence to a higher standard for passing the irrevocable\nsentence of death than that which governs conviction, that\nis to say, it has found it unsafe to award the death penalty\nfor convictions based on the nature of the circumstantial\nevidence on record. \nIn fact, this question was given some\nattention in a recent decision by this Bench, in \nMohd.\nMannan v. State of Bihar80\n, where we found it unsafe to\naffirm the death penalty awarded to the accused in light of\nthe nature of the evidence on record, though the conviction\nhad been affirmed on the basis of circumstantial evidence.\n\n … … …\n\n“21. Evidently, even the fact that the evidence was\ncircumstantial in nature did not weigh very heavily on the\nCourt’s mind, let alone the strength and nature of the\ncircumstantial evidence. Be that as it may, we find that the\nmaterial on record is sufficient to convince the Court of\nthe petitioner’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt; however,\nthe nature of the circumstantial evidence in this case\namounts to a mitigating circumstance significant enough\nto tilt the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances in the petitioner’s favour, keeping in mind\nthe doctrine of prudence. Moreover, it is also possible that\nthe incorrect observations pertaining to Anita’s facial\ninjuries further led the Court to conclude in favour of\nimposing the death sentence on the petitioner. Thus, we\nare of the considered opinion that there was a reasonable\nprobability that this Court would have set aside the\nsentence of death in appeal, since the only surviving\nevidence against the petitioner herein pertains to his\nmotive to commit the crime, the circumstance of “last\nseen” and a solitary extra-judicial confession. In other\nwords, it cannot be said that the punishment of life\nimprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed in the instant\ncase, in spite of the gravity and barbarity of the offence.\n\n\f 108\n\n 22. We are thus compelled to conclude that the award of\n the death penalty in the instant case, based on the evidence\n on record, cannot be upheld.\n\n 23. At the same time, we conclude that a sentence of life\n imprisonment simpliciter would be inadequate in the\n instant case, given the gruesome nature of the offence, and\n the menace posed to society at large by the petitioner, as\n evinced by the conduct of the petitioner in jail. As per the\n report submitted in pursuance of the order of this Court\n dated 31-10-2018, it has been brought on record that the\n conduct of the petitioner in jail has been unsatisfactory,\n and that he gets aggressive and indulges in illegal\n activities in prison, intentionally abusing prisoners and\n prison staff and provoking fights with other prisoners. Two\n FIRs have also been registered against the petitioner for\n abusing and threatening the Superintendent of the Nagpur\n Central Prison.\n\n \n23.1. As this Court has already held in a catena of\n decisions, by way of a via media between life\n imprisonment simpliciter and the death sentence, it may be\n appropriate to impose a restriction on the petitioner’s right\n to remission of the sentence of life imprisonment, which\n usually works out to 14 years in prison upon remission.\n We may fruitfully refer to the decisions in \nSwamy\n Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka69\n and \nUnion of\n India v. V. Sriharan\n, in this regard.\n \nWe therefore direct\n that the petitioner shall remain in prison for the remainder\n of his life.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n(B) In Ravishankar alias \nBaba Vishwakarma v. State of Madhya\n\nPradesh20\n, the appellant was convicted under \nSections 376\n, \n302\n and \n376A\n\nof IPC and also under the provisions of \nPOCSO Act\n for having raped and\n\ncaused the murder by throttling of a 13 years old girl. The death sentence\n\nawarded by the trial court was confirmed by the High Court but in appeal\n\nthe death sentence was substituted by this Court with imprisonment for\n\n (2016) 7 SCC 1 : (2016) 2 SCC Cri 695\n\n\f 109\n\nlife with a direction that “no remission to be granted and that the appellant\n\nshall remain in prison for rest of his life”. The relevant passages from the\n\ndecision are:-\n\n \n“57. Such imposition of a higher standard of proof for\n purposes of death sentencing over and above “beyond\n reasonable doubt” necessary for criminal conviction is\n similar to the “residual doubt” metric adopted by this\n Court in \nAshok Debbarma v. State of Tripura18\n wherein it\n was noted that: (SCC p. 763, para 31)\n\n “31. … In our criminal justice system, for\n recording guilt of the accused, it is not necessary\n that the prosecution should prove the case with\n absolute or mathematical certainty, but only\n beyond reasonable doubt. Criminal courts, while\n examining whether any doubt is beyond\n reasonable doubt, may carry in their mind, some\n “residual doubt”, even though the courts are\n convinced of the accused persons’ guilt beyond\n reasonable doubt.”\n\n \n58. Ashok Debbarma18 drew a distinction between a\n “residual doubt”, which is any remaining or lingering\n doubt about the defendant’s guilt which might remain at\n the sentencing stage despite satisfaction of the “beyond a\n reasonable doubt” standard during conviction, and\n reasonable doubts which as defined in \nKrishnan v. State86\n\n are “actual and substantive, and not merely imaginary,\n trivial or merely possible”. These “residual doubts”\n although not relevant for conviction, would tilt towards\n mitigating circumstance to be taken note of whilst\n considering whether the case falls under the “rarest of\n rare” category.\n\n 59. This theory is also recognised in other jurisdictions\n like the United States, where some State courts like the\n Supreme Court of Tennessee in State v. McKinney have\n explained that residual doubt of guilt is a valid non-\n\n statutory mitigating circumstance during the sentencing\n stage and have allowed for new evidence during\n sentencing proceedings related to defendant’s character,\n background history, physical condition, etc.\n\n 74 SW 3d 291\n\n\f 110\n\n60. The above-cited principles have been minutely\nobserved by us, taking into consideration the peculiar facts\nand circumstances of the case in hand. At the outset, we\nwould highlight that the High Court while confirming\ndeath has observed that the girl was found bleeding due to\nforcible sexual intercourse, which fact, however, is not\nsupported by medical evidence. However, such erroneous\nfinding has no impact on conviction under \nSection 376-A\n\nIPC for a bare perusal of the section shows that only the\nfactum of death of the victim during the offence of rape is\nrequired, and such death need not be with any guilty\nintention or be a natural consequence of the act of rape\nonly. It is worded broadly enough to include death by any\nact committed by the accused if done contemporaneously\nwith the crime of rape. Any other interpretation would\ndefeat the object of ensuring safety of women and would\nperpetuate the earlier loophole of the rapists claiming lack\nof intention to cause death to seek a reduced charge under\n\nSection 304\n IPC as noted in the Report of the Committee\non Amendments to Criminal Law, headed by Justice J.S.\nVerma, former Chief Justice of India:\n\n “22. While we believe that enhanced penalties\n in a substantial number of sexual assault cases\n can be adjudged on the basis of the law \nlaid\n down in\n the aforesaid cases, certain situations\n warrant a specific treatment. We believe that\n where the offence of sexual assault, particularly\n “gang rapes”, is accompanied by such brutality\n and violence that it leads to death or a persistent\n vegetative state (or “PVS” in medical\n terminology), punishment must be severe —\n with the minimum punishment being life\n imprisonment. While we appreciate the\n argument that where such offences result in\n death, the case may also be tried under \nSection\n 302\n IPC as a “rarest of the rare” case, we must\n acknowledge that many such cases may actually\n fall within the ambit of Section 304 (Part II)\n since the “intention to kill” may often not be\n established. In the case of violence resulting in\n persistent vegetative state is concerned, we are\n reminded of the moving story of Aruna\n Shanbaug, the young nurse who was brutally\n raped and lived the rest of her life (i.e. almost\n 36 years) in a persistent vegetative state.\n\n 23. In our opinion, such situations must be treated\n differently because the concerted effort to rape\n\n\f 111\n\n and to inflict violence may disclose an intention\n deserving an enhanced punishment. We have\n therefore recommended that a specific provision,\n namely, Section 376(3) should be inserted in the\n \nIndian Penal Code\n to deal with the offence of\n “rape followed by death or resulting in a\n persistent vegetative state”.”\n\n 61. In the present case, there are some residual doubts in\n our mind. A crucial witness for constructing the last seen\n theory, PW 5 is partly inconsistent in cross-examination\n and quickly jumps from one statement to the other. Two\n other witnesses, PW 6 and PW 7 had seen the appellant\n feeding biscuits to the deceased one year before the\n incident and their long delay in reporting the same fails to\n inspire confidence. The mother of the deceased has\n deposed that the wife and daughter of the appellant came\n to her house and demanded the return of the money which\n she had borrowed from them but failed to mention that she\n suspected the appellant of committing the crime initially.\n Ligature marks on the neck evidencing throttling were\n noted by PW 20 and PW 12 and in the post-mortem report,\n but find no mention in the panchnama prepared by the\n police. Viscera samples sent for chemical testing were\n spoilt and hence remained unexamined. Although nails’\n scrapings of the accused were collected, no report has\n been produced to show that DNA of the deceased was\n present. Another initial suspect, Baba alias Ashok Kaurav\n absconded during investigation, hence, gave rise to the\n possibility of involvement of more than one person. All\n these factors of course have no impact in formation of the\n chain of evidence and are wholly insufficient to create\n reasonable doubt to earn acquittal.\n\n 62. We are cognizant of the fact that use of such “residual\n doubt” as a mitigating factor would effectively raise the\n standard of proof for imposing the death sentence, the\n benefit of which would be availed of not by the innocent\n only. However, it would be a misconception to make a\n cost-benefit comparison between cost to society owing to\n acquittal of one guilty versus loss of life of a perceived\n innocent. This is because the alternative to death does not\n necessarily imply setting the convict free.\n\n 63. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in\n Herrera v. Collins, “it is an unalterable fact that our\n judicial system, like the human beings who administer it,\n\n (1993) SCC OnLine US SC 10 : 122 L Ed 2d 203\n\n\f 112\n\n is fallible”. However, death being irrevocable, there lies a\n greater degree of responsibility on the court for an in-\n depth scrutiny of the entire material on record. Still\n further, qualitatively, the penalty imposed by awarding\n death is much different than in incarceration, both for the\n convict and for the State. Hence, a corresponding\n distinction in requisite standards of proof by taking note of\n “residual doubt” during sentencing would not be\n unwarranted.\n\n 64. We are thus of the considered view that the present\n case falls short of the “rarest of rare” cases where the\n death sentence alone deserves to be awarded to the\n appellant. It appears to us in the light of all the cumulative\n circumstances that the cause of justice will be effectively\n served by invoking the concept of special sentencing\n theory as evolved by this Court in Swamy Shraddananda\n (2)69 and approved in Sriharan case92.”\n\n46. Since reference was made in the aforestated decisions of this Court\n\nto certain decisions of US Supreme Court, we may now consider those\n\ndecisions and some other decisions of US Supreme Court on the point and\n\nwhether the theory of “residual doubt” has found acceptance in the\n\ndecisions of US Supreme Court.\n\nA] California vs. Brown90\n\n (a) The relevant facts noted in the opinion of the Court delivered by\n\n Chief Justice Rehnquist were:-\n\n “Respondent Albert Brown was found guilty by a jury of\n forcible rape and first-degree murder in the death of 15-\n year-old Susan J. At the penalty phase, the State presented\n evidence that respondent had raped another young girl\n some years prior to his attack on Susan J. Respondent\n presented the testimony of several family members, who\n recounted respondent’s peaceful nature and expressed\n disbelief that respondent was capable of such a brutal\n crime. Respondent also presented the testimony of a\n\n\f 113\n\n psychiatrist, who stated that Brown killed his victim\n because of his shame and fear over sexual dysfunction.\n Brown himself testified, stating that he was ashamed of his\n prior criminal conduct and asking for mercy from the\n jury.”\n\n While instructing the jury to consider the aggravating and\n\nmitigating circumstances and to weigh them in determining the\n\nappropriate penalty, the trial Court had cautioned the jury-\n\n “that it “must not be swayed by mere sentiment,\n conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or\n public feeling.”\n\n The instruction so issued was found to have violated the Eighth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments by the Supreme Court of California which\n\ndecision was reversed by US Supreme Court as under: -\n\n “We hold that the instruction challenged in this case does\n not violate the provisions of the Eighth and Fourteenth\n Amendments to the United States Constitution. The\n judgment of the Supreme Court of California is therefore\n reversed, and the cause is remanded for further\n proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.”\n\n (b) Justice O’Connor authored a concurring opinion and stated:-\n\n “Because the individualized assessment of the\n appropriateness of the death penalty is a moral inquiry\n into the culpability of the defendant, and not an\n emotional response to the mitigating evidence, I agree\n with the Court that an instruction informing the jury that\n they “must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture,\n sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public\n feeling” does not by itself violate the Eighth and\n Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n Constitution. At the same time, the jury instructions –\n taken as a whole – must clearly inform the jury that they\n are to consider any relevant mitigating evidence about a\n defendant’s background and character, or about the\n circumstances of the crime.”\n\n\f 114\n\n (c) Justice Brennan (with whom Justice Marshall and Justice\n\n Stevens joined) dissented and observed:-\n\n “The prosecutor in this case thus interpreted the\n antisympathy instruction to require that the jury ignore the\n defendant’s evidence on the mitigating factors of his\n character and upbringing. A similar construction has been\n placed on the instruction in several other cases.”\n\n (d) Justice Blackmun (with whom Justice Marshall joined) also\n\n dissented and stated: -\n\n “The sentencer’s ability to respond with mercy towards a\n defendant has always struck me as a particularly valuable\n aspect of the capital sentencing procedure. …….\n\n ….In my view, we adhere so strongly to our belief that\n sentencers should have the opportunity to spare a capital\n defendant’s life on account of compassion for the\n individual because, recognizing that the capital sentencing\n decision must be made in the context of “contemporary\n values,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 181, 96 S.Ct., at\n 2928 (opinion of Stewart, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.),\n we see in the sentencer’s expression of mercy a distinctive\n feature of our society that we deeply value.”\n\n Thus, the entire discussion was confined to the validity of the\n\ninstruction given to the Jury and the issue of “residual doubt” never arose\n\nfor consideration.\n\nB] Franklin v. Lynaugh89\n\n The jury had found Franklin guilty of capital murder. At the\n\nconclusion of penalty hearing, the trial court submitted two “Special\n\nIssues” to the jury, instructing the jury that if they determined the answer to\n\n\f 115\n\nboth these questions to be “Yes,” Franklin would be sentenced to death.\n\nThe issues were:\n\n “Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable\n doubt that the conduct of the Defendant, Donal Gene\n Franklin, that caused the death of Mary Margaret Moran,\n was committed deliberately and with the reasonable\n expectation that the death of the deceased or another\n would result?\n\n Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt\n that there is a probability that the Defendant, Donald Gene\n Franklin, would commit criminal acts of violence that\n would constitute a continuing threat to society.”\n\n Franklin however requested for jury instructions as follows:-\n “you are instructed that any evidence which, in your\n opinion, mitigates against the imposition of the Death,\n Penalty, including any aspect of the Defendant’s character\n or record, and any of the circumstances of the commission\n of the offense …. may be sufficient to cause you to have a\n reasonable doubt as to whether or not the true answer of\n any of the Special Issues is “Yes”; and in the event such\n evidence does cause you to have such a reasonable doubt,\n you should answer the Issue “No””\n\n The request of Franklin was rejected and the jury answered both\n\nspecial issues in affirmative whereafter the trial Court imposed death\n\nsentence. In Federal habeas action filed by Franklin, the submission was\n\nrecorded:-\n\n “Petitioner first suggests that the jury may, in its penalty\n deliberations, have harbored “residual doubts” about three\n issues considered in the guilt phase of his trial: first,\n petitioner’s identity as the murderer; second, the extent to\n which petitioner’s actions (as opposed to medical\n mistreatment) actually caused the victim’s death; and\n\n\f 116\n\n third, the extent to which petitioner’s actions were\n intended to result in the victim’s death.”\n\n(a) The decision of the Court was delivered by Justice White and the\n\nquestion was formulated as under:-\n\n “In this case, we are called on to determine if the Eighth\n Amendment required a Texas trial court to give certain\n jury instructions, relating to the consideration of\n mitigating evidence, that petitioner had requested in the\n sentencing phase of his capital trial”\n\n Rejecting the challenge it was observed:-\n\n “At the outset, we note that this Court has never held that\n a capital defendant has a constitutional right to an\n instruction telling the jury to revisit the question of his\n identity as the murderer as a basis for mitigation.\n\n … … …\n\n Our edict that, in a capital case, \" 'the sentencer . . . may\n not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor,\n any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of\n the circumstances of the offense,' \" Eddings v. Oklahoma,\n 455 U.S. 104, 110, 102 S.Ct. 869, 874, 71 L.Ed.2d 1\n (1982) (quoting Lockett, 438 U.S., at 604, 98 S.Ct., at\n 2964), in no way mandates reconsideration by capital\n juries, in the sentencing phase, of their \"residual doubts\"\n\n over a defendant's guilt. Such lingering doubts are not over\n any aspect of petitioner's \"character,\" \"record,\" or a\n \"circumstance of the offense.\" This Court's prior decisions,\n as we understand them, fail to recognize a constitutional\n right to have such doubts considered as a mitigating\n factor.\"\n\nb) Justice O’Connor (with whom Justice Blackmun joined)\n\nauthored a concurring judgement and the submission of Franklin was\n\nnoted as under:-\n\n\f 117\n\n “Petitioner also contends that the sentencing procedures\n followed in his case prevented the jury from considering,\n in mitigation of sentence, any “residual doubt[s]” it might\n have had about his guilt. Petitioner uses the phrase\n “residual doubts” to refer to doubts that may have lingered\n in the minds of jurors who were convinced of his guilt\n beyond a reasonable doubt, but who were not absolutely\n certain of his guilt. Brief for Petitioner 14. The plurality\n and dissent reject petitioner's “residual doubt” claim\n because they conclude that the special verdict questions\n did not prevent the jury from giving mitigating effect to its\n “residual doubts” about petitioner's guilt. See ante at 2328:\n\n post, at 2335. This conclusion is open to question,\n however. Although the jury was permitted to consider\n evidence presented at the guilt phase in the course of\n answering the special verdict questions, the jury was\n specifically instructed to decide whether the evidence\n supported affirmative answers to the special questions\n “beyond a reasonable doubt.” App. 15 (emphasis added).\n Because of this instruction, the jury might not have\n thought that, in sentencing the petitioner, it was free to\n demand proof of his guilt beyond all doubt.”\n\n Justice O’Connor rejected the submission and observed: -\n\n “In my view, petitioner's \"residual doubt\" claim fails, not\n because the Texas scheme allowed for consideration of\n \"residual doubt\" by the sentencing body, but rather\n because the Eighth Amendment does not require it. Our\n cases do not support the proposition that a defendant who\n has been found to be guilty of a capital crime beyond a\n reasonable doubt has a constitutional right to\n reconsideration by the sentencing body of lingering doubts\n about his guilt. We have recognized that some States have\n adopted capital sentencing procedures that permit\n defendants in some cases to enjoy the benefit of doubts\n that linger from the guilt phase of the trial, see Lockhart v.\n McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 181, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 1769, 90\n L.Ed.2d 137 (1986), but we have never indicated that the\n Eighth Amendment requires States to adopt such\n procedures. To the contrary, as the plurality points out, we\n have approved capital sentencing procedures that preclude\n consideration by the sentencing body of \"residual doubts\"\n about guilt. See ante, at 2327, n. 6.\n\n The footnote reads thus:-\n\n “Finding a constitutional right to rely on a guilt-phase jury’s “residual doubts” about\n innocence when the defense presents its mitigating case in the penalty phase is\n\n\f 118\n\n Our decisions mandating jury consideration of mitigating\n circumstances provide no support for petitioner's claim\n because \"residual doubt\" about guilt is not a mitigating\n circumstance. We have defined mitigating circumstances\n as facts about the defendant's character or background, or\n the circumstances of the particular offense, that may call\n for a penalty less than death. See California v. Brown, 479\n U.S., at 541, 107 S.Ct., at 839; id., at 544, 107 S.Ct., at\n 840 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring); Eddings, 455 U.S., at\n 110, 112, 102 S.Ct., at 874, 875; id., at 117, 102 S.Ct., at\n 878 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring); Lockett, 438 U.S., at\n 605, 98 S.Ct., at 2965. \"Residual doubt\" is not a fact about\n the defendant or the circumstances of the crime. It is\n instead a lingering uncertainty about facts, a state of mind\n that exists somewhere between \"beyond a reasonable\n doubt\" and \"absolute certainty.\" Petitioner's \"residual\n doubt\" claim is that the States must permit capital\n sentencing bodies to demand proof of guilt to \"an absolute\n certainty\" before imposing the death sentence. Nothing in\n our cases mandates the imposition of this heightened\n burden of proof at capital sentencing.\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n During the course of her judgment, Justice O’Connor also made\n\nfollowing observations: -\n\n \narguably inconsistent with the common practice of allowing penalty-only trials on\n remand of cases where a death sentence-but not the underlying conviction-is struck\n down on appeal. See, e.g. \nScott v. State\n, 310 Md. 277, 301, 529 A.2d 340, 352 (1987);\n Stringer v. State, 492 A.2d 928, 946 (Miss.1986); \nWhalen v. State\n, 492 A.2d 552, 569\n (Del.1985).\n Cf. Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S., at 205, 106 S.Ct., at 1781\n (MARSHALL, J. dissenting).\n\n In fact, this Court has, on several previous occasions, suggested such a method of\n proceeding on remand, See, e.g. , Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U.S. 393, 399, 107 S.Ct.\n 1821, 1824, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). Moreover, petitioner himself, in suggesting the\n appropriate relief in this case, asked only that he be “resentenced in a proceeding that\n comports with requirements of Lockett” – not that he be retried in full so as to have\n the benefit of any potential guilt-phase “residual doubts.” See Brief for petitioner 21.\n\n In sum, we are quite doubtful that such “penalty-only” trials are violative of a\n defendant’s Eighth Amendment rights. Yet such is the logical conclusion of\n petitioner’s claim of a constitutional right to argue “residual doubts” to a capital\n sentencing jury.”\n\n\f 119\n\n “In my view, the principle underlying Lockett, Eddings,\n and Hitchcock is that punishment should be directly\n related to the personal culpability of the criminal\n defendant.\n\n “Evidence about the defendant’s background and character\n is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society,\n that defendants who commit criminal acts that are\n attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to\n emotional and mental problems, may be less culpable than\n defendants who have no such excuse…. Thus, the\n sentence imposed at the penalty stage should reflect a\n reasoned moral response to the defendant’s background,\n character, and crime.” California v. Brown, 479 U.S.538,\n 545, 107 S.Ct. 837, 841, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987)\n (O’CONNOR, J., concurring) (emphasis in original)\n\n In light of this principle it is clear that a State may not\n constitutionally prevent the sentencing body from giving\n effect to evidence relevant to the defendant’s background\n or character or the circumstances of the offense that\n mitigates against the death penalty. Indeed, the right to\n have the sentencer consider and weigh relevant mitigating\n evidence would be meaningless unless the sentencer was\n also permitted to give effect to its consideration.\n\n Under the sentencing procedure followed in this case the\n jury could express its views about the appropriate\n punishment only by answering the special verdict\n questions regarding the deliberations of the murder and the\n defendant’s future dangerousness. To the extent that the\n mitigating evidence introduced by petitioner was relevant\n to one of the special verdict questions, the jury was free to\n give effect to that evidence by returning a negative answer\n to that question. If, however, petitioner had introduced\n mitigating evidence about his background or character or\n the circumstances of the crime that was not relevant to the\n special verdict questions, or that had relevance to the\n defendant’s moral culpability beyond the scope of the\n special verdict questions, the jury instructions would have\n provided the jury with no vehicle for expressing its\n “reasoned moral responds” to that evidence.”\n\n … … …\n\n 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978)\n 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869. 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982)\n 481 U.S. 393, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987)\n\n\f 120\n\n Noting in Lockett or Eddings requires that the sentencing\n authority be permitted to give effect to evidence beyond\n the extent to which it is relevant to the defendant’s\n character or background or the circumstances of the\n offense.”\n\n (c) The dissenting opinion authored by Justice Stevens (joined by\n\n Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall) stated: -\n\n “In requiring that the discretion of the sentencer in capital\n sentencing be guided, we have never suggested that the\n sentencer’s discretion could be guided by blinding it to\n relevant evidence. The hallmark of a sentencing scheme\n that sufficiently guides and directs the sentencer is the\n presence of procedures that “require the jury to consider\n the circumstances of the crime and the criminal before it\n recommends sentence.” Id., at 197, 96 S.Ct., at 2936. The\n requirement that the State not bar the sentencer from\n considering any mitigating aspect of the offense or the\n offender only furthers the goal of focusing the sentencer’s\n attention on the defendant and the particular circumstances\n of the crime.”\n\nC] Herrera Vs. Collins94\n\n The syllabus prepared by the Reporter of Decisions summed up the\n\nfacts as under :-\n\n “On the basis of proof which included two eyewitness\n identifications, numerous pieces of circumstantial\n evidence, and petitioner Herrera’s handwritten letter\n impliedly admitting his guilt, Herrera was convicted of the\n capital murder of Police Officer Carrisalez and sentenced\n to death in January 1982. After pleading guilty, in July\n 1982, to the related capital murder of Officer Rucker,\n Herrera unsuccessfully challenged the Carrisalez\n conviction on direct appeal and in two collateral\n proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a federal\n habeas petition. Ten years after his conviction, he urged in\n second federal habeas proceeding that newly discovered\n evidence demonstrated that he was “actually innocent” of\n\n\f 121\n\n the murders of Carrisalez and Rucker, and that the Eighth\n Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual\n punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process\n guarantee therefore forbid his execution. He supported this\n claim with affidavits tending to show that his now-dead\n brother had committed the murders. The District Court,\n inter alia, granted his request for a stay of execution so\n that he could present his actual innocence claim and the\n supporting affidavits in state court. In vacating the stay,\n the Court of Appeals held that the claim was not\n cognizable on federal habeas absent, an accompanying\n federal constitutional violation.”\n\n Rejecting federal habeas petition preferred by Herrera, Chief Justice\n\nRehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court and stated: -\n\n “… … In capital cases, we have required additional\n protections because of the nature of the penalty at stake.\n See, e.g., Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 100 S.Ct. 2382,\n 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980) (jury must be given option of\n convicting the defendant of a lesser offense). All of these\n constitutional safeguards, of course, make it more difficult\n for the State to rebut and finally overturn the presumption\n of innocence which attaches to every criminal defendant.\n\n But we have also observed that “ due process does not\n require that every conceivable step be taken, at whatever\n cost, to eliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent\n person.” Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 208, 97\n S.Ct. 2319, 2326, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977). To conclude\n otherwise would all but paralyze our system for\n enforcement of the criminal law.\n\n … … …\n\n Petitioner asserts that this case is different because he has\n been sentenced to death. But we have “refused to hold that\n the fact that a death sentence has been imposed requires a\n different standard of review on federal habeas corpus.”\n Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.\nS. 1\n, \n9\n, 109 S.Ct. 2765,\n 2770, 106 L.Ed.2d 1 91989) (plurality opinion). We have,\n of course, held that the Eighth Amendment requires\n increased reliability of the process by which capital\n punishment may be imposed. See, e.g., McKoy v. North\n Carolina, 494 U.S.433, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369\n (1990) (unanimity requirement impermissibly limits\n jurors’ consideration of mitigating evidence); Eddings v.\n Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1\n\n\f 122\n\n (1982) (jury must be allowed to consider all of a capital\n defendant’s mitigating character evidence); Lockett v.\n Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2964, 57 L.Ed.2d\n 973 (1978|) (plurality opinion) (same). But petitioner’s\n claim does not fit well into the doctrine of these cases,\n since, as we have pointed out, it is far from clear that a\n second trial 10 years after the first trial would produce a\n more reliable result.\n\n Perhaps mindful of this, petitioner urges not that he\n necessarily receive a new trial, but that his death sentence\n simply be vacated if a federal habeas court deems that a\n satisfactory showing of “actual innocence” has been made.\n Tr. Of Oral Arg. 19-20. But such a result is scarcely\n logical; petitioner’s claim is not that some error was made\n in imposing a capital sentence upon him, but that a\n fundamental error was made in finding him guilty of the\n underlying murder in the first place. It would be a rather\n strange jurisprudence, in these circumstances, which held\n that under our Constitution he could not be executed, but\n that he could spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\n … … …\n\n Executive clemency has provided “fail safe” in our\n criminal justice system. K. Moore, Pardons: Justice,\n Mercy, and the Public Interest 131 (1989). It is an\n unalterable fact that our judicial system, like the human\n beings who administer it, is fallible. But history is replete\n with examples of wrongfully convicted persons who have\n been pardoned in the wake of after-discovered evidence\n establishing their innocence……”\n\n Justice O’Connor (joined by Justice Kennedy) delivered a concurring\n\nopinion. Justice Scalia (joined by Justice Thomas) also rendered a\n\nconcurring opinion. Another concurring opinion was rendered by Justice\n\nWhite, while Justice Blackmun (joined by Justice Stevens and Justice\n\nSouter) dissented.\n\n\f 123\n\nD] Oregon vs. Guzek\n\n The syllabus prepared by the Reporter of Decisions stated the facts as\n\nunder :-\n\n “At the guilt phase of respondent Guzek’s capital murder\n trial, his mother was one of two witnesses who testified\n that he had been with her on the night the crime was\n committed. He was convicted and sentenced to death.\n Twice, the Oregon Supreme Court vacated the sentence\n and ordered new sentencing proceedings, but each time\n Guzek was again sentenced to death. Upon vacating his\n sentence for a third time, the State Supreme Court held\n that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments provide\n Guzek a federal constitutional right to introduce live alibi\n testimony from his mother at the upcoming resentencing\n proceeding. After this Court granted certiorari, Guzek filed\n a motion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.”\n\n The decision of the Oregon Supreme Court was reversed by US\n\nSupreme Court. The opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice Breyer\n\nwith following observations:-\n\n “4. As our discussion in Part II, supra, makes clear, the\n federal question before us is a narrow one. Do the Eighth\n and Fourteenth Amendments grant Guzek a constitutional\n right to present evidence of the kind he seeks to introduce,\n namely, new evidence that shows he was not present at the\n scene of the crime. That evidence is inconsistent with\n Guzek's prior conviction. It sheds no light on the\n manner in which he committed the crime for which he has\n been convicted. Nor is it evidence that Guzek contends\n was unavailable to him at the time of the original trial.\n And, to the extent it is evidence he introduced at that time,\n he is free to introduce it now, albeit in transcript\n form. Ore.Rev.Stat. § 138.012(2)(b) (2003). We can find\n nothing in the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments that\n provides a capital defendant a right to introduce new\n evidence of this kind at sentencing.\n\n 546 US 517 (2006)\n\n\f 124\n\n We cannot agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that our\n previous cases have found in the Eighth Amendment a\n constitutional right broad enough to encompass the\n evidence here at issue. In Lockett v. Ohio, supra, a\n plurality of this Court decided that a defendant convicted\n of acting in concert with others to rob and to kill could\n introduce at the sentencing stage evidence that she had\n played a minor role in the crime, indeed, that she had\n remained outside the shop (where the killing took place) at\n the time of the crime. A plurality of the Court wrote that,\n\n “the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n require that the sentencer ... not be precluded\n from considering, as a mitigating factor, any\n aspect of a defendant's character or record\n and any of the circumstances of the offense\n that the defendant proffers as a basis for a\n sentence less than death.” Id., at 604, 98 S.Ct.\n 2954 (emphasis added and deleted).\n\n And in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869,\n 71 L.Ed.2d 1, the Court majority adopted this statement.\n\n See also McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 306, 107 S.Ct.\n 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987); Bell v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 637,\n 642, 98 S.Ct. 2977, 57 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1978) (plurality\n opinion).\n\n But the evidence at issue in these cases was traditional\n sentence-related evidence, evidence that tended to\n show how, not whether, the defendant committed the\n crime. Nor was the evidence directly inconsistent with the\n jury's finding of guilt.”\n\n Justice Scalia (joined by Justice Thomas) delivered a concurring\n\n opinion\n\n E] Abdul Kabir vs. Quarterman\n\n In this case, the theory of “residual doubt” did not come up for\n\n consideration. However in the judgement of the Court delivered by Justice\n\n 550 US 233 (2007)\n\n\f 125\n\nStevens, the opinion of Justice O’Connor in Franklin vs. Lynaugh89 was\n\nreferred to as under:-\n\n “What makes Franklin significant, however, is the\n separate opinion of Justice O’Connor, and particularly\n those portions of her opinion expressing the views of five\n Justices, see infra, at 1668 – 1669, and n.15. After\n summarizing the cases that clarified Jurek’s holding she\n worte:\n\n “In my view, the principle underlying\n Lockett, Eddings, and Hitchcock is that\n punishment should be directly related to the\n personal culpability of the criminal\n defendant.\n\n “Evidence about the defendant’s background and character\n is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society,\n that defendants who commit criminal acts that are\n attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to\n emotional and mental problems, may be less culpable than\n defendants who have no such excuse …. Thus, the\n sentence imposed at the penalty stage should reflect a\n reasoned moral response to the defendant’s background,\n character, and crime.’ California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538,\n 545, 107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987) (O’Connor, J.,\n concurring) (emphasis in original).\n\n “In light of this principle it is clear that a State may not\n constitutionally prevent the sentencing body from giving\n effect to the evidence relevant to the defendant’s\n background or character or the circumstances of the\n offense that mitigates against the death penalty. Indeed,\n the right to have the sentencer consider and weigh\n relevant mitigating evidence would be meaningless unless\n the sentencer was also permitted to give effect to its\n consideration.\n\n “Under the sentencing procedure followed in this case the\n jury could express its views about the appropriate\n punishment only by answering the special verdict\n questions regarding the deliberateness of the murder and\n the defendant’s future dangerousness. To the extent that\n the mitigating evidence introduced by petitioner was\n relevant to one of the special verdict questions, the jury\n was free to give effect to that evidence by returning a\n negative answer to that question. If, however, petitioner\n had introduced mitigating evidence about his background\n\n\f 126\n\n or character or the circumstances of the crime that was not\n relevant to the special verdict questions, or that had\n relevance to the defendant’s moral culpability beyond the\n scope of the special verdict questions, the jury instructions\n would have provided the jury with no vehicle for\n expressing its ‘reasoned moral response’ to that evidence.”\n 487 U.S. at 184-185, 108 S.Ct. 2320 (opinion concurring\n in Judgment) (emphasis added).”\n\n47. We may also note the decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee\n\nin State vs. Mckinney93, as it was referred to in the decision of this Court in\n\nRavishankar alias \nBaba Vishwakarma vs. State of Madhya Pradesh20\n.\n\n In that case, the Defence Counsel sought to refer to the evidence\n\nfrom the “Guilt Phase” of the trial during his closing argument in the\n\nsentencing phase of the trial. Whether the decision in not permitting him to\n\ndo so was correct, was the issue.\n\n The opinion of the Court observed: -\n\n “Residual doubt evidence,” in general, may consist of\n proof admitted during the sentencing phase that indicates\n the defendant did not commit the offense, notwithstanding\n the jury’s verdict following the guilt phase. …..”\n\n … … …\n\n “In contrast, the present case does not involve a\n resentencing procedure, nor does it involve a defendant’s\n effort to introduce evidence of residual doubt. Instead, the\n defendant only sought to argue evidence that had already\n been admitted by the trial court and heard by the same jury\n in the guilt phase of the trial. …..”\n\n … … …\n\n “…..Moreover, given that this was not a resentencing\n hearing, the reality is that the sentencing jury had already\n heard the testimony underlying defense counsel’s\n proposed argument and had reconciled it in favor of the\n State’s theory of guilt and against the defendant’s theory\n of innocence. ...”\n\n\f 127\n\n It was concluded: -\n\n “….. (4) the trail court’s refusal to allow defense counsel\n to refer to evidence from the guilt phase of the trial during\n his closing argument in the sentencing phase of the trial\n did not affect the jury’s determination to the prejudice of\n the defendant and was harmless error. …..”\n\n48. The principles that emerge from the decisions of U.S. Supreme\n\nCourt are: -\n\n (i) “….this Court has never held that a capital defendant\n has a constitutional right to an instruction telling the jury\n to revisit the question of his identity as the murderer as a\n basis for mitigation.….”\n\n Justice White speaking for the Court in Franklin vs. Lynaugh89.\n\n (ii) “….Our edict that, in a capital case, \" 'the\n sentencer . . . [may] not be precluded from considering, as\n a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character\n or record and any of the circumstances of the offense,' …..\n\n in no way mandates reconsideration by capital juries, in\n the sentencing phase, of their \"residual doubts\" over a\n defendant's guilt. ...\"\n\n Justice White speaking for the Court in Franklin vs. Lynaugh89.\n\n (iii) “…… Our cases do not support the\n proposition that a defendant who has been found to be\n guilty of a capital crime beyond a reasonable doubt has a\n constitutional right to reconsideration by the sentencing\n body of lingering doubts about his guilt…..”\n\n Justice O’Connor in concurring opinion in Franklin vs.\n Lynaugh89\n\n\f 128\n\n(iv) “… we have approved capital sentencing procedures\nthat preclude consideration by the sentencing body of\n\"residual doubts\" about guilt. …”\n\nJustice O’Connor in concurring opinion in Franklin vs.\nLynaugh89.\n\n(v) “…..Our decisions mandating jury consideration of\nmitigating circumstances provide no support for\npetitioner's claim because \"residual doubt\" about guilt is\nnot a mitigating circumstance. …..”\n\nJustice O’Connor in concurring opinion in Franklin vs.\nLynaugh89.\n\n(vi) \"… Residual doubt\" is not a fact about the defendant\nor the circumstances of the crime. It is instead a lingering\nuncertainty about facts, a state of mind that exists\nsomewhere between \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" and\n\"absolute certainty.\" Petitioner's \"residual doubt\" claim is\nthat the States must permit capital sentencing bodies to\ndemand proof of guilt to \"an absolute certainty\" before\nimposing the death sentence. Nothing in our cases\nmandates the imposition of this heightened burden of\nproof at capital sentencing. (Emphasis added)”\n\nJustice O’Connor in concurring opinion in Franklin vs.\nLynaugh89.\n\n(vii) “…In capital cases, we have required additional\nprotections because of the nature of the penalty at stake.\n….. (jury must be given option of convicting the\ndefendant of a lesser offense). All of these constitutional\nsafeguards, of course, make it more difficult for the State\nto rebut and finally overturn the presumption of innocence\nwhich attaches to every criminal defendant. But we have\nalso observed that “due process does not require that every\nconceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate\nthe possibility of convicting an innocent person.” ….. To\nconclude otherwise would all but paralyze our system for\nenforcement of the criminal law.”\n\n\f 129\n\n Chief Justice Rehnquist speaking for the Court in Herrera Vs.\n Collins94.\n\n (viii) “…..It would be a rather strange jurisprudence, in\n these circumstances, which held that under our\n Constitution he could not be executed, but that he could\n spend the rest of his life in prison. …..”\n\n Chief Justice Rehnquist speaking for the Court in Herrera Vs.\n Collins94.\n\n (ix) “….. Do the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n grant Guzek a constitutional right to present evidence of\n the kind he seeks to introduce, namely, new evidence that\n shows he was not present at the scene of the crime. That\n evidence is inconsistent with Guzek's prior conviction. It\n sheds no light on the manner in which he committed the\n crime for which he has been convicted. …..”\n\n Justice Breyer speaking for the Court in Oregon vs. Guzek99.\n\n (x) “….. But the evidence at issue in these cases was\n traditional sentence-related evidence, evidence that tended\n to show how, not whether, the defendant committed the\n crime. Nor was the evidence directly inconsistent with the\n jury's finding of guilt. …..”\n\n Justice Breyer speaking for the Court in Oregon vs. Guzek99.\n\n (xi) “The sentencer’s ability to respond with\n\n mercy towards a defendant has always struck me as a\n\n particularly valuable aspect of the capital sentencing\n\n procedure. …….”\n\n The observations in the dissenting opinion of Justice Blackmun in\n California vs. Brown90.\n\n49. Following features from these decisions of U.S. Supreme Court are\n\nnoteworthy: -\n\n\f 130\n\n(A) As the decision in California vs. Brown90 discloses, the jury trial\n\ncomprises of two phases. The first is called “Guilt Phase” where the\n\nquestion for determination is whether the offence as alleged has been\n\nproved by the prosecution which is akin to “conviction stage” in our\n\njurisprudence; while the second phase is called “Penalty Phase” at which\n\nstage the question for consideration is about the appropriate penalty to be\n\nawarded when the guilt is established which is similar to “sentence stage”\n\nin our jurisprudence.\n\n In both the phases, the basic issues are to be dealt with by jurors who\n\nare drawn from cross sections of the society, while the function for such\n\ndetermination and consideration in our jurisprudence is entrusted to\n\njudicial officers adequately trained and appropriately equipped with\n\npractical experience. A jury is likely to be swayed by emotions or\n\nsentiments, which is why the caution was given to the jury by the trial\n\ncourt in California vs. Brown90. But that element or possibility gets ruled\n\nout when an experienced judicial officer is entrusted with the requisite\n\ntask.\n\n(B) Secondly, there can be fresh sentencing procedure on as many as\n\nfour occasions as the decision in Oregon vs. Guzek99 shows or the\n\nprocess of challenge may take considerable time as the decision in\n\nHerrera vs. Collins94 discloses. Naturally, there would be some time gap\n\n\f 131\n\nbetween two phases, possibly leading to a situation where the composition\n\nof the jury at the “Penalty Phase” may not be same as it was at the “Guilt\n\nPhase”. Consequently, the attempts on part of the defence to highlight\n\nany area or aspect in the evidence which could be said to be doubtful in\n\nthe hope that there could be a change in perception. This possibility again\n\ndoes not arise in our jurisprudence, as the same judicial officer who heard\n\nand decided the matter at the conviction stage is to decide the matter at the\n\nsentence stage and without any undue lapse of time.\n\n(C) At the “Penalty Phase”, the Prosecutor and the Defence are\n\nallowed to lead evidence. Whether such leading of evidence may also\n\ninclude evidence touching upon the identity of the Accused or his role in\n\nthe transaction or any matter concerning evidence leading to\n\ndetermination of his guilt were the issues in Oregon vs. Guzek99 and the\n\nportion extracted from that decision shows the approach adopted by US\n\nSupreme Court. In our jurisprudence, if there be any new evidence which\n\nmay go to the root of the matter, leading of such evidence can be\n\npermitted at the appellate stage subject to fulfilment of governing\n\nprinciples.\n\n These features are only illustrative to say that the theory of\n\n“residual doubt” that got developed was a result of peculiarity in the\n\nprocess adopted. Even then, what is material to note is that the theory has\n\nconsistently been rejected by U.S. Supreme Court and as stated by Justice\n\n\f 132\n\nO’Connor: - “Nothing in our cases mandated the imposition of this\n\nheightened burden of proof at capital sentencing”.\n\n50. (A) In Ashok Debbarma18, after noticing the decisions of US\n\nSupreme Court in California vs. Brown90 and in Franklin vs. Lynaugh89,\n\nit was observed that “residual doubt” as a mitigating circumstance did not\n\nfind favour with various Courts in the United States.\n\n On facts, it was however observed that the Court entertained\n\n“lingering doubt” as to “whether the appellant alone could have executed\n\nthe crime single-handedly, especially when the prosecution itself says that\n\nit was handiwork of a large group of people”. Thus, the doubt that was\n\nentertained was not about the guilt of the accused simpliciter or about his\n\ninvolvement in the crime but whether the appellant alone could have\n\ncommitted the crime which resulted in the death of as many as 35 persons\n\nand such doubt weighed with the Court while commuting death sentence to\n\nimprisonment for life.\n\n It must be stated here that what was paraphrased in paragraph 33 of\n\nthe decision was the relevant portion from the opinion of Justice O’Connor\n\nin Franklin v. Lynaugh89 and not from the decision in California v.\n\nBrown90.\n\n\f 133\n\n \n(B) In Sudam alias \nRahul Kaniram Jadhav v. State of\n\nMaharashtra19\n, it was noted in paragraph 19.1 that there would be no bar\n\non the award of death sentence in cases based on circumstantial evidence.\n\nThereafter, the decision in Ashok Debbarma18 was considered and the\n\nCourt observed that in several cases, “quality of evidence to a higher\n\nstandard” was insisted upon for passing the irrevocable sentence of death\n\nand reliance was placed on the decision in \nMohd. Mannan vs. State of\n\nBihar80\n. The deduction in paragraph 21 rested inter alia on the aspect that\n\n“the nature of the circumstantial evidence in this case amounts to a\n\ncircumstance significant enough to tilt the balance of aggravating and\n\nmitigating circumstances in the petitioner’s favour”.\n\n \n(C) In Ravishankar20 it was observed that “imposition of a\n\nhigher standard of proof for the purposes of death sentencing over and\n\nabove beyond reasonable doubt necessary for criminal conviction is\n\nsimilar to the residual doubt metric adopted by this Court in \nAshok\n\nDebbarma vs. State of Tripura18…”\n. In this case, as per paragraph 10 of\n\nthe decision, blood samples of six suspects were sent for DNA analysis\n\nbut only DNA profile from the blood of the appellant matched with that\n\nfrom the vaginal slide of the deceased. Additionally, reliance was placed\n\nby the prosecution on the testimony of PWs 5, 6 and 7, as set out in\n\nparagraphs 17 and 18. The reason why the version coming from PWs 5, 6\n\n\f 134\n\nand 7 could not inspire complete confidence was dealt with in paragraph\n\n61. It was further observed that another suspect Baba alias Ashok Kaurav\n\nhaving absconded during investigation, there was possibility of\n\ninvolvement of more than one person, giving rise to the same safety filter\n\nadopted in Ashok Debbarma18.\n\n51. These cases thus show that the matters were considered from the\n\nstandpoint of individual fact situation where, going by the higher or\n\nstricter standard for imposition of death penalty, alternative to death\n\nsentence was found to be appropriate.\n\n52. When it comes to cases based on circumstantial evidence in our\n\njurisprudence, the standard that is adopted in terms of law \nlaid down by\n\nthis Court as noticed in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda34 and subsequent\n\ndecisions is that the circumstances must not only be individually proved\n\nor established, but they must form a consistent chain, so conclusive as to\n\nrule out the possibility of any other hypothesis except the guilt of the\n\naccused. On the strength of these principles, the burden in such cases is\n\nalready of a greater magnitude. Once that burden is discharged, it is\n\nimplicit that any other hypothesis or the innocence of the accused, already\n\nstands ruled out when the matter is taken up at the stage of sentence after\n\nreturning the finding of guilt. So, theoretically the concept or theory of\n\n\f 135\n\n“residual doubt” does not have any place in a case based on\n\ncircumstantial evidence. As a matter of fact, the theory of residual doubt\n\nwas never accepted by US Supreme Court as discussed earlier.\n\n However, as summed up in Kalu Khan17, while dealing with cases\n\nbased on circumstantial evidence, for imposition of a death sentence,\n\nhigher or stricter standard must be insisted upon. The approach to be\n\nadopted in matters concerning capital punishment, therefore ought to be in\n\nconformity with the principles culled out in paragraph 41 hereinabove and\n\nthe instant matter must therefore be considered in the light of those\n\nprinciples.\n\n53. If the present case is so considered, the discussion must broadly be\n\nclassified under following two heads: -\n\n(A) Whether the circumstantial evidence in the present case is of\n\nunimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the Appellant or leads\n\nto an exceptional case.\n\n(B) Whether the evidence on record is so strong and convincing that\n\nthe option of a sentence lesser than a death penalty is foreclosed.\n\n Going by the circumstances proved on record and, more\n\nparticularly the facets detailed in paragraph 19 hereinabove as well as the\n\nlaw \nlaid down by\n this Court in series of decisions, the circumstances on\n\n\f 136\n\nrecord rule out any hypothesis of innocence of the Appellant. The\n\ncircumstances are clear, consistent and conclusive in nature and are of\n\nunimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the Appellant. The\n\nevidence on record also depicts an exceptional case where two and half\n\nyears old girl was subjected to sexual assault. The assault was\n\naccompanied by bites on the body of the victim. The rape was of such\n\nintensity that there was merging of vaginal and anal orifices of the victim.\n\nThe age of the victim, the fact that the Appellant was a maternal uncle of\n\nthe victim and the intensity of the assault make the present case an\n\nexceptional one.\n\n However, if the case is considered against the second head, we do\n\nnot find that the option of a sentence lesser than death penalty is\n\ncompletely foreclosed. It is true that the sexual assault was very severe and\n\nthe conduct of the Appellant could be termed as perverse and barbaric.\n\nHowever, a definite pointer in favour of the Appellant is the fact that he did\n\nnot consciously cause any injury with the intent to extinguish the life of the\n\nvictim. Though all the injuries are attributable to him and it was injury\n\nNo.17 which was the cause of death, his conviction under \nSection 302\n IPC\n\nis not under any of the first three clauses of \nSection 300\n IPC. In matters\n\nwhere the conviction is recorded with the aid of clause fourthly under\n\nSection 300\n of IPC, it is very rare that the death sentence is awarded. In\n\n\f 137\n\ncases at Serial Nos. 10, 11, 16, 24, 40, 45 and 64 of the Chart tabulated in\n\nparagraph 30 hereinabove, where the victims were below 16 years of age\n\nand had died during the course of sexual assault on them, the maximum\n\nsentence awarded was life sentence. This aspect is of crucial importance\n\nwhile considering whether the option of a sentence lesser than death\n\npenalty is foreclosed or not.\n\n54. We therefore, find that though the Appellant is guilty of the offence\n\npunishable under \nSection 302\n IPC, since there was no requisite intent as\n\nwould bring the case under any of the first three clauses of \nSection 300\n\nIPC, the offence in the present case does not deserve death penalty.\n\n55. The second count on which death sentence has been imposed is\n\nunder \nSection 376A\n of IPC. As noted earlier, the offence was committed\n\non 11.02.2013 and just few days before such commission, Section 376A\n\nwas inserted in \nIPC\n by the Ordinance. As concluded by us in paragraph 16\n\nhereinabove, the ex-post facto effect given to Section 376A inserted by the\n\nAmendment Act would not in any way be inconsistent with sub-Article (1)\n\nof \nArticle 20\n of the Constitution. The Appellant is thus definitely guilty of\n\nthe offence punishable under \nSection 376A\n IPC. But the question remains\n\nwhether punishment lesser than death sentence gets ruled out or not. As\n\nagainst \nSection 302\n IPC while dealing with cases under \nSection 376A\n IPC,\n\na wider spectrum is available for consideration by the Courts as to the\n\n\f 138\n\npunishment to be awarded. On the basis of the same aspects that weighed\n\nwith us while considering the appropriate punishment for the offence under\n\nSection 302\n IPC, in view of the fact that \nSection 376A\n IPC was brought on\n\nthe statute book just few days before the commission of the offence, the\n\nAppellant does not deserve death penalty for said offence.\n\n At the same time, considering the nature and enormity of the\n\noffence, it must be observed that the appropriate punishment for the\n\noffence under \nSection 376A\n IPC must be rigorous imprisonment for a term\n\nof 25 years.\n\n56. In view of the aforestated conclusions drawn by us, it is not\n\nnecessary to deal with the submissions IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX,\n\nadvanced by Ms. Mathur, learned Senior Advocate in respect of the issue\n\nof sentence.\n\n57. Consequently, while affirming the view taken by the Courts below\n\nin recording conviction of the Appellant for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 302\n IPC and 376A \nIPC\n, we commute the sentence to life\n\nimprisonment for the offence punishable under \nSection 302\n IPC and to that\n\nof rigorous imprisonment for 25 years for the offence punishable under\n\nSection 376A\n IPC. The conviction and sentence recorded by the Courts\n\nbelow for the offences punishable under Section 376(1), (2)(f), (i) and (m)\n\nof \nIPC\n, and under \nSection 6\n of the POCSO Act are affirmed.\n\n\f 139\n\n58. These appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent.\n\n ……………………J.\n (Uday Umesh Lalit)\n\n ……………………J.\n (Indu Malhotra)\n\n …………………….J.\n (Krishna Murari)\nNew Delhi;\n\nNovember 02, 2020.",

On\n it, he told me, “Shatrughna Baban Meshram, aged 21\n years, resident of Zatala has taken away your daughter\n XXX4 from me saying that he would reach her to you”.\n But Shatrughna did not bring my daughter to me. So I\n searched my daughter in the village. I saw my daughter\n XXX4 and Shatrughna Meshram lying in the new, under\n construction, building of Anganwadi. There was no pant\n on the person of my daughter. It was lying beside. Her\n face was bitten and private parts were swollen. I came out\n with my daughter. In the meantime, Baban Sambhaji\n Meshram, aged 50 years also came there. He took\n Shatrughna to his house. I along with father-in-law and\n Vitthal Ghodam took my daughter in an auto from the\n village to Dr. Jaffar Siddiqui from Kurli. The doctor\n examined her and declared her dead.

The\nSessions Judge chose the lowest end of the spectrum\nwhich is surprising enough, because the burns were so\nextensive that they were certainly grievous by all account.\nThe High Court placed the offence a little higher, namely,\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. We think that\nthe matter goes a little further than this. As death has been\ncaused the question has to be considered in the light of\nhomicide to determine whether the action of Ram Prasad\nfalls within culpable homicide not amounting to murder or\nthe higher offence of murder itself. Here we see that death\nhas actually been caused by the criminal act; in other\nwords, there has been homicide and since it is not\naccidental or suicidal death, responsibility for the\nhomicide, in the absence of any exceptions or extenuating\ncircumstances, must be borne by the person who caused it.\nThe High Court has apparently stopped short by holding\nthat this was a case of culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder. The question is whether the offence falls in any of\nthe clauses of\n s. 300\n Indian Penal Code. In this\nconnection it is difficult to say that Ram Prasad intended\ncausing the death of Mst. Rajji although it might well be\nthe truth. That he set fire to her clothes after pouring\nkerosene oil is a patent fact and therefore the matter has to\nbe viewed not only with regard to the firstly of s. 300, but\nall the other clauses also. We do not wish to consider the\nsecond and the third clauses, because the question then\nwould arise what was the extent of the injury which Ram\nPrasad intended to cause or knew would be caused to Mst.\nRajji. That would be a matter of speculation. In our\nopinion, this matter can be disposed of with reference to\nclause fourthly of s. 300. That clause reads as follows :-"

Therefore, it is obvious that Ram\n Prasad must have known that he was running the risk of\n causing the death of Rajji or such bodily injury as was\n likely to cause her death. As he had no excuse for\n incurring that risk, the offence must be taken to fall within\n 4thly of\n s. 300\n, Indian Penal Code. \nIn other words, his\n offence was culpable homicide amounting to murder even\n if he did not intend causing the death of Mst. Rajji. He\n committed an act so imminently dangerous that it was in\n all probability likely to cause death or to result in an injury\n that was likely to cause death. We are accordingly of the\n opinion that the High Court and the Sessions Judge were\n both wrong in holding that the offence did not fall within\n murder.”\n (Emphasis supplied)"

We cannot accede to this line of argument.\n The first question which the court has to consider in a case\n like this, is whether the accused has been proved, to the\n satisfaction of the court, to have committed the crime. If\n the court is convinced about the truth of the prosecution\n story, conviction has to follow. The question of sentence\n has to be determined, not with reference to the volume or\n character of the evidence adduced by the prosecution in\n support of the prosecution case, but with reference to the\n fact whether there are any extenuating circumstances\n which can be said to mitigate the enormity of the crime. If\n the court is satisfied that there are such mitigating\n circumstances, only then, it would be justified in imposing\n the lesser of the two sentences provided by law. In other\n words, the nature of the proof has nothing to with the\n character of the punishment. The nature of the proof can\n only bear upon the question of conviction - whether or not\n the accused has been proved to be guilty.

If the\n circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable\n character in establishing the guilt of the accused, that\n forms the foundation for conviction. That has nothing to\n do with the question of sentence as has been observed by\n this Court in various cases while awarding death sentence.\n The mitigating circumstances and the aggravating\n circumstances have to be balanced. In the balance sheet of\n such circumstances, the fact that the case rests on\n circumstantial evidence has no role to play. In fact in most\n of the cases where death sentence is awarded for rape and\n murder and the like, there is practically no scope for\n having an eyewitness. They are not committed in the\n public view. By the very nature of things in such cases, the\n available evidence is circumstantial evidence. If the said\n evidence has been found to be credible, cogent and\n trustworthy for the purpose of recording conviction, to\n treat that evidence as a mitigating circumstance, would\n amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. The plea\n of learned counsel for the appellant that the conviction is\n based on circumstantial evidence and, therefore, the death\n sentence should not be awarded is clearly unsustainable.”\n (Emphasis supplied)"
