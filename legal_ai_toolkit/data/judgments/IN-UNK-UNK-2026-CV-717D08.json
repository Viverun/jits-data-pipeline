The accused-appellant in this appeal, through Jail, has been\n\nconvicted and sentenced as below vide judgment of conviction and\n\norder of sentence dated 19.01.2023 (in Sessions Case No.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (2 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n128/2018 - CIS Reg. No. 128/2018 - State of Rajasthan v. Rupa),\n\npassed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Banswara.\n\n Offence Sentence\n \nSection 302\n, Indian Penal Code Death Sentence\n\n 1860\n\n1.1. As indicated above, the accused-appellant had been convicted\n\nunder the aforementioned provision, and while doing so, the\n\nlearned Trial Court, being the Court of Sessions, had passed the\n\ndeath sentence against the accused-appellant vide the impugned\n\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence. Therefore, in\n\naccordance with \nSection 366\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\n1973, the matter has been submitted before this Hon'ble High\n\nCourt for confirmation of such sentence, by way of Murder\n\nReference No. 01/2023.\n\n1.2. We also have noticed that on behalf of the accused-appellant,\n\nan appeal being the above-numbered D.B. Criminal Appeal (Db)\n\nNo. 77/2023 has been preferred against the impugned judgment\n\nof conviction and order of sentence. Accordingly, both the murder\n\nreference and the criminal appeal are being decided together by\n\nthis common judgment.\n\n2. Brief facts of the case are that the prosecution was set in\n\nmotion by a written report (Ex.P. 1) dated 15.06.2018 submitted\n\nby the one Heera (PW-1) in Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, Banswara\n\nto the then present Head Constable Omprakash No. 567, Police\n\nThana, Danpur, district Banswara. It stated that, on 15.06.2018 at\n\naround 02:00 am when he was sleeping outside his house,\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (3 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nReshma (daughter of the accused-appellant) came running and\n\nscreamed that her father Rupa, is assaulting her mother (Iteri)\n\nand her brother (Dilip). Upon hearing the same, he ran towards\n\nthe place of incident and in the light of torch, saw Rupa hitting his\n\nwife and son on their heads with lathi, with an intention to cause\n\ntheir death. After seeing PW-1 at the place of incident, the\n\naccused-appellant fled away from the spot. Thereafter, Heera (PW-\n\n1) called Bada, Prabhu Lal, Tulsi Ram on the spot of offence in\n\nquestion, wherein they saw Ittari and Dilip lying on the ground\n\nand they were having head injuries and blood was flowing out of\n\ntheir heads. Ittari died on her way to the hospital and Dilip was\n\nadmitted to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, Banswara for treatment.\n\n3. On the basis of the aforementioned report, the police registered\n\na First Information Report bearing No. 92/2018 against the\n\npresent accused-appellant for the offences under \nSections 307\n and\n\n302\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the investigation\n\ncommenced accordingly.\n\n3.1. During the course of the investigation, the police arrested the\n\naccused-appellant on 17.06.2018. Later on, after the death of\n\nDilip during the course of his treatment, and after completion of\n\nthe investigation, a charge-sheet under \nSection 302\n, IPC was filed\n\nby the concerned investigating authority. The accused-appellant\n\nwas furnished the copy of the charge-sheet as required under\n\nSection 207\n CrPC and accordingly, the Sessions Case bearing No.\n\n128/2018 was registered against the accused-appellant.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (4 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n4. Thereafter, the charges were read over to the accused-\n\nappellant, and since he denied the same and claimed trial, the trial\n\nof the case commenced accordingly before the learned Trial Court.\n\n5. During the course of Trial, on behalf of prosecution, 19\n\nwitnesses were produced for examination, 37 documents were\n\nexhibited and 2 articles were produced.\n\n6. After recording of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses,\n\nduring trial, the statement of the accused-appellant was recorded\n\nunder \nSection 313\n CrPC, during course whereof, he stood by the\n\ndenial of the charges and the contents of the statements of the\n\nprosecution witnesses in toto, however, he did not adduce any\n\nevidence in defence. Thus, since the accused-appellant pleaded\n\n'not guilty' and claimed to be innocent while challenging the\n\nveracity of the prosecution's case and alleging its evidence to be\n\nunworthy of credit, he was made to stand the trial, and the trial\n\nproceeded accordingly.\n\n7. The learned Trial Court, to reiterate, after due scrutiny of the\n\nevidence available on record and after duly analyzing the rival\n\ncontentions, passed the impugned judgment of conviction and\n\norder of sentence, as above. Thereafter, upon his failure to secure\n\nacquittal order before the learned Trial Court, the accused-\n\nappellant challenged the said judgment convicting and sentencing\n\nhim. At this stage, it is noted that the prosecution story was\n\ndeveloped on the strength of testimonies of the eye witnesses\n\ngiven by PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5, PW-6, PW-8 and it was\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (5 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nsupported by the recovery of weapon of the offence and clothes of\n\nthe deceased at the instance of the accused.\n\n8. We have heard Mr. Vineet Jain, learned Senior Counsel assisted\n\nby Mr. Kuldeep Sharma, Pro-Bono Counsel and Mr. Vijay Kumar\n\nappearing on behalf of petitioner and Mr. Deepak Choudhary,\n\nlearned GA-cum-AAG appearing on behalf of the State, as well as\n\nperused the record of the case.\n\n9. Before adverting to the evidence adduced, it would be\n\nexpedient to notice the defence plea for a purposeful appreciation\n\nthereof.\n\n10. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner (accused) has\n\ndrawn attention of this Court to the fact that in the instant case,\n\nthe accused Rupa stands accused of causing death of his own wife\n\nand son, however, the prosecution is absolutely silent on the\n\nmotive for the said incident. Not a whisper has been alleged as to\n\nwhy the accused, who otherwise was having admittedly no quarrel\n\nor matrimonial or domestic disturbance, would take the extreme\n\nstep of murdering his wife and son.\n\n10.1. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the\n\nprosecution may argue that in cases of eye-witnesses, motive is\n\nnot of much relevance, however, when the nature of offence as\n\nalleged, is the case of uxoricide (murder of wife) and filicide\n\n(murder of son), the reason behind the said act cannot be brushed\n\naway lightly, because it is against the human nature when a\n\nperson takes resort to murder his own kith and kin, particularly\n\nwhen there is absolutely no allegation, whisper or evidence that\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (6 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nthere was any reason for him to take this extreme step. Under\n\nsuch circumstances, when the prosecution is absolutely silent on\n\nthe motive, it becomes essential that the evidence of the\n\neyewitnesses is scrutinized with greater circumspection and is\n\ncorroborated material particulars before it is relied upon.\n\n10.2. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that the prosecution\n\nin this case has examined as many as 5 eyewitnesses i.e. PW-1 to\n\nPW-5, however, in the FIR which has been lodged by Heera (PW-\n\n1), he only mentions the name of one Reshma, on whose cries, he\n\nrushed to the place of occurrence. As far as the other witnesses\n\nare concerned, namely Jeeva (PW-3) and Bedi (PW-4), their\n\nnames do not find mention in the FIR as the persons, who reached\n\non the spot and saw the alleged actual assault being committed by\n\nthe accused.\n\n10.3. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that as far as the\n\nPW-2 (Beda) is concerned, the FIR narrates that after the accused\n\nran away, Heera called out and summoned Beda along with\n\nPrabhulal and Tulsi Ram, upon which, they came on the spot,\n\nwhich makes it apparent that Beda too did not witness the assault\n\nand reached the place of occurrence subsequently along with Tulsi\n\nRam (PW-6) and Prabhulal (PW-8). Both these witnesses PW-6\n\nand PW-8 in their evidence categorically mention that they\n\nreached the place of occurrence after the accused had run away,\n\nwhich makes it apparent that Beda himself is not an eyewitness.\n\nThis leaves the prosecution with the two so-called eyewitnesses as\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (7 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nfar as the act of the accused is concerned i.e. PW-1 Heera and\n\nPW-5 Reshma, the daughter of the deceased and the accused.\n\n10.4. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that the statement of\n\nHeera (PW-1) upon examination would reveal that he claims in his\n\nchief that he along with his daughter-in-law Jeeva, Beda and Bedi,\n\nall four reached the house of the accused on hearing the screams\n\nof Reshma and saw the accused hitting both the deceased. He\n\nfurther claims that he saw the accused in the light of torch which\n\nhe carried and on seeing them, the accused ran away. The\n\nevidence of this witness clearly reveals that in his examination-in-\n\nchief, he has made a material improvement which are contrary to\n\nhis own FIR, wherein he has made three other persons as\n\neyewitnesses and the same is admittedly an embellished and\n\nimproved version, as it is absolutely missing from the FIR of\n\nwhich, the said witness is the author.\n\n10.4.1. Learned Counsel in continuation submitted that Heera\n\n(PW-1) claims to have seen the accused assaulting the deceased\n\nin the light of the torch. The same is also rendered suspicious,\n\nbecause as per the FIR (Ex.P.-1), PW-1 alleges that Reshma (PW-\n\n5) screamed out of fear and said that her father Rupa was\n\nassaulting her mother and brother. If the aforementioned version\n\nset out in the FIR itself is correct, then the identity of the accused\n\nwas nowhere in doubt and there was no need for this witness to\n\ngo and confirm the same by using a torch to see by throwing light\n\non the person assaulted. Again, at the cost of repetition, learned\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (8 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nsenior counsel submitted that there is absolutely no motive for the\n\nalleged act of the accused.\n\n10.4.2. Learned Counsel further submitted that admittedly, during\n\nthe investigation, the investigating officer has not seized the said\n\ntorch, which was used by this witness. However, according to the\n\nversion of the witness, the incident allegedly took place at 02.00\n\nA.M. in the midnight and use of battery makes it apparent that the\n\nplace of occurrence did not have any source of light to identify the\n\nperson carrying out the said act. Therefore, the counsel submitted\n\nthat in light of the circumstances above and in the absence of\n\nrecovery of the concerned weapon of offence, the veracity of the\n\ntestimony of the eye-witnesses does not remain untainted.\n\n10.5. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that this witness has\n\nfurther in his cross-examination specifically stated that when he\n\nreached the place of occurrence, he saw both the deceased lying\n\non the floor and the accused ran away on seeing them implying\n\nthat the initial version as well as the version in the examination-\n\nin-chief that this witness saw the accused causing injuries to the\n\ndeceased is suspicious because as per his own admission when he\n\nreached the place of occurrence, the accused ran away, which also\n\nmakes it plausible that this witness never saw the alleged act of\n\nassault, as he claims in his examination-in- chief.\n\n10.6. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that as far as\n\nevidence of PW-5 (Reshma) is concerned, it suffices to state that\n\nshe is a child witness, and the evidence of a child witness must be\n\ncarefully examined and materially corroborated by other\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (9 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\ncircumstances before it can be relied upon. A bare perusal of PW-\n\n5's statement reveals that she cannot be considered a witness of\n\nsterling quality. Her evidence is wavering in nature, as she first\n\nclaims that she is not a witness to any incident, but subsequently\n\nstates that she saw the accused assaulting her mother and\n\nbrother with a lathi.\n\n10.6.1. Learned counsel further submitted that, PW-5 (Reshma)\n\ntestified that upon raising alarm, Heera along with Tulsi, Badiya,\n\nBedi, and Jeevni rushed to her house, whereupon the accused\n\nfled. However, this version is entirely at variance with the\n\ntestimony given by PW-1 Heera and other prosecution witnesses.\n\nIn cross-examination, PW-5 claims that she went to sleep between\n\n8:00 and 9:00 PM and only woke up in the morning, thereby\n\ncasting serious doubt on the prosecution's version that it was she\n\nwho raised an alarm and summoned PW-1 to the place of\n\noccurrence. Under these circumstances, it cannot be concluded\n\nthat PW-1 and PW-5 are witnesses of sterling worth, nor can their\n\ntestimony be deemed creditworthy enough to base a conviction\n\nupon.\n\n10.6.2. Learned counsel also submitted that this witness has been\n\nexamined more than one year after the alleged occurrence and\n\nclaims that she is presently also studying in the school, however,\n\nthere is no material available on record to show as to who is\n\ntaking care of the said witness. The possibility that the said\n\nwitness has been tutored, cannot be ruled out, because admittedly\n\nafter the accused has been sent to custody, all the agricultural\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (10 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nland in possession of the accused became open for being\n\npossessed and cultivated by others and they would definitely take\n\nadvantage of the current situation and tender age of this child\n\nwitness to ensure that they continue to enjoy the agricultural land\n\nof the accused.\n\n10.7. Learned counsel further submitted that as far as other\n\neyewitnesses are concerned, admittedly their names were not\n\nmentioned in the FIR, as the persons who went along with Heera\n\nto see the accused causing the injuries. Further, PW-2 (Beda)\n\nclaims that he saw the accused running away from a distance of\n\n100 meters, he claims that he saw Heera standing near the\n\nbodies; PW-3 (Jeeva) claims that she reached the place of\n\noccurrence after Heera and this witness has categorically admitted\n\nthat the deceased Iteri and the accused Rupa had a cordial marital\n\nlife, however, all these witnesses in one breath claim that the\n\naccused was quarrelsome with the other neighbors and used to\n\nquarrel with them on regular basis.\n\n10.7.1. Learned counsel also submitted that similarly, PW-4 Bedi\n\nalso claims that when she reached the place of occurrence, the\n\ndeceased were lying down on the floor and Jeeva and Heera were\n\nstanding there, which makes all the witnesses, who are not\n\nmentioned in the FIR, at a variance with the version set out by the\n\nPW-1 and the same discredits witnesses, which is also apparent\n\nfrom the fact that they are all relatives of PW-1 Heera.\n\n10.8. Learned counsel further submitted that, with regard to the\n\nmedical evidence, the prosecution in this case has examined PW-\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (11 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n14 Dr. Ravi Upadhyay and presented Ex.P.-29 (Post-mortem\n\nReport of Smt. Iteri) and Ex.P.-31 (Post-mortem Report of Dilip).\n\nAs per the evidence of the said witness, both the deceased had\n\nonly one fatal injury on head, both lacerated wounds, which were\n\nsubsequently found to be the cause of death. This witness in his\n\ncross- examination has admitted that the injury which is referred\n\nto could be a result of fall as well.\n\n10.9. Learned counsel also submitted that with regard to the\n\nevidence of recovery, the prosecution has relied upon the\n\ncircumstance of recovery of weapon of offence i.e., the lathi as\n\nwell as apparel of accused i.e., dhoti with an assertion that these\n\narticles were having bloodstains which on analysis were found to\n\nbe of B-group, which was also the group found at the place of\n\noccurrence. Counsel also stated that it is suffice to say that the\n\naccused in this case was arrested on 17.06.2018 at about 02.37\n\nP.M., by Ex.P.-26 and the recovery of lathi was made at 06.00 P.M.\n\non the same day from an open place at some distance from the\n\nhouse of the accused.\n\n10.9.1. Learned counsel further submitted that similarly, the dhoti\n\nwas found and seized at 02:45 Ρ.Μ. subsequent to his arrest. It is\n\nhumbly submitted that recovery of the lathi is absolutely\n\nsuspicious in view of the fact that it is made after a lapse of two\n\ndays, that too from an open place, for which, there is no\n\nexplanation as to why the accused would allegedly throw the lathi\n\nat a place nearby his own house when he had already escaped\n\nfrom the place.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (12 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n10.9.2. The recovery has been witnesses by two motbirs PW-11\n\nand PW-12. PW-11 (Shankar) in his evidence claims that recovery\n\nwas effected at about 10-11 A.M., three days after the incident,\n\nwhich makes it apparent that the recovery is nothing but a planted\n\nrecovery because it has been affected on 17.06.2018 and three\n\ndays had not elapsed, further as per the recovery memo (Ex.P.-\n\n22), the recovery was effected on 17.06.2018 at 06.00 P.M.\n\nwhereas according to this witness, the recovery had already taken\n\nplace between 10:00-11:00 A.M. This witness has further\n\ndestroyed the case of the prosecution when he in his cross-\n\nexamination admits that he was made to sign the memos at the\n\npolice station and the articles were also sealed at the police\n\nstation.\n\n10.9.2. Learned counsel also submitted that, similarly, PW-12\n\nBahadur has stated in his evidence that the recovery was made at\n\nabout 4:00 or 5:00 P.M. and he asserts that they signed the\n\nmemos at the place of recovery and not at police station. The\n\nwitness has absolutely contradicted PW-11 and therefore, both of\n\nthe witnesses lose their credibility when it comes to the\n\ncircumstance of recovery.\n\n10.10. Learned counsel further submitted that the prosecution has\n\nconnected the said recovery with the offence on the strength of\n\nFSL report Ex.P.-36 as per which, the dhoti and the Lathi\n\nrecovered at the instance of the accused were found to be\n\ncarrying stains of B-blood group. Learned counsel submitted that\n\nwhen viewed in light of the motbir witnesses, the recovery as well\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (13 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nas sealing of the articles becomes highly suspicious and the\n\npossibility of tempering cannot be ruled out. This also gains\n\nimportance in view of the statements of PW-15 (Mahendra Pal),\n\nConstable, who allegedly carried the articles for comparison and\n\ndeposited it with the FSL. This witness claims that he was handed\n\nover the articles from malkhana at about 11.00 A.M. on\n\n27.06.2018 and he again deposited the same in the Malkhana in\n\nthe evening of 27.06.2018, because the requisite paper work in\n\nthe office consumed the whole day and therefore, he took the\n\nsame again in the morning of 28.06.2018 and deposited it for FSL.\n\n10.10.1. Learned counsel submitted that when the\n\naforementioned evidence is viewed with the malkhana register\n\nproduced by the prosecution (Ex.P.-27-A), would reveal that the\n\narticles were submitted on 27.06.2018 and the receipt was\n\nhanded over to PW-15 (Mahendrapal), which was presented on\n\n28.06.2018. The receipt Ex.P.-34 does not bear the seal of the\n\nFSL, which fact has also been admitted by PW-15.\n\n10.10.2. Learned counsel further submitted that, the prosecution\n\nin this case has not examined the malkhana in-charge and the\n\nevidence of PW-15 (Mahendrapal) regarding re-deposition of\n\narticles on 27.06.2018 and re-handing over on 28.06.2018 is\n\nabsolutely contradicted by Ex.P.-27-A, which bears no such\n\nentries. Therefore, it cannot be said that the prosecution has\n\nproved that it was the accused, who has committed the said\n\nmurders beyond all shadow of doubt so as to warrant his\n\nconviction.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (14 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n10.11. In support of the aforementioned submissions, the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent (accused) has relied upon the\n\njudgments rendered in the following cases:\n\n 1. Shahabudeen and ors. v. State of Rajasthan (D.B. Appeal\n\n No. 966/16, Para 66)\n\n 2. Trappa Siddappa Murgannavar v. State of Karnataka (Cri.\n\n Appeal 1473-74/2017, Para 23)\n\n 3. Pappu v. State of Uttar Pradesh (Cri. Appeal No. 1097-\n\n 98/2018, Para 42).\n\n11. Mr. Deepak Choudhary, learned GA cum AAG has opposed\n\nthe aforesaid submissions made on behalf of the accused-\n\nappellant.\n\n12. We have gone through the impugned judgment and order of\n\nthe learned Trial Court and analysed all the evidence brought on\n\nrecord through the depositions by the witnesses as well as the FSL\n\nreport which are on record along with other exhibits, and the case\n\nlaws cited at the Bar.\n\n13. At this stage, this Court deems it appropriate to deal with the\n\nevidence of the prosecution witnesses to the extent necessary for\n\nthe present adjudication.\n\n14. This Court observes that Heera (PW1) has very clearly in this\n\nexamination-in-chief as testified that upon hearing the cries of his\n\nbrother's daughter (Reshma) he along with his daughter-in-law\n\nJeeva, Bada and his wife Badi ran towards the place of incident,\n\nwhereupon in the light of torch they saw Rupa causing injuries to\n\nhis wife (Iteri) and son (Dilip) on their heads with lathi and upon\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (15 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nseeing them all, Rupa ran away from the spot, whereafter Iteri\n\ndied on the spot and Dilip died after 2 days while undergoing the\n\ntreatment. This witness only got the complaint (Ex.P. 1)\n\nregistered, testified the veracity of Naksha Mauka (Ex.P. 2) and\n\nalso witnessed the seizure of the blood-stained clothes of both the\n\nvictims and the attested the seizure memo of blouse and petticoat\n\n(Ex.P. 5) and seizure memo of pant and shirt (Ex.P. 8). He also\n\nattested the Ex.P. 6 i.e., the seizure memo and soil sample.\n\nFurthermore, no inconsistencies have been found in the\n\naforementioned during his cross-examination so as to vitiate the\n\ntestimony given during examination-in-chief.\n\n15. This Court further observes that the testimony of PW1 is\n\nfurther corroborated by the testimony of PW 2 (Bada), who was\n\nsaid to have accompanied PW1 to the place of incident when the\n\naccused was committing the crime in question. PW 2 has testified\n\nin his examination-in-chief that he along with his wife (Badi) and\n\nHeera upon hearing the cries of Reshma, went to the place of\n\noffense and reiterated the complete story as is narrated by PW1 in\n\nhis testimony. No such fact is found in the testimony of PW 2\n\nwhich can shake its veracity.\n\n16. This Court also observes that testimonies of PW 3 (Jeeva) and\n\nPW 4 (Badi) also are in tandem with and duly corroborate the\n\nstory narrated by the PW 1 and PW 2. Further, there is no such\n\nfact found in their cross-examination which questions the\n\ncredibility of their statements given in examination-in-chief.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (16 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n17. This Court further observes that broadly the testimonies of all\n\nthe aforementioned eye-witnesses are in line with each other and\n\ntherefore, any minor contradictions in their statements are\n\nnaturally plausible to occur over a period of time and thus, are\n\ninsufficient to disbelieve their testimonies.\n\n18. This Court also observes that, as far as testimony of PW-5,\n\nReshma is concerned, it has been contended by the learned\n\ncounsel on behalf of the accused that she is child witness and her\n\nstatement has been recorded after a gap of one year and\n\ntherefore should be considered with caution. However, it is\n\nnoteworthy that, even though she is a child, her statement was\n\nrecorded only after subjecting her to the questions testing her\n\nability to understand the questions posed to her and her ability to\n\nanswer those questions using her intellect.\n\n18.1. Reshma in her testimony clearly stated that she saw her\n\nfather hitting her mother and brother with lathi, whereafter she\n\nstarted screaming and upon hearing her screams Heera along with\n\nTulsi, Badiya, Bedi, and Jeevni rushed to her house, whereupon\n\nthe accused fled.\n\n19. This Court further observes that, in a similar manner PW-6\n\n(Tulsiram) has also supported the testimony of other witnesses.\n\nHe states to have heard the screams of Reshma and to have run\n\ntowards the place of incident. He also states that to have seen the\n\nvictims lying on the ground and blood coming out of their heads.\n\nHe further supports rest of the prosecution story as is narrated by\n\nthe other witnesses. Even if this court considers that contention of\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (17 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nthe learned counsel on behalf of the accused that this witness was\n\nnot present exactly at the time when the incident took place and\n\nhe was present only after the offense in question was committed,\n\nthen also the facts narrated by him which are said to have\n\noccurred before and after the commission of the main act\n\nconstituting offense is also relevant under the \nSection 6\n, Indian\n\nEvidence Act as forming part of the same transaction.\n\n20. This Court also observes that, similarly PW-8 (Prabhulal) also\n\nin his testimony has testified that he was present at the spot of\n\ncrime after the accused fled away from the place and saw the\n\nvictims lying on the floor, which again becomes relevant as\n\nforming part of same transaction under \nSection 6\n, Indian\n\nEvidence Act.\n\n21. This court further observes that PW-7 (Nagla) and PW-10\n\n(Rakulal) testifies to have attested the Ex.P.-2 (Naksha Mauka)\n\nand Ex.P. 5 and 6 (Seizure Memo of the blood stained clothes of\n\nthe victims and the soil sample)\n\n22. This Court also observes that as far as the recovery of the\n\nweapon of offense is concerned, the prosecution has produced two\n\nwitnesses from its side in his regard i.e., PW-11 (Shankar) and\n\nPW-12 (Bahadur). Both these prosecution witnesses testified in\n\ntheir examination-in-chief to have witnessed the recovery of lathi\n\nin between stones on one 'Matasulla Hill' upon information given\n\nby the accused. They have also attested the recovery memo\n\n(Ex.P.-22) and have testified the presence of blood on the lathi.\n\nThey also state to have witnessed the preparation of Ex.P.-23\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (18 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n(Naksha Mauka) in their presence and to have attested both the\n\nmemos.\n\n22.1 This Court also observes that even though the\n\naforementioned witnesses state to have witnessed recovery of the\n\nweapon of offence from an open place; they also in their cross-\n\nexamination deny the fact that the place from where the said lathi\n\nwas recovered had similar lathis over there. Further, no such fact\n\nhas been brought to the light which can discredit the veracity of\n\nthese witnesses.\n\n23. This Court further observes that PW-13 (Basulal) testifies the\n\ndeposition of 7 seized articles by the investigating officer in the\n\nMalkhana and thereafter giving the same to PW-15 (Mahendra Pal)\n\nfor their deposition in the FSL Branch, Udaipur and thereafter\n\npresented its receipt on 28.06.2018. The aforementioned is\n\ncorroborated by Ex.P. 27A (Copy of Malkhana Register) and the\n\nstatements of PW-15, wherein he has also referred to Ex.P. 32\n\n(Forwarding Letter of his thana) and Ex.P. 33 (Forwarding Letter\n\nfrom the Superintendent of Police) to show that the seized items\n\nwere in same condition from malkhana to FSL, Udaipur. Therefore,\n\nthe factum of investigating officer sealing and depositing the\n\nseized items in the malkhana and thereafter, safely depositing it in\n\nthe FSL, Udaipur is duly proved.\n\n24. This Court also observes that PW-14 (Dr. Ravi Upadhyay) was\n\nproduced before the learned trial court as an expert witness by\n\nthe prosecution to show that the death of the victims was caused\n\ndue to injuries in their head, which is ante-mortem in nature. His\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (19 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nsignatures have also been shown to have been present on the\n\nPost-mortem report (Ex.P. 29) and Ex.P. 31, in order to prove their\n\ngenuineness.\n\n25. This Court further observes that the investigating officer while\n\nduly certifying the whole of the investigation has proved all the\n\ndiscoveries and seizures. On the point of recovery, the\n\ninvestigating officer even though as agreed to the factum of\n\ndiscovery being made from an open space, has also clarified in his\n\ntestimony that the said weapon was recovered underneath the\n\nstones, on the basis of the information provided by the accused.\n\nThe information vis-a-vis the presence of the weapon of offence is\n\nspecific and exclusive to the knowledge of the accused; further no\n\nsuch information has been found during the cross-examination of\n\ninvestigating officer i.e., PW-17 (Sajjan Singh) which could render\n\nthe investigation so done unreliable.\n\n26. This Court also observes that, it is noteworthy that the\n\naccused admits to have committed the act of hitting his wife and\n\nsone their heads; however, he takes the defense of unsoundness\n\nof mind at the time of committing the crime in question.\n\n27. This Court therefore observes that upon the basis of the\n\naforementioned analysis and appreciation of oral and documentary\n\nevidence available on record, it is duly proved that the prosecution\n\nhas proved its case beyond reasonable doubts, that at around\n\n2:00 am in the night of 15-06-2018, the accused assaulted his\n\nwife and son with lathi, with an intention of causing their death. In\n\nsuch a situation, the burden lies upon the accused-appellant to\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (20 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nprove unsoundness of mind in order to bring his case within the\n\npurview of general exceptions under \nIPC\n.\n\n28. This Court further observes that, on the point of the defense\n\nregarding unsoundness of mind, learned counsel on behalf of the\n\naccused contended that the accused was unsound at the time of\n\ncommission of offence and therefore was incapable of knowing the\n\nnature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or\n\ncontrary to law. However, the medical examination of the accused\n\navailable on record and reproduced below shows that the he was\n\nnot suffering from mental condition and therefore could not be\n\ntermed as one having unsound mind:\n\n \"Mental Status Examination:- On mental status examination he\n is conscious, cooperative and oriented to time, place and\n person. He is fairly ciad and kempt. Eye to eye contact present.\n Psychomotor activity with normal limits. Speech and language\n relevant with normal tone, volume and pressure. Reaction time\n is normal. Mood/affect euthymic. No abnormalities found in\n though and perception. Higher mental function is intact. No\n active psychopathology found at present.\n Conclusion: On the basis of the detailed behavioural\n observation, Mental Status and physical examination, members\n of medical board are of opinion that patient rupa is not suffering\n from any psychiatric illness at present.\"\n\n28.1. The aforementioned point regarding the absence of\n\nunsoundness of mind is also supported by the fact that the none\n\nof the witnesses in their statements mentioned about the\n\nunsoundness of the accused; at the most PW-2 and PW-3 among\n\nothers made statements in their cross-examination regarding the\n\nfact of the accused entering into altercations with the other\n\nvillagers and picking up fights with others due to his habit of\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (21 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nalcoholism. But the same does not go on to prove the accused's\n\nunsoundness of mind.\n\n29. This Court therefore observes that the accused has failed to\n\ndischarge his burden udner \nSection 105\n, Indian Evidence Act,\n\n1872 to prove unsoundness of mind and thereby is not entitled to\n\ndefense under \nSection 84\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the\n\nprosecution has been able to prove the case against him beyond\n\nall reasonable doubts.\n\n30. This Court, in light of the aforementioned factual matrix,\n\nwitnesses produced, the documentary evidences adduced and the\n\ncases cited, finds that the prosecution in the instant case has\n\nbeen successful in proving the case against the accused (Rupa)\n\nbeyond all reasonable doubts and therefore the learned trial court\n\nhas rightly convicted him under \nSection 302\n of the IPC.\n\n31. Once this Court has arrived at a conclusion that the impugned\n\njudgment of conviction does not suffer from any infirmity and the\n\nappellant's crime has been demonstrated by the prosecution with\n\nthe help of the aforestated evidence no case for making any\n\ninterference in the impugned judgment of conviction is made out.\n\n32. The second issue which now requires consideration of this\n\nCourt is regarding the sentence and this Court is conscious of the\n\nfact that learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted that\n\nthe capital sentence would require this Court to apply the test of\n\nrarest of rare cases, and also this Court shall have to look at the\n\ngravity and the mitigating circumstances which are applicable in\n\nthe present case.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (22 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n32.1. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned\n\ntrial court, while considering the sentence, has held that upon\n\nweighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case\n\nat hand, the scales tip towards aggravating circumstances and\n\nonly when the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating\n\ncircumstances, the approprpriate sentence is a capital\n\npunishment. He submitted that the mitigating circumstances as\n\ndelineated by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Ram Naresh &\n\nOrs. Vs. Chattisgarh, AIR 2012 SC 1357, specifically provide for\n\nthe mitigating circumstances which should be given weightage\n\nwhile considering the awarding of sentence. One of the\n\ncircumstance, which should be considered and weighed as a\n\nmitigating circumstance are those conditions or circumstances in\n\nwhich, the said offence has been committed or in other words,\n\nwhether at the time of commission of the said offence, the\n\naccused was either mentally or emotionally disturbed or was\n\nunder provocation. Similarly, one of the circumstances is where\n\nthe sole eyewitness was not creditworthy. In the case at hand, the\n\naccused was admittedly not having any criminal antecedent nor\n\nwas he having any psychological tendencies, which would have\n\nmade it apparent that the said accused would be a threat to\n\nsociety at large.\n\n32.2. Learned counsel further submitted that, admittedly the\n\naccused was a family man, who was taking care of his family,\n\nwhich is apparent that he had a son 12 years of age, a daughter 8\n\nyears of age, and admittedly the accused never assaulted the said\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (23 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\ndaughter nor was any evidence that he was regularly assaulting\n\nhis wife. Under such circumstances, considering these mitigating\n\nfactors- particularly the absence of any acts that could be\n\ncharacterized as cruel or inhuman, so as to warrant the awarding\n\nof capital punishment, the said order of sentence is not\n\nsustainable. Though it is true that the allegation is of causing\n\ndeath of wife and son, however, the time of the occurrence,\n\nmitigating circumstances and the fact that only one injury was to\n\neach, makes it apparent that the case at hand does not fall in the\n\ncategory of rarest and rare cases, so as to justify awarding of\n\ncapital punishment and therefore, the order of learned trial court\n\ndeserves to be appropriately modified.\n\n32.3. While taking into consideration the perspectives raised, this\n\nCourt finds that the gravity of the circumstances including the\n\ngruesomeness and heinousness of the crime and condition in\n\nwhich it was committed are of extreme nature and do not call for\n\nany leniency.\n\n32.4. This Court also observes that the principle of death penalty\n\nhas been dealt with in various cases by the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nfrom time to time and the principle was laid down to the effect of\n\n\"Aggravating circumstances -- (Crime test) and Mitigating\n\ncircumstances -- (Criminal test)\", to ascertain whether the\n\ncase falls under the rarest of rare case or not. A proper evaluation\n\nwas laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in a recent case of\n\nManoj Pratap Singh Vs State of Rajasthan (Special Leave\n\nPetition (CRL.) Nos. 7899-7900/2015), decided on\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (24 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n24.06.2022), relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced\n\nas hereunder:-\n\n \"Death sentence: Evolution of principles and norms\n .....\n\n 44. We may now usefully summarise the salient features of\n evolution of legal principles and norms for dealing with the\n question of sentencing in such matters where the sentence of\n death could also be awarded, particularly with reference to the\n leading cases and expositions therein.\n\n 44.1. \nIn the case of \nJagmohan Singh v. The State of U.P.\n:\n\n (1973) 1 SCC 20, the questions in their broader spectrum were\n raised about the constitutional impermissibility of death sentence\n with the submissions: (i) that the death sentence was\n unreasonable for it would put an end to all the rights guaranteed\n under clauses (a) to (g) of \nArticle 19(1)\n of the Constitution of\n India; (ii) that the discretion vested in the Judges to impose\n capital punishment was not based on any standards or policy\n and hence, the provision suffered from the vice of excessive\n delegation of legislative function; (iii) that the uncontrolled and\n unguided discretion in the Judges to impose capital punishment\n or imprisonment for life was hit by \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution\n of India; and (iv) that under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, no\n person shall be deprived of his life except according to the\n procedure established by law but, the provisions of law did not\n provide a procedure for trial of factors and circumstances crucial\n for making the choice between the capital punishment and\n imprisonment for life.\n\n \n44.2. Two major factors/events after the decision in \nJagmohan\n\n (supra) led to another reference to the Constitution Bench of this\n Court in regard to the constitutional validity of death penalty for\n the offence of murder as also of the sentencing procedure. One\n had been the amendment of the law relating to criminal\n procedure with advent of the \nCode of the Criminal Procedure\n,\n 1973 in replacement of the old Code of 1898, which introduced,\n as regards sentencing procedure, the above-quoted subsection (2)\n of Section 235 and sub-section (3) of Section 354. Several persons\n convicted of murder and sentenced to death filed the petitions\n under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution of India challenging the\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (25 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n constitutional validity of death penalty provided in \nSection 302\n\n IPC for the offence of murder and that of the sentencing\n procedure provided in sub-section (3) of \nSection 354\n CrPC.\n \nThe\n other one had been the majority opinion of a 3 Judge Bench of\n this Court in the case of \nRajendra Prasad v. State of Uttar\n Pradesh\n: (1979) 3 SCC 646, purportedly seeking to whittle down\n the ratio of \nJagmohan\n (supra); and correctness of such an\n opinion having been doubted by another Bench of this Court. The\n reference so made to the Constitution Bench came to be\n answered in locus classicus Bachan Singh (1980) 2 SCC 684\n with its 'rarest of rare' doctrine. The opinion of majority in\n Bachan Singh is the guiding light and foundational discipline for\n all the later developments and enunciations on the subject.\n\n .....\n\n 44.3. \nIn \nBachan Singh\n (supra), the Constitution Bench of this\n Court examined two major questions, i.e., as to whether death\n penalty provided for the offence of murder under \nSection 302\n IPC\n was unconstitutional; and if not, as to whether the sentencing\n procedure in \nSection 354(3)\n CrPC was unconstitutional on the\n ground that it invested the Court with unguided and\n untrammelled discretion. 44.3.1. After having examined a\n variety of features and factors pertaining to \nArticles 19(1)\n and\n \n21\n of the Constitution of India, the Court (per majority of the\n Constitution Bench) answered the first question in the negative,\n while observing and pointing out, inter alia, as under: -\n\n \"132. To sum up, the question whether or not death penalty\n serves any penological purpose is a difficult, complex and\n intractable issue. It has evoked strong, divergent views. For the\n purpose of testing the constitutionality of the impugned provision\n as to death penalty in Section 302 of the Penal Code on the\n ground of reasonableness in the light of \nArticles 19\n and \n21\n of the\n Constitution, it is not necessary for us to express any categorical\n opinion, one way or the other, as to which of these two\n antithetical views, held by the Abolitionists and Retentionists, is\n correct. It is sufficient to say that the very fact that persons of\n reason, learning and light are rationally and deeply divided in\n their opinion on this issue, is a ground among others, for\n rejecting the petitioners argument that retention of death penalty\n in the impugned provision, is totally devoid of reason and\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (26 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n purpose. If, notwithstanding the view of the Abolitionists to the\n contrary, a very large segment of people, the world over,\n including sociologists, legislators, jurists, judges and\n administrators still firmly believe in the worth and necessity of\n capital punishment for the protection of society, if in the\n perspective of prevailing crime conditions in India, contemporary\n public opinion channelized through the people's representatives\n in Parliament, has repeatedly in the last three decades, rejected\n all attempts, including the one made recently, to abolish or\n specifically restrict the area of death penalty, if death penalty is\n still a recognised legal sanction for murder or some types of\n murder in most of the civilised countries in the world, if the\n framers of the Indian Constitution were fully aware -- as we shall\n presently show they were -- of the existence of death penalty as\n punishment for murder, under the Penal Code, 1860, if the 35th\n Report and subsequent reports of the Law Commission\n suggesting retention of death penalty, and recommending\n revision of the \nCriminal Procedure Code\n and the insertion of the\n new Sections 235(2) and 354(3) in that Code providing for\n presentence hearing and sentencing procedure on conviction for\n murder and other capital offences were before the Parliament\n and presumably considered by it when in 1972-1973 it took up\n revision of the Code of 1898 and replaced it by the \nCode of\n Criminal Procedure\n, 1973, it is not possible to hold that the\n provision of death penalty as an alternative punishment for\n murder, in Section 302 of the Penal Code is unreasonable and not\n in the public interest. We would, therefore, conclude that the\n impugned provision in Section 302, violates neither the letter nor\n the ethos of \nArticle 19.\n ....\n\n ...\n\n 44.4. \nIn fact, \nBachan Singh\n (supra) judgment has been succinctly\n summarised and its principles explained by another Constitution\n Bench of this Court in the case of \nMithu v. State of Punjab\n:\n\n (1983) 2 SCC 277 while dealing with the question of\n constitutional validity of \nSection 303\n IPC, which provided for\n death sentence as the mandatory punishment for a person who,\n being under sentence of imprisonment for life, would commit\n murder. \nIn the course of declaring the said provision contained in\n \nSection 303\n IPC constitutionally invalid, the Constitution Bench\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (27 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n dealt with a large number of arguments; and one of them had\n been that the validity of death sentence had already been upheld\n in \nBachan Singh\n (supra ) and, therefore, such questions should\n not be allowed to raise their head over again. While pointing out\n the fallacy of this argument, the Constitution Bench explained as\n to what exactly had been the ratio of Bachan Singh in the\n following words: -\n\n \n\"7.....The majority did not lay down any abstract proposition in\n Bachan Singh that \"death sentence is Constitutional\", that is to\n say, that \"It is permissible under the Constitution to provide for\n the sentence of death\". To be exact, the question which arose for\n the consideration of the Court was not whether, under the\n Constitution, it is permissible to provide for the sentence of\n death. The precise question which arose \nin that case\n was whether\n Section 302 of the Penal Code which provides for the sentence of\n death as one of the two alternative sentences is valid. It may be\n recalled that Section 302 provides for the sentence of death as an\n alternative sentence which may be imposed. The normal sentence\n for murder is life imprisonment; and if the death sentence has to\n be imposed, the Court is under a legal obligation under \nSection\n 354(3)\n of the Criminal Procedure Code to state the special\n reasons for imposing that sentence. That explains why, in Bachan\n Singh, Sarkaria J., who spoke for the majority, underscored the\n words \"alternative\" and \"may\" in paragraph 19 of the judgment,\n whilst observing that prescribes death as an alternative\n punishment to which the offender may be sentenced in cases\n relating to seven kinds of offences. The majority concluded that\n of the Penal Code is valid for three main reasons: Firstly, that the\n death sentence provided for by Section 302 is an alternative to\n the sentence of life imprisonment, secondly, that special reasons\n have to be stated if the normal rule is departed from and the\n death sentence has to be imposed; and, thirdly, because the\n accused is entitled, under \nSection 235(2)\n of the Code of Criminal\n Procedure, to be heard on the question of sentence. The last of\n these three reasons becomes relevant, only because of the first of\n these reasons......\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n \n[2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (28 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n 44.5. Thereafter, in \nMachhi Singh\n (supra), a 3-Judge Bench of\n this Court, while considering a case where the appellant was\n convicted of orchestrating and executing a conspiracy, which\n resulted in the murder of as many as 17 people due to a family\n feud, explained the philosophy pertaining to the death sentence\n in the following words: -\n\n \"32. ...Every member of the community owes a debt to the\n community for this protection. When ingratitude is shown instead\n of gratitude by \"killing\" a member of the community which\n protects the murderer himself from being killed, or when the\n community feels that for the sake of self-preservation the killer\n has to be killed, the community may well withdraw the protection\n by sanctioning the death penalty. But the community will not do\n so in every case. It may do so \"in rarest of rare cases\" when its\n collective conscience is so shocked that it will expect the holders\n of the judicial power centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of\n their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of\n retaining death penalty. The community may entertain such a\n sentiment when the crime is viewed from the platform of the\n motive for, or the manner of commission of the crime....\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n 44.5.1. The Court also explained the relevant propositions of\n \nBachan Singh\n (supra) and the pertinent queries for applying\n those propositions in the following terms: -\n\n \"38. \nIn this background the guidelines indicated in \nBachan Singh\n\n case will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each\n individual case where the question of imposing of death sentence\n arises.\n \nThe following propositions emerge from \nBachan Singh\n\n case: (i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except\n in gravest cases of extreme culpability. (ii) Before opting for the\n death penalty the circumstances of the 'offender' also require to\n be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the\n 'crime'. (iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is\n an exception. In other words death sentence must be imposed\n only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether\n inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (29 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, the\n option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be\n conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and\n circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.\n\n (iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\n has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances\n have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be\n struck between the aggravating and the mitigating\n circumstances before the option is exercised.\n\n 39. In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following\n questions may be asked and answered: (a) Is there something\n uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of\n imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence?\n\n (b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no\n alternative but to impose death sentence even after according\n maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which\n speak in favour of the offender?\n\n 40. If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances\n in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account\n the answers to the questions posed hereinabove, the\n circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is\n warranted, the court would proceed to do so.\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n 44.6. Another relevant decision to be noticed is that in the case of\n \nSwamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka\n: (2008) 13\n SCC 767. The said decision was rendered by a 3- Judge Bench of\n this Court in the backdrop that though a 2-Judge Bench of this\n Court upheld the conviction of the appellant of offences under\n \nSections 302\n and \n201\n IPC but, one of the learned Judges felt that\n in the facts and circumstances of the case, punishment of\n imprisonment till the end of the natural life of the convict would\n serve the ends of justice, whereas the other learned Judge was of\n the view that the appellant was liable to the punishment of death.\n In keeping with the ever-progressing canons of penology, the 3-\n Judge Bench carved out a different course, being of not awarding\n death penalty but, of conditioning the sentence of imprisonment\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (30 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n for life with a rider that the convict shall not be released from\n the prison for the rest of his life. The Court explained the logic of\n such sentencing, which overrides the availability of remission, in\n the following terms: -\n\n \"92. The matter may be looked at from a slightly different angle.\n The issue of sentencing has two aspects. A sentence may be\n excessive and unduly harsh or it may be highly\n disproportionately inadequate. When an appellant comes to this\n Court carrying a death sentence awarded by the trial court and\n confirmed by the High Court, this Court may find, as in the\n present appeal, that the case just falls short of the rarest of the\n rare category and may feel somewhat reluctant in endorsing the\n death sentence. But at the same time, having regard to the\n nature of the crime, the Court may strongly feel that a sentence\n of life imprisonment subject to remission normally works out to a\n term of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and\n inadequate. What then should the Court do? If the Court's option\n is limited only to two punishments, one a sentence of\n imprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14\n years and the other death, the Court may feel tempted and find\n itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course\n would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable and\n proper course would be to expand the options and to take over\n what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court i.e. the\n vast hiatus between 14 years' imprisonment and death. It needs\n to be emphasised that the Court would take recourse to the\n expanded option primarily because in the facts of the case, the\n sentence of 14 years' imprisonment would amount to no\n punishment at all.\n\n 93. Further, the formalisation of a special category of sentence,\n though for an extremely few number of cases, shall have the\n great advantage of having the death penalty on the statute book\n but to actually use it as little as possible, really in the rarest of\n rare cases. This would only be a reassertion of the Constitution\n Bench decision in Bachan Singh besides being in accord with the\n modern trends in penology.\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (31 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n 44.7. We need not elongate this discussion by assembling various\n other decisions rendered in variegated circumstances and factual\n matrices but deem it appropriate to refer to the decision in the\n case of \nShankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra\n:\n\n (2013) 5 SCC 546, wherein this Court surveyed a large number\n of cases on either side that is, where death sentence was upheld/\n awarded or where it was commuted; and pointed out the\n requirement of applying 'crime test', 'criminal test' and 'rarest of\n rare test'. This Court recounted, with reference to previous\n decisions, the aggravating circumstances (crime test) and the\n mitigating circumstances (criminal test) as follows: -\n\n 49. \nIn Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh cases, this Court laid\n down various principles for awarding sentence: (\nRajendra\n Pralhadrao\n case, SCC pp. 47-48, para 33)\n\n \"Aggravating circumstances -- (Crime test)\n\n (1) The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like\n murder, rape, armed dacoity, kidnapping, etc. by the accused\n with a prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences\n committed by the person having a substantial history of serious\n assaults and criminal convictions.\n\n (2) The offence was committed while the offender was engaged in\n the commission of another serious offence.\n\n (3) The offence was committed with the intention to create a fear\n psychosis in the public at large and was committed in a public\n place by a weapon or device which clearly could be hazardous to\n the life of more than one person.\n\n (4) The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like\n offences to receive money or monetary benefits.\n (5) Hired killings.\n\n (6) The offence was committed outrageously for want only while\n involving inhumane treatment and torture to the victim.\n (7) The offence was committed by a person while in lawful\n custody.\n\n (8) The murder or the offence was committed to prevent a person\n lawfully carrying out his duty like arrest or custody in a place of\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (32 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n lawful confinement of himself or another. For instance, murder is\n 51 of a person who had acted in lawful discharge of his duty\n under \nSection 43\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n (9) When the crime is enormous in proportion like making an\n attempt of murder of the entire family or members of a\n particular\n community.\n\n (10) When the victim is innocent, helpless or a person relies upon\n the trust of relationship and social norms, like a child, helpless\n woman, a daughter or a niece staying with a father/uncle and is\n inflicted with the crime by such a trusted person.\n (11) When murder is committed for a motive which evidences\n total depravity and meanness.\n\n (12) When there is a cold-blooded murder without provocation.\n (13) The crime is committed so brutally that it pricks or shocks\n not only the judicial conscience but even the conscience of the\n society.\n\n Mitigating circumstances -- (Criminal test)\n\n (1) The manner and circumstances in and under which the\n offence was committed, for example, extreme mental or\n emotional disturbance or extreme provocation in\n contradistinction to all these situations in normal course.\n (2) The age of the accused is a relevant consideration but not a\n determinative factor by itself.\n\n (3) The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of\n the crime again and the probability of the accused being\n reformed and rehabilitated.\n\n (4) The condition of the accused shows that he was mentally\n defective and the defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the\n circumstances of his criminal conduct.\n\n (5) The circumstances which, in normal course of life, would\n render such a behaviour possible and could have the effect of\n giving rise to mental imbalance in that given situation like\n persistent harassment or, in fact, leading to such a peak of\n human behaviour that, in the facts and circumstances of the\n case, the accused believed that he was morally justified in\n committing the offence.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (33 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n (6) Where the court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of\n the view that the crime was not committed in a preordained\n manner and that the death resulted in the course of commission\n of another crime and that there was a possibility of it being\n construed as consequences to the commission of the primary\n crime.\n\n (7) Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a\n sole eyewitness though the prosecution has brought home the\n guilt of the accused.\"\n\n This Court further said: -\n\n \"52. Aggravating circumstances as pointed out above, of course,\n are not exhaustive so also the mitigating circumstances. In my\n considered view, the tests that we have to apply, while awarding\n death sentence are \"crime test\", \"criminal test\" and the \"R-R test\"\n\n and not the \"balancing test\". To award death sentence, the \"crime\n test\" has to be fully satisfied, that is, 100% and \"criminal test\"\n\n 0%, that is, no mitigating circumstance favouring the accused. If\n there is any circumstance favouring the accused, like lack of\n intention to commit the crime, possibility of reformation, young\n age of the accused, not a menace to the society, no previous\n track record, etc. the \"criminal test\" may favour the accused to\n avoid the capital punishment. Even if both the tests are satisfied,\n that is, the aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent and\n no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused, still we have\n to apply finally the rarest of the rare case test (R-R test). R-R test\n depends upon the perception of the society that is \"society-\n centric\" and not \"Judge-centric\", that is, whether the society will\n approve the awarding of death sentence to certain types of\n crimes or not. While applying that test, the court has to look into\n variety of factors like society's abhorrence, extreme indignation\n and antipathy to certain types of crimes like sexual assault\n and murder of intellectually challenged minor girls, suffering\n from physical disability, old and infirm women with those\n disabilities, etc. Examples are only illustrative and not\n exhaustive. The courts award death sentence since situation\n demands so, due to constitutional compulsion, reflected by the\n will of the people and not the will of the Judges.\"\n\n (emphasis and extra emphasis supplied)\"\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (34 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n32.5. This Court further observes that after evolution of the death\n\npenalty (capital punishment), there are two relevant factors,\n\nnamely, Aggravating Circumstances -- (Crime test) and Mitigating\n\nCircumstances -- (Criminal test). The Aggravating Circumstances\n\n(Crime Test) is for awarding the death penalty, wherein the\n\nparameters to ascertain that the case is falling under the rarest of\n\nrare category are laid down. As regards the present case, the\n\nsame leaves no room for doubt and this Court is satisfied that the\n\ncase is not falling under the rarest of rare category and comes\n\nunder the Mitigating Circumstances -- (Criminal test). This Court\n\nfurther observes that the Mitigating Circumstances -- (Criminal\n\ntest) basically comes into play where there is a doubt and this\n\nCourt is satisfied to avoid the death sentence (Capital\n\nPunishment) in the present case, as it was stated by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court, in a catena of judgments from time to time \"To award\n\ndeath sentence, the \"crime test\" has to be fully satisfied, that is,\n\n100% and \"criminal test\" 0%, that is, no mitigating circumstance\n\nfavouring the accused\".\"\n\n33. The Court has to respond to the cry of justice, against the\n\naccused, of the complainant family on one hand, and the society\n\non the other hand while imposing the punishment befitting to the\n\ncrime, but at the same time, has to balance the parameters of\n\nrarest of rare cases for awarding the capital punishment.\n\n34. This Court also observes that as per the above-quoted\n\nAggravating Circumstances -- (Crime test) and Mitigating\n\nCircumstances -- (Criminal test), as well as the possibility of\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (35 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\nreformation, family background of the accused, the manner in\n\nwhich he has lived with his family amicably, without any\n\nsubstantial evidence vis-a-vis any altercation or dispute between\n\nhim and his wife, the accused not being a menace to the society,\n\nno previous criminal record, the award of capital punishment to\n\nthe accused-appellant can be avoided as his case is considered\n\nunder the Mitigation Circumstance (Criminal Test) for his re-\n\nintegration in the society, after serving his sentence, as has been\n\nheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of the State of\n\nHaryana Vs Anand Kindo & Anr. (Criminal Appeal Nos. 1797-\n\n1798/2010 along with other connected matters, decided on\n\n08.09.2022)' the relevant portion of the said judgment is\n\nreproduced as hereunder: -\n\n \"12. On consideration of the matter, we consider appropriate to\n impose a fixed term sentence of 30 years. Even at that age, the\n convicts would be in their 50s and we hope and pray that they\n would have learned their lesson and joined the society as\n responsible members at that stage.\n\n 13. In Shankar Kishanrao khade vs. State of Mahrashtra (2013) 5\n SCC 546, it was held that if there is any circumstance favouring\n the accused such as lack of intention to commit the crime,\n possibility of reformation, young age of the accused, accused not\n being a menance to the society, no previous criminal record etc.,\n the accused may avoid capital punishment. The Court opined\n that the crime is important but so is the criminal and hence the\n Supreme Court in recent past has substituted death penalty with\n fixed term sentences exceeding 14 years. In appropriate cases\n such as the present case, imposing a fixed term sentence creates\n a possibility for the convict to re-integrate into society after\n serving his/her sentence. It strikes a delicate balance between\n the victims' plea for justice and rehabilitative justice for the\n convicts.\"\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n \n[2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (36 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n34.1. At this juncture, this Court considers it appropriate to\n\nreproduce the relevant portion of the judgment rendered in Kashi\n\nNath Singh alias \nKallu Singh Vs. State of Jharkhand\n, (2023) 7\n\nSCC 317 as hereunder:\n\n \n\"6. The argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellant\n was that there is no reasoning given by the High Court that there\n are no chances of his reformation. As there is no criminal history\n of the appellant, there are chances of his reformation. Therefore,\n this Court may modify the sentence awarded to the appellant\n while granting him benefit of remission, to whatever he is\n entitled to. He has further submitted that if the benefit of\n remission cannot be granted, the sentence awarded to the\n appellant may be reduced to certain limited period instead of\n whole of his biological life. Reference was made to the decision of\n this Court in Shiva Kumar alias \nShivamurthy v. State of\n Karnataka\n (2023) 9 SCC 817.\n\n 7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent\n submitted that it is a case of brutal rape and murder of a 14\n year old girl. The appellant, after committing the rape, was in\n the process of killing her by hitting her head and body with\n stone. He was trying to deface her face so that she could not be\n recognised. He was seen doing so by family members of the\n deceased when they went out for search. Keeping in view the\n mindset of the appellant, he does not deserve any further\n leniency in sentencing as the High Court had already commuted\n the death sentence to life imprisonment.\n\n 10. Though notice was issued only to consider whether the\n appellant could be extended the benefit of remission, however,\n considering the severity of the offence committed by the\n appellant, we do not find any merit in that submission. However,\n still considering the fact that the appellant was 26 years of age\n when the offence was committed and there may be chances of his\n reformation, but still undue leniency in sentencing shakes public\n confidence in the criminal justice system, the deterrent effect\n may not be there. The rights of the victim and his family\n members are also to be considered.\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (37 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n 11. Keeping in view the totality of circumstances, the sentence of\n life imprisonment for the whole of the biological life of the\n appellant, without any benefit of remission deserves to be\n modified to the fixed term sentence for a period of 30 years\n without any benefit of remission so that prime period of his life is\n spent in jail. The appellant shall be released from jail only after\n undergoing full sentence of 30 years, excluding the period of\n imprisonment already undergone.\"\n\n34.2. This Court also considers it appropriate to reproduce the\n\nrelevant portion of the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of Navas @ Mulanavas Vs. State of Kerala\n\n(Criminal Appeal No.1215/2011, decided on 18.03.2024), as\n\nhereunder:\n\n \n\"57. A journey through the cases set out hereinabove shows that\n the fundamental underpinning is the principle of proportionality.\n The aggravating and mitigating circumstances which the Court\n considers while deciding commutation of penalty from death to\n life imprisonment, have a large bearing in deciding the number\n of years of compulsory imprisonment without remission, too. As\n a judicially trained mind pores and ponders over the aggravating\n and mitigating circumstances and in cases where they decide to\n commute the death penalty they would by then have a\n reasonable idea as to what would be the appropriate period of\n sentence to be imposed under the \nSwamy Shraddananda\n\n (supra) principle too. Matters are not cut and dried and nicely\n weighed here to formulate a uniform principle.\n That is where the\n experience of the judicially trained mind comes in as pointed out\n in V. Sriharan (supra). Illustratively in the process of arriving at\n the number of years as the most appropriate for the case at\n hand, which the convict will have to undergo before which the\n remission powers could be invoked, some of the relevant factors\n that the courts bear in mind are:- (a) the number of deceased\n who are victims of that crime and their age and gender; (b) the\n nature of injuries including sexual assault if any; (c) the motive\n for which the offence was committed; (d) whether the offence was\n committed when the convict was on bail in another case; (e) the\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (38 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n premeditated nature of the offence; (f) the relationship between\n the offender and the victim; (g) the abuse of trust if any; (h) the\n criminal antecedents; and whether the convict, if released, would\n be a menace to the society. Some of the positive factors have\n been, (1) age of the convict; (2) the probability of reformation of\n convict; (3) the convict not being a professional killer; (4) the\n socioeconomic condition of the accused; (5) the composition of\n the family of the accused and (6) conduct expressing remorse.\n\n These were some of the relevant factors that were kept in mind\n in the cases noticed above while weighing the pros and cons of\n the matter. The Court would be additionally justified in\n considering the conduct of the convict in jail; and the period\n already undergone to arrive at the number of years which the\n Court feels the convict should, serve as part of the sentence of\n life imprisonment and before which he cannot apply for\n remission. These are not meant to be exhaustive but illustrative\n and each case would depend on the facts and circumstances\n therein.\n\n Conclusion:\n\n \n60. For the reasons stated above, we uphold the judgment of the\n High Cout insofar as the conviction of the appellant under\n \nSections 302\n, \n449\n and \n309\n IPC is concerned. We also do not\n interfere with the sentence imposed on the accused for the\n offence under Section 449 and \nSection 309\n of IPC. We hold that\n the High Court was justified on the facts of the case in following\n \nSwamy Shraddananda\n (supra) principle while imposing\n sentence for the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC. However, in view\n of the discussion made above, we are inclined to modify the\n sentence under Section 302 imposed by the High Court from a\n period of 30 years imprisonment without remission to that of a\n period of 25 years imprisonment without remission, including the\n period already undergone. In our view, this would serve the ends\n of justice.\"\n\n35. This Court while applying the above test finds that the present\n\naccused-appellant is not having any criminal antecedent nor is he\n\nhaving any psychological tendencies, which would make it\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (39 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\napparent that the said accused would be a threat to society at\n\nlarge. The accused was a family man, who was taking care of his\n\nfamily, which is apparent that he had a son 12 years of age, a\n\ndaughter 8 years of age, and admittedly the accused never\n\nassaulted the said daughter nor was any evidence that he was\n\nregularly assaulting his wife. Further, considering the mitigating\n\nfactors viz., particularly the absence of any acts that could be\n\ncharacterized as cruel or inhuman, so as to warrant the awarding\n\nof capital punishment, the said order of sentence is not\n\nsustainable. Though it is true that the allegation is of causing\n\ndeath of wife and son, however, the time of the occurrence,\n\nmitigating circumstances and the fact that only one injury was to\n\neach caused, makes it apparent that the case at hand does not fall\n\nin the category of rarest and rare cases, so as to justify awarding\n\nof capital punishment. This Court also finds that the mitigating\n\nfactors which have been settled in the precedent law settled by\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court and also the Hon'ble Apex Court's\n\npronouncements making it clear that merely because a crime is\n\nheinous, it cannot become a sole ground for awarding capital\n\npunishment to the perpetrator without weighing the other factors.\n\n36. This Court, while weighing the different parameters which has\n\nbeen observed as above, as well as the precedent laws cited\n\nabove, is of the view that the fixed term of twenty years will serve\n\nthe purpose of justice in the present case.\n\n37. Thus, in view of the above the above-numbered murder\n\nreference for confirmation of death sentence is answered in\n\n (Downloaded on 18/12/2024 at 10:09:42 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:51380-DB] (40 of 40) [MREF-1/2023]\n\n negative. The appeal preferred by the accused-appellant to assail\n\n the impugned judgment is partly allowed. His conviction as\n\n recorded by the learned Trial Court for the offences mentioned\n\n above is affirmed. For the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC, the\n\n death sentence awarded to the accused-appellant is commuted to\n\n 20 years imprisonment, without any possibility of parole or\n\n premature release. The above-numbed Murder Reference is\n\n disposed of accordingly. The record be returned to the learned\n\n Trial Court forthwith.\n\n 38. This Court is thankful to Mr. Vineet Jain, learned Senior\n\n Counsel assisted by Mr. Kuldeep Sharma, Pro-Bono Counsel for\n\n the assistance so provided by appearing for the accused-appellant,\n\n who have not only provided precedent laws and have taken this\n\n Court to each and every prosecution witness but also the exhibits\n\n to demonstrate the criminal jurisprudence applicable in the\n\n present case.\n\n (MUNNURI LAXMAN),J (DR.

But at the same time, having regard to the\n nature of the crime, the Court may strongly feel that a sentence\n of life imprisonment subject to remission normally works out to a\n term of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and\n inadequate. What then should the Court do? If the Court's option\n is limited only to two punishments, one a sentence of\n imprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14\n years and the other death, the Court may feel tempted and find\n itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course\n would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable and\n proper course would be to expand the options and to take over\n what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court i.e. the\n vast hiatus between 14 years' imprisonment and death. It needs\n to be emphasised that the Court would take recourse to the\n expanded option primarily because in the facts of the case, the\n sentence of 14 years' imprisonment would amount to no\n punishment at all."
