CRIMINAL CASE No. 7644 of 2024\n\nBETWEEN:-\nPRAVEEN BAJORIYA S/O SHRI MUKESH BAJORIYA,\nAGED 18 YEARS, R/O GRAM SUNDARPUR POLICE\nTHANA CIVIL LINE DISTRICT MORENA (MADHYA\nPRADESH)\n\n.....APPLICANT\n(SHRI PRADEEP KATARE- ADVOCATE)\n\nAND\nSTATE OF MADHYA PRADESH THROUGH POLICE\nTHANA CIVIL LINE DISTRICT MORENA (MADHYA\nPRADESH)\n\n.....RESPONDENT\n(SHRI LOKENDRA SHRIVASTAVA- PANEL LAYWER)\n(SHRI MADHUKAR KULSHRESTHA- ADVOCATE FOR THE\nCOMPLAINANT)\n\nThis application coming on for HEARING this day, th e court passed\nthe following:\nORDER\n\nThis first bail application has been filed by applicant under\nSection 439\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for grant of bail in connection with\nCrime No. 02/2024 registered at Police Station Civil Lines, District Morena\n(M.P.) for offence punishable under\nSections 376\n,\n,\n,\nof IPC and\n\nSection 3\n/\nof the POCSO Act. The applicant is in judicial custody since\n03.01.2024.\n\nA s per the case of prosecution, prosecutrix aged around 17 years\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: AVINASH\n\nBHARGAV\n\nSigning time: 23-02-2024\n\n04:44:19 PM\nreported to Police Station Civil Lines, District Morena on 01.01.2024 at 18:00\nhours that a neighbour Praveen Bajoriya was harassing her to make friendship.\nOn intervening night of 26.12.2023 and 27.12.2023 around 02:00 in the night,\nshe was sleeping at her home along with her family members. Praveen entered\nher room and asked her to go out of the room with him. As she refused,\nPraveen suffocated her and took her to the bathroom in the courtyard. Praveen\nclosed the door of the bathroom and committed rape on her. Hearing her\nshouts, her parents came there. Praveen fled away after threatening to kill her, if\nshe reports. She narrated the incident to her parents, but could not report the\nincident due to fear of Praveen. On such allegations, Police Station Civil Lines,\n\nDistrict Morena registered FIR at Crime No. 02/2024 for offence punishable\nunder\nSections 376\n,\n,\n,\nof IPC and\nSection 3\n/\nof the POCSO Act.\nVictim was forwarded for medico legal examination. Applicant was arrested on\n03.01.2024. He is in custody ever since. Statement of prosecutrix was recorded\nunder\nSection 164\nof CrPC. On completion of investigation, final report was\nsubmitted on 14.01.2024.\n\nLearned Counsel for the applicant, in addition to the grounds mentioned\nin the application, submits that applicant has been falsely implicated in the\nmatter under pressure of the family members of the victim. Learned counsel\nreferring to the contents of FIR submits that the incident seems to be highly\nimprobable. Learned counsel further referring to the Medical Report submits\nthat the injuries found on person of the victim were reported to be caused within\n24 hours, which prima facie shows false implication. Delay in lodging FIR\nsubstantiates false implication with premeditation and preparation. Learned\ncounsel further submits that applicant is aged around 18 years and he has just\nattained majority. He is pursuing his BSC Degree course. No criminal\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: AVINASH\n\nBHARGAV\n\nSigning time: 23-02-2024\n\n04:44:19 PM\nantecedent is reported against the applicant. There is no likelihood of his\nabsconsion leaving his family and home. There is no likelihood of his\nabsconsion or tampering with the evidence. Jail incarceration on false allegations\nis causing hardship to the young applicant. Trial would take time to conclude.\nTherefore, applicant may be extended the benefit of bail.\n\nP e r contra, learned Counsel for the State ably assisted by learned\ncounsel for the complainant opposes the bail application on the ground of\ngravity of alleged offence.\n\nHeard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.\nConsidering the arguments advanced by both the parties and overall\ncircumstances of the case regard being had to the young age of the applicant,\nbut without commenting on merits of the case, this Court is inclined to release\nthe applicant on bail. Thus, the application is allowed.\n\nAccordingly, it is directed that applicant Praveen Bajoriya shall be\nreleased on bail in relation to Crime No. 02/2024 registered at Police Station\nCivil Lines, District Morena (M.P.) for offence punishable under\nSections 376\n,\n,\n,\nof IPC and\nSection 3\n/\nof the POCSO Act, upon furnishing a\npersonal bond in the sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs.
