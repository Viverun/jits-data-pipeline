No.50855/2021\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nGwalior, Dated: 09-11-2021\n\nShri Anoop Kumar Gupta, Advocate for applicants.\n\nShri BPS Chauhan, Public Prosecutor for respondent\n\nno.1/State.\n\nThis application under\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. has been filed for\n\nquashing the FIR in Crime No.54/2018 registered at Police Station\n\nGormi, District Bhind as well as for quashing the further proceedings\n\nin RCT No.290/2018 pending in the Court of JMFC, Mehgaon,\n\nDistrict Bhind.\n\n2. It appears that the applicants are facing trial for offence under\n\nSection 4\nof Dowry Prohibition Act. The complainant lodged an FIR\n\non 22/2/2018 alleging that on 16/6/2017 the engagement of his\n\ndaughter took place with applicant no.4, but since the complainant\n\nwas not in a position to fulfill the dowry demand of the applicants,\n\ntherefore, the marriage was cancelled. It was alleged that the\n\napplicant no.4 was in government job and at the time of settlement of\n\nmarriage, the applicant had demanded Rs.5,00,000/- in cash as well\n\nas one bullet motorcycle, apart from other household articles and the\n\ncomplainant had agreed to give the same. The engagement was\n\nsolemnized on 16/6/2017 by exchanging rings in the Pavai Mata\n\nTemple. On 26/6/2017 God Bharai rituals were fulfilled and a gold\n\nring of Rs.15,000/- was given to applicant no.4, whereas the\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\napplicants gave a pair of silver nose ring, Salvar suit as well as\n\nSarees to his daughter. The complainant had also given an amount of\n\nRs.51,000/- in cash and Rs.2,100/- alongwith the clothes to the\n\nfamily members of the applicant at the time of Vidai. Subh Muhurt\n\nfor the marriage of the daughter of the applicant was 5/7/2018 and\n\naccordingly, an invitation in the form of Peeli Chitthi was sent to the\n\napplicants on 16/1/2018 through his son, but the applicants did not\n\naccept the Peeli Chitthi and insisted that a swift car, gold ornaments\n\nof 10 tola to the bride as well as an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- be given\n\nin cash. Further, it was said that in case if the complainant is ready to\n\ngive the aforesaid articles and money, then he should resend the Peeli\n\nChitthi, otherwise they would get applicant no.4 married to\n\nsomebody else. Since the complainant was not in a position to give a\n\nswift car, cash amount of Rs.5,00,000/- and gold jewelry of 10 tolas,\n\ntherefore, the applicants have broken the marriage, as a result, the\n\ncomplainant and his daughter have been defamed in the society.\n\n3. Challenging the FIR as well as the criminal prosecution it is\n\nsubmitted by the counsel for the applicant that although all the\n\nwitnesses in their ocular statements have repeated the allegations\n\nmade in the FIR, but their ocular statements are contrary to the Peeli\n\nChitthi which was seized and is a part of the charge-sheet. It is\n\nsubmitted that from the Peeli Chitthi it is clear that it was not meant\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nfor the applicant no.4 as well as the daughter of the complainant and\n\nwhen the ocular statements are not supported by documentary\n\nstatements, then the ocular statements should be disbelived and the\n\ncharge-sheet should be quashed. In support of his contentions, the\n\ncounsel for the applicant has relied upon the judgment passed by the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.\n\nVs. State of Maharasthra and others reported in SCC OnLine SC\n\n315.\n\n4. Per contra, the application is vehemently opposed by the\n\ncounsel for the State. It is submitted that while exercising the power\n\nunder\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. High Court cannot appreciate the\n\nevidence and the power can be exercised only when no offence is\n\nmade out, even if the entire allegations made against the accused are\n\naccepted in toto.\n\n5. Heard learned counsel for the partis.\n\n6. The solitary argument of the applicant is that since the Peeli\n\nChitthi which has been filed alongwith the charge-sheet does not\n\nrelate to the applicant no.4 and the daughter of the complainant,\n\ntherefore, the allegations made in the FIR as well as ocular\n\nstatements of the witnesses must be disbelieved. The Supreme Court\n\nin the case of M/s Neeharika Infrastructure (supra) has held as\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nunder:-\n\n34. While considering the aforesaid issue, law on the\nexercise of powers by the High Court under Section\n482 Cr.P.C. and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution\nof India to quash the FIR/complaint and the parameters\nfor exercise of such powers and scope and ambit of the\npower by the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\nand/or under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India are\nrequired to be referred to as the very parameters which\nare required to be applied while quashing the FIR will\nalso be applicable while granting interim\nstay/protection.\n\n35. The first case on the point which is required to be\nnoticed is the decision of this Court in the case of R.P.\nKapur (supra). While dealing with the inherent powers\nof the High Court under Section 561-A of the earlier\nCode (which is pari materia with Section 482 of the\nCode), it is observed and held that the inherent powers\nof the High Court under Section 561 of the earlier Code\ncannot be exercised in regard to the matters specifically\ncovered by the other provisions of the Code; the\ninherent jurisdiction of the High Court can be exercised\nto quash proceedings in a proper case either to prevent\nthe abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to\nsecure the ends of justice; ordinarily criminal\nproceedings instituted against an accused person must\nbe tried under the provisions of the Code, and the High\nCourt would be reluctant to interfere with the said\nproceedings at an interlocutory stage. After observing\nthis, thereafter this Court then carved out some\nexceptions to the above-stated rule, which are as under:\n\n\"(i) Where it manifestly appears that there is a legal\nbar against the institution or continuance of the\ncriminal proceeding in respect of the offence alleged.\n\nAbsence of\nthe requisite sanction may, for instance, furnish cases\nunder this category.\n\n(ii) Where the allegations in the first information\nreport or the complaint, even if they are taken at their\nface value and accepted in their entirety, do not\nconstitute the offence alleged; in such cases no\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nquestion of appreciating evidence arises; it is a\nmatter merely of looking at the complaint or the first\ninformation report to decide whether the offence\nalleged is disclosed or not.\n\n(iii) Where the allegations made against the accused\nperson do constitute an offence alleged but there is\neither no legal evidence adduced in support of the\ncase or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly\nfails to prove the charge. In dealing with this class of\ncases it is important to bear in mind the distinction\nbetween a case where there is no legal evidence or\nwhere there is evidence which is manifestly and\nclearly inconsistent with the accusation made and\ncases where there is legal\nevidence which on its appreciation may or may not\nsupport the accusation in question. In exercising its\njurisdiction under Section 561-A the High Court\nwould not embark upon an enquiry as to whether the\nevidence in question is reliable or not. That is the\nfunction of the trial Magistrate, and ordinarily it\nwould not be open to any party to invoke the High\nCourt's inherent jurisdiction and contend that on a\nreasonable appreciation of the evidence the\naccusation made against the accused would not be\nsustained.\"\n\n36. In the case of Kurukshetra University (supra), this\nCourt observed and held that inherent powers under\n\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. do not confer an arbitrary\njurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim\nor caprice; that statutory power has to be exercised\nsparingly with circumspection and in the rarest of rare\ncases. In the case before this Court, the High Court\nquashed the first information report filed by the\nKurukshetra University through Warden and that too\nwithout issuing notice to the University, in exercise of\ninherent powers under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. This Court\nnoticed and observed that the High Court was not\njustified in quashing the FIR when thepolice had not\neven commenced investigation into the complaint filed\nby the Warden of the University and no proceedings\nwere at all pending before any Court in pursuance of\nthe FIR.\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n37. Then comes the celebrated decision of this Court in\nthe case of Bhajan Lal (supra). In the said decision, this\nCourt considered in detail the scope of the High Court\npowers under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. and/or\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution of India to quash the FIR and referred\nto several judicial precedents and held that the High\nCourt should not embark upon an inquiry into the\nmerits and demerits of the allegations and quash the\nproceedings without allowing the investigating agency\nto complete its task. At the same time, this Court\nidentified the following cases in which FIR/complaint\ncan be quashed:\n\n\"102.(1) Where the allegations made in the first\ninformation report or the complaint, even if they are\ntaken at their face value and accepted in their entirety\ndo not prima facie constitute any offence or make out\na case against the accused.\n\n(2) Where the allegations in the first information\nreport and other materials, if any, accompanying the\nFIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying\nan investigation by police officers under Section\n156(1) of the Code except under an order of a\nMagistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of\nthe Code.\n\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the\nFIR or complaint and the evidence collected in\nsupport of the same do not disclose the commission\nof any offence and make out a case against the\naccused.\n\n(4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute\na cognizable offence but constitute only a non-\n\ncognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a\npolice officer without an order of a Magistrate as\ncontemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or\ncomplaint are so absurd and inherently improbable\non the basis of which no prudent person can ever\nreach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground\nfor proceeding against the accused.\n\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in\nany of the provisions of the Code or the Act\nconcerned (under which a criminal proceeding is\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\ninstituted) to the institution and continuance of the\nproceedings and/or where there is a specific\nprovision in the Code or the Act concerned,\nproviding efficacious redress for the grievance of the\naggrieved party.\n\n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly\nattended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding\nis maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for\nwreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view\nto spite him due to private and personal grudge.\"\n\n38. In the case of Golconda Lingaswamy (supra), after\nconsidering the decisions of this Court in the cases of\nR.P. Kapur (supra) and Bhajan Lal (supra) and other\ndecisions on the exercise of inherent powers by the\nHigh Court under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C., in paragraphs 5,\n7 and 8, it is observed and held as under:\n\n\"5. Exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code in\na case of this nature is the exception and not the rule.\nThe section does not confer any new powers on the\nHigh Court. It only saves the inherent power which the\nCourt possessed before the enactment of the Code. It\nenvisages three circumstances under which the inherent\njurisdiction may be exercised, namely : (i) to give effect\nto an order under the Code, (ii) to prevent abuse of the\nprocess of court, and (iii) to otherwise secure the ends\nof justice. It is neither possible nor desirable to lay\ndown any inflexible rule which would govern the\nexercise of inherent jurisdiction. No legislative\nenactment dealing with procedure can provide for all\ncases that may possibly arise. Courts, therefore, have\ninherent powers apart from express provisions of law\nwhich are necessary for proper discharge of functions\nand duties imposed upon them by law. That is the\ndoctrine which finds expression in the section which\nmerely recognises and preserves inherent powers of the\nHigh Courts. All courts, whether civil or criminal,\npossess in the absence of any express provision, as\ninherent in their constitution, all such powers as are\nnecessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course\nof administration of justice on the principle quando lex\naliquid alique concedit, conceditur et id sine quo res\nipsa esse non potest (when the law gives a person\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nanything, it gives him that without which it cannot\nexist). While exercising powers under the section, the\nCourt does not function as a court of appeal or revision.\n\nInherent jurisdiction under the section though wide has\nto be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution\nand only when such exercise is justified by the tests\nspecifically laid down in the section itself. It is to be\nexercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial\njustice for the administration of which alone courts\nexist. Authority of the court exists for advancement of\njustice and if any attempt is made to abuse that\nauthority so as to produce injustice, the court has power\nto prevent such abuse. It would be an abuse of the\nprocess of the court to allow any action which would\nresult in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In\nexercise of the powers court would be justified to quash\nany proceeding if it finds that initiation or continuance\nof it amounts to abuse of the process of court or\nquashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve\nthe ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed by the\ncomplaint, the court may examine the question of fact.\nWhen a complaint is sought to be quashed, it is\npermissible to look into the materials to assess what the\ncomplainant has alleged and whether any offence is\nmade out even if the allegations are accepted in toto.\n\n7. In dealing with the last category, it is important to\nbear in mind the distinction between a case where there\nis no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is\nclearly inconsistent with the accusations made, and a\ncase where there is legal evidence which, on\nappreciation, may or may not support the accusations.\nWhen exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the\nCode, the High Court would not ordinarily embark\nupon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is\nreliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation\nof it accusation would not be sustained. That is the\nfunction of the trial Judge. Judicial process, no doubt\nshould not be an instrument of oppression, or, needless\nharassment. Court should be circumspect and judicious\nin exercising discretion and should take all relevant\nfacts and circumstances into consideration before\nissuing process, lest it would be an instrument in the\nhands of a private complainant to unleash vendetta to\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nharass any person needlessly. At the same time the\nsection is not an instrument handed over to an accused\nto short-circuit a prosecution and bring about its sudden\ndeath..\n\n8. As noted above, the powers possessed by the High\nCourt under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and\nthe very plenitude of the power requires great caution in\nits exercise. Court must be careful to see that its\ndecision in exercise of this power is based on sound\nprinciples. The inherent power should not be exercised\nto stifle a legitimate prosecution. High Court being the\nhighest court of a State should normally refrain from\ngiving a prima facie decision in a case where the entire\nfacts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the\nevidence has not been collected and produced before\nthe Court and the issues involved, whether factual or\nlegal, are of magnitude and cannot be seen in their true\nperspective without sufficient material. Of course, no\nhard-and-fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in\nwhich the High Court will exercise its extraordinary\njurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any stage.\n\n[See\nJanata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary\n[(1992) 4 SCC\n305 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 36 : (1992) 4 SCC 305 : AIR\n1993 SC 892] and Raghubir Saran (Dr.) v. State of\nBihar [AIR 1964 SC 1 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ 1].] It would\nnot be proper for the High Court to analyse the case of\nthe complainant in the light of all probabilities in order\nto determine whether a conviction would be sustainable\nand on such premises, arrive at a conclusion that the\nproceedings are to be quashed. It would be erroneous to\nassess the material before it and conclude that the\ncomplaint cannot be proceeded with. In a proceeding\ninstituted on complaint, exercise of the inherent powers\nto quash the proceedings is called for only in a case\nwhere the complaint does not disclose any offence or is\nfrivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If the allegations set\nout in the complaint do not constitute the offence of\nwhich cognisance has been taken by the Magistrate, it is\nopen to the High Court to quash the same in exercise of\nthe inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code. It is\nnot, however, necessary that there should be meticulous\nanalysis of the case before the trial to find out whether\nthe case would end in conviction or acquittal.\nThe\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\ncomplaint/FIR has to be read as a whole. If it appears\nthat on consideration of the allegations in the light of\nthe statement made on oath of the complainant or\ndisclosed in the FIR that the ingredients of the offence\nor offences are disclosed and there is no material to\nshow that the complaint/FIR is mala fide, frivolous or\nvexatious, in that event there would be no justification\nfor interference by the High Court. When an\ninformation is lodged at the police station and an\noffence is registered, then the mala fides of the\ninformant would be of secondary importance. It is the\nmaterial collected during the investigation and evidence\nled in court which decides the fate of the accused\nperson. The allegations of mala fides against the\ninformant are of no consequence and cannot by\nthemselves be the basis for quashing the proceeding.\"\n\n39. In the case of Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd.\n(supra), in paragraph 11, this Court has observed and\nheld as under:\n\n\"11. ... the powers possessed by the High Court under\nSection 482 of the Code are very wide and the very\nplenitude of the power requires great caution in its\nexercise. Court must be careful to see that its decision\nin exercise of this power is based on sound principles.\nThe inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a\nlegitimate prosecution. The High Court being the\nhighest court of a State should normally refrain from\ngiving a prima facie decision in a case where the entire\nfacts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the\nevidence has not been collected and produced before\nthe court and the issues involved, whether factual or\nlegal, are of magnitude and cannot be seen in their true\nperspective without sufficient material. of course, no\nhard-and-fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in\nwhich the High Court will exercise its extraordinary\njurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any stage. It\nwould not be proper for the High Court to analyse the\ncase of the complainant in the light of all probabilities\nin order to determine whether a conviction would be\nsustainable and on such premise arrive at a conclusion\nthat the proceedings are to be quashed. It would be\nerroneous to assess the material before it and conclude\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nthat the complaint cannot be proceeded with. In a\nproceeding instituted on complaint, exercise of the\ninherent powers to quash the proceedings is called for\nonly in a case where the complaint does not disclose\nany offence or is frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If\nthe allegations set out in the complaint do not constitute\nthe offence of which cognizance has been taken by the\nMagistrate, it is open to the High Court to quash the\nsame in exercise of the inherent powers under Section\n482 of the Code. It is not, however, necessary that there\nshould be meticulous analysis of the case before the\ntrial to find out whether the case would end in\nconviction or acquittal. The complaint has to be read as\na whole. If it appears that on consideration of the\nallegations in the light of the statement made on oath of\nthe complainant that the ingredients of the offence or\noffences are disclosed and there is no material to show\nthat the complaint is mala fide, frivolous or vexatious,\nin that event there would be no justification for\ninterference by the High Court. When an information is\nlodged at the police station and an offence is registered,\nthen the mala fides of the informant would be of\nsecondary importance. It is the material collected\nduring the investigation and evidence led in court\nwhich decides the fate of the accused person. The\nallegations of mala fides against the informant are of no\nconsequence and cannot by themselves be the basis for\nquashing the proceedings.\"\n\n40. In the case of Sanapareddy Maheedhar Seshagiri\n(supra), in paragraph 31, it is observed and held as\nunder:\n\n\"31. A careful reading of the abovenoted judgments\nmakes it clear that the High Court should be\nextremely cautious and slow to interfere with the\ninvestigation and/or trial of criminal cases and\nshould not stall the investigation and/or prosecution\nexcept when it is convinced beyond any manner of\ndoubt that FIR does not disclose commission of any\noffence or that the allegations contained in FIR do\nnot constitute any cognizable offence or that the\nprosecution is barred by law or the High Court is\nconvinced that it is necessary to interfere to prevent\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nabuse of the process of the Court. In dealing with\nsuch cases, the High Court has to bear in mind that\njudicial intervention at the threshold of the legal\nprocess initiated against a person accused of\ncommitting offence is highly detrimental to the\nlarger public and societal interest. The people and\nthe society have a legitimate expectation that those\ncommitting offences either against an individual or\nthe society are expeditiously brought to trial and, if\nfound guilty, adequately punished. Therefore, while\ndeciding a petition filed for quashing FIR or\ncomplaint or restraining the competent authority\nfrom investigating the allegations contained in FIR\nor complaint or for stalling the trial of the case, the\nHigh Court should be extremely careful and\ncircumspect. If the allegations contained in FIR or\ncomplaint disclose commission of some crime, then\nthe High Court must keep its hands off and allow\nthe investigating agency to complete the\ninvestigation without any fetter and also refrain\nfrom passing order which may impede the trial. The\nHigh Court should not go into the merits and\ndemerits of the allegations simply because the\npetitioner alleges malus animus against the author\nof FIR or the complainant. The High Court must\nalso refrain from making imaginary journey in the\nrealm of possible harassment which may be caused\nto the petitioner on account of investigation of FIR\nor complaint. Such a course will result in\nmiscarriage of justice and would encourage those\naccused of committing crimes to repeat the same.\nHowever, if the High Court is satisfied that the\ncomplaint does not disclose commission of any\noffence or prosecution is barred by limitation or that\nthe proceedings of criminal case would result in\nfailure of justice, then it may exercise inherent\npower under\nSection 482\nCrPC.\"\n\n41. In the case of Arun Gulab Gawali (supra), this\nCourt set aside the order passed by the High Court\nquashing the criminal complaint/FIR which was even\nfiled by the complainant. In the case before this Court,\nprayer for quashing the FIR before the High Court was\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nby the complainant himself and the High Court quashed\nthe FIR/complaint in exercise of the powers under\n\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. Quashing and setting aside the\njudgment and order passed by the High Court quashing\nthe FIR, this Court in paragraphs 13 and 27 to 29 has\nobserved as under:\n\n\"13. The power of quashing criminal proceedings\nhas to be exercised very sparingly and with\ncircumspection and that too in the rarest of rare\ncases and the Court cannot be justified in\nembarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or\ngenuineness or otherwise of allegations made in the\nFIR/complaint, unless the allegations are so patently\nabsurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent\nperson can ever reach such a conclusion. The\nextraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do\nnot confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to\nact according to its whims or caprice. However, the\nCourt, under its inherent powers, can neither\nintervene at an uncalled for stage nor can it \"soft-\npedal the course of justice\" at a crucial stage of\ninvestigation/proceedings. The provisions of\n\nArticles 226\n, 227\nof the Constitution of India and\n\nSection 482\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973 (hereinafter called as \"\nCrPC\n\") are a device to\nadvance justice and not to frustrate it. The power of\njudicial review is discretionary, however, it must be\nexercised to prevent the miscarriage of justice and\nfor correcting some grave errors and to ensure that\nstream of administration of justice remains clean\nand pure. However, there are no limits of power of\nthe Court, but the more the power, the more due\ncare and caution is to be exercised in invoking these\npowers. (\nVide State of W.B. v. Swapan Kumar Guha\n\n[(1982) 1 SCC 561 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 283 : (1982) 1\nSCC 561 :\nAIR 1982 SC 949], Pepsi Foods Ltd. v.\nSpecial Judicial Magistrate\n[(1998) 5 SCC 749 :\n\n1998 SCC (Cri) 1400], G. Sagar Suri v. State of\nU.P. [(2000) 2 SCC 636 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 513 :\n(2000) 2 SCC 636 : AIR 2000 SC 754] and Ajay\nMitra v. State of M.P. [(2003) 3 SCC 11 : 2003 SCC\n(Cri) 703]) xxx xxx xxx\n\n27. The High Court proceeded on the perception\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nthat as the complainant himself was not supporting\nthe complaint, he would not support the case of the\nprosecution and there would be no chance of\nconviction, thus the trial itself would be a futile\nexercise. Quashing of FIR/complaint on such a\nground cannot be held to be justified in law.\n\nOrdinarily, the Court of Session is empowered to\ndischarge an accused under\nSection 227\nCrPC even\nbefore initiating the trial. The accused can,\ntherefore, move the trial court itself for such a relief\nand the trial court would be in a better position to\nanalyse and pass an order as it is possessed of all\nthe powers and the material to do so. It is, therefore,\nnot necessary to invoke the jurisdiction under\n\nSection 482\nCrPC for the quashing of a prosecution\nin such a case. The reliance on affidavits by the\nHigh Court would be a weak, hazy and unreliable\nsource for adjudication on the fate of a trial. The\npresumption that an accused would never be\nconvicted on the material available is too risky a\nproposition to be accepted readily, particularly in\nheinous offences like extortion.\n\n28. A claim founded on a denial by the complainant\neven before the trial commences coupled with an\nallegation that the police had compelled the lodging\nof a false FIR, is a matter which requires further\ninvestigation as the charge is levelled against the\npolice. If the prosecution is quashed, then neither\nthe trial court nor the investigating agency has any\nopportunity to go into this question, which may\nrequire consideration. The State is the prosecutor\nand all prosecution is the social and legal\nresponsibility of the State. An offence committed is\na crime against society and not against the victim\nalone. The victim under undue pressure or influence\nof the accused or under any threat or compulsion\nmay resile back but that would not absolve the State\nfrom bringing the accused to book, who has\ncommitted an offence and has violated the law of\nthe land.\n\n29. Thus, while exercising such power the Court has\nto act cautiously before proceeding to quash a\nprosecution in respect of an offence which hits and\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\naffects the society at large. It should be a case where\nno other view is possible nor any investigation or\ninquiry is further required. There cannot be a\ngeneral proposition of law, so as to fit in as a\nstraitjacket formula for the exercise of such power.\nEach case will have to be judged on its own merit\nand the facts warranting exercise of such power.\nMore so, it was not a case of civil nature where\nthere could be a possibility of compromise or\ninvolving an offence which may be compoundable\nunder\nSection 320\nCrPC, where the Court could\napply the ratio of Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia\n[(1988) 1 SCC 692 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 234 : (1988) 1\nSCC 692 : AIR 1988 SC 709].\"\n\n42. Thereafter in catena of decisions, this Court has\nreiterated the parameters for exercise of inherent\npowers under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. and/or under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India in the matter of\nquashing the FIR/complaint.\n\n51.\nIn the case of\nUjjal Kumar Burdhan\n(supra), it is\nobserved and held by this Court that unless case of\ngross abuse of power is made out against those in\ncharge of investigation, the High Court should be loath\nto interfere at early/premature stage of investigation.\n\n52.\nIn the case of\nSatvinder Kaur v. State (Govt. of NCT\nof Delhi\n), (1999) 8 SCC 728, in paragraphs 14 to 16, it\nis observed and held as under:\n\n\"14. Further, the legal position is well settled that if\nan offence is disclosed the court will not normally\ninterfere with an investigation into the case and will\npermit investigation into the offence alleged to be\ncompleted. If the FIR, prima facie, discloses the\ncommission of an offence, the court does not\nnormally stop the investigation, for, to do so would\nbe to trench upon the lawful power of the police to\ninvestigate into cognizable offences. [\nState of W.B.\nv. Swapan Kumar Guha\n, (1982) 1 SCC 561 : 1982\nSCC (Cri) 283] It is also settled by a long course of\ndecisions of this Court that for the purpose of\nexercising its power under\nSection 482\nCrPC to\nquash an FIR or a complaint, the High Court would\nhave to proceed entirely on the basis of the\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nallegations made in the complaint or the documents\naccompanying the same per se; it has no jurisdiction\nto examine the correctness or otherwise of the\nallegations.\n\n[\nPratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar\n, (1985)\n2 SCC 370, 395 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 180]\n\n15. Hence, in the present case, the High Court\ncommitted a grave error in accepting the contention\nof the respondent that the investigating officer had\nno jurisdiction to investigate the matters on the\nalleged ground that no part of the offence was\ncommitted within the territorial jurisdiction of the\npolice station at Delhi. The appreciation of the\nevidence is the function of the courts when seized\nof the matter. At the stage of investigation, the\nmaterial collected by an investigating officer cannot\nbe judicially scrutinized for arriving at a conclusion\nthat the police station officer of a particular police\nstation would not have territorial jurisdiction. In\nany case, it has to be stated that in view of\nSection\n178(c)\nof the Criminal Procedure Code, when it is\nuncertain in which of the several local areas an\noffence was committed, or where it consists of\nseveral acts done in different local areas, the said\noffence can be enquired into or tried by a court\nhaving jurisdiction over any of such local areas.\nTherefore, to say at the stage of investigation that\nthe SHO, Police Station Paschim Vihar, New Delhi\nwas not having territorial jurisdiction, is on the face\nof it, illegal and erroneous. That apart, Section\n156(2) contains an embargo that no proceeding of a\npolice officer shall be challenged on the ground that\nhe has no territorial power to investigate. The High\nCourt has completely overlooked the said embargo\nwhen it entertained the petition of Respondent 2 on\nthe ground of want of territorial jurisdiction.\n\n16. Lastly, it is required to be reiterated that while\nexercising the jurisdiction under\nSection 482\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Code of quashing an\ninvestigation, the court should bear in mind what\nhas been observed in the\nState of Kerala v. O.C.\nKuttan\n[(1999) 2 SCC 651 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 304 :\n\nJT (1999) 1 SC 486] to the following effect : (SCC\npp. 654-55, para 6) \"Having said so, the Court gave\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\na note of caution to the effect that the power of\nquashing the criminal proceedings should be\nexercised very sparingly with circumspection and\nthat too in the rarest of rare cases; that the court will\nnot be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to\nthe reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the\nallegations made in the FIR or the complaint and\nthat the extraordinary or inherent powers do not\nconfer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act\naccording to its whim or caprice. It is too well\nsettled that the first information report is only an\ninitiation to move the machinery and to investigate\ninto a cognizable offence and, therefore, while\nexercising the power and deciding\nwhether the investigation itself should be quashed,\nutmost care should be taken by the court and at that\nstage, it is not possible for the court to sift the\nmaterials or to weigh the materials and then come to\nthe conclusion one way or the other.\nIn the case of\n\nState of U.P. v. O.P. Sharma\n[(1996) 7 SCC 705 :\n1996 SCC (Cri) 497 : JT (1996) 2 SC 488] a three-\nJudge Bench of this Court indicated that the High\nCourt should be loath to interfere at the threshold to\nthwart the prosecution exercising its inherent power\nunder Section 482 or under\nArticles 226\nand\nof\nthe Constitution of India, as the case may be, and\nallow the law to take its own course.\n\nThe same view\nwas reiterated by yet another three-Judge Bench of\nthis Court in the case of\nRashmi Kumar v. Mahesh\nKumar Bhada\n[(1997) 2 SCC 397 : 1997 SCC (Cri)\n415 : JT (1996) 11 SC 175] where this Court\nsounded a word of caution and stated that such\npower should be sparingly and cautiously exercised\nonly when the court is of the opinion that otherwise\nthere will be gross miscarriage of justice. The Court\nhad also observed that social stability and order is\nrequired to be regulated by proceeding against the\noffender as it is an offence against society as a\nwhole.\"\n\n7. Thus, it is clear that this Court while exercising power under\n\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. cannot look into the reliability and credibility\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nof the evidence relied upon by the prosecution.\n\n8. In the present case, it is not the case of the applicants that they\n\nwere ready to marry the daughter of the complainant. The only\n\ncontention of the counsel for the applicants is that since the Peeli\n\nChitthi was not meant for the applicant no.4 and the daughter of the\n\ncomplainant, therefore, the allegations of breaking the marriage on\n\naccount of additional demand cannot be relied upon, is beyond the\n\nscope of power under\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. Whether the ocular\n\nstatement is to be believed or the Peeli Chitthi is to be believed or\n\ndiscarded, is a matter which is to be considered and decided by the\n\nTrial Court after recording the evidence.\n\n9. As the allegations made in the FIR make out a prima facie case\n\nwarranting prosecution of the applicants, accordingly, the application\n\nunder\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIR in Crime\n\nNo.54/2018 registered at Police Station Gormi, District Bhind as well\n\nas for quashing the further proceedings in RCT No.290/2018 pending\n\nin the Court of JMFC, Mehgaon, District Bhind fails and is hereby\n\ndismissed.\n\n(G.S.
