Justice Rajani Dubey\n CAV Order\n\n1. Since the petitioners in the aforesaid petitions are working in the\n same office and filed the petitions with regard to their seniority and\n promotion, they are being heard and decided by this common\n order.\n\n2. In WPS No. 885 of 2015- By way of the instant petition, the\n petitioner- Prateek Khare is challenging the legality, validity and\n proprietary of the order dated 04.03.2015 (Annexure P/1) and\n 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) passed by the State Government,\n whereby the objection raised by the petitioner in respect of\n provisional gradation list of Joint Director issued on 25.10.2007\n and 22.11.2010 has been turned down.\n\n3. Brief facts of the case as mentioned in WPS No. 885/2015 are that\n the petitioner- Prateek Khare is holding the post of joint Director\n and at present posted as Secretary, State Commission for\n protection of Child Rights. The petitioner was initially appointed on\n the post of District Women & Child Development officer vide order\n dated 18.05.1995 (Annexure P/3) and thereafter he was promoted\n on the post of Deputy Director on 25.04.1998 (Annexure P/4) and\n he was further promoted on the post of Joint Director vide order\n dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5) and is entitled for further\n promotion to the post of Additional Director. The petitioner and\n respondents No. 5 & 6 were promoted on the post of Deputy\n Director vide order dated 25.04.1998 and they were further\n promoted on the post of Joint Director vide order dated\n 27.05.2006. in the year 2005 three posts of Joint Directors were\n sanctioned and all 3 posts were lying vacant. The case of the\n petitioner and respondents No. 5 & 6 was recommended by the\n Department for promotion to the post of Joint Director. The\n Departmental Promotion Committee was convened on 21.11.2005\n for promotion of Deputy Director to the post of Joint Director. On\n the basis of the overall services records, the petitioner was graded\n by the Departmental Promotion Committee as Outstanding and\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 4\n\n respondents No. 5 & 6 were graded by the Departmental\n Promotion Committee as Very-Good and according to Rule 7.9 of\n promotion Rules of 2003, the petitioner was placed at serial No.1\n and the respondents no 5 & 6 were placed at serial Nos. 2 & 3.\n The copy of the Departmental Promotion Committee proceedings\n is annexed as Annexure P/6. The General Administration\n Department in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to\n \nArticle 309\n read with \nArticles 16\n and \n335\n of the Constitution of\n India has made the rules known as Chhattisgarh Public Services\n (Promotion) Rules, 2003, Rule 7 of the said Rules deals with\n promotion on the basis of merit-cum-seniority.\n\n4. The promotion order was issued on 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5)\n and the petitioner was placed at serial No. 1 i.e. in the same order\n of merit determined by the Departmental Promotion Committee.\n On 25.10.2007 (Annexure P/9), first time the provisional gradation\n list showing the position as on 01.04.2007 of Joint Directors\n Women & Child Welfare Department was published and the\n objections were invited. In the said gradation list, petitioner was\n placed at serial No.3 and respondents No. 5 & 6 were placed\n above the petitioner ignoring the order of merit determined by\n Departmental Promotion Committee on the basis of overall merit.\n On 03.11.2007, the petitioner made first representation for\n correction of his position. On 17.12.2009, second representation\n was made, on 21.12.2009, third representation was made, further\n on 30.12.2009 and thereafter on 22.11.2010 the last\n representation was made. From 2007 to 2010, the final gradation\n list was not published and the objection of the petitioner was not\n decided. Copy of the representations of the petitioner dated\n 03.11.2007, 17.12.2009, 21.12.2009, 30.12.2009 & 22.11.2010 is\n annexed as Annexure P/10 (Colly). Again on 22.11.2010, the\n provisional gradation lists were issued showing the position as on\n 01.04.2008 to 01.04.2010 and again the petitioner was placed at\n serial No.3 below the respondents No. 5 & 6. Petitioner made\n representation/objection dated 02.12.2010 and reminder on\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 5\n\n 12.10.2012.\n\n5. The State Government vide its order dated 30.05.2013 (Annexure\n P/2), rejected the representation without considering the grounds\n agitated by the petitioner and while rejecting the representation it\n was held that the provisions of General conditions of Service\n Rules, 1961 would not be applicable, because the promotions\n were made under the Promotion Rules of 2003. The petitioner\n again requested the authorities to review the order dated\n 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2). The review application has been\n rejected on 04.03.2015 and final gradation list was issued on\n 07.03.2015 (Annexure P/14) and again the petitioner has been\n placed at serial No.3. The petitioner made a representation to the\n department and thereafter filed a petition before this Court which\n was registered as W.P.(S) No. 4075/2014 (Annexure P/15) and the\n same was disposed of on 21.11.2014 with certain direction.\n Department is going to convey the Departmental Promotion\n Committee for the post of Additional Director and with malafide\n intention after near about 7 years and the final gradation list has\n been published ignoring the rules of 2003 and the rules of 1961.\n Hence, this petition has been filed by the petitioner- Prateek Khare\n for the following reliefs:-\n\n 1] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n issue a writ/writs, order/orders, direction/directions\n quashing the impugned orders dated 04.03.2015\n (Annexure P/1) and 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) and the\n respondents No. 1 & 2 may kindly be directed to place\n the petitioner in the gradation list of Joint Directors, in\n the same order of merit determined by the\n Departmental Promotion Committee in its meeting held\n on 21.11.2005.\n\n 2] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n grant any other relief(s), which is deemed fit and proper\n and the respondents may kindly be directed to place\n the petitioner at serial No.1 in the gradation list of Joint\n Neutral Citation\n 2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 6\n\n Directors Women & Child Welfare Department and only\n thereafter, initiated the proceedings for promotion of\n Joint Directors to the post of Additional Director.\n\n 3] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n issue awrit/writs, order/orders, direction/directions and\n the respondent No. 1 & 2 may kindly be directed to\n issue the fresh gradation list of Joint Directors cadre.\n\n 4] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n issue a direction to the Secretary, General\n Administration Department to hold an enquiry in respect\n of above mentioned entire matter.\n\n6. In WPS No. 5603 of 2017- The instant petition is filed by the\n petitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey against the promotion\n granted to respondent No.3 way back in the year 2006 on the post\n of Joint Director in Women & Child Development department.\n\n7. Brief facts of the case as mentioned in WPS No. 5603/2017 are\n that the petitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey was appointed on\n the post of District Women & Child Development Officer on\n 03.09.1995. Thereafter, he was promoted on the post of Deputy\n Director on 25.04.1998. The State of Chhattisgarh in the year\n 2005 considered the names of Deputy Directors for promotion to\n the post of Joint Director in Women and Child Welfare department.\n\n As per the gradation list issued on 01.04.2004 the petitioner was\n placed at serial number 3 from the top of the seniority list of\n District Programme Officer/Deputy Director. Smt. Archana Seth\n and Smt. C.S. Lal were over and above in the seniority list of the\n petitioner whereas Shri Prateek Khare was junior to the petitioner\n in the gradation list. The promotion was to be made under\n Chhattisgarh Women and Child Welfare (Gazetted) Service\n Recruitment Rules, 1990 read with Chhattisgarh Civil Services\n Promotion Rules, 2003. In the year 2005, total 3 posts were\n vacant against which the names of the petitioner and other Deputy\n Directors were to be considered. Out of 3 posts, 2 posts were\n meant for unreserved category and one post was meant for\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 7\n\n Scheduled Tribes candidate. DPC was convened on 21.11.2005 in\n which the name of petitioner was under the zone of consideration\n as he cleared the minimum standard required for to be considered\n on merits for the purposes of promotion. As per the annual\n confidential reports of the petitioner, he was graded as very good\n and his junior namely Prateek Khare was graded as outstanding\n and, therefore he was considered as preferably more meritorious\n than the candidature of the petitioner while granting promotion to\n the post of Joint Director. Thus, respondent No.3 was promoted to\n the post of Joint Director vide order dated 07.05.2006 (Annexure\n P/1) whereby the seniority of the petitioner was overlooked as Mr.\n Prateek Khare superseded the petitioner in the matter of granting\n promotion. The other seniors namely Smt. Archana Rana Seth\n and Smt. C.S. Lal sought information from the respondent\n department as to how the seniority is granted to Prateek Khare\n over and above them. They sought information under \nRTI Act\n as\n well as from other sources about the grading given to the private\n respondent in his annual confidential reports. The petitioner and\n other employees were thus superseded in promotion as well as\n seniority. But for a fairly longer period no information about Shri\n Khare or about the minutes of the Departmental Promotion\n committee meeting was ever given to the information seekers.\n Copies of Communications are annexed as Annexure P/2 & Copy\n of Gradation list is annexed as Annexure P/3. In the month of\n September 2017, the petitioner was given the copy of minutes of\n meeting held on 21.11.2005 wherein his name was under\n\n consideration for promotion to the post of Joint Director. Copy of\n minutes of meeting is annexed as Annexure P/4. It is clear from\n the minutes of the meeting that for promotion on the post of Joint\n Director, 3 posts were vacant and for which the names of 6 Deputy\n directors were under consideration. Out of 6, the names of Shri\n Dildar Singh Maravi and Smt. Preeti Khokar was not considered.\n The name of petitioner was under consideration and the average\n valuation was mentioned as very good but the committee refused\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 8\n\n to recommend the name of the petitioner because the requisite\n numbers of officers were already available. I\n\n8. Shri Prateek Khare was given remark as outstanding and found\n suitable for promotion. But in the bottom note it is mentioned that\n for the year 2001 there are 2 different annual confidential reports\n for a single year. For 7 and a half months, the grade of respondent\n No. 3 was A+ and for next 4 and a half months, his grade was C. It\n is clear that the average of A+ and C will be B which is below the\n standard benchmark required as per rule 7 (4) of Chhattisgarh\n Civil Services Promotion Rules, 2003 required for consideration of\n promotion on merit-cum-seniority basis. Therefore, Shri Prateek\n Khare is out of the consideration zone on the date of DPC yet the\n DPC recommended the name of respondent no.3 for promotion\n quoting his grading as outstanding and also placing him over and\n above his seniors in the gradation list of Joint Director. Hence, this\n petition has been filed by the petitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey\n for the following reliefs:-\n\n 10.1. That all the records pertaining to the\n Departmental Promotion Committee meeting\n held in year 2005 and the Annual Confidential\n Reports with respect to Petitioner and\n Respondent no.3 for granting promotion to the\n post of Joint Director, Woman and Child Welfare\n department may be requisitioned for kind per\n usual of this Hon'ble Court.\n\n 10.2 That the promotion order dated 27.05.2006\n granting promotion to respondent no.3 to the\n post of Joint Director, Woman and Child Welfare\n Department may be set aside/quashed and\n Respondent no.1 may be directed to conduct\n Review Departmental Promotion Committee\n meeting and petitioner may be considered for\n granting promotion with effect from 27.05.2006 to\n the post of Joint Director Women and Child\n Welfare Department along with all consequential\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 9\n\n benefits.\n\n 10.3. That respondent no.1 may be directed to\n conduct a full-fledged enquiry on the fraud\n committed by the then members of Departmental\n Promotion Committee and other responsible\n persons due to which errorneous and illegal\n promotion has been granted to respondent no.1.\n\n 10.4. That any other relief, which this Hon'ble\n Court may deem fit and proper together with the\n cost of the petition.\n\n9. In WPS No. 885/2015, learned counsel for the petitioner submits\n that the impugned orders are illegal erroneous and contrary to law.\n While rejecting the objection of the petitioner, the Rules of 2003\n and the General Condition of Service Rules 1961 were taken into\n consideration. The impugned orders have been passed without\n application of mind and without considering the grounds raised in\n the representations/objections. The authorities while rejecting the\n representation have failed to appreciate Rules 7(9) & 7(12) of\n promotion Rules 2003 and Rules 12(1)(b) of General Conditions of\n Service Rules 1961. The State Government grossly erred in\n placing the petitioner at serial No.3 contrary to the order of merit\n determined by the Departmental Promotion Committee and the\n promotion order passed by the department. The respondent\n authorities erred in rejecting the objection of the petitioner in\n holding that the general condition of service rules 1961 would not\n be applicable and the promotion Rules of 2003 would be\n applicable, but even the rules of 2003 have not been considered.\n Rules of 1961 are general service rules applicable undoubtedly as\n mentioned in the opinion sought by the department from the\n General Administration Department. With malafide intention the\n representation and review application have been rejected and final\n gradation list has been issued, so that the undue advantage can\n be given to private respondents. The petitioner has been deprived\n from his seniority. The representation of the petitioner was rejected\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 10\n\n without any speaking order, even the review has been rejected\n erroneously upholding the order dated 30.05.2013. Therefore, the\n impugned orders are liable to be set aside.\n\n10. Learned counsel for respondents No. 1, 2 & 4 strongly opposes\n the prayer of the petitioner and submits that the the petitioner has\n been appointed on the post of Assistant Director vide order dated\n 18.05.1995 whereas respondents No. 5 and 6 have been\n appointed to the post of Assistant Director vide order dated\n 29.06.1993. Thus, they are much seniors to the petitioner. The\n DPC held on 21.11.2005 has evaluated the overall performance of\n the employees, who were within the zone of consideration and\n accordingly they have been awarded the grading. The petitioner\n was found outstanding whereas the respondents No. 5 and 6 have\n been found very good and accordingly they have been promoted\n vide promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5). Grading of\n DPC and placing of employees in serial number in the promotion\n order cannot be made basis for seniority to the promoted post. In\n such a situation, the provisions contained in Rule 12(1)(c) of the\n Rules, 1961 will come into place. It is well settled principles of\n service law that where the promotions are made on the basis of\n merit-cum-seniority, the seniority of persons considered fit for\n promotion at the same time, shall be the same as the relative\n seniority in the lower grade from which they are promoted. From a\n bare perusal of the proceeding of the DPC dated 21.11.2005\n (Annexure P/6), it would be evident that if the promotions were\n made on the basis of the seniority subject to rejection of unfit and\n in such a case, in the relative seniority of Deputy Director, the\n petitioner was at serial No. 4 whereas respondents No. 5 and 6\n were at serial no. 1 and 2 respectively and therefore, after\n issuance of promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5),\n when the seniority list of Joint Director was published as on\n 01.04.2007, the petitioner was placed at serial No. 3 whereas\n respondents No. 5 and 6 have been placed at serial Nos. 1 and 2\n respectively. The representation of the petitioner was duly\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 11\n\n considered by the competent authority and as per promotion rules\n and service rules, representation was rejected by the competent\n authority. Therefore, the the petition is liable to be dismissed.\n\n11.Learned counsel for respondents No. 5 & 6 opposes the prayer of\n the petitioner and submits that the petition filed by the petitioner is\n not maintainable, since none of the rights of the petitioner has\n been violated. The petitioner had filed the instant writ petition\n being aggrieved by the impugned order for the reason that\n because of the impugned orders the chances of promotion of the\n petitioner to the next higher post of Additional Director would be\n adversely affected. It is a settled principle of law that no employee\n has a right of promotion, the only right which an employee has a\n right to be considered for promotion. The writ jurisdiction cannot\n be invoked merely on the ground that the chances of promotion in\n future are likely to be affected. The grant of promotion to the\n respondents or to the petitioner on the next higher post of\n Additional Director is contingent of several factors and events. In\n the instant case, the petitioner and other eligible employees are\n yet to be considered for promotion to the next higher post of\n Additional Director at this stage none of the rights of the petitioner\n has been violated. Hence, the instant petition is pre-mature and is\n liable to be dismissed in limine.\n\n12.In WPS No. 5603/2017, learned counsel for the petitioner submits\n that the impugned promotion order dated 07.05.2006 passed by\n respondent No.1 promoting respondent No.3 instead of petitioner\n is illegal, arbitrary and malafide. The respondent authorities were\n well aware about the contradictory entries made by the\n Department Promotion Committee with respect to granting of\n outstanding remark for respondent No.3, yet concealed the same\n for years together in order to deprive the other counterparts of\n respondent No.3 to illegally granted the benefit of promotion and\n seniority. The act on the part of respondent authorities amounts to\n fraud and malice in law in order to inflict injury upon the other\n employees and to favour respondent No.3. The petitioner was\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 12\n\n entitled for promotion as he duly fulfilled the required criteria for\n promotion to the post of Joint Director on the unreserved post. But\n his junior that is respondent No.3, was considered over and above\n the petitioner by denoting his outstanding performance despite\n contradictory entry in his ACR's. The promotion enjoyed by\n respondent No.3 for all these years will not accrue any right in his\n favour as the promotion itself was granted on basis of concealing\n actual entries and mistaken fact which has to be cured at some\n point of time. As the promotion granted to respondent No.3, in\n place of the petitioner is on misinterpretation of the entries made\n in his ACR's, which was concealed for years together from the\n public at large therefore, the promotion has to be quashed from\n the date it was granted. It is the prime duty of the state to review\n and apply it's mind upon the recommendation made by the Public\n Service Commission in the matters of promotion. In the present\n case the clearing illegality and contradiction in the DPC minutes is\n writ large the state cannot shut it's eyes ratify as mute spectator\n only because it is recommendation of PSC. State cannot without\n applying its mind accept the recommendation of the Public Service\n Commission howsoever erroneous it may be. Therefore,\n impugned order dated 27.05.2006 granting promotion to\n respondent No.3 is liable to be set aside.\n\n13. Learned counsel for respondents No. 1 & 2 strongly opposes the\n prayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner sought for\n quashment of promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/1)\n after inordinate delay of 11 years, therefore, this petition is liable to\n be dismissed on this ground alone. In DPC meeting dated\n 21.11.2005, the committee considered all aspects of promotion\n and recommended the name of officers for promotion and the\n respondents on the basis of recommendation, promoted the\n concerned officers and, therefore, this petition being without any\n substance is liable to be dismissed.\n\n14.Learned counsel for respondent No.3- Prateek Khare vehemently\n opposes the prayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 13\n\n has filed the instant petition after near about 12 years, therefore,\n the instant petition is liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay\n and laches. No explanation has been offered by the petitioner in\n his writ petition except that he was served with the copies of the\n Departmental Promotion Committee of 2005 in the month of\n September 2017. It is clear that the said application under the RTI\n itself was filed on 20.09.2017 i.e. after near about 11 years from\n the date of the order of promotion.\n\n15. The punishment of censure was imposed upon the petitioner and\n subsequently he made an appeal against the order of punishment\n and on 08.08.2005 (Annexure R.3/2), the said punishment was\n set-aside, thereafter the petitioner was granted the proforma\n promotion on the post of Deputy Director with effect from 1998\n subject to condition that he would be entitled for higher pay-scale\n only from the date of his joining on the post of Deputy Director. On\n 06.07.2005 (Annexure R.3/3), the petitioner along with the other\n employees made a representation to the department which itself\n shows that the petitioner was aware in respect of the ACRs as well\n as in respect of the promotion of the answering respondent. The\n identical issue raised by the other employee namely Smt. Archana\n Rana i.e. W.P.(S) No. 1988/2017 has already been dismissed and\n Writ Appeal No. 239/2017 is pending under consideration.\n Annexure R.3/4 is the copy of the order dated 27.04.2017.\n Subsequently, the Departmental Promotion Committee held on\n 21.11.2005 for consideration of the cases of Deputy Directors for\n promotion on the post of Joint Director. The petitioner along with\n the private respondents and other eligible Deputy Directors were\n considered for promotion on the post of Joint Director.\n\n16. The Departmental Promotion Committee shall make relative/\n comparative assessment of the merit of the public servants on the\n basis of their service records and placed them in the categories as\n outstanding, very good, average and poor as the case may be.\n However, only those public servants who were graded as very\n good and above, will be included in the select list by placing the\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 14\n\n public servants graded as outstanding on the top followed by\n those graded as very good subject to availability of vacancies.\n Respondent No.3 was graded as outstanding, therefore, he was\n placed on top and one Archana Rana who was graded as Very\n Good was placed at Serial No.2 and C.S. Lal who belonged to the\n Scheduled Tribe was considered against the third reserve post of\n Scheduled Tribe. The petitioner though was graded as Very Good\n but since he was junior to Archana Rana therefore, he was placed\n at serial No. 3 in the category of unreserved. This fact is apparent\n on the face of the minutes of meeting of the Departmental\n Promotion Committee held on 21.11.2005. Therefore, this petition\n is liable to be dismissed.\n\n17. Reliance has been placed on the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in the matter of \nUnion of India and another Vs. S.K. Goel\n and others\n reported in (\n2007) 14 SCC 641, Shiba Shankar\n Mohapatra and others Vs. State of Orissa and others\n reported\n in (2010) 12 SCC 471 and P.S. Sadasiv Aswamy Vs. State of\n Tamil Nadu reported in (1975) 1 SCC 152 & on the orders of\n Hon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh in the matter of Santosh\n Kumar Shrivastava Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, Through\n Additional Chief Secretary Water Resources Department and\n others in 2023 SCC OnLine MP 1614 & Rajendra Singh\n Kachwaha and another Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh Through\n Principal Secretary, Department of School Education and\n others in 2023 SCC OnLine MP 3642.\n\n18.Heard counsel for the parties and perused the material available\n on record.\n\n19. As regards WPS No. 5603/2017 filed by the petitioner- Surendra\n Kumar Choubey, it is clear that this petition is against promotion\n order dated 27.05.2006 and respondents No. 1, 2 and 3 strongly\n objected that this petition has been filed after 12 years of the\n impugned order. It is clear from WPS No. 1988/2017 that this writ\n was filed by Smt. Archana Rana and Smt. C.S. Lal and in the said\n Neutral Citation\n 2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 15\n\n petition, this Court observed in paras 2, 3 & 5 as under:-\n\n \"2. Since the petitioners were also promoted by the same order,\n as such they are not aggrieved by the entire order, however,\n according to the petitioners, respondent No.5 having been placed\n at serial No.1 in the order of promotion, he will have preference in\n consideration for promotion to the next higher post of Additional\n Director. It is put forth that at the time of consideration of the\n promotion in the year 2006, the ACRs of respondent No.5 were\n not good or not of such grade which would place him as an\n outstanding officer for placement at serial No.1 in the promotion\n order, therefore, he should not have been promoted.\n\n 3. In para 7 of the writ petition, the petitioners would submit that\n there is no delay in filing the instant writ petition because they\n were pursuing the cause bonafidely and diligently firstly by filing\n application under RTI seeking copies of the DPC proceedings,\n which was declined up to the State Information Commission.\n After supply of the copy, the petitioners have been continuously\n pursuing their cause by filing repeated representations. The\n department has drawn proceedings after the GAD and PSC have\n issued directions to the department, but nothing has been\n communicated apart from the assurance.\n\n 5. \nIn the matter of \nK.R. Mudgal & Ors. Vs. R.P. Singh & Ors.\n 1 and\n \nShiba Shankar Mohapatra & Ors. Vs. State of Orissa and Ors.\n 2,\n the Supreme Court has held that challenge to the seniority or\n promotion should be made within a reasonable time i.e. within a\n period of three to four years because after reasonable time the\n employees get settled in their cadre and their rights are\n crystallized.\"\n\n \n20. The writ appeal i.e. WA No. 239/2017 was dismissed as\n withdrawn vide order dated 10.02.2021, therefore, it is clear that\n two officers who were promoted with respondent No.3- Prateek\n Khare, filed writ petition against the same order which was\n dismissed on the ground of delay. The petitioner has filed the\n\n1\n\n (1986) 4 SCC 531\n\n2\n\n (2010) 12 SCC 471\n Neutral Citation\n 2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 16\n\n instant petition about 12 years of this order. Thus, in the light of\n previous orders of this Court and principles of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in the matters of \nK.R. Mudgal and others vs. R.P. Singh and\n others\n reported in (\n1986) 4 SCC 531 & Shiba Shankar Mohapatra\n and others Vs. State of Orissa and others\n reported in (2010) 12\n SCC 471, this writ petition No. 5603/2017 suffers from\n unexplained delay and laches and, therefore it deserves to be and\n is hereby dismissed on the ground of delay and laches.\n\n21. As regards WPS No. 885/2015, the petitioner has challenged the\n order dated 04.03.2015 (Annexure P/1) & 30.05.2013 (Annexure\n P/2) on the ground that DPC dated 21.11.2005, he was placed at\n serial No.1 in the seniority list at that time and now his seniority\n has been disturbed.\n\n22. In this case, the petitioner relied on promotion rules, respondents\n also quoted Rule 12 (1)(c) of the Rules, 1961 in their return.\n Respondents No. 5 & 6 also submits that the petitioner was junior\n to respondents No. 5 & 6. Respondents No. 5 & 6 made several\n representations (Annexure R-5/6) to respondents with regard to\n their seniority and promotion. As the petitioner was junior to\n respondents No. 5 & 6 therefore, he was rightly placed below the\n respondents in the gradation list. The State Government before\n passing the order dated 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) had granted\n sufficient opportunity to the petitioner and after considering the\n entire records and representation of the petitioner, passed the\n order in accordance with law. The order dated 30.05.2013\n (Annexure P/2) was passed by the respondent authorities after\n hearing all the affected parties and considering the relevant\n statutory provisions as well as the records of the case. The review\n application filed by the petitioner did not disclose any new ground\n which warranted the State Government to review its order dated\n 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2).\n\n23. It is clear that the Rule 2003 specially deals with the promotion.\n Annexure R-5/8 is the notification of Central Government dated\n Neutral Citation\n 2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 17\n\n 08.02.2002 which provides that order /list of promotion so issued\n merely reflects the preference tendered in granting promotion to\n the employees and it can never affect the gradation list of the\n employees.\n\n24. Rule 12(1)(c) of the Rules, 1961 provides as under:-\n\n \"12. Seniority - XXX XXX XXX\n\n (1) (a) XXX XXX XXX\n\n (b) XXX XXX XXX\n\n (c) Where promotions are made on the basis of the seniority\n subject to rejection of the unfit, the seniority of persons\n considered fit for promotion at the same time, shall be the same\n as the relative seniority in the lower grade from which they are\n promoted. Where, however, a person is considered as unfit for\n promotion and is superseded by a junior, such person shall not, if\n subsequently found suitable and promoted, take seniority in the\n Higher grade over the junior persons who had superseded him.\"\n\n25. Thus, it is evident from the aforesaid Rule that where the\n promotion were made on the basis of the merit-cum-seniority, the\n seniority of person considered fit for promotion at the same time\n shall be the same as relative seniority in the lower grade from\n which they are promoted. Para 12 of the minutes of meeting of\n DPC dated 21.11.2005 (Annexure P/6) clearly shows the seniority\n of the petitioner and respondents No. 5 & 6 as on 01.01.2005 and\n the same is reproduced as under:-\n\n p;u lwfp;k¡ ¼o\"kZokj fjfDr;ksa ds vk/kkj ij½\n\n o\"kZ vuqdzekad ofj\"Brk dzekad vf/kdkjh dk uke eqY;kadu\n LkekU;\n\n 1-1-05 1 4 Jh izrhd [kjs mRd`\"V\n\n 2 1 Jherh vpZuk cgqr vPNk\n jk.kk lsB\n vuqlwfpr tkfr\n &\n vuqlwfpr\n tutkfr\n &\n 3 2 Jherh\n fdzLVhuk ,l-yky cgqr vPNk\n Neutral Citation\n 2024:CGHC:7146\n\n 18\n\n 26. It is clear from representations of the petitioner and the orders of\n respondents that the competent authority duly considered the\n representation of the petitioner and passed impugned orders in\n accordance with rules and notifications of the State and Central\n Government. Therefore, this Court did not find any illegality or\n irregularity in the impugned orders passed by the respondent\n authorities. Thus, the writ petition i.e WPS No. 885/2015 being\n without any substance is liable to be and is hereby dismissed.\n\n 27. The aforesaid petitions are dismissed.\n\n Sd/-\n\n (Rajani Dubey)\n Judge\nRuchi",
