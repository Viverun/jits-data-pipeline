The dispute, a familiar terrain\n\nin service jurisprudence, pertains to the claim for absorption of persons who were\n\nengaged by the Life Insurance Corporation of India1 as temporary/badli/part-time\n\nworkers. \nSection 23(1)\n of the Life Insurance Corporation Act 19562 enables LIC to\n\nemploy such number of persons as it thinks fit to discharge its functions. Pursuant to\n\nclauses (b) and (d) of \nSection 49(2)\n, LIC has framed the Life Insurance Corporation\n\nof India (Staff Regulations) 1960 3. \nRegulation 8\n empowers LIC to appoint persons\n\non a temporary basis in Class III and Class IV posts. After an amendment which was\n\nnotified on 7 August 1971, \nRegulation 8\n provides as follows:\n\n “8. Temporary Staff:-\n\n (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in these Regulations\n the Managing Director or Executive Director (Personnel), a\n Zonal Manager or a Divisional Manager may employ staff in\n classes III and IV on a temporary basis, subject to such\n general or special directions as may be issued by the\n Chairman from time to time.\n\n (2) No person appointed under sub-regulation (1) shall only\n by reason of such appointment be entitled to absorption in the\n services of the Corporation or claim preference for\n recruitment to any post.”\n\n2 On 31 January 1981, \nSections 48\n and \n49\n were amended to impart statutory\n\nforce to the Staff Regulations. According to LIC, its staff and employees are\n\ngoverned by the parent enactment and fall outside the purview of the Industrial\n\n1\n\n “LIC”\n\n2\n\n “\nLIC Act\n”\n\n3\n\n “Staff Regulations”\n\n 7\n\nPART A\n\nDisputes Act\n 1947 4. The validity of the amendment to \nSections 48\n and \n49\n has been\n\nupheld by this Court in \nA V Nachane v. Union of India\n 5.\n\n3 On 13 August 1982, an industrial dispute was raised by the Western Zonal\n\nInsurance Employees Association alleging that LIC had been engaging in unfair\n\nlabour practices by employing temporary, badli and part-time workers and was\n\nrestricting their employment to short tenures to deprive them of the claim for\n\npermanency.\n\n4 On 20 May 1985, the dispute was referred for adjudication by the Central\n\nGovernment to the National Industrial Tribunal6, Bombay presided over by Justice R\n\nD Tulpule 7, a former Judge of the Bombay High Court. The terms of reference were\n\nas follows:\n\n “What should be the wages and other conditions of service of\n badli, temporary and part-time workmen of the Life Insurance\n Corporation of India as well as the conditions of their\n absorption into regular cadre?”\n\n5 On 15 January 1986, the Tulpule Tribunal issued an interim order restraining\n\nLIC from recruiting regular employees and from terminating the services of the ad\n\nhoc workers working with LIC.\n\n4\n\n“\nID Act\n”\n\n5\n\n (1982) 1 SCC 205 (“A V Nachane”). See also: \nM. Venugopal v. Divisional Manager, LIC, Machilipatnam\n, (1994)\n2 SCC 323; and \nLife Insurance Corporation of India v. Raghavendra Seshagirirao Kulkarni\n, (1997) 8 SCC 461\n\n6\n\n “NIT”\n\n7\n\n “Tulpule Tribunal”\n\n 8\n\n\f PART A\n\n6 On 18 April 1986, the Tulpule Tribunal passed an award 8 which was gazetted\n\non 7 June 1986 stipulating that those ad hoc workers who were in employment\n\nbetween 1 January 1982 and 20 May 1985 will be entitled for absorption. The\n\naward, inter alia, stipulated that:\n\n (i) Workers claiming absorption in Class III posts should have worked for 85\n\n days in a period of two years; and\n\n (ii) Workers in Class IV posts should have worked for 70 days in a period of three\n\n years.\n\nThe calculation of the number of days worked was to be up to the date of the\n\nreference. The award contemplated that in the future there would be no occasion for\n\nLIC to employ workers in temporary and badli categories, save and except for\n\noccasional and temporary work.\n\n7 On 1 June 1987, LIC issued circulars for implementing the Tulpule Award.\n\nThese circulars were disputed by the Unions and Associations representing the\n\nworkers. Following this dispute over the LIC circulars, the Central Government\n\nreferred the Tulpule Award for interpretation under \nSection 36-A\n of the ID Act to\n\nanother NIT presided over by Justice M S Jamdar 9, a former Judge of the Bombay\n\nHigh Court. The terms of reference were:\n\n “Can the Award dated 17/4/1986 special reference to\n paragraph 44,45,46, 48, 49, 51,52,54,56,57,60,64 and 66 and\n the interim order dated 14/3/1986 be interpreted to mean that\n the central office of the Life Insurance Corporation of India is\n\n8\n\n “Tulpule Award”\n\n9\n\n “Jamdar Tribunal”\n\n 9\n\n\f PART A\n\n empowered to issue instructions/ guidelines, as contained in\n their circulars issued in this behalf to implement the directions\n of the Award. If not what could be the correct interpretation of\n various directions covered by the said paragraphs in the\n circumstances of the case? Whether the term ‘absorption’\n referred to at various places in the Award can be interpreted\n to mean ‘recruitment’?”\n\n8 By an interim order dated 29 June 1987, the Jamdar Tribunal prohibited LIC\n\nfrom recruiting persons to Class III and Class IV posts from the ‘open market’ during\n\nthe pendency of the proceedings. LIC has argued before this Court that on account\n\nof the restraint imposed on it from recruiting regular employees (through the interim\n\norders dated 15 January 1986 of the Tulpule Tribunal and 29 June 1987 of the\n\nJamdar Tribunal), a large number of ad hoc workers were appointed to carry out the\n\nday-to-day administration of LIC all over India.\n\n9 The Jamdar Tribunal rendered its award on 26 August 1988 10 and it was\n\nnotified in the gazette on 1 October 1988. It held that the absorption contemplated in\n\nthe Tulpule Award did not imply recruitment. LIC challenged the interpretation\n\nrendered by the Jamdar Award under \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution. This Court\n\ngranted leave in the proceedings 11. During the pendency of the proceedings, terms\n\nof compromise were arrived at between LIC and all the Unions representing the\n\nworkers, save and except the Akhil Bharatiya Jeevan Bima Nigam Chathurthi Sreni\n\nKarmachari Sangh 12. The terms of compromise envisaged that the Jamdar and\n\nTulpule Awards should be substituted by the terms and conditions of the\n\n10\n\n “Jamdar Award”\n\n11\n\n SLP (Civil) No 14906 of 1988, which was numbered as Civil Appeal No 1790 of 1989 on the grant of leave\n\n12\n\n “Karmachari Sangh”\n\n 10\n\n\f PART A\n\ncompromise “in relation to the question of regular employment of the workmen\n\nconcerned in the said references”. The terms of compromise which were filed before\n\nthis Court are extracted below:\n\n “TERMS OF COMPROMISE\n\n 1. The Management and the workmen agree that the Award\n of the National Industrial Tribunal presided over by Mr.\n Justice R.D. Tulpule, in Reference No.NTB-1 of 1988,\n published on 7th June 1986, and the Award of the\n National Industrial Tribunal presided over by Mr. Justice\n M.S. Jandar, dated 26th August 1988 in Reference No.\n NTB-1 of 1987, published on 1st October 1988, be\n substituted by the Terms and Conditions of Compromise\n set out hereinafter in relation to the question of regular\n employment of the workmen concerned in the said\n Reference.\n\n 2. The Management agrees to consider the\n temporary/part-time/badli workmen employed by the\n petitioner for 85 days in any two years in a Class III\n post and for 70 days in any three years in a Class IV\n post in any of its establishments during the period\n 1.1.82 to 20.5.85, for regular employment on the basis\n and in the manner stated hereinbelow. The\n temporary/part-time/badli workmen who had made\n applications for regular employment on or before 7.7.86\n or those temporary/part-time/badli workmen whose\n applications had been received after 7.7.86 but before\n 6.3.87 and had been rejected on account of late\n submission, shall be eligible for consideration for regular\n employment. The selection of the candidate shall be\n made on the basis of the following qualifications, age\n test, interview and also having regard to the number\n of days worked by the candidates. A panel of selected\n candidates shall be made and the selected\n candidates shall be appointed in regular employment\n from the panel in the order of merit prospectively\n from the dates to be notified as and when vacancies\n in sanctioned posts for regular employment are filled\n in from time to time :-\n\n 11\n\n\f PART A\n\n(i) QUALIFICATIONS – As per Circular\nNo.Per/A/2D/492/ASP/79, dated 27.11.79, prescribed for\nClass III employee subject to relaxation only in regard to\npercentage of marks, required as per the qualifications as\nmay be decided by the Managing Director of the Petitioner-\n\nCorporation.\n\nPer/A/2D/526/ASP/81, dated 24.6.1981 subject to relaxation\nin the matter of basic qualifications as may be decided by the\nManaging Director of the Petitioner-Corporation.\n\n(ii) AGE – As per Regulation No. 18 of (Staff)\n Regulations, 1960, made by the Petitioner.\n\n(iii) TEST – As per Circular dated 27.11.1979, for Class III\n as well as Class IV workmen and, in addition, as per\n Circular dated 4.6.1981 for Class IV workmen only.\n\n(iv) INTERVIEW – As per Circular dated 27.11.79 for both\n Class III and Class IV workmen.\n\n3. The temporary/part-time/badli workmen who had already\n qualified in the written test held earlier for consideration\n for eligible workmen for regular employment, will not be\n required to appear again for test and they shall be\n considered for interview on the basis of the test already\n held.\n\n4. The test and interview for regular employment to be held\n for the purpose of selection of the temporary/part-\n\n time/badli workmen aforementioned, shall be commenced\n within one month of the order of this Hon’ble Court in\n terms of this Compromise. The selected candidates shall\n be appointed in regular employment in accordance with\n the panel of selected candidates till it is exhausted. The\n petitioner shall, however, be entitled to made recruitment\n straightway wherever vacancies are more than the\n candidates in any Division in view of the necessity or\n expediency for such recruitment.\n\n5. The recruitment of the temporary/part-time/badli workmen\n in the categories of Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe,\n shall be considered first and if any vacancy may remain\n unfulfilled in that category, the petitioner shall be entitled\n to made recruitment in accordance with its usual\n procedure according to its requirements.\n\n6. \nIn view of the abovementioned Terms of Compromise no\n dispute in relation to the workmen concerned, as referred\n in Clause 1 hereinabove, survives in regard to the matter\n\n 12\n\n\f PART A\n\n covered by this Compromise between the parties and the\n respective rights and obligations of the parties in relation\n to regular employment of the said workman concerned\n shall be determined and given effect accordingly, if any\n controversy may arise.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\nThe terms of compromise were accepted by an interim order of a two-judge Bench\n\nof this Court in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n 13 on 1 March 1989. The order is extracted\n\nbelow:\n\n “Special leave is granted. It appears that out of nine Unions\n eight Unions said to be representing about 99% of the\n workers have entered into a compromise with the\n Management. \nIn the circumstances pending the final disposal\n of the appeal, we permit the Management and the members\n of the said eight Unions to implement the terms of\n compromise by way of interim measure without however, any\n prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the\n other Union, who have not entered into such compromise with\n the management.”\n\n10 On 7 February 1996, the above civil appeal in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra)\n\nwas disposed of. This Court accepted the contention of LIC that since eight unions\n\nhad already accepted the compromise, the ninth union (Karamchari Sangh) should\n\nfall in line and act on the terms and conditions of the compromise in the interest of\n\nindustrial peace.\n \nSince the litigating workers in Class IV posts were unable to take\n\nthe test during the pendency of the proceedings, LIC was directed to exempt Class\n\nIV workers from appearing for the test and interview, if the management had power\n\nto do so under the regulations or the instructions governing their conditions of\n\n13\n\n Civil Appeal No 1790 of 1989 (1 March 1989) (\n“LIC v. Their Workmen”\n)\n\n 13\n\n\f PART A\n\nservice. The Court observed that in the event that the management had no such\n\npower, it had “no doubt” that the test prescribed for the workers would be of a lower\n\nstandard than what had been prescribed under the two circulars mentioned in the\n\ncompromise. Pursuant to the compromise, LIC appointed 1875 persons to Class III\n\nposts and 1324 persons to Class IV posts in various divisions.\n\n11 The genesis of the present dispute relates to a demand raised by the Unions\n\non 4 March 1991, pertaining to the claim for regularisation of those workers who\n\nwere employed from 20 May 1985 till the date of reference on 4 March 1991. Acting\n\non the demand, the Central Government made the following reference to the Central\n\nGovernment Industrial Tribunal 14 under \nSections 10(1)(d)\n and \n2A\n of the ID Act:\n\n “Whether the action of the Management of Life Insurance\n Corporation of India in not absorbing badli/temporary and\n part-time workmen employed in the establishment of LIC after\n 20.05.1985 is justified? If not, to what relief the workmen are\n entitled?”\n\n12 On 18 June 2001, the CGIT which was presided over by Shri K S Srivastav,\n\npronounced the award 15 by directing the absorption of the temporary/badli workers\n\non the same terms as the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards, with some modifications.\n\nThe Srivastav Award held that:\n\n “88. In view of the fact I am of the definite view that such type\n of workmen belonging to temporary/badly/ part time\n categories in class III and Class IV service of the corporation\n who were employed after following the procedure and were\n allowed to continue service beyond the qualifying period and\n\n14\n\n “CGIT”\n\n15\n\n “Srivastav Award”\n\n 14\n\n\f PART A\n\n were eligible and suitable to every respect should be given\n absorption in the service from date of the vacancy in the\n service in which they could have been absorbed. It will also\n apply to these employees whose service were terminated by\n the corporation.”\n\n13 In its ultimate directions, the Srivastav Award directed that the temporary,\n\nbadli and part-time workers who were employed after 20 May 1985 should be\n\ngranted absorption on the same terms and conditions as was stipulated in the\n\nTulpule and Jamdar Awards (in respect of workers who were employed from 1\n\nJanuary 1982 to 20 May 1985). LIC was directed to publish a notice in the\n\nnewspapers for inviting applications from individual workers for absorption. If no\n\nregular vacancy was available, the award directed supernumerary posts to be\n\ncreated. Paragraph 94 of the Srivastav Award is extracted below:\n\n \n“94. In view of the matter I find and conclude that the action of\n corporation denying the absorption of these\n temporary/badli/part time workmen as dealt with above in the\n body of this award and employed after 20-05-85 is not\n justified. I further find that these workmen employed after 20-\n 5-85 should be given absorption in their job on the same\n terms and conditions as \nlaid down in\n the aforesaid two\n awards namely Hon’ble Mr Justice R.D. Tulpule and of\n Hon’ble Mr Justice M.S. Jamdar in respect of the workmen\n employed with effect from 1-1-82 to 20-05-85 and dealt with\n by me as above. It is directed that the corporation shall take\n into consideration for the absorption of the workmen, on their\n eligibility and suitability as dealt with above in the award. The\n case of those workmen belonging to the category of\n temporary, badli, part-time who had become eligible for their\n absorption in their job after completing the qualified period of\n working and were suitable in every respect but their services\n were terminated and they were turned out of the job by the\n corporation should also considered for the absorption of such\n terminated workmen of the corporation shall publish a notice\n in the daily newspaper having wide circulation throughout\n India and if in compliance of the notice the workman\n\n 15\n\n\f PART A\n\n concerned consent in writing within stipulated period which\n could be given in the said notice the case of such workman\n should also be considered for their absorption in the regular\n vacancy then existing. At the time of the consideration of\n absorption of such workmen if it is found that no regular\n vacancy is available to such workmen, supernumerary posts\n should also be created and such workmen should be given\n absorption in it. It is also directed that the cases of these\n workmen for absorption in existing vacancies should be taken\n for consideration first irrespective of the regular recruitment if\n taken. The case of the contractual workmen for absorption\n shall be taken into consideration as per observation made in\n the body of the award and on the basis on conditions as\n stated above.”\n\n14 The Srivastav Award was challenged by LIC in a writ petition 16 before the\n\nDelhi High Court.\n \nBy a judgment dated 15 April 2004, a Single Judge of the Delhi\n\nHigh Court set aside the award and held that the decisions of this Court in E\n\nPrabavathy v. Life Insurance Corporation of India 17 and \nLIC of India v. G\n\nSudhakar\n 18 directing LIC to formulate a scheme for regularisation were binding on\n\nthe CGIT. The judgment of the Single Judge of the Delhi High Court was the subject\n\nmatter of a batch of Letters Patent Appeals 19 preferred by six Unions/Associations.\n\nThe appeals were dismissed on 21 March 2007 by the Division Bench. The Division\n\nBench also issued directions for age relaxation and weightage of past service to the\n\nworkers:\n\n “20. In that view of the matter, while dismissing the appeals\n filed by the appellants, we issue directions in the following\n manner:\n\n16\n\n W P No 4346 of 2001 (High Court of Delhi)\n\n17\n\n SLP (Civil) No 10393 of 1992 (“E Prabavathy”)\n\n18\n\n Civil Appeal No 2104 of 2000 (“G Sudhakar”)\n\n19\n\n LPA 678 of 2004 with LPA 690 of 2004, LPA 710 of 2004, LPA 722 of 2004, LPA 1023 of 2004 and LPA 1165 of\n\n2004\n\n 16\n\n\f PART A\n\n (a) for the next three years whenever an advertisement is\n made by the respondent corporation for filling up\n vacancies in Class III and Class IV posts, an opportunity\n shall be given to the appellants to submit their\n applications, which, if submitted, shall be considered\n along with all other candidates but giving age relaxation to\n the appellants and also giving due weightage to the past\n services rendered by the appellants.\n\n \n21. In terms of the aforesaid order, the appeals stand\n disposed of.”\n\n15 The judgment of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court was assailed in a\n\nbatch of Special Leave Petitions 20 filed by six Unions and Associations representing\n\nthe workers. In the meantime, LIC began the process of implementing the judgment\n\nof the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court on 21 March 2007 by issuing an\n\nadvertisement for recruitment of Assistants, by allowing age relaxations and\n\nweightage for temporary workers to compete with candidates from the open market.\n\nOn 11 February 2008, this Court directed the maintenance of status quo. The civil\n\nappeals were eventually disposed of by a two-judge Bench of this Court on 18\n\nMarch 2015 in \nTamil Nadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees\n\nAssociation v. Life Insurance Corporation of India21\n which concluded that the\n\nSrivastav Award was binding. While restoring the Srivastav Award, the judgment of\n\nthis Court directed LIC to implement its directions and set aside the judgment of the\n\nDelhi High Court.\n\n20\n\nSpecial Leave to Appeal (Civil) No 15269 of 2007 with SLP (Civil) No 18943 of 2007, SLP (Civil) No 19958 of 2007,\nSLP (Civil) No 20058 of 2007, SLP (Civil) No 22712 of 2007 and SLP (Civil) No 23623 of 2007\n\n21\n\n (2015) 9 SCC 62 (“TN Terminated Employees Association”)\n\n 17\n\n\f PART A\n\n16 Following the judgment of this Court, LIC issued an advertisement on 21 July\n\n2015 calling for applications from workers who were employed as\n\nbadli/temporary/part-time workers in its establishment from 20 May 1985 to 4 March\n\n1991, in terms of the eligibility criteria determined by the award. This led to the\n\ninstitution of contempt proceedings before this Court on the ground that by\n\nrestricting the eligibility for recruitment to workers who were engaged between 20\n\nMay 1985 and 4 March 1991, LIC was in breach of the directions of this Court in \nTN\n\nTerminated Employees Association\n (supra).\n \nLIC also instituted review petitions\n\nagainst the judgment in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra). The\n\nreview petitions and the contempt petitions were directed to be heard together. On 9\n\nAugust 2016, the review sought by LIC was partially allowed 22 by restricting the\n\naward of back-wages to 50 per cent. The relevant part of the directions of this Court\n\nis reproduced below:\n\n “The temporary and badli workers of LIC, who are entitled for\n regularisation as permanent workmen in terms of the\n impugned judgment and order dated 18.03.2015 passed by\n this Court, by applying the terms and conditions of the\n modified award dated 26.08.1988 passed by Justice Jamdar,\n are held to be entitled to full back wages as well. However,\n keeping in mind the immense financial burden this would\n cause to LIC, we deem it fit to modify the relief only with\n regard to the back wages payable and therefore, we award\n 50% of the back wages with consequential benefits. The back\n wages must be calculated on the basis of the gross salary of\n the workmen, applicable as on the date as per the periodical\n revisions of pay scale as stated supra. The computation\n must be made from the date of entitlement of the\n workmen involved in these cases, that is, their\n absorption, till the age of superannuation, if any concerned\n workman has attained the age of superannuation as per the\n\n22\n\n (2016) 9 SCC 366\n\n 18\n\n\f PART A\n\n regulations of the review petitioner-LIC, as applicable to the\n concerned workman.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n17 The curative petitions instituted by LIC challenging the judgment in review\n\nwere rejected on 22 February 2017. \nIn March 2017, LIC sorted out and distributed\n\nthe applications which had been received in pursuance of its notice dated 21 July\n\n2017 through its zonal offices for implementation of the decision in \nTN Terminated\n\nEmployees Association\n (supra).\n \nOn 16 May 2017, LIC issued directions to the\n\nZonal Managers to implement the Srivastav Award and the order of this Court in the\n\nreview of \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra). The circular prescribed\n\nthe following norms of eligibility for absorption:\n\n (i) The worker should have been engaged between 20 May 1985 and 4 March\n\n 1991;\n\n (ii) The name of the worker should figure in the list submitted by the Unions to\n\n the CGIT in the industrial reference;\n\n (iii) Class III workers ought to have been engaged for at least 85 days in two\n\n calendar years while Class IV workers should have been engaged for at least\n\n 70 days in three calendar years;\n\n (iv) The Union or the Association should have been an appellant before the\n\n Supreme Court;\n\n 19\n\n\f PART A\n\n (v) The claimant worker should have submitted a biodata in pursuance of the\n\n notice issued by the LIC on 21 July 2015 for recruitment in regularised\n\n positions; and\n\n (vi) The worker should have been engaged in accordance with the rules prevalent\n\n in LIC.\n\n18 In 2017, various divisions of LIC found 245 workmen to be eligible and they\n\nwere offered absorption by the Zonal Offices. This led to the initiation of contempt\n\nproceedings 23 by the Unions who sought the absorption of all temporary, part-time\n\nand badli workers and daily wagers who were engaged after 20 May 1985 till date.\n\n19 On 11 May 2018, a two-judge Bench of this Court 24 directed the petitioning\n\nUnions in the contempt proceedings to submit material documents to show the\n\nengagement of the workers between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991. This Court\n\nalso directed LIC to nominate a senior official to scrutinise the documents and to\n\ntake a final decision in accordance with the prescribed conditions. Consequently,\n\nLIC received about eighty-three thousand representations. Upon scrutiny, LIC found\n\nseventy-six workers to be eligible for absorption. By an order dated 7 September\n\n2018, a two-judge Bench of this Court 25 directed the CGIT at New Delhi to decide\n\nupon the eligibility of the claims made by the Unions, Associations and individual\n\nworkers within a period of three months. However, the Court found that there was no\n\n23\n\n Contempt Petition (Civil) 1921 of 2017 in Civil Appeal 6950 of 2009\n\n24\n\n Ranbir Singh v. S K Roy, Chairman, LIC, Contempt Petition (Civil) No 1921 of 2017 in Civil Appeal No 6950 of\n2009 (11 May 2018)\n\n25\n\n Ranbir Singh v. S K Roy, Chairman, LIC, Contempt Petition (Civil) No 1921 of 2017 in Civil Appeal No 6950 of\n2009 (7 September 2018)\n\n 20\n\n\f PART A\n\nbreach of the judgment dated 18 March 2015 in \nTN Terminated Employees\n\nAssociation\n (supra). The order of this Court is extracted below:\n\n “The crucial dispute in these proceedings is regarding the\n beneficiaries of the Award dated 18.06.2001 in I.D. No.27 of\n 1991 of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal (CGIT),\n New Delhi.\n\n \nThe Award has been finally upheld by this Court in the\n judgment rendered in \nTamil Nadu Terminated Full Time\n Temporary LIC Employees Association v. Life Insurance\n Corporation of India and Others\n, reported in (2015) 9 SCC 62.\n\n Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India\n appearing for the respondents/LIC, submits that for want of\n documents/materials, the LIC is not in a position to verify as\n to who are the actual beneficiaries of the Award.\n Learned\n counsel appearing for the Union(s) and the individual\n workers, however, would submit that despite producing the\n records and despite availability of the original records with the\n LIC, no positive decision is taken by it.\n\n Faced with such a situation, we are of the view that the\n CGIT, New Delhi should look into the matter with regard to\n the claims made by the Union(s)/individual workmen,\n regarding entitlement to the benefits under the Award and\n submit a report to this Court. Accordingly, we direct the CGIT,\n New Delhi to look into the claims made by the\n Union(s)/individual Workmen and submit a report to this Court\n within three months.\n\n There is also a dispute raised by some of the respondents\n that the benefit of Award should be made available to those\n who have been engaged as Badli workers after 4.3.1991.\n That is a matter for interpretation by this Court. For the time\n being, CGIT, New Delhi would limit its enquiry only to the\n claims of the Badli workers between 20.05.1989 and\n 04.03.1991, as already indicated by this Court in the order\n dated 11.05.2018.\n\n We do not find that it is a case of contempt. Therefore, the\n contempt notices are discharged. However, the\n applications/petitions be kept pending for the purpose of\n necessary assistance to the Court.”\n\n 21\n\n\f PART A\n\nOn 10 September 2018 26, the above order was modified by the same two-judge\n\nBench in the following terms:\n\n “There is also a dispute raised by some of the respondents\n that the benefit of Award should be made available to those\n who have been engaged as Badli/Part-time/Temporary\n workers after 4.3.1991. That is a matter for interpretation by\n this Court. For the time being, CGIT, New Delhi would limit its\n enquiry only to the claims of the Badli workers between\n\n \n20.05.1985 and 04.03.1991, as already indicated by this\n Court in the order dated 11.05.2018.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n20 Thereafter, on 12 December 2018 27, while dealing with the batch of contempt\n\npetitions, a two-judge Bench of this Court directed the CGIT, in terms of this Court’s\n\nprevious directions dated 7 September 2018 in the same contempt proceedings, to\n\n“look into the matter with regard to the claims made by the Union(s) individual\n\nworkmen”. The CGIT was directed to submit its report within four months, as\n\ncontemplated by the order dated 7 September 2018 and modified on 10 September\n\n2018 in the contempt proceedings. Between October 2018 and 16 May 2018, the\n\nCGIT issued notice to the Unions and individuals in the earlier industrial reference to\n\nsubmit their claims. As many as 15,500 claims were submitted on behalf of the\n\nUnions, Associations and individual workers claiming absorption and the benefit of\n\nthe Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001. LIC submitted its responses before the\n\nCGIT. The CGIT submitted its report on 31 May 2019 28 to this Court. The report of\n\n26\n\nRanbir Singh v. S K Roy, Chairman, LIC, Contempt Petition (Civil) No\n 1921 of 2017 in Civil Appeal No 6950 of\n2009 (10 September 2018)\n\n27\n\n Ranbir Singh v. S K Roy, Chairman, LIC, Contempt Petition (Civil) No 1921 of 2017 in Civil Appeal No 6950 of\n2009 (12 September 2018)\n\n28\n\n “Dogra Report”\n\n 22\n\n\f PART B\n\nthe CGIT will be referred to as the Dogra Report, adopting the name of the presiding\n\nofficer.\n\nB Dogra Report\n\n21 Before the presiding officer of the CGIT, LIC set up the plea that only those\n\nworkers whose names were mentioned in the original certified list in the industrial\n\nreference were entitled to the benefit of the Srivastav Award. LIC argued that this\n\nwas also the direction issued by the Supreme Court in the contempt proceedings\n\narising out of a review of \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) on 10\n\nSeptember 2018 and reiterated on 12 December 2018. On the other hand, the\n\nUnions representing the workers, as well as the individual workers, claimed that they\n\nwere entitled to the benefit of the award irrespective of whether their claim found\n\nplace in the original list as certified before the CGIT in the industrial reference.\n\nDealing with this aspect, the Dogra Report concluded that though the order dated 10\n\nSeptember 2018 required the CGIT to verify the list which was already on the\n\nrecord, this did not imply that only those workers whose names figured in the\n\ncertified list were entitled to absorption, to the exclusion of others. Paragraphs 24\n\nand 25 of the Dogra Report have a bearing on the present proceedings and are\n\nhence extracted below:\n\n \n“24. To my mind, answer to this question has to be given\n in the light of backdrop of the circumstances which\n culminated into passing of the Award in ID case No.27 of\n 1991 which was admittedly upheld by Hon’ble Supreme Court\n in its judgment dated 18/3/2015 reported as (2015) 9 SCC 62\n – \nTamil Nadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC\n Employees Vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India\n. No doubt,\n\n 23\n\n\f PART B\n\nHon’ble Apex Court in its order dated 10/9/2018 has observed\nthat this Tribunal will verify the list which is available on\nrecord. But this does not mean that only such workmen\nwhose names are mentioned in the original/certified list\nattached with the reference, are liable to be considered for\nabsorption, to the exclusion of other workmen. This Tribunal\nhas to keep in mind that contempt petitions were earlier filed\nby members of Various Unions before Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt and LIC had also filed contempt petitions in High Court\nof Delhi against Regional Labour Commissioner. During\npendency of said petition, E. Prabhavati and others were\nimpleaded as party at the instance of LIC vide order dated\n25/9/2008. Thereafter, memo of parties was filed by LIC by\nadding Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees\nWelfare Association as Respondent No.47. In view of this, the\ncontention of the LIC that members of E. Prabhavati & others\nor Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees Welfare\nAssociation are not entitled to any relief, is not tenable, when\nthe said Association has been held to be necessary party.\nThere is not even a whisper in any of the judgment/order of\nHon’ble High Court or Hon’ble Supreme Court that only\nworkmen whose names are mentioned in the certified/original\nlist of CGIT Award are to be granted relief. An overall\nexamination of the order dated 10/9/2018 of the Hon’ble\nSupreme Court shows that this Tribunal is required to verify\nthe list available on record but there is no direction to exclude\nmembers of other Union/workmen inasmuch as Hon’ble the\nApex Court while considering the claims of contempt\npetitioners has ordered this Tribunal to consider the claims of\nthose workers who were employed as Badli workers with the\nManagement of LIC during the period from 20/5/1985 to\n4/3/1991 subject to fulfilment of number of days as mentioned\nin the Award.\n\n25. It is settled principle of law that while considering the\norder/judgment of Constitutional Court, this Tribunal is\nrequired to keep in mind entire spectrum of the orders as well\nas background of the case. It is not proper to cull out a single\npara or a sentence from the order/judgment so as to defeat\nthe very purpose of the order so passed by Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt. If the orders dated 11/5/2018, 7/9/2018 and 10/9/2018\nare taken into consideration, it is crystal clear that claims of all\nsuch workmen and Union/s who worked as Badli workers\nduring the period from 20/5/1985 to 4/3/1991 are required to\nbe considered by this Tribunal. Although I am in full\nagreement with the submission made on behalf of the\n\n 24\n\n\f PART B\n\n Management/LIC that initial onus is always upon the\n workmen concerned to prove that they were in the\n employment of the Management at the relevant time,\n however this Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that UC has not\n filed on record any document/record relating to employment\n of various workmen rather has simply taken a plea that same\n being old record is not traceable.”\n\n22 The Dogra Report noted that LIC had admitted that 321 workers were found\n\nto be eligible for absorption in terms of the Srivastav Award. The report found fault\n\nwith LIC for making contradictory claims that 321 workers were eligible for\n\nabsorption when the records of workers were allegedly old and not traceable. The\n\nDogra Report drew an adverse inference against LIC for having failed to maintain\n\nthe records in pursuance of the burden cast upon it by \nSection 25-D\n of the ID Act,\n\nparticularly when the reference was pending since 1991. Paragraph 29 of the report\n\nis extracted below:\n\n “29) During the course of arguments as well as in the reply\n filed on behalf of the Management/LIC, it is clear that\n Management has admitted that till date 321 Nos. of\n employees were found to be eligible in terms of the Award\n and they were considered eligible for absorption. It is not\n understandable to this Tribunal as to what were the basis for\n the Management/LIC for coming to the conclusion that only\n 321 Nos. of workmen/employees were found to be eligible\n and covered by the Award of CGIT in ID case No.27/1991,\n when the Management has come up with a plea that record\n relating to the workmen being old record is not traceable. It is\n worthwhile to mention here that \nSection 25-D\n of the ID Act\n specifically provides that it is the duty of every Employer to\n maintain a muster roll and to provide for the making of entries\n therein by the workmen who may present themselves for\n work at the establishment. This Tribunal has to keep in mind\n a vital fact that since the reference bearing ID No.27/1991 is\n pending before various Courts since 1991, the\n Management/LIC was/is required to keep the record in safe\n custody when the case of such a huge magnitude was\n\n 25\n\n\f PART B\n\n pending before the Courts. In such circumstances, this\n Tribunal is constrained to draw adverse inference against the\n management.”\n\n23 Based on the above hypothesis, the report proceeded to decide “prima facie”\n\nthe claims of the Unions and individual workers. While taking up the claims made by\n\nthe All India Life Insurance Employees Association and its affiliate, Life Insurance\n\nEmployees Association, Delhi, the report notes that 6998 claims had been filed (as\n\ncontained in Annexure A). Upon scrutiny, LIC drew the attention of the CGIT to the\n\nfact that 3592 duplicate entries were found in the claims which were submitted (as\n\ncontained in Annexure A-1). Noting that the “Unions have not seriously disputed the\n\nsame”, the Dogra Report concludes that “such claimants are to be given benefit of\n\nabsorption only once”. The Dogra Report also notes that workers who had started\n\nworking beyond the cut-off date of 4 March 1991 would not be covered in the\n\nenquiry. \nThis observation in the Dogra Report was in view of the order of this Court\n\nin the contempt proceedings arising out of the review of \nTN Terminated Employees\n\nAssociation\n (supra) on 7 September 2018, which had specifically observed that\n\nwhether the benefit of the Srivastav Award should be given to those who had been\n\nengaged as badli workers after 4 March 1991 was a matter for interpretation by this\n\nCourt. Hence, for the time being, CGIT had been directed to limit its enquiry only to\n\nthe claims for the period between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991 (as contained in\n\nAnnexure A-2). In this context, the Dogra Report held that those workers who had\n\ncommenced work after 4 March 1991 would not be covered by its enquiry.\n\n 26\n\n\f PART B\n\n24 The Dogra Report accordingly found the following workers to be entitled to\n\nabsorption:\n\n a) The All India Insurance Employees Association Calcutta and Western Zone\n\n Insurance Employees Association had filed a claim on behalf of 3337 workers\n\n as part of the list contained in Annexure B. LIC argued that in this list of 3337\n\n workers, 3332 workers did not find mention in the original certified list. The\n\n Dogra Report perused the documents and found that all 3337 workers were\n\n entitled to the benefit of absorption;\n\n b) All India LIC Employees Association had filed claims on behalf of 97 workers\n\n as a list contained in Annexure C. The Dogra Report found that all 97 workers\n\n (except one who commenced work post 4 March 1991) were entitled to\n\n absorption and LIC’s argument of fabrication of documents was baseless\n\n when considered against the general practice of the Branch Managers at LIC;\n\n c) National Organization of Insurance Workers filed a claim on behalf of workers\n\n as a part of Annexure D. The Dogra Report found that all 401 workers in\n\n accordance with Annexure D were eligible for absorption;\n\n d) The All India National Life Insurance Federation Bombay filed two claims on\n\n behalf of 1674 workers of the Nagpur Association (Annexure E) and 371\n\n workers of the Hyderabad Association (Annexure F). The Nagpur Association\n\n conceded that approximately 84 entries were blank, and 38 workers who had\n\n worked after 4 March 1991 and three who worked prior to 1 January 1982\n\n would not be entitled to any benefit. Thus, the 1590 remaining workers of the\n\n 27\n\n\f PART B\n\n Nagpur Association were found to eligible for absorption (contained in\n\n Annexure E-1). The legal heirs of two deceased workers were held to be\n\n entitled to monetary benefit in lieu of service. As regards the 371 workers of\n\n the Hyderabad Association, the Dogra Report excludes those who had either\n\n worked prior to 20 May 1985 or after 4 March 1991 and those eligible for\n\n absorption were detailed out in Annexure F-1;\n\n e) The Akhil Bhartiya Jivan Nigam filed claims on behalf of 890 workers as a part\n\n of a list contained in Annexure G. It was admitted that of the 890 workers, 692\n\n were engaged after 4 March 1991, there were 8 repeat entries and 2 workers\n\n were engaged prior to 1985. Consequently, after carrying out the exclusions,\n\n Annexure G-1 represented the list of eligible workers identified by the Dogra\n\n Report for absorption;\n\n f) The Tamil Nadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees Welfare\n\n Association filed claims on behalf of 376 workers in Annexure H. After\n\n excluding those who had worked prior to or after the cut-off date, a list of\n\n eligible employees was tabulated by the Dogra Report in Annexure H-1.\n\n Workers who had reached the age of superannuation were held entitled to\n\n receive all consequential benefits from LIC; and\n\n g) Annexure I contained the names of a group of workers, described as the “E-\n\n Prabhavati workmen” 29 containing 1333 workers. After excluding those who\n\n had worked less than the requisite number of days for absorption and those\n\n who had been engaged after 4 March 1991, the Dogra Report found the\n\n29\n\n Interchangeably referred as “E Prabavathy”\n\n 28\n\n\f PART B\n\n remaining workers to be eligible for absorption and their claims were\n\n tabulated in Annexure I (A). The specific case of the E Prabhavati group of\n\n workers will be dealt with in the course of the present judgment. At this stage,\n\n it is be material to note that LIC had contended that this batch of workers had\n\n been specifically excluded by paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award.\n\n Notwithstanding this, the Dogra Report has held that this batch of workers\n\n would also be entitled to absorption.\n\n25 Apart from the persons named in the annexures mentioned above, the Dogra\n\nReport has concluded that the following claims by the Union for absorption would\n\nhave to be allowed:\n\n (i) Annexure J filed on behalf of 36 workers by the LIC Workers Union Kanpur –\n\n where 35 workers were allowed absorption (except 1 worker recruited after\n\n the cut-off date);\n\n (ii) Annexure K filed on behalf of 17 workers by the LIC Workers Union, Gujarat\n\n Unit – where 4 out of the 17 workers were held eligible;\n\n (iii) Annexure L filed on behalf of 119 workers from the Jodhpur Division of LIC –\n\n where all were held eligible for absorption (while it was noted that 1 worker’s\n\n name appeared twice);\n\n (iv) Annexure M – 22 workers were held entitled to absorption;\n\n (v) Annexure N – 2 workers out of the 54 were held entitled to absorption since\n\n only these two worked during the relevant period;\n\n 29\n\n\f PART C\n\n (vi) Annexure O – 1 out of 9 workers was held entitled to absorption, since the\n\n others had been employed after the cut-off date of 4 March 1991;\n\n (vii) Annexure P – 4 workers were held entitled to absorption;\n\n (viii) Annexure Q – workers in this list were held not entitled to the benefit of\n\n absorption as they had worked after the cut-off date of 4 March 1991; and\n\n (ix) Apart from the above annexures, the Dogra Report scrutinized the claim of\n\n several individual workers and determined whether they were entitled to\n\n absorption.\n\nC LIC’s objections to the Dogra Report\n\n26 Broadly speaking, LIC has urged the following objections to the Dogra Report:\n\n (i) The CGIT was not entrusted with the task of adjudication but of verification;\n\n \n(ii) The orders passed by this court in the contempt proceedings arising out of the\n\n review of the decision in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) on\n\n 11 May 2018, 7 September 2018 and 10 September 2018 indicate that:\n\n (a) In the course of verification, CGIT was not entitled to travel beyond the\n\n Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001;\n\n (b) The CGIT had to verify only those claims where the workers were\n\n engaged between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991; and\n\n (c) The verification by CGIT was to be confined only to those badli, temporary\n\n and part-time workers whose names were contained in the original\n\n 30\n\n\f PART C\n\n certified list in the reference leading to the Srivastav Award dated 18 June\n\n 2001;\n\n(iii) The CGIT was duty-bound to verify only the documents produced by LIC to\n\n determine whether the workers were working during the specified period. The\n\n Dogra Report has found that almost all the names of workers submitted by\n\n the Union were eligible without due verification;\n\n(iv) A total of 15,465 claims were submitted, which include:\n\n (a) Persons who were engaged beyond the stipulated period between 20 May\n\n 1985 and 4 March 1991;\n\n (b) Persons whose names were not in the certified list before the CGIT in the\n\n industrial reference; and\n\n (c) Persons from the E Prabhavati group who were not covered by the\n\n Srivastav Award, as expressly set out in paragraph 75 of the award;\n\n(v) During the course of the verification by LIC, it was found that the\n\n documents/material produced by several workers were fabricated and there\n\n was a duplication of names; and\n\n(vi) Though paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award had categorically held that the\n\n group of workers described as the “E Prabhavati” group were not entitled to\n\n relief, the Dogra Report held them to be entitled for absorption. LIC has also\n\n submitted objections to the certification which has been carried out in respect\n\n of certain workers whose names are set out in the annexures to the Dogra\n\n Report.\n\n 31\n\n\f PART D\n\n27 At this stage, it would be material to note that the original certified list of\n\nworkers in the reference contained the names of 4024 workers. According to LIC, if\n\nthe certification exercise carried out in the Dogra Report were to be accepted, about\n\n11,780 workers would be entitled to absorption.\n\nD The E Prabavathy Group\n\n28 The Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001 details the history pertaining to this\n\ngroup of workers. Paragraphs 19-20 and 75 of the Award are extracted below:\n\n “19. Thereafter the employees employed as temporary,\n badli and part time after 20th May 1985 raised demand for\n their absorption regularising too in the regular service. When\n their demands were not accepted by the corporation several\n writ petitions in this respect were filed before the Hon’ble High\n Court of Madras. These writ petitions were filed before the\n Hon’ble High Court of Madras between the years 1989 to\n 1991. The writ petition No.10367/89 filed was between the\n terminated full time temporary LIC Welfare Association and\n Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Khanjawar. This writ petition\n alongwith other writ petitions total 18 writ petitions were listed\n for hearing before the full bench of Hon’ble High Court of\n Madras. After hearing the parties of all the writ petitions the\n Hon’ble High Court of Madras gave judgment which is\n reported as 1993(1) LLJ 1030 between terminated full\n temporary employees welfare association and Senior\n Divisional Manager, LIC, Khanjawar. All the writ petitions\n were dismissed by the Hon’ble High Court of Madras.\n\n 20. Parties had then preferred civil appeal before the\n Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against judgment of the\n Hon’ble High Court of Madras. These civil appeals were\n numbered as SLP (C) 10393 to 10413/92 E. Prabhawati and\n others Vs. LIC of India and others. It appears that in the said\n civil appeal on the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court\n Corporation had framed a scheme for the regularization of the\n employees who were granted ad hoc appointments for 85\n days at intervals from time to time was placed before the\n\n 32\n\n\f PART D\n\n Hon’ble Supreme Court. After hearing the parties by means of\n interim order dated 23-10-92 found the scheme as\n reasonable and was approved to the existence of the scheme\n contained in clauses (a) and (d) of paragraph 1 and the\n corporation was directed to proceed to regularise the\n employees eligible in accordance with the scheme. The\n clauses of (a) and (d) of the scheme have been reproduced in\n the order by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. With the\n aforesaid direction all the civil appeals were disposed of by\n the Hon’ble Supreme Court.\n\n […]\n\n 75. Now as regard the binding effect of the order dated 23-\n 10-92 passed by Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in SLP No.\n 10393-10411/92 E. Prabhawathy and others Vs. Life\n Insurance Corporation of India and another confirming the\n scheme of absorption/regularisation as argued on behalf of the\n corporation in my view can be well accepted. The order\n passed I find is between the same parties. E. Prabhawathy\n and other is the party in this proceeding being impleaded at\n the subsequent stage of the proceeding. Statement of claim\n has been filed in the present case by the aforesaid workmen.\n The said order dated 23-10-92 of Hon’ble Supreme Court is\n thus between same parties of the case and in view of the\n circumstances. I find that workmen has no ground to challenge\n the legality of the said order dated 23.10.92. The conditions of\n the workmen made in this regard are not accepted.”\n\n29 At this stage, it would be material to note that on 23 October 1992, a three-\n\njudge Bench of this Court specifically dealt with the above group of workmen in E\n\nPrabavathy (supra). The judgment of this Court is extracted below in its entirety:\n\n “ORDER\n\n Special Leave granted.\n\n In State of Haryana & Ors. etc. etc. v. Piara Singh & Ors. etc.\n etc., (JT 1992(5) S.C. 179), this court indicated how\n regularization of adhoc/temporary employees in Government\n and Public Sector Undertakings should be effected. While\n\n 33\n\n\f PART D\n\nlaying down the guidelines in this behalf, this court observe in\nparagraph 43 as under:-\n\n \"The normal rule, of course, is regular\n recruitment through the prescribed agency\n but exigencies of administration may\n sometimes call for an adhoc or temporary\n appointment to be made. In such a situation,\n effort should always be to replace such an\n adhoc/temporary employee by a regularly\n selected employee as early as possible.\n\n Such a temporary employee may also\n compete along with others for such regular\n selection/appointment. If he gets selected,\n well and good, but if he does not, he must\n give way to the regularly selected candidate.\n\n The appointment of the regularly selected\n candidate cannot be withheld or kept in\n abeyance for the sake of such an\n adhoc/temporary employee.\"\n\nThe LIC was asked to work out a scheme for the purpose of\nregularization of employees who were granted adhoc\nappointments for 85 days at intervals from time to time. The\nlearned counsel for the LIC has placed before us a Scheme\nfor regularization of such adhoc employees. We have given\nour anxious consideration to the Scheme proposed by the LIC\nand have also heard both Mr. Ramamurthy and Mr. Salve at\nlength and we are of the opinion that the Scheme proposed\nby LIC is a reasonable one and commands acceptance, save\nand except the fact that the recruitment scheduled for\nNovember, 1992 will be postponed by not less than six weeks\nto enable the eligible adhoc employees to compete with\nothers for selection at the said recruitment. We are of the\nopinion that the relaxation granted to these adhoc employees\nfor having worked with the LIC in the past in the matter of age\nand qualification suffices. The further provision that if such an\nadhoc employee has worked between 20th May, 1985 and till\ndate for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar years, is a\nreasonable stipulation for eligibility for regularization. We are\nof the opinion, the scheme is in consonance with the\nguidelines which we have laid down in paragraphs 43 to 49 of\nPiara Singh's judgment. Mr. Salve, the learned counsel for the\nLIC, also informed us that in regard to future adhoc\nappointments/regularization the LIC is in the process of\nmaking a scheme consistent with the guidelines laid down in\n\n 34\n\n\f PART D\n\nPiara Singh's case so that this device of employment for 85\ndays which has not been approved may not be resorted to in\nfuture. The Scheme contained in Clauses (a) to (d) of\nparagraph 1, which is as under, is approved subject to the\npostponement of the recruitment scheduled in November,\n1992 by at least six weeks and the LIC will proceed to\nregularize the employees eligible under the Scheme;\n\n (a) All those temporary employees who have worked\n for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar years\n with the Life Insurance Corporation between 20th\n May, 1985 uptill date and who confirmed to the\n required eligibility criteria for regular recruitment on\n the dates of their initial temporary, appointment will be\n permitted to compete for the next regular recruitment\n to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation after\n the regular recruitment for these posts currently\n scheduled for November, 1992.\n\n (b) These candidates will be considered on their\n merits with all other candidates who may apply for\n such appointments, including those from the open\n market.\n\n (c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation\n for applying for regular recruitment provided that they\n were eligible on the date of their first temporary\n appointment for securing regular appointment with the\n Life Insurance Corporation.\n\n (d) If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can\n apply for regular recruitment in the normal course.\n\nThis regularization will, in the circumstances, be by selection\nfor appointment. We make the above clauses of the Scheme\nas part of our order.\n\nMr. Ramamurthy, the learned counsel for the petitioners,\nfurther submitted that certain questions of law in regard to the\ninterpretation of \nsection 84\n of the LIC Act, 1956, as amended\nby the \nLIC Amendment Act, 1981\n, and \nSection 2(oo) (bb)\n of\nthe Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, arise for consideration in\nthe present case in view of the judgment of the Madras High\nCourt. We may state that we express no opinion on the said\nquestions of law as they do not survive in view of the scheme\n\n 35\n\n\f PART D\n\n which LIC has worked out and which we have approved. It is\n not necessary for us to go into those questions and we leave\n them open for decision in an appropriate case in future.\n\n The Civil Appeals will stand disposed of accordingly with no\n order as to costs.”\n\n30 The above order of the three-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) indicates\n\nthat LIC had been directed by the Court to work out a scheme for the purpose of\n\nregularising workers who were granted ad hoc appointment for a period of 85 days\n\nfrom time to time. A scheme was prepared by LIC. The three-judge Bench had given\n\n“its anxious consideration to the scheme proposed by the LIC” and having heard\n\nboth counsel for the workers and for LIC, held that it was “of the opinion that the\n\nscheme proposed by LIC is reasonable one and commands acceptance”. The only\n\nmodification was a postponing of the recruitment which was scheduled on 1\n\nNovember 1992 to allow eligible ad hoc workers to compete with others for selection\n\nat the recruitment. This Court affirmed the relaxation of age and qualifications\n\ngranted by the scheme to eligible ad hoc workers who had worked between 20 May\n\n1985 “till date” in any two calendar years. This Court accepted the scheme which\n\nwas proposed by LIC, subject to the modification noted above. This Court held that\n\nregularisation would be by selection for appointment. The clauses of the scheme\n\nwere incorporated as a part of the order dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy\n\n(supra). In this backdrop, paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award specifically excluded\n\nthe claims of the E Prabavathy workers who were governed by the order of this\n\nCourt dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra). The grievance of the LIC is\n\n 36\n\n\f PART E\n\nthat despite this, the Dogra Report concludes that this group of workers would be\n\neligible for absorption in terms of the Srivastav Award.\n\nE Sequel to E Prabavathy\n\n31 Following the order of this Court dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy\n\n(supra), LIC framed the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Employment of\n\nTemporary Staff) Instructions 1993. A contempt petition was moved before this\n\nCourt alleging that the scheme which was notified by LIC on 28 June 1993 was not\n\nin accordance with the order in E Prabhavathy (supra). The contempt petition was\n\ndismissed by this Court on 12 July 1993.\n\n32 In 1998, a batch of writ petitions was filed in the High Court of Andhra\n\nPradesh seeking the relief of absorption on a permanent basis. Among the petitions\n\nwas a petition instituted by G Sudhakar and others. A Single Judge of the High\n\nCourt of Andhra Pradesh dismissed the petition, placing reliance on the decision in\n\nE Prabavathy (supra). On 3 November 1998, the Division Bench of the High Court\n\ndirected LIC to frame a scheme for regularisation. \nLIC preferred a Special Leave\n\nPetition against the judgment of the Division Bench in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra) which\n\nwas allowed by this Court 30 on 22 November 2001.\n \nA two-judge Bench of this Court\n\nheld in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra) that the scheme approved in E Prabavathy (supra)\n\nshall govern the absorption of all ad hoc workers in the country.\n \nThis Court’s order\n\ndated 22 November 2001 in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra) is extracted below:\n\n30\n\n Civil Appeal No 2104 of 2000\n\n 37\n\n\f PART E\n\n“This appeal is by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (for\nshort “the Corporation”) against the Division Bench Judgment\nof the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The Respondents filed a\nWrit Petition praying for a mandamus to the corporation for\ntheir absorption on permanent basis which stood dismissed.\n\nOn an appeal being carried, the Division Bench of the High\nCourt disposed of the appeal with a direction to the\ncorporation to frame a scheme for regularisation of the\nemployees and regularise their services in accordance with\nsuch scheme. It is this direction of the High Court which is the\nsubject matter of challenge in this Appeal.\n\nMr. Salve, the learned Solicitor General appearing for the\nCorporation stated that, in fact, in the case of E. Prabhavathy\n& Ors. v. The Life Insurance Corporation of India & Anr. (Civil\nAppeals arising out of SLPs Nos. 1039-10413/1992), this\nCourt was in seisin of a similar problem and during the\nhearing of that appeal, a tentative scheme was produced\nbefore this Court and the Court framed the terms of those\nschemes as a part of the order and disposed of the appeal in\nterms of the said scheme on 23rd October, 1992. The four\nclauses of the said scheme which formed a part of the order\nare quoted hereinbelow in extenso :-\n\n“Scheme :\n\n(a) All those temporary employees who have worked for 85\ndays in any two consecutive calendar years with the Life\nInsurance Corporation between 20th May, 1985 uptill date\nand who conformed to the required eligibility criteria for\nregular recruitment on the dates of their initial temporary\nappointment will be permitted to compete for the next regular\nrecruitment to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation\nafter the regular recruitment for these posts currently\nscheduled for November, 1992;\n\n(b) These candidates will be considered on their merits with\nall other candidates who may apply for such appointments,\nincluding those from the open market.\n\n(c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation for\napplying for regular recruitment provided that they were\neligible on the date of their first temporary appointment for\nsecuring regular appointment with the Life Insurance\nCorporation;\n\n(d) If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can apply\nfor regular recruitment in the normal course.\n\n 38\n\n\f PART E\n\nAccording to the learned Solicitor General, since a scheme is\nin existence, it is no longer necessary to evolve a fresh\nscheme for these employees who were the parties before the\nAndhra Pradesh High Court. He also stated that in the\nmeantime, a set of instructions have been framed called the\n“Life Insurance Corporation of India (Employment of\nTemporary Staff) Instructions, 1993” which takes care of such\nemployees who were continuing for a fairly long period\nwithout being regularised.\n\nMr. Krishnamurthy, the learned Senior Counsel, on the other\nhand, contended that the aforesaid instructions will not\ngovern the case of the employees who were there before the\nHigh Court, as they were the appointees between 1986 and\n1993. He further contended that a similar matter, in the case\nof The Management of the LIC of India v. Their Workmen\n(C.A. Nos. 1790/89) a Bench of this Court has disposed of\nwith a direction to consider the case of regularisation\nconsidering the suitability at a lesser standard by its judgment\ndated 7th February, 1996 and, therefore, there is no infirmity\nwith the impugned direction of the High Court.\n\nHaving examined the judgment dated 7th February, 1996 of\nthis Court in C.A. Nos. 1790/89, we find that the earlier 3\njudge bench decision dated 23rd October, 1992 has not been\nnoticed. The aforesaid three-judge bench decision\nunequivocally makes the provisions of the scheme as a part\nof the order. Necessarily, therefore, the case of regularisation\nof the employees of the corporation could be dealt with in\naccordance with the said scheme and it would not be\nnecessary to evolve a fresh scheme for a group of\nemployees. Mr. Krishnamurthy further contended that the E.\nPrabhavathy’s case (supra) relates to the employees of Tamil\nNadu division. But, it is not disputed that they are the\nemployees of the Corporation. If the Corporation has evolved\na scheme assuming for the Tamil Nadu division, then the\nsame could be equally applicable to the employees of all\nDivisions in the country. \nThat being the position, the scheme\nwhich has been approved and formed a part of the order of\nthis Court dated 23-10-1992 should govern the case of these\nrespondents who were writ petitioners before the High Court\nof Andhra Pradesh\n\nNeedless to mention, in the earlier decision of this Court\ndated 23-10-1992 this Court has not limited the applicability of\n\n 39\n\n\f PART E\n\n the scheme only to the employees of the Tamil Nadu Division.\n In the aforesaid circumstances, the High Court of Andhra\n Pradesh was not justified in issuing the impugned direction to\n the Corporation to evolve a new set of scheme to govern the\n case of the employees who had filed writ petitions in the High\n Court. We, therefore, set aside the impugned direction of the\n Division Bench of the High Court and substitute the same with\n the direction that the case of regularisation of these\n respondents shall be considered in accordance with the\n scheme which formed a part of the order of this Court dated\n 23-10-1992, if not already considered. This appeal\n accordingly stands disposed of.”\n\n33 The above judgment of this Court in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra) lays down that:\n\n (i) The order dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra) made the scheme\n\n as a part of its order. Necessarily, the case for the regularisation of the\n\n workers of LIC would be dealt with in accordance with the scheme. Hence, it\n\n was not necessary to evolve a fresh scheme for a different group of workers;\n\n (ii) Though E Prabavathy (supra) dealt with workers of the Tamil Nadu Division,\n\n the scheme which was evolved by LIC would equally be applicable to workers\n\n of all divisions in the country;\n\n (iii) The decision in E Prabavathy (supra) has not limited the applicability of the\n\n scheme only to the workers of the Tamil Nadu division; and\n\n (iv) The Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh was not justified in\n\n evolving a new scheme to govern the workers who had filed a Writ Petition\n\n and its judgment accordingly stands set aside.\n\n34 The decision of a two-judge Bench of this Court dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC\n\nv. Their Workmen\n (supra) arising out the Jamdar and Tulpule Awards has not\n\n 40\n\n\f PART F\n\nnoticed the earlier decision dated 23 October 1992 of a three-judge Bench in E\n\nPrabavathy (supra).\n \nSubsequently, on 18 January 2011 in \nLIC v. D V Anil Kumar\n 31,\n\na two-judge Bench of this Court disposed of the appeal by accepting the terms of the\n\nscheme framed by LIC for the absorption of Class IV workers.\n \nThe attention of this\n\nCourt has also been drawn to an order dated 20 October 2016 of this Court in\n\nHashmuddin v. LIC\n 32 followed by an order dated 15 January 2020, which accepted\n\na scheme formulated by LIC for workers who had rendered service for more than\n\nsixteen years.\n\nF Submissions\n\n35 On behalf of LIC, Mr ANS Nadkarni, Senior Counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n (i) As a consequence of the Dogra Report, LIC would be required to regularise\n\n about 11,780 workers who claim to have worked for a limited number of days.\n\n No verification of these claims has been done either by the LIC or by the\n\n CGIT in the Dogra Report. This would amount to an illegal backdoor entry,\n\n which would be contrary to the statutory regulations framed by the LIC.\n\n Further, LIC would also face the issue of a lack of sanctioned posts for these\n\n workers;\n\n31\n\nCivil Appeal Nos 953-968 of 2005 (\n“LIC v. D V Anil Kumar”\n)\n\n32\n\n Civil Appeal No 2268 of 2011\n\n 41\n\n\f PART F\n\n(ii) The Tulpule Award dated 17 April 1986 and the Jamdar Award dated 26\n\n August 1988 directed the regularisation of persons working between 1\n\n January 1982 and 20 May 1985 who: (a) had worked as Class IV workers for\n\n a minimum period of 70 days in any three calendar years; or (b) had worked\n\n as Class III workers for a minimum period of 85 days in any two calendar\n\n years. However, these awards were substituted by a settlement which was\n\n arrived at in the civil appeals before this Court in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n\n (supra), which were finally adjudicated upon by an order dated 7 February\n\n 1996;\n\n(iii) Both the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards directed regularisation and absorption\n\n without verifying the existence of sanctioned posts. During the pendency of\n\n the litigation, LIC was injuncted from making fresh recruitment till the awards\n\n were pronounced. As a result of the interim orders dated 15 January 1986\n\n and 29 June 1987, LIC could not pursue an open, competitive and\n\n transparent process for selection on the basis of an advertisement followed by\n\n a written examination and interview. The last recruitment process took place\n\n in 1984, and till 1993 there was no fresh recruitment. This necessitated the\n\n making of temporary appointments between 1985 and 1991 to operate LIC’s\n\n 2048 branches across India;\n\n(iv) The Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001 arose out of a reference dated 4\n\n March 1991, which required the tribunal to adjudicate whether LIC’s action of\n\n not absorbing badli/temporary/part-time workers employed after 20 May 1985\n\n was justified. The award directed the absorption of “the concerned workmen”,\n\n 42\n\n\f PART F\n\n i.e., those employed after 20 May 1985 (and thus not covered by the Tulpule\n\n and Jamdar Awards) who had worked as Class III workers for a minimum of\n\n 85 days in two calendar years or who had worked as Class IV workers for a\n\n minimum of 70 days in three calendar years. The award directed that if\n\n regular vacancies did not exist to accommodate these persons,\n\n supernumerary posts would have to be created by LIC. Such a direction\n\n would be contrary to the principles which have been enunciated in the\n\n decision of this Court in ONGC v. Krishan Gopal 33. LIC as a statutory\n\n corporation is governed by its regulations, and no appointment beyond the\n\n vacancies in sanctioned posts can be made;\n\n \n(v) \nThe LIC Act\n was amended by Act 1 of 1981. The amendment to Section\n\n 48(2A) stipulates that the regulations which have been framed prior to 1981\n\n are deemed to be rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc). Further, Section\n\n 48(2C) stipulates that the rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc) would override\n\n the provisions of the \nID Act\n. The provision has been held to be constitutionally\n\n valid by this Court in \nM. Venugopal v. LIC\n 34;\n\n (vi) Though LIC is bound by the judgment of this Court in TN Terminated\n\n Employees Association (supra) which has restored the Srivastav Award\n\n (subject to its modification in the review petition in regards the quantum of\n\n back wages), it is also bound by:\n\n33\n\n 2020 SCC OnLine SC 150\n\n34\n\n (1994) 2 SCC 323 (“M. Venugopal”)\n\n 43\n\n\f PART F\n\n (a) The order dated 23 October 1992 of a three-judge Bench of this Court in E\n\n Prabavathy (supra) which upheld the scheme formed by LIC for\n\n absorption of ad hoc workers;\n\n (b) The order dated 22 November 2001 of a two-judge Bench of this Court in\n\n G Sudhakar (supra) which held that the scheme which was accepted in E\n\n Prabavathy (supra) would not be limited only to the workers in that case\n\n but would be applicable to all the workers of LIC in all its divisions across\n\n India; and\n\n \n(c) The settlement which substituted the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards, which\n\n was recorded by this Court while disposing of the civil appeals by its final\n\n order dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra);\n\n (vii) On 16 May 2017, LIC issued instructions under \nRegulation 4\n of its Staff\n\n Regulations to all Zonal Managers to implement the Srivastav Award and this\n\n Court’s orders. Consequently, 245 workers were offered absorption after\n\n being found eligible;\n\n (viii) In terms of the order of this Court dated 18 January 2011 in LIC of India v.\n\n \nD V Anil Kumar\n (supra), LIC framed a scheme to regularise Class IV workers\n\n who were engaged for 5 years or more and consequently, 4770 persons were\n\n appointed on regular posts;\n\n (v) Following the order of this Court dated 11 May 2018 in the contempt\n\n proceedings 35, LIC received 8300 representations from individuals claiming to\n\n be covered by the Srivastav Award, which were then scrutinised by a senior\n\n35\n\n Contempt Petition (Civil) No 1921 of 2017 in Civil Appeal No 6950 of 2009\n\n 44\n\n\f PART F\n\n officer. Subsequently, 76 claimants were found to be eligible for absorption in\n\n addition to the 245 individual claimants who had been absorbed earlier;\n\n(vi) By the order of this Court dated 7 September 2018 in the contempt\n\n proceedings arising out a review of \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n\n (supra), it was expressly made clear that:\n\n (a) The question whether the benefit of the Srivastav Award should be made\n\n available to those who were engaged as badli and temporary workers after\n\n 4 March 1991 is a matter for interpretation before this Court;\n\n (b) The CGIT would limit its inquiry only to the claims of the workers who were\n\n employed between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991; and\n\n (c) No case in contempt had been established;\n\n(vii) The above position is further clarified by this Court’s order dated 10\n\n September 2018 in the contempt proceedings arising out the review of \nTN\n\n Terminated Employees Association\n (supra), in terms of which CGIT was\n\n directed to verify the list which was available on its record. Thus, the CGIT\n\n was required to scrutinise the applications claiming the benefit of the award\n\n against the list of workers who were before the CGIT in the Srivastav Award.\n\n Hence, LIC scrutinized the claims of only those who were part of the certified\n\n list before the CGIT in the Srivastav Award and had worked between 20 May\n\n 1985 and 4 March 1991;\n\n(viii) All India Life Insurance Employees Association and Life Insurance\n\n Employees Association (R6 and R2 in the Dogra Report), All India Insurance\n\n Employees Association and Western Zone Insurance Employees Association\n\n 45\n\n\f PART F\n\n (R3 and R4 in the Dogra Report), National Organisation of Insurance Workers\n\n (R7 in the Dogra Report) and All India National Life Insurance Employees\n\n Federation (R9 in the Dogra Report) were all signatories to the compromise\n\n which substituted the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards and was noted in this\n\n Court’s interim order dated 1 March 1989 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra).\n\nFurther, by the order of this Court dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their\n\n Workmen\n (supra), the Karamchari Sangh (R10 in the Dogra Report) was also\n\n directed to follow the terms of compromise. Hence, these Unions and\n\n Associations who had entered into the compromise substituting the Tulpule\n\n and Jamdar Awards are governed by its terms;\n\n(ix) The scrutiny which was envisaged by the order of this Court required the\n\n CGIT to: firstly, check the presence of the names of the claimants in the CGIT\n\n list in the Srivastav Award; and secondly, conduct a verification of documents\n\n such as appointment letters, extension letters and relieving letters to\n\n scrutinise whether the claimants were actually employed for 70/85 days for\n\n three/two years respectively. Based on this scrutiny, the 321 eligible workers\n\n (245+76) who were beneficiaries of the Srivastav Award have already been\n\n absorbed, and any other claims by the workers individually or through the ten\n\n Unions are not maintainable;\n\n(x) The Dogra Report has erroneously held that the compromise which was\n\n arrived at between the parties was in addition to the rights declared in the\n\n Tulpule and Jamdar Awards. To support its reasoning, the Report relies on\n\n the findings of this Court at paragraph 39 to 41 of its judgment dated 18\n\n 46\n\n\f PART F\n\n March 2015 in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra).\n \nHowever,\n\n those observations have only adverted to the interim order dated 1 March\n\n 1989 of this Court in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra), and not its final order\n\n dated 7 February 1996;\n\n(xi) Instead of carrying out the task of verification, the Dogra Report only takes a\n\n prima facie view and has merely stated that the majority of the workers were\n\n eligible for absorption without carrying out the process of verification;\n\n(xii) Though the Unions have admitted that they do not possess either the\n\n residential addresses or other particulars of the claimants situated in various\n\n regions, the Dogra Report has found 1452 workmen to be eligible across the\n\n country; and\n\n(xiii) In summary, the Dogra Report is flawed because it:\n\n (a) Does not consider the CGIT certified list of the Srivastav Award, as\n\n directed in the order of this Court dated 10 September 2018;\n\n (b) Ignores that it was not carrying out an adjudicatory function but only a\n\n verification exercise;\n\n (c) Initially states that the claimants who had joined after 4 March 1991 are\n\n not being scrutinised, yet the final directions consider many such claims;\n\n and\n\n (d) Ignores paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award and gives benefit to persons\n\n who are governed by the scheme accepted by this Court in E Prabavathy\n\n (supra).\n\n 47\n\n\f PART F\n\n36 On behalf of the Unions, Associations and workers, arguments have been\n\naddressed by Dr Manish Singhvi, Mr Pallav Sishodia, Mr R Singaravelan, Mr V\n\nPrakash and Mr Salman Khurshid, Senior Counsel. In addition to the submissions of\n\nSenior Counsel, we have heard Mr Nandakumar, Mr Rakesh Shukla and Mr\n\nShailesh Madiyal. In addition, Counsel appearing on behalf of the workers in various\n\nMiscellaneous Applications have been furnished with an opportunity of being heard\n\nin seriatim. The submissions which have been urged on behalf of the workers are\n\nsummarised below:\n\n \n(i) The present proceedings in the Miscellaneous Applications pertain to the\n\n implementation of the Srivastav Award dated 22 June 2001. The Srivastav\n\n Award has been upheld in the decision of this Court in \nTN Terminated\n\n Employees Association\n (supra);\n\n \n(ii) The review petitions arising from the decision in \nTN Terminated Employees\n\n Association\n (supra) were dismissed by the judgment in \nT N Terminated Full\n\n Time Temporary LIC Employees Assn. v. LIC\n 36 and the curative petition\n\n was also dismissed on 22 February 2017. Thus, the Srivastav Award has\n\n attained finality subject to the modification that the quantum of back-wages\n\n has been reduced to fifty per cent. The doctrine of res judicata applies\n\n between the parties and at this stage, it would not be open to set aside or\n\n alter the contents of the award;\n\n36\n\n (2016) 9 SCC 366\n\n 48\n\n\f PART F\n\n(iii) Though the contempt petitions were disposed of, the CGIT was directed to\n\n look into the implementation of the Srivastav Award. The Dogra Report dated\n\n 31 May 2019 has been prepared by the CGIT in pursuance of the mandate of\n\n this Court;\n\n(iv) Four grounds have been advanced on behalf of LIC to assail the Dogra\n\n report:\n\n (a) No documents were produced to establish that the workers had worked for\n\n 85 days and 70 days across a period of two and three years respectively;\n\n (b) The Dogra Report had to consider only the CGIT certified list which was\n\n part of the reference proceedings;\n\n (c) The Srivastav Award would not apply to workers who commenced work\n\n after 4 March 1991; and\n\n (d) The Dogra Report also permits the absorption of the workers governed by\n\n the judgment of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra);\n\n(v) In response to the above grounds, it is submitted that the Dogra Report has\n\n correctly drawn an adverse inference against LIC for not producing the\n\n records which were in their possession, while approving the lists. Further, the\n\n report duly notes that a majority of the workers had produced documents,\n\n which have been accepted after verification;\n\n(vi) In the event, however, that this Court is inclined to remit the proceedings back\n\n for proper verification of the workers who are covered by the Srivastav Award,\n\n the following methodology should be adopted:\n\n 49\n\n\f PART F\n\n (a) LIC has now stated before this Court that its divisional offices are in\n\n possession of the records. LIC must produce in the first instance the\n\n records available with it for the purpose of verification; and\n\n (b) The verification to be carried out under the directions of this Court should\n\n not be confined to any particular document and the primary onus must lie\n\n on LIC to show whether the workers have actually worked during the\n\n relevant period;\n\n(vii) The Srivastav Award did not only deal with the cases of workers who had\n\n actually filed cases in the industrial reference. The award specifies that it\n\n would apply to all workers, and consequently directed that an advertisement\n\n be issued for that purpose. If the award was intended to be limited to the\n\n CGIT certified list, there was no occasion to direct a verification to be carried\n\n out by the CGIT since the certified list was already available with LIC. Hence,\n\n the direction in the order of this Court dated 10 September 2018 in the\n\n contempt proceedings arising out of the review of \nTN Terminated\n\n Employees Association\n (supra), that the verification would be carried out of\n\n the CGIT list, cannot be read out of context. Consistent with the principles of\n\n collective bargaining under the \nID Act\n, all workers who were beneficiaries of\n\n the Srivastav Award should be granted absorption;\n\n(viii) The plea that workers employed after 4 March 1991 are not entitled to relief\n\n under the Srivastav Award is contrary to the provisions of \nSection 18(3)(d)\n of\n\n the ID Act. The purpose of \nSection 18(3)(d)\n is to ensure that an award\n\n governs not only those who are in service when it is made but to subsequent\n\n 50\n\n\f PART F\n\n workers as well. In any event, at least those workers who were in employment\n\n on 18 June 2001, when the award was made, should be granted relief;\n\n(ix) The applicability of the orders of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra) and \nG\n\n Sudhakar\n (supra) has been considered in the judgment of this Court in \nTN\n\n Terminated Employees Association\n (supra), and that interpretation has\n\n attained finality. Hence, those orders ought not to become the basis to reopen\n\n the present proceedings;\n\n(x) As a matter of fact, the Dogra Report suffers from under-inclusion since the\n\n claims of workers who were engaged after 4 March 1991 have not been\n\n considered, though they may have applied in pursuance of the advertisement\n\n issued by the LIC to implement the Srivastav Award;\n\n(xi) The compromise which was arrived at before this Court, as noted in its orders\n\n dated 1 March 1989 and 7 February 1996, indicates that it was confined to\n\n persons who worked from 1 January 1982 to 20 May 1985. Hence, it has no\n\n relevance to the Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001, which relates to\n\n persons who were engaged after 20 May 1985;\n\n(xii) The terms of reference which resulted in the Srivastav Award related to the\n\n employment of badli, temporary and part-time workers after 20 May 1985.\n\n Consequently, there is no warrant for restricting the operation of the award to\n\n the period up to 4 March 1991 (which was the date of reference). The benefit\n\n of the award must enure not only to the workers who were engaged as\n\n temporaries or badlis after 20 May 1985 till the date of reference but the same\n\n principle must also apply to workers who have been engaged thereafter; and\n\n 51\n\n\f PART G\n\n (xiii) The judgment of this Court has directed the payment of fifty per cent back-\n\n wages. For the period after the date of the Srivastav Award, full back-wages\n\n should be granted to those who have been absorbed. Back-wages cannot be\n\n granted only for the period of 70/85 days, and at the rates which were made\n\n applicable to the badli workers.\n\n37 The rival submissions would now fall for analysis.\n\nG Prelude – Tulpule and Jamdar Awards, and their Aftermath\n\n38 The Tulpule Award dated 17 April 1986 was made in the context of a\n\nreference to the NIT pertaining to the absorption of badli/temporary/part-time\n\nworkers as regular employees of LIC. The award held that all workers who had\n\nworked in any capacity, temporary, badli or part-time, between 1 January 1982 till 20\n\nMay 1985, should be considered as eligible for absorption provided that: (a) Class IV\n\nworkers ought to have worked for 70 days in any three calendar years; and (b) Class\n\nIII workers ought to have worked for 85 days in any two calendar years.\n\n39 The Jamdar Award dated 26 August 1998 clarified the meaning of the Tulpule\n\nAward dated 17 April 1986. The award discussed the object of the earlier reference,\n\nand indicated that LIC had engaged badli/temporary/part-time workers on a large-\n\nscale and restricted their employment to a particular number of days in order to\n\nprevent them from gaining the status of permanency on the basis of the number of\n\ndays worked. Hence, it held that the object of the reference was to put an end to\n\n 52\n\n\f PART G\n\nsuch unfair legal practices, to regularise the employment of persons who would have\n\nbeen ordinarily absorbed but for such practices and to reduce to a minimum the\n\ndisproportionately large contingent of such employees who had been deprived of\n\nsecurity of service. The Jamdar Award noted that the Tulpule Award did not\n\ncontemplate that in computing the number of work days only the days worked in\n\ntwo/three consecutive calendars year should be taken into consideration. Further, it\n\nnoted that when the Tulpule Award spoke of “absorption”, it did not mean\n\n“recruitment”.\n\n40 The Tulpule and Jamdar Awards were the subject matter of a challenge\n\nbefore this Court under \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n\n(supra). On 1 March 1989, this Court while granting leave to appeal recorded that\n\neight out of the nine Unions, representing about 99 per cent of the workers, had\n\nentered into a compromise with LIC. It was in this backdrop that, pending the\n\ndisposal of the civil appeals, this Court permitted LIC and these eight Unions to\n\nimplement the terms of compromise, without prejudice to the rights of the ninth\n\nUnion. The terms of compromise envisaged that it would operate in substitution of\n\nthe Tulpule and Jamdar Awards on the question of the regular employment of the\n\nworkers concerned in those references. The terms of the compromise adopted the\n\nnorm of employment for 85 days in any two years for Class III workers and\n\nemployment for 70 days in any three calendar years for Class IV workers between 1\n\nJanuary 1982 and 20 May 1985. Temporary, part-time and badli workers who had\n\nmade applications before a stipulated date were held eligible to be considered for\n\n 53\n\n\f PART G\n\nregular employment. The compromise envisaged that the selection of candidates\n\nshall be made on the basis of qualifications, age, written test and interview, and also\n\nhaving regard to the number of days worked. According to the compromise, initially\n\na list of selected candidates was to be drawn up, from which regular employment\n\nwould be offered in order of merit prospectively from the dates notified, as and when\n\nvacancies in sanctioned posts for regular employment were filled up from time to\n\ntime. Further, as a result of the compromise, the process of recruitment for these\n\ncandidates would be subject to certain relaxations. Finally, it was envisaged that the\n\ndispute in relation to the workers concerned, which had resulted in the Tulpule and\n\nJamdar Awards, would no longer survive, and the rights and obligations of the\n\nparties in relation to regular employment would be governed only by the\n\ncompromise.\n\n41 The compromise was ultimately adopted in the final order of this Court dated\n\n7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra), which disposed of the civil\n\nappeals. In the order, this Court accepted the submission of LIC that since eight out\n\nof nine Unions (representing an overwhelming majority of workmen) had accepted\n\nthe compromise, the ninth Union must also act on the basis of its terms and\n\nconditions. The Court, however, directed that LIC shall exempt Class IV workers\n\n(whom the ninth Union was representing) from a test and interview, if it had the\n\npower to do so under the regulations and instructions governing their conditions of\n\nservice. In the alternative, if there was no such power, it directed that the test which\n\n 54\n\n\f PART G\n\nwas prescribed for these workers should be of a lower standard than the test\n\nprescribed in the two circulars mentioned in the compromise.\n\n42 There is absolutely no manner of doubt that the compromise which was\n\narrived at by eight out of nine Unions indicated that the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards\n\nwould stand substituted by the terms of the compromise. The compromise clearly\n\nstipulated that the workers who fulfilled the requisite days of work in Class III or, as\n\nthe case may be, Class IV posts would be eligible. As and when vacancies would\n\narise, they would be offered regular appointment.\n\n43 Prior to the final order of this Court in the civil appeals arising from the Tulpule\n\nand Jamdar Awards, the litigation in the E Prabavathy batch was settled by the order\n\ndated 23 October 1992. In the order, the Court found that the scheme for absorption\n\nwhich was propounded by LIC was reasonable. The scheme envisaged that all\n\ntemporary workers who had worked for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar\n\nyears with LIC between 20 May 1985 and 23 October 1992 and who conformed to\n\nthe required eligibility criteria for regular appointment on the date of their initial\n\nappointment, would be permitted to compete at the next regular recruitment to be\n\nmade by LIC. These candidates would be considered on their merit as against the\n\nother candidates who applied for these posts, including from the open market. They\n\nwould also be given an age relaxation while applying for a post, if they were eligible\n\nfor it on the date of their first temporary appointment. This scheme was approved,\n\nsubject to the postponement by at least six weeks of a recruitment scheduled for\n\nNovember 1992, in order to enable all eligible ad hoc workers to compete with\n\n 55\n\n\f PART G\n\nothers for selection at that recruitment. The decision in E Prabavathy (supra) was\n\nevidently not noticed in this Court’s order dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their\n\nWorkmen\n (supra).\n\n44 The order of a two-judge Bench of this Court dated 22 November 2001 in \nG\n\nSudhakar\n (supra) noted that in E Prabavathy (supra), a Bench of three-judges had\n\nembodied the clauses of the scheme as a part of their order.\n \nHence, the order in \nG\n\nSudhakar\n (supra) expressly clarified that though the scheme before this Court in E\n\nPrabavathy (supra) was evolved in relation to a case from the Tamil Nadu Division\n\nof the LIC, it would be equally applicable to the workers of all divisions of LIC in the\n\ncountry.\n \nConsequently, in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra), it was held that the scheme would\n\napply to workers who were before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh as well, and\n\nthere was no occasion for the High Court to direct that a new scheme should be\n\nframed by LIC.\n\n45 It is important to note that the orders of this Court dated 23 October 1992 (in\n\nE Prabavathy (supra)) and 7 February 1996 (disposing the civil appeals challenging\n\nthe Tulpule and Jamdar Awards) pre-date the Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001.\n\nOn the other hand, the order in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra), which was dated 22 November\n\n2001, was evidently passed after the Srivastav Award.\n\n 56\n\n\f PART H\n\nH Srivastav Award and the Judgement of this Court\n\n46 The reference before the tribunal leading up to the Srivastav Award was\n\nmade on 4 March 1991. The reference was in relation to the justification of LIC’s\n\nnon-absorption of persons recruited as temporary, badli and part-time workers after\n\n20 May 1985. The Srivastav Award contains an observation that LIC was not guilty\n\nof unfair labour practices by continuing persons recruited as temporary, badli and\n\npart-time workers as non-regular employees. The above observation in the award\n\nwas in view of the submission of LIC (which was not refuted by the workers) that the\n\nworkers were continuing in their positions on the basis of injunction orders issued by\n\ntribunals and the court, and due to the pressure of the Unions. However, the award\n\nalso noted that the terms of the reference did not encompass this aspect and the\n\ntribunal was not recording a finding.\n\n47 Paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award referred to the order of this Court dated\n\n23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra) which governed the scheme of\n\nabsorption/regularisation for that batch of workers. It noted that the E Prabavathy\n\ngroup of workers were impleaded to the proceedings leading to the award, and had\n\nfiled a statement of claim. However, the award concluded that since the order dated\n\n23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra) was between the same parties, the\n\nlegality of the order of this Court could not be challenged by the workers before the\n\ntribunal. Hence, the contention of the workers in that regard was not accepted.\n\n48 In paragraph 88, the Srivastav Award concluded:\n\n 57\n\n\f PART H\n\n “88. In view of the fact, I am of definite view that such type of\n workmen belonging to temporary and part time categories in\n class III and class IV service of corporation who were\n employed after following the procedure and were allowed to\n continue service beyond the qualifying period and were\n eligible and suitable in every respect should be given\n absorption in the service from date of the vacancy in the\n service in which they could have been absorbed. It will also\n apply to those such employees whose services were\n terminated by the corporation”\n\nThe award finds that LIC was not justified in denying absorption to those\n\ntemporary/badli/part-time workers who were employed after 20 May 1985, and that\n\nthey should be given absorption on the terms and conditions which were stipulated\n\nin the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards (which were in respect of workers employed\n\nbetween 1 January 1982 to 20 May 1985). LIC was directed to take into\n\nconsideration their claim for absorption on the basis of their eligibility and suitability,\n\nas dealt with in the Srivastav Award. Thus, all the badli, part-time and temporary\n\nworkers who have rendered the qualifying period of service and were suitable would\n\nalso have to be considered for absorption by LIC by publishing a notice in the\n\nnewspaper. The Srivastav Award directed that in case no regular vacancy was\n\navailable, supernumerary posts shall be created by LIC for the purpose of\n\nabsorption and that the case for absorption against existing vacancies would be\n\nconsidered first, irrespective of regular recruitment.\n\n49 The Srivastav Award was set aside by the Single Judge of the Delhi High\n\nCourt. The Division Bench affirmed the judgment of the Single Judge. Eventually,\n\n 58\n\n\f PART H\n\nthe dispute travelled to and resulted in the decision of this Court in \nTN Terminated\n\nEmployees Association\n (supra).\n\n50 The judgment in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra), dated 18\n\nMarch 2015, arose from concurring judgments of a Single Judge and of the Division\n\nBench of the Delhi High Court by which the Srivastav Award had been set aside. In\n\nappeal, the principal issue which came for consideration before this Court was:\n\n \n“34.1. (i) Whether the setting aside of the award passed by\n CGIT dated 18-6-2001 by the learned Single Judge by\n placing reliance upon compromise reached between the\n parties in SLP No. 14906 of 1988, which was filed against the\n award of Justice Tulpule, which award was clarified and\n affirmed by Justice SM Jamdar, legal and valid?”\n\nThe next issue, in relation to the workers’ claim for relief, was consequential in\n\nnature. After noticing the interim order dated 1 March 1989 passed by this Court in\n\nthe proceedings arising out of the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards in \nLIC v. Their\n\nWorkmen\n (supra), Justice Gopala Gowda, speaking for the two-judge Bench,\n\nobserved:\n\n “40. From the perusal of the above order of this Court\n in LIC v. Workmen [ SLP (C) No. 14906 of 1988, order dated\n 1-3-1989 (SC)] , nowhere has it been stated in the terms of\n the compromise between the parties that the award of Justice\n R.D. Tulpule dated 17-4-1986 which was clarified upon\n reference made by the Central Government under \nSection\n 36-A\n of the Act by Justice Jamdar, is either set aside by this\n Court or substituted the compromise terms in the place of the\n award except the order referred to supra passed in the above\n SLP No. 14906 of 1988. In fact, on the other hand it is clearly\n stated that the compromise terms are between the parties to\n the said SLP and that it shall not prejudice the respective\n rights and obligations in relation to the members of the other\n\n 59\n\n\f PART H\n\n union. \nTherefore, the effect of the award of Justice R.D.\n Tulpule with regard to the direction given to the Corporation\n regarding absorption of badli, temporary employees as\n permanent employees has not been substituted by terms and\n conditions of the compromise.”\n\nIn the above extract, the Court referred to the interim order of this Court dated 1\n\nMarch 1989 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra) by which, pending the disposal of the\n\nappeals, eight out of the nine Unions who had entered into terms of compromise\n\nwith LIC were permitted to implement it as an interim measure, without prejudice to\n\nthe rights and contentions of the remaining Union which had not entered into a\n\ncompromise. Relying exclusively on the interim order of this Court, it was held:\n\n “41. The award of Justice R.D. Tulpule dated 17-4-1986\n reiterated by way of clarification in the award passed by\n Justice Jamdar dated 26-8-1988, in the dispute subsequently\n has been operative even after the compromise arrived at\n between the parties to the compromise in LIC v. Workmen [\n SLP (C) No. 14906 of 1988, order dated 1-3-1989 (SC)]\n before this Court. Therefore, the contention of the learned\n Senior Counsel on behalf of the Corporation that the said\n awards are not in operation and that only the terms and\n conditions of compromise and orders of this Court are binding\n upon the workmen concerned in these appeals is both not\n factually and legally correct. This abovesaid argument of the\n learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the Corporation is not\n tenable in view of the categorical statement made by this\n Court in its orders passed in SLP referred to supra, wherein,\n this Court has permitted the management and members of\n the said 8 unions to implement the terms of compromise by\n way of interim measure without any prejudice to the rights\n and contentions of the members of other union who have not\n entered into compromise with the management of the\n Corporation. It is not the case of the Corporation in these\n appeals either before CGIT or before the High Court or in\n these proceedings the workmen concerned have also\n accepted the said terms and conditions of the compromise\n arrived at between the parties in SLP No. 14906 of 1988. This\n Court in the order passed in the abovesaid SLP which is\n\n 60\n\n\f PART H\n\n extracted hereinabove has made it very clear that the said\n compromise was entered into between unions therein, but it\n does not prejudice the rights and contentions of the workmen\n concerned whose disputes are in relation to their absorption\n in their respective posts who were appointed after 20-5-1985.\n Further, even if some of the workmen are bound under the\n said compromise that arose out of SLP No. 14906 of 1988,\n this in no way deters their right to raise an industrial dispute\n and get the same adjudicated vide order of reference by the\n appropriate Government to CGIT. The award of CGIT was\n concluded after rightly examining the facts, circumstances of\n the case and the legal principles laid down in the awards\n passed by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. More\n importantly CGIT award was passed after rightly appreciating\n the points of dispute referred to it and on the merits of the\n case.”\n\nThe interpretation of the interim order which has been placed by the Court emerges\n\nfrom the following extract:\n\n “46. Further, by a careful reading of the said order\n in LIC v. Workmen [ SLP (C) No. 14906 of 1988, order dated\n 1-3-1989 (SC)] , it has been made clear that the awards\n passed by NIT (by Justice Jamdar and Justice Tulpule) after\n adjudicating the points of dispute in the industrial dispute\n raised by similarly placed workmen is not disturbed by\n substituting the terms and conditions of compromise between\n the parties therein in SLP No. 14906 of 1988. Therefore, the\n awards in relation to the absorption of the workmen as\n permanent workmen in the Corporation have got statutory\n force. This is what is stated by CGIT in its award dated 18-6-\n 2001 on the basis of pleadings and evidence on record, which\n was erroneously set aside by the High Court by assigning\n erroneous reasons which is sought to be justified by the\n Senior Counsel on behalf of the Corporation by placing\n reliance upon the orders and the Scheme framed in E.\n Prabavathy [E. Prabavathy v. LIC, SLP (C) No. 10393 of\n 1992, order dated 23-10-1992 (SC)] and G. Sudhakar [ Civil\n Appeal No. 2104 of 2000, order dated 22-11-2001 (SC)]\n cases which Scheme has no application to the case of the\n workmen concerned involved in these appeals referred to\n supra.”\n\n 61\n\n\f PART H\n\n51 The Court proceeded to hold that both the award of Justice Tulpule, reiterated\n\nby way of the clarificatory award of Justice Jamdar, are operative and they have not\n\nbeen terminated by either of the parties as provided by \nSection 19(6)\n of the ID Act.\n\nThe Court held that the terms of compromise and the scheme formulated in E\n\nPrabavathy (supra) and \nG Sudhakar\n (supra) do not result in the substitution of the\n\nawards made by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. The Court held that the\n\nSrivastav Award would have to be observed by LIC until it was replaced by another\n\nsettlement in relation to the service conditions of the workers under \nSection 12\n read\n\nwith \nSection 18(3)\n of the ID Act or by another award following the termination of the\n\nawards which are in operation. The judgment of this Court concluded that:\n\n (i) The Tulpule and Jamdar Awards continue to remain operative;\n\n \n(ii) The Awards do not stand substituted by the interim order of this court dated 1\n\n March 1989 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra);\n\n (iii) The orders of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra) and G Sudhakar (supra)\n\n would not stand in the way of an adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal; and\n\n (iv) Unless the awards are substituted either by another award or settlement, the\n\n Tulpule and Jamdar Awards continue to remain operative and binding.\n\n52 On this basis, the Court concluded that the Srivastav Award was legal and\n\nvalid and shall be implemented by LIC by absorption of the workers concerned in\n\npermanent posts. The operative direction which was issued by this Court is\n\nextracted below:\n\n 62\n\n\f PART H\n\n “54. It is needless to mention that since we are of the view\n that the award passed by CGIT in ID No. 27 of 1991 is legal\n and valid, it shall be restored and implemented by the\n Corporation by absorbing the workmen concerned in the\n permanent posts and if they have attained the age of\n superannuation, the Corporation will be liable to pay all\n consequential benefits including the monetary benefits taking\n into consideration the pay scale and revised pay scale from\n time to time by the Corporation.”\n\n53 None of the Counsel appearing on behalf of the workers in the present batch\n\nof cases disputed the factual position, asserted on behalf of LIC, that the judgment\n\nof the two-judge Bench in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra)\n\naffirming the validity of the Srivastav Award contains no reference whatsoever to the\n\nfinal order dated 7 February 1996 in the batch of civil appeals arising from the\n\nTulpule and Jamdar Awards in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra).\n \nThe interim order\n\ndated 1 March 1989 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra), which forms the basis of the\n\njudgment in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra), was passed in the\n\nbackdrop of a compromise which was arrived between LIC and eight out of the nine\n\nUnions and Associations representing the workers. Since the appeals were pending\n\nat that stage, the Court granted liberty to the parties to the compromise to implement\n\nits terms as an interim measure, without prejudice to the contentions of the ninth\n\nUnion which had not entered into the compromise.\n \nBut noticeably, there is a clear\n\nomission on the part of the Court in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n\n(supra) to refer to the admitted position that subsequently on 7 February 1996, this\n\nCourt in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra) accepted the submission of LIC that since\n\neight out of the nine unions (representing nearly 99 per cent of the workers in Class\n\n 63\n\n\f PART H\n\nIII and Class IV posts) had accepted the compromise, there was no justification for\n\nthe ninth Union to object. The Court held that it would be in the interest of industrial\n\npeace that the ninth Union should also fall in line and act on the terms of the\n\ncompromise.\n \nThe civil appeals in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra) were disposed of in\n\nterms of the above order dated 7 February 1996. The terms of compromise clearly\n\nenvisaged that the management and the workers had agreed that the awards of the\n\nNIT dated 17 April 1986 (Tulpule Award) and 26 August 1988 (Jamdar Award) “be\n\nsubstituted by the terms and conditions of compromise in relation to the question of\n\nregular employment of the workmen concerned in the said references”.\n \nOnce the\n\nawards were substituted by the terms of compromise, it would be an impermissible\n\ninterpretation of law to hold that the awards continued to be operative and binding,\n\nnotwithstanding the final order of this Court dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their\n\nWorkmen\n (supra).\n \nThe final order dated 7 February 1996 has not been adverted to\n\nby the two-judge Bench in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra). The\n\nfactual finding is based only on the interim order dated 1 March 1989.\n \nThe final order\n\ndated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra) had a crucial bearing on\n\nthe special leave petitions arising from the judgment of the Delhi High Court setting\n\naside the Srivastav Award.\n\n54 That having been said, it is necessary to also advert to the interpretation\n\nwhich was placed on the decisions of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra) and \nG\n\nSudhakar\n (supra).\n \nThe two-judge Bench in \nTN Terminated Employees\n\nAssociation\n (supra) opined that the scheme which was framed in E Prabavathy\n\n 64\n\n\f PART H\n\n(supra) was the outcome of an order which was passed in writ petitions filed by the\n\nworkers and not in the course of the adjudication of an industrial dispute.\n On this\n\nground, the Court held that the decision in E Prabavathy (supra) would not come in\n\nthe way of an adjudication by the CGIT or NIT while deciding a reference under\n\nSection 10\n of the ID Act. The background of the decision in E Prabavathy (supra)\n\nhas already been noticed earlier. The decision was rendered on 23 October 1992 in\n\na batch of civil appeals which was being considered by a three-judge Bench. During\n\nthe pendency of the civil appeals, the Court called upon LIC to formulate a scheme\n\nfor the regularisation of workers who had been granted ad hoc employment for at\n\nleast 85 days from time to time. The three-judge Bench held, after assessing the\n\nterms of the scheme proposed by LIC, that it was reasonable and commended itself\n\nfor acceptance. The scheme proposed by LIC was approved by this Court with a\n\nspecific observation that the clauses of the scheme extracted in the order would\n\nform a part of the order of this Court. \nThe decision of three Judges in E Prabavathy\n\n(supra) was thereafter interpreted by a two-judge Bench in its order dated 22\n\nNovember 2001 in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra).\n Noticing that the scheme which has been\n\naccepted in E Prabavathy (supra) governed workers of the Tamil Nadu Division of\n\nLIC, the Court held that the scheme would be equally applicable to the workers of all\n\ndivisions of LIC in the country. The Court therefore held that it was not necessary to\n\nevolve a fresh scheme for a different group of workers, in that case under the\n\ndirections of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. As a matter of fact, it is also material to\n\nnote that in paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award itself there was a specific finding\n\nthat though the E Prabavathy group of workers had been impleaded in the reference\n\n 65\n\n\f PART H\n\nand had filed a statement of the claim, having regard to the fact that the order of this\n\nCourt dated 23 October 1992 was between the same parties, the workers had no\n\nvalid ground to challenge the legality of this Court’s order before the tribunal.\n\nDespite the clear observations in the Srivastav Award, the judgment of the two-judge\n\nBench in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) has come to the\n\nconclusion that the order of the three-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) would\n\nnot preclude an industrial adjudication by the tribunal.\n \nThe two-judge Bench which\n\ndelivered the judgment in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) was\n\nbound by the order in E Prabavathy (supra), which was of a larger Bench of three\n\njudges, and the interpretation which was placed on it by another two-judge Bench in\n\nG Sudhakar\n (supra). If the two-judge Bench differed, it had to refer the matter to a\n\nlarger Bench but it was not at liberty to take a final view at variance with binding\n\ndecisions of a larger Bench and of a co-ordinate Bench.\n\n55 A plea has been urged on behalf of the workers that the judgment in \nTN\n\nTerminated Employees Association\n (supra) has attained finality following the\n\ndismissal of the review petition on 9 August 2016 (save for the modification by which\n\nthe quantum of back-wages was reduced to fifty per cent) and the subsequent\n\ndismissal of a curative petition.\n \nWe are cognizant that the ground, submitting that the\n\ndecision ignored the final order dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n\n(supra), was specifically pleaded in review. The only observation in the judgment in\n\nreview is that LIC has not submitted anything on record to indicate that the judgment\n\n 66\n\n\f PART H\n\nsuffers from an error apparent in law. However, having regard to the immense\n\nfinancial burden, the quantum of back-wages would be reduced to fifty per cent.\n\n56 Now, there cannot be any dispute over the principle that the judgment in \nTN\n\nTerminated Employees Association\n (supra), followed by the order in review dated\n\n9 August 2016, are between the present parties and finality has attached to them.\n\nLIC is, however, before this Court urging that as a statutory entity with a nationwide\n\npresence, it is faced with a situation involving conflicting directions of this Court.\n \nLIC\n\nhas submitted that while on the one hand, the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards were\n\nsubstituted by the terms of compromise on 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their\n\nWorkmen\n (supra), this was preceded by the order dated 23 October 1992 of a\n\nthree-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) which accepted the scheme of\n\nabsorption proposed by LIC and followed by the order dated 28 November 2001 of a\n\ntwo-judge Bench in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra) which interpreted the decision in E\n\nPrabavathy (supra) as being applicable to all divisions of LIC.\n \nThe impact of the\n\njudgment in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) is to substitute and\n\nsupplant the schemes which were evolved before this Court for providing absorption\n\non specified terms. The essence of the schemes which were accepted by this Court\n\nwas that those temporary, badli and part-time workers who fulfilled the requirement\n\nof the threshold period of service would be eligible to be considered for the grant of\n\nthe permanency, subject to certain conditions. The orders passed by this Court\n\nenvisage that these workers would be considered for the grant of permanency in the\n\ncourse of a recruitment process.\n \nThe impact of the judgment of the two-judge Bench\n\n 67\n\n\f PART H\n\nin \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) is that while on the one hand\n\nthe Court’s orders dated 23 October 1992, 7 February 1996 and 22 November 2001\n\ncontinued to hold the field, on the other hand the restoration of the Srivastav Award\n\nbrings in place a regime in conflict with what has been accepted by this Court in\n\nthese orders.\n \nFaced with this predicament, it is necessary for this Court to step in\n\nand to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice caused by the decision in \nTN\n\nTerminated Employees Association\n (supra) which has been urged to be per\n\nincuriam. The consequence of not doing so is serious.\n\n57 The Court is now confronted with claims on behalf of the workers that the\n\nprinciple which has been enunciated in the Srivastav Award and which has been\n\nrestored by the two-judge Bench in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n\n(supra) must apply to all workers subsequently engaged by applying \nSection\n\n18(3)(d)\n read with \nSection 17A\n of the ID Act.\n \nHence, a balance will now have to be\n\ndrawn by this Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under \nArticle 142\n of the\n\nConstitution, which while on the one hand factors in the finality which has attached\n\nto the judgment in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) but on the\n\nother hand also factors in the essential concerns which have been expressed before\n\nthis Court by LIC. The formula of providing absorption to part-time, badli or\n\ntemporary workers who have put in 85 days in any two calendar years in a Class III\n\npost or 70 days in any three calendar years in a Class IV post will, unless a balance\n\nwere to be drawn, become an avenue for disregarding the need for an open and\n\ntransparent process of recruitment by a public sector corporation governed by the\n\n 68\n\n\f PART I\n\nrule of law and the mandate of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. The judgments\n\nof this Court, in the context of public employment, lay stress on providing equality of\n\nopportunity. As we have recorded earlier in the course of the statements of facts,\n\nLIC had been restrained, due to the interim orders which were passed in the course\n\nof the various proceedings, from taking recourse to recruitment through the open\n\nmarket. LIC having been restrained by judicial orders from pursuing an open\n\nrecruitment process, the situation which has now arisen is that unless a balance\n\nwere to be drawn, absorption of part-time and badli workers would become a\n\nsubstitute for a recruitment process based on sanctioned posts, consistent with the\n\nprinciples of reservation and pursued on the basis of a structured recruitment which\n\ngives equal opportunities to all applicants. Such a consequence is a serious\n\ndetriment to constitutional parameters and to the duty of LIC as a public employer to\n\nfollow a process which is fair and in consonance with \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n\nConstitution. An open and competitive process for recruitment will enable LIC to\n\nrecruit the best among the available talent. Substituting this by a back-door entry will\n\nbe detrimental to the interests of the corporation which is governed by statute.\n\nI Validity of the verification in the Dogra Report\n\n58 Mr ANS Nadkarni, Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of LIC, assailed the\n\nDogra Report on the ground that the remit before the CGIT was only to verify and\n\nnot to adjudicate.\n \nThere is no doubt about the premise that the task which was\n\n 69\n\n\f PART I\n\nentrusted to CGIT by the order of this Court dated 7 September 2018 in the\n\ncontempt proceedings arising out of the review of \nTN Terminated Employees\n\nAssociation\n (supra) was of verification. But it becomes necessary to consider\n\nwhether the remit to the CGIT was only confined to the certified list of workers in the\n\nindustrial reference. It is true that by the order of this Court dated 10 September\n\n2018, the CGIT was directed to verify the list on the record. However, an isolated\n\nsentence in the order of this Court cannot be read torn from its context. Paragraph\n\n94 of the Srivastav Award required LIC to also consider the case of those workers\n\nwho belonged to the temporary, badli and part-time category, who had completed\n\nthe qualified period of working and were suitable in every respect but whose\n\nservices had been terminated. LIC was directed to publish a notice in the daily\n\nnewspapers so as to enable such workers to lodge their claims for absorption. LIC\n\nissued a public notice in the newspapers on 21 July 2015. Each applicant was\n\nrequired to submit a form for being considered for absorption, of which item 10(b)\n\nrequired a disclosure of the details of the petition before the CGIT including whether\n\nthe applicant was a petitioner in the industrial reference. The crucial aspect,\n\nhowever, is that the verification which was carried out by the CGIT was not\n\nspecifically restricted to the certified list of workers. The judgment of this Court in the\n\ncourse of the proceedings in review, records the following submissions being made\n\non behalf of LIC:\n\n “6. The learned Attorney General further submits that as on\n 31-3-2015, LIC had 55, 427 Class III employees and 5190\n Class IV employees. If LIC is directed to consider the\n absorption of the workmen to the advertisement, then the\n\n 70\n\n\f PART I\n\n number of Class III employees will increase by 11.14% and\n Class IV employees by 56.65% and the same will affect the\n employee's ratio in addition to the increase in its financial\n burden and that the same will be contrary to the interests of\n the policy-holders. The learned Attorney General estimates\n the financial liability for implementing the order of this Court at\n approximately Rs 7087 crores, with the annual liability at\n around Rs 728 crores per year and that this will be a huge\n financial burden for LIC to bear.”\n\n The above submission indicates that if LIC were directed to consider the absorption\n\n of the workers pursuant to the advertisement, the strength of the Class III employees\n\n would increase by 11.1 per cent and Class IV employees by 56.65 per cent,\n\n resulting in an annual financial liability of Rs 728 crores. Hence, there is merit in the\n\n contention of the Counsel for the workers that the above submission, which is\n\n recorded in paragraph 6 of the judgment in review, does not comport with LIC’s\n\n present stance that the verification was to be confined only to the certified list.\n\n 59 This having been said, it is evident that the Dogra Report suffers from clear\n\n and manifest errors. As we have already noted earlier, LIC had drawn the attention\n\n of the Presiding Officer to the fact that the claims which had been submitted by the\n\n Unions, Associations and individual workers during the course of the verification\n\n contained duplicate entries. LIC has produced a chart containing details of various\n\n workers and claimants. For convenience of reference, the chart is extracted below:\n\nChart containing details of various Workmen/Claimants from various Associations before the Ld. CGIT Court, New\n Delhi in I.D.

By considering the workers who are governed by the order in E\n\n Prabavathy (supra) to be eligible for absorption, the Dogra Report has fallen into a\n\n clear error. The report has considered those workers who were clearly outside the\n\n ambit of its remit since they were governed by a specific order of this Court. That\n\n apart, it is evident that the Dogra Report has proceeded on a generalised\n\n assumption that a majority of workers had produced documents are eligible for\n\n absorption (having drawn a negative inference from LIC’s non-production of\n\n documents). In this backdrop, it would be necessary to bring about a proper\n\n verification before the claims of the workers can be truly considered. The deficiency\n\n of the Dogra Report in carrying out a proper verification stands clearly established.\n\n 73\n\n\f PART J\n\nJ The Interplay between the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n 1947 and \nSection\n\n48\n of the LIC Act 1956\n\n61 \nSection 48\n of the LIC Act confers a rule making power on the Central\n\nGovernment. Clause (cc) of sub-Section (2) of Section 48 was introduced by Act 1 of\n\n1981 with effect from 31 January 1981. Under clause (cc), the Central Government\n\nis empowered to frame rules dealing with the following matters:\n\n “(cc) the terms and conditions of service of the employees\n of the Corporation, including those who became employees of\n the Corporation on the appointed day under this Act;”\n\n62 Simultaneously by the \nAmending Act\n, sub-Sections (2A), (2B) and (2C) were\n\nintroduced into Section 48. These Sections provide as follows:\n\n “(2A) The regulations and other provisions as in force\n immediately before the commencement of the \nLife Insurance\n Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1981\n, with respect to the\n terms and conditions of service of employees and agents of\n the Corporation including those who became employees and\n agents of the Corporation on the appointed day under this\n Act, shall be deemed to be rules made under clause (cc) of\n sub-section (2) and shall, subject to the other provisions of\n this section, have effect accordingly.\n\n (2B) The power to make rules conferred by clause (cc) of\n sub-section (2) shall include-\n\n (i) The power to give retrospective effect to such rules;\n\n and\n\n (ii) The power to amend by way of addition, variation or\n repeal, the regulations and other provisions referred to in sub-\n section (2A), with retrospective effect, from a date not earlier\n than the twentieth day of June, 1979.\n\n \n(2C) The provisions of clause (cc) of sub-section (2) and sub-\n section (2B) and any rules made under the said clause (cc)\n\n 74\n\n\f PART J\n\n shall have effect, and any such rule made with retrospective\n effect from any date shall also be deemed to have had effect\n from that date, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\n of any court, tribunal or other authority and notwithstanding\n anything contained in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n (14 of\n 1947), or any other law or any agreement, settlement, award\n or other instrument for the time being in force.”\n\n63 By virtue of sub-Section (2A), the regulations governing the terms and\n\nconditions of service of the employees and agents of LIC which were in force\n\nimmediately before \nAmending Act\n 1 of 1981, are deemed to be rules made under\n\nclause (cc) of sub-Section (2) and have effect subject to the other provisions of the\n\nSection. By a deeming fiction of law, the regulations which were in existence on the\n\ndate of the \nAmending Act\n in relation to the terms and conditions of service are given\n\nthe status of rules framed under clause (cc) of sub-Section (2) of Section 48. The\n\neffect of sub-Section (2C) is that the provision of clause (cc) of sub-Section (2) and\n\nany rules made under it with retrospective effect, shall also be deemed to have had\n\neffect from that date notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court,\n\ntribunal or other authority and notwithstanding anything contained in the \nID Act\n, or in\n\nany other law or any agreement, settlement, award or other instrument for the time\n\nbeing in force. The rules which are framed under Section 48(2)(cc) operate with a\n\nnon-obstante clause which prevails, inter alia, notwithstanding anything contained in\n\nthe \nID Act\n. The vires of the \nAmending Act\n was upheld in a judgment of a three-judge\n\nBench of this Court in \nA V Nachane\n (supra). Justice A C Gupta, speaking for\n\nhimself and Justice R S Pathak (as the learned Chief Justice then was), repelled the\n\nchallenge to the validity of the \nAmending Act\n based on \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n 75\n\n\f PART J\n\nThe Court also rejected the submission that sub-Section (2C), which was introduced\n\ninto Section 48 by the \nAmending Act\n, suffered from the vice of excessive delegation.\n\nWhile upholding the \nAmending Act\n, the Court held:\n\n “8. The contention that \nArticle 14\n is infringed arises on the\n provision of sub-section (2-C) of Section 48 that any rule\n made under clause (cc) of sub-section (2) of that section\n touching the terms and conditions of service of the employees\n of the Corporation shall have effect notwithstanding anything\n contained in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n. It is true that\n after rules are made regarding the terms and conditions of\n service, the right to raise an industrial dispute in respect of\n matters dealt with by the rules will be taken away and to that\n extent the provisions of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n will cease\n to be applicable. It was argued that there was no basis on\n which the employees of the Corporation could be said to form\n a separate class for denying to them the protection of the\n \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n. The reply on behalf of the Union of\n India and the Life Insurance Corporation was that the\n remuneration that was being paid to Class III and Class IV\n employees of the Corporation was far in excess of what was\n paid to similarly situated employees in other establishments in\n the public sector. Some material was also furnished to\n support this claim though that were certainly not conclusive.\n The need for amending the \nLife Insurance Corporation Act,\n 1956\n as appearing from the preamble of the Amendment Act\n and the Ordinance is as follows: “... for securing the interests\n of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and its policy-\n holders and to control the cost of administration, it is\n necessary that revision of the terms and conditions of service\n applicable to the employees and agents of the Corporation\n should be undertaken expeditiously.” Referring to the\n preamble of the Act the Attorney-General appearing for the\n Union of India and the Corporation submitted that the problem\n of mounting cost of administration led to the making of the\n impugned law. He added that it was felt that no improvement\n in the situation was possible by the process of adjudication\n and a policy decision was taken that in the circumstances the\n proper course was legislation and that is why the Amendment\n Act was passed and the impugned Rules were framed. The\n learned Attorney-General submitted that it was for Parliament\n to decide whether the situation was remediable by\n adjudication or required legislation. According to him the Life\n\n 76\n\n\f PART J\n\n Insurance Corporation Act as amended and the Rules made\n after amendment placed the Corporation in the same position\n as other undertakings, that the advantages being enjoyed by\n the employees of the Corporation which were not available to\n similarly situated employees of other undertakings have been\n taken away removing what he described as discrimination in\n favour of the employees of the Life Insurance Corporation.\n We have already said that the material produced on behalf of\n the Union of India and the Corporation to show that the terms\n and conditions of service of the employees in several other\n undertakings in the public sector compared unfavourably to\n those of the Corporation employees was not conclusive. \nBut\n the burden of establishing hostile discrimination was on the\n petitioners who challenged the Amendment Act and the\n Rules. It was for them to show that the employees of the Life\n Insurance Corporation and the employees of the other\n establishments to whom the provisions of the \nIndustrial\n Disputes Act\n were applicable were similarly circumstanced to\n justify the contention that by excluding the employees of the\n Corporation from the purview of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n\n they had been discriminated against. There is no material\n before us on the basis of which we can hold that the\n Amendment Act of 1981 and the Rules made on February 2,\n 1981 infringe \nArticle 14.\n We do not think that on the facts of\n this case \nExpress Newspapers (Private) Ltd. v. Union of\n India\n [AIR 1958 SC 578 : 1959 SCR 12 : (\n1961) 1 LLJ 339] ,\n and Moti Ram Deka v. General Manager\n [AIR 1964 SC 600 :\n\n (1964) 5 SCR 683 : (1964) 2 LLJ 467] relied on by the\n petitioners, have any application.”\n\n64 The Court, however, held that Rule 3 of the Life Insurance Corporation of\n\nIndia Class III and Class IV Employees (Bonus and Dearness Allowance) Rules\n\n1981 37 could not nullify the effect of a writ issued by this Court in its earlier decision\n\nin \nLIC v. D.J. Bahadur\n 38, which directed LIC to give effect to the industrial\n\nsettlement relating to bonus until superseded by a fresh settlement, award or\n\nlegislation. Holding that the \nAmending Act\n of 1981 and the Bonus Rules were\n\n37\n\n “Bonus Rules”\n\n38\n\n (1981) 1 SCC 315\n\n 77\n\n\f PART J\n\nrelevant legislation, the Court held that these would operative prospectively from the\n\ndate of the publication of the rules. There was also a concurring opinion of Justice O\n\nChinappa Reddy. While dealing with the constitutional validity under \nArticle 14\n, the\n\nmain judgment notes that after rules are made regarding the terms and conditions of\n\nservice, the right to raise an industrial dispute in respect of matters dealt with by the\n\nrules is taken away and to that extent the provisions of the \nID Act\n will cease to be\n\napplicable.\n\n65 In the subsequent decision of another Bench of three-judges of this Court in\n\nM Venugopal\n (supra), the impact of the \nAmending Act\n of 1981 on the application of\n\nthe \nID Act\n came up for consideration. The services of the appellant, who was a\n\nprobationary Development Officer in LIC, were terminated on his failure to fulfil the\n\ntargets assigned. A writ petition challenging the termination was allowed by a Single\n\nJudge of the High Court on the ground that the termination amounted to a\n\nretrenchment within the meaning of \nSection 2(oo)\n of the ID Act, and that the\n\ntermination was void due to the failure to comply with \nSection 25F\n. In appeal, the\n\nDivision Bench held that as a result of clause (bb) which was introduced in \nSection\n\n2(oo)\n from 18 August 1984, the termination of a probationer would not amount to a\n\nretrenchment within the meaning of \nSection 2(oo)\n. \nRegulation 14(2)\n of the Staff\n\nRegulations was, as a consequence of Section 48(2A) as introduced by the\n\nAmending Act\n, deemed to be rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc). Clause (4) of\n\nRegulation 14\n permitted LIC to discharge an employee during the period of\n\nprobation. Before the introduction of clause (bb) in \nSection 2(oo)\n of the ID Act, there\n\n 78\n\n\f PART J\n\nwere only three exceptions which excluded a termination of service from the ambit of\n\nretrenchment, namely:\n\n (i) Voluntary retirement;\n\n (ii) Retirement on superannuation; and\n\n (iii) Termination due to continued ill-health.\n\nAfter the introduction of clause (bb), Parliament excluded from the purview of\n\nretrenchment, in addition, the following:\n\n (i) Termination as a result of the non-renewal of a contract of employment upon\n\n its expiry; and\n\n (ii) Termination of a contract under a stipulation in that behalf contained in the\n\n contract of employment.\n\nIt was held that in this case the termination of the services of the probationer was in\n\nterms of the contract of an employment in terms of the stipulation contained in\n\nRegulation 14\n, and hence non-compliance with \nSection 25F\n would not vitiate the\n\norders of termination.\n\n66 Justice N P Singh, speaking for the three-judge Bench, then went on to\n\nelucidate on the impact of \nAmending Act\n 1 of 1981, more particularly the insertion of\n\nclause (cc) into sub-Section (2) and the insertion of sub-Sections (2A), (2B) and (2C)\n\nin Section 48. The Court held that the ID Act and the LIC Act have both been framed\n\nby Parliament, with the amendments introduced from 31 January 1981 in Section 48\n\n 79\n\n\f PART J\n\ncontaining a non-obstante clause in sub-Section (2C) making the intent of\n\nParliament “apparent and obvious”. The Court held:\n\n “The framers of the Corporation Act through the amendments\n aforesaid have given the provisions of the Corporation Act an\n overriding effect over the provisions of the \nIndustrial Disputes\n Act\n, so far as the provisions relating to the terms and\n conditions of employment, which are in conflict with the\n provisions of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n are concerned.\n Unless the said attempt is held to be ultra vires being in\n conflict with any of the provisions of the Constitution it was\n open to the Parliament to treat the employees and agents of\n the Corporation as a separate class for purpose of fixing their\n terms and conditions of service.”\n\n67 The Court held that earlier the employees were governed by the regulations\n\nframed by LIC under Section 49 as well as by the provisions of the \nID Act\n. Hence, it\n\nwas open to the workers to enforce their rights and remedies in terms of the\n\nregulations framed under the \nLIC Act\n or in accordance with the provisions of \nID Act\n.\n\nHowever, after the amendments which were introduced by Parliament in Section 48,\n\nthe employees of LIC would not be entitled to the protection of the \nID Act\n to which\n\nthey were entitled before the enforcement of the amendment. The Court held that\n\nthe validity of the amendment had been upheld in the earlier decision in \nA V\n\nNachane\n (supra), and concluded:\n\n “14. The amendments introduced in Section 48 of the\n Corporation Act have clearly excluded the provisions of the\n \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n so far as they are in conflict with the\n rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc). The result whereof will\n be that termination of the service of the appellant shall not be\n deemed to be a “retrenchment” within the meaning of \nSection\n 2(oo)\n even if sub-section (bb) had not been introduced in the\n said section. Once \nSection 2(oo)\n is not attracted, there is no\n question of application of \nSection 25-F\n on the basis of which\n\n 80\n\n\f PART J\n\n the termination of the service of the appellant can be held to\n be invalid. The termination of the service of the appellant\n during the period of probation is in terms of the order of\n appointment read with \nRegulation 14\n of the Regulations,\n which shall be deemed to be now Rules under Section\n 48(2)(cc) of the Corporation Act.”\n\n68 Therefore, in view of the amended provisions of Section 48(2A) and (2C), the\n\ntermination of the service of the appellant was held not to amount to a retrenchment\n\neven when clause (bb) had not been introduced in \nSection 2(oo)\n of the ID Act. Since\n\nSection 2(oo)\n would anyways not stand attracted where the services of a\n\nprobationer were terminated under \nRegulation 14(4)\n of the Staff Regulations which,\n\ndeemed to be a part of the rules under Section 48(2)(cc), has an overriding effect\n\nover the \nID Act\n and would prevail.\n\n69 The above provisions of Section 48 were specifically placed before the two-\n\njudge Bench of this Court, as is evident from a bare reading of the judgment in \nTN\n\nTerminated Employees Association\n (supra). However, the Court declined to go\n\ninto the submission based on the provisions of Section 48, holding that the Staff\n\nRegulations provided only two types of employment: (i) Regular; and (ii) Temporary.\n\nThe Court held that employment in the capacity of badli/part-time workers was not\n\nprovided in the Staff Regulations, and there was no specific nomenclature of that\n\nnature in the Staff Regulations.\n \nThe decision of the two-judge Bench evidently does\n\nnot notice either the judgment in \nA V Nachane\n (supra) or the decision in \nM\n\nVenugopal\n (supra), both of which have been delivered by three-judge Benches.\n\nThey are binding precedents and could not have been brushed aside.\n\n 81\n\n\f PART J\n\n70 That apart, it becomes necessary at this stage to advert to the provisions of\n\nRegulation 8\n of the Staff Regulations. \nRegulation 8(1)\n deals with temporary staff and\n\nis prefaced with a non-obstante provision. Clause (1) of \nRegulation 8\n is an enabling\n\nprovision empowering LIC to employ staff in Classes III and IV on a temporary basis,\n\nsubject to such general or specific directions which may be issued by the\n\nChairperson from time to time. Clause (2) of \nRegulation 8\n stipulates that no person\n\nwho is appointed under \nRegulation 8(1)\n is, only by reason of such appointment, to\n\nbe entitled to absorption in the service of LIC or to claim preference for recruitment\n\nto any post. The expression “shall only by reason of such appointment be entitled to\n\nabsorption” in this sub-clause (2) is crucial. What the expression postulates is that a\n\nperson who is appointed on a temporary basis can nether claim an entitlement to\n\nabsorption or a preference in recruitment merely by having been appointed on a\n\ntemporary basis. In other words, \nRegulation 8(2)\n does not postulate an absolute bar\n\nto a claim for absorption but it stipulates that absorption cannot be claimed merely\n\non the ground that a person was engaged on a temporary basis. \nRegulation 8(2)\n, for\n\ninstance, will not preclude a claim for absorption being made in terms of a scheme\n\nwhich is propounded by LIC, so long as the scheme contains provisions which\n\nfacilitate absorption on stipulated terms and conditions. But the mere fact that a\n\nperson is appointed in a temporary capacity by LIC, does not entitle such a person\n\nipso jure to seek absorption merely by virtue of or only by reason of such an\n\nappointment.\n\n 82\n\n\f PART J\n\n71 The impact of the provisions of clause (cc) of sub-Section (2), sub-Section\n\n(2A) and sub-Section (2C) of Section 48 on the clams of the workers appointed after\n\n4 March 1991 must now be considered. The workers who have worked as\n\ntemporary, badli or part-time workers after 4 March 1991, seek to assert their claims\n\non the basis of \nSection 18(3)(d)\n of the ID Act. \nSection 18\n specifies the person on\n\nwhom settlements and awards are binding. \nSection 18(3)(a)\n stipulates that a\n\nsettlement or award would bind all the parties to the industrial dispute. Further,\n\nclause (d) specifies that where a party to the dispute is composed of workers, the\n\nsettlement and award binds not only persons who are employed in the\n\nestablishment to which the dispute relates on the date of the dispute but all persons\n\nwho subsequently become employees in that establishment or a part of it. \nSection\n\n18(3)(d)\n, in other words, extends the applicability of a settlement or award beyond\n\nthe workers who were engaged on the date of the dispute to all persons who\n\nsubsequently become employees in the establishment. \nRegulation 8\n of the Staff\n\nRegulation expressly permits the engagement of temporary workers and clause (2)\n\ncontains a provision to the effect that a person who engaged under its clause (1)\n\nshall not, only by reason of such appointment, be entitled to absorption or to claim a\n\npreference for recruitment on any post. The effect of sub-Section (2A) of Section 48\n\nis that \nRegulation 8\n is deemed to be a rule which is framed under clause (cc) of sub-\n\nSection (2) of Section 48. Moreover, the provisions of Section 48(2C) postulate that\n\na rule which is made under the clause shall have effect notwithstanding anything\n\ncontained in the \nID Act\n. Hence, the workers who have been recruited post 4 March\n\n1991 cannot make a claim for absorption ipso jure under \nSection 18(3)(d)\n of the ID\n\n 83\n\nPART K\n\nAct\n, as a result of the overriding provision which is contained in sub-Section (2C) of\n\nSection 48.\n\nK Structuring the Relief\n\n72 For the reasons recorded above during the course of analysis, LIC as a\n\nstatutory corporation is bound by the mandate of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n\nConstitution. As a public employer, the recruitment process of the corporation must\n\nmeet the constitutional standard of a fair and open process. Allowing for back-door\n\nentries into service is an anathema to public service.\n\n73 In structuring the relief in present proceedings, it is essential to recapitulate\n\nthe key legal findings that will govern the determination of rights and equities:\n\n \n(i) On 7 February 1996, a two-judge Bench of this Court in \nLIC v. Their\n\n Workmen\n (supra) had accepted the terms of compromise which was arrived\n\n at on 1 March 1989 between the management of LIC and eight Unions, and\n\n imposed them upon the ninth Union as well. In addition, the two-judge Bench\n\n of this Court had issued certain directions:\n\n (a) LIC should exempt Class IV workers from a test and interview, if the\n\n management has the power to do so under the regulations/instructions\n\n governing their conditions of service; and\n\n (b) In the event that the management of LIC does not possess such a power,\n\n the test to be prescribed for these workers would be of a lesser standard\n\n 84\n\n\f PART K\n\n compared to other applicants from the open market till the next regular\n\n recruitment;\n\n(ii) On 23 October 1992, a three-judge Bench of this Court, while disposing of the\n\n civil appeals in E Prabavathy (supra), specifically accepted the scheme\n\n formulated by LIC for regularising the workers who were engaged on a\n\n temporary basis. The scheme was also specifically incorporated as a part of\n\n the order in the following terms:\n\n “(a) All those temporary employees who have worked for 85\n days in any two consecutive calendar years with the Life\n Insurance Corporation between 20th May 1985 uptil date and\n who confirmed to tehe required eligibility criteria for regular\n recruitment on the dates of their initial temporary appointment\n will be permitted to complete for the next regular recruitment\n to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation after the regular\n recruitment for these posts currently scheduled for November,\n 1992.\n\n (b) These candidates will be considered on their merits with\n all other candidates who may apply for such appointments,\n including those from the open market.\n\n (c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation for\n applying for regular recruitment provided that they were\n eligible on the date of their first temporary appointment for\n securing regular appointment with the Life Insurance\n Corporation.\n\n (d) If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can\n apply for regular recruitment in the normal course. This\n regularisation will, in the circumstances, be by selection for\n appointment. We make the above clauses of the scheme as\n part of our order.”\n\n The three-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) held that the scheme\n\n proposed by LIC is reasonable and that: (a) the regularisation will be by\n\n 85\n\n\f PART K\n\n selection for appointment; and (b) the above clauses of the scheme would\n\n constitute a part of the order of this Court;\n\n(iii) On 22 November 2001, a two-judge Bench of this Court in \nG Sudhakar\n\n (supra) directed that though the order dated 23 October 1992 in E\n\n Prabavathy (supra) applied to the workers of the Tamil Nadu division, the\n\n scheme would equally be applicable to the workers of all divisions of LIC in\n\n the country;\n\n(iv) The judgment of the two-judge Bench of this Court dated 8 March 2015 in \nTN\n\n Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) failed to notice that as a result\n\n of the final order dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their Workmen\n (supra),\n\n the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards had been substituted by the terms of\n\n compromise.\n The two-judge Bench of this Court overlooked the final order\n\n dated 7 February 1996 in LIC v. Their Workmen (supra) and while adverting\n\n only to the interim order dated 1 March 1989, it arrived at a palpably\n\n erroneous conclusion that the Jamdar and Tulpule Awards were still operative\n\n and binding; and\n\n(v) Though the petition seeking review of \nTN Terminated Employees\n\n Association\n (supra) and the curative petition stand dismissed, LIC is\n\n confronted with a situation in which it is equally bound by the earlier decision\n\n of the three-judge Bench dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra), the\n\n judgment of the two-judge Bench dated 7 February 1996 in \nLIC v. Their\n\n Workmen\n (supra) dealing with the appeals arising out of the Tulpule and\n\n 86\n\n\f PART K\n\n Jamdar Awards and the judgment of the two-judge Bench dated 22 November\n\n 2001 in \nG Sudhakar\n (supra).\n\n74 The position as it now stands, results in a palpable conflict between the two-\n\njudge Bench decision in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n (supra) dated 18\n\nMarch 2015 on the one hand and the earlier binding decision of a larger Bench in E\n\nPrabavathy (supra) on 23 October 1992 and of subsequent Benches. This conflict\n\nmust be harmonised by taking recourse to the jurisdiction of this Court under \nArticle\n\n142\n of the Constitution. In arriving at a conclusion, this Court finds that:\n\n (i) The remit of the CGIT which resulted in the Dogra Report was confined to the\n\n process of verification, as distinct from an adjudication of rights and liabilities;\n\n (ii) The Dogra Report is flawed because:\n\n (a) The report failed to carry out an accurate verification of only those Class III\n\n workers who had put in at least 85 days of work in a period of two years\n\n and Class IV workers who had put in 70 days of work in a period of three\n\n years;\n\n (b) The lists which are appended to the report contain patent inconsistencies\n\n and errors as a consequence of a failure to carry out an adequate\n\n verification; and\n\n (c) The report accepted the claims for absorption of those workers who were\n\n specifically governed by the decision of this Court in E Prabavathy\n\n (supra), in spite of an express stipulation to the contrary in the order of this\n\n 87\n\n\f PART K\n\n Court dated 23 October 1992 as well as in paragraph 75 of the Srivastav\n\n Award;\n\n (iii) A public employer such as LIC cannot be directed to carry out a mass\n\n absorption of over 11,000 workers on such flawed premises without following\n\n a recruitment process which is consistent with the principles of equality of\n\n opportunity governed by \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. Such an\n\n absorption would provide the very back-door entry, which negates the\n\n principle of equal opportunity and fairness in public employment, which has\n\n been specifically decried by this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka v.\n\n Umadevi 39.\n\n75 The dispute is now of an antiquity tracing back to nearly four decades. Finality\n\nhas to be wrung down on the dispute to avoid uncertainty and more litigation. Nearly\n\nthirty-one years have elapsed since 1991. We have come to the conclusion that the\n\nclaims of those workers who are duly found upon verification to meet the threshold\n\nconditions of eligibility should be resolved by the award of monetary compensation\n\nin lieu of absorption, and in full and final settlement of all claims and demands. Thus,\n\nthis Court directs the following:\n\n (i) A fresh verification of the claims of workers who claim to have been employed\n\n for at least 70 days in Class IV posts over a period of three years or 85 days\n\n in Class III posts over a period of two years shall be carried out;\n\n39\n\n (2006) 4 SCC 1\n\n 88\n\n\f PART K\n\n(ii) The verification shall be confined to persons who were working between 20\n\n May 1985 and 4 March 1991;\n\n(iii) All persons who are found to be eligible on the above norm shall be entitled to\n\n compensation computed at the rate of Rs 50,000 for every year of service or\n\n part thereof. The payment of compensation at the above rate shall be in lieu\n\n of reinstatement, and in full and final settlement of all claims and demands of\n\n the workers in lieu of regularisation or absorption and notwithstanding the\n\n directions issued by this Court in \nTN Terminated Employees Association\n\n (supra);\n\n(iv) In carrying out the process of verification, the Committee appointed by this\n\n Court shall not be confined to the certified list before the CGIT and shall\n\n consider the claims of all workers who were engaged between 20 May 1985\n\n and 4 March 1991;\n\n(v) For the purpose of verification, LIC shall make available all the records at the\n\n Divisional level to the Committee appointed by this Court;\n\n(vi) It will be open to the workers concerned or, as the case may be, the Unions\n\n and Associations representing them, to make available such documentary\n\n material in their possession for the purpose of verification;\n\n(vii) The process of verification shall be carried out independently without regard\n\n to the Dogra Report, which is held to be flawed;\n\n(viii) The payment of compensation in lieu of reinstatement shall be effected by\n\n LIC within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the report of\n\n verification by the Committee; and\n\n 89\n\n\f PART K\n\n (ix) The task of verification shall be carried out by a Committee consisting of:\n\n (a) Mr Justice P K S Baghel, former Judge of the Allahabad High Court; and\n\n (b) Shri Rajiv Sharma, former District Judge and member of the UPHJS.\n\nLIC shall provide all logistical assistance to the Committee and bear all expenses,\n\nincluding secretarial expenses, travel and incidental expenses, as well as the fees\n\npayable to the members of the Committee. Justice P K S Baghel shall fix the terms\n\nof remuneration payable to the members of the Committee.\n\n76 The Miscellaneous Applications and the Writ Petitions shall be governed by\n\nthe above directions and are disposed of in the above terms.\n\n77 Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.\n\n …….…………………………...............................J.\n [Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\n\n …….…………………………...............................J.\n [Surya Kant]\n\n …….…………………………...............................J.\n [Vikram Nath]\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nApril 27, 2022\n\n 90",

The contention that \nArticle 14\n is infringed arises on the\n provision of sub-section (2-C) of Section 48 that any rule\n made under clause (cc) of sub-section (2) of that section\n touching the terms and conditions of service of the employees\n of the Corporation shall have effect notwithstanding anything\n contained in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n. It is true that\n after rules are made regarding the terms and conditions of\n service, the right to raise an industrial dispute in respect of\n matters dealt with by the rules will be taken away and to that\n extent the provisions of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n will cease\n to be applicable. It was argued that there was no basis on\n which the employees of the Corporation could be said to form\n a separate class for denying to them the protection of the\n \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n. The reply on behalf of the Union of\n India and the Life Insurance Corporation was that the\n remuneration that was being paid to Class III and Class IV\n employees of the Corporation was far in excess of what was\n paid to similarly situated employees in other establishments in\n the public sector. Some material was also furnished to\n support this claim though that were certainly not conclusive.\n The need for amending the \nLife Insurance Corporation Act,\n 1956\n as appearing from the preamble of the Amendment Act\n and the Ordinance is as follows: “... for securing the interests\n of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and its policy-\n holders and to control the cost of administration, it is\n necessary that revision of the terms and conditions of service\n applicable to the employees and agents of the Corporation\n should be undertaken expeditiously.” Referring to the\n preamble of the Act the Attorney-General appearing for the\n Union of India and the Corporation submitted that the problem\n of mounting cost of administration led to the making of the\n impugned law. He added that it was felt that no improvement\n in the situation was possible by the process of adjudication\n and a policy decision was taken that in the circumstances the\n proper course was legislation and that is why the Amendment\n Act was passed and the impugned Rules were framed. The\n learned Attorney-General submitted that it was for Parliament\n to decide whether the situation was remediable by\n adjudication or required legislation. According to him the Life"
