While the order of the Appellate Authority confirming the order\n\n passed by the Controlling Authority, is under challenge in W.P.No.21456 of\n\n 2013, the order passed by the Controlling Authority is directly under\n\n challenge in W.P.No.23449 of 2013.\n\n 3. Since the issue involved in these Writ Petitions is one and the\n\n same, the cases are taken up for disposal by a common order.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.4 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n 4. According to the Petitioner-Bank, Respondents 3 to 11 in\n\n W.P.No.21456 of 2013 and Respondents 2 to 42 in W.P.No.23449 of 2013 were\n\n employees of the Petitioner-Bank and they had retired from service on\n\n attaining superannuation on various dates. It is further stated that the\n\n retired employees received entire gratuity due to them, as per the\n\n Settlement dated 26.02.1997, without any limitation, either fixed by the Act\n\n or under the Group Gratuity Scheme. However, they filed Applications\n\n before the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Coimbatore, claiming that,\n\n they are entitled to receive further amount of gratuity, notwithstanding the\n\n claim made already, as per the Settlement dated 26.02.1997.\n\n 5. It is the case of the Petitioner-Bank that, in both Writ Petitions,\n\n the Controlling Authority, without considering the Settlement dated\n\n 26.02.1997 in a proper perspective, accepted the claim of the retired\n\n employees, as also the method adopted by them in calculating the length of\n\n service, and ordered to pay the difference of gratuity amount, with interest\n\n at the rate of 10% from the date of Applications.\n\n 6. According to the learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank, in\n\n terms of \nSection 4(5)\n of the Gratuity Act, workmen cannot be permitted to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.5 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n adjudicate their remedy before the Controlling Authority, and their rights are\n\n elsewhere. Having signed the Settlement with open eyes, and having\n\n enjoyed the benefits of the linked Insurance Scheme and received the\n\n gratuity amount, retired employees herein cannot adjudicate the issue, more\n\n particularly, before the Authority under the \nGratuity Act\n.\n\n 7. Learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank went on to state that,\n\n as per the linked Gratuity Scheme adopted by virtue of the Settlement dated\n\n 26.02.1997, an employee is entitled to get 15 days' wages for every\n\n completed year, as gratuity, subject to a maximum of the amount equalling\n\n to 20 months' salary. Further, as per the terms of the Settlement, for the\n\n purpose of calculation of Gratuity, 26 days will be reckoned as a month not\n\n only for arriving at pay, but also for calculation of length of service.\n\n 8. Learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to the\n\n Explanation clause inserted in \nSection 4\n of the Gratuity Act, which reads\n\n that \"In case of a monthly-rated employee, the 15 days' wages shall be\n\n calculated by dividing the monthly rate of wages last drawn by him by\n\n dividing 26 and multiplying the quotient by 15.” Thus, according to the\n\n learned counsel, the terms of the Settlement dated 26.02.1997 were\n\n incorporated, in conformity with the Explanation inserted in \nSection 4\n of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.6 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n \nGratuity Act\n, for the purpose of calculating one day salary, and 20 months'\n\n salary, which is the maximum ceiling during the relevant period.\n\n 9. Learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank pointed out that, the\n\n employees herein misconstrued the terms of the Settlement, as if, every 26\n\n days will form a month and as such, the calculation of length of service\n\n would be long than the actual working years. According to him, if such\n\n method is adopted, then, a year with 365 days would have 14 months, and\n\n the same would lead to absurdity.\n\n 10. In support of his stand, learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank\n\n has relied on the following:\n\n \n(i) an Apex Court decision in the case of \nAllahabad Bank vs. All\n\n India Allahabad Bank Retired Employees Association\n, 2010 (2) SCC 44\n\n “43. The scheme envisaged under \nSection 7\n of\n the Act is that in case of any dispute as to the amount of\n gratuity payable to an employee under the Act or as to the\n admissibility of any claim of, or in relation to, an\n employee payable to gratuity, etc. the employer is\n required to deposit with the Controlling Authority the\n admitted amount payable as gratuity. In case of any\n dispute, the parties may make an application to the\n Controlling Authority for deciding the dispute who after\n due inquiry and after giving the parties to the dispute, a\n reasonable opportunity of being heard, determine the\n matter or matters in dispute and if, as a result of such\n inquiry any amount is found to be payable to the\n employee, the Controlling Authority shall direct the\n employer to pay such amount to the employee.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.7 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n 44. Sub-section (7) of \nSection 7\n provides for an\n appeal against the order of the Controlling Authority. \nThe\n Act\n nowhere confers any jurisdiction upon the Controlling\n Authority to deal with any issue under sub-section (5) of\n \nSection 4\n as to whether the terms of gratuity payable\n under any award or agreement or contract is more\n beneficial to employees than the one provided for\n payment of gratuity under the Act. This Court's order could\n not have conferred any such jurisdiction upon the\n Controlling Authority to decide any matter under sub-\n section (5) of \nSection 4\n, since Parliament in its wisdom had\n chosen to confer such jurisdiction only upon the\n appropriate Government and that too for the purposes of\n considering to grant exemption from the operation of the\n provisions of the Act.\n\n 45. Even on merits the conclusions drawn by the\n Controlling Authority that the Pension Scheme (Old)\n offered by the Bank is more beneficial since the amount of\n money the pensioners got under the pension scheme is\n more than the amount that could have been received in\n the form of gratuity under the provisions of the Act is\n unsustainable. The Controlling Authority failed to\n appreciate that sub-section (5) of \nSection 4\n of the Act\n protects the right of an employee to receive better terms\n of gratuity under any award or agreement or contract with\n the employer than the benefits conferred under the Act.\n The comparison, if any, could be only between the terms\n of gratuity under any award or agreement or contract and\n payment of gratuity payable to an employee under \nSection\n 4\n of the Act. There can be no comparison between a\n pension scheme which does not provide for payment of any\n gratuity and right of an employee to receive payment of\n gratuity under the provisions of the Act.”\n\n \n(ii) a decision of this Court in the case of \nVenugopal vs. The Joint\n\n Commissioner of Labour, Appellate Authority\n under the \nPayment of\n\n Gratuity Act\n, Madurai, (2012) (IV) LLJ 625\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.8 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n “10.\n \nHe further relied on the judgment of the\n Calcutta High Court reported in 1982 (\nII LLJ 324 [Eastern\n Coal Fields Ltd., v. Regional Labour Commissioner\n]. In\n paragraph 6, it was observed as follows:-\n\n \"6. ...It also appears to me the \nPayment\n of Gratuity Act\n in a beneficial legislation\n intended to give benefits to the employees and\n the provisions of the Act should be construed\n liberally in a way so that the beneficial intention\n is not frustrated by any strict and narrow\n interpretation but the benefit under the Act\n reaches the maximum possible employees. In my\n view, the provisions of \nSection 4(5)\n of the act has\n authorised the Controlling Authority to grant a\n higher quantum than quantum of gratuity under\n the Act in view of favourable conditions of\n service, although in the absence of such\n favourable conditions, such higher quantum could\n not have been decided by the Controlling\n Authority. In my view, it will not be proper\n construction in keeping with the beneficial\n purpose of the legislation, that although under\n \nSection 4(5)\n of the Act an employee may be\n entitled to a higher payment of gratuity but for\n enforcing such favourable terms of service for\n higher gratuity, he should move a different forum\n and the authority under the \nGratuity Act\n cannot\n entertain such claim of higher amount of\n gratuity. In the facts of the case, it does not\n appear that the Tribunals below have acted\n beyond the jurisdiction and/or have made\n adjudications not warranted in law. Hence no\n interference is called for in the constitutional\n writ jurisdiction and the writ petition is dismissed\n without any order as to costs.\"\n\n \n(iii) another decision of this Court in the case of the \nManagement,\n\n Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank vs. The Assistant\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.9 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n Commissioner of Labour, Virudhunagar, (2013 (1) LLJ 745)\n\n “11. According to the petitioner Bank, the first\n respondent, authority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n,\n has no jurisdiction to decide the disputes, on the\n interpretation of 12(3) settlement, in view of \nSection 36(A)\n\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, which contemplates that if\n any difficulty or doubt arises as to interpretation any\n provision or any award or settlement, the appropriate\n Government shall refer the question to such Labour Court,\n Tribunal or National Industrial Tribunal, as it may think fit.\n For the aforesaid reasons, the petitioner bank has sought\n for quashment of the common order, dated 22.04.2009.\n\n 16. Though several contentions have been raised on\n merits, for and against the impugned order, this Court\n deems it fit to address the preliminary issue, raised in this\n writ petition, as to whether the Assistant Commissioner of\n Labour, Madurai, has jurisdiction to entertain the dispute,\n under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n The factual dispute as\n could be deduced from the pleadings is whether the\n computation of the period for calculating gratuity should\n be on the basis of wages for 26 days in a month, though\n the number of days in a month is 30. Whether such\n dispute attracts the provision under \nSection 7 (4)\n of the\n Payment of Gratuity Act, empowering the controlling\n authority to adjudicate the dispute, and whether the\n terms of the settlement under \nSection 12(3)\n of the\n Industrial Disputes Act, can be subject matter of a\n dispute, falling under \nSection 7(4)\n of the Payment of\n Gratuity Act.”\n\n \n(iv) a Gujarat High Court decision in the case of \nGujarat State\n\n Road Transport Corporation vs. Chandrakant Tapubhai Vyas\n, 2004 (3) LLJ\n\n 86\n\n “9. However, the peculiar circumstance has arisen\n in the present group of cases inasmuch as it was required\n under the law pending the appeals, the amount as ordered\n by the Controlling Authority is already deposited by the\n petitioner-Corporation with the authority, and the said\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.10 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n amount is of course including the interest. Pending the\n petitions, the said amount has remained with the\n controlling authority, and pursuant to the interim order\n passed by this Court in the petition concerned, withdrawal\n was stayed. However, in view of the aforesaid statement\n made by Mr. Rawal during the course of the hearing, when\n the Corporation has also taken a decision for admissibility\n of the gratuity and its payment thereof by instalment, as\n on today, it cannot be said that the gratuity to the\n employees concerned would not be admissible. Since the\n matter is pertaining to payment of gratuity by way of\n retiral dues to the employees and when the payment has\n already been deposited with the controlling authority\n under the Act and in view of the declaration made by Mr.\n Prajapati for the employees concerned that they are not\n insisting for the interest if the principal amount deposited\n with the controlling authority is permitted to be\n withdrawn by the employees concerned, I find that no\n useful purpose would be served in remanding the matters\n to the appellate authority and/or controlling authority for\n the purpose of reconsidering the issue again. As such on\n account of the above referred subsequent change in the\n circumstances, the admissibility of gratuity amount is\n admitted on account of subsequent decision of the\n Corporation itself. Further, if the matters are remanded to\n the appellate authority for reconsideration of the issue\n and to render a decision afresh in view of the aforesaid\n change in the circumstances, the only consequence would\n be that the Corporation may get back the amount which\n thereafter will be required to be paid by installments as\n per its decision. Had it been a case where the liability to\n pay the gratuity were not in existence, the matter would\n have been viewed differently, but when the Corporation\n itself has taken a decision to pay gratuity but by\n installments, I find that considering the peculiar facts and\n circumstances, no serious prejudice will be caused to the\n Corporation if the employees concerned is allowed to\n withdraw the principle amount of gratuity lying with the\n controlling authority and the amount forming interest can\n be ordered to be refunded to the Corporation.\"\n\n \n(v) yet another Gujarat High Court decision in the case of \nGujarat\n\n State Export Corporation Ltd. vs. Madhusudan L.Khandwala\n, 2004 (II) LLJ\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.11 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n 389\n\n “13. In the present case the Controlling Authority\n could have directed the petitioner corporation to grant\n benefit to the extent the same was flowing from the\n provisions of the Act and should have restrained itself from\n ordering payment on the basis of private scheme. When\n the private scheme provides for payment of one month\n salary for each completed year of service it has reason to\n provide for maximum limit also. If the provisions of the\n private scheme are less beneficial, then under the\n provisions of the Act an employee can approach the\n Controlling Authority and the Controlling Authority can\n order enforcement of rights flowing from the Act. In the\n present case the respondent in Special Civil Application\n No.8285 of 2001 is concerned he has put in 32 years of\n service. Under the provisions of the Act he is entitled to\n get 16 months' salary. To that extent his claim for payment\n of 16 months' salary deserves to be allowed.\n\n 14. In the result, petitions succeed. The\n judgements and orders of the Controlling Authority as\n confirmed by the appellate authority in all these petitions\n are hereby quashed and set aside. However, the petitioner\n corporation is directed to pay the amount of gratuity to\n the respondents on the basis of private scheme as it stood\n on the day when the right accrued in favour of the\n employees or on the basis of \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n\n whichever is more beneficial to the employee. Rule is\n made absolute to the aforesaid extent only. No order as to\n costs.”\n\n \n(vi) a Kerala High Court decision in the case of \nAyyappan vs. Joint\n\n Labour Commissioner\n, 1999 (2) LLJ 1351\n\n “4. \nSection 7\n of the Act enables an employee to\n approach the controlling authority for determination of\n the amount towards gratuity. \nSection 7\n can be invoked\n only by \"a person who is eligible for payment of gratuity\n under this Act.\" The gratuity claimed by the petitioner is\n not under this Act but under Ext. P2. \nUnder the Act\n the\n petitioner is entitled only to the rate as mentioned in Sub-\n \nsection 2\n of \nSection 4\n The amount granted in Ext. P4 is\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.12 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n equal to that rate. Therefore, limiting of the gratuity\n payable to the petitioner under the Act to 15 days' wages\n for every completed year as contained in Ext. P4 is\n justified though on a different ground. On that basis, the\n petitioner cannot challenge the quantum of gratuity\n directed to be paid in Ext. P4. Therefore, Ext P4 to that\n extent alone is upheld. But the finding that Ext. P2 is not\n applicable to the petitioner is set aside and left open.”\n\n \n(vii) another Kerala High Court decision in the case of \nSivaraman\n\n Nair vs. The Plantation Corporation\n, 2005 (1) KLT 1\n\n “13. Therefore, the Controlling Authority could\n have determined a claim as exclusively coming under the\n Act alone. Of course, a claim for gratuity other than that\n coming within the purview of the Act could have been\n adjudicated under \nSection 33-C(2)\n of the Industrial\n Disputes Act, by a Labour Court. In such a case also,\n possibly the adjudication could have been only as\n prescribed by the settlement, and simultaneously taking\n notice of the ceiling as it always was to operate as a\n package deal. In short, the petitioners had to face\n restrictions at one point or another, viz., at the rate\n prescribed by the Government Orders, and with a ceiling\n prescribed by the order, or purely under the Act. The\n claims as presented therefore were ambitious, but without\n legal backing.”\n\n \n(viii) yet another Kerala High Court decision in the case of \nThomas\n\n Kurian vs. Idukki District Co-operative Bank Ltd.\n, (2003) III LLJ 1026\n\n “6. ... The petitioner filed objections contending\n that he was entitled to furthermore amount in view of the\n provisions in the revised service regulations. As the\n petitioner was not ready to repay the excess amount\n collected by him, the bank filed arbitration proceedings\n before the arbitrator and thereafter the petitioner filed\n exhibit P-12 application before the Controlling Authority\n constituted under \nSection 3\n of the Gratuity Act claiming\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.13 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n further amount. Learned counsel for the first respondent\n submitted that the maximum amount payable under Sub-\n section (3) of \nSection 4\n of the Gratuity Act is Rs. 3.5 lakhs\n and the bank is not disputing the petitioner's claim for Rs.\n 3.5 lakhs. The Controlling Authority constituted under the\n \nGratuity Act\n can consider the claim of an employee in\n accordance with the provisions of the \nGratuity Act\n and can\n sanction me maximum amount or Rs. 3.5 lakhs prescribed\n under Sub-section (3). In view of \nSection 5\n of the Act, the\n Controlling Authority can allow in excess of the maximum\n prescribed under Sub-section (3), if there, was any\n provision in the bye-law or any agreement with the\n employer entitling for higher amount. But in the present\n case, by exhibit P-1 circular, the gratuity payable to an\n employee was limited to the amount payable under the\n \nGratuity Act\n. The Controlling Authority constituted under\n the \nGratuity Act\n is incompetent to consider the legality or\n propriety of exhibit P-1 circular as he does not have any\n authority or jurisdiction to consider the same. When the\n right to get the maximum amount of gratuity under the\n \nGratuity Act\n is not disputed by the bank, the Controlling\n Authority has no jurisdiction in adjudicating the dispute\n regarding the excess amount paid to the employee. As the\n dispute is relating to the payment of an amount in excess\n of the amount prescribed under Sub-section (3) of \nSection\n 4\n of the Gratuity Act and that being a dispute between the\n employer and employee, it has to be adjudicated by the\n arbitrator under \nSection 69\n of the Co-operative Societies\n Act. \nThe Co-operative Societies Act\n envisages a dispute\n between the employer and the former employee also to be\n decided by arbitration. Hence, exhibit P-8 proceedings\n initiated by the bank before the arbitrator is in accordance\n with law and has to be proceeded with. In the present\n case, the Controlling Authority cannot have any\n jurisdiction in the matter, as the dispute relates to the\n claim regarding the excess amount paid which is beyond\n the purview of the \nGratuity Act\n. Hence, the reliefs prayed\n for in this original petition cannot be allowed.”\n\n \n(ix) another Apex Court decision in the case of \nShri Digvijay\n\n Woollen Mills Ltd. vs. Shri Mahendra Prataprai Buch\n, (1980 (4) SCC 106)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.14 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n “5. The view expressed in the extract quoted\n above appears to be legitimate and reasonable. Ordinarily\n of course a month is understood to mean 30 days, but the\n manner of calculating gratuity payable under the Act to\n the employees who work for 26 days a month followed by\n the Gujarat High Court cannot be called perverse. It is not\n necessary to consider whether another view is possible.\n The High Court summarily dismissed the petition of the\n appellant in both the appeals before us and upheld the\n decision of the authorities under the Act. We are not\n inclined to interfere with the decision of the High Court\n because it seems to us that the view taken by the\n authorities is not in any way unreasonable or perverse.\n\nIncidentally, to indicate that treating monthly wages as\n wages for 26 working days is not anything unique or\n unknown, we may refer to a passage from the judgment of\n this Court in \nDelhi Cloth and General Mills Company Ltd.\n v. Workmen\n [AIR 1970 SC 919 : (1969) 2 SCR 307 : (1969) 2\n LLJ 755 : 36 FJR 247] which disposed of several appeals\n arising out of an award made by the Industrial Tribunal,\n Delhi. In the award, schemes were framed relating to the\n payment of gratuity. The expression “average of the basic\n wage” occurring in the schemes was explained by this\n Court as follows:\n\n “It was also urged by Mr Ramamurthi\n that the expression ‘average of the basic\n wage’, in the definition of ‘wages’ in clause 4\n of the schemes is likely to create complications\n in the implementation of the schemes. He\n urged that if the wages earned by a workman\n during a month are divided by the total number\n of working days, the expression ‘wages’ will\n have an artificial meaning and especially where\n the workman is old or disabled or incapacitated\n from rendering service, gratuity payable to him\n will be substantially reduced. We do not think\n that there is any cause for such apprehension.\n The expression ‘average of the basic wages’\n can only mean the wage earned by a workman\n during a month divided by the number of days\n for which he has worked and multiplied by 26\n in order to arrive at the monthly wage for the\n computation of gratuity payable. Counsel for\n the employers agree to this interpretation.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.15 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n (x) yet another Apex Court decision in the case of Jeewanlal Ltd.\n\n \nvs. Appellate Authority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1984\n (4) SCC\n\n 356\n\n “11. In construing a social welfare legislation, the\n court should adopt a beneficent rule of construction; and\n if a section is capable of two constructions, that\n construction should be preferred which fulfils the policy of\n the Act, and is more beneficial to the persons in whose\n interest the Act has been passed. When, however, the\n language is plain and unambiguous, the Court must give\n effect to it whatever may be the consequence, for\n, \nin that\n case\n, the words of the statute speak the intention of the\n Legislature. When the language is explicit, its\n consequences are for the Legislature and not for the\n courts to consider. The argument of inconvenience and\n hardship is a dangerous one and is only admissible in\n construction where the meaning of the statute is obscure\n and there are two methods of construction. In their\n anxiety to advance beneficent purpose of legislation, the\n courts must not yield to the temptation of seeking\n ambiguity when there is none.\n\n \n13. ...The quantum of gratuity payable under\n sub-section (2) of \nSection 4\n of the Act has to be fifteen\n days' wages based on the rate of wages last drawn by the\n employee concerned for every completed year of service\n or more in excess of six months' subject to the maximum\n of 20 months' wages as provided by sub-section (3)\n thereof. The whole object is to ensure that the employee\n concerned must be paid gratuity at the rate of fifteen\n days' wages for 365 days in a year of service. The total\n amount of gratuity payable to such employee at that rate\n has to be multiplied by the number of years of his service\n subject to the ceiling imposed by sub-section (3) of\n \nSection 4\n of the Act viz. that such amount shall not exceed\n 20 months' wages. The construction of sub-section (2) of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.16 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n \nSection 4\n of the Act adopted by the learned Single Judge\n of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in \nAssociated Cement\n Company\n case [(1976) 1 LLJ 222 (AP)] and later approved\n by a Division Bench of that Court in Swamy case [(1978) 52\n FJR 138 (AP)] would make it utterly unworkable. If the\n determination of the amount of gratuity payable under\n sub-section (2) of \nSection 4\n depends on the number of\n calendar days in a month in which the services of the\n employee concerned terminates, the quantum of gratuity\n payable would necessarily vary between an employee and\n an employee, belonging to the same class, drawing the\n same scale of wages, with like service for the same\n number of years. Obviously, this could not have been the\n legislative intention.\n\n 14. The next question is: whether a month cannot\n mean 26 working days for purposes of sub-section (2) of\n \nSection 4\n of the Act and 30 days for purposes of sub-\n section (3) thereof. It is said that if a month under sub-\n section (2) connotes 26 working days in a month for\n purposes of calculating the amount of gratuity, then the\n rule of harmonious construction requires that the words\n “20 months' wages” in sub-section (3) thereof must mean\n wages for 520 working days taking the actual working days\n in 20 months and not 600 days taking that a month consists\n of 30 days. The contention is wholly misconceived. Sub-\n sections (2) and (3) of \nSection 4\n of the Act are designed to\n achieve two separate and distinct objects and they\n operate at two different stages. While sub-section (2)\n provides for the mode of calculation of the amount of\n gratuity, sub-section (3) seeks to impose a ceiling on the\n amount of gratuity payable at 20 months' wages. It is\n meant to provide an incentive to employees to serve for\n the period of 30 years or more. By no rule of construction,\n sub-section (2) of \nSection 4\n of the Act which uses the\n words “fifteen days' wages” and not half a months wages,\n be called in aid for construction of the words “20 months'\n wages” appearing in sub-section (3) of \nSection 4\n of the\n Act.” ”\n\n \n(xi) yet another Apex Court decision in the case of \nBeed District\n\n Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra\n, (2006 (8) SCC\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.17 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n 514\n\n “13. We, however, are of the opinion that the said\n doctrine cannot be said to have any application\n whatsoever in the instant case. Undoubtedly, the Payment\n of Gratuity Act is a beneficial statute. When two views are\n possible, having regard to the purpose the Act seeks to\n achieve being a social welfare legislation, it may be\n construed in favour of the workman. However, it is also\n trite that only because a statute is beneficent in nature,\n the same would not mean that it should be construed in\n favour of the workmen only although they are not entitled\n to benefits thereof.\n \n(See \nRegional Director, ESI Corpn. v.\n Ramanuja Match Industries\n [(1985) 1 SCC 218 : 1985 SCC\n (L&S) 213 : AIR 1985 SC 278] .)\n\n 14. Applying the “golden rule of interpretation\n of statute”, to us it appears that the question should be\n considered from the point of view of the nature of the\n scheme as also the fact that the parties agreed to the\n terms thereof. When better terms are offered, a workman\n takes it as a part of the package. He may volunteer\n therefor, he may not. Sub-section (5) of \nSection 4\n of the\n 1972 Act provides for a right in favour of the workman.\n Such a right may be exercised by the workman concerned.\n He need not necessarily do it. It is the right of individual\n workman and not all the workmen. When the expression\n “terms” has been used, ordinarily it must mean “all the\n terms of the contract”. While interpreting even a\n beneficent statute, like, the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, we\n are of the opinion that either contract has to be given\n effect to or the statute. The provisions of the Act envisage\n for one scheme. It could not be segregated. Sub-section\n (5) of \nSection 4\n of the 1972 Act does not contemplate that\n the workman would be at liberty to opt for better terms of\n the contract, while keeping the option open in respect of a\n part of the statute. While reserving his right to opt for the\n beneficent provisions of the statute or the agreement, he\n has to opt for either of them and not the best of the terms\n of the statute as well as those of the contract. He cannot\n have both. If such an interpretation is given, the spirit of\n the Act shall be lost. ...”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.18 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n 12.

As per the\n Scheme, an employee is entitled to get 15 days wages as\n gratuity for every year of service, subject to a maximum\n of the amount equivalent to 20 months salary. According\n to Appellant Bank, since the gratuity amount was more\n beneficial to the employees than the Act, in the\n Settlement dated 17.02.1997 under \nSection 12(3)\n of\n Industrial Disputes Act, in the Settlement dated\n 17.02.1997 under \nSection 12(3)\n of Industrial Disputes\n Act, it was agreed to continue the Group Gratuity\n Scheme.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank, drawing reference to\n\n the Apex Court decision in Jeewanlal's case (cited supra), submitted that the\n\n Apex Court has considered as to how gratuity has to be payable to an\n\n employee, based on the number of working days in a month. According to\n\n him, even assuming for the sake of argument that the calculation arrived at\n\n by the employees in the case on hand, is 14 months' a year, and that, the\n\n number of years is more than what the employee had actually served, it\n\n cannot be beyond 20 months, in terms of the linked Insurance Scheme.\n\n 16.

Learned counsel for the Respondents/employees drew the\n\n attention of this Court to clause 30 of the Settlement dated 26.02.1997,\n\n which reads as under:\n\n “The present system of linked Insurance\n Scheme in collaboration with the Life Insurance\n Corporation of India, will continue. Arrears of\n Gratuity, if any, payable to the employees arising\n out of this Settlement, shall be paid by the Bank.\n\n It is mutually agreed that for the purpose\n of calculation of gratuity, 26 days will be\n reckoned as a month not only for arriving at pay,\n but also for calculation of length of service. The\n existing benefit of gratuity without any limitation\n will be continued.”\n\n 18. In view of clause 30 of the Settlement, learned counsel\n\n appearing for the Respondents/employees submitted that, for the purpose of\n\n calculation of gratuity, 26 days will be reckoned as a month, not only for\n\n arriving at pay, but also for calculation of length of service, and that the\n\n existing benefit of gratuity without any limitation has to be continued.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.23 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n 19. It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the\n\n Respondents/employees that the Controlling Authority was perfectly justified\n\n in arriving at a different length of service, based on the Settlement and that,\n\n the \nGratuity Act\n has to be read in toto, without excluding \nSection 4(5)\n of the\n\n Act, as the said provision deprives the authorities concerned, from trying the\n\n issue with regard to better benefits to the employees.\n\n 20. According to the learned counsel for the\n\n Respondents/employees, it is admitted by the Petitioner-Bank that there is a\n\n linked Insurance Scheme in collaboration with LIC based on which, gratuity is\n\n payable for a period of 20 months, and it is mandatory on the part of the\n\n Petitioner-Bank to pay premium to the Scheme, and pay the gratuity amount\n\n as claimed by the employees.\n\n 21.

Sub-Section (5) of \nsection 4\n of the Gratuity\n Act permits an employee to be regulated for purpose of\n gratuity, under an alternative provision/arrangement\n (award or agreement or contract), other than\n the \nGratuity Act\n. In such an eventuality, sub-section (5)\n aforesaid, assures the concerned employee, “…to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.25 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n receive better terms of gratuity under any award or\n agreement or contract with the employer…” Since the\n appellant’s claim for gratuity is regulated, under the\n 1995, Regulations, it is evident, that his claim for\n gratuity is liable to be determined by ensuring his right\n to better terms than those contemplated under\n the \nGratuity Act\n. In the instant process of\n consideration, the aforesaid conclusion, namely, that\n an employee who receives gratuity under a provision,\n other than the \nGratuity Act\n, would be entitled to better\n terms of gratuity, will constitute one of the\n foundational basis, of determination.

The third contention raised by the appellant\n is that the employee-respondents were not entitled to\n apply under \nSection 33-C(2)\n of the Industrial Disputes\n Act, 1947 for payment of the gratuity, and should have,\n if at all, applied under the provisions of the \nPayment of\n Gratuity Act\n. It is urged that the \nPayment of Gratuity\n Act\n is a self-contained code incorporating all the\n essential provisions relating to payment of gratuity\n which can be claimed under that Act, and its provisions\n impliedly exclude recourse to any other statute for that\n purpose. The contention has force and must be\n accepted. A careful perusal of the relevant provisions\n of the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n shows that Parliament\n has enacted a closely knit scheme providing for\n payment of gratuity. A controlling authority is\n appointed by the appropriate Government under\n \nSection 3\n, and Parliament has made him responsible for\n the administration of the entire Act. In what event\n gratuity will become payable and how it will be\n quantified are detailed in \nSection 4\n. \nSection 7(1)\n\n entitles a person eligible for payment of gratuity to\n apply in that behalf to the employer.

Determination of gratuity is not based on\n any definite rules. In each case it must depend upon the\n prosperity of the concern, needs of the workmen and the\n prevailing economic conditions, examined in the light of\n the auxiliary benefits which the workmen may get on\n determination of employment. If all over the country in\n the textile centres payment of gratuity is related to the\n basic wages and not on consolidated wages, any\n innovation in the Delhi region is likely to give rise to\n serious industrial disputes in other centres all over the\n country. The award if confirmed would not ensure\n industrial peace: it is likely to foment serious unrest in\n other centres. If maintenance of industrial peace is a\n governing principle of industrial adjudication, it would be\n wise to maintain a reasonable degree of uniformity in the\n diverse units all over the country and not to make a\n fundamental departure from the prevailing pattern. We\n are, therefore, of the view that the Tribunal's award\n granting gratuity on the basis of consolidated wage cannot\n be upheld. This modification will not, however, affect the\n existing benefits which are available under the schemes\n framed by the D.C.M. and S.B.M. insofar as those two\n units are concerned.\n\n 36. Mr Ramamurthi for the workmen also\n contended that in the matter of relating gratuity to\n wages--consolidated or basic the principle of region-cum-\n industry should be applied and an “overall view of similar\n and uniform conditions in the industry in different\n centres” should not be adopted. It was also urged that the\n basic wage is very low and the class of wage to which\n gratuity was related played a very important part in the\n determination of gratuity. The basic wage is however low\n in all the centres and if it does not play an important part\n in other centres, we see no reason why it should play only\n in the Delhi region a decisive part so as to make vital\n departure from the scheme in operation in the other\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.28 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n centres in the country. We are strongly impressed by the\n circumstance that acceptance of the award of the\n Tribunal in the present case is likely to create conditions\n of great instability all over the country in the textile\n industry. In that view, we decline to uphold the order of\n the Tribunal fixing gratuity on the basis of consolidated\n wages inclusive of dearness allowance.\n\n \n38. A similar view was expressed in \nRemington\n Rand of India Ltd.\n case [(1968) 1 LLJ 542] .\n \nIn \nCalcutta\n Insurance Company Ltd.\n case [(1967) 11 LLJ 1] however\n protest was raised against acceptance of this rule without\n qualification.\n Mitter, J., observed at p. 9 that it was\n difficult to concur in principle with the opinion expressed\n in the Garment Cleaning Works case [(1961) 1 LLJ 513] .\n Mitter, J., observed:\n\n “We are inclined to think that it\n (gratuity) is paid to a workman to ensure good\n conduct throughout the period he serves the\n employer. Long and meritorious service, must\n mean long and unbroken period of service\n meritorious to the end. As the period of\n service must be unbroken, so must the\n continuity of meritorious service be a\n condition for entitling the workman to\n gratuity. If a workman commits such\n misconduct as causes financial loss to his\n employer, the employer would, under the\n general law, have a right of action against the\n employee for the loss caused, and making a\n provision for withholding payment of gratuity\n where such loss was caused to the employer\n does not seem to aid to the harmonious\n employment of labourers or workmen. Further,\n the misconduct may be such as to undermine\n the discipline in the workers — a case in which\n it would be extremely difficult to assess the\n financial loss to the employer.”\n\n 22. Learned counsel for the Respondents/employees has further\n\n relied on the following unreported judgments of this Court:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.29 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n (i) The Management of the Coimbatore District Central Co-\n\n \noperative \nDistrict Central Co-operative Bank Limited vs. Joint\n\n Commissioner of Labour (W.P.Nos.38830\n of 2003, dated 30.03.2010)\n\n “12. ... The fact remains that no mutual\n settlement was arrived at between the Management and\n the workmen under \nSection 12(3)\n of the Industrial\n Disputes Act, varying or modifying clause 30 of the\n erstwhile Settlement arrived at between the parties.\n\n 13. \nIn this context, it is relevant to refer to\n the decision of the Supreme Court in the \nLife Insurance\n Corporation of India vs. D.J.Bahadur and others\n, AIR\n 1980 SC 2181, wherein, it has been held that even\n after notice under \nSection 9A\n of the Industrial Disputes\n Act, 1947, was issued putting the employees on notice,\n the intention of the Management to terminate a\n particular clause found in the erstwhile Settlement, the\n Settlement remains operative till the same is replaced\n by a fresh Settlement.”\n\n (ii) a Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of the\n\n Management of Coimbatore District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs. The\n\n Joint Commissioner of Labour, Coimbatore (W.A.Nos.1200 to 1202 of 2010,\n\n dated 29.07.2011)\n\n “7. Admittedly, there was a Settlement under\n \nSection 12(3)\n on 26 February, 1997, giving certain\n benefits to the employees. Though the appellant has\n issued a notice under Section 9-A proposing variation of\n the said Settlement, the fact remains that there was no\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.30 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n such variation and as such, the 12(3) Settlement still\n holds good. Unless and until the said Settlement is\n modified by another Settlement, the Appellant cannot\n deny the benefits to the employees. This issue was\n considered by the original authority as well as the\n appellate authority, being the fact finding authorities\n and ultimately by the writ Court and answered the issue\n against the appellant. Therefore, it is not open to the\n appellant to maintain these appeals on a totally new\n ground. We do not find any merit in the contention\n raised by the appellant.”\n\n (iii) The Management, Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative\n\n Bank Ltd. vs. The Joint Commissioner of Labour, (W.P.(MD) No.14097 of\n\n 2014, dated 06.02.2018)\n\n \"4. In the present case, the third respondent\n claimed gratuity on the basis of settlement under \nSection\n 12(3)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This Court is of\n the view that the orders impugned in the writ petition\n deserves to be sustained. The learned counsel appearing\n for the third respondent drew the attention of this Court\n to the order dated 25.11.2009 passed by this Court in\n WP.Nos.2069 of 2005 and 2364 of 2009. In the said case\n also, the Court was concerned with the expression ?for\n purposes of calculation of gratuity, 26 days will be\n reckoned as a month not only for arriving at pay, but also\n for calculation for length of service. It is similar to the\n case on hand. This Court allowed the writ petition filed by\n the workman and dismissed the writ petition filed by the\n management. The Management namely, Erode District\n Central Co-operative Bank filed WA.Nos.1200 & 1221 of\n 2010. But, the Hon'ble Division Bench by order dated\n 29.10.2013 dismissed the appeals. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court also dismissed the SLPs filed by the Erode District\n Central Cooperative Bank by order dated 05.05.2014.\n\n 5. \nSection 4(5)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act,\n 1972 states that nothing in \nSection 4\n shall affect the right\n of an employee to receive better terms of gratuity under\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.31 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n any award or agreement or contract with the employer. In\n this case, the settlement entered into between the\n management and the workman provides for better terms.\n This Court can only observe that the object in\n incorporating such a clause is intended to reward a long\n length of service. It is clear and categorical that the\n settlement states that 26 days will be reckoned as a month\n not only for arriving at pay, but also for calculation for\n length of service.\n\n 6. This expression will have to be understood in its\n plain meaning. By applying the said clause, even though\n the third respondent has put in only 36 years of service, his\n total length of service will be reckoned for the purpose of\n computing gratuity as 42 years. It may sound illogical. But,\n then when such a beneficial consequence flows out of the\n plain meaning of the terms of the Group Gratuity Scheme,\n it is not for this Court to hold otherwise.\"\n\n \n23. According to the learned counsel appearing for the\n\n Respondents/employees, though the Madurai Bench of this Court in the case\n\n of T.Rajarajan vs. The Appellate Authority, Joint Commissioner of Labour,\n\n Trichy, in W.P.(MD) Nos.5794 of 2018, batch of cases, by an order dated\n\n 12.12.2018, has held that the Controlling Authority has no jurisdiction to\n\n adjudicate the issue, if the relief is sought under \nSection 4(5)\n of the Gratuity\n\n Act, the very same Court, in a decision rendered in the case of the\n\n \nManagement, Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs.\n\n The Joint Commissioner of Labour, Madurai\n, vide order dated 06.02.2018\n\n made in W.P.(MD) No.14097 of 2014, has categorically held that, as per the\n\n 12(3) Settlement, 26 days will be reckoned as a month not only for arriving at\n\n pay, but also for calculation of length of service.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.32 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n 24. In Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd (cited\n\n supra), it was observed that, when such a beneficial consequence flows out\n\n of the plain meaning of the terms of the Group Gratuity Scheme, it is not for\n\n this Court to hold otherwise. In the said case, though the employee had put\n\n in 36 years of service, his total length of service will be reckoned, for the\n\n purpose of computing gratuity as 42 years.\n\n 25. In view of the same, learned counsel for the\n\n Respondents/employees submitted that the Controlling Authority has got\n\n jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue on hand, and it is open to the Petitioner-\n\n Bank to deposit the gratuity amount before the Controlling Authority, in\n\n cases, where no appeal has been filed, provided, it is within 120 days, and\n\n the employee can canvass the issue before the authority concerned on\n\n merits, but, not on jurisdiction. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the\n\n Writ Petitions are liable to be dismissed.\n\n 26. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the\n\n material documents available on record.\n\n 27. Two issues arise for consideration in the case on hand. The\n\n first issue is, whether the Controlling Authority has jurisdiction to entertain\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.33 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n a dispute falling under \nSection 4(5)\n of the Gratuity Act and the second issue\n\n is, whether the interpretation given by the Controlling Authority with\n\n regard to the length of service of an employee, for the purpose of\n\n computation of gratuity, based on Clause 30 of the Settlement entered into\n\n between the parties, is correct.\n\n \n28. Even though this Court has dictated the order in the open\n\n Court, dismissing the above Writ Petitions as regards the first issue, and\n\n referring the matter to the Division Bench with regard to the second issue,\n\n this Court recalls the same, as this Court has taken a different view on both\n\n the issues. Any order passed in the open Court is not final before signing, in\n\n the light of the Apex Court decision rendered in \nKushalbhai Ratanbhai Rohit\n\n and others vs. State of Gujarat\n reported in (2014) 9 SCC 124. Relevant\n\n portion of \nthe said decision\n, as regards recalling a judgment before\n\n signature, is extracted below:\n\n 10. \nIn \nSangam Lal v. Rent Control and Eviction\n Officer\n [AIR 1966 All 221] , while dealing with the rent\n control matter, the Court came to the conclusion that until\n a judgment is signed and sealed after delivering in court, it\n is not a judgment and it can be changed or altered at any\n time before it is signed and sealed.\n\n \n11. This Court has also dealt with the issue\n in \nSurendra Singh v. State of U.P.[Surendra Singh\n v. State\n of U.P., AIR 1954 SC 194 : 1954 Cri LJ 475], observing as\n under: (AIR pp. 196-97, para 12)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.34 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n “12. Now up to the moment the judgment\n is delivered Judges have the right to change\n their mind. There is a sort of ‘locus\n paenitentiae’ and indeed last minute alterations\n often do occur. Therefore, however much a\n draft judgment may have been signed\n beforehand, it is nothing but a draft till formally\n delivered as the judgment of the Court. Only\n then does it crystallise into a full-fledged\n judgment and become operative. It follows that\n the Judge who ‘delivers’ the judgment, or\n causes it to be delivered by a Brother Judge,\n must be in existence as a member of the Court\n at the moment of delivery so that he can, if\n necessary, stop delivery and say that he has\n changed his mind. There is no need for him to\n be physically present in court but he must be in\n existence as a member of the Court and be in a\n position to stop delivery and effect an alteration\n should there be any last minute change of mind\n on his part. If he hands in a draft and signs it\n and indicates that he intends that to be the\n final expository of his views it can be assumed\n that those are still his views at the moment of\n delivery if he is alive and in a position to change\n his mind but takes no steps to arrest delivery.\n\n But one cannot assume that he would not\n have changed his mind if he is no longer in a\n position to do so. A Judge's responsibility is\n heavy and when a man's life and liberty hang\n upon his decision nothing can be left to chance\n or doubt or conjecture; also, a question of\n public policy is involved. As we have indicated,\n it is frequently the practice to send a draft,\n sometimes a signed draft, to a Brother Judge\n who also heard the case. This may be merely for\n his information, or for consideration and\n criticism. The mere signing of the draft does not\n necessarily indicate a closed mind. We feel it\n would be against public policy to leave the door\n open for an investigation whether a draft sent\n by a Judge was intended to embody his final and\n unalterable opinion or was only intended to be a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.35 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n tentative draft sent with an unwritten\n understanding that he is free to change his mind\n should fresh light dawn upon him before the\n delivery of judgment.”\n\n 29. Admittedly, the private Respondents in the above Writ\n\n Petitions, were employees of the Petitioner-Bank and they received gratuity\n\n at the time of their retirement. It is not in dispute that the private\n\n Respondents herein are employees, as defined under \nSection 2(e)\n of the\n\n Gratuity Act.\n\n \n30. As regards the first issue, it is seen that the purpose of the\n\n enactment of \nGratuity Act, 1972\n, more particularly, in the light of \nSection\n\n 4(5)\n, is to ensure that the employees are entitled to better benefits. The\n\n Apex Court in \nAllahabad Bank\n's case (cited supra), has held that the\n\n Controlling Authority cannot deal with any issue under sub-section (5) of\n\n \nSection 4\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act.\n\n \n31. This Court has no other option except to follow the dictum \nlaid\n\n down by\n the Supreme Court in \nAllahabad Bank\n's case (cited supra), and it is\n\n for the employees to agitate before the Apex Court, in view of the ratio \nlaid\n\n down by\n the Apex Court in the case of \nGeneral Manager, Telecom vs.\n\n A.Srinivasa Rao\n, reported in (1997) 8 SCC 767, that, judicial discipline\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.36 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n requires a Bench of lesser strength to follow the judgment of the Larger\n\n Bench, unless the same is distinguishable on facts. This Court is bound by the\n\n said dictum.\n\n 32. In Padma Sundara Rao Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, reported in\n\n 2002 (3) SCC 533, the Apex Court has held that 'Courts should not place\n\n reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation\n\n fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed'.\n\n \nBut, in the case on hand, the legal issue with regard to \nSection 4(5)\n of the\n\n Gratuity Act, has been considered and decided, and this Court cannot give a\n\n helping hand to the employees herein, unless a Larger Bench of the Apex\n\n Court takes a different view than the one rendered in \nAllahabad Bank\n's case.\n\n \n33. Thus, in view of the decision rendered by the Apex Court in\n\n \nAllahabad Bank\n's case (cited supra), this Court has no other option except\n\n to allow the Writ Petitions as regards the first issue, on the principle that\n\n the remedy lies elsewhere and not before the authority under the \nGratuity\n\n Act\n.\n\n 33a. This Court is not inclined to render any finding on the\n\n contention that this Court can direct the Management to pay its employees\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.37 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n the gratuity amount, as Co-operative Society is amenable to the Writ\n\n jurisdiction of this Court, in view of the 97th amendment to the Constitution\n\n of India. The maintainability of the Writ Petitions by an employee against a\n\n Co-operative Society is left open, as no Writ Petition has been filed by the\n\n employees before this Court, seeking gratuity.\n\n 34. Insofar as the second issue is concerned, the interpretation\n\n given by the Madurai Bench of this Court in Virudhunagar District Central\n\n Co-operative Bank Limited (cited supra), as regards the length of service, is\n\n correct. It has been categorically held therein that, the total length of\n\n service will have to be reckoned for the purpose of computing gratuity as 42\n\n years, for those employees who have completed 36 years of service. But, the\n\n employee will have to claim the amount before the appropriate forum and\n\n not before the Controlling Authority, unless the Larger Bench of the Apex\n\n Court takes a different view to that of the view taken in Allahabad Bank's\n\n case (cited supra).\n\n 35. Normally, no Writ Petition would lie against the order passed by\n\n the Controlling Authority, as the workman has got an appellate remedy. It is\n\n the duty cast upon the employer to deposit the amount before the\n\n Controlling Authority and file an Appeal, in the light of the decision of this\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.38 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n Court rendered in the case of Onward Trading Company vs. Deputy\n\n Commissioner of Labour, Madras, reported in (1989) II LLN 672, which has\n\n been confirmed by the Division Bench of this Court, reported in (1989) II LLN\n\n 673 (DB), failing which, Appeal will not be entertained. But, in this case, as\n\n the Controlling Authority and Appellate Authority have no jurisdiction, this\n\n Court has to entertain the Writ Petitions against the order of the Controlling\n\n Authority, with regard to the length of service of the employees. The second\n\n issue is answered accordingly.\n\n \n36. Thus, in the light of the decision rendered by the Madurai\n\n Bench of this Court in Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank\n\n Limited (cited supra), as regards calculation of length of service and also\n\n taking into account that the 12(3) Settlement, dated 26.02.1997 has not been\n\n superseded, it is open to the employees herein to file a complaint under\n\n \nSection 29\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, for prosecuting the Officials falling\n\n under \nSection 32\n of the Act, for violation of Settlement. The authorities shall\n\n also take into account, the decision rendered by the Apex Court in the case\n\n of \nRaj Kumar Gupta vs. Lieutenant Governor, Delhi\n reported in 1997 (1)\n\n LLJ 994, for sanctioning prosecution, so that the issue is brought to a logical\n\n end. Once this case lands up in the jurisdictional Court, the Court shall\n\n proceed with the matter without adjourning the same beyond 15 working\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n Page No.39 / 42\n\n\f W.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n days at any point of time, so as to bring the issue to a logical end, on merits,\n\n as the total length of service have to be reckoned as 42 years, for the\n\n purpose of determination of gratuity, and that, there is violation of 12(3)\n\n Settlement, as mentioned supra.\n\n In view of the foregoing, both Writ Petitions are allowed. No costs.\n\n Consequently, connected M.P.Nos.1 and 1 of 2013 in both Writ Petitions are\n\n closed.\n\n 25.07.2019\n Index : Yes\n Speaking Order : Yes\n (aeb)\n\n Note to Registry: Issue copy of this order on or before 25.10.2019.\n\n To:\n\n 1.

In my view, it will not be proper\n construction in keeping with the beneficial\n purpose of the legislation, that although under\n \nSection 4(5)\n of the Act an employee may be\n entitled to a higher payment of gratuity but for\n enforcing such favourable terms of service for\n higher gratuity, he should move a different forum\n and the authority under the \nGratuity Act\n cannot\n entertain such claim of higher amount of\n gratuity.

Only\n then does it crystallise into a full-fledged\n judgment and become operative. It follows that\n the Judge who ‘delivers’ the judgment, or\n causes it to be delivered by a Brother Judge,\n must be in existence as a member of the Court\n at the moment of delivery so that he can, if\n necessary, stop delivery and say that he has\n changed his mind. There is no need for him to\n be physically present in court but he must be in\n existence as a member of the Court and be in a\n position to stop delivery and effect an alteration\n should there be any last minute change of mind\n on his part. If he hands in a draft and signs it\n and indicates that he intends that to be the\n final expository of his views it can be assumed\n that those are still his views at the moment of\n delivery if he is alive and in a position to change\n his mind but takes no steps to arrest delivery."

A Judge's responsibility is\n heavy and when a man's life and liberty hang\n upon his decision nothing can be left to chance\n or doubt or conjecture; also, a question of\n public policy is involved. As we have indicated,\n it is frequently the practice to send a draft,\n sometimes a signed draft, to a Brother Judge\n who also heard the case. This may be merely for\n his information, or for consideration and\n criticism. The mere signing of the draft does not\n necessarily indicate a closed mind. We feel it\n would be against public policy to leave the door\n open for an investigation whether a draft sent\n by a Judge was intended to embody his final and\n unalterable opinion or was only intended to be a"
