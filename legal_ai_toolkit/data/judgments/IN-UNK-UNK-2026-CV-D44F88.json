JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD\n and\n HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JITENDRA KUMAR\n ORAL ORDER\n\n (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD)\n\n4 26-11-2024\n Heard learned senior counsel for the appellant, learned\n\n counsel for the informant and learned Additional Public Prosecutor\n\n for the State.\n\n 2. The informant is herself present in the Court and on the\n\n request of learned counsel for the informant, she has also been\n\n allowed to make her submissions.\n\n 3. Records have been placed before this Court to consider\n\n the prayer of the appellant for suspension of his sentence and release\n\n on bail during pendency of the appeal.\n\n 4. The appellant has been convicted vide judgment dated\n\n 27.04.2024 and sentenced vide order dated 01.05.2024 by learned\n\n District and Sessions Judge, Sheikhpura for the offence under\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n 2/7\n\nSections 376(D)\n/\n34\n, \n387\n/\n34\n, \n341\n/\n34\n, \n323\n/\n34\n, \n504\n/\n34\n and \n506\n/\n34\n of\n\n the Indian Penal Code (in short '\nIPC\n') in Sessions Trial No. 19 of\n\n 2023 arising out of Sheikhpura Mahila P.S. Case No. 16 of 2022. He\n\n has been ordered to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 20 years with\n\n a fine of Rs.15,000/- for the offence under \nSection 376(D)\n IPC and in\n\n default of payment of fine, he shall further undergo three months\n\n rigorous imprisonment. For brevity sake, sentences under other\n\n sections are not being mentioned.\n\n 5. As per the prosecution case, the appellant and co-\n\n accused persons, who are also appellants in the connected appeal\n\n being Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 663 of 2024 and Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 679\n\n of 2024 have committed rape upon the informant/victim.\n\n 6. Learned senior counsel for the appellant submits that\n\n earlier this Court had occasion to hear the identical prayer of the\n\n appellants, namely, Chandan Kumar and Laxman Yadav in the\n\n above-mentioned two appeals and after hearing learned counsel for\n\n the parties and learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State,\n\n this Court has been pleased to grant them privilege of suspension of\n\n sentence and release on bail during pendency of the appeal. A copy of\n\n the order dated 04.10.2024 passed in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 663 of\n\n 2024 has been placed before this Court.\n\n 7. Learned senior counsel submits that the victim in this\n\n case has stated that she happened to be a student of B.A.-1st Part in\n\n Mahila College, Sheikhpura and on the date of occurrence i.e.\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n 3/7\n\n 13.12.2021, she was going to collect her admit card of Alim Part-I\n\n from Biharisharif college. She had left her house at 6:00 AM in the\n\n morning. It was winter season. In course of investigation, however,\n\n no material could be collected that the victim girl was a student of\n\n Alim Part-I. The victim has herself deposed in course of trial in the\n\n year 2023 that she had done her graduation from Sanjay Gandhi\n\n Mahila College, Sheikhpura but on the date of occurrence, she had\n\n also registered herself in the graduation course of Urdu from Urdu\n\n Board. Though she claimed that she can produce the paper but no\n\n such paper could be produced. The submission is that the fact that the\n\n prosecutrix had left her house at 6:00 AM for collecting her admit\n\n card has not been proved by any cogent evidence and in the same\n\n year, she could not have been a student of two graduation courses\n\n from two different Boards.\n\n 8. Learned senior counsel further submits that it is very\n\n surprising that the victim alleged that she was raped by five named\n\n accused persons on 13.12.2021 near the Government School,\n\n Bangalipar. The said occurrence was never disclosed to anyone and\n\n no FIR was lodged in that connection.\n\n 9. Learned senior counsel further submits that according\n\n to the victim, while committing rape, the accused persons had made\n\n her video and that her physical as well as mental condition had gone\n\n weak, for this reason she was not going to her college being afraid\n\n that she may be murdered but the falsity of her statement may be\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n 4/7\n\n found from the fact that after the occurrence, she continued with her\n\n college for next two years and passed her graduation examination\n\n from Sheikhpura college itself. The so-called video which was\n\n allegedly made by the accused persons has never been found in the\n\n mobile phone of the accused and there is no evidence to this effect.\n\n 10. Learned senior counsel has shown from paragraph '8'\n\n of the deposition of the victim that the victim had lodged another\n\n case being Sheikhpura Mahila P.S. Case No. 31 of 2022. Initially,\n\n when she was asked that she had lodged two other cases, she denied\n\n the same but then she was shown the FIR of Mahila P.S. Case No.31\n\n of 2022 in which she and her mami had lodged the case, then the\n\n informant has stated that she and her mami had lodged the said case\n\n because they were finding a lot of misgivings and rumours in the\n\n media that she and her mami were indulging in wrong act.\n\n 11. It has further been submitted that the falsity of the\n\n statement of the victim may be found from the fact that even as she\n\n alleges rape had been committed by five named accused persons,\n\n she did not go to any doctor and there is no evidence that she was\n\n ever treated for that so-called rape. In her 164 \nCr.P.C\n. statement\n\n which was recorded on the very next day of the lodging of the FIR,\n\n she did not mention the name of any of the accused persons. She\n\n claimed that 20 days ago, one boy had called her over telephone by\n\n threatening her to make her video viral and when she went there,\n\n she was raped. Again about this occurrence, she had not reported to\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n 5/7\n\n police and she had not named the said boy and it is apparent that in\n\n order to save her from the media reports about her wrong acts, she\n\n had come out with these allegations. In her statement before the\n\n learned Magistrate, she claimed that she identified two boys and she\n\n further claimed that she can identify the others but in her deposition,\n\n she has stated that prior to the occurrence, she did not know Chandan\n\n and other accused persons and after lodging of the FIR, she was\n\n seeing the accused persons only in the court. During the period of\n\n investigation, no TIP was conducted to ensure the identification of\n\n the accused persons.\n\n 12. It has further been pointed out to this Court that the\n\n victim was subjected to the medical examination on 26.04.2022 in\n\n which the doctor had not found any injury on her private parts but\n\n from the overall findings, it would only appear that sexual\n\n intercourse had been done. She being an adult, the finding of the\n\n doctor that sexual intercourse has been done with her would not be a\n\n proof that these accused persons had committed rape on her on\n\n 13.12.2021, particularly, when she herself admits that there were\n\n media reports about her wrong acts.\n\n 13. In course of submissions, learned Additional Public\n\n Prosecutor for the State as well as learned counsel for the informant\n\n do not controvert the submission of learned senior counsel for the\n\n appellant that his case would be standing on identical footing with\n\n the appellants, namely, Chandan Kumar and Laxman Yadav in Cr.\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n 6/7\n\n Appeal (DB) No. 663 of 2024 and Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 679 of 2024\n\n respectively. In fact, learned counsel for the informant had only one\n\n prayer that this Court may direct the local administration to provide\n\n security to the informant but at the same time, he accepts that till\n\n date, the informant has not applied for any security with the local\n\n police and no apparent cause has been shown to the competent\n\n authority who are dealing with the safety and security of a citizen.\n\n 14. It is not disputed that the victim was aged about 21\n\n years at the time of alleged occurrence and the occurrence was not\n\n reported to the police and she had not received any treatment by any\n\n doctor.\n\n 15. Having regard to the submissions noted hereinabove\n\n and the materials which we have gone into for purpose of forming a\n\n prima-facie view, we notice that the victim has herself stated that the\n\n occurrence is of 13.12.2021 but she had lodged this case only on\n\n 25.04.2022, thus, the FIR has been lodged after more than four\n\n months. The occurrence had not been reported to anyone and she had\n\n not gone to any doctor if she had been a victim of a gang rape. We\n\n have also noticed that she has not been able to prove that she was a\n\n student of Urdu Board for graduation and at the same time, she was\n\n graduating from Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College, Sheikhpura. In\n\n course of trial, even it has not been proved prima-facie that on the\n\n date of occurrence, she had left her house at 06:00 AM in the\n\n morning. This Court has also noticed that the immediate cause for\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n 7/7\n\n lodging of the FIR is the so-called media reports in which there were\n\n rumours that she and her mami were being involved in committing\n\n wrong act, considering these aspects of the matter and the\n\n uncontroverted submission of learned senior counsel for the appellant\n\n that the case would stand on identical footing with the other\n\n appellants who have been granted the same privilege, we direct\n\n suspension of sentence and release of the above-named appellant on\n\n bail during pendency of the appeal on furnishing bail bond of Rs.\n\n 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the\n\n like amount each to the satisfaction of learned District and\n\n Sessions Judge, Sheikhpura in connection with Sessions Trial No. 19\n\n of 2023 arising out of Sheikhpura Mahila P.S. Case No. 16 of 2022.\n\n 16. Fine, if any, imposed as part of sentence shall remain\n\n suspended during pendency of the appeal.\n\n 17. It is clarified that the observations made hereinabove\n\n are only prima-facie and tentative in nature for purpose of\n\n consideration of the prayer for bail which would not cause prejudice\n\n to either of the parties.\n\n 18. List this appeal for hearing on it's turn.\n\n (Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J)\n\n ( Jitendra Kumar, J)\nSUSHMA2/-\n\nU T",
