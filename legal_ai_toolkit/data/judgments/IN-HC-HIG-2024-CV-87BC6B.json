Operative portion of the Impugned Award dated 18.05.2023 reads\n\nas under:-\n\n“9 Findings of Tribunal and Award\n\nThe following issues emerge from the various rival\nsubmission made by Claimant and Respondent:\n\n(a) Responsibility and Obligation to obtain AEPS:-\n\nPage 4 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nIt may be brought out that Draft contract was part of\nNIT. Considering various clauses of NIT, Award letter\nand Agreement, Tribunal observed that the obligation\nto obtain and keep valid various licenses, passes and\nother permits which would within its meaning include\nthe AEPs* was solely with the Claimant and not the\nRespondent. The Claimant in its opening statement in\nStatement of Claim had admitted that they were\nproviding ground handling services at airports. They\nhad also filed documents of BCAS# security\nclearance issued to them in respect of Banglore\nairport dated 28-05-2013 (page 117 & 118 of SoC)\nfor proving ground handling services valid for 5\nyears. As per letter BCAS reserves the right to revoke\nthe security clearance at any time without assigning\nany reasons, in the interest of of national/civil\naviation security.\n\nMoreover, no other documents /evidence have been\nproduced by Claimant substantiating their contention\nthat Respondent is responsible for obtaining AEPs.\nThe clauses unambiguously put the onus of obtaining\nAEPs on Claimant.\n\nFurther, no document have been produced by\nClaimant seeking any clarity on this if it was not\nclear to Claimant before making bid as part of its due\ndiligence. The Claimant is one of the three bidder and\nemerged H1 by quoting 42% above the minimum\nMMLF( email dated 5-04-2023 &6-04-2023). This\nindicate the extent of due diligence carried out by the\nClaimant. Claimant being an existing concessionaire\nat airports and as part of his due diligence exercise\nfor bidding for this NIT, it would be reasonable to\n\nPage 5 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nconclude that the Claimant was well aware of its\nobligation to procure AEPs and various permissions\nand permits (process related thereto) that have to be\nobtained for providing meet and greet services in the\nairport premises and also that BCAS is the designated\nauthority for issue of AEPs and not the Respondent.\nBCAS is an independent authority and Respondent\ndoes not have any control over the its functioning and\nprocesses /procedures or decisions. The Tribunal\ncannot go beyond the scope of the contract when the\ncontract states that the obligation to obtain the AEPs\nis that of the Claimant. Therefore in the facts and\ncircumstances Claimant cannot shift its obligation for\nAEPs on Respondent. The Tribunal decides this issue\nagainst the Claimant.\n\n*Airport Entry Pass\n# Bureau of Civil Aviation Security\n\n(b) Whether Respondent extended cooperation in\nresolving the AEPS issue\nFrom the submissions made by the Respondents and\nnot contradicted by Claimant, the Tribunal conclude\nthat Respondent had extended necessary cooperation\nto Claimant in resolving the issue of AEPs.\n\n(c) Based on the rival submission made by Claimant\nand Respondent the Tribunal observed that services\nperformed under the contract can be divided under the\nthree periods. The contract was awarded on 27-06-16\nfor a period of 3 years effective from 27-07-16.\n\nPeriod 09-08-2016 to 16-10-2016\nBased on submissions made by Respondent and\nClaimant Tribunal observed that the operation of\nservices under the contract required issue of AEPs by\nBCAS. Respondent issued temporary passes for the\n\nPage 6 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nperiod 9-08-2016 to 11-08-2016 for Arrival and\nDeparture areas and for 29-08-16 to 16-10-2016 for\nArrival, departure, SHA, immigration areas. These\npasse allowed access to all areas namely Arrival,\nDeparture, Security Hold Area, Immigration for all\nterminals. However, the contention of Claimant that\nthese AEPs allowed access only till check in counters\nand AEPs were not allowed beyond check-in-counters\nresulting in provision of limited services by Claimant is\nnot based on facts.\n\nRespondent have filed noting of its' security\ndepartment confirming issues of AEPs allowing access\nto all areas namely Arrival, Departure, Security Hold\nArea, Immigration during this period Representative of\nClaimant in the meeting called by APD on 4-10-2016\nconfirmed that by and large they are able to provide\nsmooth services except for some issues in custom area\nfor which APD and Claimant agreed for some stop gap\narrangement. The Claimant vide letter dated 18-10-\n2016 while requesting respondent to expedite\nfurnishing of information to BCAS confirmed that\nAEPs are being issued valid for 3 or ten days which is\na big hassle The issuance of AEPs for longer duration\nwill ease the functioning to render our services\nsmoothly.\n\nClaimant vide letter dated 10-03-2017 had applied for\nRenewal (not Fresh) of AEPs for all terminals and\nareas which further confirms that initial passes issued\nby APD Chenna were for all areas. Claimant have not\nfiled any document substantiating its charge that AEPs\nallowed only limited access till check in counters.\nFurther Claimant in the letter dated 7th August, 2018\n(page 73 of SoC)\nconfirmed that rates of Rs750/ and Rs 500/ per pax\nwas levied from 29-08-2016 to 16-10-2016. The\n\nPage 7 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\ntribunal therefore concludes that there was no breach\nof contract by Claimant/respondent and claimant\ncould provided full range of services as per letter of\nAward during this period. Therefore Respondent was\nwithin its rights to charge license fee as per award\nletter for this period.\n\nPeriod From 17-10-2016 to 5-06-2017\nThe Tribunal observed from the rival submissions\nmade by Respondent and Claimant that AEPs issued by\nRespondent expired on 16-10-2016 and AEPs could\nnot be obtained from BCAS despite follow up by\nClaimant and assistance provided by Respondent.\nClaimant informed suspension of services and Services\nremained suspended during this period.\n\nClaimant vide letter dated 9-11-2016 requested\nrespondent to stop charging license fee from 17-10-\n2016. Tribunal conclude that BCAS is designated\nauthority for issue of AEPs. AEPs are issued keeping in\nview the national/aviation security concerns. Claimant\nbeing existing operator was aware of risk /uncertainty\nwith regard to issue of AEPs\nClaimant despite being aware that AEPs for custom\nareas may not be issued ( Refer Minutes of meeting\ndated 4-10-16 and meeting with Bureau of\nImmigration 5-01-17) did not terminate the contract\ninstead unilaterally suspended the services.\nThe Tribunal observed that Respondent based on the\nrequest of Claimant made through letter 9th November,\n2016 did not raise bill for Licence fee for this period\neven though there was breach of contract by Claimant.\nAs such there is no claim for License fee for this\nperiod.\n\nPeriod From 06-06-2017 to 19-04-2018\n\nPage 8 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nAs per Respondents' submission and not rebutted by\nclaimant, Claimant applied for AEPs on 01-06-2017\nfor the permitted ares and requested Respondent vide\nletter dated 8-06-2017 to inform airline, ground\nhandlers and other agencies reopening of Namaskar\nMeet and Greet Service about resumption of services.\nThe Tribunal observed that vide letter dated 17th July\n2017 addressed to AGM (Commercial) Chennai\ninternational Airport Claimant informed Respondent\nresumption of Meet and Greet Services from 11-06-\n2017. Relevant extract of the letter is reproduced\nbelow.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce restart of \"Namaskar\"\n\nMeet and Greet Services at Chennai international\nairport effective from June 11, 2017 with limited areas\nof services from curb side to departure check in\ncounter at price of Rs 300 INR including taxes. This is\ndue to AEP issued only for Arrival and Departure by\nBCAS Other conditions communicated vide letter date\n8th November 2017 for resuming the services were as\nunder.\n\n• License fee be charged only for the days AEPs were\nissued and GGI were able to conduct Services\n•Space Rental shall be paid by GGI in accordance to\nthe invoice raised by AAI for the allotted space under\noccupation of GGI\n• Passenger charges are reduced from Rs 750/&Rs\n500/ per passenger respectively to Rs300/ per\npassenger at both Terminals. The Monthly license fee\nmay be proportionately reduced.\n\n• AAI may kindly take up the issue with BCAS for\nissuance of AEPs for all the areas as mentioned in the\nNIT/Award letter\n\nPage 9 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nTribunal conclude from the above that AEPs for\nArrival and Departure areas were in place by 11-06-\n2017 for providing the services as per revised scope of\nwork.\n\nThe Tribunal observed that BCAS vide letter dated 28-\n04-2017 had decided to permit meet and greet services\nin Airports with following conditions:\n\nthe meet and greet services may be permitted up to Q\narea of pre PESO Points at domestic terminal, check in\narea at international terminal. arrival hall including\nbaggage claim area of domestic and arrival hall of\ninternational terminal other than custom and\nimmigration area\nThe tribunal does not find much substance in the\ncontention of the Claimant that they were not aware of\nthe BCAS letter dated 28-04-2017 before applying for\nAEPs on 1-06-2017 and their communication dated 8th\nJune 2017 to Respondent to resume Services\nHowever, they have admitted they could procure the\nsaid letter at a very late stage but no\nevidence/document was produced confirming the date\non which they could procure the said letter. Even after\nbecoming aware about the letter restricting the\nservices and meeting with Bureau of Immigration 5-\n01-17 Claimant did not took any action to determine\nthe contract but continued to provide truncated\nservices until the expiry of notice period\nTherefore Tribunal conclude that Claimant was aware\nof of BCAS letter dated 28-04-2017 well before making\napplication for AEPs and resumed the truncated\nservices after carrying out detailed viability\nassessment at revised terms. The Tribunal also does\nnot find any substance in the contention of Claimant\nthat Respondent was aware of the conditions contained\n\nPage 10 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nin the BCAS letter dated 28-04-2017 and should not\nhave floated NIT. The NIT was issued in November\n2015 whereas BCAS's letter is dated 28-04-2017 much\nafter NIT and award of work. Therefore, Respondent\nfloated the NIT as per the prevailing scenario and\ncould not have foreseen that such a decision will be\ntaken by BCAS. The Tribunal observed that this is a\nconscious decision of Claimant (after a revised\nbusiness and viability assessment) out of his own\nvolition to resume services at a uniform price of Rs 300\nas against Rs 750/ per pax in the international\nTerminal and Rs 500/ per pax in domestic terminal. No\ndocument from Respondent to Claimant was produced\nby Claimant requesting him for resumption of services.\nThe Tribunal is inclined to agree with the submission\nmade by Respondent that scope of work as per the\naward letter was much wider than the provision of\nmeet-and-greet services in the immigration area alone\n[for which the AEPs were not given) and scope work is\nseverable. Tribunal observed that reduced scope of\nservices included all services except escorting in\nimmigration counters. The Respondents' acceptance of\nrequest of the Claimant to reduce the license fee\nproportionately and charge only for the days when\nthey could conduct business keeping in view its'\nbusiness interest resulted in to legally enforceable\nbinding amended contract. The Claimant continued to\nprovide truncated services till the expiry of notice\nperiod for surrender of contract on 19-04-2018.\nTribunal does not find any substance/merit in the\nClaimant's contention that the Respondent cannot\ncharge any amount from the Claimant despite having\nexploited business opportunity at terms fixed by it and\nagreed to by Respondent. The Claimant through its\nvarious communication to Respondent had made\nrequest to charge license fee at reduced rate and for\n\nPage 11 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nperiod AEPs were issued and they could conduct\nbusiness. Respondent while forwarding the bill for\nRs1,20,41,977/ vide letter dated 11-01-2019 informed\nClaimant that the details regarding AEPs issued for\nthe period of your operations have been reconfirmed\nfrom our security Department as requested by you in\nthe previous meeting at office of Airport Director and\nbill are raised proportionately as requested in your\nletter dated 8-11-2017. The Tribunal finds no reasons\nthat having operated the concession and agreeing to\npay the charges the Claimant can now retract. This\nwill be against the principle of equity justice and fair\nplay. Following the doctrine of Estoppel Claimant does\nnot have any locus standi asking for waiver and\nrefusing to pay License fee and other charges.\nThe Tribunal decides the issue against Claimant and\nClaimant is liable to pay Licensee fee and other\ncharges amounting to Rs 1,20,41,997/.\n\n(c) Fraud/Misrepresentation / Concealment\nThe Tribunal after examining rival submissions\nincluding case laws cited does not find much substance\nin the pleadings of the Claimant alleging\nfraud/misrepresentation / concealment by Respondent\nor for that matter frustration of the contract, status of\ncontract ie.void or voidable, unequal terms as these\nare of no relevance at this stage having exploited the\nbusiness opportunity offered by Respondent through\nthis NIT and accepted by Claimant as per terms and\ncondition of the contract out of his own volition and\nafter due diligence. The Tribunal also observed that\nnot one but three offers was received by the\nRespondent for this facility and the Claimant emerged\nthe highest bidder by quoting 42% above the minimum\nprice which indicate the extent of due diligence carried\nout by the Claimant. Further no such issue was raised\n\nPage 12 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nduring the currency of the contract or for that matter\nbefore DRC. The claimant have not produced any\ndocument to establish the alleged\nmisrepresentation/concealment/ fraud committed by\nthe Respondent so essential to make a contract\nvoid/voidable in terms of\nIndian Contract Act\n1872.\n\nPrima Facie Tribunal does not find much substance in\nthe Claimant's allegation of\nfraud/misrepresentation/concealment. However, these\nissues have criminal connotation and therefore can not\nbe subject matter of arbitration.\n\n(d) Regarding termination of contract and lock in\nperiod. Tribunal observed that license agreement\nprovided for multiple options for Termination of\nContract by either party Termination of Contract by\nClaimant in February 2018 was a conscious business\ndecision to arrest further losses in view of their\ninability to generate enough business as per the\nsubmission vide Annexure 15(Page 165 of SoC) out of\nbusiness interest rather than anything else and it chose\nnot to terminate the contract even when it become\nclear as early as 04-10-2016 that full range of services\ncould not be provided due to issue of AEPs. Claimant\nafter unilateral suspension of services from 16-10-\n2016 to 7-06-2917 unilaterally resumed truncated\nservice at reduced fee from pax and reduced Licence\nfee payment to Respondent. AEPs were valid till\nDecember, 2018 at the time of Termination Tribunal\ncan not step in to their shoes.\n\n(e)Damages\nClaimant have made a claim of Rs 31,11,723/ as\ndamages and filed a certificate of a Chartered\nAccountant. Claimant have brought out that because of\nnon issue of AEPs could generate revenue of Rs\n7,93,765/ and have Incurred cumulative losses of\n\nPage 13 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nRs31,11,723/ which is solely attributable to\nRespondent who could not facilitate AEPs as per\nNIT/award letter. (Pg 175 & 176 of the Statement of\nClaims.)\nRespondent had submitted that it is relevant to note\nthat for a claim of unliquidated damages to be\nsustained, the breach of the agreement has to be\nproved by the Claimant, liability to pay any damages\nwill only arise in the event of a breach of contract. The\nClaimant has not alleged any breach of contract on the\npart of the Respondent except for feeble attempt to\nstate that the Respondents have allocated only 5\ncounters while they had agreed to allocate a total of 8\ncounters in the airport premises. Therefore, there is no\nbreach of the License Agreement by the Respondents\nand hence no damages are to paid by the Respondent.,\nFurther Claimant has not adduced any evidence to\nshow that the amount claimed is in fact the loss caused\nto the Claimant except for a letter from a Charted\nAccountant.\n\nTherefore, In such a position where no evidence is\nprovided to substantiate the losses except for an\nunverified Chartered Accountant certificate whose\ngenuineness and authenticity could not be verified by\nway of cross-examination of the Chartered Accountant\nought to be out rightly rejected.\n\nTribunal is inclined to agree with the submission made\nby respondent that there is no breach on the part of\nRespondent keeping in view that the contract operated\nas per terms of award during 09-08-2016 to 16-10-\n2016 and 11-06-2017 to 19-04-2018 as per amended\nterms and conditions. Services remained suspended by\nClaimant during 16-10-2016 to 10-06-2017.The\nTribunal observed that damages claimed are nothing\nbut losses incurred by the Claimant. Claimant by his\n\nPage 14 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nown statement admitted that Respondent could not\nfacilitate AEPs as per NIT/award letter which ipso\nfacto means that primary obligation to procure AEPs\nis of Claimant. It became clear to Claimant as early as\n04-10-16 that there are cor complexities in the issue of\nAEPs and Claimant failed to take steps to arrest losses,\nthe Tribunal also observed CA certificate is factually\nincorrect as Claimant have not captured the revenue\ngenerated during the 09-08-2016 to 16-10-2016.\nNo evidence has been provided to substantiate the\nlosses except for an unverified Chartered Accountant\ncertificate.\n\nIt was the duty of claimant to mitigate /reduce the\nlosses No such document evidencing any action by\nClaimant in this have been submitted. No other claim\ntowards damages have been made.\n\nThere is no provision in NIT/Agreement guaranteeing\nany minimum business Concession agreement for\noperating a facility does not guarantee any business\nand it is for Concessionaire to generate business and\nassume business risk. The Claimant have failed to\ngenerate business for which Respondent should not be\nmade to suffer.\n\nFurther as per para 8 of Other terms and condition of\nAward Letter stipulated that \"The Authority shall not\nbe in any way, be responsible for any loss suffered by\nthe licensee on account of business and no reduction in\nlicence fee shall be allowed in this account,\" This is\nknown risk undertaken by the Claimant while bidding\nand considered in financial bid.\n\nIn view of the above Tribunal can not allow\nenrichment of Claimant at the cost of Respondent. The\nissue is decided against the Claimant.\n\nPage 15 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n(f) Other Claims\nRefund of advance\nTribunal have decided that Claimant is liable to pay\nLicense fee and other charges amounting to Rs\n1,20,41,997/. Tribunal decides that Advance License\nfee of Rs 14,98,961 is refundable to claimant subject\nto payment of Rs 1,20,41,997 or alternatively\nRespondent may adjust Advance License fee amount\nagainst dues.\n\nReturn of Bank guarantee issued by Claimant\nTribunal have decided that Claimant is liable to pay\nLicense fee and other charges amounting to Rs\n1,20,41,997/ Tribunal decides that Bank Guarantee\nissued by Claimant may be returned to Claimant after\nsatisfaction of dues of Respondent\nDirection to Respondent not to encash Bank\nGuarantee during pendency of Present Arbitration\nProceeding\n\nNo document/ request to bank for encashment of BG\nhave been filed by Respondent or Claimant in this\nmatter. Arbitration Proceedings concluded on 23rd\nMarch, 2023.\n\nTribunal conclude that there is no issue to be decided\nby the Tribunal in this regard.\n\nRefund of Electricity deposit of Rs 1,00,000/-\nTribunal have decided that Claimant is liable to pay\nLicense fee and other charges amounting to Rs\n1,20,41,997/ Tribunal decides that Electricity Deposit\nof Rs100000/ is refundable to claimant subject to\npayment of dues of Respondent\nAward interest@ 12% p.a. on the above prayers (1) to\n\nPage 16 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n(v) from the date of First demand ie 7-08-2018\nTribunal have decided that Claimant is liable to pay\nLicense fee and other charges amounting to Rs\n1,20,41,997/. In view of this the issue is decided\nagainst the Respondent to pay Rs 5,00,000/ towards\nCost of present proceedings\nThe Tribunal have decided all Claims of the Claimant\nagainst Claimant Therefore, the Tribunal does not find\nany merit in the Claim of Rs 5,00,000/ towards cost of\nproceedings. The issue is decided against the\nClaimant.\n\n(g) Respondent in its prayer to Tribunal had prayed\nfor direction to Claimant to pay the due amount of Rs\n1,20,41,977/ along with interest @ 18% p.a. for the\nperiod of delay\nThe Tribunal examined the prayer of the Respondent to\npayment of Rs 1,20,41,997/ along with interest @18%\np.a. for period of delay.Agreement provides as under:\n\nPara 6 The Licence fee shall be paid by 10th day of\nevery English calender month failing which simple\ninterest @12% p.a. on delayed payments for the first\nmonth and thereafter 18% p.a. for maximum of two\nmonths thereafter be payable, as per AAI credit policy\non all delayed payments without prejudice to the\nauthority's other rights and remedies.\nInterest is the cost of capital/funds. By denying the due\npayments of Respondent the respondent was wrongly\ndeprived of usage of these funds Interest is a natural\naccretion on the capital. Payment of interest\nconstitutes a measure of restitution for such unjust\ndeprivation of funds. Therefore Tribunal decided the\nissue of interest in favour of Respondent. Claimant is\nliable to pay the amount due along with interest as per\nagreement.\n\nPage 17 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n(h) The Tribunal also decided to grant Respondent\npendent lite simple interest on the amount due @8%\nfrom the date of invocation of arbitration up to date of\nAward under\nSection 31(7)\nof Arbitration and\nConciliation Act 1996\n\n(i) The award is to be satisfied within a period of\nperiod of three months, failing which the award shall\ncarry compound interest @ 10% p.a. on the awarded\namount from the date of award till its payment.\n\n(j) Before parting with matter The tribunal places on\nrecord its appreciation for the valuable assistance\nrendered Sh Raman Kapoor and by Dr P. K. Ray\nlearned Counsel for Claimant and Shri Raj Jhabakh\nand his team at JM Legal learned Counsel for\nRespondent and Sh.M. Selvanayagams JGM\nCommercial Chennai Airport and his team.\n\nThis award is made in three sets: one each for the\nClaimant one for the Respondents and one to be\nretained by Sole Arbitrator with the requisite stamp\npaper.”\n\n6. The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner had participated in\n\na Tender floated by the respondent for hospitality service in the Chennai\n\nAirport for Meet and Greet Service (Swagat Seva). The petitioner was\n\nawarded the contract vide Annexure-2 on 27.06.2016 by the respondent.\n\nPage 18 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n7. As per the aforesaid award in Annexure-2 dated 27.06.2016, the\n\npetitioner was required to pay License fee for a sum of Rs.12,80,000/- per\n\nmonth for the first year and thereafter Rs.14,08,000/- per month during the\n\nsecond year and Rs.15,48,800/- during the third year.\n\n8. Apart from the above, several other conditions were specified in\n\nthe aforesaid award. A License Agreement was also signed between the\n\npetitioner and the respondent vide Agreement dated 27.07.2016. There is no\n\ndispute regarding the compliance by the petitioner in so far as the amount\n\nthat was to be paid prior to the commencement of service under the\n\nAgreement dated 27.07.2016.\n\n9. It is the case of the petitioner that the respondent had suppressed\n\nmaterial information regarding access to the Airport beyond the ticketing\n\ncounter which was dictated by Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS).\n\nThus, the petitioner was unable to earn revenue to pay the aforesaid amount.\n\nIt is submitted that under these circumstances, the petitioner was\n\nconstrained to apply for the Claim Statement which has been rejected. On\n\nPage 19 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nthe other hand, the Arbitral Tribunal awarded the counter claim of the\n\nrespondent.\n\n10. That apart, it is submitted that the award itself suffers from\n\nViolation of\nSection 12\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read\n\nwith Schedule 7 to the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nas the Arbitral\n\nTribunal constituted was without authority of law.\n\n11. It is submitted that the Arbitrator appointed was a former\n\nemployee of the respondent. It is submitted that even though the petitioner\n\nhad expressed consent for appointment of the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator was\n\nincapacitated from acting as an Arbitrator in view of\nSection 12(1)\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with\nSection 5\nread with Clause\n\n(1) of VII of the Schedule Arbitration in the light of the decision of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nTRF Limited Vs. Energo Engineering Project\n\nLimited\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377.\n\nPage 20 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n12.\nIn this connection, the learned counsel for the petitioner placed\n\nreliance on the decision of the Honble Supreme Court in the case of\nBharat\n\nBroadband Network Limited vs. United Telecoms Limited\n, (2019) 5\n\nSCC 755. A specific reference was made to Paragraph 20 from the\n\naforesaid decision.\n\n13. It is submitted that Clause 30 of the General Terms and\n\nConditions of the License Agreement dated 27.07.2016 is void ab initio and\n\nunenforceable and as such, any Award passed in furtherance thereto is liable\n\nto be set aside. It is submitted that the courts have held in a catena of\n\ndecisions that an arbitration agreement/clause providing for such unilateral\n\nappointment of a Sole Arbitrator is void ab initio. The respondent contends\n\nthat they provided a panel from which the petitioner chose an option. This\n\nwould not aid the respondent once the appointment procedure under the\n\nagreement becomes non est and the only recourse would be for\n\nappointment of a neutral arbitrator under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996.\n\nPage 21 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n14. It is submitted that the Sole Arbitrator, Mr. Rajesh Bhandari was a\n\nformer Executive Director (F&A) of the first respondent. Thus, he was\n\nineligible for appointment in view of the statutory bar under\nSection 12(5)\n\nr/w. Entry 1 to the\nVII Schedule to the Act\n. Courts have repeatedly held that\n\nan Award passed by a person who is ineligible for appointment as an\n\nArbitrator is bad in law and unenforceable.\n\n15. It is submitted that de hors the above, the fact that the petitioner\n\nselected a name does not aid the case of the respondent since there was no\n\nexpress agreement in writing as envisaged under the proviso to\nSection\n\n12(5)\nof the Act. It is further submitted that there is no agreement\n\nspecifically recording the issue of disqualification/ineligibility of the\n\nArbitrator and a clear/specific waiver of the same from the petitioner after\n\nthe dispute had arisen between the parties. Hence, the\n\ndisqualification/ineligibility will operate under\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act.\n\nPage 22 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n16. It is further submitted that as such, the arbitration clause,\n\nappointment procedure, right to appoint, choice of arbitrator etc., are all bad\n\nin law, in view of which the Award ought to be set aside.\n\n17. It is further submitted that the right of unilateral appointment to\n\nan interest party makes the arbitration clause non est. Further, apart from the\n\nfact that the appointed arbitrator cannot suffer statutory ineligibility, the\n\nperson appointing/nominating the arbitrator also should be eligible to be\n\nappointed as an Arbitrator. Hence, the arbitration clause void and\n\nunenforceable. Further, the Chairman/Member of the first respondent being\n\nineligible under the A&C Act, any appointment made by him whether single\n\nor by way of a panel is hit by\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act. In the present case,\n\nthe proviso to\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act not being fulfilled, the appointment\n\nand the consequent Award are bad in law.\n\n18. It is further submitted that the Respondent, at the time of\n\nadmission, made a frail attempt to portray the selection of the Sole\n\nPage 23 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nArbitrator from a panel as being exempt from Proviso to\nSection 12(5)\nof\n\nthe Act by referring to Central Organisation for\nRailway Electrification\n\n(CORE) vs. ECI-SPIC-SMO- MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Co.\n, (2020)\n\n14 SCC 712, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that an\n\narbitration clause providing for a panel of arbitrators from which selection\n\nof a sole arbitrator was to be made was permissible in law.\n\n19. It is further submitted that in CORE, the arbitration clause\n\nprovided for a panel, however, in the instant case, it provided for\n\nappointment of a Sole Arbitrator by the Chairman/Member. Hence\n,\nthe said\n\njudgment\nwould not apply.\n\nIn any event, the view taken in CORE has been\n\ndoubted and referred to a larger bench by two separate Co-ordinate Benches\n\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nUnion of India vs. Tantia Constructions\n\nLimited\n, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 271 and JSW Steel Ltd. Vs. South\n\nWestern Railway Ltd., 2022 SCC Online SC 1973, in which reference,\n\nhearing is ongoing.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that a Coordinate Bench of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court has distinguished the findings in CORE\n\nsubsequently in\nGlock Asia-Pacific Limited Vs. Union of India\n, (2023) 8\n\nPage 24 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nSCC 226, to hold that the disqualification/ineligibility will continue to apply\n\nto such appointment and the Award.\n\n20. It is submitted that selecting one name from the panel provided\n\nby the Respondent would not amount to an express waiver as per\nSection\n\n12(5)\nof the Act, as the provision clearly mandates that the parties must\n\nenter into a separate agreement in writing, after a dispute has arisen, to\n\nexpressly waive such disqualification. This position was further confirmed\n\nin the case of Bharat Broadband.\n\n21. It is further submitted that in the case of\nP.Cheran vs. Gemini\n\nIndustries and Imaging Ltd.\nreported in 2023 SCC Online Mad 1887, this\n\nHon'ble Court has held that participation in the arbitral proceedings or\n\nhaving knowledge of the appointment of the arbitrator would not deprive\n\nthe rights of the Petitioner to challenge the appointment of the Arbitrator in\n\nterms of\nSection 34\nof the Act setting forth the violation of\nSection 12(5)\nof\n\nthe Act. This is also in line with the scheme of the Act which provides under\n\nSections 11\n&\nand based on judgments, under\nSection 34\nof the Act that\n\nthis issue can be raised at any stage.\n\nPage 25 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n22. It is submitted that the Meet and Greet Service for which the\n\ntender was floated by the Respondent, involves assisting passengers in\n\ncompleting all necessary formalities at the airport, from check-in all the way\n\nto upto boarding of flight and vice-versa. This service entails providing\n\nassistance to passengers in the (SHA) Security Hold Areas too, for which an\n\n(AEP) Aerodrome Entry Permit had to be obtained from BCAS. Admittedly\n\nthe Respondent was in the know that BCAS was not providing AEPs to any\n\nthird parties. The said decision of BCAS was communicated to all airports,\n\nincluding Chennai airport vide their communication dated 28.04.2017\n\ninforming them that the Meet and Greet Services may be permitted only till\n\nCheck-in counter and at the Arrival hall other than the Customs and\n\nImmigration Area. The Respondents however did not divulge the details of\n\nthe said communication to the Petitioner however kept informing the\n\nPetitioner that they would facilitate the process of obtaining the AEP from\n\nBCAS.\n\n23. It is submitted that the File Notings of the respondents, which\n\nwere placed on record during the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC)\n\nPage 26 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nproceedings, which preceded the arbitration, clearly reveals that the\n\nRespondents were all along aware that there were restrictions placed on\n\nissuance of AEP. The DRC in its report, in particular in the paragraph titled\n\n\"Observation\" had clearly stated as follows:\n\n\"Committee has come across during the course\nof the hearing and documents produced that the\nprevious contract for the Meet and Greet\nService was cancelled based on non-issuance of\nAEP by BCAS. Commercial Directorate should\nhave reviewed the tender condition before\ninviting fresh tender to avoid\ndisputes/litigation.\"\n\n24. It is further submitted that the respondents were fully aware of\n\nthe issues with regard to the issuance of AEP and the earlier contract itself\n\ncame to be cancelled because of that. However, without consideration of the\n\nsame, and suppressing the restrictions placed on the AEP issuance and\n\nwithout reviewing the terms of the Tender, the Respondents had floated the\n\nsubsequent tender.\n\n25. It is further submitted that in the case of Esso Petroleum Co.\n\nLtd. v. Mardon, [1976] ECWA Civ 4, the Court of Appeal in England,\n\nPage 27 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nconsidered whether the promises of a petroleum company that a particular\n\nstation would sell 400,000 gallons a year despite a material change in the\n\nposition of the petrol station that would affect the prospect was held to be a\n\nmisrepresentation. The Court therein held that a statement as to potential\n\nthroughput was a contractual warranty for it was a factual statement on a\n\ncrucial matter made by a party who had, or professed to have special\n\nknowledge. The statement was made with the intention to induce another to\n\nenter into a contract, and thus such contract was formed. The party making\n\nsuch a statement would be in breach of the warranty and liable in damages\n\nfor the breach.\n\n26. It is submitted that the contract from its very inception was\n\nimpossible to perform as BCAS was not convinced to provide AEP to the\n\npersonnel of the contractors who are engaged in Meet and Greet Services in\n\nthe SHA. It is submitted that the Respondent was well aware that AEP\n\nwould not be issued by BCAS but still proceeded to float a tender with\n\nconditions that the Meet and Greet Services must be provided in the SHA\n\nalso.\n\nPage 28 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n27. It is also submitted that assuming without admitting for a\n\nmoment, if the service to be provided by the petitioner is restricted outside\n\nthe SHA, then passengers would not be interested in availing the services\n\noffered by the petitioner as the same is of no use to them. It is also factually\n\nthe case of the petitioner that factually the services were rendered outside\n\nthe SHA and therefore did not garner any patronage from the passengers as\n\nthey felt it was not helpful at all, apart from the fact that the passengers were\n\nnot willing to pay for such partial services. Therefore, as per\nSection 56\nof\n\nthe Indian Contract Act, the contract was impossible and incapable of being\n\nperformed and therefore was void.\n\n28. It is further submitted that it is thus clear as day that the contract\n\nentered between the petitioner and the respondents was void and did not\n\nbind the petitioner same cannot be the basis of any legal/contractual\n\nobligations. The respondent having entered into the contract with the\n\nknowledge that the petitioner would not be able to perform its obligations\n\nunder the contract is precluded from enforcing the terms of the contract,\n\nPage 29 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nhowever, the respondent would still be liable to make good for the loss\n\nsuffered by the petitioner.\n\n29. It is submitted that the respondent, in all fairness, ought not have\n\ninvited the tender in the present case as they were fully aware that the no\n\nsuccessful tenderer would be able to render services to the Passengers in the\n\nSHA.\n\n30. It is submitted that the respondent is also guilty of\n\nmisrepresenting to the petitioner while entering into the contract. The\n\nrespondent having knowledge that the AEP which is a sine qua non for\n\nentering the SHA of the Airport and for which permit is not being issued by\n\nBCAS, had concealed the same from the Petitioner. As submitted earlier,\n\nMinistry of Civil Aviation exercises administrative control over BCAS, the\n\n1 Respondent and the Director General of Civil Aviation.\n\n31. It is further submitted that since the first respondent as well as\n\nBCAS are both administratively controlled by the Ministry of Civil\n\nPage 30 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nAviation, it is obvious that the first respondent was fully aware about the\n\nregulations/guidelines with regard to issuance of AEP by BCAS. Despite\n\nhaving full knowledge that BCAS was not issuing AEPs citing security\n\nconcerns and admittedly, the earlier contract entered by the Respondent was\n\ncancelled on the same issue, the respondents have failed to intimate the\n\nPetitioner regarding the same.\n\n32. It is therefore submitted that apparent that the Respondent was\n\nguilty of misrepresenting that they would facilitate the issuance of AEPs,\n\nwhile knowing that BCAS has denied permission to provide Meet and Greet\n\nServices in the SHA. It is submitted that these actions of the respondents\n\nclearly amounts to suppression.\n\n33. It is therefore submitted that the Sole Arbitrator has failed to\n\nconsider this legal issue in the Award and has mechanically proceeded to\n\npass the Award in favour of the respondent, his former employer.\n\nPage 31 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n34. It is submitted that the Respondent being a Government\n\nenterprise, falls within the definition of 'State' under\nArticle 12\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Therefore, the respondent is expected to meet a higher\n\nstandard of transparency than a private party when engaging in business\n\ntransactions. The respondents having public element cannot act arbitrarily\n\nor suppress material facts even in contractual matters as it is violative of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. It is submitted that the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has held in\nKumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and Others vs.\n\nState of UP and others\n, (1991) 1 SCC 212, that State action cannot be\n\narbitrary and in violation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n35. That apart, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner also drew\n\nattention to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\nKumari\n\nShrilekha Vidyarthi and Others vs. State of U.P. and Others\n, (1991) 1\n\nSCC 212, wherein, it was held that in contractual matters, any such act of\n\nthe State or a public body adversely affect the public interest. It is\n\nsubmitted that every holder of a public office is a trustee whose highest duty\n\nis to the people of the country and, therefore, every act of the holder of a\n\nPage 32 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\npublic office, irrespective of the label classifying that act, is in discharge of\n\npublic duty meant ultimately for public good. A specific reference was\n\nmade to Paragraph 27 of the aforesaid decision.\n\n36. It is therefore submitted that the actions of the respondent in\n\nfloating and awarding the tender after being informed of the fact that the\n\nBCAS would not issue AEP for the petitioner is condemnable. Had this been\n\nset forth in the tender document, then the petitioner would not have even\n\nventured to submit its bid. This renders the action of the respondent being a\n\nState Enterprise violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n37. Therefore, it is submitted that the Contract entered between the\n\npetitioner and the respondent has become void as the same was impossible\n\nof performance by the petitioner and the respondent who had entered into\n\nthe contract knowing fully-well that the petitioner would not be in a position\n\nto perform the same is definitely not entitled to any relief. However, the\n\nSole Arbitrator has failed to consider this aspect as well.\n\nPage 33 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n38. It is further stated that the entire procedure from the\n\neligibility/qualification of the Arbitrator, to the power to appoint him and\n\nthe procedure of appointment are also bad in law, vitiating the entire\n\nproceeding that took place thereafter, culminating in the Award. Such\n\nAwards have been declared to be void and unenforceable and this is a case\n\nwhere impartiality and inequality between the parties are clearly seen at\n\nevery stage.\n\n39. A reference is made to the decision of Calcutta High Court in\n\nCholamandalam Investment & Finance Company Ltd. v. Amrapali\n\nEnterprises & Anr.\n, 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 605. De hors this contention,\n\neven on the merit of the matter, the Award is in conflict with the basic\n\nnotions of morality and justice as the contract is frustrated and is fraught\n\nwith misrepresentation and hence, is in conflict with the public policy of\n\nIndia and deserves to be interfered with.\n\n40. It is submitted that there should be an express agreement in\n\nwriting for such waiver.\nIn this case, it is submitted that the applicant was\n\nPage 34 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nunaware of the law settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\nPerkins\n\nEastman Architects DPC and Another vs. HSCC (INDIA) Limited\n,\n\n(2020) 20 SCC 760 and therefore, even though the petitioner had consented\n\nfor appointment of the Arbitrator on 08.06.2022, the consent cannot be\n\nconstrued to be a valid consent in terms of proviso to\nSection 12(5)\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n41. A further reference was made by the learned Senior Counsel to\n\nthe decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in\nP.Cheran vs.\n\nGemini Industries and Imaging Limited\n, 2323 SCC OnLine Mad 1887. A\n\nspecific reference was made to Paragraphs 21 & 23 of the aforesaid\n\ndecision.\n\n42. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would submit that\n\nthe impugned Award passed by the learned Arbitrator suffers from patent\n\nillegality and therefore attracts the sting under\nSection 34\n(2-\nA) of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n.\n\nPage 35 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n43. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would further\n\nsubmit that the award is also liable to be interfered with and set aside in\n\nterms of\nSection 34(2)(b)(ii)\nread with Explanation (i) (ii) & (iii).\n\n44. It is submitted that the previous contractor namely Akbar Travels\n\nwithdrew the service as the access was limited upto the ticketing counter\n\nand therefore, the Tender that was floated subsequently which induced the\n\npetitioner of a false promise that the petitioner will be able to earn amounts\n\nfor Meet and Greet Service (Swagat Seva) at Chennai Airport after investing\n\na huge sum towards the License Fee, Security Deposit etc.\n\n45.\nIn this connection, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has\n\ndrawn attention to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\nMotilal\n\nPadampat Sugar Mills Co.Ltd., vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others\n,\n\n(1979) 2 SCC 409. It is submitted that there can be no waiver unless the\n\nperson who is said to have waived is fully informed as to his right and with\n\nfull knowledge of such right, he intentionally abandons it. A specific\n\nreference was made to Paragraph 6 from\nthe said decision\n.\n\nPage 36 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n46. It is therefore prayed for setting aside the impugned Award dated\n\n18.05.2023, passed by the Sole Arbitrator in respect of the disputes between\n\nthe petitioner and the first respondent under the License Agreement dated\n\n27.07.2016.\n\n47. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner also relied on the\n\nfollowing decisions:-\n\ni.\nTRF Limited Vs. Energo Engineering Project Limited\n,\n(2017) 8 SCC 377.\n\nii.\nHRD Corporation Vs. Gail\n, (2018) 12 SCC 471.\niii.Prime Store, rep. by its Partner and others Vs.\nSugam Vanijya Holdings Private Limited and others,\n2023 SCC OnLine Mad 2898.\n\niv.\nSteelman Telecom Limited Vs. Power Grid\nCorporation of India Ltd.\n, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 4849.\n\n48. Defending the impugned Award, the learned Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral for the respondents would submit that the Award is well reasoned\n\nand does not call any interference in the hands of this Court under\nSection\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\nPage 37 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n49. It is submitted that indeed there was a waiver in accordance with\n\nSection 12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n50. It is submitted that in accordance with the terms of the Arbitration\n\nClause, the respondents had sent the names of the following five persons to\n\nthe petitioner on 06.06.2022 to be nominated as Arbitrator:-\n\ni.Sh.L.R.Garg, IAS (Retd.);\n\nii. Sh.Madhukar Gupta, Ex. Addl. Chief Secretary & Principal\nResident Commissioner\niii. Sh.N.Krishnamoorthi, DGW, (Retd.), CPWD;\niv. Sh.Rajesh Bhandari, Ex.Executive Director (F&A), AAI;\nv. Sh.S.K.Gupta, Ex.Executive Director (Engg.), AAI.\n\n51. It is submitted that the petitioner consented for appointment of\n\nSh.Rajesh Bhandari, Ex.Executive Director (F&A), AAI as the Arbitrator\n\nvide E-Mail dated 08.06.2022. It is therefore submitted that the challenge to\n\nthe impugned Award on the ground that the learned Arbitrator suffered from\n\ndisqualification under\nSection 12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 read with Schedules V and VII of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 cannot be countenanced. It is submitted that it has to be construed that\n\nPage 38 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nthere was an ‘express agreement’ in view of Email dated 18.06.2022 of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n52. It is submitted that in\nBharat Broadband Network Limited vs.\n\nUnited Telecoms Limited\n, (2019) 5 SCC 755, the appointment of sole\n\nArbitrator was made by the CMD contrary to the decision of the Hon’ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of TRF Limited referred to supra rendered on\n\n03.07.2017, where an application for terminating the mandate was filed\n\nunder\nSections 14\nand\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n53. It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner\n\nhaving participated in the appointment of the Arbitrator and thereafter in the\n\nArbitral Proceedings, the petitioner is now precluded from raising\n\nobjections in relation to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator at this juncture. It\n\nis submitted that the petitioner argued that the award of the Arbitrator will\n\nnot be challenged on the ground that the award of the Arbitrator appointed\n\nwas an employee and that the appointment of the Arbitrator will not be\n\nchallenged or be open to question in any Court of Law, on this account.\n\nPage 39 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nDispute Resolution Clause as contained in the License Agreement reads as\n\nunder : -\n\n\"All disputes and differences arising out of or in\nany way touching or concerning this Agreement\n(except those the decision whereof is otherwise\nherein before expressly provided for or to which\nthe Public Premises [Eviction of Unauthorised\nOccupants] Act and the rules framed thereunder\nwhich are now enforced or which may hereafter\ncome into force are applicable) shall, in the first\ninstance.

The award of the Arbitrator so appointed\n\nPage 40 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nas aforesaid is or has been an employee of the\nAuthority and the appointment of the Arbitrator\nwill not be challenged or be open to question in\nany Court of Law, on this account.”\n\n54. Therefore, as provided for hereinabove, the existing arbitration\n\nclause as per the License Agreement provided for a unilateral appointment\n\nby the representative of the first respondent herein. It is an admitted fact that\n\nclauses of such nature are bad in law which the Supreme Court clarified\n\nsuccinctly in Perkins Eastman Architects DPC referred to supra.\n\nHowever, the actual appointment of the arbitrator, subsequent to the DRC\n\nproceedings, were done in a manner that was a clear departure from the\n\narbitration clause mentioned above.\n\n55. It is submitted that as evinced by the petitioner communication\n\ndated 09.02.2022, a request was made by the petitioner themselves for\n\nappointment of an arbitrator. In response thereto, the representative of the\n\nfirst respondent responded, by providing a panel of arbitrators from which\n\nthe petitioner was provided with an option of choosing an arbitrator. It is\n\npertinent to note that the panel contained 5 names of which only two names\n\nPage 41 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nwere ex-employees of the first respondent. The other three names were\n\nunconnected persons being retired officers of high ranking posts in other\n\npublic sector undertakings.\n\n56. It was the petitioner who vide, communication dated 08.06.2022,\n\nconveyed its consent for the appointment of one Mr. Rajesh Bhandari, Ex.\n\nExecutive Director (F&A), AAI.\n\n57. Such panel appointments, where the panel is provided by one\n\nparty and the nominee is picked by the other Party, has been discussed\n\nextensively and upheld in\nVoestalpine Schienen GMBH v. Delhi Metro\n\nRail Corporation Limited\n, (2017)4 SCC 645 wherein, it was held that\n\nwhen a broad panel to choose from has been provided to one party, despite\n\nthe panel containing names of past employees of the said Party, would not\n\nlead the presumption of impartiality and neutrality as envisaged under\n\nSection 12\nof the Act. This was because a counter-balancing of rights was\n\ncreated where the panel was picked by one party, with the ultimate choice of\n\nappointment being left to the other Party. This was further fortified by the\n\nPage 42 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in Central Organisation for Railway\n\nElectrification referred to supra.\n\n58. It is therefore submitted that having willingly and without demur,\n\nacted in departure from the arbitration clause and having exercised its\n\nchoice in appointing an arbitrator from a panel that was provided to it, the\n\npetitioner is precluded from now raising the same as a ground in the present\n\nPetition. In the event that the petitioner had any concern in relation to the\n\nsaid appointment of the Arbitrator, that it so willingly chose, it ought to\n\nhave exercised the rights provided to it under\nSection 13(2)\nof the Act.\n\n59. It is further submitted that\nSection 13(2)\nstates that in the absence\n\nof the parties having agreed to a procedure for appointment of arbitrator, the\n\nparty that intends to challenge an arbitrator, shall, within 15 days after\n\nbecoming aware of the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal or after\n\nbecoming aware of any circumstances as provided in\nSection 12(3)\n, send a\n\nwritten statement of the reasons for such challenge to the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nPage 43 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n60. It is further submitted that as per\nSection 13(4)\nand\n13(5)\n, only\n\nupon such challenge being unsuccessful before the Tribunal and an arbitral\n\naward being passed by the arbitrator, the said Party can raise the said ground\n\nin a challenge under\nSection 34\nof the Act.\n\n61. It is submitted that admittedly, the petitioner never filed any\n\nApplication or made any Statement under\nSection 13(2)\nof the Act. On the\n\ncontrary, it was the petitioner that chose the Arbitrator from a panel of\n\narbitrators and willingly participated in the arbitral proceedings.\n\n62. It is the contention of the petitioner that the respondent, being\n\naware of the fact that the BCAS was unlikely to provide the AEP to the\n\npetitioner for the purposes of the provision of services, misrepresented the\n\nsame to the Petitioner and has thus committed fraud. Further, owing to the\n\nnon-grant of the AEP, the act envisaged by the contract is now impossible,\n\nthereby rendering it void as per\nSection 54\nof the Contract Act.\n\nPage 44 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n63. It is also submitted that as far as the contention of fraud is\n\nconcerned, the same was not the ground for filing the petition under\nsection\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and hence cannot be\n\nargued. Even proceeding on a demurrer that the ground could be admitted, it\n\nis pertinent to note that\nSection 17\nof the Contract Act provides an inclusive\n\ndefinition of the term \"fraud\". Similarly, as far as the contention of\n\nmisrepresentation is concerned,\nSection 18\nof the Contract Act provides an\n\ninclusive definition of the term \"misrepresentation\".\n\n64. It is further submitted that the law that becomes relevant in this\n\nregard is\nSection 2(i)\nof the Contract Act that defines a “voidable contract”\n\nto be one that is enforceable by law at the option of one party but not at the\n\noption of the other. Further, pertinently,\nSection 2(j)\nof the Contract Act\n\nstates that \"a contract which ceases to be enforceable by law becomes void\n\nwhen it ceases to be enforceable\". When read together, it would indicate that\n\nwhen a party, at whose option a contract is said to be enforceable, does not\n\nso do, then the contract would become void.\n\nPage 45 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n65. It is submitted that the conduct of the petitioner is to be noticed. It\n\nis the contention of the petitioner that the respondent herein misrepresented\n\nfacts to the Petitioner. If this is taken to be true, the said Agreement came to\n\nbe voidable at the option of the petitioner. In accordance with\nSection 2\n()),\n\nthe Agreement would only become void if the petitioner herein rescinded\n\nthe Agreement and made it unenforceable.\nSection 27\nof the Specific Relief\n\nAct, 1963 is relevant. As per the said Section, a party may sue to have a\n\ncontract rescinded where the contract is voidable at its option.\n\n66. However, much to the contrary, the petitioner herein sought to\n\ncontinue the operations and provide services at revised and updated terms as\n\nidentified hereinabove instead of rescinding the contract. This is fortified by\n\nthe petitioner's action of continuing to perform the Agreement on revised\n\nterms, of its own accord. This is evinced by the communication dated\n\n17.07.2017 of the petitioner indicating that the Meet & Greet services have\n\nresumed from 11.06.2017.\n\nPage 46 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n67. It is further submitted that notwithstanding the above, the\n\nexception to\nSection 19\nof the Contract Act would indicate that if the Party\n\nat whose option a contract is voidable, could have discovered the trust with\n\nordinary diligence, then the said contract would no longer be voidable. In\n\nthis regard it is necessary to draw reference to the\nAircraft Act, 1934\n.\n\nSection 2(2)\ndefines an Aerodrome, which would necessarily mean the\n\nspace within which the Petitioner was to provide services.\nSection 5\nof the\n\nAircraft Act further stipulates that the Central Government may by\n\nnotification make rules for the manufacture, possession, use and operation\n\nof aircrafts and for securing the safety of aircraft operations. In the exercise\n\nof such power, the Aircraft (Security) Rules, 2011 were published and\n\nnotified as under:-\n\na. “The said rules have been superseded by the\nRules of 2023, however, for the purpose of the\npresent Petition, the Rules of 2011 remain\npertinent. Rule 2(1)(c) of the Rules define an\n\"Aerodrome Entry Permit\" to mean a photo\nidentity card, smart card or temporary permit\nissued by the Commissioner of Security (Civil\nAviation), Bureau of Civil Aviation Security,\nMinistry of Civil Aviation or any person\nauthorised by the Central Government for entry\n\nPage 47 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\ninto the aerodrome or part of an aerodrome.\nb. Rule 2(g) defines \"Commissioner\" as the\nCommissioner of Security (Civil Aviation),\nBureau of Civil Aviation Security, Ministry of\nCivil Aviation who shall be appropriate authority\nfor the requirements of Annex 17.\n\nc. Rule 2(u) of the Rules states that \"security\"\nmeans a combination of measures, human and\nmaterial resources intended to be used to\nsafeguard civil aviation against acts of unlawful\ninterference;\n\nd. Rule 2(x) of the Rules define \"security restricted\narea\" means airside areas of an airport into\nwhich access is controlled to ensure security of\ncivil aviation including passenger areas between\nthe screening check point and the aircraft, the\nramp, baggage mark-up area, cargo sheds, mail\ncenter, airside catering and aircraft cleaning\npremises;\n\ne. Rules 18 and 19 of the Rules set out the\nrestrictions on the entry into the aerodrome and\nsecurity restricted area. The rules specify that\naccess will only be granted to those that have the\nAEP and the same shall be issued only by the\nCommissioner after due verification. The Central\nGovernment may direct any other person to issue\nsuch AEP. The access to the aerodrome with the\nAEP or without shall be entirely at the will and\nverification of the Commissioner and/or the\naerodrome operator and the same is not within\nthe control of any other authority including the\nRespondents herein”.\n\nPage 48 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n68. Therefore, at the time of participating in the tender, it is presumed\n\nthat the Petitioner herein would acquaint itself with the applicable laws and\n\nrules to the services that it was meant to bind them. It is pertinent to state\n\nthat as per the clauses in the letter of award granted to the Petitioner and the\n\nLicense Agreement dated 27.07.2016 was executed between the Parties. It\n\nwas solely the responsibility of the Petitioner to obtain necessary permits\n\nand licenses that will be required to provide the services under the\n\nAgreement.\n\n69. It is therefore submitted that the petitioner, knowingly executed\n\nthe Agreement and accepted the obligations of obtaining all permits and\n\nlicenses upon itself alone, cannot presently state that it was the\n\nRespondent's obligation to facilitate the same. Further, no act of\n\nmisrepresentation has taken place and even if it be admitted that there was a\n\nmisrepresentation, in argue do, the petitioner consciously refrained from\n\nexercising the rights available to it to render the Agreement void and instead\n\nchose to consciously and by express consent and communication in this\n\nPage 49 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nregard, continued to perform the obligations under the Agreement. It is\n\ntherefore prayed for dismissal of this petition.\n\n70. The learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the\n\nfollowing decisions:-\n\ni. Central Organisation for\nRailway Electrification\nVs. ECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML (JV) A Joint\nVenture Company\n, (2020) 14 SCC 712.\n\nii.\nGovernment of Haryana PWD Haryana (B and\nR) Branch Vs. G.F.Toll Road Private Limited\nand others\n, (2019) 3 SCC 505.\n\n71. I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner and the respondent. I have perused the documents filed by\n\nboth parties.\n\n72.\nIn\nBharat Broadband Network Limited Vs. United Telecoms\n\nLimited\n, (2019) 5 SCC 755, the Hon’ble Supreme Court referred to\nSection\n\n12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and held as under:-\n\n“20. This then brings us to the applicability of the\nproviso to\nSection 12(5)\non the facts of this case.\nUnlike\nSection 4\nof the Act which deals with\ndeemed waiver of the right to object by conduct,\n\nPage 50 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nthe proviso to\nSection 12(5)\nwill only apply if\nsubsequent to disputes having arisen between the\nparties, the parties waive the applicability of sub-\nsection (5) of\nSection 12\nby an express agreement\nin writing. For this reason, the argument based\non the analogy of\nSection 7\nof the Act must also\nbe rejected.\nSection 7\ndeals with arbitration\nagreements that must be in writing, and then\nexplains that such agreements may be contained\nin documents which provide a record of such\nagreements. On the other hand,\nSection 12(5)\n\nrefers to an “express agreement in writing”. The\nexpression “express agreement in writing” refers\nto an agreement made in words as opposed to an\nagreement which is to be inferred by conduct.\nHere,\nSection 9\nof the Contract Act, 1872\nbecomes important. It states:\n\n“9. Promises, express and implied.—Insofar as\nthe proposal or acceptance of any promise\nis made in words, the promise is said to be\nexpress. Insofar as such proposal or\nacceptance is made otherwise than in words,\nthe promise is said to be implied.”\nIt is thus necessary that there be an “express”\nagreement in writing. This agreement must be\nan agreement by which both parties, with full\nknowledge of the fact that Shri Khan is\nineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, still\ngo ahead and say that they have full faith and\nconfidence in him to continue as such. The facts\nof the present case disclose no such express\nagreement. The appointment letter which is\nrelied upon by the High Court as indicating an\nexpress agreement on the facts of the case is\ndated 17-1-2017. On this date, the Managing\n\nPage 51 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nDirector of the appellant was certainly not aware\nthat Shri Khan could not be appointed by him as\n\nSection 12(5)\nread with the Seventh Schedule\nonly went to the invalidity of the appointment of\nthe Managing Director himself as an arbitrator.\nShri Khan's invalid appointment only became\nclear after the declaration of the law by the\nSupreme Court in\nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo\nEngg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4\nSCC (Civ) 72] which, as we have seen\nhereinabove, was only on 3-7-2017.\n\nAfter this\ndate, far from there being an express agreement\nbetween the parties as to the validity of Shri\nKhan's appointment, the appellant filed an\napplication on 7-10-2017 before the sole\narbitrator, bringing the arbitrator's attention to\nthe judgment in\nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo\nEngg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4\nSCC (Civ) 72] and asking him to declare that he\nhas become de jure incapable of acting as an\narbitrator. Equally, the fact that a statement of\nclaim may have been filed before the arbitrator,\nwould not mean that there is an express\nagreement in words which would make it clear\nthat both parties wish Shri Khan to continue as\narbitrator despite being ineligible to act as such.\nThis being the case, the impugned judgment is not\ncorrect when it applies\nSection 4\n,\nSection 7\n,\n\nSection 12(4)\n,\nSection 13(2)\nand\nSection 16(2)\nof\nthe Act to the facts of the present case, and goes\non to state that the appellant cannot be allowed to\nraise the issue of eligibility of an arbitrator,\nhaving itself appointed the arbitrator. The\njudgment under appeal is also incorrect in stating\nthat there is an express waiver in writing from the\nfact that an appointment letter has been issued by\n\nPage 52 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nthe appellant, and a statement of claim has been\nfiled by the respondent before the arbitrator. The\nmoment the appellant came to know that Shri\nKhan's appointment itself would be invalid, it\nfiled an application before the sole arbitrator for\ntermination of his mandate.\n\n73. Paragraph Nos.21 & 23 in\nP.Cheran Vs. Gemini Industries &\n\nImaging Limited\n, rep. by its Official Liquidator, 2023 SSC OnLine Mad\n\n1887, it was observed as under:-\n\n“21. Keeping in mind the provisions of law and the\nrelevant case laws relied on by the parties and the\narguments advanced by the learned counsel for the\nParties, this Court is inclined to deal with the issue as\nregards the validity of the unilateral appointment of\nthe learned Sole Arbitrator without providing express\nagreement in writing by the petitioners in terms of\nproviso of\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act.\n\n23. The first principle of natural justice is ‘nemo\njudex in causa sua’ which means ‘no man can be a\njudge in his own cause’. This principle intends to\navoid any ‘reasonable apprehension of bias’ that may\narise during any judicial process.\nSection 12\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 lays down\nprovisions for the appointment of an Arbitrator and\nconditions where the appointment may be valid or\ninvalid”\n\n74.\nIn\nMotilal Padampat Sugar Mill Co. Ltd., Vs. State of Uttar\n\nPradesh and others\n, (1979) 2 SCC 409, the Court held as under:-\n\nPage 53 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n“6. Secondly, it is difficult to see how, on the facts, the\nplea of waiver could be said to have been made out\nby the State Government. Waiver means abandonment\nof a right and it may be either express or implied from\nconduct, but its basic requirement is that it must be\n“an intentional act with knowledge”. Per Lord\nChelmsford, L.C. in Earl of Darnley v. London,\nChatham and Dover Rly. Co. [(1867) LR 3 HL 43, 57\n: 16 LT 217] There can be no waiver unless the\nperson who is said to have waived is fully informed as\nto his right and with full knowledge of such right, he\nintentionally abandons it. It is pointed out\nin Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn.) Volume 16\nin para 1472 at p. 994 that for a “waiver to be\neffectual it is essential that the person granting it\nshould be fully informed as to his rights” and Isaacs,\nJ. delivering the judgment of the High Court of\nAustralia in Craine v. Colonial Mutual Fire\nInsurance Co. Ltd. [(1920) 28 CLR 305 (Aus)] has\nalso emphasised that waiver “must be with\nknowledge, an essential supported by many\nauthorities”. Now in the present case there is nothing\nto show that at the date when the appellant addressed\nthe letter dated June 25, 1970, it had full knowledge\nof its right to exemption under the assurance given by\nRespondent 4 and that it intentionally abandoned\nsuch right. It is difficult to speculate what was the\nreason why the appellant addressed the letter dated\nJune 25, 1970 stating that it would avail of the\nconcessional rates of Sales Tax granted under the\nletter dated January 20, 1970. It is possible that the\nappellant might have thought that since no\nnotification exempting the appellant from Sales Tax\nhad been issued by the State Government under\n\nPage 54 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nSection 4-A, the appellant was legally not entitled to\nexemption and that is why the appellant might have\nchosen to accept whatever concession was being\ngranted by the State Government. The claim of the\nappellant to exemption could be sustained only on the\ndoctrine of promissory estoppel and this doctrine\ncould not be said to be so well defined in its scope\nand ambit and so free from uncertainty in its\napplication that we should be compelled to hold that\nthe appellant must have had knowledge of its right to\nexemption on the basis of promissory estoppel at the\ntime when it addressed the letter dated June 25, 1970.\nIn fact, in the petition as originally filed, the right to\nclaim total exemption from Sales Tax was not based\non the plea of promissory estoppel which was\nintroduced only by way of amendment. Moreover, it\nmust be remembered that there is no presumption that\nevery person knows the law. It is often said that\neveryone is presumed to know the law, but that is not\na correct statement : there is no such maxim known to\nthe law. Over a hundred and thirty years ago, Maule,\nJ., pointed out in Martindale v. Falkner [(1846) 2 CB\n706 : 135 ER 1124] :\n\n“There is no presumption in this country that every\nperson knows the law : it would be contrary to\ncommon sense and reason if it were so.”\n\nScrutton, L.J., also once said:\n\n“It is impossible to know all the statutory law, and\nnot very possible to know all the common law.”\nBut it was Lord Atkin who, as in so many other\nspheres, put the point in its proper context when he\n\nPage 55 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nsaid in Evansv.Bartlam [(1937) AC 473, 479 : (1937)\n2 All ER 646] :\n\n“… the fact is that there is not and never has been a\npresumption that everyone knows the law. There is\nthe rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse, a\nmaxim of very different scope and application.”\nIt is, therefore, not possible to presume, in the\nabsence of any material placed before the Court,\nthat the. appellant had full knowledge of its right to\nexemption so as to warrant an inference that the\nappellant waived such right by addressing the letter\ndated June 25, 1970. We accordingly reject the plea\nof waiver raised on behalf of the State Government.\n\n75.\nIn\nKumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and Others Vs. State of U.P.\n\nand Others\n, (1991) 1 SCC 212, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held as under:-\n\n“27. Unlike a private party whose acts uninformed\nby reason and influenced by personal predilections\nin contractual matters may result in adverse\nconsequences to it alone without affecting the\npublic interest, any such act of the State or a public\nbody even in this field would adversely affect the\npublic interest. Every holder of a public office by\nvirtue of which he acts on behalf of the State or a\npublic body is ultimately accountable to the people\nin whom the sovereignty vests. As such, all powers\nso vested in him are meant to be exercised for\npublic good and promoting the public interest. This\nis equally true of all actions even in the field of\ncontract. Thus, every holder of a public office is a\ntrustee whose highest duty is to the people of the\n\nPage 56 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\ncountry and, therefore, every act of the holder of a\npublic office, irrespective of the label classifying\nthat act, is in discharge of public duty meant\nultimately for public good. With the diversification\nof State activity in a Welfare State requiring the\nState to discharge its wide ranging functions even\nthrough its several instrumentalities, which\nrequires entering into contracts also, it would be\nunreal and not pragmatic, apart from being\nunjustified to exclude contractual matters from the\nsphere of State actions required to be non-arbitrary\nand justified on the touchstone of\nArticle 14.\n”\n\n76. As noted above, the primary ground on which the petitioner has\n\nattacked the impugned Award is that the impugned Award is nullity in view\n\nof the proviso to\nSection 12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\nwhich has to be read in conjunction with\nVII Schedule to the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996\n.\n\n77. The amendment to\nSection 12\nin the form of insertion of\nSection\n\n12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was made by Act No.3\n\nof 2016 with effect from 23.10.2015. The aforesaid amendment inserted\n\nseveral new provisions to the Act including\nVII Schedule to the Act\napart\n\nfrom amendments to the other Schedules.\n\nPage 57 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n78.\nIn the context of\nSection 12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 read with\nVII Schedule to the Act\n, the Hon’ble Supreme Court\n\nhad pronounced its Judgment on 03.07.2017 in\nTRF Limited Vs. Energo\n\nEngineering Project Limited\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377. The said case dealt with\n\na case when the Agreement containing the Arbitration Clause was signed\n\nprior to the above amendment. An appeal against the order of the High\n\nCourt appointing an Arbitrator who was disqualified from acting as an\n\nArbitrator in view of the amendment to the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act,\nvide Act No.3 of 2016 with effect from 23.10.2015 was before the\n\nCourt was before the Court. There, the appellant invoked Clause 33 of the\n\nGeneral Terms and Conditions of the Purchase Order dated 28.12.2015\n\nseeking to refer the dispute to an Arbitrator as per which any dispute or\n\ndifference between the parties in connection with the agreement shall be\n\nreferred to the sole arbitration of the Managing Director or his nominee. A\n\nformer Judge of the High was appointed as an Arbitrator by the Managing\n\nDirector of the respondent therein in terms of aforesaid Clause. After the\n\nappointment was made, the appellant however filed an application under\n\nPage 58 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nSections 11(5)\nand\n11(6)\nof the Act for appointment of an independent\n\nArbitrator under\nSection 11(2)\nof the Act in view of the Amendment to the\n\nAct.\n\n79. The said case was laid on the basis of restrictions in\nSection 12(5)\n\nof the Act read with V & VII Schedules to the Act. The V Schedule\n\ncontemplates the situation which gives rise to justifiable doubts as to the\n\nindependence or impartially of arbitrators. It has to be read in conjunction\n\nwith\nSection 12(1)(a)\nof the Act, as per which, when a person is approached\n\nin connection with his possible appointment as an Arbitrator, such person\n\nshall disclose in writing any circumstances, such as the existence either\n\ndirect or indirect, of any past or present relationship with or interest in any\n\nof the parties or in relation to the subject-matter in dispute, whether\n\nfinancial, business, professional or other kind, which is likely to give rise to\n\njustifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality.\nSection 12(1)(a)\nof\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 reads as under:-\n\nPage 59 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n12.Grounds for challenge.- (1)When a person is\napproached in connection with his possible\nappointment as an arbitrator, he shall disclose in\nwriting any circumstances,—\n\n(a)such as the existence either direct or indirect,\nof any past or present relationship with or\ninterest in any of the parties or in relation to the\nsubject-matter in dispute, whether financial,\nbusiness, professional or other kind, which is\nlikely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his\nindependence or impartiality;\n\n(b)….\n\n…….\n\n80. In\nthe above case\n, the High Court proceeded to appoint a former\n\nJudge as a Sole Arbitrator to decide the dispute between the parties.\n\nComparing the provisions as it stood prior to amendment and after the\n\namendment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the\n\nManaging Director of the respondent therein who is ineligible to act as an\n\nArbitrator was also ineligible to appoint an Arbitrator. The decision of the\n\nHigh Court appointing a former Judge of the Hon’ble Supreme Court as sole\n\nArbitrator in terms of aforesaid Clause 33(d).\n\nPage 60 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n81. The appellant had thus preferred an application under\nSection\n\n11(5)\nread with\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act on the ground that was set aside\n\non the ground that once the identity of the Managing Director as the Sole\n\nArbitrator is lost, the power to nominate someone else as an Arbitrator is\n\nobliterated. Facts\nin\nthe above case\nis captured in para 5 of its decision\n\nwhich reads as under :-\n\n“5. After the appointment was made, the appellant\npreferred an application under\nSection 11(5)\nread\nwith\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act for appointment of an\narbitrator under\nSection 11(2)\nof the Act. The said\nfoundation was structured on the basis that under\n\nSection 12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n(Amendment) Act, 2015 (3 of 2016) read with the\nFifth and the Seventh Schedules to the amended\nAct, the Managing Director had become ineligible\nto act as the arbitrator and as a natural corollary, he\nhad no power to nominate. The stand put forth by\nthe appellant was controverted by the respondent\nbefore the High Court on the ground that the Fifth\nand the Seventh Schedules lay down the guidelines\nand the arbitrator is not covered under the same and\neven if it is so, his power to nominate someone to\nact as an arbitrator is not fettered or abrogated. The\nHigh Court analysed the clauses in the agreement\nand opined that the right of one party to a dispute to\nappoint a sole arbitrator prior to the amended Act\nhad been well recognised and the amended Act does\nnot take away such a right. According to the learned\n\nPage 61 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nDesignated Judge, had the intent of the amended\nAct been to take away a party's right to nominate a\nsole arbitrator, the same would have been found in\nthe detailed list of ineligibility criteria enumerated\nunder the\nSeventh Schedule to the Act\nand,\ntherefore, the submission advanced by the\nappellant, the petitioner before the High Court, was\nwithout any substance. Additionally, the High Court\nnoted that the learned counsel for the petitioner\nbefore it had clearly stated that it had faith in the\narbitrator but he was raising the issue as a legal one,\nfor a Managing Director once disqualified, he\ncannot nominate. That apart, it took note of the fact\nthat the learned arbitrator by letter dated 28-1-2016\nhas furnished the requisite disclosures under the\nSixth Schedule and, therefore, there were no\ncircumstances which were likely to give rise to\njustifiable doubts as to the independence and\nimpartiality. Finally, the Designated Judge directed\nthat besides the stipulation in the purchase order\ngoverning the parties, the court was inclined to\nappoint the former Judge as the sole arbitrator to\ndecide the disputes between the parties”.\n\nAs regards the issue about fresh appointment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court\n\nremanded the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration. Para 55 of\n\nthe Judgment. Paragraphs 54 & 55 of the decision in the case of TRF\n\nLimited referred to supra reads as under:-\n\nPage 62 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n“54. In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy\nwould be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the\nManaging Director, nominate an arbitrator, who\nmay be otherwise eligible and a respectable\nperson. As stated earlier, we are neither concerned\nwith the objectivity nor the individual\nrespectability. We are only concerned with the\nauthority or the power of the Managing Director.\nBy our analysis, we are obligated to arrive at the\nconclusion that once the arbitrator has become\nineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate\nanother as an arbitrator. The arbitrator becomes\nineligible as per prescription contained in\nSection\n12(5)\nof the Act. It is inconceivable in law that\nperson who is statutorily ineligible can nominate a\nperson. Needless to say, once the infrastructure\ncollapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse.\nOne cannot have a building without the plinth. Or\nto put it differently, once the identity of the\nManaging Director as the sole arbitrator is lost,\nthe power to nominate someone else as an\narbitrator is obliterated. Therefore, the view\nexpressed by the High Court is not sustainable and\nwe say so.\n\n55. Another facet needs to be addressed. The\nDesignated Judge in a cryptic manner has ruled\nafter noting that the petitioner therein had no\nreservation for nomination of the nominated\narbitrator and further taking note of the fact that\nthere has been a disclosure, that he has exercised\nthe power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. We are\nimpelled to think that that is not the right\nprocedure to be adopted and, therefore, we are\nunable to agree with the High Court on that score\nalso and, accordingly, we set aside the order\nappointing the arbitrator. However, as Clause (c)\n\nPage 63 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nis independent of Clause (d), the arbitration clause\nsurvives and hence, the Court can appoint an\narbitrator taking into consideration all the aspects.\n\nTherefore, we remand the matter to the High Court\nfor fresh consideration of the prayer relating to\nappointment of an arbitrator”.\n\n82. The above decision was rendered on 03.07.2017 by a Larger\n\nBench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court,\n\nthereafter, passed its Judgment in\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC and\n\nanother Vs. HSCC (India) Limited\n, (2020) 20 SCC 760 on 26.11.2019.\n\nIn\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC and another Vs. HSCC (India)\n\nLimited\n, (2020) 20 SCC 760, referred to its earlier decision in\nBharat\n\nBroadband Network Limited Vs. United Telecoms Limited\n, (2019) 5\n\nSCC 755 including decision in the case of TRF Limited referred to supra\n\nand in\nVoestalpine Schienen Gmph Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation\n\nLimited\n, (2017) 4 SCC 665.\n\n83. The view of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of TRF\n\nLimited referred to supra was re-iterated in paragraph 21 of Perkins\n\nPage 64 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nEastman Architects DPC and another Vs. HSCC (India) Limited\n, (2020)\n\n20 SCC 760. It reads as under:-\n\n“21. But, in our view that has to be the logical deduction\nfrom\nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects\nLtd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72]\nPara 50 of the decision shows that this Court was\nconcerned with the issue, “whether the Managing\nDirector, after becoming ineligible by operation of\nlaw, is he still eligible to nominate an arbitrator”\nThe ineligibility referred to therein, was as a result\nof operation of law, in that a person having an\ninterest in the dispute or in the outcome or decision\nthereof, must not only be ineligible to act as an\narbitrator but must also not be eligible to appoint\nanyone else as an arbitrator and that such person\ncannot and should not have any role in charting out\nany course to the dispute resolution by having the\npower to appoint an arbitrator. The next sentences\nin the paragraph, further show that cases where\nboth the parties could nominate respective\narbitrators of their choice were found to be\ncompletely a different situation. The reason is clear\nthat whatever advantage a party may derive by\nnominating an arbitrator of its choice would get\ncounter-balanced by equal power with the other\nparty. But, in a case where only one party has a\nright to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will\nalways have an element of exclusivity in\ndetermining or charting the course for dispute\nresolution. Naturally, the person who has an\ninterest in the outcome or decision of the dispute\nmust not have the power to appoint a sole\n\nPage 65 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\narbitrator.\n\nThat has to be taken as the essence of\nthe amendments brought in by the\nArbitration and\nConciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n(3 of 2016)\nand recognised by the decision of this Court\nin\nTRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects\nLtd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72]”.\n\n84. Referring to paragraph 32 of the decision in the case of TRF\n\nLimited referred to supra and the decision in the case of Voestalpine\n\nSchienen Gmph referred to supra, a similar issue as was discussed in\n\nparagraph 25, 26 & 27 in Perkins Eastman referred to supra. They read as\n\nunder:-\n\n“25. In the light of the aforestated principles, the report of\nthe Law Commission and the decision in Voestalpine\nSchienen GmbH [Voestalpine Schienen\nGmbH v. DMRC, (2017) 4 SCC 665 : (2017) 2 SCC\n(Civ) 607] , the imperatives of creating healthy\narbitration environment demand that the instant\napplication deserves acceptance.\n\n26. The further question that arises is whether the power\ncan be exercised by this Court under\nSection 11\nof the\nAct when the appointment of an arbitrator has already\nbeen made by the respondent and whether the appellant\nshould be left to raise challenge at an appropriate stage\nin terms of remedies available in law. Similar\ncontroversy was gone into by a Designated Judge of\nthis Court in Walter Bau AG [Walter Bau AG v.\n\nPage 66 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nMunicipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai, (2015) 3 SCC\n800 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 450] and the discussion on\nthe point was as under : (SCC pp. 805-06, paras 9-10)\n\n“9. While it is correct that in\nAntrix [Antrix\nCorpn. Ltd. v. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd.\n,\n(2014) 11 SCC 560 : (\n2014) 4 SCC (Civ)\n147] and Pricol Ltd. [Pricol Ltd. v. Johnson\nControls Enterprise Ltd.\n, (2015) 4 SCC 177 :\n\n(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 530] , it was opined by\nthis Court that after appointment of an\narbitrator is made, the remedy of the\naggrieved party is not under\nSection 11(6)\n\nbut such remedy lies elsewhere and under\ndifferent provisions of the\nArbitration Act\n\n(\nSections 12\nand\n), the context in which the\naforesaid view was expressed cannot be lost\nsight of. In Antrix [Antrix Corpn. Ltd. v.\n\nDevas Multimedia (P) Ltd., (2014) 11 SCC\n560 : (2014) 4 SCC (Civ) 147] , appointment\nof the arbitrator, as per the ICC Rules, was as\nper the alternative procedure agreed upon,\nwhereas in Pricol Ltd. [Pricol Ltd. v.\n\nJohnson Controls Enterprise Ltd., (2015) 4\nSCC 177 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 530] , the\nparty which had filed the application under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act had\nalready submitted to the jurisdiction of the\narbitrator. In the present case, the situation is\notherwise.\n\n10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex\nfacie valid and such appointment satisfies the\nCourt exercising jurisdiction under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act, acceptance of\nsuch appointment as a fait accompli to debar\n\nPage 67 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nthe jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be\ncountenanced in law. In the present case, the\nagreed upon procedure between the parties\ncontemplated the appointment of the\narbitrator by the second party within 30 days\nof receipt of a notice from the first party.\n\nWhile the decision in Datar Switchgears Ltd.\n\n[\nDatar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance\nLtd.\n, (2000) 8 SCC 151] may have introduced\nsome flexibility in the time-frame agreed\nupon by the parties by extending it till a point\nof time anterior to the filing of the\napplication under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act, it cannot be lost sight of that\nin the present case the appointment of Shri\nJustice A.D. Mane is clearly contrary to the\nprovisions of the Rules governing the\nappointment of arbitrators by ICADR, which\nthe parties had agreed to abide by in the\nmatter of such appointment. The option given\nto the respondent Corporation to go beyond\nthe panel submitted by ICADR and to appoint\nany person of its choice was clearly not in the\ncontemplation of the parties. If that be so,\nobviously, the appointment of Shri Justice\nA.D. Mane is non est in law. Such an\nappointment, therefore, will not inhibit the\nexercise of jurisdiction by this Court under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act. It cannot,\ntherefore, be held that the present proceeding\nis not maintainable in law. The appointment\nof Shri Justice A.D. Mane made beyond 30\ndays of the receipt of notice by the petitioner,\nthough may appear to be in conformity with\nthe law\nlaid down in\nDatar Switchgears Ltd.\n\n[\nDatar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance\n\nPage 68 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nLtd., (2000) 8 SCC 151] , is clearly contrary\nto the agreed procedure which required the\nappointment made by the respondent\nCorporation to be from the panel submitted\nby ICADR. The said appointment, therefore, is\nclearly invalid in law.”\n\n27.It may be noted here that the aforesaid view of the\nDesignated Judge in\nWalter Bau AG [Walter Bau AG\nv. Municipal Corpn. of Greater Mumbai\n, (2015) 3\nSCC 800 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 450] was pressed into\nservice on behalf of the appellant in\nTRF Ltd. [TRF\nLtd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377\n: (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] and the opinion expressed\nby the Designated Judge was found to be in\nconsonance with the binding authorities of this Court.\n\nIt was observed : (\nTRF\ncase [\nTRF Ltd. v.

In the light of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of TRF Limited referred to supra, the appointment made in the case of\n\nPerkins Eastman referred to supra was set aside and the Hon’ble Supreme\n\nCourt has appointed Dr.Justice A.K.Sikri, a former Judge of the Hon’ble\n\nSupreme Court as an Arbitrator to decide the dispute arising out the\n\nAgreement dated 22.05.2017.\n\nPage 70 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n86. In Bharat Broadband Network Limited which was discussed\n\nabove, the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of TRF\n\nLimited referred to supra was adverted to. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of Bharat Broadband Network Limited referred to supra has\n\nheld that the appointment of one Mr.Khan was ab initio and neither\n\nestoppels nor waiver operated against the appellant from challenging same\n\nin absence of an agreement in writing under the proviso to\nSection 12(5)\nof\n\nthe Act.\n\n87. The Hon’ble Supreme Court compared the facts of the case in\n\nTRF Limited referred to supra and the fact of the case in Bharat\n\nBroadband Network Limited referred to supra, and observed as under:-\n\n“18.… It will be noticed that the facts in the present case\nare somewhat similar. The APO itself is of the year\n2014, whereas the appointment by the Managing\nDirector is after the Amendment Act, 2015, just as\nin TRF Ltd. [TRF Ltd.v. Energo Engg. Projects\nLtd., (2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72]\nConsidering that the appointment in\nTRF\nLtd.[TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n,\n(2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] of a\nretired Judge of this Court was set aside as being\n\nPage 71 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nnon est in law, the appointment of Shri Khan in the\npresent case must follow suit.”\n\n88. In Bharat Broadband Network Limited referred to supra, the\n\ndispute arose between the parties and therefore, the respondent invoked the\n\nArbitration Clause in the General (Commercial) Conditions of Contract\n\n[GCC] and called upon the Managing Director of the appellant to appoint an\n\nindependent impartial Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute arising out of the\n\nAdvance Purchase Order dated 30.09.2014 read with Clause III. 20.1\n\ncontained in the General (Commercial) Conditions of Contract [GCC].\n\n89. In Bharat Broadband Network Limited referred to supra, after\n\nthe appointment was made on 17.01.2017, the appellant chanced to notice\n\nthe decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of TRF Limited\n\nreferred to supra , rendered on 03.07.2017 and thus, requested the Arbitrator\n\nto not to proceed as he was de jure incapable of performing his function as\n\nan Arbitrator and to withdraw, from the proceedings and therefore to allow\n\nthe appellant to approach the High court for appointment of a new\n\nArbitrator in his place.\n\nPage 72 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n90. One Mr.Khan, the learned Arbitrator however by his cryptic order\n\ndated 21.10.2017 rejected the request of the appellant which led to filing of\n\nthe application under\nSection 14\n&\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 stating that the learned Arbitrator had become de jure incapable\n\nof acting as an Arbitrator and therefore, new Arbitrator be appointed in his\n\nplace.\n\n91. The High Court by its Judgment dated 22.11.2017 reported in\n\n2017 SCC OnLine Del 11905 rejected the application stating that very\n\nperson who appointed the learned Arbitrator was estopped from raising the\n\nplea that such an Arbitrator cannot be appointed after participating in the\n\nproceedings. It was further stated that the respondent had also filed a claim\n\nstatement before the learned Arbitrator without any reservation and\n\ntherefore, it would amount to a waiver of the applicability of\nSection 12(5)\n\nof the Act.\n\nPage 73 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n92. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in paragraph 15 of the decision in the\n\ncase of Bharat Broadband Network Limited referred to supra, after\n\nconsidering the decision of its earlier decision rendered in the case of TRF\n\nLimited referred to supra held that the proviso to\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act\n\ncontemplates “express agreement in writing” and observed that “The only\n\nway in which this ineligibility can be removed, again, in law, is that parties\n\nmay after disputes have arisen between them, waive the applicability of this\n\nsub-section by an “express agreement in writing”. It further observed that\n\n“Obviously, the “express agreement in writing” has reference to a person\n\nwho is interdicted by the Seventh Schedule, but who is stated by parties\n\n(after the disputes have arisen between them) to be a person in whom they\n\nhave faith notwithstanding the fact that such person is interdicted by the\n\nSeventh Schedule.”\n\n93. The decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Bharat\n\nBroadband Network Limited referred to supra has to be construed\n\ncarefully in the context of sequence of events as the appointment was made\n\non 17.01.2017 (after the amendment to\nSection 12\nof the Act with effect\n\nPage 74 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nfrom 23.10.2015 by Act No.3 of 2016) and prior to the decision of the\n\nHon’ble Supreme Court in the case of TRF Limited referred to supra which\n\nwas rendered on 03.07.2017.\n\n94. Whereas, in the facts of the present case, the request for\n\nappointment was made by the petitioner after the dispute arose between the\n\nparties and in response, the respondent has consented the names of\n\nArbitrators to appoint the learned Arbitrator from the names given by the\n\nrespondent on 01.06.2022. By a reply mail, the petitioner consented for\n\nappointment of Mr.Rajesh Bhandari, Ex.Executive Director (F&A), AAI as\n\nthe Arbitrator. Thus, there is “express agreement in writing” by the\n\npetitioner waiving the appointment of said Mr.Rajesh Bhandari as the\n\nArbitrator. That apart under the agreement dated 27.06.2016 which is after\n\nthe amendment to Act with effect from 23.10.2015, the parties agreed as\n\nfollows:-\n\n“The award of the Arbitrator so appointed as\naforesaid is or has been an employee of the\nAuthority and the appointment of the Arbitrator\nwill not be challenged or be open to question in\nany Court of Law, on this account.”\n\nPage 75 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n95. That apart, the Arbitration Clause 30 of License Agreement dated\n\n27.07.2016 in the present makes it clear that in case the dispute is not\n\nresolved within 45 days of reference, then the case shall be referred to the\n\nsole Arbitration of a person to be appointed by the Chairman/Member of the\n\nAuthority subject to the condition that the petitioner will have to deposit the\n\ndisputed amount with the respondent as condition precedent before making\n\nreference to the Arbitration for adjudication of the dispute. Arbitration\n\nClause 30 of License Agreement dated 27.07.2016 further states that the\n\naward of the arbitrator so appointed as aforesaid is or has been an employee\n\nof the Authority and the appointment of the Arbitrator will not be\n\nchallenged or be open to question in any Court of Law, on this account. The\n\nabove Licence Agreement is dated 27.07.2016. Clause 30 of the License\n\nAgreement dated 27.07.2016 reads as under:-\n\n\"30. All disputes and differences arising out of or in any\nway touching or concerning this Agreement (except\nthose the decision whereof is otherwise herein\nbefore expressly provided for or to which the Public\nPremises [Eviction of unauthorized Occupants] Act\nand the rules framed thereunder which are now\n\nPage 76 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nenforced or which may hereafter come into force\nare applicable), shall, in the first instance, be\nreferred to a Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC)\nsetup at the airports, for which a written\napplication should be obtained from the party and\nthe points clearly spelt out. Before making a\nreference to dispute resolution to dispute resolution\ncommittee, the licensee will have to first deposit the\ndisputed amount with AAI and the consent shall\nhave to be obtained from the licensee for\nacceptance of the recommendations of the dispute\nresolution committee in case the dispute is not\nresolved within 45 days of reference, then the case\nshall be referred to the sole arbitration of a person\nto be appointed by the Chairman/Member of the\nAuthority subject to the condition that the licensee\nwill have to deposit the disputed amount with AAI\nas condition precedent before making reference to\nthe arbitration for adjudication of dispute. The\naward of the arbitrator so appointed as aforesaid is\nor has been an employee of the Authority and the\nappointment of the Arbitrator will not be\nchallenged or be open to question in any Court of\nLaw, on this account.\n\nBefore making a reference to Dispute resolution\ncommittee, the licensee will have to first disputed\namount with AAI and the consent shall be given by\nthe licensee for acceptance of the recommendations\nof the Dispute Resolution Committee.\n\nThe case shall be referred to the sole arbitrator by\nthe Chairman / Member of the Authority subject to\nthe condition that the licensee shall have to deposit\nthe disputed amount with AAI as condition\nprecedent before making reference to the\nArbitration for adjudication of dispute.\n\nPage 77 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nDuring the arbitral and dispute resolution\nproceedings, the licensee(s) shall continue to pay\nthe full amount of license fee / dues regularly as per\nthe award / agreement and perform all covenants of\nthe agreements.\n\n96. It would have been different if such an appointment and consent\n\nwas made prior to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nTRF Limited referred to supra which decision was followed by the\n\nHon’ble Supreme Court in Perkins Eastman referred to supra.\nIn any\n\nevent, it was imperative on the part of the petitioner or the respondent to\n\nhave filed application for terminating the mandate under\nSections 13\n,\n&\nof the Act as was held in\nWalter Bau AG v. Municipal Corpn. of\n\nGreater Mumbai\n, (2015) 3 SCC 800.\n\n97. Therefore, having allowed the Arbitration Proceedings to proceed,\n\nit is not open for the petitioner to state that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction\n\nas his appointment was suggested on 06.06.2022. The appointment of the\n\nlearned Arbitrator was not hit by the restrictions in\nSection 12(5)\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Having allowed the proceedings\n\nPage 78 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nwithout any demur, it is not open for the petitioner to question the same.\n\nThe petitioner consented to the appointment of the learned Arbitrator by his\n\nresponse dated 08.06.2022 makes it clear that there is “express agreement in\n\nwriting”.\n\n98. Thus, in the fact of the case, it is clear that there was a clear\n\n“express agreement in writing” as is contemplated in proviso to\nSection\n\n12(5)\nof the Act in the License Agreement dated 27.07.2016 signed between\n\nthe petitioner and the respondent which is after the amendment to the Act\n\nwith effect from 23.10.2015 although prior to the decisions of the Hon’ble\n\nSupreme Court in the cases of TRF Limited referred to supra, Perkins\n\nEastman referred to supra and in the case of Bharat Broadband Network\n\nLimited referred to supra.\n\n99. That apart, the decision in the case Central Organisation for\n\nRailway Electrification Vs. ECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML (JV) A Joint\n\nVenture Company\n, (2020) 14 SCC 712 was rendered by the Larger Bench\n\nof the Hon’ble Supreme Court presided over by three Judges of the Hon’ble\n\nPage 79 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nSupreme Court on 17.12.2019 at about the same time when the decision was\n\nrendered in the case of Perkins Eastman referred to supra on 26.11.2019.\n\n100. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Central Organisation for\n\nRailway Electrification has also referred to the decision in the case of\n\nPerkins Eastman referred to supra in paragraph 35 and discussed the issue\n\nin the context of amendment brought to the General Conditions of Contract.\n\nThe Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed as under:-\n\n36. As discussed earlier, after the\nArbitration and\nConciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n, the Railway\nBoard vide Notification dated 16-11-2016 has\namended and notified Clause 64 of the General\nConditions of Contract. As per Clause 64(3)(a)(ii)\n[where applicability of\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act has\nbeen waived off], in a case not covered by Clause\n64(3)(a)(i), the Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of a\npanel of three gazetted railway officers not below\nthe rank of Junior Administrative Grade or two\nrailway gazetted officers not below the rank of\nJunior Administrative Grade and a retired railway\nofficer retired not below the rank of Senior\nAdministrative Grade Officer, as the arbitrators.\n\nFor this purpose, the General Manager, Railways\nwill send a panel of at least four names of gazetted\nrailway officers of one or more departments of the\nRailways within sixty days from the date when a\nwritten and valid demand for arbitration is\n\nPage 80 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nreceived by the General Manager. The contractor\nwill be asked to suggest to the General Manager at\nleast two names out of the panel for appointment\nas contractor's nominees within thirty days from\nthe date of dispatch of the request from the\nRailways. The General Manager shall appoint at\nleast one out of them as the contractor's nominee\nand will also simultaneously appoint balance\nnumber of arbitrators from the panel or from\noutside the panel duly indicating the “Presiding\nOfficer” from amongst the three arbitrators so\nappointed. The General Manager shall complete\nthe exercise of appointing the Arbitral Tribunal\nwithin thirty days from the date of the receipt of the\nnames of contractor's nominees.\n\n37. Clause 64(3)(b) of GCC deals with appointment of\narbitrator where applicability of\nSection 12(5)\nof\nthe Act has not been waived off. In terms of Clause\n64(3)(b) of GCC, the Arbitral Tribunal shall\nconsist of a panel of three retired railway officers\nretired not below the rank of Senior Administrative\nGrade Officers as the arbitrators. For this\npurpose, the Railways will send a panel of at least\nfour names of retired railway officers empanelled\nto work as arbitrators indicating their retirement\ndate to the contractor within sixty days from the\ndate when a written and valid demand for\narbitration is received by the General Manager.\nThe contractor will be asked to suggest the\nGeneral Manger at least two names out of the\npanel for appointment of contractor's nominees\nwithin thirty days from the date of dispatch of the\nrequest of the Railways. The General Manager\nshall appoint at least one out of them as the\ncontractor's nominee and will simultaneously\n\nPage 81 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nappoint the remaining arbitrators from the panel\nor from outside the panel, duly indicating the\n“presiding officer” from amongst the three\narbitrators. The exercise of appointing the Arbitral\nTribunal shall be completed within thirty days from\nthe receipt of names of contractor's nominees.\nThus, the right of the General Manager in\nformation of the Arbitral Tribunal is\ncounterbalanced by the respondent's power to\nchoose any two from out of the four names and the\nGeneral Manager shall appoint at least one out of\nthem as the contractor's nominee.\n\n38. In the present matter, after the respondent had sent\nthe letter dated 27-7-2018 calling upon the\nappellant to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal, the\nappellant sent the communication dated 24-9-2018\nnominating the panel of serving officers of Junior\nAdministrative Grade to act as arbitrators and\nasked the respondent to select any two from the list\nand communicate to the office of the General\nManager. By the letter dated 26-9-2018, the\nrespondent conveyed their disagreement in waiving\nthe applicability of Section 12(5) of the\nAmendment Act, 2015. In response to the\nrespondent's letter dated 26-9-2018, the appellant\nhas sent a panel of four retired railway officers to\nact as arbitrators giving the details of those retired\nofficers and requesting the respondent to select any\ntwo from the list and communicate to the office of\nthe General Manager. Since the respondent has\nbeen given the power to select two names from out\nof the four names of the panel, the power of the\nappellant nominating its arbitrator gets\ncounterbalanced by the power of choice given to\nthe respondent. Thus, the power of the General\n\nPage 82 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nManager to nominate the arbitrator is\ncounterbalanced by the power of the respondent to\nselect any of the two nominees from out of the four\nnames suggested from the panel of the retired\nofficers. In view of the modified Clauses\n64(3)(a)(ii) and 64(3)(b) of GCC, it cannot\ntherefore be said that the General Manager has\nbecome ineligible to act as (sic nominate) the\narbitrator. We do not find any merit in the contrary\ncontention of the respondent. The decision in\nTRF\nLtd. [TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engg. Projects Ltd.\n,\n(2017) 8 SCC 377 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 72] is not\napplicable to the present case.\n\n39. There is an express provision in the modified\nclauses of General Conditions of Contract, as per\nClauses 64(3)(a)(ii) and 64(3)(b), the Arbitral\nTribunal shall consist of a panel of three gazetted\nrailway officers [Clause 64(3)(a)(ii)] and three\nretired railway officers retired not below the rank\nof Senior Administrative Grade Officers [Clause\n64(3)(b)]. When the agreement specifically\nprovides for appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal\nconsisting of three arbitrators from out of the\npanel of serving or retired railway officers, the\nappointment of the arbitrators should be in terms\nof the agreement as agreed by the parties. That\nbeing the conditions in the agreement between the\nparties and the General Conditions of the\nContract, the High Court was not justified in\nappointing an independent sole arbitrator ignoring\nClauses 64(3)(a)(ii) and 64(3)(b) of the General\nConditions of Contract and the impugned orders\ncannot be sustained.\n\nPage 83 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n40.\nIn the result, the impugned orders dated 3-1-2019\n[ECI –\nSPIC- SMO - MCML (JV) v. Central\nOrganisation\nfor Railway Electrification, 2019\nSCC OnLine All 2404] and 29-3-2019 [\nECI-SPIC-\nSMO-MCML (JV) v. Central Organisation\nfor\nRailway Electrification, 2019 SCC OnLine All\n5271] passed by the High Court of Judicature at\nAllahabad in Arbitration Application No. 151 of\n2018 are set aside and these appeals are allowed.\nThe appellant is directed to send a fresh panel of\nfour retired officers in terms of Clause 64(3)(b) of\nthe General Conditions of Contract within a\nperiod of thirty days from today under intimation\nto the respondent contractor. The respondent\ncontractor shall select two from the four suggested\nnames and communicate to the appellant within\nthirty days from the date of receipt of the names of\nthe nominees. Upon receipt of the communication\nfrom the respondent, the appellant shall constitute\nthe Arbitral Tribunal in terms of Clause 64(3)(b) of\nthe General Conditions of Contract within thirty\ndays from the date of the receipt of the\ncommunication from the respondent. The parties to\nbear their respective costs.\n\n101. The decision in the case of\nP.Cheran Vs. Gemini Industries &\n\nImaging Limited\n, rep. by its Official Liquidator, 2023 SSC OnLine Mad\n\n1887 pertains to the Award dated 29.04.2015. However, it has referred to\n\nthe decision rendered in the context of amendments to the provision of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nafter amendment with effect from\n\nPage 84 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n23.10.2015 in the light of the decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the\n\ncases of TRF Limited referred to supra, Perkins Eastman referred to\n\nsupra and in the case of Bharat Broadband Network Limited referred to\n\nsupra.\n\n102. This view has been followed by this Court in another case in\n\nPrime Store, rep. by its Partner and others Vs. Sugam Vanijya Holdings\n\nPrivate Limited and others, 2023 SCC OnLine Mad 2898, wherein, the\n\nAward passed on 22.03.2021 was challenged although defect to the\n\njurisdiction can be challenged at any point of time as held by the Hon’ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nKiran Singh Vs. Chaman Paswan\n, AIR 1954\n\nSC 340 as under:-\n\n“6. The answer to these contentions must depend on\nwhat the position in law is when a court entertains\na suit or an appeal over which it has no\njurisdiction, and what the effect of\nSection 11\nof\nthe Suits Valuation Act is on that position. It is a\n\nPage 85 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nfundamental principle well established that a\ndecree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a\nnullity, and that its invalidity could be set up\nwhenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced\nor relied upon, even at the stage of execution and\neven in collateral proceedings. A defect of\njurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial,\nor whether it is in respect of the subject-matter of\nthe action, strikes at the very authority of the\ncourt to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot\nbe cured even by consent of parties. If the\nquestion now under consideration fell to be\ndetermined only on the application of general\nprinciples governing the matter, there can be no\ndoubt that the District Court of Monghyr\nwas coram non judice, and that its judgment and\ndecree would be nullities. The question is what is\nthe effect of\nSection 11\nof the Suits Valuation Act\non this position.”\n\n103. In the facts of the present case, there is a clear indication that\n\nthere was an ‘express waiver’ by the petitioner. Therefore, the challenge to\n\nthe impugned Award is not made out. There is no defect in jurisdiction\n\nassumed by the Arbitrator as the petitioner consented for appointment of the\n\nlearned Arbitrator after the amendments to the provision of the\nArbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, 1996\nafter amendment with effect from 23.10.2015,\n\non 08.06.2022.\n\nPage 86 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n104. In the light of the above discussion, the challenge to the\n\nimpugned Award on the ground that the Arbitrator was de jure incapable of\n\nresolving dispute between the parties cannot be countenanced. In view of\n\nthe above, the challenge to the impugned Award is therefore unsustainable.\n\n105. As far as the challenge to the decision on merits is concerned,\n\nthere is hardly any case made out by the petitioner as the scope for\n\ninterference under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\nis very limited as per the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in\n\nSsangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited Vs.\n\nNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI\n), (2019) 15 SCC 131.\n\n106. Scope of interference under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 is very limited. This Court can neither sit as a court\n\nof appeal or re-appreciate the evidence placed before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nPage 87 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nor substitute the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal with its own conclusion on\n\nfacts or evidence.\nIn this connection the decision of the Honourable\n\nSupreme Court in\nThe Project Director, NHAI V. M. Hakim\n, (2021) 9\n\nSCC 1 is invited wherein it was held that the power to set aside an Arbitral\n\nAward under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration And Conciliation Act, 1996 does\n\nnot include the authority to modify the award. It further held that an award\n\ncan be 'set aside' only on limited grounds as specified in\nSection 34\nof the\n\nAct and it is not an appellate provision. It further held that an application\n\nunder\nSection 34\nfor setting aside an award does not entail any challenge on\n\nmerits to an award.\n\n107. The Honourable Supreme Court in\nSsangyong Engineering and\n\nConstruction Co Ltd versus National Highway Authority of India\n,\n\n(2019) 15 SCC 131 has held that an award can be set aside on the ground of\n\npatent illegality under\nsection 34\n(2-\nA) of the Arbitration And Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996\nonly where the illegality in the award goes to the root of the\n\nmatter. It further held that erroneous application of law by an Arbitral\n\nTribunal or the re-appreciation of evidence by the court under\nsection 34\n\nPage 88 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n(2-\nA) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nis not available.\n\n108. The Court held that the above ground is available only where the\n\nview taken by the Arbitral Tribunal is an impossible view while construing\n\nthe contract between the parties or where the award of the tribunal lacks any\n\nreasons. The\nCourt further held\nthat an award can be set aside only if an\n\narbitrator/arbitral tribunal decide(s) the question beyond the contract or\n\nbeyond the terms of reference or if the finding arrived by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal is based on no evidence or ignoring vital evidence or is based on\n\ndocuments taken as evidence without notice to the parties.\n\n109. The Honourable Supreme Court in\nPatel Engineering Ltd V.\n\nNEEPCO\n, (2020) 7 SCC 167 held that patent illegality as a ground for\n\nsetting aside an award is available only if the decision of the arbitrator is\n\nfound to be perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have\n\narrived at the same or the construction of the contract is such that no fair or\n\nreasonable person would take or that the view of the arbitrator is not even a\n\npossible view.\n\nPage 89 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\n110. The Honourable Supreme Court in\nMcDermott International\n\nInc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd\n, (2006) 11 SCC 181 held that while\n\ninterpreting the terms of a contract, the conduct of parties and\n\ncorrespondences exchanged would also be relevant factors and it is well\n\nwithin the arbitrator's jurisdiction to consider the same.\n\n111. The Honourable Supreme Court in\nSutlej Construction Ltd. v.\n\nUT of Chandigarh\n(2018) 1 SCC 718, held that when the award is a\n\nreasoned one and the view taken is plausible, re-appreciation of evidence is\n\nnot allowed while dealing with the challenge to an award under\nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration And Conciliation Act, 1996 for setting aside an award. It\n\nfurther held that the proceedings challenging the award cannot be treated as\n\na first appellate court against a decree passed by a trial court.\n\n112. The Honourable Supreme Court in\nSheladia Associates Inc. V.\n\nTN Road Sector Project II, Represented\nby its Project Director, 2019\n\nPage 90 of 93\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\nArb.O.P.No.312 of 2023\n\nSCC OnLine Mad 17883 reminded itself of the Hodgkinson principle which\n\nhas been explained by the Honourable Supreme Court in the oft-quoted and\n\ncelebrated Associate Builders Case being\nAssociate Builders V. Delhi\n\nDevelopment Authority\n, (2015) 3 SCC 49. It held that Hodgkinson\n\nprinciple in simple terms means that the Arbitral Tribunal is the best judge\n\nwith regard to quality and quantity of evidence before it. It further held that\n\nif there is no infraction of\nSection 28(3)\nof the Arbitration And Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 the question of challenge on the grounds of public policy does not\n\narise.\n\n113. Therefore, this Arbitration Original Petition is liable to be\n\ndismissed and is accordingly dismissed. Consequently, connected\n\napplication is closed.
