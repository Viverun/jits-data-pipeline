It is stated that the marriage between the deceased and the\napplicant was solemnized on 27.11.2022. It is alleged that three\ndays before the wedding, the applicant, along with his uncles\nnamely, Javed, Irsad, and his mother, demanded a car. It is\nalleged that before the marriage a compromise was entered into\npursuant to which apart from dowry articles given in the wedding\nceremony, additionally, a sum of Rs 10 lakhs was handed over in\ncash at the time of Vidayi. It is alleged that from the next day\nonwards the applicant and his family members started demanding\na Creta Car and also told the deceased to not comeback without\nthe said Car.\n\n5. It is also alleged that the applicant was not coming to take\nthe deceased from her paternal home and on 07.05.2023 the\napplicant was due to pick up the deceased at around 10:30 AM,\nbut he didn't arrive and this lead to deceased becoming upset and\nhanged herself.\n\n6. The complainant alleged that the deceased took her life\ndue to the relentless demands for dowry and the harassment\ninflicted upon her by the applicant and his family members. The\napplicant is in judicial custody since 26.05.2023.\n\n7. The learned Counsel for the applicant submits that after the\nmarriage the deceased only spent 5 to 6 days at her matrimonial\nhome and thereafter went to her parental house.\n\n8. He submits that the family of the applicant had tried on\nvarious occasions to get the deceased back to her matrimonial\nhome. He submits that it was the complainant who told the\napplicant that he will send the deceased back in two months,\nhowever, later on 05.05.2023 with the intervention of the\nmediator to the marriage, the mother and complainant agreed to\nsend the deceased on 07.05.2023.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4282/2023 Page 2 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 28/03/2024 at 20:57:52\n\n9. He submits that there was no previous complaint either by\nthe deceased or by her family members in respect of any dowry\ndemand.\n\n10. He submits that on 07.05.2023, even before the applicant\ncould reach the house of his in-laws, at around 11:30 a.m., the\ndeceased committed suicide by hanging at her paternal house on\nthe same day. The MLC bearing no. 3050/ 2023 of the deceased\nwas prepared, in which it has been recorded that \"hesitation cuts\nmarks on left forearm\". He submits that the investigating officer\nwas also advised by the doctor concerned to seek further\nevaluation of the said marks, however the same was not done.\n\n11. He submits that the investigation in present case is\ncomplete and the chargesheet has already been filed.\n\n12. He submits that the from a bare perusal of the FIR,\nChargesheet, statements of the witnesses and the documents\nrelied upon by the prosecution, no offence under\nSection 304B\n/\n\n498A\n/\n/\nIPC is made out against the Applicant. He submits\nthat only the applicant has been kept in Column 11 of the\nChargesheet and his family members in Column 12 for want of\nspecific allegations against them.\n\n13. He submits that the deceased was engaged in the pre-\nmarital relationship and no investigation qua the same was\ncarried by the investigating officer.\n\n14. He further submits that from the perusal of the what's app\nchats between the applicant and complainant, which are a part of\nthe chargesheet, no demand of any car could be ascertained.\n\n15. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has\nopposed the grant of present bail application. He submits that\ncomplainant has alleged that the just three days prior to the\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4282/2023 Page 3 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 28/03/2024 at 20:57:53\nmarriage the applicant and his family members had demanded a\nCar in marriage from the family of the deceased.\n\n16. He submits that the complainant had provided a audio\nrecording with regards to the alleged demand of the car, between\nthe Asif Ali (brother of the deceased) and Rafeeq / Mediator to\nthe marriage.\n\n17. I have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n18. It is admitted that the present applicant is the sole accused\nin column 11 of the chargesheet and rest all the accused are put in\ncolumn 12 of the chargesheet.\n\n19. It is also not in dispute that the deceased had stayed with\nthe applicant only for a brief period of 5-6 days and the alleged\nincident took place in her paternal home. The applicant was\narrested after he had surrendered before the investigating officer\nafter the dismissal of his anticipatory bail application.\n\n20. It is also stated in the status report that the allegation with\nrespect to the Rs.10 lakhs being given at the time of vidayi is\ncontroverted since Javed one of the uncles of the applicant had\nprovided a video which shows that the family of the deceased\ngave a sum of rupees two lakhs and eleven thousand only in cash\nat that time.\n\n21.\nSection 304\nof the IPC reads as under:\n\n\"304B. Dowry death. -- (1) Where the death of a woman is\ncaused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise\nthan under normal circumstances within seven years of her\nmarriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any\nrelative of her husband for, or in connection with, any\ndemand for dowry, such death shall be called \"dowry death\",\nand such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused\nher death.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4282/2023 Page 4 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 28/03/2024 at 20:57:53\nExplanation: For the purposes of this sub-section, \"dowry\"\n\nshall have the same meaning as in\nsection 2\nof the Dowry\nProhibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).\n\n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven\nyears but which may extend to imprisonment for life.\"\n\n22. The basic ingredient to attract presumption in terms of\n\nSection 304B\nof the IPC is that the death should have occurred\nunder circumstances which are not normal within seven years of\nher marriage and the victim was subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or any of her husband's relative in\nconnection with any demand for dowry soon before the death.\n\n23. It is not a case of the prosecution that the applicant or his\nfamily members have been alternatively charged for offences\nunder Section 302 or 306 of the\nIPC\n. In fact, the other co-accused\npersons are stated to have been kept in column 12 of the\nchargesheet. It is also not denied that deceased was not staying\nwith the applicant at the relevant time. The death occurred at her\nparental home.\n\n24. The presumption in law of a 'dowry death' is meant to act\nas a deterrent to the demand of dowry and to ensure that there is\nno victimization because of that. The allegations levelled will be\ntested in trial and at this stage considering the Application for\nBail only the parameters enshrined in that regard are to be\nconsidered.\n\n25. The applicant is in custody since 26.05.2023, the\nchargesheet has already been filed. The trial is at the stage of\nProsecution evidence and is likely to take considerable period of\ntime.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4282/2023 Page 5 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 28/03/2024 at 20:57:53\n\n26. The object of judicial custody is to secure the presence of\nthe accused persons during the trial. The object is neither\npunitive nor preventive and the deprivation of liberty has been\nconsidered as a punishment. Delay in the commencement and\nconclusion of the trial is a factor to be taken into account and the\naccused cannot be kept in custody for an indefinite period if the\ntrial is not likely to be concluded within a reasonable time. The\npresence of the accused can be secured at the time of trial by\nputting appropriate conditions.\n\n27. Without commenting further on the merits of the case,\nkeeping the facts and circumstances in mind and the fact that the\ntrial is likely to take some time, I am satisfied that the applicant\nhas made out a case for the grant of regular bail.\n\n28. In view of the above, the applicant is directed to be\nreleased on bail on furnishing a bail bond for a sum of ₹25,000/-\nwith one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of learned\nTrial Court / Duty MM / Link MM on the following conditions:\n\na. The applicant shall not leave the country without\nprior permission of the learned Trial Court;\nb. The applicant shall cooperate in the trial and appear\nbefore the learned Trial Court as and when directed;\nc. The applicant shall not directly or indirectly make\nany inducement, threat or promise to any person\nacquainted with the facts of the present case;\nd. The applicant shall not, in any manner, try to contact\nany of the witnesses;\n\ne. The applicant shall provide his mobile number to the\nconcerned Investigating Officer /SHO at the time of\nhis release and the mobile shall be kept in working\ncondition at all times;\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4282/2023 Page 6 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 28/03/2024 at 20:57:53\nf. The applicant shall, in case of change of residential\naddress and/or mobile number, intimate the\nconcerned Investigating Officer regarding the same.\n\n29. In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/ complaint\nlodged against the applicant, it would be open to the State to seek\nredressal by filing an appropriate application for cancellation of\nbail.\n\n30. It is also made clear that the observations made in the\npresent case are only for the purpose of considering the bail\napplication and should not influence the outcome of the trial and\nalso not be taken as an expression of opinion on the merits of the\ncase.\n\n31. The present application is allowed in the aforesaid terms.\n\nAMIT MAHAJAN, J\nMARCH 21, 2024\n\"SK\"\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4282/2023 Page 7 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 28/03/2024 at 20:57:53",
