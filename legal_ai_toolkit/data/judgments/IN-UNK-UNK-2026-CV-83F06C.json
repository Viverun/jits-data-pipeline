And Others on 19 November, 2024\n\nAuthor: \nJyotsna Rewal Dua\n\nBench: \nJyotsna Rewal Dua\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\n IN THE HIGH COURT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH, SHIMLA\n CWP No.2662 of 2023\n Decided on: 19th November, 2024\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDr. Ashok Verma .....Petitioner\n\n Versus\n\nState of H.P. and others .....Respondents\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoram\n\nMs. Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua\n\nWhether approved for reporting? 1 Yes.\n\nFor the Petitioner: Mr. Hamender Singh Chandel, Advocate.\n\nFor the Respondents: Ms. Leena Guleria, Deputy Advocate\n General, for respondents No.1 and 2.\n\n Mr. Vishwa Bhushan, Advocate, for\n respondent No.3.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJyotsna Rewal Dua, Judge\n\n The present is a seniority dispute between the\n\npetitioner and respondent No.3. Petitioner's grievance is to\n\nthe order dated 03.05.2023 (Annexure P-10) passed by the\n\nPrincipal Secretary (Health) to the Government of Himachal\n\nPradesh-respondent No.1 that unsettled the seniority\n\nposition being enjoyed by the petitioner over respondent\n\nNo.3 since the year 2009 and made him junior to the\n\naforesaid respondent.\n\n 1\n\n Whether reporters of print and electronic media may be allowed to see the order? Yes.\n\n 2\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\n2. Contours of the seniority dispute may now be\n\nnoticed:-\n\n2(i). Petitioner and respondent No.3 both are\n\npresently serving as Professor Obstetrics and Gynecology\n\n(OBG) in Dr. Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College\n\nand Hospital, Kangra at Tanda (in short 'Dr. RPGMC\n\nTanda').\n\n2(ii). Petitioner was appointed as Assistant Professor\n\n(OBG) on 30.07.2009 on direct recruitment basis and\n\nposted as such in Dr. RPGMC Tanda.\n\n Respondent No.3, serving as Medical Officer ever\n\nsince 19.01.1991, was promoted to the post of Assistant\n\nProfessor on 26.11.2009 and posted as such in Dr. RPGMC\n\nTanda.\n\n It is an admitted factual position that the\n\npetitioner and respondent No.3 remained posted in the\n\nsame specialty in the same department and the petitioner\n\nenjoyed higher status than respondent No.3 in view of his\n\nprior appointment as Assistant Professor.\n\n2(iii). Respondents No.1 and 2 issued tentative\n\nseniority list of Assistant Professors in Dr. RPGMC Tanda\n\nas on 01.01.2015 vide office memorandum dated\n\n09.03.2015. Name of the petitioner was reflected at\n\n 3\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nSr. No.1, whereas that of respondent No.3 was shown at\n\nSr. No.2 of the seniority list with their dates of\n\nappointment/promotion to the post reflected as 31.07.2009\n\nand 26.11.2009, respectively.\n\n2(iv). Respondents No.1 and 2 convened meeting of\n\nthe Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) for making\n\npromotion of eligible Assistant Professors (OBG) in Dr.\n\nRPGMC Tanda. On the basis of recommendations of the\n\nDPC, the petitioner, serving as Assistant Professor, was\n\npromoted as Associate Professor vide notification dated\n\n23.05.2015. At that time, respondent No.3 was serving as\n\nAssistant Professor in the same department and in the\n\nsame college.\n\n2(v). Petitioner was further promoted to the post of\n\nProfessor in the Department of OBG in Dr. RPGMC Tanda\n\nvide notification/office order dated 30.12.2019. That is how\n\nthe petitioner is presently serving as Professor (OBG) in Dr.\n\nRPGMC Tanda.\n\n While the petitioner was serving as Professor,\n\nrespondent No.3, who was then serving as Assistant\n\nProfessor, was promoted to the post of Associate Professor\n\nin the Department of OBG in Dr. RPGMC Tanda vide\n\nnotification/office order dated 06.01.2020.\n\n 4\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\n2(vi). One year after the promotion of respondent No.3\n\nas Associate Professor, he moved a representation on\n\n08.02.2021 (Annexure R3/1) to respondent No.1, raising a\n\nseniority issue vis-à-vis petitioner. Respondent No.3\n\nclaimed that in terms of Chapter 13 of the Handbook on\n\nPersonnel Matters, Volume-I, Second Edition, Government\n\nof Himachal Pradesh, seniority was required to be\n\ndetermined as per the roster of appointment as Assistant\n\nProfessor and not as per the date of joining/promotion/\n\nappointment in the same calendar year. Relevant para from\n\nthe representation reads as under:-\n\n \"10. The rule which makes me senior to Dr. Ashok Verma\n was not considered while promoting him as associate\n professor which says that seniority of the person should\n be determined as per roster of appointment as assistant\n professor and not as per date of joining, if\n promoted/appointed in the same calendar year (before\n 31st December of same year). This rule has been quoted\n from \"Handbook of Personnel Matters Vol.-I. Second\n Edition, Govt. of HP. Chapter 13. Seniority Subtitle-6.\n Relative seniority of direct recruits and promotes.\" I\n regret for the late representation as I was not aware of\n this before said rule.\"\n\n Respondent No.3 raised a grievance in his\n\nrepresentation that promotion to the post of Associate\n\nProfessor was wrongly given to the petitioner on\n\n23.05.2015. Respondent No.3 ought to have been\n\nconsidered for promotion to the post of Associate Professor,\n\nbeing senior to the petitioner in view of his having been\n\n 5\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\npromoted to the post of Assistant Professor. That by\n\napplying the instructions contained in Chapter 13 of the\n\nHandbook on Personnel Matters, the seniority of direct\n\nrecruits vis-à-vis promotees had to be determined in the\n\nratio of 50:50 in the manner as (1) Promotee, (2) Direct\n\nRecruit (3) Promotee, (4) Direct Recruit. Respondent No.3,\n\nbeing promotee, should have been reflected at Sr. No.1 of\n\nthe seniority list of Assistant Professors. These instructions\n\nhad not been followed by respondents No.1 and 2 while\n\ndetermining seniority of Assistant Professors, which caused\n\nprejudice to respondent No.3. Respondent No.3 sought to\n\nplace himself above the petitioner.\n\n Representation dated 08.02.2021 was followed\n\nby a supplement dated 15.02.2021 (Annexure R3/2). In the\n\nsupplement, respondent No.3 highlighted the issue raised\n\nby him in the above extracted paragraph 10 of his\n\nrepresentation and further submitted that the seniority list\n\nof Assistant Professors was never circulated to him.\n\n2(vii). While representation of respondent No.3 was\n\nbeing deliberated upon in the respondent-Health\n\nDepartment, he while serving at that time as Associate\n\nProfessor, was further promoted to the post of Professor on\n\n06.09.2022.\n\n 6\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\n Post of Professor is the feeder category post for\n\npromotion to the post of Principal/Head of Department\n\n(HoD) (administrative post). The post of Principal/HoD is\n\nfilled up 100% by promotion from the eligible Professors.\n\n2(viii). Respondent No.3 instituted Civil Writ Petition\n\nNo.96 of 2023. Petitioner was not impleaded as party to the\n\nwrit petition. During hearing of the said writ petition, relief\n\nwas confined concerning decision upon the pending\n\nrepresentations of respondent No.3 dated 08.02.2021 and\n\n15.02.2021. Submission was made for respondent No.3\n\n(petitioner therein) that he would be satisfied in case\n\nrespondent No.1 is directed to dispose of his\n\nrepresentations within some time bound manner. In view of\n\nthis submission, the writ petition was disposed of on\n\n20.03.2023, directing respondent No.1 to dispose of the\n\nrepresentations of respondent No.3 in accordance with law,\n\npreferably within six weeks. The merits of the matter were\n\nnot gone into by the Court.\n\n2(ix). Pursuant to the above direction, respondent\n\nNo.1 passed the impugned order on 03.05.2023 (Annexure\n\nP-10). The order directed placing respondent No.3 above the\n\npetitioner as Assistant Professor (OBG) and on that basis,\n\nhe was ordered to be placed above the petitioner in the final\n\n 7\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nseniority list of Assistant Professors as on 01.01.2015.\n\nSubsequent DPCs were also ordered to be reviewed. The\n\norder was passed on the basis of Clause/Subtitle 6 of\n\nChapter 13 of the Handbook on Personnel Matters, Vol-I,\n\nSecond Edition pertaining to provisions of determining\n\nrelative seniority between direct recruits and promotees.\n\n It is at this stage the petitioner instituted\n\npresent writ petition seeking following substantive relief:-\n\n \"i) That the impugned order dated 03.05.2023, Annexure\n P-10, may be held illegal and quashed and set aside.\"\n\n Vide interim order dated 10.05.2023, the\n\noperation of the impugned order dated 03.05.2023\n\n(Annexure P-10) was stayed.\n\n3. Submissions:-\n\n3(i). Submissions made by learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner are primarily focused upon the principle that\n\nsettled seniority cannot be unsettled after a long period of\n\ntime. That respondent No.3 had acquiesced in the seniority\n\nposition assigned to the petitioner ever since the year 2009.\n\nOn the basis of higher seniority position of the petitioner,\n\nhe had been promoted as Associate Professor and then\n\nProfessor prior in time to respondent No.3. Respondent\n\nNo.3 was very well aware of the higher seniority position\n\nand status enjoyed by the petitioner w.e.f. the year 2009.\n\n 8\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nTherefore, on the basis of executive instructions containing\n\nthe principles of determining seniority between direct\n\nrecruits and promotees, respondents No.1 and 2 cannot be\n\nallowed to unsettle the seniority position of the petitioner,\n\nwhich he enjoyed w.e.f. 2009 over respondent No.3. It was\n\nalso submitted that while passing the impugned order,\n\npetitioner had not even been heard, though his rights were\n\nbeing deliberated upon and then adversely affected by the\n\nimpugned order.\n\n3(ii). Argument of learned counsel for respondent\n\nNo.3 is that respondent No.3 was not aware at the relevant\n\ntime about the principles to be applied for determining the\n\nseniority between direct recruits and promotees. He\n\nacquired the knowledge of the applicable instructions in the\n\nyear 2021. Immediately thereafter, he represented for\n\nrectifying the errors that had crept in the seniority list of\n\nAssistant Professors and for reviewing the promotion of the\n\npetitioner to the post of Associate Professor and thereafter\n\nas Professor. The tentative seniority list of Assistant\n\nProfessors dated 09.03.2015, reflecting the petitioner at Sr.\n\nNo.1 and respondent No.3 at No.2, was never circulated.\n\nRespondent No.3 was not aware of the seniority positions.\n\nHence, there was no delay and laches in respondent No.3's\n\n 9\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nrepresenting to respondent No.1 against the incorrect\n\nseniority positions assigned to the petitioner and\n\nrespondent No.3.\n\n Learned counsel for respondent No.3 also\n\nsubmitted that respondent No.3 had prayed for his being\n\nplaced above the petitioner in view of the instructions\n\ncontained in Chapter 13 of the Handbook on Personnel\n\nMatters, Vol-I, in terms of which, while determining\n\nseniority between direct recruits and promotees\n\nappointed/promoted in the same calendar year, roster of (1)\n\nPromotion, (2) Direct (3) Promotion (4) Direct, was required\n\nto be followed. Had the respondents properly implemented\n\nthe instructions, respondent No.3, being promotee, would\n\nhave ranked senior to the petitioner. This was an error\n\ncommitted by respondents No.1 and 2 while drawing the\n\nseniority list and while considering the petitioner as senior\n\nto respondent No.3 throughout ever since his recruitment\n\nas Assistant Professor in the year 2009. The petitioner\n\nbecame aware of the instructions only in the year 2021,\n\nhence, his representation and cause of action did not suffer\n\nfrom delay and laches. Reliance in this regard was placed\n\nupon Ajay Kumar Shukla and others Versus Arvind Rai\n\n 10\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nand others2, more particularly para 39 thereof, which\n\nreads as under:-\n\n \"39. The plea to defend the seniority list prepared contrary to\n the statutory provisions on the ground of delay would\n be a difficult proposition. Apart from the submission of\n the appellants that there is no delay as they came to\n know of the three separate lists only in March 2010,\n even if it is assumed that there was some delay and a\n fresh seniority list was being prepared in 2009-2010\n again contrary to the provisions of statutory rules, such\n seniority list cannot be sustained or defended on the\n ground of delay of five years.\"\n\n3(iii). Learned Deputy Advocate General raised the\n\nsame points as put forth by learned counsel for respondent\n\nNo.3.\n\n4. Having heard learned counsel on both sides, I\n\nam of the considered view that in the given facts and\n\ncircumstances, respondent No.3 cannot be permitted to\n\nraise seniority dispute at this stage. The impugned order\n\ndated 03.05.2023 requires to be interfered with. This is for\n\nthe following reasons:-\n\n4(i). Legal position may first be noticed:-\n\n In Pervesh Kumari Versus State of Himachal\n\nPradesh & others3, the principle of law that settled\n\nseniority positions cannot be unsettled after a long lapse of\n\n 2\n\n (2022) 12 SCC 579\n\n 3\n\n LPA No.165 of 2022, decided alongwith connected matter on 14.05.2024.\n\n 11\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\ntime, as enunciated in several precedents, was noticed as\n\nunder:-\n\n \"v) It is well settled principle of service jurisprudence that\n settled seniority positions cannot be unsettled after long\n lapse of time.\n\n \nIn \nDayaram Asanand Gursahani vs. State of\n Maharashta & others\n, (1984) 3 SCC 36, in absence of\n satisfactory explanation for delay of nine years in\n questioning under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of\n India, the validity of seniority assigned to the petitioner,\n his claim in that regard was held not entertainable.\n\n \nIn \nB.S. Bajwa & another vs. State of Punjab &\n others\n, (1998) 2 SCC 523, a grievance was raised about\n seniority positions by the incumbents in the year 1984\n though they had entered the department in 1971-72.\n During this entire period of more than a decade they\n were all along treated as junior to the other persons.\n The Apex Court held that inter se rights had crystallised\n which ought not to have been reopened after the lapse\n of such a long period; At every stage, the others were\n promoted, seniority positions were known to the\n aggrieved incumbents right from the beginning. It was\n held that in service matters the question of seniority\n should not be reopened in such situations after lapse of\n a reasonable period because that results in disturbing\n the settled position which is not justifiable. Inordinate\n delay in making a grievance is sufficient in itself to\n decline interference under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n and to reject the writ petition.\n\n \nThe aforesaid pronouncements were considered\n by the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nAjay Kumar Shukla &\n others vs. Arvind Rai & others\n, Civil Appeal No.5966 of\n 2021 along with connected matter, decided 08.12.2021,\n where the seniority list in question was held to have\n been prepared in contravention to the Recruitment &\n Promotion Rules. Hon'ble Apex Court held that the\n appointing authority would be bound by the Statutory\n Rules and any violation in this regard to the Statutory\n Rules would vitiate the seniority list. The same would\n be arbitrary, de hors the Rules and in conflict with\n \nArticles 14\n \n& 16\n of the Constitution. The only exception\n to above would be where there is unreasonable delay\n which is unexplained.\n\n In this case, the seniority positions finalized on\n 7.01.2000 and accepted by all concerned were to be\n\n 12\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\naltered by the State vide Office Memo dated\n20.02.2020. The purported premise for alteration was\nthat incorrect principle was adopted by the State for\nframing the seniority list on 7.01.2000. Whether the\nreason assigned was justified, correct or not; whether\nthe State had drawn correct seniority list in the year\n2000 or not, is not important at this stage. What is\nsignificant is that more than twenty years have gone by\nfrom the date of finalization of first seniority list of\nPatwaris drawn on 7.01.2000. This seniority list has\nbeen accepted by all concerned including the appellants\nfor more than twenty years. It has been acted upon by\nthe State during all this period. Promotions of the\nincumbents have been effected on the basis of this\nseniority list. Therefore, on that ground alone, the\nseniority list finalized on 7.01.2000 could not have been\naltered in the year 2020. In the instant case, seniority\nlist was drawn on 7.01.2000 purportedly on the basis\nof Rules 15(A) & (B) of the 1992 R&P Rules. It is not that\nthe list was contrary to the R&P Rules. The only thing\nthat can be said at best is that Rules were not very\nhappily worded. Be that as it may, the appellants are\ndeemed to have knowledge of the seniority list, their\nseniority positions as well as the principle on which the\nseniority list was drawn. Merely saying now that\nappellants were not aware of the seniority list or that\nthey ranked junior to the writ petitioners in that\nseniority list, is not sufficient explanation to unsettle the\nsettled seniority positions. For more than twenty years,\nthe seniority list was accepted and acted upon.\nPromotions had also been made on the basis of the\nseniority list. The appellants have failed to give cogent\nreasons for not assailing the seniority list within a\nreasonable period. The redrawal of seniority list after\nmore than twenty years would not just affect a person\nor two but the seniority positions of more than 45\npersons would be upset. The settled seniority position\ncould not be unsettled. \nIn \nR.S. Makashi & others vs. I.M.\nMenon & others\n, (1982) 1 SCC 379, writ petition was\nfiled eight years after circulation of seniority list\nchallenging the principles on which it was drawn. The\nCourt held that belated petitions challenging the\nprinciples of seniority was not maintainable.\n\n \nMalcom Lawrence Cecil D'Souza vs. Union of\nIndia & others\n, (1976) 1 SCC 599, holds that it is\nessential that anyone who feels aggrieved with an\nadministrative decision affecting one's seniority should\n\n 13\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\n act with due diligence and promptitude and not sleep\n over the matter. Raking up old matters like seniority\n after a long time is likely to result in administrative\n complications and difficulties. It would, therefore,\n appear to be in the interest of smoothness and\n efficiency of service that such matters should be given a\n quietus after lapse of some time.\n\n \nK.A. Abdul Majeed vs. State of Kerala & others\n,\n (2001) 6 SCC 292 holds that after a long lapse of time\n the question of initial appointment could not be\n reopened at the instance of the private respondents and\n that too for altering his seniority.\n\n \nShiba Shankar Mohapatra & others vs. State of\n Orissa & others\n, (2010) 12 SCC 471, has held as under:\n\n \"30. Thus, in view of the above, the settled legal\n proposition that emerges is that once the seniority\n had been fixed and it remains in existence for a\n reasonable period, any challenge to the same\n should not be entertained. \nIn [\nK.R. Mudgal &\n others vs. R.P. Singh & others\n, (1986) 4 SCC 531],\n this Court has \nlaid down, in\n crystal clear words\n that a seniority list which remains in existence for\n 3 to 4 years unchallenged, should not be\n disturbed. Thus, 3 - 4 years is a reasonable\n period for challenging the seniority and in case\n someone agitates the issue of seniority beyond\n this period, he has to explain the delay and\n laches in approaching the adjudicatory forum, by\n furnishing satisfactory explanation.\"\n\n It will also be appropriate to take note of the\n\nDivision Bench decision of this Court rendered in Devinder\n\nDutt Sharma Versus State of H.P. & Others 4. The\n\npetitioner therein was Joint Director (Health). His seniority\n\nas Block Medical Officer, Chief Medical Officer, Deputy\n\nDirector (Health) and Additional Director (Health) was\n\nsought to be reviewed by the private respondent (therein) in\n\n 4\n\n CWP No.8185 of 2022, decided on 02.11.2023.\n\n 14\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nhis representation. The respondents therein justified their\n\naction of rectifying the seniority list by submitting that it\n\nwas in their competence to rectify the errors in the seniority\n\nlist, which crept up as the inter-se merit of the eligible\n\nincumbents was not considered appropriately by the DPC.\n\nThe Court took strong exception to the action of the\n\nrespondents in violating the rules of natural justice in not\n\nhearing the petitioner before passing the adverse order\n\nagainst him. While allowing the writ petition, the Court\n\ninter alia observed as under on the unsettling of long settled\n\nseniority position and violation of principles of natural\n\njustice:-\n\n \"14. From the aforesaid facts and attending circumstances,\n it is clearly evident that the petitioner was initially\n appointed as a Medical Officer way back in the year\n 1992. The final seniority list of Medical Officers as it\n stood on 30.03.2000 was issued on 05.03.2001.\n Thereafter, the petitioner was promoted as a Block\n Medical Officer on 08.11.2010 and the seniority list of\n Block Medical Officer was circulated on 25.07.2013. In\n the same, the petitioner was senior to Dr. Keshav Ram,\n Dr. Harsharan Kaur and Dr. Ghanshyam Upadhaya.\n The same was never challenged or assailed by the\n aforesaid three individuals subsequent thereto\n promotions were effected to the post of Chief Medical\n Officer and the petitioner was promoted to the post of\n Chief Medical Officer on 27.12.2016 w.e.f. 24.05.2016.\n Herein again a seniority list was circulated on\n 08.11.2017. In the said list again, Dr. Keshav Ram,\n Dr. Harsharan Kaur and Dr. Ghanshyam Upadhaya\n were junior to the petitioner. The same was never\n assailed by the aforesaid three individuals.\n\n 15. It is only when a representation is filed on 23.2.2019 by\n Dr. Keshav Ram that a review DPC is held on\n\n 15\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\n 20.02.2020. In pursuance to the aforesaid review DPC\n held on 20.02.2020, vide Notification dated 11.03.2020,\n the recommendations made for promoting the petitioner\n to the post of Block Medical Officer, in the panel for the\n year 2010, was altered. As has already been stated\n supra, the seniority list pertaining to Block Medical\n Officers was circulated vide memo dated 25.07.2013.\n No objection qua the same were ever filed by the\n aforesaid three individuals namely Dr. Keshav Ram,\n Dr. Harsharan Kaur and Dr. Ghanshyam Upadhaya.\n Hence, to lay a challenge to the same in the year 2019\n and to get the same reviewed in the year 2020 is\n patently illegal as the same has not been done within\n the prescribed period i.e. 3 to 4 years as \nlaid down in\n\n the aforesaid authoritative pronouncement of the Apex\n Court as relied upon by the petitioner.\n\n 16. Besides the aforesaid, once a representation laying\n challenge to the seniority assigned to the petitioner had\n been filed by Dr. Keshav Ram on 23.02.2019. A copy of\n the same should have been forwarded to the petitioner\n for his response. The same was essential in order to\n comply with the Rules of natural justice, as the allowing\n of the aforesaid representation was to have serious civil\n consequences on the petitioner. Rather than following\n the aforesaid procedure, the respondents-authority held\n a review DPC made alterations in the settled seniority of\n Block Medical Officer. Thereafter, held a review DPC on\n 03.12.2021, whereby the date of promotion of the\n petitioner to the post of Chief Medical Officer was\n changed from 24.05.2016 to 09.01.2017 and further a\n recommendation to withdraw promotion of the petitioner\n to the post of Joint Director had also been taken.\n\n 19. For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned Notification\n dated 28th December, 2021 is quashed in so far as it\n pertains to the petitioner. The respondents are directed\n to restore the seniority of the petitioner prior to the DPCs\n conducted on 20.02.2020 and 13.12.2021 with all\n consequential benefits.\"\n\n4(ii). Reverting to facts of the case, petitioner and\n\nrespondent No.3 both were posted as Assistant Professors\n\n(OBG) in Dr. RPGMC Tanda in the year 2009 or in other\n\nwords, they were serving as Assistant Professors in the\n\n 16\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nsame specialty and in the same college. Petitioner was\n\nappointed as Assistant Professor directly on 30.07.2009,\n\nwhereas respondent No.3 was promoted as such on\n\n26.11.2009. It is not in dispute that from day one of his\n\nappointment as Assistant Professor, the petitioner has been\n\nenjoying higher rank and status than respondent No.3, who\n\njoined the department as Assistant Professor on\n\n26.11.2009. It cannot be expected that respondent No.3\n\nwas not aware that the petitioner had been ranked and\n\nconsidered higher in seniority than him, even if it is\n\npresumed that tentative seniority list of Assistant\n\nProfessors issued vide office memorandum dated\n\n09.03.2015 was not circulated to him, as claimed by him. It\n\nis a matter of record that the petitioner was promoted as\n\nAssociate Professor on 23.05.2015. At the relevant time,\n\nrespondent No.3 was serving as Assistant Professor.\n\nRespondent No.3 obviously was aware of the fact that the\n\npetitioner was enjoying higher rank in seniority over him\n\nand that is how the petitioner got promoted as Associate\n\nProfessor on 23.05.2015. The petitioner was further\n\npromoted as Professor on 30.12.2019. Respondent No.3, at\n\nthat time, was still serving as Assistant Professor. The facts\n\npleaded that respondent No.3 was not aware about\n\n 17\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\npetitioner's higher seniority position or that the tentative\n\nseniority list had not been circulated to him, are only\n\narguments of desperation. In the facts of the case, when\n\nboth the petitioner and respondent No.3 were serving in the\n\nsame department and in the same college, it has to be\n\npresumed that respondent No.3 was aware of petitioner's\n\nhigher rank in seniority over respondent No.3. Therefore,\n\nthe factual contention raised that the seniority/higher rank\n\nassigned to the petitioner over respondent No.3 w.e.f. the\n\nyear 2009 was not to the knowledge of respondent No.3\n\nonly on the ground that the tentative seniority list dated\n\n09.03.2015 was not to his knowledge, is rejected.\n\n4(iii). It is also not in dispute that respondent No.3\n\nnever objected to the higher seniority position/rank/status\n\ngiven to the petitioner as Assistant Professor (OBG) in\n\nDr. RPGMC Tanda w.e.f. the year 2009. He accepted the\n\npetitioner as a higher ranking Doctor over him. Respondent\n\nNo.3 did not object to the promotion of the petitioner as\n\nAssociate Professor on 23.05.2015. Assuming for the sake\n\nof argument that respondent No.3 was not aware about the\n\ntentative seniority list dated 09.03.2015, in which the\n\npetitioner had been placed at higher pedestal than\n\nrespondent No.3, then also, in case respondent No.3 had\n\n 18\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nany grievance against the higher position/seniority of the\n\npetitioner, it was for him to object to petitioner's promotion\n\nas Associate Professor on 23.05.2015, which he did not do.\n\nRespondent No.3 acquiesced in the promotion of the\n\npetitioner to the post of Associate Professor. Not only that,\n\npetitioner was further promoted as Professor on\n\n30.12.2019. It is not the case of respondent No.3 that he\n\never objected to the promotion of the petitioner as Associate\n\nProfessor or Professor at any point of time whatsoever.\n\n In view of above paras 4(i) to 4(iii), it has to be\n\nheld that the seniority claim of respondent No.3 over the\n\npetitioner suffers from unexplained delay and laches. It has\n\nto be construed that respondent No.3 had acquiesced in the\n\nhigher seniority position assigned to the petitioner. He\n\ncannot be permitted to open these issues at this belated\n\nstage.\n\n4(iv). Respondents No.1 and 2 while issuing impugned\n\norder, ordered upsetting the long settled seniority, which\n\nthe petitioner enjoyed over respondent No.3 and also\n\nordered for holding review DPC for withdrawing petitioner's\n\npromotion as Associate Professor on 23.05.2015 & as\n\nProfessor on 30.12.2019. Petitioner's civil rights were under\n\nconsideration and were adversely affected by respondent\n\n 19\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nNo.1 under the impugned order. Yet respondent No.1 did\n\nnot care to follow principles of natural justice. No\n\nopportunity was given to petitioner to place his case before\n\nissuing the impugned order.\n\n It is more than settled that there has to be an\n\nelement of repose and a stale claim more particularly to the\n\none related to seniority & promotion cannot be resuscitated.\n\nAs regards the service matters, more particularly pertaining\n\nto seniority and promotions, the delay is to be strictly\n\nconstrued or else it would amount to unsettling the settled\n\nmatters after a lapse of time. Seniority is a civil right, which\n\nhas an important and vital role to play in one's service\n\ncareer. Future promotion of a government servant depends\n\neither on strict seniority or on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit or merit-cum-seniority. Seniority once settled is\n\ndecisive in the upward march in one's chosen work or\n\ncalling and gives certainty, assurance and boosts the\n\nmorale to do quality work. It instills confidence, spreads\n\nharmony and commands respect among colleagues, which\n\nis paramount factor for good and round administration. If\n\nsettled seniority is unsettled, it may generate bitterness,\n\nresentment, hostility among the government servants\n\n 20\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\n[Refer: Suresh Kapoor and others Versus State of H.P. and\n\nothers5].\n\n4(v). The ratio of the decision rendered in Ajay Kumar\n\nShukla's2 case, relied upon by learned counsel for\n\nrespondent No.3, will not be applicable to the facts of the\n\ninstant case. In the aforesaid case, the seniority list in\n\nquestion was held to have been prepared in contravention\n\nto the Recruitment & Promotion Rules. Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nheld that the appointing authority would be bound by the\n\nStatutory Rules and any violation in this regard to the\n\nStatutory Rules would vitiate the seniority list. The same\n\nwould be arbitrary, de hors the Rules and in conflict with\n\nArticles 14\n \n& 16\n of the Constitution. The only exception to\n\nabove would be where there is unreasonable delay, which is\n\nunexplained.\n\n The claim of respondent No.3 of higher seniority\n\nposition over the petitioner is not based upon the Statutory\n\nRules, but is based upon the instructions contained in\n\nChapter 13 of the Handbook on Personnel Matters, Vol-I,\n\nSecond Edition, issued by the Government of Himachal\n\nPradesh. Further, unreasonable delay on part of respondent\n\nNo.3 in questioning petitioner's seniority is absolutely\n\n 5\n\n CWP No.1218 of 2021, decided on 01.12.2022\n\n 21\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nunexplained. Respondent No.3, as noticed above, has been\n\nthroughout aware of the higher seniority and status enjoyed\n\nby the petitioner over him ever since the year 2009. He\n\ncannot claim ignorance of petitioner's higher seniority\n\nposition merely by alleging that seniority list of Assistant\n\nProfessors prepared on 09.03.2015 was not circulated to\n\nhim. Petitioner and respondent No.3 had been working as\n\nAssistant Professors in the same department and in the\n\nsame college. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 fairly\n\nconceded during hearing that petitioner did enjoy higher\n\nstatus in the department than respondent No.3 as\n\nAssistant Professor with effect from the year 2009 even\n\nthough seniority list of Assistant Professors was issued on\n\n09.03.2015, reflecting petitioner as senior to respondent\n\nNo.3. Petitioner was promoted as Associate Professor on\n\n23.05.2015 and Professor on 30.12.2019, while respondent\n\nNo.3 was still serving as Assistant Professor. Respondent\n\nNo.3 raised no demur or protest at any point of time prior\n\nto 08.03.2021 against higher seniority position and\n\npromotions given to the petitioner.\n\n Howsoever strong an employee's case on merits\n\nagainst seniority position may be, he is required to lay it\n\nout in open at the relevant time-within reasonable period.\n\n 22\n\n 2024:HHC:12276\n\nSeniority dispute is not 'Snakes & Ladders' game, where an\n\nofficial occupying a high position can be brought down to\n\nground level by mere roll of dice at any time at the desire of\n\nthe other official occupying a lower position.\n\n5. In view of the above discussion, I find merit in\n\nthe instant petition. The same is accordingly allowed.\n\nImpugned order dated 03.05.2023 (Annexure P-10) is\n\nquashed and set aside. Pending miscellaneous\n\napplication(s), if any, also stand disposed of.\n\n Jyotsna Rewal Dua\nNovember 19, 2024 Judge\n Mukesh",

The purported premise for alteration was\nthat incorrect principle was adopted by the State for\nframing the seniority list on 7.01.2000. Whether the\nreason assigned was justified, correct or not; whether\nthe State had drawn correct seniority list in the year\n2000 or not, is not important at this stage. What is\nsignificant is that more than twenty years have gone by\nfrom the date of finalization of first seniority list of\nPatwaris drawn on 7.01.2000. This seniority list has\nbeen accepted by all concerned including the appellants\nfor more than twenty years. It has been acted upon by\nthe State during all this period. Promotions of the\nincumbents have been effected on the basis of this\nseniority list. Therefore, on that ground alone, the\nseniority list finalized on 7.01.2000 could not have been\naltered in the year 2020. In the instant case, seniority\nlist was drawn on 7.01.2000 purportedly on the basis\nof Rules 15(A) & (B) of the 1992 R&P Rules. It is not that\nthe list was contrary to the R&P Rules. The only thing\nthat can be said at best is that Rules were not very\nhappily worded. Be that as it may, the appellants are\ndeemed to have knowledge of the seniority list, their\nseniority positions as well as the principle on which the\nseniority list was drawn. Merely saying now that\nappellants were not aware of the seniority list or that\nthey ranked junior to the writ petitioners in that\nseniority list, is not sufficient explanation to unsettle the\nsettled seniority positions. For more than twenty years,\nthe seniority list was accepted and acted upon.\nPromotions had also been made on the basis of the\nseniority list. The appellants have failed to give cogent\nreasons for not assailing the seniority list within a\nreasonable period. The redrawal of seniority list after\nmore than twenty years would not just affect a person\nor two but the seniority positions of more than 45\npersons would be upset. The settled seniority position\ncould not be unsettled. \nIn \nR.S. Makashi & others vs. I.M.\nMenon & others\n, (1982) 1 SCC 379, writ petition was\nfiled eight years after circulation of seniority list\nchallenging the principles on which it was drawn. The\nCourt held that belated petitions challenging the\nprinciples of seniority was not maintainable."
