Sikri, J. \n\n \n\n 1. The facts of all the three petitions are\nsubstantially the same. They involve common question\nof law. They were heard together and it is proposed to\ndispose of these petitions by this common judgment. \n\n CWP No. 6789/2000 was treated as the leading\ncase and the counsel for the parties made their\nsubmissions with reference to the record of this case.\nIt would be therefore appropriate to narrate the facts\nof this petition for understanding the controversy and\nappreciate the respective points of view of the\nparties. \n\n 2. The petitioners in this petition feel\naggrieved by judgment dated 9th November, 2000 passed\nby the learned Tribunal in OA No. 1407/2000. These\npetitioners and private respondent, namely, respondent\nNo. 3 are all working as Scenographer Gr. C on long term\nbasis. The respondent No. 3 is senior to the\npetitioners. Next promotion is to the post of\nStenographer Gr. 'B'&'A'. It may be mentioned that the\nservice of the petitioner and the respondent No. 3\ncomprises of Grades 'D', 'C', 'B' and 'A' in ascending\norder of hierarchy. Later 'B'&'A' were merged and\ntermed 'merged A&B' Grades. Next promotion is to the\nmerged 'A&B'. It is governed by Central Secretariat\nStenographers Services(CSSS) Rules, 1969. As per these\nRules promotion to the grade of merged Gr. A&B in CSSS\nis made after 8 years of completed services. Rule 2(C)\nof CSSS Rules defines approved services in the following\nmanner: \n\n \"2(c)-\"approved service\" in relation to\nany Grade means the period or periods of\nservice in that Grade rendered after\nselection, according to prescribed\nprocedure for long term appointment to\nthe Grade, and includes any period or\nperiods during which an officer would\nhave held a duty post in that Grade but\nfor his being on leave or otherwise not\nbeing available for holding such post.\" \n\n 3. While it is not in dispute that the\npetitioners were junior to the respondent No. 3, it is\nalso not in dispute that in cadre of Grade C, the\npetitioners completed 8 years of approved service in\nthe year 1995 as they were promoted as Gr. C on 30th\nJanuary, 1987 whereas the respondent No. 3 was promoted\non 30th June, 2000. Between the years 1995 and 2000\nthe petitioners were promoted to merged A&B Grade on\nadhoc basis from time to time. The respondent No. 3\nthough senior was not given promotion even on adhoc\nbasis as he had not completed 8 years of approved\nservice at that time. Since the appointment was only\non adhoc basis and in the year 2000 the respondent No. 3\ncompleted 8 years of approved services, while passing\norders of adhoc promotion, keeping in view the\nseniority of the respondent No. 3 and the fact that he\nhad become eligible for promotion to merged A&B grade\non completion of 8 years of approved service, the\nrespondent No. 3 was given promotion on adhoc basis to\nreplace the petitioners. At this juncture, the\npetitioners filed OA No. 1407/2000 with the following\nprayers: \n\n 1. permit the applicants to file detailed\nparticulars to supplement this Original\nApplication, since the time to make the\nOA available was less than 24 hours, and \n\n \n\n 2. Call for relevant record, and \n\n \n\n 3. Declare and order that applicants'\nseniority as Steno Grade 'C' in Central\nSecretariat Stenographers Service shall\ncount since the date of\nappointment/promotion to that Grade on\nlong-term basis effective 30.1.1987,\nsince when they counted their 'Approved\nService' in that Grade for promotion to\nhigher Grades, and \n \n\n 4. Declare and order that the applicants'\npromotion in the Grade of Stenos(merged\nA&B) since 1995 shall be treated as\nregular, instead of as 'adhoc' and \n\n \n\n 5. Further, declare and order that the\napplicants shall not be disturbed from\ntheir present posts of Stenos(merged A&B)\nGrade, except by those who would/could\nhave been promoted to those posts on\nregular/adhoc basis (when those\nposts/vacancies first arose) in\npreference to the applicants, after\nsatisfying the eligibility conditions on\nthose dates when the posts/vacancies\narose or the applicants were promoted\nthereto, and \n\n \n\n 6. Grant any other relief. \n\n 4. Before the learned Tribunal, the case of the\npetitioners was that there was practically no\ndistinction between the long term promotion/appointment\nand the promotion on regular basis and indeed such a\ndistinction which was made earlier was done away with\nby Notification dated 21st June, 1995 issued by the\nofficial respondents. Therefore in 1995, when the\npetitioners were promoted to merged A&B Gr.\nStenographers it was a regular promotion though\nlabelled as adhoc. They were now sought to be replaced\nby persons who were in fact juniors to the petitioners\nwhich was impermissible in law. It was argued, in the\nalternative, that an adhoc employee cannot replace\nanother adhoc employee ant they could be replaced only\nby regular employees. \n\n \n5. The learned Tribunal dismissed the OA on two\ncounts. First, it held that the petitioners had no\ncause of action to file the OA as they were neither\nserved with the notice of reversion nor an order of\nreversion and in the absence of any such order of\nreversion, no cause of action had arisen for filing the\nOA. Secondly, the petitioners in any case had no merit\nin their OA. It proceeded to decide the OA on merits\nas the matter was argued at length. The learned\nTribunal found that the claim of the petitioners that\ntheir appointment on long term basis should be counted\nfrom 30th January, 1987 was not tenable inasmuch as\nseniority list were to be published right from 1992\ntill it was updated in 2000 when their seniority was\nfixed on the basis of their regular\npromotion/appointment in Grade 'C'. They were placed\nin the select list in 1989 and they never made any\ngrievance about their position in the seniority list\nearlier and they were raising this objection only in\nthe OA. They also could not justify their claim that\nthey were senior to others who may replace them. The\nlearned Tribunal, therefore, came to the conclusion\nthat their claim was not only barred by limitation,\nhaving accepted the position in their seniority list\npublished from 1992, it was also hit by the principle\nof estoppel or acquiencence. The learned Tribunal also\nrejected the contention of the petitioners to the\neffect that adhoc appointee cannot be replaced by\nanother adhoc appointee, relying upon its earlier\njudgment dated 3rd April, 2000 in earlier OA No. 2398/99\nin the case of \nSh. N.K. Oudeja v. Union of India\n\nwherein the learned Tribunal had held :\n\n\"It is no doubt, true that normally the\nDepartment cannot replace him by another\nadhoc employee. It must be noted that in\nthe present case the applicants was\npromoted as Senior Assistants were not\nfound eligible for promotion on account\nof their not fulfillling the prescribed\nminimum length of approved service. As\nit is now stated in the reply that the\nseniors to the applicant were found\neligible in July, 1999 for promotion, the\napplicant along with others had to be\nnecessarily reverted.\"\n\n 6. The learned Tribunal, therefore, observed that\nsince the respondent No. 3 had now completed 8 years of\nservice and was senior to the petitioners that he had\nbecome entitled to be promoted on adhoc basis to the\nmerged A&B Gr. and the applicants were liable to be\nreverted to give way to their seniors in service. \n\n Challenging the aforesaid decision of the\nlearned Tribunal, Mr. G.K. Aggarwal learned counsel\nappearing for the petitioners canvassed before us the\nfollowing propositions: \n\n1. Even if the private respondents were\nseniors to the petitioners, since the petitioners\ncompleted the approved service earlier than those\nrespondents, they became eligible for promotion to\nmerged A&B Gr. of Stenographers earlier in point of\ntime, and therefore, in the eligibility list for\npromotion they should be ranked senior to the private\nrespondents who acquired the eligibility conditions\nlater in point of time. \n\n 2. Unless an employee became eligible for\npromotion he could not find place in the seniority list\ninasmuch as as per Regulation 3 of the Central\nSecretariat Service (Preparation of Common Seniority\nList) Regulations, 1970 framed by the Central\nGovernment under Rule 23 readwith Rule 2(h) of CSS\nRules, 1962 the common seniority list was to be\nprepared on the basis of eligibility. This Regulation,\non which heavy reliance was placed, reads as under: \n\n \" 3 PREPARATION OF THE COMMON SENIORITY\nLIST : \n\n (1) A common seniority list of officers\nof the Assistants' grade of all Cadres,\nwho have rendered not less than eight\nyears approved service in the grade shall\nbe prepared as on the 1st January of\nevery year. \n\n For this purpose the Government shall\nobtain from the Cadre authority the names\nof all such officers of the Assistants'\ngrade included in their respective\nCadres. \n\n (2) The names of the officers referred to\nin Sub-regulation (1) shall be arranged\nin a single list in the following order,\nnamely:- \n\n (a) Officers appointed substantively to\nthe Assistants' grade with effect from\nany date before the appointed day or on\nthe appointed day shall be arranged in\nthe order of seniority in that grade as\non the appointed day; and \n\n \n\n (b) Other officers appointed\nsubstantively to the Assistants' grade\nshall be arranged in the following\nmanner, namely:- \n\n Subject to their inter se seniority in\ntheir respective Cadres being maintained,\nthe names of those officers appointed to\nthe grade as direct recruits on the basis\nof competitive examination shall be\narranged according to their order of\nmerit in the competitive examination,\npersons appointed from an earlier\nexamination being placed above those\nappointed from later examination. In\nthis combined list of direct recruits,\nthe names of persons substantively\nappointed to the grade from the select\nlists for the grade shall be arranged by\nplacing each such officer immediately\nabove the seniormost direct recruit who\nis junior to him in his Cadre. \n\n (c) Select List officers not yet\nconfirmed in the Assistants' grade shall\nbe arranged according to the length of\ntheir approved service in that grade.\" \n\n 7. It may be mentioned at this stage that the\npetitioners in CWP No. 1234/2001 and CWP No. 326/2001 are\nworking as Assistants and the next promotion is to the\npost of Section Officers for which again, 8 years\napproved service as Assistants is required for\npromotion to the post of Section Officer. The\npetitioners are junior to private respondents as\nAssistants but completed 8 years approved service as\nAssistants before the private respondents, and\ntherefore, acquired the eligibility prior in point of\ntime. They were also promoted as Section Officers on\nadhoc basis and sought to be replaced by the private\nrespondents when the private respondents acquired the\neligibility for the post of Section Officer on\ncompleting the requisite approved service. \n\n 8. It is for this reason, we have mentioned that\nthe question of law which is to be decided is common in\nall these petitions. \n\n 9. Before proceedings to consider the submissions\nmade by Mr. G.K. Aggarwal, it would be appropriate to\ntake stock of the arguments advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the respondents. Mr. A.K. Bhardwaj,\nappearing for the official respondents defended the\nimpugned judgment by adopting the reasoning given by\nthe learned Tribunal in these judgments. His further\nsubmission was that the petitioners were trying to\nenlarge the scope of the writ petitions inasmuch as\nprayer in the OAs would clearly suggest that the main\ngrievance of the petitioners was their replacement by\nthe private respondents who were seniors to the\npetitioners and had become eligible for promotional\nposts. He submitted that since the promotion was made\nonly on adhoc basis without following the rules and\nwhen the senior persons were available they were to be\ngiven the preference. His further submission was that\nfor this purpose junior persons like the petitioners\nwho were earlier given adhoc promotions could be\nreverted to give way to the seniors who had become\neligible. He also submitted that even the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners conceded this position.\nHis submission was that the further arguments of the\npetitioners' counsel about eligibility list,\nacquiesence of eligibility criteria by the petitioners\nearlier in point of time etc., were not permissible as\nthis was not the subject matter of the OA or the writ\npetition and as the promotions were not going to be\nmade on regular basis such a question did not arise in\nthese petitions. He further submitted that regular\npromotions are made on the basis of combined seniority\nlist by the UPSC. Since this process takes time, in\nthe meantime when post becomes available in a\nparticular department/Ministry adhoc promotion is given\nto the senior most eligible person in that\ndepartment/Ministry without taking into consideration\nthe combined seniority list and such an adhoc\nappointment given to the petitioners would not confer\nany right upon the petitioners which was not given\nafter following the rules and therefore, it could not\nbe treated as promotion on regular basis but was only a\nstop-gap arrangement. \n\n 10. Mr. B.T. Kaul, learned counsel appearing for the\nprivate respondents while adopting the aforesaid\nsubmissions of Mr. Bhardwaj, additionally argued that\nthe seniority list was first prepared in the year 1992.\nIn that seniority list, the name of the respondent No. 3\nwas shown at S.No. 96 whereas the petitioners were at\nS.No. 107 and below. It is because of this reason that\nin the seniority list published as on 1st January, 1999\nthe inter-se seniority of the respondent No. 3 vis-a-vis\nthe petitioners was maintained. The seniority list of\n1999 simply reiterated the position which was\nprevailing for number of years since 1992 and\ntherefore, the petitioners never challenged their\nseniority vis-a-vis the respondent No. 3 earlier, and\ntherefore, such a settled position of seniority should\nnot be allowed to be unsettled after a long period.\nHe, thus, submitted that the learned Tribunal was right\nin rejecting the OA of the petitioners on the ground of\nestoppel and acquiescence as well. \n\n 11. After hearing the parties at length, we are\ninclined to agree with the submissions of the learned\ncounsel for the respondents to the effect that what is\nargued by the petitioners in this case was not the\nscope of OA or the present writ petitions. The perusal\nof the OA would clearly indicated that the petitioners\nhad rushed to the learned Tribunal after they had faced\nthe threat of reversion from the promoted posts to\nwhich posts they were promoted on adhoc basis, to the\nsubstantive post being held by them inasmuch as their\nseniors had become eligible for promotion as per the\nRules and the official respondents had taken action to\ngive them the promotions on adhoc basis. The main\ncontention of the petitioners before the learned\nTribunal, as already noted above, was that their\nappointment to the promoted post was on regular basis\nand they could not be reverted and in the alternative,\nthey had submitted that they could be replaced only by\nregular incumbents and not appointing other person on\nadhoc basis. These contentions were rightly rejected\nby the learned Tribunal. From the very nature of the\npromotion orders, it becomes crystal clear that the\npromotion was only on adhoc basis as a stop-gap\narrangement inasmuch as promotion on regular basis\ncould be by UPSC following the combined seniority list\nof all the employees in their category in the CSS\ninstead the petitioners were promoted in their\ndepartment/particular Ministry without following the\nRules and keeping in view their seniority and\neligibility at the relevant time since other senior\npersons, namely, the private respondents were not\neligible. Therefore, the petitioners were not given\nthe promotion on regular basis. They are now sought to\nbe replaced by those seniors who have in the meantime\nbecome eligible. Since the promotion of the private\nrespondents is also on adhoc basis and private\nrespondents being senior and now eligible, have been\ngiven preference for adhoc promotion. The learned\nTribunal was, therefore, right in rejecting this\ncontention of the petitioners as well. In fact\nMr. G.K. Aggarwal learned counsel for the petitioners at\nthe time of arguments, even conceded that the persons\nsenior to the petitioners could replace them who were\nthe juniors for the purpose of adhoc promotion. This\nposition having not been disputed, no further\ndiscussion is required on this aspect. \n\n 12. However, the main grievance projected by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners was that as the\npetitioners, who may be junior to the private\nrespondents in a particular cadre, became eligible for\nfurther promotion earlier than the private respondents,\nthey should be treated as senior in the eligibility\nlist for promotion to the higher post of merged 'A&B'\nGr. or SOs as the case may be. This issue was not\nraised in OA. It does not appear to have been argued\nas well as there is no discussion of this kind in the\nimpugned judgment. Only in OA out of which CWP\nNo. 1234/2001 has arisen, it appears, this contention\nwas raised which was rejected on the ground that the\nquestion was of adhoc promotion and not regular\npromotions against regular vacancies. This is what is\nobserved by the learned Tribunal in para 9 of judgment\ndated 20th February, 2001 rendered in OA No. 1071/2000\nout of which CWP No. 1234/2001 arises: \n\n\"The next ground taken is that as per DP\n& T's OM dated 10.4.89, backlog of\nvacancies must be filled yearwise and\nonly those who were eligible on dates of\noccurrence of vacancies could be\nconsidered. Therefore, as in 1997, so\nalso as of date, respondents 3 to 13 are\nnot eligible to be promoted in vacancies\noccupied by respondents. This OM is\napplicable in regard to regular\npromotions made against regular vacancies\non the recommendations of a regularly\nconstituted DPC under the aegis of the\nCadre Controlling Authority. In the case\nbefore us, the promotions are not regular\npromotions, but adhoc promotions made as\na stop gap arrangement till regular\npromotions are made by a regularly\nconstituted DPC under the aegis of the\nCadre Controlling Authority. Hence this\nground fails.\"\n\n 13. We fully agree with the reasoning of the\nlearned Tribunal. The promotions made as\nstop-gap arrangement, as already pointed out above. As\nand when promotions are made on regular basis and\nbacklog of vacancies is not filled year-wise and in\nconformity with the DP&T's OM dated 10th April, 1989 it\nwould always be open for the petitioners to challenge\nsuch an action of the respondents. The question as to\nwhether the eligibility list for the purpose of\npromotion is to be prepared on the basis of the date of\ncompleting the approved service is not required to be\ngone into in these proceedings as this issue neither\nripened nor was the subject matter of OA. Therefore,\nit is not necessary to express any opinion at this\nstage on this issue. As and when the promotions are\nmade on regular basis and the petitioner feel\naggrieved against the methodology and procedure adopted\nby the official respondents in ignoring their claims,\nthey would be at liberty to approach the learned\nTribunal by filing appropriate OA questioning such an\naction of the respondents which would be dealt with by\nthe learned Tribunal on its own merit. This liberty is\ngranted. It is stated at the cost of repetition that\nin the present case, cause of action related to the\nthreatened reversion of the petitioners from the\npromoted posts to which they were promoted on adhoc\nbasis on their seniors becoming eligible for promotion\nand when they were given promotion on adhoc basis. \n\n 14. The consequence of the aforesaid discussion is\nthat subject to grant of liberty as aforementioned,\nthese writ petitions fail and are hereby dismissed. \n\n 15. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.",

Bhardwaj,\nappearing for the official respondents defended the\nimpugned judgment by adopting the reasoning given by\nthe learned Tribunal in these judgments. His further\nsubmission was that the petitioners were trying to\nenlarge the scope of the writ petitions inasmuch as\nprayer in the OAs would clearly suggest that the main\ngrievance of the petitioners was their replacement by\nthe private respondents who were seniors to the\npetitioners and had become eligible for promotional\nposts. He submitted that since the promotion was made\nonly on adhoc basis without following the rules and\nwhen the senior persons were available they were to be\ngiven the preference. His further submission was that\nfor this purpose junior persons like the petitioners\nwho were earlier given adhoc promotions could be\nreverted to give way to the seniors who had become\neligible. He also submitted that even the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners conceded this position.\nHis submission was that the further arguments of the\npetitioners' counsel about eligibility list,\nacquiesence of eligibility criteria by the petitioners\nearlier in point of time etc., were not permissible as\nthis was not the subject matter of the OA or the writ\npetition and as the promotions were not going to be\nmade on regular basis such a question did not arise in\nthese petitions. He further submitted that regular\npromotions are made on the basis of combined seniority\nlist by the UPSC. Since this process takes time, in\nthe meantime when post becomes available in a\nparticular department/Ministry adhoc promotion is given\nto the senior most eligible person in that\ndepartment/Ministry without taking into consideration\nthe combined seniority list and such an adhoc\nappointment given to the petitioners would not confer\nany right upon the petitioners which was not given\nafter following the rules and therefore, it could not\nbe treated as promotion on regular basis but was only a\nstop-gap arrangement."

It is because of this reason that\nin the seniority list published as on 1st January, 1999\nthe inter-se seniority of the respondent No. 3 vis-a-vis\nthe petitioners was maintained. The seniority list of\n1999 simply reiterated the position which was\nprevailing for number of years since 1992 and\ntherefore, the petitioners never challenged their\nseniority vis-a-vis the respondent No. 3 earlier, and\ntherefore, such a settled position of seniority should\nnot be allowed to be unsettled after a long period.\nHe, thus, submitted that the learned Tribunal was right\nin rejecting the OA of the petitioners on the ground of\nestoppel and acquiescence as well."

After hearing the parties at length, we are\ninclined to agree with the submissions of the learned\ncounsel for the respondents to the effect that what is\nargued by the petitioners in this case was not the\nscope of OA or the present writ petitions. The perusal\nof the OA would clearly indicated that the petitioners\nhad rushed to the learned Tribunal after they had faced\nthe threat of reversion from the promoted posts to\nwhich posts they were promoted on adhoc basis, to the\nsubstantive post being held by them inasmuch as their\nseniors had become eligible for promotion as per the\nRules and the official respondents had taken action to\ngive them the promotions on adhoc basis. The main\ncontention of the petitioners before the learned\nTribunal, as already noted above, was that their\nappointment to the promoted post was on regular basis\nand they could not be reverted and in the alternative,\nthey had submitted that they could be replaced only by\nregular incumbents and not appointing other person on\nadhoc basis. These contentions were rightly rejected\nby the learned Tribunal. From the very nature of the\npromotion orders, it becomes crystal clear that the\npromotion was only on adhoc basis as a stop-gap\narrangement inasmuch as promotion on regular basis\ncould be by UPSC following the combined seniority list\nof all the employees in their category in the CSS\ninstead the petitioners were promoted in their\ndepartment/particular Ministry without following the\nRules and keeping in view their seniority and\neligibility at the relevant time since other senior\npersons, namely, the private respondents were not\neligible. Therefore, the petitioners were not given\nthe promotion on regular basis. They are now sought to\nbe replaced by those seniors who have in the meantime\nbecome eligible. Since the promotion of the private\nrespondents is also on adhoc basis and private\nrespondents being senior and now eligible, have been\ngiven preference for adhoc promotion. The learned\nTribunal was, therefore, right in rejecting this\ncontention of the petitioners as well. In fact\nMr. G.K. Aggarwal learned counsel for the petitioners at\nthe time of arguments, even conceded that the persons\nsenior to the petitioners could replace them who were\nthe juniors for the purpose of adhoc promotion. This\nposition having not been disputed, no further\ndiscussion is required on this aspect."

However, the main grievance projected by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners was that as the\npetitioners, who may be junior to the private\nrespondents in a particular cadre, became eligible for\nfurther promotion earlier than the private respondents,\nthey should be treated as senior in the eligibility\nlist for promotion to the higher post of merged 'A&B'\nGr. or SOs as the case may be. This issue was not\nraised in OA. It does not appear to have been argued\nas well as there is no discussion of this kind in the\nimpugned judgment. Only in OA out of which CWP\nNo. 1234/2001 has arisen, it appears, this contention\nwas raised which was rejected on the ground that the\nquestion was of adhoc promotion and not regular\npromotions against regular vacancies. This is what is\nobserved by the learned Tribunal in para 9 of judgment\ndated 20th February, 2001 rendered in OA No. 1071/2000\nout of which CWP No. 1234/2001 arises:"

This OM is\napplicable in regard to regular\npromotions made against regular vacancies\non the recommendations of a regularly\nconstituted DPC under the aegis of the\nCadre Controlling Authority.

The question as to\nwhether the eligibility list for the purpose of\npromotion is to be prepared on the basis of the date of\ncompleting the approved service is not required to be\ngone into in these proceedings as this issue neither\nripened nor was the subject matter of OA. Therefore,\nit is not necessary to express any opinion at this\nstage on this issue. As and when the promotions are\nmade on regular basis and the petitioner feel\naggrieved against the methodology and procedure adopted\nby the official respondents in ignoring their claims,\nthey would be at liberty to approach the learned\nTribunal by filing appropriate OA questioning such an\naction of the respondents which would be dealt with by\nthe learned Tribunal on its own merit. This liberty is\ngranted. It is stated at the cost of repetition that\nin the present case, cause of action related to the\nthreatened reversion of the petitioners from the\npromoted posts to which they were promoted on adhoc\nbasis on their seniors becoming eligible for promotion\nand when they were given promotion on adhoc basis."
